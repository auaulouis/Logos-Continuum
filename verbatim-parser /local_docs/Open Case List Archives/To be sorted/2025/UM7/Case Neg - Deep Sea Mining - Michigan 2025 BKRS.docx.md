#### **[Knowledge gaps]{.underline} within deep sea mining means it [inevitably]{.underline} fails.**

[Uncertainties, **[Knowledge Gaps]{.mark}**, and Areas for Future
Research Many questions and uncertainties [surround deep-sea
mining]{.mark},]{.underline} including those stemming from the
complexity and scale of the proposed operations, and those arising from
legal uncertainties relating to proposed exploitation in the Area and
the fact that [**[no large-scale]{.mark}** impact [trials have]{.mark}
yet [taken place.]{.mark}]{.underline} In this review, we have presented
some of the key issues, but very substantial and significant knowledge
gaps remain. Data indicating the recovery of deep-sea biota following
physical disturbance are scarce and thus this is an area warranting
additional research. T[here is an absence of baseline data from
potential mining sites because only [a fraction of the ocean has been
studied]{.mark} in depth [due to the **logistical**]{.mark}
[**complexity** and financial constraints of **accessing** the deep
sea.]{.mark} Future studies could focus on understanding deep-sea
ecology (for example, local endemism, demographic and genetic
connectivity relating to dispersal modes) in the proposed mining
zones.]{.underline}

Discussions are underway to develop the legal framework to regulate
exploitation, including issues of environmental protection,
accountability, interactions across international and national
boundaries, and also between claims, with input from marine scientists,
legal specialists, and non-governmental organizations. [Uncertainties
surrounding deep-sea ecology and ecological responses to mining-related
activities mean that environmental management strategies would need to
be tailored to incorporate natural temporal and spatial variability of
**deepsea ecosystems**]{.underline} (Clark et al., 2010). The impact of
noise on deep-sea organisms is not well-studied, which represents
another significant knowledge gap in the management of commercial
activities.

Alternatives Approaches It is widely accepted that demand for metals for
use in clean energy and emerging technologies will increase in the next
decades, raising the likelihood of supply risk. In response, retrieving
metal resources from seabed mining has been identified as one of five
sectors with a high potential for development within the European
Commission's blue growth strategy (European Commission, 2017a). The
strategy aims to provide support to long-term sustainable growth in the
marine and maritime sectors within the region, and the European
Commission optimistically estimates that by 2020, 5% of the world's
minerals could be sourced from the ocean floor (Ehlers, 2016). If
technological challenges are overcome, the annual turnover of marine
minerals mining within Europe could grow from zero to 10 billion Euros
by 2030 (Ehlers, 2016). [However, there are **[alternatives]{.mark}** to
exploiting virgin stocks of ore from the seabed. Such approaches
[include: **substituting metals**]{.mark} in short supply, [such as rare
earths]{.mark}, for more abundant minerals with similar
properties]{.underline} (United States Department of Energy, 2010;
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, 2012); landfill
mining (Wagner and Raymond, 2015); and collection and recycling of
components from products at the end of their life-cycle. Other novel
options include the potential to recover lithium and other rare metals
from seawater (Hoshino, 2015). A European Commission initiative, adopted
in 2015[, [supports the **transition** toward a **circular
economy**]{.mark} that promotes recycling and reuse of materials---from
production to consumption---[so that **raw materials** are fed back into
the **economy**]{.mark}]{.underline} (European Commission, 2017b),
though the strategy will depend on developing the necessary technology
as well as changing consumer behavior. Recycling, though crucial, is
unlikely to provide sufficient quantities of metals to satisfy
requirements in future years which has prompted suggestions that
reducing use of metals in products will be a necessary part of product
design (United Nations Environment Programme, 2013a). [Increasing the
longevity of technological devices and promoting responsible e-waste
recycling could be achieved through manufacturer take-back schemes, in
which component [materials can be **safely** and **effectively
recovered** for reuse. ]{.mark}]{.underline}Recycling metals carries its
own challenges, which include potential release of toxic substances
during processing and limitations during metals recovery that mean not
all components can be isolated (United Nations Environment Programme,
2013a). A shift in focus to reducing consumption and, in addition,
better product design (United Nations Environment Programme, 2013b).
Closing the loop on metals use is possible because in theory all metals
are recyclable, though we are some years away from achieving such a
system (Reck and Graedel, 2012). [Improving consumer access to recycling
and streamlining manufacturing processes can be a [more
**efficient**]{.mark} and economically viable method of sourcing metals
[than **mining**]{.mark} virgin [ore and]{.mark} could greatly reduce or
even **[negate]{.mark}** the need for [**exploitation** of seabed
mineral resources.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### **Even [small]{.underline} DSM trials are [prone]{.underline} to accidents.**

**Shukman 21,** Journalist and Former Science Editor of BBC News, B.A.
in Geography at the University of Durham. (David, 4-29-2021, "Accident
Leaves Deep Sea Mining Machine Stranded," BBC,
https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-56921773).//SM

**[[A]{.mark} prototype [d]{.mark}eep [s]{.mark}ea [m]{.mark}ining
[machine is]{.mark} lying [stranded on the floor of the Pacific
Ocean]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}** The 25-tonne un-crewed device
became detached from the cable linking it to a ship at the surface.

The accident happened halfway through a month-long programme of trials
and research**[. [It comes]{.mark} amid heightened controversy [over
plans to mine the minerals]{.mark} contained i[n the
seabed.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The robotic machine, known as Patania II, was developed by GSR, a
Belgian company, to collect small rocks known as nodules. It was
deployed in an area of the Pacific licensed to GSR for exploration -
several dozen zones have been earmarked to companies and governments in
this way.

[[The first phase]{.mark} of trials [was almost complete when
the]{.mark} umbilical [cable became **detached** from its connection to
the machine]{.mark}.]{.underline} A spokesman for GSR told BBC News:
\"On its final dive in the GSR area, a lifting point separated and
Patania II now stands on the seafloor.

\"An operation to reconnect the lifting point begins this evening and we
will provide an update in due course.\" If the machine is successfully
retrieved, it will be redeployed for further research in an area
licensed to Germany.

[But [**recovery** in such **extreme depths** cannot be
guaranteed]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The incident happened a few
days ago and the news was just broken by Greenpeace which has been
monitoring the activities of deep sea mining companies.

Dr Sandra Schoettner, a deep-sea biologist from Greenpeace Germany,
who\'s on board the Rainbow Warrior ship in the Pacific Ocean, said:
\"It\'s ironic that an industry that wants to extract metals from the
seabed ends up dropping it down there instead.

[\"[This]{.mark} glaring operational [**failure** must]{.mark} act as a
stark **warning** that deep sea mining is **too big a
risk**]{.underline}. Losing control of a 25-tonne mining machine at the
bottom of the Pacific Ocean [should [**sink** the idea of **ever**
mining the deep sea.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}

Two years ago, the same company had to stop trials of a smaller
prototype after damage to its umbilical cable. [Clearly, [there are
**serious tech**]{.mark}nological [**challenges** to operating in
the]{.mark} pitch-black [depths.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### **It is [impossible]{.underline} to develop [efficient]{.underline} and [safe]{.underline} deep-sea mining tech due to the [complexity]{.underline} of the deep sea.**

**Zhang 24,** Assistant Professor in Computer Science and Engineering at
the University of South Carolina, PhD in Engineering and Computer

equipment of deep-sea mining: State of the art and perspectives," KeAi
Chinese Roots Global Impact,

Although a considerable number of sea trials of deep-sea mining have
been carried out, [the [d]{.mark}eep-[s]{.mark}ea [m]{.mark}ining [does
not achieve the]{.mark} commercial [exploitation due to the complexity
of d]{.mark}eep-[s]{.mark}ea [m]{.mark}ining system and deep-sea mining
environment.]{.underline} In fact, to achieve commercial deep-sea
mining, the technology and equipment of deep-sea mining are the key
points. Therefore, the present study presents the development of the
technology and equipment of deep-sea mining. It commences with a
requirement of technology and equipment for deep-sea mining, including
environmental impact, reliability, energy cost, efficiency, etc. Then, a
historical perspective and present-day effort related to deep-sea mining
vehicles are given, which highlights the evolution of collection
mechanism and walking mode of deep-sea mining vehicle. Subsequently, the
present study discusses the operation of subsea lifting system and
surface support system, shedding light on the crucial equipment and
processes. [[The challenges a]{.mark}nd prospects in the deep-sea mining
are presented in final, [includ]{.mark}ing [environmental protection,
self-propelled crawler, hydraulic pipeline lifting, and intelligent
equipment, etc]{.mark}.]{.underline} At present, [[there is no deep-sea
mining system suitable for]{.mark} commercial [development]{.mark}
globally, and most equipment is still in the research and development
and testing stage.]{.underline} In the future, deep-sea mining equipment
still needs to further develop towards high efficiency and low
disturbance (Atmanand et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024a,b; Liu et al.,
2023). [[On the other hand,]{.mark} some researchers indicated that
[deepsea mining will damage deep-sea ecosystems and
biodiversity,]{.mark} e.g., sediment plumes, noise, and chemical
pollution could]{.underline} (Danovaro et al., 2017; Sharma and Smith,
2019).

#### Deep sea mining [empirically]{.underline} fails.

**Schrepferman 20,** Associate Editor and Staff Writer for the HIR,
Undergraduate in Government and Data Science at Harvard. (Will,
4-4-2020, "Diamonds are Forever, but the Environment is Not: The Dangers
of Deep Seabed Mining," Harvard International Review,
https://hir.harvard.edu/diamonds-are-forever-but-the-environment-is-not-the-dangers-of-deep-seabed-mining/)//SM

The existence of these mining technologies is a recent
development; Kristen Thompson of the University of Exeter stated in 2019
that "it is only now that the technology has been developed that might
make deep-seabed mining a reality."[ However, that reality has not been
without challenges. [Upon]{.mark} attempting to **[launch]{.mark}**, the
multimillion dollar [Patania II experienced a **power
failure**]{.mark} right before it was set to deploy.]{.underline} A new
launch schedule has not been set as of the writing of this article. This
failure is but a setback, however, and the race among companies to mine
the seabed continues unevenly towards its finish line thousands of
kilometers beneath the depths.

These companies' pursuit of precious metals plays out in one of the
worst-understood environments on Earth. Humans have only mapped 0.05
percent of the ocean floor, compared to 60 percent of the surface of
Mars. [Researchers are discovering new species at a rapid rate on the
dark, heavily pressurized seabed.]{.underline} A seafloor survey
conducted by the University of Hawaii in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone
(CCZ), the same 4.5 million square kilometer area of the Pacific where
DEPreME launched the Patania II, discovered 154 worm species
alone---seventy percent of which were previously unknown to science.
[[The effects of mining this region of **unknown terrain** and
incalculable **biodiversity** could be **massive**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
A study from the Queen Mary University of London indicated that
crippling the microbial biodiversity of the seabed could have
far-ranging effects, [causing species to go extinct on the ocean floor
and initiating ripple effects into the food chain all the way to the
surface]{.underline}. Dr. James Bradley, one of the study's
authors, warned that ["once these ecosystems are damaged, they may
**never fully recover."**]{.underline}

Sea Mining -- Highly Complicated and Widely Unproven -- Doesn't Add Up,"

WASHINGTON, D.C. (2024 February 29)** **-- With the environmental risks
of mining the deep sea already well documented, a new report provides
the most comprehensive assessment to date of the extent to which the
industry is economically viable, [[revealing its]{.mark} unrealistic
financial models, **[tech]{.mark}nological [challenges]{.mark}** and
poor market prospects that gravely undermine its potential for
profit. ]{.underline}

Released as the U.S. government considers engaging in deep-sea mining in
domestic waters and in advance of a much-anticipated meeting of the
International Seabed Authority (March 18-29) --- [the body tasked with
regulating deep-sea mining in the international high seas --- the study
[lays out the risks of investing in an]{.mark} unproven extractive
[industry]{.mark} gearing up to commercially produce a nonrenewable
resource [with]{.mark} unknown and increasingly apparent
[**environmental**, **sociocultural** and **economic**
implications.]{.mark}]{.underline}

["When it comes to deep sea mining, investors should be on high alert
and undertake robust due diligence,"]{.underline} said Bobbi-Jo Dobush
of the Ocean Foundation and one of the authors of the report,[ *[Deep
Seabed Mining Isn't Worth the]{.mark}* **Financial
[Risk]{.mark}***. *"Trying to mine minerals from the ocean floor is an
unproven industrial endeavor fraught with technical, financial, and
regulatory **uncertainty**.]{.underline} More so, the industry faces
strong Indigenous opposition and human rights concerns. [[All of these
factors add up]{.mark} to substantial potential financial and legal
[risks for both **public and private investors."**]{.mark}]{.underline}

One of the most concerning red flags, according to the report, is the
industry's unrealistically optimistic financial models that ignore the
following:

[Major technical difficulties in extraction at unprecedented depths
below the surface.]{.underline} In the fall of 2022, [t[he
first]{.underline}]{.mark} [deep-sea mining ([DSM)]{.mark}]{.underline}
collection trial in international waters, [[done at a **very small
scale**, had **significant** technological
**hitches**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Observers have noted how difficult and
unpredictable it is to operate in the ocean depths.

A volatile minerals market. Frontrunners have built business plans on
the assumption that demand for certain minerals that may be obtainable
in the deep sea will continue to grow. However, metals prices have not
risen in tandem with electric vehicle production: between 2016 and 2023
EV production is up 2,000% and cobalt prices are down 10%. A report
commissioned by the International Seabed Authority (ISA) found that
there is high uncertainty around prices for commercial metals once
contractors begin production, leading to the possibility that relatively
[high-cost minerals from the seabed are not competitive and thus
**generate** little or **no profit.**]{.underline}

[There would be a large upfront operational cost associated with DSM, on
par with highly industrial extractive industries, including oil and
gas.]{.underline} It is unreasonable to assume DSM projects would fare
better than standard industrial projects, [two-thirds of which go over
budget by an **average of 50%.**]{.underline}

["Seabed minerals -- nickel, cobalt, manganese, and copper -- are not "a
battery in a rock" as mining companies claim.]{.underline} Some of these
minerals power last-generation technology for electric vehicle batteries
but car [makers are already finding better and **safer ways to power
batteries,**]{.underline}" said Maddie Warner of The Ocean Foundation
and one of the report's lead authors. "Soon, innovations in battery
power will likely sink demand for seabed minerals."

[Potential costs and liabilities are exacerbated by known and unknown
threats in all aspects of DSM, making a return on investment uncertain.
These threats include:]{.underline}

Incomplete regulations at the national and international levels that, in
their current draft form, anticipate robust costs and extreme
liabilities. [These include significant upfront financial
guarantees/bonds, mandatory insurance requirements, strict liability for
companies, and extremely long-term monitoring requirements.]{.underline}

Reputational concerns associated with front-running DSM companies.
[Early-stage startups have not factored risk or **actual damages** from
environmental spills or protests into their business plans, giving
potential investors and decision-makers an **incomplete
picture**.]{.underline} For example, when The Metals Company (TMC) was
first listed on the U.S. stock exchange, civil society argued that its
original filing did not sufficiently disclose risks; the Securities
Exchange Commission agreed and required TMC to file an update.

[Ambiguity around who will pay for the cost]{.underline} [of damage to
ocean ecosystems.  ]{.underline}

Misleading comparisons to terrestrial mining and overstated
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) claims.

Compounding all of these risks is the mounting international pressure to
halt deep-sea mining. [Currently, [**24 countries** have called for a
**ban**,]{.mark} moratorium, or precautionary pause on the
industry.]{.underline}

Increasingly, banks, financial institutions and insurers have also cast
doubt on the industry's viability. In July 2023, 37 financial
institutions urged governments to pause deep seabed mining until the
environmental, sociocultural, and economic risks are understood and
alternatives to deep sea minerals have been explored.

"Significant challenges must be overcome before DSM can be recognized as
economically viable or as a responsible industry that can make a
positive economic contribution to society," the statement says. Banks
worldwide including Lloyds, NatWest, Standard Chartered, ABN Amro, and
BBVA have also shunned the industry.

[[Additionally, **39 companies** signed pledges **not to invest in
DSM**, **not allow mined minerals to enter their supply chains** and not
source minerals from the deep sea]{.mark}.]{.underline} These companies
include Google, Samsung, Philips, Patagonia, BMW, Rivian, Volkswagen and
Salesforce.

[A further key factor in initiating research on the possibility of
deep-sea mining was the [prediction of global mineral shortages]{.mark}
based on forecasts by the Club of Rome]{.underline} (Meadows et al.
1972) (cf. Moore and Cruickshank 1973; Meiser and MuÈller, 1973; Lenoble
1996a). [In fact, these forecasts [turned out to be erroneous]{.mark}
[because they]{.mark} assumed ®xed reserves of minerals on land and
[failed to take into account the fact that depletion of these reserves
would lead to higher mineral prices which would, in turn, stimulate
exploration and encourage recycling]{.mark} (cf. Wang
1997).]{.underline} **[[Other factors which would tend to depress metal
prices include the trend to mining lower- grade deposits based on
improvements in mineral processing technology over last decade,
increased competition, and the role of new materials in suppressing the
demand for metals]{.underline}]{.mark}** (cf. Liu et al. 1996; Silver
2001[). The [possibility of]{.mark} [d]{.mark}eep-[s]{.mark}ea
[m]{.mark}ining [was]{.mark} therefore [based on the false premise that
rising mineral prices would ensure its future profitability]{.mark} and
was therefore deeply flawed from the outset.]{.underline} Furthermore,
the economic feasibility of deep-sea mining was based on the assumption
of very high capital investment and an enormous throughput of nodules
(Medford 1969). In spite of these limitations, the spirit of the time
was optimistic (Rothstein and Kaufman 1974).

**[Among [policy-makers and business leaders]{.mark}, the conversation
is exceedingly optimistic]{.underline}**. The Arctic is an "ocean of
opportunities," proclaims one video on the state website Arctic Russia
(2025). An article on that same website touts Russia's "ownership" of
over a fifth of the world's continental shelfs, mostly in the Arctic,
where it claims a quarter of the globe's oil and gas deposits are
located, giving Russia some 25 per cent of the Arctic's oil and 70 per
cent of its natural gas. While the Barents and Kara seas are the main
locations for these deposits, the article goes on to highlight the
massive potential in eastern waters, drawing attention, for instance, to
the Chukchi Sea, where over 1 billion tonnes of fossil fuels might be
found -- "ten times more," the article continues, than what Russia is
currently extracting (Arctic Russia 2020). **[[State-owned enterprises
are]{.mark} also vocally [optimistic]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}
Over half the world's oil and gas is in the Arctic Ocean, observes an
article from the state gas company, GazProm. Almost half of Russia's
resources are in the Barents Sea, and over a third in the Kara Sea.
Again, other swaths of Arctic Ocean under Russian 13 Alexander Dalziel
\| June 2025 jurisdiction hold immense promise: there are some "8,700
million tons" of fossil fuels in the Laptev Sea, and over a billion
tonnes in the Chukchi and East Siberian seas. The oceans are the future,
according to the article, citing unnamed analysts who contend that the
rest of the world's "giant deposits" will only be found there (Neftegaz
2025). **[[These numb]{.mark}ers are not inconsistent with the science,
but they [focus]{.mark} more [on potential than realizable

Technology Challenges

The technology for deep sea operations, involves using remote-controlled
robots which cut ore from seafloor, or scoop up sediments, and feed the
ore into a sea-floor pump which then raises the slurry to a surface ship
or platform.

[[**Machinery** needs to operate at]{.mark} very **[high
pressures]{.mark}** and [in **extreme**]{.mark}**s** of both heat and
**[cold]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The technology is expensive for
deep-water operations and is yet to be proved commercially. [[This is
**unlikely** to occur]{.underline}]{.mark} while there is still an
adequate supply of the target metals in land-based mines.

Governmental Challenges

Most of the world's oceans are not governed by a country. Outside of
territorial waters and economic zones the laws of the high seas,
applies. Until recently, these have been silent on the topic of
exploration and mining licences.

The International Seabed Authority, setup by the UN, is now considering
the issuing of the first international waters exploration and mining
licenses.

Conservational Issues

Conservation concerns are significant from not just traditional
conservationist groups but also scientists and the fishing industry.
[[The deep ocean is very **poorly studied**]{.underline}]{.mark}, new
species of fish are still regularly discovered, and little is understood
of the eco-systems around sub-sea hydrothermal vents. Indeed the vents
themselves were only confirmed about 30 years ago.

Similarly, scientific and prospecting expeditions have found notable
**[deposits of minerals on the Arctic Ocean seabed]{.underline}**. Some
are further out in the Arctic Ocean, beyond the continental shelf. The
Gakkel Ridge, for instance, has indications of high-concentration
deposits of zinc, iron, and copper, as well as critical minerals like
cobalt, scandium, lithium, and vanadium, among others (Hein et al.
2013). On the Lomonosov Ridge, research expeditions have found
indications of oil and gas deposits (Moore et al. 2011). **[The average
depths of the Lomonosov Ridge -- around 1,000 metres -- would permit
shallower water exploitation]{.underline}** (Geological Survey of

#### DSM fails at a small scale, it's bound to fail in the Arctic.

Degree from the University of Oxford. (Chris, 3-7-2025, "Deep-sea mining
tech advances but doubts remain," BBC,

[Such a [system is **not likely** to convince]{.mark} everyone [that
deep-sea mining is a good idea]{.mark},]{.underline} however.

[\"[**Mining** would]{.mark} by its nature **[remove]{.mark}** the very
substrate of **[life]{.mark}** in and on the deep seafloor, [**no
matter** the tech]{.mark}nology,]{.underline}\" says Jessica Battle, who
leads the global no deep-seabed mining initiative at the WWF.

Deep-sea mining is highly controversial partly because the deep seabed
is more or less untouched and [still relatively **poorly understood**.
\"If you\'re not sure what\'s down there, then leave it
alone,\"]{.underline} says John Childs at Lancaster University.
\"That\'s been the widespread position from science \[to date\].\"

[[**Scars** left by]{.mark} mining experiments in the [past]{.mark},
using older, highly **[disruptive tech]{.mark}**nologies, [have been
**severe**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In 1979, deep-sea mining equipment made large tracks in one part of the
Pacific Ocean seabed and these remain there today, researchers say.
Wildlife has reportedly still not fully returned to the area 40 years
later.

[Opposition to deep-sea mining has been fierce enough to scupper entire
companies.]{.underline}

Nautilus Minerals sought to begin deep-sea mining work in the late
2010s. After protests and financial upsets, the company went bankrupt in
2019.

Minerals found on the deep seabed including manganese, nickel, cobalt,
gold and silver are all considered important materials for the green
energy transition.

Currently, such metals are sourced from mines on land, which themselves
have a significant environmental impact.

No commercial deep sea mining operations are underway today, though that
could change this year if the first set of international regulations
governing these activities is published, possibly in July.

Mr Gunasekara\'s firm is currently building a larger version of its
robot in a 20-foot shipping container, big enough to carry out
commercial-scale operations. It will have 12 robot arms with grabbing
claws.

[He adds that \"[**hundreds**\" of]{.mark} such [bots would need to
**harvest**]{.mark} the seabed at a time, bringing the spoils to a ship
on the surface. The recovered nodules would then be transported to
**processing sites** on land.]{.underline}

#### DSM in the arctic is notoriously difficult

Opportunities, Challenges, and Environmental Considerations,\"
AZoMining, https://www.azomining.com/Article.aspx?ArticleID=1827

**[Firstly, [the Arctic landscape is notoriously difficult to
explore]{.mark}]{.underline}**, with many remote and largely
inaccessible regions presenting huge logistical and technical challenges
for mining companies. [[Permanent ice sheets make reaching these areas
extraordinarily difficult]{.mark}, for instance.
Additionally,]{.underline} [[extracting and sending the resources back
to areas where they can be used requires vast infrastructure, such as
ports, roads, rail networks, communication networks, the mines
themselves, and permanent housing for miners and other workers within
the mining industry]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Mining companies also need
to address huge regulatory, legal, and environmental challenges to make
large-scale mining operations in the Arctic
feasible.]{.underline}]{.mark} Many observers, such as Greenpeace and
the WWF, are concerned about the impact of mining on fragile and largely
unspoiled ecosystems. Regional and geopolitical tensions concerning the
Arctic also persist, causing further challenges. The Arctic is largely
controlled by a handful of nations, with resources largely present
within national borders[. Companies should be mindful of these
geopolitical tensions and the needs of Indigenous communities that rely
on local resources and biodiversity to support themselves.]{.underline}
In short, if large-scale mining of the critical resources contained in
the Arctic is to be successful, companies need to consider a plethora of
technical, socioeconomic, environmental, ethical, and sociopolitical
issues and challenges.

#### Deep-sea mining is not viable nor necessary for energy transition

analysts at the Frontier Group, ("We don't need deep-sea mining: How we

[[Transitioning to renewable energy will]{.mark} almost [certainly
require increases in]{.mark} the production of many so-called [critical
minerals.]{.mark} There is, however, tremendous uncertainty about how
much and how quickly that production will need to expand,]{.underline}
with forecasts of growth in demand for some critical minerals varying by
an order of magnitude or more.

[There is [widespread agreement]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, [[that
d]{.underline}]{.mark}eep-[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}ea
[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}ining [[is not necessary to meet demand for
critical minerals.]{.underline}]{.mark} The commencement of deep-sea
mining would not eliminate the threat of terrestrial mining. And, as
will be discussed later in this report, [common-sense measures to create
a [circular economy]{.mark}, including [in energy transition minerals,
can reduce the need for all forms of extraction]{.mark}]{.underline} --
including deep-sea mining -- in the years and decades to come.

Critical minerals are necessary for the energy transition

The United States and the world must achieve swift and deep reductions
in emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to prevent the
worst impacts of global warming. Low-carbon energy technologies -- from
electric vehicles to solar panels to wind turbines -- can help us to
break free from our dependence on extracting and burning fossil fuels,
which harms the health of people, wildlife and ecosystems around the
globe.

No energy technology is without environmental impacts, however, and the
transition to renewable energy is expected to bring with it an increase
in demand for the critical minerals that are essential to making those
technologies work. Extracting and supplying those minerals also has the
potential to harm people and ecosystems around the world.

Why are radical new forms of resource extraction such as deep-sea mining
being proposed to meet demand for critical minerals? Answering that
question begins with understanding what critical minerals are and the
role they play in the energy transition.

What are "critical minerals"?

Critical minerals for energy are those that, as defined by federal law,
have "high risk for supply chain disruption" and "\[serve\] an essential
function in one or more energy technologies."118 In the context of the
clean energy transition, critical minerals are those that are required
in technologies that substitute for fossil fuel production and use --
such as wind turbines, solar panels, electric vehicles, hydrogen
electrolyzers and other technologies -- as well as the infrastructure
needed to support their integration into the energy system.

The following are generally considered to be "critical minerals" for the
energy transition:

• Lithium, cobalt and nickel for electric vehicle batteries and energy
storage.

• Copper for a variety of clean energy technologies and, with aluminum,
for electricity transmission and distribution infrastructure.

• Manganese used in lithium-ion batteries.119

• Rare earth elements (such as neodymium and dysprosium) for the magnets
used in wind turbines and electric motors.

• Graphite for electric vehicle batteries and energy storage.120

Other minerals are important for specific technologies that may or may
not have a significant role in the clean energy transition. Platinum,
for example, is a key component of many hydrogen fuel cells and
electrolyzers,121 while metals such as indium and gallium are important
for thin-film photovoltaics,122 which have a small share of the overall
solar photovoltaic (PV) market today but may become more prominent in
the years to come.

In this report, we focus on five types of critical minerals copper,
cobalt, lithium, nickel and rare earth elements (specifically, neodymium
and dysprosium). These are metals that are believed to be essential to
the clean energy transition, face potential supply shortages, and are
discussed as potential targets for deep-sea mining.

Demand for critical minerals is expected to grow, but forecasts vary
widely

The widespread adoption of clean energy technologies will lead to
significant -- and, in some cases, dramatic -- increases in the demand
for some critical minerals. However, forecasts of the extent of that
demand growth vary widely.

A 2023 meta-analysis by the International Energy Forum and the Payne
Institute of Public Policy at the Colorado School of Mines illustrated
the great variance in forecasts of future critical minerals demand:

• Forecasts of cobalt demand for energy transition technologies in 2040
varied from 58% to 725% of 2022 global demand, with the highest and
lowest estimates differing by a factor of 12.5.

• Lithium demand forecasts for clean energy varied from 254% of 2022
demand to more than 1,000%, a factor of about four.

• Copper demand forecasts for 2040 varied from approximately 25% to 100%
of 2022 demand, a factor of approximately four.

• Nickel demand forecasts varied from 33% of 2022 demand to 154%, nearly
a factor of five.123 (See Figure 2, next page.)

[[Why do forecasts]{.underline}]{.mark} of critical mineral needs
[[vary]{.mark} so greatly? In addition to the normal uncertainty present
in any predictions of the future, two other key factors
are:]{.underline}

• [[Uncertainty about the future energy mix]{.underline}]{.mark} --
There are many potential paths to a zero-carbon energy system. For
example, a transition more reliant on wind energy -- and particularly
offshore wind -- could require greater supplies of rare earth elements
compared with a transition that is more reliant on solar energy and
battery storage, which may require greater supplies of metals like
copper, cobalt and nickel.

[• [Uncertainty about material needs of specific
technologies]{.mark}]{.underline} -- In addition to the numerous
pathways to a clean energy future, there are multiple variations of
specific technologies such as batteries or solar panels, with
significant implications for future materials demand. For example, until
recently, most electric vehicle (EV) batteries required the use of large
amounts of nickel and cobalt. Battery manufacturers have already taken
steps to significantly reduce the amount of cobalt used in batteries,125
and other battery designs now entering widespread use eliminate the need
for both nickel and cobalt.126 Still other emerging designs also
eliminate the need for lithium.127 The speed and extent to which these
newer, less critical mineral-intensive technologies emerge is highly
uncertain. Nevertheless, several major global automakers, including BMW,
Volvo, Volkswagen, Renault and Rivian, support calls for a moratorium on
deep-sea mining.128

Table 1 above shows the median forecast of annual energy transition
critical minerals demand for 2035 from the International Energy
Forum/Payne Institute literature review referenced above (with the
exception of dysprosium, see endnote), compared with global reserves and
resources of those minerals.130 In sum, demand for many critical
minerals will increase in the years to come as the world shifts from
relying on fossil fuels to harnessing our tremendous potential for
renewable energy. How much the demand for specific critical minerals
will increase depends on technological developments and market forces --
as well as the degree to which economies can manage to limit the growth
in demand for critical resources while continuing to advance the clean
energy transition.

[Deep-sea mining is a potential source of some, but not all, critical
minerals]{.underline}

[[Some minerals]{.mark}]{.underline} -- such as copper, nickel and
cobalt -- [[are]{.mark} potentially available [in great abundance in
seabed]{.mark} deposits. [Others]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as lithium
and rare earth elements, [[are]{.mark} also present]{.underline} in
deep-sea mineral deposits, [but]{.underline} in [[more
limited]{.underline}]{.mark} concentrations or only in specific
locations. Still [[other minerals critical to the energy transition are
not available at all in the deep sea]{.mark}. Even for some
[minerals]{.mark} that are [present in large
volumes]{.mark}]{.underline} in seabed deposits, such as manganese,
copper and nickel, [d]{.underline}eep-[s]{.underline}ea
[m]{.underline}ining [is [unlikely to be a critical source]{.mark} of
material for the clean energy transition given the large existing demand
for those minerals in other sectors of the economy.]{.underline}

Is deep-sea mining necessary for the clean energy transition?

[The mere presence of critical minerals on the ocean floor -- even in
large volumes -- does not mean that exploiting those deposits is
necessary to advance the clean energy transition. For]{.underline}
[d]{.underline}eep-[s]{.underline}ea [m]{.underline}ining [to be
essential, the resources available on the seafloor would need to be
significant in]{.underline} the context of [future global demand for
those materials]{.underline} and [production would need to be able to
ramp up quickly enough to close global supply gaps that may emerge in
the next decade, when options for expanding terrestrial
mining]{.underline} or reducing critical minerals demand through
technological advances or circular economy strategies [are
limited]{.underline}.

[The only two metals for which d]{.underline}eep-[s]{.underline}ea
[m]{.underline}ining [is capable of making a significant
dent]{.underline} in the market [are cobalt and nickel]{.underline} --
[two metals for which long-term demand is the most uncertain and
"sufficient supply \[is\] expected to serve short-term demand" according
to the International Energy Agency.]{.underline}134

Some critical minerals are available in only limited volumes on the
seabed

Deep-sea mining is promoted as a solution to the critical minerals
challenge, yet only some critical minerals are present in abundance on
the seabed, while others are present only in more limited quantities, or
in specific areas of the ocean.

Cobalt, copper and nickel supplies, as noted above, are present in
abundance in seafloor nodule deposits in the CCZ and elsewhere. The
European Academies Science Advisory Council anticipates that cobalt,
copper and nickel, along with manganese, are likely to be the economic
targets for mining of nodules and ferromanganese crusts, while copper,
along with zinc, silver and gold, will be the economic targets of
hydrothermal sulfide mining.136

Other critical minerals, however, are available in only more limited
volumes:

• Lithium can be present in seafloor crusts and nodules, but is not
generally considered a target of deep-sea mining.137 A study produced
for the International Seabed Authority estimates that nodules in the CCZ
possess less than one-fifth the amount of lithium as is present in
current global land-based reserves.138 According to an Environmental
Justice Foundation report, "lithium is not currently targeted by the
\[deep-sea mining\] industry and, at trace levels, is not viable for
extraction from polymetallic nodules."139 Norway estimates that lithium
resources on the seafloor in its territorial waters equate to only about
1% of global land-based reserves.140

• Rare earth elements are present in varying amounts in various seabed
environments. Nodules in the CCZ contain an amount of rare earth
elements that is only a fraction of the world's land-based reserves.141
Rare earths in the Prime Crust Zone in the central Pacific Ocean
represent a similar share of global land-based reserves.142 While
concentrations of rare earth elements in seafloor deposits are low, some
deposits are particularly rich in "heavy" rare earth elements (such as
dysprosium) that are potentially of greater economic value.143

How important is energy as a share of overall mineral demand?

While the renewable energy transition will likely require significant
quantities of manganese and copper, seabed mining is unlikely to have a
significant impact on the global supply picture for copper and is not
likely to be needed to satisfy manganese demand for the energy
transition.

• Copper -- Seabed mining is unlikely to have a major impact on the
global supply of copper in the near- to mid-term. A study conducted for
the International Seabed Authority estimates that, even with rapid
deployment of deep-sea mining in the CCZ, it could only supply a maximum
of the equivalent of 2% of current land-based production by 2035.144

• Manganese -- Similarly, while the energy transition will likely
require an increase in manganese use,145 existing and planned land-based
resources are forecast to meet demand in the near-term in all but the
highest demand cases.146 Other uses, not energy transition uses, would
likely drive any deep-sea mining for manganese. For example, The Metals
Company, which has proposed to begin mining for nodules in the CCZ, has
indicated that it wants the manganese for steel production.147

[While d]{.underline}eep-[s]{.underline}ea [m]{.underline}ining [does
have]{.underline} the [potential to produce copper and]{.underline}
especially [manganese, it will not produce enough of the former to make
a dent in global markets, and the latter is not likely to be in
especially short supply.]{.underline} Moreover, the widespread use of
copper and manganese throughout the economy provides an abundance of
opportunities to manage potential increases in demand resulting from the
energy transition.

In sum, [[from]{.underline}]{.mark} the perspective [of the [clean
energy transition]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[nickel and cobalt
are]{.underline}]{.mark} the metals that [are [likely to be economic
targets]{.underline}]{.mark} [of d]{.underline}eep-[s]{.underline}ea
[m]{.underline}ining, [[but]{.mark} are [not at great risk of short-term
supply disruption]{.mark}]{.underline}; and new [[nickel- and
cobalt-free EV battery designs are]{.underline}]{.mark} rapidly gaining
market share, potentially [[reducing]{.mark} the [importance]{.mark} of
those metals [for the energy transition]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
[R]{.underline}]{.mark}are [[e]{.mark}a]{.underline}rth
[[e]{.underline}]{.mark}lement[[s]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and

energy transition, [[are unlikely to be produced in great abundance from
seafloor mining]{.underline}. [Copper and manganese may
be]{.underline}]{.mark} [economic [targets]{.mark}]{.underline} for
deep-sea mining, [[but deep-sea extraction]{.underline}]{.mark} of those
[metals [is not likely to be essential to meet the needs of the energy
transition.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Analysis]{.mark}]{.underline} produced [[for]{.mark} the
[I]{.mark}]{.underline}nternational [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}eabed
[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}uthority and published [[in 2022

likely to [[experience supply shortages toward]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[end of]{.mark} the [2020s]{.mark}]{.underline}, and in both cases, a
[[rapid]{.mark} ramp-up of [nodule harvesting from the deep sea could
meaningfully reduce those shortages.]{.mark}]{.underline}151 [[More
recent analysis]{.mark}, however, [suggests]{.mark} that [neither cobalt
nor nickel are likely to be at risk]{.mark}]{.underline} for short-term
supply disruption.152 [Other]{.underline} observers [question the
ability of d]{.underline}eep-[s]{.underline}ea [m]{.underline}ining [to
make a meaningful contribution to short-term supply
challenges]{.underline}. The [[Energy Transitions Commission concluded
in 2023]{.underline}]{.mark} that "[[initial production
amounts]{.underline}]{.mark} \[from deep-sea mining\] are
[[likely]{.mark} to be [low and not able to significantly close supply
gaps]{.mark}]{.underline} that might emerge by the late 2020s."153 The
assumption that deep-sea mining can come online quickly enough to
address any shortages is open to question.

The [[report]{.underline}]{.mark} produced [[for]{.mark} the
[ISA]{.mark},]{.underline} and cited earlier, [[bases its conclusions on
the assumption that seabed mining production would begin in 2027.
However, there is no guarantee that seabed mining can or will scale up
that quickly]{.underline}.]{.mark} The Metals Company, which hopes to
receive permission to mine nodules in the CCZ, has stated that "we
expect to be in production in the fourth quarter of 2025 if the
application \[to the ISA\] is approved."154 While, as of early 2024, the
ISA was targeting 2025 for the adoption of regulations on seabed mining,
some [[analysts argue]{.mark} that the [number of outstanding regulatory
issues to be resolved makes such a timeline
unrealistic.]{.mark}155]{.underline}

[Meanwhile, [markets for several critical minerals -- including nickel
and cobalt -- were no longer showing signs of shortage as of
mid-2024]{.mark},]{.underline} instead surging into surplus, sending
prices for those materials tumbling.

During 2023 alone, [[cobalt prices fell by an estimated
25%,]{.underline} [nickel]{.underline}]{.mark} prices [[by 45% and
lithium carbonate]{.underline}]{.mark} prices [[by
70%]{.mark}.]{.underline}157 Nickel production has increased,158 leading
some analysts to forecast a surplus of nickel through at least 2028.159
Nickel producers have also expanded their capacity to process low-grade
nickel ore typically used in stainless steel to the higher-purity metal
required for EV batteries, adding additional flexibility to nickel
supplies.160

Cobalt markets -- which experienced greater demand than supply as

**[The [Trump]{.mark} administration [plans to fast-track permits for
deep-sea mining]{.mark}]{.underline}**, despite pushback from
conservation groups that warn that too little is known about delicate
ecosystems deep underwater.

[**[The Interior Department]{.mark} on Wednesday [announced
that,]{.mark} [starting immediately,]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
[B]{.mark}ureau of [O]{.mark}cean [E]{.mark}nergy [M]{.mark}anagement
[will begin identifying possible areas for]{.mark} [underwater]{.mark}
[exploration]{.mark}** and production of critical minerals, including
nickel, cobalt and lithium.]{.underline}

BOEM, an agency of the Interior Department, is tasked with managing
development of the U.S. Outer Continental Shelf energy, mineral and
geological resources, which includes all submerged lands in coastal
waters that are under U.S. jurisdiction.

Interior announced that BOEM will sidestep formal requests for
information to save months of permitting and offer "favorable lease
terms," including lower minimum bids and waivers for some rental fees.

Some offshore critical mineral projects could be granted shortened
environmental reviews. Once BOEM issues a lease, federal officials plan
to tap into "emergency procedures" that Interior laid out earlier this
year to truncate environmental reviews for some projects, according to
the agency.

[Under those procedures, [environmental]{.mark} [assessment]{.mark} [can
be granted under]{.mark} the **[N]{.mark}ational [E]{.mark}nvironmental
[P]{.mark}olicy [A]{.mark}ct [in just 14 days]{.mark}** and an
environmental impact statement within 28 days]{.underline} --- curbing
processes that previously took a year or longer.

[The move is significant given demand for critical minerals is growing
amid fears among environmental groups that too little is known about
deep-sea mining.. [The]{.mark} Trump [administration]{.mark} [has made
clear]{.mark} **[it intends to move forward with plumbing the deep
seas]{.mark}** as part of the president's focus on boosting domestic

The Mineral Supply Chain Claim [Deep-sea mining proponents argue that
the rare earth elements and critical minerals necessary for the energy
transition (i.e., solar panels and electric vehicle (EV) batteries) are
scarce, and so we need to exploit all possible sources6. Some
governments have embraced this, either through securing exploration
contracts on the international seabed (three governments, and 11
state-owned enterprises), sponsoring private contractors (e.g., Jamaica,
Nauru, Tonga), opposing a moratorium (e.g., China),]{.underline}
pursuing deep-sea mining domestically (e.g., Norway), or even
considering international seabed mining unilaterally (i.e., the US). In
theory, the argument goes, increasing supply from deep-sea deposits will
lower raw material prices, thereby facilitating the transition to
cleaner technologies. Moreover, this logic suggests diversifying supply
will prevent monopolistic control by a subset of countries, thus
maintaining competitive pressures and preventing strategic bottlenecks
that could slow the energy transition. We show that these claims do not
hold up. It is important to clarify which resources proponents claim are
scarce. Rare earth elements are critical to renewable energy
technologies, but they are not currently the focus of most deep-sea
mining exploration efforts, which so far target polymetallic nodules
containing cobalt, copper, manganese, molybdenum, and nickel. [[Although
they are called "rare," the critical resources that comprise rare earth
elements are abundant and can be mined on land in many
countries.]{.underline}]{.mark} In 2023, world production of rare earth
elements was 300,000 tonnes per year compared to known reserves of 130
million tonnes8. Production in 2022 was concentrated in China (70%),
followed by the United States (14%), Australia (6%), and Myanmar (4%).
[However, [reserves are more widely distributed than current production
suggests]{.mark} (see Table 1), [and could meet even high projections of
a doubling or quadrupling of rare earth element demand by
2040]{.mark}]{.underline}. While rare earths are not the current focus
of exploration efforts in the deep sea, they may be in the future.
[[Terrestrial reserves of the metals and minerals that are currently
targeted for seabed mining are already extensive]{.mark}, notably
cobalt, copper, manganese, molybdenum, and nickel (see Table
2).]{.underline} Projections of demand for these metals and minerals
varies widely, and prices are volatile due to a combination of
protectionist trade measures, contentious geopolitics, and market
manipulation10. A series of political and market dynamics have affected
nickel and rare earth elements, for instance11. [[Technological advances
in the efficiency of batteries, as well as the development of
alternatives (e.g., sodium-ion batteries), could further shift demand
forecasts for a series of metal and mineral inputs]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[Even a cursory sketch of production and reserves shows that [there is
no shortage of inputs for renewable technologies]{.mark}. These are
hollow arguments that misrepresent the economics of terrestrial mineral
commodities---and underplay the economics of deep-sea mining. The data
demonstrates that even if deep sea reserves are large, there is no
pressing need for the increase in supply that deep-sea mining might one
day contribute to an energy transition.]{.underline} Deep-sea mining is
too speculative, slow, expensive, and unproven to alter mineral supply
chain economics, and barring major technological breakthroughs, which do
not appear to be forthcoming, these economic constraints will persist
for the foreseeable future. Estimates of the cost of deep-sea mining are
not available, but there is no evidence to suggest it will be
cost-competitive with terrestrial mining given such remote, and deep,
operations. [[Existing mineral reserves, stronger recycling regulations,
further terrestrial exploration (if necessary), and ongoing
technological advances are all more than sufficient to meet future
mineral and metal demand.]{.underline}]{.mark} Despite its lack of
market potential, there is strong pressure for deep-sea mining.
State-owned enterprises and state agencies have undertaken much of the
exploration to date, although the high-profile public pressure comes
from small seabed mining start-ups, such as TMC. These small companies
are backed by major infrastructure firms and institutional investors
(e.g., Loke Marine Minerals, Blackrock Inc., and The Vanguard Group,
among others.) [[The current value in deep-sea mining may not be the
minerals themselves, but the gains from speculation and rent-seeking as
stocks rise and fall]{.mark}, assets are transferred, and companies go
bankrupt and are reinvented13,14.]{.underline} Moreover, states and
state-owned enterprises with exploration contracts in the international
seabed may be more willing to accept market inefficiencies to advance
state interests15. [Market forces alone will not prevent the worst
impacts of deep-sea mining, which is why a ban is needed]{.underline}.

It seemed to me that most, if not all, of the problems from scaling up
solar and wind energies could be solved through more technological
innovation. But, as the years went by, the problems persisted and in
some cases grew worse. For example, [California is a world leader [when
it comes to renewables]{.mark} but we haven't converted our dams into
batteries, partly for geographic reasons. [You need the right kind
of]{.mark} dam and [reservoirs]{.mark}, and [even then it's]{.mark} an
[expensive]{.mark} retrofit.]{.underline} A bigger problem is that
[there are many other uses for the water that accumulates behind dams,
namely irrigation [and]{.mark} cities. And because [the]{.mark}
[water]{.mark} in our rivers and reservoirs [is]{.mark} [scarce and
unreliable]{.mark},]{.underline} the water from dams for those other
purposes is becoming ever-more precious. [[Without large-scale ways to
back-up solar energy]{.mark} California [has]{.mark} had [to block
electricity]{.mark} coming [from solar farms when it's]{.mark} extremely
[sunny]{.mark}, [or]{.mark} [pay neighboring states to take it]{.mark}
from us [so]{.mark} [we]{.mark} can [avoid blowing-out our
grid]{.mark}]{.underline}. Despite what you've heard, there is no
"battery revolution" on the way, for well-understood technical and
economic reasons. As for house cats, they don't kill big, rare,
threatened birds. What house cats kill are small, common birds, like
sparrows, robins and jays. [What kills]{.underline} big, threatened, and
[endangered birds]{.underline}---birds that could go extinct---like
hawks, eagles, owls, and condors, [are wind turbines]{.underline}. [In
fact, [wind turbines]{.mark} [are]{.mark} the most serious new
[threat]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [important]{.mark} [bird species]{.mark} to
emerge in decades.]{.underline} The rapidly spinning turbines act like
an apex predator which big birds never evolved to deal with.
[[Solar]{.mark} [farms]{.mark} have similarly large ecological
impacts]{.underline}. Building a solar farm is a lot like building any
other kind of farm. You [[have]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [clear]{.mark} the
whole [area of wildlife]{.mark}]{.underline}. In order to build one of
the biggest solar farms in California the developers hired biologists to
[pull threatened desert tortoises from their burrows]{.underline}, put
them on the back of pickup trucks, [transport them, and cage them in
pens]{.underline} where many [ended up dying]{.underline}. As we were
learning of these impacts, it gradually dawned on me that there was [[no
amount of]{.mark} technological [innovation]{.mark} that [could solve
the fundamental problem with]{.mark} [renewables]{.mark}. [You can make
solar panels cheaper and wind turbines bigger, but you can't make the
sun shine more regularly or the wind blow more
reliab]{.mark}ly]{.underline}. I came to understand the environmental
implications of the physics of energy. [In order [to]{.mark}
[produce]{.mark} [significant]{.mark} amounts of [electricity]{.mark}
from weak energy flows, [you]{.mark} just [have to spread]{.mark} them
[over enormous areas]{.mark}. In other words, the trouble with
renewables isn't fundamentally technical---it's natural. [Dealing with
energy sources that are]{.mark} inherently [unreliable]{.mark}, and
[require]{.mark} large amounts of [land]{.mark}, [come]{.mark}s
[at]{.mark} a [high]{.mark} economic [cost]{.mark}.]{.underline} There's
been a lot of publicity about how solar panels and wind turbines have
come down in cost. But those one-time cost savings from making them in
big Chinese factories have been outweighed by the high cost of dealing
with their unreliability. Consider California. Between 2011--17 the cost
of solar panels declined about 75 percent, and yet our electricity
prices rose five times more than they did in the rest of the U.S. It's
the same story in Germany, the world leader in solar and wind energy.
Its electricity prices increased 50 percent between 2006--17, as it
scaled up renewables.

#### Too expensive for developing nations 

**NO AUTHOR 23** "The Clean Energy Paradox: It's Too Expensive for
Developing Nations!"
<https://www.boldbusiness.com/energy/clean-energy-paradox-its-too-expensive-developing-nations/>

Slowly but surely, the shift to renewable energies is occurring at a
global level. In fact, this year will be the first where investments in
solar power will exceed those in oil. Throughout the world, countries
are leveraging technological advancements to address pressure concerns
over climate change. But when it comes to these investments, access to
funding is anything but equitable. [[Developing nations]{.mark},
[particularly]{.mark} those in [regions like Africa]{.mark},
[face]{.mark} the most notable **[barriers to clean energy
transition]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This is because [**[support]{.mark}
for renewable energy** in developing countries [is]{.mark} **extremely
[limited]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Despite being home to more than a
billion people, opportunities to utilize green energy remains scarce.

The irony of all this is inescapable. Within Africa, the vast majority
of its inhabitants lack adequate access to electricity, and those that
do use diesel-powered generators, which must be transported over
significant distances from regional ports. As such, the costs involved
are substantial, which is why millions cannot afford energy access, and
the resultant energy produced is certainly not environmentally friendly
or sustainable. Renewable energy in developing countries is something
that is desperately needed for several reasons, and in order to
accomplish this, financing barriers to clean energy transition must be
better addressed.

The Energy Crisis of Developing Countries

According to global data estimates, there are [[152 nations]{.mark} that
[qualify as developing]{.mark}]{.underline} rather than developed.
[Their [population]{.mark} approaches nearly seven billion in total,
which represents **[85% of people in the world]{.mark}**
today]{.underline}. Despite this, these nations receive less than 5% of
the investments targeting renewable energy. In countries like the
Democratic Republic of the Congo, home to 100 million people, [[over 70%
have no]{.mark} [electricity]{.mark} at all. And [those that do use
less-than-desirable energy sources]{.mark}]{.underline} as far as the
climate is concerned. In essence, options for renewable energy in
developing countries are almost non-existent[. [Too]{.mark}
[many]{.mark} [barriers to clean energy transition]{.mark}
exist]{.underline} presently for this to be a reality.

Notably, this is worrisome not only from a regional perspective but also
from a global one. Based on the current situation, over [[**75%** of
all]{.mark} carbon dioxide **[emissions]{.mark}** [will come from these
countries by 2050]{.mark}.]{.underline} While [developed nations
are]{.underline} [rapidly advancing in green energy alternatives,
barriers to clean energy transition in developing countries prevent
this]{.underline}. Infrastructures are certainly lacking in some
instances. But the bigger [[problem]{.underline}]{.mark} in relation to
renewable energy in developing countries [[is
funding]{.mark}.]{.underline} Investments to acquire the needed
[[tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline} [[are]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[difficult to acquire]{.underline}]{.mark}. This remains the biggest
obstacle for these nations despite the tremendous potential such energy
investments might make.

By far, the [[most significant barrier]{.underline}]{.mark} to clean
energy transition for developing countries [[relates to
risk]{.underline}]{.mark}. In places like the Congo, the [[threat of
violence, protests, and]{.mark} even Ebola [epidemics]{.mark} [concern
investors]{.mark} and lenders.]{.underline} Rather than taking a chance
on a market in need, they tend to take the safer route. Investing or
offering loans within developed nations offers better guarantees. As a
result, those looking to advance renewable energy in developing
countries tend to have limited options. For example, [African
[countries]{.mark} [receive **less than 2%** of]{.mark} all
[investments]{.mark} and funding [for alternative energy
projects]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is despite the continent
experiencing incredible population growth and economies.

While [[renewable generation]{.underline} [has]{.underline}]{.mark}
obvious environmental advantages over fossil fuels for electricity
generation, it does have [an [Achilles heel]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Provided suitable [[fuel is available]{.underline}]{.mark}, coal
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} gas fired power stations are a highly
[[flexible]{.underline}]{.mark} resource. When required they [[can
provide]{.mark} continuous [generation]{.mark} [24 hours]{.mark} [per
day]{.mark}]{.underline}; alternatively, they can be [[kept on
standby]{.mark} [and]{.mark} brought]{.underline} quickly [into use to
provide additional load [on demand]{.mark} as and when
required.]{.underline}

[In contrast, [renewable power]{.mark}]{.underline} plants [**can
[only]{.mark} [generate]{.mark} electricity [when]{.mark} the
[conditions are right]{.mark}**; [solar]{.mark} can only generate
[when]{.mark} the [sun is shining]{.mark}, while wind [turbines]{.mark}
can [only]{.mark} provide power [when]{.mark} the [wind is]{.mark}
[blowing]{.mark} -- and they [can]{.mark} even **have to [be shut down
if wind speeds get too high]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The intermittent
nature of renewable energy sources [creates [reliability
challenges]{.mark}]{.underline} when it comes to managing the available
electricity in the grid, since it's much [[hard]{.mark}er [to
predict]{.mark} the available [load on a given day]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Energy storage]{.underline}, in the form of industrial scale batteries
and other solutions, will eventually largely resolve this issue.
However, in the short term, [[energy]{.mark} storage innovation and
capacity growth **[can't keep up]{.mark} with the pace at which
societies want to increase the use** of renewables]{.underline}. As a
result, [when]{.underline} electricity networks with a high percentage
of [[renewable]{.underline}]{.mark} resource are [[put under]{.mark}
unexpected [pressure]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example as a result of an
extreme weather event, the [system [can struggle to
cope]{.mark}.]{.underline}

We find a useful referee in this war of words with the recently released
Eye on the Market 15th Annual Energy Paper by Michael Cembalest, J. P.
Morgan's chairman of market and investment strategy. As this 70-slide,
deep-dive report pointedly notes, "after \$9 trillion globally over the
last decade spent on wind, solar, electric vehicles, energy storage,
electrified heat and power grids, the renewable transition is still a
linear one; the renewable share of final energy consumption is slowly
advancing at 0.3%--0.6% per year \[emphasis added\]." One does not need
a mathematics degree to understand that such anemic growth rates are not
the hallmarks of an "unstoppable" juggernaut. Hence, Cembalest's bottom
line: "[[Growth in fossil fuel consumption]{.mark} is [slowing but no
clear sign of]{.mark}]{.underline} a peak on a global basis." That is to
say, no "[[energy transition" is in sight]{.mark}.]{.underline}

For the transitionists, this is just proof that we need more spending
and more aggressive mandates. Set aside whether any political appetite
exists for either more such inflationary spending or more intrusive
energy diktats. The fundamental question is whether any energy
transition is even possible---or even whether such has ever happened.

The [[transition narrative]{.underline}]{.mark} is tenacious. Even
Cembalest uses the word 41 times in his report. While the idea of an
energy transition anchors the raison d'être for green and
climate-advocacy groups, it also [[gets bandied about]{.mark} constantly
in popular media, as well as in virtually all the statements from major
energy companies, electric utilities, energy analysts, and investment
banks]{.underline}. Among myriad examples, the week after Trump's
congressional address, The Economist hosted an Energy Transition Summit,
and Reuters holds its Energy Transition North America conference this
fall in Houston.

Underlying the narrative is the implicit---and often
explicit---conviction that the long and now "accelerating" march of
technology means that ancient energy sources, like fossil fuels, are
inevitably being replaced by newer ones. [[We are reminded]{.mark},
constantly, [of]{.mark} analogous [tech transitions]{.mark} such as
landline-to-cellphone or horses-to-cars. [But]{.mark} [such analogies
are]{.mark} [category]{.mark} [errors]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Technological progress more often changes---rather than replaces---how
we access, move, and manipulate materials. [[We still use ancient
materials]{.underline}]{.mark} like wood, stone, concrete, and glass,
and at far greater scale than any time in history. Indeed, the facts
show that [[no energy transition of any kind has ever occurred in
history]{.underline}]{.mark} (with one minor exception, which we'll get
to).

[[Humanity]{.mark} has [use]{.mark}d [the same six]{.mark} primary
[energy sources for millennia]{.mark}]{.underline}. In reductionist
terms, these are: grains, animal fats, wood, water, wind, and fossil
fuels. The world today uses more of all of these categories than ever
before.

Of course, we have seen reductions in the share of energy supplied by
these sources, but that's not what the transitionists mean. To
illustrate the fatuousness of the central idea of an "energy transition"
that eliminates the use of any of these sources, consider some history.

Grains have long fueled the biological "machines" of human civilization,
the various beasts of burden---and, tragically, slave labor---used in
farming, industry, and transportation. Sadly, civilization hasn't even
transitioned away from slavery, not least in the case of African mining,
as documented in the book Cobalt Red. If the Global Slavery Index is
correct, more humans are mired in forced labor now than at any time in
history. Likewise, the world today uses more "working animals" than
ever---some 200 million, fueled by grain.

Even in the U.S., despite far fewer grain-fueled working animals (mainly
in boutique applications like policing or entertainment), the tonnage of
grain used to fuel transportation is now 300 percent greater than during
America's peak horse era. This is the result of the ill-advised 10
percent grain-ethanol mandate for gasoline.

Since ancient times, humans have used the fat from slaughtered animals,
rendered as oils or tallow for illumination, including candle-making.
Today, global biofuels production (biodiesel) is about 1,000 times
greater than two centuries ago. While that production is now dominated
by plant oils (especially soybean and Jatropha), roughly 100 times more
animal fats are used today for fuel as during the peak whale-harvesting
era. Abandoning whale oil is history's one clear exception to the
no-energy-transitions rule.

Whales were saved by advances in chemical science and the invention,
circa 1840, of coal-to-kerosene synthesis (well before the modern oil
era began). As inefficient as this early process was, it meant that one
ton of coal could yield as much oil as harvesting three tons of whales.
This staggeringly more cost-effective chemical process collapsed the
value of harvesting whales.

As for wood, the amount burned for energy today is greater than at any
time in history. Overall, burning wood supplies the world with twice as
much energy as do all the world's solar and wind machines combined. Even
in the U.S., use of wood for fuel is greater now than a century ago. A
wood transition? Not yet.

The use of watermills for industrial grinding of grains dates back to
ancient Greece. It soared during the Middle Ages, when an estimated
500,000 watermills operated in Europe. But that was hardly peak
waterpower. Global hydro dams today produce roughly 500 times more
energy.

Windmills, similarly, didn't peak in the past, though there were, by
most counts, 200,000 of them in the Middle Ages, as well as tens of
thousands of wind-powered vessels, a.k.a. sailing ships, by the
nineteenth century. Global wind turbines harvest at least fifty-fold
more wind energy than at any time in history.

Finally, there are the reviled fossil fuels. Despite the epic expansions
in all of the above itemized fuel sources, the [[fossil fuels supply
over 80 percent of all global needs today]{.underline}]{.mark}. Their
use, however, is hardly new. Archeologists date coal use back to the
Paleolithic era. The ancients also used hydrocarbon tars and pitch for
heat and lighting (and warfighting). But the world obviously uses far
more coal, oil, and natural gas than at any time in history. Indeed, the
world today uses more of every kind of energy deployed since the dawn of
civilization (with the notable exceptions of whale oil).

There's never been an energy transition.

Notably missing from this historical account is the relatively recent
discovery of atomic phenomena: the energy released in splitting an
atom's nucleus (first demonstrated in 1939) and the energy from the
photoelectric effect, using the atom's orbital electrons (first
demonstrated in 1954). Both sources will doubtless see extraordinary
expansion in the coming decades and centuries, but [the [pattern of
**adding to**]{.mark}**,** [rather than **replacing**, other energy
sources will continue]{.mark}]{.underline}. (Though we should hope that
the use of animals, and especially pray that the use of slave labor,
will decline.)

The Trump administration is shining a welcome light on the inflationary,
unproductive, and even socially destructive magnitude of spending in
pursuit of the unachievable that has been marbled into legislation and
federal programs. History will likely record the elimination of
government largesse in pursuit of an impossible energy transition as a
kind of transition itself.

As net-zero targets loom, the race to decarbonize is becoming
increasingly urgent. While renewable energy is key to achieving this,
the [[intermittency of]{.mark} resources such as [wind and solar]{.mark}
has [left power]{.mark} [prices subject to]{.mark} growing
[volatility]{.mark}.]{.underline} Jean-Louis Malon, Head of EU Power
Origination, Natixis CIB, explores how market players can mitigate risk.

[[To remain stable]{.mark} [and avoid]{.mark} disastrous
[black-outs,]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [power market requires]{.mark} a
real-time [balance]{.mark} between supply and demand]{.underline} as
**[[electricity cannot be stored massively]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In
the day-ahead spot market, each hour of the following day is auctioned
and settles at a different price. [Even [a **minor shift** in]{.mark}
[production or consumption]{.mark} can [lead to]{.mark} considerable
[price volatility]{.mark}, and ongoing challenges -- including
[**geopolitical tensions** and regulatory changes]{.mark}]{.underline}
-- have compounded issues in this regard. Perhaps most significant,
however, is the impact of increasing levels of renewable energy on

The combustion of fossil fuels is by far the largest human source of
global greenhouse gas emissions, releasing more than 30 billion tonnes
of CO2 into the atmosphere each year (IPCC 2014). [Reducing fossil fuel
combustion is thus a top priority for climate policy. For decades,
policy-makers and international agreements have sought to achieve this
goal through]{.underline} energy [efficiency]{.underline}, low-carbon
[technology]{.underline}, carbon [pricing, and other
measures]{.underline} aimed at reducing demand for fossil fuels.
[Focusing on the point of combustion makes intuitive sense, but
efforts]{.underline} so far [have yet to put fossil fuel use on a
trajectory consistent with]{.underline} keeping global warming below
[2°C]{.underline}. Recognizing this shortcoming, policy-makers,
researchers and activists have begun to look at the supply side of the
fossil fuel economy --- and the potential for supply-side measures to
complement demand-side climate policies. A key insight driving these new
approaches is that [the political and economic interests and
institutions that underpin fossil fuel production help to perpetuate
fossil fuel use, and even to increase it]{.underline}. From this
emerging vantage point, [continued]{.underline} [[investment in fossil
fuel exploration, extraction, and delivery infrastructure makes global
climate protection objectives **much harder to achieve**]{.underline},
[and should]{.underline}]{.mark} [therefore [be]{.mark}]{.underline}
handled with care and, in many cases, reduced or
[[avoided]{.underline}]{.mark}. The focus on fossil fuels supply in
climate policy has high-profile proponents. U.S. President Obama has
said he would only approve the Keystone XL pipeline, connecting Canadian
oil sands with U.S. refineries and ports, if it "does not significantly
exacerbate the problem of carbon pollution" (The White House 2013). OECD
Secretary General Ángel Gurría has emphasized the challenge posed by
decades of investment in fossil fuel supply and the "carbon
entanglement" it creates, as governments depend on the profits they
accrue (Gurría 2013). The intersection of climate policy and fossil fuel
production is also the subject of a growing body of economic and policy
research. Studies have examined, for example, the extent to which
achieving climate protection objectives would dramatically curtail
fossil fuel profits, or "rents" (Bauer et al. 2013), and render a
significant fraction of coal and unconventional oil reserves and
resources "unburnable" (McGlade and Ekins 2015). Researchers and
financial advisory institutions have highlighted the risk that climate
and broader environmental concerns might lead to the premature
retirement of fossil fuel reserves and supply infrastructures --- and
thus result in "stranded assets" and associated financial losses for
investors and governments (Leaton et al. 2013; HSBC 2013; HSBC 2012;
Caldecott et al. 2013; Hsueh and Lewis 2013; Clark 2015). At the same
time, it is clear that fossil fuel producers --- and the political and
economic interests tied to them --- can pose formidable obstacles to
climate action. With these considerations in mind, several economists
have proposed supply-side approaches to climate policy (Sinn 2008;
Collier and Venables 2014; Harstad 2012; Faehn et al. forthcoming).
[Climate activists are increasingly targeting the supply
side]{.underline} of the fossil fuel economy as well, [rallying
opposition to new fossil fuel supply infrastructure]{.underline} ---
from Keystone XL, to coal terminals and gas pipelines --- [and the
development of new resources]{.underline}, from exploratory oil drilling
in the Arctic to new coal mines in Australia. Many are also pushing for
divestment of major institutions from fossil fuel holdings (Ansar et al.
2013). Yet despite the increased attention, supply-side climate policies
have yet to take hold in most of the world, and there is still limited
understanding of whether and how effectively they might complement or
replace more traditional "demand-side" policies. This working paper
explores the reasons why supply-side policies have not been pursued and
why they deserve more attention. We discuss different types of
supply-side policies, and examine some prominent examples. We then
present new approaches for assessing them alongside demand-side
policies, illustrating how supply-side measures offer the potential to
increase the environmental and costeffectiveness of climate action. We
conclude with suggestions for how to advance the consideration, analysis
and integration of supply-side approaches. 2. WHY THE ROAD IS LESS TAKEN
[Climate policy is built on interventions that address the demand
for]{.underline}, and only indirectly the supply of, [fossil
fuels]{.underline}: cap-and-trade systems, carbon taxes, renewable
energy incentives, emissions performance standards, and energy
efficiency programmes. As noted in the introduction, demand-side
policies have a strong theoretical basis, and in many cases they have,
even under limited application, substantially reduced greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions. By contrast, supply-side policies are far less
widespread. The lack of focus on the supply side can be explained by at
least three factors: 1) the greater political attractiveness of demand
as compared with supply measures; 2) standard GHG accounting rules that
undervalue supplyside relative to demand-side measures; and 3) common
perceptions of the nature of fuel markets. We explore each of these here
in turn. First, promoting the growth of solutions and the industries
that support them --- i.e. new lowcarbon investments --- is inherently
attractive to politicians and community leaders, in part because it
draws relatively little political opposition. By contrast, directly
addressing fossil fuel production, by taxing or reducing such
activities, could be expected to engender strong opposition from
powerful coal, oil and gas interests. However, [[using only
**demand-side** policy]{.underline}]{.mark} focus [[may lead to]{.mark}
unintended [negative effects that]{.mark}]{.underline} partially
[[erode]{.underline}]{.mark} the expected
[[benefits]{.underline}]{.mark}, [particularly in the absence of
widespread carbon constraints internationally. For example, [as carbon
pricing]{.mark}]{.underline} or regulation [[reduces domestic
demand]{.underline}]{.mark} for fossil fuels,
[[producers]{.underline}]{.mark} may [[find new]{.underline}
[markets]{.underline}]{.mark} [(without such constraints)
[internationally]{.mark}]{.underline}, as producers of coal from the
Powder River Basin in the U.S. have sought amid [a declining domestic
market]{.underline}. 1 The expectation of future carbon pricing
[might]{.underline} even [[encourage producers to **accelerate
production** in the near term,]{.mark} as]{.underline} [suggested by
Sinn's "green paradox]{.underline}," described further in Box 1 (Sinn
2008). Box 1: The green paradox Arguably, no individual or concept has
done more to promote the idea of supply-side climate policy --- at least
in economist circles --- than Hans-Werner Sinn and his notion of a Green
Paradox. Sinn (2008) holds that [[owners of fossil fuel resources will
accelerate]{.mark} production when faced with]{.underline} the
likelihood of [increasingly stringent climate]{.underline} policies such
as carbon prices or [constraints]{.underline}. He argues [that
[leakage]{.mark}]{.underline} --- both international and, in particular,
inter-temporal --- [[will undermine climate policy
effectiveness.]{.mark} Fossil fuel resource owners, seeing
that]{.underline} climate policies and support for [[fossil fuel
alternatives will erode their future profits, will maximize profits by
**speeding up production**]{.underline} ([and induce **greater**
**demand**]{.underline}]{.mark}) [in the near term]{.underline}. As a
result, he argues, [most demand-side [climate policies have the effect
of **accelerating**,]{.mark} rather than slowing, as intended, [the
production]{.mark} and consumption of fossil fuels.]{.underline} He
argues that only internationally administered, binding emissions
commitments by a majority of emitters/producers --- a declining permit
system similar to that envisioned in the Kyoto Protocol --- offers an
effective approach to climate policy. However, other
[economists]{.underline} have questioned the presence and relevance of a
green paradox for climate policy (van der Ploeg and Withagen 2012;
Cairns 2014; Edenhofer and Kalkuhl 2011). Hoel (2013)
[find]{.underline}s [that [supply-side climate policies would avoid a
green paradox]{.mark}, i.e. an increase]{.underline} [in]{.underline}
near-term [emissions]{.underline}, to the extent that they are aimed at
higher-cost reserves. Second, the way that nations account for their
carbon emissions --- on a territorial basis --- strongly discourages
supply-side measures, at times with perverse effects. Territorial GHG
emissions accounting, as established by the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and followed by all countries and
most other jurisdictional entities, effectively places the onus on those
who consume fossil fuels, and not on those who supply it. A nation that
taxes coal exports but not domestic consumption, for example, might
reduce coal consumption and emissions in other countries but, by
indirectly encouraging domestic consumption, increase its own (Richter
et al. 2015). Even though these and other supply-side policies could
make important contributions to climate protection, because of how
emissions are accounted, political leaders have lessincentive to
implement them. Not only would resulting reductions in global emissions
not be reflected in national emissions accounts --- in some cases they
might even make it more difficult to reach national emissions targets.
Box 2 explains in further detail how the standard, territorial
accounting framework can create an unintended barrier to reducing
emissions through supply-side measures. Third, common perceptions about
the nature of fossil fuel markets and of the climate problem can
reinforce the focus on demand-side policies. It is more common to hear
that the problem is that "we use too much" fossil fuel than that "we
produce too much", perhaps owing to a presumption that if "we don't
produce it, someone else will" --- i.e. that restricting coal, oil or
gas production would only result in shifting where, and not how much,
fossil fuel is ultimately produced, an outcome known as "leakage". To be
sure, some market leakage would reduce the effectiveness of
supply-constraining policies, but leakage also affects
demand-constraining policies, as we examine further in the section on
assessing policies. Arguably if [demand-side policies]{.underline} were
ambitious enough, and applied widely enough --- for example, if binding,
deep mitigation commitments covering the majority of global emissions
were in place --- they would suffice to achieve the 2°C target. Yet the
reality is that such policies, as envisioned in the Kyoto Protocol,
[have not materialized. As the urgency of the climate problem has grown,
so has the need for a broader range of solutions. To that end,
supply-side policies]{.underline} could [offer several
benefits]{.underline}.

#### Climate change not an existential threat and putting that frame on it makes solvency impossible

Center for International Climate Research. Emissions -- the 'business as
usual' story is misleading. Nature.
https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00177-3)

In the lead-up to the 2014 IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5),
researchers developed four scenarios for what might happen to
greenhouse-gas emissions and climate warming by 2100. They gave these
scenarios a catchy title: Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs)1.
One describes a world in which global warming is kept well below 2 °C
relative to pre-industrial temperatures (as nations later pledged to do
under the Paris climate agreement in 2015); it is called RCP2.6. Another
paints [[a]{.mark} dystopian [future]{.mark}]{.underline} that is
[[fossil-fuel intensive]{.underline}]{.mark} and
[[excludes]{.underline}]{.mark} any [climate
[mitigation]{.mark}]{.underline} policies, leading to nearly [[**5 °**C
of warming]{.underline}]{.mark} by the end of the century2,3. That one
is named RCP8.5.

RCP8.5 was intended to explore [[an **unlikely** high-risk
future]{.underline}]{.mark}2. But [[it has been widely used by some
experts, policymakers and the media]{.underline}]{.mark} as something
else entirely: [[as a likely '**business as usual**' outcome.]{.mark} A
sizeable portion of the literature on climate impacts refers to RCP8.5
as business as usual, **[implying]{.mark}**]{.underline} that [[**it is
probable** in the absence of **stringent**]{.mark} climate
**[mitigation]{.mark}**. The media then]{.underline} often [amplifies
this message]{.underline}, sometimes without communicating the nuances.
[This results in **further confusion** regarding probable emissions
outcomes]{.underline}, because many climate researchers are not familiar
with the details of these scenarios in the energy-modelling literature.

[This is particularly problematic when the worst-case scenario is
contrasted with the most optimistic one]{.underline}, especially in
high-profile scholarly work. This includes studies by the IPCC, such as
AR5 and last year's special report on the impact of climate change on
the ocean and cryosphere4. [[The focus becomes the **extremes**, rather
than the multitude of **more likely pathways**]{.mark} in
between]{.underline}.

Happily --- and that's a word we climatologists rarely get to use ---
[[the world imagined]{.mark} in RCP8.5 is one that]{.underline}, in our
view, [[becomes **increasingly implausible**]{.mark} with every passing
year]{.underline}5. [[Emission pathways]{.mark} to get to
RCP8.5]{.underline} generally [[require an unprecedented **fivefold
increase** in coal]{.mark} use by the end of the century, an amount
larger than some estimates of recoverable coal reserves]{.underline}6.
It is thought that [[global coal use peaked in
2013]{.underline}]{.mark}, and although increases are still possible,
[[many energy forecasts expect it to **flatline**]{.mark} over the next
few decades]{.underline}7. Furthermore, [the falling cost of clean
energy sources is a trend that is **unlikely to reverse**, even in the
absence of new climate policies]{.underline}7.

Assessment of current policies suggests that [the world is on course for
around **3 °**C of warming]{.underline} above pre-industrial levels [[by
the end of the century]{.underline}]{.mark} --- still a catastrophic
outcome, but [[**a long way** from 5 °C]{.underline}]{.mark}7,8. We
cannot settle for 3 °C; nor should we dismiss progress.

Plan for progress

Some researchers argue that RCP8.5 could be more likely than was
originally proposed. This is because some important feedback effects ---
such as the release of greenhouse gases from thawing permafrost9,10 ---
might be much larger than has been estimated by current climate models.
These researchers point out that current emissions are in line with such
a worst-case scenario11. Yet, in our view, [[reports of emissions over
the past decade suggest]{.mark} that [they are actually closer
to]{.mark} those in [the **median scenarios**]{.mark}]{.underline}7. We
contend that these [[critics are looking at the extremes]{.mark} and
**assum**ing that **all** the **dice** are loaded [with the **worst
outcomes**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Asking 'what's the worst that could happen?' is a helpful exercise. It
flags potential risks that emerge only at the extremes. RCP8.5 was a
useful way to benchmark climate models over an extended period of time,
by keeping future scenarios consistent. Perhaps it is for these reasons
that the climate-modelling community suggested RCP8.5 "should be
considered the highest priority"12.

[We must all]{.underline} --- from physical scientists and
climate-impact modellers to communicators and policymakers --- [stop
presenting the worst-case scenario as the most likely one.
[**Overstating** the likelihood of extreme climate **impacts** can make
mitigation seem **harder**]{.mark} than it actually is. [This could lead
to **defeatism**]{.mark}, because [the problem]{.mark} is [perceived as
being]{.mark} **out of control** and
**[unsolvable]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Pressingly, [it [might
result in **poor planning**]{.mark}, whereas a more realistic range of
baseline scenarios will strengthen the assessment of climate
risk]{.underline}.

[The [case]{.mark} for rushing ahead put forward by the Canadian firm,
known as The Metals Company (TMC), is [that the battle for the
materials]{.mark} which might be found [at the bottom of the ocean,
could be]{.mark} at [the heart]{.mark} [of a transition toward
clean]{.mark} (low carbon) [energy]{.mark}, and [China (and Russia)
can't be allowed to control them.]{.mark}]{.underline} This, in their
eyes, justifies the use of heavy machinery at depths beyond 200 meters
to retrieve valuable mineral deposits from the deep seabed, even if that
process --- and the process of pumping it up to the surface --- releases
sand, seawater and other mineral waste back into the water and disrupts
marine habitats. However, while the simplicity of that messaging might
make it easier to put across --- and conveniently taps into existing
geopolitical narratives --- there are good reasons why [[this situation
doesn't actually fit into such limited terms, if you listen to ocean
conservation groups rather than industry and state
players.]{.mark}]{.underline} "**[[Any]{.mark} TMC [reference to China
and Russia is a red herring]{.mark}]{.underline}**," Sian Owen, director
of the DSSC says via email. "[[Both nickel and cobalt are on the way
out]{.mark}, [as far as]{.mark} EV \[electric vehicle\] [battery
tech]{.mark}nology [is concerned]{.mark}, [with a strong possibility
that they will be irrelevant to renewable energy by the time]{.mark}
[d]{.mark}eep-[s]{.mark}ea [m]{.mark}ining [actually came online]{.mark}
(assuming it was approved)."]{.underline} The point is that you can
pitch this as a race for the future, but there's always a chance you're
actually racing in the wrong direction entirely. "A recent World Bank
study concluded that with the rapid evolution in the battery sector,
forecasting which technology will be the most used from now until 2050
is nearly impossible," Owen adds. "[[LFP]{.mark} \[lithium iron
phosphate\] [batteries]{.mark} are already well-established, [leaping
from 10% of the global EV market share in 2018 to about 40% in 2022,
driving a reduction in cobalt demand."]{.mark}]{.underline} Duncan
Currie, legal adviser for the DSCC, adds via email that "Most nickel is
used for stainless steel (60-70%)" and "it's still an important metal in
general," but the specific pitch for these materials as key strategic
sources of clean energy remains a harder sell. [Owen details that
"[Tesla is already using LFP batteries]{.mark}, and Ford and Volkswagen
have announced plans to adopt the technology."]{.underline} She notes
that "In April 2021, Chinese EV company BYD \[比亚迪股份有限公司)\]
announced investment in LFP batteries and that they would be removing
cobalt, nickel and manganese entirely from their vehicle batteries." [At
the same time, "[BMW, Renault, Volkswagen, Scania and Volvo]{.mark}
[have all publicly 'pre-divested' from deep-sea minerals]{.mark}." **A
second issue with any China-centric view of the situation refers to the
ongoing negotiations at the International Seabed Authority (ISA)
themselves**]{.underline}. At the start of this week, The Financial
Times published an article stating that "[China is the biggest ISA
member state to be explicitly betting that the seabed could help it
prolong its sway over critical mineral supply chains, as the
productivity of terrestrial mines continues to decline."]{.underline} It
pointed out that **[[Chinese companies hold five out of 31 exploration
licenses]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and cited one ambassador to the ISA as
saying: "It is well known that China sees this as a way of conserving
its geostrategic domination of minerals ... Their general attitude is to
make sure that the work is advancing as fast as possible ... They are
very serious." But again there are missing details here. China is the
biggest country by many measures, because it's a massive country. The
U.S. is not an ISA member because it has not signed up to the U.N.
Convention on the Law of the Sea and it does in fact hold exploration
contracts itself through the U.K. arm of Lockhead Martin, known as U.K.
Seabed Resources. [And Duncan Currie points out that **[while "China is
an active participant in the regulation negotiations \[it has\] never
indicated that it intends to engage in \[deep-sea mining\] in the near
future]{.mark}**. For instance, [it hasn't]{.mark} (unlike India or
Nauru)]{.underline} [carried out component testing.]{.mark}[" Along the
same lines, a China Daily article from March this year, written in
dialogue with a senior researcher in the country's shipbuilding
industry, stated that regarding deep-sea mining "[China lags behind in
terms of knowledge, technology and hardware,]{.mark} which highlights
the importance of government attention and investment."]{.underline} So
why the rush to position China as most responsible? Why not simply place
it as one of 16 countries the DSCC names as "leading the push to mine
the deep sea" (China, Japan, Canada, India, South Korea, Russia, Brazil,
Singapore, Belgium, Germany, the U.S. ... and the U.K., as well as the
Pacific Island states of Kiribati, Nauru, the Cook Islands and Tonga)?
We can only speculate. [But from The Metal Company's point of view at
least, you'd have to think it had something to do with its admission to
the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), in June 2022, that:
"Operations in the \[Clipperton Fracture Zone (CCZ)\] are certain to
disturb wildlife and may impact ecosystem function.]{.underline} Impacts
on CCZ biodiversity may never be completely and definitively known. It
may also not be possible to definitively say whether the impact of
nodule collection on global biodiversity will be less significant than
those estimated for land-based mining." [In other words, there are a lot
of negative consequences here, and]{.underline} [pointing at a
geopolitical rivalry with China offers the justification for urgency
which might reduce the scrutiny on them.]{.underline}

https://time.com/7287891/deep-sea-mining-economics-dont-add-up/)

Deep-seafloor mining is a complex topic that leaves out a crucial
starting point: mining the potato-sized rocks on the seafloor called
"nodules" only yields four metals of any economic consequence: nickel,
cobalt, copper, and manganese. [Since copper and manganese are plentiful
on land, deep-seafloor mining is really all about nickel and cobalt.
And, unlike many have tried to claim, [you cannot]{.mark} in fact [get
meaningful amounts of rare earth elements from the
seafloor.]{.mark}]{.underline} In the early 2020s, deep-seafloor mining
was advertised as a source of key metals for electric vehicle (EV)
batteries. However, [[battery]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nology has moved
dramatically forward with new chemistries that [require no cobalt or
nickel and instead use inexpensive iron]{.mark}, phosphorus, and sodium.
Cobalt and nickel prices have collapsed since 2022 and both are now in
oversupply worldwide. In other words, cobalt- and nickel-based batteries
are yesterday's technology.]{.underline} With the EV battery narrative
collapsing, Canadian deep-sea mining firm and global leader in the
field, The Metals Company (TMC), recently shifted its marketing away
from batteries to instead advertise that seafloor mining is a way for
the United States to obtain "critical metals." [[China]{.mark} currently
[dominates]{.mark} worldwide supply of many critical metals but this is
**[because it leads in the processing of metals, not the mining of the
raw ore]{.mark}**. [China mines less than 5%]{.mark} of world nickel or
cobalt ore, yet they control approximately 75% of nickel and cobalt
processing and sales worldwide. [If the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [wanted]{.mark} to secure its own metal [supply
chains,]{.mark} it would be better to [focus on]{.mark} simplified
[permitting to process ]{.mark}]{.underline}critical metals domestically
or with our allies[, [rather than strip-mining the depths for
nodules]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is what China does: it imports ore
from Indonesia and the Congo to secure its nickel and cobalt dominance.
We [**[could do]{.mark} the same with our own allies much [more easily
and inexpensively than mining]{.mark} the seafloor**.]{.underline} TMC
claims that once it reaches full production levels in eight to 10 years
it could produce 119,000 tons of nickel and 9,000 tons of cobalt per
year. Even if the company could accomplish that, it would constitute
just over 3% of projected 2025 world production for each. That's
[correct]{.underline}: almost 97% of nickel and cobalt supply would
still come from terrestrial sources. [[The cost assumptions for
deep-seafloor mining don't appear to account for inflation and changes
in interest rates]{.underline}]{.mark}. In 2021, TMC's public filings
projected its total costs through 2046 at nearly \$38 billion. Five
years later after the highest inflation since the 1980s and a more than
doubling of offshore drill ship rates? No public change to their
forecast. Any apparent change in their total financing costs given the
recent doubling of interest rates? None. On the environmental front,
their new refrain is: "Get critical minerals from the areas of the
planet with the least life, rather than the most life." This is,
however, a false equivalence: that it is better to destroy one acre of
seafloor than an acre of Indonesian rain forest. [Not only are there
major mines in non-rainforest areas (in Australia and Canada, for
example]{.underline}) but a three-dimensional terrestrial mine yields
564 tons per hectare of nickel, on average, over its lifetime while the
two-dimensional seafloor yields just 1.5 tons per hectare. Five hundred
to [[2,000 times more area would have to be mined at sea to yield the
same amount as the thick, denser veins of terrestrial
mines]{.mark}.]{.underline} Not to mention, much of the deep ocean
remains unexplored by scientists---so the extent of any potential harm
to ecosystems is still not fully understood.

#### US should focus on refining, not drilling

**[[In truth, the U.S. already has abundant supplies of rare earths, but
it relies on China to refine them.]{.underline}]{.mark}** That is
because the U.S. has lost much of its capacity to process minerals,
while China has become the world's dominant refiner of rare earths,
cobalt, copper and many other metals. "Drill baby drill is not the right
focus," said John Ormerod, a consultant for the rare-earth industry.
[The Wall Street Journal reported that [the D]{.mark}emocratic
[R]{.mark}epublic of [C]{.mark}ongo [has offered the U.S. access to a
trove of minerals, including cobalt and copper, in exchange for helping
it defeat a rebel force in the country.]{.mark}]{.underline} But such a
deal raises questions about where these minerals would be processed.
During a joint address to Congress earlier this month, Trump said he
planned "historic action to dramatically expand production of critical
minerals and rare earths" in the U.S. Last week he signed an executive
order to streamline permitting and boost government financing for new
domestic mineral projects, including processing facilities. "President
Trump been long committed to unleashing all of America's God-given
natural resources, including critical minerals," said White House deputy
press secretary Anna Kelly. The loss of American refining capacity to
China is just one example of how the deindustrialization of the U.S. has
ended up favoring its main geopolitical rival. The U.S. has all but
stopped manufacturing key products, including containerships, certain
pharmaceutical ingredients and some machine tools, as they became
cheaper and more efficient to produce abroad, particularly in China. In
the case of rare earths, the U.S. mines around 12% of the world's
supply, putting it only behind China, according to the United States
Geological Survey. Most of the bounty comes from a massive deposit in
the Mountain Pass mine in California. [But the [U.S. exports about
two-thirds of its rare earths to China]{.mark}. [It has little choice:
China is responsible for around 85% of the world's rare earth
refining]{.mark}. Chinese companies then turn the ore into the final
product---rare-earth magnets---and export the magnets back to the U.S.
Similarly, the U.S. sends a chunk of its substantial supplies of copper
to China for processing. Even America's lone nickel mine sends its
nickel concentrate abroad to Canada for smelting.]{.underline} "That
so-called midstream piece of processing and refining of ores into
chemicals and metals is really important and dominated by China," said
Morgan Bazilian, director of the Payne Institute at the Colorado School
of Mines. Given the pace of China's expanding efforts, "I don't see it
becoming undominated," he said. Until the 1990s, the U.S. was a major
refiner of minerals and metals. But then China emerged as the dominant
player, powered by its cheap labor force and looser environmental
regulations of a sector that can be highly polluting. The voracious need
of Chinese manufacturers for raw materials during the country's years of
explosive growth was also a boon for Chinese refiners. Today, the sheer
scale of China's refining industry makes it difficult for others to
compete. [According to industry estimates, the cost of building a
refinery plant in China is a third of the cost than in the
U.S.]{.underline} China's dominance has grown even further in just the
past few years. The world's top six cobalt refiners are all Chinese and
the country's share of the world's refined cobalt---needed for defense
equipment and batteries---grew from 65% in 2018 to 83% in 2024,
according to Darton Commodities, a cobalt trading company. Similarly,
Chinese companies now dominate nickel processing after setting up huge
plants in Indonesia, the world's top nickel miner. The Trump
administration recently said U.S. refining capacity for copper lags
behind China and launched an investigation into how imports of the metal
threaten U.S. national security. A major focus of the U.S. government in
recent years has been rare earths, which are needed for the production
of F-35 jet fighters, drones and nuclear submarines. The U.S. was a top
player in this industry before Chinese competition hollowed out the
sector. Over the past five years, the U.S. government has announced
hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to rebuild rare-earth
processing plants and factories that make rare-earth magnets. In one of
the more ambitious efforts[, Lynas Rare Earths, [an Australian company,
received \$258 million in Pentagon financing]{.mark} in 2023 to build a
rare earth processing facility in Texas.]{.underline} [Nearly two years
later, [the project has yet to begin construction, delayed in part by
permitting issues]{.mark} related to wastewater treatment.]{.underline}
The company may have to redesign the plant to secure the permits.

between technological breakthroughs and ecological protection," Baidu,
https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1834169876776247398&wfr=spider&for=pc.

[[In March 2025]{.mark}, the \"[Kaituo-2\" deep-sea mining
vehicle]{.mark} independently developed by Shanghai Jiao Tong University
**[completed]{.mark} a [4102.8-meter sea trial]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the
[Western Pacific]{.mark} and [successfully collected 200 kilograms of
polymetallic nodules]{.mark}]{.underline}, marking that China\'s
deep-sea mining technology has entered the forefront of the world. Data
shows that the global deep-sea mineral market has exceeded US\$50
billion, with an annual compound growth rate of 25%. This \"resource
game\" is reshaping the underlying logic of global energy, materials,
environmental protection and other fields.

The core of this game is \"[technological breakthrough]{.mark}\". The
high-mobility travel [technology]{.mark} pioneered by \"Kaituo No. 2\"
in deep-sea complex terrain [can operate stably in 30-degree steep
slopes and sparse soft sediments]{.underline}, and its
[[efficiency]{.mark} is [**30% higher** than]{.mark} that of [similar
international equipment]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even more groundbreaking
is that its [[multi-ore composite drilling and mining system]{.mark}
[can collect polymetallic nodules, sulfides and cobalt-rich crusts **at
the same time**]{.mark}]{.underline}, with a [single device collecting
**[50 tons per day]{.underline}**]{.mark}. This technology is giving
birth to a new business model: a mining company cooperates with new
energy companies to directly supply deep-sea nickel ore to battery
factories, shortening the supply chain by 40% and reducing costs by 15%.

For China, this game is both a challenge and an opportunity. Traditional
mining companies are facing transformation pressure - a steel group
estimates that if deep-sea minerals are fully adopted, the cost of
stainless steel production can be reduced by 20%, but it will need to
invest 10 billion yuan to build a deep-sea mining fleet. Leading
companies build barriers through \"technology export + international
cooperation\": the deep-sea manganese nodule project jointly developed
by China Mining Resources and Brazil has an annual production capacity
of 500,000 tons, and its products are directly supplied to Tesla\'s
Berlin Super Factory. What is more noteworthy is that [**[China]{.mark}
has [made breakthroughs]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} [d]{.mark}eep-[s]{.mark}ea
[environmental protection tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}: the
\"[Sediment Plume Monitoring System]{.mark}\" developed by the Chinese

#### China has deep influence in international institutions and are backed by the best businesses

**Global Times**, **7-31**-24 -- Chinese Newspaper under the People's
Daily, one of world's top ten newspapers. "British media: Why China
attaches great importance to digging for \"treasures\" on the seabed,"
Global Times,
https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1806046969649882105&wfr=spider&for=pc.

The Economist, July 28, original title: **[[China is eager to mine
seabed minerals]{.underline}]{.mark}** Trillions of metal nodules such
as nickel, copper, cobalt and manganese are scattered on the seabed
around the world. The world needs a large amount of these key minerals
to electrify the global economy and reduce dependence on fossil fuels.
The International Seabed Authority (ISA), a United Nations agency, is
still studying how to regulate related mining activities. [At]{.mark}
the [ISA meeting]{.mark} held from July 29 to August 2, supporters and
critics of deep-sea mining discussed related issues. [[Among]{.mark} the
many [countries]{.mark} attending the meeting**, [few]{.mark} are [more
concerned]{.mark}** [about]{.mark} the [outcome]{.mark} of the meeting
[than China]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The International Energy Agency predicts that by 2040, the world\'s
demand for critical minerals will more than double from 2020. [[China
manufactures most of]{.mark} the [world\'s photovoltaic panels]{.mark},
[electric vehicles and batteries]{.mark}, which **[require related
minerals]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But [[many]{.mark} of the [critical
minerals]{.mark} currently used by China **[are
imported]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This **[[dependence]{.mark} has [caused
concern in China]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Critical minerals have become a new area of strategic competition among
major global powers. China believes that critical metals are as
important to the future as crude oil and natural gas. In contrast,
deep-sea mining can ensure a secure supply. To this end**[,
[China]{.mark} has been [expanding]{.mark} its [influence in]{.mark} the
[ISA for many years]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The [ISA]{.mark} has
[issued]{.mark} more than [30]{.mark} deep-sea resource exploration
[contracts]{.mark}. [[China]{.mark}\'s three mining companies [hold
five]{.mark},]{.underline} **[[more]{.mark} [than]{.mark} [any other
country\'s]{.mark}]{.underline}** mining companies. Companies usually
mine to make money, but Chinese companies have greater ambitions. Take
[China Minmetals Group]{.mark}, for example. In March this year, the
company\'s chairman [promised]{.mark} at an industry conference
[to]{.mark} ensure the supply of minerals and [[make]{.mark} due
[contributions]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [China\'s modernization]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} the [great rejuvenation of the Chinese
nation]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Deep-sea mining involves sending large robots to the seafloor to collect
metal nodules. This is no easy task with low visibility and high
pressure on the seafloor. [[China\'s]{.mark} [technology]{.mark} is not
yet cutting-edge, but it is [gradually moving towards]{.mark} its
[goal]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In June]{.mark} this year, the engineering
[prototype]{.mark} [of]{.mark} a [deep-sea heavy-duty mining
vehicle]{.mark} independently developed by Shanghai Jiaotong University
[achieved]{.mark} the [first sea trial depth of 4,000 meters]{.mark} for
a deep-sea heavy-duty mining vehicle. The [[robot]{.mark} is [mainly
made of **domestic components**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Corey Coombs of [[consulting firm Trivium]{.mark} [believes]{.mark} that
once commercial deep-sea mining activities are carried out, [Chinese
companies]{.mark} are [likely to become industry
leaders]{.mark}]{.underline}. [China **has [been]{.mark} [vigorously
supporting]{.mark}** the [development of emerging
industries]{.mark}]{.underline}. Most importantly, China
[provides]{.mark} a [huge domestic market]{.mark} for the wealth brought
from the seabed to the sea surface by its deep-sea mining companies.

[Western competitors]{.mark} are [uneasy]{.mark}, and deep-sea mining
may **[[further consolidate China\'s advantage]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
But for Western companies striving to engage in deep-sea mining
operations, it is a boon. One of them is a Canadian metal company that
hopes to apply for a commercial mining license from the ISA later this
year. The company\'s founder said: \"People are beginning to realize
that China may dominate this industry, which is a very strong driving
force.\"

https://baijiahao.baidu.com/s?id=1834169876776247398&wfr=spider&for=pc.

The far-reaching impact of this game goes far beyond the resource
sector. In the energy sector, the exploitation of deep-sea rare earth
resources will ease the global supply pressure of permanent magnet
materials. After a motor manufacturer used deep-sea rare earths, the
motor energy efficiency increased by 8%. In the field of materials, the
development of deep-sea cobalt mines can reduce the cost of lithium
batteries by 12% and promote the popularization of electric vehicles.

International Supply Chain Expo (CISCE) from July 16 to 20. Against a
backdrop of rising protectionism, this gathering is under the theme of
"**[[connecting the world for a shared future]{.underline}]{.mark}**."
It has attracted a record number of **[[over 650 global
participants]{.underline}]{.mark}**, with approximately 35 percent from
overseas **[[across 75 countries]{.mark},]{.underline}** regions, and
international organizations. Notably, half of the international
participants are from Europe and the United States, including a
remarkable year-on-year **[i[ncrease]{.mark}]{.underline}** of 15

**[In an era marked by]{.underline}** escalating geopolitical tensions
and **[fragmentation, robust overseas participation sends a clear
message: [the business world]{.mark} votes with their feet. And it
[prioritizes stability over ideology]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[the country [achieved]{.mark} a [GDP growth of]{.mark} [5.3%]{.mark}
in the first half of 2025]{.underline}**---an encouraging result that
exceeded expectations shared by many international observers. According
to the National Bureau of Statistics, **[[industrial output]{.mark} also

While some western politicians voice concerns about supply chain
security and advocated for reshoring, this situation actually highlights
a broader truth: **[[China]{.mark} [remains]{.mark} [a]{.mark} vital
driver and [stabilizing force]{.mark} [for]{.mark} [the]{.mark} global
e[conom]{.mark}y. [Business world is eager to foster global supply chain

diversification]{.mark} rather than isolation]{.underline}**. Where one
erects barriers, another builds bridges.

The Path Forward: Cooperation or Confrontation

History warns against fragmentation---seen clearly in the Cold War.
Blocking others ultimately hurts all. Today's stagnation begs the
question: Will leaders embrace business pragmatism or cling to zero-sum
games?

**[[China's role in]{.mark} hosting this event goes beyond [defending
globalization]{.mark}---it's redefining it. Markets [drive both
efficiency and peace]{.mark}]{.underline}**, as Friedman's "price system
miracle" shows. By championing openness, **[[China replaces barriers

#### Effective [global governance]{.underline} including China [solves existential risk]{.underline} of artificial intelligence

Robert **Bailey 18,** Vision of Earth contributor and computer science
masters, 9-5-2018, \"Why do we need global governance?,\" Vision of
Earth, https://www.visionofearth.org/social-change/global-governance/

[[Global governance is necessary]{.mark} because [humanity increasingly
faces]{.mark} both [problems and opportunities]{.mark} that are global
in scale]{.underline}. Today, [transnational problems such as violence
and pandemics routinely reach across borders,]{.underline} affecting us
all. At the same time, [the increasingly integrated global system has
also laid the necessary foundations for peace and spectacular
prosperity]{.underline}. [Effective global governance will allow us to
end armed conflict, deal with new and emerging problems such as
technological risks and automation, and to achieve levels of prosperity
and progress never before seen]{.underline}.1 **[[The most important
challenge]{.mark} for humanity [to overcome is that of existential
risks]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [One way to look at the danger of an
existential risk is to quantify the level of global coordination needed
to deal with it.]{.underline} While best-shot risks, at one end of the
spectrum only require that a single nation, organization or even
individual (i.e., superhero) has the means and the will to save
everyone, weakest-link risks, at the other end of the spectrum, are
dangers that might require literally every country to take appropriate
action to prevent catastrophe, with no room for failure.2 3 We've always
been at risk of natural disaster, but with advances in our level of
technology the risk we pose to ourselves as a species becomes ever
greater. Nuclear weapons are a well-known risk that we still live with
to this day. **[[The progress of]{.mark} technological [research exposes
us to]{.mark} new dangers such as [bioengineered superbugs,
nanotechnological menaces, and the risk of an out-of-control artificial
intelligence]{.mark} with ill-intent]{.underline}**. [[Increased]{.mark}
levels of global [coordination]{.mark} are [needed to combat many of
these risks]{.mark}]{.underline}, as described in our article on the
cooperation possibilities frontier. [There are other problems that don't
necessarily threaten the species or even civilization as we know it, but
which are holding back the development of prosperity and progress.
[Armed conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}, around since the dawn of history,
[still haunts us today]{.underline}. Even though wars between great
powers appear to be a thing of the past, [[regional conflicts]{.mark}
still account for tremendous human suffering and loss of life in parts
of the world without stable governance.4]{.underline} Other problems
have emerged precisely because of our successes in the past. [The
unprecedented advancement of human wellbeing and prosperity over the
past century has been based in large part on the use of [fossil
fuels]{.mark}, thus exposing us to [climate change]{.mark}. Widespread
[automation]{.mark}, already a stressor on society, will put increased
pressure on the social and economic fabric of our societies over the
next few decad]{.underline}es. Global governance can help alleviate
these issues in various ways -- we refer the interested reader to the
very detailed work in Ruling Ourselves. Finally, global governance will
increasingly be judged not only by the extent to which it prevents harm,
but also by its demonstrated ability to improve human wellbeing.5
Progress has let us set our sights higher as a species, both for what we
consider to be the right trajectory for humanity and for our own
conduct.6 Major advances in human wellbeing can be accomplished with
existing technology and modest improvements in global coordination.
[Effective global governance is global governance that tackles these
issues better than the regional governments of the world can
independently. [Global governance is key]{.mark} to solving global
problems. **[Without it, we may not be able to avoid weakest-link
existential risks or regulate new and dangerous technologies]{.mark}.**
With it, we may be able to prosper as we never have before. The next
step is to determine how effective global governance can be
achieved.]{.underline}

#### Chinese tech leadership specifically key to solving climate change 

Sara **Schonhardt**, 11-15-20**24**, \"China must now lead global
warming fight, UN climate chief says,\" POLITICO,
<https://www.politico.eu/article/china-lead-global-climate-fight-un-climate-chief-simon-stiell-cop-azerbaijan-clean-energy>

BAKU, Azerbaijan --- **[[China must]{.underline}]{.mark}** step up and
help **[[lead the fight against climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
starting with a strong new climate target, **[[the United Nations' top
climate official said]{.underline}]{.mark}** Friday. Simon Stiell,
executive secretary of U.N. Climate Change, touted **[[China's
investments in clean energy technology as a demonstration of "leading by
example."]{.underline}]{.mark}** He then implored the world's largest
emitter to release a strong new plan to cut its planet-warming pollution
--- known as a nationally determined contribution, or NDC. "A strong NDC
would send an important signal to other countries that stronger targets
drive investment, that courageous leadership pays off, that development
and sustainability are not at odds --- that they are compatible," said
Stiell, speaking on the sidelines of the global climate talks in Baku.

**Error! Filename not specified.**

His comments, delivered at an event on China's support for developing
nations, come as global climate talks proceed in the shadow of a
government transition in the United States, the world's largest economy
and second-biggest emitter. The U.S. has traditionally taken a key
leadership role at these global summits, pushing countries like China to
do more to cut their emissions faster. But **[[President-elect Donald
Trump has disputed the science behind global warming and promised to
withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the
landmark deal that calls on countries to collectively tackle climate
change. Trump exited the deal in his first term, but President Joe Biden
rejoined in 2021. Stiell noted that this year's global climate summit
and the next, known as COP29 and COP30, will be "critical" for global
efforts to limit rising temperatures. "**[[We will need China's
continued leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}**," Stiell said. Countries at
this year's COP29 summit will need to agree on a new sum for global aid
to help developing countries address climate change. Traditional rich
country donors, such as the U.S. and European nations are calling for
China and other high-emitting, emerging economies to start chipping.

**Error! Filename not specified.**

China has pushed back --- arguing that it already contributes
significant funding to help developing countries through training, joint
research and direct financial support. **[[China has provided nearly
\$25 billion]{.underline}]{.mark}** (177 billion yuan) **[[for climate
efforts in the Global South since 2016]{.underline}]{.mark}**, according
to its officials. Jennifer Morgan, Germany's climate envoy, on Thursday
commended China's efforts but said: "The question remains as to exactly
what money flows are being counted here. The quality of the financing is
also still unclear at present ... It shows that China has already done a
lot and is already doing a lot. But only what is reported transparently
will be recognized." As part of the COP29 negotiations, countries will
also be discussing the transparency of their support and the need for it
to come in the form of below-market-rate loans or grants rather than
high-interest-rate loans. The money is considered necessary to ratchet
up the emissions cuts countries are meant to pledge in their next round
of climate targets due in February. **[[China is currently pledging to

#### Chinese renewable production high and increasing now with clear incentive

Amy **Hawkins 6-26**-2025**,** the Guardian's senior China
correspondent. ("China breaks more records with surge in solar and wind
power," The Guardian,
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/26/china-breaks-more-records-with-massive-build-up-of-wind-and-solar-power>)

China's installations of wind and solar in May are enough to generate as
much electricity as Poland, as the world's second-biggest economy breaks
further records with its [rapid buildup of renewable energy
infrastructure](https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/11/china-building-twice-as-much-wind-and-solar-power-as-rest-of-world-report).

[[China installed 93 GW of solar capacity last
month]{.underline}]{.mark} -- almost [100 solar panels every
second,]{.underline} according to an analysis by Lauri Myllyvirta, a
senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute. [[Wind power]{.mark}
installations [reached]{.mark}]{.underline} 26 GW, [the equivalent of
[about 5,300 turbines]{.mark}]{.underline}.

While estimates for the amount of power generated by solar panels and
wind turbines vary depending on their location and weather conditions,
[Myllyvirta calculated that [May's installations alone could generate as
much electricity as Poland,]{.mark}]{.underline} Sweden or the United
Arab Emirates.

[[Between January and May, China added 198 GW of solar and 46 GW of
wind]{.underline}]{.mark}, enough to generate as much electricity as
Indonesia or Turkey.

"We knew China's rush to install solar and wind was going to be wild but
WOW," Myllyvirta wrote on social media.

[[China's]{.underline}]{.mark} installed [[solar]{.mark} photovoltaic
[capacity has]{.mark}]{.underline} now [[surpassed]{.mark} 1,000
GW]{.underline} for the first time, [equivalent to [half of the world's
total installed]{.mark} solar [capacity]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The record numbers come as researchers and former government officials
from the [US]{.underline} are in [Beijing]{.underline} to participate in
[unofficial climate talks]{.underline}.

Climate negotiations between the two superpowers [have been fraught
since]{.underline} Donald [Trump entered the White House]{.underline} in
January. [[Trump withdrew from]{.underline}]{.mark} many major
[[enviro]{.underline}]{.mark}nmental protection
[[treaties]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as the Paris climate agreement
which aims to limit global warming to well below two degrees celsius
above preindustrial levels. The US president [said at the
time]{.underline}: "The United States will not sabotage its own
industries while [China pollutes with impunity]{.underline}."

[[China is the]{.mark} world's [biggest emitter of greenhouse gases
but]{.mark} is [also the world's biggest supplier and installer of clean
energy technology.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark} Jinping, China's leader, is [increasingly
[connecting]{.mark}]{.underline} China's [[climate ambitions
with]{.mark} the [growth of]{.mark} the [clean energy]{.mark} technology
[sector, which he sees as vital to boosting China's flagging
economy]{.mark}.]{.underline} In a speech in April, Xi highlighted the
fact that in the past five years [China has built "the world's largest
and most complete new energy industry chain"]{.underline}. The term new
energy refers to renewables and supporting technology such as batteries.

But the hyper-competitiveness of China's economy is also putting
pressure on clean energy firms, with prices of solar panels barely
covering the cost of production.

In the first quarter of this year, China's five biggest solar companies
reported a combined loss of over 8bn yuan, according to Bloomberg. At a
recent conference, Yang Liyou, the general manager of Jinneng
Technology, described the industry as being in a "death cycle",
according to Chinese media.

#### China tech lead high now---good for deaccelerating climate change

David **Gelles et al.** **6-30**-2025, New York Times climate reporter,
UC Berkeley, et al., 2025. ("There's a Race to Power the Future. China
is pulling away," The New York Times,
<https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/06/30/climate/china-clean-energy-power.html>

[In China, more wind turbines and solar panels were installed last year
than in the rest of the world combined. And]{.underline} China's clean
energy boom [is going global]{.underline}. Chinese companies are
building electric vehicle and battery factories in Brazil, Thailand,
Morocco, Hungary and beyond.

At the same time, in the United States, President Trump is pressing
Japan and South Korea to invest "[trillions of
dollars](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/business/alaska-lng-japan-south-korea.html)"
in a project to ship natural gas to Asia. And General Motors just killed
plans to make electric motors at a factory near Buffalo, N.Y., and
instead will put \$888 million into building V-8 gasoline engines there.

The race is on to define the future of energy. Even as the dangers of
global warming hang ominously over the planet, two of the most powerful
countries in the world, the United States and China, are pursuing energy
strategies defined mainly by economic and national security concerns, as
opposed to the climate crisis. Entire industries are at stake, along
with the economic and geopolitical alliances that shape the modern
world.

The [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration [[wants to keep the
world hooked on fossil fuels]{.underline}]{.mark} like oil and gas,
which have powered cars and factories, warmed homes and fueled empires
for more than a century. The United States is the world's largest
producer of oil and the largest exporter of natural gas,
[offering]{.underline} the [potential for]{.underline} what Mr. Trump
has called [an era of American "]{.underline}[energy
dominance](https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/02/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-establishes-the-national-energy-dominance-council/)["
that eliminates dependence on foreign countries]{.underline},
particularly rival powers like China.

[[China]{.mark} is]{.underline} racing in an altogether different
direction. It's [[banking on a world that]{.underline}]{.mark} runs on
cheap electricity from the sun and wind, and that [[relies on China for
affordable, high-tech solar panels and turbines.
China]{.mark},]{.underline} unlike the United States, [doesn't have much
easily accessible oil]{.underline} or gas of its own relative to its
huge population. [So it [is eager to eliminate dependence on imported
fossil fuels and instead power]{.mark} more of its economy [with
renewables]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The [[dangers for China of relying on]{.mark} politically [unstable
regions for energy]{.mark} were [underscored]{.mark} recently [when
Israel attacked Iran]{.mark},]{.underline} which sells practically all
its oil exports to China.

[[While China]{.mark} still]{.underline} burns more coal than the rest
of the world and [[emits more]{.underline}]{.mark} climate [[pollution
than the U]{.mark}n]{.underline}ited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and
Europe combined, its pivot to cleaner alternatives is happening at
breakneck speed.]{.underline}]{.mark} Not only does China already
dominate global manufacturing of solar panels, wind turbines, batteries,
E.V.s and many other clean energy industries, but [[with each passing
month it is widening its tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nological
[[lead]{.underline}]{.mark}.

China's biggest automaker, its biggest battery maker and its biggest
electronics company have each introduced systems that can recharge
electric cars in [just five
minutes](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/21/business/catl-battery-china.html),
all but erasing one of the most annoying hassles of E.V.s, the long
charging times. [China]{.underline} has nearly 700,000 clean energy
patents, more than half of the world\'s total. Beijing's rise as a clean
power behemoth is altering economies and shifting alliances in emerging
countries as far afield as Pakistan and Brazil.

The country is [also taking steps that could make it hard for other
countries]{.underline}, particularly the United States, [to catch
up]{.underline}. In April, [Beijing]{.underline} [restricted the
export](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/03/business/rare-earth-metals-china.html)
[of]{.underline} powerful "[rare earth" magnets, a business China
dominates,]{.underline} unless they're already inside fully assembled
products like electric vehicles or wind turbines. While China recently
started issuing some export licenses for the magnets, the moves signal
that [the world may face a choice: Buy China's green energy technology,
or do without.]{.underline}

China has also begun to dominate nuclear power, a highly technical field
once indisputably led by the United States. China not only has 31
reactors under construction, nearly as many as the rest of the world
combined, but has announced advances in next-generation nuclear
technologies and also in fusion, the long-promised source of
all-but-limitless clean energy that has bedeviled science for years.

"China is huge," said Praveer Sinha, chief executive of Tata Power, an
Indian conglomerate that makes solar panels in a high-tech factory near
the southern tip of the country but relies almost entirely on
Chinese-made silicon to [make those
panels](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/05/climate/india-china-solar-manufacturing.html).
"Huge means huge. No one in the world can compete with that."

While China is dominating clean energy industries, from patented
technologies to essential raw materials, the Trump administration is
using the formidable clout of the world's biggest economy to keep
American oil and gas flowing.

In a full reversal from the Biden administration's effort to pivot the
American economy away from fossil fuels, the Trump White House is
opening up public lands and federal waters for new drilling,
fast-tracking permits for pipelines and pressuring other countries to
[buy American
fuels](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/climate/trump-tariff-natural-gas-investment.html)
as a way of avoiding tariffs.

Washington is essentially pursuing a strong-arm energy strategy, both at
home and abroad with allies and friends. It's premised on the idea that
the modern world is already designed around these fuels, and the United
States has them in abundance, so exporting them benefits the American
economy even if solar energy is cleaner and often cheaper.

The competition between the United States and China to sell the world
their wares has serious consequences for the health of the planet.

Burning fossil fuels for more than 200 years has helped create the
modern world while delivering great prosperity to developed countries
such as the United States, which ranks historically as the biggest
emitter of greenhouse gases. But it has also led to what scientists now
say is a growing crisis. The carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere
by the burning of oil, gas and coal acts as a heat-trapping blanket,
leading to rapid global warming.

[[Cheap Chinese-made solar, batteries]{.mark} and E.V.s have [made the
pivot to cleaner tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nologies [[possible for many
large economies]{.underline}]{.mark} including Brazil, South Africa and
even India, a regional rival to Beijing. [That affordability is [crucial
for bringing down global emissions]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The scientific consensus is that [warming, if unchecked, will continue
to cause increasingly severe droughts and storms, potentially alter
ocean currents and global weather patterns, disrupt food production,
deepen a biodiversity crisis and inundate some of the world's biggest
cities as sea levels rise, among other risks.]{.underline}

The Trump administration has dismissed those concerns. The United States
energy secretary, Chris Wright, a former natural gas executive, has
described climate change as "[a side
effect](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/10/climate/energy-secretary-climate-change-fossil-fuels.html)
of building the modern world."

Asked about the diverging energy pathways of China and the United
States, Ben Dietderich, a [[Department of Energy]{.underline}]{.mark}
spokesman, [[said]{.underline}]{.mark}, "The United States is blessed
with an abundant supply of energy resources and the Trump administration
is committed to fully utilizing them to meet the growing energy needs of
the American people." [[Past efforts to encourage cleaner
energy]{.underline}]{.mark} like solar or wind, he said, ["[harmed
America's energy security."]{.mark}]{.underline}

Amanda Eversole, executive vice president of the American Petroleum
Institute, which lobbies for fossil fuel companies, said her
organization monitored Chinese advances and that she was downplaying
their strategic threat. "We continue to keep a very close eye on what
the Chinese are doing, because we believe it's in our national security
interests and our economic interest to continue to dominate from an
American energy perspective," she said.

The White House declined to comment on energy strategy and China's
advances.

[[Most]{.underline}]{.mark} of the world's [[energy still]{.mark} comes
from [fossil fuels. Yet]{.mark}]{.underline} as countries try to address
the perils of climate change, [they've been [steadily adopting cleaner
alt]{.mark}ernative[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. By 2035, solar and wind
power are expected to become the two largest sources of electricity
production, surpassing coal and natural gas[, according to the
International Energy Agency.]{.underline}

[[As]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[cost of renewables keeps
falling]{.underline},]{.mark} the [[U.S.]{.mark} strategy [may leave
China]{.mark}]{.underline} [[poised to capitalize on the world's growing
appetite for]{.underline}]{.mark} not only
[[clean]{.underline}]{.mark}er but [[cheap]{.underline}]{.mark}er
[[power]{.underline}]{.mark}.

"The U.S. will champion a fossil fuel economy, and China will become the
leader of the low-carbon economy," said Li Shuo, who heads the China
Climate Hub at the Asia Society Policy Institute. "The question for the
U.S. now is, where do you go from here?"

How [[America]{.underline}]{.mark} Lost Its Lead

The United States [[had every opportunity to lead]{.mark} the world in
[renewables]{.mark}.]{.underline} In fact, it once did.

Americans created the first practical silicon photovoltaic cells in the
1950s and the first rechargeable lithium-metal batteries in the 1970s.
The world's first wind farm was built in New Hampshire nearly 50 years
ago. Jimmy Carter installed solar panels on the White House in 1979.

[[But with]{.underline}]{.mark} oil, gas and coal in abundant supply,
and the [[fossil-fuel industry funding efforts to downplay climate
concerns, America's commitment to promoting clean
energy]{.underline}]{.mark} investment [[has ebbed]{.mark} and
flowed,]{.underline} sometimes dramatically.

For example, in 2009, the Obama administration began offering loan
guarantees to emerging energy technologies. Tesla got \$456 million, a
loan that proved crucial to its later success.

Then there was Solyndra.

A maker of solar cells, [Solyndra]{.underline} received a federal
guarantee for loans totaling \$528 million, then went [out of
business]{.underline}, leaving taxpayers on the hook. More than a decade
has passed, yet critics of American efforts to promote clean energy
still [cite]{.underline} Solyndra [as evidence of the folly of
renewables]{.underline}.

[Chinese officials have been mystified by the Solyndra
fixation.]{.underline}

"You are a little bit worried by Solyndra? Very small companies, why are
you worried?" Li Junfeng, a [key
architect](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/01/business/trump-china-trade-solar.html)
of China's wind and solar policies, said in a 2017 interview. Beijing
had a bigger appetite for taking risks, which meant sometimes failing,
but also sometimes reaping bigger payoffs.

[[China's goal of dominating clean energy]{.mark}]{.underline}
technology wasn't about climate change. It [[was]{.underline}]{.mark}
born in a moment of [[strategic self-awareness]{.underline}]{.mark} two
decades ago, when the country's leaders looked to the future and
understood that controlling energy production was vital to national
security.

In 2003, Wen Jiabao became China's premier, the country's second-highest
position. A rare-earths geologist, Mr. Wen saw energy policy as both a
business opportunity and geopolitical necessity.

[China had become dependent on imported oil.]{.underline} It [felt
vulnerable]{.underline} to upheavals in the Middle East and to the
control of shipping lanes by the United States and India, two sometimes
hostile powers.

[Air pollution in China was terrible]{.underline}, killing people and
creating a global embarrassment with images of cities smothered in gray.
And the economy still relied on relatively unskilled manufacturing. Mr.
Wen saw in energy a chance to solve both problems by making China an
energy innovator.

"Instead of making flip-flops, they'd make clean tech," said Jennifer
Turner, director of the China environment program at the Woodrow Wilson
Center.

Mr. Wen's government essentially wrote a blank check.

[China]{.underline} provided hundreds of billions of dollars in
subsidies to wind, solar and electric car manufacturers while protecting
its markets from foreign competitors. It
[[established]{.mark}]{.underline} a global [[near-monopoly over many
key raw materials, such as cobalt for batteries]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Low-cost electricity from heavily polluting coal plants allowed the
country to run aluminum smelters and polysilicon factories more cheaply
than anywhere else. Critics have also accused China of [using forced
labor](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/20/business/economy/forced-labor-china-supply-chain.html)
in places like Xinjiang to drive down costs, though China denies this.

At the same time, China has invested in research and a skilled
workforce. These moves offered Chinese clean energy companies a level of
sustained support that was nonexistent in the United States.

"It's [[hard to get China to commit to a long-term
goal]{.underline}]{.mark}," said Jian Pan, co-chairman of CATL, the
world's largest maker of batteries for electric vehicles and electric
grids. "[[But when we commit]{.mark}, we really want to get it
done,]{.underline} and all aspects of society --- government, policy,
private sector, engineering, [[everybody]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[work
hard toward the same goal]{.underline}]{.mark} under a coordinated
effort."

China's efforts paid off.

Little more than a decade ago, CATL was a start-up created to buy a
[Japanese electronics
company's](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/22/business/china-catl-electric-car-batteries.html)
nascent electric-car battery division. Today, from its headquarters,
which are shaped like an enormous battery, it operates a global network
of mines, chemical processors and factories. Its founder is one of the
wealthiest people in the world.

[[Over]{.underline}]{.mark} that same [[short]{.mark}]{.underline}
stretch of [[time, China came to dominate]{.underline}]{.mark} even
[[clean energy industries the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates had [once led.]{.underline} In 2008 the
United States produced nearly half of the world's polysilicon, a crucial
material for solar panels. Today, China produces more than 90 percent.
China's auto industry is now widely seen as the most innovative in the
world, besting the Japanese, the Germans and the Americans.

To slash manufacturing costs, [[China has automated its
factories]{.underline}]{.mark}, installing more robots each year from
2021 through 2023 than the rest of the world combined, and [[seven times
as many]{.underline} [as the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates.

Eric Luo, vice-president of LONGi Green Energy Technology, a Chinese
solar panel maker, said that a practice known as "cluster manufacturing"
had proved beneficial. "There are places where, within a three- to
four-hour drive, you can have everything," he said. The components, the
manufacturer, the skilled workforce, everything. "There's nowhere else
globally where you can have all that innovation clustered together."

Clustering also imparts huge benefits in the car battery business. Robin
Zeng, CATL's founder, said in an interview last summer that it costs six
times as much to build a battery factory in the United States as in
China, and that was before the Trump administration set out to weaken
the financial incentives to build such plants in the United States.

Beyond its domination of manufacturing and technology, China has also
gone on an epic clean-energy building spree.

Last June, the Urumqi solar farm, the largest in the world, came online
in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region in China. It is capable of generating
more power than some small countries need to run their entire economies.

It's hardly an anomaly. The other 10 largest solar facilities in the
world are also in China, and even bigger ones are planned. The Chinese
automaker BYD is currently building not one but two electric vehicle
factories that will [each produce twice as many
cars](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/07/business/china-manufacturing-exports-trump-tariffs.html)
as the largest car factory in the world, a Volkswagen plant in Germany.

The United States was slow to see the full picture. Only toward the end
of the Obama administration and during the first Trump administration
did many Washington policymakers realize they had surrendered so much of
the clean energy race to China.

"The [[U.S. was asleep]{.underline}]{.mark}," said Michael Carr, a
former staff member at the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee
who is now executive director of Solar Energy Manufacturers for America,
a trade group. "[[You can invent the greatest tech in the world, but if
you don't know how to manufacture it, it won't
matter]{.mark}."]{.underline}

Of course, the United States could reverse course. A future
administration could aggressively swing once again to clean energy
research and investment.

But it will have lost precious time. Investments made years ago by China
are paying off now, and Beijing is continuing to pour money into
developing its domestic energy industry and exporting those goods to the
world.

Beijing's 'Soft Power' Ambitions

Among China's biggest green-energy customers is a petrostate, Saudi
Arabia. On desert land renowned for its boundless oil reserves, Chinese
companies are building one of the world's largest battery-storage
projects alongside solar farms.

Around the world, Beijing is using its clean energy clout to build or
expand political and economic relationships.

Both the United States and China not only see energy independence as
essential at home, but understand that supplying other countries with
energy is a vital way to project power. And yet, their approaches
couldn't be more different.

Today, China's dominance of so many clean energy industries is enabling
it to expand its sphere of influence by selling and financing energy
technology around the world. These relationships allow China to forge
multidecade financial, cultural and even military ties at a moment of
shifting geopolitical alliances.

The projects read like a world atlas. Beijing is working on deals to
supply nuclear reactors to countries like Turkey that once did business
mainly with the United States and Europe. In Pakistan, China is already
building what will be the country's largest nuclear plant.

Chinese firms are building wind turbines in Brazil and electric vehicles
in Indonesia. In northern Kenya, Chinese developers have erected
Africa's biggest wind farm. And across the continent, in countries rich
with minerals needed for clean energy technologies, such as Zambia,
Chinese financing for all sorts of projects has left some governments
deeply in debt to Chinese banks.

Since 2023, Chinese companies have announced \$168 billion in foreign
investments in clean energy manufacturing, generation and transmission,
according to Climate Energy Finance, a research group.

"They are dominating these markets," said Dr. Turner of the Woodrow
Wilson Center. "And market dominance can be a form of soft power."

The Trump administration is taking a different road. By dismantling a
vast network of foreign aid programs, it has abandoned America's
longstanding strategy for projecting soft power.

In its place it is taking a more transactional approach with other
countries. In Saudi Arabia, for example, while the Chinese are building
a battery project there, the United States recently agreed to a major
arms sale, and an American company agreed to set up rare-earth mining,
processing and magnet manufacturing. And it is moving aggressively to
sell other countries more fossil fuels.

Mr. Trump, who last year accepted more than \$75 million in campaign
donations from oil and gas executives, promised to "drill, baby, drill"
and deliver an era of "energy dominance." In his first few months he has
tried to clear the way for more exports and to nudge foreign governments
to buy more American gas.

Ukraine, for example, is desperate to maintain military supplies from
the United States and has signaled it would buy more American gas. It's
another example of the administration's aggressive approach, even with
friends.

America gets "geopolitical leverage from oil and gas," said Varun
Sivaram, a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who helped write
clean energy policy for the Biden administration. "The energy transition
is actually very bad for the United States," he said, "because we cede
geopolitical and economic ground to a rival in China."

What Will the World Buy?

The future is being defined one deal at a time. The United States is
pressing South Korea and Japan to buy more Alaskan natural gas and
invest in a [huge, longshot pipeline
project](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/24/business/alaska-lng-japan-south-korea.html)
there. China has been demanding that the European Union allow electric
cars from China into its large market, although that could cause
widespread job losses in Europe's own car industry.

There is unlikely to be an immediate winner in this global race. The
world is only becoming more energy-hungry, stoking an appetite for both
solar panels and oil, nuclear and natural gas.

That [may [work well]{.mark} both [for Beijing and]{.mark} for
[Washington in the short term]{.mark}]{.underline}. The United States
still has many customers for its enormous stores of oil, gas and coal.
Roughly [[80 percent of]{.mark} [global energy]{.mark}]{.underline}
needs are [[still]{.mark} met by [fossil fuels]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[But]{.underline}]{.mark} that proportion is [widely expected to
decline.]{.underline} The International Energy Agency forecasts that
[[by midcentury, oil, gas and coal will fall below 60 percent of
global]{.underline}]{.mark} energy [[needs]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[And [China is positioned to pick up the extra
business]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"[When]{.underline} the federal government of the [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates decides to [go out of]{.underline} the
[race]{.underline}, it doesn't stop the race," said Rafael Dubeux, a
senior official in Brazil's Finance Ministry. "[Other countries keep
moving."]{.underline}

#### US DSM outside of the ISA kills it while Chinese leadership is key to maintain international order

Nong Hong, 5-16-2025, (PhD of interdisciplinary study of international
law and international relations from the University of Alberta, Canada)
\"Diverging Currents: U.S.--China Strategies on Deep Seabed Mining and
the Future of Ocean Governance,\" ICAS,
https://chinaus-icas.org/research/diverging-currents-u-s-china-strategies-on-deep-seabed-mining-and-the-future-of-ocean-governance

[In April 2025, the Trump administration issued an executive order
authorizing the [U.S. government]{.mark} to begin granting commercial
licenses for deep seabed mining ([DSM) in areas beyond national
jurisdiction]{.mark}]{.underline}. The decision marks a significant
policy shift, reflecting a renewed emphasis on national interest and
access to critical minerals. While the order reaffirms longstanding U.S.
concerns about the regulatory scope of the International Seabed
Authority (ISA), [it also [introduces new tensions into an already
delicate global effort to govern the seabed as a shared space]{.mark}.
In contrast, China has continued to pursue its seabed mining ambitions
through formal engagement with the ISA, holding multiple exploration
contracts and investing steadily in the technology and regulatory
infrastructure required for eventual exploitation.]{.underline} These
divergent approaches---one asserting national authority outside of the
UNCLOS framework, the other operating within it---highlight broader
differences in legal strategy, institutional engagement, and visions of
global ocean governance. Trump's Executive Order: Reviving a
Unilateralist Ocean Strategy The Trump administration's April 2025
executive order invokes the Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act
(DSHMRA) as a domestic legal basis for licensing DSM operations beyond
U.S. jurisdiction. While the United States has never ratified UNCLOS, it
has generally adhered to many of its principles in practice. This order
represents a reassertion of unilateral regulatory authority over
commercial activities in the international seabed area, bypassing the
ISA---the body established under UNCLOS to oversee mineral development
in the "Area". Supporters of the policy argue that it is necessary to
secure access to critical minerals---such as cobalt, nickel, and rare
earth elements---seen as essential for clean energy transitions and
national security. Given the increasing geopolitical competition over
supply chains, this rationale resonates with concerns over strategic
vulnerabilities, particularly in relation to China's dominant position
in rare earth processing. [However, the executive order has prompted
criticism from a range of observers. Environmental organizations have
raised alarms about potential ecological damage in the deep ocean and
the precedent set by moving outside the multilateral regime. The [ISA
Secretary-General]{.mark} expressed [concern that unilateral
actions]{.mark} may [undermine collective efforts to manage the
seabed]{.mark} as the "common heritage of mankind." Some U.S. allies,
including [European nations committed to the ISA process, have voiced
unease over]{.mark} what they see as a move toward [regulatory
fragmentation]{.mark}.]{.underline} China's ISA-Driven Strategy:
Embedded Multilateralism with Strategic Depth [[China]{.mark}'s approach
to deep seabed mining [has]{.mark} evolved gradually, with [a clear
preference for operating within the established ISA
framework]{.mark}]{.underline}. Through state-backed entities such as
the China Ocean Mineral Resources R&D Association (COMRA) and China
Minmetals Corporation, [China [currently holds]{.mark} multiples
[exploration contracts with the ISA]{.mark}]{.underline}, covering
polymetallic nodules in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone and Western Pacific
Ocean, polymetallic sulphides in the Southwest Indian Ridge, and
cobalt-rich crusts in the Western Pacific. [This strategy aligns with
[China's broader efforts to position itself as a participant in global
rule-making processes]{.mark}.]{.underline} Engaging with the ISA allows
China to secure legal access to potential mining zones while
contributing to the development of the ISA Mining Code---a set of rules
and environmental safeguards still under negotiation. By remaining
within this regime, China benefits from legal certainty and reputational
legitimacy, even as it advances its national interests. That said,
China's approach is not without its challenges. Critics have questioned
whether ISA mechanisms provide sufficient transparency, and
environmental groups have called for more rigorous oversight of seabed
mining practices globally, including Chinese initiatives. Like other
major players, China must also confront growing global calls for a
moratorium on DSM until stronger environmental protections are in place.
Legal and Philosophical Divergences The U.S. and China's contrasting
strategies reflect broader philosophical differences in how each engages
with international law and institutions. The U.S.
approach---particularly under Trump---leans toward regulatory autonomy,
emphasizing flexibility and national control. The executive order is
consistent with a view that multilateral institutions should not impede
commercial innovation or strategic competition, especially in a domain
where the U.S. sees a potential technological edge. [China, on the other
hand, [sees long-term value in shaping the rules from within]{.mark}.
Its participation in the ISA Mining Code process enables it to influence
standards and expectations while gaining operational experience through
its state-backed operators.]{.underline} China has also made significant
investments in marine technology, environmental baseline studies, and
subsea infrastructure, preparing for eventual commercial activity under
the ISA's evolving regulatory framework. Neither approach is without
trade-offs. **[[The U.S. risks triggering legal ambiguity and diplomatic
friction by operating outside the ISA]{.underline}]{.mark}**, while
China must navigate concerns about environmental impacts and
institutional trust in multilateral processes. Still, both countries aim
to secure access to strategic resources and to build competitive
advantage in what is likely to be a defining domain of future maritime
activity. Risks of Fragmentation and Norm Divergence [The key concern
raised by observers is that [diverging approaches may lead to
fragmentation in seabed governance. If more countries follow the U.S.
lead in issuing national licenses outside the ISA system, the result
could be a weakening of global oversight mechanisms and a **race to the
bottom in regulatory standards**]{.mark}]{.underline}. At the same time,
frustration over the slow pace of the Mining Code negotiations may tempt
other actors to explore alternative legal pathways. [[China, for now,
remains committed to the ISA process, but it too will face strategic
choices if others begin to act unilaterally]{.mark}. A breakdown in ISA
legitimacy could erode the predictability that currently underpins
Chinese contracts and investments. Moreover, China's reputation as a
responsible actor in global ocean governance would be tested if
multilateralism fails to deliver timely or credible outcomes. Both
countries would benefit from a stable, clearly defined regime. Even amid
strategic rivalry, the deep seabed represents an area where shared
interests---legal certainty, environmental stewardship, and avoidance of
conflict---may still foster common ground.]{.underline} Environmental
Considerations: A Shared Challenge Both powers face growing scrutiny
over the environmental and ethical implications of seabed mining. The
deep ocean remains one of Earth's least understood ecosystems. Mining
operations risk disturbing fragile habitats, creating sediment plumes,
and releasing toxic materials. China has begun investing in
environmental baseline studies and impact assessment methodologies,
largely to satisfy ISA requirements. The U.S., despite having a
well-established regulatory framework for environmental protection, has
not put forward a coherent environmental strategy alongside its
licensing announcement---raising concerns that its approach may
prioritize resource access over long-term sustainability. Civil society
pressure is mounting on both sides. Calls for a global moratorium---led
by environmental NGOs and small island states---highlight the risk that
seabed mining becomes a new frontier for ecological degradation and
inequality. Whether China and the U.S. incorporate environmental norms
into their strategies---or dismiss them as geopolitical
constraints---will shape the moral and legal contours of seabed
governance in the decades to come. Future Trend: Competition,
Cooperation, or Coexistence? The future of deep seabed mining remains
uncertain. The United States and China represent two ends of a broader
spectrum---between sovereign innovation and multilateral regulation,
between speed and caution, and between national advantage and shared
responsibility. Whether these approaches will converge or continue to
coexist in tension remains to be seen. Turning deep seabed mining from a
domain of strategic rivalry into a model of cooperative governance will
require a nuanced, evidence-based strategy. By combining
deep-sea-specific regulatory reform, flexible engagement with UNCLOS,
regional partnerships, and targeted technology-sharing initiatives, the
U.S. and China have the potential to jointly secure critical minerals
while safeguarding the long-term health of the ocean's last frontier.
[For now, [the ISA remains the central platform for reconciling diverse
interests and developing binding global rules.]{.mark} [If it succeeds
in finalizing a credible, enforceable Mining Code]{.mark} that balances
commercial ambitions with environmental safeguards, [there is]{.mark}
still [hope for a unified international regime]{.mark}. [If not, the
risk of fragmented governance, legal uncertainty, and growing
geopolitical tension on the ocean floor will intensify]{.mark}.
Ultimately, deep seabed mining is more than a resource challenge---[it
is a test case for how major powers navigate global commons]{.mark}.
Striking a durable balance between competition and cooperation in
[this]{.mark} frontier [domain]{.mark} [will shape]{.mark} not only the
future of seabed governance but also the broader trajectory of [ocean
law and international order]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### China rise is peaceful---their theories are based in flawed claims about Chinese ambitions and identity -- realism is wrong and constructivist interpretations are better at describing recent Chinese actions

4.1 Implications of Defense Industry Dynamics: Theoretical Insights

The theoretical implications concerning China\'s increasing presence in
the global arms industry, while maintaining a relatively lower
proportion of arms sales to total sales, offer rich opportunities to
delve into the complex interplay of power, economy, and ideology within
the frameworks of international relations theories. [China\'s strategy
suggests a novel approach to navigating the geopolitical landscape,
fostering peaceful development while maintaining national defense
capabilities.]{.underline} [Constructivism]{.underline} offers [a
particularly usefu]{.underline}l lens [for understanding China\'s
approach]{.underline}. In contrast to realism and liberal
internationalism, which tend to emphasize states\' material interests
and capabilities, constructivism underscores the role of ideas, norms,
and identities in shaping state behavior. [According to the Chinese
gov]{.underline}ernment\'s official documents and public pronouncements,
[China\'s foreign policy is guided by the principles of \"peaceful
development\" and a \"community with a shared future for mankind.\" This
suggests an ideational commitment to international harmony and
cooperation.]{.underline} Even as Chinese firms have expanded their
presence in the global arms industry, the [proportion of arms sales to
total sales remains comparatively low, potentially signaling a
preference for balancing military preparedness with peaceful engagement
in other economic sectors.]{.underline} Through the lens of
constructivism, this behavior [could be seen as a manifestation of
China\'s identity as a peaceful power.]{.underline} This constructivist
interpretation can be bolstered by drawing on Finnemore and Sikkink
([1998](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41111-024-00253-3#ref-CR26))
norm life cycle model where the Chinese government might be seen as a
\'norm entrepreneur,\' attempting to promote its vision of peaceful
development and shared future on the international stage. This normative
commitment could shape China\'s approach to the arms industry, striking
a balance between maintaining necessary defense capabilities and
participating in broader economic activities. [Liberal
Internationalism,]{.underline} meanwhile, provides a platform to [assess
China\'s strategic economic integration]{.underline} (Paris
[1997](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41111-024-00253-3#ref-CR65)).
While the theory [acknowledges states\' security concerns]{.underline},
it [places a higher emphasis on]{.underline} the [benefits of economic
growth,]{.underline} economic [interdependence and
cooperation]{.underline}. The significant [total sales of Chinese arms
firms]{.underline}, going beyond mere arms sales, [suggest a diversified
economic strategy that enhances global economic
integration]{.underline}. This reflects the tenets of liberal
internationalism and [further substantiates China\'s ideological stand
for peaceful development.]{.underline} Lastly, while
[Realism]{.underline} emphasizes power and security, it [does not
completely negate China\'s peaceful development strategy.]{.underline}
The [arms industry, by its nature, is tied to national security
interests (Dalby]{.underline}
[1995](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41111-024-00253-3#ref-CR18)[).
Hence, China\'s growth in this sector indicates its effort to secure
itself in an anarchic international system]{.underline}. However, the
relatively low percentage of arms sales to total sales can be
interpreted as a nuanced approach that doesn\'t solely rely on military
buildup to assert its status as a great power. China\'s increase in the
production and sales of arms could indeed be seen through the lens of
deterrence theory. While a major player in the global arms industry[,
China\'s relative restraint in the percentage of arms sales to total
sales could be a manifestation of a \'minimum deterrence strategy\'.
Such a strategy entails maintaining only those military capabilities
that are necessary to deter adversaries from aggression, but not beyond
to the extent that would appear]{.underline} provocative or
[threatening]{.underline}. This idea is [in alignment with China\'s \'No
First Use\' policy regarding nuc]{.underline}lear weapon[s,
a]{.underline} [classic form of deterrence]{.underline} (Pan
[2018](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41111-024-00253-3#ref-CR63)).
It is plausible that China is applying a similar principle to its
conventional military capabilities. Through this lens, [China\'s growth
in the arms industry can be seen as a careful
balance]{.underline}---seeking to [create a strong]{.underline} enough
[deterrent to secure its national interests, without reaching a level of
military buildup that might alarm other nations and trigger an arms
race.]{.underline} Further reinforcing this point, China\'s 2019 Defense
White Paper states, \"China will never follow the beaten track of big
powers in seeking hegemony. \[...\] China\'s defense expenditure is
reasonable and appropriate\" (Liangyu
[2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41111-024-00253-3#ref-CR49);
Song and Chen
[2024](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41111-024-00253-3#ref-CR76);
Meng
[2023](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41111-024-00253-3#ref-CR59)).
This statement underlines China\'s intentions of maintaining a
defensive, deterrent stance rather than pursuing offensive militaristic
objectives. By **[maintaining a robust, yet not overly aggressive arms
industry, China sends a clear message to potential adversaries: It has
the capabilities to retaliate if attacked, but is not seeking to
threaten others or assert dominance through military
might]{.underline}**. This potentially contributes to regional and
global stability, as it deters aggression without provoking the kind of
fear or suspicion that could lead to conflict. Thus, the deterrence
theory complements our earlier analyses, further illustrating the
multi-faceted and nuanced nature of China\'s approach to its growth in
the global arms industry. This strategic stance embodies its pursuit of
a peaceful development path in the international system, even as it
navigates the complexities of global security dynamics. Therefore, by
synthesizing the insights from different theoretical paradigms, we can
better understand [China\'s]{.underline} peaceful development strategy
in the global arms industry. Its [conduct]{.underline}, as reflected in
the arms production data, [embodies a complex mix of normative
commitment]{.underline} (constructivism), [economic
pragmatism]{.underline} (liberal internationalism), [minimal deterrence
strategy and security considerations]{.underline} (realism), [which
aligns with its overarching ideology of peaceful development and shared
future.]{.underline} The analysis of SIPRI arms import data from 2019 to
2022 provides a focused lens through which we can gauge China\'s
military strategy, particularly its emphasis on self-reliance and
peaceful development. China\'s relatively low arms import volume,
compared to other major powers, suggests a strategic choice that
diverges from aggressive military expansion, highlighting a preference
for indigenous development and technological advancement (Bitzinger and
Char
[2020](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41111-024-00253-3#ref-CR12)).
This strategic choice might reflect China\'s broader objectives to
enhance its military capabilities while maintaining a posture of
non-aggression, aligning with its stated goals of peaceful development.
China\'s significant role as an arms exporter underscores its advanced
military and technological capabilities, further emphasizing its
strategy to project power without reliance on foreign arms imports
(Gilli and Gilli
[2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41111-024-00253-3#ref-CR29)).
While the data on arms imports offers valuable insights into China\'s
military strategy, it is crucial to acknowledge that this metric alone
does not provide a comprehensive view of China\'s or any country\'s
hegemonic ambitions or overall military capabilities. The example of
Russia\'s military activities illustrates that low arms imports do not
necessarily correlate with non-aggressive behavior. Thus, while China\'s
arms import data suggest a certain strategic restraint, this should be
interpreted within the broader context of its military exports,
indigenous production capabilities, and overall strategic posture.
However, in the case of India and Pakistan, the arms import dynamics
play a significant role in their enduring rivalry, where both nations
have historically leveraged arms imports to bolster their military
capabilities, directly impacting the security calculus and balance of
power in South Asia which means imports are a good indicator as well of
the intensifying military competition and preparedness each country aims
to achieve in the context of their regional rivalry (Pattanaik
[2018](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41111-024-00253-3#ref-CR66),
173--83; Ali and Lee
[2022](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41111-024-00253-3#ref-CR1);
Bibi and Lee
[2023](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41111-024-00253-3#ref-CR10)).
In the context of East Asia, understanding China\'s military
capabilities and strategic intentions is crucial given the region\'s
complex security dynamics. China\'s approach to arms imports, coupled
with its focus on indigenous military development, can be seen as a
method to enhance its relative power in the region while avoiding the
perception of pursuing outright hegemony. Therefore, the SIPRI data on
China\'s arms imports is a valuable piece of the puzzle in understanding
its military strategy and regional power dynamics. However, it is just
one part of a larger narrative that requires a comprehensive analysis of
China\'s military exports, domestic production capabilities, and
strategic doctrines to fully understand its approach to power and
influence in East Asia and beyond. This is especially important as arms
import is a method to increase capabilities to increase relative power
because it directly influences a nation\'s military strength and its
ability to assert itself on the international stage, thereby impacting
its strategic position and potential for regional or global influence.
In light of the data provided by the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute (SIPRI), the trends indicate that from 2019 to 2022,
China consistently positioned itself among the top five global arms
exporters. This ranking is a clear demonstration of China\'s robust
industrial and manufacturing capacities. Notably, by 2022, China
ascended to the fourth position, marking a significant leap forward in
its position within the global arms market. However, these developments
must be examined within the broader context of China\'s political
ideologies and strategic objectives. **[Analyzing the literature and
official Chinese documents and statements, the country\'s foreign policy
principles have been articulated as mutual respect for sovereignty and
territorial integrity, mutual non-aggression, non-interference in other
countries\' internal affairs, and the peaceful coexistence of
nations]{.underline}**. This commitment to peaceful development, **[as
echoed in the 2011 white paper \"China\'s Peaceful Development\", is an
essential foundation in understanding China\'s approach to arms
exports]{.underline}** (China's peaceful development
[2011](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41111-024-00253-3#ref-CR16)).
However, this theoretical framework contrasts with China\'s robust
growth in arms exports. It appears that the act of exporting military
hardware aligns with its foreign policy principles, strengthening ties
with partner nations that might be overlooked by Western arms
manufacturers due to geopolitical or human rights considerations. This
is in line with the analysis of Buzan and Cox
([2013](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41111-024-00253-3#ref-CR13)),
who argued that China adopts a more selective approach towards military
interventionism and the application of hard power, as a part of a
broader strategy of establishing its peaceful rise. Despite the growth
of China\'s arms exports, it is worth highlighting that the United
States, the leading arms exporter, consistently exports five to seven
times more in value than China. The United States\' dominant position
could be attributed to the perceived superiority and wider variety of
American military hardware, a point supported by Gilli and Gilli
([2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41111-024-00253-3#ref-CR29))
work, emphasizing the difficulty in duplicating modern military
technology. Additionally, analyzing China\'s arms export data in
conjunction with its arms import data provides an interesting
perspective. China, despite being a major arms exporter, is also a net
importer of arms, demonstrating a nuanced strategy to its military
development. This reflects the nation\'s attempt to strike a balance
between leveraging foreign technologies and enhancing its domestic arms
production, reinforcing its commitment to a calculated approach to
military development. The potential regional and global security
implications of China\'s arms export strategy warrant careful
consideration. China\'s growth as a major arms exporter may impact
regional power dynamics and security policies. In regions with
substantial strategic interest for China, like Southeast Asia and
Africa, this could create a power imbalance, exacerbating security
concerns, a point which resonates with the arguments made by Glaser and
Medeiros
([2007](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41111-024-00253-3#ref-CR31))
about China\'s potential as a disruptive force in the international
system. Therefore, China\'s position as a growing arms exporter provides
valuable insights into its manufacturing capabilities, strategic
objectives, and ideological tenets. These developments, however, require
careful monitoring and further research due to their potential impacts
on global security dynamics. From the perspective of the \"peaceful
rise\" or \"peaceful development,\" the consistent position of China
among the top global arms exporters doesn\'t necessarily contradict this
principle. Yaqing
([2010](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41111-024-00253-3#ref-CR91))
notes that China has utilized its unique characteristics to gradually
integrate and gain acceptance within the international community,
pointing to its incremental growth as an arms exporter as a part of this
process. Furthermore, China\'s careful navigation of the global arms
market, rather than overtly challenging existing structures, aligns with
its non-revisionist approach. Applying the \"Harmonious World\" concept
to China\'s arms exports activity, China appears to foster relationships
based on strategic economic and security considerations rather than
ideological alignment, echoing the principle of non-enemy diplomacy. The
increase in its arms exports could be seen as an extension of this
policy, fostering stronger ties and dependencies with its customers,
especially those in regions with strategic interest for China. This
analysis supports Hao
([2008](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41111-024-00253-3#ref-CR34))
views on China\'s approach to diplomacy and regional integration. [The
\"Chinese Dream,\" as per Wang
(]{.underline}[2014](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41111-024-00253-3#ref-CR84)[),
continues to embody previous ideals like the \"Harmonious World\" and
\"Peaceful Development.\" Therefore, the growth in China\'s arms exports
could be seen as an attempt to consolidate its influence and ensure its
security, reflecting the dream\'s aspect of a powerful and prosperous
China.]{.underline} However, as Pu
([2017](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41111-024-00253-3#ref-CR67))
suggests, this increased activity and its implications might generate
confusion and concern among global observers due to China\'s ongoing
identity crisis. Viewing through the lens of a \"Community with a Shared
Future for Mankind,\" China\'s increase in arms exports may appear
contradictory, given the principle\'s emphasis on peace and security.
However, it could be argued that [China sees these exports as a means to
maintain balance in the global order, or as a tool to assist other
nations in safeguarding their own security**, aligning with its vision
of mutual benefit and shared development.**]{.underline}

[One core Restraint set of views is that [the United States is
unnecessarily over--extended in its military involvement]{.mark} across
the globe, has an excessively broad definition of its vital interests,
and [too frequently relies on military over diplomatic means]{.mark} to
defend those interests while seeking to maintain, to the maximum extent
possible,]{.underline} economic and military dominance worldwide and to
extend democracy to as many nations as possible. 2 [A second Restraint
view that follows from the above is the notion that post--Cold War
[efforts to maintain U.S. global military primacy]{.mark}, whether
emphasizing deterrence or active intervention, [have most often produced
a more dangerous, less stable world]{.mark}, thereby undermining the
most vital U.S. interest of safeguarding the security and well--being of
the American people]{.underline}. 3 The United States is physically very
secure behind two oceans and with two friendly neighbors on its borders,
and in any event has the capability, through nuclear weapons and a
territory--based conventional power projection capability, to counter
any direct or indirect military threats to its most vital interests. The
definition of vital national interests should thus be limited to the
defense and preservation of conditions directly necessary to the
territorial integrity, security, and well--being of the American people
and their way of life. This primarily requires the ability to protect
the nation against both direct and indirect, national, transnational,
and subnational threats to such interests, and a stable global order
open, as much as possible, to trade, investment, technological
innovation, and people--to--people contacts. It also requires
co--existence with countries with different political systems, congruent
with a stable and open global order. Above all, it requires a strong and
cohesive domestic political, economic, and social order. [It does not
require absolute security, the maintenance of a prominent global
military presence, a reliance on frequent overseas military forays, or
extensive, formal, often one--sided, security commitments to a wide
range of other nations.]{.underline} A third Restraint viewpoint
stresses the fact that the international system within which the United
States defends or advances its interests is no longer unipolar. 4 The
conditions that elevated the United States to the status of global
hegemon after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991 no longer exist and
cannot be restored. **[The United States has [no practical alternative
but to accept the reality of]{.mark} an increasingly [multipolar
world]{.mark} and recognize that both [continued U.S. dominance and
world peace are illusions]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For the foreseeable
future, mutual coexistence, compromise, and balance among the great
powers will have to suffice as an operative conception of "peace." 5
This concept thus rejects the use of distorting and dangerous, usually
zero--sum ideological frameworks in understanding global politics, such
as "democracy versus authoritarianism," or a singular stress on "great
power competition." 6 The Restraint view holds that, within this system,
two existential or near--existential international threats endanger
humankind above all else in the present century: first, the increased
possibility of large--scale nuclear war (as a result of proliferation,
new technologies, the erosion of arms control agreements, and deepening
great power rivalries); and second, the largely unchecked worsening of
the climate crisis as the preeminent expression of global environmental
degradation. 7 A third threat is primarily domestic and mostly affects
democratic states, although it certainly also has international
implications: the rise of extremely nationalist, anti--democratic,
race--based nativism and the political polarization and dysfunction it
engenders. 8 For Restraint advocates, [[these threats supersede any
supposed global]{.mark}, value--based threats, including the commonly
perceived inflated and distorted international [struggle between
democracy and authoritarianism]{.mark}]{.underline}, as well as
narrower, conventional security or economic rivalries among non--nuclear
powers. In assessing the role of diplomacy (and other non--military
forms of international engagement and conflict resolution) versus
military force, despite the introduction of new technologies,
Restrainers believe that military conflict remains fraught with risk,
uncertainty, higher than expected costs, and the likelihood of
unexpected consequences. [This fact, along with the gradual emergence of
a multipolar order and the [frequent historical failures of U.S.--led
attempts to invade, occupy, and remake distant nation]{.mark}--states,
[provide good reasons to prioritize diplomacy]{.mark} and economic or
other forms of non--violent tools of statecraft over military
intervention. 9]{.underline} While the political use of military
capabilities is in many cases essential in the conduct of diplomacy, any
actual use of force should be considered a last resort, employed only
under extreme conditions, and in the defense of vital interests only.
[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, as the dominant military and
economic power on the planet, has developed and [maintained the
dangerous notion that only American global primacy and "leadership" can
keep the world peaceful and ensure prosperity]{.mark}.]{.underline} 10
Restrainers believe this idea has led the United States to engage
frequently in a feckless misuse of military power, resulting in large
part from inflated threats, overconfidence, and a deep belief in
American exceptionalism. With the possible exception of Israel, no
nation employs force as frequently. Moreover, many Americans remain
strongly supportive of high levels of U.S. defense spending and
Washington's many global security alliances. However, many citizens are
also growing weary of U.S. military interventions and the heavy reliance
on military options in handling foreign problems. 11 Large numbers of
Americans now favor diplomacy over military force. 12 And some question
the need for large numbers of overseas military bases around the world.
13 This suggests popular support for a Restraint--oriented foreign
policy, including reduced defense spending if and as security
competitions with other great powers are reduced. Compounding the
problems caused by military intervention in the service of primacy is
the emergence in the United States of deep levels of public uncertainty
and insecurity about the future. The many factors underlying this
feeling of uncertainty include a crisis of legitimacy involving
widespread dissatisfaction with prevailing conceptions of freedom and
democracy when viewed through the lens of race, gender, and sexuality,
as well as egregious government ineptitude, fiscal irresponsibility, and
persistent social problems. 14 Politicians often exploit the worsening
domestic situation by inflating the threats posed by undemocratic states
like China to divert attention from their own responsibility for
problems at home and to unify their political base. 15 Domestic
circumstances have also created a strong tendency toward an excessive
level of economic protectionism which, in the absence of countervailing
domestic policies, undermines growth and weakens incentives to cooperate
with China and other nations in handling common global economic and
financial threats. 16 Restrainers assert that this dynamic, [along with
[a deeply--rooted commitment to sustaining high levels of defense
spending and hundreds of overseas bases, are increasing the chance of
conflict with non--democratic powers]{.mark} while undermining efforts
to properly define, prioritize and deal with threats at home and
abroad.]{.underline} 17 Finally, many U.S. friends and allies have both
the capacity and the need to do far more to provide for their own
defense, thereby allowing the United States to significantly reduce its
own global military posture. But Restraint does not encourage those
countries to rapidly ramp up their defense spending. [[Deepening
interdependence]{.mark}, the possibility of large--scale nuclear war,
and the emergence of high priority common security threats such as
climate change [all argue in favor of efforts to reduce interstate
security competition, which would lower the need for ever higher defense
budgets, and enhance incentives for more cooperative forms of
security.]{.mark}]{.underline} 18 If successfully implemented, Restraint
as a basis of policy vis--à--vis China will buy the United States time
to repair its severely damaged domestic order and reallocate national
security resources to concerns that pose a greater threat to the
security and well--being of the American people than China. More
broadly, it will facilitate the identification of clear red lines based
on the protection of genuinely vital interests, the adoption of prudent
and balanced approaches to contentious issues, and the opening of
intellectual and political space allowing for greater dialogue,
understanding, and compromise between Washington and Beijing. 19 This
will significantly reduce the chances of conflict.

a de facto alliance with China and [encourage Russia's eventual
integration into the European security order]{.mark}. Given the United
States' limited resources, [policymakers should work to construct a new
global compact that does not rely on sustaining overwhelming U.S. power
in all places]{.mark}, and at all times]{.underline}. They should
reimagine U.S. power in a multipolar world of many capable actors and
work with allies and partners to redistribute defense burdens and costs.
Policymakers should focus on reducing the risk of conflict and
eliminating barriers to commerce. This strategy calls for rebalancing
the US-foreign-policy toolkit by elevating diplomacy, trade, and
cultural exchanges, and by deemphasizing the use of force and coercion.
Specifically, the United States should: Invest in Diplomacy, Including
Public Diplomacy. For most of American history, U.S. leaders relied on
diplomacy to extend U.S. influence and secure vital U.S. interests. In
the latter half of the 20th century, however, diplomacy was often
supplanted by U.S. military power. If diplomacy is to again become a
leading tool for advancing U.S. interests in an increasingly complex
world, the State Department needs to be fully resourced. Consistent and
reliable two-way communication between government agencies and the
public is critical to establishing a broad and durable consensus on
foreign affairs. Absent sufficient outreach to the public, U.S. foreign
policy will remain a "black box" to most Americans.

Key Findings: Rethinking the Value of Democracy

[The value of democracy has been taken for granted]{.underline} until
recently, but this assumption seems to be under threat now more than
ever before. As was explained in Chapter 1, democracy's claim to be
valuable does not rest on just one particular merit, and scholars tend
to distinguish three different types of values (Sen 1999). This book
focused on the instrumental value of democracy (and hence not on the
intrinsic and constructive value), and investigated the value of
democracy for peace (Chapters 3 and 4), control of corruption (Chapter
5) and economic development (Chapter 6). [**This** [study was based
on]{.underline}]{.mark} [a search of [an **enormous academic
database**]{.mark} for certain keywords,]{.underline}6 [then
[pruned]{.mark} the thousands of articles down [to **a** ]{.mark}**few
[hundred articles]{.mark}** (see Appendix) [which statistically
**analysed** ]{.mark}**the connection between the [democracy]{.mark} and
the four expected outcomes**.]{.underline}

The first finding is that **[[a reverse wave]{.mark} away [from
democracy]{.mark}]{.underline} [has [not happened]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(see Chapter 2). Not yet, at least. [Democracy is not doing worse than
before, at least not in comparative perspective. While it is true that
there is a dramatic decline in democracy in **some
countries**,]{.underline}7 [a **general trend** downwards cannot yet be
detected.]{.underline} It would be better to talk about 'stagnation', as
not many dictatorships have democratized recently, while democracies
have not yet collapsed.

Another finding is that the instrumental value of democracy is very
questionable. The feld has been deeply polarized between researchers who
endorse a link between democracy and positive outcomes, and those who
reject this optimistic idea and instead emphasize the negative effects
of democracy. [There has been 'no consensus' in the quantitative
literature on whether democracy has instrumental value which leads some
beneficial general outcomes. Some scholars claim there is a consensus,
but they only do so by ignoring a huge amount of literature which
rejects their own point of view]{.underline}. After undertaking a
large-scale analysis of carefully selected articles published on the
topic (see Appendix), [this book can conclude that the [connections
between **democracy and expected benefts** are not]{.mark} as
[strong]{.mark} as they seem.]{.underline} Hence, we should not
overstate the links between the phenomena.

**[The overall evidence]{.underline} is
[weak]{.underline}**[.]{.underline} Take the expected impact of
democracy on peace for example. As Chapter 3 showed, the study of
democracy and interstate war has been a fourishing theme in political
science, particularly since the 1970s. However, there are four reasons
why democracy does not cause peace between countries, and why the
empirical support for the popular idea of democratic peace is quite
weak. [Most statistical [studies have not found a]{.mark} strong
[correlation between **democracy and**]{.mark} **interstate
[war]{.mark}** at the dyadic level. They show that [there are
**other**]{.mark}---[**more powerful**---explanations for
war]{.mark}]{.underline} and peace, and even that [the impact of
democracy is a spurious one]{.underline} (caveat 1)[. Moreover, the
theoretical foundation of the democratic peace hypothesis is weak, and
the causal mechanisms are unclear (caveat 2). In addition, democracies
are not necessarily more peaceful in general, and the evidence for the
democratic peace hypothesis at the monadic level is
inconclusive]{.underline} (caveat 3)[. Finally, [the **process of
democratization is dangerous**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Living in a
democratizing country means living in a less peaceful country (caveat
4). With regard to peace between countries, we cannot defend the idea
that democracy has instrumental value.

[Can the (instrumental) value of democracy be found in the prevention of
civil war?]{.underline} Or is the evidence for the opposite idea more
convincing, and does democracy have a 'dark side' which makes civil war
more likely? The findings are confusing, which is exacerbated by the
fact that different aspects of civil war (prevalence, onset, duration
and severity) are mixed up in some civil war studies. Moreover, defining
civil war is a delicate, politically sensitive issue. Determining
whether there is a civil war in a particular country is incredibly
diffcult, while measurements suffer from many weaknesses (caveat 1).
Moreover, **there is [no linear link]{.underline}:** [civil wars are
just as unlikely]{.underline} [in democracies as in
dictatorships]{.underline} (caveat 2)[.]{.underline} Civil war is most
likely in times of political change. [Democratization is]{.underline}
**[a very unpredictable]{.underline}, [dangerous process]{.underline},**
[[increasing the chance of **civil war**
significantly.]{.underline}]{.mark} Hybrid systems are at risk as well:
the chance of civil war is much higher compared to other political
systems (caveat 3). More specifcally, both the strength and type of
political institutions matter when explaining civil war. However, [the
type of political system (e.g. **democracy or dictatorship**) is not the
decisive factor at all (caveat 4). Finally, democracy has only limited
explanatory power (caveat 5). Economic factors are **far more
significant** than political factors (such as **having a democratic
system**) when explaining the onset, duration and severity of civil war.
To prevent civil war, it would make more sense to make poorer countries
richer, instead of promoting democracy. Helping countries to democratize
would even be a very dangerous idea]{.underline}, as countries with
changing levels of democracy are most vulnerable, making civil wars most
likely. It is true that there is evidence that the chance of civil war
decreases when the extent of democracy increases considerably. The
problem however is that most countries do not go through big political
changes but through small changes instead; those small steps---away or
towards more democracy---are dangerous. Not only is the onset of civil
war likely under such circumstances, but civil wars also tend to be
longer, and the confict is more cruel leading to more victims,
destruction and killings (see Chapter 4).

A more encouraging story can be told around the value for democracy to
control corruption in a country (see Chapter 5). Fighting corruption has
been high on the agenda of international organizations such as the World
Bank and the IMF. Moreover, the theme of corruption has been studied
thoroughly in many different academic disciplines---mainly in economics,
but also in sociology, political science and law. Democracy has often
been suggested as one of the remedies when fghting against high levels
of continuous corruption. So far, the statistical evidence has strongly
supported this idea. As Chapter 5 showed, dozens of studies with broad
quantitative, cross-national and comparative research have found
statistically signifcant associations between (less) democracy and
(more) corruption. However, there are vast problems around
conceptualization (caveat 1) and measurement (caveat 2) of 'corruption'.
Another caveat is that democratizing countries are the poorest
performers with regard to controlling corruption (caveat 3). Moreover,
it is not democracy in general, but particular political institutions
which have an impact on the control of corruption; and a free press also
helps a lot in order to limit corruptive practices in a country (caveat
4). In addition, democracies seem to be less affected by corruption than
dictatorships, but at the same time, there is clear evidence that
economic factors have more explanatory power (caveat 5). In conclusion,
more democracy means less corruption, but we need to be modest (as other
factors matter more) and cautious (as there are many caveats).

The [perceived impact of democracy on development has been **highly
contested as well**]{.underline} (see Chapter 6)[.]{.underline} Some
scholars argue that democratic systems have a positive impact, while
others argue that high levels of democracy actually reduce the levels of
economic growth and development. Particularly since the 1990s,
[statistical studies have focused on this debate, and the empirical
evidence is clear]{.underline}**:** [[there is]{.underline}
**[no]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[direct [impact]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}**[[of democracy on]{.underline}
[**development**.]{.underline}]{.mark} Hence, both approaches cannot be
supported (see caveat 1). The indirect impact via other factors is also
questionable (caveat 2). Moreover, [[there is **too much variation**
in]{.mark} levels of economic [growth]{.mark}]{.underline} and
development [[among]{.mark} the **[dictatorial
systems]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[and there are **huge regional
differences**]{.underline}]{.mark} (caveat 3). Adopting a one-size-fits
all approach would not be wise at all. In addition, in order to increase
development, it would be better to focus on alternative factors such as
improving institutional quality and good governance (caveat 4). There is
not sufficient evidence to state that democracy has instrumental value,
at least not with regard to economic growth. However, future research
needs to include broader concepts and measurements of development in
their models, as so far studies have mainly focused on explaining
cross-national differences in growth of GDP (caveat 5).

Overall, [[the instrumental value of democracy
is]{.underline}]{.mark}---at best---tentative, or---if being less
mild---[**simply [non-existent]{.mark}**. Democracy is not necessarily
better than any alternative form of government. [With]{.mark} regard to
many of the expected benefts---such as less **[war]{.mark}**, less
[**corruption** and]{.mark} more **economic
[development]{.mark}**---democracy does deliver, but **so do
nondemocratic systems**]{.underline}. High or low levels of democracy do
not make a distinctive difference. Mid-range democracy levels do matter
though. Hybrid systems can be associated with many negative outcomes,
while this is also the case for democratizing countries. Moreover, other
explanations---typically certain favourable economic factors in a
country---are much more powerful to explain the expected benefts, at
least compared to the single fact that a country is a democracy or not.
The impact of democracy fades away in the powerful shadows of the
economic factors.8

[[Although]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has not
formally ratified UNCLOS]{.mark}, **[it recognizes many of its
provisions]{.mark} [as]{.mark} [c]{.mark}ustomary [i]{.mark}nternational
[l]{.mark}aw**. Successive [U.S. administrations]{.mark} [have]{.mark}
**[adhered to UNCLOS]{.mark} principles**, especially regarding
navigational freedoms and territorial demarcations, as they align with
U.S. interests in maritime mobility and national security.]{.underline}

However, concerns over sovereignty and regulatory encroachments have
historically prevented full ratification. Many policymakers believe that
accepting UNCLOS without reservation could limit U.S. ability to exploit
marine resources or act unilaterally in its territorial waters.

President Ronald Reagan chose not to sign the UNCLOS in 1982, due to
concerns about specific provisions in Part XI, which governed
deep-seabed mining. Reagan\'s administration feared that the treaty's
provisions on resource exploitation in international waters would limit
the United States\' access to valuable resources, such as minerals on
the ocean floor, and impede the activities of U.S. private companies.

Part XI of UNCLOS established the International Seabed Authority (ISA),
an organization with the power to control mineral-related activities in
the international seabed area and redistribute the proceeds to
developing countries. Reagan saw the ISA's work as contrary to U.S.
economic interests and free-market principles.

The U.S. was also concerned that the treaty's seabed provisions would
effectively transfer technology to other countries, including rival
states, which could diminish the competitive advantage of U.S.
companies.

Despite these concerns, [**[the U.S. acknowledges UNCLOS as a crucial
framework]{.mark}**, [respecting]{.mark} [its rules on freedom of
navigation]{.mark} [and using it as a basis for diplomatic]{.mark}
[negotiations]{.mark} with other maritime nations. [This
ambivalence]{.mark} [underlines the **balancing**]{.mark} **act** [the
U.S. performs between its own]{.mark} maritime [interests]{.mark} [and
global cooperation.]{.mark}]{.underline}

There is an ongoing discussion among policymakers about the future of
the U.S. and UNCLOS. Some have advised reconsidering Reagan's decision
to not ratify UNCLOS, since ratification might enable more U.S. access
to sea mining outside territorial waters.

On August 2, 2007, Russia used a submarine to plant its lag on the
bottom of the Arctic Ocean. **[The goal of this symbolic move was to lay
a claim to the potential oil, gas, and minerals below the Arctic ice.
The]{.underline}** Arctic contains significant amounts of minerals and
hydrocarbons, including an estimated 90 billion barrels of oil and 44
billion barrels of natural gas, long protected by ice. However, the
Arctic region is now warming twice as fast compared to tropical regions,
resulting in less formation of ice during cold periods, faster melting,
and an overall reduction in sea ice. **[[The right to]{.mark} access and
harvest such [minerals]{.mark} and hydrocarbons [depends]{.mark} both
[on]{.mark} customary international law and]{.underline}** [the 1982
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]{.underline}
**[([UNCLOS]{.mark}]{.underline}** or the Convention), Dec. 10, 1982,
1833 U.N.T.S. 397, art. 76. **[[The race a]{.mark}mong nations [to
access]{.mark} what may be found on and under [the seabed]{.mark}
[is]{.mark} significant and more [fraught for the U]{.mark}nited
[States]{.mark} [because]{.mark} it has not become a signatory to
UNCLOS]{.underline}**. As the ice melts, the desire to maximize
certainty regarding its rights under the Arctic Ocean may provide the
impetus needed for the United States to become a party to UNCLOS. This
is particularly true as **[[UNCLOS does not allow nonUNCLOS parties to
explore]{.mark} or exploit the "Area," [the area beyond any country's
individual jurisdiction]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Id. at art. 153. The
Area is believed to have abundant mineral and hydrocarbon resources.
However, **[[as a non-state party, the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[is prohibited from any mining activities on the deep seabed in the
Area]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Although the Arctic Ocean does not
necessarily need to be open to mining, ensuring the certainty of U.S.
rights can be better achieved by signing UNCLOS, which in turn provides
the United States a voice in the Arctic governance for mining activities
and potential protection of the environment. [The United Nations adopted
UNCLOS in 1982 to delineate different countries' jurisdiction over
coastal waters to the high seas. UNCLOS entered into force in 1994 after
60 countries ratiied it. T]{.underline}he Convention establishes a legal
order for the oceans and seas by providing sovereign rights for coastal
states over coastal zones. UNCLOS also promotes the peaceful uses of the
seas and oceans, efficient utilization of resources, conservation of
living resources, and protection and preservation of the marine
environment.

[**[Diplomacy]{.mark} [has never been so]{.mark} [important]{.mark}** as
now, [when we are confronting]{.mark} the most serious crises since the
Second World War: **the global [pandemic]{.mark} [and economic]{.mark}
[collapse]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

When we emerge finally from the grip of the coronavirus, Americans will
need to account for a public-health disaster that has killed well over
100,000 people to date and shuttered nearly every institution in our
society (including Harvard) for much of the spring and into the summer.

But we'll also need to look beyond our borders to assess what went wrong
globally. Why did the World Health Organization---its long and
continuing record of expertise in matters of global health
notwithstanding---not press China more aggressively to tell the truth
about the virus in early January? How should nations be better prepared
for a possible second wave? Can they agree to share a vaccine equitably
among the world's 7.7 billion people? Will the major economies
collaborate to prevent the current recession from turning into another
Great Depression? The answer to these questions will depend in large
measure on our ability to work diplomatically across the world in this
multi-front struggle.

As a former career Foreign Service officer[, I have spent four decades
of my professional life representing the United States overseas and
teaching about America's role as the indispensable power in the
international arena.]{.underline} [For much of that time, the nation
leaned heavily on its unmatched military might---during the Cold War,
after 9/11, and in the Afghan and Iraq wars. Now, with the spread of the
coronavirus to every inhabited continent, [diplomacy's time has come in
the reconstruction of a more]{.mark} [stable and better
world.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Unfortunately, restoring the role of U.S. diplomacy won't be easy. One
early casualty of the pandemic is our plummeting credibility as the
unmatched global power. For the first time since World War II, America
has chosen not to lead in confronting a quintessentially global threat.
With American energy and confidence in short supply, President Donald
Trump is a spectral figure on the world stage as nations struggle to
contain the virus. Instead of leading the G-20 major economies against
the contagion, the world has watched an American president castigate
China for birthing the "Wuhan Virus," pin the blame for the failed
response on the World Health Organization, and---as one of my European
students lamented---fail even to offer a simple word of sympathy in all
those endless news conferences to those dying in Italy and Spain and
other bedrock allies.

[Former Secretary of State Colin Powell has long maintained that
**[America should place its diplomats out in front]{.mark}** ("on point"
in the military vernacular), with the armed forces in reserve, to be
used only when diplomacy fails.]{.underline} Powell's dictum is an
important reminder of how the United States should seek to lead in this
time of pandemic, for the coronavirus is only one of many among a new
type of threat that requires us to lead as much through the power of
diplomacy as through that of the military.

[Many of the students I teach point to [transnational threats that
affect every nation and person on earth]{.mark} as our greatest
challenges: **[climate]{.mark}** change, **[food]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**[water]{.mark}** shortages, **[narcotics]{.mark}** and
**[crime]{.mark}** cartels, [the lack of **cyber** security]{.mark},
[and **pandemics**]{.mark} top the list. [We cannot succeed in
containing them]{.mark} [without]{.mark} forming [diplomatic
alliances]{.mark} among governments, universities, foundations,
businesses, and citizens.]{.underline}

This new brand of diplomacy is not an alternative to the military but
its logical partner in the twenty-first century American arsenal. The
military remains essential to fight terrorists, and to counter rivals
Russia and China and outlaw governments in North Korea and Iran, but
even in these cases we have to have robust diplomacy to achieve our
aims. Even if we deployed the full might of the U.S. military to
eliminate the North Korean and Iranian nuclear programs, and the regimes
that support them, does anyone believe that would, by itself, "solve"
the problem? [Even in those cases, deft, **[multilateral]{.mark}
dipl[omacy will have to play a lead role]{.mark}**---as recent
experience has shown. We can no longer default to force alone, as we
have done so often since 9/11.]{.underline}

as stipulated in Article 153(2).]{.underline}** **[This position cannot
be correct.]{.underline}** The 1994 Agreement, as explained above,
complements and, if there is inconsistency, replaces UNCLOS. The 1994
Agreement has replaced neither the "common heritage of mankind" doctrine
nor Article 153(2). Aware of these provisions, the United States voted
in favor of the 1994 Agreement, although it has yet to ratify it. Under
Article 18 of the Vienna Convention on Law of Treaties, once a state
signs a treaty, it has an obligation not to act against the object and
purpose of the treaty. See Houck, supra, at 18. **[If the United States
were to engage in seabed activities without acceding to UNCLOS and 1994
Agreement, it would be in violation of the 1994
Agreement.]{.underline}** Furthermore, **[given that UNCLOS has been
ratiied by 168 parties, most of its provisions are accepted as customary
international law.]{.underline}** The statute of International Court of
Justice deines customary international law as "evidence of a general
practice accepted as law." See Statute of the International Court of
Justice, art. 38(1)(b), June 26, 1945, 8 U.N.T.S. 993. This definition
consists of two components: state practice and opinion juris. State
practice is the indication of how states behave in a particular
situation. On the other hand, opinion juris requires that such state
practice is "rendered obligatory by the existence of a rule of law
requiring it." See Continental Shelf (Fed. Rep. of Ger. v. Den.; Fed.
Rep. of Ger. v. Neth.), Judgment, 1969 I.C.J. Rep. 3, 44 ¶ 77 (Feb. 20).
The opinion juris is a subjective element, i.e., "the states concerned
must therefore feel that they are conforming to what amounts to a legal
obligation." Id. However, [under the persistent objector rule, a state
that persistently objects to a rule of customary international law from
its formation may not be deemed bound by that rule.]{.underline} See
Olufemi Elias, Persistent Objector, Oxford Pub. Int'l L. (Sept. 2006).
[When voting in favor of the 1994 Agreement, the United States never
raised an objection to the prohibition on non-states parties regarding
seabed activities. [On too many occasions]{.mark}, [the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates also indicated that it [accepts]{.mark} [most of the
provisions of UNCLOS as c]{.mark}ustomary [i]{.mark}nternational
[l]{.mark}aw. All [these factors,]{.mark} in turn, [might be used as
evidence that seabed mining provisions are binding on the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates as customary international]{.underline} law. Houck,
supra, at 18; Baumert, supra, at 852, 857. Therefore, **[[the

A [**breakdown** in the **i**nternational rule of **law** is being
accelerated through rapid **advancement in technology** and artificial
intelligence]{.underline}, which risks a "supercharging" of human rights
violations, according to an annual report, by Amnesty International,
published April 24.

"The [international rules-based order is on the **brink of
collapse**]{.underline}. The violations of international law have been
multiple and have increased, in fact, largely because of the increasing
number of armed conflicts. [Perpetrators not only violate international
law but seek to justify those violations in the name of
**self-defense**, **national security,** or
**counterterrorism**]{.underline}," Amnesty's secretary-general, Agnes
Callamard, told VOA.

Gaza violations

Amnesty highlights the conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza. The
Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza says more than 34,000 people have been
killed, most of them women and children. The figure, which includes
Hamas combatants, cannot be independently verified.

"In a conflict that defined 2023 and shows no sign of abating, evidence
of war crimes continues to mount as the Israeli government makes a
mockery of international law in Gaza. Following the horrific attacks by
Hamas and other armed groups on 7 October, Israeli authorities responded
with unrelenting air strikes on populated civilian areas often wiping
out entire families, forcibly displacing nearly 1.9 million Palestinians
and restricting the access of desperately needed humanitarian aid
despite growing famine in Gaza," the report says.

Amnesty's Callamard said the Gaza conflict had seen "the greatest number
of journalists killed, and the greatest number of humanitarian actors
killed."

Israel strongly denies breaking the Geneva Convention or targeting
civilians, whom it says Hamas uses as human shields. Israel also denies
blocking relief supplies into Gaza despite numerous such accusations
from aid groups.

UN paralysis

Amnesty's report says Israel's [Western allies]{.underline} have failed
to stop the bloodshed, citing "the USA's brazen use of its veto to
paralyse the UN Security Council for months on a much-needed resolution
for a ceasefire, as it continues to arm Israel with munitions that have
been used to [commit]{.underline} what likely amounts to **[war
crimes]{.underline}**."

The United States has repeatedly defended its support for Israel,
asserting that its ally has the right to defend itself following the
October 7 terror attacks by Hamas that killed more than 1,100 people,
with dozens of hostages still being held in Gaza.

Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine

The report also highlights [widespread **human rights abuses** and **law
violations** by Russia in its illegal invasion of
**Ukraine**]{.underline}, including "indiscriminate
[attacks]{.underline} [on]{.underline} densely populated [civilian
areas, as well as energy and grain export infrastructure]{.underline};
and the [use of torture or other ill-treatment against prisoners of
war."]{.underline} Moscow denies such accusations.

The [global order built in the wake of World War II is breaking
down]{.underline}, warned Amnesty's Callamard. "We are witnessing a
rule-based order on the [brink of collapse because the architects of the
1948 system, the architects of that system are failing it and are
failing the people."]{.underline}

Amnesty [highlights a **worsening** civil **conflict in
Sudan**]{.underline}, which it says has [triggered the largest
displacement crisis in the world,]{.underline} with more than 8 million
people forced to flee. The report also highlights China's role in
providing support to Myanmar's military junta, in its war on minority
groups and crackdown on basic human rights.

Big tech and AI

Amnesty also warns of a disturbing convergence of human rights abuses
and technology, including artificial intelligence, or AI.

"In an increasingly precarious world, [**unregulated proliferation** and
deployment of technologies such as **gen**erative **AI**, facial
recognition and **spyware**]{.underline} are poised to be a pernicious
foe -- [scaling up and supercharging violations of international law and
human rights to exceptional level]{.underline}s," the report said.

Amnesty said the [technologies]{.underline} **[pose significant
risks]{.underline}** as huge numbers of people across the globe vote in
elections in 2024.

"Politicians have long used manipulation of 'us vs. them' narratives to
win votes and outmaneuver legitimate questions about economic and
security fears. We've seen how unregulated technologies, such as facial
recognition, have been used [to **entrench
discrimination**]{.underline}."

"Coupled with this, Big Tech's surveillance business model is pouring
fuel on this fire of hate, [enabling those with malintent to hound,
dehumanize and amplify dangerous narratives to consolidate power or
polling]{.underline}. It's a chilling spectre of what's to come as
technological advances rapaciously outpace accountability," the report
said.

and Deep Waters: The United States and Deep Seabed Mining in the
Arctic,\" Natural Resources & Environment 34, no. 2 (Fall 2019): 27-30.
Accessed 6/28/2025.

On August 2, 2007, Russia used a submarine to plant its lag on the
bottom of the Arctic Ocean. [The goal of this symbolic move was to lay a
claim to the potential oil, gas, and minerals below the Arctic ice.
The]{.underline} Arctic contains significant amounts of minerals and
hydrocarbons, including an estimated 90 billion barrels of oil and 44
billion barrels of natural gas, long protected by ice. However, the
Arctic region is now warming twice as fast compared to tropical regions,
resulting in less formation of ice during cold periods, faster melting,
and an overall reduction in sea ice. **[[The right to]{.mark} access and
harvest such [minerals]{.mark} and hydrocarbons [depends]{.mark} both
[on]{.mark} customary international law and]{.underline}** [the 1982
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea]{.underline}
**[([UNCLOS]{.mark}]{.underline}** or the Convention), Dec. 10, 1982,
1833 U.N.T.S. 397, art. 76. **[[The race a]{.mark}mong nations [to
access]{.mark} what may be found on and under [the seabed]{.mark}
[is]{.mark} significant and more [fraught for the U]{.mark}nited
[States]{.mark} [because]{.mark} it has not become a signatory to
UNCLOS]{.underline}**. As the ice melts, the desire to maximize
certainty regarding its rights under the Arctic Ocean may provide the
impetus needed for the United States to become a party to UNCLOS. This
is particularly true as **[[UNCLOS does not allow nonUNCLOS parties to
explore]{.mark} or exploit the "Area," [the area beyond any country's
individual jurisdiction]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Id. at art. 153. The
Area is believed to have abundant mineral and hydrocarbon resources.
However, **[[as a non-state party, the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[is prohibited from any mining activities on the deep seabed in the
Area]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Although the Arctic Ocean does not
necessarily need to be open to mining, ensuring the certainty of U.S.
rights can be better achieved by signing UNCLOS, which in turn provides
the United States a voice in the Arctic governance for mining activities
and potential protection of the environment. [The United Nations adopted
UNCLOS in 1982 to delineate different countries' jurisdiction over
coastal waters to the high seas. UNCLOS entered into force in 1994 after
60 countries ratiied it. T]{.underline}he Convention establishes a legal
order for the oceans and seas by providing sovereign rights for coastal
states over coastal zones. UNCLOS also promotes the peaceful uses of the
seas and oceans, efficient utilization of resources, conservation of
living resources, and protection and preservation of the marine
environment.

#### UNCLOS doesn't allow deep sea mining and actively discourages it.

Doug **Bandow**, 09-20**07**,
<https://cei.org/sites/default/files/Doug%20Bandow%20-%20The%20Law%20of%20the%20Sea%20Treaty.pdf>

Nevertheless, operations might eventually become economically feasible
as technologies evolve and market conditions change. Seabed mining is in
some senses a distant cousin of the undersea oil exploration that is
already occurring in shallower ocean waters. But such **[[developments
are unlikely to go on with the Law of the Seat Treaty in its current
form]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and it may even threaten innovations to
harvest resources such as oil from deeper ocean sources. As noted
previously, the **[[LOST requires sharing the
revenues]{.underline}]{.mark}** of oil drawn from the Outer Continental
Shelf from 200 or more nautical miles beyond U.S. shores. **[[Seven
percent of revenues is a significant levy, heavy enough to discourage
more costly or risky exploration and production]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Today, it is **[[hard to imagine any entrepreneur investing capital
sufficient to create a viable deep seabed mining
operation]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The underwater environment is
forbidding, in ways potentially as challenging as space. The great
depths, incredible pressure, and uneven seabed make the creation of a
workable, let alone an economical, mining operation extremely difficult.
**[[But absent intrusive regulation, entrepreneurs have accomplished the
seemingly impossible before.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### UNCLOS and ISA prevent any unilateral exploitation of resources in international waters

**ISA 7/9**, United Nations body that is responsible for regulating
seabed mining and related activities in the international seabed area,
also known as \"the Area\", 7/9/25, https://www.isa.org.jm/faq-for-media

**\
A.** It is important to state that the [[legal mandate to regulate
mineral-related activities in the seabed]{.mark} beyond coastal
countries' national jurisdictions (the Area) [rests solely with
the]{.mark} International Seabed Authority ([ISA), as enshrined
in]{.mark} the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
([UNCLOS]{.mark})]{.underline}. As a result, [[no private entity or
State may undertake such activities]{.mark} outside this framework
[without contravening the]{.mark} international legal regime, including
[c]{.mark}ustomary [i]{.mark}nternational [l]{.mark}aw]{.underline},
that governs the Area as the common heritage of humankind. [[Any action
outside this multilateral system undermines this
principle]{.underline}]{.mark}. The international legal regime
established [under UNCLOS provides that the Area and its mineral
resources are the common heritage of humankind]{.underline}. Therefore,
the claim or exercise of sovereignty or sovereign rights over any part
of the Area or its resources, and the appropriation, alienation or
exercise of any right with respect to the minerals recovered from the
Area, is prohibited for any State or natural or juridical person
[[unilateral exploitation of resources]{.mark} that [belong to]{.mark}
no single State but to [all of humanity]{.mark} is
prohibited]{.underline} this applies to all States[, whether they are
parties to UNCLOS or not, [and constitutes general international law and
customary international law]{.mark}]{.underline} all activities in the
Area must be conducted under the organization and control of the ISA in
accordance with UNCLOS and the 1994 Agreement States have a duty not to
recognize any claim, acquisition of resources or exercise of rights over
the resources of the Area that is made in any manner other than in
accordance with Part XI of the Convention, the 1994 Agreement and the
rules, regulations and procedures of ISA. [Thus, [any commercial
exploitation]{.mark} outside of national jurisdiction carried out
[without the authorization of ISA would constitute a violation]{.mark}
of international law, from which arises international responsibility.
[Activities outside the]{.mark} international legal [framework would
compromise]{.mark} the integrity of the whole [UNCLOS]{.mark} and the
comprehensive regime it establishes]{.underline}. It would undermine the
legitimacy of the multilateral system, which is essential for the
international community to organize and coordinate its respective rights
and duties in a space that belongs to all. In her *Statement on the
announcement by TMC* in March 2025 during Part I of the thirtieth
session of ISA, the Secretary-General of ISA, Madam Leticia Carvalho,
expressed deep concern over TMC's announcement to seek a US permit for
deep-sea mining, bypassing ISA's established framework. Madam
Secretary-General emphasized that [such [unilateral actions violate
international law and undermine the principle of]{.mark} the seabed as
the [common heritage of humankind]{.mark}, as enshrined in the
UNCLOS]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Madam Secretary-General reaffirmed ISA's
exclusive mandate to oversee all mineral-related activities in the Area
and called for continued multilateral cooperation to ensure that seabed
resources are managed for the benefit of all humanity. Following that
statement, ISA Member States broadly reiterated their commitment to the
ISA and its exclusive role in regulating activities in the Area under
international law. In that sense, it was reassuring to see that
[virtually all States, especially those States that currently have
exploration contracts with [ISA]{.mark} and could have plans to proceed
to the next phases towards exploitation, [strongly rejected the
possibility of acting outside the system and without
ISA.]{.mark}]{.underline} To pause or proceed? This is the current
dilemma facing States and the ISA in relation to DSM exploitation
activities. As the scientific community has gained greater understanding
of the potential impacts of DSM, some States have called for a
"moratorium", "precautionary pause", or a total ban on DSM. On the other
hand, despite the lack of agreed Exploitation Regulations, UNCLOS and
the Implementation Agreement permit applications to be made for
exploitation activities -- a position States Parties to UNCLOS agreed
upon in negotiating these texts. In **Part One** of our three-part
series, we provided an introduction to DSM, its processes, and the
science behind it. **Part Two** analysed the regulatory and legal
frameworks applicable to DSM. In this **Part Three**, we consider the
wider international law issues at play and the landscape of
international and domestic disputes likely to arise in relation to DSM.
Implementing the Implementation Agreement: exploitation in the absence
of regulation As discussed in **Part One** of our series, the science
presents strong evidence for both proponents and opponents of DSM.
Despite the Implementation Agreement permitting applications for
exploitation contracts, the international community's understanding of
the potential impacts of DSM exploitation have evolved over time,
resulting in some States calling for a "moratorium", "precautionary
pause", or a total ban on DSM. On the other hand, some States are ready
to take the plunge and commence DSM exploitation activities. Most
recently, on 24 April 2025, President Donald Trump signed an Executive
Order, to "*restore American dominance in offshore critical minerals and
resources*".^1^ The Executive Order notes that the United States of
America "*must take immediate action to accelerate the responsible
development of seabed mineral resources, quantify the Nation's endowment
of seabed minerals, reinvigorate American leadership in associated
extraction and processing technologies, and ensure secure supply chains
for our defense, infrastructure, and energy sectors*".^2^ In relation to
DSM in the Area, [[the E]{.mark}xecutive [O]{.mark}rder instructs the
Secretary of Commerce to [expedite the process for]{.mark} reviewing and
issuing [seabed mineral exploration licences]{.mark} and commercial
recovery permits, in areas [beyond national jurisdiction]{.mark}, under
the *Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act*.]{.underline} Following the
Executive Order, on 29 April 2025, The Metals Company (**TMC**)
submitted applications to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration for two exploration licences and one commercial recovery
permit (otherwise known as an exploitation licence) under the *Deep
Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act* and National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration implementing regulations, which form the US seabed mining
code.^3^ The application area for the commercial recovery permit, is
25,160 km^2^ in the Clarion Clipperton Zone (**CCZ**).^4^ The
application area for the exploration licences is a combined 199,895
km^2^.^5^ The precise areas applied for (referred to as TMC USA A, B,
and A-A2) for exploration are not publicly known.^6^ However, TMC has
indicated they include "*areas that contain the Company's already
indicated and measured resources,*" suggesting they may overlap with the
ISA exploration licenses held by Nauru Ocean Resources Inc. (**NORI**)
in the CCZ.^7^ These announcements coincided with the ISA's 30th
session. Part One of the 30th session was held in Jamaica at the end of
March 2025, during which "*the Council completed a reading of the
Revised Consolidated Text of the Draft Exploitation Regulations, issued
by the President of the Council in November 2024, covering the Preamble
through draft regulation 55*" and "*negotiations proceeded on a
regulation-by-regulation basis, fostering in-depth discussions among
delegations*".^8^ As discussed in **Part Two** of our series, Part Two
of [[the ISA\'s 30th session]{.mark} is being held this month between 7
to 18 July 2025, [where discussions on agreeing the consolidated text of
the Draft Exploitation Regulations continue]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is
hoped the Draft Exploitation Regulations will be agreed during this
session. Navigating unchartered waters: the legality of pausing or
proceeding with DSM exploitation activities The texts of UNCLOS and the
Implementation Agreement, which explicitly permit exploitation
activities to proceed in the absence of exploitation regulations, create
a tension with the position that several States have advanced calling
for a moratorium on DSM. Proceeding with, or pausing, DSM activities are
both likely to give rise to international law issues that will implicate
both Contractors and States alike. **Legal validity of any moratorium or
precautionary pause What are the legal arguments for a "moratorium" or
"precautionary pause"?** As explained in **Part Two** of our series,
despite the Implementation Agreement permitting applications for
exploitation contracts, the international community's understanding of
the potential impacts of DSM exploitation have evolved over time,
resulting in some States calling for a moratorium on DSM. Those States
seeking to justify a "moratorium" or "precautionary pause" advance two
key arguments: the customary international law "precautionary
principle", a principle that dictates that in the absence of full
scientific certainty, States should take preventative measures to
prevent serious or irreversible damage to the environment, and requires
States to defer exploitation activities until more is known about the
potential harm from these activities to the marine environment; and
Article 145 and Part XII of UNCLOS regulate protection of the marine
environment (including the Area), and oblige States Parties to defer DSM
activities until protecting of the marine environment can be guaranteed.
The precautionary principle has been included in the exploration
regulations and the Draft Exploitation Regulations. The recent
International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (**ITLOS**) advisory
opinion on climate change considered the precautionary principle in the
context of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, and the principle may
be relevant to future DSM regulations and negotiations. In the context
of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, ITLOS stated that "*States
must apply the precautionary approach*" to determine the necessary
measures that they are required to take to regulate marine pollution.
Much earlier, in 2011, the Seabed Disputes Chamber (**SDC**) in its
Advisory Opinion on *Responsibilities and obligations of States with
respect to activities in the Area* noted that the precautionary
principle was on *\"a trend towards \[being\] part of customary
international law\"*.^9^ ITLOS concluded that the obligation to take
measures necessary to protect and preserve the marine environment, is
one of due diligence (see Art 192 UNCLOS). The obligation's contents are
dependent on the specific treaty, however, the standard of the
obligation is stringent and determined by an assessment of the risk and
level of harm combined.^10^ Consequently, ITLOS concluded that *"States
are required to take measures as far-reaching and efficacious as
possible to prevent or reduce the deleterious effects of climate change
and ocean acidification on the marine environment"*.^11^ In the context
of DSM, [[all States must adhere to these]{.mark} stringent due
diligence [obligations, sourced either through UNCLOS or
c]{.mark}ustomary [i]{.mark}nternational [l]{.mark}aw, to ensure that
their activities do not harm the marine environment]{.underline}. The
ITLOS advisory opinion is also important for future DSM activities due
to the explicit recognition that the obligation to conduct environmental
impact assessments is crucial to ensure that activities do not harm the
marine environment. Further, the International Court of Justice
(**ICJ**) is currently considering a request from the General Assembly
to clarify States\' obligations under general international law to
protect the climate system from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions,
including the legal consequences for breaching those obligations. It is
possible that the ICJ's opinion will have an impact on the obligations
of States with respect to DSM, the development of DSM regulations, and
the scope of DSM activities. In light of these UNCLOS provisions and
ITLOS' recent findings, some argue that a precautionary pause or
moratorium is necessary *"to ensure compliance with the environmental
protection imperatives of UNCLOS"*, as *"States must not permit
exploitation to be undertaken if they cannot be confident"* of ensuring
the protection of the marine environment.^12^ **Is a "moratorium" likely
to be permanent?** Where UNCLOS and the Implementation Agreement
currently permit applications for exploitation activities, a moratorium
is unlikely to be permanent, and the ISA has not expressed any intention
that it will implement a moratorium or precautionary pause. However, a
moratorium is not foreign to the law of the sea and environmental
issues. In 1982, faced with calls to consider new scientific research
and led by the anti-whaling movement, the International Whaling
Commission voted to temporarily pause commercial whale killings.
Consequently, a "temporary deferral" of DSM exploitations is not
unprecedented.^13^ **Legality of unregulated exploitation What are the
legal arguments for proceeding with exploitation activities in the
absence of Exploitation Regulations?** As outlined in **Part Two** of
this series, Nauru triggered a two-year process whereby the ISA was to
conclude the Draft Exploitation Regulations. Upon expiration of the
deadline (regardless of whether the Draft Exploitation Regulations have
been agreed), all State Parties to UNCLOS would be permitted to apply
for an exploitation licence. Where the explicit text of UNCLOS and the
Implementation Agreement do not prohibit such activities, imposing a ban
on DSM activities would likely be contrary to the express agreement of
the State Parties in the treaties. Notwithstanding the absence of
Exploitation Regulations, State Parties must adhere to existing
obligations and principles set out in UNCLOS. Article 139 is a key
provision and requires Sponsoring States *"to ensure"* activities in the
Area are carried out with due diligence and in conformity with UNCLOS,
the regulations, the ISA, and contracts. Sponsoring States also have
*"direct obligations"* under UNCLOS and the regulations to assist the
ISA in its exercise of control over activities in the Area (Article
153(4) UNCLOS), to apply a precautionary approach (under Regulation 2 of
the Draft Exploitation Regulations and customary international law), to
apply best environmental practices (under the Sulphides and
Ferromanganese Regulations) and to conduct environmental impact
assessments (under section 1(7) of the Annex to the Implementation
Agreement as well as the Nodule, Sulphides and Ferromanganese
Regulations).^14^ Other provisions of UNCLOS and the Implementation
Agreement relating to DSM may also inform the interpretation of these
provisions, as do the treaties' object and purpose, in accordance with
rules of treaty interpretation (Article 31 Vienna Convention on the Law
of Treaties (**VCLT**)). For example, where the Implementation Agreement
permits State Parties to apply for exploitation licences, the assessment
of that licence application should be informed by the provisions of Part
XII, Part XI and Article 145 of UNCLOS to promote protection of the
marine environment in the Area, and Sponsoring States' due diligence
obligations to supervise their Contractors in the Area. Where DSM
proponents are legally permitted to make exploitation applications, and
can align their activities with the environmental protection
expectations set forth in UNCLOS, then arguably Contractors can proceed
in accordance with international law and a manner that protects the
marine environment. **Does the same legal argument apply to States that
are not parties to UNCLOS and the Implementation Agreement?** While
State Parties are bound by the two treaties, rules and regulations,
non-Parties to UNCLOS and the Implementation Agreement are not bound to
the rules, regulations, and procedures of the ISA. This is particularly
important when considering the position of the United States of
America - a non-Party to UNCLOS, but a signatory to the Implementation
Agreement[. [As a non-Party to UNCLOS]{.mark}, commentators contend that
the United States could assert its entitlement to exploit natural
resources without the ISA's permission]{.underline}. [However, on the
other hand, as a signatory to the Implementation Agreement, under
Article 18(a) of the VCLT, the [United States has an obligation *"to
refrain from acts which would defeat the object and purpose of a
treaty*]{.mark}*"*. Non-Parties have obligations to protect and preserve
the marine environment, because [Article 192 of UNCLOS is part of
c]{.mark}ustomary [i]{.mark}nternational [l]{.mark}aw]{.underline}.^15^
Some commentators argue that *"the normative nature of the* \[common
heritage of mankind\] *along with the widespread participation in*
\[UNCLOS\] *and the* \[Implementation\] *Agreement by states, coastal
and landlocked, including big maritime states with the requisite marine
technology, would appear to lend credence to the view that the concept
of the* \[common heritage of mankind\] *is part of* \[customary
international law\]*'*.^16^ Customary international law binds all States
(except for persistent objectors), regardless of whether that State is
also party to a treaty which imposes that right or obligation. [Where
the principle of the "common heritage of mankind" (discussed in **Part
Two** of this series) is considered customary international law,
[non-Parties to UNCLOS are required to operate in the Area in a manner
that respects the notions of equitable benefit sharing and protection of
the marine environment for all States' use]{.mark}.]{.underline} There
are different views as to whether this entails that States cannot
exploit some of the resources of the Area unilaterally. Some
multinationals domiciled in one non-Party jurisdiction have avoided the
legal uncertainty of non-Parties by acquiring ISA contracts from
subsidiaries in State Parties to UNCLOS. Disputing DSM: disputes and
enforcement of current legal obligations The final crucial question is
how DSM obligations can and will be enforced. UNCLOS governs exploration
and exploitation of the Area and it is the starting point for dispute
resolution relating to DSM activities in the Area, whether before ITLOS,
the SDC or an ad hoc arbitral tribunal, or in a non-binding conciliation
process. For Sponsoring States and their sponsored Contractor, the
contractual dispute settlement mechanism in a Sponsorship Agreement,
typically arbitration, also provides additional recourse for claims
arising in relation to DSM activities or regulation. Finally, for DSM
activities within a State\'s national jurisdiction, national courts also
offer an additional avenue for dispute resolution proceedings.^17^
**Dispute resolution under UNCLOS** UNCLOS, as the framework agreement,
establishes several dispute settlement mechanisms that enable State
Parties, Sponsoring States, Contractors and the ISA to enforce their
rights. Importantly, the dispute settlement mechanisms under UNCLOS
regarding DSM activities can be activated by either proponents or
opponents of DSM. **Dispute settlement avenues for States** States have
a broader range of dispute settlement options compared to Contractors.
First, the SDC has jurisdiction (see Article 187 UNCLOS) to hear
disputes between States, or between a State and the ISA relating to DSM
activities, including Part XI of UNCLOS and the Implementation
Agreement, the ISA's acts or omissions, and work plans and licenses. For
example, a Sponsoring State could potentially commence proceedings
against a State advocating a moratorium on DSM. Similarly, a State Party
(either for or against DSM) could potentially commence a claim against
the ISA for failing to adopt the Exploitation Regulations within the
deadline. Article 188(1) of UNCLOS extends the forums for State Party
disputes, allowing State Parties to bring the dispute in a special
chamber of ITLOS, an ad hoc chamber of the SDC, or a commercial arbitral
tribunal for resolution. Disputes relating to the general interpretation
and application of UNCLOS can be pursued in these forums. For example, a
State may seek to bring a claim against another State for DSM activities
relating to an alleged breach of the marine protection provisions in
Part XII of UNCLOS. **Dispute settlement avenues for Contractors** The
SDC is the sole dispute settlement mechanism for Contractors under
UNCLOS, given its *rationae materiae* jurisdiction in Article 187 of
UNCLOS and Articles 20 and 21 of the Statute of ITLOS. There are four
potential disputes Contractors may seek to bring before the SDC,: • a
Contractor's rights relating to the ISA; • the ISA's acts or omissions
"directed to the other party or directly affecting its legitimate
interests"; • "a refusal to grant a contract or a legal issue arising in
the negotiation of the contract"; and • where the ISA has incurred
liability for damage from its wrongful acts. The SDC can hear disputes
relating to the negotiation and conclusion of contracts, so long as the
dispute does not relate to the ISA exercising its discretionary powers.
To illustrate this point, an unsuccessful applicant could bring a
dispute before the SDC relating to the Legal and Technical Commission's
failure to apply the rules in a uniform and non-discriminatory manner,
as a "misuse of power". Nevertheless, an unsuccessful applicant could
not challenge the ISA's decision to refuse a contract where the
applicant fails to provide adequate information about the mineral
resources and environment. **Dispute resolution under sponsorship
agreements** A sponsorship agreement creates a contractual relationship
between the Contractor and the Sponsoring State, and these agreements do
not fall within the DSM UNCLOS framework.^18^ Rather, a Sponsorship
Agreement is a matter of domestic law of the Sponsoring State. However,
a Sponsoring Party provides a certificate of sponsorship to the ISA to
demonstrate a legal connection between the Sponsoring State and its
contractor. When a Sponsoring State terminates its certificate of
sponsorship, it notifies the ISA and must state the reasons for the
termination. In the absence of a stabilisation clause, UNCLOS does not
provide any mechanism for settlement of disputes between contractors and
Sponsoring States arising out of the termination of a certificate of
sponsorship agreement. Such disputes would need to be resolved through
the dispute resolution provision of the sponsorship agreement and by
national courts. For example, the Sponsorship Agreement between The
Republic of Nauru and Nauru Ocean Resources Inc. (**Nauru Sponsorship
Agreement**) provides an escalating dispute settlement mechanism. In
relation to a dispute *"arising out of or in connection with the
Agreement"* or *"the breach, termination, or validity thereof"*, the
Parties must first seek to negotiate and resolve the dispute, before a
dispute can be settled by arbitration in accordance with the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules.^19^ The escalating mechanism is without prejudice to
either parties' right to seek urgent injunctive, interrogatory, or
declaratory relief from a court of competent jurisdiction. Similarly,
the Sponsorship Agreement between The Kingdom of Tonga and Tonga
Offshore Mining Limited follows the same escalating dispute resolution
process and provides for arbitration in accordance with the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules. In respect of termination, the Nauru Sponsorship
Agreement provides that if Nauru terminates the Sponsorship Agreement,
it must not revoke the Certificate of Sponsorship *"until at least six
months from the date of the Republic Termination Notice"*. Nauru is also
obliged, if requested by Nauru Ocean Resources Inc (**NORI**), to do all
things necessary to maintain sponsorship during this period and assist
NORI to assign its rights. **Domestic dispute resolution** Disputes in
relation to deep sea mining have already borne several cases in domestic
courts. For instance, in 2021, the New Zealand Supreme Court held in
Trans-Tasman Resources Ltd v Taranaki Whanganui Conservation Board
\[2021\] NZSC 127 that a marine consent for seabed mining in New
Zealand\'s Exclusive Economic Zone could not be granted unless the
decision-maker is satisfied that material harm (pollution) to the
environment will be avoided, among other factors. Courting clarity:
where to next? The myriad of unresolved issues associated with DSM
provides scope for significant litigation at both international and
domestic levels. Even if the new target date of July 2025 for the
finalisation of the Draft Exploitation Regulations is not met,
Contractors may submit a mining lease application at any time, operating
without formal Exploitation Regulations. There are significant gaps in
the current legal framework for appropriately litigating disputes
between contractors and Sponsoring States engaged in DSM activities. As
States become increasingly restless with the ISA process, and
appreciating the increasing risk that the Draft Exploitation Regulations
may not be approved in the ISA\'s next session, States could move to
clarify the scope and legal obligations relating to DSM activities
through strategic international litigation. For example, States have
recently relied on advisory opinions to clarify issues relating to
States' obligations and the environment, including the marine
environment. [[States could seek]{.mark} an advisory [opinion from ITLOS
or the SDC]{.mark} to further clarify States and contractors'
obligations [with respect to DSM activities]{.mark}, particularly [in
the absence of Exploitation Regulations]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Alternatively, a State, or group of States, could pursue contentious
proceedings against the ISA for failing to adopt the Draft Articles
within the deadline, or for refusing to approve an exploitation contract
in the absence of agreed regulations. It is hoped that the Draft
Exploitation Regulations will be agreed soon, establishing a clearer
remedial mechanism to provide certainty to both Sponsoring States and
contractors.

role The debate around deep-sea mining is heating up as the world
searches for materials for electric vehicles and other renewable energy
technologies without disturbing land and critical watersheds. The
process involves using remote-controlled vehicles to retrieve "nodules,"
or potato-sized mineral-rich rocks found on the ocean floor along flat
expanses, vents and underwater mountains.It's up to ISA, a little-known
international agency, to determine how fast --- and under what
conditions --- companies and countries can mine. But without ratifying
the treaty, the U.S. cannot be a member of ISA, nor can it apply for or
obtain a contract or license to mine the seabed in international waters,
either on behalf of the federal government or a private company, said
Matt Gianni, political and policy adviser for the Deep Sea Conservation
Coalition. International Seabed Authority Council meeting. A meeting of
the International Seabed Authority Council in Kingston, Jamaica, this
year. While the U.S recognizes the treaty as codifying "customary
international law" and participates in the negotiations at ISA, it does
so only as an observer, Gianni noted. "The [U.S.]{.mark} could
[go]{.mark} it [alone and authorize mining]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the
[international seabed]{.mark} area, but that [[would **cause**]{.mark}
**a [major diplomatic row]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} most of the [rest of

U.S.]{.mark} argument in [support]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [upholding]{.mark}

"For example, the U.S. position in support of recognizing the maritime
boundaries under the UNCLOS of all countries bordering the South China
Sea." Louisa Casson, global project leader for Greenpeace's Stop Deep
Sea Mining campaign, agreed and said **[that [without ratifying]{.mark}

[to]{.mark} [be]{.mark} a [sponsoring state]{.mark} [for

waters]{.underline}**. "So it would only be able to get involved in
deep-sea mining within U.S. waters or via processing, but never a
sponsoring state," Casson said. As it stands, Canada-based Metals Co.
has said it plans to seek permission to begin mining a massive,
mineral-rich expanse of the Pacific Ocean between Hawaii and Mexico in
the so-called Clarion-Clipperton Zone, more than 1,000 miles off the
U.S. Western Seaboard. Metals Co., which plans to submit an application
with ISA sometime after July of next year, is sponsored by the Pacific
island nation of Nauru, which has a long history of phosphate mining.
Last summer, Nauru invoked a legal provision that compels ISA to
finalize new deep-sea mining rules this month. 'No-brainer' Despite
years of persistent Republican opposition, a packaged agenda and
elections nearing, co-signers of Murkowski's resolution are holding out
hope. King said he's angling for a deal next year: "It's important, so
we're going to keep trying." Van Hollen concurred: "It is very much in
our national interest ... which is why Senator Murkowski's bill seems
like a no-brainer, but there seems to be some Republican phobia to any
kind of international agreement even though those are clearly in our
interest." A number of House Republicans called on Secretary of Defense
Lloyd Austin in a letter earlier this month to develop a plan to address
the [[national security implications]{.underline} of China's

restrict exports of EV battery metals like graphite, as well as gallium

Our new Cold War has its first major sea battle. 

The Financial Times reported on Monday that [[China and Russia]{.mark}
are [challenging an area o]{.mark}f seabed that the [US]{.mark} wants to
[claim to]{.mark} pursue [deep-sea mining]{.mark}.]{.underline} Previous
arguments have revolved around whether anyone should be deep-sea mining
at all, given the risk to ecosystems. Now, we're moving on to the "who
gets to potentially damage the ecosystems first" stage of the debate.

Entrenched Sides

Deep-sea mining is starting to turn from theory into industrial reality.
It involves sending machines to the seafloor to pick up nodules ---
mineral deposits the size of a potato --- that have formed over millions
of years. These nodules contain minerals such as cobalt, nickel, and
manganese, which are extremely valuable to the battery-building
industry, making them just as valuable to the electric vehicle industry.

While some countries including Germany and France have argued that no
one should be mining these nodules, China, the US, and a few others are
raring to go.

Exactly where you can prospect for ultra-valuable potatoes is dictated
by a 1982 UN treaty called UNCLOS (the United Nations Convention on the
Law of the Sea). T[he [US has never]{.mark} [ratified
UNCLOS]{.mark}]{.underline}, and China (ratified in 1996) and Russia
(ratified in 1997) are using that as a wedge issue:

Per the FT, the US said last December it was looking to extend its
marine area of jurisdiction to include a particularly mineral-rich area
that lies on its continental shelf. While a source said nations have the
right to try to expand their jurisdictions, [[China and Russia are
pushing]{.mark} [back]{.mark} [by arguing]{.mark} that the [US doesn't
have that right]{.mark} without ratifying UNCLOS]{.underline}.

For some US lawmakers, there is an immediate concern that if the country
doesn't get into deep-sea mining in a big way, China will dominate the
field and control a crucial part of the battery supply chain.

The Wind in China's Sails: [[China]{.mark} has [been particularly active
in trying to get deep-sea mining]{.mark} [off the ground]{.mark}, but it
also has more ground to make up]{.underline}. When UNCLOS was signed, it
introduced "exclusive economic zones" for each country which extend 200
nautical miles from their coasts. The US ended up getting 12.4 million
square miles of ocean compared to China's 900,000. So squabbles over
jurisdiction could get pretty heated --- to say nothing of the vast
swathes of open ocean that at least for the moment remain unclaimed by
any country.

#### The link [turns]{.underline} case. Violating UNCLOS and the ISA [emboldens]{.underline} China and Russia

//adiiiiG

In recent years, [[d]{.mark}eep-[s]{.mark}ea [m]{.mark}ining has emerged
as a [polarizing issue in the Pacific Islands]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
the nascent [industry is [not yet regulated]{.mark}]{.underline}. Now
the [[region is contending with]{.mark} another challenge]{.underline}:
the [potential [breakdown of international rules]{.mark} that might be
the marine environment's last defense]{.underline}.

The Pacific seabed is estimated to hold billions of dollars worth of
manganese, cobalt, copper, and nickel, which are used to make
smartphones, batteries for electric vehicles, and solar panels, and
which are also crucial to the defense and aerospace industries. 

But mining these resources would disrupt ocean ecosystems, including
endangering thousands of undiscovered species. Polymetallic nodules --
lumps of minerals that accrue on the seabed over millions of years --
cannot be removed from the ocean floor without disturbing large amounts
of sediment, the surrounding environment, and the creatures that live on
the nodules themselves.

According to a study conducted in 2023, deep-sea mining could also
threaten tuna fisheries, which many Pacific Island countries depend on
for food and economic revenue. A study published in March showed that an
area of the Pacific sea floor where a mining test was conducted in 1979
has still not recovered.

More and more Pacific Island countries and territories are calling for a
moratorium on deep-sea mining, warning about its effects on the health
of the ocean. In 2019, Papua New Guinea announced a 10-year pause on
mining in its own waters, sparking calls for a Pacific-wide moratorium.

The idea gained traction in the following years. By 2023, Fiji, Palau,
Samoa, Vanuatu, and New Zealand were all voicing support for a
moratorium in international waters. In 2024, Tuvalu joined them, with
the Marshall Islands calling for a precautionary approach to the
industry. 

Several non-independent Pacific Islands have banned seabed mining in
their waters, including French Polynesia in 2022, Hawai'i in 2024,
and New Caledonia in May.

Meanwhile, the Cook Islands, Kiribati, Nauru, and Tonga have promoted
deep-sea mining as a potential source of revenue. (That isn't to say
that civil society is on board: Cook Islands environmental groups, in
particular, have raised concerns about the industry and criticized their
government's position on the issue.)

In February, in a major shock to its close partner New Zealand, the Cook
Islands signed an agreement with Beijing to "strengthen collaboration on
seabed mineral research." In March, a Kiribati government official said
that the country had discussed with China "potential collaboration for
the sustainable exploration of the deep ocean resources."

Nauru and Tonga both have agreements with Canadian firm The Metals
Company, which is seeking to mine in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, an
area of international waters spanning 4.5 million square kilometers
between Hawai'i and Mexico.

Although countries can mine within their own national jurisdiction, the
Clarion-Clipperton Zone is under the administration of the International
Seabed Authority (ISA), a U.N. agency that governs mineral resources in
international waters. 

The ISA has granted 31 exploration contracts in the Clarion-Clipperton
Zone: China holds five, and the Cook Islands, Nauru, and Tonga each hold
one. However, the ISA has not approved any mining licenses because its
member states have not yet agreed on regulations covering the industry:
there are plans to set these rules in 2025.

As ISA members negotiate over these regulations, which will have major
implications for the marine environment, a new challenge is emerging:
access to critical minerals on the Pacific sea floor is becoming another
part of geopolitical competition between China and the United States,
and Washington may break international rules to try to win.

In April, U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order
directing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
to grant permits for deep-sea mining "in areas beyond national
jurisdiction," which would bypass the ISA. The United States has not
ratified the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and
therefore is not a member of the ISA, whereas most other countries in
the world, including China, have ratified UNCLOS.

Immediately, The Metals Company applied for a commercial license from
the U.S. government to mine in international waters, flouting the
authority of the ISA. 

According to ISA secretary-general Leticia Carvalho, ["[Any unilateral
action]{.mark} would [constitute a violation of international law
and]{.mark} directly [undermine the fundamental principles of
multilateralism]{.mark}, the peaceful use of the oceans [and]{.mark} the
[collective governance framework established under
UNCLOS.]{.mark}"]{.underline}

Cynthia Mehboob, an expert on undersea cables at the Australian
Strategic Policy Institute, wrote last month that "[[discarding
multilateral frameworks]{.mark}... would [enable China, Russia]{.mark}
and others [to justify departures from seabed governance]{.mark} norms.
The outcome would be a [patchwork of self-authorized claims,]{.mark}
[eroding oversight and reduced protections]{.mark} for some smaller
Pacific states advocating for a moratorium on seabed
mining]{.underline}."

The region knows it. Te Ipukarea Society, a Cook Islands environmental
group, released statements last week condemning Trump's executive order.
"The arrogance of Donald Trump to think that he can break international
law by authorizing deep seabed mining in international waters is
astounding," said Kelvin Passfield, the society's technical director. 

"The United States cannot pick and choose which aspects of the United
Nations Law of the Sea it will follow, and which ones it will ignore.
This is the action of a bully," he added.

Washington has long claimed that it is a better partner than Beijing
because it upholds the international rules-based order. Encouraging a
breakdown of international rules governing deep-sea mining would further
damage U.S. relations with the Pacific Islands, complicate efforts to
protect the marine environment, and hand China an easy win.

Although Trump's executive order is widely seen as an [[attempt to
challenge China's dominance in]{.mark} the critical [minerals]{.mark}
sector]{.underline}, it [could [achieve]{.mark} the [exact
opposite]{.mark}, [opening up a free-for-all]{.mark} in [which]{.mark}
it is actually [easier for China to access deep-sea
resources]{.mark}.]{.underline}

As usual when bigger countries break the rules, it is smaller countries,
and the Pacific Ocean itself, that will pay the price.

1930, 1958, and 1960 at developing a widely accepted multilateral
framework on oceans law had either ended in utter failure or achieved
only modest gains. [In contrast, **[UNCLOS]{.mark} [contributes directly
to]{.mark} [international peace and security]{.mark},** [by]{.mark}
[replacing abundant **conflicting**]{.mark} **[maritime claims
with]{.mark}** universally agreed limits on coastal-state sovereignty
and jurisdiction.]{.underline} The treaty is anchored in a set of
navigational regimes that establish common expectations, delineating the
rights and duties of flag, port, and coastal states. Even though some
state parties occasionally propose rules that evidence unorthodox
misreadings of the convention---such as China's bogus security claims in
the East China and Yellow seas---[[UNCLOS]{.mark} [has served as a
stabilizing force]{.mark}, **[a framework that protects]{.mark} [and
promotes]{.mark}** the principal American interest in freedom of the
seas. In doing so the **[multilateral]{.mark} [agreement,]{.mark}**
which now has more than 155 state parties, picked the international
community out of what D. P. O'Connell once described as an "intellectual
morass" in which competing opinions and views served as a substitute for
law. As a result, the number of controversies in the oceans has
declined.20]{.underline}

[Last month, the [Trump]{.mark} administration [hosted the signing of a
peace agreement to resolve]{.mark} [one of the world's longest-standing
conflicts between the Democratic]{.mark} [Republic of the Congo and
Rwanda]{.mark}. The agreement, brokered by the United States with
support from Qatar, is expected to announce commitments to resolve
decades-long issues on **disarmament, border integrity, paramilitary
groups**, **economic integration**, and the **return of refugees** and
**humanitarian access** to the region.]{.underline}

This is a historic moment for two African states eager to transition
into a new era of stability and prosperity, and an opportunity to signal
to the world where the continent's future is focused[. [This agreement
is]{.mark} also [evidence]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [where]{.mark} President
[Trump is focused**: facilitating the mechanics and politics to end
"endless wars"**]{.mark} **[and]{.mark} [welcome]{.mark} an era of
[peace]{.mark} for those who want it.**]{.underline}

[Throughout his campaign, President **[Trump promised a commitment to
peace]{.mark}** --- determined to continue the successes from his first
term, like the Abraham Accords, which confronted generational issues
with a bold, American-led declaration. His second term has opened a
pathway for mediation for countries willing to lean into **America's
unique role as peacemaker.**]{.underline} [Every deliberation is
different and results are rarely immediate, of course, but at **present,
[the U.S.-led negotiation]{.mark} [between]{.mark} [the Congo and Rwanda
is commendable.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[In a moment that should enjoy bipartisan acclaim, this peace agreement
signing is the result of an effective presidency and is significant for
several reasons.]{.underline}

[First, the deal provides resolution to a conflict underway for more
than 30 years]{.underline}, one marked by the 1994 Rwandan genocide of
nearly 1 million ethnic Tutsis and continuing since to encompass
fighting over territory, security and control of natural resources. The
violence (or continuous threat thereof) stunted any sense of stability
for an Eastern Congolese region facing issues like food insecurity and
infrastructure challenges, and susceptible to an ever-present Ebola
risk. [The peace agreement can be a difference-maker to address these
issues, and offers real potential for the region's development
aspirations.]{.underline}

[Second, **[the]{.mark} [agreement underscores the White House's
commitment to a campaign promise]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [pursuing an end to
the world's]{.mark} ongoing [wars]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is
particularly important to Africa, where clashes elsewhere impact U.S.
national and economic security interests and create the conditions for
terrorism, extremism, famine and migration crises. Though the U.S. may
not play a role in every situation, [the Congo-Rwanda example
demonstrates that the **U.S. can productively engage in any situation
where parties are willing.**]{.underline}

A huge majority of respondents foresees proliferation: [Eighty-four
percent say that at least one currently non-nuclear state will obtain
these weapons by 2034.]{.underline} The most likely country, cited by 73
percent of experts, is Iran, but considerable numbers also expect Saudi
Arabia (40 percent), South Korea (25 percent), and Japan (19 percent) to
join the nuclear club. These numbers are similar to the results from
last year's survey, but one difference is worrying. In the survey
conducted at the end of 2022, on average respondents thought that 1.4
new actors would have nuclear weapons within a decade. This has now
risen to 1.7. Though this may seem like a small increase, it suggests
that compared with 2022, experts now believe nuclear weapons will spread
more quickly---about 21 percent more quickly, in fact.

\<\<FIGURE OMMITTED\>\>

[When asked about which actors they expect [to]{.mark} actually [use a
nuclear weapon]{.mark} within the next ten years, 20 percent of our
experts said a **[terrorist]{.mark} [group]{.mark}**]{.underline}---up
from just 3 percent last year. [In this year's survey we included
terrorist groups explicitly among our multiple-choice options whereas in
last year's we included a more general "**[other state or a non-state
actor]{.mark}**" option, which may account for some of the
year-over-year difference.]{.underline} But the fact that one in five
respondents is forecasting such an alarming scenario is still noteworthy
and concerning. [Around 14 percent of respondents expect **[Russia to
use a nuclear weapon]{.mark}** by 2024, while roughly 15 percent
forecast that North Korea will do so.]{.underline} But on a more
positive note: More than 60 percent of respondents believe nuclear
weapons won't be used over the coming decade.

treaties acts as a pillar for fostering cooperation and averting
disputes.11 Furthermore, [[International judicial
bodies]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as the International Court of Justice
(ICJ), [[play]{.mark} a [pivotal role in]{.mark} interpreting and
[enforcing]{.mark} treaty [obligations]{.mark}]{.underline}. [States can

### Turns Case---2NC/1NR---Environment 

#### International law fosters effective collaboration on environmental issues

**Aumont '20**, \[Laetitia Aumont is a Policy Officer on Circular and
Carbon Neutral Built Environment and has a master's degree in
international law; 10/30/20; "What role does international law play in
environmental issues?"
https://www.cyis.org/post/what-role-does-international-law-play-in-environmental-issues\]
md

Since 1972 and the Stockholm Conference -- which marked the first
coherent and concerted environmental effort -- [[environmental]{.mark}
[matters]{.mark} have [become]{.mark} more and [more present]{.mark} on
the international stage]{.underline} and [[environmental
rights]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[been]{.underline}]{.mark}
increasingly [[consecrated in treaties]{.underline}]{.mark}. In 2015,
the Paris Agreement is the most recent example of this will to
[[tackle]{.underline}]{.mark} global environmental issues such as
[[**climate change** through]{.mark} **[i]{.mark}**nternational
**[law]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Since May 2018, the "Towards a Global Pact for the Environment"
Resolution by the United Nations General Assembly has been under
negotiation. It represents an overarching legal instrument that could
further the protection of the environment. The Pact aims to be a
founding text that would enshrine rights and general principles
regarding the environment (in the manner of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights). For the time being, such a text does not yet exist: there
exists on the one hand political declarations such as the Rio
Declaration, but without any binding reach; or, on the other hand, very
specific and sectoral treaties, not promoting general principles and
rights, highly technical and not easily accessible by every citizen.

The adoption of such a [treaty [is crucial]{.mark} to strengthen
environmental protection]{.underline}. Indeed, recent decisions have
emphasised the [[law's pivotal role in enforcing]{.mark} already
existing environmental policies]{.underline}.\[2\]The impact of the
adoption of such a Global Pact would be very concrete and practical, as
it would [[provide]{.mark} a strong [basis for legal
action]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially in countries where these rights
are not yet enshrined. [One could [then]{.mark} imagine
that]{.underline} [[a **proliferation of actions**]{.mark} [would
**ensue**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Take, for example, the Urgenda case in
the Netherlands where citizens are legally obliged to adopt more
restrictive measures on CO2 emissions on the basis of Article 2 of the
European Convention on Human Rights consecrating the general principle
of the right to life (later stretched by the Court to find a right to a
healthy environment).

International environmental law: a not so holistic framework

Sometimes, a treaty is not the best solution to deal with an
international issue. Negotiating a treaty implies a certain bureaucracy,
which adheres to rigid contracting and sovereignty costs, and very
little room for manoeuvre and compromise. [When it comes to very
sensitive and pressing issues such as the environmental ones, it can be
very difficult for States to reach an agreement]{.underline}. A striking
example of the limitations of [**[i]{.mark}**nternational
**[law]{.mark}**]{.underline} can be found in the example of plastic
pollution in the oceans. In this regard, a "plastic treaty" will, in
fact, be [[more effective than]{.mark} the actual [fragmented regime
to]{.mark} [regulate]{.mark} plastic [pollution]{.mark} in the
oceans.]{.underline} However, [[in order for]{.underline}]{.mark} it to
be put into [[action]{.underline}]{.mark}, it would [[need to be]{.mark}
[**ratified** by the **international community**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
As such, consensus has not yet been reached on this idea.

Moreover, another flaw in international law lies in its inherent
structure: it has been designed by States, for States, and thus non
state-actors -- such as corporations --cannot be bound by such legal
instruments. In this regard, multinationals, subject to national law,
often choose to carry out their activities through subsidiaries in
countries that are not parties to international environmental
agreements. Given the growing international importance of enterprises
and the fact that their activities can have a greater impact on the
environment than States, one could argue that it is essential to extend
international law and to address this environmental governance gap.

Looking to the South China Sea, it becomes evident that **[no country is

After decades of negotiations, no joint agreements for a standardized
Code of Conduct have been reached among the ASEAN members.212
Accordingly, **[established international [laws enshrined under]{.mark}

States and its allies understand these geopolitical implications and are
deploying Freedom of Navigation operations across the disputed waterways
at a higher rate than ever.216 As a result, resolving the clash between
these two competing legal frameworks rests upon these pivotal inquiries:
Which legal provisions regulate the South China Sea? Which jurisdiction
will ultimately prevail? And which legal system shall civilians adhere
to?217

#### Challenging Chinese maritime claims and supply chain dominance causes them to backlash with lawfare which crashes international norms and causes grey zone escalation

Rules-Based Order, 55 Loy. U. Chi. L. J. 8,
https://lawecommons.luc.edu/luclj/vol55/iss5/2/, (2024). 31-33.

Instead of adhering to the Award[, [Beijing engaged in
"lawfare]{.underline}]{.mark}"139 [by enacting various domestic
laws]{.underline} reinforcing its maritime claims.140 [[In an effort
to]{.underline}]{.mark} legitimize the nine-dash line, these laws
[[introduce ambiguities]{.mark} regarding maritime boundaries [and
expand]{.mark} China's [influence over disputed
zones]{.mark},]{.underline} directly challenging UNCLOS and
[[contradicting the]{.mark} established norms of the [rules-based
order]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}141 For example, the Supreme
People's Court has stated that the Chinese courts' jurisdiction extends
to all areas under the nation's "sovereign control," including the
islands in dispute.142 This regulation, [if [fully implemented,]{.mark}
[would]{.mark} directly [undermine the]{.mark} role of [international
courts and]{.mark} arbitral [tribunals]{.mark} under UNCLOS to hear and
adjudicate any future maritime disputes]{.underline} arising out of the
South China Sea. Moreover, [its restructuring of several maritime law
enforcement agencies allows China to strategically manage and control
the disputed territories at sea.1]{.underline}43 To further controvert
the enforceability of the Award, [[Beijing]{.mark} passed the Coast
Guard Law of the People's Republic of China and the Maritime Traffic
Safety Law i]{.underline}n 2021,144 [which [emboldened Chinese law
enforcement]{.mark}]{.underline} with the authority
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} regulate waterways and [[intimidate
neighboring states]{.underline}]{.mark} if they were to sail into
China's claimed territories.145 Although Beijing argues that these
domestic regulations align with international laws, legal experts have
concluded that the majority of these provisions conflict with UNCLOS and
the Award.146 [To enforce its domestic maritime laws, [China has]{.mark}
resorted to the [use of physical force]{.mark} against other states'
vessels [and coercion of civilians to follow its preferred
order]{.mark}.]{.underline} Over the past few years, the Chinese
People's Liberation Army Navy ([PLA Navy) has repeatedly encroached upon
other coastal states' EEZ]{.underline}. The [[PLA Navy was]{.mark} also
[involved in]{.mark} numerous [intentional collisions and]{.mark}
deliberate [harassment]{.mark} of Japanese, Vietnamese, and the
Philippine fishing vessels]{.underline} across the South China Sea.147
In tightening its grip over the maritime region, China also has
established research stations, created new administrative districts, and
named geographic features within the disputed territories.148 In fact,
China has transformed many of these former "rocks" features into fully
militarized islands, arming them with advanced military defensive and
offensive equipment.149 An American Indo-Pacific Commander described
[[this a]{.mark}s "[the largest military buildup since world war two
\[]{.mark}sic\] by the PRC]{.underline}."150 Since the issuance of the
Award, [China's actions demonstrate that it has managed to underpin the
legitimacy of its nine-dash line, enabling the country to possess and
control one of the most desirable waterways in the
world]{.underline}.151 The consequences of these developments reveal
that [[China has]{.mark} largely [succeeded in]{.mark} deflecting
attention from the rulings and rendering the Tribunal's decisions
irrelevant, [indicating]{.mark} that [it is unwavering in opposing the
existing rules-based order]{.mark} under UNCLOS]{.underline}.152
Instead, [[through the enactment of]{.mark} [domestic laws]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} the use of [military force over]{.mark} the
years,153]{.underline} Beijing has steadily attained substantial
strategic, economic, and military advantages over the U.S. and
surrounding claimants, seeking to infringe, weaken, and alter general
principles of international law.154 As a result, the present
circumstances in the South China Sea are vastly different from those
envisioned by the UNCLOS drafters and its parties.

explicitly recognizing the significance of each state's growing power in
strategic documents.

The Arctic has experienced unprecedented high temperatures in recent
years and continues to melt, opening summer navigation routes and making
resources available that have not been easily accessible in the past.15
This, of course, has opened international discourse concerning which
states have rights to what resources in the Arctic. In the U.S. Senate's
Committee on Foreign Relations hearings in 2012, both then--Secretary of
State Hillary Clinton and Secretary of Defense Leo Panetta stressed the
opportunities that are waiting in the Arctic.16 [While the United States
is a member of the Arctic Council, it is the only member that is not a
signatory of UNCLOS[, putting it at a disadvantage]{.mark}]{.underline}
as the convention will have the ultimate say on how resource and
maritime claims are decided.17 Russia has already attempted to claim
much of the Arctic, sending its own submarines to the North Pole and
planting a flag on the ocean bottom as a symbol of its claim, which is
widely disputed.18 When the United States refutes such claims on the
basis of international law, [Russia and China point out that it has no
legal standing because it has not ratified UNCLOS.]{.underline} The cost
of doing so is nonexistent, and the reward is the ability to check
Russia more effectively.

[In the S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea, a
graver situation has developed involving territorial conflict between
China and at least five other nations. [China began making artificial
islands]{.underline} in 2013, developing 3,200 acres of artificial
landmass that it used [to claim additional airspace, territorial waters,
and a larger exclusive economic zone (EEZ)]{.underline} that overlaps
those of other states who are party to UNCLOS. The United States has
challenged China's claims, again with the aim of containing Beijing's
influence over South East Asia. Like Russia, however[[, China sees no
reason to respect the U.S. position because it is not a signatory of
UNCLOS.]{.underline}]{.mark}19 Some may argue that a continuous display
of U.S. naval strength in China's backyard (through freedom of
navigation operations) is enough [[to counter Chinese
hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark}. But [[diplomatic]{.mark} [power]{.mark}
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} just as [[important]{.underline}]{.mark},
especially because other smaller and less powerful nations in the region
need help that the United States is challenged to give as an outsider to
UNCLOS. In fact, one may argue that during the past 20 years, Washington
has relied so heavily on military strength that U.S. soft power has
diminished. Being on the outside of the international community has
further emboldened revisionist powers such as China and Russia.

U.S. Military Position

Since the convention was adopted in 1982, every Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff has supported its ratification.20 Although there were
initial concerns regarding a threat to national security, they were
never grounded in evidence, and it has been argued by many that the
treaty would increase the capabilities of the U.S. Navy. The Navy Judge
Advocate General supports UNCLOS, stating:

[[The Convention is in the national interest of the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates because [it establishes stable
maritime]{.mark} [zones]{.mark},]{.underline} including a maximum outer
limit for territorial seas; codifies innocent passage, [transit passage,
and archipelagic [sea lanes passage rights]{.mark};]{.underline} works
against "jurisdictional creep" by preventing coastal nations from
expanding their own maritime zones; [[and reaffirms sovereign]{.mark}
[immunity of warships]{.mark}, [auxiliaries and government
aircraft]{.mark}]{.underline}.21

This sentiment was echoed by then--Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
General Martin Dempsey, U.S. Army, in his 2012 statement before the
Senate Committee on Foreign Relations: "[Joining the Convention [would
strengthen our ability to apply sea power]{.mark}]{.underline}. . . . It
reinforces the sovereign immunity of our warships as they conduct
operations. . . . We currently rely on customary international law and
assert it through our physical presence." Dempsey added that the [[U.S.
failure to ratify UNCLOS]{.mark} [enables]{.mark} the
[disagreeable]{.mark} [behavior of adversaries]{.mark} and thus
[allows]{.mark} a [greater possibility for escalation of regular
military operations into more dire situations.]{.mark}]{.underline}22

**[The Uncertainty Surrounding the U.S. Continental Shelf]{.underline}**
Coastal states that are not parties to UNCLOS, such as **[the United
States, can still claim an extended continental shelf under customary
international law but with much less certainty than if they acceded to
UNCLOS]{.underline}**. Coastal states claiming an extended continental
shelf [must submit relevant information and data to the Commission on
the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS]{.underline}). See UNCLOS,
Annex II, art. 4. CLCS recommends delineation of the continental shelf;
[each coastal state then establishes its outer continental shelf limits
based on these recommendations, which makes the limits "final and
binding."]{.underline} UNCLOS, supra, art. 76(8). Annex II, Article 3
allows all coastal states to submit their extended continental shelf
claims to the CLCS. Because of this, the United States can submit its
extended continental shelf claims to the CLCS without being a party. See
Kevin A. Baumert, The Outer Limits of the Continental Shelf under
Customary International Law, 111 Am. J. of Int. Law 827, 866 (2017).
**[Nevertheless, American oil [companies support]{.mark} the ratiication
[of UNCLOS because it will allow them to secure their bids in
the]{.mark} [o]{.mark}uter [c]{.mark}ontinental [s]{.mark}helf
[and]{.mark} the [seabed]{.mark} area[. Becoming a party would maximize
legal certainty]{.mark} [regarding the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates'
rights [in]{.mark} [the Arctic]{.mark} continental shelf and
seabed.]{.underline}** Despite not being a party, the United States has
made statements and taken actions regarding the continental shelf that
are consistent with UNCLOS. On November 17, 1987, the United States
declared that if it were to accede to UNCLOS, it would use Article 76
(1--7) of UNCLOS to designate its outer continental shelf claims. See
"United States Policy Governing the Continental Shelf of the United
States of America," reproduced in J.A. Roach & R.W. Smith, Excessive
Maritime Claims 189 (3d ed. 2012). The United States is also collecting
information through a study conducted by the U.S. Extended Continental
Shelf Project (ECSP) in accordance with technical methods established in
UNCLOS Article 76. Moreover, the United States has committed to making
payments to further its claim to the extended continental shelf. States
with an extended continental shelf are required to make payments to the
International Seabed Authority (ISBA or Authority) based on the revenues
derived from mineral resource exploitation beyond 200 nautical miles.
UNCLOS, supra, art. 82. The Convention does not differentiate between
the payment obligation between state or non-state parties to UNCLOS. As
a non-state party to UNCLOS, the United States is required to make
payment for its exploitation activities on its extended continental
shelf. In fact, the U.S. government has already stipulated this royalty
payment requirement in its calls for bids for exploitation of its
continental shelf beyond 200 nm. See Bureau of Ocean and Energy

### UNCLOS / International Norms Unenforceable 

#### China refuses to follow on to international norms contrary to their position---public smear campaigns and academic delegitimization of decisions

The Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General of the United
Nations expressed no position regarding the legal and procedural merits
of the Award or the disputed claims.128 Instead of affirming the
validity of the Tribunal's jurisdiction and its substantive rulings, the
Secretary-General urged all claimants to continue consultations in
pursuit of a "Code of Conduct."129 These **[contradicting responses from
national governments and intergovernmental institutions reflected the
arduous obstacles in enforcing a non-appealable award and demonstrated
the looming threats to the credibility of the rules-based order within
the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}** region. **[If the Award fails to alter
China's behavior in the long term, it will undoubtedly signal to the
global community that adherence to general principles of international
law is non-compulsory and entirely optional]{.underline}**. [Such a
stance would be detrimental to the perception of UNCLOS as the primary
legal mechanism in ensuring lawful use of the seas and settling maritime
disputes]{.underline}.130 1. China's Denial of UNCLOS and the 2016 South
China Sea Award Having signed and ratified UNCLOS, it was incumbent upon
China to comply with the Award accordingly.131 However, even years after
the conclusion of the proceedings, **[China persistently challenges the
Tribunal's jurisdiction and rejects the enforceability of the verdict
through its "Four No's" policy: "(1) no acceptance, (2) no
participation, (3) no recognition, and (4) no implementation of the
South China Sea Arbitration.]{.underline}**"132 Specifically, in its
extensive 500-page position paper titled "The South China Sea
Arbitration Award: A Critical Study" (Paper) released in 2018, the
Chinese Society of International Law maintained that the Tribunal did
not have jurisdiction to properly decide legal issues of territorial
sovereignty and boundaries between parties. The Paper contended that the
Tribunal erroneously resolved the claims in the Philippines' favor based
on groundless facts and unwarranted legal applications of the
Convention.133 As such, **[the Paper claimed that errors made by the
Tribunal inevitably deprived the Award of its validity and contended
that the rulings had undermined the international rule of
law]{.underline}**.134 **[The Paper further emphasized that China is
confident the Award would have no effect on its territorial sovereignty
or maritime rights and interests in the waterways]{.underline}**. In its
proposal, **[China stressed that one-on-one negotiations and
consultations would be the preferred method to resolve disputes among
relevant claimants instead of adjudication by an international court
that lacked any recognized precedence.135 Given that China viewed the
Award as inherently biased and "just a piece of paper," it declared the
rulings as "null and void \[with\] no binding force]{.underline}**."136
In line with the PRC's official interpretation of the Award, Chinese
state media insisted that more than seventy nations had supported
China's opposition and that the U.S. and its close allies were the only
countries that had publicly endorsed the rulings as legally binding.137
China also claimed that it was, in fact, following a well-established
precedent by pointing out that other prominent UN Security Council
members had similarly disregarded the Tribunal's decisions in the
past.138

#### Challenging China's sea-based norms results in lawfare enacted with escalatory physical force tactics

**[Instead of adhering]{.underline}** to the Award, **[Beijing engaged
in "lawfare"139 by enacting various domestic laws reinforcing its
maritime claims.]{.underline}**140 **[In an effort to legitimize the
nine-dash line, these laws introduce ambiguities regarding maritime
boundaries and expand China's influence over disputed zones, directly
challenging UNCLOS and contradicting the established norms of the
rules-based order.]{.underline}**141 For example, **[the Supreme
People's Court has stated that the Chinese courts' jurisdiction extends
to all areas under the nation's "sovereign control," including the
islands in dispute.]{.underline}**142 This regulation, **[if fully
implemented, would directly undermine the role of international courts
and arbitral tribunals under UNCLOS to hear and adjudicate any future
maritime disputes arising out of the South China Sea.]{.underline}**
Moreover, **[its restructuring of several maritime law enforcement
agencies allows China to strategically manage and control the disputed
territories at sea.]{.underline}**143 **[To further controvert the
enforceability of the Award,]{.underline}** Beijing passed the Coast
Guard Law of the People's Republic of China and the Maritime Traffic
Safety Law in 2021,144 which **[emboldened Chinese law enforcement with
the authority to regulate waterways and intimidate neighboring states if
they were to sail into China's claimed territories]{.underline}**.145
Although Beijing argues that these domestic regulations align with
international laws, legal experts have concluded that the majority of
these provisions conflict with UNCLOS and the Award.146 **[To enforce
its domestic maritime laws, China has resorted to the use of physical
force against other states' vessels and coercion of civilians to follow
its preferred order.]{.underline}** Over the past few years,
**[the]{.underline}** Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy (**[PLA
Navy) has repeatedly encroached upon other coastal states'
EEZ.]{.underline}** The **[PLA Navy was also involved in numerous
intentional collisions and deliberate harassment of Japanese,
Vietnamese, and the Philippine fishing vessels across the South China
Sea]{.underline}**.147 In tightening its grip over the maritime region,
[China also has established research stations, created new
administrative districts, and named geographic features within the
disputed territories.148 In fact, China has transformed many of these
former "rocks" features into fully militarized islands, arming them with
advanced military defensive and offensive equipment]{.underline}.149 An
American Indo-Pacific Commander described **[this as "the largest
military buildup since world war two \[sic\] by the
PRC."]{.underline}**150 Since the issuance of the Award, China's actions
demonstrate that it has managed to underpin the legitimacy of its
nine-dash line, enabling the country to possess and control one of the
most desirable waterways in the world.151 The consequences of these
developments reveal that China has largely succeeded in deflecting
attention from the rulings and rendering the Tribunal's decisions
irrelevant, indicating that it is unwavering in opposing the existing
rules-based order under UNCLOS.152 Instead, through the enactment of
domestic laws and the use of military force over the years,153 Beijing
has steadily attained substantial strategic, economic, and military
advantages over the U.S. and surrounding claimants, seeking to infringe,
weaken, and alter general principles of international law.154 As a
result, the present circumstances in the South China Sea are vastly
different from those envisioned by the UNCLOS drafters and its parties.

Since 2021, when the Biden administration assumed executive control, it
has adopted an assertive approach in clarifying its legal
interpretations of UNCLOS and the Award.181 In July 2022, Secretary of
State Antony Blinken issued a press statement to commemorate the sixth
anniversary of the Arbitral Ruling, reaffirming that the rules of global
waterways and standard procedures for resolving maritime disputes are
directly governed by UNCLOS.182 Secretary Blinken also reiterated the
U.S. alignment with the Award and emphasized that China's nine-dash
claim has "no basis in international law,"183 and firmly declared
Washington's security commitments to the Philippines by stating that
"\[an\] armed attack on Philippine armed forces, public vessels, or
aircraft in the South China Sea would invoke U.S. mutual defense
commitments under Article IV of the 1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense
Treaty."184 Moreover, Secretary Blinken called upon Beijing to comply
with its legal obligations under international laws, and highlighted the
prospect of cooperating with ASEAN nations to "protect and preserve the
rules-based order."185 Following this statement, the US Navy immediately
intensified its Freedom of Navigation Operations in the South China Sea
and around geographic features claimed by China186---which, in light of
its escalating tensions with Taiwan, enraged Beijing.187

LaCl3. This part of study focused on one strain R818, in which potent
antifungal activity was induced by the addition of LaCl3. We found that
the LaCl3-activated metabolites in R818 are likely antimycin-type
compounds. One of them, compound 1, has been purified. Spectroscopic
analyses including HR-MS and 1D NMR indicated that this compound is
urauchimycin D. The antifungal activity of compound 1 was confirmed with
a minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 25 μg/mL; the purified
compound also showed a moderate activity against C. difficile.
Additional notable strains are: strain N217 which showed both antifungal
and antibacterial (including P. aeruginosa) activities and strain M864
which showed potent activity against C. difficile with an MIC value
(0.125 μg/mL) lower than those of vancomycin and metronidazole.

INTRODUCTION

[[Infectious diseases]{.mark} remain a [major threat]{.mark} to human
health]{.underline}, annually causing millions of deaths worldwide,
especially in medically less-developed countries and regions (Spellberg
et al., 2008). There were estimated 1.2 million tuberculosis deaths,
1.03 million HIV/AIDS deaths, and 719,600 malaria deaths in 2016 (The
Lancet, 2017). However, [the [situation]{.mark} is [worsened]{.mark}
significantly [by]{.mark} the prevalence of (multi-)[drug
resistance]{.mark}]{.underline} (Ventola, 2015). Due to drug resistance,
[current [antibiotics]{.mark} are [losing]{.mark} their [capacity to
treat]{.mark} infectious [diseases]{.mark}, and
**[pathogens]{.mark}**]{.underline} such as Klebsiella pneumoniae,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus [have **[again become
fatal threats]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Both the United States Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization
(WHO) have issued lists of priority pathogens: the CDC listed 18
drug-resistant bacteria as threats to the United States1; in 2017, WHO
listed, for the first time, 12 families of bacteria as the greatest
threat to human health2. [Novel antibiotics are urgently needed to treat
disease caused by these pathogens.]{.underline}

[[Actinobacteria]{.underline}]{.mark}, a group of Gram-positive
filamentous bacteria, [have [been]{.mark} an exceptionally [rich source
of bioactive]{.mark} natural [products used to treat infectious diseases
and]{.mark} are the source of the majority of currently used
antibiotics]{.underline} (Newman and Cragg, 2016). The genomic era has
witnessed an explosion of genomic data that unexpectedly revealed the
abundance of silent/cryptic secondary metabolic gene clusters in
actinomycete genomes, which are unexpressed under standard laboratory
culture conditions. Activation of these silent pathways represents a
tremendous opportunity to discover new compounds to treat infectious and
other diseases from known organisms (Van Lanen and Shen, 2006; Nett et
al., 2009; Bachmann et al., 2014; Ziemert et al., 2016). [Meanwhile,
[actinobacteria from unique environmental niches]{.mark} or new taxa are
still [highly sought for drug]{.mark} [discovery]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Due to sampling difficulties, deep-sea actinobacteria are generally much
less studied as a source of natural products. [In this study, we focused
on actinobacteria isolated from deep-sea sponges and aimed to find novel
anti-microbial natural products.]{.underline} [Actinobacteria
were]{.underline} cultured and [tested against a panel of bacterial
pathogens regarded as common causes of healthcare-associated infections
and listed among the most severe threats to human health by CDC1 or
WHO2]{.underline}: Clostridium difficile, P. aeruginosa,
methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and Candida albicans. C.
difficile, a cause of life-threatening diarrhea, is listed by CDC as an
URGENT threat (the highest level). The C. difficile infection (CDI) is
the most common cause of infectious diarrhea in the healthcare setting
with about 453,000 cases and 29,000 deaths yearly in the United States
as reported by CDC in 2015; the annual healthcare costs for acute care
facilities alone are about \$4.8 billion3. Though therapeutics such as
vancomycin, metronidazole, fidaxomicin, or nitazoxanide are available,
[due to [**drug resistance** or **toxicity to gut**]{.mark}
[**microbiome**, new drugs]{.mark}, especially those with narrow
spectrum, [are highly needed.]{.mark}]{.underline} As a CRITICAL
pathogen (the highest level) listed by WHO, P. aeruginosa is a leading
cause of hospital-associated infections (HAIs); many isolates are
resistant to a wide range of antibiotics; multidrug-resistant P.
aeruginosa is also listed as a SERIOUS threat (the second highest level)
by CDC. Also listed as SERIOUS threats by CDC include both
fluconazole-resistant Candida and MRSA, the latter is regarded as a HIGH
(the second highest level) by WHO as well.

[In this preliminary study, we evaluated anti-pathogen activities of
crude extracts from 50 deep-sea actinobacteria strains derived from
various sponge hosts that were collected from environmentally and
geographically diverse locations; many of them are rare
actinobacteria.]{.underline} In an attempt to activate any dormant
secondary metabolic capabilities of these strains, LaCl3 was
supplemented to the culture medium as an elicitor. LaCl3 has been shown
to be an effective elicitor of secondary metabolism in microorganisms in
our previous studies (Kawai et al., 2007; Tanaka et al., 2010; Ochi and
Hosaka, 2013; Ochi et al., 2014). The efficient activation/induction of
new metabolites/anti-microbial activities by LaCl3 was detected in this
study. Strains exhibiting potent antifungal or antibacterial activities
were identified; of particular interest is the identification of a
strain producing metabolites which are more potent than vancomycin
against C. difficile.

[Thousands of [genes from deep-sea marine life]{.mark} are being [used
to create new]{.mark} commercial products ranging from
[pharmaceuticals]{.mark} to cosmetics.]{.underline} [Genes]{.underline}
are segments of DNA that [provide instructions for making other
molecules that are essential for the structure and function of living
organisms.]{.underline}

In a paper we recently published with other colleagues, we investigated
how [[bioprospecting]{.mark} -- the search and discovery of potential
products from animals, plants and microbes -- could serve as a [less
destructive]{.mark} alternative to [deep-sea
mining]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Notably, all of the largest companies using marine genes have sourced
them from deep-sea organisms in some capacity. [Deep-sea animals possess
unique genes that allow them to live in an environment unlike anything
else on Earth]{.underline}, with its intense cold, crushing pressure and
total darkness.

What are these organisms? Most are microbes that have evolved over
millions of years to thrive in extreme conditions. [[Among the
most]{.mark} [uniquely adapted are those found around **hydrothermal
vents**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline} where mineral-rich seawater,
superheated by magma, erupts from cracks in the ocean floor.

[Deep-sea enzymes]{.underline}, a type of molecule encoded by the genes
of organisms that live in extreme environments, are stable in conditions
that other enzymes often cannot function. Their [ability to]{.underline}
[catalyse chemical reactions under high pressure and a wide range of
temperatures makes them commercially valuable for making industrial and
consumer products, including drugs, food, detergents and
biofuels.]{.underline}

[Bioprospecting in the deep sea]{.underline}

One remarkable example involves the bacteria that live in very salty
habitats. This microbe was isolated from marine sediments collected at a
depth of 1,050 meters near the Iheya ridge, 130 kilometers offshore from
Iheya Island, Japan

One of its [enzymes]{.underline} has been [shown to enhance the
conversion of farm waste into glucose by helping break down cellulose
into easily degradable pulp. This is a crucial step for converting
biomass into ethanol, a renewable biofuel.]{.underline}

Another enzyme extracted from a bacterium that exists under extremely
high temperatures has been found to be highly efficient in completely
removing lactose from milk.

Some organisms contribute to multiple inventions, like a deep-sea worm
collected at a depth of 2,625 meters from a hydrothermal vent on the
East Pacific Rise, about 600 km off the Mexican coast. The worm hosted a
bacterium that produces a molecule that was used to develop a skin
cream, as it helps make skin less susceptible to damage from the sun and
pollution. The unusual ability of this bacterium to live at temperatures
above 100°C also made it a model organism for overcoming overheating in
small satellites in Earth's orbit.

[This is just a few examples among over 16,000 proteins derived from
deep-sea species and used in technology, catalogued in this
database.]{.underline}

The potential for innovation from deep-sea species has not been fully
explored. As of 2024, only a quarter of the seabed has been mapped and
most deep-sea species remain undiscovered.

The dangers of mining

But the essential [role of deep-sea life in the functioning of Earth's
systems may be far greater than previously understood.]{.underline}

Researchers recently discovered an unusually high concentration of
oxygen on the seafloor in the Pacific Ocean, referred to as "dark
oxygen". This oxygen may be being produced by electrolysis -- when an
electric current separates water into hydrogen and oxygen.

Where might an electrical charge be generated at the bottom of the
ocean? Perhaps on the surfaces of polymetallic nodules, rock-like
formations composed of lots of different metals which can create
differences in electrical potential when interacting with seawater. The
formation of these metals is influenced by the activity of microbes
living on them, which in turn affects the chemical properties of the
surrounding environment. The production of dark oxygen could be vital
for the respiration of other species living in the ocean where there is
no sunlight.

[Unfortunately, [deep-sea ecosystems]{.mark} are [under threat from
seabed mining for minerals]{.mark}.]{.underline} Polymetallic nodules
are considered potential resources for manganese, nickel, and rare earth
elements -- materials used to make electronics and computers. The
Clarion-Clipperton Zone, a Pacific region where dark oxygen was recently
discovered, has already been divided into 16 mining claims.

Researchers and campaigners have warned that [[d]{.mark}eep-[s]{.mark}ea
[m]{.mark}ining could [severely damage marine ecosystems and]{.mark}
have highlighted the lack of scientific consensus on the long-term
consequences of these operations. Once disturbed, [the evolutionary
history these ecosystems represent]{.mark} could be [lost
forever.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The International Seabed Authority oversees the management of mining
activities in international waters. Although it has not yet authorised
any commercial mining, it has faced criticism for allegedly dismissing
environmental concerns. The recent election of the new ISA
secretary-general, Leticia Carvalho, offers an opportunity to safeguard
vital areas of the world's oceans, crucial for both nature and human
wellbeing.

[We must rethink the true value of the deep sea and consider what losing
it may mean for the rest of the world.]{.underline}

#### AMR Crisis [decks]{.underline} the global economy

**World Bank Group '16** \[9-20-2016; The World Bank is a vital source

NT-RaS

NEW YORK, September 19, 2016---[[Drug-resistant infections]{.mark} have
the potential to [cause]{.mark} a level of **[economic
damage]{.mark}**]{.underline} similar to---and likely **[[worse
than]{.underline}]{.mark}**---that caused by [**the [2008]{.mark}
financial crisis**,]{.underline} according to a new report by the World
Bank Group entitled "Drug Resistant Infections: A Threat to Our Economic
Future." The [[research shows]{.mark} that]{.underline} a high-case
scenario of [antimicrobial resistance
([AMR]{.mark})]{.underline}---where antibiotics and other antimicrobial
dugs no longer treat infections the way they are supposed to---could
cause low-income countries to lose more than 5% of their GDP and
[[push]{.mark} up to [28]{.mark} [million people]{.mark}, mostly in
developing countries, [into poverty]{.mark} by 2050. And
[unlike]{.mark}]{.underline} the financial crisis of [[2008]{.mark},
there would be **[no prospects for a cyclical recovery]{.mark}** in the
medium term, [as]{.mark} the costly impact of [AMR would
persist]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"The scale and nature of this economic threat could wipe out hard-fought
development gains and take us away from our goals of ending extreme
poverty and boosting shared prosperity," said Jim Yong Kim, President of
the World Bank Group. "The cost of inaction is unaffordable---especially
for the poorest countries. We must urgently change course to avert this
potential crisis."

Key findings of the report are based on World Bank Group projections of
the world economy in 2017-2050. They include:

[Impact on GDP: By 2050, annual **[global GDP]{.mark}** would [fall
by]{.mark} 1.1% in the low-impact AMR scenario and
**[3.8%]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the high-impact AMR scenario.
Low-income countries would lose more every year leading up to 2050, with
the loss exceeding 5% of GDP in 2050 in the latter scenario.

Impact on global poverty: [There would be a pronounced [increase in
extreme poverty]{.mark} because of AMR.]{.underline} Of the additional
28.3 million people falling into extreme poverty in 2050 in the
high-impact AMR scenario, the vast majority (26.2 million) would live in
low-income countries. Currently, the world is broadly on track to
eliminate extreme poverty (at \$1.90/day) by 2030, reaching close to the
target of less than 3% of people living in extreme poverty. AMR risks
putting this target out of reach.

Impact on world trade: In 2050, the volume of global real exports would
shrink by 1.1% in the low-case scenario, and by 3.8% in the high-case
scenario.

Impact on healthcare costs: [Global [increase]{.mark}s in [healthcare
costs]{.mark} may range [from **\$300 billion** to]{.mark} more than
**[\$1 trillion]{.mark}** per year by 2050.]{.underline}

Impact on livestock output: By 2050, [the [decline in global
livestock]{.mark} production could range from a low of 2.6% [to]{.mark}
a high of [7.5%]{.mark} per year.]{.underline}

Drug-resistant infections, in both humans and animals, are on the rise
globally. If AMR spreads unchecked, many infectious diseases will again
be untreatable, reversing a century of progress in public health. The
United Nations has scheduled a day-long special session on AMR as part
of the UN General Assembly in New York this week, only the fourth time
that health is being highlighted in this way.

"We now know that---unless addressed swiftly and seriously and on a
sustained basis---the growing global problem of antibiotic resistance
will be disastrous for human and animal health, food production and
global economies. The fact that, left unchecked, it would penalize the
poor more than anyone, makes clear why this needs to be addressed as a
critical issue for development. As heads of state come together at the
UN General Assembly high-level meeting on antimicrobial resistance this
week, this should be front of mind,\" said Margaret Chan,
Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO).

 

[Several recent reports on [AMR]{.mark}, including the most recent one
by Lord Jim O'Neill's independent policy review, have [call]{.mark}ed
[for]{.mark} an urgent [focus on this issue]{.mark} and highlighted the
enormous [global economic]{.mark} [losses]{.mark} it can cause---it
estimated about [\$100 trillion]{.mark} in total by 2050]{.underline}.  
   

Lord Jim O'Neill, Chairman of the Review on Antimicrobial Resistance,
said about today's World Bank Group report: "This report provides
another timely reminder that rising drug resistance is a looming threat
to our prosperity and sustained economic development in all parts of
the world. As global leaders meet at the UN this week, I hope that this
report will help to harden their resolve to take proper, collaborative
action on the many challenges of AMR."

The report outlines the crises in the human and veterinary public
health sectors and in the environment, where capacity for regulating
antimicrobials is insufficient in many countries, where misuse and
overuse of antibiotics is an issue for some while access remains
difficult for many. There is insufficient investment in building strong
public health systems, including surveillance and monitoring, that can
reduce risk at the interface between humans, animals and
their environment.

The report recommends both AMR-sensitive and AMR-specific solutions to
address the crisis. It says that one of the best opportunities in the
short-term to mitigate the threat of AMR is to strengthen investments in

INTRODUCTION

[[Infectious diseases]{.mark} remain a [major threat]{.mark} to human
health]{.underline}, annually causing millions of deaths worldwide,
especially in medically less-developed countries and regions (Spellberg
et al., 2008). There were estimated 1.2 million tuberculosis deaths,
1.03 million HIV/AIDS deaths, and 719,600 malaria deaths in 2016 (The
Lancet, 2017). However, [the [situation]{.mark} is [worsened]{.mark}
significantly [by]{.mark} the prevalence of (multi-)[drug
resistance]{.mark}]{.underline} (Ventola, 2015). Due to drug resistance,
[current [antibiotics]{.mark} are [losing]{.mark} their [capacity to
treat]{.mark} infectious [diseases]{.mark}, and
**[pathogens]{.mark}**]{.underline} such as Klebsiella pneumoniae,
Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus [have **[again become
fatal threats]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Both the United States Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization
(WHO) have issued lists of priority pathogens: the CDC listed 18
drug-resistant bacteria as threats to the United States1; in 2017, WHO
listed, for the first time, 12 families of bacteria as the greatest
threat to human health2. [Novel antibiotics are urgently needed to treat
disease caused by these pathogens.]{.underline}

[[Actinobacteria]{.underline}]{.mark}, a group of Gram-positive
filamentous bacteria, [have [been]{.mark} an exceptionally [rich source
of bioactive]{.mark} natural [products used to treat infectious diseases
and]{.mark} are the source of the majority of currently used
antibiotics]{.underline} (Newman and Cragg, 2016). The genomic era has
witnessed an explosion of genomic data that unexpectedly revealed the
abundance of silent/cryptic secondary metabolic gene clusters in
actinomycete genomes, which are unexpressed under standard laboratory
culture conditions. Activation of these silent pathways represents a
tremendous opportunity to discover new compounds to treat infectious and
other diseases from known organisms (Van Lanen and Shen, 2006; Nett et
al., 2009; Bachmann et al., 2014; Ziemert et al., 2016). [Meanwhile,
[actinobacteria from unique environmental niches]{.mark} or new taxa are
still [highly sought for drug]{.mark} [discovery]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Due to sampling difficulties, deep-sea actinobacteria are generally much
less studied as a source of natural products. [In this study, we focused
on actinobacteria isolated from deep-sea sponges and aimed to find novel
anti-microbial natural products.]{.underline} [Actinobacteria
were]{.underline} cultured and [tested against a panel of bacterial
pathogens regarded as common causes of healthcare-associated infections
and listed among the most severe threats to human health by CDC1 or
WHO2]{.underline}: Clostridium difficile, P. aeruginosa,
methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), and Candida albicans. C.
difficile, a cause of life-threatening diarrhea, is listed by CDC as an
URGENT threat (the highest level). The C. difficile infection (CDI) is
the most common cause of infectious diarrhea in the healthcare setting
with about 453,000 cases and 29,000 deaths yearly in the United States
as reported by CDC in 2015; the annual healthcare costs for acute care
facilities alone are about \$4.8 billion3. Though therapeutics such as
vancomycin, metronidazole, fidaxomicin, or nitazoxanide are available,
[due to [**drug resistance** or **toxicity to gut**]{.mark}
[**microbiome**, new drugs]{.mark}, especially those with narrow
spectrum, [are highly needed.]{.mark}]{.underline} As a CRITICAL
pathogen (the highest level) listed by WHO, P. aeruginosa is a leading
cause of hospital-associated infections (HAIs); many isolates are
resistant to a wide range of antibiotics; multidrug-resistant P.
aeruginosa is also listed as a SERIOUS threat (the second highest level)
by CDC. Also listed as SERIOUS threats by CDC include both
fluconazole-resistant Candida and MRSA, the latter is regarded as a HIGH
(the second highest level) by WHO as well.

[In this preliminary study, we evaluated anti-pathogen activities of
crude extracts from 50 deep-sea actinobacteria strains derived from
various sponge hosts that were collected from environmentally and
geographically diverse locations; many of them are rare
actinobacteria.]{.underline} In an attempt to activate any dormant
secondary metabolic capabilities of these strains, LaCl3 was
supplemented to the culture medium as an elicitor. LaCl3 has been shown
to be an effective elicitor of secondary metabolism in microorganisms in
our previous studies (Kawai et al., 2007; Tanaka et al., 2010; Ochi and
Hosaka, 2013; Ochi et al., 2014). The efficient activation/induction of
new metabolites/anti-microbial activities by LaCl3 was detected in this
study. Strains exhibiting potent antifungal or antibacterial activities
were identified; of particular interest is the identification of a
strain producing metabolites which are more potent than vancomycin
against C. difficile.

[Thousands of [genes from deep-sea marine life]{.mark} are being [used
to create new]{.mark} commercial products ranging from
[pharmaceuticals]{.mark} to cosmetics.]{.underline} [Genes]{.underline}
are segments of DNA that [provide instructions for making other
molecules that are essential for the structure and function of living
organisms.]{.underline}

In a paper we recently published with other colleagues, we investigated
how [[bioprospecting]{.mark} -- the search and discovery of potential
products from animals, plants and microbes -- could serve as a [less
destructive]{.mark} alternative to [deep-sea
mining]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Notably, all of the largest companies using marine genes have sourced
them from deep-sea organisms in some capacity. [Deep-sea animals possess
unique genes that allow them to live in an environment unlike anything
else on Earth]{.underline}, with its intense cold, crushing pressure and
total darkness.

What are these organisms? Most are microbes that have evolved over
millions of years to thrive in extreme conditions. [[Among the
most]{.mark} [uniquely adapted are those found around **hydrothermal
vents**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline} where mineral-rich seawater,
superheated by magma, erupts from cracks in the ocean floor.

[Deep-sea enzymes]{.underline}, a type of molecule encoded by the genes
of organisms that live in extreme environments, are stable in conditions
that other enzymes often cannot function. Their [ability to]{.underline}
[catalyse chemical reactions under high pressure and a wide range of
temperatures makes them commercially valuable for making industrial and
consumer products, including drugs, food, detergents and
biofuels.]{.underline}

[Bioprospecting in the deep sea]{.underline}

One remarkable example involves the bacteria that live in very salty
habitats. This microbe was isolated from marine sediments collected at a
depth of 1,050 meters near the Iheya ridge, 130 kilometers offshore from
Iheya Island, Japan

One of its [enzymes]{.underline} has been [shown to enhance the
conversion of farm waste into glucose by helping break down cellulose
into easily degradable pulp. This is a crucial step for converting
biomass into ethanol, a renewable biofuel.]{.underline}

Another enzyme extracted from a bacterium that exists under extremely
high temperatures has been found to be highly efficient in completely
removing lactose from milk.

Some organisms contribute to multiple inventions, like a deep-sea worm
collected at a depth of 2,625 meters from a hydrothermal vent on the
East Pacific Rise, about 600 km off the Mexican coast. The worm hosted a
bacterium that produces a molecule that was used to develop a skin
cream, as it helps make skin less susceptible to damage from the sun and
pollution. The unusual ability of this bacterium to live at temperatures
above 100°C also made it a model organism for overcoming overheating in
small satellites in Earth's orbit.

[This is just a few examples among over 16,000 proteins derived from
deep-sea species and used in technology, catalogued in this
database.]{.underline}

The potential for innovation from deep-sea species has not been fully
explored. As of 2024, only a quarter of the seabed has been mapped and
most deep-sea species remain undiscovered.

The dangers of mining

But the essential [role of deep-sea life in the functioning of Earth's
systems may be far greater than previously understood.]{.underline}

Researchers recently discovered an unusually high concentration of
oxygen on the seafloor in the Pacific Ocean, referred to as "dark
oxygen". This oxygen may be being produced by electrolysis -- when an
electric current separates water into hydrogen and oxygen.

Where might an electrical charge be generated at the bottom of the
ocean? Perhaps on the surfaces of polymetallic nodules, rock-like
formations composed of lots of different metals which can create
differences in electrical potential when interacting with seawater. The
formation of these metals is influenced by the activity of microbes
living on them, which in turn affects the chemical properties of the
surrounding environment. The production of dark oxygen could be vital
for the respiration of other species living in the ocean where there is
no sunlight.

[Unfortunately, [deep-sea ecosystems]{.mark} are [under threat from
seabed mining for minerals]{.mark}.]{.underline} Polymetallic nodules
are considered potential resources for manganese, nickel, and rare earth
elements -- materials used to make electronics and computers. The
Clarion-Clipperton Zone, a Pacific region where dark oxygen was recently
discovered, has already been divided into 16 mining claims.

Researchers and campaigners have warned that [[d]{.mark}eep-[s]{.mark}ea
[m]{.mark}ining could [severely damage marine ecosystems and]{.mark}
have highlighted the lack of scientific consensus on the long-term
consequences of these operations. Once disturbed, [the evolutionary
history these ecosystems represent]{.mark} could be [lost
forever.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The International Seabed Authority oversees the management of mining
activities in international waters. Although it has not yet authorised
any commercial mining, it has faced criticism for allegedly dismissing
environmental concerns. The recent election of the new ISA
secretary-general, Leticia Carvalho, offers an opportunity to safeguard
vital areas of the world's oceans, crucial for both nature and human
wellbeing.

[We must rethink the true value of the deep sea and consider what losing
it may mean for the rest of the world.]{.underline}

AMR and the Environment

[The [environment and]{.mark} the [AMR]{.mark} pandemic [are]{.mark}
strictly [linked]{.mark}. The environment is both a vehicle for
spreading [AMR microbes]{.mark} and a culprit of antimicrobial
pollutants, which [negatively impact biodiversity and
ecosystems]{.mark}]{.underline} (UNEP, 2022).

[The [spread of antimicrobials]{.mark} and the consequent
[increases]{.mark} in antimicrobial resistance]{.underline} occurs
especially through unsound release of residues into the environment
(UNEP, 2017). [Therefore, [environmental degradation
and]{.mark} pollution factors [connect]{.mark}ed [to the]{.mark} triple
planetary [crisis of climate change, biodiversity]{.mark} loss and
pollution]{.underline} are the very same ones that alter microbial
diversity and facilitate the development, transmission and diffusion of
AMR (UNEP, 2022). 

The dumping of these substances in the environment occurs mainly through
five pollutant sources.

[[Antimicrobials]{.mark} coming from these sources are present and
[transmit]{.mark}ted [through water]{.mark} (rivers, lakes and
sediments), [sewage, soil, air and wildlife]{.mark}. They represent a
serious threat as [their spread]{.mark} is [not limited to]{.mark} the
[specific points where]{.mark} the [contamination occurs]{.mark}
(transient source), [but it]{.mark} spreads in a [diffuse]{.mark} and
non-source way.]{.underline}

In the past years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, zoonotic diseases have
raised attention and preoccupation. As antibiotics are more frequently
used in animal husbandry, resistance is rapidly developed and spread
through the environment in the shape of unmetabolized antibiotics. The
transmission of diseases from animals to humans through zoonotic
pathogens bears the risk of communicating also antibiotic resistant
genes (ARGs) through contact or consumption of animal products.
Therefore, people working in or living close to livestock facilities are
disproportionately at risk.

[Current extinction rates exceed the natural background rate by a factor
of approximately 1,000]{.underline}, with an estimated 1 million species
at risk of extinction in the coming decades. Meanwhile, insect biomass
has declined by approximately 75% in some regions over the past 30
years, threatening pollination services valued at \$217 billion
annually.

The scale of our assault on global biodiversity is difficult to
comprehend. [Approximately 40% of Earth's land surface has been
converted to agriculture or urban development]{.underline}. An estimated
32 million acres of forest --- an area the size of England --- is
cleared annually. [Marine ecosystems face similarly grim statistics: 90%
of large predatory fish have disappeared from the oceans]{.underline},
while approximately 50% of coral reefs have been lost since the 1950s.
Yet these statistics fail to capture the complex interdependencies
within ecological systems that make each loss potentially catastrophic.

Visualize a future where, by 2070, [the accelerating loss of keystone
species triggers cascading ecosystem **collapses across multiple biomes
simultaneously**]{.underline}. The extinction of certain fungal species
disrupts mycorrhizal networks that support approximately 90% of land
plants. [Key soil microorganisms that fix nitrogen and process organic
matter disappear, reducing agricultural yields]{.underline} by 60%
despite intensive chemical inputs. [Pollinator extinction reduces crop
yields]{.underline} by approximately 40%, [while soil microbiome
deterioration further impairs agricultural productivity]{.underline}.

Oceanic food webs disintegrate as acidification and warming exceed the
adaptive capacity of foundational species. [Phytoplankton populations
--- which produce approximately 50% of Earth's oxygen]{.underline} and
form the base of marine food chains --- [decline by 70%.]{.underline}
Forests, weakened by changing climate conditions and lacking symbiotic
fungal networks, succumb to novel pathogens. [The biosphere's regulatory
functions --- **carbon sequestration, water cycling, atmospheric oxygen
production --- begin to fail.**]{.underline}

Human efforts to engineer technological replacements for ecosystem
services prove inadequate in both scale and complexity. Attempts to
create artificial pollination systems capture less than 5% of natural
service capacity. Synthetic fertilizers become increasingly ineffective
as soil structure degrades. Oxygen generation plants cannot compensate
for declining atmospheric oxygen levels as phytoplankton and forests
disappear.

[Humanity, having treated ecological systems as externalities in
economic calculations, discovers too late that there is no economy
without ecology]{.underline}. The bitter joke would be that we
meticulously cataloged the species we were driving to extinction without
recognizing that we were also documenting the components of our own life
support system as they disappeared. In a final irony, museum collections
preserving specimens of extinct species might outlast the civilization
that created them --- and indeed, the species that built the museums.

the World Health Organization, and the World Bank describes AMR as a
crisis affecting the finance, health, and agriculture sectors and a
major threat to the attainment of Sustainable Development Goals. But
what is AMR? It is a phenotype that evolves in microbes exposed to
antimicrobial molecules and causes dangerous infections. This suggests
that scientists and healthcare workers should be on the frontline in the
search for sustainable solutions to AMR. Yet AMR is also a societal
problem to be understood by everyone. This review aims to explore the
need to address the problem of AMR through a coherent, international
strategy with buy‐in from all sectors of society. As reviewed here, the
sustainable solutions to AMR will be driven by better understanding of
AMR biology but will require more than this alone to succeed. Some
advances on the horizon, such as the use of bacteriophage (phage) to
treat AMR infections. However, [many of the new technologies and new
therapeutics to address AMR require access to biodiversity]{.underline},
where the custodians of that biodiversity---and the traditional
knowledge required to access it---are needed as key partners in the
scientific, clinical, biotechnological, and international ventures that
would treat the problem of AMR and ultimately prevent its further
evolution. [Many of these **advances** will be **built on** microbial
assessments to understand the extent of AMR in our environments and

uses.]{.underline} Genuine partnerships for access to this biodiversity
and sharing of benefits accrued require a consideration of ethical
practice and behavior. Behavior change is needed across all sectors of
culturally diverse societies so that rapid deployment of solutions can
be implemented for maximum effect against the impacts of AMR.

#### Deep-sea mining causes species to go extinct

**Ellenby '23** \[Dani; February 15; A science communication

species at distant sites,\"

NT-RaS

[Destruction of key hydrothermal vents by deep-sea mining could have
knock-on impacts for vent fields hundreds of kilometers
away]{.underline}, suggests a new paper published in Ecology and
Evolution.  

The study, which was conducted by scientists from the Okinawa Institute
of Science and Technology (OIST), in collaboration with the Japan Agency
for Marine-Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC), and the University of
Victoria, British Columbia, has revealed how different vents in the
Northwest Pacific are connected to each other. The research also
identifies key vents that are particularly important for maintaining
connectivity, which need to be prioritized for conservation. 

"These results could provide a powerful tool for helping policy makers
and the mining companies decide which sites should be protected from
mining," said Otis Brunner, first author and PhD student in the
OIST Marine Biophysics Unit, led by Professor Satoshi Mitarai. 

Hydrothermal vents are extreme deep-sea environments that exist in
geologically active areas on the seafloor. These vents, which are like
underwater geysers, spew hot water filled with minerals out from cracks
in the seabed. And [despite the intense heat and pressure, these vent
systems teem with strange and unique life.]{.underline} These creatures
around these vents, such as crabs, shrimps and worms, all rely on
bacteria, which uses chemical energy from the vent to make biomass. 

The [chemical-rich waters that sustain life also make these environments
an attractive target for the emerging industry of deep-sea
mining]{.underline}. When the chemicals that come out of the earth's
crust meet the cold seawater, they precipitate and create chimney-like
deposits on the seabed, called sea floor massive sulfides.  

"These chimneys contain a high quality and quantity of gold, silver,
copper and other rare earth minerals that we need to feed our
technology-hungry society," said Brunner. 

However, [extracting these resources destroys the creatures living on
that chimney, and severely impacts those on nearby chimneys within the
same hydrothermal vent site]{.underline}. 

"[Each **hydrothermal vent** often **hosts** some **endemic species**,
meaning they only live there. So if you remove or severely **damage
their ecosystem**, not only have you lost those animals, but **you\'ve
lost that species entirely**]{.underline}," said Brunner. 

And now, Brunner's research shows that the [damage to hydrothermal vent
ecosystems is also unlikely to be limited to just one single vent site,
but **could impact other vent sites hundreds of kilometers
away**. ]{.underline}

Although hydrothermal vents seem isolated from each other, many
hydrothermal vent species can actually disperse from one vent to another
while in the larval stage, assisted by the ocean currents. If they
manage to reach another vent, and the conditions at the new vent are
similar (hydrothermal vents can differ significantly in depth, chemical
composition of the vent fluid, intensity and heat), then the creatures
can settle and mature into adulthood. This means that if a species
population is wiped out at one hydrothermal vent, then the population of
the same species at another hydrothermal vent, where the larval used to
disperse to, will also be threatened.  

In his study, Brunner looked at vent sites within three sub-regions of
the Northwest Pacific -- the Okinawa Trough, the Izu-Bonin Arc and the
Mariana Trough. He inferred how connected each vent site was to the
others by comparing how many species the vent sites had in common. 

\<\<\<Graph Omitted\>\>\>

By creating networks from the species data, Brunner and his colleagues
identified which vent sites act as important hubs within each
sub-region. 

Two vent sites, Sakai and North Knoll Iheya Ridge, were found to be the
most important for maintaining connectivity in the Okinawa Trough
sub-region and should be prioritized for conservation. 

"Unfortunately, the Sakai and North Knoll Iheya vent sites are situated
in the central region of the Okinawa Trough, an area of particular
interest for mining," said Brunner. "But any disturbance to these two
sites would have particularly strong impacts on all the species at
hydrothermal events across Japan." 

For the Izu-Bonin Arc and Mariana Trench, Nikko volcano and Alice
Springs were the most important hub, respectively. There is no current
interest in deep-sea mining at these sites.  

The study also identified pathways of connectivity linking both the
Okinawa Trough and the Mariana Trench to the Izu-Bonin Arc. However,
these linkages only occurred across a small number of hydrothermal
vents, including the Daisan-Kume Knoll in the Okinawa Trough, situated
within an area of mining interest. Mining activity here could cause a
collapse in the network across the Northwest Pacific region. 

Of final note were two outlier vent sites, the Sumisu Caldera and the
Minami-Ensei Knoll, that showed low connectivity to any other vents in
the region. These vents have very different features to other vents in
the Northwest Pacific, with many creatures endemic to these sites. 

"Mining at these vents would be less likely to impact others, but they
are very unique and fragile ecosystems that also need to be conserved,"
said Brunner.

covering approximately 65% of the planet\'s surface area. [These
environments constitute]{.underline} diverse topographical features with
distinct characteristics (Figure 1), including **[hydrothermal
vents]{.underline}**, cold seeps, seamounts, abyssal plains, and
trenches. Compared with familiar terrestrial habitats or surface ocean
environments, the deep sea presents extreme conditions for life: high
hydrostatic pressures (averaging 38 MPa, reaching 110 MPa in trenches),
low temperatures (0--4°C, except in hydrothermal vents averaging 100°C),
and permanent darkness. Nevertheless, over 75% of the oceans' microbial
biomass thrives in these harsh conditions, playing a crucial role in
ecosystem functions such as forming the basis of food webs, regulating
climate, and contributing to vast genetic diversity. [Microbes in the
deep sea have developed sophisticated molecular adaptations to cope with
these harsh conditions]{.underline}, affecting both their primary and

Potential impact of mining activities on deep-sea chemosynthetic
communities

[One of the targets for commercial mining is the Seafloor Massive
Sulfides (SMSs) deposits formed around hydrothermal vents,]{.underline}
which is a highly attractive source of copper, zinc, lead, gold and
silver ores (Hoagland 2010, Herzig 1999, Binns and Scott 1993, Halbach
et al. 1989). [Hydrothermal vents host chemosynthetic communities as
well as metal rich ores]{.underline}. The [chemosynthetic
communities]{.underline} consist of many endemic invertebrate species
[specifically adapted to the vent environment via microbial
chemoautotrophic primary production]{.underline} (Van Dover 2010).
[These **species have provided new scientific insights** into the
mechanisms by which organisms adopt to the extreme
environment]{.underline} (Jannasch and Wirsen 1979). Furthermore, as
reviewed by Le et al. (2016), ecological function and services of these
communities range from providing habitat and refuge for other species
including non-endemic species (Levin et al. 2016, Govenar 2010), playing
a key role in global carbon, sulfur and heavy metals cycling (Jeanthon,
2000, D\'Arcy and Amend 2013) and offering new biomolecules that could
contribute to industrial development (Terpe et al. 2013, Mahon et al.
2015). [**Mining of seafloor** massive sulfide **deposits** potentially
**changes the physico-chemical environment** of a vent community through
the loss of sulfide habitat, degradation of sulfide habitat quality,
modification of fluid flux regimes and exposure of surrounding seafloor
habitats]{.underline} (including non-sulfide habitats) to sedimentation
and heavy metal deposition (International Seabed Authority 2007, Van
Dover 2014). [This will **directly affect the ecological community** by
removing and reclaiming organisms, reducing the amount of habitable
substrate and changing resource supply.]{.underline} Physico-chemical
models and organism distribution data have been integrated to estimate
the potential area of sedimentation (Coffey Natural Systems 2008b).
However, after the instantaneous effects of a disturbance, the
ecological community will reach a new equilibrium state within the
disturbed environment (Ives and Carpenter 2007). Hence, [potential
impacts of artificial disturbances, including how they may cause
extinction and modify community structure at different spatial
scales]{.underline} (local, regional and global), and decrease diversity
at different biological levels (genetic, species and phylogenetic),
[will be understood by considering both direct impacts of mining
activities and subsequent ecological responses]{.underline}.
Environmental impact assessments (EIAs) that lack this point of view
might severely underestimate the potential risks of anthropological
activities.

[The World Organisation for Animal Health and the World
Bank]{.underline} have recently [published]{.underline} the report
["Forecasting the Fallout from AMR: Economic Impacts of Antimicrobial
Resistance in Humans".]{.underline}

The document, released in September 2024, [provides]{.underline} a
detailed and [alarming analysis of how antimicrobial
resistance]{.underline} (AMR) could [shape]{.underline} global health
outcomes and [economic trajectories **if left unchecked**]{.underline}.
The report uses projections from the Institute for Health Metrics and
Evaluation (IHME) and combines them with economic modelling to provide a
rigorous look at the impact of AMR on health systems and economies
around the world. 

This commentary summarizes key findings of the report, including its
[implications for low- and middle-income countries, the economic burden
of AMR]{.underline}, possible intervention strategies, and the return on
investment from tackling this public health crisis.

[AMR: a global health and economic threat]{.underline}

At the heart of the report is a critical message: [AMR]{.underline} is
not just a medical problem, but a looming economic disaster that could
[destabilise healthcare systems and slow global economic
growth,]{.underline} [particularly in vulnerable regions.]{.underline}
The report estimates that under a business-as-usual scenario, where
resistance rates follow historical trends, [the direct health costs of
AMR will rise from **\$66 billion to \$159 billion
annually**]{.underline} by 2050. Furthermore, if resistance rates
increase at the rate of the bottom 15% of countries, [healthcare costs
could rise to **\$325 billion** and the global economy could shrink **by
\$1.7 trillion**]{.underline} by mid-century.

These figures underscore the profound economic and social impact of AMR.
Beyond direct healthcare costs, AMR affects labour force participation,
tourism and overall economic resilience, with low-income countries
bearing the heaviest burden. The report highlights that AMR is likely to
have a disproportionate impact on low- and lower-middle-income
countries, where health systems are already strained and access to
advanced treatments is limited.

4. The impact of AMR on human and animal populations

[AMR has arisen as a multifaceted issue that impacts the **health of
both humans and animals.**]{.underline} The excessive and improper
utilization of antibiotics in various domains, such as healthcare
facilities, agricultural practices, and veterinary medicine, has
expedited the emergence of drug-resistant strains of microorganisms. The
excessive dependence on antibiotics has resulted in the emergence of
antibiotic-resistant bacteria, commonly known as superbugs, which pose
significant challenges in treatment efficacy and can lead to severe
infections. Furthermore, the inadequate progress in developing novel
antimicrobial medications exacerbates the issue, as the rate at which
[resistance develops surpasses the rate at which effective therapies are
being identified]{.underline} \[38\].

[AMR has emerged as one of the most significant threats to human
health in the 21st century.]{.underline} Previously treatable infections
are becoming increasingly intractable, posing substantial clinical
challenges. [The loss of effective first-line antimicrobials has driven
growing reliance on second and third-line therapies, which are often
more expensive, more toxic, and require longer treatment
durations]{.underline} \[39\]. Prolonged illnesses drain individual and
healthcare system resources due to extended hospitalizations. Lengthier
recoveries also impact economic productivity, giving more excellent time
off work. AMR infections similarly necessitate increased outpatient
clinic visits, laboratory testing, and isolation precautions \[40\]. The
mortality attributed directly to AMR pathogens claims over a million
lives annually \[40\]. The absence of effective antibiotics, routine
procedures like surgery, organ transplantations, chemotherapy,
and neonatal care could become exponentially more dangerous due to the
limited capacity to control infections \[41\]. Some pathogens described
as "ESKAPE" bacteria, including resistant forms of Enterococcus
faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter
baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp., represent the
most troublesome MDR threats facing hospitals today \[42\]. Common
scratch-borne infections or minor injuries could be fatal in a
post-antibiotic era.

[**AMR threatens** human health and food production by enabling
animal-to-human transfer of resistant **zoonotic
pathogens**]{.underline} \[43\]. Overuse of antibiotics in livestock to
treat illness and promote livestock growth has precipitated reservoirs
of resistance. [This facilitates enhanced transmission risks of MDR
bacteria like Salmonella and Campylobacter via the food chain or animal
handlers ]{.underline}[\[44\]. Resistant bacterial strains spread
readily between species. Wildlife similarly develops AMR from indirect
environmental exposures driving additional pathogen
transmission]{.underline}. Resistant microbes [**extend into the broader
environment** through fertilizers made from manure, contaminating
waterways and produce that reaches consumer tables]{.underline}. They
additionally exchange AMR genes with normal environmental and human
commensal microflora. Restricted treatment options for animal infections
resulting from resistance promote outbreak escalation among [cattle,
poultry, and sheep, necessitating culling and generating significant
economic losses while threatening food supplies]{.underline}.
Approximations indicate AMR could impose a \$3--4 billion financial
burden through livestock alone in the coming decades \[45\]. Detrimental
resistance impacts across agriculture and economic systems also spur
disruptive ripple effects for national security and trade. Hence, a
proper One Health approach encompassing human, animal, and environmental
health surveillance and interventions remain necessary to fully address
AMR's substantial existing and prospective adverse impacts on animals
that, in turn, heighten human exposure risks
further \[46\], \[47\], \[48\], \[49\], \[50\].

The devastating effects of climate change on human health are already on
display: famines triggered by once-in-a-century droughts or flooding;
death and suffering wrought by some of the strongest hurricanes and heat
waves in modern history.

But what is less well known is how [biodiversity loss is harming our
health and threatening the basic ecological cycles that keep us
alive.]{.underline}

"We are out of harmony with nature," UN Secretary-General António
Guterres told world leaders at last year's Biodiversity COP. "Humanity
has become a weapon of mass extinction. ... And ultimately, we are
committing suicide by proxy."

One reporter called biodiversity loss a "mounting under-the-radar
crisis," and [disturbing signs are appearing all over the
globe]{.underline}, from beaches awash in sargassum seaweed to
massive fish die-offs in polluted waterways. In fact, according to the
United Nations Environment Programme, [**biodiversity is declining
faster than at any other time in human history**. Right now more than 1
million species are facing extinction.]{.underline}

In the Amazon, a Call for One Health

There are few places on the planet where the threat of biodiversity loss
is more evident than the Amazon, which is being destroyed by record
levels of deforestation despite being home to one-third of the planet's
species --- the greatest concentration of biodiversity on Earth.

Because [habitat destruction brings humans and wildlife into closer
contact, it dramatically increases our risk of exposure to "**zoonotic
spillover**," which occurs when pathogens --- bacteria or viruses that
cause disease --- jump from animals to humans.]{.underline} In fact,
more than 75% of emerging infectious diseases in humans are caused by
pathogens that originally circulated in animals, leading to millions of
deaths each year. According to some estimates, as many as 1.6 million
viruses are contained within mammals and birds across the globe, some of
which could be deadly if or when they become transmissible to humans.

Dr. Alessandra Nava, a veterinary scientist based in the Brazilian city
of Manaus, has made the rainforest her laboratory. She has dedicated her
career to collecting samples from small mammals for the Fiocruz Amazônia
Biobank, a research collection she helps oversee as part of a growing
effort to track the spread of zoonotic pathogens, and perhaps ultimately
help predict or even prevent another pandemic.

Her work exemplifies a holistic approach, fittingly dubbed "One Health,"
that recognizes [the indivisible link between animal, human, and
environmental well-being.]{.underline} The UN-led initiative brings
together the public health, veterinary, and environmental sectors and
promotes food and water safety, nutrition, the control of zoonotic
diseases, pollution management, and more.

"Nobody talked about 'One Health' 25 years ago," Dr. Nava says. "When we
keep the forest intact, it serves as a buffer zone."

Protecting Nature, Just as Nature Protects Us

A higher risk of infectious outbreaks is just one of the many
repercussions of biodiversity loss on human health.

[By disrupting the delicate ecological balance that regulates our
planet's oxygen, water, and nutrient cycles, we risk unraveling the
entire food chain by harming the many different species --- large,
small, and microscopic alike --- that work together to pollinate,
nourish, and ultimately sustain all of the plants and animals we
consume.]{.underline} According to the UN Food and Agriculture
Organization, for example, the alarming drop in the global bee
population could upend agriculture as we know it.

[Species extinction and habitat destruction also mean **forfeiting the**
untapped **potential** of our natural world **to yield new medicines**
for treating health problems]{.underline}. In fact, 70% of all cancer
drugs today are natural or bio-inspired products. And scientists are
still discovering new species each year, including a fungus that can eat
plastic.

Nature also provides significant and often underestimated mental health
benefits for people. Dr. Maria Neira, Director of the Department of
Environment, Climate Change and Health for the World Health
Organization, witnessed this firsthand while working in refugee camps in
Central America. There, she helped launch a project to grow traditional
medicinal herbs that helped displaced families cultivate a sense of
purpose, community, and beauty in an otherwise desperate situation.

"You rely on nature if you want to survive: It gives you food, it gives
you water, it gives you trees that will protect the quality of the air
you breathe," Dr. Neira says. "It's common sense: You need to protect
what is protecting you. If we don't, we are the losers, not the planet."

NT-RaS

[The frigid waters of the Arctic may harbor the secret to a totally new
type of antibiotic, new research suggests.]{.underline}

[Scientists have discovered that substances made by **Arctic Ocean
microbes called actinobacteria** can **stop** harmful bacteria from
growing and prevent them from causing **disease**.]{.underline}

Around 70% of existing antibiotics were discovered in actinobacteria,
most of whom live in soil on land. However, bacteria are
becoming increasingly resistant to existing antibiotics, meaning that
new drugs are urgently needed.

[So, researchers looked to sea-dwelling actinobacteria for new
antibiotics.]{.underline} The sea-dwelling microbes are thought to
produce a more chemically diverse array of compounds than their
land-dwelling counterparts make. This is because of the selective
pressure created by the extreme fluctuations in pressure, temperature,
salt concentrations and light levels that occur in marine environments.

In the new study, scientists analyzed hundreds of unknown compounds that
had been extracted from actinobacteria living inside invertebrates. The
samples were collected during an expedition to the Arctic Ocean in 2020.
Specifically, they tested how the compounds affected a pathogenic type
of E. coli called enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC). These bacteria infect
intestinal cells and cause severe diarrhea, particularly in children.

Next, scientists looked at whether compounds produced by four species of
actinobacteria could stop EPEC bacteria from infecting lab-grown cells.
They found that two compounds had particularly strong antibacterial
properties: one from a strain of actinobacteria from
the Rhodococcus genus and another from a strain belonging to
the Kocuria genus. They described their findings in a paper published
Friday (Aug. 30) in the journal Frontiers in Microbiology.

The [**compounds stopped** EPEC **bacteria from attaching to the cell**
surface and injecting substances that allow the microbes to hijack their
molecular machinery and cause disease, the team found.]{.underline}

However, while the Kocuria bacteria produced compounds that slowed the
growth of EPEC bacteria, the compound from Rhodococcus bacteria
didn\'t. If the bacteria are alive, but harmless to a host, there is
less selection pressure for them to develop resistance to the compound.
As such, the Rhodococcus compound could be a more promising candidate
for a new antibiotic, the team said in a statement.

A lot more work must be done before either of these compounds could be
brought to market.

\"We have so far only done in vitro \[lab\] studies, so we are still
very far from knowing if the compounds have any actual significance in
terms of clinical use,\" Päivi Tammela, study co-author and a professor
of pharmaceutical biology at the University of Helsinki in Finland, told
Live Science.

For instance, a big hurdle to overcome is figuring out how to produce
larger amounts of these compounds that would allow scientists to study
their structures and biological activity in more detail, Tammela said.

Nonetheless, the team has **[high hopes for the future of this
research]{.underline}**, with Tammela stating that it is [\"absolutely\"
possible that many more of these compounds are waiting to be discovered
in the depths.]{.underline}

Catastrophic consequences for civilization. [The consequences
of]{.underline} this [rapid pruning of the evolutionary tree of life
extend beyond the obvious]{.underline}. There could be surprising
effects of biodiversity loss that scientists are unable to fully
anticipate in advance. For example, prior research has shown that
[localized ecosystems can undergo **abrupt** and **irreversible** shifts
when they reach a **tipping** point. According to a 2012 paper published
in Nature,]{.underline} there are reasons for thinking that [[we
may]{.mark} be **[approach]{.mark}**ing [a **tipping
point**]{.mark}]{.underline} of this sort [[in]{.mark} the [**global**
ecosystem]{.mark}, beyond which the consequences could be
**[catastrophic for civilization]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As the authors
write, [[a **planetary-scale transition** could precipitate
"**substantial losses** of ecosystem]{.mark} [services **required to
sustain the human population**]{.mark}."]{.underline} An ecosystem
service is any ecological process that benefits humanity, such as food
production and crop pollination. If the global ecosystem were to cross a
tipping point and substantial ecosystem services were lost, [the
[results could be]{.mark} "**widespread social [unrest]{.mark}**,
**[econ]{.mark}omic [instability]{.mark}**, [and **loss of**]{.mark}
**human [life]{.mark}**." According to Missouri Botanical Garden
ecologist Adam Smith, one of the paper's co-authors, this could occur in
a matter of decades---far more quickly than most of the expected
consequences of climate change]{.underline}, yet equally destructive.
[**[Biod]{.mark}**iversity [loss is a **"threat multiplier"**]{.mark}
that, by [pushing societies to]{.mark} the brink of [collapse]{.mark},
[will **exacerbate**]{.mark} **existing [conflicts]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} introduce entirely new struggles between state and
non-state actors. Indeed, it could even [fuel]{.mark} the rise of
**[terrorism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. (After all, [climate change has
been linked to the emergence of ISIS in Syria, and multiple high-ranking
US officials, such as former US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and CIA
director John Brennan, have affirmed that climate change and terrorism
are connected]{.underline}.) The reality is that we are entering the
sixth mass extinction in the 3.8-billion-year history of life on Earth,
and the impact of this event could be felt by civilization "in as little
as three human lifetimes," as the aforementioned 2012 Nature paper
notes. Furthermore, the widespread decline of biological populations
could plausibly initiate a dramatic transformation of the global
ecosystem on an even faster timescale: perhaps a single human lifetime.
The unavoidable conclusion is that [**[biod]{.mark}**iversity loss
[constitutes an **existential threat**]{.mark}]{.underline} in its own
right. As such, [it ought to be considered **along**side]{.underline}
**[climate change]{.underline}** and nuclear weapons [[as]{.mark} one of

The AMOC is like a giant conveyor belt in the Atlantic Ocean: warm water
travels in the upper layers from south to north. Once the water reaches
its northernmost point, it sinks and travels southwards in a cold, deep
layer until it reaches the southern oceans, where it rises back up to
the surface. **[The [AMOC]{.mark} therefore [has a crucial role in the
global distribution of heat,]{.mark} salt and other components of
seawater.]{.underline}**

The system called the [[A]{.mark}tlantic [M]{.mark}eridional
[O]{.mark}verturning [Ci]{.mark}rculation]{.underline} (warm water in
red, cold water in blue; artist's illustration) **[[would
survive]{.mark}, although in [weakened]{.mark} form, [even with extreme
climate]{.mark} change.]{.underline}**Credit: Jonathan Baker (Met
Office) and co-authors

The intensity of the AMOC has declined over time2, a trend traced to
polar ice melt, changes in wind patterns and precipitation changes
linked to climate change. Although scientists agree that the
**[[collapse]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the [AMOC would]{.mark} have
[devastat]{.mark}ing consequences for local and regional
[climates,]{.mark}]{.underline}** they are divided on whether and when
such an event would occur.

Studies of the AMOC's future generally rely on analyses of its past
behaviour and on models that simulate future scenarios under different
climate conditions. Some have concluded that the AMOC would reach a
tipping point sometime between 2025 and 2095, then abruptly shut down3.
Other research indicates that a collapse is unlikely before the end of
the century2, but scientists had not previously identified the factors
that might be stopping it from happening.

A passel of models

[Baker and his team used 34 climate models to examine how the AMOC might
respond to 2 extreme scenarios]{.underline}: a four-fold increase in
carbon-dioxide levels from pre-industrial levels; and the addition of
massive amounts of freshwater, consistent with the melting of the
Greenland ice sheet. [The team found that the AMOC would weaken in both
scenarios, but not collapse.]{.underline}

**[[Key to the stability]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Baker and his team
suggest, **[[are powerful]{.mark} winds in the Southern Ocean that help
to drive deep water in the region towards the surface]{.underline}**.
This "**[[upwelling"]{.mark} has a crucial role in maintaining the AMOC
because it balances out the "downwelling" in the northern
Atlantic]{.underline}**.

The ocean is hotter than ever: what happens next?

**[Baker and his team also found that the [AMOC would collapse
if]{.mark} a Pacific Meridional Overturning Circulation developed and
[increased]{.mark} the [amount of downwelling.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
And although this circulation pattern does develop in all their models,
it is too weak to counteract the rising water, Baker says.

The increasing demand for raw materials to meet the modern life needs
has directed attention to the potential of deep-sea mining as a possible
and economically viable source for mineral extraction. [Polymetallic
crusts ([PMC)]{.mark} on seamounts, polymetallic nodules ([PMN]{.mark})
on abyssal plans [and]{.mark} polymetallic sulphides ([PMS)]{.mark} [on
mid-ocean ridges]{.mark} can [supply]{.mark} [raw materials]{.mark} such
as copper, nickel, cobalt, iron, manganese [and r]{.mark}are
[e]{.mark}arth [e]{.mark}lements to feed the growing need of the
industry]{.underline} \[1,2\]. However, **[[the majority of
these]{.mark} metals [are]{.mark} found in mineral resources [located
close to vulnerable ecosystems]{.mark}]{.underline}** \[3--6\].
**[[The]{.mark} potential [hazards associated]{.mark} with deep-sea
mining activities [are already a concern]{.mark} for the international
scientific community]{.underline}**, which is committed to understand
the impacts of these activities on the deep-sea ecosystems. This is a
major goal in several international research projects, such as Blue
Mining1, MIDAS2, Mining Impact3, Abyssline4, EMINENT5, among others.
Results from these projects demonstrated that the ecosystems are
immediately hit and strongly affected after mining activities.
Nevertheless, and despite the importance of deep-sea ecosystems for
biotechnology applications, the International Seabed Authority (ISA), at
the time of publication of this manuscript, had already granted nineteen
exploration contracts to explore PMN6, seven to explore PMS7 and five to
explore Cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts8. To protect deep-sea
ecosystems, ISA has been working on the development of Regional
Environmental Management Plans (REMP) \[5\], designed for a preventive
management of deep-sea regions from generalized human activities, and
not specifically for mining. ISA Council have adopted the first REMP for
the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ)9, a PMN rich abyssal region. Although
the CCZ-REMP could be used as an initial standard for the definition of
others REMPs, for ridge and seamounts the features and mining techniques
may differ from those used at abyssal regions, requiring the evaluation
of new considerations based on sound scientific results. Therefore, the
Northern Mid-Atlantic Region (NMAR) REMP is still under consideration
since the ISA Council is still delineating standardized procedures for
the development, review and approval of REMPs.10The NMAR presents
relevant deposits of PMS interesting for the industry, close to active
hydrothermal fields with unique ecosystems11 \[7\]. Although the
creation of NMAR-REMP was postponed by ISA Council, its PMS deposits are
likely to be commercially explored in the future, since the first
lifting test for mining Seafloor Massive Sulphides (SMS) successfully
lifted SMS ore from a depth of 1.600 m to the lifting vessel \[8,9\].
However, the description of this technology does not include the
approach that will be selected to eliminate seawater with mining
particles which has been raised to the surface jointly with the
collected material. **[There is a consensus that [the major impact
of]{.mark} PMS [mining]{.mark} at the deep-sea [will be loss of
substrate, dispersion and sedimentation]{.mark} of possible near floor
collecting and return sediment plumes]{.underline}** \[10\], being the
size of the fragments present in these plumes greatly dependent on the
mining method adopted \[11--13\]. For instance, modelling efforts to
evaluate the environmental impact associated with the Solwara-1 deep-sea
mining project, developed to mine mineral-rich hydrothermal vents at the
Bismark Sea, considered data from unconsolidated sediments and hard rock
particles removed by the collector vehicle \[14\]. For the modelling of
the dispersion and settling of the particles, the average of the
classical classification of grain sizes, ranging from \<4 μm to 1000 μm,
were considered to set the particles size. Other previous works, due to
absence of a consensus on the extraction methods, also adopted a similar
approach \[15--17\], but for sites that present at least a thin
unconsolidated particle layer or discrete particles at active
hydrothermal vents. Therefore, the lack of knowledge about the size of
particles generated during mining activities leads scientists to produce
models for a wide granulometry range. Furthermore, it must be also taken
into account that **[[the depth of waste discharge is]{.mark} currently
[not consensual]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Three strategies for the return
of sediment-laden water are under consideration: i) release as a return
plume in the midwater column, typically below the mixed layer depth; ii)
a near-bottom release aiming on depositing the sediment in a region that
has already been impacted by the collector operations; and iii) send
back to the collector vehicle to become part of the collector plume
\[11,12\]. **[Although [there is no consensus of which]{.mark}
[d]{.mark}eep-[s]{.mark}ea [m]{.mark}ining [tech]{.mark}nology [is the
least harmful]{.mark},]{.underline}** among the emerging methods,
**[[the commonly proposed]{.mark} is the hydrodynamic suction pick-up
mechanism]{.underline}**. In this methodology, the collector vehicle
will resuspend the bottom sediments and part of it will be discharged in
its wake, producing a collector plume. The resuspend sediments kept in
the collector will be lifted to the operation vessel and, after being
separated from the target fragments, will be subsequently discharged at
depth, producing the so-called midwater plume \[11--13\]. The evolution
of both collector and midwater plumes occurs in three different regions,
comprising different phases. The initial phase (the near-field region)
is controlled by the discharge conditions, characterized by the dominant
effect of inertial and turbulent processes in the immediate vicinity of
the mining equipment. The second phase (the transition zone) is
buoyancy-driven, where the suspended sediment interacts with the
surrounding ocean environment. The last phase (the far-field region) is
characterized by the passive advection of the plume by local currents,
horizontal and vertical diffusion by ambient turbulence, seabed
topography constraints, and the settling and deposition of the sediment.
By definition, this last phase is concerned with sufficiently low
sediment mass concentrations such that buoyancy driven currents no
longer plays a dominant role in transporting the sediments
\[11--13,18,19\]. The spatial and temporal scales of the flow dynamics
between the near- and far-field regions range from few hundreds of
meters to kilometers, and from minutes to several days, respectively
\[11,18\]. **[The local impacts]{.underline}** in the near-field region
**[may be related to sediment redeposition and bottom blanketing, which
can potentially [bury benthic organisms, clog]{.mark} the [respiratory
filter feeders and pollute the]{.mark} benthic organisms [food
supply]{.mark}]{.underline}** \[20\]. The extension of the far-field
region is particularly relevant for the quantification of the
environmental impact of deep-sea mining sediment plumes since it could
harm a wide range of benthic and pelagic organisms \[12\]. The spatial
scales of the impact for both vehicle-generated and midwater return
plumes may be on the order of hundreds of square kilometers for nodule
habitats, tens of square kilometers for crust habitats and less than
tens of square kilometers for vent habitats \[21\]. In particular,
**[current direction and topography greatly influence the extent of
mining impacts in a deep-sea floor massive sulphides]{.underline}**
\[22\]. The rugged topography of hydrothermal regions can largely alter
the plume extent and residence time of rock-fragments in the water
column, depending on sub- to mesoscale features related to topographic
constraints or the free passage of currents through flatter regions.
Furthermore, **[[changes in]{.mark} ocean [currents induced by remotely
generated]{.mark} [eddies]{.mark} were shown to [have great effect on
the trajectory and]{.mark} resulting [deposition patterns]{.mark} of a
deep-sea collector plume]{.underline}** \[11\]. Indeed, **[observational
studies have shown that [the circulation at regions]{.mark} deeper than
4 km can [become an order of magnitude more energetic in
response]{.mark} to the passage of mesoscale eddies, [when
mining-related plumes are expected to have a wider and faster spreading
and dispersion]{.mark}]{.underline}** \[23\]. Therefore, the absent of
in situ information on the dispersion of rock-fragments from PMS mining,
and some limitations of the few previous works \[14,16,17\], reinforces
the needs of dedicated studies for a comprehensive characterization of
each hydrothermal region specificities. **[The topography and depth of
each region can considerably change the local and regional circulation
patterns, which has a direct effect on the dispersion and spatial
extension of the mining-generated rock-fragments]{.underline}**. Coupled
ocean circulation and Lagrangian models are key tools to provide a
reliable representation of ocean dynamics over a wide range of temporal
and spatial scales. Hydrodynamic models have been used to simulate
complex deep-sea circulation in regions with abruptly changing
topography, such as canyons, ridges and seamounts \[16,24--31**[\].
These models can reproduce the disturbances in the local density field
induced by the morphology of these regions, which contribute to eddy
formation, topographically-induced up/downwelling and circulation
constraints]{.underline}**. The coupling of Lagrangian and hydrodynamic
models can account for the impacts of the deep-sea circulation on the
behaviour of small elements, including dispersion and recruitment, such
as plankton, crustaceans, fish and larvae \[30--34\], oil spills
\[35,36\], sediments \[16,17,37,38\] and passive drifters \[29\].
However, it should be emphasized that **[[oceanic
transport]{.mark}]{.underline}** forecasting **[[can be highly
sensitive]{.mark}]{.underline}** to changes in spatial and temporal
resolution of the ocean circulation model outputs**[.]{.underline}** For
instance, coarser configurations may overestimate the likelihood
transport path by averaging out meanders and eddies that would otherwise
promote retention \[39\].

[The [Arctic is a unique and vital]{.mark} marine [environment]{.mark},
[home to]{.mark} one of the world's most fragile and [diverse
ecosystems]{.mark}, crucial for global climate regulation and supporting
a wide array of species found nowhere else on Earth.]{.underline} The
recent decision by Norway to open up 281,200 km2 of its claim to an
extended continental shelf to [**[deep sea mining is putting ocean
life]{.mark}** and the livelihoods of those who depend on it [at **grave
risk**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The remote offshore waters of the Arctic seas teem with life.
Deep-diving sperm whales and northern bottlenose whales in their search
for squid are among the animals that connect the surface waters with the
deep ocean below. The underwater environment of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge
is made up of a diverse mix of seamounts, ridges, canyons and
extraordinary hydrothermal vent fields, the result of the volcanic
activity that occurs where two tectonic plates rub up against each
other. The spring explosion of phytoplankton fuels a complex and dynamic
food web where tiny copepods and other zooplankton are fed on by
numerous creatures. These include huge shoals of herring, mackerel and
blue whiting, and thousands of baleen whales that make their way north
from the warm waters where they breed to make the most of the annual
Arctic bonanza. It is also a seasonal migration route for globally
important populations of seabirds.

Despite the absence of light, the marine life thousands of metres under
the waves is remarkably diverse. A mosaic of sponge assemblages and
coral gardens provide habitat for many invertebrate and fish species
that utilise them as spawning, nursery and foraging grounds, and as
areas of refuge.

The communities that live around the deep sea hydrothermal vent fields
are even stranger: they are home to creatures such as stalked jellyfish,
tube worm 'forests', fish that produce antifreeze and 'hairy' shrimps
hosting colonies of bacteria that can convert toxic hydrogen sulphides
and methane into energy.1 These are unique habitats with endemic species
that can be found nowhere else on Earth, including ones that have yet to
be scientifically described. 

[[It is]{.mark} these [**vulnerable habitats** that]{.mark} the
Norwegian [government wants to carve up with underwater]{.mark} [robots
and]{.mark} other [noisy machinery for the metals]{.mark} found in the
manganese crusts formed on seamounts and the seafloor massive sulphide
(SMS) deposits around hydrothermal vent fields.]{.underline}

[**[D]{.mark}eep [s]{.mark}ea [m]{.mark}ining companies' [disregard for
marine life]{.mark}** and the warnings of scientists extends beyond
Arctic ecosystems]{.underline}, more precisely in the Clarion-Clipperton
Zone (CCZ), a vast area in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico and Hawaii
[where highly risky plans to extract polymetallic nodules are being
pursued.]{.underline} [A recent scientific study has revealed that
**these [nodules]{.mark} may be [play]{.mark}ing a [key role]{.mark} in
[producing oxygen]{.mark} in the deep sea without
photosynthesis**]{.underline}.2 This unexpected finding is indicative of
how little we know about how deep sea ecosystems function. It has
quickly influenced the political agenda, spurring calls for further
investigation into the 'dark oxygen' phenomenon, [and represents yet
another reason why we must take a precautionary approach]{.underline}.
[Gathering the baseline data for deep sea ecosystems requires time, and
deep sea mining is a dangerous gamble against it.]{.underline}

This report showcases much of what is known about the amazing marine
life of the Arctic seas -- but more than that, it reveals how many
questions there are still to be answered. This requires [gathering more
information about the distribution of [species and habitats]{.mark} in
the area, their [ecosystem functions]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the
[ocean]{.mark}ographic conditions and how they might be [impacted
by]{.mark} any future [mining operations]{.mark}]{.underline}. As
Norway's own Institute of Marine Research (IMR) has stated, [the lack of
baseline data means that it is impossible to comprehensively assess the
full environmental impact of any proposed deep sea mining
operations]{.underline}.3 In the context of the rapid environmental
changes, rising sea temperature and ocean acidification that the area is
currently experiencing, the need for more baseline research is even more
urgent. Enough knowledge is already available to understand that, [as
the Deep Sea Mining Science [Statement puts it]{.mark}]{.underline},
'[[d]{.mark}eep-[s]{.mark}ea [m]{.mark}ining [would add to]{.mark} these
[stressors]{.mark}, [resulting in the **loss of**]{.mark}
[**biodiversity and ecosystem functioning** that would be]{.mark}
**[irreversible on multi-generational
timescales']{.mark}**]{.underline}. 4 This statement is [**[signed by
more than 800]{.mark} marine science and policy [experts]{.mark},** and
the list of scientists, governments, companies and further stakeholders
warning against deep sea mining is constantly growing. ]{.underline}

While the deep sea mining industry is being held at bay across the
world, [there is **[growing evidence]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} any
[future]{.mark} [d]{.mark}eep [s]{.mark}ea [m]{.mark}ining [operations
will have]{.mark} multiple '**[extensive]{.mark} and
[irreversible]{.mark}, [permanent and immitigable']{.mark}** [impacts on
the]{.mark} marine [ecosystem]{.mark}]{.underline}.5 There is the
**[[distinct possibility of]{.mark} [making species
extinct]{.mark}]{.underline}** even before scientists have had a chance
to describe and catalogue them. And these impacts won't be confined to
the destruction of the seabed and associated benthic communities.
[[Sediment plumes generated]{.mark} at the seafloor and as discharge
from vessels on the surface risk [impact]{.mark}ing on [species]{.mark}
beyond the mine site and in the water column]{.underline}.. [[Noise

the [behaviour of]{.mark} whales and other
[creatures]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even the [[artificial lighting]{.mark}

that are only just being uncovered.]{.underline} Then there is always
the inherent [[risk of major accidents occurring with]{.mark} the use of
[new technology]{.mark} far from land, in an extremely tricky
environment]{.underline} -- there is, on average, one underwater
volcanic eruption in Norwegian deep sea areas every single year.

**Despite recent studies on connectivity at active vents, including on
the MAR and IORs \[116,119,136,141,170,177--185\], [[there are]{.mark}
still a number of [obstacles]{.mark} and limitations to understanding
these processes fully]{.underline} \[83,186\] (Fig. 1). Coupled
biophysical models incorporating ocean circulation and biological
traits, such as planktonic larval duration, have been used to estimate
population connectivity in coastal and shallow waters. However,
knowledge gaps in the physical and biological com- ponents of the vent
ecosystems (e.g., mesoscale ocean physics, high-resolution bathymetry,
vertical velocity, the spatial distribution of habitat types,
reproductive efforts of species, [planktonic larval duration, larval
behavior, the [identification of source populations]{.mark}), even for
the more studied active vents of the MAR, prevent accurate
modeling.]{.underline} The fate of larvae and mining plumes will only be
approximated if detailed physical measurements (horizontal and vertical
currents and eddies, overflow from mid-ocean axial valley, mixing, etc.)
are made in the vicinity of the mine sites and the region \[83,125\]
(Fig. 1). Additionally, species that do not disperse via larvae,
including directly-developing macrofaunal or meiofaunal species, require
further study \[128\]. More- over, faunal connections between active
hydrothermal vents and other chemosynthetic habitats requires further
understanding as these may play a role preventing [[population
extirpations and species extinctions]{.mark},]{.underline}** **serving

These companies' pursuit of precious metals plays out in one of the

[[Biodiversity]{.mark}, as an aggregated term, or in this case,

Simultaneously -- global warming presents a global threat to
biodiversity. As diversified and increased access to critical minerals

[[Impacts on SMS deposits]{.underline}]{.mark}

[The [drilling]{.mark}]{.underline} or suction [[of SMS deposits]{.mark}
will have a direct physical [impact]{.mark} on [the seabed]{.mark}, by
removing substrate and [flattening the topography]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Additionally, the [[movement of machinery]{.mark} will likely
[compress]{.mark} [sediment]{.mark}]{.underline}. It may also alter the
circulation of the vent fields. [This [destruction of]{.mark} vital
[habitat]{.mark} will consequently [change]{.mark} or destroy the
[associated benthic communities and]{.mark}]{.underline} may
[l[eave]{.underline}]{.mark} [the affected [areas]{.mark} [unsuitable
for future recovery]{.mark} and recolonization.]{.underline} Endemic
species may be made extinct. While the Norwegian government has said
future mining operations will not mine active hydrothermal vents but
rather will focus on the SMS deposits associated with inactive vents,
the evidence presented in this report shows that [[these activities will
still destroy]{.mark} unique [benthic communities]{.mark}]{.underline}.
It should also be noted that inactive vents are not necessarily extinct
and may be associated with active hydrothermal vents as part of a large
vent field. [In such cases the overall field will still be
hydrothermally connected to its heat source, and so all the vents within
the field have the potential to resume activity]{.underline}.176 The
biological communities of the AMOR vent fields are only just beginning
to be described, and little is known about the connectivity between
them. Recent research investigating the relationships between vent sites
in the Northwest Pacific found that though the sites were isolated there
were pathways by which larvae of some species, aided by ocean currents,
were dispersed to other vent sites.177 [This research implies that the
[damage to a single hydrothermal vent could impact other vent
sites]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Impacts on seamounts]{.underline}

[The [removal of cobalt crusts from seamounts]{.mark} will [cause
widespread mortality to]{.mark} the [benthic]{.mark}
[communities]{.mark}]{.underline} living there. Studies have shown how
destructive [deep sea trawling]{.underline} is to benthic communities,

[s]{.mark}ea [m]{.mark}ining, with its complete removal of substrate,
will [cause even more harm]{.mark}]{.underline}.178 As well as the

days, while the sponge's metabolism was compromised. The researchers
concluded that a precautionary approach to deep sea mining is vital to
prevent indirect impacts and ensure that sponge mediated benthic-pelagic
coupling mechanisms and other ecosystem services are not disrupted.

[Sediment plumes]{.underline}

[[Sediment plumes]{.underline}]{.mark} may be [[generate]{.mark}d [at
two stages in the mining process]{.mark}:]{.underline} [a seafloor
sediment plume]{.underline} is discharged [[during the extraction
stage]{.underline} [and]{.underline}]{.mark} [a midwater
plume]{.underline} is produced by the discharge of unwanted sediment and
water when it is separated from the ore [[during
'dewatering']{.underline}]{.mark}. These [[plumes]{.underline}]{.mark}
are [likely to [impact]{.mark}]{.underline} on [[species]{.mark} both
[at the seabed and in the water column]{.mark}, [with]{.mark} the
[potential]{.mark}]{.underline} for fine sediments and dissolved metals
[[to be dispersed]{.mark} over large areas]{.underline}. A 2020 paper
authored by 19 scientists argues that the potential [impacts of sediment
plumes produced by deep sea mining]{.underline} operations have been
somewhat overlooked compared to the benthic impacts and that they [pose
significant risks to midwater organisms -- especially important
suspension feeders such as crustaceans, polychaetes and salps -- and
ecosystems]{.underline}.180The authors identified a number of
[ways]{.underline} in which [[sediment]{.mark}
[plumes]{.mark}]{.underline} may [[impact midwater organisms]{.mark},
includ]{.underline}ing[:]{.underline} • [[Diluting the food
available]{.mark} to suspension feeders and clogging fragile mucous
filter nets with fine sediment particles • [Reducing]{.mark} the
buoyancy of gelatinous [plankton]{.mark} through the adhesion of fine
sediment • [Shifting]{.mark} the [structure]{.mark} and function
[of]{.mark} [microbial communities]{.mark} that regenerate essential
nutrients for the pelagic ecosystem • [Introducing toxic metals to
the]{.mark} pelagic [environment]{.mark} [that]{.mark} may [persist for
years]{.mark} and travel vast distances • [Altering]{.mark} the
[absorption of lig]{.mark}ht and change backscatter properties, thus
[interfering]{.mark} [with]{.mark} the [visual communication]{.mark} and
bioluminescent signalling [that]{.mark} these [animals rely]{.mark} on
for prey capture and reproduction186 • [Creating population
effects]{.mark}, such as changes in both horizontal and vertical
emigration and changes in community composition, [which]{.mark} could
then [lead]{.mark} [to]{.mark} further [reductions in ecosystem
services]{.mark}]{.underline}. How the plumes behave will be dependent
on the type of deposit mined, on local currents, and on the mining
technology, but the volumes of these plumes will be immense. For
example, it has been estimated that a hydrothermal vent operation could
discharge as much as 22,000 to 38,000 m3 per day of a mix of seawater
and fine sediments.181 As yet no information is available regarding the
potential impacts of sediment plumes from future mining operations on
the Norwegian extended continental shelf, but a [modelling
exercise]{.underline} investigating the dispersion of SMS plumes in the
Mid-Atlantic Ridge around the Azores [showed]{.underline} likely
far-reaching effects and [how [sediment]{.mark} [would be carried
to]{.mark} areas inhabited by vulnerable [cold-water corals and other
areas important for fisheries]{.mark}.]{.underline} The authors also
note that 'climate-related changes in ocean circulation and deep water
mass properties (e.g., warming, ocean acidification, and deoxygenation)'
will have an effect on the dispersal of plumes and the toxicity of
associated metals and so need to be considered when assessing future
impacts.182

#### Noise and light pollution interfere with marine species ability to communicate

[Noise pollution]{.underline}

[[Underwater noise]{.underline}]{.mark} -- at a range of frequencies and
throughout the water column -- [will be]{.underline} [[generated by the
undersea]{.mark} machinery]{.underline}, the powerful pumping systems
that lift the mined ore and the surface support vessels, all of which
are expected to be working [around the clock in any future [deep sea
mining]{.mark} operations.]{.underline} As Jeffrey Drazen, professor in
the Department of Oceanography at the University of Hawaii, describes
it: 'If you're mining sulphide deposits or crusts on sea mounts, you
have to actually grind that hard substrate off of the bottom or out of
the sea floor. That's going to be incredibly noisy ... \[and\] because
of the temperature and salinity profiles of the ocean sound is conducted
for very long distances. So this [[is bad news]{.underline}]{.mark}.'183
[It has been noted by others that '[anthropogenic noise]{.mark} is known
to [impact]{.mark} a number of [fish species and marine mammals by
inducing behaviour changes, masking communication and causing]{.mark}
temporary threshold [shifts in hearing or permanent damage]{.mark},
depending on the species, type of noise and received
level']{.underline}.184 Similar and other issues may arise with other
types of marine life, including invertebrates.185, 186 [As most deep sea
species naturally experience only low levels of noise, noise arising
from deep sea mining operations will be expected to increase ambient
sound levels substantially.]{.underline} Researchers are discovering how
some deep sea fish species communicate using low sound frequencies,187
and one study on deep sea scavenging shrimp suggests they may use
sensitive acoustic systems to detect food falls up to 100 m away.188 Of
special concern are the potential impacts from noise pollution on
cetaceans. [It has recently been recognised that 'the [sounds]{.mark}
produced [from mining operations]{.mark}, including from remotely
operated vehicles (ROVs) on the seafloor, [overlap]{.mark} [with]{.mark}
the [frequencies]{.mark} at [which]{.mark} many [cetaceans
communicate]{.mark}, which can cause auditory masking and behaviour
change']{.underline}.189 [Typical [behavioural]{.mark}
[responses]{.mark} [include avoidance of the area]{.mark} and/or changes
in behaviours such as feeding, nursing, resting or
communication]{.underline}.190 Baleen whales communicate using mid- and
low-frequency sounds that largely overlap with the frequency range of
anthropogenic noise emitted by ships, seismic operations and military
sonar, which means their calls can be partially or completely 'masked'
by them. To compete with the fog of human sound, baleen whales may
adjust the frequency or strength of their calls, which may be
energetically expensive and not necessarily effective.191 Blue whales,
which regularly vocalise during the summer feeding season in the Nordic
Seas, have been found by research conducted in waters of the Southern
California Bight to alter their calling in response to anthropogenic
noise, stopping calling in response to sonar and increasing calls in
response to shipping noise. Behavioural change was recorded even at
frequencies above their own vocal range.192 Northern bottlenose whales,
like other beaked whale species, are thought to have a high sensitivity
to acoustic disturbance and are at risk from increasing
industrialisation. [Studies have shown that in [response to
anthropogenic noise]{.mark} this species may perform abrupt deep dives,
[cease foraging behaviour and avoid source areas for up to 24
hours]{.mark}.]{.underline}193An experimental study investigating the
response of tagged northern bottlenose whales to noise from
mid-frequency sonar, conducted in the acoustically near-pristine waters
of Jan Mayen, found that the animals reacted particularly strongly.194
Both onset and intensity of response were better predicted by received
sound pressure level than by source distance. The research did not
indicate that the source distances tested (0.8--28 km) modulated the
behavioural effects of sonar, as some scientists have suggested it might
for locations where whales are frequently exposed to sonar. A more
recent study comparing the response of four species of whale -- northern
bottlenose, sperm, long-finned pilot and humpback -- found in Norwegian
waters to underwater noise pollution showed that all four respond in the
same way as they have evolved to when detecting the sounds of predatory
orcas.195On being exposed to the noise, the whales stop foraging, which
impacts their energy budgets and makes them more vulnerable, choosing,
as one researcher put it, 'life over dinner'.196

[[Light pollution]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The [machinery used to]{.mark}]{.underline} cut, scrape or [[suction up
SMS deposits]{.underline}]{.mark} and cobalt crusts
[[will]{.underline}]{.mark} most likely [[be]{.mark} [equipped with
strong lights]{.mark} to illuminate the seafloor to enable camera
control of the operations.]{.underline} [Additional light emissions will
come from ROVs used for surveying, inspection and
maintenance.]{.underline} On the surface, the [support vessels will also
be sources of light]{.underline}, similar to those of offshore oil and
gas operations. The introduction of artificial light into the deep ocean
beyond where sunlight penetrates may impact deep sea life in various
ways, some of which have likely not been considered yet because this
would be an entirely novel practice in a realm where the current state
of knowledge is limited. [While [many deep sea organisms]{.mark} lack or
have reduced eyes or light-sensing organs, others, including many deep
sea fishes and invertebrates, have fully developed eyes that are
[sensitive to the]{.mark} low [light]{.mark} levels of
bioluminescence]{.underline}.197Bioluminescence occurs across the deep
ocean and is produced by lots of different organisms ranging from
bacteria to fish, which may use it to communicate, hunt or defend
themselves. Similar to underwater noise, [[artificial light]{.mark}
might [mask signals]{.mark} of species that use bioluminescence to
communicate.]{.underline} Some species may be attracted to the
artificial light produced by deep sea mining machinery, and others may
avoid it. [One possible d[etrimental impact is that organisms attracted
to the light might be harmed or killed by the machinery]{.mark}; another
is that the brightness of the artificial light might damage sensitive
eyes or photoreceptors.]{.underline} This has been suggested as the
cause of retinal damage observed in vent-inhabiting shrimps following
scientific surveys.198 Light from deep sea mining vessels and platforms
may also have an impact. Recent studies conducted around Svalbard have
shown that [[artificial light]{.mark} from both ships and
instrumentation [disrupts the behaviour of fish]{.mark} and zooplankton
down to at least 200 m depth]{.underline}.199 Offshore oil and gas
platforms are known to sometimes cause detrimental impacts to migrating
seabirds, and given the importance of the Nordic Seas to many seabird
populations, the possibility that large numbers of them might be
attracted to deep sea mining sites is a matter for concern.200 In the
North Sea, migrating seabirds are attracted to platforms and some die,
perhaps because the light affects their internal compasses.201The waters
of the Grand Banks in the Northwest Atlantic are, like the Nordic Seas,
an important area for migrating seabirds including planktivorous puffins
and guillemots/common murres, and scientists have raised concerns about
offshore hydrocarbon developments there because of the possible impacts
on seabirds.202

#### Accidents from DSM cause release of pollutants and spills over to other ecosystems

[Accidents]{.underline}

[With]{.underline} all [[industrial activities in]{.mark}]{.underline}
the [[maritime environment]{.mark} there comes the]{.underline}
concomitant [[risk]{.mark} of [accident]{.mark}]{.underline}. For
[[d]{.mark}eep [s]{.mark}ea [m]{.mark}ining]{.underline} using new and
untested technologies in extreme environments, the [[risks are
high]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[with accidents]{.mark} potentially [leading
to]{.mark}]{.underline} damage to or loss of vessels and/ or mining
equipment. In the worst instances, accidents could result in
[[unsalvageable wreckage]{.mark} littering the seabed [and]{.mark}/or
the [release of]{.mark} oil and other [pollutants]{.mark}]{.underline}.
According to Xingsen Guo, a research fellow at University College
London, the [extreme environmental conditions present significant
challenges to mining operations]{.underline}, with machines operating on
steep seamount slopes facing an elevated risk of serious accident due to
possible issues such as subsidence and slippage.203 Although mining
activities exacerbate the risks, even without the presence of mining
vehicles '[[geologic disasters]{.mark} may [occur]{.mark} in seabed
mining sites [due]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the [instability of the
seabed]{.mark} under the action of external loads \[including\] tectonic
action, gravity, hydrodynamic action, gas release and changes in pore
pressure']{.underline}.204 Cumulative and synergistic impacts of deep
sea mining It has been argued that the various impacts of [[d]{.mark}eep
[s]{.mark}ea [m]{.mark}ining will 'c[ause]{.mark} [unavoidable,
irreversible harm to deep-sea ecosystems]{.mark} and \[put\] the health
of the wider ocean at risk', with these [activities]{.mark}
'[add]{.mark}ing to other [stressors, including]{.mark} various forms of
[pollution]{.mark} (litter, noise and chemical), [poor fisheries
management and climate change']{.mark}]{.underline}.205There is also
potential for synergistic effects, and [impacts could become more
unpredictable over time]{.underline}. For example, [[changes in
ocean]{.mark} [chemistry]{.mark} may [disrupt]{.mark} key [ecological
processes affecting]{.mark} deep sea [biological]{.mark}
[productivity]{.mark}, which in turn could result in 'knock-on effects
that we cannot currently comprehend or predict]{.underline}'.206
Connectivity between deep seabed habitats and broader ecosystem
functions, such as carbon fixation, cycling and storage, nutrient
cycling, metal cycling and productivity, are poorly understood. Recent
research is revealing new insights, such as the finding that the
contribution of hydrothermal vents to surface productivity is greater
than expected. This adds to the body of knowledge that implies that
[[damage to deep sea ecosystems by deep sea mining would likely have
far-reaching consequences]{.mark}.]{.underline}207 [Given the
disturbance deep sea mining will cause to the seabed, the potential for
significant effects on carbon cycling and storage in the deep ocean has
been raised.]{.underline}208

### 2nc---link---small scale has worst impacts 

#### DSM fails at a small scale, which will be horrible in the Arctic.

**Baraniuk 25**, Science and Technology Journalist at BBC, First Class
Degree from the University of Oxford. (Chris, 3-7-2025, "Deep-sea mining
tech advances but doubts remain," BBC,
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg45zwe0v0ro).

[Such a system is not likely to convince everyone that
[d]{.mark}eep-[s]{.mark}ea [m]{.mark}ining is a good idea,]{.underline}
however. [\"Mining [would]{.mark} by its nature [remove the very
substrate of life]{.mark} in and [on the]{.mark} deep [seafloor, no
matter the tech]{.mark}nology,]{.underline}\" says Jessica Battle, who
leads the global no deep-seabed mining initiative at the WWF. Deep-sea
mining is highly controversial partly because the deep seabed is more or
less untouched and [still relatively poorly understood. \"If you\'re not
sure what\'s down there, then leave it alone,\"]{.underline} says John
Childs at Lancaster University. \"That\'s been the widespread position
from science \[to date\].\" [[Scars left by mining experiments]{.mark}
in the past, using older, highly disruptive technologies, [have been
severe]{.mark}.]{.underline} In 1979, deep-sea mining equipment made
large tracks in one part of the Pacific Ocean seabed and these remain
there today, researchers say. Wildlife has reportedly still not fully
returned to the area 40 years later. [Opposition to deep-sea mining has
been fierce enough to scupper entire companies.]{.underline} Nautilus
Minerals sought to begin deep-sea mining work in the late 2010s. After
protests and financial upsets, the company went bankrupt in 2019.
Minerals found on the deep seabed including manganese, nickel, cobalt,
gold and silver are all considered important materials for the green
energy transition. Currently, such metals are sourced from mines on
land, which themselves have a significant environmental impact. No
commercial deep sea mining operations are underway today, though that
could change this year if the first set of international regulations
governing these activities is published, possibly in July. Mr
Gunasekara\'s firm is currently building a larger version of its robot
in a 20-foot shipping container, big enough to carry out
commercial-scale operations. It will have 12 robot arms with grabbing
claws. [He adds that \"[hundreds\" of]{.mark} such [bots would need to
harvest the seabed at a time, bringing the spoils to]{.mark} a ship on
[the surface]{.mark}. The recovered nodules would then be transported to
processing sites on land.]{.underline}

### 2nc---impact add on---zoonotic diseases

[The disease ecology community has struggled to come to consensus on
whether biodiversity reduces or increases infectious disease
risk]{.underline}, a question that directly affects policy decisions for
biodiversity conservation and public health. Here, we summarize the
primary points of contention regarding biodiversity--disease
relationships and suggest that [[vector-borne, generalist wildlife and
zoonotic pathogens are the types of parasites most likely to be affected
by changes to biodiversity.]{.mark} [One synthesis]{.mark}]{.underline}
on this [[topic revealed a positive correlation between biodiversity and
human disease burden]{.mark} across countries, but as biodiversity
changed]{.underline} over time within these countries, [this correlation
became weaker and more variable. Another synthesis---[a meta-analysis of
generally smaller-scale experimental and field studies---revealed a
negative correlation between biodiversity and infectious
diseases]{.mark} (a dilution effect) [in various host taxa. These
results raise the question of whether biodiversity--disease
relationships are more negative at smaller spatial scales]{.mark}. If
so, [biodiversity conservation at]{.mark} the [appropriate scales might
prevent wildlife and zoonotic diseases from increasing]{.mark} in
prevalence [or becoming problematic]{.mark} (general proactive
approaches). Further, [protecting natural areas from human incursion
should reduce zoonotic disease spillover]{.mark}.]{.underline} By
contrast, for some infectious diseases, managing particular species or
habitats and targeted biomedical approaches (targeted reactive
approaches) might outperform biodiversity conservation as a tool for
disease control. Importantly, [biodiversity conservation and management
need to be considered alongside other disease management
options.]{.underline} These suggested guiding principles should provide
common ground that can enhance scientific and policy clarity for those
interested in simultaneously improving wildlife and human health.

focus on secure food systems, disease hotspots, human/wildlife
intersections, and crops diseases. 1 'A World at Risk' report
([GPMB]{.underline}, 2019), of the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board,
made the following warning in September 2019: ...[there is a **very**
[**real** **threat** **of** a **rapid**]{.mark}ly moving, highly [lethal
**pandemic**]{.mark} of a respiratory pathogen killing 50 to 80 million
people and wiping out nearly 5% of the world's economy. A **global**
**pandemic** on that scale **would** **be** **[catastrophic]{.mark}**,
creating **widespread** **havoc**, **[instability]{.mark}** and
**insecurity**. The world is not prepared]{.underline}. (Foreword, p.
6). The document argues for seven urgent actions to prepare the world
for global health emergencies including investment in health
infrastructures and 'strong systems' and leadership by regional and
multilateral institutions with appropriate financial risk planning and
development assistance. The nature of the prophetic announcement and
analysis in retrospect demonstrates two related principles: first, how
badly prepared the world has been and how it has failed in general to be
able to institute a 'whole of society approach' at national and global
levels; second, how interconnected the world now is and how preparedness
and treatment critically depends upon recognizing the whole-of-earth
approach which speaks to the United Nations Sustainable Development
Goals and in particular aims of universal education and elimination of
poverty. One aspect that escapes the report that stands out in [the
middle of the Covid-19 health emergency]{.underline} is the
[[**politicization** of the virus]{.mark}]{.underline} not only in terms
of blame and responsibility but also in terms of libertarian politics
that attempts to minimise the risks involved but talking up individual
rights and fear of the state. This [politicization has become **more**
**pronounced** **as**]{.underline} the [**costs** and]{.underline} the
[mismanagement **of**]{.underline} the **[Covid]{.underline}**-19 threat
[[**has** **grown**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[especially]{.mark} in world
states [where]{.mark} national [**populism** **and**]{.mark}
contemporary forms of [**neo**-**fascism** **are** **potent**]{.mark}
**political** **movements**]{.underline}. It is the case that [these
movements are]{.underline} also [associated with blaming tactics and
conspiracy theories to deflect responsibility of administrations that
have not well coordinated social distancing]{.underline}, basic
[hygiene]{.underline}, [mask-wearing]{.underline} and other social
isolation strategies [in the name of collective welfare]{.underline}.
That the current US administration under Donald Trump as should shy away
from its welfare responsibilities at home and abroad indicates the
[**international** **dangers** of diseases spreading rapidly and
**[compromises]{.mark}** any [**global** **coordination**]{.mark}
responses]{.underline}. The real question is how to design a world
health system of preparedness when rogue nation administrations do not
want to join multilateral or world organisations tasked with protecting
all peoples. The problem is highlighted in the often difficult
relationship between science and science advice on the one hand and
politics and policy, on the other. It is a question that has become now
central to most of the related [pressing global issues:]{.underline} the
[growing world arms race]{.underline}; world [ecological
disasters]{.underline}; world [health emergencies and]{.underline} world
[economic development]{.underline}. Laurie Garret (2019), author of The
Coming Plague: Newly Emerging Diseases in a World Out of Balance (1994),
reports In May 1989, Nobel laureate Joshua Lederberg gathered fellow
Nobelists and a roster of extraordinary virus-hunters for a three-day
meeting in Washington to consider a then bold hypothesis that viruses,
far from being vanquished by modern medicine, were actually surging
worldwide in animals and people, often in forms never previously seen.
And air travel increasingly meant that an outbreak in an obscure
location could spread to large cities, even make its way around the
world.
https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/09/20/the-world-knows-an-apocalyptic-pandemic-is-coming/
Peter Daszak (2020) suggests that we are entering a new pandemic era
where an innocent activity like eating wildlife in one locality can,
with global travel and encroaching development, lead to a pandemic. He
indicates that the world's disease hotspots on the edges of tropical
forests provide the habitat for the diversity of wildlife that harbour
an estimated [1.7 million viruses that become easily spread to
humans]{.underline}. The 'great acceleration' of the Anthropocene has
'dramatically altered our planet's landscapes, oceans and atmosphere,
transforming as much as half of the world's tropical forest into
agriculture and human settlements'. In a recent paper 'Emerging Pandemic
Diseases: How We Got to COVID-19' (August, 2020) published in the
journal Cell, Anthony Fauci, working with his colleague, epidemiologist
David Morens, both from National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases (NIAID), 2 also suggest that humanity has entered the pandemic
age. They argue [In addition to]{.underline} ... [established
infections]{.underline}, [new infectious **diseases** **periodically**
**emerge**]{.underline}. In extreme cases they may [**cause**
**pandemics** such as COVID]{.underline}-19; [in other
cases]{.underline}, dead-end infections or [smaller epidemics

**balances** **and** **imbalances**]{.underline}, within complex
globally distributed ecosystems comprising humans, animals, pathogens,
and the environment. Understanding these variables is a necessary step
in controlling future devastating disease emergences.

Fauci's NIAID profile indicates he was appointed Director of NIAID in
1984 with the basic research goal 'to prevent, diagnose, and treat
established infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS, respiratory
infections, diarrheal diseases, tuberculosis and malaria as well as
emerging diseases such as Ebola and Zika'. He advised six Presidents on
HIV/AIDS. NIAID has an estimated \$5.9 billion budget for 2020. 3 His
encounters as one of President Trump's chief scientific advisors has
provided a case study of the thin line between science and politics in
the Covid-19 crisis that has regularly generated conflicts and
conspiracies. Fauci has publicly disagreed with Trump on many issues.
Trump has contradicted the best scientific advice and made claims not
supported by the latest science. Now as the number of deaths in the US
explodes above 215,000 with little sign of improvement, scientists
globally have signalled the mismanagement of the viral crisis by the
Trump government. Various scientific organisations have indicated that
by January the US might be facing a death toll of over 410,000. 4 One of
the burning questions facing us during the Covid-19 pandemic is the
science/politics interface. Many false conspiracy theories have been
generated often deliberately to deflect responsibility, manipulate
populations, and spread misinformation for political purposes. Science
has a role to play not only through informing best policy advice,
through modelling and evidence-based research but also in terms of
scientific communication and public education. Now that Trump has
contracted Covid-19 it seems little has changed in his behaviour as he
has recently openly flouted social distancing and mask-wearing.
Significantly, Morens and Fauci (2020) in their August paper look to the
longer term and the future for global humanity, indicating: '[Newly
emerging (and re-emerging) infectious diseases have been threatening
humans since the neolithic revolution]{.underline}, 12,000 years ago,
when human hunter-gatherers settled into villages to domesticate animals
and cultivate crops'. The historical long-run of 12,000 years is
relatively short when compared to the [evolution of viruses]{.underline}
and the beginning of life on the planet. There is some theoretical
disagreement about whether cells or viruses came first. 5 The fact is
that [**viruses** have been around and **co-evolved with cells**
**over** **3.5 billion years ago**]{.underline}. 6 Recently, [with huge
**[overcrowding]{.mark}** **[and]{.mark}**]{.underline} a
[[projected]{.mark} world [**population** of 10
billion]{.mark}]{.underline} people [[the **environmental** **mix**
has]{.mark} **radically** **[changed]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} rapid and
ongoing **[deforestation]{.mark}**, the spread of urban **slums** and
the growth of **wet** **markets** for wild game. Now [environmental
degradation has become one of the key determinants of disease
emergence]{.mark} with outbreak hot spots where people, domestic
animals, and wild animals are crowded together]{.underline}. Morens and
Fauci (2020) claim 'Evidence suggests that SARS, MERS, and COVID-19 are
only the latest examples of a deadly barrage of coming coronavirus and
other emergences'. They continue Since there are four endemic
coronaviruses that circulate globally in humans, coronaviruses must have
emerged and spread pandemically in the era prior to the recognition of
viruses as human pathogens. The severe acute respiratory syndrome
([SARS]{.underline}) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) emerged from an animal host,
likely a civet cat, in 2002--2003, to cause a near-pandemic before
disappearing in response to public health control measures. The related
Middle East respiratory syndrome ([MERS]{.underline}) coronavirus
([MERS-CoV]{.underline}) emerged into humans from dromedary camels in
2012, but has since been transmitted inefficiently among humans (Cui et
al., 2019). [COVID-19]{.underline}, recognized in late 2019, is but [the
latest example of an]{.underline} unexpected, novel, and [devastating
pandemic disease]{.underline}. [One can conclude from this recent
experience that **we have entered a pandemic era**]{.underline} (Morens,
Breman, et al., 2020; Morens, Daszak, et al., 2020). They provide a
global map of newly emerging coronaviruses that can upset and disrupt
'complex globally distributed ecosystems comprising humans, animals,
pathogens, and the environment'. They argue that we must better
appreciate the dynamic balances and imbalances in the global ecosystem
understanding it as an evolving planetary system increasingly based on
humanity's 'widespread manipulation of nature'.

Citing Richard Dawkins (1976) they comment: 'evolution occurs at the
level of gene competition and we, phenotypic humans, are merely [genetic
"survival machines"]{.underline} in the [competition between microbes
and humans]{.underline}'. The implication is that we need to better
understand the complex relationships between humans, animals and
pathogens that determine the path of evolution, and the emergence of
pandemic diseases brought on by rapid and irreversible destruction of
delicate ecosystems comprising the environment. The narrative is
structured around a '[**doomsday** **clock**]{.underline} argument'
suggesting that soon the [Earth will reach a totally
unsustainable]{.underline} global [population]{.underline} that at the
present rates of growth will [consume]{.underline}, make [extinct and
exhaust]{.underline}, first, all other [animal]{.underline} and
[insect]{.underline} life, while also increasing the risk from eating
wild animals, and, second, the [plant world]{.underline}, with the
possibility of [leading to the total extinction of life on
Earth]{.underline}. This is a process fundamentally caused by human
beings and, at this stage if we act quickly, the argument goes[, it is
still possible to prevent catastrophic pandemics by inventing and
cultivating new eco-practices that are in 'creative harmony' with
nature.]{.underline} The imbalances in the global ecosystem result from
climate warming will help cause large temperature change and massive
fire destruction of native forest and bush environments, the loss and
extinction of wild animal and insect populations, and also consequent
flooding and sea erosion and low-lying coastal environments. In the
short term [it is **necessary** **to**]{.underline} prevent further
deforestation and to [**outlaw** wildlife **trade** in order **to**
**protect** **against** **future** **zoonosis**
**outbreaks**]{.underline}. Andrew Dobson and his colleagues argue For a
century, two new viruses per year have spilled from their natural hosts
into humans (1). The MERS, SARS, and 2009 H1N1 epidemics, and the HIV
and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemics, testify to their
damage. [[Zoonotic]{.mark} viruses infect people directly]{.underline}
most often when they handle live primates, bats, and other wildlife (or
their meat) [or indirectly from farm animals]{.underline} such as
chickens and pigs. [The [**risks** are]{.mark} [**higher** **than**
**ever**]{.mark}]{.underline} ... [[as]{.mark} increasingly **intimate**
[**associations** **between** **humans** **and** wildlife]{.mark}
**disease** **reservoirs** **[accelerate]{.mark}** the [potential
for]{.mark} **viruses** **to** **[spread]{.mark}** globally]{.underline}
(Dobson et al., 2020, p. 378). They suggest that the [[**rate** **of**
**emergence**]{.mark} **of** novel **viruses**
**[and]{.mark}**]{.underline} the [[**costs**]{.mark} **of** its
**econ**omic impacts [**are** **increasing**
exponentially]{.mark}]{.underline}. New research has highlighted the
role domesticated animals -- both pets and livestock -- play in the
spread of viruses among humans and wildlife. Konstans Wells et al.
(2019), who leads the Biodiversity and Health Ecology research group at
Swansea University, is reported as saying: Bats are commonly recognised
as host of viruses that may eventually spillover into humans with
devastating health effects, but the role of other mammalian groups and
especially domestic species for the spread of virus are much less clear.
Many of the current and future viral threads are linked to viruses that
circulate in different animal species, connecting humans and mammal
species into a huge network of who shares viruses with whom.
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/12/191219122521.htm Wells et
al. (2019) and colleagues have traced the [associations between 1,785
virus species and 725 mammalian host species]{.underline} to find that
there is ['strong evidence that beside humans, domestic animals comprise
the central links in networks of mammalian host-virus interactions,
because they]{.underline} [share viruses with]{.underline} many [other
species and provide the pathways for future virus spread]{.underline}.'
7 It has long be known that bats are a reservoir for viruses that
through [['**viral** **host** **switching'**]{.mark} become the basis
for the spread of new viruses]{.underline}. The evidence is quite
unequivocal; some examples follow. Calisher and his colleagues, for
instance, write The remarkable mammals known as 'bats' and 'flying
foxes' ... may be the most abundant, diverse, and geographically
dispersed vertebrates... Although a great deal is known about them,
detailed information is needed to explain the astonishing variations of
their anatomy, their lifestyles, their roles in ecosystems ecology, and
their importance as reservoir hosts of viruses of proven or potential
significance for human and veterinary health (Calisher et al., 2006, p.
531). So-called 'viral [host switching]{.underline}' [**and** the
**increased** rate of **emergence** **of** **epizootic** **diseases** is
a **major** **cause** **for** **alarm**]{.underline}. Parrish et al.
(2008, p. 466) conclude [While it is still not possible to identify
which among the thousands of viruses in wild or domestic animals will
emerge in humans or exactly where and when the next emerging zoonotic
viruses will originate, studies point to common pathways and suggest
preventive strategies.]{.underline} With better information about the
origins of new viruses, it may be possible to identify and control
potentially emergent viruses in their natural reservoirs. Narveen Jandu
(2020) argues ['Human activity is responsible for animal viruses
crossing over and causing pandemics']{.underline}: [Viruses that
circulate in other animals can enter a human population when a variety
of human activities allow for consistent]{.underline} and [regular
interaction with naturally occurring reservoirs.]{.underline} These
events involve repeated and routine interaction of humans with these
animal hosts. Some of these interactions take place through the
following human activities: [hunting, butchering]{.underline} and
farming (husbandry), as well as the [global trade of
animals]{.underline} and domestication of exotic animals as pets.
[[Population **growth**]{.mark}, global **[travel]{.mark}** and

The Ebola outbreaks in West Africa are a result of human interaction
with fruit bats either delivered directly or through animals hosts such
as horses and pigs. It is clear that exploitation of wildlife and its
huge multi-billion dollar market worldwide is leading to the loss of
tropical forests and other natural habitats, exposing wildlife directly
to humans with greater risks of viral spillovers. [The risk of virus
spillover from animals to humans has increased through wildlife
exploitation and domestication.]{.underline} 8 Wild animals and plants
are rapidly disappearing especially through climate warming and
consequent rampant and uncontrollable wild fires (Peters, 2020). Now is
the time to return to return to the story of the emergence of society to
question the domestication narrative and its environmental practices
that have been often devastating for the global ecosystem with the
[importation of micro-organisms and pathogens that accompanied
colonialism and the expansion of modern agriculture under neoliberal
capitalism, decimating native wildlife and indigenous peoples with
introduced species and imported pathogens that destroyed delicate
ecosystems in the 'new world']{.underline}. In historical terms it is
timely to revisit the politics of the domestication narrative and its
deleterious environmental effects from plantation agriculture to the
modern use of chemicals. [The [**emergence** **of** **new** **diseases**
**brings** **into** central **question**]{.mark} the [**mass**
**extinction**]{.mark}]{.underline} of species through factory-farming
and the [destruction of native ecosystems]{.underline} that become
[threats to global biodiversity]{.underline} and govern emerging
industrial human-animal-plant interactions of the last hundred and fifty
years, crowding out wild nature and redrawing the lines between human
settlement and the global ecosystem. 9 To understanding models of novel
disease emergence, philosophically, we need return to the domestication
narrative and it's place in human history 10,000 years ago in
Mesopotamia and to understand how human settlement, colonial expansion
and modern agro-capitalist systems progressively have permanently
disturbed the globally distributed ecosystems and accumulated genetic
resources comprising humans, animals, plants, pathogens, and the
environment. This complex cultural history needs to be re-examined in
the light of [[viral evolution and the emergence of new diseases that
signal that we are entering an era of pandemics]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Separations

Whether for hydrometallurgical recovery from primary or secondary
sources, once the REEs and other co-solubilized constituents are
extracted into the aqueous phase, the next tasks are separation of REEs
from non-REEs, and then further separation of individual REEs. The
latter can be especially difcult because of the chemical similarity of
the lanthanides.48 Early work on lanthanide separations focused on
selective crystallization and precipitation,49 but solvent extraction
(SX) is now the dominant commercial process for primary production of
REEs, and the only proven technology for processing large volumes of
REE-laden solutions.49, 50 [However, [hundreds]{.mark} [of individual
contactors]{.mark} (mixer-settlers) [may be required]{.mark} for
adequate [separations]{.mark},49 and consequently, high volumes of
chemicals and large environmental impacts are associated with
SX.]{.underline}51, 52 [[This has led to interest in the development of
alternatives.]{.mark} These new techniques may be useful for separations
of REEs from recycling feedstocks in particular, because of the
diferences in absolute and relative abundances and chemical speciation
of the rare earths, as well as of co-occurring metals, in recycling
feedstocks as compared to rare earth ores. In general, recycling
feedstocks should contain a more limited number of rare earths, compared
to the ores, because the original devices or products were manufactured
to contain only certain REEs.]{.underline} [This can signifcantly
simplify the separation requirements]{.underline}. Also, these
technologies can be applied on a smaller scale, which is more suitable
for recycling as compared to primary production. [One innovative
approach is the use of biosorption]{.underline}. The use of a column of
immobilized lanmodulin, a bacterial protein shown to have extremely high
afnity for lanthanides,53--55 was recently reported for efective
separation of light lanthanides (Nd and Pr) from the higher-value heavy
rare-earth dysprosium, in a simulated permanent magnet leachate.56 If
non-REEs are present in the infuent, they pass through the lanmodulin
column, while the REEs are retained by selective binding to the
lanmodulin (Figure 3). Then because the lanmodulin has higher afnity for
light REEs (LREEs) than for heavy REEs (HREEs), the LREEs can be
separated from HREEs by sequential stripping at diferent pH or citrate
concentrations.56 The deployment of a natural protein for separation
rather than synthetic organic ligands and organic solvents is appealing
because the protein is inherently biodegradable, but the economic
competitiveness of this approach will hinge in part on the stability of
lanmodulin during prolonged use under realistic industrial conditions.
Studies of the robustness of the protein are ongoing, as are preliminary
techno-economic analyses. Another separation technology that takes
advantage of simpler permanent magnet leachate compositions as compared
with REE ore leachates is the recently reported CSEREOX ("chemical
separation of rare-earth element oxalates") method. In this approach,
light and heavy rare earths can be separated due to their diferent
solubilities when reacted with oxalate and an organic base. The LREEs
are much less soluble and can be precipitated out frst.57 The method is
simple and operates at neutral pH and is expected to be more
environmentally friendly and less costly compared to other
state-of-the-art separation approaches that require organic solvents and
or mineral acids.57 Formal TEA and LCA are in progress. A third example
of a new approach for REE separation is membrane solvent extraction
(MSX), which operates on the same principles as conventional SX, but the
organic solvent and extractant are immobilized within the pores of a
hollow fber flter module. The aqueous feed solution and strip solution
flow through the lumen and outside of the fibers, respectively.58 The
extraction and stripping (back-extraction) occur simultaneously, without
equilibrium limitations, and the process can operate continuously at
ambient conditions and low pressure. Recoveries of \>95% and purities
\>99.5 wt% for Dy, Pr, and Nd were derived from magnets obtained from
cell phones, hard disk drives, MRI scrap, magnet swarf, and vehicles.59
As this process has already been licensed, TEA and LCA analyses
performed to date are proprietary, but the low chemical usage and energy
requirements, modular design that facilitates scale-up, and low
operating costs are advantages compared to traditional SX.

REE content than many other unconventional sources (such as coal

environmentally responsible. Innovative chemical separations paired with
targeted waste streams may provide a signifcant source of high-value
REEs to enable a more circular economy. These processes must be robust
and able to respond rapidly to changes in recycling feedstock streams as

All of this explains why researchers are looking to recycle these
metals. [[Recycling is "going to play a very important and central
role]{.mark}," says Ikenna Nlebedim.]{.underline} He's a materials
scientist at the Department of Energy's Critical Materials Institute.
(It's run by Ames National Laboratory in Iowa.)

[Within 10 years, Nlebedim says, [recycling could meet up to one fourth
of the need for rare earths.]{.mark}]{.underline} If true, he says, that
would be "huge."

Most electronics, including smartphones, contain magnets. So do many
appliances and machines. Most of these magnets depend on rare earths for
their power. But once a product reaches the end of its life, retrieving
those rare earths for new use can be challenging. New research is
working to change that.

[[In the United States and Europe, it's standard to recycle from 15 to
70 percent of high-use metals,]{.underline}]{.mark} such as steel. Yet
today, only about 1 percent of the rare earths in old products get
recycled, notes Simon Jowitt. A geologist, he works at the University of
Nevada, Las Vegas.

"Copper wiring can be recycled into more copper wiring. Steel can just
be recycled into more steel," he says. But a lot of rare-earth products
are "not very recyclable."

Why? Often they have been blended with other metals. Separating them out
again can be very hard. In some ways, recycling rare earths from
tossed-out items is about as challenging as extracting them from ore and
processing them.

Rare-earth recycling tends to use hazardous chemicals, such as
hydrochloric acid. It also uses a lot of heat --- and thus a lot of
energy. And that effort may only recover a tiny amount of metal. A
computer's hard-disk drive, for instance, might contain just a few grams
(less than an ounce) of rare-earth metals. Some products might have just
a thousandth as much.

[But [scientists are trying to develop better recycling approaches to
reduce the need for mining more of these metals.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Particularly, [sustainable recycling]{.underline} and [circular economy]{.underline} solves AND deep-sea mining is based on [false narratives.]{.underline}

There are fierce divides among scholars, states, and practitioners about
the path forward, ranging from vocal support2 to growing concern,
especially over the ecological damage that would be caused by deep-sea
mining3. We join others calling to reverse course on deep-sea mining,
though for a different reason: [[d]{.mark}eep-[s]{.mark}ea
[m]{.mark}ining [is a **multi-billion**-dollar solution to problems that
**do not exist.**]{.mark}]{.underline} At best, these "problems" reflect
a misunderstanding of global mineral supply chains that vastly
overstates the scarcity of metals and minerals. At worst, they have been
manufactured by pro-extraction interests as a way to commodify a global
commons that has been legally recognized as "the common heritage of
\[hu\]mankind"4.

Our political economy analysis illustrates that [arguments in
**support** of [d]{.mark}eep-[s]{.mark}ea [m]{.mark}ining in the
international seabed [are based on]{.mark} [**false claims** and]{.mark}
**false [hopes.]{.mark}**]{.underline} They hinge on
[**misrepresentations** of the current state of the mining industry and
mineral supply chains.]{.underline} Government [[investments]{.mark} in
deep-sea mining [are an **expensive distraction** from
effective]{.mark}, long-term policy [planning to address **climate
change**,]{.mark} and to promote [**metals recycling** and]{.mark}
**ecologically** oriented [**circular economy** initiatives]{.mark} to
reduce the demand for deep seabed resources.]{.underline}

We show that three arguments often made by proponents of deep-sea mining
are unsubstantiated. [First, contrary to scarcity arguments, [we]{.mark}
already [have sufficient]{.mark} terrestrial [deposits]{.mark} of the
metals and minerals required [for **energy transitions**]{.mark}. We do
not "need" to augment supplies through deep-sea mining.]{.underline}
Second, proponents argue that deep-sea mining will avoid the negative
social effects of terrestrial mining, as it would not displace
communities and would create safer working conditions. [We maintain that
this logic only holds if [deep-sea mining]{.mark} replaces terrestrial
mining, which [is **neither** **economically nor politically
plausible.**]{.mark}]{.underline} And third, we rebut the economic claim
that deep-sea mining will financially benefit local economies and
countries of the global South; to date, [the record indicates that
deep-sea mining [is a **risky** and **unprofitable
investment**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Without these arguments, there is
little justification to mine the international seabed, [but strong
reasons to recommit to better governance of supply chains across mineral
lifecycles]{.underline}5.

In experiments, those bacterial acids recover only about a quarter to
half of the rare earths from catalysts and phosphors. That's not as good
as hydrochloric acid, which in some cases can extract up to 99 percent.
[But [the bio-based approach might still be worth the effort]{.mark},

[Other [bacteria can also help extract rare earths]{.mark}. A few years

can grab onto rare earths. This protein can separate rare earths from
each other]{.underline} --- such as neodymium from the dysprosium used
in many magnets. [[Such a system might avoid the need for many toxic
solvents]{.mark}. And the waste left from this process will

One experimental recycling approach uses organic acids to extract rare
earths from waste products. Bacteria make those acids. This reactor at
the Idaho National Laboratory is preparing an organic acid mixture for
such recycling.

[[Another new technique uses]{.mark} copper [salts]{.mark} --- [not
acids]{.mark} --- to pull rare earths from discarded
magnets.]{.underline} Neodymium-iron-boron (NIB) magnets are the single
biggest user of rare earths. Rare earths make up almost one-third of
these magnets by weight. Within seven years, recycling the neodymium
from NIB magnets in U.S. hard-disk drives could meet about 5 percent of
the world's demand for this metal (outside of China).

Nlebedim led a team that developed a technique that uses copper salts to
leach rare earths from magnets in shredded electronics. The process has
also been used on leftovers from the making of magnets. There, it could
recover 90 to 98 percent of the rare earths. The extracted metals are
pure enough to make new magnets, Nlebedim's team has shown. Their
process could also be better for the climate. Compared with one of the
main ways rare earths are mined and processed in China, the copper-salt
method has less than half its carbon footprint.

An Iowa company called TdVib has just built a pilot plant to use this
copper-salt process. It aims to produce two tons of rare-earth oxides
per month. It will recycle rare earths from old hard disk drives from
data centers.

[Noveon Magnetics is a company in San Marcos, Texas. It's already making
recycled [NIB magnets]{.mark}]{.underline}**.** After demagnetizing and
cleaning discarded magnets, it mills the metal into a powder. That
powder is used to make new magnets. Here, there's no need to first
extract and separate the rare earths. The final product can be more than
99 percent recycled magnet.

[Compared with the usual way of making NIB magnets, this method
[cuts]{.mark} [energy use by about 90 percent]{.mark},]{.underline}
researchers reported in a 2016 paper. [[Noveon also estimates that it
only releases about half as much carbon dioxide]{.mark}, a greenhouse
gas.]{.underline}

#### Recycling solves without BioD trade-offs

https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lars-Kristian-Trellevik/publication/373256121_THE_MANY_CHALLENGES_OF_DEEP-SEA_MINING/links/64e36b610acf2e2b52094683/THE-MANY-CHALLENGES-OF-DEEP-SEA-MINING.pdf

[The final sector in the model is mining]{.underline}. This sector has
already been discussed, as it is embedded in all other sectors. However,
it is worth highlighting that the model encapsulates both existing mine
sites, emerging mine sites, and recycling. This article is focused on
the challenges of deep-sea mining, and it contrasts seep-sea mining with
existing mining practices. The model does not explicitly focus on
deep-sea mining but instead on existing and alternative mining, one
option of which may be deep-sea mining. This is a helpful abstraction as
the model then enables consideration of both artisanal mining for cobalt
in western Africa and industrial mining at different locations where
social conditions may be executed under different regulatory standards.
However, it does not limit the model to contrast between existing and
deep-sea mining. One may also use this model to consider onshore mining
at alternative mine sites[[. The model furthermore includes the
recycling of existing minerals. This is an essential technological
sector that may become very important. Although recycling rates for most
minerals and metals are relatively low -- this is a sector expected to
grow significantly to meet the future demand for minerals]{.mark} (He et
al., 2020; Henckens, 2021; International Energy Agency (IEA), 2021), as
suggested by the model, **[the emergency of recycling at a large scale
will affect the entire system -- and it will have the same effects as
the emergence of alternative mining, but likely without the effect of
increased biodiversity loss due to mining]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Although this point is self-evident, it merits mention as it is a
critical policy design insight. Whether recycling can be a viable
alternative to the emergence of new mineral sources will depend on the
rate recycling can be developed and scaled up to meet demand, as well as
the available material in the system for recycling -- and the urgency
dictated by global warming and geopolitical strategic considerations.
Most likely, these considerations are subject to considerable
uncertainty

### REE- AFF- AT Solvency\-\--2AC

Highlights

[Current multi-metal [recycling]{.mark} [processes]{.mark}
systematically [fail to recover]{.mark} rare earth elements
([REEs]{.mark}) [due to structural limitations]{.mark} in processing
technology.]{.underline}

Electronic waste smelting furnaces destroy tiny but critical REE magnets
from devices like smartphones, with no effective way to extract them.

A technological revolution in robotic e-waste sorting and preprocessing
is crucial to enable effective and sustainable recycling of rare earth
elements.

[[Despite the]{.mark} circular economy [hype]{.mark}, modern multi-metal
[recycling]{.mark} [processes]{.mark} [are]{.mark} systematically
[failing]{.mark} to recover rare earth elements (REEs)---and that's no
accident]{.underline}. [According to Professor Koen Binnemans(opens in a
new tab), head of the SOLVOMET Group and a leading metallurgy expert at
KU Leuven, [the problem isn't just technological]{.mark}---[it's
structural]{.mark}]{.underline}

"Today's pyrometallurgical recycling systems, like those used by Umicore
or Aurubis Beerse, are optimized for gold, silver, copper, and tin---not
neodymium or dysprosium," Binnemans explains. These systems incinerate
electronic waste in smelting furnaces, capturing precious metals in
molten copper and disposing of the rest in slag or flue dust.
[Unfortunately, [REEs]{.mark}, which [have a high affinity for
oxygen]{.mark}, [are lost in the process]{.mark}, [resulting in
concentrations in the slag that are too low for economic
recovery.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The irony? Our smartphones and laptops are filled with tiny yet critical
REE-based magnets, often weighing just 0.5 to 5 grams. The global
stockpile is massive, but unless we dismantle devices before they hit
the furnace, those rare earths are gone forever.

That's the real bottleneck: preprocessing\*\*.\*\* [[Modern smelters
cannot compensate for the absence of dedicated dismantling
systems.]{.mark} Manual removal of magnets is labor-intensive and
unrealistic. What's needed is a revolution in electronic waste
sorting---robotic systems, guided by advanced sensors and AI, that can
isolate REE magnets before incineration.]{.underline}

[Until industry and policymakers prioritize this preprocessing
challenge, [rare earth recycling will remain a
myth]{.mark}.]{.underline} Pyrometallurgy is a dead end for rare earth
elements (REEs). Without profound structural change---including design
for disassembly and investment in smart dismantling infrastructure---the
promise of urban mining will continue to overlook the most critical
materials of the 21st century.

### REE- AFF- No Net Benefit\-\--2AC

#### REE recycling is dangerous to the environment.

Minnesota, "Worker Safety in the Rare Earth Elements Recycling Process
From the Review of Toxicity and Issues", OSHRI,

[Although [the]{.mark} rare earth elements ([REEs]{.mark}) [recycling
industry is expected to increase worldwide]{.mark} in hightech industry,
regulations for worker safety have yet to be established.]{.underline}
This study was conducted to understand the potential hazard/risk of REE
recycling and to support the establishment of regulations or standards.
We review the extensive literature on the toxicology, occupational
safety, and health issues, and epidemiological surveys related to the
REEs, and propose suitable management measures. REE recycling has four
key steps such as collection, dismantling, separation, and processing[.
In these processes, hazardous substances, such as [REEs-containing
dust]{.mark}, [metals, and chemical]{.mark}s, were used or occurred,
[includ]{.mark}ing [the risk of]{.mark} [ignition]{.mark} [and
explosion]{.mark}, and the workers can be easily exposed to them. [In
addition]{.mark}, skin irritation and [toxicities]{.mark} for
respiratory, nervous, and cardiovascular systems with the liver toxicity
were reported;]{.underline} however, more supplementary data are needed,
owing to incompleteness. [Therefore, monitoring systems concerning
health, environmental impacts, and safety need to be established, based
on additional research studies.]{.underline} It is also necessary to
develop innovative and environment-friendly recycling technologies,
analytical methods, and biomarkers with government support. Through
these efforts, the occupational safety and health status will be
improved, along with the establishment of advanced REE recycling
industry.

The term "rare earth elements" (REEs) means that they are rarely found
in nature. Strictly speaking, this is incorrect because the term "rare
earth" derives from the minerals from which they were first isolated,
which were uncommon oxides found in gadolinite extracted from a mine in
the village of Ytterby, Sweden. Actually, excluding promethium, rare
earth elements are diffusely found in the earth's crust. Because the
REEs are generally chemically stable and have excellent thermal
conductivity, high ductility, and corrosion resistance, they are widely
used as a core material in electric and hybrid vehicles, wind turbines,
solar power, optical fibers, phosphors, displays, catalysts, medical
industries, and structural alloy steel, and their usage and price are
increasing. Recently, REEs have been recognized as an essential resource
for the transition to high-tech industries and are attracting worldwide
attention as the vitamins of modern technology \[1\].

Although the ore reserves of REEs are not too small, like monazite and
bastnasite, their mines are limited to specific counties. [[In addition,
they are mainly produced in China]{.mark}, [owing]{.mark} [to
bioaccumulation]{.mark}, human [toxicity, and environmental
pollution]{.mark} caused by dust, metal, radioactive material, organics,
and wastewater [generated]{.mark} [during]{.mark} mining,
[purification]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} [separation]{.mark} \[2,3\]. Other
productive countries, such as Australia, the United States, and Russia,
have reduced their production scale before, owing to technical or
environmental reasons]{.underline}. Despite having a few reserves, there
is no production of REEs in Korea, considering their economic efficiency
\[4\]. China holds about 55 million tons of REEs that are the largest
reserves in the world (48.4%) and produced more than 80% of the world's
production of rare earth oxides (REOs) in 2016 (about 155,000 tons)
\[5\]. For that reason, REEs were regarded as critical raw materials in
the 2010 annual report of the European Union \[6\]. The US Department of
Energy defined dysprosium (Dy), neodymium (Nd), terbium (Tb), europium
(Eu), and Y as critical in the shortand mid-term, considering the supply
risk and their importance to clean energy technologies \[7\]. In Korea,
REEs were classified as some of 35 rare metals, and their depletion is
expected in the future with the development of the new growth engine of
Korean industry in the 21st century.

md

The Heritage Foundation, which was one of the most vocal groups in
fighting the initial accession to UNCLOS, argues that because the United
States has remained a non-signatory for so long, there is no reason to
change now, and the state's focus should primarily be on maintaining a
superior navy to support its own maritime bidding.23 However, this view
ignores the power of diplomacy; [as a nonmember of the treaty, the
United States has less influence over the ongoing ocean policy
discussions of today]{.underline}. [[Joining the convention]{.mark}
[would **increase U.S. influence** over the conversation now]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} thus [help]{.mark} to [**solidify U.S. maritime policy**
and **strengthen influence abroad**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Nearly 40 years ago, the Reagan administration and the U.S. Senate
backed away from UNCLOS for reasons that made little sense then and none
today. Since then, a number of presidents, including Bill Clinton,
George H. W. Bush, and Barack Obama, have unsuccessfully lobbied for the
Senate to ratify it. [[For the United]{.mark} [States]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [retake]{.mark} its [position as a global leader]{.mark},
and for the U.S. Navy to be seen as a legitimate extension of that
leadership, [it is time for the Senate to]{.mark} finally give its
advice and consent to [accede to]{.mark}
**[UNCLOS]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The Navy's surface combatants
effectively project American power abroad and enforce freedom of the
seas in routine freedom of navigation operations. This mission has
become especially significant in the wake of aggressive actions and
provoking claims at sea made by our adversaries abroad. However,
exerting military strength is not enough. The formal acceptance of
UNCLOS by the United States will diplomatically support national
interests abroad, secure American influence in the maritime domain, and
more proactively underpin the efforts of the U.S. surface navy.

#### Breaking ISA regulations splits the US and EU\-\--only a moratorium on deep sea mining prevents fragmented multilateral cooperation

**Albert '22**, \[Elizibeth Albert is a senior staff writer on the ocean
reporting team of the award-winning environmental science and
conservation news outlet Mongabay; 6/11/22; "'Madness': World leaders
call for deep-sea mining moratorium at UN ocean summit"

md

NICE, France --- At the 2025 U.N. Ocean Conference (UNOC), taking place
in Nice, France, between June 9 and 13, world leaders renewed their call
for a global moratorium on deep-sea mining, an emerging industry that
many experts say could seriously and irreversibly damage marine
ecosystems.

At the opening plenary, French President Emmanuel Macron denounced
deep-sea mining as "madness." He described the prospective industry as a
"predatory" activity that threatens to destroy the seabed and
potentially release stored carbon. France was among the first countries
to take a stand against deep-sea mining, calling for a ban in 2022.

U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres echoed Macron's concerns,
warning that [the [deep sea]{.mark} "[cannot become the Wild
West]{.mark}."]{.underline} He also voiced strong support for the
International Seabed Authority (ISA), the U.N.-affiliated body tasked
with both regulating deep-sea mining in international waters and with
protecting the seabed.

[Since 2022]{.underline}, 33 [countries]{.underline} have [called for a
precautionary pause,]{.underline} moratorium, [or ban on deep-sea
mining]{.underline}. That [number has since risen to 37]{.underline}
with the addition of Slovenia, Latvia, Cyprus and the Marshall Islands

"[[We cannot afford to miss the ocean's capacity to absorb our
carbon]{.underline}]{.mark}," President Hilde Heine of the Marshall
Islands told reporters in a press briefing on June 10. "[A [ban is the
safest choice for nature \[and\]]{.mark} [marine
life.]{.mark}"]{.underline}

At UNOC, several countries that have already endorsed a moratorium or
precautionary pause also reiterated their stance, including Brazil,
Costa Rica and Palau.

These expressions of support follow the release by the Trump
administration in the U.S. of an executive order on April 24, invoking
an existing U.S. law, the Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act
(DSHMRA), to assert unilateral authority to mine in international waters
--- an area technically beyond the jurisdiction of any one country. This
stance contrasts with the widely accepted international view that the
ISA is the sole body authorized to regulate deep-sea mining in
international waters

On March 27, prior to the release of the executive order,
Vancouver-based The Metals Company (TMC), which holds exploration
licenses via the ISA, revealed that it would no longer apply for
deep-sea mining licenses via the ISA. Instead, it would apply through
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S.
regulator of deep-sea mining in international waters via DSHMRA. On
April 29, the company announced that it had officially applied for a
commercial recovery permit.

The U.S. did not appear to have an official delegation at the opening
plenary session of the U.N. Ocean Conference on June 9. However, a U.S.
State Department representative told Mongabay via email that two members
of the "Presidential Environmental Advisory Task Force" were attending
the conference as government observers. In January, Ed Russo, a
businessman and Trump's long-time environmental adviser, announced that
he had formed this new task force to advise the president on
environmental decisions.

A spokesperson for the U.S. State Department, who declined to provide a
name, said UNOC's focus of implementing the U.N.'s Sustainable
Development Goal (SDG) 14 --- a goal devoted to conservation and
sustainable use of the oceans --- was at "odds with the U.S. position on
the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs." The
spokesperson added that the [[U.N. SDGs "advance a program of
soft]{.mark} [global governance]{.mark} that [is inconsistent with U.S.
sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline} and adverse to the rights and interests
of Americans" and that the U.S. "will no longer reaffirm them as a
matter of course," seeming to suggest that [the [U.S. would no longer be
engaging with the goals of the U.N]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"Critical minerals are essential to the U.S. economy and to the
technologies powering America's economic growth, prosperity, and
national security," the State Department spokesperson told Mongabay in
an email. "U.S. leadership in deep sea science, technology, and seabed
mineral development is essential to building secure critical mineral
supply chains."

The spokesperson also said that Trump's executive order would "establish
the United States as a global leader in responsible seabed mineral
exploration, technology, and practices, and as a partner for countries
developing seabed mineral resources in areas within their national
jurisdictions."

[President Surangel Whipps Jr. of Palau]{.underline}, who has been
publicly calling for a moratorium on deep-sea mining since 2022,
[told]{.underline} Mongabay in a press briefing [that]{.underline} the
[[U.S. should not be able to "unilaterally]{.mark} [decide" to mine the
deep sea]{.mark}]{.underline}, and that the [[rules of the **ISA should
be respected**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"This is the common heritage of humankind," he said in reference to
international waters, where TMC is looking to mine.

Megan Randles of Greenpeace International, who is attending UNOC, told
Mongabay in a written statement that "it is very clear that [many
[States are alarmed by]{.mark} the **[reckless actions of the
US]{.mark}** administration [and the deep sea mining industry to bypass
international law]{.mark}]{.underline}."

"The science is clear --- deep sea mining would cause irreversible harm
to the ocean," Randles added. "[A [**moratorium would protect the deep
sea** and **uphold multilateralism**]{.mark} and [ensures that decisions
that]{.mark}]{.underline} [[impact]{.underline}]{.mark} our [[shared
ocean]{.mark} [lies in the hands of all member states of the
**I**]{.mark}]{.underline}nternational **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**eabed
**[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**uthority, together, [[for the benefit of all
and future generations]{.underline}]{.mark}."

[[In a **brittle world**]{.mark} without enduring strong international
alliances]{.underline}, the debate on [Europe's 'strategic autonomy' has
gained **new resonance**, but it should not shadow the [EU's
**unique**]{.mark} **key international [assets]{.mark}** [in the]{.mark}
**global [economy]{.mark}** [and **multilateral order**]{.mark}. Working
with **global networks** to [**promote norms** and **public
goods**]{.mark} is [key to **push back on nationalism**]{.mark}, the
rise of **geopolitics** [and **transactionalism**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Strategic autonomy' and 'complementarity with NATO' usually appear in
the same sentence in the European debate -- the latest doctrinal
iteration to be found in the EU Global Strategy of June 2016. The
ensemble reflects Europe's need to rely on its transatlantic
relationship for security and territorial defence, empowering it to
carry out foreign policy too. The EU's greatest foreign policy
achievement of enlarging to Central Europe after the Cold War, pursued
in tandem with NATO expansion, is testimony to this pairing.

Since the end of 2016, the US President's international preferences
undermine directly or indirectly Europe's security. Whether it is the
insistence on greater burden-sharing, US action in the Middle East, or
trade disputes with China, current US policies put Europe's security --
already challenged by Russian action in Eastern Europe and the Middle
East -- at risk.

European leaders have started to question whether the transatlantic
relationship needs to be preserved no matter what, or whether Europe
should emancipate from it. [The debate on 'strategic
autonomy']{.underline} is animating recent efforts in the field of
security and defence. It [refers to the ability to make and carry out
decisions on **defence**, to conduct **[military operations]{.mark}**
autonomously, and to have the **industrial capabilities** to do so. Even
if]{.underline} this level of strategic autonomy were [agreed upon, it
would take a **generation** for Europe to affect the world
stage]{.underline}.

[The focus]{.underline} on strategic autonomy [[speaks]{.mark}
to]{.underline} present [insecurities in Europe]{.underline}an
societies, [but [not to]{.mark} the EU's **international
[legitimacy]{.mark}** [where]{.mark}]{.underline}, possibly, [the
**[E]{.mark}**]{.underline}uropean **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nion
[[has **better opportunities** to develop]{.mark} **means of political
[autonomy]{.mark}** which befit its **history** and **international
identity**]{.underline}. The emerging debate on economic sovereignty is
addressing for the first time the degree to which the EU can make
political use of some of its economic and financial tools, such as the
Euro as an international currency. After all, the EU and its Member
States remain the world's largest trade bloc and donor.

[On the multilateral stage, [Europe faces an **increasingly hostile
environment** but remains]{.mark} the **[best]{.mark} hope** [to
pursue]{.mark} **universal principles**, such as [**human rights**
and]{.mark} the [**rule of law**, which **underpin**]{.mark} **the
[resilience]{.mark}** of that **multilateral system**. How [to
**partner**]{.mark} **with other countries and actors** around the globe
[to **push back on attacks**]{.mark} **to international order**
[is]{.mark} no longer [a]{.mark} second order
[priority]{.mark}.]{.underline}

If the way ahead appears clear, achieving it is a tall order. The
rationale for collective action for the EU seems obvious -- the
'politics of scale', or to be stronger together rather than weaker apart
-- but historically difficult to achieve. [The multiple threats and
risks]{.underline} on Europe's doorsteps [have only minimally bridged
the strategic divergence that continues to beset the
continent]{.underline}, and the rise of the populist radical right is
beginning to undermine existing European external policies, not to speak
of a higher level of ambition.

Looking at global politics from a non-European perspective, how Europe's
friends and partners around the world will welcome a bid for greater
autonomy -- politically, economically, and strategically -- still needs
to be seen. The EU's worldview that it has acted as a 'force for good'
is not uncritically accepted. After all, that ethical stand was also
possible thanks to the EU's belonging to a stable and hegemonic West.

If Europe wants to engage with the world and simultaneously strengthen
its strategic identity it needs to square some circles. [[Without giving
into]{.mark} the [**facile critique** that]{.mark} realism and
[geopolitics render multilat]{.mark}eral principles [obsolete]{.mark}
and warrant hard-nosed politics, [Europe should **leverage**]{.mark}
**its [assets]{.mark}**, which are irrevocably embedded [in]{.mark}
multilateralism and **[coop]{.mark}eration**. **[Climate]{.mark}
change**, **[conflict]{.mark} prevention and [mediation]{.mark}**[,
and]{.mark} an **[open]{.mark} and fairer international [trade]{.mark}
system** [are among]{.mark} the [assets]{.mark} that the [EU can]{.mark}
concretely [work towards]{.mark} globally]{.underline}.

To do so it needs to engage flexibly with global actors, focusing more
on multilevel networks including civil society rather than on the
traditional partnerships between governments, some of which are no
longer benign or useful. Both will require a dose of humility in
listening to non-European world views and of pragmatism in seeking
appropriate strategies and paths forward.

Last but not least, if [[Europe]{.underline}]{.mark} wants to imagine
its own history of prosperity, democracy and peace as still relevant to
the debates taking place in the rest of the world, it also [[needs to
think abou]{.mark}t the **[global]{.mark} future
[sustainability]{.mark}** of welfare]{.underline}, taking progressive
politics outside national boundaries and [[engaging in]{.mark} a more
global]{.underline} and open [debate about public [common
goods]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### 2nc/1nr---at: moratorium bad 

#### A moratorium on deep sea mining is necessary

Pressure on the International Seabed Authority (ISA) to finalize and
adopt regulations for deep-sea mining is increasing. While some ISA
member states are hoping to see progress soon, [a growing number of
[states]{.mark} are [demand]{.mark}ing [more time to research]{.mark}
the [environmental impact of mining]{.mark} raw materials [on the
seabed]{.mark} and to develop an appropriate regulatory
framework]{.underline}. What are the legal forms such a delay could take
and what would the political consequences be?

[[Many of the]{.mark} [169]{.mark} [member]{.mark} state[s]{.mark} [of
the **ISA**]{.mark} have [spoke]{.mark}n [out]{.mark} [in favor of
a]{.mark} precautionary pause or **[moratorium]{.mark}** on deep-sea
mining.]{.underline} Many of them likely felt compelled to do so when
the island state of Nauru triggered a treaty provision known as the
\"two-year rule\" in 2021. The provision requires the International
Seabed Authority (ISA) to develop and adopt regulations for deep-sea
mining within a 2-year period.

However, the ISA was unable to agree on any regulations before the
passing of the deadline. Many states and observers are worried that an
application for exploitation could now be submitted for approval with no
regulations in place.

[A moratorium has more legal force, but a precautionary pause can
deliver the needed outcome]{.underline}

With many of the outstanding issues requiring further study and debate,
[a suitable legal measure is needed to delay any mining
activities]{.underline}. Environmental concerns are at the forefront of
calls for a moratorium or precautionary pause on deep-sea mining, but
[[there are]{.underline}]{.mark} other [\"[gaps]{.mark}\" [that must be

institutional and **[procedural]{.mark}
[ambiguities]{.mark}**]{.underline} and other issues related to global
governance more broadly.

According to the researchers, the legal basis for deferring deep-sea
mining is clearly present under international law, given that states
have many obligations and responsibilities that are yet to be fulfilled
before such activities can commence responsibly.

\"[There are]{.underline} more [convergences between the terms
\'precautionary pause\' and \'moratorium\']{.underline} than
differences. The [effect is more important than the label or
terminology]{.underline},\" says Singh. Both a [pause]{.underline} [or
[moratorium]{.mark}]{.underline} at the ISA [can effectively [have a
\"freezing effect]{.mark}]{.underline}\"---in accordance with the
precautionary approach---on the transition from exploration to
exploitation.

Postponement can have unintended consequences, but is still a sensible
pathway to take

The authors describe a [[moratorium]{.mark} [as]{.mark} a [formal and
binding]{.mark} stop]{.underline}. It [[carries]{.mark} considerable
[weight in]{.mark} **[i]{.mark}**nternational **[law]{.mark}** and
usually requires a formal agreement or resolution]{.underline}. In view
of the interests involved and the tendency of the ISA to operate based
on consensus, this could be difficult to achieve in the first instance.

A precautionary pause in some ways could be seen as a weaker measure in
legal terms, as it can result from informal agreements and feature
softer parameters. For pragmatic reasons, however, the ISA might prefer
it, as it might face less resistance, and it preserves the intention to
continue the development of the necessary frameworks and define the
acceptable parameters with the intention of applying them in future.

The [moratorium]{.underline} option [would]{.underline} then [be ripe
for consideration further down the line if it becomes apparent that a
fit-for-purpose regulatory framework for the responsible governance of
extraction activities is not achievable.]{.underline}

The paper notes that there is already a clear pattern from the position
of the ISA Council and many states that [[commercial mining **should not
commence** in the absence of regulations]{.underline}]{.mark}, and that
[more]{.underline} time and [[knowledge is needed]{.mark} [to
develop]{.mark}]{.underline} a [strong, [enforceable]{.mark}, and
[robust]{.mark} [framework]{.mark}]{.underline} that is fit for purpose.

However, a decision to postpone activities at the ISA could also have
unintended consequences, the authors concede. This includes possible
geopolitical tensions or turning the attention towards seabed mining in
areas within national jurisdiction. Nevertheless, the paper concludes
that [the [benefit of]{.mark} implementing a [pause]{.mark} would
[outweigh]{.mark} any [decision to go ahead with commercial
exploitation]{.mark} on the international seabed.]{.underline}

#### Military modernization is key to win the tech race against China

While sound investment calls for a long view, short-term timing is
critical. [A [wave of new tech]{.mark}nologies of enormous military
potency]{.underline} -- artificial intelligence
([[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}), [[quantum]{.underline}]{.mark} computing,
chip and battery design, revolutionary [[space
networks]{.underline}]{.mark} -- [[is cresting]{.underline}]{.mark}.
These technologies can improve Chinese targeting of US forces. AI can
operate uncrewed aircraft and ships, multiply the quality of
intelligence and foster flexible decision-making. Quantum computing can
accelerate data processing and improve cyber security. Better, smaller
chips and batteries can revolutionise microelectronic and energy
performance. And a large network of satellites is a force multiplier in
all battlefield domains and across vast geographical areas. [[The
Chinese]{.underline} [now]{.underline}]{.mark} [[have extended-range
surveillance]{.mark} systems that can track US ships and observe US
bases throughout the Western Pacific. [They also possess]{.mark}
[ballistic]{.mark}, [cruise]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [hypersonic
missiles]{.mark} [with]{.mark} sufficient [accuracy]{.mark} and range
[to]{.mark} exploit such surveillance and [strike exposed US
forces]{.mark} across the region]{.underline}. Facing these threats, the
US military is already developing and deploying less vulnerable forces
by way of dispersed strike platforms with longer-range weapons,
submarines, uncrewed platforms and space-based command and control.
[But]{.underline} [[America's military R&D is]{.mark} still [in lower
gear than China's]{.mark}.]{.underline} Simply put, [[although the
United States outspends China in military
investment]{.underline}]{.mark}, including R&D, China's state-centered
system enables it to transform funding and talent into deployed
capabilities faster than the United States' private-enterprise-centered
system. While the central state has principal responsibility in China
for generating new technology, private enterprise is the locomotive of
American invention. Aggregate US spending on R&D comes to 2.5% of its
\$25trneconomy, whereas China's is 2% of an \$18trn economy.8 However,
[[Beijing is able to shovel money]{.mark} and talent [directly into
the]{.mark} [P]{.mark}eople's [L]{.mark}iberation [A]{.mark}rmy for
quick results]{.underline}, while [[it takes years for the US]{.mark}
government [to marshal private investment]{.mark} for the benefit of US
national defence]{.underline}. For instance, it took the better part of
the 1980s for data networking to migrate from public to US military
capabilities. [[To compete]{.mark} [with China in military
tech]{.mark}nology, [the US government could increase defence
spending]{.mark} to levels that meet both present operational needs and
sustained investment increases]{.underline} -- say, [by
\$50bn]{.underline}. But this could imply a Pentagon budget of over
\$1trn, [[which would dwarf that of China]{.underline}]{.mark}, Russia
and all other US adversaries combined, and could swell the
\$1.5trnfederal-budget deficit and interest obligations. We know from
Cold War America's R&D is in lower gear than China's Winning the
US--China Technology Race experience that such profligate American
military spending can produce severe inflation. From this perspective,
[[money freed from increased allied support for current operations would
best be used to stimulate private-sector
innovation]{.mark}.]{.underline} For purposes of illustration[, it is
not unreasonable that]{.underline}, say, [\$25bn a year be spared from
current US operational demands]{.underline} and earmarked [for the race
in military technology]{.underline}. But, unlike the Chinese state, the
US government cannot simply plow massive additional funds directly into
military R&D. While scientific innovation is rising in the US high-tech
industry, the Defense Department and other government agencies could
make their markets more inviting. Even though Pentagon business reform
has become more focused, it still takes roughly five years for promising
private-sector innovations to translate into actual military
capabilities. One of the most serious impediments to private firms
seeking to develop military capabilities is the lag between fruitful R&D
and steady revenue streams from production. Such firms must absorb the
full costs of management, marketing and technical staff for several
years. For start-ups, which are often the source of innovation, those
costs are prohibitive, and it is unrealistic to expect venture
capitalists to bear them without the prospect of timely earnings. The
effect of this disincentive is at best delay in exploiting innovative
technology for military applications, at worst outright discouragement
of private innovation for defence applications. The Pentagon's so-called
'valley of death' -- shades of Monty Python -- is where many start-ups
go to die. The Defense Department could mitigate this problem by
investing funds to defray costs before production can begin and steady
revenue can flow. Ideally, investment from the prospective military
client and from the Pentagon itself would attract private capital at
this critical stage. Of course, [[the US military]{.mark} cannot supply
funds willy[-]{.mark}nilly to whatever private start-up [needs]{.mark}
them.]{.underline} Of critical importance, then, is [[a mechanism to
screen]{.mark} [applicants for]{.mark} their [potential]{.mark} to
deliver important military capabilities and become
self-sustaining]{.underline}. The [[US Air Force has established such an
option]{.underline}]{.mark} for small businesses. [Start-ups whose labs
have demonstrated promising innovations can apply for service-client and
departmental funding to match external capital]{.underline}. The
prospect of matching government funding encourages private entities to
invest. While individual cases may be small, the total can reach
billions of dollars. All military services and defence intelligence
agencies should offer such a facility. In effect, the Pentagon would
become an investor, drawing and matching private capital, before it
becomes a regular buyer. Done properly, the \$25bn or so liberated from
operations could be put to strategic use to stimulate and accelerate the
transfer of private-sector technology for military advantage, especially
for competition with China.\* \* \*[[It is possible for the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [to take a firm lead in the race with
China for superior military]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}
[[by]{.mark} [calling]{.mark} [on]{.mark} allies and [private innovators
to facilitate]{.mark} selective but [substantial]{.mark}
[investment]{.mark} [in critical defence
technologies]{.mark}]{.underline}. Private entrepreneurs would no longer
be discouraged from pursuing business with the armed services, and the
time from laboratory to battlefield could be greatly shortened. To this
end, Washington needs to rally the imagination, the determination, the
trust and the confidence of allies and entrepreneurs

that today\'s security environment is unprecedented, with multiple new

responsible nuclear powers, often working with regional actors to the
detriment of a stable international system. For instance, he said,
[[China\'s military buildup]{.mark} is [ramping

[Chinese President Xi Jinping\'s directive is that China be prepared to

matters]{.mark},]{.underline} he said. America has relied on its
industry\'s ingenuity throughout its history. However, following the
Cold War, there was no perceived near-peer competitor, so the U.S. took
advantage of the peace dividend, scaling back the military industrial
base and deferring nuclear modernization. \"But that peace dividend did
not materialize ... [[great power competition is

said. Maintaining a sustained and credible nuclear deterrent isn\'t that
expensive, considering the alternatives, Cotton said. Current funding
for the Defense Department\'s nuclear portfolio is only around 4% of the
budget. The general said conventional capabilities complement nuclear
deterrence. For instance, [hypersonics provide a responsive, long-range,
non-nuclear strike capability against non-critical threats without
resorting to nuclear options.]{.underline} They allow mission planners
to tailor strategies and plans that will enable the president [to have

#### Artic is key to Russian national prestige and sees foreign containment as a direct challenge to their status

One of Russia's most influential international relations thinkers in
recent decades, Yevgeniy Primakov, anticipated the importance of the
seabed to twenty-first century Russia. More specifically, the former
**[[Russia]{.mark}n Federation]{.underline}** foreign minister
**[[recognized the]{.mark} significance the [Arctic]{.mark} seabed would
have [for]{.mark} his country's [influence in the
world]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- and that it would take a lot of work,
investment, and innovation to extract its [resources: "So, the necessary
growth in production for the country will become possible only through
the exploitation of new deposits in the hard-to-access regions of
Eastern Siberia, on the continental shelf of the northern
seas]{.underline}\.... This will require massive funds, to conduct
exploration, set up infrastructure, protect the environment, for roads
and for expensive new technologies, especially for the continental
shelf" (Primakov 20161). **[[For Putin]{.mark} and his regime, [the
Arctic]{.mark} Ocean [seabed,]{.mark} and particularly Russia's
continental shelf, [is]{.mark} one of [the main frontier]{.mark}s [for
expanding Russia's]{.mark} "strategic resource base]{.underline}**."
**[Russia is doubling down on natural resources as the [foundation of
its power]{.mark}]{.underline}**. To remain a natural resource
superpower, its leadership feels it must expand Russia's ability to
exploit resources found across "the territories of the Russian
Federation and its continental shelf," a statement that recurs in the
country's strategic documents (Russian Federation 2024a). And by doing
so, the Kremlin will deepen the Russian state presence in the north.
**[[Russia's]{.mark} [goal]{.mark} of expanding its resource base also
[extends to international wate]{.mark}rs, beyond the margins of the
continental shelf]{.underline}**. What the Maritime Doctrine calls the
"World Ocean" (Мировой океан) is another area where Russia seeks to
expand its resource reach (Russian Federation 2022b). **[[One
way]{.mark} for Russia to do [that is to assert]{.mark} that [it has a
sovereign right]{.mark} to do so under [i]{.mark}nternational
l[aw]{.mark}, for instance [by conducting research on]{.mark} the
possibilities of mining [the sea f loo]{.mark}r in international waters.
The "[further expansion" of the]{.mark} natural resources base in the
oceans aims to identify new opportunities for hydrocarbon drilling and
sea floor mining, to create a "[strategic reserve]{.mark}" of
deposits]{.underline}**. The Maritime Activities Strategy (the official
title of which is "Strategy for the Development of Maritime Activities
of the Russian Federation") explicitly connects such activities with the
expansion of Russia's mineral resource base (Russian Federation 2019;
2020b). In Russia's view, the "World Ocean" will replenish its depleting
terrestrial deposits**[. As one document puts it, the continental shelf
is the "predetermined" location where Russia will reorient its economy
for the future]{.underline}** (Russian Federation 2022b). In general,
accessing difficult-to-extract deposits, in particular hydrocarbons, is
an overriding aim of Russia's natural resource development strategy.
Mostly, this expanded resource base is to furnish Russia with oil, gas,
and minerals it can then sell abroad. T he Arctic Ocean is where, in
part, expanding the resource base is going to take place. The 2020
Russian Arctic strategy, amended in 2023, describes the "Arctic Zone" as
a key to the country's "strategic resource base," one that through
sustainable use will accelerate Russia's economic growth (Russian
Federation 2020a). Its Transportation Strategy (Russian Federation
2021b) speaks of the Arctic as "one of the most important territories"
of the Russian Federation. **[As will be explored in the next section,
the Arctic is also, importantly, a zone where Russia [assesses that
foreign powers are trying to constrain its economic development]{.mark}
(Russian Federation 2021a)]{.underline}**

#### [Reject]{.underline} mining industry epistemology\-\--mining company sources ignore Indigenous [cognitive frameworks]{.underline} and erase the deep sea's [cultural and spiritual significance.]{.underline}

Ecology and Geography at Lund University. (Nicholas, X-XX-2023, "Talk to
the Sea: Deep-Sea Mining, the Arts, and Contesting Narratives of

Through my interviews with researchers and critics of the ISA and
deep-sea mining, I found strong arguments against each of these 4
narratives. My respondents demonstrated, with ample evidence supported
by the natural science and critical literature, that the deep-sea was in
fact a biodiverse, complex, and cultural space with long recognized
significance to Indigenous groups. Claims made by mining companies were
deeply suspect and **[easily dismissed]{.underline}** by work from
multiple disciplines in the scientific and academic community.

Rights of nature The legal concept of the rights of nature recognizes
the right for nature to exist and to maintain its own natural cycles,
rather than to simply be conceived as a resource to be exploited, as
under most legal codes. The rights of nature is not something radically
new, but closely aligned with longstanding principles in "Indigenous
philosophy and governance systems that emphasizes the interconnectedness
of humans and nature and treat nature as a partner and a relative,
rather than as a property and as a resource" (Harden-Davies et al.,
2020, 3). A rights of nature approach to the management of the deep
ocean and the ABJN would almost certainly either outright deny or highly
constrain deep-sea mining activities

[[**Indigenous**]{.mark} **perspectives** of the seabed Indigenous
perspectives [on]{.mark} the seabed and [deep-sea mining have been
**consistently ignored**]{.mark} and **marginalized** [by the mainstream
**governmental**, **scientific** and corporate
**narratives**.]{.mark}]{.underline} For Pacific islander communities,
the ocean holds deep cultural and spiritual significance, and "DSM is
not distanced from the island environment because the ocean is at the
heart of one's identity, and part of each individual's future." (V.
Tilot et al., 2021, 4). Thus far there has been no inclusion of
Indigenous knowledge in the ISA's draft mining code (Reichelt‐Brushett
et al., 2022, 668). Some scholars have advocated for the inclusion of
the legal concept of Oceania Sovereignty to the deep-sea mining field.
The concept originated from Tongan-Fijian scholar Epeli Hau'ofa "linking
the right to make decisions on land and ocean spaces to cultural
stewardship/guardianship developed in, and unique to, the Pacific
Islands" (Tilot et al., 2021, 2). Communities in the Duke of York
Islands in Papua New Guinea consider [the deep-seabed to be inhabited by
spirits called Masali, and thus [extraction would entail
**spiritual**]{.mark} **turmoil**]{.underline} [(]{.mark}Katona et al.,
2023). [[The **lack of inclusion** of Indigenous]{.mark} perspectives of
the seabed and inclusion in the governance regime of deep-sea mining
[demonstrates the **current bias** towards]{.mark} a regime of r[esource
extraction]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Deep-sea mining threatens **Indigenous heritage** and
**communities**]{.mark} Deep-sea mining would represent a multi-pronged
assault on the cultural and economic practices]{.underline} of Pacific
Islander groups. [Local [Indigenous communities,]{.mark} due to their
**proximity** and [**deep** **connection** to the regions allocated for
deep-sea mining, are]{.mark} also [likely to "**shoulder** the major
burden of **deep-sea mining activities."**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Environmental Justice Foundation, 2023, 38). [[Deep-sea
mining]{.mark}'s potential devastating impact on fish stocks due to
pollution and disturbance, [would impact a **vital food source,**
**economic activity**, and **associated cultural activity** for
Indigenous]{.mark}]{.underline} Pacific Islander peoples (ibid). As a
result, at the most recent meeting of the ISA, representatives of 34
nations and 56 Indigenous groups delivered a petition with 1000
signatories calling for a total ban on deep-sea mining (Greenpeace,
2023). In the example of one of the early deep-sea mining sites,
Solawara 1, mining activities threatened an ancient traditional practice
of "shark calling" due to the noise created by mining activities (Fainu,
2021). [A local clan leader explained bluntly "When they start mining
the seabed, they'll start mining a part of me."]{.underline} (Childs,
2019). [[These]{.mark} examples [highlight the **social impacts** of
deep-sea mining]{.mark}. The disproportionate impact of deep-sea mining
on Indigenous communities reveals that the question of mining the
deep-sea is also one of environmental justice.]{.underline}

The narrative of the deep-sea as a resource is facilitated by its
supposed lack of connection to human communities. According to this
narrative, the deep-sea is remote, distant, alien, and disconnected from
human societies. [The implied lack of social impacts of deep-sea mining
of course ignores the direct protest of Indigenous groups calling to ban
the practice]{.underline} (Greenpeace, 2023), who have been
systematically left out of negotiations at The International Seabed
Authority. [The process of [defining the deep-sea as a **resource**
is]{.mark} thus also [a process of **erasure** of **non-western
perspectives** on the **seabed**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Marine mining has so far not been executed at an industrial or
commercial scale -- yet a number of experimental and pilot mining
activities have been launched (Hyman et al., 2022; Sharma, 2017; Toro et
al., 2020). What is evident from experience in marine mining concepts so
far is that the [[mining tech]{.mark}nology that will be required
[is]{.mark} rather [**costly** and]{.mark} exposed to significant
**[strain]{.mark}** from [the **environment**.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Marine mineral deposits are located in deep water -- and as such they
are typically located far out at sea. Deep waters far out at sea also
infers high water pressure, equipment intensive and abrasive as well as
tedious operations and tedious logistics bringing ore to surface and to
land for further processing and distribution. Nodules are distributed
across large geographic regions, crusts are very hard entities located
typically on steep subsea mountains(Hein et al., 2013; Lusty & Murton,
2018; Sharma, 2017). [To extract these types of ore [requires]{.mark}
heavy and **[advanced]{.mark}** robotic [machinery.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[By extracting ore from the seabed -- there will be damaging
consequences to any habitat or biosphere in that, and possibly in
adjacent locations]{.underline} (Niner et al., 2018; Van Dover et al.,
2017). Onshore mining is certainly wreaking havoc on local environments
-- as for example in Indonesia where Nickel mining is causing great
damage to biodiversity hot-spots (Hyman et al., 2022). There is little
reason to assume that deep sea mining will not cause damage. However, as
the technology is not yet established -- and as the ecological baseline
of these habitats is poorly explored and understood, [[the exact impact
of deep-sea mining is]{.mark} not only uncertain, but unknown, possibly
also [**unknowable**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

As is stated on its cover, in "Hubris and Progress -- A Future Born of
Presumption", Bordoni explores the ancient question of why man seeks to
go beyond his limits (2019). Bordoni tracks the concept of Hubris back
to the ancient greeks and discusses how it as a concept has incorporated
varying applications of the arrogance of man to go beyond his limits.
Arrogance towards the gods, but also arrogance against the fellow man of
the same social class. The limits can be understood in may connotations
-- but clearly they relate to the standing of each man. An action could
represent Hubris if done against a man of the same social class, but not
so if done against a lowly slave. These concepts where considered
punishable -- certainly if inflicted against the gods -- so [[Hubris
must be]{.mark} considered a vice to be
**[avoided]{.mark}**]{.underline} (pp. 10-14). Bordoni argues that the
concept -- or at least the status of the concept - changes in modernity,
wherein "...Hubrisis elevated to virtue, positively included among the
new values to be acclaimed, as models of behavior to be fostered and
implemented. [[The innovative example]{.mark} refer to [is]{.mark} the
figure of the bourgeoisie, the gentleman who has the courage to take the
commercial or industrial initiative, [who launches]{.mark} himself [into
economic enterprise and **accepts risks**]{.mark} in view [of **future
gain**]{.mark}]{.underline}" (pp. 14-15). Modernity henceforth
reintroduce Hubris as an attribute to be activated. Bordoni elaborates
that ["[Hubris is the violation of the limit.]{.mark} The [limit is what
circumscribes human possibilities;]{.mark} and [Hubris is the desire to
**transcend** the human condition]{.mark}"]{.underline} (pp 20). As such
-- [[Hubris is]{.mark} also then [a drive to **dominate** the
**environment**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} exemplified by the
wholesale deliberate extinction or exclusion of entire species (pp
9-10). [By dominating the environment, man is transcending the initial
human condition.]{.underline} By going beyond the limit man also expands
knowledge as well as technological and social systems. Hubris is as such
the "Engine of History" (pp 9). Man changes history via creativity and
with technology. Bordoni suggests that creativity has the imprint of
Hubris as it "...expresses the possibility of generating something that
did not exist before" (pp 66). Man creates many things -- and most
definingly -- technology and "Technology has only multiplied the human
force, allowing it to realize ( or to plan for the near future)
everything that it has desired to do since its origins: going **[beyond
its limits]{.underline}**, which used to be more modest, necessarily
contained by the absence of adequate means, now increasingly vast and
ambitious thanks to mechanization, knowledge and the availability of
sophisticated tools" (pp 45) [As such Hubris is also applied towards
time as "...cannot help but to look to the future as uncharted territory
to which the search for opportunities of domination can be
extended.]{.underline} Its unknowability -- rather then considering it
as something to abandon in favor of the knowable and controllable
present reality -- translates into a challenge to contend with, using
every means, and is all the more stimulating because it is imbued with
very high do is attributable to Hubris -- to man going beyond his limit.
Indeed -- this is exactly the point of the canonical "limits to Growth
that was published 50 years ago (Meadows & Meodows, 2007). [As was made
clear then, in a finite world -- [there are **limits to
growth**]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is simply impossible with perpetual
expansion in a closed space. Since the industrial revolution we have
seen exponential growth in population and indeed on the human occupancy
and consumption of natural resources. According to Bodoni -- Hubris is
the engine of history, and indeed, [[Hubris means going beyond the
limit]{.mark} of what the natural world can sustain of human claims on
space and resources]{.underline}. [[This has led us to where we are now,
at the **brink of mass extinction**]{.mark}s [and **ecological
collapse.**]{.mark}]{.underline} Humanity has yet not embarked on
commercial scale [**[deep sea mining]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- but there
are many initiatives to kick-start that industry (Bang & Trellevik,
2022a). [Is this Hubris? [It must be.]{.mark}]{.underline} It is
semantically [[Hubris]{.mark} --]{.underline} [[by doing something we

Another conceptual implication arises from the Area's effects on
Indigenous life. This zone is important for climate change mitigation,
resource availability, and cultural heritage. Matters that naturally
concern Indigenous rights extend beyond the divisions imposed by the law
of the sea.21 [[The Area should not be viewed in isolation]{.mark} from
the rest of the planet [because what takes place in the **oceans**
holds]{.mark} profound [**implications** for the **rights** and
**cultural heritage** of]{.mark} coastal **[Indigenous
peoples.]{.mark}**]{.underline} 22 Although it is yet to be implemented,
[the exploitation of minerals in the Area has raised **concerns** among
Indigenous activists and their **scientific** and academic allies
regarding the availability of certain **biological
resources**.]{.underline} 23 For example, in the Hawaiian cultural
tradition, hawksbill turtles hold a significant role in the practice of
hula, a venerable form of traditional dance. Similarly, in the North
Pacific region, the utilization of seal meat for medicinal purposes is
observed among the Aleut, Inuit, and Makah Indigenous communities. 24
[[The availability of these **resources** can be **impacted** by deep
sea mining projects that **do not take into consideration** their
**importance** for Indigenous peoples.]{.mark}]{.underline} While these
adverse impacts should be considered before the decision to move forward
with deep seabed mining, one cannot overlook the benefits that this
industry could bring. This is especially in relation to the extraction
of critical minerals, which has been argued to be fundamental to the
transition to green energy. 25

Extractivism Series 2024: Introduction," The Arctic Institute,

[[**Extractivism** in the]{.mark} Arctic manifests in various forms,
extending far beyond the physical extraction of natural
resources]{.underline}. This series of papers invites readers to
consider extractivism in its broadest sense, encompassing the extraction
of knowledge, power, and cultural significance, as well as minerals,
oil, and gas. [Physical extractivism, perhaps the most visceral and
visible form, [involves the **removal** of natural **resources** from
the]{.mark} Arctic's **[fragile environment]{.mark}**---mining for
precious minerals, drilling for oil and gas, [and]{.mark} harvesting
marine life]{.underline}. These activities have profound impacts on the
landscape, ecosystems, and the local and [[**Indigenous communities**
whose]{.mark} livelihoods and cultural [practices are]{.mark} intimately
[tied to the **land and sea**.]{.mark}]{.underline} The environmental
degradation resulting from such activities can disrupt traditional ways
of life, leading to conflicts over land use and resource management.

[Beyond the physical, [extractivism also encompasses the **extraction**
of **knowledge**, culture, **agency**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Scientific
expeditions and research projects often gather data and insights from
the Arctic, sometimes without adequately involving or benefiting the
local populations. These extractivisms can lead to one-sided narratives
where the knowledge and expertise of Indigenous peoples are undervalued
or ignored. Norway's recent decision to open its waters to deep-sea
mining has sparked significant debate, highlighting the tension between
scientific exploration and the rights of Indigenous peoples. Similarly,
the stalemate of the Fosen wind case, with its turbines still standing
despite legal challenges, exemplifies how renewable energy projects can
perpetuate extractivist practices. Such practices can reinforce power
imbalances, [[**perpetuating** a **colonial dynamic** where **external**
entities **benefit** from the Arctic's resources, while the **local**
communities **bear the costs**]{.mark}.]{.underline} By exploring these
varied forms of extractivism, this series of papers underscores the
multifaceted nature of resource extraction in the Arctic. It challenges
readers to think critically about the broader implications of
extractivism, advocating for a more inclusive and equitable approach
that respects and integrates Indigenous knowledge and rights. Through
this lens, the series aims to foster a deeper understanding of the
complex dynamics at play in the Arctic, [highlighting the need for
collaborative and sustainable solutions that honor the region's cultural
and environmental heritage.]{.underline}

The Arctic Institute's Arctic Extractivism Series 2024 begins with Emily
Schmidt's thoughtful reflections tracing how entrenched [ideals of
colonialism are playing out in the Arctic and a race for natural
resources]{.underline}. As the region transitions from non-renewable to
renewable energy sources [[there are]{.mark} significant [**tensions**
between Indigenous communities and authorities,]{.mark} stemming [from
the]{.mark} historical and [**ongoing marginalization** of Indigenous
peoples in **energy projects**,]{.mark} both non-renewable and
renewable, which [often]{.mark} proceed [**without** their **consent**
and disrupt **traditional practices**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Dan Ziebarth
highlights the Arctic political community, underscoring the need for
urgent and coordinated action among stakeholders, including the European
Commission and the Sámi people. Ziebarth suggests two possible actions
aimed at integrated Indigenous knowledge into climate policies and
improving EU collaboration with Indigenous peoples to protect the
Arctic. Simone Weichenreider's piece follows, emphasizing the importance
of integrating Indigenous knowledge with Nature-Based Solutions to
address climate challenges in the Arctic. By combining traditional
ecological insights with modern conservation efforts, Weichenreider
argues Indigenous-led initiatives can create more effective,
sustainable, and culturally appropriate solutions for enhancing climate
resilience in the region.

#### Indigenous [resistance]{.underline} to DSM proves extractivism preserves [capitalistic]{.underline} and [colonialist]{.underline} tendencies in the Arctic.

Conclusion A common misconception is that the state's role in causing
climate change will end with the phasing out of oil and gas. But
electric cars (Enuh 2022) and solar panels (Hoff 2024) are made out of
materials like cobalt, copper and nickel, all-natural resources that the
state is turning to the Arctic for. Deep-sea mining is the extraction of
minerals from the bottom of the ocean (Ashford 2024). While this would
no doubt disturb the ecosystems of the deep sea, the majority of the
environmental effects are simply unknown, as there has yet to be
sufficient research on the deepest layer of the ocean (ibid). Such
uncertainties mimic making deep sea mining today similar to the creation
of the early Distant Warning Line created in 1954.

Norway was set to be the first country in the world to allow deep-sea
mining in 2025 (Stallard 2024). But on December 1st, 2024, such efforts
were stopped (McVeigh 2024). This was done by a small coalition of
thirteen out of the 169 members of Parliament, known as the Socialist
Left Party (Hivert 2024). These politicians refused to approve the
national budget for the upcoming New Year with the government's current
plans to open deep-sea mining licenses to companies (ibid). [This
[political protest succeeded, and d]{.mark}eep-[s]{.mark}ea
[m]{.mark}ining in Norway [was halted for]{.mark} at least [another
year]{.mark}]{.underline} (ibid). Such an incredible effort was only
made possible because an entire party had decided to make deep-sea
mining their main issue area. In choosing the national budget as the
method to intervene[, these legislators effectively decided to attack
[the **initial motivation** behind **colonialism** and extractionism in
the first place: **capitalism**.]{.mark}]{.underline} But these
legislators are not the leaders behind the movement to stop deep-sea
mining: this coalition work would not have been possible without the
many Sami (Indigenous Scandinavian) activists such as Ida Helene
Benonisen who have been protesting and organizing on this issue for
months, even facing arrest (Bensonisen 2024).

What is remarkable about the Socialist Left party's work to stop deep
sea mining is how none of these legislators were Sami, and many of them
were not even from the Arctic ("The People in SV," 2024). As I conclude
my paper with the point of how the Arctic is a point of critical
environmental injustice due to its function as a boon to state power,
the battle to stop deep sea mining in Norway proves to be a contemporary
example of [how everyone, even settlers, can band together in resistance
against the colonial empires that seek to destroy the ecosystems and
Indigenous peoples call the Arctic home.]{.underline}

#### The 1AC's development of the Arctic is inherently [colonial]{.underline}\-\--[capitalist extraction]{.underline} excludes Indigenous [knowledge]{.underline} and practices, perpetuating a [settler colonialist]{.underline} cycle. [Decolonization]{.underline} is key to solve.

[[To **decolonize**]{.mark} resource development, Alaska [Native
populations must have **greater control** over the
**process**.]{.mark}]{.underline} In other words, one overarching aim of
decolonization in practice is Indigenous sovereignty. However,
(neo)colonial narratives shape and are ingrained within the traditional
concept of state-centered sovereignty. Within this concept, the aims of
the government are continually prioritized; a hierarchy is established
whereby the interests and concerns of the state are given
primacy.^27)^ This dynamic is one of the reasons why, in the case of
Alaska and Alaska Native populations, resource development continues to
be experienced as a colonial enterprise. [[The gains from **extractive
activities** do not]{.mark} necessarily or primarily [benefit]{.mark}
Alaska [**Native** populations,^28)^ and the interests of **outside
actors** are **prioritized**.]{.mark}]{.underline}^29)^ Oftentimes,
wealth from resource development has been extracted from northern
regions to benefit other populations.^30)^ An evaluation of the Red Dog
Mine in northwest Alaska, for instance, found that the local population
received a relatively modest share of benefits in terms of employment,
income, and mobility.^31)^ 

As established through ANCSA, the Regional Corporations are the primary
route for Alaska Native participation in governing resource development
in the US Arctic. These corporations, however, operate under US
corporate law and, therefore, within the frameworks of the capitalist
order. Participation through the structure of the Regional Corporations,
thus, [limits the opportunity for Alaska Native populations to achieve
self-determination outside of those conventions.]{.underline} In action,
considering the embeddedness of the corporations within the capitalist
and colonial dynamics of the state, decolonization may necessitate
enhancing the power of and regard for local governments rather than
governing resource development principally through the Regional
Corporations.

Prioritization of Western knowledge and conventions

[[A deep-rooted **colonial mentality**]{.mark} that remains pervasive
[is the assumed supremacy of a **Western knowledge**
system.]{.mark}]{.underline} This creates a paternalistic relationship
wherein decisions are made by external 'experts' and imposed upon the
Indigenous population. [In short, [**Indigenous** ways of knowing are
**undermined**.]{.mark}]{.underline}^[3]{.mark}2)^ The term Indigenous
knowledge is defined as "the understandings, skills and philosophies
developed by societies with long histories of interaction with their
natural surroundings".^33)^ [[Efforts to **decolonize**]{.mark} resource
development [in the US Arctic must not only **embrace** these
different]{.mark} worldviews, [perspectives, and **knowledge systems**,
but put them **first.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The present article seeks to frame [the "Arctic resource boom"]{.mark}
as [a new wave of Arctic **settler colonialism**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
We argue that, although projects for resource exploitation of the Arctic
are achieving unprecedented scale, [they represent a c[ontinuity of the
colonial project]{.mark}, benefitting from the way previous waves of
colonization have shaped and reshaped Arctic spaces and the relations
between Indigenous peoples and their traditional
territories.]{.underline} Our discussion is focused on the impacts of
colonialism over the Beringian portion of Inuit Nunaat -- the Inuit
homeland -- and the impacts of colonialism over the relation between
State, indigenous peoples and Arctic spaces. Then we move on to a
discussion of the Arctic resource boom and the strategic and development
projects emerging in the Arctic policies of littoral states and their
treatment of indigenous issues amid economic and strategic pressures to
carve out new extractive enclaves in Arctic territories.

We depart from a historical account of Arctic colonialism, seeking to
understand how the colonial encounter between Inuit and Euro-American
populations and the importance of resource extraction shaped
contemporary Arctic spaces -- from baleen and whale oil to the gold rush
and discovery of hydrocarbons. One important element here is to
understand how this first moment of colonialism set up the conditions
for modern-day resource development projects. The discussion, then,
turns to contemporary economic development projects in the Arctic,
understanding them as neo-extractivist enterprises -- i.e.,
[[enterprises that rely heavily on resource development]{.mark} and
[control over]{.mark} space in a late capitalist globalized economy. As
such, these projects represent a geographical expansion of extractive
frontiers in a global scale, seeking new resource reserves and to
reshape space to make them commercially viable. [This represents a new
wave of **colonialism** -- i.e., of attempts]{.mark} by state and
capital [to enhance **control** over traditional indigenous
territories]{.mark}]{.underline} -- and a new wave of threats and
attempts at dispossessing Arctic Indigenous Peoples from their rights to
their traditional lands and livelihoods.

The Arctic stands at the forefront of our global climate crisis.
Experiencing warming at more than twice the rate of the rest of the
planet, the Arctic faces dramatic transformations as ancient ice melts,
permafrost thaws, and ecosystems undergo upheaval. These changes lead to
a cascade of challenges, from coastal erosion to shifting wildlife
habitats, threatening both natural landscapes and the communities that
depend on them. In response to these pressing challenges, integrating
[[Indigenous knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark} into nature-based solutions
(NbS) [[presents a promising approach to enhancing]{.mark} [climate
resilience]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[NbS is a recently emerging term for actions to leverage the power of
ecosystems to protect people, optimize infrastructure, and ensure a
stable and biodiverse future]{.underline}. These natural (climate)
solutions include conservation efforts, habitat restoration, water
resource management, and green infrastructure initiatives.1) By
harnessing natural ecosystems, NbS can provide up to 37 percent of the
mitigation needed by 2030 to achieve the targets of the Paris Agreement
and give several benefits for climate adaptation and biodiversity
enhancement.2) Informed and well-structured NbS can reduce climate
change impacts on local communities and counter biodiversity loss.
However, effective NbS are complex and difficult to design, especially
in fragile ecosystems. Therefore, [Indigenous
[communities]{.mark}]{.underline} and their knowledges [[are
crucial]{.mark} [for finding effective solutions to preserve and protect
the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Combining NbS with Indigenous knowledge, also known as traditional
ecological knowledge, [[can greatly enhance the effectiveness]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} [local climate and conservation
actions]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indigenous peoples, despite comprising
only a small fraction of the global population, manage between 13 and 20
percent of the world's lands, which contain approximately 80 percent of
the remaining global biodiversity. In the Arctic, this includes
communities such as the Sámi in Finland, Sweden, Norway, and Northwest
Russia; the Nenets, Khanty, Evenk, and Chukchi in Russia; the Aleut,
Yupik, and Inuit (Iñupiat) in Alaska; the Inuit (Inuvialuit) in Canada;
and the Inuit (Kalaallit) in Greenland.3) Since Indigenous communities'
livelihoods are often directly linked to the surrounding land, northern
Indigenous groups are particularly vulnerable to climate change,
experiencing its impacts more intensely and rapidly than many other
regions. For millennia, Arctic Indigenous groups like the Inuit and Sámi
have developed sophisticated land management systems and ecological
knowledge crucial for maintaining their ecosystems' delicate balance.

This article explores the importance of combining Indigenous knowledge
with NbS to address climate change impacts in the Arctic, highlighting
the indispensable role of Indigenous expertise in achieving successful
and sustainable outcomes.

Indigenous Knowledge

Indigenous knowledge encompasses the deep, place-based understanding and
practices developed by Indigenous communities. [This [knowledge]{.mark}
[integrates **cultural, spiritual, and ecological insights**]{.mark}
into **managing and conserving local environments**]{.underline}.
[[Indigenous]{.mark} [peoples]{.mark} and their knowledge systems [offer
holistic and local perspectives]{.mark} on]{.underline} climate [risk
management]{.underline}, integrating cultural, intergenerational, and
place-based understandings in Arctic ecosystems.4) Many Indigenous
communities live on and manage significant portions of the land in
Arctic regions and retain vital ancestral knowledge and expertise in
conserving nature, protecting biodiversity, and addressing climate and
disaster risks through adaptation and mitigation strategies.5) In many
cases, [[their connection with the land]{.underline}]{.mark} and their
surrounding ecosystems is deeply rooted in spiritual and cultural
traditions that have evolved over millennia,
[[offer]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[a distinct perspective]{.mark} on land
stewardship]{.underline} that contrasts sharply with values imposed by
Western colonialism.

However, it is essential to recognize the diversity and complexity
within Indigenous communities. While many Indigenous groups emphasize
sustainable practices and environmental stewardship, there are
significant variations in perspectives and approaches. Some communities
support resource extraction projects like oil, gas, and mining for
economic benefits, while others strongly oppose such activities to
protect their lands and cultural heritage. These differences highlight
that Indigenous knowledge systems are not monolithic but are shaped by
distinct cultural, economic, and environmental contexts.

Indigenous communities possess traditional ecological knowledge
essential for sustainably understanding and managing Arctic
environments. [Their practices]{.underline}, shaped by an intimate
relationship with the surrounding environment, emphasize long-term
sustainability. Most Indigenous governance systems [prioritize community
well-being and environmental stewardship, making them natural allies in
climate resilience efforts.]{.underline}6) In this sense, Indigenous
knowledge systems are crucial for safeguarding biodiversity and
ecosystem services.7)

For example, the Sámi people possess a profound and reciprocal
relationship with nature, which is deeply rooted in spiritual and
cultural traditions. Sámi elders emphasize that this relationship itself
is a core value, connecting individuals to their environment, its
history, and heritage. The Sámi view humans as an integral part of
nature, not superior to other life forms, with a role to maintain
harmony within the ecosystem. This relationship is guided by principles
of modesty---taking only what is needed---and respect for all beings,
ensuring actions do not endanger species or cause unnecessary harm.
Traditional Sámi livelihoods such as herding, fishing, gathering,
trapping, and hunting in areas they call "meahcci" reflect their
sustainable practices and intimate knowledge of the land. The Sámi
governance model, or "siida," designates family territories, fostering
stewardship and sustainable use. The Sámi's ability to sustain healthy
ecosystems and preserve their Indigenous knowledge is crucial, as these
are seen as the foundation of their life and a vital safety net for the
future.8)

Arctic Indigenous-led Nature-based Solutions

NbS in the Arctic offer promising strategies for climate adaptation and
environmental restoration by leveraging natural processes to address
challenges like permafrost thaw and biodiversity loss.9) Examples
include wetland restoration to enhance carbon sequestration and
rewilding efforts that support wildlife and ecosystem health. However,
implementing NbS in the Arctic faces several challenges. The extreme
climate and rapidly changing conditions complicate the deployment and
effectiveness of these solutions. Standard approaches often overlook the
unique needs and complexities of specific ecosystems.

Acknowledging and [[incorporating Indigenous knowledge]{.mark} and
leadership [is **necessary for success**]{.mark}]{.underline}ful and
sustainable local NbS in Northern regions. Local communities can often
provide a nuanced understanding of local ecosystems and traditional
practices. NbS, therefore, need the expertise and insights Indigenous
communities can provide to lead towards success.

Several Indigenous-led nature-based initiatives in the Arctic
demonstrate the potential of integrating Indigenous knowledge into
nature-based efforts. In the European Arctic, the Skolt Sámi have
showcased this expertise by restoring rivers damaged by human activities
to address the rapidly progressing climate change. Their efforts on the
Vainosjoki River have revived critical habitats for trout, grayling, and
other cold-dependent fish, creating safe havens by applying Sámi
Indigenous knowledge. By engaging in community-led self-reflection, the
Skolt Sámi have developed a regional strategy for habitat restoration,
bolstering resilience, food security, and the survival of both human and
non-human life in the present and future.10)

Another example can be found in the adaptation strategy worked out by
the Inuit Circumpolar Council's Pikialasorsuaq Commission, which was
based on local Inuit knowledge:11) Pikialasorsuaq, the Greenlandic name
for the North Water Polynya, is the Arctic Ocean's largest and most
northerly year-round open water area, sustained by an ice bridge.
Climate change threatens this ice bridge, risking the polynya's future.
This biologically productive area supports millions of seabirds, fish,
narwhal, beluga, bowhead, walrus, and seals and is vital for Inuit
hunters. In response to these threats, the Pikialasorsuaq Commission
gathered insights from Inuit communities in Canada and Greenland to
develop Inuit-led management, monitoring, and adaptation strategies.

In Finland, peatland restoration has become a crucial NbS for combating
climate change and ecological degradation, with Indigenous knowledge at
its core. A standout example of effective peatland restoration is the
Linnunsuo project in North Karelia, where the Snowchange Cooperative
partnered with the Skolt Sámi.12) This collaboration utilized Skolt
Sámi's traditional knowledge, which offered vital insights into the
peatland's original ecological conditions and relationships. Restoration
efforts involved rewetting the peatland by blocking drainage ditches and
restoring natural water flows, which revived its role as a carbon sink.
Traditional knowledge guided these actions, supporting the ecological
balance and local wildlife. The project also focused on reintroducing
native species, using Indigenous insights to select appropriate plants
and animals for the restored environment. The success of Linnunsuo went
beyond environmental benefits; it created economic opportunities for
local communities through sustainable fishing and eco-tourism.
Indigenous involvement, particularly by Skolt Sámi women, ensured that
their traditional practices were integrated into managing and monitoring
the restored landscape. The Linnunsuo project demonstrates how blending
Indigenous knowledge with scientific approaches can effectively restore
degraded ecosystems and address climate change. It sets a precedent for
future rewilding projects by showing the value of incorporating
traditional ecological wisdom into modern conservation efforts.

The Path Forward

While NbS holds great promise for climate resilience in the Arctic,
[[barriers remain]{.underline}]{.mark} in its implementation and
thoroughness, [[particularly]{.mark} [concerning]{.mark}]{.underline}
the potential [[impacts on Indigenous communities]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Such [[impacts exacerbate existing vulnerabilities]{.mark}, [including
poverty and discrimination]{.mark}.]{.underline}13) Extractive
industries and poorly planned development projects can threaten
Indigenous lands and livelihoods, undermining the effectiveness of NbS
initiatives. [[Integrating Indigenous knowledge]{.mark} into NbS design
and implementation processes can [address these challenges]{.mark}
effectively.]{.underline}

To harness the full potential of NbS for climate resilience in the
Arctic, it is essential to prioritize Indigenous perspectives in NbS
policies and practices. By prioritizing Indigenous perspectives and
leadership, NbS initiatives can become more effective, culturally
appropriate, and sustainable, ensuring the long-term resilience of
Arctic communities and ecosystems. This requires meaningful engagement
and empowering Indigenous peoples in decision-making processes.
Furthermore, capacity-building initiatives and knowledge-sharing
platforms can facilitate the exchange of best practices and empower
Indigenous communities to lead NbS efforts in their territories. How
this can actually be facilitated is laid out by Linda Brewer and Edith
Vorderstrasse in a set of engagement principles: They state that
successful Arctic Social Engagement is designed around a set of
underlying beliefs, such as a deep respect for the ecological experience
and knowledge of the local and Indigenous Peoples; the acknowledgment
that the involvement optimizes decision-making, the recognition and
trust for evolving relationships and the believe that any impact must
support the community and its culture.14) Empowering Indigenous
communities involves removing external pressures that hinder autonomous
evaluation, self-assessment, and responses to climate change, including
addressing inflexible and centralized policies imposed by state
governments.

Arctic Indigenous communities are already taking adaptive actions at the
local level, leveraging their traditional knowledge and innovative
approaches to respond to changing environmental conditions. While these
efforts may seem modest in scale, they have far-reaching implications
for global climate resilience. Strengthening the decision-making
capacity of Indigenous communities is therefore pivotal for ensuring a
more resilient, secure, and equitable future for Arctic Peoples and the
planet.

Concluding Remarks

Indigenous knowledge, rooted in millenia of interaction with local
ecosystems, encompasses traditional ecological insights, practices, and
wisdom passed down through generations. NbS leverage natural processes
and ecosystem services to address environmental challenges such as
climate change and biodiversity loss. In the Arctic, combining
Indigenous knowledge with NbS creates a powerful synergy for effectively
tackling climate impacts.

Integrating Indigenous knowledge with NbS offers a profound depth of
understanding that is often missed in conventional approaches.
Indigenous communities possess detailed and context-specific knowledge
about their environments, enabling the design of more nuanced and
effective solutions. This holistic perspective ensures that NbS are
environmentally sustainable, culturally appropriate, and resilient.
Collaborative efforts incorporating Indigenous expertise enhance the
potential of NbS in the Arctic. For example, projects like the Skolt
Sámi's river restoration and the Pikialasorsuaq Commission's adaptation
strategies demonstrate the success of Indigenous-led initiatives. By
leveraging traditional knowledge, these projects create effective and

[This chapter examines the recent oceanic turn in the humanities,
particularly what French theorist Gaston Bachelard once termed the
"depth imagination," and argues that it has been reconstituted by a new
era of extraction, in both material and imaginary terms.2 In the
epigraph to this chapter, marine biologist Sylvia Earle reminds us of
the true value of extraction as the possibility of species being.
Extraction is also about futurity, narrative, technology, and
speculation. Here I stage an interdisciplinary [conversation]{.mark}
between recent scholarship [about]{.mark} the speculative practices of
deep-sea mining ("[DSM]{.mark}") [and speculative fiction]{.mark} ("sf")
[that imagine techno-utopian futures of human life]{.mark} under the
sea. In doing so, I raise questions about the ways in which particular
kinds of literary genres and reading practices produce an extractive
imaginary, and examine the uncomfortable overlap between the concept of
innovation as a driver of the blue economy as well as the blue
humanities. I'll begin with an overview of what I've seen in the
development of what is being called critical ocean studies or the blue
humanities (which are different strands of scholarship) from the
perspective of my training in postcolonial literary studies. I provide
this critical background in order to make two provocative
claims---first, that the turn to what is being called the "blue
humanities," while certainly driven by our environmental crisis and the
ecological/multispecies turn in scholarship, is also the product of the
neoliberalization of academia and the rebranding of humanities work in
an era of intellectual and economic downsizing. Second, that while
[there is currently a scramble for mineral]{.mark} rights and access to
the seabed [by transnational mining conglomerates]{.mark} purportedly
[due to]{.mark} the global shift toward ["green" technologies]{.mark},
the [oceanic turn in capitalism]{.mark} and scholarship seems to
[fulfill a desire for a]{.mark} material and intellectual [(blue)
"spatial fix."]{.mark} Consequently, this [spatial fix]{.mark} is a
critical current in the development of a contemporary depth imagination,
a vision [derived from]{.mark} both creative and extractive
[capital.]{.mark} Critical ocean studies is an interdisciplinary method
of thinking with, engaging, and submerging into the ontological,
material, political, and cultural body of the largest part of our
biosphere. Its ontological concerns might be illuminated by Gaston
Bachelard's claim that "space, vast space, is the friend of being."4 In
recent years, the field has challenged the surface-based readings of
oceanic representation, has dived deeply into complex multispecies
entanglements, and has focused more pointedly on the logic of capital
and its flows as well as its concordant militarization, from nuclear
testing to the ways in which US naval forces "secure the volume" for the
transit of oil.5 Cold War politics have been critical to oceanic
thinking; the oceanic turn in humanities scholarship was largely a
response to the enclosure of the oceans through the Truman Proclamation
of 1945 and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
(UNCLOS), a global conversation and debate about 99 percent of the
planet's biosphere.6 An oceanic current emerged in the 1990s at the peak
of the new fields of globalization and diaspora studies. The general
approach from anglophone scholars in History, Anthropology, and Cultural
Studies such as James Clifford, Marcus Rediker and Peter Linebaugh, and
Paul Gilroy was to think in terms of the fluidity and flow of migrants,
refugees, pirates, sailors, and cosmopolitans as a vital
counter-narrative to the fixity of the ethnic absolutisms that are
entrenched in the structural racism of the nation-state.7 While they
focused on the concept of the ship as a chronotope and the flow of
(heterosexual male) bodies across social and material borders, the
metaphors of fluidity were not all together new. I argued in a
book---which was very much a child of these discourses---that the ocean
was a vital and ubiquitous trope of the flows and torrents of British
expansion and trade in the 18th and 19th century, evident in British
poetry as well as travel narratives.8 [There is a critical link between
transoceanic empire, the rise of capitalism]{.mark}, and the imaginative
grammar of fluidity and flow. In an important book on H20, Ivan Illich
argued that the concept of the circulation of social fluids was imagined
through images of blood, water, and commodities in 18th-century Europe.
By 1750, the social came "to be imagined as a system of conduits," where
the "liquidity" of bodies, labor, ideas, raw materials, capital, and
products arose as a "dominant metaphor."9 In sum, transoceanic empire
helped constitute a fluid grammar for what Edward LiPuma and Benjamin
Lee call "circulatory capitalism."10 This liquidity was also
constitutive of the discourse of globalization, postmodernity, and what
sociologist Zygmunt Bauman famously termed "liquid modernity."11 This
fluid turn was not necessarily engaged in the ontology of "wet matter,"
to borrow from geographers Philip Steinberg and Kimberley Peters.12 In
other words, the oceans were spaces to be traversed by (heteronormative)
male agents, not necessarily to immerse or submerge in a dynamic
relation to nonhuman matter (water) and more-than-human species as we
see in more scholarship today.13 The oceanic turn in scholarship after
the 1990s was not just driven by the changing mobilities of human
activity but also by the largest remapping of the planet since the
Truman Proclamation which declared the length of a coastal "cannon-shot"
(200 miles) as sovereign national territory. This created what Maltese
Ambassador Arvind Pardo famously labeled a global "scramble for the
seas" which was based on the expectation of new technologies for
extracting strategic seabed minerals like manganese. This eventually led
to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea which, when
ratified by over 165 states in 1994, enclosed the oceanic global
commons.14 Because this remapping includes the sea, subsea, and
airspace, this is the largest juridical and cartographic change to the
globe in human history. Just as 18th-century discourse adopted a lexicon
reflecting the fluidity of empire, our 21st-century discourse is
entangled with the aquatic flows of neoliberal extraction and
"circulatory capitalism." Critical ocean studies is attentive to how the
enclosure of the seas has discursive effects. In other words, aquatic
space shapes our language just as we are shaped by the ocean, materially
and ontologically. Consequently, in this shift to the "blue economy"
it's not surprising that global regime changes are reflected in the
maritime grammars we use to communicate about everything from fluidity
to the "blue humanities."15 There is precedent to this argument that
geopolitical and juridical changes impact academic disciplines as well
as discourse. For example, the late capitalist era of globalization that
characterized the 1990s "Asia Pacific pivot" led literature scholars
such as Christopher Connery to theorize the utopian discourse of the
Pacific Rim in relation to the increased visibility of transnational
capital. Connery located the emergence of Pacific Rim studies as an
academic reflection of US imperialism as it continues to fulfill its
"manifest destiny" by expanding across the Pacific toward Asian capital,
reflecting a similar teleology to that which led the US to overthrow the
sovereign territory of Hawai\`i in 1893.16 Building on the work of David
Harvey, Connery argued that: The concept of region, arising as it does
within a binary logic of difference, is a semiotic utopia, a "spatial
fix" for those faced with analyzing the always differentiating but
always concealing logic of capital. The region, less encumbered by the
various ideological or mythical mystifications that pervade the state,
will be where history and analysis takes place.17 The ocean and its
disciplinary reframings and investments also reflect a similar fixing of
desire. This is a conceptual, spatial, and neoliberal fix, as I will
explain. To Harvey, the [problems of capital's excess]{.mark} [are
resolved (temporarily)]{.mark} [through]{.mark} space: "the absorption
of excess capital and labor (is achieved through) geographical
expansion. [This spatial fix]{.mark} ... [entails the production of new
spaces within which capitalist production can proceed."]{.mark}18 **Here
we see [capitalism's use of the oceanic body as an accumulation strategy
or fix]{.mark}.** Having exhausted terrestrial markets, capitalism
co-creates and adapts technologies to turn to outer space and the
so-called inner space of the oceanic realm. Yet this new era of unfixed
capital, derivatives, and speculative futures raises new formal and
conceptual questions about the oceanic turn. In their work on Financial
Derivatives and the Globalization of Risk, LiPuma and Lee claim that we
are now in an era of "circulatory capitalism": speculative capital,
circulated through risk driven derivatives, is currently restructuring
the relationship between production and circulation by accelerating and
expanding the spatial reach of the reproduction of capital ... We are
witnessing the rise of a transformed form or new phase of capitalism in
which production is (and remains) a crucial, indispensable, but now
encompassed moment of a globalizing system that is striving toward a
different type of totality.19 Their metaphors of fluidity about
"cultures of circulation" and "streams of capital" point toward the ways
in which technologies help produce the overaccumulation of capital and
thus by extension, will need a spatial fix.20 That spatial fix,
increasingly, has become the world ocean.]{.underline}

[In their article "The Blue Fix," the authors Zoe Brent, Mads
Barbesgaard, and Carsten Pedersen provide a compelling argument about
the ways in which the [UNCLOS]{.mark} enclosure [created a spatial fix
for capitalism]{.mark}, [a new frontier for raw materials and
consumption. The neoliberal discourse of "blue growth, blue economy,
blue revolution" as well as blue investments and blue mining seek to
entice state and corporate investment in ocean technologies and
extractive industries without addressing the social and technological
propensity for devastating ecological loss]{.mark}.21 This spatial fix
is comprised of a "conservation fix" (ecosystems management), a "protein
fix" (industrial fisheries), and an "energy/extractive fix" (offshore
and deep-sea mining). **[Their particular concern is the commodification
of the ocean and its resources and the ways in which states and
corporate actors are working together to create a neoliberal blue
economy.]{.mark}** Turning briefly to an infographic from the World
Bank, we see that the blue economy is defined as a "sustainable use of
ocean resources for economic growth, improved livelihoods and jobs, and
ocean ecosystem health" based on the management of renewable energy,
fisheries, transportation, waste, and tourism. The authors of "The Blue
Fix" point out the International Seabed Authority (ISA) which manages
what is called the "Area" beyond the exclusive economic zone
("EEZ")---nearly half the surface of the earth not to mention volume---
distributes corporate mining rights through its Legal and Technical
Commission (LTC) without transparency, even to its own member states.22
This question of imagining the "Area"---a space far beyond terrestrial
vision---is precisely the concern of this chapter and apparently of the
ISA itself, which hosted a visual arts competition for World Oceans Day
in 2021 to represent the abyss.23 This is a timely moment for exploring,
imagining, and representing all things oceanic, which is increasingly
branded as "blue." Brent, Barbesgaard, and Pedersen note the dizzying
accumulation of new "blue" concepts from finance to revolution. While
they do not mention the "blue humanities," certainly one must question
the rebranding of disciplines during this unprecedented scramble for the
minerals of the seabed and neoliberal downsizing of arts and humanities
divisions and departments. Generally speaking, critical ocean studies
foregrounds methodologies that examine the hydropower of militarism,
empire, slavery, and extractivism to a greater extent than the
scholarship engaged in the blue humanities, which has more literary and
Eurocentric origins.24 Here I will dive in a bit deeper into the
extractive imaginary to engage its speculative futures. There is
critical new scholarship being produced about the enclosure of the
ocean, "speculative capitalist futures,"25 and the oceanic
"techno-frontier" which is "always open and expanding."26 Under the
guise of neoliberal extractive regimes, the ocean has become a new space
of the blue economy, a new commodity frontier in the scramble for rare
earth elements and so-called green energy supplies, leading to new
vocabularies and practices of deep-sea oil exploration, subsea carbon
dioxide capture (CCS), and ocean carbon sequestration.27 This has
produced a new body of interdisciplinary scholarship with a critical eye
on DSM. Of particular concern is the public-private alliance of
transnational extractive industries with nation-states (that is, for
drilling within the EEZ) or with the International Seabed Authority
(ISA), when mining takes place in the "Area."28 DSM is understood to be
a range of practices in the seabed, water column, as well as processing
on land and thus the scholarship presses against the industry's claims
that this supposedly remote drilling will cause no social or ecological
effects. The creation of this "blue frontier" and commodification of the
ocean's minerals is speculative because the technologies are, as yet,
untested outside of one project off the coast of Okinawa.29
Nevertheless, an unprecedented number of exploratory permits have been
granted by the ISA, and in the next year mining will commence in the
Clarion Clipperton Zone, an abyssal plain of the Pacific that is 1.7
million square miles large, which is the width of the continental United
States.30 The Canadian-based mining conglomerate Nautilus attempted to
mine in the territorial waters of Papua New Guinea, naming themselves
after the ship in the Jules Vernes 1870 adventure novel, 20,000 Leagues
Under the Sea, presumably as a way to frame extraction as adventure. In
the scholarship on the rhetoric of extractive industries, scholars have
pointed out that DSM poses challenges to what is called the "social
license to operate" from the local community, because the mining itself
takes place far offshore.31 Thus the usual corporate social technologies
that manufacture consent in extraction zones are challenged in an effort
to create a "deep-sea community." As Carver, Childs, and Steinberg et
al. argue, these companies trade in the discourse of nautical adventure
and the blue economy through "blue growth discourse that (re)opens the
ocean to imaginations of adventure, wherein new opportunities can be
harnessed, and potential capital accumulated."32 This new extractive
imaginary33 of a blue frontier is not only produced through the
industries themselves. It is also evident in a 2019 sf (science or
speculative fiction) ocean anthology commissioned by XPRIZE, an
organization funded by Royal Dutch Shell PLC (Shell), entitled Current
Futures: A Sci-Fi Ocean Anthology, which demonstrates the suturing of
the extractive imaginary to the genre of sf itself.34 Taken as a whole,
the online short story collection and accompanying art gives us an
altogether neoliberal vision of the "depth imagination" as it merges
petrocapitalist extraction narratives with speculative fiction.35 My
claim is that [because DSM and other forms of oceanic extraction take
place outside of coastal vision]{.mark}, [XPRIZE has funded an
international group of speculative fiction authors and artists---from
all seven continents---to help give them a "social license to
operate."]{.mark}36 In watching their introductory and celebratory
video, "We are XPRIZE," one is struck by its global, totalizing visual
scope; the way in which [it frames competition and its financial rewards
as the way to incentivize technology and the future; the focus on "big"
and "grand challenges"; the narrative that capitalism is something that
"solves" problems but industry is lagging and thus needs]{.mark} [a
technological fix (as they claim---"problems that the markets have
failed to solve").]{.mark} Like the invocation of the Nautilus, [XPRIZE
employs a narrative of]{.mark} adventure on a journey to the future as
well as to the deep oceans and outer space; and their film emphasizes
going "deep into the imagination," to extract ideas and transform them
into a techno-utopia of "hopefulness," "added value," and [a STEM
future, where petrocapitalism still reigns but is slightly
cleaner]{.mark}.37 **[The organization emphasizes oil cleanup
technologies because they do not imagine a future outside of
petrocapitalism.]{.mark}**]{.underline}
