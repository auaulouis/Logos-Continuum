[[**Jurisdictional** devolution]{.mark} legislation]{.underline} grants
[jurisdiction]{.underline} from a centralized [power]{.underline} to
other polities. D.E. Smith discusses jurisdictional devolution in the
context of Australia's relationship with Indigenous communities
[[as]{.mark} a "[**process** of **power** sharing within]{.mark} a
common legal and government order."6]{.underline}4 According to Smith,
"\[a\]ny move along the centralised-devolved continuum can therefore
take a [range of [forms]{.mark} with variation in jurisdictional
coverage and [in]{.mark} the extent of **[autonomy]{.mark}** and
interdependence.]{.underline}"65 Grammond writes that an Indigenous
community may wish to exercis[e [**delegated** authority]{.mark} over
some issues, but not o]{.underline}thers, "ther[eby [enabling]{.mark} a
gradual [**transition** towards]{.mark} a **[full exercise]{.mark}** of
its own jurisdiction."66]{.underline} When a Canadian government
delegates jurisdi[ction [over]{.mark} a [**subject** matter]{.mark}
thr]{.underline}ough their section 91 or 92 powers to Indigenous
communities, they engage in jurisdictional devolution. As will be
further discussed, doing so can [[entrench]{.mark} Indigenous
**[self-gov]{.mark}**ernment.]{.underline}

Devolution legislation [[delegates]{.mark} jurisdictional [power
**"downwards"** to intermediate]{.mark} or local
[polities]{.mark}]{.underline}.67 There are several features of a
devolved system of sovereignty. For example, the centralized polity
retains the formal possibility to overturn devolution legislation
because devolution legislation is regular law.68 J[urisdictional
devolution is thus a practical explanation for what occurs when the
legislature [gives **Indigenous**]{.mark} communities
[jurisdiction]{.mark}]{.underline}, rather than recognizes their
inherent jurisdiction. Under jurisdictional devolution, [the inherent
right to self-government is not given **full force**]{.underline}
because the legislature can repeal the granted jurisdiction without
needing to justify it.

Jurisdictional devolution is part of the delegation model, but it
differs notably from other types of delegation. Unlike administrative
devolution, [jurisdictional devolution [devolves
**jurisdiction**,]{.mark} rather than **limited** program and service
administration, [to Indigenous]{.mark} communities. **Instead** of
administering **another government's** programs]{.underline}, genuine
local jurisdiction [[involves **final** decision-making power
and]{.mark} the **[development]{.mark}**]{.underline} of institutions
designed by local communities.69 Of course, the difference requires
careful treatment. Policy-makers must take care to [[ensure]{.mark} that
any]{.underline} jurisdictional devolution to Indigenous communities
does not merely encompass the offloading of responsibility [without
[adequate **financial** supports.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Smith's argument of a "centralised-devolved continuum" is useful here
and can be pushed further. I[t is more useful to see delegation and
recognition as existing [on]{.mark} a **[scale]{.mark}** or continuum
[of]{.mark} Indigenous **[self-gov]{.mark}**ernment]{.underline}. On one
end, only limited administrative delegation may occur. At the other end,
Parliament and legislatures may recognize the inherent right of
self-government.

While each model has a different constitutional source (section 91 or
section 92, versus an inherent right protected by section 35) they may
be placed on the same continuum because of the legislatures' key role in
each to date. As Grammond writes, courts have usually waited for
statutory cues to "slowly...draw out the implications of section 35 of
the Constitution Act, 1982 for the recognition of Indigenous laws."70
These [statutory cues often "target a relatively **narrow** legal issue
and instruct judges or other legal officials to resolve it
[through]{.mark} the [**application** of **Indigenous**
laws]{.mark}."7]{.underline}1 Even under a recognition model "state
institutions retain a significant role" because "\[d\]ecisions have to
be made as to which Indigenous laws should be recognized, how the
contents of these laws can be conveyed to non-Indigenous legal actors,
\[and\] who will be subject to these laws."72 Borrows also argues that
while Canadian governments and courts should be placed "in their proper
place," they can still "play an important ancillary role...Indigenous
laws could be overlooked and undervalued if they are not championed by
more centralized institutions."73 Thus, while formal recognition is not
needed for Indigenous Peoples "to possess and exercise law," the state
does play a powerful role in advancing statutory cues and choosing which
Indigenous laws to recognize.74

States used to change their premises via economic and/or political
integration or devolution, as well as by increasing their tolerance of
self-determination and self-governing. The [[**devolution** of
power]{.underline}]{.mark} by the Nordic countries has led to a
noticeable change in premises and become a new Arctic governance model.
The 'environmental awakening' changed the Arctic states' premises
dramatically, after environmental protection cooperation became a
trigger for them to reconstruct their geopolitical reality, and by
combining western science and Indigenous Knowledge -- all this is been
materialized by shared interests between the Arctic states, and between
them and Arctic Indigenous Peoples (Heininen, 2013). This [[has
not]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, yet [[meant a **paradigm** shift,
though]{.underline}]{.mark} it has been [[**important** to
maintain]{.underline}]{.mark} the mutually beneficial [[**high
stability** in]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark}, in particular [in]{.mark}
turbulent [times of great power rivalries]{.mark}, regional
**[wars]{.mark}**, **constant** [warfare, and **arms races**.]{.mark}
Here again **[Indigenous]{.mark}** Peoples have [played an **important
role.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

This kind of more tolerant **[[model]{.underline}]{.mark}** of
governance which leans on a variety of factors and actors
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} most probably [[the **best**, if not]{.mark}
the [**only, way** to tackle]{.mark} the **multiple** [issues related to
the **climate**]{.mark} crisis [and]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**ecological
destruction** globally]{.mark} and particularly for the **Arctic**.
[As]{.mark} the climate [crisis is **global** with several
local]{.mark}]{.underline} impacts and [[ramifications]{.mark}, it
[requires]{.mark} a **[motivation]{.mark}**]{.underline} and firm
legitimacy, as well as a holistic approach and capability to be solved.
[[Who]{.mark} are [more motivated]{.mark} and legitimized [than
**Indigenous Peoples**]{.mark}]{.underline} and civil societies,
particularly if they are being [[acknowledged as **equal
actors**]{.underline}]{.mark} in decision-making and in action?

This is also a part of a long-range global tendency of the breaking of
the unified state system, with states as the major, even only, actors in
world politics. This is much indicated by the abovementioned finding
that states seem to be unable to efficiently manage global environmental
problems, and if so, we have to lean on people(s) and civil societies to
take the lead. Nevertheless, what was done nationally in Modernism, is
done internationally, even globally, in the Age of Globalism. Here,
Arctic Indigenous Peoples, having increasing recognition of Indigenous
and human rights frameworks, such as UNDRIP, are playing an important
role. Transdisciplinarity is discussed and applied more often, and
Western science leans on Indigenous knowledge. The [[role]{.mark} might
[become bigger and]{.mark} the application of
**[transdisciplinarity]{.mark}** may be
**[accelerated]{.mark}**]{.underline}, especially if the Arctic states
and governments are neither capable nor willing to differentiate their
policy on sanctions against the Russian Federation by allowing joint
pan-Arctic scientific projects, including Russians, to be continued or
restarted. Alternative ways and procedures based on individuals, which
is already happening (see, Arctic Yearbook 2022), would include
Indigenous Knowledge and its methods.

Indigenous Knowledge and Western Science

Science, together with technology, has been seen as the most efficient
means for development and progress -- the combination has been the motor
behind "western" modernization. Before \"western\" science, which,
excluding Philosophy as a rather young phenomenon, there was traditional
and [**[Indigenous Knowledge]{.mark}** by, and for, Indigenous Peoples.
It [has]{.mark}, [since **time** ]{.mark}**immemorial,** [been
mutually]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**beneficial**]{.mark}, and **often**
the [way to **survive**]{.mark} and **thrive** [for peoples and
**societies**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the same way, science is a part
of the common heritage of humankind, and at the same time it is about
people: for those who do research, and for those whom research is done
for, western science has had a social relevance as well. Equally
important is the freedom of (western) science and the independence of
the scientific community whereby policy-makers do not have repressive
control over science or the scientific community. It is [[**important**
to encourage]{.mark} new [innovations, or **solutions** for]{.mark} the
[problems]{.mark}]{.underline} that society faces today (see the
Knowledge and Science section in this volume).

[[Under]{.mark} the [pressure of **ecological catastrophe**]{.mark},
Indigenous [Knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline} is becoming [increasingly
[recognized]{.mark}]{.underline} [[for]{.mark} its [**ability**
to]{.mark} help [tackle **climate** change and
**biod**]{.mark}**iversity**]{.underline} [[loss]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Western [[science]{.mark} is often **[handicapped]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[due to gaps in knowledge]{.mark} and **data** on climate and other
ecosystems. Indigenous [Knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, can
[[lean on **traditions**, practices,]{.mark} spirituality and [human
**memories**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as well as narratives and stories
held and shared by elders. As a concrete example, the Calotte Academy
organized a town hall meeting, "Understanding the impacts of global
changes in the Barents region", in June 1998 in Inari. Saami fishermen,
hunters and reindeer herders were invited to share their experiences and
knowledge on environmental changes in the region within the last 50
years or so. The meeting [[brought]{.mark} new [data and
information]{.mark}]{.underline} for scientists of an international
research project on global changes, who were running out of proper data,
though scientists did not have patience enough to listen carefully to
all the experiences.

NOAA mean globally-averaged marine surface data show high increases in
methane levels recently, which were used to generate the trends and
curves to the year 2030 in above image.

\[ from earlier post \]

NASA temperature data as adjusted by Sam Carana on the right show the
[potential for a mean temperature **anomaly** from pre-industrial of
**3°C**]{.underline} anomaly to occur late in 2022 (blue trend). By
extension, a 4°C anomaly could occur in late 2023 and a 5°C anomaly in
late 2024.

Above data was used to determine a trend line for exponentially
increasing atmospheric methane increase, as well as where along the
trend lines the surface atmospheric temperature anomalies would occur.

A surface atmospheric temperature anomaly of 10°C was recorded in France
in the summer of 2020 (Copernicus 2020) with the overlying methane
global veil giving a concentration of 2008 ppb. In this case the Global
Warming is only partly caused by the methane (about 85.5%) and the rest
by the concentration of other greenhouse gases.

It seems that [[we]{.mark} only [have]{.mark} a [**very short** time
left]{.mark} unt[il]{.mark} total [**Planetary Extinction** due to the
**Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline} Atmospheric [[Methane Global
Warming]{.underline}]{.mark} Veil. It is now clear that we do not have
time to extract the methane from the subsea Arctic methane reserves,
because [[we are **so close** to total extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}
in 3 years.

The blue color on the map on the right indicates depth (see scale

The image below, by Malcolm Light and based on Max & Lowrie (1993), from
a recent post, shows [[**vulnerable** Arctic]{.mark} Ocean slope and
deep water [**methane hydrates** zones]{.mark}]{.underline} below 300 m
depth.

Malcolm Light indicates three areas:

Area 1. Methane hydrates on the slope;

Area 2. Methane hydrates on the abyssal plane;

Area 3. Methane hydrates associated with the spreading Gakkel Ridge
hydro-thermal activity (the Gakkel Riidge runs in between the northern
tip of Greenland and the Laptev Sea).

In addition, [[huge amounts of **methane**]{.mark} are contained [in
sediments]{.mark}]{.underline} at the bottom of the shallow parts of the
Arctic Ocean, in particular the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS). Dr.
Natalia Shakova warned in 2008 that some 50Gt of carbon in the form of
methane can be released at any moment from the East Siberian Arctic
Shelf alone[, [because of]{.mark} the high
[temperature]{.mark}]{.underline} of the invading Atlantic (Gulf Stream)
waters. This [[threatens to cause]{.mark} a [**10°C**]{.mark} surface
atmospheric [temperature increase leading to **Global
Extinction**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The [[**cataclysmic** weather]{.mark} events occurring worldwide
including **[giant droughts]{.mark}** and
[city-destroying]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**fires**, **floods**]{.mark}
and summer and winter [storm]{.mark} system[s]{.mark} have [**already**
devastated Canada and]{.mark} the **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates.]{.underline}

From the sharp increase in catastrophic weather events, it is obvious
that 'Mother Earth' has correctly identified the [[**North
America**n]{.mark} continent [as]{.mark} the [source of]{.mark} its
**gigantic [pollution]{.mark}** [problems.]{.mark}]{.underline} Extreme
Fossil Fuel pollution from the United States and Canada has previously
heated up the Gulf Stream which flows north into the Arctic Ocean as the
Svalbard current, where it is now destabilizing the shelf methane
hydrates in the Laptev Sea and on the East Siberian Arctic Shelf.

### 1NC\-\--Self-Determination Contract

#### The United States federal government should 

#### devolve all authority over the exploration and development of the Arctic to an Alaska-Native Tribal Arctic Development Authority composed of all federally recognized Arctic tribes.

#### offer a Title IV self-governance compact and funding agreement to \[xxx\]

#### Self-determination is the [same]{.underline} as the plan [but]{.underline} with native employees and jurisdiction.

**Washburn '19** \[Kevin; April; Regents Professor of Law, University of
New Mexico School of Law; Harvard Law Review, "W HAT THE FUTURE HOLDS:
THE CHANGING LANDSCAPE OF FEDERAL INDIAN POLICY," vol. 130\]

The first major piece of legislation developed under this new approach
was Public Law 93-638, the Indian [[Self-Determination Act]{.mark} of
1975. 11[Under]{.mark} this [law]{.mark}, Indian [tribes could
**contract** to run]{.mark}]{.underline} Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA)
[[services]{.mark} or Indian Health Service (IHS) programs [for]{.mark}
their own [**tribal** members]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Under such
a contract, known as a \"638 contract\" or \"self-determination
contract,\" a [[tribe]{.mark} would [step into]{.mark} the [shoes
of]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the fed]{.mark}eral government and [use tribal
employees to run federal **programs**]{.mark} [with]{.mark}]{.underline}
federal [**[funding]{.mark}**. [Under]{.mark}]{.underline} such a
[**[contract]{.mark}**, a [tribe]{.mark} would [receive]{.mark} the
**federal** [government\'s share of]{.mark}]{.underline} the agency\'s
[[appropriation for]{.mark} this [work]{.mark}]{.underline}, which
primarily covered employee salaries.

Implementing the new policy was difficult at first. The BIA was more
than a century old. Any dramatic change to a government agency with such
an established culture would have been challenging, but the difficulty
of this initiative was exacerbated by the fact that BIA officials who
negotiated tribal self-determination contracts were sometimes
negotiating the end of their own employment, at least at their present
location. This dampened the enthusiasm among some federal employees.
Over the long term, however, even the [**[BIA]{.mark}** has
[embraced]{.mark} the [contracting of]{.mark} **federal
[functions]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} Indian [reservations by]{.mark} Indian
[tribes]{.mark}]{.underline}. (The IHS seems to remain somewhat
resistant, perhaps because the culture in which doctors and healthcare
professionals live inculcates a deep personal responsibility for saving
the world one human being at a time and resists contracting out that
very important mission.)

**"downwards"** to intermediate]{.mark} or local
[polities]{.mark}]{.underline}.67 There are several features of a
devolved system of sovereignty. For example, the centralized polity
retains the formal possibility to overturn devolution legislation
because devolution legislation is regular law.68 J[urisdictional
devolution is thus a practical explanation for what occurs when the
legislature [gives **Indigenous**]{.mark} communities
[jurisdiction]{.mark}]{.underline}, rather than recognizes their
inherent jurisdiction. Under jurisdictional devolution, [the inherent
[right]{.mark} to self-government is [not given **full force**
]{.mark}]{.underline}because the legislature can repeal the granted
jurisdiction without needing to justify it.

Jurisdictional devolution is part of the delegation model, but it
differs notably from other types of delegation. Unlike administrative
devolution, [jurisdictional devolution [devolves **jurisdiction**,
rather]{.mark} than [**limited** program]{.mark} and service
administration, [to Indigenous]{.mark} communities.]{.underline} Instead
of administering another government's programs, genuine local
jurisdiction [[involves **final** decision-making]{.mark} power and the
development]{.underline} of institutions designed by local
communities.69 Of course, the difference requires careful treatment.
Policy-makers must take care to [[ensure]{.mark} that any]{.underline}
jurisdictional devolution to Indigenous communities does not merely
encompass the offloading of responsibility [without [adequate

Resilience refers to the capacity to adapt to change within a
social-ecological system. Diversity and variability contribute to a
system's resilience or adaptive capacity (Gunderson & Hollings 2002).
[[Indigenous **governance**]{.underline}]{.mark} systems incorporate
elements that [[encourage **adaptive** capacity]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Governance [[based on knowing]{.underline}]{.mark} through experience
equips leaders with a wide array of practical life skills and exposures
to many challenges, which [[facilitate **flexible**]{.mark} **and
[adept]{.mark}** [responses]{.mark}]{.underline} when new conditions
present themselves. [**[Profound]{.mark}** local
[knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline} of ecosystems allows rapid
identification of changing conditions---a first [[step toward **quick**
response]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Fundamentally, the cultural and ecological literacy required of
high-context communicative styles of [[Indigenous]{.mark} cultures are
arguably as adaptive, if not [more]{.mark} quickly [**adaptive**,
than]{.mark} low-context [West]{.mark}]{.underline}ern cultures that may
be slower to change in the face of indisputable evidence. Climate change
and its effects on animals such as caribou and polar bears provide
examples where communities have identified reliable monitoring methods
(e.g., hunters' and land users' reports of conditions) and are able to
take measures to respond to those changes (such as the Yellowknives Dene
deciding not to undertake a Fall 2009 community caribou hunt, see above,
p. 16). Meanwhile, [**[fed]{.mark}**eral governments continue to
[struggle to craft]{.mark} wide-ranging [laws]{.mark}]{.underline} and
regulations to address climate-change issues and promote more
ecologically sustainable lifeways among their citizens.

Merit-based, [**[situational leadership]{.mark}** models that
[characterize Indigenous governance]{.mark}]{.underline} systems in the
Arctic help [[ensure]{.underline}]{.mark} that decision-makers have the
necessary insights and experience, as well as the improvisational
[[skills to cope with changing conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}---and
that they can be replaced when different skills, wisdom, and experience
are needed. Localized situational [[leadership is
**multifunctional**]{.mark} and plastic, in [**contrast** to
West]{.mark}]{.underline}ern governance systems, which tend toward
centralization and greater rigidity and their attendant problems (Scott
1998). The [[scale]{.underline}]{.mark} of governance itself, being
localized, [[provides **adaptability**]{.underline}]{.mark} lacking in

On the other hand, the validity of Bryant's ensuing federal conviction
rests upon a contrary view of tribal sovereignty. Congress ordinarily
lacks authority to enact a general federal criminal law proscribing
domestic abuse. See United States v. Morrison, 529 U. S. 598, 610-613,
120 S. Ct. 1740, 146 L. Ed. 2d 658 (2000). But, the Court suggests,
Congress must intervene on reservations to ensure that \[\*\*\*\*30\]
prolific domestic abusers receive sufficient punishment. See ante, at
\_\_\_ - \_\_\_, 195 L. Ed. 2d, at 323-324. The Court does not explain
where Congress' \[\*\*1968\] power to act comes from, but our precedents
leave no doubt on this score. Congress could make Bryant's domestic
assaults a federal crime subject to federal prosecution only because our

[[tribal **sovereignty**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Wheeler, supra, at 319,

[[Congress can second-guess]{.mark} how [tribes]{.mark}]{.underline}
prosecute domestic abuse perpetrated by Indians against other Indians on
Indian land [[by virtue of]{.mark} its "[plenary

[**[Devolution]{.mark}** legislation [creates]{.mark} a [**one-way**

**costly**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus, a paradox is created: there is

**[impracticality]{.mark}** of doing so [makes it rare that]{.mark} such
legislation [is]{.mark} ever **[overturned]{.mark}**. T]{.underline}his
means that [jurisdictional [devolution]{.mark} can **[broaden]{.mark}**
and deepen Indigenous **[jurisdiction]{.mark}**, thus [speeding
up]{.mark} the process of [recognition]{.mark}]{.underline} of inherent
self-government rights. This recognition might be asserted through
formal legislation or through negotiated nation-to-nation treaties.
Recall that Indigenous Nations do not need formal recognition to have an
inherent right, but formal recognition allows for easier exercise of
that inherent right in Canada's federalist system.

I argue that [jurisdictional [devolution is difficult to
**reverse**]{.mark} once implemented]{.underline}, which leads to
entrenchment of the devolved jurisdiction. Conceiving jurisdictional
devolution as an interim arrangement on the road to self-government is
helpful. Jurisdictional entrenchme[nt creates **momentum** towards
Indigenous **self-gov**ernment for two reasons]{.underline}. First, the
jurisdiction, once recognized, i[s **[unlikely]{.mark}** to be [repealed
for]{.mark} practical and [**constitutional**
reasons]{.mark}]{.underline}. Second, in the meantime, Indigenous
communities will develop capacity and local institutions to exercise
that jurisdiction (which in turn practically entrenches the
jurisdiction). A comparative study of Scottish devolution and devolution
to Canada's territories supports this argument.

**[[after]{.underline}]{.mark}** its **[[passage, it is hotly debated in

The Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) provides a similar example.16
Passed in 1970, it comprehensively regulated credit reporting. Since
then, [[Congress]{.mark} has [amended]{.mark} it dozens of times, and
[regulators]{.mark} have [made]{.mark} countless [alterations]{.mark}

Meanwhile, as regulatory theory predicts, credit reporting has become a
three-horse race.19 A few slow-to-innovate firms have captured and
maintained dominance thanks partially to the costs and barriers to entry

In parallel to business competition around privacy choice of law,
[[states]{.mark} would [compete]{.mark} with one another to provide the
most felicitous environment [for]{.mark}]{.underline} consumers and
[[businesses]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Some]{.mark} states would [choose
more protection]{.mark},]{.underline} seeking the rules businesses would
choose to please privacy-conscious consumers. [Others might choose
less]{.underline} protection, betting that consumers prefer goods other
than information control, such as free, convenient, highly interactive,
and custom services.

Importantly, [this]{.underline} mechanism [would allow
[companies]{.mark} to [opt in]{.mark}]{.underline} to various privacy
regimes [based on the type of service they offer, [enabling]{.mark} a
degree of [fine-tuning appropriate for different industries]{.mark} and
different activities [that no alt]{.mark}ernative [would]{.mark} likely
[offer]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[This]{.mark} would]{.underline} not only
[result in the [experimentation]{.mark} and competition of
federalism]{.underline} [but also enable multiple
overlapping]{.underline} privacy-regulation [regimes, [avoid]{.mark}ing
[the "one-size-doesn't-fit-all" problem]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[While experimentation continued, [state policies would]{.mark} probably
rationalize and [converge over time]{.mark}]{.underline}. [There are
institutions dedicated to this, such as [the]{.mark}
**[U]{.mark}**niform **[L]{.mark}**aw **[C]{.mark}**ommission, which is
at its best when it [harmonizes]{.mark} existing [laws]{.mark} based on
states' experience.]{.underline}24

It is well within the federal commerce power to regulate state
enforcement of choice-of-law provisions, because states may use them to
limit interjurisdictional competition. Controlling that is precisely
what the commerce power is for. Utah's recent Social Media Regulation
Act25 barred enforcement of choice-of-law provisions, an effort to
regulate nationally from a state capital. Federally backing contractual
choice-of-law selections would curtail this growing problem.

At the same time, what our proposed protections for choice-of-law rules
do is not much different from what contracts already routinely do and
courts enforce in many industries. Contracting parties often specify the
governing state's law and negotiate for the law that best suits their
collective needs.

Indeed, [sophisticated business contracts]{.underline} increasingly
include choice-of-law clauses that state the law that the parties wish
to govern their relationship. [In addition to settling
uncertainty]{.underline}, these clauses might enable the contracting
parties to circumvent those states' laws they deem to be undesirable.26

This practice is not only business-to-business. Consumers regularly
enter into contracts that include choice-of-law clauses---including
regarding privacy law. Credit card agreements, stock and mutual fund
investment terms, consumer-product warranties, and insurance contracts,
among many other legal agreements, routinely [specify the relevant state
law that will govern]{.underline}.

[In these situations, [the]{.mark}]{.underline} insurance
[[company]{.underline}]{.mark}, manufacturer, or mutual fund
**[[has]{.mark} effectively [chosen the law]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The
consumer participates in this choice only to the same extent that she
participates in any choices related to mass-produced products and
services, that is, by deciding whether to buy the product or service.27

**[[Allowing]{.mark} contracting [parties to create their own legal
certainty]{.mark}]{.underline}** by contract would likely rankle states.
Indeed, "we might expect governments to respond with hostility to the
enforcement of choice-of-law clauses. In fact, however, the courts
usually do enforce choice-of-law clauses."28 With some states trying to
regulate nationally and some effectively doing so, the choice the states
collectively face is having a role in privacy regulation or no role at
all. Competition is better for them than exclusion from the field or
minimization of their role through federal preemption of state privacy
law. This proposal thus advocates simple federal legislation that
preserves firms' ability to make binding choice-of-law decisions and
states' ability to retain a say in the country's privacy-governance
regime.

Although tribes are sovereign nations, they are economically weak
compared to state and local governments and private sector federal
contractors. Most Native American [[tribes]{.mark} are [virtually
dependent]{.mark} [upon]{.mark} federal [contracts]{.mark} and grants
[for]{.mark} their [very existence]{.mark}]{.underline}. 159 Unlike
states and municipal governments, tribes have little economic base to
support their governments. The average income of Native American workers
living on or near reservations is \$ 7,000 per year. 160 In 1989, 47.3
percent of families living on reservations or trust land lived below the
poverty level, compared to 11.5 percent of families nationwide. 161 The
median family income on reservations and trust lands was \$ 13,489,
compared to \$ 34,213 nationwide. 162 The United States government\'s
estimate of the unemployment rate for Native Americans is 45 percent,
but the actual rate is probably much higher. 163 \[\*279\]

Tribal businesses and income-generating ventures represent efforts by
tribes to free themselves from government funding and thereby attain
\"true sovereignty.\" 164 To the extent that [[tribes \"profit\"
from]{.mark} [income derived through]{.mark} federal [contracts]{.mark},
such [profit accrues to]{.mark} the [commonwealth]{.mark} of the tribe
[as]{.mark} a [nation to operate]{.mark} its government [and provide
services]{.mark}]{.underline} to its citizens. As one commentator put
it, \"Indian economic development may be less about creating wealth than
it is about creating the conditions for political power in the context
of socially responsible choices for the continued existence and cohesion
of the Indian nation.\" 165 Management of employment relations within
tribally owned and operated businesses is truly an exercise of tribal
sovereignty. 166

Moreover, policy dictates that Congress\' exclusion of tribes from
antidiscrimination actions cannot be deemed a protection that tribes can
waive by entering into a contract with the government or a prime
government contractor. 239 As stated previously, most tribes are
dependent \[\*290\] on federal funding; they have no alternative source
of income. 240 [[Because of]{.mark} tribes\' [dependency on]{.mark}
federal [funding for]{.mark}]{.underline} their [[survival]{.mark}, they
[must enter into federal contracts]{.mark} and have little or no [power
to bargain over the]{.mark}]{.underline} terms of the contracts. In that
regard, federal [[contracts]{.mark} are [akin to adhesion
contracts]{.mark}]{.underline}. 241 Thus, in order to avoid any
possibility of having to defend a discrimination action under Executive
Order No. 11,246 (from which they are otherwise immune by statute),
tribes would be forced to forego participation in federal contracts. The
alternative is to incur significant administrative costs to comply with
the Order and to be subjected to the possibility of incurring even
greater costs in defending agency actions to enforce compliance. Tribal
treasuries can ill afford such costs. The OFCCP\'s placement of tribes
in such a position flouts congressional policy promoting tribal
self-determination and self-sufficiency.

Using these mechanisms, Tribal [[Nations]{.mark} have [reassumed]{.mark}

The Indian **[[Self-Determination]{.underline}]{.mark}** and Education
Assistance Act 1 (ISDEAA) requires the federal government to enter into
a \"self-determination\" contract with any Native American tribe 2 that
requests one. A self-determination contract gives the tribe funding for
programs and allows it to provide services previously administered by
the federal government. Such a [[contract gives]{.mark} the
**[tribe]{.mark}** the [amount that]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[government would have spent to **plan**]{.mark}, conduct, [and
administer]{.mark} the [program]{.mark}]{.underline} itself. 3 In
addition, the [**[fed]{.mark}**eral government [must provide]{.mark} the
tribe [funding for \"**contract** support costs,\"]{.mark}]{.underline}
the additional transaction costs incurred by a Native American tribe
endeavoring to plan, conduct, and administer its own programs without
the government\'s help. 4 Contract support costs can be either start-up
costs in the case of initial contracts, or continuous costs of running a
program in the case of ongoing contracts.

Kincaid distinguishes devolution from similar but subtly different
transformations such as "decentralization," "delegation," and
"deregulation." [[**Devolution** connotes]{.mark} a [**surrender**
of]{.mark} a [function by]{.mark} a [superior gov]{.mark}ernment [to a
**subordinate** government]{.mark} that is generally [**complete**,
**permanent**, and of]{.mark} "[constitutional
magnitude]{.mark}]{.underline}." As such, strictly speaking it cannot
occur between the federal government and the states under the U.S.
Constitution. Since our federal system is one of dual sovereignty, in
which the federal government and the states each have constitutionally
specified powers, the federal government lacks the authority to devolve
responsibilities. Kincaid concludes that what is currently referred to
as devolution is more accurately called "restoration" or "rebalancing"
of powers between the federal government and the states to conform more
closely to what the authors of the Constitution had in mind. To
underscore the degree of imbalance, he notes that, while the
Constitution specifies only four criminal offenses punishable by the
federal government, today it can punish individuals for more than 3,000
different felonies

#### There is no room for the federal government, post devolution.

[**[Devolution]{.mark}** can be [defined as]{.mark} a [transfer
of]{.mark} specific [powers]{.mark} or functions [from]{.mark} a
[**superior** government to]{.mark} a [**subordinate**
government]{.mark}]{.underline}. The transfer is of constitutional
magnitude even if not effected through a written constitution; it is
ordinarily intended to be permanent; it [[surrenders **all**]{.mark} the
[powers associated]{.mark} [with]{.mark} the [devolved functions]{.mark}
(namely, [**political**, **legislative**, **administrative**, and
**fiscal**]{.mark}]{.underline}); and it leaves the functional field
vacant for occupancy by subordinate governments. Devolution occurs in
the context of vertical intergovernmental relations. Hence, devolution
can occur within the British parliamentary system and can also be said
to occur within the fifty American states where, constitutionally, local
governments are creatures of their state, but it cannot occur between
the federal government and the states without constitutional change.

[[Tribal governments are **sovereign** but have been brought
in]{.mark}to the US [legal universe through]{.mark} various US
**[legislation]{.mark}**]{.underline} and court decisions. Given the
complexities of the space they occupy, working with a variety of US
agencies is necessary. Despite long-held grievances with these US
government entities, it is increasingly clear that working closely with
them provides a pathway toward maintaining sovereignty and helping
Tribal nations thrive.

We will explore complex agency-based relationships below, along with the
many opportunities that tribal--state compacts can present and solutions
for overcoming the many obstacles that continue to stand in the way.

Background of Tribal Government Relationships

It is [established within the US **Constitution**, specifically Article
I, Section 8, that [Congress has]{.mark} the
[ability]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to regulate **commerce** \"with]{.mark}
the Indian [tribes]{.mark}.\" [Through]{.mark} additional [treaties,
court cases, and]{.mark} evolving federal [Indian
**policy**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} Tribal and federal governments
established a unique relationship that, according to the Supreme Court
case Cherokee Nation v. Georgia, was thought to reflect \"that of a ward
to his guardian.\" The federal government\'s jurisdiction was clarified
in the case Worcester v. Georgia, which verified that Tribes should be
protected against interference at the state level.

Currently, the Federal Bar Association explains that the federal
government \"has special obligations to protect tribal lands and
resources, defend tribal rights to self-government, and provide services
necessary for tribal survival.\" From the Tribal perspective, however,
it is vital to maintain a careful balance between maintaining
sovereignty and securing the resources and relationships needed for
these nations to thrive.

#### Tribes are self-governing\-\--all their actions are their own.

Bar Association, "Understanding Tribal Sovereignty,"
https://www.fedbar.org/blog/understanding-tribal-sovereignty/\]

The history of Indian tribes in America necessarily involves studying
the continuous struggles over the boundaries of tribal sovereignty,
tribal jurisdiction, and tribal property rights. [[Although tribes exist
as]{.mark} [extra-constitutional, self-governing entities, they
are]{.mark} also [subject to]{.mark} the [plenary
power]{.mark}]{.underline} of the U.S. and are regarded as "domestic
dependent nations" under federal law.

The U.S. [[S]{.mark}upreme [C]{.mark}ourt has [acknowledged]{.mark} that
tribal [governments are]{.mark} the [oldest
sovereigns]{.mark}]{.underline} on the continent---Native American
sovereignty predates the sovereignty of the U.S.---and as such, tribes
and tribal people maintain some degree of control, though a diminished
measure of sovereignty to be sure. Tribal sovereignty [[includes]{.mark}
the [right to govern]{.mark} one's [community]{.mark}]{.underline}, the
ability to preserve one's culture, and the right to control one's own
economy.

The sovereignty status (tribal sovereignty encompassing Native American
military, social, and economic development) of Indian nations still
remains today. As sovereign entities, Indian [[nations]{.mark} are
[guaranteed]{.mark} the [power]{.mark} and/or right [to
determine]{.mark} their form of [government]{.mark}, define
[citizenship]{.mark}, [make and enforce]{.mark} [laws]{.mark} through
their own police force and courts, collect taxes, [and regulate property
use]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet the fight to preserve tribal sovereignty
and treaty rights has long been at the forefront of the Native American
civil rights struggle.

### Perm Do CP\-\--AT: Devolution Means Federal\-\--2NC

#### Despite having been delegated authority by Congress, tribes exercise their own authority in the execution.

**Supreme Court '04** \[---; April 19; opinion of the Court; Supreme
Court of the United States, \*United States v. Lara\*, 541 U.S. 193 (No.
03-107), https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/03-107\]

After respondent Lara, an Indian who is not a member of the Spirit Lake
Tribe (Tribe), ignored the Tribe's order excluding him from its
reservation, he struck one of the federal officers arresting him. [[He
pleaded **guilty** in **Tribal** Court]{.underline}]{.mark} to the crime
of violence to a policeman. The Federal Government then charged him with
the federal crime of assaulting a federal officer. Lara claimed that,
because key elements of that crime mirrored elements of his tribal
crime, he was protected by the Double Jeopardy Clause. The Government
countered that the Clause does not bar successive prosecutions by
separate sovereigns, and that this "dual sovereignty" doctrine
determined the outcome. The Government noted that this Court has held
that a tribe acts as a separate sovereign in prosecuting its own
members, United States v. Wheeler, 435 U. S. 313, 318, 322--323; that,
after this Court ruled that a tribe lacks sovereign authority to
prosecute nonmember Indians, see Duro v. Reina, 495 U. S. 676, 679,
[[Congress]{.mark} specifically [authorized]{.mark} such
**[prosecutions]{.mark}**]{.underline}; and that, because this statute
enlarges the tribes' self-government powers to include "the inherent
power of Indian tribes ... to exercise criminal jurisdiction over all
Indians," 25 U. S. C. §1301(2), the [[Tribe]{.mark} here had [exercised
**its** own tribal **authority**, not **delegated federal
authority**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Accepting this argument, the
Magistrate Judge rejected Lara's double jeopardy claim. The en banc
Eighth Circuit reversed, holding that the "dual sovereignty" doctrine
did not apply because the Tribal Court was exercising a federal
prosecutorial power, and, thus, the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the
second prosecution.

#### Delegation of authority and mandates still retain tribal authority.

The [[term **devolution**]{.mark} can be [defined to mean]{.mark} the
[**transference** of **power** and **authority**]{.mark}]{.underline}
over jurisdictions from a higher, central level or order of government
to other levels or orders of government. When it occurs in the form of
transferring broad powers over specific territory to self-governing
units, it gives effect to sovereignty and self-government. But it may
also take the form of vertical transfers of discrete powers over
specific jurisdictions, or even over subcomponents of specific
jurisdictions (e.g. transferring authority over particular resources or
functional areas). Such [[transferred power may be]{.mark} in respect to
[**any possible** combination of]{.mark} **administrative**, political,
financial, **functional** and **policy** [domains]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Within the system of federalism and the legal structure common to all
Australians, 'devolution' is arguably a more appropriate term than
'decentralisation' in talking about developing Indigenous jurisdictional
authority as an aspect of local self-determination.

Decentralisation is the delegation of responsibility to subordinate
dispersed units of hierarchical jurisdiction which have primary
accountability upwards to their superiors in the hierarchy
(International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) 2001: 2). It
may provide more local administrative and management discretion, but
financial control, policy independence and decision-making power are not
necessarily transferred or more discretionary (Whiteford 2001: 112). For
example, transferring welfare services from a central government
department to a community welfare office which is staffed by government
officers or their local agents, and which is directed by central
government policy and program objectives, is an example of
decentralisation. In decentralisation, top-level decision-making
processes are dispersed throughout the system of government (Arbib
1984); but jurisdictional authority is not transferred.

The term [**[devolution]{.mark}**, on the other hand, describes cases
where the [**transfer** of responsibilities
coincides]{.mark}]{.underline} [[with]{.mark} the [transfer of **power**
and **capacity** to legitimate]{.mark}]{.underline}, representative
[[institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}. Devolution can
[[give]{.underline}]{.mark} a practical [[form to]{.mark} corporate or
geographic [**autonomy**, and]{.mark} to the [possibility of]{.mark}
'internal **[self-government']{.mark}**]{.underline} (Arthur 2001: 2).
It involves the [[creation of]{.mark} relatively [**autonomous** realms
of **authority**, responsibility and]{.mark} [entitlement]{.mark},
together [with accountability]{.mark}]{.underline} to local
constituents. For example, transferring authority for welfare policy and
program design, administration and implementation (either in full or in
part) to a community or regional institution which is representative of
**[[community]{.underline}]{.mark}** or regional residents, and is able
to [[exercise]{.mark} a [degree of **prerogative**]{.mark}]{.underline}
in these areas, is an example of jurisdictional devolution (see also
Whiteford 2001: 112).

to]{.mark} their **[environment]{.mark}**]{.underline} as well as
challenges in the recognition of their knowledge (ibid: 114). Indigenous

The [[**Arctic** stands at]{.mark} the [**forefront** of]{.mark} our
**[global climate crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Experiencing warming at
more than twice the rate of the rest of the planet, the Arctic faces
dramatic transformations as ancient ice melts, permafrost thaws, and
ecosystems undergo upheaval. These changes lead to a cascade of
challenges, from coastal erosion to shifting wildlife habitats,
threatening both natural landscapes and the communities that depend on
them. [[In response to]{.mark} these pressing [**challenges**,
integrating Indigenous]{.mark}]{.underline} [[knowledge into
nature-based solutions]{.mark} (**NbS**) [presents]{.mark} a

**[[resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

NbS is a recently emerging term for actions to leverage the power of
ecosystems to protect people, optimize infrastructure, and ensure a
stable and biodiverse future. These natural (climate) solutions include
conservation efforts, habitat restoration, water resource management,
and green infrastructure initiatives.1) By harnessing natural
ecosystems, NbS can provide up to 37 percent of the mitigation needed by
2030 to achieve the targets of the Paris Agreement and give several
benefits for climate adaptation and biodiversity enhancement.2) Informed
and well-structured NbS [[can reduce **climate change**]{.mark} impacts

Arctic **[[permafrost]{.underline}]{.mark}** - ground that has been
frozen for many thousands of years - [[is]{.mark} **now
[thawing]{.mark}**]{.underline} because of global climate change,
[[and]{.mark} the [results could be **disastrous**]{.mark}]{.underline}
and **[irreversible]{.underline}**.

\"The [[release of]{.mark} **greenhouse [gases]{.mark}** resulting
[from]{.mark} thawing Arctic [permafrost]{.mark} could [have
**catastrophic**]{.mark} global [consequences]{.mark}]{.underline},\"
said Dr. Max Holmes, a Senior Scientist at the Woods Hole Research
Center (WHRC) who has been advising State Department officials on the
problem.

Thawing permafrost releases greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide and
methane) into the atmosphere, which accelerates climate change, which in
turn causes more thawing of the permafrost. This [[potentially
**unstoppable**]{.mark} and self-reinforcing cycle could
[constitute]{.mark} a [calamitous \"**tipping
point**]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}

WHRC scientists have counseled the [[State Department]{.mark} on
policies that [could **control**]{.mark} this
[problem]{.mark}]{.underline}, including [[reducing global]{.mark}
carbon [**emissions**]{.mark} from **fossil fuel** use [and
**deforestation**]{.mark}, and [limiting]{.mark}]{.underline} emissions
of \"**[[black carbon]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\" sooty particles that
darken snow and ice and hasten Arctic warming.

\"Despite the importance and urgency of this problem, until now it has
received little attention from policymakers,\" said Dr. Sue Natali,
another WHRC scientist. A study published earlier this year by Dr.
Natali and WHRC scientists estimated that greenhouse gases released from
thawing permafrost could make it much more difficult to meet the widely
held goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius.

\"The [[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [must lead]{.mark} a
[**large-scale** effort to find]{.mark} the [tipping
**point**]{.mark}]{.underline} - at what level of warming will the cycle
of warming and permafrost thawing become impossible to stop,\" said Dr.
Holmes. \"The [**[real]{.mark}** and **imminent** [threat posed

The **[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** region, a former geopolitical
margin of the northernmost geographical periphery, seems to be
[[in]{.mark} a [state of]{.mark} constant
**[transformation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as we discussed at the 2017
Arctic Yearbook. Yet the traditions, practices and [[knowledge
of]{.mark} Arctic [peoples]{.mark} have [carried on **for
centuries**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Among recent significant changes to
the region are, on the one hand, increased globalization due to the
impacts of climate change, global economics, and increasing scientific
interests worldwide; and on the other, the pause of multilateral
(pan-Arctic) cooperation at the Arctic Council due to the Russian
invasion of Ukraine, although, despite policy-makers and mainstream
scholars often argue about it, there have been no armed conflicts in the
Arctic between states since the Cod Wars in the 1970s.

Nevertheless, two other recent transformations are important to
consider: Firstly, the increasing self-determination of Arctic
Indigenous Peoples in North America and the European Arctic based on
devolution, Indigenous Knowledge and circumpolar cooperation by
Indigenous Peoples. In particular, the [[introduction of

these types of international and regional debates have historically been

[[We face]{.mark} a [brutal truth: climate **collapse**]{.mark},
inescapable [pollution]{.mark}, ecosystem [degradation and]{.mark}
geopolitical [instability]{.mark}]{.underline} are converging in ways
that threaten not only the biosphere, but the very foundations of the
international community established after the Second World War.

This [[system]{.underline}]{.mark}, founded on cooperation, peace, and
collective security, has been profoundly [[undermined by **ecological**
crises]{.underline}]{.mark} fueled by economic greed, with the Arctic
standing as a visible and urgent epicentre.

We can [[no longer afford to underestimate]{.mark} the [**threats**
facing]{.mark}]{.underline} this strategic and [[**vulnerable**
region]{.underline}]{.mark}. Nor can we continue the extractive,
paternalistic models of scientific research that have long excluded
Indigenous voices and appropriated their knowledge without reciprocity.

Science, technology and [[innovation]{.mark} are **[never
neutral]{.mark}**---they are [shaped by]{.mark} social, political and
cultural [context]{.mark}]{.underline}s -- and must be held accountable
to justice.

[[**Inuit** knowledge must not only shape]{.mark} the [**decisions**
that]{.mark} directly [affect]{.mark} Northern [territories but
also]{.mark} inform [global **ecological
transitions**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

We [[call on]{.mark} all
[stakeholders]{.mark}]{.underline}---researchers, communities,
decision-makers and allies---[[to reflect on]{.underline}]{.mark} their
[[**role** in promoting]{.mark} environmental [justice for]{.mark} the
[Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is not a distant issue: it is a
[[**global** emergency]{.mark} that [demands **concrete

The [[**inability** of]{.mark} individual [national
**gov**]{.mark}ernment[**s** to]{.mark} adequately [**address**]{.mark}
issues like **[climate change]{.mark}**]{.underline} (not least

the **[s]{.mark}**ustainable **[d]{.mark}**evelopment **[g]{.mark}oals**
[for]{.mark}]{.underline} their [[country, never mind]{.mark} the
[world, points to]{.mark} the [need for]{.mark} a
**[devolution]{.mark}** of power [to include]{.mark} other
**[stakeholders]{.mark}**]{.underline} and go beyond
**[nation-to-nation]{.underline}** negotiations. Solving these complex
problems requires a diverse array of political actors, authorities,
institutions, nations, movements, and associations that go beyond
territorial borders. While much Arctic problem solving still occurs at
the national level, today's [**[challenges]{.mark}** have
[open]{.mark}ed the global policy [agenda to **subnational** actors,
as]{.mark} the [rapid]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[environmental]{.underline}**, economic, and social [[changes]{.mark}
happening on the ground today have [renewed]{.mark} a [**desire** to
]{.mark}]{.underline}collaborate across sub-national regions to address
challenges quickly and locally. Since the 1970s, there has been a
devolution of power to local authority through domestic political
decentralization, leading to the creation of Nunavut in Canada and home
rule (1979) and Self Government in Greenland since 2009. This
**[[transfer]{.underline}]{.mark}** of authority to empower localities
not only enabled local governments and political leaders to govern
policy in their domestic constituencies---it also [[emboldened]{.mark}
their [participation in **internal fora**]{.mark}]{.underline} like
Arctic Frontiers, **[Arctic Circle]{.underline}**, and the Northern
Forum. In these settings, subnational [[actors]{.underline}]{.mark} have
[[embraced]{.mark} their internationalization **and [cross-border
]{.mark}**[engagement]{.mark}]{.underline}, stressing their position on
the front line of climate tipping points, while using their newfound
national and international political legitimacy to act in the Arctic's
foreign relations.

Sub-national [[stakeholders]{.mark} already [can]{.mark} and are
[tak]{.mark}ing [steps to change]{.mark} the [**paradigm**,
]{.mark}]{.underline}even if they are [[in]{.underline}]{.mark}
countries, such as the [**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates, [that
are]{.mark} more **[reluctant]{.mark}**]{.underline} to take national
climate action. The Trump [[administration's refusal to take climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark} and sustainable development
[[seriously]{.mark} is an [important push **factor** to consider]{.mark}
a [new Arctic **order** that privileges subnational]{.mark}]{.underline}
involvement. But there are equally important pull factors that show why
the inclusion of subnational actors in decision-making is vital to the
future viability of an effective Arctic Council. [[By elevating]{.mark}
their **[status]{.mark}**]{.underline} as full participants and
stakeholders in meetings and empowering them to implement regional
governance initiatives[, [progress]{.mark} on climate change [could be
maintained despite]{.mark} a [lack of
**commitment**]{.mark}]{.underline} from national governments. While
sub-national actors may not have as many resources at their disposal as
federal governments, because of their limited geographic scope, states,
territories, and regional administrations can target action to rapidly
address tangible, context-specific challenges across different parts of
subnational government. It must also be noted that [[local action
in]{.mark} the [Arctic holds]{.mark} the [**most promise** to
change]{.mark} the energy [paradigm,]{.mark}]{.underline} [[as]{.mark}
sub-national [entities]{.mark} can [craft]{.mark} and implement
**greenhouse** [gas]{.mark} reducing [policies]{.mark}]{.underline}
targeted at Arctic communities. A re-[[imagining]{.mark} of the Arctic
order would [require national governments]{.mark}]{.underline} and the
Arctic Council [[to]{.mark} cooperate with and [support **sub-national**
governments]{.mark}]{.underline}, who already have control over
implementation of projects, policies, and regulations. Transportation,
existing building retrofits, waste management, water, energy supply,
outdoor lighting, planning and urban land use, and food and agriculture
are just a few of the jurisdictions sub-national actors can change to
increase climate resilience, environmental sustainability, and social
equity.

In addition, because of more flexible governance structures,
sub-national leaders who confront budget and funding constraints that
are likely to persist in the coming decades, have the leeway to devise
creative responses. Creativity is enabled by the ability of local
governments to champion change, engage the public, enact legislation,
implement new programs, and create partnerships more quickly and in more
targeted ways. [[Sub-national]{.mark} governments are also [flexible
enough to work]{.mark} closely [with]{.mark} the **[private]{.mark}**
sector]{.underline}, generating more opportunities for private companies
to become involved in climate mitigation. By contrast,
[[national]{.mark}ly-driven financing [proposals]{.mark}]{.underline} to
fund projects related to Paris implementation or the sustainable
development goals [[in]{.mark} the **[Arctic]{.mark}** can be [hampered
by **politics**]{.mark} and [require]{.mark} a much [longer **time
frame**]{.mark}]{.underline} to build the broad support necessary for
passage. For instance, a proposal for a national infrastructure bank by
Senator John Kerry, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson, and Senator Mark
Warner, and a similar idea proposed by President Obama's administration,
were stifled by partisanship in Washington. While the idea for an
infrastructure or green bank never came to fruition at the national
level, stakeholders in Alaska have been moving forward in establishing a
green bank for the state---despite, or perhaps as a reaction to, the
state's budget deficit. The [[**flexibility** of]{.mark} a
[state]{.mark}]{.underline}, territory, republic, or county [[to
address]{.mark} fiscal [**concerns** is critical for
**facilitating**]{.mark} the necessary [system]{.mark} shift [to
**increase**]{.mark} climate [**resilience**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Warming\-\--Methane Hydrates\-\--2NC

#### Warming causes methane hydrates in the Arctic to melt\-\--extinction.

**Jamail '17** \[Dahr; March 23; BA Speech Communications, Texas A&M

zamin

The [[methane **hydrate**]{.mark} situation has, for years now, been
[referred to as]{.mark} the [Arctic Methane **Time
Bomb**]{.mark},]{.underline} and as been studied intensely.

A [2010 scientific analysis led by the **UK's Met Office**]{.underline},
published in the [**journal Review** of Geophysics]{.underline}, states
clearly that the **[[time scale]{.underline}]{.mark}** for the release
of methane in the Arctic would be "[[much
**shorter**]{.underline}]{.mark} for hydrates below shallow waters, such
as in the Arctic Ocean," adding that "significant [[increases
in]{.underline}]{.mark} methane emissions are likely, and
[[**catastrophic** emissions]{.mark} cannot be ruled out.... The [risk
of]{.mark}]{.underline} rapid increase in \[methane\] [[emissions is
real."]{.underline}]{.mark}

A 2011 study of the Eastern Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS), [conducted by
more than **20 Arctic** experts and]{.underline} published in the
Proceedings of the Russian Academy of Sciences, concluded that the shelf
was already a powerful supplier of methane to the atmosphere. The
conclusion of this study stated that the methane concentration in the
atmosphere was at levels capable of causing "a considerable and even
catastrophic warming on the Earth."

[[Scientists]{.mark} have been [warning]{.mark} us [for]{.mark} a number
of [**years** about]{.mark} the [**dire** consequences of **methane
hydrates** in]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark}, and how the [methane]{.mark}
being [released poses]{.mark} a potentially [**disastrous** threat
to]{.mark} the [planet]{.mark}]{.underline}. There has even been a study
showing that methane released in the Arctic could trigger "catastrophic
climate change" that would cost the global economy \$60 trillion.

Of course, that level of [planetary **[heating]{.mark}** would likely
[**extinguish** most **life** on]{.mark} the
**[planet]{.mark}**]{.underline}, so whatever the economic costs might
be would be irrelevant.

#### Methane hydrates are the greatest risk.

zamin

The [[cause for]{.mark} the end Permian **[mass extinction]{.mark}**,
the [**greatest** challenge]{.mark} life [on Earth]{.mark}]{.underline}
faced in its geologic history, is still hotly debated by scientists. The
most significant marker of this event is the negative 13C shift and
rebound recorded in marine carbonates with a duration ranging from 2000
to 19 000 years depending on localities and sedimentation rates. Leading
[[causes]{.underline}]{.mark} for the event [[are]{.mark} Siberian trap
volcanism and the [**emission** of greenhouse **gases** with]{.mark}
consequent global [warming]{.mark}]{.underline}. Measurements of gases
vaulted in calcite of end Permian brachiopods and whole rock document
significant differences in normal atmospheric equilibrium concentration
in gases between modern and end Permian seawaters. The gas composition
of the end Permian brachiopod-inclusions reflects dramatically higher
seawater carbon dioxide and methane contents leading upto the biotic
event. Initial global warming of 8--11◦C sourced by isotopically light
carbon dioxide from volcanic emissions triggered the release of
isotopically lighter methane from permafrost and shelf sediment methane
hydrates. Consequently, the huge quantities of methane emitted into the
atmosphere and the oceans accelerated global warming and marked the
negative 13C spike observed in marine carbonates, documenting the onset
of the mass extinction period. The rapidity of the methane hydrate
emission lasting from several years to thousands of years was tempered
by the equally rapid oxidation of the atmospheric and oceanic methane
that gradually reduced its warming potential but not before global
warming had reached levels lethal to most life on land and in the
oceans. Based on measurements of gases trapped in biogenic and abiogenic
calcite, the [[release of **methane**]{.underline}]{.mark} (of ∼3--14%
of total C stored) from permafrost and shelf sediment methane hydrate is
[[deemed]{.underline}]{.mark} the ultimate [[**source** and **cause**
for]{.mark} the [**dramatic** life-changing]{.mark} global
[warming]{.mark}]{.underline} (GMAT \> 34◦C) and oceanic negative-carbon
isotope excursion observed at the end Permian. Global [[warming]{.mark}
triggered [by]{.mark}]{.underline} the massive release of
[**[carbon]{.mark}** dioxide [may be **catastrophic**, but]{.mark} the
release of [methane from **hydrate** may be
**apocalyptic**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The end Permian [[holds]{.mark} an
[important lesson]{.mark} for **humanity** [regarding]{.mark} the
**[issue]{.mark}**]{.underline} it faces today with greenhouse gas
emissions, global warming, and climate change.

#### Methane release is empirically deadly and 86x more than carbon.

cooling**]{.mark} albedo. [Methane **emissions**]{.mark}]{.underline}
from warming peat rich wetlands. Methane an CO2 emissions permafrost

​​​​​​​​​​​​​​This is the [[greatest]{.mark} **single [danger]{.mark}** [from]{.mark}
global [warming to]{.mark} the **[survival of humanity]{.mark}** and
[also]{.mark} the [survival of]{.mark} potentially almost [**all life**
on]{.mark} the [planet]{.mark}]{.underline}. With all climate and ocean
indicators record high and accelerating (2023) humanity and [[life are
in **extreme peril**]{.underline}]{.mark} from runaway.

​​​​A global heating feedback event wiping almost most life we know is
possible- because it happened 250 million years ago in the End Permian
extinction event and 55 million years ago with the Paleocene-Eocene
thermal maximum (PETM). Current research confirms both of these
extinction events were driven by very large emissions of carbon to the
atmosphere.

​​The PETM is the closest distant past analog to our GHG emissions global
warming situation today. Research published October 2013 by Morgan
Schaller and James Wright leads to their definite finding that following
a doubling in carbon dioxide levels, the surface of the ocean turned
acidic over a period of weeks or months and global temperatures rose by
5 degrees centigrade -- all in the space of about 13 years. Scientists
had previously thought this process happened over 10,000 years.

These mass extinction events involve the emission of an enormous
emission of carbon as CO2 and methane. [[In]{.mark} the [Arctic several
times]{.mark} atmospheric **[methane]{.mark}** is [stored frozen in
**permafrost** and]{.mark} sub[sea floor]{.mark}]{.underline} frozen
solid methane gas hydrate. The permafrost is thawing as the Arctic
temperature rapidly increases (Arctic amplification). Arctic methane
[[hydrate is **destabilizing**]{.underline}]{.mark} in at least three
locations, mainly a process that has been going on for a long time,
[[but]{.underline}]{.mark} that ocean [[warming will make
worse]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[It is or should be [treated as]{.mark} a [**zero tolerance**
risk]{.mark}]{.underline} applied to the very long time frame into the
future.​​

Right now we are in a very [[high risk of]{.mark} committed [runaway
situation]{.mark}]{.underline}, meaning we are committing ourselves and
all life to a rapid accelerating global heating that we could not
possibly change. James Hansen has been warming about this for many
years.

Runaway results from the combination of multiple triggered amplifying
large feedbacks and climate change commitment. ​​

Runaway includes [[methane feedback emissions]{.mark}- especially the
[**enormous stores** of Arctic carbon]{.mark}]{.underline} as methane
emitters. Carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide feedback GHG sources are also
huge. In runaway all three would be self reinforcing and accelerating.

[[Methane has]{.mark} a global [warming effect of **86X
CO2**]{.mark}]{.underline} for 20 years after emissions. ​​​​

Methane having increased over two and a half times since
industrialization stalled in 200 but since 2006 it has been on a renewed
sustained increase- that became explosive from 2020 and the scientists
say this increase is due to warmed wetland methane feedback emissions.
The methane they think is coming mainly from tropical and some from
northern wetlands

It seems most of the methane is being emitted from warming tropical
wetland but the largest increase is from Far North wetland peat. ​​

The highest atmospheric methane on the planet is recorded at East Trout
Lake, Saskatchewan Canada Lake right on the southern edge of Canada\'s
vast wetlands at 2010 ppb.

This use of the world runaway is not a scientific term but the basis in
science is definite.

​​This \'runaway\' means the situation caused by positive (bad) feedbacks
in which global warming accelerates the rate of global warming totally
beyond any capacity of human control.

​​[[When describing]{.mark} this [situation]{.mark} the
[scientists]{.mark} may [use]{.mark}]{.underline} the terms of rapid
global warming and abrupt global climate change.

​​[[Tipping points, **irreversible**]{.underline}]{.mark} impacts, and
singularities are also scientific terms that apply​​.

### Warming\-\--Nuclear Sites\-\--2NC

#### Warming causes escalation by damaging nuclear sites.

**Egeland '25** \[Kjølv; March 17; PhD of International Relations from
the University of Oxford; \*International Studies Review\*,
"Disentangling the Nexus of Nuclear Weapons and Climate Change---A
Research Agenda," https://watermark.silverchair.com/viaf003.pdf\] zamin

A second [[connection between **nuclear security** and]{.mark} the
unfolding **[climate challenge]{.mark}**]{.underline} relates to the
fact that extreme [[weather]{.underline}]{.mark} events and other
warming-induced changes to the natural environment stand to [[physically
impact]{.mark} existing **nuclear** [weapons sites, **infrastructure**,
and **deterrence**]{.mark} practices. [Sea-level]{.mark}]{.underline}
rise, [[storm]{.mark} surge[s]{.mark}, extreme [heat, and]{.mark} more
intense [wildfires]{.mark} all [have]{.mark} the [potential to
affect]{.mark} nuclear [bases]{.mark}, [production
facilities]{.mark}]{.underline}, and weapons deployment
[practices]{.mark}, forcing serious adaptation measures.

The challenge to nuclear sites and deterrence practices of sea-level
rise and extreme weather events has received considerable attention in
several states, sparking sensationalist headlines in major media
outlets. For example, global [[warming]{.mark} has been described as
"the [**biggest threat** to]{.mark}]{.underline} the U.K.'s [[national
security]{.mark}"]{.underline} due to the potential impact of climate
change-induced flooding on Clyde Naval Base in Scotland, home port of
the British ballistic missile submarine fleet (Chitty 2022). According
to a report commissioned by Scottish National Heritage, an executive
body of the devolved Scottish government, continued high greenhouse gas
emissions could yield sea level rise inundating the home of the United
Kingdom's only nuclear weapon system by 2080 (Hanson et al. 2017, 121).
This, in turn, could [[compromise]{.mark} both [nuclear
**safety**]{.mark}]{.underline} and the viability of the United
Kingdom's continuous-atsea-deterrence posture. Another report, written
by former UK Ministry of Defence advisor Paul Dorfman for the Nuclear
Consulting Group, concludes that climate change would "inevitably
involve very significant expense for UK nuclear military installation
operation, waste management, decommissioning, relocation or abandonment"
(Dorfman 2021, 31). There is broad agreement among British experts that,
in the event of the Clyde Naval Base becoming unavailable for use by the
Royal Navy's ballistic missile submarines, the political, economic, and
geographic obstacles to opening equivalent bases elsewhere in the United
Kingdom would be onerous if not insurmountable (Futter and Bowen 2020,
98; Walker 2018, 433; Ritchie 2016, 658--9; MacDonald 2014, 329;
Chalmers and Walker 2013, 108).

[**[US]{.mark}** nuclear [sites]{.mark} are also [at
**risk**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In a Carnegie Endowment report
investigating the vulnerability of US nuclear deterrence practices to
climate change, Jamie Kwong finds that [[**flooding**, extreme
**heat**]{.mark}, and **[wildfires]{.mark}** could [affect]{.mark} each
of the [US nuclear **triad**]{.mark}]{.underline}'s legs. The Naval
Submarine Base Kings Bay, for example, is vulnerable to sea-level rise
and storm surges. Global warming and changing precipitation patterns
could also impact Minot Air Force Base through flooding. Changes to the
climate "could have mission-altering impacts on the U.S. nuclear
deterrent," Kwong concludes (2023a, 3; see also Kwong 2023b). While the
number and geographic spread of US nuclear bases mean that extreme
weather events are unlikely to [**[seriously compromise]{.mark}** the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates' [ability to threaten]{.mark} nuclear
**[retaliation]{.mark}**]{.underline} at any given time, climate change
is highly likely to complicate and increase the cost of sustaining US
nuclear assets. As argued by Francesca Giovannini (2018, 91), "weather
changes \[...\] imply higher costs of maintenance and continuous
investments in training and disaster preparedness." The US Navy has
already initiated substantial work to limit the impact of climate change
on US naval bases (Kwong 2023a, 12). In February 2024, a fast-moving
wildfire in Texas forced the Pantex Plant---the United States' main
facility for the assembly and disassembly of nuclear warheads---to
temporarily cease operations, evacuate nonessential staff, and begin
construction of a fire barrier (McKenzie and Diaz-Maurin 2024).

Wildfires have also imperiled Russian nuclear facilities. The forest and
peat fires that spread through Russia in the summer of 2010 threatened
several nuclear sites; Russian troops were obliged to dig a five-mile
canal to protect the Sarov site, Russia's main nuclear design and
production facility (Jenkins 2010). Sarov was again threatened by forest
fires in 2021 (The Moscow Times 2021). The 2021 fire season was Russia's
most damaging since records began, with fires destroying more than 18
million hectares of Russian forest. According to an unclassified report
by the NATO command Supreme Allied Command Transformation (2021, 7),
Russia is "highly susceptible to the adverse impacts of climate change.
These impacts include ice reduction, melting permafrost, increased
flooding, air pollution, and resource depletion."

The [[melting away of Arctic]{.mark} sea ice could [potentially have
major consequences for sub]{.mark}]{.underline}marine
operation[[s]{.underline}]{.mark} [and]{.mark}, ultimately, [[strategic
stability between]{.underline}]{.mark} the major [[nuclear
powers]{.underline}]{.mark} (Sergunin and Konyshev 2017, 172; Boulègue
2019, 12). For decades, Moscow has operated its fleet of ballistic
missile submarines primarily in the high north, under or near the Arctic
ice sheet, to avoid detection by NATO surveillance aircraft, satellites,
and surface ships (Lieber and Press 2017, 35; Long and Green 2015). It
stands to reason that the [[melting]{.underline}]{.mark} of the polar
ice cap will [[make]{.underline}]{.mark} Russian
[[sub]{.underline}]{.mark}marine[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}, which are
louder than their American counterparts, [[more vulnerable to
detection]{.underline}]{.mark} and tracking by adversaries. Russian
officials have reportedly been greatly concerned by this prospect (Flake
2014, 105). That said, one set of authors concludes that climate change
will actually make submarines more difficult to detect. This is so
because the intensity of the acoustic signals radiated or reflected by
submarines is conditioned by water temperatures and salinity; all else
equal, warmer waters and lower salt concentrations will reduce the range
of acoustic detection capabilities (Gilli et al. 2024). Whether these
latter trends are significant enough to outweigh the reduction or
complete disappearance of ice cover does not yet seem clear.

[[As]{.mark} the [Arctic becomes **ice free**]{.mark} for **longer**
periods]{.underline} of time each year, [[states]{.underline}]{.mark}
will also need to [[adjust]{.mark} their [**nuclear** operations]{.mark}
in the region. For example, [**Russia** relies on]{.mark} the [cover
from **aerial**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[observation]{.mark} and
[heightened background **noise**]{.mark}]{.underline} provided by layers
of Arctic ice to hide its patrolling SSBNs. [[As]{.mark} that [ice
**melts**]{.mark}]{.underline}---with some climate reports projecting
ice-free Arctic summers by 2050---[[there will be a
greater]{.underline}]{.mark} need for escorts and patrol aircraft to
help secure the underwater battlespace around these SSBNs, with
consequent impact on military resourcing and the [[potential for
encounters]{.mark} [between **NATO** and Russian
**nuclear**-related]{.mark} **military** [assets]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Effects]{.mark} like these will **only [expand]{.mark}** [as]{.mark}
the [region experiences]{.mark} more and more drastic [**climate
changes**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Ground-based defense systems must
account for a wider array of climates, satellites must be positioned to
detect greater activity in the region made possible by melting iceways,
and new capabilities must be developed and deployed to effectively
operate in an ever-changing environment.

The [[confluence of climate]{.mark} change [and nuclear
stability]{.mark} therefore [merits]{.mark} **significant
[scrutiny]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But expert discourses on climate and
security seem unconnected. In the climate domain, a series of reports
citing the rise in global temperature have gained international
attention over the past few weeks. This rise is most drastic in the
Arctic, where thawing permafrost and changing weather patterns threaten
an already vulnerable ecosystem and pose fundamental challenges to
regional infrastructures and ways of life.

Meanwhile, a separate conversation focuses on the militarization of the
Arctic. Both Russia and China have increased their presence in the
region amidst growing competition for natural resources and control of
sea lanes made more accessible by melting ice. Russia in particular has
expanded its military capabilities, re-opening Cold War-era bases,
building and deploying icebreakers, and increasing the Northern Fleet's
capabilities and presence in the region. Western states, in turn, have
recognized a need to respond. The UK, for instance, recently released a
report calling for greater attention to Arctic defense initiatives.

While these two conversations largely exist in parallel to one another,

Numerous experts, as well as major international organizations such as
NATO and the UN, have identified climate change and the various social,
political, and economic disruptions it is likely to produce as
considerable sources of insecurity. [[Climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}, so the argument goes, could both
significantly "[[amplify]{.mark}" and "[multiply" existing
threats]{.mark}]{.underline} (Goodman and Kertysova 2022; Crilley, 2023,
159). In turn, the further [[worsening]{.mark} of existing
[tensions]{.mark}]{.underline} and enmities could
[[increase]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[attractiveness of nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark} while [discouraging]{.mark} arms [control and
disarmament]{.mark}.]{.underline}

According to a report published by the World Future Council, [[climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark} fueled international [[insecurity]{.mark}
could "[enhance]{.mark} the [chance of]{.mark} a [nuc]{.mark}lear weapon
[being used]{.mark}]{.underline}, could [[create]{.underline}]{.mark}
more fertile breeding [[grounds for]{.mark} terrorism, including
[nuclear terrorism]{.mark}, and could [feed]{.mark} the [ambitions
among]{.mark} some [states to acquire]{.mark} nuclear
[arms]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Scheffran et al. 2016, 91). Similarly, a
working group convened by the Center for Climate and Security concluded
in 2017 that [[climate insecurity]{.mark} could [make nuclear]{.mark}
[conflict more likely]{.mark}: "Regions or [countries destabilized
by]{.mark} the effects of [climate change]{.mark}]{.underline} combining
with other security threats could [[make nuc]{.underline}]{.mark}lear
escalation and misperception [[risks]{.mark} even [more
likely"]{.mark}]{.underline} (Parthemore and Nolan 2017, 17).
Identifying a number of latent nuclear threats, including nuclear
[[terrorism, prolif]{.mark}eration, and [war on the
Korea]{.mark}]{.underline}n peninsula, another set of analysts concluded
in the same year that global warming "will increase the probability of
future conflicts" and "exacerbate" existing ones, possibly triggering
the "\[e\]scalation of conflicts to limited nuclear confrontations"
(Liska et al. 2017, 28).

Will [[climate change have direct effects on
**military**]{.underline}]{.mark} power, capabilities, effectiveness,
and force employment? Will it strengthen some countries and weaken
others? These are pressing policy questions that speak to important
debates in the social sciences, such as over the impact of environmental
factors on the international distribution of military power.1 Yet,
despite the growing attention to climate change in the field of
international relations, and the enduring debates about its implications
for international security, scholars have paid little attention to how
climate change directly affects military power and military operations.
This neglect is particularly relevant when we consider that
[[climatic]{.underline}]{.mark} and meteorological [[events]{.mark} have
[played]{.mark} an [**important** role in]{.mark} international and
[military affairs]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as by contributing to the
collapse of the Roman Empire, the defeat of the Spanish "Invincible
Armada," or the defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo.2 In this paper, we
address these questions by investigating the effects of climate change
on the oceans, and in particular on how sound travels underwater, thus
contributing to the academic and public debate about the future of
submarine warfare. As we show, [[climate change]{.mark} is going to
[affect]{.mark} the [ability of **sub**]{.mark}marine[s to hide from
**detection**, with **significant implications**]{.mark}]{.underline}
for military operations, military technology, and international
security.

Submarines exploit the ocean to hide from enemy sensors such as human
sight, infrared cameras, and radar systems, which makes them a very
effective military platform. This is why [[sub]{.mark}marine[s
represent]{.mark}]{.underline} a particularly [[credible **nuclear
deterrent**]{.underline}]{.mark} (in the form of ballistic-missile
submarines), as well as a serious threat to military and civilian ships,
because they can [[provide coastal defense]{.underline}]{.mark},
interdict strategic lines of [**[communications]{.mark}**, impose a
naval [blockade, and]{.mark} more generally [threaten]{.mark} an
adversary's **[fleet]{.mark}**]{.underline}. American naval power, for
instance, is a function, at least in part, of the advanced
anti-submarine warfare capabilities of the U.S. Navy. American
anti-submarine warfare capabilities significantly degrade the
effectiveness of one of the most serious threats for any navy: enemy
submarines.3 However, the [[future]{.mark} [of submarines]{.mark} might
be [at **risk**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} When the United States,
the United Kingdom, and Australia signed the AUKUS deal in August 2021,
a prominent scholar warned of "the coming end of the submarine."4
Building on this analysis, an article in The Guardian raised the
possibility that "Australia's proposed nuclear-powered submarines could
be obsolete by the time they hit the water in the 2040s due to new
technologies making underwater vessels 'visible.'"5 At face value, these
concerns seem warranted. Progress in sensor acuity, multi-sensor
connectivity, big data, and machine learning could significantly improve
anti-submarine capabilities in the future, and, in turn, deprive
submarines of their capacity to exploit the ocean to hide --- an outcome
known as "ocean transparency."6

If this is true, the implications will be significant. Over the past
decade, many countries have invested in submarines, and some have
decided to give priority to these platforms over surface ships, a trend
that, according to some, will increase in the future with submarines
taking over some of the functions of aircraft carriers.7 [[If ocean
transparency]{.mark} is indeed [on]{.mark} the
[horizon]{.mark}]{.underline}, these investments could be a bad bet ---
especially since new submarine projects take decades to complete.8
Moreover, ocean transparency would have important implications for
deterrence and warfighting. It [[could **deprive** countries
of]{.underline}]{.mark} an [[effective means of defending]{.mark} their
[**coasts** and]{.mark} providing conventional
**[deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline} through diesel-electric submarines.
It could also make the most credible delivery system for nuclear
weapons, ballistic-missile submarines, obsolete, thus [[**jeopardizing**
nuclear **stability**]{.underline}]{.mark}.9 Finally, ocean transparency
might strengthen some countries and weaken others, for instance, by
depriving the U.S. Navy of its enduring advantage in submarine warfare
stemming from its very quiet submarines.10

### Devolution Fails\-\--2AC

#### Devolution fails---it breeds [elite consolidation]{.underline} and [political infighting]{.underline} between natives. 

**Welch '15** \[Mary; December 12; Principal with Probe Research,

"[[**Devolution** is a **ship**]{.mark} that's listing, [and there's no
**safe shore**]{.mark} to go to]{.underline}," said one former
high-level provincial official.

["[It's **stuttering**]{.mark}" said]{.underline} a First Nations leader
who helped oversee an aboriginal authority.

"In terms of the basic premise, [no, [**devolution** hasn't been
**successful**]{.mark}," said a senior child-welfare
executive.]{.underline}

Devolution, promised 15 years ago, was meant to hand management of
child-welfare services to First Nations and Métis people. Indigenous
people were supposed to regain control of their children, the
child-welfare agencies that help them and the culturally appropriate
services they get.

But many First Nations leaders argue [[the system, **enshrined** in
**legislation**]{.mark} in 2003, [never
**evolved**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Instead, [it's [still]{.mark} a
"[**white** system" **strangled** by **rules**]{.mark}]{.underline},
micromanaged from the family services minister's office and responsible
for exponentially more indigenous children being taken from their
parents.

"I saw them [[setting]{.mark} us [up]{.mark} as a
[**smoke**-and-**mirrors**]{.mark} game to try and make it look like
devolution is happening [when]{.mark} in fact [**devolution** has been
**dead**]{.mark} in the water for at least three years]{.underline},"
Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs Grand Chief Derek Nepinak said.

Meanwhile, the province and senior social workers argue their first job
is to keep children safe --- and First [Nations-run **agencies** and
authorities have proven **unable** to do that over the last dozen
years.]{.underline}

"At three in the morning, the phone rings and a kid is in danger, and
someone has to be responsible for that kid," said one senior government
source. "Maybe we're doing a shitty job, but someone's gotta protect
that kid."

The struggles continued this year --- the fallout from the murder of
Tina Fontaine, the 15-year-old found dead in the Red River, the latest
pledge to ban housing kids in hotels following the sexual assault of a
teen in a downtown parkade and the ever-swelling number of kids in care.

But amid those high-profile, attention-grabbing failures, t[he basic
building block of [devolution]{.mark} has [quietly
**crumbled**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

At the [simplest, **technical** level, any First [Nations control
over]{.mark} child [**welfare** no longer **exists**]{.mark} and hasn't
for three years in southern Manitoba and for a year in the
north.]{.underline} It's a little-remarke[d-on fact that the fundamental
element of devolution has been suspended.]{.underline}

In the south, First Nations' [[control]{.mark} over the Southern
Authority [**collapsed** following]{.mark} a [**power** struggle
between]{.mark} the **[chiefs]{.mark}** and the provinc]{.underline}e.
In the north, the province yanked back control over the Northern
Authority following years of oversight failures. The protection branch
of Child and Family Services is effectively running both
[[authorities]{.mark}, and has **[consolidated]{.mark}** its
[power]{.mark}, not devolved it.]{.underline}

In interviews, both on and off the record, with more than a dozen people
within the Manitoba child-welfare system or very familiar with it, [a
picture of a stubborn **stalemate** has emerged]{.underline}. Here's how
it happened:

### Devolution Fails\-\--1AR

These themes are shown in Figure 1 below and represent the [[major
**challenges**]{.mark} that governments will [face in

the National Agreement. (Source: Anthony Cowley and Paul Tremblay, The
**[[Devolution]{.underline}]{.mark}** Dilemma, 2022, p. 7) 

1.Accountability of systems, organisations and leaders. The concept of
accountability was identified as having the potential to be a force for
good, However, [[when]{.underline}]{.mark} mechanism[s to facilitate
[**accountability** are **unbalanced**]{.mark}, overly
burdensome red-tape is a common unintended outcome.
T]{.underline}his can [[hinder **efficient**]{.mark} service
[delivery]{.mark}.  ]{.underline}

2\. Partnerships and the capacity of entities to partner. This is an
issue due to: 

[agency capacity being hindered by churn of roles and loss of critical
staff a]{.underline}nd expertise from dedicated roles. 

[[**disproportionate** challenges]{.mark} for many First
[Nations]{.mark} enterprises [in]{.mark} terms of [**poor**
relationships and]{.mark} comparative size and organisational
**[capabilities]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

3\. Power and decision making. Governments are seen to routinely share
power due to probity requirements, [a '[**cult** of
**managerialism**]{.mark}' within government, [fear of
letting-go]{.mark} of **[authority]{.mark}**, power imbalances, and
capability gaps in the community-controlled sector. ]{.underline}

4\. Identifying and engaging with the right partners. [Effective
[engagement is **hindered** by]{.mark} government knowledge of First
Nations organisations and existing [regional]{.mark} governance
[arrangements and]{.mark}]{.underline} cross agency/government [or
jurisdiction **[coordination]{.mark}**. ]{.underline}

5\. Cultural change of organisations. Significant cultural change is
required to embed the National Agreement. This includes a shift from
transactional servicing to community development models and overcoming
racism through better understanding of culture and history. 

6\. Data availability and quality. There is [a [need to
**improve**]{.mark} the information government receives through
structured community]{.underline} input to need analyses, evaluations
and [performance **[monitoring]{.mark}** which can be enhanced
[through]{.mark} community sourced qualitative and quantitative
[data]{.mark}. ]{.underline}

#### Officials aren't [committed]{.underline}.

While the Government of Nunavut has begun investing in training and
education for teachers, nurses, managers, and lawyers, it has failed to
address the stranglehold non-Inuit employees have exercised in
management positions and attempts to prioritize Inuit hiring. Over time,
it [has become clear that non-Inuit prefer to maintain the power they
have accrued in the years since the creation]{.underline} of Nunavut and
now challenge hiring plans. There [have never been anti-racist policies
and measures that would create the atmosphere for meaningful inclusion
of Inuit. The reality is that the territorial government has serious
barriers to Inuit employment.]{.underline}

A Nunavut Inuit Labour Force analysis released in 2018 found Inuit
account for 50 per cent of Government of Nunavut employees and 40
percent of Government of Canada employees in Nunavut (these are not
typically policy and senior management positions that inform government
action). The federal government has even lower employment rates. Many of
the transferred responsibilities under devolution will be specialised
professions, according to the human resource strategy on devolution
released in 2020. The list includes regulatory and permitting
administration in various land use scenarios. It is not clear how, with
the history of ineffective Inuit employment strategies and approaches,
the GN's actions now will be different.

This [[constitutes]{.mark} a [**danger** for]{.mark} the
[territory]{.mark}. If the training and employment issues are not dealt
with, and [**non**-Inuit continue]{.mark} to **[dominate]{.mark}** the
[government]{.mark}]{.underline}, Nunavut is at greater risk of moving
further away from Inuit values. This could serve to heighten the
existing issue of unrestricted jurisdiction for mining and extractive
industries in the territory. The current mining activities are in
caribou calving grounds, which Inuit have sacrificed for job
opportunities. (There is a clear tension here: if Inuit speak about
wanting to protect wildlife we rely on for food, they are quickly
excused as being anti-jobs). We are already allowing mining activities
to take place without a Nunavut-wide land use plan, a departure from
land claim agreement. 

### Devolution\-\--Certainty Key\-\--2AC

#### Devolution is [dysfunctional]{.underline} and plagued by [uncertainty]{.underline}---agencies [never]{.underline} respond.

[A [**complicated** system, with **murky**
accountability]{.mark}]{.underline}

In Manitoba, a family-tree-like flow chart is needed to figure out child
welfare.

There are 23 agencies in the province, including 17 First Nations ones
based on reserve, such as Peguis Child and Family, or Awasis, which
serves many northern reserves. Those provide front-line services to
families, investigate abuse, apprehend endangered children and manage
foster homes.

There are four authorities that are supposed to be watchdogs for the 23
agencies (much like regional health authorities manage local hospitals).
The authorities, especially the southern and northern First Nations
ones, were meant to take over a bulk of the oversight power of the
province's child protection branch.

Those [**[agencies]{.mark}** and authorities [have]{.mark} **notoriously
[unstable]{.mark}** [leadership]{.mark}, though the same handful of
names often [gets **recycled** throughout]{.mark} the
[system]{.mark}.]{.underline}

All together, those 27 agencies and authorities each have boards of
directors --- more than 100 people in the aboriginal system alone ---
often appointed by bands or tribal councils, which is largely where the
new-found aboriginal control of child welfare was meant to rest. In
Winnipeg, there's one central intake agency (called the All Nations
Coordinated Response Network or ANCR) that's supposed to be the first
point of contact for a child whose file is then transferred as fast as
possible to the right agency --- Peguis for a child with roots in
Peguis, the Métis agency if a child is Métis, and so on.

Layered over that [are [reams of **regulations**]{.mark}, legislation, a
massive and almost impenetrable standards manual]{.underline} that lays
out the rules and timelines social workers must follow, and a
federal-provincial, per-[child funding formula the Bank of Canada's
chief economist would [have **trouble** parsing]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The upshot is a school in Winnipeg might have children in care from nine
or 10 different agencies, all of varying quality. There are more than 20
agencies with offices in Winnipeg, to serve children who belong to any
number of northern First Nations but who live in the city.

When troubling incidents occur, [it's [never **clear** who is]{.mark}
really [in charge]{.mark}, except the often-beleaguered
minister]{.underline} of family services. Manitoba has had three
different ones in the last five years. Currently, it's Kerri Irvin-Ross.

[[Despite **devolution**]{.mark}, which was meant to hand more control
and responsibility for aboriginal children to aboriginal-run
agencies]{.underline}, when a child dies in care or parents claim
they've been unfairly vilified as unfit[, [agency]{.mark} CEOs almost
[**never** respond.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"I went to them a couple of times. I had my tea. I had my fruit from the
fruit tray and I listened and saw that it wasn't really accomplishing
anything. I [[decided this is]{.mark} a [**waste** of]{.mark} our
[time]{.mark}. I]{.underline} feel I've pressed every button on the
panel... The minister's office has always been in control." --- Derek
Nepinak

When an agency boss is fired for mismanaging funds or nepotism --- as
happened at the Cree Nation Child & Family Caring Agency in 2009 and at
Awasis the year after --- it's never the agency's aboriginal board that
is held publicly accountable, or the authority for failing to crack
down. CEOs almost never return calls, and the Northern Authority, in its
dozen years of existence, has almost never responded to requests to
explain publicly how, for example, a child such as 14-year-old
Rephanniah Redhead could commit suicide while living in a Winnipeg group
home for high-risk youth while in the care of the Awasis agency.

Instead, it is Manitoba's family services minister who often finds
himself or herself facing a wall of television cameras in the halls of
the legislature, constrained by the province's own privacy legislation
that essentially muzzles government when a child dies in care or a
spending scandal erupts [or a [review suggests]{.mark} an [agency
is]{.mark} profoundly **[dysfunctional]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Indeed, on the signing and celebration, most Nunavummiut did not know
until the day before that the signing was to take place. The only people
to partake in the celebration were those invited, and it seems they were
sworn to secrecy. It was not a Nunavut celebration. [This [lack of
**transparency** is]{.mark} all the more [**frustrating** given]{.mark}
the [history]{.mark} of [**excluding** Inuit.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Public **[dialogue]{.mark}** and transparency [should be
critica]{.mark}l]{.underline} for a territory claiming now to "run our
own affairs" after years of colonial intervention. Th[e [secrecy
**cheated**]{.mark} Nunavummiut [out]{.mark}]{.underline} of partaking
in not only celebrations but the critical piece of talking about what it
means for us; if we truly belie[ve it is an [agreement]{.mark} worth
celebrating.]{.underline} 

There will be opportunities for Inuit arising from Devolution. B[ut
[given]{.mark} the [**failed** implementation]{.mark}]{.underline} of
the land claim agreement in many key areas, the Government of Nunavut's
drift away from commitments to Inuit, and the slow abandonment of Inuit
self-determination generally, it remains to be seen if these
opportunities for our political leaders will translate to Inuit values
and interests are the future of Nunavut. That future imagines Inuit
language thriving, hunting way of life as a livelihood, and Inuit are
healthy and accessing their lands.

their ambition, to pursue climate policies. While Iceland's geothermal
industry provides the country with most their energy and lead the way
worldwide for effective emissions mitigation, other northern geographies
like Nunavut, Canada run on 99.94 percent diesel.41 Sub-national
[[governments can fill]{.mark} the [policy **gap**]{.mark} left by inert
national actors, [but they can]{.mark}no[t replace national
**involvement** altogether]{.mark}]{.underline} today.

[[Rather than]{.mark} sub-national Arctic [actors taking]{.mark} on the

parallel to Arctic states [[immediately]{.mark}, the **[A]{.mark}**rctic

to there. Visions provide the common, universal goals or outcomes that
can coordinate many actors working at different levels. Establishing key
priorities for regional outcomes can ensure that intended impacts are
met. This could help reset the conventional, often neglected role of
Arctic regional actors and push the Council in a more inclusive
direction, though it also raises the issue of subnational tensions, as
highlighted in this volume by Inuuteq Holm Olsen's argument on
Greenland-Denmark relations.

After respondent Lara, an Indian who is not a member of the Spirit Lake
Tribe (Tribe), ignored the Tribe's order excluding him from its
reservation, he struck one of the federal officers arresting him. He
pleaded guilty in Tribal Court to the crime of violence to a policeman.
The Federal Government then charged him with the federal crime of
assaulting a federal officer. Lara claimed that, because key elements of
that crime mirrored elements of his tribal crime, he was protected by
the Double Jeopardy Clause. The Government countered that the Clause
does not bar successive prosecutions by separate sovereigns, and that
this "dual sovereignty" doctrine determined the outcome. The Government
noted that this Court has held that a tribe acts as a separate sovereign
in prosecuting its own members, United States v. Wheeler, 435 U. S. 313,
318, 322--323; that, after this Court ruled that a tribe lacks sovereign
authority to prosecute nonmember Indians, see Duro v. Reina, 495 U. S.
676, 679, Congress specifically authorized such prosecutions; and that,
[[because]{.mark} this [statute enlarges]{.mark} the tribes'
[self-government powers to include]{.mark} "the [inherent power]{.mark}
of Indian tribes ... [to exercise criminal jurisdiction]{.mark} over all
Indians," 25 U. S. C. §1301(2), [the Tribe]{.mark} here had [exercised
its own]{.mark} tribal [authority]{.mark}, not delegated federal
authority]{.underline}. Accepting this argument, the Magistrate Judge
rejected Lara's double jeopardy claim. The en banc Eighth Circuit
reversed, holding that the "dual sovereignty" doctrine did not apply
because the Tribal Court was exercising a federal prosecutorial power,
and, thus, the Double Jeopardy Clause barred the second prosecution.

Held: [[Because the Tribe acted]{.mark} in its capacity [as]{.mark} a
[sovereign]{.mark} authority, the [Double Jeopardy]{.mark} Clause [does
not prohibit]{.mark} the [Federal]{.mark} Government from proceeding
with the present [prosecution]{.mark} for a discrete federal

### Warming\-\--Impact: Methane Hydrates\-\--2AC

#### Methane Hydrates are harmless.

**Valich '22** \[Lindsey; October 18; MS Environmental Management,
Harvard University; University of Rochester News Center, "Ancient Ocean
Methane Not an Immediate Climate Change Threat,"
<https://www.rochester.edu/newscenter/ancient-ocean-methane-not-an-immediate-climate-change-threat-537792/>\]
zamin

Deep below the ocean's surface, the seafloor contains large quantities
of naturally occurring, ice-like deposits made up of water and
concentrated methane gas. For decades, climate scientists have wondered
if this methane hydrate reservoir might "melt" and release massive
amounts of methane to the ocean and the atmosphere as ocean temperatures
warm.

[New research from scientists]{.underline} at the University of
Rochester, the US Geological Survey, and the University of California
[Irvine is the **first** to **directly** show that **methane** released
from decomposing **hydrates** is **not reaching** the
atmosphere.]{.underline}

The researchers, including John Kessler, a professor in the Department
of Earth and Environmental Sciences, and DongJoo Joung, a former
research scientist in Kessler's lab and now an assistant professor in
the Department of Oceanography at Pusan National University in Korea,
carried out the study in mid-latitude regions---Earth's subtropical and
temperate zones.

While the stability of the methane hydrate reservoir is sensitive to
changes in temperature, "in the mid-latitude regions where this study
was conducted, [we see **no signatures** of hydrate **methane** being
emitted]{.underline} to the atmosphere," says Joung, the first author of
the study, published in Nature Geoscience.

How methane hydrates form, stabilize, and degrade

Locked away in ice-like methane hydrates, methane has no effect on
climate. But released into the atmosphere, it acts as a powerful,
heat-trapping gas. Today's atmosphere contains methane emitted from
human activities---such as fossil fuel extraction and use, agriculture,
and landfills---and methane emitted naturally from wetlands, wildfires,
aquatic environments, and coastal zones and onshore seeps.

Ocean sediments are massive storehouses for ancient reservoirs of
natural methane in the form of methane hydrates.

"The amount of methane locked up in gas hydrates globally is
staggering," Joung says.

Scientists have hypothesized that the release of even part of this
reservoir could significantly exacerbate climate change.

Says Kessler: "Imagine a bubble in your fish tank going from the bottom
of the tank to the top and exploding and releasing whatever was in that
bubble to the air above it---that was the way many people viewed how
hydrate decomposition might contribute to our warming world."

Gas hydrates form where both methane and water meet at high-pressure and
low-temperature conditions. In the parts of the ocean located in the
temperate and subtropical mid-latitudes, hydrates can remain stable only
at depths below about 500 meters (approximately 1640 feet) beneath the
sea surface. Generally, [hydrates become **more stable** the **deeper**
they are beneath the sea surface.]{.underline}

research vessel.

Kessler, and Mihai Leonte '19 (PhD) use a giant suction hose to collect
ocean water. (University of Rochester photo / John Kessler)

That means the upper stability boundary for methane hydrates---500
meters---is a "sweet spot." It is the most susceptible to melting under
warming seawater temperatures, and it is the shortest distance a bubble
of "previously-hydrated" methane would have to travel before reaching
the atmosphere.

But [even in this **sweet spot**, the researchers did not observe
**evidence** of hydrate methane being emitted to the
atmosphere.]{.underline}

Fingerprinting the methane source

To conduct their study, the [researchers measured unique
**isotopic**]{.underline} "signatures" of oceanic methane in samples of
seawater they collected from various depths in the mid-latitude regions
of both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. This allowed them to directly
identify the origin of methane in seawater.

To make even one measurement, they need an enormous amount of water---a
single sample includes about two thousand gallons of seawater. The
researchers used a giant suction hose to collect the samples and
employed a novel technique their team developed that involves extracting
methane from each sample. The researchers compressed the methane into
cylinders that they then brought back to Kessler's lab on the River
Campus to prepare for analysis.

As the researchers documented, ancient methane is being released from
the seafloor. However, they found [**negligible** amounts of this
ancient **methane** in the surface waters]{.underline}. They concluded,
based on earlier studies, that this methane gas first dissolves in the
deeper waters and then oceanic microbes biodegrade the methane, turning
it into carbon dioxide before it leaves the water.

Previous work by Kessler's group and others found that these processes
are active in the mid-latitude regions and that similar processes helped
to mitigate the effects of methane released during the Deepwater Horizon
oil spill.

Carbon dioxide, while also a greenhouse gas, "can be incorporated into
other carbon reservoirs in seawater," says Kessler. While some of the
carbon dioxide could also be emitted into the atmosphere, it would
happen over much longer time scales---thousands of years---and the
warming wouldn't be as acute.

The new study builds on previous work in Kessler's lab, focused on
methane hydrates in the Arctic Ocean. Arctic waters are another sweet
spot for the study of hydrates because the cold temperature means that
hydrates destabilize in shallower waters, where they have a short
distance to travel to reach the atmosphere.

Kessler calls these results "good news"---but news that underscores the
work that remains. "This tells us [that in order to reduce sources of
**methane** to the atmosphere, we can focus more of our attention on
mitigating **human emissions**,"]{.underline} he says.

4.1 Marine Sediments

[In the shallow marine sedimentary section, the strongest biochemical
sink is the **[anaerobic oxidation of methane]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(AOM) \[Barnes and Goldberg, 1976; Martens and Berner, 1977; Reeburgh,
1976\], which [[is carried out by]{.mark} a consortium of
[microbes]{.mark}]{.underline} \[Knittel and Boetius, 2009\] and is
strongly coupled to sulfate reduction \[e.g., Malinverno and Pohlman,
2011\], particularly in diffusion-dominated provinces lacking additional
hydrocarbon sources \[Joye et al., 2004\]. The sulfate reduction zone
(SRZ) occupies the centimeters to meters just below the seafloor, with a
thicker SRZ corresponding to areas of lower upward methane flux
\[Borowski et al., 1997\]. [The microbial consortium that carries out
AOM \[Boetius et al., 2000\] has been termed a biofilter that [prevents
upwardly-migrating CH4 from reaching the seafloor]{.mark}, where it
could be emitted to the ocean. A summary by Reeburgh \[2007\] concluded
that up to 80% to [**90%** of]{.mark} the estimated 400 Tg yr−1
[CH4]{.mark} that reaches the SRZ via upward migration through the
sediments [is consumed]{.mark} by AOM]{.underline} \[Hinrichs and
Boetius, 2003\]. [At sites with vigorous seepage, AOM has sometimes been
found to be highly efficient]{.underline} \[Joye et al., 2004\], while
only about 20% of the CH4 is consumed by AOM at other locations
\[Boetius and Wenzhofer, 2013\]. The reduced efficiency of AOM in some
higher flux settings leads to the possibility that rapidly ascending gas
in the form of bubbles may bypass the sediment biofilter \[e.g., Martens
and Klump, 1980\] and be injected into the overlying ocean without major
alteration by the AOM sediment sink.

AOM is also closely coupled to carbonate precipitation at shallow depths
beneath the seafloor since AOM produces bicarbonate, which increases
alkalinity. The resulting authigenic carbonates, which are often exhumed
at the seafloor at methane seeps, effectively remove carbon from the
mobile carbon cycle. The carbonates also carry a record of CH4 emissions
in both their absolute age \[e.g., Bayon et al., 2009; Crémière et al.,
2016; Liebetrau et al., 2010; Teichert et al., 2003; Watanabe et al.,
2008\] and in their changing carbon isotopic characteristics \[e.g.,
Aloisi et al., 2000\]. In some places, the isotopic characteristics of
these carbonates have been interpreted as reflecting local
destabilization of gas hydrate \[Bohrmann et al., 1998\].

[The physical characteristics of **[marine sediments]{.mark}** also
[constitute]{.mark} a type of [sink]{.mark} for CH4 released from
dissociating gas hydrates]{.underline}. These physical sinks do not
transform CH4 in the way that AOM does, but [they can prevent it from
interacting with the ocean-atmosphere system for thousands of years. The
most important [physical factors]{.mark} are those that [impede]{.mark}
the [migration]{.mark} of methane through the sedimentary section.
Examples include low-permeability sediments, structural traps, and
hydrate- and/or gas-saturated sediments that impede fluid
advection]{.underline} \[e.g., Bhatnagar et al., 2007; Chatterjee et
al., 2014; Davies and Clarke, 2010; Davies et al., 2014; Garg et al.,
2008; Liu and Flemings, 2007; Nimblett and Ruppel, 2003\].

4.2 Water Column Methane Sinks

Once CH4 is emitted at the seafloor, two major factors may prevent its
reaching the atmosphere. First, [despite methane\'s low solubility in
seawater]{.underline} \[Wiesenburg and Guinasso, 1979\], [the
concentrations of CH4 in most ocean waters are still so low that the
[gas diffuses]{.mark} rapidly [from rising CH4]{.mark}-filled
[bubbles]{.mark} following emission at the seafloor. During this
bubble-stripping process, [CH4 is replaced by oxygen and
nitrogen]{.mark}]{.underline} \[McGinnis et al., 2006; Vielstädte et
al., 2015\]. Bubbles emitted deeper than the shallowest extent of gas
hydrate stability in the water column may develop an armor of gas
hydrate \[Chen et al., 2014, 2016; Graves et al., 2015; Rehder et al.,
2002, 2009; Sauter et al., 2006; Topham, 1984; Wang et al., 2016;
Warzinski et al., 2014; Zhang, 2003\], but such armoring may or may not
reduce the rate at which CH4 leaves the rising bubbles \[Rehder et al.,
2002; Wang et al., 2016\]. Overall, most CH4 emitted from the seafloor
either above or below the top of the GHSZ and whether originating with
gas hydrate dissociation or other processes will be dissolved relatively
deep in the water column.

As an example, for 50% of the CH4 contained in the bubble at the
seafloor to reach the atmosphere requires 14 and 20 mm diameter bubbles
to be emitted at 50 and 100 m water depths, respectively, and even
larger bubbles at greater water depths. (Figure 8a). While
quantification of bubble sizes at marine seeps is in its infancy, the
bubble sizes measured to date are far smaller than would be necessary to
ensure that CH4 reaches the atmosphere \[e.g., Römer et al., 2012;
Skarke et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2016\]. Once dissolved in ocean
waters, CH4 can eventually be emitted to the atmosphere by gas exchange,
which can be enhanced by certain conditions (e.g., high winds and
storminess \[Shakhova et al., 2014; Wanninkhof, 1992\]). In deeper
waters, CH4 could remain in the oceans for centuries, depending on the
nature of ocean circulation and the depth below the surface mixed layer
at which the CH4 is dissolved.

Once dissolved in seawater, [**[aerobic microbial oxidation]{.mark}**
(MOx) is a strong sink that can [limit]{.mark} the [flux]{.mark} of
dissolved methane to the atmosphere]{.underline} \[e.g., Mau et al.,
2007; Ward et al., 1987\]. MOx was traditionally thought to be a
relatively slow process \[e.g., Valentine et al., 2001\], but more
[recent studies show that oxidation rates can increase when seawater is
perturbed with elevated concentrations of CH4]{.underline} \[e.g.,
Crespo-Medina et al., 2014; de Angelis and Scranton, 1993; Du and
Kessler, 2012; Heintz et al., 2012; Kessler et al., 2011; Mau et al.,
2013; Pack et al., 2015\]. Most of these studies inoculate seawater
samples with radioisotope tracers to measure MOx rates in discrete
parcels of water at the specific locations and times of sampling. The
true strength of this sink can only be assessed by measuring the total
integrated amount of MOx in the water column, either regionally \[e.g.,
Du and Kessler, 2012; Leonte et al., 2017\] or globally. For example,
assuming that the open ocean is in steady state with a dissolved methane
concentration of 2 nM, this would equate to an open-ocean methane burden
of 43.2 Tg CH4 \[Reeburgh, 2007\]. If methane emissions to the water
column are balanced by aerobic methane oxidation with first-order MOx
rate constants ranging from 0.001 to 0.2 d−1 \[de Angelis and Scranton,
1993; Mau et al., 2013; Pack et al., 2011; Valentine et al., 2001\],
then both the rates of MOx and seafloor CH4 emission to the water column
probably lie in the range of 16 to 3200 Tg yr−1. While we make no
attempt to constrain the most likely value within this large range,
combining even the low end-member with the global sink associated with
CH4 oxidation in marine sediments (80--90% of 400 Tg yr−1) \[Reeburgh,
2007\] suggests that oceanic sinks of methane are at least equal to, and
potentially greater than, all atmospheric sinks of CH4 (\~540 Tg yr−1
from top-down calculations in Kirschke et al. \[2013\]).

Several aspects of the aerobic MOx sink remain poorly understood. For
example, the chemical stoichiometry of this reaction, especially how it
changes as the microbial population is aggressively growing in response
to a seafloor injection of CH4, is unknown \[Chan et al., 2016\]. In
addition, several investigations have documented depletions in dissolved
oxygen, trace metals, and nutrients following the aerobic oxidation of
CH4 and oil in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico after the Deepwater
Horizon incident \[Du and Kessler, 2012; Joung and Shiller, 2013;
Schiller and Joung, 2012\], leading to questions about whether these
chemical species may be limiting factors for oxidation of seafloor CH4
emissions. Also unknown is whether currents can disperse elevated
concentrations of CH4 to levels below the threshold to initiate MOx
before microbial populations can increase in response to CH4 injection
or whether transport of dissolved CH4 to the surface mixed layer and
hence to the sea-air interface can outcompete oxidation. Measurements of
the natural radiocarbon content of CH4 at a few locations have suggested
that CH4 in the surface mixed layer is not originating with seafloor
emissions \[Kessler et al., 2008\] but rather with unique methane
generation processes active in the near-surface ocean \[Damm et al.,
2008; Karl et al., 2008; Metcalf et al., 2012; Repeta et al., 2016\].

Bubble stripping and the water column oxidation sink may prevent much of
the CH4 emitted at the seafloor from reaching the sea-air interface, but
these processes could still potentially have an important impact on
ocean chemistry and habitats. As noted above, aggressive oxidation
following massive CH4 releases can deoxygenate waters and deplete
certain chemical species while also increasing dissolved CO2 that could
enhance acidification \[e.g., Archer et al., 2009; Biastoch et al.,
2011; Dickens, 2001a; Elliott et al., 2011; Kessler et al., 2011\].
Outside of semienclosed anoxic basins, typical CH4 concentrations range
from 2 to 300 nM \[Heintz et al., 2012; Mau et al., 2013; Rona et al.,
2015\], while the background concentrations of dissolved CO2 and
dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) are approximately 30 μM and 2260 μM,
respectively. The 4 to 6 orders of magnitude difference between
dissolved methane concentration and DIC concentration suggests that even
complete oxidation of CH4 emitted at the seafloor from natural seeps
will have an insignificant influence on inorganic carbon chemistry and,
by extension, seawater pH, unless CH4 and CH4-derived DIC can
substantially accumulate in seawater.

4.3 Terrestrial Methane Sinks

A discussion of cold region terrestrial CH4 sinks \[Jorgensen et al.,
2015; Walter Anthony et al., 2014\] is largely beyond the scope of this
paper and is most relevant where [[CH4 from]{.mark} dissociating deeply
[buried permafrost]{.mark}-associated gas [hydrates]{.mark} (estimated
\~1% or more of the global inventory) \[Ruppel, 2015\] migrates upward
and [encounters]{.mark} microbial **[soil sinks]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Aerobic and anaerobic CH4 oxidation in permafrost settings depends on a
variety of factors \[Lee et al., 2012; Preuss et al., 2013\]. The
paucity of sulfate in terrestrial sediments means that oxidation
pathways and rates are substantially different in tundra settings
relative to deep marine sediments. Still, if CH4 from dissociating gas
hydrates were to pass through sediments in dissolved (bioavailable)
form, some oxidation processes might be expected to mitigate the
fraction of this CH4 that reaches the surface \[Lau et al., 2015\].
[Like marine sediments, [tundra may]{.mark} also [have]{.mark}
low-permeability **[traps]{.mark}** that act as a kind of physical
sink,]{.underline} ~~retarding~~ [[\[slowing\] upward migration]{.mark}
of CH4. A unique physical barrier in high-latitude settings is
**[pore-filling ice]{.mark}**, which could [trap CH4]{.mark} released
during subpermafrost gas hydrate dissociation]{.underline}.

The equivocal evidence for gas hydrate dissociation having injected CH4
into the atmosphere during past and ongoing warming events and the
paucity of contemporary data to constrain this process have led
researchers to rely on numerical models to assess gas hydrate-climate
interactions. The models split roughly between those that examine the
impact of climate change on gas hydrate deposits and those that study
climate changes that may result after CH4 is emitted to the ocean and/or
atmosphere from dissociating gas hydrate deposits. In the section below,
we review challenges with existing models for climate-hydrate
interactions, focusing on the problems with the assumed source size,
incomplete consideration of methane sinks, and oversimplification of
oceanographic conditions. [Many numerical models dramatically
overestimate the amount of CH4 liberated during gas hydrate dissociation
events, an outcome that can feed into **unrealistic catastrophic
scenarios**]{.underline}.

7.1 Size of the Methane Hydrate Source

[[Overprediction]{.mark} of gas release from dissociating hydrates
[can]{.mark} often [be traced to ascribing too large a methane source to
hydrate]{.mark} deposits]{.underline}. If the a priori gas hydrate
distributions are based primarily on P-T stability constraints, with no
consideration of more complex factors (e.g., lithology, methane
solubility, permeability, availability of methane or its organic carbon
precursor), then the amount of sequestered CH4 is likely to be
overestimated. This is particularly true when researchers assume high
hydrate saturation (amount of pore space filled by hydrate) within the
GHSZ. For example, Harvey and Huang \[1995\] adopted \>10% saturation in
their early model of the impact of marine gas hydrate dissociation and
CH4 release in exacerbating global warming, purposely seeking to
generate a worst case scenario. Gornitz and Fung \[1994\] first
determined the geographic regions in which marine gas hydrates might
occur based on a phytoplankton proxy for sediment organic carbon
distributions (instead of actual sediment measurements) \[Klauda and
Sandler, 2005\] and then adopted relatively high saturations (i.e.,
5--10% of bulk porosity) for their in situ CH4 generation model and as
high as 50% at the BGHS for their fluid migration model. Among the
numerical models that have conservatively estimated the potential marine
hydrate source by using low bulk saturations are those by MacDonald
\[1990\], Reagan et al. \[2011\], and Biastoch et al. \[2011\]. A
different approach to source estimation abandons a priori assumptions
about gas hydrate saturations and allows the reservoir to evolve to
steady state based on the global distribution of organic carbon in
sediments \[Buffett and Archer, 2004\] and other variables (e.g.,
temperature, oxygen availability, rates of sedimentation and
methanogenesis, and clay content).

A final note related [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} the size of the CH4
source is the treatment of thermodynamics in many numerical models. [For
simplicity, researchers often [ignore]{.mark} the **[endothermic heat of
dissociation]{.mark}** in modeling the impact of temperature changes on
the gas hydrate reservoir]{.underline}. The degree to which this effect
offsets the impact of top-down temperature changes on the gas hydrate
reservoir is proportional to hydrate saturation, and including the heat
of dissociation often requires a more challenging iterative approach for
tracking the BGHS. However, [failure to include this thermodynamics can
[lead to predictions **of too much gas liberated**]{.mark} and too rapid
a disappearance of the GHSZ during warming events]{.underline}.

7.2 Methane Sinks

Even when the assumptions about the size of the CH4 hydrate source are
reasonable, [numerical models can overestimate CH4 emitted to the
atmosphere if [**sinks** are not appropriately incorporated]{.mark}
along each part of the transport path: sediment, ocean, and atmosphere.
For example, few numerical models assessing climate-hydrate interactions
address the gas dynamics affecting CH4 as it migrates from the
dissociation site at the BGHS through the overlying GHSZ. Within the
GHSZ, gas hydrate may re-form, gas may dissolve in
methane-undersaturated pore waters, or free gas bubbles may be
trapped]{.underline}. Xu et al. \[2001\] did consider these processes in
detail, and Stranne et al. \[2016b\] have recently reiterated the
critical role of multiphase flow dynamics for appropriate modeling of
reservoir changes in response to climate forcing. The role of sediment
properties in impeding the migration of methane released by gas hydrate
dissociation is another factor that is rarely taken into account in
climate-hydrate models, even though low-permeability sediments in some
cases may shut down much of the methane migration to the sediment-water
interface \[Reagan and Moridis, 2009; Stranne et al., 2016b\] or retard
dissociation \[Reagan and Moridis, 2008\]. The models that best
incorporate these processes capture multiphase flow and transport
processes in porous media through use of tools like the TOUGH code
\[e.g., Reagan and Moridis, 2008, 2009; Reagan et al., 2011; Stranne et
al., 2016a\].

[The strong **[AOM]{.mark}** sink for CH4 in marine sediments [is rarely
given full consideration]{.mark} in numerical models]{.underline}
\[e.g., Gornitz and Fung, 1994; Harvey and Huang, 1995; Isaksen et al.,
2011; O\'Connor et al., 2010; Reagan and Moridis, 2007; Reagan and
Moridis, 2008; Stranne et al., 2016b\]. Some models approach geochemical
sinks by assuming that sediment-based processes (particularly AOM)
prevent a certain percentage of methane released by dissociation of gas
hydrate from reaching the overlying ocean \[e.g., Biastoch et al.,
2011\]. Others selectively incorporate non-AOM geochemical sinks (e.g.,
methane dissolution in pore space by Xu et al. \[2001\] and Buffett and
Archer \[2004\]). Archer et al. \[2009\] assume that most migration of
methane liberated from hydrate within the sedimentary section occurs as
rising bubbles, which could open sediment pathways that bypass AOM or
dissolution in pore waters and allow a larger proportion to reach the
seafloor \[Knittel and Boetius, 2009; Thornton and Crill, 2015\].

Water column methane sinks are increasingly being incorporated into
numerical models of climate-hydrate interactions as knowledge of methane
stripping from rising bubbles \[e.g., Koweek et al., 2016; Leifer and
Patro, 2002; McGinnis et al., 2006\] and aerobic methane oxidation in
the water column \[e.g., Mau et al., 2013; Valentine et al., 2001\]
becomes better established. [Models are beginning to acknowledge that
[most CH4 bubbles]{.mark} emitted at the seafloor at water depths deeper
than a few tens of meters will [retain]{.mark} little or [no
methane]{.mark} by the time they reach the near-surface mixed
layer]{.underline} (Figure 8a), meaning that the primary repository of
methane liberated by gas hydrate dissociation within any deepwater
marine reservoir will be the ocean, not the atmosphere \[e.g., Biastoch
et al., 2011\]. The only hydrate-related methane source used by Isaksen
et al. \[2011\] in their atmospheric chemistry models is associated with
subsea permafrost thaw beneath circum-Arctic Ocean continental shelves,
a source of CH4 that has also been proposed by Shakhova et al. \[2015\]
for these settings. In an acknowledgement of the importance of CH4
stripping from rising bubbles, Isaksen et al. \[2011\] ignored the
atmospheric impact of possible deepwater releases of CH4 from
dissociating gas hydrate during climate events but assumed a high
end-member---no loss of methane between the seafloor and sea-air
interface---on the shallow-water Arctic shelves for myriad CH4 sources.
While focusing mostly on the seafloor emission component of the
climate-hydrates problem, Stranne et al. \[2016b\] also acknowledged
that this population of CH4 is unlikely to reach the sea-air interface
due to methane loss from rising bubbles.

As described in section 4.2, [once CH4 has dissolved in the ocean, it
becomes available for microbially driven oxidation (MOx)
processes]{.underline} \[Valentine et al., 2001\], which are a strong
sink (Figure 7) for methane in intermediate ocean layers \[e.g., Mau et
al., 2013\]. [Because MOx rates rely on a complex set of parameters,
including a priori microbial populations, water depth, temperature,
ocean chemistry, ocean currents \[Steinle et al., 2015\], and the
concentrations of oxygen and the CH4 itself, relatively [few]{.mark}
climate-hydrate [models]{.mark} have attempted to explicitly
[incorporate the **MOx sink**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This sink has been
considered in models evaluating the potential impact of non-hydrate
seafloor CH4 emissions \[Kessler et al., 2011\] on the ocean and
atmosphere, but in these cases substantial data were available to
constrain the role of MOx \[Du and Kessler, 2012\]. Biastoch et al.
\[2011\] incorporated MOx in their Arctic Ocean climate-hydrate models
by assuming that 50% of the methane released at the seafloor is consumed
in the water column, resulting in lowering of pH (acidification) and
depletion of oxygen, while Archer et al. \[2009\] completed one scenario
in which all seafloor CH4 emissions are oxidized in the water column,
eventually releasing about 25% of the product CO2 to the atmosphere.
However, no model has directly investigated the incorporation of
CH4-derived CO2 into other oceanic carbon cycles (Figure 7), such as the
biological pump \[Kessler, 2014\], a factor that may limit the
interaction of this CO2 with the atmospheric. A global hydrate-climate
model that specifically focuses on MOx variations by region was
formulated by Elliott et al. \[2011\]. They explored the possibility
that MOx may be so vigorous in some locations following a climate-driven
release of CH4 from gas hydrates that some deep ocean basins may become
oxygen-depleted. This would allow CH4 to accumulate and increase the
likelihood of diffusive sea-air methane transfer. Unfortunately, the
assumed seafloor methane emissions from dissociating gas hydrate in
Elliott et al. \[2011\] did not also account for the strong sediment
methane sinks that are likely to substantially reduce the methane
entering the water column in the first place.

[The final CH4 sink sometimes missing from more geologically focused
climate-hydrates models is the atmospheric one. Failure to include this
sink can lead to overestimation of the radiative warming of the
atmosphere owing to the stronger greenhouse potential of CH4 relative to
CO2]{.underline}. The early model by Harvey and Huang \[1995\] focused
on methane emissions from the sediments and considered neither sediment,
water column, nor atmospheric sinks. This is one reason why their models
predict climate warming elevated by up to several degrees above baseline
cases when hydrate-related CH4 emissions were included. Other models
from the same era \[e.g., Fung et al., 1991\] included atmospheric
sinks, although separating the impact of CH4 released from gas hydrate
from that of other methane sources is not possible. Archer et al.
\[2009\], who did include the atmospheric CH4 sink, showed that either
of their fossil fuel-driven warming scenarios (hydrate-derived methane
directly crossing the sea-air interface or being oxidized in the water
column, with a fraction of the resulting CO2 entering the atmosphere)
resulted in enhanced warming (0.4--0.5°C) of the atmosphere. There is
also a need for less simplification in accounting for the atmospheric
methane sinks. For example, Isaksen et al. \[2011\] explicitly
incorporated water vapor, CO2, and intermediate products of atmospheric
methane oxidation in their model to constrain greenhouse forcing, an
approach that could enhance other models focused on climate-hydrates
interactions. Coupled with the emergence of better data on CH4 emissions
to the atmosphere, a fuller treatment of atmospheric chemistry processes
in models could provide more reliable insights into the direct, as well
as indirect, effects of CH4 on climate over the full range of the
timescales of interest for unraveling climate-hydrate interactions.

7.3 Oceanographic Conditions

[[Another challenge]{.mark} for the credibility of some models for
climate-hydrate interactions [is]{.mark} the widespread practice of
[adopting geographically uniform oceanographic conditions]{.mark},
particularly for increased bottom-water temperatures that drive gas
hydrate dissociation over large areas. About [two-thirds of]{.mark} the
increased [heat]{.mark} content of the oceans since the midtwentieth
century [resides in the upper 700 m of]{.mark} the water column
\[Levitus et al., 2012\], meaning that upper continental slopes are most
affected]{.underline} (section 6.4). In addition, [[the Atlantic]{.mark}
basin has [absorbed an outsized portion of]{.mark} the excess
[heat]{.mark}]{.underline} \[Lee et al., 2011\]. These observations
underscore the need to appropriately account for regional variations and
to move away from deterministic approaches that apply instantaneous step
function bottom-water temperature changes. Lamarque \[2008\] used the
predictions made by IPCC \[2007\] climate models for ocean bottom-water
temperature changes under the global warming scenario corresponding to
an increase of 1% yr−1 in CO2. He determines that 5--21 Tg yr−1 CH4
(4--15.75 Tg yr−1 C) might be released by dissociation of gas hydrates
due to warming bottom waters, although the estimate does not explicitly
include some of the other sinks and caveats explored above. Marín-Moreno
et al. \[2015\] extended this approach a step further for the West
Spitsbergen margin, using bottom-water changes based on historical
records and those predicted by nine climate models and climate scenarios
to predict 97--1050 Tg C emitted from upper slope gas hydrate
dissociation by 2100. Hunter et al. \[2013\] used fewer scenarios over
the same time period and estimated that atmospheric methane release that
originates in dissociating hydrates may range from 0.75 to 1.4 Tg yr−1
CH4 once the water column oxidation sink is taken into account.

The [breakdown of **methane hydrates** due to warming **climate** is
**unlikely** to lead to massive amounts of **methane** being released to
the **atmosphere**]{.underline}, according to a recent interpretive
review of scientific literature performed by the U.S. Geological Survey
and the University of Rochester.

Methane hydrate, which is also referred to as gas hydrate, is a
naturally-occurring, ice-like form of methane and water that is stable
within a narrow range of pressure and temperature conditions. These
conditions are mostly found in undersea sediments at water depths
greater than 1000 to 1650 ft and in and beneath permafrost (permanently
frozen ground) at high latitudes. [**Methane hydrates** are distinct
from conventional natural gas, shale gas, and coalbed methane reservoirs
and are not **currently exploited** for energy production, either in the
United States or the rest of the world.]{.underline}

On a global scale, gas hydrate deposits store enormous amounts of
methane at relatively shallow depths, making them particularly
susceptible to the changes in temperature that accompany climate change.
Methane itself is also a potent greenhouse gas, and some researchers
have suggested that methane released by the breakdown of gas hydrate
during past climate events may have exacerbated global warming.

Summary of the locations where gas hydrate occurs beneath the seafloor,
in permafrost areas, and beneath some ice sheets, along with the
processes (shown in red) that destroy methane (sinks) in the sediments,
ocean, and atmosphere. The differently colored circles denote different
sources of methane. Gas hydrates are likely breaking down now on shallow
continental shelves in the Arctic Ocean and at the feather edge of gas
hydrate stability on continental margins (1000-1650 feet). Credit:
Ruppel and Kessler (2017).(Public domain.)

The [new review concludes that **current warming** of ocean waters is
**likely** **causing gas hydrate** deposits to break down at some
locations.]{.underline} However, not only are the annual emissions of
methane to the ocean from degrading gas hydrates far smaller than
greenhouse gas emissions to the atmosphere from human activities, but
most of the methane released by gas hydrates never reaches the
atmosphere. Instead, the [**methane** often remains in the undersea
sediments, dissolves in the ocean, or is converted to **carbon dioxide**
by **microbes** in the sediments or water column.]{.underline}

The review pays particular attention to gas hydrates beneath the Arctic
Ocean, where some studies have observed elevated rates of methane
transfer between the ocean and the atmosphere. As noted by the authors,
the methane being emitted to the atmosphere in the Arctic Ocean has not
been directly traced to the breakdown of gas hydrate in [**response** to
recent **climate change**, nor as a consequence of longer-term
**warming** since the end of the last Ice Age.]{.underline}

"Our review is the culmination of nearly a decade of original research
by the USGS, my coauthor Professor John Kessler at the University of
Rochester, and many other groups in the community," said USGS
geophysicist Carolyn Ruppel, who is the paper's lead author and oversees
the USGS Gas Hydrates Project. "After so many years spent determining
where gas hydrates are breaking down and measuring methane flux at the
sea-air interface, we suggest that conclusive evidence for release of
hydrate-related methane to the atmosphere is lacking."

Gas hydrate (white, ice-like material) under authigenic carbonate rock
that is encrusted with deep-sea chemosynthetic mussels and other
organisms on the seafloor of the northern Gulf of Mexico at 966 m
(\~3170 ft) water depth. Although gas hydrate that forms on the seafloor
is not an important component of the global gas hydrate inventory,
deposits such as these demonstrate that methane and other gases cross
the seafloor and enter the ocean. Photograph was taken by the Deep
Discoverer remotely operated vehicle in April 2014 and is courtesy of

and Research Program.(Public domain.)

Professor Kessler explains that, "[Even where we do see **slightly
elevated** emissions of methane at the sea-air interface, our research
shows that this methane is rarely attributable to gas hydrate
degradation."]{.underline}

The review summarizes how much gas hydrate exists and where it occurs;
identifies the technical challenges associated with determining whether
atmospheric methane originates with gas hydrate breakdown; and examines
the assumptions of the Intergovernmental Panels on Climate Change, which
have typically attributed a small amount of annual atmospheric methane
emissions to gas hydrate sources.

The review also systematically evaluates different environments to
assess the susceptibility of gas hydrates at each location to warming
climate and addresses the potential environmental impact of an
accidental gas release associated with a hypothetical well producing
methane from gas hydrate deposits.

Virginia Burkett, USGS Associate Director for Climate and Land Use
Change, noted, "This review paper provides a truly comprehensive
synthesis of the knowledge on the interaction of gas hydrates and
climate during the contemporary period. The authors' sober, data-driven
analyses and conclusions challenge the popular perception that warming
climate will lead to a catastrophic release of methane to the atmosphere
as a result of gas hydrate breakdown."

The response of biogeochemical cycles to anthropogenic perturbations can
be abrupt at regional scales and 9 irreversible on decadal to century
time scales (high confidence). [The probability of crossing uncertain 10
regional thresholds increases with climate change (high confidence). It
is **very unlikely** that gas clathrates 11 (mostly methane) in deeper
terrestrial permafrost and subsea clathrates will lead to a detectable
departure]{.underline} 12 from the emissions trajectory during this
century. Possible abrupt changes and tipping points in 13 biogeochemical
cycles lead to additional uncertainty in 21st century atmospheric GHG
concentrations, but 14 future anthropogenic emissions remain the
dominant uncertainty (high confidence). There is potential for 15 abrupt
water cycle changes in some high-emission scenarios, but there is no
overall consistency regarding 16 the magnitude and timing of such
changes. Positive land surface feedbacks, including vegetation, dust,
and 17 snow, can contribute to abrupt changes in aridity, but there is
only low confidence that such changes will 18 occur during the 21st
century. Continued Amazon deforestation, combined with a warming
climate, raises 19 the probability that this ecosystem will cross a

Growing interest in the social consequences of climate change has fueled
speculation that global warming could lead to an increase in various
forms of political violence. Here, I examine the effects of climate
change on interstate conflict subsequent to the onset of European
industrialization. Surprisingly, global warming appears in preliminary
analysis to be associated with a reduction in interstate conflict. This
naive relationship is suspect, however, as the inc[reased consumption of
carbon-based fuels is itself tied to changing patterns of politics and
prosperity.]{.underline} In particular, [economic development has been
associated with both climate change and interstate peace]{.underline}.
Incorporating measures of development, democracy, trade, and
international institutions reveals that [systemic trends toward peace
are actually best accounted for by rising average international
income]{.underline}. The results further suggest that efforts to curb
climate change should pay particular attention to encouraging clean
development among middle-income states, as these countries are the most
conflict prone. Ironically, stagnant development in middle-income states
caused by efforts to combat climate change could actually realize fears
of climate-induced warfare.
