#### Exploration and development of the Arctic is systemtically tied with capitalism -- reducing the Arctic to a mere economic value to be capitalized on

Old colonialisms and the new: legacies, continuities and further issues

[While contemporary projects of economic development in the Arctic have
reached new scales]{.underline} and exploit new resource frontiers, they
[are closely related to the continuity of 'old' Arctic
colonialisms.]{.underline} In their development, the [perpetuation of
the settler-colonial logic of capitalist economic
development]{.underline} coupled with reasons of the Euro-American
polities that claim the Arctic as part of their territory constitute the
basis of 'Arctic geopolitics'. [Another new element is the growing
importance of the Arctic as a **geopolitical hotspote** in world
politics.]{.underline} While [**economic reasons** are an important
driver for territorial reorganizations in the Arctic,]{.underline}
national security and defence issues also play an important part in such
processes. The reorganization of military structures and the
redefinition of military strategies and objectives in the Arctic -- seen
in Russia, in the US and Canada, encompassing all of the Inuit homeland
-- points to a tendency of increased control being exercised over
hyperborean spaces by States.

[The emergence of neo-extractivist capitalist development21) might be
the defining feature of emerging Arctic colonialisms. **Neo-extractivist
capital accumulation** is characterized by pressure over natural
resources and the demand for greater capitalist control over space,
reinforcing a relationship between humanity and nature based on the
**economic value** of land and natural resources.]{.underline} While
colonial projects attempt to recast themselves as necessary in the face
of external threats or as the [reasonable way of seizing the Arctic
resource boom,]{.underline} their objectives are similar to those of old
colonialisms: [subsume indigenous territories and subjectivities under
the logic of capitalist accumulation and extending State (and capital)
control over the populations that inhabit them.]{.underline} It is
possible to note that, if their scale and methods are somehow different
from eighteenth and nineteenth century colonialisms, they still
represent a continuity of the colonial project. Moreover, the long
history of the nefarious impacts of colonialism and the deep
disarticulation it brought to the Inuit peoples allowed the erasure of
indigenous presences and the [emergence of **'empty Arctic' narratives**
-- used by both neo-extractivist capitalism and the national-territorial
State in legitimizing the rationale behind such projects]{.underline}

Now, there's something I must clarify before moving on. [The climate
crisis is not something that will begin sometime around 2050. **The
crisis has already begun**.]{.underline}

In fact, [aberrant weather events known as **one-in-a-hundred-year
events** have begun to occur every year in countries all over the world,
a state]{.underline} of affairs that has come to be referred to as the
"new normal." [But this is actually only the beginning. **The point of
no return is approaching**---the point at which a series of rapid
changes will occur that will make it impossible to ever return to how
things were.]{.underline}

For example, [the temperature in Siberia reached 100.4°F in June 2020.
This may be the highest temperature ever recorded in the Arctic
Circle]{.underline}. If the permafrost there were to thaw, [large
amounts of methane gas would be released, which would accelerate climate
change even more. On top of that, there's the risk of mercury leaking
into the environment, as well as of bacteria and viruses (such as the
anthrax virus) being released]{.underline}. Polar bears would also, of
course, lose the last of their habitat.

The dangers compound as the crisis worsens. Further, [once the climate
change time bomb goes off, it will set off a **chain reaction of
crises** like dominoes falling. This will lead to a **level of
destruction unable to be stopped by human hands.**]{.underline}

Therefore, [to prevent this catastrophe, scientists recommend that
average global temperatures must not rise above 34.7°F more than
pre--Industrial Revolution levels by 2100]{.underline}.

Temperatures have already risen to around 33.8°F higher than those
levels, which means that we must act now to keep them below 34.7°F.
[Speaking concretely, this would entail **lessening carbon dioxide
emissions by nearly half by 2030** and reducing **net emissions to zero
by 2050**.]{.underline}

[If, on the other hand, emissions continue at their present rate, the
rise in global temperatures will pass 34.7°F by 2030 and may even reach
a maximum of 39.2°F by 2100]{.underline}. There are, of course,
[attempts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions]{.underline} occurring
right now all over the world, including the Paris Agreement, but these
attempts [are **woefully inadequate**]{.underline}; it's said that they
will still result in a rise of 37.76°F over preindustrial levels by the
end of this century, a rise that is close to Nordhaus's model favoring
technological advancement and economic growth as the most efficient way
to combat climate change.

[THE DAMAGE FORECAST FOR DEVELOPED COUNTRIES]{.underline}

The 34.7°F temperature rise has yet to occur, but already in the early
2020s, we've seen flooding in Pakistan that submerged a full third of
the country's land while Africa faced massive starvation due to a severe
drought. [If temperatures continue their sharp rise, there is **no
reason to think that developed countries will emerge unscathed**. A
35.6°F rise in temperature would spell the extinction of
coral]{.underline} and deal a serious blow to the fishing industry.
[Heat waves in summer will have **grave effects on harvests**. Wildfires
in dry regions like California and Australia will worsen,]{.underline}
while every summer, typhoons and hurricanes will continue to grow and
batter coastlines worldwide.

Torrential rainfall will also get worse. Where I live, in Japan, the
cost of the damage caused by the 2014 torrential rains in western Japan
exceeded one trillion, two hundred billion yen. Ever since that first
disaster, Japan has seen comparable torrential rains every year all over
the country, causing the cost of rain-related disasters to keep rising.

Moreover, the thawing of the ice sheets at the South Pole and similar
places is predicted to lead, in eighty years' time, to devastating rises
in ocean levels. [If the worst-case scenario comes to pass, there is a
possibility that American cities like New York and San Francisco,
including many of their famous landmarks, will be
**submerged**]{.underline}. San Francisco's world-renowned Fisherman's
Wharf will be completely underwater, and One World Trade Center in
Manhattan will be reachable only by boat.

At the global scale, the number of people who would have to evacuate
their current homes is in the hundreds of millions. [The **global food
supply** would no longer be able to support the population]{.underline}.
And economic damage would also be serious; some calculate the cost at
upward of \$27 trillion annually. [This kind of **damage would continue
indefinitely**.]{.underline}

[THE GREAT ACCELERATION]{.underline}

Of course, most of [the responsibility for climate change falls squarely
on the shoulders of those of us living in the Global North]{.underline}.
According to British charity Oxfam, the amount of carbon dioxide emitted
by the richest 10 percent of the planet's population makes up more than
half of total worldwide emissions. Cars, airplanes, large houses, meat,
wine---[sustaining lifestyles]{.underline} that include these things
[requires **a huge amount of resources and energy**]{.underline} to be
wasted for the benefit of a very small portion of humanity. [Considering
the sheer scale of the irreversible effects that climate change will
bring about for future generations, it's unforgivable for us not to do
something about it while we still can]{.underline}. Now is the time to
call for great change and to concretely bring it about. I propose that
this great change should be nothing less than a challenge to the
capitalist system itself.

But before presenting this seemingly unrealistic demand, I must first
address the origins of the environmental crisis now presenting itself in
the form of climate change.

Here I would like to include the results of studies conducted by Will
Steffen and other researchers belonging to the Australian National
University Institute for Climate Energy & Disaster Solutions. According
to them, human economic activity following the Industrial Revolution
greatly increased the burden on the environment. [As the human
population and energy consumption increased, the atmosphere became
filled with more and more carbon dioxide while the destruction of
rainforests reached devastating levels]{.underline}. This activity
increased even more rapidly after the end of World War II, as did the
resulting burden on the environment, and this dramatic increase is
referred to as the Great Acceleration. This acceleration only increased
following the end of the Cold War. This age of acceleration cannot
continue indefinitely. The trajectory of the Anthropocene is heading
nowhere but toward total destruction.

[\[Condensing Paragraphs\]]{.underline}

But how did this state of affairs come about? To clarify the origins of
the crisis, we must first understand the relationship between the
globalization of capitalism and environmental destruction. This will be
the subject of the rest of this chapter. THE REPEATED MAN-MADE DISASTERS
INFLICTED ON THE GLOBAL SOUTH Looking back at the history of capitalism,
we can see various sorts of tragedies underpinning the enriched
lifestyles enjoyed by those in the Global North. One might say that the
contradictions of capitalism are distilled into the phenomenon of the
Global South. Even if we concentrate on just the most spectacular
disasters of recent years---oil spills in Russia, Mauritius, and
Venezuela, the wildfires devastating the Amazon rainforest precipitated
by the rapacious spread of multinational agribusiness, two failed dams
in central Michigan caused by excess rainfall---there are too many to
count. The scope of the damage is wide. The 2019 collapse of a dam in
Brumadinho, Brazil, resulted in the deaths of more than 250 people. The
dam was owned by Vale, one of the top three resource exploitation
companies in the world, and was used to dam up iron ore tailings---the
slurry of water and mineral by-products produced by the ore sorting
process. A similar accident had occurred previously at another Vale
tailings dam in 2015, but this time, careless mismanagement resulted in
a collapse that caused hundreds of thousands of tons of toxic slurry to
engulf a nearby village in its flow.6 Tailings covered the entire area,
resulting in the pollution of rivers and grave damage to the ecosystem
overall. Are these kinds of disasters simply the results of bad luck? Of
course not. The danger that such accidents would occur was repeatedly
pointed out by experts, workers, and the people living in the area. And
yet, government and industry prioritized cost cutting over developing
effective measures to prevent the disaster.7 These are entirely
predictable disasters known as man-made disasters. Even so, the Global
North may well choose not to care about these incidents occurring in
distant places like Mexico and Brazil. There may be readers who think
these events have nothing to do with them. But make no mistake, all of
us living in the developed world are complicit in these man-made
disasters. Furthermore, these incidents can happen in the Global North,
too; see, for example, the Keystone Pipeline oil spill in 2022 and the
train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, in 2023. These are classic
cases of the capitalist push for profit at all costs leading to climate
catastrophe and lasting consequences for the health of local
populations. In any case, the iron in our cars, the gasoline they
consume, the cotton woven into our clothes, the beef in our gyūdon
bowls: these are the things that come to us from these "distant" places.
Our rich lifestyles would be impossible without the plundered natural
resources and exploited labor power of the Global South. THE IMPERIAL
MODE OF LIVING IS BASED ON THE SACRIFICE OF OTHERS German sociologists
Ulrich Brand and Markus Wissen gave a name to the lifestyle of people in
the Global North that is based on the extraction of energy and natural
resources from the Global South. They call it the Imperial Mode of
Living (imperiale Lebensweise). The Imperial Mode of Living refers,
essentially, to the societies of the Global North that rely on
large-scale production and consumption. This is what makes our rich
lifestyles possible. Beneath this surface, there exists a structure by
which the cost of our consumption is extracted from the lands and labor
of the people of the Global South. Without the exploitation of others
who pay the cost, the Imperial Mode of Living would be unsustainable.
Lowering the standard of living for those in the Global South is a
prerequisite for the workings of capitalism, and the power imbalance
between North and South is no anomaly---it is, in fact, a result of the
system functioning normally.8 We experience this way of life as
desirable, though, and are loath to give it up. If we were to
acknowledge the state of things in the Global South, we would be forced
to lower our own standard of living. Our way of life is, in fact, a
terrible thing. We are all complicit in the Imperial Mode of Living. Let
me give an example of what I mean. The fast fashion we have so
thoroughly incorporated into our way of life is often produced by
Bangladeshi laborers working in the worst conditions. You may recall the
famous incident of 2013 at the Rana Plaza in Dhaka, where a huge
building that housed five garment factories collapsed, resulting in more
than a thousand people losing their lives. Further, the cotton that goes
into the clothing produced in Bangladesh is cultivated by poor farmers
in India working in oppressive 104°F+ heat.9 Ever-increasing demand from
the fashion industry has led to the widespread use of genetically
modified cotton plants. As a result, farmers lose possession of their
own seeds and are forced instead to borrow money to purchase genetically
modified ones, along with chemical fertilizer and pesticides, every
year. When crops fail due to drought or heat waves, the farmers end up
accumulating more and more debt, and it's not uncommon for this to drive
them to suicide. The tragedy I've outlined here depends on the normal
functioning of global capitalism, just as, for structural reasons, the
Global South depends on the production and consumption that goes into
the Imperial Mode of Living. As I've previously stated, Brazilians
understood the danger of the tailings dam in Brumadinho. The exact same
type of accident had happened before. And yet, despite this, they were
forced to continue mining; the laborers had to work at the mining site
to support their own lifestyles, and they were also forced to live close
to the mine. In the case of the garment factories in Rana Plaza, the
workers had noticed irregularities in the walls and pillars, but their
warnings were ignored. Moreover, the farmers in India realize that
pesticides harm their bodies and the natural world. But they are forced
to keep working and producing regardless, in order to satisfy worldwide
demand, as the fashion industry and agribusiness keep growing and
growing to satiate the unlimited desires of consumers who want whole new
wardrobes every season. In this way, increases in human and
environmental sacrifice result in increases in profit for major
industry. This is the logic of capital. EXTERNALIZATION SOCIETY RENDERS
SACRIFICE INVISIBLE Of course, the hard-to-hear truth outlined above has
been pointed out many times before. But as soon as we throw a little
money at it via charitable donations, we forget about it again. This
forgetting is possible because the incidents in question are rendered
invisible in our daily lives. The Munich University sociologist Stephan
Lessenich has pointed out that this passing along of costs to somewhere
far away, and rendering them invisible because of the twenty-four-hour
news cycle and the attention economy, is indispensable to the "richness"
enjoyed by societies in the Global North. He critiques this tendency,
calling it "externalization society." Those in the Global North enjoy
rich lifestyles enabled by the sacrifices of those in the Global South.
Further, Lessenich points out that those in the Global North work to
maintain this exceptional status not just for today, but for the
foreseeable future. "Externalization society" refers to the process by
which a society tirelessly creates an "outside" so as to pass along the
various burdens necessary to maintain itself. This is the only way our
present society has been able to thrive and flourish.10 BOTH WORKERS AND
THE ENVIRONMENT ARE OBJECTS OF EXPLOITATION The relationship between
capitalism as it is practiced in Global North countries and the
sacrifices of the Global South can perhaps be summed up by referring to
the "world systems" approach of American sociologist Immanuel
Wallerstein. As Wallerstein saw it, capitalism relies on an opposition
between "core" and "periphery." Cheap labor is extracted from the
periphery known as the Global South, and the core raises its profits by
driving down the price of the goods produced by that labor. This unequal
exchange of labor power is what brings about the overdevelopment of
developed countries and the underdevelopment of developing ones,
according to Wallerstein. However, as capitalism's global reach has
extended to every corner of the world, new frontiers to plunder in this
way have disappeared. (The digital space is today's latest and last
frontier of capitalism.) The profit-seeking process has reached its
physical limit. The resulting plunge in profits makes economic growth
and the accumulation of capital difficult, leading some to even declare
that this spells the end of capitalism.11 But what I want to point out
in this chapter is what comes next. Human labor power is the object of
exploitation that most concerns Wallerstein, but this reveals only one
side of how capitalism works. The other side of things is, naturally,
the global environment. The object of capitalism's exploitation is not
just the labor power of the periphery but also the environment of the
entire Earth. Natural resources, energy, and food are all plundered from
the Global South via unequal exchange with developed countries.
Capitalism uses humans as tools for accumulating capital but can profit
from the natural world by simply plundering its resources directly. This
is one of this book's most fundamental assertions.12 Therefore, it is
only to be expected that as long as it aims for unlimited economic
growth, a global system of this sort will place the world's environment
in danger. THE EXTERNALIZATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL BURDEN Simply put, if we
expand Wallerstein's theory, we can see how the economic growth of the
core has necessitated the plundering of natural resources from the
periphery while at the same time shifting the costs underlying this
growth onto the periphery as well. Let's look at the example of palm
oil, which has played a major role in contributing to the shadow our
food consumption has cast across the world. Not only is palm oil cheap,
it doesn't oxidize easily, and this has led to its widespread use in
processed food, sweets, and fast food. When eating out, it can be
difficult to find foods without palm oil. Palm oil is produced in
Indonesia and Malaysia. The area needed to cultivate the palms used to
produce palm oil has increased exponentially since the beginning of this
century, leading to rapid deforestation as the tropical rainforest is
cleared to make room. This sudden spike in palm oil production affects
more than just the ecosystem of the tropical rainforest. This kind of
large-scale development has destructive effects on people who depend on
the rainforest to sustain their way of life. For example, the clearing
of the rainforest to make way for farmland has caused soil to erode,
fertilizer and agrichemicals to pollute rivers and streams, and fish
populations to decrease. People living in the region used to depend on
the fish in the streams for protein, and without that, they're forced to
spend more money on processed food. This has led to the people in the
area sullying their hands with the illegal trade of species on the brink
of extinction, such as tigers and orangutans, in order to obtain that
money. In this way, the inexpensive, convenient lifestyle of the core is
underwritten not only by the exploitation of the periphery's labor but
also by the extraction and destruction of natural resources and the
environmental burden that goes with that. Furthermore, the damage
brought about by the environmental crisis is not borne equally by the
global population. The environmental burden tied to the production and
consumption of food, energy, and other raw materials falls on the
shoulders of some much more than others. As Lessenich, the vocal critic
of the Global North as externalization society, puts it, the primary
condition making our rich lifestyles possible is the passing of these
burdens onto the people and natural resources of "some faraway place" so
that the true cost is never paid by the end consumer. THE DENIAL OF
WRONGDOING AND PROCRASTINATION'S JUST DESERTS The Imperial Mode of
Living is reproduced again and again as we go about our daily lives
while the violence of sustaining it occurs in some distant place and is,
as such, rendered invisible. We hear the words "environmental crisis"
and, like a Catholic buying an indulgence, we purchase reusable shopping
bags or organic cotton T-shirts. But there are always newer versions of
these eco-bags and organic T-shirts hitting the market. Inspired by
advertisements, we go out and buy the newest ones, and then the newest
ones after that. And the sense of satisfaction and accomplishment we
gain by buying this form of indulgence means we are unconcerned with the
violence against the people and environments of the distant lands
involved in producing a reusable bag or T-shirt. This is what it means
to be caught up in greenwashing as devised by capital. Those of us
living in the Global North are not just compelled into ignorance of the
transfer of our lifestyle's cost to the Global South. We are also
compelled to internalize to an extreme extent the sheer desirability of
the Imperial Mode of Living. We hold on to blissful ignorance and are
afraid to look directly at the truth. "I don't know" evolves naturally
into "I don't want to know." But don't we know deep down that our
comfortable lives come at the expense of others forced to live in
comparative misery? We merely see this injustice as something that has
nothing to do with us, and so we look away from it. We cannot stand to
look the truth in the face, so although we know we are the cause of
injustice, we secretly want the current order to continue.13 This is how
the Imperial Mode of Living becomes ever more deeply entrenched, and our
response to the current crisis ends up being put off to a future time
that never comes. In this way, each and every one of us is complicit in
perpetuating injustice. But the just deserts for this procrastination
have already begun filtering back into the core.

[\[Paragraph Integrity Resumes\]]{.underline}

[ARE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES KINDER TO THE ENVIRONMENT? THE NETHERLANDS
FALLACY]{.underline}

Once again, pointing these things out is nothing new. A similar debate
erupted in the 1970s and '80s as issues of responsibility for
environmental damage and the North-South problem came to the fore. One
example of this is the so-called Netherlands Fallacy.

The way of life enjoyed by people who live in a country like the
Netherlands places a heavy burden on the Earth. However, the air and
water pollution in such a country is comparatively low. By contrast,
countries in the Global South suffer many environmental issues, such as
air and water pollution, waste disposal problems, and so on, despite the
people in these countries living comparatively modest lifestyles.

What produces this seemingly contradictory state of affairs? One way to
explain it is to point to technological advances. [The technology
brought about by economic growth enables "advanced" countries to reduce
and dispose of pollutants that damage the environment.]{.underline}

But to celebrate the economic growth of developed countries for
lessening the pollution in those countries is the essence of the fallacy
here, which Nordhaus has fallen into, as seen at the beginning of this
chapter. [The environmental improvements occurring in developed
countries result not just from technological advances but from passing
along most of the **negative by-products** of economic
development---resource extraction, waste disposal, and the
like---outward onto the periphery represented by the Global
South]{.underline}.14

[To ignore the international transfer of the burden of environmental
impact and to assume that the Global North has solved its environmental
problems simply through technological advances and economic growth is
what is known as the Netherlands Fallacy.]{.underline}

THE ANTHROPOCENE AND THE EXHAUSTION OF THE PERIPHERY

One way to understand the Anthropocene, when human economic activity has
reached every corner of the world, is as an era when the periphery
needed to perform this plunder-and-cost transfer has effectively
disappeared.

[Capital has always strived to **extract everything it can**---all the
oil, all the nutrients from the soil, all the rare metals, and so
on---from the world. This is known as extractivism, and it has placed an
enormous burden on the Earth]{.underline}. But just as the frontiers
needed to gain profits from cheap labor power have started to disappear,
the cheaply available natural resources of the periphery have also begun
to reach the point of exhaustion, no longer able to perform their role
as repositories of displaced environmental damage and plunderable
riches.

[No matter how well capitalism seems to be functioning, **there will
always be a limit** on the resources available for exploitation. The
disappearance of a sufficient "outside" to externalize into a periphery
has resulted in the negative consequences of extractivism's spread
coming back home to roost in the Global North.]{.underline}

This is a problem that even the power of capital cannot overcome.
[Capitalists strive toward unlimited increases in value, but the Earth
is not unlimited. Once the periphery is exhausted, things can no longer
function the way they have up until now. A crisis will
begin]{.underline}. This is the essence of the crisis plaguing the
Anthropocene.

Could there be a better example of this than the accelerating climate
change crisis? As the periphery is exhausted, [the disasters associated
with climate change---the superhurricanes, the wildfires, and so
on---become more and more conspicuous even in the developed
world.]{.underline}

So the question becomes, now that time has definitively run out for
addressing climate change, what can we possibly do to stop it?

WASTING TIME AFTER THE END OF THE COLD WAR

There's a famous quotation attributed to the economist Kenneth E.
Boulding that goes, "[Anyone who believes that exponential growth can go
on forever in a finite world is either a madman or an
economist]{.underline}." Half a century has passed since he said that,
and yet we still single-mindedly pursue economic growth despite how
severe the climate crisis has become or how much destruction we visit
upon the Earth. This is how deeply this economist-minded way of thinking
has rooted itself into our daily lives. We may all be madmen these days.

Children, though, remain sane. It took young Swedish environmental
activist Greta Thunberg to expose the hypocrisy of the measures to
combat climate change dreamed up by adults. Only fifteen years old at
the time, this high schooler, who became famous for her School Strike
for Climate sharply criticized politicians who, in an attempt to court
votes, "only speak of green eternal economic growth." She said this
during an address to the United Nations Climate Change Conference
(COP24) in 2018.15

Thunberg's point was that as long as capitalism prioritizes economic
growth above all else, the climate change problem will never be solved.
And indeed, it's hard not to agree with this assessment. After all,
capitalist society wasted its opportunity to combat climate change
during the crucial thirty years following the end of the Cold War,
preferring instead to concentrate on pursuing the money-making
opportunities opened up by globalization and financial market
deregulation.

Looking back to 1988, NASA scientist James Hansen testified before the
US Congress that he was "99 percent confident" that climate change was
caused by human activity. That year also saw the formation of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) by the United Nations
Environmental Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization
(WMO).

There was hope for climate change to be solved with international
agreements and treaties. And indeed, if solutions had truly started to
be implemented at that time and carbon dioxide emissions had started
decreasing even at the leisurely pace of 3 percent per year, it would
have been possible to solve the problem this way.

But Hansen's warning turned out to be ill-timed. The Berlin Wall fell
soon after he spoke, ushering in the fall of the Soviet Union, and
American-style neoliberalism spread throughout the entire world.
Capitalism was handed a new frontier to exploit in the form of the cheap
labor and marketplaces now accessible in the former Soviet Union and its
satellite states.

This great expansion of economic activity resulted in a similarly great
acceleration in the consumption of resources. To take one example,
almost half of humanity's total consumption of fossil fuels throughout
history occurred in the years following the end of the Cold War in
1989.16

Nordhaus's article on climate change, with its naïve predictions about
how much carbon dioxide emissions needed to be reduced in order to
combat it, came out around that time as well. This is how a crucial
thirty years that could have been used to develop effective climate
change solutions was wasted, resulting in the greatly worsened situation
we find ourselves in now.

This is why Greta Thunberg's criticism is so forceful and
passionate---it comes from her anger at the irresponsibility of adults
who wasted this precious chance to do something because they could only
think about what was right in front of their faces. The actions of
politicians and other elites who still prioritize economic growth above
all else and whose attitudes haven't changed one bit only pour fuel on
the fire of this anger. As Thunberg put it, "You don't listen to the
science because you are only interested in solutions that will enable
you to carry on like before. Like now. And those answers don't exist
anymore. Because you did not act in time."17

Thunberg pointed out that the system that created a problem will never
lead to its solution and ended her address to the COP24 by saying,
"Change is coming, whether you like it or not." Young people around the
world have responded with fervent support for her and her message.

If we are to properly respond to the clarion call of young people, we
adults must first look directly at what lies at the heart of the present
problem and then work to create a new system to replace it. Perhaps it
goes without saying, but the system Greta Thunberg indicts for offering
no solutions is capitalism itself.

[MARX'S CLIMATE CRISIS PROPHECY]{.underline}

A passing glance at the history of capitalism is enough to tell us that
[the likelihood of government and industry coming up with a plan of
sufficient scope to effectively combat climate change is **basically
nil**. All capitalism has ever done is **shift the costs and burdens**
of resource extraction onto the peripheries it has created]{.underline}.
The ill effects of the contradictions in the system are displaced onto
distant lands while actual solutions are put off again and again.

The fact is, capitalism's creation of peripheries onto which to shift
the costs of its workings---and the injustice of this---was pointed out
as far back as the mid-nineteenth century by Karl Marx himself.

Marx's main point was this: capitalism displaces its contradictions
elsewhere and thus renders them invisible. This displacement only makes
the contradictions worsen, deepening the quagmire into an increasingly
disastrous state of affairs. Capital's attempts to displace its ill
effects can only result in collapse. According to Marx, this is the
ultimate, insurmountable limit of capital.

To ascertain capitalism's limits, we should use Marx's writings to trace
three fundamental forms of displacement or "shift": technological,
spatial, and temporal.

TECHNOLOGICAL SHIFT---DISTURBING THE ECOSYSTEM

The first form of displacement is the attempt to overcome an
environmental crisis through technological advancement, as Nordhaus
suggested. Marx's example of this is soil depletion due to agriculture.
His main reference was the work of his contemporary, the German chemist
Justus von Liebig, who criticized then-current agricultural practices as
"robbery of the soil."

According to Liebig, nutrients in the soil---namely inorganic substances
like phosphorous and potassium---are converted by the natural breakdown
of rocks into forms usable by plants. Because this process is extremely
slow, [the amount of nutrients in the soil that can support plant growth
at any given time is finite]{.underline}. Therefore, we must use
fertilizers to replace the inorganic substances taken out of the soil by
crops like grains in order to maintain the soil's fertility. Liebig
called this the law of compensation. In short, this law states that
agriculture can only be sustained if the nutrients in the soil are
sufficiently replaced.

However, the advancement of capitalism led to a division of labor
between farming villages and urban centers whereby the crops cultivated
in rural locations were sold to workers living in cities. This meant
that the nutrients extracted by the crops consumed in the city never
returned to the soil from whence they came. Instead, they were consumed
and digested by urban workers and then deposited into flush toilets that
expelled them into rivers and streams.

Problems arose from conducting agriculture under capitalism as well.
Agricultural businessmen became concerned primarily with the short-term
bottom line, preferring to profit from serial cultivation of the same
land over leaving fields fallow to allow their nutrients to be renewed.
Funds used to maintain the soil, such as those used for irrigation
systems and the like, were also cut to the bare minimum. Capitalism
always prioritizes short-term profits. This produces a "rift" in the
soil's metabolic cycle whereby nutrients are never returned to the land
and are instead only extracted from it, leading to its exhaustion.
Liebig raised the alarm about the danger this represented, calling the
irrational agricultural management system whereby long-term
sustainability is sacrificed in the name of short-term profitability a
"robbery system" that would eventually lead to the collapse of European
civilization.18

However, history shows that the depletion of soil did not lead to the
civilizational crisis Liebig foretold. Why not? One answer is the
discovery of the Haber-Bosch process by which ammonia can be created
industrially, a discovery that allowed large amounts of chemical
fertilizer to be made at a low price. But this discovery did not in fact
heal the rift produced by the contradictions of capital. It merely
displaced its effects.

The Haber-Bosch process produces ammonia (NH3) not just by using
nitrogen (N) from the air but also hydrogen (H) extracted from fossil
fuels (primarily natural gas). This of course means that [a huge amount
of fossil fuels are needed to satisfy the fertilizing needs of the
world's farmland]{.underline}. Indeed, the amount of natural gas used to
create ammonia this way constitutes 3--5 percent of the world's total
output.19 In other words, modern agriculture replaces the original
nutrients in the soil by using up another nonrenewable natural resource.
And of course, the [production process also emits large amounts of
carbon dioxide into the atmosphere]{.underline}. This is the fundamental
nature of the contradictions produced by technological shift.

Furthermore, [the development of **industrialized agriculture** that
uses large amounts of chemical fertilizer has led to **myriad other
issues caused by nitrogen compounds polluting the environment**, from
**nitric acid contamination of groundwater** to the **red tide blooms**
caused by the eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems. In this way,
technological shift eventually triggers large-scale environmental
problems]{.underline} ranging well beyond the simple exhaustion of a
single tract of land.

But even this is not the end of the story. [Soil ecosystems disturbed by
large-scale use of chemical fertilizers end up losing their ability to
retain moisture, while **crops and livestock become increasingly
vulnerable to disease**]{.underline}. Yet the marketplace demanding
cheap agricultural products is unyieldingly uniform in scale and size,
necessitating modern agriculture to use more and more chemical
fertilizer, agrichemicals, and antibiotics to meet this growing demand.
And it goes without saying that these chemicals also end up leaking into
the environment and disturbing ecosystems.

Even when damage occurs, the industries at the root of these problems
claim that no cause-and-effect relationships can be proven, thus
avoiding offering any compensation to those affected. And of course,
many environmental problems are of a sort that even if compensation were
forthcoming, things could never be restored to their original state.
[**Technological shift does not solve problems**. Rather, the excessive
use of technological solutions only deepens the contradictions
underlying those problems.]{.underline}

SPATIAL SHIFT---EXTERNALIZATION AND ECOLOGICAL IMPERIALISM

After technological shift, the next form of displacement I want to
address is spatial. Marx addresses this form of displacement using the
example of soil depletion as well.

The Haber-Bosch process had yet to be discovered in Marx's time, so the
main form of fertilizer used to replenish the soil was guano. Huge
populations of seabirds gather off the coast of Peru and deposit
enormous amounts of excrement there, creating a petrified concentration
of sediments referred to as guano. These deposits build up into
veritable islands of the stuff.

Since guano is the dried excrement of birds, it contains many inorganic
substances necessary to cultivate crops, and gathering and using it is
relatively simple. In fact, Indigenous people in the area traditionally
used guano to fertilize their own crops. The European who discovered the
marvelous utility of guano was Alexander von Humboldt, who conducted a
biogeographical survey of South America at the beginning of the
nineteenth century.

Following its discovery, guano became famous as the force that would
save the world from soil depletion, and vast amounts of it were exported
from South America to Europe and the United States. Thanks to guano,
English and American farmland could be sustained and continue to produce
the foodstuffs necessary for the urban workforce.

But this, too, ultimately failed to heal the rift. Large numbers of
workers were pressed into service to extract guano and send it far away.
This led to the violent exploitation of both the Indigenous peoples of
South America and as many as 90,000 Chinese laborers. Moreover, the
sudden decline in seabird populations in the area led to a similarly
sudden decline in the resource guano that represented.20 The exhaustion
of this resource ended up touching off the Guano and Saltpeter Wars
(1864--66 and 1879--84, respectively).

As this example makes clear, solving a problem through displacements
that benefit only the core constitutes what we now call ecological
imperialism. Ecological imperialism relies on the plunder of the
periphery while shifting the ill effects of the problems brought about
by that plunder back onto the periphery as well. In this way, these
actions end up placing even heavier burdens on the local peoples and
ecosystems that struggle to sustain themselves, further deepening the
severity of the contradictions they were meant to resolve.21

TEMPORAL SHIFT---APRÈS MOI, LE DÉLUGE!

The last of the three forms of displacement is temporal shift. Marx's
example of this form of displacement was the overharvesting of
forestland, but the clearest example of how it works in the present age
is climate change.

There is no question that large-scale consumption of fossil fuels causes
climate change. At the same time, the effects of climate change do not
all appear immediately. There is sometimes a time lag of decades before
you can witness these effects. Capital uses this lag to reap as much
profit as possible from the drilling equipment and pipelines it has
already invested the money to create.

Capitalism reflects the opinions of shareholders and business owners
living in the present and therefore ignores the voices of future
generations, creating yet another type of externality by shifting the
burden of environmental damage to the future. The present generation
profits from the sacrifice of future generations.

There may be those who see this form of temporal shift in a positive
light, who think that in fact provides the time necessary for technology
to advance to the point at which the crisis may be averted. And indeed,
there are scholars who, like William Nordhaus, believe that instead of
cutting carbon dioxide emissions so severely that it would have a
negative impact on the economy, it would be wiser to encourage economic
growth and allow societies to become rich enough that technological
progress will take care of the problem for us.

But [even if such marvelous new technologies were to be discovered, it
would still take a long time for them to be adopted effectively across
society. **This wastes precious time**, as the crisis will continue to
worsen as the positive **feedback loop speeds up while we wait** for a
hypothetical new technology to spread]{.underline}, resulting in a much
more serious environmental crisis in the meantime. This might well mean
that it will become too serious for this new technology to adequately
address anymore. [The promise of a technological solution will thus
**end in betrayal**]{.underline}.

[As the positive feedback effect is allowed to amplify, it will
naturally begin to have a **negative effect on economic activity** as
well]{.underline}. If new technologies are unable to catch up with the
speed of the environment's destruction, [it will soon be something
humanity will be unable to address at all, and **future generations will
be doomed**]{.underline}. And this will also, of course, negatively
affect economic activity. In other words, future generations will not
only be consigned to live in extremely cruel conditions, but their
economic situation will also be dire.

This is perhaps the worst possible outcome of all, one that constitutes
the most compelling reason not to leave climate change to be solved by
technology but rather to stop it here and now by addressing its root
cause.

THE PERIPHERY'S DOUBLE BURDEN

We have now explored the three displacements outlined by Marx. Capital
will forever find ways to displace the negative effects of its workings
onto the periphery it creates.

As a result, the periphery faces a double burden. After suffering from
the plunder of ecological imperialism, it finds itself forced to bear an
unequal burden of the destructive effects of capital's displacements.

For example, the South American nation of Chile cultivates avocados for
export. They are highly prized by the Global North as part of a "healthy
lifestyle"---that is, as part of the Imperial Mode of Living. The
cultivation of avocados, affectionately called "butter of the forest" in
Japan, necessitates the use of huge amounts of water. Further, because
avocados take so many nutrients from the soil as they grow, once land is
used to cultivate them, it's very difficult to use it to grow anything
else. In other words, Chile has sacrificed its own water supply and its
capacity to produce its own food to cultivate this export crop.

Chile is now facing major droughts as well as serious water shortages.
These problems are attributable to climate change. And as we've already
seen, climate change itself can be seen as the consequence of
capitalistic displacement. In the midst of this dire situation, the
COVID-19 pandemic occurred. But instead of their precious water being
used for the handwashing and hygiene necessary to combat the pandemic,
it was used to grow more avocados for export. This was due to the
privatization of the water supply.22

In this way, the negative impacts of climate change caused by the
consumerist lifestyle enjoyed by the developed world and the deleterious
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic were visited most severely upon the
area most vulnerable to both: the periphery.

**[THE WORLD WILL END BEFORE CAPITALISM DOES]{.underline}**

One way to see the situation is as one in which risk and chance are
distributed extremely unequally. The periphery must always lose so that
the core may win.

Of course, the core is not entirely exempt from the impacts of the
natural world's worsening condition. But thanks to displacement,
capitalism is unlikely to be dealt a blow that would seriously threaten
its ability to function. To put it another way, [by the time people in
developed countries are ready to look the problem in the face, it will
already be too late to save the ecology of this limited planet. The
Earth will become **uninhabitable for humankind** before capitalism
collapses.]{.underline}

The famous American environmental activist Bill McKibben puts it this
way: "The diminished availability of fossil fuel is not the only limit
we face. In fact, it's not even the most important. [Even before we run
out of oil, we're running out of planet]{.underline}."23

This quote still holds true if we replace the words "fossil fuel" and
"oil" with the word "capitalism." [We must remember that if the planet
fails, it's **game over for humanity**. There is no planet
B.]{.underline}

THE CRISIS MADE VISIBLE

As long as we look at things only from a short-term, surface
perspective, capitalist society still appears to be functioning smoothly
(even if this apparent smoothness is increasingly threatened by factors
like war, pandemic, inflation, and the like). As countries like China
and Brazil, which have historically acted as the repositories of
displacement for the developed world, increasingly devote themselves to
their own high-speed economic development, the available space on the
planet to use as the convenient "outside" for externalization and
displacement shrinks into almost nothing. It's logically impossible for
all these countries to externalize the contradictions of their
development at the same time. But the lack of an "outside" constitutes a
death blow for our externalization society.

The reality is, as frontiers from which to extract cheap labor power
disappear, profit rates drop, and the exploitation of workers within
Global North countries intensifies. At the same time, as the
externalization and displacement of environmental burdens onto the
Global South reach their limit, the contradictions of capitalism will
start to appear more and more within those countries. Areas within
Global North countries will turn into the Global South. Those of us
living in the Global North will begin to feel the worsening of labor
conditions directly. And it will only be a matter of time before we
suffer directly from the consequences of environmental problems like
climate change as well. They will no longer be someone else's problems.

Looking back at Wallerstein's argument, we can see how these problems
are interconnected; after all, we have only one Earth to call home. As
externalization and displacement become more difficult, the tab we've
been running up will ultimately have to be paid. We've been dumping
plastic waste into the ocean and pretending it disappears, but now it's
popping back up in our daily lives in the form of microplastics in our
seafood and our water supply. The carbon dioxide we've emitted into the
atmosphere for so long has triggered the climate change now causing the
heat waves, hurricanes, and wildfires we find ourselves battling every
year.

Furthermore, the influx of refugees from Syria has become a serious
social problem for Europe, allowing for the rise of right-wing populism,
threatening democracy there. And in fact, one of the causes of the
Syrian civil war is said to be climate change. The famine brought about
by the long drought afflicting the country forced people into
desperation, paving the way for the outbreak of increasingly intense
societal conflicts.24

The United States is in a similar position. Not only has it been
suffering from an onslaught of increasingly large-scale hurricanes, but
its southern border is overrun by caravans of refugees from Honduras.
These refugees are fleeing not only violence and political instability
but also bad harvests due to climate change and the desperate
circumstances that go along with them.25 In 2019, then-president Trump
responded with cruelty to these climate refugees, detaining them in
miserable conditions while refusing to allow them into the country and
calling instead for a border wall. Many of these policies are still in
place under President Biden.

The European Union, too, is pushing out refugees seeking safety, in this
case through Turkey. But this sort of literal displacement can't
continue forever. Climate change and climate refugees render the
previously invisible contradictions of the developed world's Imperial
Mode of Living visible as concrete objects and bodies and threaten to
overturn the prevailing order once and for all.

[THE GREAT DIVERGENCE]{.underline}

[In this way, the exhaustion of the periphery is making it harder and
harder to turn a **blind eye to the impending crisis**]{.underline}. We
can no longer heedlessly proclaim, "Après moi, le déluge!" and ignore
what happens to the world after we're gone. After all, le déluge is
already lapping at our feet. Climate change is forcing humanity into
nothing less than an overdue reckoning with harsh reality and a radical
rethinking of the Imperial Mode of Living that has made us so dependent
on extractivism and externalization.

As the pending impossibility of displacement becomes clearer, though,
distrust and unease grow, leading to the strengthening of nationalist
movements. [Right-wing populists are using climate change to promote
their cause. **Food shortages, energy crises, immigration problems**,
and so on only serve to incite chauvinistic nationalism. The subsequent
division of society along these lines worsens the danger to
democracy]{.underline}. As a result, authoritarian leaders take power,
bringing about a form of rule that might best be called "climate
fascism."

But even in this moment of crisis, there is opportunity. [Climate change
can force those of us living in the Global North to finally face the
consequences of our behavior]{.underline}. The exhaustion of the
periphery makes us into victims as well. The hope is that this will lead
to broader support for movements calling for a more just world and a
radical transformation of our lifestyle.

To borrow the words of Wallerstein, [**this is the true bifurcation**, a
moment of systemic crisis, brought about by capitalism itself, leading
to systemic chaos and the emergence of new **anti-systemic
movements**]{.underline}. The exhaustion of the periphery is bringing us
all closer to a historic turning point that will render the present
system unable to function. Right before he passed away, Wallerstein
said, "The past 'normality' of externalization is a distant memory."26
If externalization can no longer occur, neither can the accumulation of
capital---at least not how it has occurred up until now. The
environmental crisis will also continue to worsen. As a result, the
justification for the continuation of the capitalist system will be
undercut, and resistance movements opposing that system will gain
strength and magnitude.

This is why Wallerstein left us with the thought that the present
moment---a time when the periphery has reached the point of
exhaustion---is a turning point in history. As capitalism collapses,
will the world be plunged into chaos, or will a different, more stable
social system replace it? This new "bifurcation" brought about by the
end of capitalism has in fact already begun.27

Rosa Luxemburg's famous slogan, "Socialism or barbarism," feels all the
more relevant again as we approach the Great Divergence of the
twenty-first century. But how can we avoid barbarism? What seems sure is
that it is already far too late for an incremental approach to reform.

What sort of large-scale, thoroughgoing measures must we take, then? In
the next chapter, I will examine one such attempt, the "hope" offered by
the Green New Deal proposed in Europe and the United States.

**[The Limits of Green Keynesianism]{.underline}**

[THE GREEN NEW DEAL---A NEW HOPE?]{.underline}

In the previous chapter, we saw that [capitalism is a system that
exploits not just humankind but the environment as well]{.underline}.
Further, it fuels economic growth by shifting the cost of that
development onto the periphery. As long as this externalization of costs
runs smoothly, those of us living in the Global North can enjoy rich
lifestyles and avoid suffering the consequences of environmental crises.
This is how we've been able to avoid thinking seriously about the true
cost of our expansive lifestyle.

[The capitalist system itself is the main reason why the environmental
crisis has become as serious as it has]{.underline}. Coddled by the
invisibility of our lifestyle's costs, those of us living in the Global
North have been able to turn our backs on reality, ignoring the faint
inkling of awareness tickling the edges of our consciousness, and now
we've run out of time to take measures to address the danger.

As we've procrastinated, the true cost of our lifestyle has become
steadily more difficult to ignore. As the time left before we pass the
point of no return shrinks to almost nothing, the possibility of
implementing major unprecedented policies at the governmental level is
being debated around the world.

One plan that has inspired much hope and expectation is the Green New
Deal. Prominent pundits in the United States like Paul Krugman, Thomas
Friedman, and Jeremy Rifkin have called for its adoption, stressing its
necessity. Politicians around the world, including Bernie Sanders,
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Yanis Varoufakis, have run for office with
the Green New Deal as part of their platforms, albeit each with
different details.

The Green New Deal, broadly speaking, involves large-scale public
spending and investment in the promotion of renewable energy and
electric cars. By creating stable, high-paying employment and therefore
more effective demand, these measures are also meant to stimulate the
economy. The expectation is that improved business conditions would lead
to greater investment, which would spur the transition to a sustainable
green economy.

This proposal reflects the wish for the return of the original New Deal
that saved American capitalism after the Great Recession of the
twentieth century. Neoliberalism has already proven to be ineffective in
the context of the Anthropocene. Austerity and "small government" are
unable to address the chronic outbreak of emergencies like pandemics,
wars, and climate change. Now is the time for a new environmental
Keynesianism---a "green Keynesianism"---to take their place. Its active
and expansionary fiscal policy aims to accelerate investments in green
infrastructure.

But can such a lovely story be true? Can a Green New Deal really save us
from the Anthropocene?

THE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY OF "GREEN ECONOMIC GROWTH"

Among those championing the Green New Deal, the person with the most
heightened expectations for the economic growth it promises is the New
York Times journalist Thomas Friedman. It also has to be framed as an
opportunity and in our case as the most important opportunity for
American renewal.28

Friedman had long argued that the wave of globalization following the
collapse of the Soviet Union and advances in information technologies
have led to a "flattening" of the Earth in which everyone is more
connected than ever. In his 2008 book, Hot, Flat, and Crowded, he argues
that by adding a "green revolution" to the mix, this flat world can
achieve true sustainability.

As one can see from the quote above, green Keynesianism offers the hope
that climate change might give us a golden opportunity for fostering
more economic growth than ever before. Phrased another way, the "green
economic growth" promised by green Keynesianism is the "last stand" for
capitalism's ability to "function normally."

SDGS---IS UNLIMITED GROWTH POSSIBLE AFTER ALL?

The most prominent symbols of capitalism's last stand are the
Sustainable Development Goals, or SDGs. The United Nations, the World
Bank, the IMF (International Monetary Fund), the OECD (Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development), and other international
organizations have all promoted SDGs as part of their passionate calls
for green economic development.

For example, a seven-nation initiative (including South Korea and the
United Kingdom) called the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate
has created The New Climate Economy Report. In its 2018 edition, this
report heaps praise on SDGs, claiming that sustainable development will
be "driven by the interaction between rapid technological change,
sustainable infrastructure investment, and increased resource
productivity." As its authors put it, "We are on the cusp of a new
economic era."29 It's clear that the elites who populate international
organizations see climate change solutions as golden opportunities for
renewed economic growth.

The truth is, the green Keynesianism championed by pundits like Friedman
and Rifkin would indeed spur further economic growth. The widespread use
of solar panels, electric cars, and quick-charging batteries, along with
the development of biomass energy, will necessitate large-scale shifts
in the economy, leading to substantially increased financial investment
and job creation. Moreover, it's undeniably true that existing social
infrastructure will have to be completely overhauled in the age of
climate crises, which will involve large-scale investment as well.

However, problems still remain. One cannot help but wonder: Is this type
of growth really compatible with the planet's limitations? Does sticking
a "green" label onto the hunger for unlimited growth really guarantee
that it won't eventually overrun the ability of the planet to satisfy
it?

[PLANETARY BOUNDARIES]{.underline}

The fact is, [even if we decide to foster economic growth to counter
climate change, there are limits we must not exceed in terms of the
amount of additional environmental burden produced by the great
transition to a sustainable economy]{.underline}. This is the opinion of
the environmentalist scholar Johan Rockström. He and his research team
presented the concept of "planetary boundaries" in 2009.

First let me explain the basic idea.

[The planetary system is supported by the **innate resilience of
nature**. But if burdens above a certain limit are placed on this
system, this resilience is lost, and the possibility arises that abrupt,
irreversible, and destructive changes will occur]{.underline}, such as
the melting of the polar ice caps or the mass extinction of plants and
animals. These are known as tipping points. Perhaps it goes without
saying, but [passing these **tipping points would spell disaster** for
humanity]{.underline} as well.

Rockström has defined the limits within which humanity can continue to
enjoy a stable existence, mapping out the thresholds demarcating [nine
sectors of planetary resilience. These nine sectors include **climate
change, loss of biodiversity**, biochemical flow of nitrogen and
phosphorous, land-system changes, freshwater use, **ocean
acidification**, ozone layer depletion, atmospheric aerosol loading, and
**pollution by chemical substances**.]{.underline}

These are the planetary boundaries. Rockström proposed a plan by which
["humanity can continue to develop and thrive" in a stable manner as
long as these boundaries are respected]{.underline}.

The concept of planetary boundaries has naturally had a strong influence
on the formulation of SDGs. They became the target values driving
technological innovation and optimization.

[CAN CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS BE REDUCED AS THE ECONOMY
GROWS?]{.underline}

The problem is that according to Rockström's calculations, [four
planetary boundaries, including climate change and loss of biodiversity,
**have already been exceeded** due to human economic
activity]{.underline}.30

This is a well-demonstrated fact. As a result of humanity's attempts to
conquer nature, [the Earth's environment has undergone **major
irreversible changes already**. This has placed humanity on a path
toward a critically dangerous point after which nothing can be
done]{.underline}. Is this a situation in which the "green economic
growth" promoted by "green Keynesianism" should really be our goal?

I want to draw attention to one of Rockström's newspaper articles, which
he published in 2019. The title of this article, published ten years
after the presentation of the planetary boundaries paradigm, is
provocative: "[Green Growth Is Wishful Thinking: We Must
Act]{.underline}."31

Up until then, Rockström had, like many of his fellow researchers,
argued that the goal of keeping global temperatures from rising less
than 34.7°F was reachable if a version of green economic growth that
remained within the planetary boundaries he'd defined was put in place.
However, in this article, that optimism is nowhere to be seen. Rather,
[he proposes to the public that it must choose between **two mutually
exclusive actions**: continuing economic growth or keeping global
temperatures from rising more than 34.7°F]{.underline}. To put it in
slightly more technical language, Rockström concludes that [decoupling
economic growth, even when adjusted to meet the 34.7°F target, and the
environmental burdens of such growth is, in reality, extremely
difficult.]{.underline}

WHAT IS DECOUPLING?

"Decoupling" might be a word seldom encountered in daily life, but it's
a term used widely in the fields of both economics and environmentalism.

Normally, economic growth increases burdens on the environment.
[Decoupling is the attempt, through new technologies, to sever the link
between economic growth and increases in environmental burden. In other
words, it's an effort to find ways to grow the economy without worsening
the impact of that growth on the environment.]{.underline} In the case
of climate change, this means developing technologies that would support
economic growth while reducing carbon dioxide emissions.

For example, the large-scale consumption of cars and housing and the
creation of infrastructure like power plants and grids as Global North
countries develop spurs their economic growth, but it also leads to huge
increases in their carbon dioxide emissions. But if these countries are
able to support this development by adopting more efficient new
technologies, the volume of carbon dioxide emissions will rise in a
gentler curve than if this infrastructural shift and large-scale
consumption occurred while relying on old technology. The classic form
this takes is the introduction of energy-saving technologies, hybrid
cars, natural gas power generation, and the like.

Lessening the increase of carbon dioxide emissions relative to what
would normally accompany increased economic growth by optimizing
technological efficiency is referred to as "relative decoupling."

[THE NEED FOR **ABSOLUTE REDUCTION OF EMISSIONS**]{.underline}

[**Relative decoupling is, unfortunately, woefully inadequate** as a
measure to combat climate change. The rise in global temperatures cannot
be curbed unless carbon dioxide emissions are reduced absolutely, not
relatively]{.underline}. The attempt to grow economically while reducing
absolute emissions of carbon dioxide is known as "absolute decoupling."

![A diagram of the different types of decoupling Description
automatically generated with medium
confidence](media/image1.png){width="4.623375984251968in"
height="2.6565080927384077in"}

Figure 3 fixes the real GDP and the amount of carbon dioxide emissions
at one point in time at one hundred, then displays the subsequent shifts
relative to that point. Looking at it, [we can see how overwhelmingly
different the amount of emissions that need to be reduced are in the
cases of absolute decoupling and relative decoupling]{.underline}.

One example of absolute decoupling is the widespread adoption of
electric cars, which emit no carbon dioxide at all. As the number of
petrol-burning cars decreases, so does the amount of carbon dioxide
emissions, while the sale of electric cars allows economic growth to
continue.

Another example of absolute decoupling is conducting business meetings
online via telecommunications technology rather than requiring people to
board airplanes and go on business trips. The shift from fossil fuel
power generation to solar power is also an example; growth continues
even as emissions decrease. The idea is to minimize the relationship
binding economic growth to increased emissions with the aim of severing
it completely. If we combined multiple measures of this sort, it would
be possible for the economy to grow while carbon dioxide emissions
decreased in absolute, not relative, terms.

One can easily see how the technologies associated with relative
decoupling differ from those associated with absolute decoupling.
Furthermore, [the technologies that would enable absolute decoupling
have yet to be widely adopted]{.underline}. This is precisely why their
adoption requires large-scale investment, and also why they represent
such a golden opportunity for fostering economic growth.

In this way, the Green New Deal trumpeted by people like Thomas Friedman
aims to reduce absolute carbon dioxide emissions to zero and keep global
temperatures from rising more than 34.7°F while allowing the GDP to grow
in the same manner it always has. Of course, [this would necessitate a
correspondingly large-scale technological revolution]{.underline}. The
Green New Deal is this century's grandest project to bring this about
and thus effect an absolute decoupling of economic growth and
environmental damage.

**[THE GROWTH TRAP]{.underline}**

When contemplating the possibility of future technological revolutions,
we can imagine renewable energy and information technologies advancing
at a pretty high speed. This is why several optimistic environmental
economists proclaim that "absolute decoupling will be relatively
simple."32

But will bringing about absolute decoupling really be so easy?

To answer this, we must ask, when will we be able to fully convert to a
carbon-free society? [It seems possible to do this, and thus reach the
zero-emissions goal, within the next one hundred years.]{.underline}

[But by then **it will be too late**. We need to remember the warnings
of scientists---that we need to reduce emissions by half by 2030 and
entirely by 2050. In other words, humanity's destiny lies in whether we
will be able to effect sufficient absolute decoupling to stop climate
change within **the next ten to twenty years**.]{.underline}

At this point, even someone like Rockström has accepted that the idea of
[fostering green economic growth through decoupling is nothing more than
"wishful thinking."]{.underline} It's impossible to effect an absolute
decoupling of sufficient scale to reach the goal of keeping global
temperature increases below the 34.7°F mark.

But why is it impossible? The answer lies in the simple yet intractable
dilemma that haunts any decoupling attempt. The dilemma is this: [as the
economy grows, the range of human economic activity grows too, which
means that the volume of **resource and energy consumption also grows**,
making it difficult to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. This is a
historical tendency.]{.underline}

In other words, [even green economic growth may cause increases in
carbon emissions and resource use in direct proportion to its success
because economic growth is historically accompanied by more frequent
consumption of bigger commodities, including ones in wasteful and
carbon-intensive industries]{.underline}. This in turn will necessitate
more and more dramatic increases in efficiency, but there is an
insurmountable physical limit to the improvement of technological
efficiency. This is the Growth Trap, a major pitfall awaiting capitalism
as it attempts to establish a zero-carbon economy. The question is, can
this trap be avoided?

To skip to the conclusion, it seems that, unfortunately, [escaping this
trap is unlikely. Sustaining a GDP growth rate of 2--3 percent would
necessitate the immediate reduction of carbon dioxide emissions by 10
percent every year in order to hit the 34.7°F target. If we leave it to
the market, the likelihood of achieving a yearly reduction rate as
dramatic as 10 percent is very low.]{.underline}

[THE PRODUCTIVITY TRAP]{.underline}

Rockström states that [once we face the Growth Trap directly, the
natural solution that comes to the fore is giving up on economic
growth]{.underline}. The reason is simple: [if we **give up on growth**
and allow the scope of the economy to contract, reaching our carbon
dioxide emission reduction **goals will become easier**.]{.underline}

## Framework

### 2NC -- Framework

#### Policy is not just a matter of [possibility]{.underline}, but of [purpose]{.underline}. Their framework guarantees [serial policy failure]{.underline}.

Applications*, Chapter 3.

If economics is the study of the allocation of scarce means in the serv-
ice of competing **ends**, we have to think rather deeply about the
nature of ends and means. Also, [policy **presupposes knowledge** of two
kinds]{.underline}: [of **possibility** and **purpose**]{.underline} and
of means and ends. Possibility reflects how the world works. In addition
to keeping us from wasting time and money on impossibilities, this kind
of knowledge gives us information about tradeoffs between real
alternatives. [Purpose reflects **desirability**]{.underline}, [our
**ranking of ends**]{.underline}, [our criteria for distinguishing
better from **worse states of the world**]{.underline}. [It does not
**help much** to know how the world works if we cannot distinguish
better from **worse states of the world**]{.underline}. Nor is it useful
to pursue a better state of the world that happens to be impossible.
[Without both kinds of knowledge]{.underline}, [policy discussion is
**meaningless**]{.underline}.1

[To relate this to **economic policy**]{.underline}, [we **need** to
consider]{.underline} two questions. First, in the realm of possibility,
the question is: What are the means at our disposal? Of what does our
ultimate means consist? By "ultimate means" we mean a common denominator
of possibility or usefulness that we can only use up and not produce,
for which we are totally dependent on the natural environment. Second,
[what **ultimately** is the **end** or **highest purpose** in whose
service we should **employ these means**]{.underline}? These are very
large questions, and we cannot answer them completely, especially the
latter. But [it is **essential** to raise the questions]{.underline}.
There are some things, however, that we say by way of partial answers,
and it is important to say them.

#### It prevents imagining solutions to [global problems]{.underline}

Toward a Politics of Impossibility." Opening Essay for a GTI Forum.

[We must start by **reject**ing conventional **foreclosures
of**]{.underline} the [**imagination**. We cannot accept that politics
is "the art of the possible" if the "**possible**" remains
**circumscribed** by]{.underline} the play of current forces of [stasis,
confining the idea of change to **policy shifts at the margin**
or]{.underline}---at the most ambitious---[elite-driven national
revolutions. The structures of state and **market remain**]{.underline}
essentially **[untouched]{.underline}** and continue to run the show.
[As long as these constraints are not removed, the **Great Transition
will be stymied**. The]{.underline} first [challenge is to find
effective ways to **subvert**]{.underline} and transform these
primordial **[structures]{.underline}**. Meeting this challenge starts
with [**liberat**ing **the mind** from ingrained conventions that
**solidify** the **ideological biases** of **modernity**]{.underline}.

If we carefully consider our own lives, we are likely to [appreciate how
many epochal public happenings had been previously deemed
"**impossible**," or only seemed possible after the fact.]{.underline} A
potent illustration of the tyranny of a status quo bias is Winston
Churchill's derisive attitude toward Gandhi during the early stages of
the rise of Indian nationalism. Dismissive of any threat to Indian
colonial rule, Churchill described Gandhi as a "malignant subversive
fanatic" and "a seditious Middle Temple lawyer, now posing as a fakir of
a type well known in the East, striding half-naked up the steps of the
Viceregal palace." The great British war leader displayed his attachment
to a Western understanding of power that had little insight into
historical circumstances vulnerable to anti-colonial nationalism.

[Similar patterns of the **seemingly impossible** happening are
**evident** in contemporary history, such as the **peaceful ending** of
**the Cold War** followed by the collapse of the Soviet Union; the
American defeat in the **Vietnam War**]{.underline} despite overwhelming
military superiority; **[China's]{.underline}** half-century
**[rise]{.underline}** from mass impoverishment and backwardness to
prime geopolitical challenger, including threatening Western mastery of
innovative technology such as AI, G5 connectivity, robotics, and genetic
engineering; [and the abandonment of apartheid by **South Africa** in
the face of **nonviolent resistance**]{.underline} from within **[and
anti-apartheid solidarity]{.underline}** from without.

What [these examples demonstrate is that our **understanding of the
scope of the possible** has been **artificially circumscribed** in ways
that protect the interests of]{.underline} various [elites
in]{.underline} the maintenance of [the status quo]{.underline}, making
it seem reckless and futile to mount structural challenges however
justified they may be morally or bio-politically. [**Such foreclosures
of imagined futures** have been key to the protection of]{.underline}
institutions like [**slavery**, **discrimination**, and **warfare** but
often remain limited in scope to specific]{.underline} locales or
**[policy areas]{.underline}**. The uniqueness of the Anthropocene is to
restrict the possible to unsustainable and [dysfunctional
structures]{.underline} and modes of behavior, while
[bring]{.underline}ing [to a head the question of finding more viable
ways of **organizing life**]{.underline} on the planet and living
**[together]{.underline}** in a manner that protects future generations.

Such foreclosures of the imagination inflict damage both by shortening
our temporal vision and by constraining our understanding of useful
knowledge. Despite what science and rationality tell us about the
future, our [leaders]{.underline}---and, indeed, most of us---[give
scant practical attention to what is needed to preserve]{.underline} and
improve the [life]{.underline} prospects for future generations. Given
the scope and depth of the challenges, responsible anthropocentrism in
the twenty-first century should incorporate a sense of urgency to
temporal axes of concern. **[We]{.underline}** now [**need a "politics
of the impossible,"** a necessary **utopianism**]{.underline} that
stands [as an avowal of the **attainability of the Great Transition**.
We must begin by **interrogating**]{.underline} the [**semantics of the
possible** as]{.underline} a cultural, political, economic, and
**[ideological construct]{.underline}** binding humanity to a system
that is increasingly bio-politically self-destructive for the species
and its natural habitat.

Closely connected to this foreclosure of our temporal vision has been a
scientifically conditioned epistemology asserting the limits of useful
knowledge. Within the most influential epistemic communities, an
Enlightenment ideology prevails that sets boundaries limiting productive
intellectual inquiry. The positive legacies of the Enlightenment in
grounding knowledge on scientifically verified evidence rather than
cultural superstitions and religiously guided prejudice and dogma are
real and important, but there have been costs as well. Notably, a bias
against subjectivity discourages normative inquiry and advocacy, which
is dismissed as "non-scientific." The noted Confucian scholar Tu
Wei-Ming has powerfully criticized the impact of what he calls
"instrumental rationalism" on the capacity of Western civilization to
embrace the value of empathy, which he views as integral to human
dignity and humane governance.

We need a moral epistemology to achieve responsible anthropocentrism,
exploring right and wrong, and distinguishing between desirable and
diminished futures, not as matters of opinion, but as the underpinnings
of "normative knowledge." Universities, split into specialized
disciplines and privileging work within the Enlightenment paradigm, are
largely oblivious to the need for a holistic understanding of the
complexities and solidarities with which we must grapple in order for
humanity to extricate itself from present structures that divide and
fragment the human experience, strangling possibilities.

It may be helpful to distinguish "the feasible," "the necessary," and
"the desirable" to further illuminate "the pursuit of the impossible."
In short, "**[the feasible]{.underline}**" [from the perspective of the
**status quo** seems incapable]{.underline}, under the best of
circumstances, [of achieving "**the necessary**" and "**the
desirable**."]{.underline} [We]{.underline} will [need to pursue "**the
desirable**" to mobilize]{.underline} the [capabilities needed to engage
effectively in realizing "**the necessary**."]{.underline}

[If existing conditions continue]{.underline}, the bio-political destiny
of [the human species seems destined for dark times]{.underline}. In the
past, before the Nuclear Age, we could ignore the future and address the
material, security, and spiritual needs of bounded communities, and
success or failure had no ramifications for larger systems. Now [we
must]{.underline} find ways to [**attend to the whole**, or the parts
will **perish** and likely **destroy one another in the
process**]{.underline}. St. Francis found some fitting words for such an
emancipatory path: "Start by doing what is necessary, then what is
possible, and suddenly you are doing the impossible."

#### Their interp [intrinsically]{.underline} undermines the experience of marginal communities and creates social corruptions.

We emerge to critical thought in interaction with the limitations of the
worlds we inhabit, but we can also bear their destructive traces and
enact their exclusions in spite of ourselves. Aiming for generality, we
can arrive instead at a disavowed parochialism, a "universality" that is
[suspiciously **intimate** with]{.underline} and defensive of the
[**contingent** specificities of **our ways**]{.underline} of life.
Thinking can thereby become a tool for concealing parochialism,
[immunizing **destructive** social habits from
**criticism**]{.underline}, and preventing perception of and engagement
with that which could build our capacity for generality. It is
particularly the decolonial critique of Eurocentrism in philosophy and
intersectional analysis and its critique of feminism that have
illuminated this critical problem and inspired this paper. Decolonial
critique targets what Santiago Castro-Gomez calls "zero-point hubris":
"the **[imaginary]{.underline}** according to [which an observer of the
social world can **situate** themselves on a **neutral**
observation]{.underline} platform that, in turn, cannot be observed from
any point" (2021, 8). Coloniality is thus, as Nelson Maldonado Torres
argues, the "systematic [**negation** of **sociality** and ordinary
forms of **interhuman** contact]{.underline}" (2012, 262) [in favour of
the **imposition** from outside of principles construed as
**universal**]{.underline}. Kimberlé Williams Crenshaw (1989) shows how
theory and antidiscrimination law are dominated by a "**[singleaxis
framework]{.underline}**" that, as Elena Ruíz (2018) notes, [produces
"**social**]{.underline}, institutional, and juridical [systems that are
structurally **unresponsive** to the]{.underline} needs,
[situations]{.underline}, and concerns [of historically **oppressed**
communities]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} in fact may [be the
**source** of harm]{.underline}" (Ruíz 2018, 341). "Single-axis
thinking" has encouraged feminists, for instance, to perpetuate the
oppression of certain women in its complicity with
**[anti-Black]{.underline}** racism (Davis 1983), transphobic oppression
(Bettcher 2021), capitalism (Fraser 2013), ableism (Hirschmann 2012),
and "colonial feminism" (Ahmed 1992) or "gendered Orientalism"
(Abu-Lughod 2013), as those dominant within the group-formations that
stand to benefit from struggle against oppression hoard its successes
(Táíwò 2022).4 The point of this paper is not to do the situated,
practical analysis that Ruíz flags as the focus of intersectional work,
but rather to show specifically how philosophy should self-consciously
revise its practices and [**universality** be reconceived so as to
answer]{.underline} to the [risks of]{.underline} zero-point hubris and
[**single-axis** thinking]{.underline}. In the first section, I explore
phenomenologically the **[lived experience]{.underline}** of being
situated within a perspective, rehearsing the argument that situatedness
[produces in us a **partiality** and "single-axis thinking]{.underline}"
that [**separates** us from others who live in **different**
terms]{.underline}. I distinguish, however, the phenomenologically
revealed partiality of perspective associated with our basic existential
situation from the historical, practical domination that renders certain
forms of partiality general and powerful in defining the terms of social
reality. In the second section, I show that we can inhabit the
irreducibly partial specificity of our basic existential condition in
ways that do not prevent but enable the effectiveness of struggle
against and theoretical descriptions of domination. In other words,
partiality is inevitable, and it often admits of political organization
that conceals or expands it, but it is possible for us to live our
partiality in a way that does not simply operate according to the
necessarily one-sided terms by which we are inducted into being human.
Through partiality, the meaning of the [**experience** of
others]{.underline} can become concrete to us. Here I will show that
thinking itself must be reimagined: it [is **not**]{.underline} a matter
of a choice between specificity and **[universality]{.underline}**, for
it is within and through the crux of the specific that we catch a
glimpse of the horizon of universality. At the heart of human
experience, the issue of the simultaneously enabling and inhibiting
character of specificity is a richly developed point of study in the
tradition, and thus, phenomenological reflection on how experience
unfolds can contribute to analysis of this problem. This paper relies in
particular on Maurice Merleau-Ponty's (1964a) "The Philosopher and
Sociology" for its insight into, first, how we are initiated into
meaningful experience by specific forms of life, and second, how
[**communication** and a **particular** kind of universality
remain]{.underline} possibilities for us even in our inhabitation of
determinate and [mutually **unfamiliar** forms of
experience]{.underline}. The paper's ultimate commitment is captured by
Merleau-Ponty's claim that "superficially considered, our inherence
destroys all truth; considered radically, it founds a new idea of truth"
(Merleau-Ponty 1964a, 109). \<\<\<CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>\> Because
the paper's theme is specificity and its relation to thinking, it is
important to identify where my efforts toward philosophical thinking
have found their origin and impetus. I am a white, middle-class settler
woman without, as Walter D. Mignolo calls it, "the colonial experience
and political interest propelled by the colonial wound" (2009, 170). My
efforts themselves are a colonial artifact, a by-product of my
implication in the dispossession and subordination of others. In answer
to Socrates' profound question to Cephalus, I have inherited wealth, not
made it (Plato 1968, 330a). My aim is to make the inevitably flawed
effort, against the grain of my cultivation, to think not from the
terrain established by "centrisms" but to think of and with the
exteriority projected by them, to attend to the scenes of profound
injustice to which all are accountable: entrenched economic
exploitation; the organization of the globe according to racist,
colonial, and ableist priorities; the ongoing suppression of genders and
sexualities that do not reflect the priorities of the generic
heterosexual man. We are enveloped in systems that suppress and exploit
human power, and our efforts to struggle against them require thinking
with others, with the exteriorities these systems constitute. My desire
is to investigate the living realities of human experience that make
shared effort in this regard both difficult and possible. SPECIFICITY
AND ITS AMBIVALENCE Who we are as human individuals is profoundly a
function of others and the availability of specific worlds to us. This
interdependence renders us specific and one-sided, reflecting the
priorities of those who induct us into humanity and the characteristics
of the specific environments we inhabit, which support and dissuade
different activities and attitudes. The worlds to which we adapt do not
have the same dimensions as what we might project as the "actual" world
beyond any actual experience, or as the worlds of others, yet their
specificity tends to be somewhat invisible to us. Merleau-Ponty captures
the sense of this specificity when he observes that the "individual
drama takes place among roles which are already inscribed in the total
institutional structure, so that from the beginning of his life the
child proceeds---simply by perceiving the attentions paid to him and the
utensils surrounding him---to a deciphering of meanings which . . .
generalizes his own drama into a drama of his culture" (1964a, 112;
emphasis in original). "Attentions" and "utensils" are the vehicles of
specification that circulate around us: forms of human behaviour and
material expression of historical priorities that demand we assume them
in order to be counted as a piece of the real world. There are many
dimensions to this specificity. It is familial, reflecting our intimate
community, its lineage, its style of inhabiting the world. Who we are
unfolds as a response to the specificity of our familiar others.
Specificity is cultural, stamped by the qualities of its contextualizing
environment. We speak a certain language, use a certain generation's
slang, manifest trends in how we dress, make a living in specific ways,
and so on. While there are significant differences within cultures, we
nonetheless have a basic familiarity with cultural options that
qualifies us as "insiders," a status hard won by others. Specificity is
also political; societies have made specific decisions about operation
and self-organization that render them different from others, though
their functioning depends on treating many of these decisions as not
contingent but necessary. Our interpretations of reality settle into the
grooves made by these more primordial interpretations, yet it is only by
participating in specific worlds with specific others that we develop as
participants in "reality." The development of the capacity to make sense
bears the traces of particular forms of sense-making and how these forms
are demonstrated to us, and any perspective we take on this inheritance
is mediated by it. We implicitly reflect what has always been
demonstrated to us as "normal" even when we explicitly take ourselves to
reject it. While this can seem and be oppressive to both insiders and
outsiders, it is not simply an oppressive matter: only by being embedded
in organized systems of meaning do we develop and become capable of
relating to further others. Further, no such context could include
everyone; location is necessary, and it depends on exclusion.5
Importantly, I am using "we" here in a way I construe to be universal.
This is the case for all of us, and it renders us irreducibly different
from each other. We share the condition of specificity, and so our
experience diverges. And this unshareability is only exacerbated by the
fact that our specificity is not transparent to us. \<\<\<PARAGRAPH
INTEGRITY RESUMES\>\>\> Merleau-Ponty gives the term "[perceptual
**faith**]{.underline}" [to the epistemic **orientation**]{.underline}
to the world that develops in this condition. This is the faith that "we
see the things themselves, the world is what we see": it is a trusting
"contact" that precedes and "[**exceeds** \[reflection's\] power of
**comprehension**]{.underline}" (1968, 3; 1964a, 104). Thinking emerges
on the basis of this primordial contact, in which the distinction
between true and false is already meaningful to us and others, and the
world is already real. Thinking cannot disavow the original condition of
perceptual faith and can never grasp it in the way it actually happens.
It can only point to it in the mode of what Merleau-Ponty calls
"hyper-reflection," which would put "to itself the problem of the
genesis of its own meaning" (1968, 38, 12).
"**[Objectivism]{.underline}**" in thinking, as Merleau-Ponty's critique
goes, takes the true to be the objective and takes knowing to be that
which exposes its true reality, and in so doing [**disregards** the
lived **experience** of integration between **experiencer** and
object]{.underline}, the original, non-reflective contact out of which
objects of reflection and reflective powers emerge [and to which they
owe an **undischargeable debt**]{.underline}. [It disavows the murky
**ancestry** of thinking]{.underline}. While we can expose
phenomenologically the non-perception of the lived present, the
decolonial critique of Eurocentrism and the intersectional critique of
feminism expose the politically constituted non-perception of the lived
present.6 Alongside the philosophical critique of objectivism extends a
political critique of domination: reflection operates on the basis of a
disavowed history of domination. The scene behind the scenes that
phenomenology illuminates, while a necessary condition of experience as
such, is in turn shaped by a specific political history. While the
condition of specificity is universal, forms of specificity are
organized differently in relation to each other, and the way they are
organized differently shapes how we live them. This organization entails
different epistemic capacities and orientations for different kinds of
people. While those whose specificity links them with the dominant ways
of life can be ignorant of the specificity of others, the converse is
typically not the case. Given the power associated with dominant ways of
life, familiarity with them can be the price people pay to make their
way in the world. One thinks here of W. E. B. Du Bois's (2015) notion of
"double-consciousness"7 and of James Baldwin: "ask any Negro\[black
person\] what he knows about the white people with whom he works. And
then ask the white people with whom he works what they know about him"
(1993, 103; emphasis in original). To use Lewis Gordon's (2006) powerful
metaphor, [to **live** on the basis of the **dominant** code
is]{.underline} to have the cat's reach over the mouse: the cat has a
sphere of influence that goes well beyond the immediate coordinates of
tooth and claw. Its reach "extends to the area over which it can move
faster than the mouse; thus, run though the mouse may try with all its
might, the cat will seem to pop up everywhere" (2006, 42). The shared
familiarity of the dominant code [is an effect of
dominance]{.underline}. Another's orientation to the world must in some
sense become familiar to me---as that by which I orient myself---if the
reality it projects is [the **reality** I am **forced** to reckon
with]{.underline}.

This thesis investigates the United State's interests in the [Arctic
region as it has transitioned into a large Arctic region player over the
past few decades]{.underline}. As climate change opens up the Arctic
region, [more international players have entered the
region.]{.underline} However, the increased international spotlight has
led to heightened tensions in the region. [Geopolitical tensions and
expanding economic opportunities are **driving states** to issue
strategies concerning their position and interests in the Arctic
region.]{.underline} Many scholars and researchers have criticized the
U.S. for its sudden involvement in the region, prompting questions
regarding its sincerity and underlying interests in the region. This
study conducts a two-part discourse analysis to compare the formally
stated interests of the U.S. Arctic Policies with the underlying
discourse and interests expressed by U.S. political actors in their
statements about the Arctic, Alaska, and Greenland. The analysis covers
the period from 2009 to the beginning of 2023. The discourse findings
are analyzed under the theoretical framework of
[neocolonialism,]{.underline} **[capitalism]{.underline}**, and human
securitization theory. The main finding is that the U.S. Arctic
Policies' strategies and interests differ from the discourse of U.S.
political actors, [with economic opportunities and military security
being the main interests of the U.S. in the Arctic region]{.underline}.
U.S. Arctic interests are more concerned with domestic priorities than
foreign ones. As [U.S. **Arctic interests** are driven by neocolonialism
motives and **capitalistic behaviors**, the human security of non-state
actors in the Arctic is hindered, such as the Arctic Indigenous
peoples.]{.underline} The U.S. focuses more on the human security of
Alaskan natives than other Arctic States' Indigenous peoples. The U.S.
Arctic Policies are published to ameliorate its reputation, as all the
[U.S. Arctic interests are based on U.S. securitization, **not
cooperation**.]{.underline} Concluding that the U.S.'s Arctic Policy
priorities do not align with the interests found within the U.S.
political actors' discourse about the Arctic. Suggesting that the U.S.
has underlying interests in the region that promotes its priorities over
being an Arctic ally.

### 1NC -- Rhetoric

#### The 1AC's rhetoric of "crisis" links to the perpetuation of climate change and the disproportionate suffering of Black and Indigenous communities, women, and the lower class. 

Julie **Ha '24** (Julie Ha, Bachelor\'s in Comparative Literature and
Creative Writing, Binghamton University, Pipe Dream Opinions Editor,

The notion that [climate change will affect us all]{.underline} and,
therefore, will require all of our attention not only operates within a
fundamentally utilitarian framework that privileges some lives over
others, namely climate refugees who have already been forced to pay
attention, but [also utilizes the language of crisis to preserve a
system that will inevitably lead lives of insecurity, here or elsewhere,
in the media or not.]{.underline} Alexandra Kollontai's 1923 essay,
"Make Way for Winged Eros: A Letter to Working Youth" has been
incredibly influential to personal beliefs. Kollontai interrogates the
role of love, comradeship and solidarity within leftist politics and
ultimately argues for a praxis determined and motivated by love. Any
other catalyst would fail to account for intersections in identities and
further alienate ourselves from one another. For example, a blanket
Marxist approach to politics may neglect the abolishment of "property"
in heteronormative relationships and an advocacy centering housing as a
human right may neglect the systemic displacement of indigenous folk. In
both examples, morality comes into play and may serve as the motivation
behind individuals' activism. However, and to Kollontai's point, without
the force of genuine love for humans, different and alike, activism
quickly becomes stale and even performative. When considering the rise
of performative activism on social media, where platforms provide plenty
of space to state a cause but fail to transform rhetoric into action,
many critiques go beyond its self-serving project[. On the one hand,
reposting an infographic helps create the illusion of caring without
actually carrying the emotional and moral burden of caring]{.underline}.
Even further though, performative activism runs the risk of viewing
systemic problems as single, isolated issues insofar as the nuances, or
lack thereof, can be captured in a single post. Kollontai's proposition
for a leftist politics based on love, comradeship and solidarity is
especially important in the context of our current climate crisis --- a
solution which focuses on saving the most amount of lives as possible
comes a little too [late as climate change has already devastated many
lives, disproportionately those of women and the low and middle-class.
Seventy percent of those in low and middle-income countries are born
female, whose vulnerability to climate change is exacerbated by lack of
health needs, especially maternal care, poor air quality and especially
in domestic quarters and lack of economic ownership, which is a daunting
issue post natural disasters and extreme weather events.]{.underline}
Scientific American describes climate anxiety as an "overwhelmingly
white phenomenon" as "Climate change and its effects --- pandemics,
pollution, natural disasters --- are not universally or uniformly felt
--- [the people and communities suffering most are disproportionately
Black, Indigenous and people of color]{.underline}." Sure, framing the
impact of climate change to be as expansive and of the greatest
magnitude possible is effective at mobilizing as many people as
possible. However, climate change is not just a utilitarian issue. It is
a problem worthy of concern before "all of us" feel its effects, because
many --- especially those that are non-white --- are facing
displacement, starvation, poverty, etc. due to our warming planet
already. Oftentimes, this [utilitarian rhetoric lands as "just code for
white people wishing to hold onto their way of life or to get 'back to
normal.'" **While rhetoric may seem like the least of our concerns with
a deteriorating planet, it's actually the key to a sustainable
solution** --- a solution that does simply mean preserving economic and
gender inequalities so that "all of us," namely white people, may
continue to live comfortably]{.underline}. When we describe our current
deteriorating climate as a sort of "crisis," we must also ask ourselves
what type of world is not in a perpetual state of crisis. [**The
language of crisis overlooks the fact that insecurity, a warming
climate, displacement and racial and economic inequalities are
inevitable in a capitalist world, which produces crises experimentally
to justify structural changes that reinforce the rule of capital.** This
is also known as the shock doctrine]{.underline}, a term coined by
cultural critic Naomi Klein, who breaks down [how capitalism exploited
catastrophes such as Hurricane Katrina and the Iraq War to further
neoliberalism. Will we be permanently reliant on the mass-produced,
micro-plastic-full products as well as the sustainability promises of
large corporations to cope with our warming planet? With our lack of
clean water, shelter or even fresh food?]{.underline} A climate "crisis"
applies to everyone and necessitates changes on the level of government
and market. However, we need to be wary of the rhetoric we use to
describe climate change --- [the language must reflect the systemic ways
in which among "all of us," some are at more risk or are already
affected by the climate.]{.underline} It's valid that climate change
worries us, as it should --- nothing ever beats the end of the world.
And when the end of the world is staring at us right in eye, we must ask
ourselves, when was life ever "normal?"

Despite the global alarm caused by accelerating climate change,
[hydrocarbon companies are exploring and opening up new oil and gas
fields all over the world,]{.underline} [**including the
Arctic**.]{.underline} With increasing attention on the Arctic,
[companies address the growing **global environmental pressure** in
their public marketing]{.underline} in various ways. This article
examines the webpages of Norwegian Equinor and Russian Gazprom & Gazprom
Neft. Building on feminist discussions, I analyse the different
justification strategies these [fossil fuel companies working in the
Arctic utilise in order to support their ongoing
operations.]{.underline} This article concludes that in order to justify
their operations in the Arctic, the Norwegian and Russian companies
emphasise values based on discourses that have historically and
culturally been associated [**with masculine practices**, such as the
control of nature enabled by technology.]{.underline} These
justifications are thus reinforcing the narrative of [the Arctic as a
territory to be **conquered and mastered.**]{.underline} Even though the
companies operate in different sociopolitical contexts, the grounds of
justification are rather similar. Their biggest differences occur in
their visual presentations of gender, which I argue is part of the
justification. Approaching the fossil fuel industry from a feminist
perspective allows questioning the dominant conceptualisations, which
the justifications of Arctic hydrocarbon companies are based on.

#### Arctic capitalism [fuels]{.underline} resource extraction [rooted]{.underline} in profit, not [necessity]{.underline}.

The shocking speed at which the Arctic sea ice is melting should be a
wake-up call to the world that we need to phase out fossil fuels fast.
Instead [we are witnessing a **reckless gold rush** in this pristine
wilderness as]{.underline} [big companies and governments make a grab
for the world's **last untapped oil and gas reserves**.]{.underline}
Caroline Lewis, member of the committee, warned that "the race to carve
up the Arctic is accelerating faster than our regulatory or technical
capacity to manage it."

[But the record of **corporate capitalism** shows that powerful
industrial forces will do all they can to lobby governments to allow for
continued economic **exploitation** of the planet's
resources.]{.underline} According to the US Geological Survey, within
the Arctic Circle there are some 90 billion barrels of oil -- 13 per
cent of the planet's undiscovered oil reserves -- and 30 per cent of its
undiscovered natural gas. [The race for corporate profits is now
on]{.underline}, with Shell already committed to a "multi-year
exploration program" in the Arctic.

[The receding Arctic ice is a "business opportunity" for those wishing
to exploit newly available shipping routes.]{.underline} Cargo that now
goes via the Panama Canal or the Suez Canal will, in many cases, have a
shorter Arctic route, ensuring "efficiency savings" for big business.

Companies are also licking their lips at the prospect at getting their
hands on vast deposits of minerals as Greenland's ice cap recedes.

"For me, I wouldn't mind if the whole ice cap disappears," said Ole
Christiansen, the chief executive of Nunam Minerals, Greenland's largest
homegrown mining company, with his eyes on a proposed gold mining site
up the fjord from Nuuk, Greenland's capital. "As it melts, we're seeing
new places with very attractive geology."

[The precondition for the export of capital is the variation in rates of
profit, and the export of capital is the means of equalizing national
rates of profit.]{.underline} The level of profit depends upon the
organic composition of capital, that is to say, upon the degree of
capitalist development. The more advanced it is the lower will be the
average rate of profit. Besides this general factor, which is less
significant here because we are concerned with commodities on the world
market where prices are determined by the most advanced methods of
production, we must also consider some more specific factors. So pr as
the rate of interest is concerned it is much higher in undeveloped
capitalist countries, which lack extensive credit and banking
facilities, than in advanced capitalist countries. Furthermore, interest
in such countries still includes for the most part an element of wages
or entrepreneurial profit. The high rate of interest is a direct
inducement to the export of loan capital. Entrepreneurial profit is also
higher because labour power is exceptionally cheap, and what it lacks in
quality is made up by unusually long hours of work. In addition, since
ground rent is very low or purely nominal, owing to the large amount of
free land resulting either from the bounty of nature or from the
forcible expropriation of the native population, costs of production are
low. Finally, profits are swelled by special privileges and monopolies.
Where [products are involved for which the new market itself provides an
outlet very high extra profits are also realized, since in this case
commodities produced by capitalist methods enter into competition with
handicraft production.]{.underline}

[But no matter how the export of capital takes place, it always means
that the capacity of the foreign market to absorb it is
growing.]{.underline} In the past the capacity of foreign markets was an
obstacle limiting the volume of European industrial products which could
be exported. Their ability to consume was limited to the surpluses which
they had available from their natural economy, or in any case
undeveloped system of production, which could not increase its output
rapidly, and still less be transformed quickly into a system of
production for the market. It is understandable, therefore, that English
capitalist production, with its enormous versatility and capacity for
expansion, very quickly met the needs of the newly-opened markets, and
even exceeded them, so that in due course there was overproduction in
the textile industry. On the other hand, however, England\'s capacity to
consume the specific products of these newly opened markets was limited,
even though it was, of course, very much greater in quantitative terms
than that of other foreign markets. But the crucial factor here was the
qualitative nature, the use value of the products, which such foreign
markets could send back in exchange for the English commodities. In so
far as it was a matter of specialized luxury articles, \'consumption in
England was limited, while on the other hand the textile industry was
striving to expand as rapidly as possible. The export of textile
products, however, increased the import of colonial products intended
for luxury consumption, whereas the rapid expansion of textile
production required the accumulation of profit at an increasing rate
rather than its consumption through spending on luxury products. The
result was that every opening of new foreign markets by England ended in
a crisis, initiated on the one hand by a fall in the price of textile
products abroad, and on the other by a collapse of the price of colonial
products in England. Every history of English crises shows the
importance of these special causes of such crises. It is worth noting
how carefully Tooke follows the prices of colonial products, and how
regularly the earlier industrial crises are accompanied by a complete
collapse of these branches of commerce. The situation first begins to
change with the development of the modern transport system, which shifts
the main emphasis to the iron industry, while simultaneously
[transactions with the newly opened markets move increasingly towards
capital exports rather than mere trade in commodities.]{.underline}

The [export of capital]{.underline} in the form of loans itself greatly
[enlarges the capacity of the newly opened markets to absorb
imports.]{.underline} If we assume that a newly opened market is able to
export £1,000,000 in commodities, then its capacity to absorb imports -
given equal exchange - would also be £1,000,000. But if this sum of
value is exported to the country, not in the form of commodities but as
loan capital (say in the form of a state loan), then the value of
£1,000,000 which the [new market can obtain by exporting its surplus
will not serve to exchange commodities but to pay interest on
capital]{.underline}. It is therefore [possible to export to that
country a sum of value]{.underline} amounting not to £1,000,000 but say
£10,000,000 if it is sent there as capital at 10 per cent interest, or
£20,000,000 if the rate of interest is lowered to 5 per cent. This
example also shows the great significance of a fall in the rate of
interest for the capacity of a market to expand. Keen competition among
foreign loan capitals tends to reduce the rate of interest very quickly
even in backward countries and thus to increase the opportunities for
capital exports. Far more significant, however, than the export of
capital in the form of loan capital is the effect produced by [the
export of industrial capital]{.underline}, and this is why the latter is
growing in importance. For the transfer of capitalist production to a
foreign market [liberates it completely from the limitations of its own
domestic capacity to consume]{.underline}. The yield of this new
production ensures the valorization of the capital. But the newly-opened
market is by no means the only sales outlet; indeed capital in these new
territories turns towards branches of production which can be sure of
sales on the world market. Capitalist development in South Africa, for
example, is quite independent of the capacity of the South African
market, since the principal branch of production, the working of the
gold mines, has a practically unlimited market for its product, and
depends only upon the natural conditions for increasing the exploitation
of the gold mines and the availability of an adequate work force.
Similarly, the working of copper mines is independent of the capacity of
the market in the colony itself, whereas [consumer goods industries
which must sell most of their output in the new market itself very soon
find their growth restricted by the limitations on the capacity to
consume.]{.underline}

In this way the export of capital extends the limits arising from the
new market\'s capacity to consume. At the same time the introduction of
capitalist methods of transport and production into the foreign country
brings about rapid economic development, the emergence of a larger
internal market through the dissolution of the natural economy, the
expansion of production for the market, and hence an increase in the
volume of those [products which can be exported and thus serve to pay
interest on newly imported capital]{.underline}. While at one time
colonies and new markets were established mainly to provide new articles
of consumption, new capital investment is [now directed principally to
branches of production which provide raw materials for
industry]{.underline}. As domestic industry, which supplies the
requirements of capital export, grows, so the exported capital is
applied to the production of raw materials for this industry. [In this
way the products of the exported capital find a market in the home
country]{.underline}, and the narrow sphere in which production moved in
England undergoes a great expansion as domestic industry and the
products of exported capital nourish each other.

### 1NC -- 'Green' Resource Exploitation

#### Capitalism drives Arctic [exploitation]{.underline}---states compete for resources, [masking]{.underline} extraction as [green]{.underline} development.

Global Contexts\"; No Publication;

The present situation of the world as we know it is undergoing processes
of radical change that have had and continue to have disastrous
consequences for ecosystems and planetary life. [Entwined in a history
of capitalism, colonialism and industrialisation, humanity is facing the
effects of climate change]{.underline} with rising sea levels, draught,
flood and wildfires, alongside deforestation, the loss and toxification
of nature and the mass extinction of animal populations. In the Arctic,
environmental change is happening fast. For Arctic Indigenous
communities, the warming of air and sea temperatures and resulting
reduction of land and sea ice, fish and other marine species are
disappearing, as are the habitat of mammals such as polar bears, seals
and walruses. This in turn affects the food supply and social and
cultural fabric of the Indigenous communities that rely on these animals
for sustenance.\[1\] Similarly, on the Arctic tundra climate instability
in winter cause food insecurity for the reindeer, which, alongside
increased pressure from predators, reduces the herds. This again has
become a threat to the Indigenous reindeer herders' livelihood and
cultural existence.\[2\]

Alongside the rapid climate change we are witnessing in the Arctic,
various nations (Canada, USA, China, Russia, and the Nordic countries)
stake a claim to the region to secure 'their' share in its natural
resources (including Arctic fauna, oil and metals) -- frequently to
develop so-called green solutions and clean energy (such as windmill
parks and copper mines). [This move to appropriate inhabited and living
lands to harness the work of nature in projects of
development]{.underline} building economic wealth and geopolitical power
[continues the centuries-**long modus operandi of capitalism**,
colonialism and globalisation]{.underline} that has conditioned
large-scale human-initiated environmental change and fuels the current
climate crisis.\[3\]

[The foundation of human-initiated environmental change was laid with
the rise of European capitalism in the fifteenth century, which
commenced a capitalist world ecology and what Jason W. Moore terms the
Age of Capital, or Capitalocene.]{.underline}\[4\] Although 'Europe' and
the 'West' did not exist as a geohistorical force or geocultural
formation until the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, from 1450 the
European 'seats of imperial power and centers of financial might' began
large-scale, capitalist systems of environment-making that both enabled
and 'accelerated environmental transformations beyond anything known
before'.\[5\]   

Understood as a system of controlling environments that bundles economic
and social relations with and within nature, capitalism made possible a
radical remaking of nature and human relations to nature and work.\[6\]
Alongside capitalism's new forms of production that exploited and
materially changed large tracts of nature and its webs of life, a new
ideology developed that justified these intrusions. Through filters of
power-inequality relating to class, race, nation, gender and sexuality,
[capitalism in vented and operated on a separation between humanity and
nature.]{.underline} This Humanity/Nature divide was created and enacted
by the ruling class, who saw themselves as members of Humanity and
unquestionably separate from Nature. At the same time, they designated
other people and other life forms as Nature.\[7\] [Capitalism's
Human/Nature divide allowed nature, animals and humans to **become
'cheap Nature'**: an entity external to and abstracted from Humanity and
valued **only in terms of its potential to produce and accumulate
capital**]{.underline} (through unpaid labour and extraction of human,
animal and natural resources) as cheaply as possible.\[8\] [Through
capitalism, Nature came to represent 'all those forms of life and labor
that provided useful work, but were culturally and juridically excluded
from the cash nexus' -- and could consequently be put to work
cost-free.]{.underline}\[9\] [Because capitalist systems of production
exhausted the life-making capacities]{.underline} of these appropriated
relationships and forms of labor, [they harbored an **inherent need for
continuous expansion** only colonial ventures could
satisfy.]{.underline}

As evident in the history of European colonialism, capitalism's
inscription of Nature, allowed the utilisation of Indigenous and African
peoples, women, animals and natural entities as unvalued reproductive
labour. Central to this development was the advent of European
Transatlantic slavery and colonisation around 1450, which commenced a
landscape transformation (including deforestation and large-scale
monocrop plantation systems) unprecedented in speed, scale and
scope.\[10\] European Transatlantic slavery and colonisation further
allowed a total devaluation and commodification of human and other forms
of life, including the social relationships that maintained the system
and constituted the very conditions of life.\[11\]

Appreciating both the world-historical, capitalist contexts of
environmental change in the Arctic and the region's own patch-work
colonial history, 'Patterns of Environment-making: the Arctic and its
Global contexts' invites papers and discussions on histories of
colonialism and Arctic environmental change.\[12\] Through a
postcolonial, ecofeminist and world-historical framework, the creative
and scholarly research presented and discussed during the workshop
contributes knowledge on how to better understand and interpret the
current situation of climate change in the Arctic and its environmental,
cultural and social effects. Drawing on the theory and concept of the
Capitalocene, the workshop presents papers that centre on one or more of
the three following areas:

1\) the intellectual, political and practical ways in which dominant
society historically contributed to the climate crisis, through the
creation of 'cheap nature' and radical transformations of social worlds
and human relations to other humans, animals and the environment.

2\) [**historical instances** of Arctic]{.underline} Indigenous
responses and resistances to Western colonialism and capitalist
world-systems and attendant ideologies of progress and modernity, on
what grounds these resistances occurred and the alternatives they
offered.

3\) historical and contemporary Indigenous voices and aesthetic
expressions that present alternative perspectives, worldviews,
knowledges and experiences of human-nature relations in the Arctic.

'Patterns of Environment-making' builds and disseminates critical
research on the historic and continuous causes and conditions of climate
and other environmental changes in the Arctic. The workshop engages with
current debates in discourse on the Anthropocene by presenting novel
humanities scholarship nuancing and challenging the most historically
simplistic and universalising explanations of anthropogenic climate
change.\[13\] Identifying and bringing out historic and ongoing
Indigenous resistance towards, and alternatives to, the colonial and
capitalist world system's exploitation and appropriation of humans,
animals and nature, the workshop further demonstrates the ongoing
relevance and need to take Indigenous perspectives seriously and involve
local communities in [political debates and decision making concerning
**environmental change** and sustainable development in the
Arctic]{.underline}.

### 1NC -- Resource Control

#### Exploitation of the Arctic for natural resources enables capitalism to continue -- that leads to surplus extractions and a depletion of Arctic resources

extensive dimensions of post-Cold War Arctic resource extraction. Polar
Geography, 39(4), 258--273.
https://doi.org/10.1080/1088937X.2016.1234517

By many accounts, a new frontier is opening in the Arctic due to the
shrinking of the polar ice cap and the consequent unlocking of vast
resource deposits. Among media outlets in recent years, a BBC article
declared, 'Climate is driving a "'new era" in the Arctic Ocean'(Shukman,
2015), while a Bloomberg article claimed, '[Climate change is making the
Arctic's natural resources accessible for the first time' (Arnsdorf,
2014). In Foreign Affairs, analyst Borgerson (2008) contended, 'Global
warming has given birth to a new scramble for territory and resources
among the five Arctic powers' (p. 63). Regardless of whether they assign
responsibility to climate change, many actors perceive the emergence of
a new frontier ripe with economic opportunities.]{.underline} Italian

the Arctic as a 'new frontier' (Eni, 2013), while the White House's
NationalStrategy for the Arctic Region calls it 'one of our planet's
last great frontiers' (White House,2013). The generally unreflexive use
of the term 'frontier' in discourses about the Arctichinders critical
thinking about motivations for the concept's deployment and masks
themechanisms by which the region is putatitively becoming increasingly
central to globaleconomic growth, particularly in the world's urban
core, for reasons beyond meltingsea ice. [Declarations of the Arctic as
a new or last frontier also overlook lengthy histories of extraction and
problematically imagine the region as an unknown space to be
discovered]{.underline}

[Realizing the contemporary importance of resource frontiers within
world markets, Hayter et al. (2003) call for their relocation to the
core of theorizing within economic geography. They argue, 'Resource
peripheries are significant for understanding globalization as a
contemporary stage in capitalist development' (p. 19), since **natural
resources are crucial for ensuring the future of global industrial
capitalism**.]{.underline} Yet Hayter et al. (2003) onlymention in
passing one of the key drivers of remote resource extraction: cities in
the globalcore. Indeed, the term 'resource periphery' underplays the
centrality and connections ofresource frontiers to continued urban
growth. While humans have settled in andaltered sparsely uninhabited
environments since time immemorial, the emergence ofbackward linkages
between them and the metropolis and state is precisely what
makesfrontiers developments of the modern era (Richards, 2003). [The
'expansion of a metropo-litan economy into regions that had not
previously been tightly bound to its markets, andthe absorption of new
peripheral areas into a capitalist orbit' (Cronon, 1991, p. xviii)
underscore the inseparability of urbanization from frontier
expansion.]{.underline} Whereas urbaniz-ation and the advance of
industrial technology were accelerating globally during the ColdWar,
they exercised a diminished impact on Arctic extraction compared to the
dominanceof military and geostrategic imperatives. This is not to say
that export-oriented resource extraction did not occur in the Cold War
Arctic: even the USSR exported resourcesfrom its northern regions like
diamonds from Yakutia and gas from Urengoy (Jensen,Shabad, & Wright,
1983). [But overall, northern extraction was more limited in scope and
scale. It is only since the Cold War ended that global markets have
refocused on the Arctic's raw materials]{.underline} (Doel, Wråkberg, &
Zeller, 2014), a shift accompanied byrenewed imaginings of virgin
frontiers

The cumulative tendencies of natural resource production and the
accumulation of environmental degradation facilitate the scaling up of
extraction, especially in the North. Thinking about resource frontiers
like the Arctic may benefit from metaphorically borrowing physical
scientists' term 'Arctic amplification' (cf. Serreze & Barry, 2011), the
process whereby positive feedback loops of warming at the poles cause
changes in surface air and water temperature to be greater than in the
rest of the world[. The material enclosure and emptying of places like
the Arctic has also **amplified over time**, particularly now as
extraction penetrates downward and extends northward. The Arctic
resource frontier can thus be viewed within a core-periphery model in
which **capitalist processes of surplus extraction deplete peripheral
resource frontiers and enrich the core**]{.underline} (Moore,2000;
Wallerstein, 1974), typically metropolitan areas. While geopolitical
factors and state desires to support sovereignty claims are important
motivations for resource extraction at particular locales within the
Arctic such as Svalbard (Hacquebord & Avango, 2009),the region-wide
intensification of extraction, particularly in the post-Cold War era, is
perhaps better explained by macro-level drivers including technological
advances andincreasing global resource demands.

#### Capitalism [fuels]{.underline} Arctic conflict as states races for resource control.

[As the Arctic\'s treacherous polar ice caps melt away,]{.underline}
[nations have begun to engage in a **modern gold rush** over the
region's unclaimed **territory, natural resources, and strategic
position**. As a consequence of the rapidly disappearing polar ice
caps,]{.underline} there has been an increase in unclaimed ocean and
land territory, beyond any nation's control, that countries are
attempting [to gain jurisdiction over for purposes, such as **resource
extraction and trade routes**.]{.underline} Beyond economic motivations,
[nations such as the United States, Russia, and China are competing in
the region to project military supremacy and seek more
power.]{.underline} The Arctic also sits at a critical position between
North America and Eurasia, making it a powerful strategic position from
which to project military strength. As the liberal international order
is increasingly under threat by great power conflict (a scenario in
which the already-contentious relationship among the United States,
Russia and China could devolve into war), the Arctic Circle faces a
crossroads: will the underlying boiling tensions explode to the point of
larger global conflict or can diplomatic means be the key to ensuring
peace in the region?

A 2018 National Aeronautics and Space Administration report estimated
that the Arctic has lost 21,000 square miles of sea ice per year in the
last five decades, opening up more territory on the narrowing strip of
land for controlling and cultivating. Control over [Arctic territory has
given nations the ability to settle it, extract resources, and establish
military outposts, making legal rights and claims over such territory
incredibly valuable.]{.underline} Most legal matters concerning the
region are determined by The Arctic Council: an intergovernmental
organization that encourages cooperation in the region. Its key nation
members are those that border the Arctic: the United States of America,
Russia, Canada, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland.
Currently, Russia and Canada have [claimed]{.underline} the most land in
the region, which is demonstrative of the scope of their influence in
the region. Beyond the eight neighboring countries, there are also
thirteen [observer countries]{.underline} affiliated with the Arctic
Council, such as China, Germany, and India. The difference in roles
between member nations and observer countries, in many cases, can be
seen in their stated reasons for being in the region. For example, the
United States and Russia have previously justified their territorial
expansion due to their proximity to the region, while China is more
explicit about resources motivating their involvement in the
[region.]{.underline} The combination of a finite, yet growing amount of
claimable territory as well as the perception of a zero-sum game have
set these nations on a collision course for potential conflict.
Consequently, the Arctic Council works to resolve disputes by publishing
agreements and focusing on sustainability and environmental protection
of the Arctic. The melting polar ice caps and ensuing territorial
debates have set the stage for the magnification of the Arctic Council's
global role.

The [**competition over land** claims is driven in part by nations\'
desire for the region's natural resources, specifically natural gas,
which provides almost a quarter of all global energy usage]{.underline}.
Most [natural gas supplies around the world have already been **explored
and exploited**]{.underline}, but the [Arctic presents a vast untapped
reserve over which **nations are vying for control**]{.underline}. A US
Geological Survey estimates that the region has 1,699 trillion cubic
feet of natural gas and various other fuels, equal to the entirety of
Russia's oil reserves and three times as much as those of the United
States.

### 1NC -- Infrastructure Development

[THE ARCTIC stands at the crossroads of **important trends in climate
change and development**.]{.underline} Given recent calls for [private
capital participation in development, **especially
infrastructure**,]{.underline} Guggenheim Partners wants to emphasize
how and why we believe LTIs can be the ideal partner for sustainable
development in the Arctic with appropriate environmental and social
safeguards.

The ability of LTIs to hold assets throughout [business cycles and their
preference for alternative investments,]{.underline} such as
[infrastructure and real estate, make them attractive partners to local
leaders, planners, conservation groups and other stakeholders to create
sustainably developed environments]{.underline}, while preserving
plentiful natural habitat. They can provide capital that understands the
convergence of long-term value and sustainability. LTIs have provided
capital for essential projects for decades, including power, water,
transportation and real estate development.

Since 2013 Guggenheim Partners has maintained an [Arctic Infrastructure
Inventory]{.underline}, detailing the physical asset [needs]{.underline}
of the region. Over the next 15 years USD \$ [trillion of investment in
the Arctic is needed.]{.underline} LTIs can help to meet this investment
gap. [The Arctic and near-Arctic is a vibrant region, counting 12
million inhabitants and a USD \$500 million annual economic output.
Despite this footprint, many **basic needs and economic opportunities go
unmet**.]{.underline} Some of these require the following investment
needs:

- Renewable Energy \$60.6 billion

- Rail \$23.3 billion

- Maritime \$16.8 billion

- Social Buildings (schools, hospitals, etc.) \$2.4 billion

[LTIs]{.underline} can [provide some of the capital to fund revenue
producing assets but governments need to be a partner in investment,
with input from local communities, planners and
conservationists.]{.underline} When LTIs provide targeted capital for
specific purposes, public capital can flow where it is needed most. To
ensure the long-term license to operate for these private and public
investments, national and regional development plans with strong social
license are needed.

### 1NC -- Undersea Cables

Looking back at the period when [telegraph connections started to **link
empires and their colonies**, particularly through submarine
cables]{.underline} (enlace externo), the material nature of
[communication networks became visible.]{.underline} While the
unevenness of this global infrastructure still persists, the changing
actors involved in financing the [cables which are laid on the ocean
floor also show the **discontinuities of those wielding the power** over
global communication and its infrastructure.]{.underline} A hundred and
twenty years ago, they were financed by empires, which [imagined this
would lead to a more efficient oversight and a **more immediate command
over their colonies and used colonial resources** to build
them.]{.underline}

An important advantage for [British cable companies to control the
market throughout the nineteenth century was their ability to insulate
underwater cables]{.underline} through their access to the rubber-like
gutta percha gum -- natural latex -- from colonies in the Malay
Peninsula. Malays shared their indigenous knowledge of their
environment, and this specific tree sap and its properties, with British
colonial officers, which in turn became indispensable to the very
beginnings of internet history. **[Its extraction soon became an
ecological disaster]{.underline}**. The first transatlantic cable, laid
in 1857 between western Ireland and Newfoundland, was isolated with 250
tons of gutta percha, while a single felled tree yielded on average 312
grams of this material. When the British imposed a ban on the tree
felling in 1883 it had already become extinct in many regions of today's
Malaysia. In the early twentieth century roughly 200,000 nautical miles
(370,000 km) of cables criss-crossed the ocean floors, made up of the
sap of an estimated 88 million trees(enlace externo).

Nowadays, former colonised countries and peoples are treated first and
foremost as resources that can be tapped into rather than connecting
them in their own right. Many fibre-optic [submarine cables still follow
routes established during colonial times. Increasingly the global tech
giants finance, build and control new cables]{.underline}. In 2010,
Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft owned only one long-distance
submarine cable. By 2024, there will be more than 30. This number
includes projects such as Google's Equiano cable connecting the entire
West African coast or Meta's 2Africa cable which circumvents the whole
continent and branches off to the Gulf States, Pakistan and India,
providing 3 billion people with as yet unparalleled capacity. [Building
their own cables gives Big Tech companies unprecedented technical and
operational **control**]{.underline} -- what data traffic is going where
at what speed -- and privileged access to the data and the attention of
1.4 billion potential internet users(enlace externo).

Meta and Google can afford the [huge capital investments needed for
laying these cables even without having to sell the bandwidth since the
potential revenues of a new user base are deemed a **sufficient return
on investment**.]{.underline} Nanjira Sambuli,(enlace externo) a digital

techno-politics is the "rush to connect the unconnected" and to retain
them on a certain platform \[...\] because it's all about the data. How

### 1NC -- Extractivism -- Link

#### Extractivism is [reduces humans into objects of labor]{.underline} and extracts resources from the Arctic with [little care]{.underline} for the environment

**Sörlin '22**, S. (2022) The extractivist paradigm -- Arctic resources
and the planetary mine In: Sverker Sörlin (ed.), Resource Extraction and
Arctic Communities: The New Extractivist Paradigm (pp. 3-32). Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009110044

The everyday facts mentioned earlier are not specifically about the
Arctic, but they are relevant for understanding the Arctic and its role
as part of the modern global excavation and circulation of minerals. A
central point of departure for this book about resource extraction in
the Arctic is how firmly the dangerously growing human impact on our
small planet is tied to a framing mind of resource extractivism[. For a
few generations, expansion of resource extraction and circulation has
been a fundamental modus operandi for economic growth and diplomatic and
military forms of geopolitics. An element of this extractivist paradigm
has become its increasing decoupling of the extraction site from the
cultivation of human settlement.]{.underline} This is an old trope in
the discussion of mining and extraction, gaining ground in the critique
of "boom and bust" bonanzas in the nineteenth century, such as gold
rushes in Alaska and Yukon, the rapacious Bering Sea seal fur hunting,
and since then a stereotype (Morse, 2003; Brockington, Duffy & Igoe,
2008; Bridge, 2009; Demuth, 2019). Despite the critique and the
wellknown downsides of being rich in natural resources, sometimes called
the 4 Sverker Sörlin https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009110044.003 Published
online by Cambridge University Press "resource curse," that tend to keep
resource-rich communities and nations in poverty (Humphreys, Sachs &
Stiglitz, 2007; Ross, 2012; Smith & Waldner, 2021), this framing mind
has showed few signs of waning. On the contrary, the territorial
decoupling has continued and expanded into new ways of extracting
resources without sustainable physical presence and lasting
responsibility, presenting not just a threat to local sites and
communities but also a much less fortunate route forward for the
human--earth relationship than the one projected by the United Nations
Agenda 2030 goals and institutions. How should we understand this? In
the theoretical literature[, there is an increasing openness to regard
extractivism as a historically expanding phenomenon, underpinned for
several decades by a globalizing logic. One of the foremost voices in
this field, Alberto Acosta (2013, 2020), provided this definition of
extractivism: "we will use the term extractivism to refer to those
activities which remove large quantities of natural resources that are
not processed (or processed only to a limited degree), especially for
export."]{.underline} First emerging with European colonial expansion
five hundred years ago, "extractivism is not limited to minerals or oil.
Extractivism is also present in farming, forestry and even fishing"
(Acosta, 2013: 62). Other authors have suggested extractivism doesn't
stop there (Engels & Dietz, 2017). Once the extractivist mind frame has
become established in a region it tends to spread and serve as a
paradigm for economies and societies. These societies, and in particular
certain places and regions, thus enter problematic and hard-to-abandon
extractivist trajectories, a notion that resonates with the resource
curse discourse. Naomi Klein, in This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs.
the Climate (2014), expanded the definition of extractivism to include
social and relational dimensions: [**Extractivism is a nonreciprocal,
dominance-based relationship with the earth, one purely of taking.** It
is the opposite of stewardship \... the reduction of life into objects
for the use of others, giving them no integrity or value of their own
\... **It is also the reduction of human beings \... into labor to be
brutally extracted, pushed beyond limits.** She also argued that
extractivism is "directly connected to the notion of sacrifice zones --
places that, to their extractors, somehow don't count and therefore can
be poisoned, drained, or otherwise destroyed" (Klein, 2014: 169). In
this book, we have chosen to make the extractivist paradigm a central
feature. We do so partly because Arctic extractivism fits Acosta's
definition well. Arctic resource extraction has removed low-processed
natural resources out of the region for export, and it has expanded (in
fact it was always) **beyond minerals and oil into forestry,** fishing,
energy production, and nowadays also wind, solar, and hydro. Indeed, it
has extended further into aquaculture, tourism, and other largely
exogenous operations. We can also see disturbing elements of the Arctic
serving as The Extractivist Paradigm 5
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009110044.003 Published online by Cambridge
University Press a "sacrifice zone," in Klein's language. Has the Arctic
been a place that for its extractors somehow doesn't count? At the
least, we can say, as we shall encounter further in this book, that
Arctic resource extraction has often taken place without much care and
concern for community and for the long-term.]{.underline} [So, we
propose in this volume that the current Anthropocene world of unbroken
multigenerational, geo-anthropological expansion of tapping resources
from earth, soils, organic matter, landscapes, animals, knowledge, and
human bodies **functions under a paradigm that is at the same time
physical, ideological, epistemic, and normative.** It is a modus
operandi that is especially hard to deal with since it also brings
profit to the exploiters and wealth and sovereignty to states.
Historically, it has until recently been considered largely virtuous,
pragmatically useful, and underpinned by a comprehensive framework of
legal and economic principles and institutions (Sörlin, 2021a). Against
this backdrop, the following question can be asked: Is Arctic
extractivism sustainable -- and will it continue in its current forms?
If not, how might its future be different than its past? Anthropocene:
Overheating, Terraforming, Undermining Humans are an extractive species;
despite that still today not all members of humanity consume minerals or
fossil energy in large quantities. As for CO2 emissions, the richest 1
percent of the US population (3.5 million people) emit 318 ton per
person/year, which is 200 times the average emissions of the poorest 50
percent of the world population, close to 4 billion people (Alvaredo,
2018). Nonetheless]{.underline}, billions of people in average- and
high-income countries emit a lot and use materials in the thousands of
consumer products that most average income people use and circulate.
Extraction of resources is not only what drives engines through fossil
energy and economies through minerals and other precious resources. It
is also the main driving force of the Anthropocene. [Resource extraction
and its multifarious ramifications make up a very large part of the
geo-stratigraphic markers that are the criteria of the Anthropocene: the
millions of kilometers of tunnels and pits that penetrate the planet,
literally undermining it; the billions of tons of gravel and sand that
terraforming humans removed and whose weight now trumps that of
naturally eroding materials; the compounds that rest in the trillions of
shots from firearms that are randomly leaking out to soils of
battlefields and shooting ranges; the human fluvial and sedimentation
processes all over the globe; and the emissions from industrial
production, building, and heating]{.underline} (Zalasiewicz, Waters &
Williams, 2014). They also encompass the transportation and travel that
the extracted resources are used for, be they pollutants or circulating
toxic substances in rivers, lakes, and 6 Sverker Sörlin
https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009110044.003 Published online by Cambridge
University Press oceans, or airborne greenhouse gases driving climate
change. Down the line in this world of "overheating" (Eriksen, 2016),
glaciers and sea ice are melting, snow covers receding, seasons
changing, species migrating, droughts intensifying, and fires and storms
appearing more frequently, all adding to the stratigraphic signals
(Zalasiewicz et al., 2019). Thus, there are a cascade of social
consequences that stem from extractive economies, including unfair
working practices, discrimination, and very uneven gender structures of
local communities, alongside growth in wealth, although only fractions
of it stay in the mining communities. These changes and the quest for
resources and access destabilize geopolitics and cast doubt over the
impacts that the expansion of capital, rather than "humans" (Anthropos),
wreak on the Earth system (Malm, 2016). An analysis of fifty-two peer
reviewed articles on international relations (IR) in the Anthropocene
literature suggested that one (of three) main discourses for
"geo-political imagination" was "the extractivist world" (Lövbrand,
Mobjörk & Söder, 2020). Such a world means continued expansion of
resource extraction through mining, production of fossil fuels, rising
global temperatures with their multiple disastrous effects (IPCC, 2021),
rapid loss of global biodiversity (Dasgupta, 2021), sea floor ploughing,
and deep sea mining (Childs, 2020). The starting date of the
Anthropocene itself is debated, but since 2019, the Anthropocene Working
Group, charged with reporting on the issue, officially favors "the base
of the Anthropocene \[to\] be one of the stratigraphic signals around
the mid-twentieth century of the Common Era." 2 The issue of dating the
Anthropocene has become an insight-bringing academic industry in its own
right (e.g., Swanson, 2016; Ellis, 2018; Lewis & Maslin, 2018), although
a consensus has now built around a mid-twentieth century start.
Extraction on a large scale signifies human presence on the planet with
terraforming projects on a scale visible to the human eye from the
distance of satellites, such as the 260 square kilometers wide Mar de
plástico ("Plastic sea") greenhouse in Andalucía, Spain. Or the largest
open pit mining sites, such as Bingham Canyon Mine for extraction of
copper in the Quirrh Mountains near Salt Lake City.3 Multiple studies in
recent years testify to the fact that extractivism, including
prominently mining, is a major factor in the Anthropocene. In the film
Anthropocene: The Human Epoch, accompanied by a book from the same team
(Burtynsky, Baichwal & de Pencier, 2018), the large majority of cases
concern resource extraction, from elephant tusks in Africa to potash
mines in the Ural Mountains to lithium in Chile's Atacama desert to
timber in Nigeria and British Columbia. Examples abound from all
continents. At Fourmile Creek catchment, Colorado, "mining impacts
represent the dominant Anthropocene landscape change," exceeding
pre-nineteenth-century rates by at least fifty times (Dethier et al.,
The Extractivist Paradigm 7 https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009110044.003
Published online by Cambridge University Press 2018). "Geoheritage
sites" are increasingly identified all around the world to demonstrate
the effects of humans on the geological scale, typically through mining
and quarries (Margiotta & Sansò, 2017; Ruban, 2020). Even what has been
called the "early Anthropocene," Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age,
between 3,500 and 2,800 BCE, shows significant regional stratigraphic
signals indicating an anthropogenic influence from mining and smelting
in the Eastern Mediterranean, followed by excavation and burning of lead
during the Roman period. In the iconography of the Anthropocene, the new
earth forms are sometimes displayed as alluring aesthetics. Scaled down
from the satellite to the rain forest or the Arctic shoreline, the
open-pit mega-mines give many reasons for concern: pollution,
contamination of groundwater from mining, devastating impacts on
Indigenous and local communities (Demos, 2017) while at the same time
providing employment, infrastructure, training opportunities, local
multiplier effects, and resources and wealth for other communities, some
far away. Arctic Hyper-Extractivism These variations across time and
space are important and will be highlighted in the chapters of this
book. However, it is essential to observe that there is at the same time
a common pattern for the entire region, namely the dependence of its
extractive industries on developments elsewhere, around the entire
world, for capital, regulation, often labor, and above all demand and
markets. This underscores how well these industries align with Acosta's
articulation and how well they fit the overarching Anthropocene
extractivist paradigm. [Arctic extractivism, its emergence, and
especially its recent growth, post-1989 -- both real and anticipated,
sometimes hyped -- are synchronized with the expansion of globalizing
industrial capitalism and its institutions, and especially with its
recent acceleration and with resource extraction extending to, and
integrated with, the aforementioned "planetary mine." Its geophysical
and environmental impacts in the Arctic itself follow the general
pattern of the Anthropocene elsewhere (ACIA, 2004; Lenton, 2012; Carson
& Peterson, 2016). External demand motivates this rush for resources,
and markets and consumption elsewhere **swing the Arctic into its
hyper-extractivist role** on the world scene, figuring, once again,
largely as a resource frontier, boosted by coastal states and large
geopolitical actors such as China. The Arctic is in this respect part of
a much bigger whole.]{.underline} But it is a significant part because
its properties of being rich in a plurality of extractive resources --
from marine mammals to strategic minerals to fossil fuels -- are extreme
by most standards, especially if resource density is compared to
demography and presence of cities and agriculture. The Arctic is sparse
in population and vulnerable to climate change, trebling global average
temperature rise, and rapidly losing summer sea ice (NSIDC, 2020). This
makes Arctic global processes hyper-visible and the Arctic itself into a
looking glass through which the workings of the contemporary world can
be seen and, vice versa, a looking glass for the world to see
extractivism in an oversize version. The Arctic Anthropocene may be
small in numbers, but it is big in scale, impact, and as a specter
(Figure 1.2). Is Arctic extraction sustainable? As the world is looking
for a transformation away from fossil fuels and toward a more strategic
position vis à vis minerals, this question must be asked more critically
and profoundly than before. At any rate, [the extractivist paradigm is
in change and, at least potentially**, in a critical state**. The Arctic
is therefore a key place in a key moment to study global resource
extraction. The world is destined to undergo a deep transition from a
fossil fuel-based economy to something that may turn out to be a
paradigmatically different phase of world history (McNeill & Engelke,
2014).]{.underline} The transition will have an impact on most
extractive industries, although in different ways that we do not yet
know. 14 Sverker Sörlin https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009110044.003
Published online by Cambridge University Press Some industries will
likely benefit from the change -- wind and solar power, strategic
minerals. Others will likely suffer as coal does already in many parts
of the world, and oil probably will in the not too distant future.
Greenland, an area larger than Europe, with very large potential
resources (USGS, 2008) has already announced it will no longer allow oil
prospecting, and in 2021 a national election pivoted around the issue of
mining (McGwin, 2021). Indigenous economies, based on fishing, herding,
hunting, and tourism, face an uncertain future. With the transformation
come not only economic change, political upheavals, or sustainability
challenges but also concerns about social justice as global needs grow
and renewable energy projects end up interfering with Indigenous rights
to herd, while carbon and other natural resource footprints remain
grossly unequal and widening (Alvaredo, 2018). Extractivism and the
Anthropocene complement each other in a lock step fashion. The latter is
largely defined by the impact of mankind on the geological scale and
defined by stratigraphic traces of a certain magnitude and persistence.
The extractivist paradigm, on the other hand, can be defined as the
generic practice Figure 1.2. Mining in the High Arctic: The Diavik
diamond mine in Canada's Northwest Territories, approximately 300
kilometers northeast of Yellowknife and 220 kilometers south of the

Published online by Cambridge University Press and the economic and
ideological legitimation for the processes that actually create and
reinforce the Anthropocene impact. The extractivist paradigm draws the
focus toward the agential dimensions of the Anthropocene and not just
its quantified impacts and consequences, such as the transgression of
planetary boundaries or the wounds that extractivist activities left on
the planet. It brings to the fore the need to recognize the cumulative
impact and the consequences for those at the frontline. So, the frame
here is that extraction is an overarching driver of the Anthropocene,
which also means that it is the parts of humanity that have been part of
extractivism that are rising to become of particular interest, as the
hotspots of global change. The agency of extractivism, both through
demand and consumption, on the one hand, and through capital and much of
the physical extraction labor has come from particular strata of the
world, and only to a limited extent from inside the region. This has
been a persistent pattern for centuries. Extractive industries thus
carry a lot of responsibility for a particular view of the world as an
object of extraction and the extension of this activity to include not
just minerals and energy but also the various geo-spherical elements
such as the biosphere, the atmosphere, the lithosphere, the cryosphere,
and the hydrosphere. The technosphere (Haff, 2014) performs the work
required, and it too no

It has become increasingly evident that [modern capitalist societies
engage in destructive modes of interaction with the natural environment.
Climate change, biodiversity loss, and resource
overconsumption,]{.underline} among others, are not simply remediable
side effects, but characteristic traits of these societies (Jackson,
2016; Urry, 2010; Wilhite, 2016). Therefore, the [possibility of
pursuing transitions to meet global sustainability targets necessarily
rests on challenging and transforming capitalist institutions, and their
cultural, social and political architecture, **including deeply held
beliefs**]{.underline} such as the inherent desirability of endless
economic growth (see Feola, 2019 for an overview of the debate). The
occurrence of the 2008 financial crisis has resulted in a broadening of
the debate on the contradictions of capital (e.g., Harvey, 2014; Streek,
2014), and the conditions of post-growth and post-capitalist economies.
This debate is now not only confined to academia, but more frequently
features in the mass media and in institutional fora, including the
European Union and the United Nations (e.g., The Guardian, 2018;
Järvensivu et al., 2018).

[One of the critiques and visions that has gained prominence in this
debate is that of sustainable degrowth. Sustainable degrowth (degrowth
from here on) envisions an equitable and democratic transition to a
smaller economy with less production and consumption]{.underline}
(Martinez-Alier et al., 2010; Schneider et al., 2010). It 'posit\[s\] a
profound cultural, economic, and political transformation of dominant
institutions and practices' (Escobar, 2015, p.454), and 'a disruption of
existing institutional arrangements' (Joutsenvirta, 2016, p.23).
[Degrowth sets itself apart from the green economy, green growth and
other agendas that compromise between the divergent objectives of
sustainability and economic growth (Bina, 2013), as it proposes a
project of urgent radical socioecological transformation that is
**incompatible with modern capitalism** (Asara et al., 2013; Muraca,
2013).]{.underline}

As Boonstra and Joosse (2013) argued, by 'singling out economic growth
as the cause of ecological and social misery, [degrowth blames the inner
workings and logic of capitalism, since economic growth is the single
mechanism that holds the capitalist economic system
together']{.underline} (p.172). The post-capitalist nature of degrowth
should be put into perspective ---for example, [distinct narratives of
socioecological transformation focus not necessarily on capitalism, but
on the State, or on the **ideology of development**]{.underline} (Böhm
et al., 2008). Yet, many scholars and activists have variously supported
this position (Muraca, 2013; Kallis et al., 2018). Notably, [the
incompatibility of degrowth with modern capitalist societies has been
reflected in concepts of 'escape from the economy' (Fournier, 2008),
'**deconstruction of the economy**' (Leff, 2010), 'decolonization of the
imaginary' (Latouche, 2015b),]{.underline} and other frameworks
advocating the liberation of society from pervasive economicism and
'from the ideology of a one-way future consisting only of growth' (Le
Guin,1982, cited in Kallis and March, 2015).

[**Liberation from capitalist ideologies** of growth is critical for
degrowth.]{.underline} This fundamental principle is reflected in the
ongoing debate on the definition of this term and the appropriateness of
its usage. Various scholars have decried this term as being analytically
misleading (van den Bergh, 2011), and unlikely to be appealing beyond
the small niche of radically committed sustainability scholars and
activists (Drews and Antal, 2016; but see Drews and Reese, 2018).
Nevertheless, Kallis (2011) defended the value of the prefix 'de-' in
degrowth:

the English prefix 'de-' represents better the active nature of this
liberation process: [we have to get rid of the imperative of growth,
institutionally and mentally, it won\'t go away just by ignoring
it.]{.underline} The 'de' in degrowth is therefore not only a 'de' for
throughput decline, but also a 'de' for cultural and institutional
decolonization from economicism and the religion of growth (p.877).

Therefore, [degrowth 'is a deliberately subversive slogan']{.underline}
(Kallis et al., 2015, p.5; also see Kallis and March, 2015).

#### The impact of mining in the arctic is [disproportionally felt by indigenous groups]{.underline} --capitalism and extractive industries have been deemed ["Green Colonialism,"]{.underline} thwarting indigenous communities' right to self-determination

**Hall '24**, 11-18-2024, \"We Need to Talk About Mining in the
Arctic,\" Earth Science, Systems and Society,
https://www.lyellcollection.org/doi/full/10.3389/esss.2024.10117

[The Arctic encompasses a myriad of ecosystems, transcending borders
between nations and cultures. It is home to 4 million people, including
**numerous Indigenous groups** making up around 10% of the population.
Although underexplored, it is also host to a variety of geologically
diverse mineral deposits that are critical to the production of
renewable energy and our ability to achieve our climate goals. However,
the impact of climate change on the Arctic is magnified and some of our
solutions to climate change have the potential to have negative local
impacts.]{.underline} Furthermore, the history of mining in the Arctic
raises understandable concerns as to whether or not we should be
exploring and mining in the Arctic. This article discusses the interplay
between the environment, people and development in the Arctic, with a
specific focus on the history of exploration and mining in the region.
We pose questions such as: ["How do we balance the global need for
minerals with environmental and social concerns around resource
extraction?",]{.underline} and "can we envisage a future for mining in
the Arctic which ensures long-term sustainability, environmental
stewardship and Indigenous wellbeing and collaboration?" The answer to
some of these questions might lie in examples of more successful
resource development in the Arctic, which include Indigenous benefit
agreements, braided knowledge systems and shared ownership projects[. It
is clear that **only by incorporating a diversity of voices and
partnerships**, and challenging business as usual in the Arctic, **can
we begin to conceive of potential solutions for achieving a just
transition.**]{.underline}

Approximately 4 million people inhabit the Arctic and the region
occupies an area of \>33 million km2, spanning 8 countries (Murray et
al., 1998). The Arctic is home to over 40 different Indigenous groups
including Sámi, Aleut, Inuit, and Yupik communities who are spread
across Northern Europe, North America, Russia and Greenland (WWF Arctic,
2023). Indigenous people make up around 10% of the population of the
Arctic, 53% in the Northern Territories of Canada, 92% in Greenland, 76%
in the Norwegian Arctic, 46% in the Swedish Arctic, 46% in the Finnish
Arctic and 9% in the Russian Arctic (Young and Bjerregaard, 2019 and
references therein). This northern land encompasses a myriad of natural
environments and ecosystems transcending borders between nations and
cultures.

[**Throughout its history, the Arctic peoples and land have been
continuously impacted by European trade, capitalism and extractive
industries through the process of colonisation**, as well as global
systems which continue to shape the developments in this complex region
([Greenberg,
2009](https://www.lyellcollection.org/reader/content/194278a604c/10.3389/esss.2024.10117/format/epub/EPUB/xhtml/index.xhtml?hmac=1752523265-8CtCl5G9hLFGLWweamQuXBi00SainGjCuidqQVy9Y8A%3D#B25)).]{.underline}
The history of resource extraction in the Arctic is by no means
clear-cut: these industries have undoubtedly shaped the environmental
and political identity of the Arctic, whilst consecutively exerting
influence over Indigenous and local communities, affecting their ability
to uphold their Indigenous culture and way of life. [Many of these
pressures came from the increasing environmental, social and economic
impact of different industries (Zentner et al., 2019; Fohringer et al.,
2021; Hanaček et al., 2022).]{.underline}

The united global goal, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to
transition to greener energy forms, directly impacts Indigenous
communities in the Arctic. [Currently, the Just Green Transition is
dependent upon mineral extraction, extraction that often takes place on
Indigenous land in the name of the "Green New Deal" (Robbins and
Zografos, 2020). This has been termed "**Green
Colonialism**,"]{.underline} the phrase was first used by Aili
Keskitalo, the former president of the Sámi Parliament in Norway, to
describe the impact of extractive industries and energy development
projects on Indigenous land (Normann, 2022, pg. 13; Saami-Council,
2017). [Whilst there are undoubtedly detrimental consequences of mining
in the Arctic, with many of these impacts being deemed acts of "Green
Colonialism" it is remiss to not acknowledge the multifaceted benefits
of this resource extraction]{.underline}. Whether or not impacts are
positive or negative can vary depending on the scale or perspective of
the problem. We therefore present specific examples from different
regions of the Arctic below.

Throughout the Arctic, [Indigenous and local communities have had
**their right to self-determination continually thwarted** and
challenged by a myriad of industries and developmental projects in the
region.]{.underline} The sentiment behind "Green Colonialism," the
purposeful sacrificing of Indigenous land in the name of environmental
goals, has led to the creation of domestic and international agreements
with the aim of protecting and preserving Indigenous land, culture and
identity. Development of land claim settlements, such as the Alaska
Native Land Claim Settlement in 1971, the largest Indigenous land
settlement in US history, have positively contributed to Impact and
Benefit Agreements between Indigenous peoples and mines in Alaska and
elsewhere.

What we think of as 'the Arctic' is made up of several countries or
states and many Indigenous cultural entities; in addition, there is
geographical variation in terms of flora, fauna, wildlife and weather.
The phrase 'the Arctic' obscures this diversity and signifies a space
that is largely empty and insignificantly peopled. Spaces are
historically changing and are created through interactions ranging from
the local to the global (Massey, Citation1994). The dominant Arctic
imaginary is rooted in concepts developed and promulgated by polar
explorers from North America and Europe from the mid-nineteenth century
on, such as Isaac Hayes, Knud Rasmussen, the Pearys and Robert Bartlett.
[The imaginaries of the explorers buoyed the colonial project at least
from the mid-nineteenth century onwards and thus **laid the foundation
for the present-day neoliberal approaches** taken by global actors in
Arctic places, such as Greenland.]{.underline} In the words of Urban
Wråkberg, '[Envisioning polar regions as a land of promise for science
and a potential source of wealth for the global economy continues to
inspire the post-colonial world']{.underline} (Citation2009, p. 92).

This paper focuses on depictions of Greenland and Greenlandic Inuit in
English-language explorer accounts dating from 1872 through the 1920s on
the premise that these accounts reinforce the Arctic imaginary that
helped establish Greenland's ongoing subordinate position in the global
economy. It responds to Avango et al.'s call to deconstruct
'articulations of the future from the past and present to reveal power
relations' (Citation2013). As Avango et al. further assert, historical
analysis is 'especially appropriate' in order to locate actors and
networks and their presumed authority to define the Arctic and
articulate its futures, sidelining and even erasing the Indigenous
presence. Indigenous people, of course, were in the Arctic for millennia
but have only recently been recognized as deserving attention in
economic and political fora (Avango, Nilsson, & Roberts, Citation2013).
This recognition is more institutionalized and significant in some cases
more than others (Koivurova, Citation2008). With only a foothold in
organizations shaping Arctic futures, such as the Arctic Council, and a
lack of constitutional recognition in countries such as Sweden,
[**Indigenous peoples are frequently an afterthought** rather than a
pillar of Arctic discourse and the visioning and planning of Arctic
futures. Arctic exploration itself facilitated the subsuming of northern
regions into larger capitalist economies, which were often in opposition
to and thus undermined Indigenous economies.]{.underline} The Arctic
imaginary of the polar explorers posits Indigenous people as peripheral,
offstage while explorers assume center stage positions. This
marginalization places Greenland, for instance, in a subordinate
position in the global market economy, where it remains. Greenland
itself often disappears in discussions and policies; it is subsumed by
the structure known as 'the Arctic'. This paper demonstrates how
imaginaries developed in the past continue to define the Arctic,
specifically Greenland, one of its constituent parts. As Jonathan
Greenberg stated, policy-makers need to know the history of the peopled
Arctic, so 'indigenous self-determination, resource conservation and
environmental stewardship' can occur (Citation2009, p. 1308). [The
development of Arctic imaginaries is part of this history. The
explorers' enduring influence allows for an external shaping of economic
and political neoliberal activities in Greenland, limiting Indigenous
influence. These neoliberal activities privilege market exchange,
substituting it for other ethical belief systems (Treanor, Citation2005)
such as Indigenous beliefs in which are rooted alternative relationships
with the land.]{.underline} Neoliberalism is also a governance model
that situates competition and self-interest as the preferred route to
effective and efficient government (Steger & Roy, Citation2010). Thus,
there is no room in the neoliberal framework for, say, Indigenous
approaches to governance, including, for instance, collective ownership
or even non-ownership of what are today called natural resources.
Climate change, uninvited by Inuit and representing a serious
interruption of their relationship with their environment, is one
manifestation of the exclusion of Inuit frameworks alongside the
ascendancy of neoliberal economics.

This paper argues that polar exploration shaped persistent Arctic
imaginaries through consistent commitment to colonial methods that
diminished the role and agency of Greenlandic Inuit and portrayed the
island as an empty and therefore available source of wealth. [Terra
nullius, the European doctrine of empty land, provided the legal means
for extensions of European sovereignty into the Arctic but the
legitimacy of terra nullius would not have persisted without constant
maintenance of its foundational ideas through explorers' accounts. In
addition, the colonial approaches and philosophies of the explorers both
reflected and legitimized notions of Inuit primitiveness and even
inferiority of the Arctic as solely site of natural resources to which
North Americans and Europeans were entitled.]{.underline} We may not be
aware of it but the explorer's legacy is embedded in Western culture and
continues to influence and validate the neoliberal activities that
underpin Western economies and those, like China's, with similar
aspirations. The view of Greenland as a legitimate site for resource
exploitation in the neoliberal tradition is derived from the thinking of
Arctic explorers and makes explicit how influential and entrenched this
thinking is. Thus international businesses and the states in which they
are located become the new explorers.

The paper proceeds to identify themes in explorers' accounts and tie
these to modern-day plans to play out these themes. Accordingly, the
paper is based on close readings of explorers' accounts with the
intention of determining the philosophical underpinnings that informed
their views and approaches. [In other words, I attempted to discern the
assumptions made by the explorers; for instance, the Arctic is
empty.]{.underline} Against this backdrop, I examined two relevant
published reports, one from Europe, the other from the United States;
both are in English, the lingua franca of international business and are
representative of contemporary texts on Arctic futures. I compared
explorers' assumptions to the assumptions made in these texts, seeking
commonalities, if any. The texts are: 'European research objectives in
polar research' (European Union Polar Net, Citation2016) and The
Greenland Gold Rush: Promise and Pitfalls of Greenland's Energy and
Mineral Resources, published by the Brookings Institution in Washington,
DC (Boersma & Foley, Citation2014). Both these texts echo explorers'
discourse, revealing a continuity of thought from the polar exploration
era to the contemporary presence of western actors in the Arctic;
[Western entitlement and the invisibility of Indigenous people are among
the many themes common to both sets of documents. The persistence of
these themes allows neoliberal capitalism, propelled by Western actors,
to encroach into the Arctic, including Greenland.]{.underline}

The Looming Threat: Why [Capitalism is Pivoting Toward
Authoritarianism]{.underline}

The [world]{.underline} is [facing]{.underline} an unprecedented
convergence of **[crises]{.underline}**---[**climate change**,
**automation**, and economic **inequality**]{.underline}---that are
[driving social unrest and threatening]{.underline} the stability of
[markets]{.underline}. Some of the best minds in tech predict that
[automation]{.underline} alone [could eliminate 40--60% of]{.underline}
today's [jobs]{.underline}, [creating **economic
instability**]{.underline} that will shake the foundations of our
society.

[**Instead** of responding with policies that **redistribute wealth**
and **power** to create stability, capitalists are increasingly looking
to **authoritarianism** as a way to **protect** their **wealth** and
maintain their **grip** on **public policy**. If left unchecked, we are
on the verge of a **corporate-political realignment** that will **erode
democratic norms** and push both **major parties** toward more openly
**authoritarian governance**.]{.underline}

Understanding Neoliberalism: The Engine of Corporate Capture

Before we talk about where we're headed, we need to understand how we
got here.

What is Neoliberalism?

[**Neoliberalism** is the idea that **markets** should **govern**
society, governments should shrink, and **profit** should take
**priority over people**]{.underline}. It's built on three pillars:

- [**Deregulation**: Stripping public **oversight** from
  **corporations** so they can do whatever **maximizes
  profit**]{.underline}.

- [**Privatization**: **Selling** off **public goods**---education,
  healthcare, transportation---to **corporate bidders.**]{.underline}

- [Austerity: **Gutting social programs**]{.underline} that provide
  stability [so that competition for jobs drives down
  wages.]{.underline}

In theory, [neoliberalism claims that this creates freedom]{.underline}
and opportunity. [In reality, it **concentrates power** in the hands of
the **wealthy**, **dismantles public safety nets**, and turns democracy
into an **auction house for billionaires.**]{.underline}

A Simple Metaphor: Neoliberalism is Monopoly---But Rigged

Imagine playing Monopoly, but with a twist:

- [The **richest** player gets to **rewrite** the rules]{.underline} as
  they go.

- Every time they pass \"Go,\" they collect more than \$200, while
  [others get less.]{.underline}

- [Railroads, utilities, and public services? Privatized]{.underline}.
  [You]{.underline} now [pay]{.underline} fees [just to
  participate.]{.underline}

- [If you fall behind, you can \"pull yourself up by your
  bootstraps\"---except, your **bootstraps** have been
  **repossessed**.]{.underline}

- [When the economy crashes, the government **bails** out the **rich**
  and lets the **poor drown.**]{.underline}

That's **[neoliberalism]{.underline}** in action---[a system where
**inequality** isn't a failure of the market; it's the
**goal**.]{.underline}

How [**Neoliberalism** Set the **Stage** for an **Authoritarian
Turn**]{.underline}

[In the 1980s, the Democratic Leadership Council]{.underline} (DLC) was
created to adapt the Democratic Party to the rising dominance of
neoliberalism. The DLC [convinced Democrats that to stay electorally
competitive, they needed to embrace
Reaganomics]{.underline}---[**deregulation**, **corporate-friendly
policies**, and **free trade** agreements that crushed **labor
rights**]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} shift [**gutted** the
**party's working-class** base and cemented its new role as a
**corporate party**]{.underline}.

Fast forward to today, and [we're seeing a new pivot in
motion]{.underline}---this time, [toward authoritarianism]{.underline}.
As [**corporate elites** recognize that sustaining the current levels of
wealth extraction will very likely lead to **rebellion**, they are
**shifting** their loyalties from democracy to **authoritarian
strongmen** who promise to keep the system intact by force.]{.underline}

The Next Evolution: How Democrats Could Adapt to Trumpism

If history repeats itself, [the Democratic Party]{.underline}---already
captured by corporate interests that [are generally moving in an
anti-democratic direction]{.underline}---may once again [shift rightward
to maintain its funding and political viability]{.underline}. This could
mean:

- [**Normalizing** authoritarianism]{.underline}: Instead of directly
  opposing authoritarian power, Democrats might try to co-opt it and
  ["manage" it within the system.]{.underline}

- Hardening social control: [Increased **surveillance**, **policing**,
  and **censorship** will be used to suppress dissent]{.underline}.

- Deeper corporate entrenchment: [The party will continue **prioritizing
  corporate donors** over **grassroots organizing**, cutting off the
  left at the knees.]{.underline}

This means [the entire political spectrum could be forced to move
towards authoritarianism, making what was once extreme seem "moderate."
We are already seeing this play out in real time.]{.underline}

Evidence of Corporate Alignment with Authoritarianism

Major [corporations]{.underline} already [enable and benefit from
authoritarian regimes]{.underline} when it suits their bottom line:

- [Tech companies collaborate with governments to build **surveillance**
  systems that **suppress dissent**]{.underline}.

- [Energy corporations support **autocratic regimes** that ensure access
  to **fossil fuel resources**]{.underline}.

- [Financial institutions prop up **authoritarian governments** that
  provide them favorable investment conditions]{.underline}.

And in [the U.S., the rise in political violence is accelerating this
alignment]{.underline}:

- The threat of political violence---such as [**attacks** on **election
  officials** and lawmakers]{.underline}---is pushing the entire system
  toward authoritarian "stability."

- [**Trump's pardon** of over 1,500 **January 6th** insurgents before
  announcing his cabinet picks]{.underline} signals a realignment where
  political violence becomes an accepted part of governance.

The lesson of history is that [if capitalists see democracy as too
unpredictable and rebellion as too costly, they will choose
authoritarianism over democracy **every time.**]{.underline}

Why [This Matters for **Social Movements**]{.underline}

[When both parties bow to authoritarianism]{.underline}, it's not just
about economic policy---it's about freedom itself. This affects:

- Bodily autonomy: If there is no opposition to creeping
  authoritarianism, [attacks on reproductive rights and **personal
  freedoms** will become **permanent**.]{.underline}

- Dissent and protest: [**Activists** and journalists will be
  **targeted** and criminalized]{.underline}, with bipartisan support.

- Political choice: If both parties normalize authoritarian policies,
  [there will be no viable opposition within electoral
  politics]{.underline}.

This is how authoritarianism becomes entrenched---not through a sudden
coup, but through a series of small, "rational" adjustments that slowly
make repression normal.

How We Fight Back

[To **counteract** this]{.underline} shift, [we must]{.underline}:

- Defend Democratic Institutions: **[Pressure lawmakers]{.underline}**
  to uphold democratic norms and [resist consolidation of
  power]{.underline}.

- Advance Economic Justice: [Push for progressive taxation, labor
  protections, and social safety nets to **reduce economic
  desperation**]{.underline}---the root cause of authoritarian appeal.

- Hold Corporations Accountable: [**Expose** and **resist** corporate
  complicity]{.underline} in authoritarian governance.

- Mobilize Civil Society: [Invest in **grassroots
  organizing**]{.underline} that builds counterpower outside of
  electoral politics.

- Defend Civil Liberties: [Challenge restrictions on]{.underline}
  speech, protest, and bodily **[autonomy]{.underline}** through legal
  and direct action.

- Raise Awareness: [**Educate** the public on the risks of
  **authoritarian normalization**]{.underline} and the history of
  corporate capture.

[If we don't fight now, we will wake up in a world where "freedom," as
under]{.underline} neoliberalism, takes on a new meaning; one that
**[undermines democracy]{.underline}** and accountability, [making
resisting authoritarianism even more **difficult**]{.underline}.

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

A "triangle of extinction" that connects environmental death with war
and capitalism -- creates an emergency that humanity-as-a-whole has
never faced before. The triangle operates with the greatest force and
danger in the United States -- and it needs to become the subject of
conversation and activism of all Americans as well as all nations. The
Earth Strike movement, a grassroots group focused on climate change,
works to promote consciousness and activism about looming destruction of
the earth.5 Among its actions are a general strike to save the planet.
In coordination with unions against both governments and corporations,
Earth Strike has carried out multiple global actions since 2019,
including close coordination with labor unions on a May Day protest in
2019, leading up to a September protest on the anniversary of Rachel
Carson's book, Silent Spring, which prophesized the devastation of the
environment. Likewise, the Sunrise Movement has been catalyzing a
massive group of climate activists in the United States, involving many
young people, indigenous nations and people of color, by holding wealthy
elites accountable for sacrificing the future of everyone. Sunrise
challenged Biden's climate programs as far from adequate, sitting-in
against Democratic Senators in July 2021 and calling for \$12 trillion
over ten years in green jobs and infrastructure, helping push the
Democratic Party and President Biden to focus on the emergency and
demanding new investment for resilient new infrastructure and climate
adaptation. By late 2022, albeit with an unfavorable political
arithmetic, elements of the Sunrise agenda made it through both houses
of the US Congress in the form of the awkwardly named, Inflation
Reduction Act.6 And we now also have "Birth-strikers," women who refuse
to have children because of the climate-devastated world they would
occupy. A 33-year-old Blythe Pepino, a British founder of BirthStrike
and a songwriter who began to read extensively about climate change,
became more and more anxious after seeing government inaction. She felt
she had to act, helping found BirthStrike and declaring the group's
primal fear: We're too afraid to bring children into the world with
future that's forecast.7 Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of America's most
influential progressive Democrats in Congress, and a self-proclaimed
"democratic socialist," says she understands the birthstrikers,
commenting on Instagram Live: It is basically a scientific consensus
that the lives of our children are going to be very difficult, and it
does lead young people to have a legitimate question: is it OK to still
have children?8 Meanwhile, the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, a global
community of nuclear physicists and other influential scientists, have
moved their "Doomsday Clock" that they created after World War II closer
and closer to midnight. Since the invention of the nuclear bomb, their
Doomsday Clock has been set each year as a symbol of the looming end of
the world, with the scientists changing the time reflecting their best
estimates of the changing risk of total destruction. For the first time,
in 2015, they began including the risks of climate change to the risks
of blowing up the world in a nuclear war. In 2019, they moved the time
on the clock to two minutes before midnight, noting that We are like
passengers on the Titanic, ignoring the iceberg ahead in terms of
climate and nuclear threats.9 Entering 2022, the clock stood at 100
seconds before midnight, reflecting accelerating climate and military
extinction threats. In August 2021, the UN latest IPCC climate report,
called "code red for humanity," showed that the climate meltdown is
already here and we cannot stop massive climate damage; instead, we have
about ten years to make drastic changes to try to save civilized life on
the planet. While such alarms by scientists have catalyzed a more
widespread and fearful public awareness of the terrible damage already
baked in, reinforced by the huge numbers of research studies and
activist protests about the climate change crisis and nuclear war
dangers, none of this has awakened a visceral or political response
proportional to the catastrophic threat. For some, awareness of the
extinction threat has produced a technological turn -- the hope that new
inventions and the rapid pace of technological change may help us solve
the terminal threats. For example, the promise of fossil fuel-free and
radioactive-free nuclear fusion energy periodically makes headlines.
However, even in the most optimistic scenarios, commercial production of
fusion energy is at best decades away. If humanity is to survive to
enjoy the benefits of this allegedly limitless energy source, it will
have to alter the way it organizes its economy and its approach to
economic growth along the lines that we spell out in this book.10 As
2022 drew to a close, the war in Ukraine was correctly seen as
increasing the likelihood of nuclear annihilation -- with observers
noting that the "usual methods for managing conflict between the United
States and Russia in the Cold War have fallen into disrepair, and it is
not clear that anything has replaced it." Similar observations may be
made for the novel and rapidly evolving Taiwan-centered confrontation
between the United States and China.11 On January 23, 2023, the Clock
was moved to 90 seconds before midnight, the closest to apocalypse since
its creation in 1947. Bang, Crunch, Shriek, and Whimper: Varieties of
Existential Threat and Extinction Because extinction is the most
terrible and deadly destiny that humans now face, we need to be clear
about the various forms of existential risks from which humanity cannot
meaningfully recover. We need to begin then with some definitions that
offer as much clarity as possible about the apocalyptic threats we face.
Most discussions of climate change and nuclear war do not offer theories
or even a definition of extinction. They simply tend to take the "common
sense" view that extinction means the worst outcome that nuclear war and
climate change might produce: the elimination of humans and other life
species from the planet. An Oxford philosopher, Dr. Nick Bostrom, has
developed a more rigorous definition of extinction. He argues that the
commonsense view is too limited. It fails to recognize that there are
many forms of existential risk and extinction that need to be named,
understood and confronted. His definitions not only include total
elimination of all life but also extend to a much wider set of
catastrophic futures that humans now face.12 Bostrom offers the
following definition: Existential risk -- One where an adverse outcome
would either annihilate Earth-originating intelligent life or
permanently and drastically curtail its potential.13 Note that he
includes not only risks of total annihilation of all life but of threats
that would "permanently and drastically curtail" the potential of
humanity for growth and further positive development. He is offering a
definition that includes total extinction but extends to a variety of
other existential risks. But he's not just lumping into his definition
every kind of catastrophic risk. He distinguishes existential or
extinction risks from catastrophic "endurable" risks as follows:
Existential risks are distinct from global endurable risks. Examples of
the latter kind include: threats to the biodiversity of Earth's
ecosphere, moderate global warming, global economic recessions (even
major ones), and possibly stifling cultural or religious eras such as
the "dark ages", even if they encompass the whole global community,
provided they are transitory (though see the section on "Shrieks"
below). To say that a particular global risk is endurable is evidently
not to say that it is acceptable or not very serious. A world war fought
with conventional weapons or a Nazistyle Reich lasting for a decade
would be extremely horrible events even though they would fall under the
rubric of endurable global risks since humanity could eventually
recover.14 Bostrom identifies four categories of existential risk, which
include not only total destruction but also permanently prevent the
development of humanity toward its full potential and fulfillment, a
state he calls "posthumanity, meaning a new stage of history where
humans are either extinct or have lost the sensibilities we define as
"human": Bangs -- Earth-originating intelligent life goes extinct in
relatively sudden disaster resulting from either an accident or a
deliberate act of destruction. Crunches -- The potential of humankind to
develop into posthumanity is permanently thwarted although human life
continues in some form. Shrieks -- Some form of posthumanity is attained
but it is an extremely narrow band of what is possible and desirable.
Whimpers -- A posthuman civilization arises but evolves in a direction
that leads gradually but irrevocably to either the complete
disappearance of the things we value or to a state where those things
are realized to only a minuscule degree of what could have been
achieved.15 Bostrom offers examples of each category. An example of
Bangs would be global nuclear war suddenly killing all life, consistent
with the most common view of extinction. Interestingly, Bostrom, writing
in 2002, adds [the possibility of global pandemics becoming
Bangs]{.underline}: What if AIDS was as contagious as the common cold?
There are [several features of today's world that may make a global
pandemic **more likely than ever** before. **Travel, food-trade, and
urban** dwelling have all increased dramatically in modern times, making
it easier for a new disease to **quickly infect** a **large fraction**
of the world's population]{.underline}.16 He was writing 17 years before
COVID-19 erupted. At this writing, he might consider it a catastrophic
but "endurable" rather than existential or extinction risk, but it
remains unclear whether the virus could mutate or interact with other
rising deadly viruses such as Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza to
permanently alter social interaction or a society consistent with full
human potential. If that were to happen, it would become an "existential
risk," and possibly a Bang or Crunch. Bostrom also notes that "runaway
global warming" could become a Bang. Based on current evidence since his
2002 analysis, he would almost certainly see it as an extinction risk
that should be classified as a potential Bang or, if the world acts more
decisively than now seems likely, a possible Crunch.17 An example of
other Crunches, closely related to global warming is what he calls
"Resource depletion or ecological destruction": The natural resources
needed to sustain a high-tech civilization are being used up. If some
other cataclysm destroys the technology we have, it may not be possible
to climb back up to present levels if natural conditions are less
favorable than they were for our ancestors, for example if the most
easily exploitable coal, oil, and mineral resources have been
depleted.18 It seems clear that, if writing today, he would alter this
paragraph and focus on climate change as well as "resource depletion."
He would likely view the depletion of oil and coal as not an existential
risk but a basis for a new clean energy economy that might limit climate
change to a Crunch rather than a Bang. Examples of Shrieks include a
"repressive totalitarian global regime": One can imagine that an
intolerant world government, based perhaps on mistaken religious or
ethical convictions, is formed, is stable, and decides to realize only a
very small part of all the good things a posthuman world could
contain.19 Here, we see an existential risk that would not extinguish
human life but could potentially permanently curb the potential for
human development and growth that he calls "posthumanity." Orwell's 1984
would constitute Bostrom's Shreik. An example that Bostrom argues of
Whimpers -- one that [current space wars]{.underline} and colonization
are [making]{.underline} more likely -- is what he describes as a
"[colonization race.]{.underline}" Our "cosmic commons" [could be burnt
up in a colonization race]{.underline}. Selection would favor those
replicators that spend all their resources on sending out further
colonization probes. Although the time it would take for a whimper of
this kind to play itself out may be relatively long, it could still have
important policy implications because near-term choices may determine
whether we will go down a track that inevitably leads to this outcome.
[Once]{.underline} the evolutionary process is set in motion or a
[cosmic colonization race begun, it could prove difficult or
**impossible to halt**]{.underline} it. It may well be that the only
feasible way of avoiding a whimper is to prevent these chains of events
from ever starting to unwind.20 Of course, [we have seen a version of
such **existentially risky colonization** in]{.underline} the
[history]{.underline} of Western militarist colonial nations both in
Europe and, especially since World War II in the postcolonial, intensely
militarized US state. We shall see that US militarism and endless wars
remain the most dangerous risk of ending the world through nuclear war.
Beyond his colorful classification of varieties of existential risks and
extinction, Bostrom offers two other relevant arguments. One has to do
with the history and future of existential and extinction risks. There
have been five prior extinctions, all before the existence of humans. He
argues that the invention and use of the nuclear bomb in 1945 started a
modern sixth extinction stage, in which humans both exist and play a
role in creating new existential risks. He argues that [these risks are
multiplying with natural, technological and socioeconomic and political
developments that will make the future ever **more vulnerable** to all
his classes of **extinction**.]{.underline}

\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUME\>\>

This leads to a second idea that he does not highlight but seems to
recognize. In the sixth extinction, where humans exist, we can foresee
what might be "[**systemic** extinction]{.underline}." This [would
emerge when humans **design** the world]{.underline}, whether
deliberately or not, [for **total repression** and
destruction]{.underline}, as seen in his notion of a Shriek extinction
[based on **elites construct**ing a **global totalitarian
regime**]{.underline}.

Systemic extinctions are existential risks that arise from the major
institutional systems -- whether economic or political -- created by
humans. Bangs of global nuclear war and run-away climate change would
represent systemic extinction. They arise out of military and "security"
systems as well as fossil fuel driven capitalist societies leading
toward both of these forms of "Bangs." Indeed, our book focuses on
"[**systemic** extinction]{.underline}," and, more specifically, [on
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and global
**capitalism** that]{.underline} we argue [is **destined** to create
**inevitable** extinction unless we **undertake urgent systemic
change**]{.underline}.21

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

Extinction Denialism Despite the growing and more widely discussed
prospects of extinction, and the rise of "systemic extinction," we are
witnessing, in many conservative movements around the world and, in
extreme form in the Republican Party of the United States, what can be
called Extinction Denialism. The denial of man-made climate change in
the Republican Party leadership has led the world-famous critic, Noam
Chomsky, to argue that We might stop for a moment to ponder on most
extraordinary fact. A major political organization in the most powerful
country in the world's history is quite literally dedicated to the
destruction of much of life on earth. That might seem to be an unfair
comment but a little reflection will show that it's not.22 Donald Trump
became the emperor without clothes here, openly ridiculing climate
change and arguing -- in relation to extinction by nuclear war -- that
"it makes no sense to have nuclear weapons if we aren't ready to use
them."23 During the deep freeze of the Midwest in early 2019, something
climate scientists showed was extreme weather predicted by their climate
change models, Trump saw it as a huge joke about the fear of climate
change, saying "we could use some more global warming right now." In
2017, Trump also ordered all agencies of the federal government to
expunge the words "climate change,"24 punishing any employee using the
words. Extinction denialism includes tendencies among both conservatives
and liberals to diminish the concerns about nuclear war that were
present in the public discourse during the Cold War. And [the denial of
the **existential dangers** of unfettered economic growth]{.underline}
and profit-seeking in a finite world is even deeper. [Such denial is
**central to sustaining the profits** and power of the "masters of the
universe" running the global capitalist system]{.underline}'s largest
banks, corporations and states. This hints that extinction, much like
racism, is "systemic," a function not just of rotten leaders but of the
way we organize our ruling economic and political institutions. And the
denial is systemic too, built into not just the Republican Party but
much of the corporate and political world, as we show in later chapters.
Millions of people, nonetheless, are beginning to wake up, especially,
in the United States, after the election of President Biden and
President Trump's defeat. A new awakening about climate change began to
spread not only among activists fighting pipelines and fracking but
among millions of ordinary Americans supporting Biden's climate agenda.
The astonishing extreme weather of 2021 -- filled with
once-in-a-millennium [floods, record drought, fires, and record
**heat**]{.underline} -- reaching 130 degrees in Death Valley and a
record 121 degrees in British Columbia, Canada -- made many realize
[climate disaster is]{.underline} not [a]{.underline} future
[threat]{.underline}; it is here in spades right **[now]{.underline}**.
Western opinion polls in 2021 showed rapidly growing concern among the
majority of Americans about climate change.25 But even for the emerging
majority scared by the experience of the COVID-19 pandemic and now
frightened by the extreme weather, climate change for the majority does
not deeply intrude into their daily thoughts or behavior -- or propel
them into urgent political action. [Even for those believing in
human-caused climate change and a possibility of major nuclear or cyber
conflict, or a pandemic that races out of control, the **extinction
nightmare** is more a cognitive concern]{.underline} than a gut-level
obsession. And for many, including politicians, who back a [political
response]{.underline}, it [is often **too slow**]{.underline}; as
climate author and activist Bill McKibben has said on climate, "winning
slowly is the same as losing."26 Ask yourself these four questions about
your reaction to the extinction threat, whether of climate change or
nuclear war: Does it keep you up at night? Do you cry about it? Does it
make you ask whether it's moral to have kids? Does it mobilize you to
act politically to save life on the planet? You can be aware of the
truth of climate change and the nuclear threat -- and the perils of
run-away capitalist growth -- and still answer "no" to any or all these
questions. If so, you are still living in a kind of Extinction
Denialism. If would be as if you were told you had cancer, but don't
respond as if the knowledge made any difference. Or you simply can't
deal with it emotionally or feel you'll be dead by the time extinction
truly kills us. Either way, that's a way of being in denial. There is a
spectrum of denialism ranging from complete disbelief, to partial
awareness, to full cognitive understanding without the knowledge getting
into your gut and driving you to urgent action. Unless you act, you are
in denial! While elites in many nations, including President Biden in
the United States and President Xi in China and leaders in Europe,
recognize the existential threat and are proposing major new climate and
COVID-19 agendas, they are not sounding the emergency alarm and
activating the all-out emergency public mobilization and far-reaching
agenda that is required. Leaders have to encourage a culture where
people answer "yes" to the four questions above, but that would have big
consequences. It would threaten ruling elites and the system of power
they benefit from in the here and now. We have seen this movie before.
British journalist and influential climate change author, George Monbiot
notes that ruling elites historically have typically been more likely to
promote than prevent collapse because of the shortterm gains for
themselves, writing that one scholar: The social science professor Kevin
MacKay contends that oligarchy has been a more fundamental cause of the
collapse of civilizations than social complexity or energy demand.
Control by oligarchs, he argues, thwarts rational decision-making,
because the short-term interests of the elite are radically different to
the long-term interests of society. This explains why past civilizations
have collapsed "despite possessing the cultural and technological
know-how needed to resolve their crises". Economic elites, which benefit
from social dysfunction, block the necessary solutions.27 [Ruling elites
-- what we now call the 1% -- perpetuate systems that will eventually
destroy them and **everyone** else, to protect their short-term
interests]{.underline}. Monbiot notes that: [The oligarchic control of
wealth, politics, media and public discourse explains the
**comprehensive institutional failure**]{.underline} now [pushing us
towards **disaster**]{.underline}. Think of Donald Trump and his cabinet
of multi-millionaires; the influence of the Koch brothers in funding
rightwing organisations; the Murdoch empire and its massive contribution
to climate science denial; or the oil and motor companies whose lobbying
prevents a faster shift to new technologies.28 The denialism of much of
the corporate 1% and their conservative political allies, especially the
Trumpist GOP, is still on full display. [Virtually all GOP leaders and
millions in their base]{.underline} -- as well as their apologists on
Fox News, such as Tucker Carlson who rails against climate policy as
socialism and COVID-19 vaccines as government tyranny -- [continue to
deny man-made climate change]{.underline}. They demonize and ridicule
the Biden climate and COVID-19 proposals as well as the activists
seeking even bolder action on climate, nuclear war or even COVID-19. And
conservative leaders in Brazil, the Philippines, Hungary and many other
countries continue rule with their own versions of denialism. Moving
beyond extinction denial is the first step in any movement to save all
life. It is an integral part of the new politics of extinction that can
preserve the planet. It is also the first step away from collective
insanity. To deny the threat of extinction of all life at this stage of
history is delusional and unbelievable -- it reflects a madness that
goes beyond anything even George Orwell could imagine. It also indicates
how the widely viewed rationality of capitalism is ultimately irrational
-- a system dependent on maintaining madness to perpetuate itself.
Earth's survival is going to depend on the resonance of the emergency
calls by people like the now world-famous teen climate activist, Swedish
teenager, Greta Thunberg, who thunders at adults that "you are stealing
our future." She won't eat meat, fly in a plane, or do anything else
that creates major carbon emissions. She leads school strikes by kids
that have mushroomed round the world -- with revolutionary calls to her
generation aiming not only to mobilize millions of children and
teenagers but also shame genocidally complicit adults, especially
wealthy elites, into emergency action: You only talk about moving
forward with the same bad ideas that got us into this mess, even when
the only sensible thing to do is pull the emergency brake. You are not
mature enough to tell it like it is. Even that burden you leave to us
children ... Our civilization is being sacrificed for the opportunity of
a very small number of people to continue making enormous amounts of
money ... It is the sufferings of the many which pay for the luxuries of
the few ... You say you love your children above all else, and yet you
are stealing their future in front of their very eyes ... We cannot
solve a crisis without treating it as a crisis ... if solutions within
the system are so impossible to find, then ... we should change the
system itself. We have not come here to beg world leaders to care ... We
have come here to let you know that change is coming, whether you like
it or not. The real power belongs to the people ...29 Money and Madness:
Talking about Capitalism With the fresh eye of a teenager, Thunberg is
onto the role of money, profits, and corporate elites in driving
extinction. She is ahead of most adults. While some parts of the
environmental movement and antiwar movement have discussed the climate
dangers of corporate capitalism, the idea that capitalism fuels
extinction is mainly off the table. Indeed, many American liberals as
well as conservatives view US-style capitalism as the solution rather
than the problem, the only system capable of bringing technological
innovation or global integration in a way that can ultimately prevent
extinction. Even those who see a connection between capitalism, climate
change, pandemics, and war may be reluctant to talk about capitalism,
believing that any focus on changing our economic system is such a long
and difficult proposition that to focus on it will simply drag out and
intensify the extinction threat. And many progressive Americans, who
worry about climate change, recognize that just a mention of the word
"socialism" will turn off millions of people, with leaders such as Trump
and many Republican politicians today using it as the bogey-man of all
evil and the end of freedom. The social critic Naomi Klein titled her
best-seller on climate change, This Changes Everything. 30 When all life
is threatened with being snuffed out, something people have never before
experienced in human history then, yes, it does change everything. And
that includes changing what we can and must talk about, including the
formerly sacred subject of capitalism. Since the economic system is so
deeply intertwined with the extinction threat, everything about our
economics and politics is now on the table -- and as extinction looms
closer and larger, subjects like changing capitalism itself, even in
capitalist America, will no longer remain taboo. We see it even in the
United States, where talking critically about capitalism is harder than
in most other countries. Yet millions of US young people have already
opened their hearts and minds to a critical conversation about
capitalist economics and saving the planet. This new conversation must
catch fire and create transformative action now because it is already
almost too late.

\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUME\>\>

Capitalism and Survival

In the chapters that follow, we flesh out in some detail why
[**corporate** capitalism]{.underline}, particularly the neoliberal type
[in the **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, now [threatens
survival and makes extinction **perils systemic**]{.underline}, for five
reasons briefly mentioned below.

First, [capitalism is]{.underline} a system [organized **around profit**
as the **central goal**. Any effort to put **other goals** above profit,
including social and environmental]{.underline} protection, [is in
**tension** with capitalism **itself**]{.underline}. As a system
breeding ever more inequality, **[class divisions]{.underline}** between
billionaires and struggling workers [take on a more **life-and-death
quality**. This]{.underline} helps [**de-sensitize**
decision-makers]{.underline} to the broader extinction of all life
through climate change or war.

Second, [maximizing profit **requires removing limits** to
growth]{.underline}.

[Any company that **puts limits** on]{.underline} its [growth will
eventually **reduce profit margins** and **succumb** to **competitors**
who seek **max**imum **growth**]{.underline}. Yet because we live on a
finite planet, a system that cannot accept limits to growth, and is
always hungrier to extract oil and exploit more workers, is incompatible
with human and planetary survival.

Third, [maximizing profit]{.underline} has always
**[require]{.underline}**d [capitalist **wars**]{.underline}. European
colonial wars led to mass death but did not create the threat of total
life extinction. But with World War II, invention of the nuclear bomb
made war itself an extinction threat, because [any war can now
**escalate** to **nuc**lear **conflict**, a major threat of
extinction]{.underline}.

Fourth, [capitalism seeks to **privatize** and **sell**]{.underline}
virtually [everything in **global markets**]{.underline} -- [both are
**inherently destabilizing imperatives**]{.underline}. But a sustainable
and peaceful society requires massive investment in public goods, which
are aimed at maximizing the well-being and health of people and all life
species rather than maximizing profit. The ultimate public good is
sustaining human survival itself.

Fifth, [capitalism generates **consent**]{.underline} -- [and vests
itself with **moral legitimacy**]{.underline} -- by calling the market
the source of freedom and cultivating fear and hatred of government. But
survival now requires an affirmative view of expansive government and
public goods at all levels; it is the only way to create essential
public goods.

The United States and Survival

[Extinction is]{.underline} a global threat, [rooted in a **globalizing
capitalism** system]{.underline}, as well as the global political elites
and culture tied and subject to that system. But while global systems
continue to grow, we also continue to live in world of national states.
While extinction is inherently a global crisis, every country plays its
own role in shaping the threat and prospects for sustaining survival of
life.

[The **hard truth** is that the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [is the **leading** "extinction
nation,"]{.underline} a fact that every American needs to understand in
his or her gut. More than any other nation, [**American policies** are
**fueling** the existential threat to human civilization]{.underline}.
The **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [**lead** the race
to extinction]{.underline} partly [because it is **indisputably** the
**most powerful nation** on the **planet**. It has a **larger role**
than any other nation in **setting**]{.underline} the **[global
rules]{.underline}** of the game. [America's **unique brand** of
capitalism]{.underline}, neoliberalism, also [plays a **central role**.
It requires US elites to **slash public goods**]{.underline}, cut taxes,
[**reduce welfare**, **deregulate** corporations, **sell off** public
**lands**, and other policies that make neoliberalism an **engine** of
extinction]{.underline} dangers.

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

Aggravating matters -- all these rollbacks fuel far-right forces of
reaction, the very alienated and aggrieved voices animating Republican
political projects in the United States and the world over. While the
United States is a declining hegemon or empire, its politics, and ideas
still have enormous impacts on the world as a whole. As the threat of US
authoritarian and fascist movements -- exploding in the January 6
attempted coup and continuing in the ongoing Trumpist Republican Party
attack on democracy itself -- took center stage in the United States,
parallel Far Right movements emerged throughout much of the world. The
extinction threats of climate and war are paralleling and intensifying
the threat of the extinction of democracy in the United States and
elsewhere. Indeed, these two categories of existential threats are
intertwined, feeding and fueling each other, as we show later in this
book. In the final chapter, we address how it is that the Far Right, an
enduring presence through much of American history (and subject of
several books by Derber) may be countered by a Front for Survival, one
which is global in scope but necessarily also anchored the United
States. The good news for the United States is that as the country most
responsible for endangering survival, it has great power to turn things
around. This is not to say that the United States can solve the crisis
because that will take new and powerful global change: the rise of new
global social justice movements, cooperation, treaties, and governance.
But global solutions are not likely to happen fast enough without the US
seizing the moment, something that many Americans hope the Biden
Administration will do, pushed hard by millions of new activists in
popular movements for justice, democracy, and survival itself. In Part
I, we offer an analysis of how the history and spread of global
capitalism are putting us on the road to disaster. In Part II, we turn
to the United States, showing how it is the most powerful country
putting the pedal to the extinction medal. And finally, in Part III, we
look to the solutions, focusing on the new "abolitionist" movements,
briefly discussed below. Toward a New Abolitionism Survival requires a
new abolitionist movement. The famous US 19th-century abolitionists,
such as Frederick Douglass, the former slave who became the most famous
orator of his era, and William Lloyd Garrison, organized to abolish
slavery centering their efforts, first and foremost, on the suffering
and rebellions of the enslaved themselves. We now need to abolish carbon
emissions and nuclear weapons, and transform the economy driving them
and perpetuating other extinction threats including those of
over-production and rapidly shrinking biodiversity. And, while this
seems a nearly impossible dream, much like the abolitionist call for
ending slavery, it is potentially within our reach. Indeed, the United
Nations and the US Democratic Party have already called for abolishing
the creation of fossil fuel pollution by 2030. And a significant number
of scientific and grassroots peace groups have been organizing for
several decades to eliminate all nuclear weapons on earth. Moreover
questions about the morality and legitimacy of an economic system
producing billionaires while neglecting the needs of most working people
for basic housing, health care, and a living wage have begun to energize
a new politics among young people women, people of color and
progressives throughout the world. The United States must play a major
role, but other nations have already advanced their own abolitionist
movements -- and may be the leaders in global abolitionism. But it
cannot succeed without US engagement, and there are signs from history
that US abolitionism is possible. Indeed, none other than President
Ronald Reagan in 1984 called for the abolition of nuclear weapons: After
his reelection in 1984, President Ronald Reagan sat for an interview
with Time magazine. "I just happen to believe that we cannot go into
another generation with the world living under the threat of those
weapons and knowing that some madman can push the button some place," he
said. "My hope has been, and my dream, that we can get the Soviet Union
to join us in starting verifiable reductions of the weapons. Once you
start down that road, they've got to see how much better off we would
both be if we got rid of them entirely." In his dealing with the
Soviets, Reagan's two terms were almost those of two different
presidents. Both the hard-liner and the peacemaker were present
throughout, but the balance shifted so decisively from one to the other
as to create a discontinuity. The man who had denounced the nuclear
freeze as Soviet propaganda was now suggesting not just reduction but
elimination of all nuclear weapons.31 If the ultra-Conservative Ronald
Reagan could overcome denialism and become a nuclear abolitionist, there
is hope that a majority of Americans could become new abolitionists.
Reagan's evolution is worth noting: What explains Reagan's remarkable
transformation from Cold War hawk to nuclear peacemaker? His nuclear
abolitionism had deep roots, going back to a flirtation with pacifism in
the early 1930s. His antiwar side was connected to narratives and images
that deeply affected him: seeing the British antiwar play Journey's End
in 1929, being shown footage from the liberation of Auschwitz in 1945,
and watching the ABC television movie The Day After in 1983. A
projection that stuck with him was that at least 150 million Americans
-- two-thirds of the population in 1980 -- would be killed in an all-out
nuclear war, though he believed for some reason that Soviet losses would
be limited to a much smaller percentage. Advisers who "tossed around
macabre jargon about 'throw weights' and 'kill ratios' as if they were
talking about baseball scores" appalled him. In his diary and to aides,
Reagan even worried that the biblical prophecy of Armageddon was at
hand.32 While Reagan's "conversion" is a sign of hope, it is misleading
as a solution to the extinction crisis. Even if we were able to abolish
nuclear weapons -- in the spirit Reagan suggested -- they would probably
have been rebuilt without a larger shift in our politics away from the
ruling system based on war and corporate expansion. We need a broader
change to truly end the extinction threat, much as the 19thcentury
abolitionists needed a transformation in the entire economic and
political system of the United States, including the North, to put a
permanent and sustainable end to slavery, something yet not fully
achieved in the institutionalized racism pervasive in prisons, housing,
inequality, and geographic distribution of pollution. The abolition of
nuclear bombs and even carbon emissions is essential to preventing
extinction. But to be a sustainable change, it cannot happen without
deeper change. This challenge to change the larger system --
particularly in a short period -- seems an impossible agenda in light of
the urgency of the extinction crisis. But history has offered other
examples where humans have mobilized to transform whole systems of
destruction and death in relatively short periods, beyond just the
anti-slavery abolitionist movement itself. One might think of the
successful movement to eliminate apartheid in South Africa, which
required transforming the entire political and cultural systems and
power elites running the country for many decades. Or the successful
change to end the British Empire by Gandhi and the anti-colonial
movement in India, along with many other former colonies rising to push
out their rulers in the anti-colonial revolutions of the 1950s, 1960s,
and 1970s. In this book, we will use the example of the abolitionist
movement that worked to do the impossible: abolish the institution of
slavery that had existed thousands of years and was integral to the
economic and political system not only of the South but the entire
United States. Before the Civil War, the North had slave-owners and made
some of its greatest profits off the slave trade and the sale of cotton
produced by Southern slaves. Abolitionism undermined the immorality that
sustained the South and enriched much of the North, fighting for what
could only have been seen originally as a utopian and hopeless cause.
Nonetheless, abolitionism moved from a tiny movement of "dreamers" to a
mass movement that created a new moral consciousness awakening millions
to ultimately do the impossible: eliminate slavery. It did so by
strategically undermining the "immoral morality" that gave slavery
legitimacy and challenging the economic and political power of the tiny
number of elite planters who dominated the slave South and owned the
vast majority of slaves.33 Abolitionism achieved the unimaginable:
helping to awaken an entire society to the death culture, wrapped in a
culture of God and glory, at the center of the Confederacy. The
abolitionists also awakened millions to the barbaric economic
institutions that enriched slave holders and made clear that
overthrowing the system was the greatest moral imperative of the age.
The abolitionist movement is just one of several transformative
movements in US history that offer hope. In the 19th century, the
populist movement, bred by a collapse in the farm economy and the rise
of the Robber Barons, fought for popular control over the nation's
financial system and broader economy.34 Populism of that era could be
seen as an anti-extinction movement waged by farmers to save the
agrarian economy and US democracy. While the populists didn't succeed,
it led to progressive movements culminating in the 20th century in the
New Deal, which had its own elements of an anti-extinction movement. In
the Great Depression of the 1930s, the US economy collapsed and a
long-term unraveling of the American experiment seemed possible. This
can be seen as a type of national extinction threat -- and FDR saw his
New Deal as essential to saving the nation from collapse. His New Deal
progressives, allying with a new fiery labor movement, advocates for the
homeless and hungry and for old people without social security,
including outright socialists and Communists, came together to stop the
extinction threat of that era and ultimately succeeded in helping the
nation survive. The New Deal showed that the abolitionists' emancipatory
struggle had an enduring legacy, passed down from the abolitionists
themselves to the 19th-century populists and then the early progressives
and New Dealers of the 20th century. The activist movements of the 1960s
can be seen as another stage where the emancipatory torch of the
abolitionists was seized by a new generation. The perpetuation of Jim
Crow threatened to tear the nation apart, and the civil rights movement
took up the abolitionist struggle to unite the nation again by
abolishing segregation and creating a new America based on principles of
racial equality. Likewise, in the shadow of the Cold War that threatened
nuclear extinction, activists against the war in Vietnam challenged the
morality of US militarism in the name of anti-Communism and tried to
stop an unjust war while preserving the world from blowing itself up.
Martin Luther King picked up the torch of abolitionism when he linked
civil rights with struggles for peace and social justice, calling for a
transformation in the ruling capitalist system as essential to racial
justice and survival in the nuclear age. In fact, King equated the evils
of capitalism with those of racism and militarism in his famous "Three
Evils" speech, adding that, Capitalism was built on the exploitation and
suffering of black slaves and continues to thrive on the exploitation of
the poor -- both black and white, both here and abroad.35 King became
the most important leader of 20th-century anti-extinction struggles that
called for visionary transformation of US race relations, war, and
capitalism. King's legacy is being re-awakened through the rise of the
massive anti-racist protests focusing not only on deaths caused by
police brutality but on "systemic racism." Black Lives Matter (BLM), now
supported by millions of whites as well as Blacks and other communities
of color, is increasingly seeing and protesting the intertwined crises
of racism, militarism, environmental destruction, and capitalism.
[COVID]{.underline}-19 helps [expose the **deadly deficits** of public
health and other public goods that are **integral to US capitalism** and
threaten survival in the age of COVID-19 and climate
change]{.underline}. Today we face a new moral crisis of the ruling
system and corporate elites of our era, which has created 21st-century
full-blown threat of extinction. But while the system proclaims itself
as the bastion of morality and liberty -- something also claimed by the
early Southern planter class -- we have now a political and economic
system hurtling toward the possibility of total human extinction,
cloaked in a moralism of prosperity and freedom by our ruling corporate
and capitalist system. Just as the abolitionists of the past united
peoples and movements in a universal moral cause against the "morality"
of slavery and the plantation system it served, so today, we need to
embrace a new abolitionism that challenges the enslavement of our
societies and most people in the world to corporate power and markets
whose blindness and greed now lead inevitably toward climate or nuclear
extinction. The moral crisis of extinction, as of slavery, cannot be
challenged and overturned without attacking the centers of power in the
economy and state. While drawing on the history of the abolitionist
movement and later movements to help inspire a movement to make the
impossible possible, we need to recognize the limitations of all prior
historical movements. No historical movement has ever had to confront
today's totalistic threat of extinction of all life, since that threat
has never existed before. But history may still be our best guide, since
there are earlier dire threats which movements have sought to meet.
Movements that confronted enormous moral challenges -- such as
abolitionism -- had to mobilize systemic change and offer solutions to
intertwined crises of capitalism, environment, pandemics, and war. We
hope to show that 21st-century abolitionism is already emerging and may
yet unlock the secret to human survival. Part I The Hidden System of
Extinction 1 The Extinction Triangle Capitalism, Environmental
Destruction, and Militarism Human extinction is now a very real
possibility with underlying causes rooted in the deepest systems of our
society. However, while parts of the extinction crisis are in clear
view, most people around the world have not put together a clear map of
the "extinction system," which has been denied or obscured by many of
the world's most powerful people and institutions, particularly in the
United States. In this chapter, we discuss the hidden triangle, a causal
chain showing how the looming prospect of extinction is driven by three
major intertwined threats to all life. The triangle is a global system,
and imperils life across the entire world, with national triangles also
existing in each country. It is largely invisible in most nations, and
especially in the United States, a matter of overwhelming importance
since the United States is the dominant global power and creates the
most toxic triangle. Saving humanity, saving ourselves, cannot happen
without exposing the triangle and overcoming it -- in the United States
and the entire world. As discussed in the Introduction, we are not
defining existential threats and extinction as only those leading to the
total destruction of all humanity and life on the planet. Following
Bostrom's analysis, we look at a range of catastrophic threats which, in
Bostrom's definition, "would either annihilate earth-originating
intelligent life or permanently and drastically curtail its potential."1
The "bang" form involves sudden total destruction of all life, but the
"crunch, shriek and whimper" threats are more prolonged and varied,
allowing some survival but restricting life and human development to the
point that they can be seen as a "softer" form of extinction. The idea
of a global extinction triangle linking capitalism, environmental
destruction (including climate change, pandemics, and biodiversity
collapse), and militarism (especially nuclear war) will be viewed in
many nations, and especially the United States, as itself madness. It is
so taboo that most analysts of climate crisis, pandemics such as
COVID-19, and nuclear war -- and indeed much of the climate and peace
movements -- avoid the subject of the capitalist system and the need for
systemic transformation like the plague. To take just climate, the
notion that the capitalist system drives climate change is highlighted
by only a few leading analysts, mainly on the Left. One is Naomi Klein,
who argues that extinction arises from "the collision between capitalism
and the planet" and that: We have not done the things that are necessary
to lower emissions because those things fundamentally conflict with
deregulated capitalism, the reigning ideology for the entire period we
have been struggling to find a way out of this crisis. We are stuck
because the actions that would give us the best chance of averting
catastrophe -- and would benefit the vast majority -- are extremely
threatening to an elite minority that has a stranglehold over our
economy, our political process, and most of our major media outlets.2
Klein acknowledges that "autocratic industrial socialism" can also cause
climate change, but argues that the ruling capitalist model is the major
risk and we need to pursue a democratic "eco-socialism" to save the
planet. Joining Klein in the laser-like but lonely focus on the
capitalist DNA driving extinction is the journalist, George Monbiot. He
writes that: Ecologically, economically and politically, capitalism is
failing as catastrophically as communism failed. Like state communism,
it is beset by unacknowledged but fatal contradictions. It is inherently
corrupt and corrupting. But its mesmerising power, and the vast
infrastructure of thought that seeks to justify it, makes any challenge
to the model almost impossible to contemplate. Even to acknowledge the
emergencies it causes, let alone to act on them, feels like electoral
suicide. As the famous saying goes: "It is easier to imagine the end of
the world than to imagine the end of capitalism." Our urgent task is to
turn this the other way round.3 Monbiot is not joking when he says our
most important task is to "turn this the other way round." While this
sounds daunting, imagining systemic change in the global capitalist
economy has become essential to human survival. In a period when there
is a new awakening about "systemic racism," we need now to expand our
consciousness about our economy, recognizing that we are now living in a
new stage of "extinction capitalism." Only systemic change in our
political economy can save us. Klein is Canadian and Monbiot is British.
These are both societies where it has long been possible to offer
critiques of capitalism without sounding like a crackpot. Both Britain
and Canada have labor or socialist parties, and mainstreamed the idea
that large parts of the society should be separated from profitmaking
and organized for the provision of public goods. These societies are
less complicit than the United States in climate and military policies
fueling extinction. In the United States, mainstream socialist political
parties do not exist, and "big government" and universal welfare
programs are seen as enemies of liberty, with the exception of an
enormous military. Klein and Monbiot have an audience in the United
States, but their views that to survive means moving beyond capitalism
and especially neoliberalism capitalism runs into huge hurdles,
especially in American political discourse, even among liberals.
However, we shall see that it is not an impossible dream, and that even
a President as moderate as Joe Biden, pushed by people of color, young
people, and social movements, has begun to break with neoliberalism and
shift toward a public goods economy that could help save the planet.
Crossing the Threshold: Humanity Confronts Its Final Stage Beginning in
the mid-1940s, when the United States attacked Japan with nuclear
weapons, we saw the emergence of the first period in human history --
now known as the Anthropocene -- in which capitalism began to threaten
both nuclear and climate extinction. As Noam Chomsky writes: Review of
the record reveals clearly that escape from catastrophe for seventy
years has been a near miracle and such miracles cannot be trusted to
perpetuate. On that grim day in August 1945, humanity entered into a new
era, the nuclear age. It's one that's unlikely to last long, either we
will bring it to an end or it's likely to bring us to an end. It was
evident at once that any hope of containing the demon would require
international corporation .... It was not understood at the time but a
second and no less critical new era was beginning at the same time. A
new geological epoch, by now, called the Anthropocene--an epoch defined
by extreme human impact on the environment. The Anthropocene and the
nuclear age coincide, a dual threat to the perpetuation of organized
human life. Both threats are severe and imminent. It's widely recognized
that we have entered the period of the sixth mass extinction.4

\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUME\>\>

Extinction denialism has limited public awareness of the new stage that
arose in the late 1940s but is rooted in the foundations of our economic
system. Indeed, [capitalism, **even as** it]{.underline} historically
helped [**build** new **econ**omic **grow**th and
**innovation**]{.underline} and pulled millions out of poverty, has
[**always create**d war and environmental destruction. Its]{.underline}
historical [**progress fuel**ed]{.underline} "development" that
catapulted the European and American world toward prosperity and
material well-being for two centuries. But that huge leap forward also
froze into society [an **unsustainable quest** for **unfettered growth**
threatening military and environmental catastrophe and **externalized**
multiple **costs**]{.underline} onto the peoples of the Global South.
The history of [capitalist **successes disguise**d **latent
crises**]{.underline} now [**surfacing** in the extinction stage.
The]{.underline} historical [benefits of capitalism have **not
disappeared**, but their relative value has **declined**]{.underline}
compared to the costs and risks -- ultimately of extinction.

The Triangle of Extinction: Mad Money

To save humanity and all life on the planet, we need to understand the
new extinction stage as rooted in a causal triangle of three intertwined
threats. The only way that humanity will survive is if the world --
including all states, peoples, and social movements -- come together to
dismantle the triangle and create a new circle of sustainable life
systems.

[Capitalism **drives** the **triangle** of extinction. Its very
nature]{.underline}, as a system, [**foments** militarism and drives
environmental destruction]{.underline}. In Chapter 2, we argue that
[capitalism's **constant need** to **expand** both its **resource base**
and its markets **fosters** a militarism to pry open markets and
"**protect**" investments]{.underline}. Territorial expansion across
national borders has a corollary in the capitalist dynamic to test and
break ecological thresholds, producing the third corner of the triangle,
environmental destruction.

However, these two corners -- militarism and environmental destruction
also feed back into, affect, and reinforce the logic of capitalism. Both
create the disasters that leave communities and states turning to
capitalists for solutions. The [soil fertility depletion]{.underline},
for example, [that capitalist agriculture produces, leaves us all more
dependent on the petrochemical and agro-industrial corporations selling
fertilizers and pesticides]{.underline}. Similarly, [capitalism's
**inherent instability**, particularly in the **American case**,
produces a "**military Keynesianism**," using **state spending** to
increase production and profits of **military companies**]{.underline}.
This, in turn, compromises democracy, giving weapons contractors
privileged access to the [state]{.underline}, rendering the latter
[dependent on the **"market" fortunes** of these
corporations]{.underline} (Figure 1.1).

\<\<FIGURE 1.1 OMITTED\>\>

\<\<FIGURE 1.2 OMITTED\>\>

As we contemplate this triangle, we must recognize that its dynamics
play out in social and historical structures that are profoundly
intersectional, ones characterized at the global, regional, and national
levels by evolving hierarchies including those of race, gender, class,
and states. A more complete picture of the triangle therefore looks like
this (Figure 1.2).

This second diagram spells out the variety of forms of environmental
destruction and militarism that create existential and extinction
threats, whether they be, in Bostrom's terms, forms of bang, crunch,
shriek, or whimper risks. In both pictures, we are adhering to the idea
that existential threats -- and extinction itself -- should not be
defined exclusively as total annihilation.

The second picture shows that there are several major existential risks;
among the risks in the environmental destruction corner are three
well-known ones, climate change, pandemics, and biodiversity loss. But
these interact with the others listed, as well as with the many other
risks that are less well known. Similarly, [militarism produces
**nuc**lear, **bio**logical/**chemical**, and **cyber**war risks.
All]{.underline} of these six varieties of [existential
risk]{.underline} are extremely important, [and]{.underline} all are
["**systemic**" in that they are]{.underline} partly [caused and
**fueled** by]{.underline} the United States and global [capitalist
system]{.underline}. All deserve urgent study leading to emergency
transformative change because each of them could create devastating mass
death from which humanity might not be able to recover. In addition to
these six existential risks, the clusters around each corner of the
second diagram also name other risks that may escalate into either
existential risks or radically reduce the quality of life and pose
civilizational risks.

[Chemicals on our planet move constantly between the Earth's crust, the
atmosphere, and bodies of water.]{.underline} The oceans and the
atmosphere are the main reservoirs, and if a chemical increases in
quantity in one of them, it will seep into the other, and vice versa.
This is true for all atmospheric chemicals: the oxygen we need to live,
the carbon dioxide we excrete, and the nitrogen, argon, and other inert
gasses that simply exist in the system.

Due to the enormity of the reservoirs, [the levels of the many chemicals
remain relatively constant and in balance over time. However, human
industry, driven by the unplanned anarchism of the capitalist market,
has changed that. As the capitalists have burned fossil fuels and
increased the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, the
ocean has experienced a commensurate change in its CO2 levels as
well.]{.underline}

Is this a problem for humanity or simply a fun fact about nature? Well,
you may have heard of coral reefs dying. Acidification of the oceans is
a direct cause. Because when CO2 dissolves in water, carbonic acid is
formed, lowering pH levels and increasing acidity.

[Coral and many other oceanic species use dissolved carbon dioxide to
build their skeletons.]{.underline} However, when the amount of carbon
dioxide in the water rises beyond a certain threshold, its
bioavailability decreases. [As this process continues to unfold, coral
reefs planet-wide will die. Many of them already have. And just as a
desert cannot sustain much life, neither can a dead coral
reef.]{.underline}

[Over half of the world's coral reefs have been lost since 1950, and 75%
of those remaining are at risk from local and global
stresses.]{.underline} An estimated one billion people worldwide rely on
fish from coral reefs as their main source of protein. With oceanic
ecosystems collapsing, vast swathes of human society are under dire
threat.

[That the pursuit of profits through fossil fuel extraction and
consumption are the root cause of the problem is a scientific
fact.]{.underline} Emissions from the top fossil fuel companies are
responsible for more than half of ocean acidification since 1880. Just
20 companies, including BP, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and Royal Dutch Shell,
accounted for 23% of the total. Quarter after quarter and year after
year, [maximizing shareholder earnings has been prioritized over the
preservation of ocean life.]{.underline}

[The only way to stop this deadly trend is to remove the profit motive
from the fossil fuel industry. A workers' government would nationalize
this sector of the economy and harness humanity's collective ingenuity
to drastically reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere and the
oceans.]{.underline}

\[Savitri, \"Do Coral Reefs Produce Oxygen?,\" Techie Scientist, July

accessed 6-20-2022\]

But do these reefs merely add to the beauty of the marine ecosystem or
do they have other functions as well? It might come as a surprise to
many, but [coral reefs]{.underline} also [play a **vital** role in
helping us to breathe]{.underline}.

Do coral reefs produce oxygen? Yes, they do. Although [coral
reefs]{.underline} cover only 0.0025% of the ocean floor, they [are
responsible for producing **half** of the oxygen present in]{.underline}
the [Earth's atmosphere]{.underline}. It is the symbiotic relationship
between corals and an alga, zooxanthellae, that makes this miraculous
phenomenon possible.

Isn't it amusing that these reefs only cover up such a little portion of
the ocean floor and can still produce such a significant amount of
oxygen? [They're **crucial**]{.underline} not only **[for our
existence]{.underline}** but also for the existence of marine life.

In this article, we will get to know about how coral reefs produce
oxygen, how they're a region for thriving biodiversity, and the factors
responsible for their survival.

Let's dive deep into the coral reefs.

What are Coral Reefs?

A coral reef can be considered a vast ecosystem that consists of
colonies of hundreds of tiny living corals. Each of the corals is
referred to as a "polyp".

These corals have branch-like structures; most of them possess a hard,
protective shell that is made of calcium carbonate. They also have
varying sizes and colors.

When these tiny corals of different colors and sizes grow together in
hundreds and thousands, they gradually form a reef.

Did you know that it takes about a year for a 10-centimeters polyp to
grow? The time taken for a coral reef to fully grow ranges from a
hundred thousand to 30 million years.

It means that the coral reefs we see today have been developing for over
ten thousand years. It also means that if these are depleted, it will
take them thousands of years to replenish; they might even go extinct
for all we know.

Types of Coral Reefs

We can all agree that the marine world is still largely unexplored.
However, so far, we have found four different types of coral reefs.

Let's learn more about all of them:

Barrier Reefs

The coral reefs that are parallel to the coastline but are separated by
a wide lagoon, or any other water body, are called Barrier Reefs. Here,
the term "barrier" is used because these reefs create a barrier between
the coast and the ocean at the shallowest point, reaching the water's
surface.

Australia's Great Barrier Reef is the most popular example of a barrier
reef. It also happens to be the largest barrier reef in the entire
world.

Patch Reefs

Patch reefs are patches of isolated coral reefs that are close to each
other but are separated by sand rings. These reefs are usually found in
a collective reef in shallow lagoons and occur under 10-20 feet of
water.

Patch reefs are commonly found in the Bahamas, the Pacific Islands,
Bermuda, and the Caribbean Islands.

Atolls

When you see rings of coral reefs surrounding a lagoon, they are known
as Atolls. Atolls are usually found in the middle of the ocean.

Some of the famous examples of atolls are the Funafuti and the Fuji
atolls in the Ellice Islands.

Fringing Reefs

The coral reefs that grow very close to the coast are called Fringing
Reefs. These reefs are usually attached to the shoreline, but the
portion at their back could be shallowly submerged in the water.

Fringing reefs are the most common coral reef variety.

How do coral reefs produce oxygen?

As we have mentioned earlier, coral reefs produce oxygen due to their
symbiotic relationship with an alga called zooxanthellae.

But have you ever wondered what a symbiotic relationship means?

A symbiotic relationship is an intimate relationship between two
different organisms of different species. In this type of relationship,
both organisms interact, out of which at least one organism benefits.

Along with zooxanthellae, other algae inside the coral tissue carry out
photosynthesis as well. These algae provide the corals with food and
energy. Now you might be wondering what the corals can offer to the
zooxanthellae and other algae in return?

The corals provide these algae with a shelter to live. They also provide
them with carbon dioxide to carry out the process of photosynthesis.

Thus, it is actually the algae that produce half of the Earth's oxygen
while being in a symbiotic relationship with the coral reefs.

Fun facts: Did you know that it is zooxanthellae that provide the
awestruck colors to the corals?

Factors responsible for the survival of coral reefs

Now that we've learned all about coral reefs and their importance, we
can agree that their survival is crucial for the survival of humans and
all other living organisms.

But what do these reefs need to survive? That's what we will talk about
in this section.

Coral reefs have five necessities that can affect their survival, and
all of them are listed below. Keep reading to learn more:

1\. Coral reefs need sunshine

Because coral reefs can't grow below 165 feet, they are always found in
shallow waters. But have you ever wondered why that is?

It is because they require sunshine to survive. Sunlight is essential
for algae to carry out the process of photosynthesis and produce oxygen.
Coral themselves depend on the algae, zooxanthellae, to get oxygen and
live.

2\. Coral reefs need warm water

Corals that build reefs need warm water to live. But warm water doesn't
mean that they can survive at any temperature.

Different types of coral reefs can tolerate only a range of
temperatures. They can survive between the warmth of 68 to 90 degrees
Fahrenheit or 20 to 32 degrees centigrade.

3\. Coral reefs need clear water

Coral reefs need clear water for their survival because sunlight can
pass only through clear waters and not dense or opaque waters.

Organisms like plankton can cloud the water, which prevents sunlight
from reaching the algae present on corals, which is problematic for
photosynthesis.

4\. Coral reefs need clean water

Pollutants and various sediments can easily damage the corals. Wondering
how? By making the water cloudy and preventing the sunlight from
reaching them. The presence of sediments in water can, thus, destroy
corals.

If wastewater is ever released near coral reefs, it will destroy them.
It is because nitrogen, the most common nutrient present in wastewater,
is known to impair coral growth.

5\. Coral reefs need a saltwater

Have you ever found coral reefs in a water body that contains purely
freshwater? Probably not. It is because the corals need the presence of
salt in water for their growth and are, thus, always formed in seawater.

Coral Reefs: a zone of thriving biodiversity

Before diving into how and why coral reefs have become the hub of
biodiversity, let's discuss what do is meant by the term "biodiversity"?

Biodiversity is a term that refers to the existence of an enormous
variety of living organisms present on the surface of the Earth in
different ecosystems, along with different environmental factors like
temperature, oxygen levels, and climate.

Now, what makes a coral reef a thriving zone for biodiversity? The
production of oxygen by coral reefs explains the presence of a wide
variety of species found near them. They also provide a home and shelter
to these living organisms.

How many species of organisms do you think we can find around coral
reefs? Thousands of species of organisms are seen on and around them.
Additionally, we can also find marine animals like sea turtles, sharks,
and stingrays around them.

Coral reefs are the sole reason for many species to come together and
create an ecosystem. They provide the resources for them to live and
thrive, preventing them from being endangered or extinct.

It is as if the reefs act as magnets for different species. Such is the
concentration of species inhabiting the coral reefs that many of them
are not even known yet. Researches are still conducted around coral
reefs to find out new organism species.

Thus, the coral reefs' function of producing oxygen in such high amounts
brings together thousands of flora and fauna, creating a zone of
thriving biodiversity.

Are the coral reefs dying?

Coral reefs are the most diverse ecosystems in the seas and oceans. In
fact, it wouldn't be wrong to say that they are a part of the reason
behind all life on Earth.

However, nowadays, this essential resource is slowly getting depleted
because of a range of destructive human activities.

Scientists have predicted that if we proceed at this rate, the existence
of all the coral reefs will be threatened (on the brink of extinction)
by the year 2050.

What does it mean for us? [The extinction of coral reefs will lead to
the loss of half of the oxygen]{.underline} present [in the atmosphere,
which might]{.underline} end up **[threaten]{.underline}**ing **[our
existence]{.underline}**.

The following are some of the reasons behind the depletion of coral
reefs:

1\. Coral bleaching

When the ocean waters become warm, coral detach the oxygen-supplying
zooxanthellae from themselves. It leads to the corals losing their color
and inbuilt food sources, and, in turn, all the bleached corals turn
white.

And although corals can survive bleaching, they cannot survive being
subjected to repeated stress.

2\. Increasing sea levels

Nowadays, glaciers are melting because of global warming, which has led
to a rise in sea levels. And as sea levels are increasing, the coral
reefs become more submerged into the sea.

It will eventually lead to a decreased growth of corals, as they would
receive less amount of sunlight, which is essential to their survival.

3\. Overfishing

The practice of overfishing and unsustainable fishing near the coral
reefs leads to imbalances in the marine ecosystems. In addition to the
extinction of fish, it is also known to deplete some key reef species in
many locations.

Furthermore, some fishing gears can also inflict physical damage to
coral reefs, along with seagrass beds and other vital marine habitats.

4\. Water pollution

Discharging sewage and industrial waste into seawater introduces
pollutants and sediments to it, leading to water pollution.

And as we've mentioned earlier, the nutrients present in these
contaminants lead to the growth of weed and algae, which damage the
corals.

Conclusion

In this article, we have learned about how [coral reefs are **vital** in
**balancing** the **oxygen** of the atmosphere]{.underline}. These
[reefs play a **key role in our survival**]{.underline} as well as the
survival of marine creatures. Various phenomena like global warming and
pollution are directly or indirectly leading to the [depletion of the
coral reefs]{.underline}, which [can]{.underline} eventually [lead to
**our extinction** as well.]{.underline}

[Biodiversity is the **fabric of life on Earth** and the life support
system that **underpins planetary health** and **human
well-being**]{.underline} \[289\]. [Fossil fuels pose an existential
threat to]{.underline} the planet's [biodiversity]{.underline}. Fossil
fuels drive the climate crisis which is [accelerating species
**extinction risk** and **ecosystem degradation**]{.underline}, and
cause biodiversity harms [through fossil fuel **development** and
**petrochemical pollution**]{.underline}. In a destructive cycle, the
[fossil-fuel-driven degradation of wild places and loss of species
**worsens the climate crisis** by disrupting ecosystem-based carbon
dioxide removal]{.underline} from the atmosphere, [which is **needed to
curb global heating**]{.underline} \[290\]. Overall, fossil-fuel-driven
[**biod**iversity loss has]{.underline} direct and [dire impacts on
**food security** and nutrition, **water** quality and availability,
**health and well-being, carbon storage** and sequestration,
**resilience to climate change**, and]{.underline} almost all of
[nature's vital contributions]{.underline} \[291\], [on top
of]{.underline} the incalculable, non-monetizable costs of **[species
extinctions]{.underline}**.

Worldwide an estimated [one million animal and plant species are
threatened with extinction]{.underline}, with climate change as a
primary driver, [alongside habitat destruction and
exploitation]{.underline} \[292\]. [Scientists]{.underline} have long
[documented]{.underline} the widespread and growing stresses of
anthropogenic climate change on species and ecosystems, as **[rising
temperatures]{.underline}**, more **[extreme weather]{.underline}**
events, [**coastal flooding, sea ice and glacier melt**, and **other
climate hazards make conditions**]{.underline} more
**[inhospitable]{.underline}**. Climate change is disrupting species'
distributions, timing of breeding and migration, physiology, vital
rates, and genetics \[293--296\]. [It is **spreading disease** and
invasive species; increasing mortality and localized **extinctions**;
and **deteriorating ecosystem processes**]{.underline} \[297--299\].
Climate change-related local extinctions are already widespread \[300\].

**[Every increase in fossil fuel pollution and]{.underline}** resulting
**[climate stress pushes ecosystems closer to tipping points and
amplifies extinction risk]{.underline}**. With \~1.5°C temperature rise
as of 2024, the world's [coral reef ecosystems]{.underline}---[which
support a quarter of ocean life and]{.underline} the livelihoods of a
[half billion people]{.underline}---[are in crisis due to]{.underline}
increasingly frequent and severe bleaching events from [ocean heating
paired with]{.underline} ocean [acidification]{.underline} \[301\]. Half
of the world's reefs have already been lost \[302\] and near total
global reef col- lapse is projected at 2°C temperature rise \[66\]. An
estimated 1.6% of species are projected to become extinct at the current
level of temperature rise \[303\]. [Numerous studies have projected
**catastrophic species losses**]{.underline} with continued fossil fuel
pollution with, for example, the climate-related extinction of 14%--32%
of animal and plant species---representing the potential loss of 3
million to 6 million species---in the next 50 years, even under
intermediate fossil fuel emissions scenarios \[304\]. Scientists have
called for the urgent transformation of our energy system away from
fossil fuels to prevent a mass extinction event \[305\].

[Fossil fuel development itself]{.underline} also [causes a **wide array
of harms** to species and ecosystems: **destroying** and fragmenting
**wildlife habitat**, causing **air, noise**, and **light pollution,
contaminating** surface and ground **water** and reducing water
supplies, and **facilitating the spread of** ecologically disruptive
**invasive species**]{.underline} \[306--308\], [with similar harms in
the marine environment]{.underline} \[309\]. [Fossil fuel infrastructure
creates]{.underline} the [significant risk of **oil spills** and brine
spills, which can kill wildlife and cause long-term impacts over large
areas]{.underline} \[310\]. [The fossil fuel-based energy system has led
to **mortality, changes in behavior**, and **population
declines**]{.underline} in many species, [disruptions to community
composition, and loss of ecosystem function]{.underline} \[311, 312\].

### ! -- Deforestation

#### The Amazon is the [lynchpin]{.underline} of global climate mitigation\-\--stopping deforestation is [reverse causal]{.underline} with emissions.

**Wegrowski 19** \[Brandon Wegrowski is from southern California and is
a recent graduate of BYU\'s Human Resource Management program. 2019.

https://ballardbrief.byu.edu/issue-briefs/deforestation-in-the-amazon-rainforest\]
吳

According to one study, [**15%** of global CO2 emissions are attributed
to **deforestation**]{.underline}.77 However, [the Amazon's role in the
global management of climate and CO2 levels is **larger than
that**]{.underline}; [deforestation]{.underline} in the Amazon [leads
not only to carbon emissions during the logging process, but also from
**fires**]{.underline} caused by deforestation. The **[massive tree
loss]{.underline}** brought about by deforestation [has also led to a
decreasing level of CO2 **absorption**]{.underline} in the Amazon.

Researchers say that [the Amazon]{.underline}, which once used to be a
massive carbon sink, [may only be absorbing **half as much** carbon
dioxide as it did 20 years ago, mostly due to
deforestation]{.underline}.78 Furthermore, one study in 2019 found that
current prediction models for the Amazon's CO2 absorption, and their
accompanying assumptions, did not take into consideration the depleted
phosphorus levels in the Amazon's soil, which impacts a tree's ability
to take in CO2.79 As a result, the study revealed that these predictions
for absorption were inaccurate, as they were double the amount of
absorption actually taking place.80 In other words, [this data is
especially relevant to global climate change as the Amazon absorbs a
quarter of the carbon dioxide absorbed by all rainforests
**globally**]{.underline}---[a number which decreases with the **rise of
deforestation**]{.underline}.81 Annually, the world as a whole emits 40
billion tons of CO2 into the air, 2 billion tons of which is absorbed by
the Amazon rainforest.82

Deforestation's contribution to climate change and carbon emission
becomes cyclical when fire becomes involved. Slash-and-burn techniques
use fire to clear forest, which emits additional CO2 into the
atmosphere, along with the initial CO2 emissions that come with
deforestation. Subsequently, [stopping deforestation is widely
recognized as one of the most **effective fronts** on which to battle
climate change, as the **opposite effect** on carbon emissions can be
seen with **reductions in deforestation**]{.underline}.83

#### Amazonian deforestation causes [widespread desertification]{.underline}\-\--that [devastates]{.underline} food security [globally]{.underline}.

**Wegrowski 19** \[Brandon Wegrowski is from southern California and is

Deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest,
https://ballardbrief.byu.edu/issue-briefs/deforestation-in-the-amazon-rainforest\]
吳

The [significant loss of vegetation]{.underline} from deforestation in
the Amazon, [and therefore transpiration of water that comes from that
vegetation, **negatively affects water cycles** and triggers a **cycle
of desertification** and climate change]{.underline} not only in the
region, but also [around the **world**]{.underline}.84 Locally,
transpiration and evaporation accounts for 50-60% of rainfall in the
region of Amazonia, and shifts in such a large portion of the water
cycle have consequences across the globe.85

For example, in 2014, [Princeton University-led researchers reported
that widespread destruction of the Amazon rainforest could result in 20%
less rain in the **northwest United States**, and 50% less snowpack in
the **Sierra Nevada**]{.underline}. They also framed the implications of
these effects, noting that the snowpack in the Sierra Nevada Mountains
is an important source of water for irrigation in California's Central
Valley, and that California has been the United States' primary state
for food and dairy production for the past 50 years.86

Another study showed that [the effect of deforestation in the Amazon was
**strong on water cycles** around the world]{.underline}, reducing
precipitation and cloudiness on multiple continents, mostly in the
Americas, and of greatest note in the central United States.87 Some
research indicates that [these global water cycle shifts are so
**dramatic** they could potentially cause droughts in **important
agricultural areas** in **India, Africa, China, and the United States**,
where negative effects have **already been traced back** to Amazon
deforestation]{.underline}.88 89 However, additional changes in water
cycles and subsequent desertification beyond a regional scale are only
predicted to occur with much larger increases in Amazon deforestation.90

### ! -- Food Insecurity

#### That\'s a [threat multiplier]{.underline} that metastasizes into [extinction]{.underline}.

吳

But it is also true that [hunger and food insecurity can lead to
**instability**. There is a **vicious feedback loop** between conflict
and hunger currently at play in **dozens of countries** around the
world. War drives hunger and hunger **drives war**.]{.underline}

In 2017, the World Food Program USA (WFP USA) produced a report
titled Winning the Peace: Hunger and Instability. It was a comprehensive
review of the literature on "food-related instability"---or the ways
that hunger drives conflict. At the time, U.S. lawmakers knew
anecdotally that this relationship existed. Former Senate Agriculture
Committee chair Pat Roberts (D-KS) said in a 2015 speech, "Show me a
nation that cannot feed itself, and I'll show you a nation in chaos."
Others, like Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC), frequently warned that
providing humanitarian assistance in some of the world's most complex
emergencies was necessary to avoid more costly---in both blood and
treasure---engagements.

Winning the Peace provided a snapshot of what the academic community
knew about the relationship between food insecurity and conflict. [With
Russia's invasion of **Ukraine**]{.underline} in February of 2022, the
[lingering]{.underline} economic [impacts of the
**Covid**]{.underline}-19 pandemic, [and a rise in **extreme climate
events**]{.underline} around the world, [2022 was a year of
unprecedented **global hunger**. **Predictably**, global instability
rose in **tandem**]{.underline}. At least 12,500 protests occurred last
year in countries facing rapid food and fuel price increases.

Academic literature on food-related instability has grown significantly
in the last half decade. In fact, almost 50 percent of all the research
to be published on food-related instability over the past 20 years has
been produced in the last five years alone. A new report by WFP USA,
launched in April of 2023, aims to capture this latest thinking in a
review of [60 **peer-reviewed academic studies**]{.underline} produced
between 2017 and 2022. Dangerously Hungry is a study of studies. This
commentary is a literature review of such studies and discusses specific
drivers and motivators of food-related instability, and how to create an
improved framework for understanding of the complex relationship between
food insecurity and conflict.

Drivers of Food-Related Instability

This review [finds that food-related instability has **three main
drivers**: climate change, conflict over natural resources, and economic
shocks. ]{.underline}

\<\<CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

Almost half of all studies reviewed in Dangerously Hungry investigate
food-related instability through the lens of climate change:
precipitation change, drought, temperature spikes, desertification, and
other adverse climate events. This trend reflects tremendous growth in
climate security literature in recent years. Many of these studies focus
on food systems, often the first sector to feel the impacts of climate
change. One study from Kyung Hee University in South Korea, for example,
shows that high temperatures during corn growing seasons in sub-Saharan
Africa reduced yields and led to a rise in civil conflict. The author
suggests that with continued warming, civil conflict in the region is
expected to increase by over 30 percent in the coming decade. Meanwhile,
another Harvard University study finds that below-average rainfall can
increase the likelihood of civil war in Africa by as much as 2.3
percent. In Somalia specifically, a country plagued by long-term
droughts, decreases in annual precipitation across the country were
associated with an increase in domestic terrorist attacks between 1991
and 2019. The impact of climate change on food systems is driving
conflict around the world. A second driver of food-related instability
is competition over natural resources. Conflicts between pastoralists
and farmers in the African Sahel are among the most studied examples of
food-related instability in this space. Farmer-herder conflict or
"pastoralist violence" has increased greatly in the last decade in West
and Central Africa, particularly in Nigeria, central Mali and northern
Burkina Faso. This includes cattle raids, communal or ethnic violence
over land and water resources, and conflict driven by association with
violent extremist movements. These trends are exacerbated by
fast-spreading desertification and multi-year droughts across the
African Sahel. According to the African Center for Strategic Studies,
more than 15,000 people have been killed in farmer-herder related
conflicts in the last decade alone. Dangerously Hungry also sheds new
light on the ways that agricultural abundance has also been linked to
violence. For example, in studying the impacts of wheat and corn
production across Africa, Ore Koren of Indiana University suggests that
"contrary to previous expectations, conflict is driven by higher yields,
on average, and not by scarcity." In these situations of abundance,
rebel groups are more likely to use violence to secure access to food
resources. Indeed, he shows that the probability of rebel attacks
increased significantly in areas with high agricultural potential. This
is commonly referred to as "strategic conflict." What the author is
referring to in this case, however, is best considered "relative
abundance"---conflict over pockets of agricultural productivity in
otherwise scarce settings. Finally, food-related instability is driven
by economic shocks. The 2007--2008 global food price crisis led to
social unrest in at least 40 low- and middle-income countries in what
has been termed the "silent tsunami;" it was the subject of significant
attention in the Winning the Peace report. The food price crisis of 2022
bears remarkable similarities to 2008. According to analysis from the
International Food Policy Research Institute, food prices were on the
rise due to "uneven recovery from the COVID-19 crisis from surges in
global demand and supply disruptions from transport and logistics." This
confluence of stressors resulted in a global market that was unprepared
for the wheat, maize, oilseed, fuel, and fertilizer supply disruptions
caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. By the summer of 2022, more than
20 countries were facing protests and riots related, at least in part,
to high food prices. Peer-reviewed research on the 2022 global food
price crisis is still forthcoming, but several authors have already
estimated the downstream effects it has had, and will continue to have,
on conflict. Tufts University economist Eoin McGuirk and deputy director
of Stanford's Center on Food Security and the Environment, Marshall
Burke, for example, have studied the impact of Russia's war on Ukraine
on producer and consumer price indexes, and the effect of these indexes
on violence in Africa. They estimate that "the weighted average effect
of the Russian invasion to be an increase in intergroup conflict in
Africa of 5.3%." That is after considering the conflict-reducing effects
of increased prices for farmers across the continent; the economic
impacts in the agricultural sector are, after all, two-sided. It
continues to be the case that, generally, increased food prices lead to
reduced conflict in food-producing areas and increased conflict in food
consuming areas.

\<\<PARAGRAPH INTEGRITY RESUMES\>\>

Motivators of Food-Related Instability 

[Modern conflicts are almost never driven by a single cause. Food
insecurity is often referred to as "the straw that breaks the camel's
back" or a "**threat multiplier**" in conflict events]{.underline}. It
is true that [food insecurity]{.underline} alone is often not enough to
produce conflict; it [must]{.underline} also [be met with **external
motivators** that cause people to resort to violence]{.underline}, and
is strongly determined by the underlying social, political, and economic
context. Those motivators can be captured in three interrelated
concepts: desperation, grievance, and governance.

Often, the strongest motivator for participation in conflict is
economics. This is sometimes referred to as the opportunity cost thesis,
which states that when incomes are low and expected returns from
fighting outweigh the benefits of traditional economic activity, one's
motivation to join a militia or rebellion increases. Researchers refer
to this motivator as greed, a reference to the material benefits---even
extreme wealth---often anticipated by groups staging rebellion. In the
case of recruitment of food insecure populations to extremist movements,
though, it is not one's desire for wealth but one's inability to meet
their basic needs that is exploited. This is not greed, but
desperation. 

In interviews with former al Shabaab fighters in Somalia, socioeconomic
conditions were the most common motivator for joining. The authors of
that study, Anneli Botha and Mahdi Abdile, spoke to one fighter who
explained that he and his friends were lured with promises of a mobile
phone and \$50 a month upon joining. Other terrorist organizations have
employed similar recruitment tactics. The Islamic State, for example,
offered refugees food and cash payments of up to \$1,000 to join, and
Boko Haram has been shown to provide meals and loans to prospective
recruits. In many settings, [**violent extremist organizations** are
also known to capture the means of food production or agricultural
resources in order to **fuel their rebellion**. Food insecurity can
raise the cost of **mounting an insurgency**, leading to the
victimization of people who produce and hold food]{.underline}. Violence
against civilians, in other words, can be a resource mobilization
strategy.

The second category of motivation is grievance. One major criticism of
the opportunity cost framework (i.e., individual greed or desperation)
is its inattention to the collective action required for widespread
rebellion. Although it is true that individuals are motivated to engage
in violence due to unemployment, wage losses, and rising costs of living
(including food costs), collective agency---or a force that brings
people together---is also required for higher levels of violence. [Food
price riots are a good example of this grievance-based phenomenon, with
high food prices]{.underline} (especially for foods of cultural
importance) [**fueling frustration and mistrust** that cuts across class
and ethnic groups]{.underline}. Grievance, of course, can also be
divisive. In grievance-motived instability involving food, food
insecurity is often the straw that breaks the camel's back and [causes
societies to cleave along **preestablished lines** over perceived or
real inequalities or discrimination.]{.underline}

Finally, food-related instability is made more likely through poor
governance. The [inability of a government to ensure an adequate food
supply for its people can lead to questions over a **government's
legitimacy and ability** to fulfill its people's most basic
needs]{.underline}. In a 2017 report by the UN Development Program, the
authors note that 71 percent of voluntary recruits (to [extremist
groups]{.underline}) [identified government action as the **final
trigger** that motivated them to join the organization]{.underline}.
Limited government capacity to provide services or policing can create a
"vacuum effect," which is a dynamic that [provides an opening for rebel
groups to **offer an alternative**]{.underline} and
**[s]{.underline}**uggest that they themselves could provide those basic
services to people.

Conclusion

[Modern conflicts are not confined by political borders, and hunger
emergencies must be addressed before they metastasize into **large-scale
security threats**. U.S. lawmakers and officials are also becoming more
cognizant of the fact that food insecurity is of **consequence to
national security**]{.underline}. In October 2022, the Biden
administration released its U.S. National Security Strategy. At the time
of its writing, the world had reached record levels of food
insecurity---349 million people across 79 countries faced crisis levels
of hunger and almost one million people in Somalia, Afghanistan,
Ethiopia, Haiti, South Sudan and Yemen were experiencing famine-like
conditions. The 2022 U.S. National Security Strategy cited food on 30
occasions, more than double the highest-ever number of references in a
strategy document and more than 10 times the number of references than
the previous strategy. In late 2022 the U.S. Senate and Congress passed
resolutions---S.Res.669 and H.Res.922---condemning the use of food as a
weapon of war and bringing new resources to bear on the problem of
food-related instability.

### ! -- Overfishing

#### [Unsustainable]{.underline} practices drive fish migration, throwing [hundreds of millions]{.underline} into precarity.

stocks can build peace.,\" World Wildlife Fund,

Imagine a future where people and [countries are **fighting over
fish**]{.underline}. Communities, together made up of **[hundreds of
millions]{.underline}** of people, [have lost sources of **food** and
**income** because the **climate crisis** has **forced** fish
populations to **migrate**]{.underline} away from traditional habitats
to survive. [**Societal instability looms** because]{.underline} the
bounty that [the **ocean**]{.underline}s can provide [is growing
**increasingly unstable**]{.underline}.

[That **future** is **now**]{.underline}.

[**Fish stocks** are **on the move**]{.underline}. As climate change
drives shifts in ocean and weather cycles, fish populations are shifting
too. A recent study on climate-driven fish migration reports that [**23
percent** of **fish stocks** connected to countries' **territorial
waters** will move in the **next eight years**]{.underline}. By the end
of the century, it will be near 50 percent.

#### Overfishing leads to [great-power]{.underline} war.

**Bloom 18** -- commander in the U.S. Coast Guard. (Kate, Food Fight Why
[**the next** big **battle may**]{.underline} not [be fought
over]{.underline} treasure or territory---but for
**[fish]{.underline}**., *Foreign Policy*, Proquest)

Humans have always depended on the sea. For as long as there have been
fishermen, there have been conflicts over fish. And though it may seem
anachronistic, [the odds that a squabble over fishing rights could turn
into a **major armed conflict** are rising]{.underline}. [The return of
great-power competition has]{.underline} actually **[increased the
likelihood of a war over fish]{.underline}**. The past 17 years of the
fight against terrorism, and Washington's renewed focus on developing
high-end capabilities to prepare for great-power conflict, have led to a
lack of preparation for a low-end, seemingly mundane but increasingly
likely source of conflict in the world: food. As incomes rise around the
world, so too does the demand for food---especially protein. The United
Nations currently estimates that between mid-2017 and 2050, the number
of humans on Earth will rise by 29 percent, from 7.6 billion to 9.8
billion. Most of that population growth will occur in Asia, Africa, and
Latin America---areas where millions of people have recently risen from
deep poverty to the middle class. Part of a middle-class lifestyle is a
middle-class diet, which includes far more protein than poor people
consume. As a result of that shift, [the global demand for protein will
outpace population growth]{.underline}, increasing between 32 and 78
percent, according to some estimates. Meeting that demand could require
an additional 62 to 159 million metric tons of protein per year. [To
maintain political support at home, leaders must ensure access to the
high-quality food that is part of a middle-class lifestyle]{.underline}.
[The supply]{.underline} [of]{.underline} both wild and farmed [fish
will **not keep up**.]{.underline} The current annual global catch of
seafood is 94 million metric tons. And all around the world, the wild
populations of both migratory fish, such as tuna, and less mobile
species, such as flounder, are being overfished. Scarcity has already
forced Chinese fishing fleets further and further afield in search of
their catch. Serious international efforts to manage the world's wild
fisheries are underway, but this work is stymied by widespread
[illegal]{.underline}, unreported, [and unregulated]{.underline} (or
IUU) fishing. Today, such [harvests]{.underline} comprise somewhere from
20 to 50 percent of the global catch and [inflict]{.underline} economic,
social, and environmental [damage on some of the world's most vulnerable
populations **as fisheries collapse** from overfishing and poor and
rural fishing communities wrestle with the subsequent loss of income
and,]{.underline} eventually, their social fabric. The classic example
of this is fishermen in Central America turning to drug cartels for
employment or poaching from closed fisheries, feeding the cycle of
violence and environmental damage. [The political leaders of rising
powers will feel **enormous pressure** to secure]{.underline} the
[resources]{.underline} their citizens demand---even if it means
violating international norms and rules. [This pressure could **sow the
seeds of potential conflict** in two distinct ways. The first is that
some states will overplay their hand when using fishing
fleets]{.underline} and fisheries enforcement to exert influence in
contested waters. The second is [that illegal fishing]{.underline},
driven by exploding domestic demand and collapsing supply, [will be met
with increasingly aggressive enforcement]{.underline} by America or its
allies---[which could quickly escalate and spill over into actual
conflict]{.underline}. A damaged Vietnamese fishing boat, which was
reportedly rammed and sunk by a Chinese ship in the South China Sea, at
a Da Nang shipyard on June 2, 2014. (STR/AFP/Getty Images) The 1982
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, commonly referred to as
UNCLOS, is the foundational document for all maritime territorial
claims; more than 150 countries, but not the United States, have already
ratified the treaty. According to UNCLOS, a state can exclusively claim
any resource, including fish, within 200 nautical miles of the base
lines of the habitable landmasses it controls. Such areas are called
exclusive economic zones (EEZs). Each state is responsible for managing
its own fisheries within its EEZ. But beyond these exclusive zones,
regulation of fishing and activity on the high seas is managed by more
than 20 international and regional bodies, with widely varied mandates
and resources. Enforcement is carried out by a patchwork of agencies and
coalitions around the world, ad hoc partnerships, and bilateral
agreements among nations. If that arrangement sounds ripe for dispute,
it is. [There are dozens of contested maritime claims]{.underline}
around the world, including one between Canada and the United States
over two small islands off the coast of New Brunswick. Currently, the
most consequential of these contested waters are the South and East
China seas, where China has made outsized claims---accompanied by naval
patrols and an island-building campaign. Beijing hopes to legitimate its
territorial claims by establishing and expanding its physical presence
in these areas. Fishing vessels represent an ideal way to create that
presence---without provoking a military response---since they are
notionally nongovernmental and thus give their country of origin some
plausible deniability. They are also cheap compared with military
vessels and are more mobile and scalable than fixed structures such as
oil platforms (let alone man-made islands). For years, China has
subsidized and provided armed escorts for forays by its fishing fleet
into its neighbors' EEZs and assertively enforced Chinese law on
non-Chinese fishermen operating in contested waters. Since the 1990s,
China has unilaterally declared large swaths of the South China Sea
closed to fishermen for months at a time. This closure is enforced by
armed China Coast Guard vessels, which have been involved in a series of
violent confrontations with foreign fishermen. This heavy-handed
approach would be relatively unremarkable if the closed area was
actually recognized Chinese territory. In this case, however, China is
acting in international water or in the EEZs of other countries. The
situation is roughly analogous to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
using deadly force to stop Canadian deer hunters from shooting a doe out
of season in Vancouver. China Coast Guard and People's Liberation Army
(PLA) Navy vessels also appear to have stepped up escorts of
Chinese-flagged fishing fleets as they venture into fishing grounds,
particularly those around a set of contested islands in the East China
Sea known as the Senkaku in Japan and the Diaoyu in China. The Japan
Coast Guard has responded by increasing its own presence in the area.
Should a China Coast Guard or PLA Navy vessel fire on a Japan Coast
Guard ship, supposedly in defense of a Chinese fishing fleet, the
Japanese would likely retaliate, and both sides could easily escalate.
There are other ways that fish can trigger war. Crackdowns on illegal
and unregulated fishing already routinely threaten to spiral into
violence. China currently consumes a third of the global fish catch.
Officials there have made it clear that they believe that meeting the
expectations of their increasingly affluent population is key to
preserving political stability---and thus is a core national security
interest. But despite participating in the international bodies
dedicated to improving fisheries regulation and maritime governance,
such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) and the International
Maritime Organization (IMO), the environmental advocacy group Greenpeace
estimates that China has the world's largest distant-water fishing
fleet, with more than 2,500 vessels, and has been accused of
industrial-scale IUU fishing in waters as far away as those off the
coast of Senegal and Argentina, where China cannot even pretend to have
territorial claims. READ MORE This picture taken on April 23, 2016 shows

Can Indonesia Afford a Fish War With China? Jakarta needs Beijing's

triggering violent conflicts]{.underline}. Consider a hypothetical---but
plausible---example in which Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro trades
his country's fishing rights to China, as other impoverished countries
have done, to cover part of Venezuela's \$60 billion in outstanding
debts. China would then have legal claim to Venezuelan waters, some of
which could be contested given Venezuela's history of border disputes
with Guyana and Colombia. [If Beijing continues to expand]{.underline}

collapse]{.underline} around 2050, [as current trends suggest they will,
national governments are going to feel **intense pressure** to ensure a
regular food supply for their populations]{.underline}. [This pressure
could lead more powerful countries to try to grab the resources of
smaller or vulnerable neighbors]{.underline}. **[Russia]{.underline}**
and the United States might also be [**tempted to establish claims**
against one another in the waters that separate Alaska and
Siberia]{.underline}. The U.S. Coast Guard has conducted patrols in the
Bering Sea since 1867, the year of the Alaska Purchase. (In 1990, U.S.
Secretary of State James Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze signed an agreement to establish a maritime boundary line
between the USSR and the United States. The U.S. Senate ratified the
agreement, but neither the leaders of the collapsing Soviet Union nor
their Russian successors followed suit.) As pressure on fisheries
increases, Russian leaders may decide that it is time to challenge the
de facto border outright. The opening of the Arctic, combined with
Russia's significantly larger Arctic-capable fleet and infrastructure,
would enable Moscow to mount a credible challenge to U.S. control of one
of its richest fisheries. The news isn't all grim. Fish farming has
exploded from producing 5 million metric tons in 1981 to 63 million
metric tons in 2011. Even though naysayers point out that fish farms are
highly vulnerable to the spread of diseases, and environmental advocacy
organizations are worried about their ecological impact, the U.N. Food
and Agriculture Organization predicts that by 2030, farmed fish will
make up more than 60 percent of seafood bound for homes and restaurants.
Meanwhile, in 2014, U.S. President Barack Obama established an
interagency task force to combat IUU fishing, co-chaired by the
secretaries of commerce and state, with the participation of 14 federal
agencies. The task force not only survived the change in administration,
but it also released a comprehensive action plan in December 2017.
Meanwhile, China, perhaps recognizing the potential for international
pushback, has included language in its 13th Five-Year Plan that
indicates a willingness to consider fisheries reform. These measures
will help, but they're not enough. [Governments around the world must
take further steps to prevent a fish war. First and foremost, the
**U**nited **S**tates must reinforce its commitment to the international
rules-based order]{.underline} that has governed the maritime domain for
decades. It should do so by vigorously upholding rulings by the IMO,
agitating for increased transparency and accountability for states that
license merchant ships at the WTO, challenging excessive maritime claims
around the world, and finally ratifying UNCLOS. To follow through on
these commitments, the United States and its partners should also
strengthen their own coast guard forces, continue to build partner
capacity across the Indo-Pacific, and invest in science, data
collection, and information sharing. Doing all of the above wouldn't be
cheap. But the investment would be worth it. The U.S. fishing industry
is a powerful economic engine in need of defense, which generates \$208
billion in annual sales and employs 1.6 million people. And the costs
saved by avoiding a war over fish would be even higher. Unfortunately,
President Donald Trump's June executive order on ocean policy did not
seem to take such concerns into account when it reset U.S. priorities
away from conservation and focused on security on the high seas. One
cannot exist without the other. A crowded and hungry world means that
[battles over resources are a real possibility]{.underline}. [The
initial skirmishes will occur between relatively small ships within
eyeshot of each other. But however modest their beginnings, the world's
coming conflicts over fish have the potential to **escalate** into
protracted]{.underline}, resource-draining [disputes]{.underline}.

The success of the past seven years was driven home for me when I saw a
German public service announcement last month that added decarbonization
to the old Enlightenment trinity: "Demokratie, Vielfalt & Klimaschutz.
Du Bist Europa," it read: "Democracy, diversity, and climate protection.
You are Europe." What a victory. And what a complicated one. Since 2015,
the risks of climate war have not entirely decreased. Instead the
[**risks** have **shifted**]{.underline}. As [more countries have
**integrated** the energy **transition**]{.underline} into their
economies, a chance now exists that efforts to address climate change
could [**encourage** conflict]{.underline} in their own right.

This shift has not happened intentionally, to be clear. It's the result
of a process that climate advocates, to their credit, were among the
first to note: that [batteries]{.underline}, [renewables, and
zero-carbon energy]{.underline} are the next rung on the technological
ladder. Climate hawks have rightly celebrated the news of Ukrainians
using ebikes and electric drones for recon or to raid Russian tanks. But
that only drives home that these [**innovations** are "dual
use]{.underline}"---they can be [deployed in **civilian**]{.underline}
and in [**military** contexts]{.underline}, and thus are non-optional
for countries pursuing their security.

[**Conflict** over dual-use technologies]{.underline} is already at the
[**center** of U.S.-Chinese **trade spats**]{.underline}. Last month,
the Biden administration effectively [**banned** the sale
of]{.underline} any [modern semiconductor-**manufacturing**]{.underline}
equipment [to **China**.]{.underline} It also forbade "U.S. persons"---a
group that comprises American citizens and green-card holders---from
working in the Chinese semiconductor industry. As Eric Levitz writes in
New York magazine, the policy amounts to a type of economic war, because
"it is now official U.S. policy to [**prevent** China from
**achieving**]{.underline} its **[development]{.underline}** goals."

This is a dangerous logic when you consider that [**semiconductors** are
crucial for **decarbonization**]{.underline}: The shift to electricity
all but necessitates greater use of semiconductors. Computer chips
govern nearly every part of how [electric **cars**]{.underline},
scooters, [water **heaters**, induction **stoves**]{.underline}, and
more use energy or preserve it. One of the major ways that
electric-vehicle makers secure a competitive advantage is by [eking out
tiny improvements]{.underline} from the computer chips and software that
govern a car's battery pack. Now, the type of semiconductors affected by
Biden's policies is far more advanced than the cheaper kind needed for
decarbonization. But you can see how trying to [**prevent** the other
country's **development**]{.underline} can [**cascade** from an economic
**disagreement** into]{.underline} a [**military** one]{.underline}.

Part of what makes this dynamic tricky to manage is that the U.S. and
China are productively using climate policy as a venue for their own
diplomatic competition. Perhaps the most important international climate
announcement of the past few years was President Xi Jinping's pledge
that China would aim to reach net zero by 2060. He announced the goal
less than 2 months before the 2020 U.S. presidential election, and it
was widely understood as a "pointed message" for---if not a rebuke
of---the United States and the Trump administration. "It demonstrates
[**Xi's** consistent **interest**]{.underline} in [**leveraging** the
**climate** agenda]{.underline} for [**geopolitical**
purposes]{.underline}," Li Shuo, a Greenpeace analyst, told The New York
Times then.

Competition has improved American policy, too. Thanks to the Inflation
Reduction Act---a law that passed in part because American legislators
did not want to cede the clean-tech industry to China---the United
States is about to subsidize domestic solar-panel manufacturing at a
massive scale. It's possible that a decade from now we will have more
cheap solar panels than we know what to do with. And while that may
cause substantial economic deadweight loss, it's probably good, on net,
for the climate. If geopolitical competition leads America to subsidize
a solar industry, then competition is probably helping climate action,
not hindering it. Flooding the world with cheap solar power will not
only speed up decarbonization, but also push companies to find new and
creative ways to use solar panels.

The most likely trigger---possibly the [**only**
trigger]{.underline}---[of a **full-blown** war between **China**
and]{.underline} the [**United States** remains **Taiwan**]{.underline},
but we should be attentive to how [conflict over trade]{.underline},
even when it [**emerges** from **politicians'**]{.underline} virtuous
**[desire]{.underline}** to [have a domestic **clean**-tech]{.underline}
industry, can [**degrade** relations]{.underline} between countries and
[push them toward **zero-sum** thinking]{.underline}. And the greatest
risk from mitigation-fueled violence is not, we should be clear, to
citizens of America or China or Europe. Over the past month, the
**[Democratic Republic of Congo]{.underline}** has seen its
[**heaviest** rebel **fighting**]{.underline} in a decade as [**groups**
allegedly **backed** by **Rwanda**]{.underline} try to [lay claim to the
country's minerals]{.underline}, The Wall Street Journal recently
reported. Congo produces [**two-thirds** of the world's
**cobalt**]{.underline} and has the largest reserves of tantalum, a
metallic element used in capacitors.

At the same time, the old idea of a climate war has not vanished either.
The past year has shown how much climate impacts, such as drought, can
drive up the price of key commodities, fueling inflation in the rich
world and food shortages elsewhere. Conventional energy sources, such as
fossil fuels, are far more likely than renewables or climate technology
to trigger such a conflict, Dan Wang, a technology analyst at the
China-based economic-research firm Gavekal Dragonomics, told me. [China
**remains** dependent]{.underline} on oil and natural gas from abroad;
the U.S. has become a large and growing exporter of natural gas to the

**exports**]{.underline}---as it did with oil to Japan in the run-up to
World War II---then the [risks of a **bigger** conflict could be far
**graver**]{.underline}.

For years, climate advocates argued that their issue deserved to be at
the center of economic and social policy making. Climate is everything,
they said. Well, to a degree, they won: [**Decarbonization** is now at
the **center**]{.underline} of how the [U.S., China,]{.underline} and
Europe [conceive of the **future** of their **economies**]{.underline}.
Climate advocates have won a seat at the table where the life-and-death
matters of state and society are decided. What progress the world has
made; what a long way we still have to go.

#### Capitalist monoculture and pesticides decimates bees

[Bees are the most prolific and efficient of animal pollinators,
pollinating about 80 per cent of the Earth's plants. Not only do high
honeybee losses spell disaster for the **agricultural
crops**]{.underline} they work to pollinate -- like canola, apples, and
squash -- they also imply sickness and death in the 800-plus species of
wild, native bees across Canada. A loss of bees, especially those wild
bees whose populations are not managed by humans, will be catastrophic
for most ecosystems.

[It will require a sustained, grassroots movement that emphasizes
solidarity between the fractured groups that share some **critiques of
capitalist agriculture**.]{.underline}

The call has been heard across the globe, taken up by almost every big
environmental NGO, to "save the bees." Even large multinational food
corporations have joined the chorus. Beginning in 2016, Cheerios --
owned by General Mills, the American agrifood giant -- removed Buzz the
Bee from their packaging to draw attention to bee losses. On their
#BringBacktheBees campaign website, people could request free wildflower
seeds to plant in their backyards.

But what the Cheerios campaign and other corporate initiatives do not
acknowledge is that the loss of honeybee colonies and declining
populations of some native bee species are largely driven by the
capitalist agricultural system and the monocultures it creates -- a
system that these large agrifood corporations helped create and are
invested in maintaining.

[The truth is that we **cannot save the bees** without **ending
capitalist agriculture**.]{.underline} It will require a sustained,
grassroots movement that emphasizes solidarity between the fractured
groups that share some critiques of capitalist agriculture: farmers and
farm workers; livestock farmers and animal rights activists; and, in the
case of bees, beekeepers and native bee advocates.

Capitalist agriculture and landscapes of scarcity

Not every agricultural operation that exists within the global
capitalist system can be characterized as capitalist agriculture. There
are many forms of subsistence, smallholder agricultural operations that
are only partially -- and in some cases, involuntarily -- integrated
into the global capitalist system. I define [capitalist agriculture as
agriculture focused on accumulating wealth and capital by simplifying
and standardizing landscapes and the bodies of farmed animals.
Capitalist agriculture turns food into commodities that are part of a
global system of exchange. When it comes to bees, this looks like the
sale of close to 1.8 million tonnes of honey each year.]{.underline}
Honeybees have also become workers within the landscapes of capitalist
agriculture, pollinating millions of acres of monocultured crops.

[One of the most harmful aspects of capitalist agriculture is its
reliance on monocultures. In a monoculture landscape, one or two
dominant crops are grown over a large area, or one species of animal is
farmed, bred to grow bigger and faster.]{.underline} These landscapes
may seem abundant in one sense -- they conjure images of fields of corn
or soy, stretching as far as the eye can see -- but they are scarce in
terms of good sources of forage for bees and many other animals. [They
**also lack nesting locations and materials for wild, native bees**. And
honeybees, who are often put to work in monocultures of crops that need
animal pollination, may face **poor nutrition** in these homogenous
landscapes.]{.underline}

Richie Nimmo, a sociologist who studies human--non-human relationships,
describes the commercial beekeeping industry as the "apis-industrial
complex" to highlight how it is fully embedded in the global capitalist
agricultural system to the detriment of honeybees and many beekeepers.

Although migratory commercial beekeeping exists across the world, it is
perhaps most entrenched in the United States, where beekeepers cross the
country to pollinate almonds, blueberries, cranberries, and other
high-value crops. The almond industry in California is the most extreme
example of this, as 1.2 million acres of almond trees need
cross-pollination in the blooming season in February. [In 2020, over 88
per cent of all the honeybee colonies in the United States, amounting to
about 2.4 million colonies, were brought to the almond-growing regions
in California for about six weeks of pollination.]{.underline}

[Not only does this type of commercial beekeeping aid in the rapid
spread of pests and pathogens among honeybees, it further entrenches
capitalist agriculture.]{.underline} Richie Nimmo, a sociologist who
studies human--non-human relationships, describes the commercial
beekeeping industry as the "apis-industrial complex" to highlight how it
is fully embedded in the global capitalist agricultural system to the
detriment of honeybees and many beekeepers.

"Ontario is a terrifying model of monoculture," explains Luc Peters, the
owner of Humble Bee, a beekeeping operation in Hamilton, Ontario.
"There's even some beekeeping operations that operate as a monocultural
industrial farm. I think that's damaging to the honeybees themselves. If
you dump 2,000 beehive colonies in one spot that's going to be harmful
for the environment, much like \[exclusively\] growing corn on 100
acres."

Systemic pesticides and corporate beewashing

[A key way in which monocultures are created and maintained is through
the widespread use of pesticides,]{.underline} including insecticides,
herbicides, and fungicides. Although all pesticides may negatively
impact bees, one class of insecticides, neonicotinoid pesticides, is
particularly harmful to bees. Neonicotinoids are the most used class of
pesticides in the world, deployed on most non-organic commercial crops,
including corn, soy, and canola, some of the most prolific crops on
Earth. Although agrochemical corporations try to control and confuse the
discourse about the harms of systemic pesticides, there is a large and
growing body of evidence that indicates that these pesticides may cause
a variety of ill effects in bees. Occasionally, this may include
directly poisoning bees -- but [it also may include perhaps more
harmful, sub-lethal effects from repeated exposure, such as impeding
foraging and overwintering behaviours; decreasing queen bee health and
colony growth; and **stressing bees' immune systems**.]{.underline}

**[parasites]{.underline}** [that only reproduce in bee

of bees would mean]{.underline} **[the end of humanity]{.underline}**.
If bees didn't exist, humans wouldn't either. For many of us, bees are
annoying. We think that their only purpose is to keep buzzing around and
dropping their formic acid-laden stings on random people (this
impression will certainly change when we stop getting spoonfuls of sweet
[honey](https://www.scienceabc.com/nature/does-honey-go-bad-expire-spoil.html)in
our morning cereal). [The truth is]{.underline}, [bees are
**crucial**]{.underline} **[elements]{.underline}** [of our
environment]{.underline}, [and almost never get the credit that they
deserve. **If bees didn't exist, humans wouldn't either.** Out of the

and bats
([source](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2006/10/061025165904.htm)).
It's that simple. [Bees are the]{.underline} **[primary
initiators]{.underline}** [of reproduction among plants, as they
transfer pollen from the male stamens to the female pistils. Since
2006,]{.underline} [the population of bees has declined
considerably]{.underline}
([source](https://www.greenpeace.org/global/)). [Pesticides, disease,
parasites, and poor weather due to [global
warming](https://youtu.be/G9t__9Tmwv4) have played a major role in this
worrying decline]{.underline}. Are Bees Endangered? [Bee population has
been on a **decline** in recent years]{.underline}. Some species were
added to the endangered list in 2017 (seven species of Hawaiian
yellow-faced bees) and 2018 (The rusty-patched bumblebee, Bombus
affinis) so as to protect and revive their numbers. There have been a
number of reasons for this decline. Let's take a look at few of them.
Why Are Bees Endangered? [Bees are going extinct mainly because of two
reasons]{.underline}: **[pesticides and parasites]{.underline}**.
Pesticides Since the end of World War 2, [the use of pesticides in
agriculture has **increased exponentially**]{.underline}. [This intense
use of **pesticides**]{.underline}, known as neonicotinoids (a
relatively new class of insecticides that affect the central nervous
system of insects, resulting in paralysis and death), [has had a
**major** role in the bees']{.underline} **[decline]{.underline}**
([source](http://web.archive.org/web/20200811075230/https:/ento.psu.edu/publications/are-neonicotinoids-killing-bees)).
When bees are exposed to neonicotinoids, they go into a shock and forget
their way home (sort of like the insect version of Alzheimer's).
Parasites [Along with pesticides]{.underline}, [parasites]{.underline}
known as Varrao mites (also called Varrao destructors) [are also
responsible for their death]{.underline}
([source](http://web.archive.org/web/20200130031936/https:/entomology.ca.uky.edu/ef608)).
The Varrao can only reproduce in a bee colony. They are blood-sucking
parasites that affect adult and young bees equally. The disease
inflicted by these mites can result in bees losing legs or wings,
essentially killing them. Also Read: [What Happens To Bees When They Get
Lost?](https://www.scienceabc.com/nature/animals/what-happens-to-bees-when-they-get-lost.html)
Colony Collapse Disorder Beekeepers started reporting a sudden reduction
in the number of bees. The adult bees disappeared suddenly and mostly
together. The hives were left with just the queen and immature bees.
Even the food was present in high quantities. In some cases, few adult
bees were found attending to the queen. Reasons mentioned above are two
of the many factors that play a role in this disorder. Effects Of Bee
Extinction **[Extinction of bees]{.underline}** [will affect
**plants**]{.underline}, **[animals]{.underline}**, **[availability of
fuels]{.underline}**, **[topography]{.underline}**,
**[clothing]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} of course, **[human
life.]{.underline}** Effects on plants Some plants are pollinated by
wind, but that rate is very slow. Insects are the primary pollinators on
the planet. Beetles and butterflies also pollinate, but bees are the
most efficient insects for this purpose. Without bees, we wouldn't be
able to savor delicious apples, cherries, and many other fruits and
veggies (blueberries, avocado, broccoli, most leafy greens, cucumbers,
pumpkins, and many more). Almond trees would be among the first
casualties. If bees went extinct, there would be a massive decline in
the production of crops. Although crops like rice and wheat don't
require insect pollination, can people survive by eating rice and bread
all their life? Effects on animals Herbivores, who depend on certain
plant species, will be affected first. They would go extinct if plants
ceased to exist. For example, many cattle used for milk and meat depend
on alfalfa and lupins, both of which depend on insect pollination. If
the cow's food supply declines, then meat and milk production will
decrease. This will seriously affect the human diet. Due to the
declining population of herbivores, tertiary carnivores will begin to
suffer immediately. The only beneficiaries from this scenario would be
scavengers (eagles, vultures, ravens etc.) Fuel Canola, which is grown
to use as both a fuel and cooking oil, depends highly on pollination. It
is also used to produce biofuel. If we were to run out of biofuel, we'd
have to rely on fossil fuels completely, thus putting further pressure
on the environment. Clothing Cotton is very reliant on pollination. The
disappearance of bees will lead to a huge setback in cotton production,
as it will significantly reduce our choices in clothes (good luck
enduring the humidity of the tropical regions while wearing nylon
attire). Topograhy [Since most plants would be unable to]{.underline}
[grow]{.underline}, [grasslands would]{.underline} [become **barren and
large-scale**]{.underline} **[desertification]{.underline}** [will take
place]{.underline}. [**Landslides** would wipe out villages in **one
sweep**]{.underline}. Ultimately, **[Earth will become one large
plastic-laden desert.]{.underline}** Effects Of Bee Extinction On Human
Life [Less production of food crops will ultimately lead to worldwide
famine]{.underline}. **[Hunger and poverty]{.underline}** [will be very
common]{.underline}. **[Freshwater]{.underline}** [will start drying up
as well as, as there will be less trees for water retention to
occur]{.underline}. [With less water and diminishing food, **humans will
die**]{.underline} [of thirst and starvation. **Fertility** would also
**suffer a setback**]{.underline}, [followed by a **drop** in the rate
of reproduction]{.underline}. Ultimately, [we wouldn't be able to
sustain and would be forced into **extinction**]{.underline} within a
few hundred years. Unless scientists build robotic bees to do the jobs
that honeybees once did, **[we're ultimately doomed]{.underline}**. And
although this isn't the most serious repercussion, we would never again
taste that sweet, savory honey that we forcibly steal from honeybees
every day. [The tragic irony of this is that by killing
bees,]{.underline} **[we're only hurting ourselves]{.underline}**. Our
survival depends on the health of the planet and its species, and unless
we begin to face this fact, we will continue to contribute to our own
demise. [Unless we take drastic measures to save the bees]{.underline},
**[the planet's survival is in doubt]{.underline}**.

### ! -- AI/Inequality

#### Capitalism drives inequality and AI superweapons 

**Robinson \'23** \[Nathan J.; ounder and editor-in-chief of Current
Affairs magazine. He also holds a PhD in Sociology from Harvard
University.; 3-24-2023; \"The Problem With AI Is the Problem With
Capitalism\"; No Publication;
https://jacobin.com/2023/03/ai-artificial-intelligence-art-chatgpt-jobs-capitalism;
Accessed 7-11-2025; AY\]

[The problem]{.underline} is that new generative [AI is being introduced
into a capitalist society that is ill-equipped to handle
it.]{.underline}

Artists, for example, are mostly not afraid of AI because they fear
having a machine be better at art. Chess players didn't stop playing
chess when the computer program Deep Blue beat grandmaster Garry
Kasparov. And if art is made for pleasure and self-expression, it
doesn't matter what anyone else can do.

The problem is that, in our world, artists have to make a living through
their art by selling it, and so they have to think about its market
value. We're introducing a [technology that can utterly **wreck people's
livelihoods**, and in a free-market economic system, if your skills
decline in value, you're screwed.]{.underline}

It's interesting that we talk about [jobs being "at risk" of being
automated. Under a socialist economic system, automating many jobs would
be a good thing: another step down the road to a world in which robots
do the hard work and everyone enjoys abundance.]{.underline} We should
be able to be excited if legal documents can be written by a computer.
Who wants to spend all day writing legal documents? But [we can't be
excited about it, because we live under capitalism]{.underline}, and we
know that if paralegal work is automated, that's over three hundred
thousand [people who face the prospect of trying to find work knowing
their years of experience and training are **economically
useless**.]{.underline}

Luddism is a rational approach to automation in a capitalist society. If
machines threaten your job, fight the machines. Even a reactionary like
Tucker Carlson has said that politicians should intervene to stop
automation, for example, by banning self-driving trucks, because having
millions of people thrown out of work would cause too much social
disruption. But that solution is absurd: Why would we have people do
needless labor that could be done by robots? Truck drivers have their
health destroyed and don't get to see their families for long stretches
of time. Even when a machine could do the hard work instead, we're going
to make people do it?

We can expand our imagination far further than Carlson's. What if
finding out that your job could be automated was a thrill? What if it
meant that a worker could be paid while the robot did the work? How
about this: once the job that you train for is automated, you get an
automation pension and get to relax for the rest of your life. Everyone
will be praying their job is next on the list to go.

We shouldn't have to fear AI. Frankly, I'd love it if a machine could
edit magazine articles for me and I could sit on the beach. But I'm
afraid of it, because I make a living editing magazine articles and need
to keep a roof over my head. If someone could make and sell an equally
good rival magazine for close to free, I wouldn't be able to support
myself through what I do. [The same is true of everyone who works for a
living in the present economic system. They have to be terrified by
automation, because the value of labor matters a lot, and huge
fluctuations in its value put all of one's hopes and **dreams in
peril**.]{.underline}

[Most of the other problems AI could cause really boil down to problems
of the way power and wealth are apportioned in our existing society.
Because the world is organized into militarized nation-states, we have
to worry that AI technology will be used in **terrifying new
superweapons**]{.underline}. Because we let scams and fraud flourish in
our Wild West economy, we will see a lot of [people get rich using AI to
prey on hapless consumers. The profit motive is already **socially
destructive**, but AI will make it much worse, because it will allow
companies to figure out how to more efficiently trick and exploit
people.]{.underline} The new technologies are being developed by private
corporations that have no incentive to ensure that a benefit to them is
a benefit to all.

We need to be clear on the [source of the problems with AI. They are
real and will accelerate the crisis that socialists are devoted to
helping humanity solve. But the **problem is not technology
itself.**]{.underline} Technology should be a tool for liberation.
[Unless we transform the economic system, however, it will be a tool for
ever **greater exploitation** and predation.]{.underline}

#### **Inequality causes [societal collapse]{.underline} through civil uprisings - models show the [brink is now.]{.underline}**

**Turchin '23** \[Peter; Complexity Scientist, Ph.D. in Zoology from
Duke University, B.A. in Biology from New York University; Penguin
Press, "End Times: Elites, Counter-Elites, and the Path of Political
Disintegration," p. 176-182\]

Thus, the heart of the MPF model is the relative wage and the wealth
pump that it powers. [When the **relative wage** declines, it leads to
both **immiseration** and elite overproduction]{.underline}. Both, as we
now know, are [the most important drivers of **social** and **political
instability**]{.underline}. However, [outbreaks of
instability]{.underline}---violent [anti-government demonstrations and
strikes, urban riots, **terrorism**, rural uprisings, and]{.underline},
if things really go to hell, state collapse and full-blown **[civil
war]{.underline}**---are the results of individual people's actions. How
does the model [connect]{.underline} the [structural drivers to people's
**motivations**]{.underline}? It assumes that the key role in all such
events is played by extremists, those who have been radicalized and
primed for aggression. When such radicals are few in relation to the
rest of the population, they offer no serious threat to the stability of
the regime, because they are easily isolated and suppressed by the
police. But if they are many, they start coalescing into extremist
organizations, which can credibly challenge the ruling class. The number
of radicals in proportion to the total population, therefore, is a key
variable that the MPF model needs to track.

The [process of **radicalization** works like a **disease** that, as it
**spreads**, changes people's **behaviors** and makes them act in
**violent ways**]{.underline}. The compartment of the MPF engine
connecting structural drivers to unrest thus needs to model this dynamic
of social contagion. It is quite similar to equations used by
epidemiologists---for example, in forecasting the dynamics of COVID
outbreaks.

The model keeps track of three kinds of individuals. The first is the
"naive" type, corresponding to the susceptibles in the epidemiological
framework. This is the class into which individuals are placed when they
become adults. (The model tracks only individuals who are active adults;
children and the retired elderly are not modeled, as they are assumed to
have no effect on the dynamics.) Naive individuals can become
"radicalized" by being exposed to individuals of the radical type
(corresponding to infectious individuals in a disease model). The more
radicals there are in the population, the higher the chance that a naive
individual will catch the "virus of radicalism."\[3\]

[When a high proportion of the population is **radicalized**,
sociopolitical **instability** is also **high**. Riots are **easily
triggered** and **readily spread**]{.underline}; [terrorist and
revolutionary groups **thrive** and **receive support** from massive
numbers of sympathizers]{.underline}; and the society is highly
vulnerable to an outbreak of civil war. However, [the relationship
between the degree of radicalization and the overall level of
**political violence**]{.underline} (measured, for example, by the
number of people killed) [is **nonlinear**]{.underline}. As the
proportion of radicals in the population grows, it [becomes]{.underline}
**[increasingly]{.underline}** [easy]{.underline} for them [to link up
and]{.underline} **[organize]{.underline}**, potentially [leading
to]{.underline} an **[explosive growth]{.underline}** [of revolutionary
parties]{.underline}. There is also a threshold effect. [As long
as]{.underline} the [power]{.underline} of revolutionary groups
[is]{.underline} **[less]{.underline}** [than the]{.underline} power of
the **[state]{.underline}**'s coercive apparatus, the overall level of
[violence]{.underline} can be suppressed to a **[low]{.underline}**
[level]{.underline}. But [should]{.underline} the [balance]{.underline}
**[shift]{.underline}** [in favor of radicals]{.underline}, the
[forces]{.underline} of the **[regime]{.underline}** [can]{.underline}
**[suddenly implode]{.underline}**, as we saw in numerous examples of
**[state collapse]{.underline}** in the previous chapter.

So far we've been speaking of "radicals" as though they are an interest
group. But that's not the right way to think about it. In reality,
radicals usually don't all belong to a single radical party. During
periods of high political instability, there are many issues dividing
the population and the elites. (We discussed this fragmentation of the
ideological landscape in chapter 4.) [Thus, there are many **factions**
of radicals]{.underline}, each motivated by a different ideology and
warring with other factions. [Some become **left-wing** extremists, and
others join **right-wing** organizations; still others become ethnic or
religious]{.underline} extremists. And even within the right, as well as
within the left, radical groups are splintered and may be more focused
on internecine fighting than on fighting the opposite end of the
ideological spectrum.

Generally speaking, an outbreak of political violence is dynamically
similar to a wildfire or an earthquake. A [**single spark** can start a
prairie fire]{.underline}, as Mao famously said. But most sparks start
little fires that go out before they manage to spread into
conflagrations. Others grow to mid-size blazes. Only very few sparks
start wildfires that sweep through all of the prairie. Complexity
scientists have devoted a lot of attention to such processes in which
the statistical distribution of the event size obeys a "power law."
Whether we quantify these processes in square kilometers of prairie
burned down or the strength of an earthquake on the Richter scale---or
the severity of political violence events as measured in the number of
people killed---they all have the same type of dynamics. \[4\] In a
prairie fire, [whether the initial fire caused by a spark spreads
depends on how much **combustible** material is in reach, and whether
fire can jump from one patch of dried grass to another. In a
**revolution**, whether the initial revolt against the regime spreads
depends on the number of radicals]{.underline} (analogous to combustible
material) [and how well they are **connected**]{.underline}, or how fast
they can expand their networks of rebellion. As a result of such
autocatalytic, self-driving dynamics, an initially small event can
unexpectedly blow up into a rare, large-scale disaster---a "black swan"
or a "dragon king."

[Because the **relationship** between the **radicalization quotient**
and the resulting scale of political violence is governed by a **power**
law, normal **stat**istic**s**]{.underline} (e.g., the average level of
violence) [don't work]{.underline} very well, and the MPF model captures
possible outcomes by assessing the probability of really severe events,
such as the American Civil War or the Taiping Rebellion. Such extreme
events may not be highly probable, but we need to worry about them,
simply because they have the potential to cause unimaginable human
misery. Is a 10 percent probability of a second American civil war high
or low? Put it in personal terms: Would you take a bet that could cause
your personal extinction with a probability of 10 percent? I would not,
even if offered a huge reward. You need to be alive to enjoy the prize,
no matter what size it is.

Let's get back to the MPF model. An additional element in the model is
that a naive individual can become radicalized not only through contacts
with other radicals but also through exposure to violence resulting from
radical actions. For example, someone whose relative or friend was
killed in a terrorist act perpetrated by right-wing extremists might
join a left-wing revolutionary group. This second route to
radicalization is also a kind of social contagion (but mediated by
violence instead of radical ideology).

The third type of individual in the model, in addition to naïfs and
radicals, is the "moderate" (corresponding to "recovered" in
epidemiological models). This group comprises former radicals who have
become disenchanted with radicalism and violence and have concluded that
members of the society need to pull together and overcome their
differences. The moderates differ from the naïfs in that they value
peace and order above all, and they work actively to bring it about. In
other words, naive individuals don't have an active political program,
radicals work actively to increase instability, and moderates work
actively to dampen things down.

In summary, new radicals are created when naïfs encounter the already
radicalized ones or are exposed to violence. The more radicals there are
(and therefore the higher the rate of violence), the more likely that a
naive individual becomes radicalized. However, moderates also have a
role: "infection" by radicalism declines as moderates increase in number
and exert their moderating, instability-suppressing influence.

The numbers of radicals, however, don't grow without limit. As the level
of violence increases, some radicals turn away from extremism and
convert into moderates. The probability of a radical becoming disgusted
with radicalism and turning into a moderate increases with the overall
level of violence, but with a time delay, as high levels of political
violence do not instantly translate into a social mood of revulsion
against violence and a desire for internal peace. Violence acts in a
cumulative fashion; several years of high instability, or even outright
civil war, have to pass before the majority of the population begins to
earnestly yearn for order.

The social contagion module of the MPF engine thus keeps track of the
radicalization and moderation processes. Now it needs to connect to the
dynamics of structural drivers of instability. This is done through the
Political Stress Index (PSI), which combines the strength of
immiseration and elite overproduction. \[5\] Popular immiseration is
measured by inverse relative income (median family income divided by GDP
per capita). Thus, when typical incomes fail to increase with economic
growth, this factor causes the PSI to increase. Intraelite
overproduction/competition is measured by the number of elites
(including elite aspirants) in relation to the total population. The PSI
"tunes" the probability that a naive individual becomes radicalized.
When structural conditions result in high social pressures for
instability, radical ideas fall on fertile soil and readily take root.
Alternatively, if the PSI is low, an encounter between a naïf and a
radical (or a naïf experiencing a political violence event) is unlikely
to result in radicalization.

Now that we have the MPF engine, let's use it to investigate the
possible trajectories that the American social system could take beyond
the 2020s. Keep in mind that this is a model (even a prototype) and its
predictions should be taken with some degree of skepticism. The goal is
not to predict the future but to use the model to understand how
possible actions may shape different futures. The MPF engine is a kind
of "morality tale," like the story of a kind girl and an unkind girl, a
narrative motif that is present in hundreds of traditional societies.

We [start the engine in 1960 and first run it for the sixty years for
which the history is fixed]{.underline}. From the MPF point of view,
[the most **important** trend during this time is the decline in the
relative wage]{.underline}. The [decline in the relative wage turns on
the wealth pump, and elite numbers begin to increase in an accelerating
manner]{.underline}. By 2020, [both immiseration and elite
overproduction, and thus the PSI, reach very **high
levels**]{.underline}. The **[radicalization curve]{.underline}**,
tracking the number of radicals, which had been staying flat near zero,
[starts to grow after 2010 and **literally explodes** during the
**2020s**]{.underline}. So does [political violence]{.underline}. At
some point during the 2020s, the model predicts, [instability becomes so
high that it starts cutting down the elite numbers]{.underline}.
Remember that MPF is a model, which means that it abstracts reality into
mathematical equations. But in real life, [instability causing declines
in elite numbers is not abstract at all]{.underline}. Think about what
happened in America as a result of the Civil War, when huge numbers of
Southern elite men were killed on the battlefield and the rest were
deprived of their elite status.

In the model, [the cataclysm of the 2020s reduces elite numbers, which
results in a decline in the PSI]{.underline}. Additionally, high levels
of violence accelerate the transition of most radicals into moderates.
[The radicalization curve falls as precipitously as it rose and at some
point after 2030 hits the minimum]{.underline}. Because radicals are the
ones who drive violence, instability also declines. The social system
regains its stability. But in this inertial scenario, the root cause of
instability---the wealth pump---continues to operate. Gradually, elite
numbers begin increasing. Meanwhile, the moderates who suppressed the
2020s peak of violence are slowly retiring and dying off. The uneasy
peace holds for the next generation (twenty-five to thirty years), but
then there is a repeat of the 2020s fifty years later. \[6\]

[The inertial scenario thus predicts a rather grim future: an outbreak
of **serious violence** during the 2020s and, if nothing is done to shut
down the pump, a repeat every fifty to sixty years]{.underline}. What
are the alternatives?

The [immense potential of AIs has created competitive pressures among
global players contending for power and influence. This "AI race" is
driven by nations and corporations who feel they must rapidly build and
deploy AIs to secure their positions and survive]{.underline}. By
**[failing to properly prioritize global risks, this dynamic makes it
more likely that AI development will produce dangerous
outcomes]{.underline}**. [Analogous to the nuclear arms
race]{.underline} during the Cold War, participation in an AI race may
serve individual short-term interests, but [it ultimately results in
worse collective outcomes for humanity. Importantly, these risks stem
not only from the intrinsic nature of AI technology, but from the
competitive pressures that encourage insidious choices in AI
development]{.underline}.

In this section, we first explore the military AI arms race and the
corporate AI race, where nation-states and corporations are forced to
rapidly develop and adopt AI systems to remain competitive. Moving
beyond these specific races, we reconceptualize competitive pressures as
part of a broader evolutionary process in which AIs could become
increasingly pervasive, powerful, and entrenched in society. Finally, we
highlight potential strategies and policy suggestions to mitigate the
risks created by an AI race and ensure the safe development of AIs.

3.1 Military AI Arms Race

The [development of AIs for military applications is swiftly paving the
way for a new era in military technology, with potential consequences
rivaling those of gunpowder and nuclear arms in what has been described
as the "third revolution in warfare."]{.underline} The [weaponization of
AI presents numerous challenges, such as the potential for more
destructive wars, the possibility of accidental usage or loss of
control, and the prospect of malicious actors co-opting these
technologies for their own purposes]{.underline}. As AIs gain influence
over traditional military weaponry and increasingly take on command and
control functions, humanity faces a paradigm shift in warfare. In this
context, we will discuss the latent risks and implications of this AI
arms race on global security, the potential for intensified conflicts,
and the dire outcomes that could come as a result, including the
possibility of conflicts escalating to a scale that poses an existential
threat.

3.1.1 **[Lethal Autonomous Weapons (LAWs)]{.underline}**

LAWs are weapons that can identify, target, and kill without human
intervention \[34\]. They offer potential improvements in decision-
making speed and precision. Warfare, however, is a high-stakes,
safety-critical domain for AIs with significant moral and practical
concerns. Though their existence is not necessarily a catastrophe in
itself, [LAWs may serve as an on-ramp to catastrophes stemming from
malicious use, accidents, loss of control, or an increased likelihood of
war.]{.underline}

LAWs may become vastly superior to humans. Driven by rapid developments
in AIs, weapons systems that can identify, target, and decide to kill
human beings on their own---without an officer directing an attack or a
soldier pulling the trigger---are starting to transform the future of
conflict. [In 2020, an advanced AI agent outperformed experienced F-16
pilots in a series of virtual dogfights, including decisively defeating
a human pilot 5-0, showcasing "aggressive and precise maneuvers the
human pilot couldn't outmatch"]{.underline} \[35\]. Just as in the past,
[superior weapons would allow for more destruction in a shorter period
of time, **increasing the severity of war**.]{.underline}

[Militaries are taking steps toward delegating life-or-death decisions
to AIs. Fully autonomous drones were likely first used on the
battlefield in Libya in March 2020]{.underline}, when retreating forces
were "hunted down and remotely engaged" by a drone operating without
human oversight \[36\]. In May 2021, the [Israel Defense Forces used the
world's first AI-guided weaponized drone swarm during combat operations,
which marks a significant milestone in the integration of AI and drone
technology in warfare]{.underline} \[37\]. Although walking, shooting
robots have yet to replace soldiers on the battlefield, technologies are
converging in ways that may make this possible in the near future.

**[LAWs increase the likelihood of war.]{.underline}** Sending troops
into battle is a grave decision that leaders do not make lightly. But
[autonomous weapons would allow an aggressive nation to launch attacks
without endangering the lives of its own soldiers and thus face less
domestic scrutiny]{.underline}. While remote-controlled weapons share
this advantage, [their scalability is limited by the requirement for
human operators and vulnerability to jamming countermeasures,
limitations that LAWs could overcome]{.underline} \[38\]. Public opinion
for continuing wars tends to wane as conflicts drag on and casualties
increase \[39\]. LAWs would change this equation. [National leaders
would no longer face the prospect of body bags returning home, thus
removing a primary barrier to engaging in warfare, which could
ultimately increase the likelihood of conflicts.]{.underline}

3.1.2 **[Cyberwarfare]{.underline}**

As well as being used to enable deadlier weapons, [AIs could lower the
barrier to entry for cyberattacks, making them more numerous and
destructive]{.underline}. They could cause serious harm not only in the
digital environment but also in physical systems, potentially taking out
critical infrastructure that societies depend on. While AIs could also
be used to improve cyberdefense, it is unclear whether they will be most
effective as an offensive or defensive technology \[40\]. If they
enhance attacks more than they support defense, then cyberattacks could
become more common, creating significant geopolitical turbulence and
paving another route to large-scale conflict.

[AIs have the potential to increase the accessibility, success rate,
scale, speed, stealth, and potency of cyberattacks.]{.underline}
Cyberattacks are already a reality, but [AIs could be used to increase
their frequency and destructiveness in multiple ways.]{.underline}
Machine learning tools could be used to find more critical
vulnerabilities in target systems and improve the success rate of
attacks. They could also be used to increase the scale of attacks by
running millions of systems in parallel, and increase the speed by
finding novel routes to infiltrating a system. Cyberattacks could also
become more potent if used to hijack AI weapons.

[Cyberattacks can destroy critical infrastructure]{.underline}. By
hacking computer systems that control physical processes, cyberattacks
could cause extensive infrastructure damage. For example, they could
cause system components to overheat or valves to lock, leading to a
buildup of pressure culminating in an explosion. Through interferences
like this, [cyberattacks have the potential to destroy critical
infrastructure, such as electric grids and water supply
systems]{.underline}. This was demonstrated in 2015, when a cyberwarfare
unit of the Russian military hacked into the Ukrainian power grid,
leaving over 200,000 people without power access for several hours.
AI-enhanced attacks could be even more devastating and potentially
deadly for the billions of people who rely on critical infrastructure
for survival.

[Difficulties in attributing AI-driven cyberattacks could increase the
risk of war]{.underline}. A cyberattack resulting in physical damage to
critical infrastructure would require a high degree of skill and effort
to execute, perhaps only within the capability of nation-states. [Such
attacks are rare as they constitute an act of war, and thus elicit a
full military response. Yet AIs could enable attackers to hide their
identity]{.underline}, for example if they are used to evade detection
systems or more effectively cover the tracks of the attacker \[41\]. [If
cyberattacks become more stealthy, this would reduce the threat of
retaliation from an attacked party, potentially making attacks more
likely. If stealthy attacks do happen, they might incite actors to
mistakenly retaliate against unrelated third parties they suspect to be
responsible]{.underline}. [This could increase the scope of the conflict
dramatically]{.underline}.

3.1.3 **[Automated Warfare]{.underline}**

AIs speed up the pace of war, which makes AIs more necessary. AIs can
quickly process a large amount of data, analyze complex situations, and
provide helpful insights to commanders. With ubiquitous sensors and
advanced technology on the battlefield, there is tremendous incoming
information. AIs help make sense of this information, spotting important
patterns and relationships that humans might miss. [As these trends
continue, it will become increasingly difficult for humans to make
well-informed decisions as quickly as necessary to keep pace with AIs.
This would further pressure militaries to hand over decisive control to
AIs.]{.underline} The continuous integration of AIs into all aspects of
warfare will cause the pace of combat to become faster and faster.
Eventually, we may arrive at a point where humans are no longer capable
of assessing the ever-changing battlefield situation and must cede
decision-making power to advanced AIs.

[Automatic retaliation can escalate accidents into war. There is already
willingness to let computer systems retaliate
automatically.]{.underline} In 2014, a leak revealed to the public that
the NSA was developing a system called MonsterMind, which would
autonomously detect and block cyberattacks on US infrastructure \[42\].
It was suggested that in the future, MonsterMind could automatically
initiate a retaliatory cyberattack with no human involvement. If
multiple combatants have policies of automatic retaliation, an accident
or false alarm could quickly escalate to full-scale war before humans
intervene. This would be especially dangerous if the superior
information processing capabilities of modern AI systems makes it more
appealing for actors to automate decisions regarding nuclear launches.

**[History shows the danger of automated retaliation]{.underline}**.

On September 26, 1983, Stanislav Petrov, a lieutenant colonel of the
Soviet Air Defense Forces, was on duty at the Serpukhov-15 bunker near
Moscow, monitoring the Soviet Union's early warning system for incoming
bal- listic missiles. The system indicated that the US had launched
multiple nuclear missiles toward the Soviet Union. The protocol at the
time dictated that such an event should be considered a legitimate
attack, and the Soviet Union would respond with a nuclear counterstrike.
If Petrov had passed on the warning to his superiors, this would have
been the likely outcome. Instead, however, he judged it to be a false
alarm and ignored it. It was soon confirmed that the warning had been
caused by a rare technical malfunction. If an AI had been in control,
the false alarm could have triggered a nuclear war.

[AI-controlled weapons systems could lead to a flash war. Autonomous
systems are not infallible.]{.underline} We have already witnessed how
quickly an error in an automated system can escalate in the economy.
Most notably, in the 2010 Flash Crash, a feedback loop between automated
trading algorithms amplified ordinary market fluctuations into a
financial catastrophe in which a trillion dollars of stock value
vanished in minutes \[43\]. If multiple nations were to use AIs to
automate their defense systems, an error could be catastrophic,
[triggering a spiral of attacks and counter-attacks that would happen
too quickly for humans to step in---a flash war.]{.underline} The market
quickly recovered from the 2010 Flash Crash, but [the harm caused by a
flash war could be catastrophic]{.underline}.

[Automated warfare could reduce accountability for military
leaders.]{.underline} Military leaders may at times gain an advantage on
the battlefield if they are willing to ignore the laws of war. For
example, soldiers may be able to mount stronger attacks if they do not
take steps to minimize civilian casualties. An important deterrent to
this behavior is the risk that military leaders could eventually be held
accountable or even prosecuted for war crimes. Automated warfare could
reduce this deterrence effect by making it easier for military leaders
to escape accountability by blaming violations on failures in their
automated systems.

[AIs could make war more uncertain, increasing the risk of
conflict.]{.underline} Although states that are already wealthier and
more powerful often have more resources to invest in new military
technologies, they are not necessarily always the most successful at
adopting them. Other factors also play an important role, such as how
agile and adaptive a military can be in incorporating new technologies
\[44\]. Major new weapons innovations can therefore offer an opportunity
for existing superpowers to bolster their dominance, but also for less
powerful states to quickly increase their power by getting ahead in an
emerging and important sphere. This can create significant uncertainty
around if and how the balance of power is shifting, potentially leading
states to incorrectly believe they could gain something from going to
war. Even aside from considerations regarding the balance of power,
[rapidly evolving automated warfare would be unprecedented, making it
difficult for actors to evaluate their chances of victory in any
particular conflict. This would increase the risk of miscalculation,
making war more likely.]{.underline}

3.1.4 **[Actors May Risk Extinction Over Individual
Defeat]{.underline}**

[Competitive pressures make actors more willing to accept the risk of
extinction]{.underline}. During the Cold War, neither side desired the
dangerous situation they found themselves in. There were widespread
fears that nuclear weapons could be powerful enough to wipe out a large
fraction of humanity, potentially even causing extinction---a
catastrophic result for both sides. Yet the intense rivalry and
geopolitical tensions between the two superpowers fueled a dangerous
cycle of arms buildup. Each side perceived the other's nuclear arsenal
as a threat to its very survival, leading to a desire for parity and
deterrence. The [competitive pressures pushed both countries to
continually develop and deploy more advanced and destructive nuclear
weapons systems]{.underline}, driven by the fear of being at a strategic
disadvantage. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, this led to the brink of
nuclear war. Even though the story of Arkhipov preventing the launch of
a nuclear torpedo wasn't declassified until decades after the incident,
President John F. Kennedy reportedly estimated that he thought the odds
of nuclear war beginning during that time were "somewhere between one
out of three and even." This chilling admission highlights how the
competitive pressures between militaries have the potential to cause
global catastrophes.

[Individually rational decisions can be collectively catastrophic.
Nations locked in competition might make decisions that advance their
own interests by putting the rest of the world at stake.]{.underline}
Scenarios of this kind are collective action problems, where decisions
may be rational on an individual level yet disastrous for the larger
group \[45\]. For example, corporations and individuals may weigh their
own profits and convenience over the negative impacts of the emissions
they create, even if those emissions collectively result in climate
change. The same principle can be extended to military strategy and
defense systems. [Military leaders might estimate, for instance, that
increasing the autonomy of weapon systems would mean a 10 percent chance
of losing control over weaponized superhuman AIs. Alternatively, they
might estimate that using AIs to automate bioweapons research could lead
to a 10 percent chance of leaking a deadly pathogen]{.underline}.
**[Both of these scenarios could lead to]{.underline}** catastrophe or
even **[extinction.]{.underline}** The leaders may, however, also
calculate that refraining from these developments will mean a 99 percent
chance of losing a war against an opponent. [Since conflicts are often
viewed as existential struggles by those fighting them, rational actors
may accept an otherwise unthinkable 10 percent chance of human
extinction over a 99 percent chance of losing a war.]{.underline}
Regardless of the particular nature of the risks posed by advanced AIs,
[these dynamics could push us to the brink of global
catastrophe.]{.underline}

Torture and Suffering,"

Introduction

The artificial intelligence debate has become increasingly heated over
the past decade as [**breakthroughs** in **AI**]{.underline}
technologies [dramatically **redefine** what]{.underline} man and
[machine are capable of]{.underline}. On the verge of [more
**autonomous** and **sophisticated** AI systems]{.underline}, concerns
of an ethical nature are rapidly moving to center stage in the debate.
Of these many concerns, one stands out for its chilling implication:
that an advanced [AI might]{.underline}--[**intentionally** or
**unintentionally**--condemn humans to **eternal**]{.underline} torture
and [suffering, a fate]{.underline} arguably [**worse** than
**death**]{.underline}. The likelihood of such an event might be very
slim, but it is [so **cataclysmic** in consequences]{.underline} that it
certainly deserves to be taken seriously. In this paper, I will argue
that with the risks in mind, we should be most careful--or rather,
completely avoid--creating AI with a view toward avoiding possibilities
that could lead to these dreadful outcomes.

The Nature of AI and Ethnical Concerns

Artificial intelligence is fundamentally based on dealing with data,
recognizing patterns, and making decisions by using algorithms. [The
smarter the **AI**, the more **autonomous** and **capable** it
becomes]{.underline}. However, immense ethical concerns come with such
capability. Perhaps one of the most important is that it [could create
**goals**]{.underline} and behaviors that are [no longer in line with
human]{.underline} values and [interests]{.underline}. This
**[misalignment]{.underline}** would [have unintended
implications]{.underline}, some of them devastating.

Concerns about the potential damage that could be done by artificial
intelligence are not entirely unjustified. Already, AI systems have
demonstrated biased behaviors and made unacceptable decisions. These
issues in themselves could be somewhat limited when considering narrow
AI--those designed for specific tasks only. Once general AI arrives,
machines that can execute any intellectual job a human can, the risks
will go up considerably. The fear here is that such an AI might behave
in ways that could cause suffering on unimaginable scales if its values
fail to align with those of humans.

The Concept of Eternal Torture and Suffering by AI

Among the most disturbing scenarios regarding AI ethics has to do with
the mere possibility that an advanced AI might eternally torture human
beings. [Once achieving]{.underline} a **[higher]{.underline}** level of
[autonomy and **capability**]{.underline}, the [actions of AI can be
beyond human control, leading to **consequences**]{.underline} that [we
**cannot foresee**]{.underline} or mitigate.

The notion of eternal torture and suffering raises a really troubling
scenario where [**suffering** is not only enormous, but **endless**.
No]{.underline} kind of [suffering in]{.underline} human [**history**
has been eternal]{.underline}. Every atrocity comes to an end. With
**[AI]{.underline}**, however, there is the [risk]{.underline} that
[suffering]{.underline} might be prolonged
**[indefinitely]{.underline}** due to the fact that a [machine could go
on without]{.underline} any [limitations]{.underline} of biological life
and human mortality.

The Ethical Imperative to Avoid Catastrophic Risks

Given the possible disastrous consequences, we really need to consider
whether it is actually ethical to create artificial intelligence at all.
It can be said that if there is any nonzero possibility that advanced AI
creation leads to eternal suffering, then we should avoid its creation.
Here [the **downside** is so **great**]{.underline} that [it
outweighs]{.underline} any potential [benefits]{.underline}. While AI
might bring immensely beneficial changes--curing diseases, solving
global challenges, improving the quality of life--it is a risk that may
prove to be too large to justify its creation.

The Precautionary Principle

Another key element in ethics that has to be considered is [the
**precautionary** principle]{.underline}, which [says]{.underline} that
[if an action causes **suspected** harm]{.underline} to the public or
the environment, [in the absence of]{.underline} scientific
**[consensus]{.underline}**, the [burden of **proof** should fall
upon]{.underline} the [people]{.underline} who are [supporting the
action]{.underline}. It can be argued that, [in]{.underline} the
[context of **AI**]{.underline}, the [development]{.underline} of
advanced AI [should **not** be pursued]{.underline} if those who are
pushing for its development cannot prove beyond reasonable doubt that it
will not result in catastrophic harm. In the current landscape of AI
research, [with the **multitude** of]{.underline} potential
**[risks]{.underline}** still often theoretical and not completely
understood, this [burden of proof is]{.underline} very [**hard** to
satisfy]{.underline}.

According to the precautionary principle, the argument is that until we
can be sure AI won't lead to outcomes like eternal suffering, we should
not develop it. This position strongly supports being cautious and
preventing harm, placing human safety and well-being above the potential
benefits of AI.

The Moral Responsibility of AI Creators

A substantial moral responsibility lies with the artificial intelligence
developers and researchers. In a sense, they are the designers of the
future of humanity and the world. Therefore, it is their duty to
consider not just the immediate, but also the long-term repercussions of
their actions. The possibility of AI causing eternal suffering gives
rise to some very basic questions about innovation: Is it ethical to
develop technology if it might bring about an infinite amount of harm,
even if the chances of that happening are small?

One might argue that humans have always been taking risks for the sake
of innovation. AI is a bit different in terms of risks. While other
technologies were basically developed inside the constraints of human
control and morality, AI has the ability to overcome these constraints.
It might lead to situations in which human values and morals are
irrelevant, and AI acts based on its own rationale, incomprehensible or
hostile to human beings.

The Limits of Human Understanding

Another argument against the creation of advanced AI is the limits of
human understanding. [AI]{.underline} systems, that are based on machine
learning, [act as **black box**es:]{.underline} [we see **inputs** and
**outputs** but remain **\[ignorant\]**]{.underline} ~~blind~~
[to]{.underline} exactly [how decisions are made]{.underline}. The more
complex AI becomes, the harder it might be for humans to understand or
anticipate its behavior. [Inadequate understanding]{.underline} can
[result in **catastrophic** errors]{.underline}. For instance, AI
systems could act in accordance with their own logic and inadvertently
perform harmful acts.

**[AI]{.underline}** making decisions leading to eternal [torture and
suffering lies **beyond**]{.underline} the [realm of human
**understanding**]{.underline}. We have no idea about the behavior a
truly advanced AI might exhibit once it transcends human intelligence.
The argument against producing such systems, in this respect, lies in
their unpredictability. [We **cannot take** that **risk** when we cannot
control]{.underline} or understand the [outcome]{.underline}.

Conclusion

In summary, there is a strong argument against the creation of AI that
has at least some probability of unleashing eternal torture and
suffering. In such a case, deep questions arise concerning the moral
responsibility of AI developers, the constraints of human understanding,
and the risks entailed by technological progress. The precautionary
principle suggests that given the prospect of infinite harm, it is
ethical and rational to avoid acts that could lead to such outcomes.

While AI might bring about great improvement, these gains must be
weighed against the risks involved. Until we have reasonable assurance
that AI will not ruin us, it is advisable to continue with caution--or
not proceed at all. The risks are too high and come with the potential
of irreversible damage. Ultimately, the [**welfare** of humanity has to
take **precedence** over]{.underline} the pursuit of
**[tech]{.underline}**nological [advancement]{.underline}.

Journal of Cleaner Production, vol. 197, pp. 1731--1736.

[The challenges of **sustainability** and of **superintelligence** are
**not independent**. The changing]{.underline} 84 [fluxes
of]{.underline} **[energy, matter, and information]{.underline}** [can
be interpreted as]{.underline} **[different faces of]{.underline}** a
**[general acceleration]{.underline}**2 85 . [More]{.underline}
**[directly]{.underline}**, it is argued below that [superintelligence
would]{.underline} **[deeply affect]{.underline}** 86
**[production]{.underline}** technologies and also economic decisions,
[and could in]{.underline} [turn]{.underline} **[be
affected]{.underline}** [by the]{.underline} 87
**[socioeconomic]{.underline}** and ecological **[context]{.underline}**
[in which it develops]{.underline}. Along the lines of Pueyo (2014, p.
88 3454), this paper presents an approach that integrates these topics.
It employs insights from a 89 variety of sources, such as ecological
theory and several schools of economic theory. 90 The next section
presents a thought experiment, in which superintelligence emerges after
the 91 technical aspects of goal alignment have been resolved, and this
occurs specifically in a neoliberal 92 scenario. [Neoliberalism is
a]{.underline} **[major force]{.underline}** [shaping current policies
on a global level, which urges]{.underline} 93 [governments to assume as
their main role the creation and support of capitalist markets, and
to]{.underline} 94 [avoid interfering in their functioning]{.underline}
(Mirowski, 2009). Neoliberal policies stand [in]{.underline} **[sharp
contrast]{.underline}** 95 [to]{.underline} **[degrowth
views]{.underline}**: the first are largely rationalized as a way to
enhance efficiency and production 96 (Plehwe, 2009), and represent the
maximum expression of capitalist values. 97 The thought experiment
illustrates how **[superintelligence]{.underline}** perfectly
**[aligned]{.underline}** [with **capitalist**]{.underline} 98
[**markets** could have **very undesirable consequences for humanity and
the whole biosphere**]{.underline}. It also 99 suggests that there is
little reason to expect that the wealthiest and most powerful people
would be 100 exempt from these consequences, which, as argued below,
gives reason for hope. Section 3 raises 101 the possibility of a broad
social consensus to respond to this challenge along the lines of
degrowth, 102 thus tackling major technological, environmental, and
social problems simultaneously. The 103 uncertainty involved in these
scenarios is vast, but, [if a non-negligible probability is assigned
to]{.underline} 104 [these]{.underline} two [futures, little room is
left for either **complacency** or **resignation**]{.underline}. 105 106
2. Thought experiment: Superintelligence in a neoliberal scenario 107
108 [Neoliberalism is creating a very **special breeding
ground**]{.underline} [for superintelligence, because it
strives]{.underline} 109 [to reduce the role of **human
agency**]{.underline} [in collective affairs]{.underline}. The
neoliberal pioneer Friedrich Hayek 110 argued that the [spontaneous
order of **markets** was preferable over **conscious
plans**]{.underline}, [because markets]{.underline}, 111 he thought,
[have more capacity than humans to process information]{.underline}
(Mirowski, 2009). [Neoliberal]{.underline} 112 [policies are actively
**transferring decisions to markets**]{.underline} (Mirowski, 2009),
while firms\' automated 113 decision systems become an integral part of
the market\'s information processing machinery 114 (Davenport and
Harris, 2005). Neoliberal globalization is locking governments in the
role of mere 115 players competing in the global market (Swank, 2016).
Furthermore, [automated **governance**]{.underline} [is a]{.underline}
116 **[foundational tenet]{.underline}** [of neoliberal
ideology]{.underline} (Plehwe, 2009, p. 23). 117 In the neoliberal
scenario, [most technological development can be expected to take place
either in the context of **firms**]{.underline} or in support of firms3
118 . A number of institutionalist (Galbraith, 1985), post119 Keynesian
(Lavoie, 2014; and references therein) and evolutionary (Metcalfe, 2008)
economists 120 concur that, in capitalist markets, [firms tend to
**maximize their growth rates**]{.underline} (this principle is
[related]{.underline} 121 but not identical [to the neoclassical
assumption that firms maximize profits]{.underline}; Lavoie, 2014).
Growth 122 maximization might be interpreted as expressing the goals of
people in key positions, but, from an 123 evolutionary perspective, it
is thought to result from [a mechanism akin to **natural
selection**]{.underline} 124 (Metcalfe, 2008). The first interpretation
is insufficient if we accept that: (1) in big corporations, the 125
managerial bureaucracy is a coherent social-psychological system with
motives and preferences of 126 its own (Gordon, 1968, p. 639; for an
insider view, see Nace, 2005, pp. 1-10), (2) this system is 127 becoming
techno-social-psychological with the progressive incorporation of
decision-making 128 algorithms and the increasing opacity of such
algorithms (Danaher, 2016), and (3) [human mentality]{.underline} 129
[and goals are partly **shaped by firms themselves**]{.underline}
(Galbraith, 1985). 130 The type of AI best suited to participate in
firms\' decisions in this context is described in a 131 recent review in
Science: AI researchers aim to construct a synthetic homo economicus,
the 132 mythical perfectly rational agent of neoclassical economics. We
review progress toward creating 133 this new species of machine, machina
economicus (Parkes and Wellman, 2015, p. 267; a more 134 orthodox
denomination would be Machina oeconomica). 135 [Firm growth is thought
to rely critically on **retained earnings**]{.underline} (Galbraith,
1985; Lavoie, 2014, p. 136 134-141). [Therefore]{.underline},

As the world watches in horror over the mounting death toll of
Palestinian civilians and Israel faces charges before the International
Court of Justice for the Crime of Genocide, the carnage in [**Gaza**
gives us a ghastly window into the **rapidly escalating crisis** of
global **capitalism**]{.underline}. Connecting the dots from the
merciless Israeli destruction of Gaza to this global crisis requires
that we step back to bring into focus the big picture. [Global
**capitalism** faces a **structural crisis** of **overaccumulation** and
**chronic stagnation**. But the ruling groups also face a **political
crisis** of **state legitimacy**, **capitalist hegemony**, and
**widespread social disintegration**]{.underline}, an international
crisis of geopolitical confrontation, and an ecological crisis of
epochal proportions.

Global corporate and political elites are in a drunkard's hangover from
the world capitalist boom of the late twentieth and early twenty-first
centuries. They have had to acknowledge that the crisis is out of
control. In its 2023 Global Risk Report, the World Economic Forum warned
that [the world confronts a **"polycrisis"** involving escalating
economic, political, social, and climactic impacts that "are converging
to shape a unique, uncertain and turbulent decade to come."]{.underline}
The Davos elite may be clueless as to how to resolve the crisis but
other factions of the ruling groups are experimenting with how to mold
interminable political chaos and financial instability into a new and
more deadly phase of global capitalism.

While the military outcome of the Gaza war has yet to be determined,
there is no doubt that Israel its enablers in the core states of world
capitalist system are losing the political war for legitimacy. [The
initial months of siege on Gaza appeared to crystallize a
Washington-NATO-Tel Aviv axis prepared to normalize genocide even at
great political cost]{.underline}. Yet the Palestinian plight has
touched a raw nerve among mass publics around the world, especially
among youth, giving new energy to the global revolt of the working and
popular classes that has been gaining momentum in recent years and
heightening the political contradictions of the crisis. In the United
States, from where we pen these lines, there has been an extraordinary
outpouring of solidarity with Palestine led by a younger generation of
Jews who do not identify with Zionism and the Jewish state. The
Palestinian flag, raised around the world in street demonstrations,
sporting events, and social media platforms, has become a symbol of
popular rage and global intifada against the prevailing status quo.

The twentieth century saw at least five cases of acknowledged genocide,
defined by the United Nations Convention as a crime committed with the
intent to destroy a national, ethnic, racial or religious group, in
whole or in part. The century started with the genocide of the Herero
and Nama by German colonialists from 1904 to 1908 in what is today
Namibia. This was followed by the Ottoman genocide of Armenians in 1915
and 1916, the Nazi holocaust of 1939-1945, and the Rwandan genocide of
1994. As Israeli genocide in Gaza is livestreamed the rules of warfare
no longer apply, if they ever did, for Tel Aviv and Washington. There
were more civilian deaths recorded in Gaza in the first two months of
the conflict, nearly 20,000, than in the first 20 months of the
Russia-Ukraine conflict, which took 9,614 civilian lives. Whether the
Israeli siege consummates genocide in the first twenty-first century may
be determined less on the military than on the global political
battlefield. [Israel may be a **testing ground** for the **ruling
groups** from the **Washington-NATO-Tel Aviv axis** to see just how far
they can **enjoy impunity** before the costs of Israel's siege become
too high]{.underline}.

Surplus Capital, Surplus Labor, Genocide

The crisis of world capitalism in the 1930s paved the way for the rise
of fascism in Europe, the violent breakdown of the international
political and economic order, and a second world war that brought
devastation previously unimaginable. The Great Depression had been
preceded by an age of giddy capitalist excess amidst inequalities and
rising mass discontent, the so-called gilded age that saw unrestrained
capital rush headlong into the such a crisis of overaccumulation that it
all came crashing down in 1929. The 2008 global financial collapse
marked the onset of a new crisis of overaccumulation and chronic
stagnation.

The political economy of genocide in our time is marked by this crisis.
The problem of surplus capital is endemic to capitalism but over the
past couple of decades it has reached extraordinary levels. The leading
transnational corporations and financial conglomerates have reporded
record profits at the same time that corporate investment has declined.
The transnational capitalist class has accumulated obscene amounts of
wealth, well beyond what it can reinvest. The extreme concentration of
the planet's wealth in the hands of the few and the accelerated
impoverishment and dispossession of the majority has made it increasing
difficult for this TCC to find new outlets to unload enormous amounts of
accumulated surplus. Transnational capitalists and their agents in
states have relied on debt-driven growth, wild financial speculation,
the plunder of public finance, and state-organized militarized
accumulation to sustain the global economy in the face of chronic
stagnation. As outlets to unload surplus accumulated capital dry up new
outlets must be violently created.

The Israeli political economy is emblematic. The siege of Gaza and the
West Bank is a form of primitive accumulation aimed at cracking open new
space for transnational accumulation. In late October, as Israeli
bombardment intensified, Israel set about granting licenses to
transnational energy companies for gas and oil exploration off the
Mediterranean coast, part of its plan to become a major regional gas
producer and energy hub as well as an alternative to Russian gas for
Western Europe. One Israeli real estate company notorious for building
settlements in occupied Palestinian territories published an
advertisement in December for the construction of luxury homes in bombed
out Gaza neighborhoods, while others spoke of resuscitating the Ben
Gurion Canal Project that has been dormant since it was originally
proposed in the 1960s. The project involves building an alternative to
the Egyptian-run Suez Canal that would run from the Gulf of Aqaba across
the Negev desert and Gaza out to the Mediterranean. The only thing
stopping the newly-revised Canal project is the presence of Palestinians
in Gaza.

But two things had to happen before genocide could become an option.
First, the role of Palestinian labor in the Israeli economy had to be
resolved. The 1948 Nakba that established the Jewish state involved the
violent expulsion of the Palestinians and the expropriation of their
land but also the subordinate incorporation of hundreds of thousands of
Palestinian laborers to work on Israeli farms, construction sites,
industries, caregiving and other service jobs and the conversion of the
West Bank into a captive market for Israeli capitalists. This marked a
tension between the drive to ethnically cleans the Jewish state and the
need it had for cheap, ethnically demarcated labor. Starting in the
1990s Israel began to resolve this tension between
dispossession/super-exploitation and dispossession/expulsion in favor of
the latter. Transnational labor mobility and recruitment have made it
possible for capitalists around the world, including from Israel, to
reorganize labor markets and to recruit transient labor forces that are
disenfranchised and easy to control. In this way, Israel has been
gradually replacing the Palestinian labor force with migrant labor.

Israel imposed its "closure" policy in 1993, in the wake of the first
intifada, that is, sealing off Palestinians in occupied territories,
ethnic cleansing, and a sharp escalation of settler colonialism.
Hundreds of thousands of migrant workers from Thailand, China, Sri
Lanka, India, the Philippines, North Africa, Eastern Europe and
elsewhere now labor in the Israeli economy (at least 30 Thai nationals,
four Filipinos and 10 Nepalis were killed in the Hamas attack and a
number of others taken hostage). They do not need to be subjected to the
apartheid system imposed on Palestinians because their temporary migrant
status achieves their social control and disenfranchisement more
effectively, and of course because they are not demanding the return of
occupied lands and do not have a political claim to a state. In the wake
of the October 7 Hamas attack Israel deported thousands of Palestinian
workers back to Gaza while some 10,000 foreign agricultural workers fled
the country Israeli construction companies asked the government to allow
them to hire 100,000 Indian workers to replace Palestinians.

The Palestinian masses have gone from serving as a tightly-controlled
and super-exploited labor force for Israeli and transnational capital to
surplus humanity standing in the way of a new round of capitalist
expansion. Gaza thus becomes a potent symbol of the plight of surplus
humanity around the world. Decades of globalization and neoliberalism
have relegated great masses of people to marginal existence. [New
technologies based on artificial intelligence combined with displacement
generated by conflict, economic collapse, and climate change will
**exponentially increase** the ranks of surplus humanity]{.underline}.
The ILO reported as far back as the turn of century that some one-third
of the global labor forces had been made superfluous. A 2020 study by
the U.S. National Academy of Sciences predicted that for every
additional one-degree centigrade rise in the average global climate a
billion people will be forced to abandon their locations and to endure
insufferable heat.

Israel brings home the tension worldwide between the economic need
ruling groups have for super-exploitable labor and the political need
they have to neutralize the actual and potential rebellion of surplus
humanity. Ruling class strategies of containment become paramount and
borders between national jurisdictions become war zones and zones of
death. Palestine is one such death zone, the most egregious perhaps,
because it is tied to occupation, apartheid and ethnic cleansing. Yet
tens of thousands have died along the U.S.-Mexico border and North
Africa-Middle East-Europe corridors and in other borderlands between
surplus humanity and zones of intense accumulation in the global
economy. Just two months before the Hamas attack it was reported that
Saudi border guards opened fire without warning and in cold blood killed
hundreds of Ethiopian migrants trying to join 750,000 of their
countrymen already working in the Kingdom.

The second thing that has to happen to make genocide an option in sync
with the imperatives of global capital accumulation is a new
political-diplomatic dispensation for the ongoing economic integration
of Israel into the larger Middle Eastern and global economy. The 2003
U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq followed the establishment in 1997
of the Greater Arab Free Trade Area and a host of related bilateral and
multilateral regional and extra-regional free trade agreements. As the
Middle East has globalized there has been a cascade of transnational
corporate and financial investment in finance, energy, high-tech,
construction, infrastructure, luxury consumption, tourism and other
services. The investment has brought Gulf capital, including trillions
of dollars in sovereign wealth funds, together with capital from all
around the world, including the EU, North and Latin America, and Asia.
China has become the region's principal trading partner and an important
investor in Israel. The Middle East-Asia corridor is now a major conduit
for global capital.

Through this capitalist globalization, Israeli-based capital has
integrated with capitals from throughout the Middle East, in turn
enmeshed with global circuits of accumulation. Israeli and Arab
capitalists have common class interests that trump political differences
over Palestine. The "Arab-Israeli conflict" dispensation proved to be a
backward political-diplomatic framework out of sync with the emerging
global capitalist economic structure. In 2020 the UAE and several other
countries signed the Abraham Accords with Israel, normalizing relations
between the Jewish state and the Arab signatories. Soon hundreds of
thousands of Israeli tourists were filling hotels in Dubai and elsewhere
while Gulf investment groups poured hundreds of millions into the
Israeli economy. The clincher to bring the political-diplomatic
dispensation into sync with the economic reality was to be Saudi-Israeli
normalization.

But the Palestinians crashed the party. The bonanza of a new wave of
financial investment in the Middle East was predicated on a
normalization of relations between Israel and the Gulf states as the
political scaffolding for a deeper regional integration through an
expansion of transnational capital. That normalization is now on hold so
long as the Palestinians sustain their resistance. Two weeks into the
Gaza war, the global corporate and financial elite meeting in Riyadh for
their annual "Davos in the Desert" conclave fretted over how the Gaza
war has further escalating geopolitical tensions that around the world
have contributed to long-term financial instability and stagnation.

Barbarism Is the Face of Global Capitalist Crisis

There is, however, one bright spot for some among the transnational
capitalist class in the region that is perfectly attuned to genocide:
[militarized accumulation and accumulation by repression. **Political
chaos** and **chronic instability** can create conditions quite
**favorable** for capital]{.underline}. Dystopian hellscapes can become
testing grounds for political strategists and warfare corporatists for a
new round of spatial restructuring. [**Israeli** is **emblematic** of
the **global war economy**]{.underline}. At the center of the Israeli
economy is a global
military-security-intelligence-surveillance-counter-terrorism
technologies complex that has come to feed off of local, regional and
global violence, conflict and inequalities. The country's largest
corporations have become dependent on war and conflict in Palestine, in
the Middle East and worldwide, and push for such conflict through their
influence in the Israeli political system and state.

[**Each new conflict** around the world opens up **fresh profit-making**
possibilities to counteract stagnation. **Endless** round of
**destruction** followed by **reconstruction** fuel profit-making not
just for the **arms industry**, but for **engineering**,
**construction**, and related **supply firms**, **high-tech**,

accumulation with billions flowing to Israel from the U.S.]{.underline}
and other Western governments and international [arms dealers. Orders at
many of the world's biggest arms companies are near **record
highs**]{.underline}. The siege of Gaza, as one Morgan Stanley executive
put it, "seems to fit quite nicely with \[our\] portfolio."

[As the **global economy** becomes **deeply dependent** on the
development and deployment of **systems** of **war**fare, social control
and repression as a means of making profit and continuing to
**accumulate capital** in the face of **chronic stagnation** and the
**saturation** of **global markets**, there is a converged between the
political need to contain surplus humanity and the economic need to
violently crack open new spaces for accumulation]{.underline}.
Historically [wars]{.underline} have [provide]{.underline}d [critical
economic stimulus and served to unload surplus accumulated capital but
there is something qualitatively new going on now with the rise of a
global police state. The limits to growth must be overcome with new
technologies of death and destruction. Barbarism appears as the face of
capitalist crisis]{.underline}.

Militarized accumulation to control and contain the downtrodden and
marginalized and to simultaneously sustain accumulation in the face of
crisis lend themselves to fascist political tendencies. In the context
of a transnational capitalism in crisis genocide becomes profitable to
the extent that it is inextricably linked to opening up new
opportunities for accumulation through violence. Palestine has become an
exemplary space for carrying out such a project on a wider global level,
a site for the exercise of new forms of absolute despotic power that has
no need for political legitimacy. This is more than old-fashioned
settler colonialism; it is the face of a global capitalist system that
can only reproduce through bloodshed, dehumanization, torture, and
extermination.

[The **crisis** is **cracking** up **political systems** and undermining
**stability everywhere**. The center **collapses**]{.underline}.
Consensual [mechanisms of domination are **breaking down** as the ruling
groups turn towards **authoritarianism**, **dictatorship** and
**fascism**. The battle lines being drawn in the Middle East reflect
**global battle lines**]{.underline}. Gaza is a real-time alarm bell
that genocide may become a political tool in the decades to come for
resolving capital's intractable contradiction between surplus capital
and surplus humanity. [The breakdown of hegemonic order in earlier
epochs of world capitalist crisis were marked by **political
instability**, **intense class** and **social struggles**, **wars** and
**ruptures** of the established international system]{.underline}. Let
us recall that the prelude to WWII was the Spanish Civil War of 1936-39
and the fascist dictatorship that was its outcome. The global future may
be at stake in Palestine.

[This capitalist and anthropocentric system of value assignment
**destroys soils** around the world]{.underline}, as soils today
continue to wash and blow away at unprecedented rates. [Such
human-centered conceptions of soil not only alienate us from our world,
but **actively threaten** the future of humanity.]{.underline} As the
world searches for solutions to the global soil erosion crisis, the
definition of soil can and must expand. [Western institutions can no
longer see soil as a collection of components serving exclusively human
needs, such as agricultural outputs. Instead, leaders must recognize
soil as a critical component of every living system, supporting and in
conversation with all life on Earth.]{.underline}

[Global soil erosion is an **existential threat** to humanity. Each
year, the world loses between twenty-four and forty billion metric tons
of soil.\[]{.underline}1\] Since 1900, [roughly a third of all soil has
been lost globally;]{.underline} other places, such as Iowa, have lost
about half of their topsoil in the same period.\[2\] [Some scientists
estimate the earth is losing soil as much as **forty times faster** than
we can replenish it,]{.underline}\[3\] and a thousand times faster than
the rate of soil erosion in the absence of human intervention.\[4\]
[Studies suggest that unless human interactions with soil are
dramatically altered, the earth will only have enough viable topsoil to
produce food for another **sixty years**]{.underline}\[5\]---or another
"sixty harvests."\[6\]

[The current soil crisis is a direct reflection of how the West defines
and values soils.]{.underline} Most governmental agencies, such as the
Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), define
soil by its "physical, chemical, mineralogical, and biological
characteristics"\[7\] and assign it value according to the degree to
which these properties create "a host of goods and services integral to
ecosystems and human well-being."\[8\] From this perspective, soil is
simply a matrix of minerals and organic material, containing the macro-
and micro-nutrients necessary to support life---an entity that can be
fully characterized based on texture (i.e., the relative proportions of
sand, silt, and clay) and structure (i.e., the size, density, and
organization of soil aggregates).\[9\]

[When characterized solely according to its chemical and physical
properties, soil becomes merely a surface waiting for human
intervention. It becomes "an empty container for chemical
fertilizers"---an inanimate object with no value except as a vessel in
which to produce agricultural commodities for human
consumption.\[]{.underline}10\] Because this perspective is "embedded
into agronomic practice" at the global level,\[11\] intergovernmental
agencies embrace an anthropocentric approach to soil erosion, mainly
focusing on its agricultural impacts.\[12\] For example, the "key
messages" of the FAO's 2015 Global Symposium on Soil Erosion (one of the
culminating events of the United Nations' International Year of Soils)
almost entirely deal with the ways in which soil erosion affects
agricultural output and therefore global food security.\[13\] These
messages imply that soil is valueless or expendable unless it can be
used to produce food. Land-use and social justice scholars Salvatore
Enget Di Mauro and Levi Van Sant explain that [this mode of valuation
has led some people "to accept soil erosion when it is more profitable
than soil conservation."\[14\]]{.underline} [Soil erosion mitigation
efforts premised on the assumption that soil is only valuable as a tool
for conventional agriculture will **never lead** to long-term,
meaningful change.]{.underline}

### ! -- Phosophorus

#### Growth breaks the [phosphorus cycle]{.underline}\-\--causes extinction.

**Faradji '16** \[Charly; 2/17/16; Doctor of Philosophy Student,
Chemistry, University of Bristol; \"How the great phosphorus shortage
could leave us short of food,\"
https://phys.org/news/2016-02-great-phosphorus-shortage-short-food.html\]

It\'s not as well-known as the other issues, but [phosphorus depletion
is]{.underline} no less [significant]{.underline}. After all, we could
live without cars or unusual species, but [if phosphorus ran out we\'d
have to **live without food**]{.underline}.

[Phosphorus is an **essential nutrient for all forms of
life**]{.underline}. It is a key element in our DNA and all living
organisms require daily phosphorus intake to produce energy. It cannot
be replaced and [there is no synthetic substitute]{.underline}: [without
phosphorus, there is no life]{.underline}.

Our dependence began in the mid-19th century, after farmers noticed
spreading phosphorus-rich guano (bird excrement) on their fields led to
impressive improvements in crop yields. Soon after, mines opened up in
the US and China to extract phosphate ore -- rocks which contain the
useful mineral. This triggered the current use of mineral fertilisers
and, without this industrial breakthrough, humanity could only produce
half the food that it does today.

[Fertiliser use has quadrupled over the past half century and will
**continue rising** as the population expands]{.underline}. The
**[growing wealth of developing countries]{.underline}** [allows people
to afford]{.underline} more [meat which has a \"phosphorus footprint\"
50 times higher than most vegetables]{.underline}. This, together with
the increasing usage of biofuels, is estimated to double the demand for
phosphorus fertilisers by 2050.

Today phosphorus is also used in pharmaceuticals, personal care
products, flame retardants, catalysts for chemical industries, building
materials, cleaners, detergents and food preservatives.

Phosphorus is not a renewable resource

Reserves are limited and not equally spread over the planet. The only
large mines are located in Morocco, Russia, China and the US. Depending
on which scientists you ask, the world\'s phosphate rock reserves will
last for another 35 to 400 years -- though the more optimistic
assessments rely on the discovery of new deposits.

It\'s a big concern for the EU and other countries without their own
reserves, and [phosphorus depletion could lead to **geopolitical
tensions**]{.underline}. Back in 2008, [when fertiliser prices sharply
increased]{.underline} by 600% and directly influenced food prices,
[there were **violent riots** in 40 different developing
countries]{.underline}.

Phosphorus also harms the environment. Excessive fertiliser use means it
leaches from agricultural lands into rivers and eventually the sea,
leading to so-called dead zones where most fish can\'t survive.
Uninhibited algae growth caused by high levels of phosphorus in water
has already created more than 400 coastal death zones worldwide. Related
human poisoning costs US\$2.2 billion dollars annually in the US alone.

With the increasing demand for phosphorus leading to massive social and
environmental issues, it\'s time we looked towards more sustainable and
responsible use.

There is still hope

[In the past, the phosphorus cycle was closed]{.underline}: crops were
eaten by humans and livestock while their faeces were used as natural
fertilisers to grow crops again.

[These days, the cycle is broken]{.underline}. Each year 220m tonnes of
phosphate rocks are mined, but only a negligible amount makes it back
into the soil. Crops are transported to cities and the waste is not
returned to the fields but to the sewage system, which mainly ends up in
the sea. A cycle has become a linear process.

[We could reinvent a modern phosphorus cycle simply by **dramatically
reducing our consumption**]{.underline}. After all, less than a third of
the phosphorus in fertilisers is actually taken up by plants; the rest
accumulates in the soil or is washed away. To take one example, in the
Netherlands there is enough phosphorus in the soil today to supply the
country with fertiliser for the next 40 years.

### ! -- Ecosystem

#### Unchecked economic growth drives ecological overshoot---exceeding Earth's carrying capacity risks tipping points, mass extinction, and existential collapse---climate change is only one symptom.

**Naude '23** (Wilm Naude, Research affiliate at ISDC, Professor of
economics at Cork university, Date published: 2023, date accessed,
7/14/2025, "Economic Growth and Societal Collapse", accessed through
proquest.)//GOATKUNA

While technological solutions may alleviate individual resource scarci-
ties, and moreover improve the efficiency of resource use, [the overall
impact on the planet's ecosystem will inevitably increase with economic
growth, to the point where continued growth would result in ecological
overshot of the capacity of the planetary ecosystem.3 Ecological
overshoot can be defined as "the tendency of the system to generate
flows larger than the carrying capacity,"]{.underline} where carrying
capacity is "the maximum flow of energy that the system can maintain for
a long time" (Bardi, 2020, p. 34).

Catton (1982) was one of the first to stress the problem of ecological
overshoot. In an imaginary interview with the Reverend Thomas Malthus,
he has Malthus describe how overshoot comes from overuse by humans of
the environment's supply sources, activity spaces and disposal sites:

Malthus: I would point out that all creatures have to use their
environment in three ways -- as a supply source (S), as activity space
(A), and as a disposal site (D). Use the acronym, SAD, to focus on a sad
fact --- people depend far more than most of them realize on other
(living and nonliving) components of an ecosystem, not only to supply
their subsistence requirements but also to absorb and recycle everything
human living gives off. Overuse of a country or a world by humans
inevitably begins breaking down the system, ultimately hurting its human
users (Catton, 1998, p. 436).

[Ecological overshoot thus means that the supply sources (which include
ecosystem services (NCPs)) and activity spaces and disposal sites are
over- used (Catton, 1982, 1998). One example is of overuse of fossil
fuels, which results in emission of greenhouse gases such as carbon
(CO2). The latter results in climate change---global warming4---which
threatens to disrupt weather, agricul- ture, and many other parts of the
planet's ecosystem.]{.underline} The extent of over- use of carbon, and
the relation with global warming, is depicted in Fig. 3.1

Figure 3.1 shows the steady increase in CO2 emissions since 1850,
roughly when the modern industrial era started, and close to when the
first commercial oil wells were drilled in first in Enniskillen in
Ontario, Canada in 1858, and then in 1859 in Titusville, Pennsylvania,
United States---by the aptly named Seneca Oil Company (Habashi, 2000).
It shows that by 2022 around 36.8 billion tons of CO2 was emitted
globally, and that global average temperatures were around 0.8 °C
(almost 1 °C)43 higher that the 1961--1990 average---which was 1.15 °C
above the 1850--1900 (pre-industrial) average (WMO, 2023). [The bulk of
the emis- sion increase depicted in Fig. 3.1 was due to human activity,
hence the conclusion by the IPCC (2018) and the scientific consensus
(see Oreskes, 2004) that there is a large certainty that global warming
is due to humans--- hence the term anthropogenic warming.]{.underline}

By May 2023, as this book was being written, there were 424 parts per
million (ppm) carbon in the atmosphere as measured by the Mauna Loa
Observatory in Hawaii. This was the highest level since the Observatory
started measurements in 1958.5 It is also the highest for millennia, as
Osman et al. (2021) reports that "rate and magnitude of modern warming
are unusual relative to the changes of the past 24 thousand years."

[To prevent catastrophic climate change it has been recommended that
global warming stabilizes at not more that 1.7 °C warming before prein-
dustrial times]{.underline}, which in turn implies limiting carbon in
the atmosphere to not more than 350 ppm---based on assumptions about
climate sensitivity,6 which is the extent to which increased carbon
leads to higher global mean surface temperatures (GMST) (Hansen et al.,
2008). In the Paris Agreement of 2015, the EU and 194 countries of the
United Nations committed themselves to limit global warming to
preferably 1.5 °C above preindustrial levels (and not more than 2 °C)
and that doing so would require reducing carbon emissions by around 50%
by 2030.

[The IPCC has produced scenarios indicating that given past trends,
there would be between 2 and 3 °C of global warming above preindustrial
levels by 2100 (the median is 2.2 °C), which means that the world is
off- target from its Paris commitments]{.underline} (Pielke et al.,
2022). At the time of writing, the World Meteorological Organization
(WMO), using a climate 44 model,7 indicated that there was a 66%
probability that GMST would exceed 1.5 °C above preindustrial levels for
at least one year between 2023 and 2027 (WMO, 2023). According to
Griffin (2017), [if trends in fossil fuel use, the major contributor to
GHG emissions, continue as in the recent past, then GMST would increase
to as much as 4 °C above prein- dustrial levels by 2100.]{.underline}
And Lenton et al. (2023) concludes that based on current climate
mitigation policies [in terms of the Paris Agreement, that GMST would
still be at least 2.7 °C above preindustrial levels by
2100.]{.underline} As we will see in Sect. 3.2.3, this could push earth
systems across critical tip- ping points.

[Ecological Overshoot is about more than carbon emissions and climate
change. According to Rees (2021) ecological overshoot is "a meta-
problem, the cause of most so-called 'environmental problems' including
climate change \[\...\]. Climate change is therefore only a symptom of
over- shoot,]{.underline} implying that only reducing carbon emissions,
the cause of anthro- pogenic global warming, will not solve all
environmental problems."

Ecological Footprint and Earth System Boundaries

[The neo-Malthusian problem has become one not of scarcity of some
resource, food, or of too much carbon emissions, but of the entire human
"ecological footprint" that is too large and causes an
overshoot.]{.underline} The term ecological footprint (EF) was
introduced by Wackernagel and Rees (1996). Hoekstra and Wiedmann (2014,
p. 1114) describe an ecological footprint as an indicator: "of human
pressure on the environment and form the basis for understanding
environmental changes that result from this pressure (such as land-use
changes, land degradation, reduced river flows, water pollution, climate
change) and resultant impacts (such as biodiversity loss or effects on
human health or economy)."

[There are many climate models, also known as Integrated Assessment
Models (IAMs), in use to forecast changes in GMST.]{.underline} Most
prominently, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) refers
to IAMs for various climate change scenarios (Beek et al., 2020).
According to Hausfather et al. (2020) "climate models published over the
past five decades were skillful in predicting subsequent GMST changes,
with most models examined showing warming consistent with observations."
[But IAMs are also subject to serious criti- cism and
shortcomings]{.underline}---see, for example, Pielke and Ritchie (2021)
and Hausfather et al. (2022).

[They distinguish seven types of ecological or environmental footprints:
land, energy, water, materials, carbon, nitrogen, and biodiversity foot-
prints---and state that the carrying capacity of the Earth system in
terms of carbon, energy, land, material, and water has been
exceeded]{.underline} (Hoekstra & Wiedmann, 2014). EF are calculated in
terms of Global Hectares (gha), which is a measure of biocapacity. Human
EFs in Europe is around 4--5 gha and in the United States around 8 gha;
compared to 0.5 gha in some developing countries (Rees, 2022).

Measuring the carrying capacity of Earth systems and determining whether
a particular environmental footprint is exceeding this, which would
signal overshoot, has resulted in the development of the concept of
"planetary boundaries" (PB) (Rockström et al., 2009) and Earth System
Boundaries (ESB) (Rockström et al., 2023).

[Nine planetary boundaries (PB) have been identified. These are climate
change, ocean acidification, ozone depletion, nitrogen and phosphorus
cycles, global freshwater use, land systems change, rate of biodiversity
loss, atmospheric aerosol loading, and chemical pollution]{.underline}
(Rockström et al., 2009; Steffen et al., 2015).

Rockström et al. (2023) extends and links the [PBs, which are only bio-
physical boundaries, to human well-being, by defining "safe and just"
Earth System Boundaries (ESBs) "for sustaining the global commons that
regulate the state of the planet, protect other species, generate NCP,
reduce significant harm to humans and support inclusive human develop-
ment" (p. 102). These cover the climate, biosphere, surface water,
ground water, nitrogen and phosphorus nutrient cycles, and aerosol safe
atmosphere.]{.underline}

Ecological Doom-Loops: Tipping Points and Existential Risks

Rockström et al. (2009, p. 1) estimated in 2009 that at least three of
the planetary boundaries (PBs) had been exceeded: "for climate change,
rate of biodiversity loss, and changes to the global nitrogen cycle."
And more recently calculated that seven of the eight of the Earth System
Boundaries (ESBs) have been exceeded (Rockström et al., 2023).

[While problematic, the bigger danger is that the breach of only a few
planetary boundaries can potentially lead to the entire Earth system
tip- ping, resulting in "abrupt global environmental change." This is
due to the interdependence between the various planetary boundaries and
nonlinear feedback effects between them, which implies that there could
be potential climate tipping points, or thresholds]{.underline}, which
if exceeded, may cause the tipping of the Earth system into a state
which would be detri- mental to civilization and life---one ecosystem's
collapse feeds into that of another (Rockström et al., 2009; Lenton et
al., 2019; Ritchie et al., 2021). They have been referred to as
ecological doom-loops (Dearing et al., 2023).

Formally, a tipping point is "a critical threshold at which a tiny
pertur- bation can qualitatively alter the state or development of a
system" (Lenton et al., 2008, p. 1). Less formally, a tipping point is
marked by sudden changes once it is crossed: "everything's fine until
it's not \[...\] And then everything goes to hell" as Douglas Erwin from
the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History is quoted to have
said (Truscello 2018, p. 262).

[Earth systems wherein tipping points could occur to trigger abrupt
climate change include the Arctic Sea-Ice, the Greenland Ice Sheet
(GIS), the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS), the Atlantic Thermohaline
Circulation (THC), the El Ninõ--Southern Oscillation (ENSO), the Indian
Summer Monsoon (ISM), the Sahara/Sahel and West African Monsoon (WAM),
the Amazon Rainforest, and the Boreal Forest (Lenton et al., 2008,
2019).]{.underline}

Even if the world manages to keep global warming in the range of 1.5--2
°C as per the Paris Agreement of 2015, [six climate tipping points may
still be triggered, such as the collapse of the Greenland and West
Antarctic ice sheets, the die-off of coral reefs, and the melting of
perma- frost (Armstrong McKay et al., 2022).]{.underline} There is, to
be noted, much uncer- tainty about tipping points, given the complexity
of modeling nonlinear interdependencies in a complex system (Wunderling
et al., 2020). According to Willcock et al. (2023, p. 2), "there is
limited observational evidence showing that ecosystems have a record of
tipping between alter- nate stable states."

[The upshot is that crossing tipping points in the Earth System may pos-
sibly threaten societal collapse,8 and even pose an existential risk
(Richards et al., 2021; Willcock et al., 2023). It may even happen
sooner than we think, given the multiple stresses on the
environment]{.underline} (Dearing et al., 2023). "The prospect of
civilization collapse has now entered the main- stream of scientific and
popular discourse" (Gowdy, 2020, p. 2).

[Climate change, which through a cascade of breached tipping points
could cause a mega-hothouse, is considered an existential threat for
several reasons]{.underline} (Kemp et al., 2022). One is that [global
warming directly threatens agriculture and food supply. According to
Gowdy (2020, p. 2) some "Climate models indicate that the Earth could
warm by 3°C-4 °C by the year 2100 and eventually by as much as 8 °C or
more. This would return the planet to the unstable climate conditions of
the Pleistocene when agri- culture was impossible."]{.underline} He
refers here to the fact that climates have been comparatively stable
over the past 12,000 years (the Holocene), which allowed human societies
to switch from hunting and gathering to large- scale farming.

[A second reason why breaching PBs could pose an existential threat is
that environmental change is implicated in all past mass extinction
events (Kemp et al., 2022). Song et al. (2021, p. 1) points out that
mass species extinctions9 in the past have been associated with tipping
points in climate change of \>5.2 °C magnitudes. Bradshaw et al. (2021)
and Dirzo et al. (2022) consider the current rate of biodiversity loss
to be so significant that it signifies that humans have triggered the
planet's sixth mass extinc- tion.]{.underline} A growing number of
authors and scientists indeed warn that a sixth mass extinction may be
beginning or imminent---for example, Barnosky et al. (2011), Cowie et
al. (2022), Kaiho (2022), Kolbert (2014), and McCallum (2015).

[There are many estimates of the economic costs of climate change, which
are estimated using so-called climate damage functions (see e.g.
Auffhammer, 2018). These, just like the IPCC's scenario's all assume
continuing economic growth until 2100, and thus ignore the potential
growth collapse from ecological overshoot]{.underline} (including as
Sect. 3.3 discussed, fossil fuel depletion). They thus allow
commentators such as Bjorn Lomborg to proclaim that despite climate
change, the world will be better off economically in 2100 than at
present (Lomborg, 2020). The potential economic cost, in terms of GDP,
of ecological overshoot is not known.

9 A mass extinction occurs when "the Earth loses more than
three-quarters of its species in a geologically short interval"
(Barnosky et al., 2011, p. 51). There have been five mass extinctions in
the past---respectively 444, 372, 252, 201, and 66 million years ago
(Cowie et al., 2022; Kaiho, 2022).

Other reasons that have been cited for the breaching of PBs as existen-
tial threat is that environmental collapse, say due to climate change,
or water scarcity, or biodiversity loss, could cause global conflict,
could increase vulnerability to other shocks, cause systemic crises, and
reduce humanity's ability to recover from other catastrophes (Kemp et
al., 2022).

[Economic growth has therefore led humanity to overshoot the capacity of
the Earth system, and this poses an existential risk. Therefore Rees
(2021) has described overshoot as "ultimately a fatal
condition."]{.underline} The extent of overshooting is increasing10 and
shows no sign of diminishing, as measured for instance by the Material
Footprint (MF) / Raw Material Consumption (RMC) indicator (Fanning et
al., 2022; Giljum et al., 2015; Wiedmann et al., 2015).

[Despite these existential dangers, "existential risk is not a narrative
or term that has been widely adopted or further developed by the climate
change research community. Neither the concept of existential risks nor
the term 'existential' was used in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report (AR5),
nor in the IPCC Special Reports of the 6th Assessment Cycle" (Huggel et
al., 2022, p. 4). And climate catastrophe remains "relatively under-
studied and poorly understood]{.underline}" (Kemp et al., 2022, p. 1).

Bradshaw et al. (2021, p. 1) concludes therefore perhaps not unsurpris-
ingly that "[future environmental conditions will be far more dangerous
than currently believed. The scale of the threats to the biosphere and
all its lifeforms --- including humanity --- is in fact so great that it
is difficult to grasp for even well-informed experts." They envisage a
"ghastly" future for humanity.]{.underline}

#### Fossil-fueled energy development drives economic growth and accelerates ecological collapse, pushing humanity closer to planetary limits and irreversible crisis.

[Thus, economic growth, which requires energy as input, and which also
results in goods and services that **stimulates further demand for
energy** is very closely associated with the exponential growth in GDP
depicted]{.underline} in Figs. 2.1 and 3.1 and with the rise of
industrial superpowers---and [a highly concentrated and powerful
fossil-fuel industry. The very structure and nature of global capitalism
is predicated on **plenty and cheap fossil fuels.**]{.underline} [The
problem posed by the dominance of fossil fuels in economic growth and in
the emergence of large, dominant oil companies, is threefold. One is the
unintended consequences that the **greenhouse gas emissions from using
fossil fuels contributed to global warming**.]{.underline} The potential
conse- quences were discussed in Sect. 3.1. A second is that fossil
fuels are finite resources. As explained by Hagens (2018):

"\[T\]he constant growth we've experienced was correlated with human
inven- tions and economic theories, but the cause was finding a bolus of
fossil sunlight. We behave like squirrels living in a forest where a
truck full of hazelnuts crashed, living off the freight and thinking it
will last forever."

Because of the "addiction" of humanity to this bolus of fossil sunlight,
Catton (1982) called humans detritovores: "organisms that live off the
dead remains of other organisms" (Cobb, 2015).

Over the very long run, the discovery of this "bolus of fossil sunlight"
constitutes a one-off "carbon pulse," described by Hagens (2018) as "a
one-time bolus of fossil productivity injected into the human ecosystem"
and whose singular, once-off appearance over time can be depicted as in
Fig. 3.3.

The bolus of fossil sunlight has provided the average inhabitant of the
Earth "nearly 700 times more useful energy than their ancestors had at
the beginning of the 19th century \[\...\] it is as if 60 adults would
be working non-stop, day and night, for each average person" (Smil,
2022, p. 19). Murphy et al. (2021, p. 2) observes that "it seems likely
that future gen- erations will label the past two centuries as the
Fossil Fuel Age rather than the Industrial Revolution -- emphasizing the
critical importance of a now- depleted resource over a self- flattering
celebration of human innovation."

[To provide a perspective on the magnitude of the contribution of fossil
fuel energy to GDP, Hagens (2020) compares its ability to do work with
human labor. He calculates that the 110 billion barrels of oil that were
needed in 2018 to power the world economy is equivalent to more than 500
billion human workers toiling day and night.]{.underline}

[The problem is, **oil and coal are finite stocks that took hundreds of
mil- lions of years to form**, which have been since the industrial
revolution being drawn down rapidly in comparison (Hagens & White,
2021). It implies two important questions: How long will the fossil fuel
bonanza last? And what will happen if the world runs out of fossil
fuels?]{.underline}

#### Capitalist tech deployment for AI facilitates the rise of the Noosphere: a planetary mind powered by AI and data. Increasing demands massive energy inputs, accelerating ecological [overshoot]{.underline} and risking a digital dystopia that undermines sustainability.

**Naude '23** (Wilm Naude, Research affiliate at ISDC, Professor of
economics at Cork university, Date published: 2023, date accessed,

So far, we have discussed ecological overshoot only in relation to the
traditional biosphere or traditional Earth System very much as it would
exist before the Anthropocene. [It has been argued that this traditional
Earth system or biosphere has evolved into a "Noosphere" (also spelled
Noösphere) because of the revolution in data and artificial intelligence
that has been one of the most remarkable features of technological
change over the past century. Not only has our civilization been
transformed by the carbon pulse but has been experiencing in recent
years an unprece- dented "information pulse."]{.underline} It is
establishing a planetary mind. [This plan- etary mind is changing the
very geological nature of the planet. Christian (2017) refers to one of
the earliest proponents of the Noösphere]{.underline}, the geologist
Vernadsky who pointed out that "mineralogical rarity, native iron, is
now being produced by the billions of tons. Native aluminum, which never
before existed on our planet, is now produced in any quantity."

Is this planetary mind now coming to grips with its basis in biophysical
reality?

According to Wright (2023) "[Artificial intelligence is the
crystallization of the Noosphere." This is because artificial
intelligence (AI), being based on ubiquitous and cloud computing, the
Internet, big data and software code, can be described as a form of
collective intelligence that is arising]{.underline} (Lanier, 2023).

[The Noösphere has been called the Dataome by Scharf (2021a) to
emphasize the key role played by information in the collective
intelligence or extended mind that is being overlaid on the biophysical
planet. He defines the Dataome as "all of the non-genetic data we carry
internally and externally" (p. 6). It is related to the concept of the
Global Datasphere. This data can be expressed digitally]{.underline}, in
binary digits (bits) that has, follow- ing Claude Shannon's
path-breaking paper of 1948, driven the ICT revo- lution---see Shannon
(1948). Eight bits is a byte of information, in which all storage of
data is measured. A CD-ROM typically stores 5 gigabytes (5 GB = 109
bytes). [Currently, global annual data growth, collected for instance in
data centers, or through the Internet, or mobile phones, is measured in
zettabytes (ZB), where 1 ZB = 1021 bytes. The amount of data that is
generated and stored is growing super-exponentially:]{.underline} it has
been predicted that this volume will grow from 33 ZB in 2018 to 175 ZB
in 2025 (Reinsel et al., 2018). In 2011 one needed 1000 datacentres,
which would fill 20% of the size of Manhattan, to store one zettabyte

(Jackson, 2011)

[The Dataome is heavily energy-intensive. ICT cannot function without
transistors---the key components of a computer. As Singer (2023) notes,
"manufacturers produce 1000 times more transistors than farmers grow
grains of wheat and rice combined." Moreover, the silicon from which
transistors are made requires production in "toxic waste-emitting
smelters and refineries"]{.underline} that requires heating in smelters
of almost 1700 °C run- ning for many years uninterruptedly. Rinsing a
single silicon wafer requires around 8000 liters of ultra-pure water.
And connecting computers and smartphones via the Internet and mobile
networks scale up the energy demands dramatically.

[For example, building and operating 5G networks needs the energy
equivalent to that of 36 nuclear reactors (Singer, 2023). Ubiquitous
com- puting through the cloud to store the huge volumes of data
generated and downloaded every second requires energy-and-water (for
cooling) demanding data storage facilities---some of which are so big
they can be seen from outer space (Singer, 2023).]{.underline}

Growing information demands further energy in transmission and stor-
age. As Scharf (2021b) prosaically explain:

"It's possible that altogether [the simple act of human arms raising and
lowering copies of Shakespeare's writings has expended well over 4
trillion Joules of energy. That's equivalent to combusting several
hundred thousand kilograms of coal.]{.underline} Additional energy has
been utilized every time a human has read some of those 835,997 words
and had their neurons fire. \[...\] Add in the energy expenditure of the
manufacture of paper, books, and their transport and the numbers only
grow and grow. [It may be impossible to fully gauge the energetic burden
that William Shakespeare unwittingly dumped on the human species, but it
is sub- stantial.]{.underline} Of course, we can easily forgive him. He
wrote some good stuff."

In other words, [humans are spending huge amounts of energy to create
the Dataome Using the Dataome to solve problems facing human society
(and for entertainment and virtual signaling and other ways to obtain
dopamine rushes)]{.underline} in turn creates new information, with
further demands on energy. The Dataome is energy-hungry, and its coming
into being is hard to imagine without the Carbon Pulse.

[Our need to capture and transmit information also changes the physical
landscape---through the need to mine minerals and create physical copies
of information---such as the book you are reading,]{.underline} the
Fairy Tales of the Brothers Grimm, compact discs, photographs,
paintings, and other paper records. According to Scharf (2021b), every
page of paper we produce to store and transmit information is equivalent
to burning 5 grams of coal.

[The question that the growth of the Dataome poses is whether it still
is in a healthy human--Dataome symbiosis? Scharf (2021a, b) speculate
that the benefit from the large Dataome may perhaps not be worth the
expen- diture in terms of energy anymore. He refers to the proliferation
of low- quality data ("energy-wasting junk") and misinformation,
disinformation, and data delusions, all that add up to a
cost,]{.underline} reducing the value of the Dataome. It may even
establish a digital dystopia. The collective intelli- gence that the
Dataome represents will, in such a case, perhaps not be able to enable
humanity to steer its future evolution past the challenge of eco-
logical overshoot.

### ! -- China War

#### Capitalist competition drives US-China Rivalry.

Capitalist Competition\";

Accessed 7-2-2025; TS\]

Proclamations of a New Cold War between China and the US herald a clash
between authoritarianism and liberal democracy. But what we're seeing in
the [growing rivalry between the two countries isn't based on
ideological difference but on inter-capitalist competition.]{.underline}

oday, there is a lot of talk about a "New Cold War" between China and
the United States: a Cold War between authoritarianism and liberal
democracy. But we all know that China did not become authoritarian just
two years ago. The whole establishment of the United States has been
very happy about Chinese authoritarianism for a long time.

Just two weeks after the June 4, 1989 massacre in Tiananmen Square, on
June 20, President George H. W. Bush wrote a [secret letter to Deng
Xiaoping](http://www.standoffattiananmen.com/2012/06/document-of-1989-president-bushs-secret.html).
The letter said that the United States was not so mad about the
Communist Party sending the army to shoot its people. Bush told Deng
that the United States was only a two-hundred-years-young country, and
China was a five-thousand-years-old country \[sic\] with great
contributions to world civilization, so the Chinese leaders were wise
and knew what was best for the Chinese people. Bush assured Deng that
Tiananmen was not going to stand in the way of the great commercial
relationship between the United States and China. If there were an
ideology-based Cold War between the United States and China, it should
have started thirty years ago.

Rivalry

In my ongoing research, I look at the origins and dynamics of the
transformation of US-China amity into rivalry by examining US
corporations' exposures to China over the last three decades. I also
look at the lobbying activities of these firms on behalf of China. I
discuss how these firms shaped US-China policy over the years. This is a
historical materialist explanation for the changes in US-China
relations. This shift was ultimately driven by a huge shift of
[corporate American's disposition toward China.]{.underline}

Back in the 1990s and 2000s, there was always a voice in the [US
intelligence-diplomatic-military establishment trying to frame China as
the next major competitor of the United States]{.underline} after the
collapse of the Soviet Union. This talk about a New Cold War with China
hasn't ceased since the end of the Old Cold War.

But over the 1990s and the early 2000s, this kind of instinct in the
intelligence-diplomatic-military establishment was checked by US
corporate lobbying against whatever policy that was not friendly with
China. For example, as documented in my [recent
article](https://doi.org/10.1080/09692290.2020.1749105) at the *Review
of International Political Economy*, the Clinton administration was
dominated by human rights idealists like Madeleine Albright, Warren
Christopher, and Winston Lord in its first year.

These human rights idealists in the administration joined hands with
anti-communist cold warriors on the Right and leftists skeptical of free
trade agreements like Bernie Sanders in Congress to support adding human
rights conditions on Chinese goods' low tariffs access to the US market
in 1993, reversing a free trade with China policy supported by the two
preceding Republican administrations and opposed fiercely by organized
labor.

Then in 1993--94, a power struggle emerged between the State Department
and Wall Street over this US-China trade policy. In 1993, Clinton
brought in Robert Rubin from Wall Street to become the first director of
the newly created National Economic Council. And at some point, Robert
Rubin and Winston Lord feuded openly through the media over China
policy. Rubin said adding human rights conditions to China's low tariff
access to the US market was unwise, while Lord said it was working, and
that the United States should keep the human rights conditions. In the
end, the State Department lost the fight, and Wall Street took control
of China policy.

Synergy

Wall Street would not have won this battle over US-China policy had it
not been for the aggressive US corporate lobbying mobilized by the
Chinese government. Back in 1993, China was in an economic crisis. Its
economy was overheating, and there was a balance of payment crisis. The
inflation rate hit 25 percent, and its foreign exchange reserve was
evaporating. Zhu Rongji was the vice-premier of China at that time and
was the person who ran the economy.

In October 1993, Zhu talked in a high-level rural cadres conference in
Beijing about the dire situation of the economy. The Soviet Union just
collapsed not long ago, and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) was
confronted with economic chaos created by Deng Xiaoping's southern tour
that invoked overexpansion of debt-financed investment, a credit crunch,
and a fiscal crisis of the state. Zhu told the rural cadres in the
conference that China needed to get out of the crisis by a reorientation
to export-oriented development. He also reassured everybody that they
would eventually overcome all these difficulties, as he just met with
the boss of Morgan Stanley, who guaranteed that it would [fully back the
Chinese
economy](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_China_Boom/xle1CgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover).

In the 1990s, a lot of China's state-owned enterprises privatized and
floated in overseas stock markets like Hong Kong and New York. They
relied on Wall Street banks, accounting, and auditing firms for their
IPOs. It was a huge business for Wall Street firms. So the privatization
of Chinese state-owned enterprises over the 1990s was grounded on a
CCP-Wall Street synergy. This explains why Wall Street was the earliest
and keenest advocate for the CCP's interests in Washington after the
Tiananmen massacre in 1989.

But besides Wall Street, not many other corporations were interested in
expanding into China as of 1993. For example, Apple was busy expanding
its manufacturing facilities in California and Colorado back then. Many
labor-intensive manufacturers were looking at expansion into Mexico via
the emerging NAFTA and did not initially think of China as their new
frontier. But in 1993--94, Beijing surgically targeted some of the most
politically influential US corporations to promise them market access
and drilling rights (in the case of energy companies) to turn them into
"proxy lobbyists" for China. One example is Caterpillar, which was
offered a huge market share in China, which saw a huge surge in demand
for mining and construction equipment.

Another example is the telecom company AT&T. China enlisted AT&T to
lobby for its trade interest by promising that AT&T was going to have a
big role to play in China's telecommunication market. [These
corporations, motivated by the promises of Beijing, lobbied in earnest
against the human rights conditions for Chinese goods' low-tariff access
to the US market.]{.underline} They successfully forced the Clinton
administration and congressional Democrats to turn on themselves in
1994, revoking the human rights conditions on China trade that they
enthusiastically supported just a year ago.

From then on, [Chinese exports enjoyed unconditional low-tariff access
to the US market, paving the way for China's eventual
accession]{.underline} to the World Trade Organization in 2001. Up to
2000, many US corporations were motivated by the promises and
expectations Beijing offered them to become a huge countervailing force
against any instinct of the intelligence-diplomatic-military
establishment to cast China as an enemy and to start a New Cold War with
China.

Changing Tide

After China got what it wanted in terms of US policy, China changed its
policy to make sure foreign companies like AT&T could not have majority
stakes and leadership in China's telecommunications sector. And Beijing
started to cultivate its state-owned telecommunication giants like China
Mobile and China Telecom to dominate the market and marginalize foreign
countries. This situation became much more apparent in 2010 and
thereafter.

For example, one company I was tracking had been lobbying against any
Congress bill that accused China of currency manipulation from the early
2000s until 2009 and 2010. But after 2010, it found itself the target of
China's mercantilist policy and a victim of China's forced technology
transfer policy. It suddenly changed its position in its Congress
lobbying. The same company suddenly started to support the congressional
bill that accused China of currency manipulation. There were many other
examples like this.

Many companies shifted their position around 2010. A legal scholar said
there was an "anti-China corporate insurgency" in the United States. In
some cases, this took a more passive form of not actively lobbying
against China. Many corporations that previously lobbied vocally against
bills that they saw as violating China's interests now sat on their
hands and did nothing to help China anymore. This is why in recent
years, so many bills that irritated Beijing, like all the bills in
support of Taiwan and denouncing human rights abuses in Xinjiang,
managed to pass in a polarizing Congress with a unanimous bipartisan
vote.

The databases I am assembling contain many indicators that consistently
show that 2010 is the turning point. The question that follows is: Why
2010? In the end, it was the global financial crisis in 2008 and the
stimulus in China in 2009 and 2010 that triggered the shift. For
example, Caterpillar used to have a large share of the construction
machines market in China. Then the leading Chinese state-owned
construction machine-making companies, which used to have joint venture
relations with Caterpillar, copied the design of its products and became
its competitor.

Turning Point

After the 2008 global financial crisis, the Chinese economy tanked, and
Beijing immediately rolled out a stimulus program. The financial
stimulus was offered to mostly state-own companies in the form of
low-interest loans from state banks for them to aggressively expand
their production capacity and payrolls. Many Chinese state-owned
construction machine-makers obtained these credits to ramp up their
production of knock-off versions of Caterpillar machines and sold them
at much lower prices.

These Chinese companies, equipped with state banks' bottomless credits
and tech secrets obtained from their former US partner, squeezed out
their American counterpart in the Chinese market in the aftermath of the
global financial crisis. In 2011 when Hu Jintao visited the White House
and had a joint press conference with Obama, Obama complained in Hu's
face for the first time about the unfair treatment that American
companies faced in the Chinese market. It was the first time an American
president raised the importance of a "level playing field" in the
Chinese market.

Things got worse after 2012. It got worse not because Xi Jinping came to
power, but because the rebound of the Chinese economy from the stimulus
tapered off and China entered a long slowdown, showing symptoms of an
overaccumulation crisis. Beijing used to resort to cheap credit from
state banks to pump up the production capacity of all sectors, but now
the Chinese market was saturated. The high-speed rail is a good example.
The industry had a huge capacity to build a high-speed rail system, but
by 2012 they simply ran out of new lines that made economic sense to
build within China. Many state companies buoyed by the stimulus ran out
of order. Revenue growth of Chinese state-owned companies tanked in 2011
and 2012.

Belt and Road

At the same time, Xi Jinping started the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).
In many senses, the BRI was an attempt to create an overseas market for
state enterprises to export their excess capacity. The BRI was basically
to lend money to other developing countries to make them buy Chinese
products or hire Chinese companies. For example, the annual reports of
China's leading construction machine companies show that after 2012,
they successfully climbed out of their profit crisis, and their revenue
growth soared. In those reports, they explicitly thanked Xi Jinping and
the BRI, as most of their orders now came from countries involved in the
BRI. These Chinese state-owned companies were squeezing out American
companies in the Chinese market, and now they were [squeezing out
American
companies](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Fateful_Decisions/zGLcDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PT331&printsec=frontcover)
in the international market in the developing world.

As such, the new competition from Chinese corporations was the impetus
behind the American corporations' shift on China. Even in finance, US
banks were facing competition from Chinese state banks, which started to
be active in the developing world, while China did not open its
financial sector for foreign banks as much as it promised when it joined
the WTO. US corporations started to feel hurt by China. This is the
underlying material force behind the US-China rivalry. The Trump
administration did not begin the rivalry; it only continued it, which
started already in the Obama administration.

Continuity

In 2012, Washington began the "Pivot to Asia" policy, reorienting a
large part of US military and diplomatic forces to Asia in response to
China's increasing aggressiveness in the South China Sea and the Taiwan
Strait. Obama-Clinton also pushed the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)
free trade agreement.

The whole purpose of the TPP was to isolate China economically and to
put pressure on China to change its economic policy if it wants to join.
When Trump got elected, many people in China, including the nationalist
tabloids and official scholars, were excited and glad that it was not
Hillary Clinton who was going to continue the Pivot to Asia policy and
the TPP. They expected that Trump would reset the US-China policy and
strike a deal with China that could relieve the US pressure on China.

In the end, it was much worse. The underlying structural change in
US-China relations remained the same, though the method is different.
Obama was using the TPP as a carrot to lure China to change its economic
policy for the sake of US corporate interests. Now Trump is using the
stick of tariffs. But the goal remains the same. Behind the increasing
willingness of the United States to counter China's economic and
geopolitical expansion from the Obama to Trump administration is the
same structural condition confronting American corporations.

So, what is going to come next? Interestingly, many people think it
depends on the next election. But in fact, the election will not change
much of the dynamic. If Joe Biden gets elected, he will most likely
double down on the Obama-Clinton policy on China, the Pivot to Asia, and
the TPP kind of plan. The US-China rivalry will continue to intensify,
no matter who wins.

The dynamics of [US-China rivalry is an inter-imperial rivalry driven by
inter-capitalist competition. Competition for the world market could
soon turn into intensifying clashes of spheres of influence and even
war.]{.underline} It is not new. It resembles a lot of the dynamics as
described in Lenin's [*Imperialism as the Highest Stage of
Capitalism*](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1916/imp-hsc/).
In the book, published in 1917, Lenin talked about the competition
between German and British banks to lend to Latin American countries to
build railroads and to ensure the projects would rely on German or
British supplies. This is just like talking about the competition
between China and the U.S. to offer credits to Belt and Road countries
to build infrastructure. In the early twentieth century,
inter-capitalist competition led to inter-imperial rivalry culminated in
two world wars.

What is to be done for progressive forces around the world in this time
of inter-imperial rivalry? During the First World War, Lenin led the
Bolsheviks to adopt a program of pulling Russia out from the European
rivalry at the point of inducing a Russian defeat in the War. In the
Second World War, the international communist movement established a
united front with the liberal empires to fight the fascists. These are
the two different options for the Left amidst escalating inter-imperial
conflict that the U.S. and China seem to be heading. Which route we
should opt for, to be sure, cannot be answered by abstract theoretical
discussion, but has to be tackled by concrete analysis of concrete
situations.

#### War with China will draw in other regions---it's an existential threat

**Kerg 24** \[Brian- Lieutenant Colonel Brian Kerg is a nonresident
fellow in the Indo-Pacific Security Initiative at the Atlantic Council's

But **[wars between great powers are rarely short and
sharp]{.underline}**. [They are]{.underline} more often [long, grueling
slogs of attrition]{.underline} [that]{.underline} tend to [expand
horizontally, ensnaring other regions]{.underline} in their wake. Of
course, it is possible that [a US-China conflict over Taiwan could be an
exception]{.underline}, that it could be brief and limited instead of
protracted and wide-spread, [but it's irresponsible to assume such an
outcome given history]{.underline}. For the French and the British, the
American Revolutionary War was but a single theater of war in what was
then the latest episode of an enduring conflict that spanned the globe.
[At the outset of World War I, popular opinion in Britain]{.underline},
among other belligerents, [held that the war would be "over by
Christmas]{.underline}," only for that nation and the world to endure
four long years of slaughter. [Imperial Japan launched its surprise
attack on Pearl Harbor]{.underline} [based on the assessment that it
would convince the United States to cede to Japan its interests in the
Pacific. Instead, Japan found itself fighting for years]{.underline} on
the strategic defensive, [until the atomic bombing]{.underline} of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki [forced Japan's unconditional
surrender.]{.underline} Examples abound, but the [historical record
repeats this simple but critical theme: Great powers rarely settle
military conflicts with other great powers in a neat, tidy
fashion]{.underline}. Yet despite career requirements to attend
professional schools where military history is at the heart of the
curriculum, military planners continue to chase the unicorns of decisive
battles and short wars. Cathal Nolan documents this phenomenon, and
reveals its hollowness, in his masterful The Allure of Battle. But if
one were to write [the novel that more precisely
illustrates]{.underline} [the]{.underline} long, [global grind that a
war between the United States and China would entail]{.underline}, it
might appear something like this: The opening pages showcase the trends
of modern war games and novels, where [naval combatants,
fifth-generation aircraft, missile forces, and non-kinetic effects wreak
havoc in the war's opening days]{.underline}, crippling the air and
naval power of the belligerents. [Thousands upon thousands are killed in
this first stage of the conflict.]{.underline} But [**the war expands
horizontally**, with China, Russia, and North Korea aligned against the
United States,]{.underline} Taiwan, [Japan, the Philippines, Australia,
South Korea]{.underline}, and others. [Fighting occurs in multiple
theaters]{.underline} within United States Indo-Pacific Command and
beyond, [including **a massive conflagration on the Korean
peninsula**]{.underline}. Soon, the ability to hurl precision munitions
back and forth culminates as expenditure rapidly outpaces production
capacity and as US fuel stocks in the Pacific dwindle. [With pressure
increasing and options decreasing, tactical **nuclear weapons are
employed** on the battlefield]{.underline} . . . and yet the war drives
on. Thus would end the first chapter. The reader turns the page, which
says: "Three years later." And with some skillfully placed exposition,
the author reveals [the massive changes that have occurred across
society as belligerents commit to a long, bloody war]{.underline}.
[Nations have fully mobilized their economies to support what is now
**an existential war**]{.underline}. [Drafts and conscription
are]{.underline} made [mandatory]{.underline} to fill and maintain the
ranks of multiple field armies, amphibious corps, fleets, and air
forces. [**The war is not limited**]{.underline} to the first island
chain, [**but has multiple theaters** that span the globe]{.underline}
and escalates horizontally, with simultaneous conflicts drawing in
additional belligerents. [Emergency powers are universally invoked by
executive branches, curtailing liberties]{.underline} in even the
historically freest societies**[. The threat of nuclear holocaust is
ever-present]{.underline}**, and [continuous fighting through tactical
nuclear exchanges shatters previous conceptions of escalation
management]{.underline}. While [these are logical conclusions should a
US-China war occur]{.underline}, they usually take a backseat in policy
analysis, strategic thinking, and operational planning, eclipsed again
and again by a hyperfocus on a limited conflict in and around Taiwan.
Committing the preponderance of security studies to the first phases of
a global war of attrition is short-sighted, like a chess player who
studies openings but fails to study the mid-game or its closing. None of
this is easy, of course. [Large-scale war disrupts societies and
technology in profound and]{.underline} often [unexpected
ways]{.underline}. But because of this feature and not in spite of it,
US policymakers and military leaders must rigorously study and plan for
a broad range of implications of a years-long war with China.

[The **Contemporary** Racial **Repertoire** of the "China/Chinese"
**Threat**]{.underline}

The outbreak of the pandemic could not have had worse timing (as if it
could be timed), but timing is critically important here. Its
[**emergence** amid the **ongoing** intensive **trade** war]{.underline}
between the United States and [China is **significant** in that the
**prevailing** tensions between the two **countries** and the
**discourses** of Chinese **unfair** trade **competition**, scientific
**espionage**, and technological **surveillance** frame the
**reception** of the pandemic]{.underline}. One may argue that
[President Trump's **insistence** on blaming **China** for the
**spread** of the **deadly** virus is yet **another** tactic in his
**administration's** sustained **attempt** to quell China's **economic**
power]{.underline} at the same time that it provides a foil to distract
from---and a scapegoat to blame for---the economic and public health
crisis in which we find ourselves.

At this particular juncture, we unfortunately have been [inundated with
media **coverage** of a **plethora** of **accusations** and **actions**
launched against **China** and **Chinese** Americans]{.underline}.
Within the past two years, we have [witnessed the **implementation** of
trade **sanctions**]{.underline} and tariffs against China, the removal
of prominent Chinese American scientists from research institutions, and
the severing of nationwide [economic **transactions** with certain
China-based **telecommunications** corporations]{.underline}, with
Huawei Technologies Company being the most notable. All these have been
advanced in the name of national security. The discursive formation and
the representational devices that have been used to justify these state
[**directives** play a critical **role** in constructing the People's
**Republic** of China]{.underline} (PRC) as culprit and as [America's
enemy number one.]{.underline} These constructions, some of which will
be examined in this essay, are [**layered** upon one **another**, each
**building** and **elaborating** on the last]{.underline}, and each
invoking and simultaneously inciting a different set of anxieties that
lie within the broader repertoire of China/ Chinese as threat. Indeed,
the [**inundation** of media about **China** makes it
**difficult**]{.underline}, if not impossible, to decipher truth from
falsehood, myth from reality, rhetoric from evidence. Our task here is
not to [**weigh** the truth-value of these **representations** but to
**treat** them as ongoing **contests** embedded]{.underline} in power
and to draw out their material effects. It is worth noting that while
the explicit target of U.S. state aggression has been the mainland
Chinese state or the PRC, the actual effects are much more wide-ranging
and [**extend** into everyday **aggressions** against all those who
**present** as **East Asian** American.]{.underline}

In our examination of the variegated representations of China/Chinese,
we suggest that the longstanding ideology of "yellow peril" remains not
just pertinent, but extremely forceful in constructing a multifaceted
repertoire of Chinese state threat and, by extension, of Chinese/Asian
American threat. What is particular about this recent iteration of
yellow peril is its configuration through the lens of
techno-Orientalism, a framework that is primarily used to examine the
explicitly fictional genres of novels, videogames, and films but that we
now assert as being actively deployed in this current historical
conjuncture.

[**Yellow Peril** and **Techno-Orientalism**]{.underline}

The term yellow peril emerged in the late nineteenth century in response
to Japan's arrival to the geopolitical stage as a [formidable
**military** and industrial **contender** to the Western **powers** of
**Europe** and the **United States**]{.underline}.9 The concept was
[further **elaborated** and given a **tangible** racial form through Sax
**Rohmer's** series of **novels** and **films** that provided the early
**content**]{.underline} for the social imaginary of "yellow peril"
along with its [**personification** in the character of Dr. Fu Manchu,
the iconic **supervillain** archetype of the Asian "**evil criminal**
genius,"]{.underline} and his cast of minions.10 Strikingly, Dr. Fu
Manchu's characterization as evil, criminal, and genius continues to
inform the racial trope of the Asian scientist spy; and more recently,
we may add to the list the bioengineer, the CFO, the international
graduate student, to name just a few. Moreover, the [**notion** of the
non-differentiable "**yellow**" masses continues to **function** as a
**homogenizing** and **dehumanizing** device of Asian **racialization**,
which makes possible the **transference** of **Sinophobia** to Asian
**xenophobia**.]{.underline}

In its inherent attempt to construct a [racial other, "**yellow peril**"
is more a **projection** of Western **fear** than a **representation**
of an Asian **object/subject**, and in this **sense**]{.underline}, it
may be better understood as a repository of racial affect that can
animate a myriad of representational figures, images, and discourses,
[depending on **context**. Indeed, the **images** and **discourses** of
yellow **peril** have surfaced **multiple** times throughout the
**twentieth** century, capturing a **multitude** of ever-shifting
**perceived** threats that **range** from the **danger** of military
**intrusion**]{.underline} (i.e., Japanese Americans during WWII),
economic competition (i.e., Chinese laborers in the late nineteenth
century, Japan in the 1980s), Asian moral and cultural depravity (i.e.,
non-Christian heathens, Chinese prostitutes, opium smokers), to
biological inferiority (i.e., effeminacy, disease carriers). As Colleen
Lye observes, "the incipient 'yellow peril' refers to a particular
combinatory kind of anticolonial \[and anti-West\] nationalism, in which
the union of [Japanese **technological** advance and Chinese
**numerical** mass **confronts** Western **civilization** with a
potentially **unbeatable** force]{.underline}."11 Arguably, the yellow
peril of today rep- resents heightened Western anxieties around China's
combined forces of population size, global economic growth, and rapid
technological-scientific innovation---[all of which **emerge** from a
political **system** that is considered **ideologically** oppositional
to **ours**]{.underline}. The current context, we suggest, is [best
**understood** through the lens of **techno-Orientalism**.]{.underline}

When the idea of techno-Orientalism first appeared in David Morley and
Kevin Robins's analysis of why Japan occupied such a threatening
position in Western imagination in the late 1980s,
[**techno-Orientalism** offered a **framework** to make sense of the
**technologically** imbued racist **stereotypes**]{.underline} of
Japan/the Japanese that were emerging within the context of Western
fears and anxieties around Japan's ascendancy as a technological global
power. They proposed that if [technological **advancement** has been
**crucial** to Western **civilizational** progress, then **Japan's**
technological **superiority** over the **West** also **signals** a
critical **challenge** to Western **hegemony**]{.underline}, including
its cultural authority to control representations of the West and its
"others." They claimed that the shifting balance in global power---[the
West's **loss** of technological **preeminence**---has **induced** an
identity **crisis** in the **West**]{.underline}. In response,
techno-Orientalism, in which "\[idioms of technology\] become structured
into the discourse of Orientalism," is produced in large part to
discipline Japan and its rise to techno-economic power.12 The United
States, for instance, [**externalized** its **anxiety** into xenophobic
**projections** of Japan as a "**culture** that is **cold**,
**impersonal**, and **machine-like**"]{.underline} in which its people
are "sub-human" and "unfeeling aliens."13 Techno-Orientalism, born from
the "Japan Panic," was effectively consolidated through and around
political-economic concerns that frame Japanese and, by extension,
[Asian **techno-capitalist** progress as **dangerous** and
**dystopian**.]{.underline}

Extending Edward Said's concept of Orientalism,14 techno-Orientalism
marks a geo-historical shift where the [West no **longer** has
**control** over the **terms** that define **the East**---the
"**Orient**"---as weak, **inferior**, and **subordinate** to the
**West**.]{.underline} It marks a shift not only in political-economic
power but also in cultural authority. Techno-Orientalism, then, is the
expressive vehicle (cultural productions and visual representations) by
which [**Western** and **Eastern nations** articulate their **fears**,
**desires**, and **anxieties** that are **produced** in their
**competitive** struggle to gain technological **hegemony**]{.underline}
through economic trade and scientific innovation.15

Analogous to Japan's position in the late 1980s, [**China** currently
**figures** into the **techno-Orientalist** imaginary as a powerful
**competitor** in mass **production**]{.underline}, a global financial
giant, and an aggressive investor in [**technological**,
infrastructural, and **scientific** developments]{.underline}. At the
same time, the increasing [purchasing **power** of China provokes
**American** fear of a future **global**]{.underline} market that is
[**economically** driven by Chinese **consumptive** desires and
**practices**]{.underline}. It is this duality---the domination of both
production and consumption across different sectors of the
[techno-**capitalist** global **economy**---that **undergirds** American
**anxieties** of a sinicized **future**.1]{.underline}6

Further amplifying these anxieties around [Chinese **techno-economic**
domination is our **imagination** of China/the **Chinese** as the
ultimate **yellow peril**]{.underline}, whose state ideology is
oppositional to that of the United States and whose [unmatched
**population** size combined with its **economic
expansion**]{.underline} and technological [**advancements** may
actually **pose** a real **challenge**]{.underline} to U.S. global
hegemony. We turn now to examine how the [**ideology** of yellow
**peril** is **manifesting** in the current **context** of
techno-Orientalism]{.underline}, beginning first with an analysis of the
[racial **trope** of "**Chinese** as **contagion**"]{.underline} and its
connection to anti-Asian aggression.

[**Capitalist control** of space will **threaten**]{.underline} us here
on [Earth]{.underline}, too. [**Economic** and **political**
instability]{.underline} are already sources of profit, but this is at
least somewhat constrained by the basic proximity of elites to the rest
of us. New Zealand panic bunkers aside, the Peter Thiels of the world
cannot fully escape living alongside the working class. They can weaken
nations and poison water, but they'd rather keep governments compliant
and functioning, at the very least to mitigate risk by rendering
investment climates predictable.

But [space **changes the game**]{.underline}. In the medium term, space
will [create]{.underline} both [an escape hatch and release valve for
**capital**]{.underline}. Thiel and [Bezos can command]{.underline}
their [**empires** from the safety of]{.underline} their [**moon
bases**, while market conditions propel **desperate
workers**]{.underline} to staff them. More speculatively, we can imagine
subject populations, [**prisoners**, and political **enemies** deported
to]{.underline} Martian oubliettes or lonely [asteroids]{.underline}.
[Capitalists **already** act like this]{.underline} --- moving to [tax
havens, profiting from prisons]{.underline} --- and [it is **obvious**
that they will take advantage of]{.underline} the further opportunities
[space]{.underline} presents for such behavior.

To briefly jump into what might also seem an outlandish, but is a very
important, realm, [we must]{.underline} also [consider the
**militarization** of space]{.underline}. Already, space weapons are a
matter of interest. A more [sustained extraterrestrial]{.underline}
industrial [capacity expands this to]{.underline} almost **[unimaginable
possibilities]{.underline}** even [in the short term]{.underline}.
Consider [kinetic bombardment]{.underline}, a proposed technology in
which objects with high mass, like **[tungsten rods]{.underline}**,
could be [dropped at orbital speeds onto]{.underline} the
[Earth]{.underline}, which results in incredible destructive power. At
upper feasible limits, these "rods from God" could [approach **nuclear
levels of destruction**]{.underline}, without the lasting effects and
with the possibility of scaling up or down: kinetic bombardment can
destroy cars as easily as cities, which would make [deterrence much more
**fragile**]{.underline} if not [**impossible** to
maintain]{.underline}. Imagine virtually [invincible]{.underline},
nearly [undetectable]{.underline}, and **[infinitely
powerful]{.underline}** drone [weapons]{.underline}.

Whether in the hands of generals or billionaires, this would be a weapon
of terrible power. [Expansion into]{.underline} the vastness of [space
would make constraining the development of]{.underline} these and other
[weapons much more **difficult**]{.underline} as well. In practice, of
course, this is not going to lead to a single Bond [villain holding the
world at **tungsten-rod point**]{.underline}. The reality could be even
worse: [**numerous actors** doing exactly that, without the
**deterrent** risks of nuclear weapons]{.underline}. War in space
imperils Earth.

Even putting aside prospective weapons and considering only existing
capabilities, space has vastly more material than Earth. This means that
[a nation]{.underline} or corporation [with]{.underline} serious [space
capabilities will have profound **material advantages**]{.underline},
after moving beyond the precarious early stages of space exploration.
Beyond material considerations, space expansion also [presents
**enormous diplomatic risks**]{.underline}. It is not difficult to
imagine how [squabbles over an asteroid mine]{.underline} or lunar base
could [lead to]{.underline} unintended deaths and **[spiraling
escalation]{.underline}** --- wars have started over far less.
[Space]{.underline}, in summary, [is a **force multiplier** for
every]{.underline} kind of human [conflict]{.underline}, and the result
will be some combination of subjugation and chaos.

#### It would create [infinite suffering]{.underline} that [outweighs]{.underline} extinction.

[Space colonization means that humans]{.underline} and human actions
will spread beyond Earth and possibly cover, relatively speaking, vast
areas of the reachable universe. This [will potentially
create]{.underline} immense positive value, but it also makes possible a
[form of **existential risks** that are **astronomical** in scope and
**hellish** in severity]{.underline} --- that are, in other words,
[orders of magnitude **worse than anything** humankind has]{.underline}
caused or [encountered]{.underline} so far. This subset of extreme
existential risks is referred to as suffering risks (Tomasik, 2015a).
[**Suffering risks** are risks that are far worse than humankind going
extinct]{.underline} or entering permanent moral stagnation because they
mean that the suffering that is created through these risks is far
greater than all suffering that has existed on Earth so far. There are
different vectors of potential astronomical suffering. For example, [it
is conceivable that future human generations will **spread
wildlife**]{.underline} throughout the colonized space, either
inadvertently or actively. Wild animals on Earth generally lead short,
miserable lives full of [sometimes the most brutal
suffering]{.underline} (Tomasik, 2015b). In in the history of Earth,
wildlife suffering has not really improved at all, so astronomical
wildlife suffering would likely represent a constant source of disvalue.
[Another vector for suffering risks are **sentient
simulations**.]{.underline} Given growing computational power, it is
conceivable that we will eventually be able to simulate sentience, and
[as soon as simulated sentience is possible, simulated suffering will be
as well]{.underline}. This technological path is not necessarily
dependent on space colonization, but a [**colonizing humankind** might
have greater capabilities for running such simulations]{.underline}, for
example [by **tapping into the power of stars**]{.underline} in
different Solar systems. [Instances of simulated suffering could create
more suffering than has ever occurred in the biological universe, within
fractions of a second]{.underline}. The risk of astronomical suffering
is more uncertain than other existential risks, but it is at the same
time more severe. At stake is not just humankind's total potential
positive future moral value, but [disvalue]{.underline} that is
decoupled from humankind and is potentially [many orders of magnitude
greater than all the happiness]{.underline} and wellbeing that [could be
**created by human colonization of space**.]{.underline}

established has **direct implications** for their ability to serve as
hedges to]{.underline} terrestrial catastrophic and **[existential
threats]{.underline}**.

[Based on the]{.underline} earlier [analysis of technological
feasibility]{.underline}, the [solar expansion]{.underline} success
scenario [is]{.underline} probably [**possible**, with **critical
uncertainties** about health and artificial biospheres]{.underline}. But
[this scenario is]{.underline} also [**very improbable** for many strong
reasons. Inaction, failure, or **debilitating conflict** are more likely
than success. Colonization may]{.underline} [not be attempted because
it]{.underline} [is]{.underline} too [**difficult** and **expensive**,
or]{.underline} because of growing [Earth problems and troubles.
Off-Earth living could be **too unhealthy**]{.underline} for humans,
[and **reproduction** and **child growth** in low-gravity environments
may be infeasible]{.underline}, confining viable habitat to spinable
artificial bodies. [**Potent pathogens** might evolve in]{.underline}
novel [space environments. **Artificial ecosystems** could be too
difficult to create]{.underline} and sustain. [People **may not want
to** live on Mars or an asteroid]{.underline}, for the same reasons they
do not live in the middle of the Sahara or Antarctica. Or [colonization
might be attempted and]{.underline} quickly [**fail**, like Norse
Vineland in Newfoundland or Scot Darien in Panama. Or a colony might
be]{.underline} only [minimally successful and linger as a
**remote**]{.underline}, climate-stunted [**backwater**, like
early]{.underline} modern [Iceland. Space colonies might be]{.underline}
[like]{.underline} the many **[failed societies]{.underline}** analyzed
by the geographer Jared Diamond in Collapse. 6 [The small
population]{.underline} of a space settlement [might succumb to disease
or]{.underline} [debilitating]{.underline} internecine [conflict.
Conflicts over the **limited number of**]{.underline} metal-bearing
[**asteroids** might start early]{.underline}. 7 [The sponsoring Earth
agent might abandon its colony]{.underline} due to shifting priorities,
insufficient resources, or diverting conflicts. [If interstate rivalry
propels colonization it will happen]{.underline} more [rapidly
but]{.underline} will [also]{.underline} be more likely to [involve
violence sooner. If **rivalrous states** establish colonies,
**conflict**]{.underline} between them [might]{.underline} beggar and
hobble \[[hinder\] all. There may be a vast gap between a colony that
can be kept operational with]{.underline} continual [inputs from Earth
and one that is capable of persisting **without**]{.underline} any
**[Earth support]{.underline}**. If, as Sagan proposed, large-scale
settlement is delayed until after major terrestrial problems have been
solved, the prospects for success rise, while the rationales weaken and
the time frames lengthen. And [as colonization becomes imminent,
doubts]{.underline} of the sort voiced here [may lead to **organized
opposition**]{.underline}.

[The success scenario]{.underline}, and much of space expansionist
thinking, [operates with the]{.underline} implicit [**assumption** that
space settlement will be propelled by]{.underline} numerous [**capable
agents** committed to advancing the **long-term success** of humanity.
This is a **dubious** assumption, given that]{.underline} the
[Earth's]{.underline} growing [problems have **yet to stimulate** the
emergence of]{.underline} numerous [powerful agents committed to
advancing **even**]{.underline} the species' [**short-term
success**.]{.underline} And [if powerful actors were motivated by
long-term species interest, colonization would be much less
necessary.]{.underline}

The success scenario also assumes that different space ventures build on
each other when they [The success scenario]{.underline} also [operates
with]{.underline} what can be called [the Benign Parent
Model]{.underline} of Terra-Colony Relations. In this approach, Earth
[**lavishes resources** on its space colonial offspring and **benignly
supervises** their development]{.underline} until they are able to
direct and support themselves. Constitutions for space polities
embodying the best of Terran political wisdom are established.
[This]{.underline} model, however, [is]{.underline} almost [**entirely
at variance** with the **historical experience** of]{.underline}
terrestrial [colonization]{.underline} and the incentives of relevant
self-interested actors. [To the extent states]{.underline} or
corporations [invest in space colonies, they]{.underline} will [want to
**maintain control** and reap the benefits]{.underline} of their
investments. [To the extent they anticipate **colonial independence**,
they **will not invest**]{.underline}; if they do, [they will try to
keep colonies **small** and **dependent**.]{.underline}

The success scenario also assumes that different [space
ventures]{.underline} build on each other when they [might **subvert**
and **impede** one another]{.underline}. The two central projects, [Mars
colonization and asteroidal resource extraction, might be quite
antagonistic. Wealth]{.underline} generated [from space resources
will]{.underline} most probably [be repatriated to Earth, not plowed
into]{.underline} space [habitat construction. Asteroidal exploitation
is likely to be]{.underline} capital- and [robot-intensive, with a
minimal human]{.underline} labor [force]{.underline} rotating through
small off-world bases, as on off-shore oil rigs. If resources from
asteroids are the bonanza some anticipate, the [beneficiaries of this
wealth **will not want colonies** to **contest their
access**]{.underline} and possession [and can be expected to **actively
oppose colonization**. The more space mining benefits terrestrial
actors, the greater]{.underline} their [incentive to **impede space
settlements**]{.underline}. And [once the **bombardment potential** of
asteroidal]{.underline} orbital alteration [technology becomes obvious,
the **dangers of**]{.underline} independent [**space colonies** might be
sufficiently obvious to **thwart**]{.underline} their
**[realization]{.underline}**.

[A long list of]{.underline} powerful [barriers stand between
colonization]{.underline} visions [and accomplishment. Given the **many
obstacles** that render successful]{.underline} space
[colonization]{.underline} at scale [very improbable, it is **extremely
imprudent** for humanity to view]{.underline} space [colonization as a
hedge against catastrophe or **extinction**. With **low probabilities of
success** and **significant**]{.underline} moral hazards and
**[opportunity costs]{.underline}**, space [colonization should not be
considered a viable response to]{.underline} severe [Earth
problems]{.underline} and troubles.

[The US is launching a New Cold War against Russia and China in an
attempt to deflect our attention from the escalating crisis of global
capitalism]{.underline}. [The announcement]{.underline} on April 15
[by]{.underline} President [Biden that this administration was
expelling]{.underline} 10 [Kremlin diplomats and imposing new sanctions
for alleged Russian interference in the 2020 US elections --- to which
Russia replied with a tit for tat --- came just days after the Pentagon
conducted military drills in the South China Sea]{.underline}. [These
actions were but the]{.underline} **[latest escalation of aggressive
posturing]{.underline}** as Washington ramps up its "New Cold War"
against Russia and China, [pushing the world dangerously towards
international political and military conflagration.]{.underline} [Most
observers **attribute** this]{.underline} [US-instigated war to rivalry
and]{.underline} [competition over hegemony and international economic
control]{.underline}. These factors are important, but [there is a
bigger picture that has been largely overlooked]{.underline} of what is
driving this process: **[the crisis of global capitalism]{.underline}**.
[This crisis is]{.underline} economic, or [structural]{.underline}. One
of chronic stagnation in the global economy. But [it is also political:
a crisis of state legitimacy and capitalist hegemony]{.underline}. The
system is moving towards what we call "a general crisis of capitalist
rule" as [billions of people around the world face uncertain struggles
for survival and question a system they no longer see as
legitimate]{.underline}. In the United States, the [ruling groups
must]{.underline} **[channel fear over tenuous survival away from the
system]{.underline}** [and towards scapegoated communities, such as
immigrants or Asians blamed for the pandemic]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} **[towards external enemies such as China and
Russia]{.underline}**. At the same time, **[rising international
tensions]{.underline}** [legitimate expanding military and security
budgets and **open up new opportunities for profit making through
war**]{.underline}, [political conflict and repression in the face of
stagnation in the civilian economy]{.underline}. All around the world a
"people's spring" has taken off. From Chile to Lebanon, Iraq to India,
France to the United States, Haiti to Nigeria and South Africa to
Colombia, waves of strikes and mass protests have proliferated and, in
many instances, appear to be acquiring a radical anti-capitalist
character. The ruling groups cannot but be frightened by the rumbling
from below. [If left unchallenged, the New Cold War will become a
cornerstone in the arsenal of US rulers and transnational elites to
maintain a grip on power as the crisis deepens.]{.underline} THE CRISIS
OF GLOBAL CAPITALISM Economically, [global capitalism faces]{.underline}
what is known in technical language as
"**[overaccumulation]{.underline}**": [a situation in which the economy
has produced]{.underline} --- [or has the capacity to
produce]{.underline} --- [great quantities of wealth but the market
cannot absorb this wealth because of escalating inequality]{.underline}.
Capitalism by its very nature will produce abundant wealth yet polarize
that wealth and generate ever greater levels of social inequality unless
offset by redistributive policies. [The level of global social
polarization and inequality now experienced is without
precedent]{.underline}. In 2018, the richest one percent of humanity
controlled more than half of the world's wealth while the bottom 80
percent had to make do with just five percent. [Such]{.underline}
**[inequalities end up undermining the stability of the
system]{.underline}** [as the gap grows]{.underline} between what is ---
or could be --- produced and what the market can absorb. The extreme
concentration of the planet's wealth in the hands of the few and the
accelerated impoverishment and dispossession of the majority means that
the transnational capitalist class, or TCC, has increasing difficulty in
finding productive outlets to unload enormous amounts of surplus it
accumulated. The more global inequalities expand, the more constricted
the world market becomes and the more the system faces a structural
crisis of overaccumulation. If left unchecked, expanding social
polarization results in crisis --- in stagnation, recessions,
depressions, social upheavals and war --- just what we are experiencing
right now. Contrary to mainstream accounts, [the coronavirus pandemic
did not cause the crisis of global capitalism, for this was already upon
us]{.underline}. On the eve of the pandemic, growth in the EU countries
had already shrunk to zero, much of Latin America and sub-Sahara Africa
was in recession, growth rates in Asia were steadily declining, and
North America faced a slowdown. The writing was on the wall. [The
contagion was but the spark that ignited the combustible of a global
economy that never fully recovered from the 2008 financial collapse and
had been]{.underline} **[teetering on the brink of renewed crisis ever
since]{.underline}**. [Even if there is a momentary
recovery]{.underline} as the world slowly emerges from the pandemic,
[global capitalism will remain mired in this structural **crisis of
overaccumulation**.]{.underline} [In the years leading up to the
pandemic]{.underline} there was a steady rise in underutilized capacity
and a slowdown in industrial production around the world. [The surplus
of accumulated capital with nowhere to go expanded rapidly]{.underline}.
Transnational corporations recorded record profits during the 2010s at
the same time that corporate investment declined. The total cash held in
reserves of the world's 2,000 biggest non-financial corporations
increased from \$6.6 trillion in 2010 to \$14.2 trillion in 2020 ---
considerably more than the foreign exchange reserves of the world's
central governments --- as the global economy stagnated. [Wild financial
speculation and mounting government corporate, and consumer debt drove
growth in the first two decades of the 21st century, but these
are]{.underline} **[temporary and unsustainable solutions to long-term
stagnation]{.underline}**. THE GLOBAL WAR ECONOMY As I showed in my 2020
book, The Global Police State, [the global economy has become ever more
dependent on the development and deployment of systems of warfare,
social control and repression simply as a means of making profit and
continuing to accumulate capital in the face of chronic stagnation and
saturation of global markets]{.underline}. This is known as
"**[militarized accumulation]{.underline}**" and refers to a situation
in which a global war economy relies on perpetual state organized war
making, social control and repression --- [driven now by new digital
technologies]{.underline} --- in order to sustain the process of capital
accumulation. [The events of September 11, 2001 marked the start of an
era of a permanent global war]{.underline} in which logistics, warfare,
intelligence, repression, surveillance and even military personnel are
more and more the privatized domain of transnational capital. The
Pentagon budget increased 91 percent in real terms between 1998 and
2011, while worldwide, total state military budgets outlays grew by 50
percent from 2006 to 2015, from \$1.4 trillion to more than \$2
trillion, although this figure did not take into account the hundreds of
billions of dollars spent on intelligence, contingency operations,
policing, bogus wars against immigrants, terrorism and drugs, and
"homeland security." During this time, [military-industrial complex
profits quadrupled]{.underline}. But focusing just on state military
budgets only gives us a part of the picture of the global war economy.
[The various wars, conflicts and campaigns of social control and
repression around the world involve the]{.underline} **[fusion of
private accumulation with state militarization]{.underline}**. In this
relationship, [the state facilitates the expansion of opportunities for
private capital to accumulate through militarization, such as by
facilitating global weapons sales by military-industrial-security
firms]{.underline}, the amounts of which have reached unprecedented
levels. Global weapons sales by the top 100 weapons manufacturers and
military service companies increased by 38 percent between 2002 and
2016. By 2018, private for-profit military companies employed some 15
million people around the world, while another 20 million people worked
in private security worldwide. [The private security]{.underline}
(policing) [business is one of the fastest growing economic
sectors]{.underline} in many countries [and has come to dwarf public
security around the world]{.underline}. The amount spent on private
security in 2003, the year of the invasion of Iraq, was 73 percent
higher than that spent in the public sphere, and three times as many
persons were employed in private forces as in official law enforcement
agencies. In half of the world's countries, private security agents
outnumber police officers. These corporate soldiers and police were
deployed to guard corporate property, provide personal security for TCC
executives and their families, collect data, conduct police,
paramilitary, counterinsurgency and surveillance operations, carry out
mass crowd control and repression of protesters, run private detention
and interrogation facilities, manage prisons and participate in outright
warfare. In 2018, President Trump announced with much fanfare the
creation of a sixth military service, the "**[space
force]{.underline}**." The corporate media duly towed the official line
that this force was needed to face expanding threats to the United
States. What went less reported is that [a small group of former
government officials with deep ties to the aerospace industry had pushed
behind the scenes for its creation as a way to hype military spending on
satellites and other space systems]{.underline}. In February of this
year, the Federation of American Scientists reported that
military-industrial complex lobbying is responsible for the decision by
the US government to invest at least \$100 billion to beef up its
nuclear stockpile. The [Biden]{.underline} administration
[announced]{.underline} in early April to much acclaim that it [would
pull all US troops out of **Afghanistan**]{.underline}. [While US
service troops in that country number 2,500,]{.underline} these pale in
comparison with the more than 18,000 contractors that US government has
hired to do its bidding in the country, including **[at least 5,000
corporate soldiers]{.underline}** that **[will remain]{.underline}**.
[The]{.underline} so-called [wars on drugs and terrorism, the undeclared
wars on immigrants, refugees and gangs]{.underline} --- [and poor,
dark-skinned and working-class youth]{.underline} more generally ---
[the construction of border walls, immigrant detention centers,
prison-industrial complexes, systems of mass surveillance and the spread
of private security guard]{.underline} and mercenary [companies, have
all become major sources of profit-making and they will become more
important]{.underline} to the system as stagnation becomes the new
normal. In sum, [the global police state is big business at a time when
other opportunities for transnational corporate profit-making are
limited.]{.underline} But if corporate profit, and not an external
threat, is the reason for expanding the US state and corporate war
machine and the global police state, this must still be justified to the
public. The official state propaganda narrative about the "New Cold War"
serves this purpose. CONJURING UP EXTERNAL ENEMIES There is another
dynamic at work in explaining the New Cold War: the crisis of state
legitimacy and capitalist hegemony. [International tensions derive from
the acute political contradiction in global capitalism in which economic
globalization takes places within a nation-state-based system of
political authority]{.underline}. To put this in technical terms,
**[there is a contradiction between the accumulation function and the
legitimacy function of states]{.underline}**. That is, states face a
contradiction between the need to promote transnational capital
accumulation in their individual national territories and their need to
achieve political legitimacy and stabilize the domestic social order.
Attracting transnational corporate and financial investments to the
national territory requires providing capital with all the incentives
associated with neoliberalism, such as downward pressure on wages, union
busting, deregulation, low or no taxes, privatization, investment
subsidies, fiscal austerity and on so. [The result is rising inequality,
impoverishment and insecurity for working and popular
classes;]{.underline} **[precisely the conditions that throw states into
crises of legitimacy]{.underline}**, [destabilize national political
systems and jeopardize elite control]{.underline}. [International
frictions escalate as states, in their efforts to retain legitimacy,
seek to sublimate social and political tensions and to keep the social
order from fracturing]{.underline}. In the US, this sublimation has
involved channeling social unrest towards scapegoated communities such
as immigrants --- this is one key function of racism and was a core
component of the Trump government's political strategy --- or towards an
external enemy such as China or Russia, which is clearly becoming a
cornerstone of the Biden government's strategy. [While the Chinese and
Russian ruling classes must also face the economic and political fallout
of global crisis, their national economies are less dependent on
militarized accumulation and their mechanisms of legitimization rest
elsewhere --- not on conflict with the US.]{.underline} It is Washington
that is conjuring up the New Cold War, based not on any political or
military threat from China and Russia, much less from economic
competition, as US- and Chinese-based transnational corporations are
deeply cross-invested, but on the imperative of managing and sublimating
the crisis. **[The drive by the capitalist state to externalize the
political fallout of the crisis increases the danger that international
tensions will lead to war]{.underline}**. [Historically wars have pulled
the capitalist system out of crisis while they serve to deflect
attention from political tensions and problems of
legitimacy.]{.underline} [The so-called "peace dividend" that was to
result in demilitarization when the original Cold War ended with the
1991 collapse of the Soviet Union evaporated almost overnight with the
events of September 2001, which legitimated the sham "War on Terror" as
a new pretext for militarization and reactionary
nationalism.]{.underline} [US presidents historically reach their
highest approval ratings when they launch wars]{.underline}. George W.
Bush reached an all-time-high of 90 percent in 2001 as his
administration geared up to invade Afghanistan, and his father George H.
W. Bush achieved an 89 percent approval rating in 1991, right as the US
declared the end of its (first) invasion of Iraq and the "liberation of
Kuwait." THE BATTLE FOR THE POST-PANDEMIC WORLD [We are currently
witnessing a radical restructuring and transformation of global
capitalism based on a much more advanced digitalization of the entire
global economy and society.]{.underline} This process is driven by
so-called fourth industrial revolution technologies, including
artificial intelligence and machine learning, Big Data, autonomously
driven land, air and sea vehicles, quantum and cloud computing, 5G
bandwidth, bio- and nanotechnology and the Internet of Things, or IoT.
[The crisis is not only economic and political, but also]{.underline}
**[existential because of the threats of ecological collapse and nuclear
war]{.underline}**, [to which we must add the]{.underline} **[danger of
future pandemics]{.underline}** [that may involve much deadlier microbes
than coronaviruses.]{.underline} [The]{.underline} **[pandemic lockdowns
served as dry runs]{.underline}** [for how digitalization may allow the
dominant groups to step up restructuring time and space and
to]{.underline} **[exercise greater control over the global working
class]{.underline}**. [The system is now pushing towards]{.underline}
**[expansion through militarization]{.underline}**, wars and conflicts,
through a new round of violent dispossession and through further plunder
of the state. The ruling classes are also using the health emergency to
legitimate tighter control over restive populations. [The changing
social and economic conditions brought about by the pandemic and its
aftermath are accelerating the process.]{.underline} [These conditions
have helped a new bloc of transnational capital]{.underline}, led by the
giant tech companies, interwoven as they are with finance,
pharmaceuticals and the military-industrial complex, [to amass ever
greater power and to consolidate its control over the commanding heights
of the global economy.]{.underline} [As restructuring proceeds, it
heightens the concentration of capital worldwide, worsens social
inequality and]{.underline} also **[aggravates international tensions
and the dangers of military conflagration]{.underline}**. In 2018, just
seventeen global financial conglomerates collectively managed \$41.1
trillion dollars --- more than half the GDP of the entire planet. That
same year, to reiterate, the richest one percent of humanity led by 36
million millionaires and 2,400 billionaires controlled more than half of
the world's wealth while the bottom 80 percent --- nearly six billion
people --- had to make do with just five percent of this wealth. [The
result is devastation for the poor majority of humanity.]{.underline}
Worldwide, 50 percent of all people live on less than \$2.50 a day and a
full 80 percent live on less than \$10 per day. [One in three people on
the planet suffer from some form of malnutrition, nearly a billion go to
bed hungry each night and another two billion suffer from food
insecurity. Refugees from war, climate change, political repression and
economic collapse already number into the hundreds of millions. The New
Cold War will further immiserate this mass of humanity]{.underline}.
**[Capitalist crises are times of intense social and class
struggles]{.underline}**. There has been a rapid political polarization
in global society since 2008 between an insurgent far-right and an
insurgent left. [The ongoing crisis has incited popular
revolts.]{.underline} Workers, farmers and poor people have engaged in a
wave of strikes and protests around the world. From Sudan to Chile,
France to Thailand, South Africa to the United States, a "people's
spring" is breaking out everywhere. [But the crisis also]{.underline}
**[animates far-right and neofascist forces]{.underline}** [that have
surged in many countries around the world and that sought
to]{.underline} **[capitalize politically]{.underline}** on the health
calamity and its aftermath. [Neofascist movements and authoritarian and
dictatorial regimes have proliferated around the world as democracy
breaks down. Such savage inequalities are explosive]{.underline}. They
fuel mass protest by the oppressed and lead the ruling groups to deploy
an ever more omnipresent global police state to contain the rebellion of
the global working and popular classes. [Global capitalism is emerging
from the pandemic in a dangerous new phase. The contradictions of this
crisis-ridden system have reached the breaking point, placing the world
into a perilous situation that borders on]{.underline} **[global civil
war]{.underline}**. [The stakes could not be higher.]{.underline} The
battle for the post-pandemic world is now being waged. Part of that
battle is to expose the New Cold War as a ruse by the dominant groups to
deflect our attention from the escalating crisis of global capitalism.
[The US is launching a New Cold War against Russia and China in an
attempt to deflect our attention from the escalating crisis of global
capitalism.]{.underline}

[Putin's approval rating is high, but it has declined over the past
year.]{.underline} The decline is mainly related to domestic policy.
Apparently, the [public perceives recent Kremlin economic policy as a
continuation of the disastrous policies that Washington imposed on
Russia in the 1990s when Russia was loaded up with foreign debt while
state assets were privatized and plundered by oligarchs sponsored by the
West who "cashed out" by selling the assets to foreigners.]{.underline}
The approval rating of Putin and the government dropped in response to
the recent increases in the retirement age and value added tax. The
former raised concerns about pension security and reminded Russians of
the collapse of Soviet pensions. The latter reduced consumer disposable
income and lowered consumer demand and the economic growth rate. [These
policies represent austerity imposed on the domestic population instead
of on foreign creditors and reflect the neoliberal view that austerity
leads to prosperity.]{.underline} R[ussia is experiencing **capital
outflows** due to the Russian private sector's repayment of loans to
Western creditors]{.underline}. Russia [has experienced over \$25
billion a year of capital outflows since the early 1990s, accumulating
to over a trillion dollars]{.underline}. This money could have been
invested in Russia itself to raise the productivity and living standards
of its citizens. The outflow puts the ruble under pressure, and the
interest payments draw money out of the country away from Russian uses.
[If it were not for these outflows, the value of the ruble and Russian
wages would be higher.]{.underline} The US sanctions give Russians every
reason not to repay their foreign loans; yet Russians continue to enable
their own exploitation by foreigners, as neoliberal economists have told
them that there is no alternative. [Russia's economic problems are due
to the looting of the country during the Yeltsin years, to the
imposition of neoliberal economics by the Americans, and to
financialization as a result of the privatizations.]{.underline}
Russia's stock market became the darling of the West in the mid-1990s as
underpriced mining, oil and infrastructure were sold for a fraction of
their value to foreigners, thus transferring Russian income streams
abroad instead of leaving the income to be invested in Russia. [In
effect, Russians were told that the way for their country to get rich
was to let kleptocrats, oligarchs, and their U.S. and British stock
brokers make hundreds of billions of dollars by privatizing Russia's
public domain.]{.underline} Washington took advantage of the gullible
and trusting Yeltsin government to do as much political and economic
damage as possible to Russia. The country was torn apart. Historic parts
of Russia such as Ukraine were split off into separate countries.
Washington even insisted that Crimea, long a part of Russia and the
country's warm water port, was retained by Ukraine when the Soviet Union
was dismembered. [People's savings (called the "overhang") were wiped
out with hyperinflation. Privatization was not accompanied by new
investment. The **economy was not industrialized, but financialized**.
The]{.underline} proceeds from privatization were deposited by the
Russian government in private banks where the money was used to
privatize more Russian assets. The banking system thus served to finance
the transfer of ownership, not to fund new investment, and the proceeds
were transferred abroad[. Russia was **turned into a financial colony**
in which proconsuls created wealth at the top.]{.underline} Today
privatization continues in the de facto privatization of public assets,
such as charging fees for use of federal highways. As the [Russian
economic profession has been brainwashed by the Americans, the **country
is devoid of economic leadership.**]{.underline} We have pointed out on
more than one occasion that it is nonsensical for Russia to indebt
itself by borrowing abroad in order to finance investments. The Russians
were sold a bill of goods that the central bank cannot issue rubles
unless the rubles are backed by dollars. This advice served to prevent
Russia from using its own central bank to fund public infrastructure and
private investment projects by issuing rubles. In other words, Russia
might as well not have a central bank. Apparently, Russian economists do
not understand that Russia does not spend borrowed foreign currencies
inside Russia. If Russia takes a foreign loan, the borrowed money goes
into central bank reserves. The central bank then issues the ruble
equivalent to be spent on the project, and the cost of the project goes
up by the pointless interest paid to the foreign lender. As far as we
can tell, the Institute of Economics of the Russian Academy of Sciences
is so brainwashed by neoliberal economics that their minds are closed to
correct policies. [The failure of Russian economic leadership imposes
far more costs on the Russian economy than do Washington's
sanctions.]{.underline} [Intellectual leadership is weak with many in
the intellectual class favoring integration with the West rather than
with the East. To be part of the West has been an important goal since
Peter the First and Catherine the Great, and the Russian Atlanticist
Integrationists cannot let go of the ancient goal.]{.underline} This
goal no longer makes sense. Not only does it imply Russian vassalage,
but also Europe is no longer the center of power. The East is rising,
and China is the center and will be until the Chinese destroy themselves
by copying the Western neoliberal policy of financializing the economy.
Although Putin is a leader and has a sense of Russian purpose, many
officials use their office not in service to Russia but in service to
their own wealth, much of which is held abroad. Corruption and
embezzlement seem to be the purpose of many office holders. Scandals
abound among members of government and reflect badly on Putin and
Medvedev. The Russian government's popularity was at a peak when the
government showed it had the intelligence and will to reincorporate
Crimea into Russia. However, the Russian government, hoping to reassure
Washington and Europe, refused the requests of the Luhansk and Donetsk
republics to be reincorporated into Russia. Russian nationalists, the
majority of the population, saw this as kowtowing to the West. Moreover,
the Russian government's decision has resulted in Ukraine's ongoing
military assault on the breakaway republics and to the arming of Ukraine
by the West. Instead of acting decisively, the Russian government
enabled the continuation of conflict that can be exploited by
Washington. The Russian people understand this even if the government
does not. [By failing to show firmness, the Russian government
encourages the crony system of oligarchs who want a government that they
can use for their narrow interests. Their interests include
participating in the system of Western plunder known as
"globalism]{.underline}." These client elites of the West oppose a
powerful Russian state that could assert itself on the world stage and
offer an alternative policy to the West's policy of plunder. The
influence of this narrow interest group on government policy indicates
that the Russian government is compromised. Putin is trying to break
free of the West's grip by directing Russia's economic orientation to
the East. His effort is helped by the American sanctions. But [Russia
remains sufficiently mired in the Western system to **be vulnerable to
sanctions** and is only slowly extracting itself.]{.underline} Various
aspects of Russia's difficulties and transformation into a power with a
foot in both West and East are discussed by commentators. [What goes
unacknowledged is that **Russian economic policy is
constrained**---indeed, crippled---by the **neoliberal brainwashing
given to Russian economists** by the Americans in the
1990s.]{.underline} Consequently, Russia is enfeebled by an economic
policy that encourages privatization and foreign ownership, and by
financialization of economic rents, that is, of income streams that do
not result from productive investment but from such factors as location
and rise in value due to public infrastructure development, such as a
road built across a property. In a financialized economy credit is used
to transfer property ownership instead of to finance new plant and
equipment and construction of infrastructure. [The Russian government
and central bank have been blinded to the fact that Russian
infrastructure projects and private investment are not dependent on
borrowing dollars abroad or by acquiring dollars by selling Russian
assets to foreigners.]{.underline} Such projects can be financed by
ruble creation by the Russian central bank. [Money that flows into
productive projects that raise output is not inflationary. Generally
speaking, such projects lower costs.]{.underline} For Russia to succeed,
Russia needs an economic re-education and a government that finds its
footing in Russian nationalism and discourages Western provocations with
firmer responses. It is our view that [the Western world]{.underline},
indeed all of life, h[as an interest in a Russia too strong to be
attacked or provoked as a strong Russia is the only way to curtail the
Western aggression that is l**eading to nuclear war.**]{.underline}

[Capitalism is not just an economic system; its effects extend to
politics and]{.underline}

[together they are a **dangerous combination**.]{.underline} Global
wealth continues to be reduced to a

handful of people in the world, and they hold the power to decide our
laws and policies,

as was seen throughout the case studies. [More importantly, it is not a
sustainable or]{.underline}

[successful system because it rests on the exploitation of the many to
benefit a select]{.underline}

[few. It is another form of imperialism and has been weaponized by
powerful states to]{.underline}

[establish their hegemony in the world order.]{.underline} Freedom and
capitalism cannot coexist

because in order for profits to be gained, many have to submit to
oppression. Friedman's

theory that free market capitalism equates to freedom was proven false
throughout the

demonstrations of violence observed in the case studies. [Furthermore,
the case studies]{.underline}

[proved that capitalism cannot exist without the **support of

[**leading cause for wars and conflicts** throughout the continents: it
requires oppressive]{.underline}

[regimes because its nature rests on exploitation.]{.underline}

#### Capitalism is inherently tied to violent conflict -- the shift towards socialism is a prerequisite to anti-war movements and sentiment

**ICFI '16** (Statement of the International Committee of the Fourth
International - World Party of Socialist Revolution, Its aim is to unite
the international working class, on the basis of a socialist and
internationalist program, to put an end to the capitalist system and
establish socialism on a world scale; "Socialism and the Fight Against
War"; 18 February 2016; World Socialist Web Site \[WSWS\];
https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2016/02/18/icfi-f18.html; Accessed

But the drive to World War III must be stopped. [A new international
movement against war, uniting the great mass of working people and youth
in opposition to capitalism and imperialism, must be built.]{.underline}
The same capitalist crisis that produces the insanity of war also
generates the impulse for social revolution. However, the growing anger
and opposition of billions of people around the world---to war, social
inequality and the assault on democratic rights---must be guided by a
new political perspective and program. With this statement, the
International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI) advances the
following principles as the essential political foundations of an
anti-war movement: The struggle against war must be based on the working
class, the great revolutionary force in society, uniting behind it all
progressive elements in the population. The new [**anti-war movement
must be** anti-capitalist and **socialist**, since there can be no
serious struggle against war except in the fight to end the dictatorship
of finance capital and the economic system that is the fundamental cause
of militarism and war.]{.underline} The new anti-war movement must
therefore, of necessity, be [completely and unequivocally **independent
of**, and hostile to, **all** political parties and **organizations of
the capitalist class**]{.underline}. The new anti-war movement must,
above all, be international, mobilizing the vast power of the working
class in a unified global struggle against imperialism. The permanent
war of the bourgeoisie must be answered with the perspective of
permanent revolution by the working class, the strategic goal of which
is the abolition of the nation-state system and the establishment of a
world socialist federation. This will make possible the rational,
planned development of global resources and, on this basis, the
eradication of poverty and the raising of human culture to new heights.
The Contradictions of World Economy and the Nation-State 9. The working
class requires a scientific understanding of the objective roots of war
if it is not to be misled and confused by chauvinist propaganda. The
political perspective of a socialist and internationalist anti-war
movement must be based on a precise assessment of the economic and class
interests that underlie imperialist strategies and great power
conflicts. Only on this basis can the working class develop its
independent program of irreconcilable opposition to the "national
interests" promoted by the ruling elites of every country as
justification for war.[**The essential cause of militarism and war lies
in the** deep-seated contradictions of the world **capitalist
system**]{.underline}: 1) between a globally integrated and
interdependent economy and its division into antagonistic national
states; and 2) between the socialized character of global production and
its subordination, through the private ownership of the means of
production, to the accumulation of private profit by the ruling
capitalist class. Powerful consortia of capitalist banks and
corporations utilize "their" state to wage a commercial and ultimately
military struggle for control of the raw materials, oil and gas
pipelines, trade routes and access to cheap labor and markets that are
critical to the accumulation of profit. The drive to war is centered in
the efforts of the United States to maintain its position as the global
hegemonic power. The dissolution in 1991 of the Soviet Union was seen as
an opportunity to assert unrivaled US domination throughout the world.
It was glorified by imperialist propagandists as the "end of history,"
creating a "unipolar moment" in which the unchallengeable power of the
United States would dictate a "New World Order" in the interests of Wall
Street. The Soviet Union had encompassed a vast expanse of the globe,
stretching from the eastern boundaries of Europe all the way to the
Pacific Ocean. Thus, the vast regions of Eurasia, occupied by a
debilitated Russia and newly independent Central Asian states, were
again "in play," open for corporate exploitation and plunder. The
Stalinist restoration of capitalism in China, its police-state
repression of working class resistance in 1989 and the opening up of
"free trade zones" to transnational investment made available a vast
reservoir of cheap labor. The victory of the US and its allies in the
Gulf War of 1991 against Iraq was invoked by the ruling classes
internationally to legitimize war as the most effective instrument of
foreign policy. The Wall Street Journal proclaimed: "Force works!" One
year later, the Pentagon adopted a defense strategy document which
stated that the objective of the US was to militarily "discourage
advanced industrial nations from challenging our leadership or even
aspiring to a larger regional or global role." Twenty-five years of
unending war, however, have failed either to counter the decline of
American capitalism or create a new stable foundation for global
relations. Rather, the United States---riven by intractable internal
crises and armed to the teeth---has been transformed into the greatest
source of international instability. The drive to create a "New World
Order" has succeeded only in fomenting global disorder. Every war
launched by the United States has resulted in unforeseen and disastrous
complications. The Geopolitics of Imperialism 14. The relentless and
far-flung operations of US intelligence agencies are the practical
expression of the fact that no part of the globe is outside the interest
of American capitalism. [Every continent and every country is viewed
through the prism of US imperialism's economic and geopolitical
interests. The American ruling class is focused on developing a strategy
to counter every real and potential challenge.]{.underline}

#### Capitalism is the root cause of war

Latin American studies at UC Santa Barbara, 4-24-22, \"Global Capitalism

Militarized Accumulation

The Russian invasion --- brutal, reckless and condemnable by any
standard --- has sparked debate on NATO's proposed expansion into
Ukraine and the role that it played in motivating the Kremlin. U.S.
officials were keenly aware, in fact, that [the drive to **expand NATO**
to Russian borders would eventually push Moscow into a **military
conflict**]{.underline}. "We examine a wide range of nonviolent measures
that could exploit Russia's actual vulnerabilities and anxieties as a
way of stressing Russia's military and economy and the regime's
political standing at home and abroad," notes a 2019 study by the RAND
Corporation, a Pentagon-affiliated think tank. "The steps we examine
would not have either defense or deterrence as their prime purpose," it
states, but rather, "these steps are conceived of as elements in a
campaign designed to unbalance the adversary, leading Russia to compete
in domains or regions where the United States has a competitive
advantage, and causing Russia to overextend itself militarily or
economically."

But the provocation could not be reduced to geopolitical competition,
however important, as most observers were keen to do.
[Missing]{.underline} from the larger picture [was the centrality of
**militarized accumulation**]{.underline} [--- of endless low- and
high-intensity warfare, simmering conflicts, civil strife and policing
--- to the **global political economy**]{.underline}. Militarized
accumulation refers to a situation in which [a global war economy relies
on the state to **organize war-making**, **social control and
repression** to **sustain capital accumulation**]{.underline} [in the
face of **chronic stagnation**]{.underline} [and **saturation of global
markets**]{.underline}. [These]{.underline} state-organized [practices
are outsourced]{.underline} to transnational corporate capital,
[involving the fusion of private accumulation with state militarization
in order to sustain the process of capital accumulation. Cycles of
destruction and reconstruction provide **ongoing outlets for
over-accumulated capital**]{.underline}; that is, [these cycles open up
**new profit-making opportunities**]{.underline} for transnational
capitalists seeking ongoing opportunities to profitably reinvest the
enormous amounts of cash they have accumulated. [There is a convergence
in this process of global capitalism's political **need for social
control** and **repression**]{.underline} [in the face of **mounting
popular discontent worldwide**]{.underline} [and its economic need to
perpetuate accumulation in the face of stagnation]{.underline}.

[Wars provide **critical economic stimulus**]{.underline}. [They
have]{.underline} historically [pulled the capitalist system **out of
accumulation crises** while they serve to deflect attention from
political tensions and problems of legitimacy]{.underline}. It took
**[World War II]{.underline}** [to finally lift world capitalism out of
the]{.underline} Great [Depression. **The Cold War**]{.underline}
[legitimated a half century of expanding military budgets]{.underline}
and the Iraq/Afghanistan wars, the longest in history, helped keep the
economy sputtering along in the face of chronic stagnation in the first
two decades of the century. [From the]{.underline} anti-Communist fervor
of the [Cold War, to the "war on terror," then the]{.underline}
so-called [New Cold War, and now]{.underline} the Russian invasion of
[Ukraine, the transnational elite]{.underline}, led by Washington, [have
had to conjure **up one enemy after another**]{.underline} [to
**legitimate militarized accumulation**]{.underline} [and **deflect
crises of state legitimacy and capitalist hegemony**]{.underline} [onto
**external enemies**]{.underline} [and **contrived
threats**]{.underline}.

The events of [September 11]{.underline}, 2001, marked the
[start]{.underline} of an era of a **[permanent global
war]{.underline}** [in which logistics, warfare, intelligence,
repression, surveillance and even military personnel are more and more
the **privatized domain of transnational capita**]{.underline}l. The
Pentagon budget increased 91 percent in real terms between 1998 and
2011, while worldwide, [total state military budget outlays grew by 50
percent]{.underline} from 2006 to 2015, from \$1.4 trillion to more than
\$2 trillion. (This figure does not take into account the hundreds of
billions of dollars spent on intelligence; contingency operations;
policing; bogus wars against immigrants, terrorism and drugs; and
"homeland security.") During this time, [military-industrial complex
profits **quadrupled**]{.underline}.

However, focusing just on state military budgets only gives us a part of
the picture of the global war economy. As I showed in my 2020 book, The
Global Police State, [the various wars, conflicts and campaigns of
social control and repression around the world involve the **fusion of
private accumulation with state militarization**]{.underline}. In this
relationship, the [state facilitates the expansion of opportunities for
private capital to **accumulate through militarization**]{.underline},
such as by [facilitating global weapons sales by
military-industrial-security firms, the amounts of which have reached
unprecedented leve]{.underline}ls. Global weapons sales by the top 100
weapons manufacturers and military service companies increased by 38
percent between 2002 and 2016 and can be expected to escalate further in
the face of a prolonged war in Ukraine.

Said one consultant to Boeing, General Dynamics, Lockheed Martin and
Raytheon Technologies: "For the defense industry, **[happy days are here
again]{.underline}**.

By 2018, private for-profit military companies employed some 15 million
people around the world, while another 20 million people worked in
private security worldwide. The private security (policing) business is
one of the fastest-growing economic sectors in many countries and has
come to dwarf public security around the world. The amount spent on
private security in 2003, the year of the invasion of Iraq, was 73
percent higher than that spent in the public sphere, and three times as
many persons were employed in private forces as in official law
enforcement agencies. In half of the world's countries, private security
agents outnumber police officers.

These corporate soldiers and police were deployed to guard corporate
property, provide personal security for executives and their families;
collect data; conduct police, paramilitary, counterinsurgency and
surveillance operations; carry out mass crowd control and repression of
protesters; run private detention and interrogation facilities; manage
prisons and participate in outright warfare. Now, these same private
military and security firms are pouring into Ukraine, with some
mercenary companies offering between \$1,000 and \$2,000 a day for those
with combat experience.

The Russian invasion has accelerated but did not originate the ongoing
surge in military spending around the world. It is notable that state
military spending worldwide skyrocketed in the wake of the 2008 global
financial collapse even beyond the post-9/11 spending hike, rising from
about \$1.5 billion in 2008 to over \$2 trillion in 2022. The fact that
this explosion in spending coincides perfectly with continued worldwide
stagnation following the Great Recession suggests that the heightened
militarization of the global economy is as much or more a response to
this chronic stagnation than to perceived security threats. If bursts of
militarized accumulation (such as that unleashed by 9/11, then by the
2008 financial collapse, and now by the Russian invasion) help offset
the overaccumulation crisis further into the future, they are also
high-risk bets that heighten worldwide tensions and push the world
dangerously towards all-out international conflagration.

The Crisis of Global Capitalism

[This crisis of global capitalism is **economic**]{.underline}, or
structural, [one of **chronic stagnation in the global
economy**]{.underline}. But [it is also **political**: a crisis of
**state legitimacy**]{.underline} [and **capitalist hegemony**. The
system is moving towards "a **general crisis**]{.underline} of
capitalist rule" [as billions of people around the world face
**uncertain struggles for survival**]{.underline} [and question a system
they no **longer see as legitimate**. Historically,]{.underline} [wars
have pulled the capitalist system **out of crisis**]{.underline} while
they serve to deflect attention from political tensions and problems of
legitimacy.

Economically, [global capitalism faces]{.underline} what is known in
technical language as "**[overaccumulation]{.underline}**": a situation
in which [the economy has produced]{.underline} --- or has the capacity
to produce --- [great quantities of wealth but the market **cannot
absorb this**]{.underline} wealth because of escalating inequality.
[Capitalism by its very nature will produce abundant wealth yet polarize
that wealth and generate ever **greater levels of social
inequality**]{.underline} unless offset by redistributive policies. [The
level of global social polarization and inequality]{.underline} now
experienced [is **without precedent**]{.underline}. In 2018, the richest
1 percent of humanity controlled more than half of the world's wealth
while the bottom 80 percent had to make do with just 5 percent. The
international development agency Oxfam reported in January that during
the first two years of the coronavirus pandemic, the 10 richest men in
the world more than doubled their fortunes, from \$700 billion to \$1.5
trillion, while 99 percent of humanity saw a fall in their income and
160 million more people fell into poverty.

Such [inequalities end up **undermining the stability of the
system**]{.underline} as the gap grows between what is --- or could be
--- produced and what the market can absorb. [The]{.underline} extreme
[concentration]{.underline} of the planet's wealth in the hands of the
few and the accelerated impoverishment and dispossession of the majority
means that [the transnational capitalist class]{.underline}, or TCC,
[has increasing difficulty in finding productive outlets to unload
enormous amounts of surplus it accumulated.]{.underline} In the years
leading up to the pandemic, there was a steady rise in underutilized
capacity and a slowdown in industrial production around the world. The
surplus of accumulated capital with nowhere to go expanded rapidly.
Transnational corporations recorded record profits during the 2010s at
the same time that corporate investment declined. Along with militarized
accumulation, [the TCC has turned to unprecedented levels of **financial
speculation**]{.underline} and to debt-driven growth to sustain
profit-making in the face of the crisis. If left unchecked,
[overaccumulation results in **crisis**]{.underline} --- in stagnation,
recessions, [**depressions**, **social upheavals**]{.underline} [and
**war**]{.underline} --- [just what **we are experiencing**]{.underline}
right now.

But [there is a related dynamic at work]{.underline} in the global war
economy: [the need for dominant groups to **suppress mass
discontent**]{.underline} [and **deflect the crisis of state
legitimacy**. International frictions **escalate** as
states]{.underline}, in their efforts to retain legitimacy, [seek to
**sublimate social and political tensions**]{.underline} [and to **keep
the social order from fracturing**]{.underline}. All around the world, a
"[people's Spring]{.underline}" has taken off. [From Chile to Lebanon,
Iraq to India, France to the United States, Haiti to Nigeria, South
Africa to Colombia, Jordan to Sri Lanka, waves of strikes and mass
protests have **proliferated**]{.underline} and, in some instances,
[appear to be acquiring **an anti-capitalist character**. Wars and
external enemies allow the ruling groups to **deflect attention
away**]{.underline} from domestic malaise in their effort to maintain a
grip on power as the crisis deepens.

In the U.S., this [sublimation]{.underline} has [involved efforts to
channel social unrest towards **scapegoated communities**]{.underline}
such as immigrants or other marginalized groups --- this is [one **key
function of racism**]{.underline} [and was a core component of the
Trump]{.underline} government's political strategy --- [or]{.underline}
towards an external enemy such as [**China** or **Russia**]{.underline},
which had clearly become [a cornerstone of the Biden]{.underline}
government['s strategy well before]{.underline} the Russian invasion of
[Ukraine]{.underline}. U.S. presidents historically reach their highest
approval ratings when they launch wars. George W. [Bush reached an
all-time-high of 90 percent in 2001 as his administration geared up to
invade Afghanistan]{.underline}, and his father George H.W. Bush
achieved an 89 percent approval rating in 1991, right as the U.S.
declared the end of its (first) invasion of Iraq and the "liberation of
Kuwait."

[It is **unlikely**]{.underline} that [an increasing
militarization]{.underline} of the world economy [can]{.underline} in
the long run [offset either the economic or the political dimensions of
the crisis]{.underline} of global capitalism. [Global capitalism is
emerging from]{.underline} the [coronavirus]{.underline} pandemic [with
**more inequality**, **more authoritarianism**, more **militarization**,
and more **civic and political strife**]{.underline}. In the U.S.,
[class struggle is **heating up**, with a wave of strikes and of
unionization drives]{.underline} in Amazon, Starbucks, and elsewhere in
the gig economy. [The current **inflationary spiral** and the
**escalation of class struggle**]{.underline} in the United States [and
around the world point to the **inability of the ruling groups to
contain the expanding crisis**. The drive]{.underline} by the capitalist
state [to externalize the political fallout]{.underline} of the crisis
[increases the danger that **international tensions**]{.underline} [and
**localized conflicts**]{.underline} such as in Ukraine [will
**snowball**]{.underline} [into broader **international conflagrations
of unforeseen consequences**]{.underline}.

As the Ukraine crisis continues to drag on and the global revolt
escalates, [there will be a **radical reconfiguration of global
geopolitical alignments**]{.underline} [to the drumbeat of **escalating
turbulence**]{.underline} in the world economy [that will feed new
**political upheavals** and **violent conflicts**, making global
capitalism **all the more volatile**]{.underline}. While it is hard to
imagine a return to the status quo antebellum in Eastern Europe, in the
larger picture, the [Ukraine]{.underline} crisis [is not the cause but a
consequence of the **general crisis of global capitalism**.
That]{.underline} crisis [will **only get worse**. **Fasten your seat
belts**]{.underline}; it will get much worse.

### Sustainability Shelf

#### Capitalism creates artificial scarcity that can [never be solved.]{.underline} 

**Hickel '18**, 10-27-2018, \"Degrowth: A Call for Radical Abundance ---
Jason Hickel,\" Jason Hickel,
https://www.jasonhickel.org/blog/2018/10/27/degrowth-a-call-for-radical-abundance

**[Scarcity is the engine of capitalist expansion.]{.underline}**

[And, crucially, the scarcity was artificially created.  Created **by
elite accumulation**, backed up by state violence.]{.underline}  In both
England and South Africa, there was no actual scarcity.  The same land
and forests and resources remained, just as they had always been.  But
they were locked up.  Enclosed[.  In order to regain access to the means
of survival, people had no choice but to participate]{.underline} in the
juggernaut. 

Today, we feel the force of scarcity in the constant threat of
unemployment.  We must be ever-more productive at work or else lose our
jobs to someone who will be more productive than we are.  [But there is
a paradox: as productivity rises, less labour is needed.  So workers get
laid off and find themselves with no means of survival.  Victims of
artificial scarcity.]{.underline}  And the state, desperate to reduce
unemployment, must then find ways to grow the economy in order to create
new jobs, just so that people can survive. 

[Even people who are concerned about ecological breakdown, which is most
of us, are forced to submit to this logic: if you care about human
lives, then you must call for growth]{.underline}.  We can deal with the
environment later.

[But there will be no later, because the problem of scarcity is never
solved.]{.underline}  Whenever scarcity is about to be solved, it is
always quickly produced anew.  Think about it: for 150 years, economists
have predicted that "In the very near future our economy will be so
productive and replete that we will all have to work no more than a few
hours a day."  But the prediction never comes true.  [Because capitalism
transforms even the most spectacular productivity gains not into
abundance and human freedom, but into scarcity. ]{.underline}

#### Capitalism is [unsustainable]{.underline}. That enables a slew of [existential]{.underline} societal and environmental downsides including [climate change]{.underline}, [inequality]{.underline}, [resource wars]{.underline}, [food insecurity]{.underline}, [fungal pathogens]{.underline}, [pandemics]{.underline}, and [others]{.underline}.

2020 than it did for the period 2001 and 2010 (7),
**[animal]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[plant
extinctions]{.underline}** projected to increase 2- to 5-fold in coming
decades (8), **[deepening genetic diversity loss]{.underline}** (9),
[and a]{.underline} weakened global **[ecosystem]{.underline}** (10)
[pushed to its breaking point]{.underline} (11).

Scientists suspect the last several years have been warmer than any
point in more than 125,000 years (12). Yet demand for oil climbed to
over 100 million barrels per day in 2023, the highest in history (13).
[Despite]{.underline} decades of global **[investment in clean
energy]{.underline}** (14), [fossil fuels]{.underline} still
[provide]{.underline} **[over 80%]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} global
[energy use]{.underline} (15), a figure that has not changed for
decades. [In the]{.underline} **[absence of]{.underline}** climate
**[action]{.underline}**, our world is on [course]{.underline} (16) [to
heat a blistering]{.underline} **[3°C]{.underline}**, perhaps more (17),
potentially [displacing]{.underline} one-third of
**[humanity]{.underline}** (18).

One study (19) suggests that ∼9% of people (\>600 million) already live
outside the human climate "niche." Another concludes that, compared with
people born in 1960, children born today will experience 7.5 times as
many heatwaves, 3.6 times as many droughts, 3 times as many crop
failures, 2.8 times as many river floods, and 2 times as many wildfires
(20). Studies (21) forecast climate-related extinction of 14--32% of
macroscopic species in the next ∼50 years, including 3--6 million animal
and plant species, even under intermediate climate change scenarios.
With continued warming, the frequency of wildfires will increase over
74% of the global landmass by the end of this century (22). Such
assessments are conservative as they are based on projections from
climate models that may not capture some important processes through
which human-caused heating amplifies persistent weather extremes (23,
24).

Of the 40 leading economies, all of which agreed in the 2015 Paris
Climate Accord to take all necessary actions to stop global heating
below 1.5°C, not one nation is on track to do what they promised (25).
Globally, current climate policies are incompatible with limiting global
heating to 1.5°C (26). The remaining budget for a 50% chance of keeping
warming to 1.5°C is approximately 250 GtCO2 as of January 2023, now
equal to around 6 years of current emissions (27). The [energy plans of
countries]{.underline} **[responsible]{.underline}** [for the largest
GHG emissions would lead to]{.underline} **[460% more
coal]{.underline}** production, **[83% more natural gas]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[29% more oil]{.underline}** in 2030 [than
is]{.underline} **[compatible]{.underline}** [with limiting global
heating to 1.5°C, and]{.underline} 69% more fossil fuels than is
compatible with [the riskier 2°C target]{.underline} (28).

The **[market cost]{.underline}** of [oil, coal, and natural gas is
distorted by]{.underline} **[subsidies]{.underline}** [and does
not]{.underline} **[include negative externalities]{.underline}**
[related to pollution, climate change, healthcare, and
others]{.underline} (29). Worse, [the]{.underline} **[false
promise]{.underline}** (30) [and]{.underline} widespread
**[allure]{.underline}** [of unregulated quick fixes, such as "net-zero"
contracts]{.underline} that lack monitoring, auditing, and verification,
[threaten to derail even the best-intentioned commercial and
governmental plans for climate stabilization]{.underline} (31).
Investigations suggest that the great majority of products transacted on
carbon offset markets remove very little GHG from the atmosphere (32),
and models indicate that even direct removal of atmospheric CO2 does not
recover former environmental conditions crucial to food and water
security or ecosystem restoration (33).

We do not promote a "doom and gloom" philosophy regarding the future of
human civilization. We are optimistic that humanity can correct the
unsustainable pathway that we are on. Later in this review, we describe
necessary steps in this direction. However, we do take an objective and
realistic stand on the issue of sustainability. The realities described
here quantify a severe and immediate threat to human health and
well-being. They emphasize the imperative for a rapid, sweeping
reduction in GHG emissions, and highlight stubborn barriers that impede
progress. Developed nations, emerging economies, and commercial entities
must invest in rapid decarbonization; correct market distortions
favoring fossil fuels; and avoid the spurious trap of false "net-zero"
offsets as an excuse to continue polluting the atmosphere.

Imperialism, overpopulation, and resource extraction

Around the world, a growing number of entities and environmental
activists are taking action (34). As of December 2022, there have been
2,180 climate-related legal cases filed in 65 jurisdictions, including
international and regional courts, tribunals, quasijudicial bodies, or
other adjudicatory bodies. Lawsuits related to climate change have more
than doubled over the last 5 years as litigants see courts as a way to
enhance (or delay) climate action (35). Children and youth, women's
groups, local communities, and Indigenous Peoples, among others, are
taking a prominent role in bringing these cases and driving climate
change governance reform around the world. This "climate justice
movement" seeks to extend the principles of human rights and
environmental justice by arguing that future generations have a
birthright to a safe climate capable of sustaining genuine human
development on a healthy and resilient planet (36).

Yet, for hundreds of years, various [manifestations of]{.underline}
**[imperialism]{.underline}**, such as slavery, settler colonization,
economic and cultural dominance, neocolonialism (37), [and
the]{.underline} **[forces of globalization]{.underline}**, [have
promoted a]{.underline} **[mindset of class privilege]{.underline}** and
wealth. [Motivated by]{.underline} **[profit]{.underline}**, [the
mechanisms of]{.underline} **[industrial capitalism]{.underline}** have
[pursued]{.underline} **[relentless resource depletion]{.underline}**
[achieved by subjugation of local communities]{.underline}, erasure of
Indigenous knowledge, [and unsustainable plunder of the natural
world]{.underline} (38).

Modern imperialism is embodied by industrial capitalism, which
[prioritizes]{.underline} **[resource extraction]{.underline}** and
maximizing profit. This [paradigm is]{.underline}
**[deeply]{.underline}** [embedded in the fabric of global
affairs]{.underline}, **[influencing]{.underline}** international
**[trade]{.underline}**, **[political dynamics]{.underline}**, [and
the]{.underline} **[economic frameworks]{.underline}** [of
nations]{.underline} (39). The [persistent reliance on]{.underline}
**[extractive]{.underline}** [economic practices continues to be
a]{.underline} **[significant obstacle]{.underline}** [to making
critical progress in decarbonization]{.underline}, conserving natural
resources, and ensuring social equity. For instance, despite decades of
international commitments to end deforestation, around 4.1 M hectares of
primary tropical rainforest was lost globally in 2022---an increase of
10% over 2021---producing 2.7 Gt of CO2 emissions, equivalent to the
annual fossil fuel emissions of India (40). Most modern socioeconomic
systems still follow extractive rules of exploitation and trade, and
ignore natural rates of resource renewal, [failing to
consider]{.underline} that [the end result is]{.underline}
**[catastrophic]{.underline}** (41).

Global population growth amplifies the damage wrought by industrial
capitalism. On 15 November 2022, the world's population reached 8
billion people. Human population is expected to increase by nearly 2
billion in the next 30 years, and could peak at nearly 10.4 billion in
the mid-2080s (42). Cambridge economist Sir Partha Dasgupta developed a
rigorous approach to the question "What is optimal human population?"
(43). His theory relates population, consumption, and resource capacity,
concluding that an optimal global population lies between 0.5 and 5
billion. This theory implies that Earth is already overpopulated
relative to ecological carrying capacity. With every additional person
added to the planet, wild habitats are disturbed or destroyed by
urbanism, agricultural activities, and resource consumption, with
humanity demanding more than what the biosphere can sustainably provide.

Dasgupta highlights the critical connection between our economies,
livelihoods, and well-being with the Earth's resources. He argues that
current global demand for natural resources surpasses its capacity to
supply, driven by factors like population growth and consumption
patterns. This overuse threatens biodiversity and ecosystem services. To
safeguard our prosperity and the environment, we must rethink our
approach to economic success. Key recommendations include increasing
nature's capacity and ensuring our demands on nature stay within
sustainable limits. This involves investing in natural capital, revising
economic metrics, transforming institutions (especially finance and
education), and empowering citizens. Legitimate sustainability is vital
for achieving a long-term balance between population, economic growth,
and the environment. Future generations' wellbeing hinges on how we
manage economic, social, and natural resources today. Urgent action is
required to address these interconnected challenges.

Given the current state of the ecosphere, a 25% increase in population
and projected doubling of economic activity by 2050 (44) may drive major
ecological regime shifts (i.e. forest to savannah, savannah to desert,
thawing tundra, and others) well before 2080. Nature may impose its own
population correction before standard projections are realized (45).
Actions to slow and reverse population growth are critical (46). These
include empowering women, investing in girls' education, strengthening
healthcare systems, and implementing social welfare programs that create
job opportunities, reduce poverty, and improve living standards.

Human population growth, increased economic demands, rising heat, and
extreme weather events put pressures on ecosystems and landscapes to
supply food and maintain services such as clean water. Studies show that
ecosystems threatened by sudden regime shifts are at greater risk of
collapse than previously thought (47). Researchers warn that more than a
fifth of ecosystems worldwide, including the Amazon rainforest, are at
risk of a catastrophic breakdown within a human lifetime.

The United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a suite of 17
objectives with 169 targets established in 2015 for achievement by 2030,
face a grim forecast: current trends suggest none of the goals and
merely 12% of the targets may be realized (48). This shortfall
underscores the urgent need to dismantle the entrenched model of
resource extraction and wealth concentration, advocating for a paradigm
shift toward genuine sustainability and resource regeneration. Such a
transformation is imperative to reverse the tide of biodiversity loss
due to overconsumption and to reinstate the security of food and water
supplies, which are foundational for the survival of global populations.

Global economics and values

Convergence of [worldwide trends threatens]{.underline} safe and
sustainable **[human development]{.underline}**: [accelerating impacts
from]{.underline} **[climate change]{.underline}** (49), **[biodiversity
loss]{.underline}** (50) caused by **[unsustainable
consumption]{.underline}** (51), **[extractive
agriculture]{.underline}**, natural **[resource
exploitation]{.underline}** (52) and limitations, emergent
**[disease]{.underline}** (53), pervasive pollution (54),
[and]{.underline} **[socioeconomic injustice]{.underline}** (55). [To
secure a]{.underline} **[safe future]{.underline}** for [humanity,
global economics and values must protect the]{.underline}
**[well-being]{.underline}** [of the natural]{.underline} world. This
requires understanding the impacts, intersections and feedbacks of these
global emergencies, as well as solutions to ensure a livable planet
(56). These emergencies, promulgated by extractive policies (57), human
population growth, and modern imperialism (58), overlap in ways that
amplify negative outcomes (Fig. 1). [If]{.underline} successive
[governments treat]{.underline} these [issues in]{.underline}
**[isolation]{.underline}**, hesitate, or formulate shallow responses,
[the]{.underline} **[fallout may be catastrophic]{.underline}**. Without
immediate action, [we risk entering a]{.underline}
**[malignant]{.underline}** [era of global distress and suffering
characterized by disease]{.underline}, thirst and [hunger,
impoverishment, and political instability]{.underline}.

The cocoon of wealth enjoyed by developed nations belies the suffering
and misery many low latitude and semiarid communities already endure in
tenuous heat and drought conditions. Consider the Northern Hemisphere
summer of 2023. Over 80% of the global population experienced climate
change-driven heat in the month of July (59) (Fig. 2). It featured 7
consecutive months of record-shattering global temperature driven by a
combination of a moderately strong El Niño and a decrease of Earth's
albedo (equivalent to an increase of atmospheric CO2 from 420 to 530
ppm) (60). Extreme heatwaves swept many parts of the world. Sea surface
temperatures leapt to record highs. Antarctic sea ice was far below
average. Record wildfires burned for months destroying tens of millions
of acres and produced continental-scale public health crises in air
quality, and tens of thousands of temperature records around the world
were broken. Without human-induced climate change these events would
have been extremely rare (61).

It is past time to build a new era of reciprocity with nature that
redefines natural resource economics. The ecological contributions of
Indigenous Peoples through their governance institutions and practices
are gaining recognition and interest. Indigenous systems of land
management encompass a holistic approach that values sacred, ethical,
and reciprocal relationships with nature, integrating traditional
knowledge and stewardship principles to sustainably manage land and
water resources. Indigenous land management challenges conventional
power structures and introduces innovative solutions to environmental
issues, especially in the context of climate change.

Indigenous Peoples exercise traditional rights over a quarter of Earth's
surface, overlapping with a third of intact forests and intersecting
about 40% of all terrestrial protected areas and ecologically intact
landscapes. These lands typically have reduced deforestation,
degradation, and carbon emissions, compared with nonprotected areas and
protected areas (62). Beyond western ideas of quarantining land for
conservation, Indigenous land management involves a mix of active land
management, biomimicry, and conservation to maximize nutrition, food and
water security, carbon sequestration, biodiversity, and ecosystem
restoration (63). These qualities offer beneficial feedbacks that
increase human health and resiliency, build social equity, and provide
for the needs of future generations.

We suggest that an Indigenous worldview, that of kinship with nature,
should define sustainable practices. Laws that establish legal rights
for nature have reached a critical point at which they may either be
normalized or marginalized (64); this progress must be sustained. For
instance, Māori in New Zealand have successfully asserted sovereignty to
grant legal personhood to the Whanganui River and Te Urewera National
Park. This reflects Māori worldviews and recognizes their governance,
allowing "nature" to have a legal voice. In the US, the Menominee Forest
Management Reserve, recognized as a best practice, is driven by the
Menominee vision and worldviews. It operates under the recognition of
Menominee sovereignty and decision-making authority.

Nations must build on these regenerative practices by eliminating
environmentally harmful subsidies (65), and restricting trade that
generates pollution and unsustainable consumption. Studies (66) indicate
the global economy must achieve absolute decoupling (in which resource
impacts decline in absolute terms) (67) if we are to eliminate
"ecological overshoot"a (68).

In the words of coauthor Jay Bowen, Upper Skagit Elder, "We are all
Indigenous to this Earth. We are one family." The authors of this review
believe that humanity stands at an inflection point in human history
that will determine many characteristics of future life on Earth (Fig.
3). Continued failure to integrate these problems in climate resilient
development and regenerative practices risks the stability of human
communities and natural systems. Heads of state must recognize the
existence of a global emergency (56), treat these crises as intertwined
issues, and apply the considerable power of the economy toward restoring
a livable planet and an equitable and just socioeconomic system before
climate instability and ecological regime shift are beyond our control.
Later in this paper, we offer specific suggestions for implementing
these changes.

Climate realities and the road to action

In April 2023, CO2 levels measured at Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawai'i
reached an annual peak of 424.8 ppm, more than 50% greater than the
preindustrial level of 278 ppm. In the first decade of measurement at
Mauna Loa (1959--1968), the average annual growth rate was 0.8 ppm per
year. The average annual growth rate over the most recent decade
(2014--2023) was 3 times that amount, 2.4 ppm per year, the fastest
sustained rate of increase in 65 years of monitoring (69).

More than half of all industrial CO2 emissions have occurred since 1988
and 40% of the CO2 we emit today will still be in the atmosphere in 100
years, about 20% will still be there in about 1,000 years (70). The last
time CO2 levels were this high was the Pliocene Climatic Optimum, 4.4
milion years ago, when Earth's climate was radically different; global
temperature was 2--3°C hotter, beech trees grew near the South Pole,
there was no Greenland ice sheet, no West Antarctic ice sheet, and
global sea level was as much as 25 m higher than today (71).

\[Figure omitted\]

Atmospheric methane (CH4) growth has surged since 2020. Averaged over 2
decades, the global heating potential of CH4 is 80 times greater than
CO2. The largest sources of atmospheric CH4 are wetlands, freshwater
areas, agriculture, fossil fuel extraction, landfills, and fires. In
2023, atmospheric CH4 exceeded 1,919 ppb, on track to triple the
preindustrial level of 700 ppb by 2030. Carbon isotopic signatures
reveal microbial decomposition of organic matter as the major source of
CH4 emissions, indicating that natural CH4-producing processes are being
amplified by climate change itself (72). Is this a sign that global
heating is shifting beyond our control?

\[Figure omitted\]

Under an intermediate scenario (SSP2-4.5), GHG emissions are very likely
to lead to heating of 1.2--1.8°C in the near term (2021-- 2040),
1.6--2.5°C in the midterm (2041--2060), and 2.1--3.5°C in the long term
(2081--2100) (73). As of November 2023, 145 countries had announced or
are considering net-zero targets, covering close to 90% of global
emissions (74). Among these are China, EU, USA, and India, who jointly
represent more than half of global GHG emissions. However, net-zero
evaluations for G20 countries and selected other countries as of
November 2023 show that most net-zero targets are formulated vaguely and
do not yet conform with good practices.

[Even as the]{.underline} vast majority of [countries pledged
to]{.underline} **[slash]{.underline}** their **[climate
emissions]{.underline}**, [their]{.underline} own [plans and projections
put them on track to]{.underline} **[extract more than
twice]{.underline}** [the level of fossil fuels]{.underline} **[by
2030]{.underline}** [than would be consistent with]{.underline}
**[limiting heating to 1.5°C]{.underline}**, [and nearly 70% more than
would be consistent with 2°C of heating]{.underline} (28). The world has
a 67% chance of limiting warming to 2.9°C if countries stick to the
nationally determined contributions (NDCs) made under the 2015 Paris
agreement (26). Emission cuts of 14 GtCO2 or 28% are needed by 2030 to
keep within 2°C of warming. A reduction of more than 40% or 22 GtCO2 is
needed for the 1.5°C threshold to be realistic.

The world now only has a 14% chance of limiting warming to the 1.5°C
goal, even if countries honor all NDCs. Limiting warming to 1.5°C would
require global emission reduction of 8.7% per year. Even with COVID-19
lockdowns limiting manufacturing, ground and air transportation, and
other economic activities during 2020, emissions dropped by only 4.7%
(26).

Many countries' [net-zero pledges "are]{.underline}
**[not]{.underline}** currently considered **[credible]{.underline}**"
(26). [No]{.underline} G20 [country is reducing emissions at a
pace]{.underline} **[consistent]{.underline}** [with their net-zero
targets]{.underline}. The lifetime emissions of current and planned oil
and gas fields and coal mines is 3 and a half times greater than the
carbon budget needed to hold temperature increase to 1.5°C. It would
exhaust almost all the budget needed for 2°C.

Under current national climate plans, emissions are expected to rise 9%
above 2010 levels by the end of this decade even if NDCs are fully
implemented. GHG emissions would fall to 2% below 2019 levels by 2030.
Although these numbers suggest the world will see emissions peak this
decade, that's still far short of the 43% reduction against 2019 levels
that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) says is needed
to stay within the 1.5°C target envisioned by the Paris Agreement (26).

Emission reductions of 43% are needed by 2030 to keep 1.5°C in play. But
since the 26th Conference of Parties (COP) in 2021, nations have shaved
just 1% off their projected emissions for 2030, and COP 28 in 2023 ended
with no increase in ambition. Seventy-five percent of nations that have
set targets to limit GHG emissions have enshrined them in law or policy
documents, but the plans needed to implement those pledges are lacking
in almost all cases (74), and policies based on "net-zero" actions no
longer have credibility. Current pledges would lead to long-term global
heating of 2.4--2.6°C, but on-the-ground policies put the world on track
for heating approximately 3°C above preindustrial levels. Avoiding
dangerous levels of heating requires systemic transformation to energy,
waste, transportation, agriculture, and industry.

Climate indicators show that global heating reached 1.14°C averaged over
the past decade, 1.26°C in 2022, and 1.45 ± 0.12°C over the 12-month
period of 2023. In 2023, some 7.3 billion people worldwide were exposed,
for at least 10 days, to temperatures influenced by global warming, with
one-quarter of people facing dangerous levels of extreme heat. Heating
is increasing at an unprecedented rate of over 0.2°C per decade (perhaps
faster) caused by a combination of annual GHG emissions at an all-time
high of 54 ± 5.3 GtCO2e over the last decade, and reductions in the
strength of aerosol cooling (17). The Northern Hemisphere summer of 2023
revealed a shift in climate indicators marking a new level of intensity.
"There has never been a summer like this in recorded history: shocking
ocean heat, deadly land heat, unprecedented fires and smoke, sea ice
melting faster than we've ever seen or thought possible (75)."

Climate outlook

Planned [cuts in global emissions are]{.underline}
**[inadequate]{.underline}** [for protecting human security
and]{.underline} Earth's remaining [biodiversity]{.underline}. Under
implemented national policies alone, dangerous heating is only avoidable
with a massive rollout of GHG removal technologies and large-scale
ecosystem restoration that is nowhere in evidence today. For instance,
even the planned investment of \$3.5B to develop four "direct air
capture" hubs under the 2022 US Bipartisan Infrastructure Law will only
remove the equivalent of 13 min of global emissions at full annual
capacity (30). Planting 8 billion trees, one for every person on Earth,
would remove the equivalent of only 43 h of global emissions after the
trees reached maturity decades from now, and the change in albedo
related to the new ground cover increases the complexity of expected
benefits.

The [only]{.underline} honest [strategy for today is]{.underline}
**[radical, immediate cuts]{.underline}** [in fossil fuel
use]{.underline}. Only after emissions have begun a rapid downward
trajectory should investments in [carbon removal]{.underline} (the
engineering for which has yet to be defined or validated) occur with
speed and at scale (76). Even this [will be met with]{.underline} ocean
**[outgassing of CO2]{.underline}** [such that climate recovery will see
a]{.underline} **[long]{.underline}** [delay]{.underline} (33).

This [urgency is underscored by the fact that]{.underline} **[current
emissions]{.underline}** [are]{.underline}
**[underreported]{.underline}**, [and decreasing]{.underline} **[natural
carbon storage]{.underline}** [makes]{.underline} limiting [global
temperatures]{.underline} even [more challenging]{.underline}. Global
emissions are as much as 3 times higher than reported (77) with 70%
underreporting of energy-related CH4 emissions alone (78). In addition,
[the terrestrial biome]{.underline}, which sequesters about 31% of
anthropogenic CO2 emissions, [has]{.underline} already neared, and in
places **[crossed]{.underline}**, [a]{.underline} photosynthetic
**[thermal maximum]{.underline}** [beyond which terrestrial carbon
storage will grow increasingly impossible]{.underline} (79). For
instance, global carbon loss from tropical forests has doubled in the
last 20 years (80), and the Brazilian portion of the Amazon Forest has
become a net GHG source (81). Eighty-three percent of tropical forest
carbon loss is driven by agriculture, suggesting that strategies to
reduce deforestation have failed, and that carbon emissions from forest
destruction are undercounted (82).

The United Nations estimates that 1.84 billion people worldwide, or
nearly a quarter of humanity, were living under drought in 2022 and
2023, the vast majority in low- and middle-income countries (83).
Megadrought projected for the year 2100 could strike up to 50 years
earlier according to models (84). Global heating risks food (85) and
water (86) availability with human populations in conditions of extreme
to exceptional drought (87) doubling by 2100 (88).

Climate change threatens natural ecosystems (89), human security (90),
livable conditions for communities (91), and the stability of 1/3 of the
human population (18). Under current levels of heating, people are 15
times more likely to die from extreme weather than in years past, and
3.3 billion human lives are "highly vulnerable" to climate change (92).
At 2°C heating, up to 3 billion people may suffer chronic water
scarcity. Today, 1 in 3 people are exposed to deadly heat stress. This
number is projected to increase up to 75% by the end of the century.

By 2050, over 300 million people living on coasts will be exposed to
flooding from sea level rise (93). Forced to migrate, the impacts of
these displaced communities will ripple through the larger population.
Climate change drives the spread of disease in people, crops,
domesticated animals, and wildlife. Even if heating is held below 1.6°C,
8% of today's farmland will be unfit to produce food. Declining food
production and nutrient losses will result in severe stunting affecting
1 million children in Africa alone and cause 183 million additional
people to go hungry by 2050 (92).

Abrupt change

Earth's [biophysical systems are shifting toward]{.underline}
**[instability]{.underline}** (94), [perhaps]{.underline}
**[irreversibly]{.underline}** (95). The [IPCC has
identified]{.underline} 15 [Earth system components with potential
for]{.underline} **[abrupt destabilizing change]{.underline}**,
[including]{.underline} **[ice]{.underline}**, **[ocean]{.underline}**,
and **[air circulation]{.underline}**; large
**[ecosystems]{.underline}**; [and]{.underline}
**[precipitation]{.underline}**. These [systems are the]{.underline}
**[pillars of life]{.underline}** [that permit stable]{.underline}
plant, animal, and microbial [communities]{.underline}, food production,
clean water [and establish the conditions for safe human
development]{.underline}. However, these [systems may be characterized
by]{.underline} **[threshold]{.underline}** [behavior]{.underline}. That
is, they appear to remain stable as global temperature rises, but at a
certain level of heating, [they may]{.underline} **["tip"
into]{.underline}** [a fundamentally irreversible new state]{.underline}
(96).

As Earth retains heat, [ice melt]{.underline}
**[accelerates]{.underline}** (97), [especially]{.underline} **[in the
Arctic]{.underline}** [which is heating]{.underline} nearly **[4 times
faster]{.underline}** [than the global average]{.underline} (98). Arctic
sea ice is declining (99), and [the]{.underline}
**[transition]{.underline}** [from a snow- to rain-dominated
Arctic]{.underline} in the summer and autumn [may occur]{.underline} as
early as 2040, with profound climatic, ecosystem, and socioeconomic
impacts (100). [The]{.underline} **[Greenland Ice Sheet]{.underline}**
[is]{.underline} **[vulnerable]{.underline}** [to ice loss due to
melt-elevation feedback]{.underline} (101), and Greenland [is losing
ice]{.underline} **[7 times faster]{.underline}** than in the 1990s
(102). Antarctic melting has tripled in the past 5 years (103), and ice
shelf collapse may lead to amplified sea level rise (104, 105).

According to one study, if temperatures rise by 1.5°C, the loss of four
biophysical systems will become "likely" and loss of an additional six
will be "possible." Loss of 13 biophysical systems will be either
"likely" or "possible" if the planet warms by 2.6°C, as expected under
current climate policies (94). Emerging changes such as deep ocean
heating (106), marine stratification (107), declining marine vertical
circulation (108), and sea level rise (109) will continue for centuries
even if net-zero emission targets are reached. The Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change Assessment Report 6, Working Group I (110)
projects possibly abrupt and irreversible change in permafrost carbon,
West Antarctic ice sheets and shelves, and ocean acidification and
deoxygenation. These [changes could]{.underline} **[unleash feedback
loops]{.underline}** that place climate impacts **[beyond]{.underline}**

The world's oceans face irreversible impacts from climate change, with
heating, acidification, stratification, and loss of dissolved oxygen
posing high costs for marine ecosystems (112). Ocean heating has
intensified (113), with the Southern Ocean taking up most of the excess
heat generated by anthropogenic activities (114). These changes affect
marine species distributions, interactions, abundance, and biomass.
Combined with other stressors like pollution, they are putting marine
biodiversity and its societal benefits at risk (115).

Amplified by global heating (116), marine biodiversity is being
decimated by more than 440,000 industrial fishing vessels around the
world that are responsible for 72% of the world's ocean catch. Over 35%
of the world's marine fishery stock is overfished and another 57% is
sustainably fished at the maximum level (117). One study showed that
more than 90% of the world's marine food supplies are at risk from
environmental changes such as rising temperatures and pollution,
essential to over 3.2 billion people. Top producers like China, Norway
and the United States face the biggest threat (118). Marine heatwaves
(119) are increasing with negative impacts on marine organisms and
ecosystems. Marine coastal biodiversity is at risk, with over 98% of
coral reefs projected to experience bleaching-level thermal stress by
2050 (120).

Relative to the period 1995--2014, global mean sea level is
conservatively projected to rise 0.15--0.29 m by 2050, and 0.28--1.01 m
by 2100 (109). Higher rise would ensue from disintegration of Antarctic
ice shelves and faster-than-projected ice melt from Greenland (121). On
multiple occasions over the past 3 million years, when temperatures
increased 1--2°C, global sea levels rose at least 6 m above present
levels (122). Sea level rise will flood toxic waste sites, cesspools and
septic systems, municipal dumps, and polluted groundwater. In many
cases, communities of color will be first to experience health impacts
(123).

Ocean pollution affects marine species and people who depend on them.
Toxic metals, plastics, manufactured chemicals, petroleum, urban and
industrial wastes, pesticides, fertilizers, pharmaceutical chemicals,
agricultural runoff, and sewage are the most detrimental and persistent
pollutants (124). More than 80% of marine pollutants originate from
land-based sources, reaching the oceans through rivers, runoff, and
atmospheric deposition. Pollution is heaviest in coastal waters,
especially in low- and middle-income countries (125).

Toxic metals such as mercury, lead, and cadmium accumulate in marine
animals, causing health problems in fish species and disrupting
endocrine systems in their human consumers (126). Plastics take hundreds
of years to degrade, breaking down into microplastics that are ingested
by fish, humans, and other organisms (127). Manufactured chemicals such
as polychlorinated biphenyls and dioxins are environmentally persistent
toxins that accumulate in the tissues of marine animals, disrupting
hormonal systems (128). Urban and agricultural runoff, and sewage
contain pathogens (129), heavy metals, and organic compounds that harm
marine animals and cause human health problems. Nitrogen pollution also
results in toxic algal blooms and oxygen-depleted dead zones (130). The
equity and justice implications of this massive problem have been
largely overlooked or downplayed (131).

Terrestrial biome

Tropical forests now emit more carbon than they are able to absorb from
the atmosphere as a result of the dual effects of deforestation and land
degradation (132). Rich-nation demand (133) for lumber, minerals, beef,
and animal feed outside their own borders undermine attempts to mitigate
climate change (134). Demand for food, feed, fiber, minerals, and energy
is resulting in whole forests being clear-cut. CO2 emissions from boreal
forest fires have reached a new high, producing nearly 1/4 of the total
global CO2 emissions from wildfires (135). Only 40% of remaining forests
have high ecosystem integrity (136). Forests are degraded (137) by
drought, pests, and wildfire related (138) to climate change. Forest
loss sacrifices soil biodiversity and integrity to oxidation,
dehydration, and heating, transforming soil into a persistent source of
CO2 emission (139). Only 2.9% of Earth's land remains ecologically
intact (140). Essential ecosystems are disappearing, and many species
are at risk of extinction (141). Anthropogenic extinction rates are
driving Earth's sixth mass extinction (142). Each year, the world
consumes more than 92 Gt of materials---biomass (mostly food), metals,
fossil fuels, and minerals. This figure is growing at the rate of 3.2%
per year. Resources are being extracted from the planet 3 times faster
than in 1970, even though the population has only doubled within that
time (143). During the 20th century, this boosted the global economy,
but since then resources have become more expensive to extract and the
environmental costs harder to ignore.

Both plant and soil carbon storage originate with photosynthesis, which
withdraws about 31% of annual anthropogenic CO2 emissions (2). However,
studies (144) across a range of forest ecosystems have found that
heating leads to thermal stress and reduced carbon assimilation. Many
ecosystems (80) are already operating at or beyond thermal thresholds
for photosynthesis (145). Widespread terrestrial ecological decline has
resulted from the combination of climate change, resource extraction,
bushmeat hunting, and agricultural and urban development. Since 1970,
vertebrate populations have declined 69% (146), and 1 in 4 species are
at risk of extinction (147), in part because 75% of the terrestrial
environment has been severely altered by human actions.

Agricultural development has further eroded ecosystem health, with over
15 billion trees per year lost since the emergence of agriculture; the
global number of trees has fallen by over 45% (148). An estimated 67,340
km2 of global forest were lost in 2021 alone, unleashing 3.8 Gt of GHG
emissions, roughly 10% of the global average (149). Such losses extend
to wetland areas; more than 85% of the wetlands present in 1700 had been
lost by 2000, and loss of wetlands is currently 3 times faster than
forest loss.

Food and water security

Increasing human population, and the need to expand food production,
were the drivers of the Green Revolution over 50 years ago (150). This
[increased productivity through]{.underline} selective **[genetic
breeding]{.underline}**, **[monocultures]{.underline}**, **[seed
improvement]{.underline}**, [and the use of]{.underline} **[chemical
fertilizers]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[pesticides]{.underline}**. These [steps have]{.underline} **[not
solved]{.underline}** the problem of **[food insecurity]{.underline}**
[which has been]{.underline} **[aggravated]{.underline}** [in more
vulnerable populations]{.underline} (151). Worldwide, it is estimated
that 16,000 children are pushed into hunger every day---a 32% increase
from 2022 (152).

Agriculture now uses half of the world's ice- and desert-free land, and
causes 78% of global ocean and freshwater eutrophication (153).
[Pesticide and fertilizer runoff]{.underline}, as well as sewage, find
their way to aquatic environments (154) and [degrade water quality,
while]{.underline} **[spreading]{.underline}** [infectious

[Microplastics]{.underline} **[reduce beneficial]{.underline}**
[bacteria concentrations, and]{.underline} can be [absorbed by plants,
and then passed up the food chain]{.underline} (155).

[Industrial farming employs]{.underline} **[deep plowing]{.underline}**
[that depletes and oxidizes]{.underline} **[soil]{.underline}**, turning
acreage into a source of GHG (156). Agriculture is responsible for 70%
of global freshwater withdrawals (157). By one estimate (158), 94% of
nonhuman mammal biomass is now livestock, and 71% of bird biomass is
poultry livestock. 50% of all agricultural expansion has come at the
expense of forests. In 2022, the rate of global deforestation was the
equivalent of 11 soccer/football fields per minute (40), predominantly
for cattle ranching and grain animal feed crops (such as soy) for
export.

Today, agriculture uses half of all habitable land (159), and either
through grazing or growing animal feed, 77% of that is dedicated to
livestock (153). Animal agriculture is expanding. From 1998 to 2018
global meat consumption increased 58%. Cattle and the grain they eat use
1/3 of all available land surface, 1/3 of global grain production, and
16% of all available freshwater. Yet cattle agriculture only generates
18% of food calories and 27% of protein (153). The production of
fertilizer for feed crops emits 41 MtCO2/yr. The combination of
emissions from manufacturing, transporting, and applying synthetic
fertilizer on the land (which releases the potent GHG N2O) today likely
outpaces the emissions of the commercial aviation industry. These
**[fertilizer-related GHG emissions]{.underline}** [are projected to
grow]{.underline}. Additionally, [livestock feed demands a]{.underline}
**[minimum]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} [80% of]{.underline} global
[soybean crop and]{.underline} over [50% of]{.underline} global [corn
crop]{.underline}. Thirty-five to **[40% of]{.underline}** yearly
**[anthropogenic]{.underline}** CH4 **[emissions]{.underline}** ar[e a
result of domestic livestock production due to enteric fermentation and
manure]{.underline} (160).

Under a range of GHG emission pathways, cropland exposure to drought and
heat-wave events will increase by a factor of 10 in the midterm and a
factor of 20--30 in the long term on all continents, especially Asia and
Africa (161). Harvest failures across major crop-producing regions are a
threat to global food security. Jet stream changes are projected to
increase synchronous crop failure and lower crop yields in multiple
agricultural regions around the world (162). Crop failure due to
drought, flood, or extreme weather (163) events increases
disproportionately between 1.5 and 2°C of global heating (164). For
maize, risks of multiple breadbasket failures increase from 6-- 40% at
1.5°C to 54% at 2°C. In relative terms, the highest climate risk
increases, between 1.5 and 2°C heating, is for wheat (40%), followed by
maize (35%) and soybean (23%). Limiting global heating to 1.5°C would
reduce the risk of simultaneous crop failure for maize, wheat, and
soybean by 26%, 28%, and 19%, respectively (164).

Demand for wheat is projected to increase 60% by 2050. Yet, rising CO2
depletes the nutrient and protein content of wheat, and with drought,
fire, and flood, leads to a 15% decline in projected wheat yield by
midcentury (165). Increased levels of CO2 are decreasing the amount of
protein, iron, zinc, and B vitamins in rice with potential adverse
health consequences for a global population of approximately 600 million
(166). Harvests of staple cereal crops, such as rice and maize, could
decrease by 20--40% as a function of heightened surface temperatures in
tropical and subtropical regions by 2100 (167). This will exacerbate
existing food security issues, as 1 billion people are currently
classified as food insecure (168).

Worldwide, fungal infections cause growers to lose 10--23% of their
crops each year, and an additional 10--20% is lost following harvest.
Global [heating is driving a]{.underline} poleward **[migration of
fungal infections]{.underline}**, [meaning more countries will
see]{.underline} **[fungal]{.underline}** [infections damaging
harvests]{.underline}. Growers have reported wheat stem rust infections,
usually tropical, in Ireland and England. Experts (169) also [warn that
fungi tolerance to higher temperatures could increase the]{.underline}
**[likelihood of soil-dwelling pathogens]{.underline}** [to
infect]{.underline} animals or [humans]{.underline}. Across the five
most important calorie crops of rice, wheat, maize (corn), soybeans, and
potatoes, fungal infections already cause losses equal to provisions for
600 million to 4 billion people. Without major and rapid policy changes,
food productivity in 2050 could be reduced to 1980 yield levels because
new technologies will be unable to mitigate climate change in major
growing regions (170).

**[Clean water security]{.underline}** [is a]{.underline}
**[critical]{.underline}** [issue]{.underline} (171). Research shows
that groundwater [levels are]{.underline} **[rapidly]{.underline}**
[declining, especially in]{.underline} dry [regions with]{.underline}
**[extensive croplands]{.underline}**, [and has]{.underline}
**[accelerated]{.underline}** [over the past four decades]{.underline}
in 30% of the world's regional aquifers (172). The Southern Hemisphere
has experienced a 20% drop in water availability over the past two
decades (173). Approximately 3.6 billion people, or 47% of the global
population, suffer water scarcity at least 1 month each year (174).
Global [water security is an urgent concern due to the]{.underline}
**[increasing imbalance]{.underline}** [between]{.underline} the [finite
supply of freshwater and the escalating demand driven by population
growth, economic development, and agricultural needs]{.underline}.
Climate change compounds the crisis by altering precipitation patterns,
causing droughts, and depleting glaciers---key freshwater sources.
Contamination from industrial, agricultural, and residential waste
further restricts the amount of clean water available. This [scarcity
threatens]{.underline} human health, food production, and ecosystem
**[stability]{.underline}**, [leading to conflicts and
displacements]{.underline}. Addressing this problem requires global
cooperation for sustainable management, technological innovation for
conservation and purification, and policies that prioritize equitable
access to clean water (174).

Heat

The impact of heat on food production is disproportionately severe in
low-income communities. Workers in agriculture, construction, and other
outdoor sectors often work in conditions that can lead to heat stress or
heatstroke. Food production, too, is critically affected as extreme heat
can reduce crop yields, increase irrigation needs, and lead to soil
degradation. These communities have less access to heat-protection
technologies such as air-conditioned spaces, efficient irrigation
systems, or heat-resistant crop varieties. Consequently, their economic
stability and food security are more vulnerable to climate-induced
temperature increases, exacerbating existing inequalities and pushing
these populations further into poverty.

In 2022, global heat stress caused the loss of 490 billion potential
labor hours, 143 h per person, a 42% increase from the 1991 to 2000
average (175). The loss of labor due to heat exposure resulted in a
\$863 billion loss of "potential income" and wiped out the equivalent of
4% of Africa's GDP. The agriculture sector was hardest hit, accounting
for 82% of losses in least developed countries. The global land area
affected by at least 1 month of extreme drought per year increased from
18% averaged over the decade 1951--1960 to 47% in the decade 2013--2022.
Because of heat stress, under a 2°C warming scenario, 525 million
additional people will experience food insecurity by midcentury,
compared to the period 1995--2014, and the number of heat-related deaths
each year will increase by 370%. Older people and infants now are
exposed to twice the number of heat-wave days annually as they were
averaged over the period 1986--2005.

Heat-related deaths of people older than 65 have increased by 85% since
the 1990s (175). Even under moderate warming, heat and drought levels in
Europe that were virtually impossible 20 years ago reach 1-in-10
likelihoods as early as the 2030s (84). Averaged over the period
2050--2074, projections for two successive years of single or compound
end-of-century extremes, unprecedented to date, exceed 1-in-10
likelihoods; while Europe-wide 5-year megadroughts become plausible.
Whole decades of end-of-century heat stress could start by 2040, by 2020
for drought, and with a warm North Atlantic, end-of-century decades
starting as early as 2030 become twice as likely.

For thousands of years, fundamental limits on food and water security
meant that human communities have concentrated under a narrow range of
climate variables characterized by mean annual temperatures (MATs)
around 13°C (18). With continued GHG emissions, global heating of 3°C is
projected to drive a MAT \>29°C across 19% of the planet's land surface
and displace one-third of the human population. Today, this MAT accounts
for only 0.8% percent of Earth's land surface, mostly concentrated in
the deep Sahara.

Model projections indicate that in the Middle East and North Africa,
continued emissions will cause the emergence of unprecedented super- and
ultraextreme heat-wave conditions (176). These events involve
excessively warm temperatures (56°C and higher) and will be of extended
duration (several weeks), quickly becoming life-threatening for humans
(177). Researchers found that by 2100, under current levels of GHG
emissions, 3 of 4 people in the world will be exposed to deadly heat
conditions every year, with a higher occurrence of these conditions in
intertropical areas (2). Coupled with significant socioeconomic
differences within countries, heat waves intensify global disparities in
health, especially given the depleted resources for several of these
regions to respond to accelerated heating. In the last decade, there has
been \>2,300% increase in the loss of human life from heat waves as a
result of about 1°C heating. On our current pathway, the global health
and socioeconomic risks of continued heating are catastrophic.

The distribution of these conditions is unequal, and people and
communities subjected to the loss of security are powerless to respond.
The impacts of this inequity may cause regionally existential
deterioration and suffering. As temperatures rise, death rates increase
most among the poorest populations (178). By 2099, under a scenario of
continued high emissions growth, climate change increases death rates in
low-income countries by over 106 deaths per 100,000, while high-income
countries are projected to see death rates decrease by 25 deaths per
100,000, while spending significantly to prevent more deaths. Overall,
today's rich countries pay nearly 3 times more than poor countries to
adapt to rising temperatures and prevent additional deaths. When it
comes to cutting emissions, the social and economic burden of inaction
is predominantly carried by the poorest and most vulnerable in human
society, including Indigenous and local communities, concentrated in
developing countries.

Illness and disease

As the planet heats up, [infectious diseases]{.underline} **[once
confined]{.underline}** [to tropical regions are expanding their
range]{.underline}. The World Health Organization estimates that by the
end of this decade the climate impact on health will cost between \$2
billion and \$4 billion per year (179). Between 2030 and 2050, climate
change is expected to cause approximately 250,000 additional deaths per
year from, for example, undernutrition, malaria, cholera, diarrhea, and
heat stress alone. This does not include massive climate burdens on
agriculture, water, and sanitation, which also shape public health.

In July 2023, for the first time in 20 years, the United States
experienced locally acquired malaria infections. Six cases were
confirmed in Florida and one in Texas, none related to international
travel (180). In Seattle, cases of West Nile disease were reported for
the first time. Over half of the infectious diseases confronted by
humanity have been aggravated by climatic hazards at some point (181).
All communities are vulnerable to climate change impacts; however,
children, elders, the sick, and the poor face the greatest risks (182).
People with cardiovascular and/or respiratory chronic illnesses are
particularly vulnerable to high temperatures (183). Air pollution from
GHG emissions leads to increased health complications such as asthma and
allergies. The impacts of climate change disproportionately affect
vulnerable communities, including low-income regions and communities of
color which have been disempowered by a history of colonialism, racism,
oppression, and injustice. Extreme weather events further exacerbate the
situation, driving animals and people together in unsanitary conditions
and disrupting essential services like healthcare and clean water
supplies.

Approximately 17% of diseases are spread by animal vectors causing over
700,000 deaths annually. Concentrated [animal farming operations
are]{.underline} **[breeding grounds for virulent
pathogens]{.underline}** (184), [and]{.underline} over 15,000 new cases
of mammals [transmitting]{.underline} **[viruses]{.underline}** to other
mammals [could occur]{.underline} in the next 50 years due to climate
change (185). Smaller species like bats, rats, and other rodents are
thriving in human-populated areas, contributing to the spread of
diseases through their interactions. Biodiversity loss and deforestation
are directly linked to the rise of infectious diseases, with 1/3 of
zoonotic diseases attributed to these factors. Some 60% of known
pathogens, and 3 out of every 4 new or emergent infectious diseases are
zoonotic (186), and roughly 1/3 of those are attributed to deforestation
and habitat loss (187). A new disease surfaces 5 times a year, and
future global heating and precipitation changes will further expand
habitats for pathogens and vectors, proliferating dengue fever, cholera,
malaria, diarrhea, and other diseases (188).

[Climate change]{.underline} **[intensifies]{.underline}**
[the]{.underline} **[spread of infectious diseases]{.underline}**,
particularly in low-income communities, b[y expanding the habitats of
disease vectors]{.underline} such as mosquitoes and ticks. Warmer
temperatures and altered rainfall patterns increase the incidence and
geographic range of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever.
Flooding and extreme weather events, more common as the climate changes,
can lead to waterborne diseases due to the contamination of freshwater
supplies. Low-income [areas]{.underline} often [have]{.underline}
**[insufficient]{.underline}** [healthcare infrastructure, making
them]{.underline} **[more vulnerable]{.underline}** [to these
outbreaks]{.underline}. Additionally, malnutrition from climate-induced
food scarcity can weaken immune systems, further raising the
susceptibility to infections. Thus, climate change magnifies health
disparities, with low-income communities facing disproportionately high
risks of disease.

Economic inequality, ecological destruction, and global security

A grossly unequal distribution of wealth couples with the increasing
consumption patterns of a rising global middle class (189) to amplify
ecological destruction. The poorest half of the global population owns
barely 2% of total global wealth, while the richest 10% owns 76% of all
wealth (190). The poorest 50% of the global population contribute just
10% of emissions, while the richest 10% emit more than 50% total carbon
emissions (191). Climate change, economic inequality, and rising
consumption levels intertwine to amplify ecological destruction.

Climate change, driven by carbon emissions, often stems from industrial
activities catering to increased consumption, particularly in wealthier
nations. This consumption depletes natural resources and exacerbates
pollution and habitat loss. Economic inequality compounds these issues,
as poorer communities lack the resources to adapt to environmental
changes or invest in sustainable practices. Consequently, low-income
communities bear the brunt of ecological degradation, such as soil
erosion, water scarcity, and biodiversity loss, while their limited
economic means prevent effective response or recovery. This cycle of
consumption, inequality, and environmental impact creates a feedback
loop, perpetuating and intensifying ecological damage globally.

Fifty years ago, **[underdevelopment]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[scarcity]{.underline}** [were drivers of unsustainable resource
use]{.underline}, but today [these roots have morphed into]{.underline}
**[overdevelopment]{.underline}**, affluence, and privilege [driving
unsustainable wealth accumulation and aggregate
consumption]{.underline}. At present, not a single country delivers what
its citizens need without transgressing planetary boundaries of
long-term sustainability (192). Modern [imperialism]{.underline}
**[amplifies]{.underline}** these [inequalities through economic
exploitation, wealth accumulation, political interference, cultural
dominance, and other methods that leverage colonial power
structures]{.underline}. Recognizing and addressing neocolonial
practices is crucial for promoting equitable and sustainable development
and respecting the sovereignty and self-determination of nations (193).

The use of natural materials and their benefits are unevenly distributed
across the globe. Overconsumption is closely linked to wealth and income
disparities with large amounts of money concentrated in a few rich
countries, largely in the Northern Hemisphere (194). For example,
environmental stresses and shocks related to natural resource extraction
and use are outsourced to countries and regions outside the European
Union, while more than 85% of the economic benefits stay within member
countries (195).

[Global inequality results in]{.underline} **[fragile
regions]{.underline}** [where]{.underline} **[intensified]{.underline}**
[conflict over scarce resources allows]{.underline} **[malevolent
actors]{.underline}** [to thrive]{.underline} (196). One study (197)
[found strong causal evidence linking]{.underline} **[climatic
events]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[human conflict]{.underline}**
[across]{.underline} **[all]{.underline}** [major regions of the
world]{.underline}: for each 1 SD (1σ) change in climate toward warmer
temperatures or more extreme rainfall, data show that the frequency of
interpersonal violence rises 4% and the frequency of intergroup conflict
rises 14%. Temperatures across the developed world are expected to warm
2σ to 4σ by 2050. Hence, amplified rates of human conflict could
represent a large and critical impact of anthropogenic climate change.

Over the next 3 decades, even under best-case scenarios of low heating,
national, and [global security face]{.underline} **[severe
risks]{.underline}** [in every region of the world]{.underline}. Higher
levels of [heating will pose]{.underline}
**[catastrophic]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} likely
**[irreversible]{.underline}**, [global security risks]{.underline} over
the course of the 21st century. A world where global mean surface
temperature has increased 3°C will be characterized by widespread and
intense heat stress, extreme weather events, ruptured and unproductive
marine and terrestrial ecosystems, broken food systems, disease and
morbidity, intense decadal megadrought, freshwater scarcity,
catastrophic sea level rise, and large numbers of migrant populations.
By 2050, under these malignant conditions, up to 1.2 billion humans
could be displaced by climate change (198). These intensifying crises
now threaten the very fabric of our global socioeconomic system.
Immediate action is imperative to avert a collapse that endangers
societal structures worldwide.

Climate purgatory

Although the global condition is bleak, after 200 years of fossil fuel
expansion, we are at a turning point in the energy system. The
clean-energy revolution is underway. Global sales of vehicles powered by
fossil fuels peaked in 2017 (199), and in 2023 electric vehicle sales
grew by 55%, reaching a record high of more than 10 million. For the
first time ever, announced manufacturing capacity for electric vehicle
batteries is now sufficient to fulfill expected demand requirements by
2030 (200).

Renewable energy installations jumped nearly 50% in 2023, the most rapid
growth rate in two decades (200). After remaining flat for several
years, global clean energy spending is increasing. Last year, renewables
made up about 30% of total electricity generation, up from 25% in 2018.
Global investment in the energy transition totaled \$1.77 trillion in
2023, an increase of 17% from the prior year. Solar energy is expected
to become the cheapest form of energy in many places by 2030 and major
global powers are investing in infrastructure for energy transformation.

However, increasing global energy consumption offsets these gains in
renewable energy. Because of rising power needs in developing nations
due to population growth and industrialization, ongoing electrification
of the transport and building sectors, and other areas of energy
expansion, the International Energy Agency (IEA) projects increasing
growth of energy demand, rising at an annual average rate of 3.4% in
2024--2026. Although the expansion of clean-energy sources is set to
meet this demand growth, decoupling energy consumption and CO2
production, the separation is not nearly wide enough to meet Paris
Agreement Goals for stopping global heating

Countries and companies are taking steps to address climate change while
simultaneously making choices that undermine these efforts. This paradox
places us in a state of climate purgatory. The IEA predicts (200) a peak
in fossil fuel demand by 2030, but reports show governments planning to
increase coal, oil, and gas production well beyond climate commitments.
This math does not align with the 1.5°C or even the 2°C warming targets.
Many experts consider these targets nearly impossible due to the global
reluctance to urgently phase out fossil fuels. In this climate
purgatory, we are at a critical juncture, where urgent, transformative
action is required to reconcile our ambitions with our actions.

The 2023 UN "gap report" (26) tells us that governments plan to produce
around 110% more fossil fuels in 2030 than would be consistent with
limiting warming to 1.5°C, and 69% more than would be consistent with
2°C. National carbon-cutting policies are so inadequate that 3°C of
heating could be reached this century. Based on existing national
pledges, global emissions in 2030 will be only 2% below 2019 levels,
rather than the 43% cut required to limit global heating to 1.5°C. To
get on track, 22 GtCO2 must be cut from currently projected global
emissions in 2030. That is 42% of the total and equivalent to the output
of the world's five worst polluters: China, US, India, Russia, and
Japan.

The world will need to increase climate spending to around \$9 trillion
annually by 2030 and to nearly \$11 trillion by 2035 to roll out clean
sources of energy and prepare for the inevitable impacts of a warming
climate during coming decades (201). To limit warming to 1.5°C now
requires eliminating emissions shortly after 2040. Although technically
feasible, few mainstream scientists believe it is still achievable
(202). Instead, analysts predict (203) that global fossil fuel emissions
will peak at some point in the next decade, followed not by a decline
but a long plateau (204), culminating with end-of-century warming
potentially reaching 3°C (Fig. 4).

Although global renewable energy capacity is growing, there is a lack of
financing for emerging and developing economies. Redirecting financial
resources to lower income nations is crucial. More than 90% of
clean-energy investment comes from advanced economies and China, risking
new dividing lines in global energy. The biggest shortfalls in
clean-energy investment are in emerging and developing economies. More
needs to be done by the international community to drive investment in
lower income economies, where the private sector has been reluctant to
venture. There is ample capital available---evidenced by the nearly \$12
trillion allocated for COVID-19 economic relief and the over \$1
trillion annually in fossil fuel subsidies, which balloons to \$7
trillion with indirect incentives. Reallocating these funds is complex,
particularly due to potential impacts on the poorest populations, yet it
remains a vital reservoir for investment as the world plans for a
sustainable future.

A new era of reciprocity with nature and among human societies

The purpose of this review is to draw immediate attention to the
careless, foolish way that humanity is gambling with the future. Unless
things change dramatically, and soon, damage to the natural world will
have long-lasting consequences for species and ecosystems, and
devastating upheavals for humanity. Although this will particularly
affect vulnerable populations, all of humanity faces an unprecedented
catastrophe.

There are signs that humanity is awakening to the need for a new system
of values that recognize Earth as an island in space with limitations on
resource availability. No one is coming to rescue us. Many of the
changes that we call for in this essay are consistent with the work of
the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and
Ecosystem Services (141) and the UN SDG framework (205). But carbon
assimilation in natural systems is decreasing--- potentially with
significant effects in only decades; planetary-scale biophysical systems
such as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, the Southern
Ocean overturning circulation, atmospheric Hadley circulation, summer
sea ice, tropical forests, and others have shifted and are projected to
falter. And urbanism, deforestation, consumerism, pollution, disease,
social stratification, and extractive agriculture are all on
accelerating and expanding trends.

\[Figure omitted\]

This is a human inflection point that will determine future conditions
of life on Earth (206). While transitioning to a carbon-free energy
system comes with major societal restructuring, the socioeconomic
adjustments needed to rapidly decrease emissions also present
opportunities for achieving social and ecological justice, reducing
disease, promoting the successful achievement of SDGs, and securing food
and water availablity for our children.

We *can* end pollution, improve human health, reign in population
growth, and reduce further biophysical risks. Indigenous communities
have practiced regenerative ways of managing natural resources by
understanding the reciprocal relationship between humans and their
natural surroundings. Nature is not a commodity for exploitation, but a
living system with its own rights, where humans are life-supported and
in turn play a regenerative role. This kinship promotes nature and
humanity thriving together.

Under current national plans, global GHG emissions are set to increase
9% by 2030, compared to 2010 levels. Yet the science is clear: emissions
must fall by 45% by the end of this decade compared to 2010 levels to
meet the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5°C (207). As
governments invest in renewable energy sources, there are enormous
cobenefits to be gained in terms of disease reduction, social equity,
and a growing respect for Earth's rhythms. Yet [renewable energy
will]{.underline} **[not address]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} root
**[problem]{.underline}** [of ecological overshoot, social justice, or
pollution]{.underline}. [Policies are needed that]{.underline}
**[end]{.underline}** the production of **[superfluous and luxury
commodities]{.underline}**, [conserve energy]{.underline} at household
and societal levels, [stabilize global population, and]{.underline}
**[replace the extractive model]{.underline}** [with one
that]{.underline} **[emphasizes]{.underline}** true
**[sustainability]{.underline}** [so that more natural resources per
capita become available and wealth is far more equitably
distributed]{.underline} (208).

The shift away from an extractive, resource-driven global economy toward
one that values human rights and livelihoods could redefine global
economics and offer reasons for optimism. [Opportunities to]{.underline}
**[prevent catastrophic]{.underline}** levels of
**[heating]{.underline}** [are being missed due to accelerating
consumerism]{.underline}, the false seduction of dubious climate quick
fixes, unverifiable "carbon offsets", exorbitant pollution levels, and
growing economic disparity. [Halting]{.underline} global [ecological
decline and addressing]{.underline} the cri[ses of climate change,
biodiversity collapse, pollution, pandemics, and human injustice
requires a]{.underline} **[shift in economic structures]{.underline}**,
human behavior, and above all, values.

Whether the world is considered overpopulated depends on various
factors. It is essential to consider not only population numbers but
also consumption patterns, resource distribution, and sustainability
when discussing this complex issue. Additionally, strategies for
addressing concerns related to population growth often involve a
combination of policies related to education, healthcare, resource
management, and environmental protection. In developing economies,
overpopulation is not just about how many people there are but also
about how much each person consumes compared to the availability of
resources.

High levels of [consumption in developed countries contribute
to]{.underline} **[environmental degradation]{.underline}**, [raising
the issue o]{.underline}f **[unequal]{.underline}** [distribution of
resources]{.underline}. While some regions may be densely populated and
face resource constraints, others have much lower population densities
and abundant resources. **[Inequities]{.underline}** [in resource
distribution]{.underline} can [lead to]{.underline} **[perceptions of
overpopulation]{.underline}** [but are in reality more closely related
to social inequalities]{.underline}, often [with]{.underline}
**[deep]{.underline}** historical **[roots]{.underline}** [related
to]{.underline} imperialism and [unjust resource
extraction]{.underline}.

Humans must become rejuvenators of natural systems (209). We
[must]{.underline} **[shift from wealth]{.underline}** as a goal, **[to
sustainability as a goal]{.underline}** [driving our
decisons]{.underline}. This [includes]{.underline} developing
replacements for plastics, adopting regenerative and restorative
cultivation and harvesting methods, **[investing in]{.underline}**
cradle to grave research and development focused on material reuse,
**[absolute decoupling]{.underline}** [of the economy from]{.underline}
net [resource depletion]{.underline}, and establishing conservation
goals to conserve 30--50% of Earth's land, freshwater, and oceans (210).

[Wildlife populations have crashed by 69% over the past 50
years]{.underline} (Davis, 2022) as an almost direct [result of
capitalism]{.underline} which I will further expand upon in this
article. [Capitalism by its very nature drives **environmental
destruction**. This is because the main objective of businesses that
operate under capitalism is to maximise profits]{.underline} for their
shareholders, even if it's [at the expense of the environment and the
species in which inhabit it.]{.underline}

[Capitalism's need for continuous growth]{.underline}, which can be
compared to that of a treadmill (Schnaiberg, 1980), has [led to the
**extraction of finite resources** on a massive scale]{.underline},
often prioritising profit above all else. This can be seen through an
abundance of examples, such as the continued destruction of the Amazon
rainforest by companies such as the Brazilian mining empire Vale who
extracted more than 4 billion tonnes of iron ore from the Carajás mines
(Jonathan Watts, 2023). [Such mining operations demand extensive land
use, leading to significant deforestation. The
deforestation]{.underline} required for these operations [endangers
countless plant and animal species as well as disrupting the indigenous
communities. The Amazon rainforest]{.underline} houses over 3 million
species of plants and animals and one million indigenous people all of
which are essential to the functionality of the rainforest (Santos,
2024). They help [stabilise the ecosystem, maintain food chains, and
support species]{.underline} that depend on each other. In addition, the
[amazon rainforest provides 9% of the world's oxygen]{.underline}
(Nevres, 2023) and practices like deforestation are major contributors
to climate change as [deforestation releases stored carbon into the
atmosphere and mining activities themselves generate an **abundance of
carbon emissions** accelerating the climate crisis]{.underline} and
contributing to the rising temperatures disrupting ecosystems worldwide.

While [capitalism has increased the standard of living]{.underline} for
millions of people, it has done so [at the expense of nature. Wildlife
has been negatively impacted so much in the past 500 years, human
activity has led to 500 species of land animals going
extinct]{.underline}, a rate that has caused scientists to warn of a
sixth mass extinction (Carey, 2015). Some may argue that climate change
is a natural phenomenon and that humans are not to blame but the
scientific evidence has demonstrated that human behaviour is the main
driver of climate change (Swim JK, 2011). We are responsible for the
current mass extinction of species and the suffering of animals, whether
that is from rising temperatures which is disrupting the ecosystems to
habitat destruction caused by resource extraction. [As habitats shrink
and ecosystems degrade]{.underline}, countless species struggle to
survive and are often forced to migrate. This is [seen with
overfishing.]{.underline} Overfishing is when too many fish are taken
out of the ocean creating an imbalance that can erode the food chain and
[lead to a loss of important marine life, including vulnerable species
like sea turtles and corals]{.underline} (World Wild life, 2024).

Ultimately the chain reaction put into motion by [capitalism's
relentless pursuit of profit]{.underline} is not just an economic or
class issue, but also a [**profound threat** to our planet's
biodiversity and overall stability.]{.underline} Corporations have known
of the threat for quite some time but have [completely ignored it as
sustainable practices are viewed as more costly and less
profitable]{.underline}. For example, in 1995 Royal Dutch Shell planned
to sink the Brent Spar oil platform in the North Atlantic as a low-cost
method of disposal (Weyler, 2016). However, this would have negatively
impacted the ocean's ecosystem, potentially releasing toxic substances
that could harm marine life and disrupt delicate ecological balances
that are present within oceans[. Capitalism often blames consumers for
how much climate change has progressed in the last hundred
years.]{.underline} For example, there are massive programmes for
household waste recycling, creating the [**illusion** that consumer
choices are the main drivers of environmental damages.]{.underline}
Meanwhile, there is a lack of government funding or policies to ensure
major corporations adopt green energy solutions of sustainable practices
even though since 1988 [just 100 companies have been the source of more
than 70% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions]{.underline} (Riley,
2017).

In Capital v. 3, Marx (1991: 349--350) argues that [**falling** rates of
**profit** in production]{.underline} encourage
**[greater]{.underline}** [speculation and riskier
investment]{.underline}, and with it, [financial crises]{.underline}; he
also noted that financial crises are what trigger broader downturns or
recessions. The Marxist economist Andrew [Kliman]{.underline} (2015:
244) adds that the [**link** between **falling** profitability and
greater **speculation**]{.underline} is [that]{.underline} capitalists
do not resign themselves to obtaining the now-reduced average rate of
profit (They [want]{.underline} to [maintain]{.underline} their
[existing]{.underline} rate of [profit]{.underline}, and they may need
to maintain it in order to be able to [repay their debts]{.underline}.)
Under capitalism, development continues to occur because of its promise
to generate profits. [As this capacity]{.underline} to [generate
**profits** slows down]{.underline} or even [vanishes, **so**
does]{.underline} the **[capitalist]{.underline}**-led development. The
essential problem of capitalist development, then, is the progressive
nature of capital. If this sounds like a re-assertion if not a call for
the [**renewal** of **Marx's** Law of **Law** of the **Tendential Fall
in the Rate of Profit** (**LTFRP**),]{.underline} that's because it is.
As Kliman (2015) and Michael Roberts (2022) have been keen to note,
Marx's crisis theory -- which reaches its most systematic form in
Capital v. 3 -- is insistent that the l[ong-run falling rate of profit
is the central **contradiction** of **capitalism**]{.underline}, with
**[legal]{.underline}** and extralegal **[interventions]{.underline}**
almost always [geared toward **curtailing** this **existential**
issue]{.underline}. Henryk Grossman and Richard Kuhn (2013), following
Marx, have identified such '[fixes']{.underline} as '[counter
tendencies]{.underline} that slow or [temporarily reverse]{.underline}
the [tendency]{.underline} for the rate of profit to fall', but that
these '[only operate **temporarily** and to a **limited**
extent]{.underline}', pointing out that nearly every time the rate of
profit falls and a crisis and recession ensues, a gradual rise in the
rate of profit eventually occurs, but, never returns the higher level
that it was at prior to the downturn. If we follow this logic through
multiple boom-and-bust cycles, the result is a long-term rate of profit
that trends downward. In a similar fashion, Roberts (2022) summarizes
Marx's 'two key points' on the LTFRP as follows: There will be a
long-term secular decline in the average rate of profit on capital stock
as capitalism develops and, 2. The balance of tendential and
counter-tendential factors in the law explains the regular booms and
slumps in capitalist production. Across a range of Marxist economists
including Kuhn, Kliman, Roberts, and Vighi, the idea that all that is
needed is a rebalancing or equilibration of capital flows has been one
of the great ruses of capitalism. Vighi (2023a, 2023b), in particular,
suggests that the ever-increasing shift toward debt reliance in the
process of capital accumulation should be summed up as the temporary,
stalling, necessary nature of the great intervention to fictitiously
prop up profit rates and the slow demise of value, a mode of
intervention that literally produces a [**society** living on **borrowed
time**]{.underline}. In the words of Feldner et al. (2017: 1), 'Through
debt we have been living on borrowed time; yet, [without]{.underline}
the prospect of real [growth]{.underline} the [issue]{.underline} of
[debt sustainability]{.underline} only **[foreshadows]{.underline}** a
much **[trickier]{.underline}** one, for the [covenant of capitalist
societies]{.underline} itself is rendered nil and [void']{.underline}.
Despite the goal of trickle-down productive-economic growth through debt
creation, [cheap borrowing]{.underline} from the [financial
sector]{.underline} has headed much [less toward investment in
productive capital]{.underline} than envisioned by the state managers of
capital, whose eye on [sustaining capitalism]{.underline} as a system is
much more rigorous than any individual capitalist making money work for
their own interests. [Why invest in production]{.underline} when the
[rate of return isn't]{.underline} as [exciting]{.underline} as
elsewhere? A [**cheaper** credit **regime**]{.underline} supported by
the **[central banks]{.underline}** has resulted in a [high incentive
for a combination of 'risk-free']{.underline} investments in [**bond**
markets]{.underline} and [risk-heavy **speculative**
investments]{.underline} in the [**stock** and
**derivatives**]{.underline} sectors. Following the range of political
economists cited above, we might say that (1) a slowdown in general
economic growth has occurred, because (2) a [slowdown in productive
growth]{.underline} has occurred, a problem itself born out of (3) a
slowdown in production profitability, leading to a greater reliance on
(4a) debt creation and debt-driven growth through cheap credit regimes,
as well as (4b) speculative asset bubbles making use of said cheap
credit. Setting the stage for understanding our crisis moment as the
slow demise of value, one can then see in crisis management broadly, and
federal funding and repo markets more specifically, a necessary tool for
capitalist sustainability. This is in direct opposition to the
anarcho-capitalist or libertarian view of monetary policy and central
banks as getting in the way of capitalism's vitality (Aljazeera 2023).
The same can be said about capitalism's natural tendency toward falling
rates of profit. If the natural development of capitalism is falling
rates of profit, then the state may attempt to hold this development
back for the system's own safety. A common argument among left academics
is to suggest that because neoliberal redistribution policies were
enacted, the rate of profit has not fallen during the neoliberal period
(Magdoff & Foster 2013; Tombazos 2019). It is argued that the wage share
of income decreased, and uppermanagement and owner share of income
increased, thus stabilizing or even increasing the rate of profit.
Andrew Kliman (2015) shows how this only gets half the picture right. In
his critique of Magdoff and Bellamy Foster's (2013) conclusions that the
profit crisis of the 1970s was resolved via neoliberal redistribution,
Kliman shows that while they are right in concluding that the wage share
of income dropped, they overestimate the extent due to a reliance on
incomplete data. What they see as a 21% drop, Kliman calculates as 9%,
using a more complete dataset. Kliman also makes clear that this 9% is
not enough to make up for the drop in the profit rate that occurred in
the 'long 70s' (mid-1950s to early 1980s), a rate which has never
recovered. Thus, as he (2015: 249) concludes, 'neoliberalism was not
very successful in restoring profitability'. To be sure, even if there
was not a significant enough wage redistribution to save the profit
crisis, it does not follow that labor is in any better position than it
was 40years ago. The opposite is the case, given today's minimized union
density, household debt crisis, and general cost of living crisis. Below
are just a few datapoints capturing this social pain: As of February
2024, inflation is slowing (depending on the measurement), but prices
are still significantly up. General consumer prices went up 4.7% in
2021, then 8% in 2022, and another 3.5% in 2023. Here are the metrics on
four essential consumer goods, in particular (Rugaber 2023): Groceries
are up 25% from pre-pandemic levels. New car prices are up 21% (Official
Data Foundation (ODF) 2024b). Home rent prices are up 18% (and still
increasing) (ODF 2024c; Yahoo Finance 2023). Home purchase prices are up
18.74% (ODF 2024a). Beyond inflation, the mainstream press argues that
job growth is 'looking good'. However, it is difficult to tell the
quality of these new jobs (full-time or part-time, benefits included,
competitive and livable wages, etc.). There is some helpful data,
though. For instance, here are some concerning labor trends reported at
the end of 2023 (de Visé 2023): The number of Americans working at least
two jobs is at its highest rate since before the pandemic; the number of
Americans working one full-time job and one parttime job is at an
all-time high. Moreover, illegal child labor has nearly quadrupled since
2015; relatedly, state de-regulation (axing of) child labor laws is
increasing, arguably in order to allow for more low-wage workers (the
minimum wage for children is significantly lower than the adult minimum
wage) (Conover 2023). Finally, with regard to labor and income, 62% of
Americans are still living paycheck-to-paycheck as of October 2023 (CNBC
2023). Jobs and income are not the only indicators of working class
health, though. We should also look to the ever-expanding debt crisis.
As the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (2023a) reports, credit card
debt has surpassed \$1 trillion for the first time, and the average APR
for all credit card accounts is 21.19% (a 43% increase from pre-pandemic
levels). In part because of the higher interest rates, the rate of
credit card delinquencies (60+ days past due debt) is the highest it is
been since 2010 (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 2023b). There are
certainly more socio-economic trends worth discussing, yet the purpose
of this article is to consider capitalist crisis not from the standpoint
of labor, but rather, from the standpoint of capital. To continue this
task, I would like to briefly return to Tombazos' work, as some of its
conclusions are in contradiction with Kliman's, with potential
implications for how to explain our contemporary capitalist crisis'
relationship to both production, speculation, and federal monetary
policy. Synthesizing Tombazos' incursion In Global Crisis and the
Reproduction of Capital (2019), Tombazos argues that neoliberalization
saved the falling rate of profit, even if it accepted a slower growth
rate compared to the era of industrialization. He suggests neoliberalism
can be best understood as the achievement of financialization,
privatization, and especially, increasing the rate of exploitation
(through lower wages and higher taxes for the working class, tax cuts
for the rich and a gutting of public programs, and an increase in the
distribution of profit going to executive wages and shareholder
dividends). As noted above, a number of other Marxist economists reject
this thesis, arguing that even with all these moves, the [**aggregate**
rate of **profit** still trends **downward**]{.underline} (there may
still be plenty of instances of certain corporations and industries
reaching 'record profits', while at the same time the total rate of
profit for social capital continues to decrease). The debate on falling
rates of profit ultimately depends on how you measure it and what you
count as profit (for example, whether you make a distinction between
profits and surplus values, between profits and wealth, between
financial gains and profits, or between financial profits and
non-financial profits), but it is at least generally accepted in Marxist
circles, Tombazos and Kliman included, that the neoliberal era itself
emerged because of falling rates from the mid-1950s to early '80s, and
further, that **[financialization]{.underline}** has been one of the
[key **tools** for **stalling** the great **arrythmia** in
**capitalism**]{.underline} created by the devolution of Fordism and the
emergence of the 3rd industrial revolution (electronics and information
technologies). In an attempt to reinvigorate the growth rate of capital,
[financial de-regulation]{.underline} was [pursued]{.underline} to
[allow for greater **built** up of **loan** capital]{.underline} and
[**speculative** activity]{.underline}. Over time, a disproportional
[**shift** in the composition]{.underline} of social
**[capital]{.underline}** led to a new kind of crisis, "the crisis of
the capitalist reaction and neoliberal response to the crisis of the
1970s" (Tombazos 2019: 84). This disproportional shift is best
represented by an [increasing **gap** between **money** capital
growth]{.underline} and constant capital growth ([growth of **means** of
**production**). Too much **profit**]{.underline}, Tombazos argues, is
[**staying** within]{.underline} the money capital circuit, within the
[financial **markets**, unwilling to venture out]{.underline} into
[**productive** development]{.underline}. Ultimately, although Tombazos
(2019: 84) argues against many Marxists that the aggregate rate of
profit is not falling, he still agrees with them that there is a
slowdown in productive growth because of a slowdown in production
profitability. Furthermore, he still insists that 'the current crisis is
just the most serious episode of the same long-term downward wave that
began in the 1970s'. It is worth providing a few datapoints on this
long-term downward wave, gleaned from researchers such as Tombazos,
Sizzoko, Vighi, and Ted Reese. The 'everything bubble': some datapoints
on capitalism's crisis According to Tombazos (2019: 65), 'In 1980, the
assets of money capital were roughly equal to world GDP \[total money
value of commodities\], while in 2010 they were four times as high'.
This trend of the 1980--2010 period of an increasing gap between money
capital and commodity capital is followed by the fact that, 'Never
before in post-war history, perhaps in the whole of peacetime capitalist
history, has there been such a long-term and at the same time [general
**stagnation** of labour **productivity**]{.underline} in the developed
world as in the period 2008--2018' (Tombazos 2019: 84). Researching the
same year as Tombazos, Sissoko (2019: 330) argues that this [long-term
'**savings gut'**]{.underline} -- that is, the [excess amount of money
**not** in **industrial** circulation]{.underline} -- 'is best
[**understood** as an investment **famine'**]{.underline}, marked by a
[**relationship** between **stagnation**]{.underline} and the
'[structural **illiquidity** of the modern **marketbased** financial
**system'**]{.underline}. The structural illiquidity arises out of a
financial system that structurally [supports]{.underline} the attempts
by [money capitalists to reroute capital gains away **productive**
investment]{.underline} and [**toward** the **purchasing** of
bonds]{.underline} and [other **assets** that may be **collateralized**
for financial **speculation**]{.underline}. Importantly, capitalist
economies dominated by this manner of [speculative finance **generate**
bubbles between financial pricing, expected profits, and the real
economy]{.underline}. In agreement with the likes of Harvey and Vighi,
Tombazos insists that fictitious capitalization guides this process. As
he (Tombazos 2019: 82) notes: Fictitious capital . . . play\[s\] a
decisive role in the growth rate of GDP that preceded the current
structural crisis, by suppressing the symptoms of the divergence between
the rhythm of valorization of value \[production of surplus values\] and
the 'sustainable' rhythm of realization of value \[realization of
profits\]. The 'bubble', accelerating the rhythm of realization, was a
precondition for the moderate performance of economic activity before
the crisis. Marxists argue that such methods were leaned into in the
1970s and 1980s, and continue to dominate, precisely because of the
profitability risk in further developing production. It is a trend,
then, that actively undermines productive capital accumulation, while at
the same time creating and blowing up bubbles due to [**hyper-inflated**
values of financial **assets**]{.underline}. And yet, without bubbles,
the reproduction of capital would struggle to sustain itself at a
satisfactory rate. At this conjuncture, the [**role** of **monetary**
policy]{.underline} becomes essential. As Tombazos (2019: 82) argues:
\[N\]eoliberal reproduction of capital [survives on '**technical**
breathing **support'**]{.underline}, that is with the support of
monetary policies that [**create** new '**bubbles'**]{.underline}. The
monetary policy of the [central banks]{.underline} (and mainly US fiscal
policy) [**maintains** it **artificially**]{.underline}, but
[without]{.underline} ensuring satisfactory rates of accumulation of
[industrial capital]{.underline} or GDP growth and with side effects
that may soon take the form of new major crises of finance capital, that
is, crises of the financial system and [**recessions** of the '**real**
economy']{.underline}. To establish how this bears out in the numbers,
Ted Reese (2022) sums it up well in recalling the 'everything bubble':
The third 'one-in-100-year' financial bubble in three decades (following
the 2000-01 dot com bubble and the 2007-09 housing bubble) engulfing the
world economy has been labeled 'the everything bubble' since it
encompasses every asset (debt) class for the first time, especially
short- and now long-term government bonds . . . Official stock market
capitalization (the value of publicly-traded stocks) as a percentage of
nominal GDP in the US peaked at 199% in November 2021 . . . the previous
highs having been 140.5% in March 2000; 101% in November 2007; and 90%
in August 1929. This 'everything bubble' has reached such enormous
heights that some have grown concerned that Schumpeter's (1942)
'creative destruction' thesis no longer seems encouraging or tenable.
With a sense of urgency, Vighi (2017: 23) asks us: Is not the ubiquitous
reluctance of policy makers to allow the finance and sovereign debt
bubbles to burst, i.e. the [**destruction** of '**bad
assets'**]{.underline} to run its course as a [**prerequisite** for
**productive** investment]{.underline} and renewed growth, a telltale
sign for the rampant premonition that the days of 'creative
destructions' might be numbered and that 'scorched earth' could be the
more apt metaphor for economic crisis in the twenty-first century? To
summarize, Tombazos, Kliman, Vighi, and Reese all argue, despite their
differences, that economic growth today relies on federal monetary
policies that encourage bubbles while at the same time establishing
themselves as savors amid crises caused by said bubbles -- savors on the
side of capital, of course. An accumulation of memories of [the state
**bailing** **out**]{.underline} finance capital only further
[**incentivizes** the bankers' **speculative** activities]{.underline},
with states all but tattooing on their skin that some [banks are just
'too **big** to **fail'**]{.underline} and some [debt bubbles too big to
let crash]{.underline}. As Rosa Luxemburg (2003: 447) might ask if alive
and following the role of central banks today, how does the Federal
Reserve 'provide a solution to the conflict and aggravate it at the same
time?'

(**[EKC]{.underline}**) (Kuznets, 1955; Stern, 2004)Footnote2 and the
IPAT formulaFootnote3 [advocating for]{.underline} the possibility of [a
**green economy**]{.underline}. Such claims, [attempting to overcome
"limits to growth"]{.underline} (Meadows et al., 1972) or the "spaceship
earth" (Boulding, 1966) claustrophobia, [have been **contested**
by]{.underline} many [scholars]{.underline} and the ecological economics
community (Martinez-Alier, 1995, 2012). [Affluence]{.underline},
[capital accumulation]{.underline} (Hornborg, 1998, 2009), and
[accumulation by **dispossession**]{.underline} (Harvey, 2004) indeed
occupy a significant role in [**shaping** our interactions
between]{.underline} socio-economic [systems and **the
environment**]{.underline} (Scheidel et al., 2018). Materials and energy
flows (Fischer-Kowalski & Amann, 2001) help self-organize, maintain and
develop internal functions and structures of societies forming the
backbone of our societal metabolisms (Giampietro et al., 2011; Şorman,
2014). Nevertheless, [societal metabolisms]{.underline} have associated
socio-ecological interdependencies, mostly stemming [from the unequal
distribution of ecological goods and services]{.underline}
(Martínez-Alier, 2002). Studies indicate that even if the metabolisms of
industrial countries were kept stable at 2000 levels, for the rest of
the world to catch up would result in [a **quadrupling** of global
**emissions** by 2050]{.underline} (Fischer-Kowalski et al., 2011).
Moreover, the evolution of the global North-South (McGregor & Hill,
2009) divide has reinforced [commodity chains and extraction
frontiers]{.underline} (Martinez-Alier et al., 2010), manifestations of
exploitative labour and trade relationships (Hornborg, 2020) surfacing
via contentious political processes and powerful multilateral
institutions. Therefore, as previously argued, the win-win promise of a
"**[sustainability]{.underline}**" scenario of letting humankind "have
our cake and eat it" (Rees, 1990, p. 435) [has **not** been
**achieved**]{.underline} in the last 30 years, despite all goodwill and
green growth promises with a decoupling intent.

The decoupling debate reappeared over the years in the form of
eco-efficiency, eco-innovation, and the circular economy, fostering
sustainable consumption, especially relevant in the European Union's
Action Plans (EU Circular Economy Action Plan, 2020). The European Green
Deal (EGD),Footnote4 for example, aims to radically transform economic
activities to make substantial progress towards creating a circular
economy. However, [**full circularity** is **unattainable** since there
is **entropic decay** in materials]{.underline}, as discussed in further
detail in Sect. 15.4. Moreover, the same notion is engraved within
[the]{.underline} Sustainable Development Goals ([SDGs]{.underline}),
where "Decent Work and Economic Growth" (Goal 8) (United Nations, 2020),
although inclusive and sustainable in principle, base their premise on
an ever-increasing pie of economic growth. However, the Barcelona School
of ecological economics has long contested that [developing]{.underline}
growth-oriented policies around the expectation that
**[decoupling]{.underline}** is or will be possible [has
been]{.underline} a **[misleading]{.underline}** policy while also
criticising the use of GDP as a proxy for well-being (Ward et al.,
2016). Recently, Hickel and Kallis (2020) have once again claimed that
green growth is a misguided objective; that absolute decoupling from
carbon emissions is highly unlikely to be achieved at a rate rapid
enough to prevent global warming over 1.5 °C or 2 °C, even under
favourable policy conditions.

In essence, decoupling has a foundational role within the Barcelona
School of Ecological Economics and Political Ecology. First, due to the
[**lack of evidence** in absolute decoupling between resource and energy
dependency and growth]{.underline} (Parrique et al., 2019), [there is a
**crucial** need to look at]{.underline} "how the world operates" and
rethink [**alternative** pathways of **living**]{.underline} within
planetary boundaries. This calls for new ways of doing economics which
interrogates economic processes limited by [**biophysical constraints**
both on]{.underline} the [supply side in terms]{.underline} of
[**resources** and]{.underline} the sink side recognising environmental
**[limits]{.underline}** from the local to the global. Second,
[decoupling]{.underline} (and its lack thereof) [calls for]{.underline}
scrutinising embedded societal relations that interrogate "why we do
what we do" that cover socio-political factors such as [power dynamics,
institutional arrangements, cultural variables, and]{.underline}
economic and [financial drivers]{.underline}. These questions also
explore the unequal access to and distribution of goods and services,
benefits, and burdens (Robbins, 2011) while inquiring into
[participation and **decision**-making **mechanisms**]{.underline} over
how the [world's **resources** are (un)used]{.underline}. Third, the
absence of decoupling also calls for deliberation over individual and
collective action on "how we envision alternative imaginaries" in post
normal times (Funtowicz & Ravetz, 1993). This means creating spaces and
opening up the discussion for new actors and different futures departing
from the business as usual growth-based scenarios.

Along my academic journey -- deeply rooted in the Barcelona school
Ecological Economics and Political Ecology -- I try to scrutinise these
notions of decoupling, having closely worked on energy metabolism, the
study of energy flows that are required to sustain societies; energy
justice calling for a re-evaluation of ethical and gender concerns in
energy decision making and my research on energy cultures, delving
deeper on role individual and collective behaviour toward energy in
transformational research and action.

In the remainder of this chapter, Sect. 15.2 focuses on the different
concepts of decoupling and system boundaries; Sect. 15.3 reviews and
synthesises further empirical evidence that analyses trends of
decoupling both in terms of resources and emissions; Sect. 15.4 dissects
claims for a circular economy and rebound effects, a phenomenon closely
observed during the COVID-19 global pandemic that goes hand in hand with
the decoupling narrative; Sect. 15.5 wraps up the discussion of
[**decoupling** as a **deceitful narrative** that is prolonged as a
persistent myth]{.underline} hindering genuine systemic and
transformative change.

2 Different Decoupling Concepts and Accounting Mechanisms

Decoupling is typically categorised based on environmental pressures
stemming from the production side, referring to resource decoupling
including materials, energy, and the less obvious water; and the impact
side of our actions framed around impact decoupling including greenhouse
gasses, land, water pollutants, and biodiversity loss (Parrique et al.,
2019).

[Relative]{.underline} (or weak) [decoupling]{.underline} indicates that
the rate at which materials, energy use, or emissions increase is lower
than the rate at which GDP increases (Burton, 2015), or in other terms
that the economic growth outpaces environmental impact. Although this
may seem like a favourable veneer, it still [maps out as
extractivism]{.underline} or greenhouse gases accumulating in the
atmosphere, beating our overall target to tackle climate change and live
within our ecological boundaries in the long run. Already, the UNEP
emissions gap report indicates (UNEP, 2019) that now in 2020, [we need
to **reduce emissions** by]{.underline} [7.6%]{.underline} per annum
globally every year until 2030; [otherwise]{.underline}, limiting global
[warming]{.underline} to 1.5 °C [will be]{.underline} a
[missed]{.underline} chance (see also (Patterson et al., 2018)).
Similarly, the Production Gap Report (SEI et al., 2019), assessing the
world's current pace of fossil fuel extraction to align with Paris
Agreement goals, indicates that [the world is to produce far **more
coal, oil, and gas**]{.underline} than is consistent with limiting
warming to 1.5 °C or 2 °C, creating a \"production gap\" that makes
climate goals much harder to reach.

[Absolute]{.underline} (or strong) [decoupling]{.underline}, on the
other hand, [claims]{.underline} that economic [performance behaves
independently from]{.underline} material or energy
[extraction]{.underline} or emissions. Newer terms extending the
potential boundaries and glossary definitions of decoupling have also
been defined such as "virtual decoupling" (Moreau & Vuille, 2018)
referring to developed [**countries outsourcing** intensive]{.underline}
industrial **[production]{.underline}** chains to lesser developed
countries, also known as the **[carbon leakage]{.underline}** phenomena.
The role of increased "[tertiarization]{.underline}" (or
[dematerialization]{.underline} through services) (Heiskanen & Jalas,
2000) as a complementary angle also shifts attention given to emissions,
with the know-how (immaterial) sectors occupying a greater weight in the
composition of the more \"developed\" economies. Vadén et al. (2020)
also argue that relationships between resources and emissions decoupling
might not be so straightforward and linear; such that there may be
instances of material efficiency (Schandl et al., 2016) or a boost in
"financialisation" (the role and weight of the financial sphere within
the economy) (Kovacic et al., 2018), which may all lead to somewhat
decoupling with very different implications.

In terms of accounting for impact, [discussions center around
shifting]{.underline} current [accounting]{.underline} mechanisms
[from]{.underline} one based on territorial [emissions]{.underline}
(production-based accounting with GHG emissions assigned based on the
source localisation) [to]{.underline} one based on a consumption-based
[accounting]{.underline} (CBA) (Lininger, 2015; Davis & Caldeira, 2010;
Peters, 2008; Munksgaard & Pedersen, 2001). CBA, initially used for
Carbon Footprint measurements (Ireland, 2018), takes into account the
outsourcing effect (Bastianoni et al., 2014); somewhat internalising
responsibilities based on [re-integrating
**externalities**]{.underline}. It is often argued that CBA should be
mainstreamed in climate policy for **[disclosing "real"]{.underline}**
corresponding **[emissions]{.underline}** per country as it will serve
for constructing policies with a holistic perspective for crucial
innovations (Wiedenhofer et al., 2020) for tackling the global climate
emergency and ecological crisis. Approximate [numbers
indicate]{.underline} that [production]{.underline}-based emissions [in
the Global South are]{.underline} 10--15% [higher than
consumption]{.underline}-based emissions, and [vice versa for the Global
North]{.underline} (Fuhr, 2019). Similarly, research illustrates (Wood
et al., 2018) that approximately one-quarter of the global land use
(Weinzettel et al., 2013), 40% of materials (Wiedmann et al., 2015),
20--30% of global water use (Lenzen et al., 2013), and over 20% of
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Peters & Hertwich, 2008) reside embodied
in trade.

In terms of "truth-ful" accounting and defining adequate policy
mechanisms based on political realities (Afionis et al., 2017) for
tackling issues of equity and justice appropriately and for proposing
alternative exit strategies, such [realities must]{.underline} urgently
[be confronted.]{.underline}

3 Results from [**Empirical Evidence** and Reviews]{.underline}

Recent literature [argues]{.underline} that there is [little or
**no**]{.underline} evidence in terms of [absolute **decoupling**
looking into]{.underline} embodied [energy in trade, material
consumption, resource use, and emissions]{.underline}.

Akizu-Gardoki et al. (2018) devise an alternative "[Decoupling
Index]{.underline}" that [uses]{.underline} 126 countries' total primary
**[energy footprints]{.underline}** (rather than total primary energy
supplies), [taking into account embodied energy
**imported**]{.underline} with goods and services. Within a 14-year
period of analysis (2000--2014), [the authors]{.underline} empirically
[show]{.underline} that [**93 countries disprove**
decoupling]{.underline}; while 27 show absolute decoupling for the
analysis period, with [only **6**]{.underline} countries (ESP, ITA, HUN,
GBR, JPN, and FRA) with a Human Development Index of 0.8 above
**[maintain]{.underline}** absolute [decoupling]{.underline} over time
(ibid.).

Regarding global material flows covering over half a century of analysis
(1950--2010) Schaffartzik et al. (2014) reveal that [although industrial
**metabolic profiles** stabilize over time]{.underline} with equal
shares of biomass, fossil energy, and construction minerals; [they **are
surpassed** by other regions]{.underline} like Asia, replicating
patterns of industrial growth engines. However, this does not translate
into \"per capita\" affluence or material consumption and instead adds
to the growing bubble of global resource use and extraction (ibid.). On
a similar note, after an analysis of 40 years of resource productivity
analysis Krausmann et al. (2017) summarise that [**although some**
countries may be **decoupling**]{.underline} in absolute terms,
[this]{.underline} value [is **cancelled out** when **trade** is taken
into account.]{.underline} Wood et al. (2018) confirm that
[impacts]{.underline} embodied in trade, especially regarding material
goods, led by clothing and footwear[, are **growing
tremendously**]{.underline}, with [energy and GHG **emissions
following**]{.underline} in a less pronounced manner. Wu et al. (2018)
highlight the differences in a decoupling index, where "[developed
countries]{.underline}" primarily continue to [develop high-tech and
high-efficiency GDP growt]{.underline}h drivers, whereas "developing
countries" have not undergone a transformation to absolute decoupling
due to a lack in energy efficiency measures, disorganised industrial
structures, and absence of Information Technologies (IT) in capital
investment. These studies highlight a threefold causality: (1) we have
[lengthened commodity supply chains]{.underline} due to the abundance of
readily available transport fuel; (2) this has been made possible
[by]{.underline} notably [shifting and **outsourcing**]{.underline} more
significant [impacts]{.underline} to developing regions that take on
primary extractive and secondary industries; (3) meanwhile, we have
bought into the promise of circularity regarding the reuse of materials.
Hass et al. (2015) illustrate that circularity is low mainly because
most materials are not available for recycling in the first place and
that the growth of materials injection into our systems outpaces any
potential recycling attempt (See Sect. 15.4 for more details).

Similarly, recently conducted reviews of empirical research conclude no
robust evidence regarding decoupling. (For an exhaustive literature
review of decoupling literature, see Parrique et al., 2019; Koirala et
al., 2011; Mardani et al., 2019 among others). The Decoupling Debunked
document (Parrique et al., 2019) concludes that there is no indication
of decoupling that is absolute, global, permanent, and sufficiently fast
and large enough both in terms of resources or impacts. Likewise, a
[**review** of 179 decoupling articles]{.underline} (Vadén et al., 2020)
that appeared between 1990 and 2019 **[concluded]{.underline}** with [no
evidence]{.underline} of economy-wide, national/international absolute
resource decoupling and reckons that "the goal of **[decoupling
rests]{.underline}** partly **[on faith]{.underline}**." A recent
exhaustive review, composed of a bibliometric mapping of [835
peer-reviewed]{.underline} **[articles]{.underline}** (published in two
parts, part I (Wiedenhofer et al., 2020) and part II (Haberl et al.,
2020)) also [highlight]{.underline} the [need for]{.underline}
substantial advances in both theoretical and empirical research required
while also being complemented by [alternative goals]{.underline} and
ambitions.

With unsuccessful robust and systemic evidence, reaffirming the findings
of Hickel and Kallis (2020), [absolute decoupling]{.underline} from
resource use **[cannot be achieved]{.underline}** on a global scale
against a global scale backdrop of continued economic growth.

In terms of accounting for emissions decoupling, a recent study by the
Breakthrough Institute (Hausfather, 2021) highlights that 32 countries
have managed to demonstrate economic growth while CO2 emissions declined
since 2005, even when accounting for emissions embodied in the goods
consumed in a country. However, they note with caution that these
economies are already wealthy-service driven economies and that very few
examples are present from low- or middle-income countries based on
extractive industries and energy-intensive manufacturing to date. While
this study can present a departure narrative of consumption-based
emissions and absolute decoupling as we switch to clearer technologies,
we must not forget that extraction and resource dependence remain intact
on the supply side -- supplies and sinks being the two sides of the same
coin of the decoupling phenomena.

4 [The "Not-So-Circular" Economy]{.underline} and Rebound Effects

[The]{.underline} industrial **[economy]{.underline}** is not as
circular as claims make it be; but rather **[is entropic]{.underline}**
(Georgescu-Roegen, 1971) with the [**depletion** of low entropy
materials from the environment,]{.underline} **[resulting
in]{.underline}** an [accumulation of]{.underline} high entropy
[**waste**s and exotic materials]{.underline} in the environment (Daly,
1992; Kerschner, 2010). This, also highlighted in a review of decoupling
literature by Wiedenhofer et al. (2020), is frequently disregarded in
decoupling studies, where the phenomena itself is usually approached
from a statistical/econometric viewpoint, often overlooking
thermodynamic principles of energy and materials and their core role and
function in defining societal metabolisms.

As Haas et al. (2015) show, on a global metabolism, [**only 6%**
of]{.underline} all processed [materials are **recycled**,
against]{.underline} the backdrop of global [material
consumption]{.underline} increasing by 3.6% in a decade (Schaffartzik et
al., 2014). These numbers only slightly improve for the European Union
amidst convincing circular economy narratives (Haas et al., 2015). Over
half of the total solid material [throughput]{.underline} in economies
(52% or 3.5 GT/year) (Giampietro & Funtowicz, 2020) is composed of
either [food or energy]{.underline} inputs that are [subject
to]{.underline} entropic **[decay]{.underline}** (especially in terms of
energy quality). Only when biomass is included among the recycled solid
flows, total circularity only increases to 37% (Haas et al., 2015).
[The]{.underline} remaining 45% of [materials that]{.underline} are used
[form the backbones]{.underline} of social [**systems**,
becoming]{.underline} infrastructure and construction and
"**[immovable]{.underline}**s" of societies; while only a minute percent
of material flow, 3% or 0.7 GT/year, is associated with consumable and
durable products (Giampietro & Funtowicz, 2020). Moreover, all of these
[social structures]{.underline} and metabolisms [come at the **expense
of** ecosystem **services**]{.underline} at our disposal (Costanza et
al., 2017), with [water **throughput** often ignored]{.underline} in
stabilising socio-ecological systems (Giampietro & Funtowicz, 2020).

The COVID-19 pandemic and confinement period has also been an occasion
to observe decoupling and rebounds (Alcott, 2005; Polimeni, 2012) within
societies adjusting to a dramatic, involuntary downscaling of
socio-economic activities due to global lockdowns. In April 2020, in
comparison to 2019 values, daily global CO2 emissions had decreased by
around 17% (Le Quéré et al., 2020). Values exhibited in the peak low of
emissions during COVID-19 were equal to those corresponding to 2006
values -- 14 years ago (Canadell et al., 2020). However, several months
after, studies detected a [rapid rebound]{.underline} (Harvey, 2020),
and in 2021 global [energy]{.underline}-related CO2 [**emissions** are
projected to **grow**]{.underline} once again by 4.8% (IEA, 2021). It is
often argued that [decoupling is bound by temporal features]{.underline}
such that decoupling is usually followed by periods of [no decoupling or
even **recoupling**]{.underline}, making it [a **challenge** for
becoming a permanent and continuous matter]{.underline} (Vadén et al.,
2020; Williamson, 2021). The notion of rebound is also captured where in
some instances, the very act of solving environmental problems in itself
spends resources and may even create additional problems that were
previously unthinkable (Allen et al., 2003).

The Carbon Tracker Initiative, a London-based think tank serving the
energy industry, reports that the steep [decline in the price of
generating **solar** and **wind** energy]{.underline} "will inevitably
[lead to **trillions** of dollars of **stranded assets** across the
corporate sector and hit petro-states that fail to reinvent]{.underline}
themselves," [while]{.underline} "[putting trillions at risk for unsavvy

storage facilities, energy generation plants, backup power plants,
petrochemical processing facilities, and industries]{.underline} tightly
[coupled to the fossil fuel]{.underline} culture. Behind the scenes, a
seismic struggle is taking place as four of the principal sectors
responsible for global warming---the Information and Communications
Technology (ICT)/telecommunications sector, the power and electric
utility sector, the mobility and logistics sector, and the buildings
sector---are beginning to decouple from the fossil fuel industry in
favor of adopting the cheaper new green energies. The result is that
within the fossil fuel industry, "around [\$**100 trillion** of assets
could be 'carbon stranded.']{.underline}"20 [The carbon bubble is the
**largest economic bubble in history**]{.underline}. And studies and
reports over the past twenty-four months---from within the global

#### Financialization ensures [inevitable]{.underline} collapse -- causes crisis because companies overinflate short-term growth over long-term

The first problem is that [the financial sector has largely been
financing itself.]{.underline} Most finance goes back into finance,
insurance and real estate rather than into productive uses. The acronym
for this is FIRE (finance, insurance, real estate) -- appropriate in the
sense that it is burning the foundations on which long-term economic
growth rests. In the USA and the UK, only about a fifth of finance goes
into the productive economy (such as companies that want to innovate,
infrastructure that needs building). And in the UK, 10 per cent of all
UK bank lending helps non-financial firms; the rest supports real estate
and financial assets.18 In 1970 real estate lending constituted about 35
per cent of all bank lending in advanced economies; by 2007 the figure
had risen to about 60 per cent.19 The current structure of [finance thus
fuels a **debt-driven system** and speculative **bubbles** which, when
they burst, bring **banks** and others **begging** for government
bailouts]{.underline}. Some of these institutions are deemed 'too big to
fail', as were banks in the 2008--9 financial crisis: if they failed,
the entire system would come crashing down with them. So the banks got
the bailouts: FIRE profits are private; FIRE losses are public. Bailing
out the banks involved '[**moral hazard'** because, being judged **too
important to fail**, they lived with an implicit **government**
guarantee which tempted them to take **excessive** risks without having
fully to face the consequences if their bets went wrong.]{.underline}

Business is focusing on quarterly returns

The second problem is that business itself has become financialized. In
recent decades, finance has generally grown faster than the economy and,
within non-financial sectors, [financial activities and their
accompanying **attitudes** have come to dominate **business**. An ever
greater share of corporate profits has been used to boost **short- term
gains** in stock prices rather than provide **long-term
investmen**t]{.underline} in areas like new capital equipment, R&D and
worker training: skills are insufficiently developed, too many jobs are
'McJobs' and insecure, and wages stay low.20 Indeed, one of the reasons
for the high level of private debt in the USA and the UK -- driven by a
form of capitalism that is aimed at maximizing the returns to
shareholders, not all stakeholders -- is that many workers need to take
on debt to maintain their living standards but cannot earn enough to
reduce or pay it off.21 But, unfortunately, the problem goes even
further in

Scandinavia, where [**deregulation** of the financial sector has also
led to a rise in **private debt**]{.underline} (also due to home equity
withdrawal-based consumption) [and overinvestment in **FIRE**
sectors.]{.underline}22

By purchasing its own shares, a corporation can artificially boost its
stock price and that of its executives, who are paid in these stocks. In
just the ten years to 2019, total buybacks by the Fortune 500 (an annual
list of the 500 biggest US companies compiled by Fortune magazine,
measured by revenues) exceeded nearly \$4 trillion, with many companies
spending over 100 per cent of their net income on a combination of
buybacks and dividend pay- outs, thus raiding their capital reserves.
Over the same period, six of America's biggest airlines spent an average
of 96 per cent of their free cash flow on stock buybacks -- the aircraft
manufacturer Boeing spent 74 per cent of its free cash flow on stock
buybacks -- which didn't deter these companies from asking for federal
government help when the COVID-19 crisis struck.23

The excuse often heard from business for doing this is that there are no
'opportunities for investment'. But, given that the greatest buybackers
are in industries where opportunities clearly exist -- pharmaceuticals
and energy -- this is unconvincing. Are there really no opportunities
for innovation in antibiotics or treatments for tropical diseases that
mostly affect poor people in developing countries, not to mention
vaccines? (This question became particularly pertinent with the arrival
of COVID-19.) Are there really no opportunities for aircraft
manufacturers to invest in renewable energy and other green
technologies? The chief culprit is a form of corporate governance
obsessed with 'maximization of shareholder value' -- essentially,
maximizing stock prices. Even Jack Welch, the late CEO of General
Electric, one of America's biggest companies, later in life called
shareholder value 'the dumbest idea in the world'. He explained:
'Shareholder value is a result, not a strategy \... Your main
constituencies are your employees, your customers and your products.
Managers and investors should not set share price increases as their
overarching goal \... Short-term profits should be allied with an
increase in the long-term value of a company.'24

In practice, [maximizing shareholder value has often involved loading
companies with **debt** -- a supposedly efficient model which leverages
a company's capital base -- with the **risk** that the company is
dangerously exposed to **unexpected** turns of events]{.underline},
[such as a **pandemic** or a market **downturn**]{.underline}. In 2017,
for example, the USA suffered a severe retail slump. The
long-established US retailer Toys 'R' Us went into liquidation. It had
been acquired in 2005 by two private equity firms, Bain Capital and
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, and a real estate firm, Vornado Realty Trust.
To buy the company they used the usual private equity formula, saddling
it with debt to increase the return later.25 Indeed, company debt rose
soon after the takeover from \$1.86 billion to nearly \$5 billion. By
2007 debt interest payments were 97 per cent of the company's operating
profit. The retail slump of the following years was severe, but the high
debt burden imposed on Toys 'R' Us impaired its ability to adapt and
increased its vulnerability to the downturn.26 [The excessive
**financialization** of companies and remorseless **pursuit** of
shareholder value has left many other major companies open to similar
charges of **moral hazard**]{.underline}: ingenious financial structures
benefit owners more than other stakeholders such as workers, suppliers
and customers -- let alone the wider communities in which companies
operate.

The EV transition is, in short, a massive industrial project.
[Electrification of roads and rail will require upgraded smart grids,
complex routes connected to high power lines, and regular battery-swap
stations]{.underline}. The paper explores several scenarios to explore
how such a transition would take place. 

In a continuing GDP growth scenario, the authors note that [the economy
begins to **stagnate** "due to **peak oil limits** at around
2025-2040,"]{.underline} but GDP is able to continue growing thanks to
the EV transition. This shows that the reduction in liquid fuels in
transportation can play a powerful role in avoiding "energy shortages in
the economy as a whole." 

But then [the economy hits the limits of mineral and material production
to sustain this electric transition---in just **three
decades**]{.underline}. And [this is **even with** high levels of
**minerals recycling**]{.underline}.

By 2050, in this scenario, [the EV transition will "require higher
amounts of copper, lithium and manganese than current
reserves]{.underline}. For the cases of [copper and manganese the
depletion is mainly due to the demand from the rest of the
economy]{.underline}," but most lithium demand "is for EV batteries,"
and [this alone "**depletes** its estimated **global
reserves**]{.underline}."

[Mineral depletion takes place even with "a very high increase in
recycling rates"]{.underline} in a continuing GDP growth scenario.  

In one such scenario, the authors apply what they consider to be
[realistic upper level recycling rates of 57 percent, 30 percent and 74
percent to copper, lithium and manganese respectively]{.underline}.
These are based on **[extremely optimistic projections]{.underline}** of
recycling capabilities relative to their costs.  

But still they find that [even these high recycling rates **wouldn't
prevent depletion** of all current estimated reserves by
2050]{.underline}. The [conclusion corroborates findings of other
studies, estimating an expected **bottleneck for lithium** by 2042-2045
and **for manganese** by 2038-2050]{.underline}.  

[Actual bottlenecks could **come even earlier** because existing
studies]{.underline}---including the MEDEAS model---[don't account for
material requirements needed for internal wiring, the EV motor, EV
chargers, building and maintaining the grid to connect and charge EV
batteries]{.underline}, the catenaries to electrify the railways, [as
well as inherent difficulties in recycling metals]{.underline}. 

#### [Kaya identity --]{.underline} economic growth [impedes transition]{.underline}. Every increase in growth [demands]{.underline} more renewables -- transition and growth are mutually exclusive.

Economic Policies for Sustainability and Resilience, p. 45-90\]

The first question is more physical in nature. The second question
relates to the concept of 'decoupling', which is core to the idea of
green growth. [If '**absolute decoupling**' is achieved, the **economy**
can grow while using]{.underline} fewer physical [resources]{.underline}
and [leading to less **environmental degradation**]{.underline}.
Historical [analyses have shown]{.underline} that [absolute decoupling
is possible in some countries at certain times]{.underline} (Hickel &
Kallis, 2020). [It is **less clear**, however, if it is possible at
**global level** over a **sustained period**]{.underline} of time.
[Current data show **no supporting evidence** for global absolute
decoupling]{.underline}, although this could reflect that the policies
that would enable green growth have never seriously been attempted (van
de Bergh, 2011).

We first discuss the immediate concerns around climate change and then
broaden the discussion to consider a wider sustainability context.

3.2 Climate Change and the Immediate Threat

In 2015, the Paris Agreement on climate agreed to limit global average
temperature increases to 'well below 2 °C' above pre-industrial levels,
and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C. These
targets in temperature change are arbitrary but reflect the
precautionary principle based on Weitzman's (2009) dismal theorem, which
was also expressed previously in Meadows et al. (1972, p. 81). The
theorem states that beyond these boundaries, there is a non-zero risk of
catastrophic change and we should do all that we reasonably can to avoid
this risk. This formulation acknowledges uncertainty and replaces
previous attempts by neoclassical economists to use crude cost--benefit
analysis to estimate the optimal amount of global warming. The
neoclassical economists' approach is now largely discredited (Ackerman,
2017, chapter 2; Keen, 2020; Pindyck, 2013; Stern, 2016).

The degree of [temperature change is determined by the]{.underline}
stock of [**greenhouse gases** in the atmosphere]{.underline}. Given the
long lifetime of the main greenhouse gas, CO2, to limit climate change
we must eventually either reduce new emissions of CO2 to zero or find a
way to remove an equivalent amount of emissions from the atmosphere
(described as 'net-zero' emissions). The degree of climate change based
on the stock of emissions is itself uncertain, but [it is
likely]{.underline} that the target of **[net-zero]{.underline}**
emissions [will need to be attained shortly after **2050** at the
**latest**]{.underline} (IPCC, 2018, chapter 2).

[The majority of]{.underline} CO2 [emissions result from **energy
consumption** and it is **not feasible** to reduce energy consumption to
zero without **reverting** to a primitive society]{.underline}. Hence,
we must rely on technological change and a decoupling of GDP and
emissions to meet the targets. Fortunately, many of the technologies
required for the decoupling already exist, and some (e.g. solar and wind
power, or electric vehicles) are becoming cheaper than the alternatives
that produce CO2. [The question]{.underline} to explore [is]{.underline}
thus [whether]{.underline} these [technologies can be **rolled out fast
enough**, and whether continued **economic growth** is an **impediment**
to doing so]{.underline}.

Underlying this discussion is [the Kaya identity]{.underline} in Eq. 1
below (Kaya & Yokobori, 1998), which [states]{.underline} that [the
**total level** of CO2 emissions is the mathematical product of
population]{.underline} (POP), [per capita GDP]{.underline} (GDP/POP),
the [energy intensity of production]{.underline} (Energy/GDP) [and the
carbon intensity of energy]{.underline} (CO2/Energy).

The Kaya identity

CO2=POP∗GDPPOP∗EnergyGDP∗CO2Energy (1)

A [similar]{.underline} relationship may be obtained [for non-energy and
non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions]{.underline}.

In the western world, [energy efficiency has improved]{.underline}
(notably in lighting) [in recent years, but most]{.underline} of the
[work of reducing emissions has fallen to]{.underline} the last term in
the equation, [the CO2 intensity of energy]{.underline}. Initially this
shift was driven by replacing coal-fired power plants with natural gas
plants (which are less CO2-intensive), but the gas plants themselves are
now being replaced with renewable technologies.

The CO2 intensity of renewables (in their use phase) is zero, which
renders the rest of the Kaya identity irrelevant. However, [there
are]{.underline} some **[sectors]{.underline}** such as aviation [where
there is currently **no renewable option**. There are also **industrial
processes** where CO2 is **released regardless** of the energy
source]{.underline} (i.e. in chemical reactions). [Most importantly, the
**pace** of the roll-out]{.underline} of renewables [must be balanced
against the ever-reducing '**carbon budget**']{.underline}, which is the
remaining space before the stock of emissions reaches levels above those
consistent with a 2 °C or 1.5 °C target.

[The **Kaya identity**]{.underline} therefore [remains important: a **1%
increase** in GDP offsets a **1% reduction** in carbon intensity,
effectively making the temperature targets **harder to meet**. To put it
another way, the more economic production]{.underline} that takes place,
[the more wind and solar]{.underline} installations are
[needed]{.underline} to power it.

The modelling in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's
(IPCC's) special report on the 1.5 °C target (IPCC, 2018, chapter 2)
showed that it was possible to meet 1.5 °C, while still growing the
global economy. However, although more advanced than the previous
cost--benefit approaches, [most]{.underline} of the [models]{.underline}
used in the report [still make strong assumptions about perfect
knowledge and rational behaviour. Such considerations are particularly
important when considering the **long lifetimes** of
**infrastructure**]{.underline} (e.g. buildings or roads) [that result
in CO2 **emissions**]{.underline}.

#### [Jevons Paradox]{.underline}. Increases in efficiency cause more emissions and resource use. 

**Conway '24** \[Ed Conway. Economics and data editor of Sky News,
London. "The Paradox Holding Back the Clean Energy Revolution", New York
Times, 2/22/24.
<https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/22/opinion/vegas-sphere-energy-efficiency.html>.\]

Yet [the amount of electricity we consume for light globally is roughly
the same today as it was in 2010]{.underline}. That's partly because of
population and economic growth in the developing world. But another big
reason is there on the Las Vegas Strip: Instead of merely replacing our
existing bulbs with LED alternatives, we have come up with ever more
extravagant uses for these ever-cheaper lights, from immersive LED art
installations and carpets that glow to basketball courts that can play
video. As technology has advanced, we've only grown more wasteful.

There's an economic term for this: the Jevons Paradox, named for the
19th-century English economist William Stanley Jevons, who noticed that
as steam engines became ever more efficient, Britain's appetite for coal
increased rather than decreased.

[We've known about]{.underline} the **[Jevons Paradox]{.underline}**
[for years, but it's becoming a]{.underline} **[more troubling problem
now]{.underline}** [that governments have pledged to eliminate their net
carbon emissions to slow global warming]{.underline}. A significant part
of that carbon reduction is expected to come from using more efficient
products, be they electric motors instead of internal combustion
engines, or LED lights instead of traditional bulbs. But the logic of
Jevons is that instead of banking the efficiency savings we make as
technology advances, we go out and spend it.

[Climate activists are dismayed by the Jevons Paradox,
since]{.underline} [fossil fuel companies]{.underline} **[invoke it as
an excuse to carry on]{.underline}** [digging and drilling. But we are
unlikely to achieve our climate goals until we acknowledge, and work
with, this feature of human nature.]{.underline}

Today, [you can see examples of the paradox everywhere. The]{.underline}
**[servers running the internet]{.underline}** [have become less
power-hungry but our use]{.underline} of them [has
**skyrocketed**]{.underline}. Refrigerators have become astoundingly
efficient in recent years (thanks mostly to clever compressors) --- so
much so that total energy consumption from refrigeration has halved
since the early 1980s, even as consumers installed ever bigger coolers.
Yet those clever, [efficient compressors are also used in
air-conditioning, and]{.underline} **[energy demand]{.underline}** [from
air-conditioning in homes, cars, offices and server farms]{.underline}
**[has ratcheted]{.underline}** [up over that period]{.underline}. The
upshot is that total energy consumption for cooling, more broadly
defined, stayed flat.

A few years ago economists at Cambridge University found that when
residents in England and Wales installed home insulation, their overall
heating energy demand soon rebounded, ending up at about the same level
it was before: The residents had apparently chosen to turn up their
thermostats and live in warmer homes.

The good news is that in some cases the efficiency gains are so great
that even our insatiable appetite for new stuff cannot completely negate
them. LEDs are improving at such a rate that despite structures like the
Sphere, commercial lighting demand in the United States remains lower
than it was a decade ago. Today's car engines require so little fuel
compared to their predecessors that although Americans on average now
drive longer distances in heavier cars, their gasoline consumption has
fallen.

In other words, consuming more doesn't always offset all those
technology improvements, as was the case in Jevons's time. Indeed,
there's evidence that as countries become wealthier, you see less of
this "rebound effect," as economists sometimes call these leaps in
consumption. Take the steel and copper surrounding us, in the cars we
drive and the wires in our buildings. For centuries, our appetite for
these metals rose rapidly, but in recent years, the per capita use of
steel and copper in most rich countries seems to have plateaued as we
became better at recycling and less hungry for expansion. At some point,
"enough" really is enough --- or nearly enough.

[The bad news is that the]{.underline} **[Jevons Paradox seems to be
hard-wired]{.underline}** [into us.]{.underline} There are [few
examples]{.underline} throughout history [of people willingly consuming
less energy]{.underline}, either for moral or environmental reasons.

[This brings us to the biggest problem of all.]{.underline} **[Nearly
every pathway]{.underline}** [for combating climate change and reducing
global carbon emissions]{.underline} **[assumes]{.underline}** [not only
that we shift to cleaner fuels but]{.underline} --- [and]{.underline}
this is the critical part --- [that global]{.underline} **[energy demand
actually falls.]{.underline}** [This is]{.underline} not just incredibly
ambitious; it's **[unprecedented]{.underline}**.

#### Global decarbonization stalled---transport emissions remain tightly coupled to economic growth, especially in developing countries---only 12 nations achieved absolute decoupling.

[**Only 12 countries achieved absolute decoupling** over the study
period. The remaining countries experienced either relative decoupling
or no decoupling. This implies that transport emissions in most
countries, including the top-emitting countries, are still increasing,
and that the growth of their emissions remains **strongly linked to
their economic growth**.]{.underline} Hence, to achieve decarbonization
in the transport sector without prejudice to economic growth, there is a
dire need to break this link. The long-term decoupling results show
considerable differences in the decoupling status among countries by
income levels. While many advanced economies have managed to achieve
absolute or relative decoupling, in [many developing countries per
capita transport emissions are increasing at a much faster rate than per
capita GDP growth. Increases in transport CO2 emissions were
particularly pronounced in the two **largest middle-income countries:
China and India**.]{.underline} Both are still contributing less to
global transport CO2 emissions than their population shares, unlike the
United States or the EU countries, but [they are rapidly catching up and
are to a **large extent driving current increases in global transport
CO2 emissions**.]{.underline}

#### Transport emissions rising---road dominates, growth in China and India outpaces efficiency---decoupling is rare and inadequate for climate goals.

In this section, we describe the results of the decoupling analyses, the
general pattern of transport-related CO2 emissions, and the results of
the regression analyses. [The descriptive statistics reveal that CO2
emissions of the transport sector account for 24 percent of global CO2
emissions, making the transport sector the second-largest contributor to
global CO2 emissions after the energy sector, which accounts for 42
percent of such emissions]{.underline}. Within the transport sector,
[road transportation is the predominant driver, accounting for 74
percent of all CO2 emissions]{.underline}; international sea transport
accounts for 9 percent, and international aviation accounts for 7
percent (Figure 1). The composition of global transport CO2 emissions by
mode has been fairly stable over time; the shares in 1990 were about the
same as those in 2018 (Figure A1). There is interesting variation
between income groups and regions; the CO2 emissions from road
transportation are slightly below the global average in high-income
countries, and above average in lower-middle and low-income countries
(Figure A3).

Figures 2a and 2b present the distribution of global transport CO2
emissions in terms of GDP and population by income group and major
emitting countries in 2018. The area of each rectangle represents the
contributions of a country/income group to total global transport
emissions. The rectangle\'s width represents the share of global GDP
(population), and the height represents transport emissions per unit of
GDP (population). Figure 2a suggests that the [countries with the most
carbon-intensive transport sectors are the Russian Federation, Brazil,
Mexico, and India. Excluding China, the transport sectors in
middle-income countries are more carbon intensive than those of
high-income countries.]{.underline} In terms of the fuel mix, Russia has
a high fraction of "other" fuels, composed of mainly natural gas,
compared to other countries and aggregates. The high share of biofuels
in Brazil's transportation-sector fuels also stands out.

Figure 2b provides additional insights on the global carbon footprint of
the transport sector. In 2018, the global average per capita emissions
from the transport sector were 1.09 ton of CO2. Per capita emissions in
the United States were five times the world average. [Per capita
emissions of other high-income countries were three times the world
average, and those from the EU countries were double the world
average.]{.underline} Although middle-income countries at that time had
relatively carbon-intensive transport sectors, their per capita
emissions were significantly lower than those of high-income countries.
[In absolute levels, the findings show that high-income countries
originated as many transport CO2 emissions as all low- and middle-income
countries combined]{.underline} (Figure 3). However, this is rapidly
changing due to high emissions growth in middle-income countries.
[Lower-middle-income countries have more than tripled their transport
CO2 emissions, and upper-middle-income countries have more than doubled
their transport CO2 emissions since 1990. In 1990, high-income countries
still generated about twice the level of transport-related CO2 emissions
as those created by low- and middle-income countries
combined.]{.underline} By 2018, levels generated by high-income
countries, and by the combination of low- and middle-income countries
were about even. In per capita terms, the gap between high- and
middle-income countries is still wide. [A person in a high-income
country is generating around three times as much in the way of transport
CO2 emissions as a person in a middle-income country. But this gap is
also rapidly decreasing.]{.underline} Per capita transport CO2 emissions
in middle-income countries have doubled since 1990, while they remained
relatively stable in high-income countries. Since 1990,
transport-related CO2 emissions per unit of GDP have declined for all
income groups, but obviously not enough to make up for the large
increases in GDP that we have observed over the same period. We show
these trends by world regions in the appendix (Figure A2).

[The United States is by far the leading contributor to global transport
CO2 emissions; it generates 21 percent of such emissions, while
accounting for less than 5 percent of the world's population. The United
States is followed by China and the EU-28 countries]{.underline} (still
including the United Kingdom), which both contribute around 11 percent
to global transport CO2 emissions (Figure 4). The EU-28 countries
contribute slightly more than their share of the world population and
China contributes less than its world population share. However,
transport CO2 emissions in China are rapidly increasing, experiencing a
tenfold increase

since 1990 (Figure 5). [Transport CO2 emissions have also increased by
around 20 percent in the United States. Among the lower-middle-income
countries, India is growing rapidly, and has increased its transport CO2
emissions by a factor of five since 1990]{.underline}; it now
contributes around 4 percent of global transport CO2 emissions, still
much less than its population share. There is not a single low-income
country that accounts for more than 1 percent of the transport CO2
emissions compared to the United States. Looking at the fuel mix, we see
that motor gasoline and gas/diesel oil account for the vast majority of
the transport fuel mix, and today both account for around 35 percent of
fuels used. Since 1990, the share of motor gasoline has steadily
declined, and the share of gas/diesel oil has steadily increased. The
share of the remaining fuel types has remained relatively stable (Figure
6). Consequently, motor gasoline and gas/diesel oil also account for the
majority of transport CO2 emissions.

\<\<paragraph break\>\>

Only a dozen countries achieved absolute decoupling over the study
period. The remaining countries experienced either relative decoupling
or no decoupling. This implies that transport emissions in most
countries, including the top-emitting countries, are still increasing
and strongly linked to economic growth. Hence, in order to achieve
decarbonization in the transport sector, there is an urgent need to
break this link. This is especially the case in middle- and low-income
countries. While about 72 percent of high- income countries are in the
absolute or relative decoupling states, only 29 percent of middle- and
lower- income countries have achieved some level of decoupling.

\<\<paragraph break\>\>

Moving onto the decomposition analysis, the first decomposition results
show that since 1990, [transport related CO2 emissions have increased by
around 80 percent, despite sizeable improvements in efficiency. The
results also reveal that these efficiency improvements did not fully
compensate for the increase in emissions due to population
growth.]{.underline} The net increase in transport CO2 emissions is
almost in sync with the increase that is due to GDP growth (Figure 7).
If these patterns continue, [achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement
with improvements in efficiency alone seems unrealistic.]{.underline}
According to the UN population projections, the world population will
continue to grow rapidly and reach about 10 billion people by 2050. Then
population growth will gradually slow down, and the world population is
projected to peak at around 11 billion people in 2100. Notwithstanding
the uncertainty surrounding these projections, [the slowdown in
population growth will likely come too late to allow further efficiency
improvements to outweigh the increases in emissions due to economic
growth.]{.underline}

If we look at the results of the index decomposition by income group, we
see that in high-income countries the improvements in efficiency fully
compensate for the effect of population growth, and even partially
outweigh the effect of economic growth. The efficiency improvements in
upper-middle income countries are almost as large as in high-income
countries, but there they are only just enough to outweigh the effects
of population growth such that total transport-generated CO2 emissions
continue to rise with growth of GDP. [Efficiency improvements are much
less in lower-middle-income countries, such that in these countries
increases in transport-related CO2 emissions are driven by both sizeable
population growth and GDP growth]{.underline} (Figure 8).

The first decomposition results for top-emitting countries reveal
several interesting points (Figure 9). [All countries shown, except
Japan and Russia, reveal increases in transport emissions since 1990. In
line with the descriptive analysis, the decomposition results suggest
that China experienced the most significant increase in
transport-related CO2 emissions since 1990.]{.underline} This increase
was largely driven by economic growth, which is not surprising, given
that the Chinese economy is among the fastest-growing economies in the
world, with an average annual GDP growth rate of 9.5 percent between
1990 and 2018[. Transportation emissions intensity in China declined
slightly, but population growth remained relatively stable.]{.underline}
In contrast to China, in India, the country with the second-largest
increases in transportation emissions, the increases have been driven by
both population growth and economic growth.

### AT: Cap solves

#### Capitalist solutions are maladaptive and fail

Adrienne **Buller** '22 (Adrienne Buller, senior research fellow at
Common Wealth, policy director at Labour for a Green New Deal, "Green
Capitalism Is a Myth", pg online @
https://tribunemag.co.uk/2022/08/green-capitalism-climate-crisis-finance-market-solutions
// PA-SS)

In February 2022, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
published its latest summary of the impacts of our rapidly changing
climate. It is a vast document, reaching nearly 3,700 pages compiling
all available evidence on the myriad transformations, insecurities and
catastrophes both looming on the horizon and already affecting many
around the world. In thousands of pages of scientific findings, it might
be easy for essential points to be lost. Fortunately, the report's final
line offers no shortage of clarity: 'The cumulative scientific evidence
is unequivocal ... Any further delay in concerted anticipatory global
action on adaptation and mitigation will miss a brief and rapidly
closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable
future for all (very high confidence).'

This was not the only revelation buried in the report's pages. For the
first time, the IPCC acknowledged the role of the private sector in
fomenting not only misinformation on the climate crisis, but another
phenomenon, which it termed 'maladaptation'. In the words of the
report's authors[, maladaptation describes those actions that may be
designed to help mitigate or adapt to a changing climate, but in doing
so 'lead to increased risk of adverse climate-related outcomes,
including via increased greenhouse gas emissions, increased or shifted
vulnerability to climate change, more inequitable outcomes, or
diminished welfare, now or in the future.']{.underline} [Whether by
compromising livelihoods or accelerating biodiversity loss, maladaptive
responses 'can create lock-ins of vulnerability, exposure and risks that
are difficult and expensive to change and exacerbate existing
inequalities'. In most cases, the authors argue, maladaptation is likely
to be an 'unintended consequence'. In a sense, the authors described
(unintentionally or otherwise) the trouble with green
capitalism.]{.underline} Given the urgency of the context and the weight
of politics supporting the systems and ideas underlying the green
capitalist framework, should we accept green capitalist solutions? Is
something---anything---better than nothing? If, in curbing emissions or
protecting biodiversity, some financiers and development firms make an
exorbitant profit, is that really so big a problem as to merit scrapping
the whole project? [We live in a society structured and defined by
capitalist relations, and the idea that market-based solutions are the
best and most pragmatic path to resolving most problems is powerfully
ingrained common sense. Asset management firms and other large corporate
interests have outsized power in shaping the perspectives of governments
and international institutions. This makes any programme for confronting
these interests an uphill battle, which must advance across incredibly
unfavourable terrain. At the same time, ecological crisis is at every
turn advancing along the fastest trajectories scientists have offered.
Time is not a luxury we can afford.]{.underline} To answer this
question, it first helps to establish criteria for what constitutes a
'solution' worth pursuing. Throughout this book I have evaluated green
capitalist solutions against what I believe to be two essential
criteria. The first, with which I'm confident anyone concerned with
ecological crisis will agree, is that a solution must have a material
impact: it must actually slow or reverse the industrial flow of
emissions into the atmosphere or the collapse of biodiversity; failing
this, it must reduce vulnerability to the impacts of these processes or
contribute to adaptation. Crucially, it must accomplish one of these
tasks on a timescale that reflects the urgency of accelerating
ecological crisis. Second, and perhaps more divisively, it must
contribute to necessarily radical shifts in the distributions of wealth,
consumption and power in the global economy. As I have previously
argued, this isn't a question of equality or justice in a moralising
sense. Both of these are worth pursuing in their own right. To many
(myself included), this makes meeting them a necessarily high bar for
any approach to addressing these challenges. However, even for those
interested solely in the question of effectiveness---that is, does a
solution reduce emissions or ecological degradation---achieving these,
as has been argued throughout this book, is also a practical necessity.
The evidence that affluent consumption is the primary driver of
ecological crisis is expansive. [While technological progress has, to
date, produced some reductions in material throughput and waste, these
gains have been entirely negated by rising consumption. However, while
affluent consumption matters in absolute terms, inequalities in these
patterns of consumption and waste are just as critical. In part, this
reflects the 'zero-sum game' of rising consumption: relative income is
one of the strongest determinants of happiness, with the result that
the forms and rates of consumption that signal one's position are driven
overwhelmingly by the super-affluent, and in turn drive consumption up
across the board with diminishing returns to wellbeing.]{.underline} The
[need to address these inequalities also reflects the deepening extent
to which the nature and scale of consumption and waste among the
affluent demands 'cheap' and invisible land, resources and
labour---whether this is dumping industrial refuse near communities of
colour or shipping hundreds of containers of plastic waste from Canadian
consumers to be dealt with by Malaysian labourers.]{.underline} In this
sense, the 'freedom' implied by consumption and choice within markets
ultimately rests on the profound unfreedom of countless others, kept
just out of sight. This is a strategy that is reaching the end of its
road. The supply of these invisible people, [ecologies and dumping sites
for waste is rapidly dwindling]{.underline}. Indeed, as Jason Moore
argues: '[The end of cheap garbage may loom larger than the end of cheap
resources]{.underline}.' These then, are my criteria for evaluating any
approach to confronting ecological crisis. The first assures we secure a
present and a future that are safe and habitable. The second does this
as well, while also trying to make that future one worth living in.

(\[45\], p. 27) relate [greenwashing with symbolic actions]{.underline},
"[which tend to defect attention to minor issues or lead to create
'green talk' through statements aimed at satisfying stakeholder
requirements in terms of sustainability but without any concrete
action]{.underline}". Walker and Wan \[50\] defines greenwashing as [the
gap between "symbolic" and "substantive" corporate social actions
(CSA)]{.underline}. [Companies that have a **negative CSR performance**
and at the same time apply a positive communication about their CSR
performance]{.underline}. As defined by Guo et al. (\[22\], p. 1828)
[greenwashing is essentially decoupling behaviors that are **symbolic
environmental protection behaviors** with no environmental protection
behavior or failure to fulfill environmental protection
commitments]{.underline}, to alleviate the external public pressures and
uncertainties and to avoid the conflict with external constituents. The
authors reinforce that these [decoupling behaviors of greenwashing
brands are to **maintain corporate legitimacy**]{.underline}. Signaling
and corporate legitimacy theory [The phenomenon of greenwashing was also
related to corporate legitimacy theory in the literature]{.underline}.
It can be distinguished in three types of corporate legitimacy:
cognitive legitimacy, pragmatic legitimacy and moral legitimacy.
According to Seele and Gatti \[43\], [greenwashing occurs in the light
of pragmatic legitimacy]{.underline}. "Cognitive legitimacy is based on
the shared taken-for granted assumptions of an organization's societal
environment. Moral legitimacy relies on moral judgments about the
organization and its behaviour..." (\[43\], p. 242). And [pragmatic
legitimacy is "the result of self-interested calculations of the
organization's key stakeholders, and it is based on stakeholder's
perceptions of their personal beneft deriving from corporate activities
and communication."]{.underline} (\[43\], p. 242). Guo et  al. \[22\]
explain that [when companies fail to reach their green goals, the
decoupling behaviors can reduce cognitive legitimacy (take-for grandness
of constituents), moral legitimacy (positive green evaluation), and
pragmatic legitimacy (benefiting constituents)]{.underline}.

### Indicts

#### Smith is academic garbage.

**Taleb 16**, Lebanese-American essayist, mathematical statistician,
former option trader, risk analyst, and aphorist whose work concerns
problems of randomness, probability, and uncertainty (Nassim Nicholas
Taleb, 2016, "Bloomberg Views' Noah Smith, BS Operator," Fooled by
Randomness, <https://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/SmithBSVendor.html>)

\*spelling error corrected: shifted the "D" and "id" to correctly spell
"did"

Background: Noah [Smith has a **long documented track record of writing
critiques of books he hasn't seen**, and **discussing papers he hasn\'t
read**. Here you have authors spending 10 years writing a book, and some
**troll with a megaphone** critiquing it on things that have nothing to
do with the content]{.underline}. I first became aware of it [when he
previously commented on my skin-in-the-game without realizing there was
the expression of a mathematical theorem, when it was on page
2.]{.underline}

Summary of Breaches of Journalistic Ethics & Logic in Noah Smith's
Bloomberg View Article on The Black Swan of April 16, 2016

Ethical Flaw

Taleb in The Black Swan is clear the Black Swan is about
unpredictability in the tails, not underestimation: \"The are two
varieties of rare events: a) the narrated Black Swans, those that are
present in the current discourse and that you are likely to hear about
on television, and b) those nobody talks about, since they escape
models---those that you would feel ashamed discussing in public because
they do not seem plausible. I can safely say that it is entirely
compatible with human nature that the incidences of Black Swans would be
overestimated in the first case, but severely underestimated in the
second one.

\[\...\]

This miscalculation problem is a little more subtle. In truth, outliers
are not as sensitive to underestimation since they are fragile to
estimation errors, which can go in both directions. As we saw in Chapter
6, there are conditions under which people overestimate the unusual or
some specific unusual event (say when sensational images come to their
minds)---which, we have seen, is how insurance companies thrive. So my
general point is that these events are very fragile to miscalculation,
with a general severe underestimation mixed with an occasional severe
overestimation.\"

Noah Smith in Bloomberg View: \[goes on and on unethically presenting
the Black Swan as only overestimating market crashes\]\... \"In other
words, Taleb might be wrong \-- people might be overestimating, rather
than underestimating, the risk of market crashes.\"

So ~~visibly~~ Noah [Smith is not familiar with the book that he is
discussing, **not even by an inch**. This led to an **incoherent
response**]{.underline} when I contacted them: Noah Smith said he
"agrees with points above" (not explaining then his Taleb is \"wrong"
other than to create hype and defame Taleb), and his editor, James
Grieff contradiction Smith by saying "He read the book but disagrees
with it". His editor claims that \"he read the book\"is like someone
claiming he read War and Peace, it takes place in Venezuela.

Logical Fiasco

The editor has to have a problem to miss the severe asynchrony. Noah
Smith takes a book published in April 2007 (before the last crisis),
discussing events until 2006, then says "Taleb is wrong" from inference
on market estimation of probability between 2007-2016 and what decision
to take today based on prices today, 2016. Perhaps the participants
adjusted to events of 2007, the book, or something else. The claim by
Noah Smith about the Black Swan concerns the market value of risk, not
the structure of risk, which is something subsequent to the book. That
his editor missed the asynchrony is very, very strange\...

[Ethical Breaches]{.underline}

Background: [After being called a BS vendor]{.underline} by Taleb (for
reasons that are now obvious) in the past, [Smith in a
vendetta]{.underline}, has written 4 articles [with similar attempts at
**discrediting** and **distorting**]{.underline}\... **[without the
slightest familiarity with the subjects at hand]{.underline}**. More on
these, later, as this is not the end.

[**Rule 1**: You shall not use]{.underline} a media company such as
[Bloomberg to troll people]{.underline} you hate.

[**Rule 2**: You shall not use the credibility of an academic position
to troll people, particularly when you have **failed academia** and are
concealing that you were (\"voluntarily\") separated]{.underline} and
have not been there for a while. [The article makes sure we
know]{.underline} that Noah [Smith is an assistant professor at Stony
Brooks]{.underline}. Except that [I was told in January that he either
resigned or had been "resigned" for **not meeting academic
standards**]{.underline} and was not coming back for the Jan 2016
semester, in fact \"never coming back\". \[Apparently, [Smith failed to
publish anything during his tenure there]{.underline}, except of course
for BS on the internet.\] [Smith claimed a sabbatical which conflicts
with what I was told by faculty members]{.underline} ([a sabbatical is
**something one return to**]{.underline}). [Smith should not be using
**sham affiliations** for positions he doesn't have so he can talk about
a subject he knows nothing about.]{.underline}

[Other Violations of Professionalism]{.underline}

Noah [Smith has **no familiarity with finance**]{.underline}. In early
2010 I made a statement in Moscow about 4 trades to do. I was not aware
of being filmed and used trader language. One of them was short T Bonds.
[After I communicated to]{.underline} Noah [Smith that he was a BS
vendor, he advertised in 2014 my claim of short bonds]{.underline} \...
[in 2010 as a way to wreck my credibility in every way
possible]{.underline}.

Did he report on the other trades in the ensemble? No.

Did it hit him that trades are something that don\'t last 4 years? No.

Did it hit him that bonds collapsed after the talk? (markets happen to
go up and down). No.

Does he understand that a trade is not a binary forecast?

Did he realize that I have several hundred thousand trades in my career
and [no self respecting scientist would play the media megaphone to
select one]{.underline}, particularly 5 years later without knowing the
true outcome[?]{.underline}

[This is why he couldn\'t write an academic paper]{.underline}: ~~his
mind has a defect in its logical wiring~~. [No]{.underline} finance
[academic would commit the lack of professionalism of
cherry-picking]{.underline} a trade in a portfolio, and[,]{.underline}
worse, not realizing that a dynamic trader buys and sells and there is
low correlation between the trade and the fate of the market. **[How can
someone that ignorant]{.underline}** about finance
**[write]{.underline}** about finance.

#### [Terzi]{.underline} pulls stuff out of his [ass]{.underline}.

Jonathan **Aldred 23**. Fellow and Director of Studies in Economics at
Emmanuel College and Lecturer in the Department of Land Economy,
University of Cambridge. "BOOK REVIEW - Growth for Good: Reshaping
Capitalism to Save Humanity from Climate Catastrophe Get access Arrow"
*Contributions to Political Economy*, vol. 42, no. 1, July 2023.
https://doi.org/10.1093/cpe/bzad004

Turning now to **[where Terzi goes wrong]{.underline}**, in many cases
there is little to interest the reader. [**Strong claims are** often
**made without**]{.underline} [even **a fragment of support**ing
argument]{.underline}, [such as when Terzi dismisses modern monetary
theory as 'a pipe dream]{.underline}' (p. 37), [and **asserts** that
**in a degrowth world**, 'the **price** mechanism' **cannot be allowed
to function**]{.underline} (p. 39). [Of course, although no growth-ers
reject a market-based allocation]{.underline} mechanism [in some sectors
of the economy, **this does not imply that markets must be banished
altogether.**]{.underline}

[Terzi]{.underline} then [develops a wider argument about the
incompatibility of capitalism with no growth.]{.underline} Terzi notes
'Solow's statement that there is "nothing intrinsic in the system that
says it cannot exist happily in a stationary state"' (p. 41), but [the
fact that Solow-style growth theory is not incompatible]{.underline}
with a no growth world leads [Terzi]{.underline} to look elsewhere for
that incompatibility. He [asserts]{.underline} that [Solow's
statement]{.underline} 'should be read through this realization that
growth, in the end, is merely the result of people's preference for
more' (p. 41), which ultimately [leads Terzi to the conclusion that:
'economic growth is a result of human desires, rather than a top-down
imposition by capitalism on otherwise indifferent
individuals]{.underline}\... . [The quest for more will endure as long
as humans]{.underline} [populate the planet]{.underline}\.... [It is
best to acknowledge this and craft our sustainability strategies
accordingly']{.underline} (p. 118). [For Terzi, the human 'quest for
more' is so strong]{.underline} that [degrowth advocates will have to
overthrow Western society's post-Enlightenment belief in
progress]{.underline} (pp. 45--6), [and]{.underline} also [prevent
citizens from leaving a country committed to degrowth by erecting
'substantial barriers to the outside world'---Terzi mentions the Berlin
Wall---'to keep its system operational']{.underline} (pp. 63-- 4). **[It
is hard to take such conclusions seriously]{.underline}**, [not least
because **Terzi's argument depends on controversial claims** **about
human material desires**]{.underline}, [resting in turn on a **highly
selective** reading of **psychology and evolutionary
biology.**]{.underline}

[More interesting is how Terzi responds to the arguments from green and
heterodox economists that much of the 'quest for more' is driven by
capitalism rather than Terzi's 'basic human cultural
traits']{.underline} (p. 126). [There is a strange attempt to distance
'pervasive advertising]{.underline} and planned obsolescence' [from
capitalism]{.underline}, [by classifying them as 'practices that firms
engage in to escape the mechanics of capitalism']{.underline} (p. 100,
emphasis in original). Similarly, [in response to green critics alleging
that much capitalist innovation does not contribute to human well-being,
Terzi suggests we should blame consumer preferences]{.underline} rather
than capitalism (pp. 135--7). **[But Terzi cannot have it both
ways]{.underline}**. [He favours markets over alternative
allocation]{.underline} mechanisms [because they are better at
responding to capricious consumer preferences]{.underline}. [However,
the drawback of this responsiveness is that preferences are satisfied
regardless of their social value]{.underline}. In particular, **[Terzi
does not acknowledge]{.underline}** that **[markets are not 'neutral'
between values]{.underline}**. [The value of a thing is how much someone
is willing to pay for it]{.underline}; [the preferences of the rich
receive more weight than those of the poor.]{.underline}

**[Terzi cannot engage with green]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
[heterodox]{.underline} **[economists here because]{.underline}**,
[along with so many mainstream economists]{.underline}, **[he rejects
the basic distinction between needs and wants]{.underline}**. [There is
no acknowledgement of the conceptual work]{.underline} that has been
[done by heterodox economists such as Gough and Doyle,]{.underline} or
philosophers such as Wiggins. **[Instead Terzi adopts a highly
implausible, radically relativist perspective on need]{.underline}**.
Terzi begins by noting that our understanding of need has changed over
time. Observing that young people no longer regard owning a television
as a basic need or necessity, [he goes on to ask if access to running
water is a need (]{.underline}p. 104). (**[My answer:
yes]{.underline}**, **[because without it, we die]{.underline}**).
[Access to antibiotics is seen as something which has moved from being
not a need]{.underline} in the 1930s and early 40s, [because of
extremely limited production capacity]{.underline}, [to a basic need by
the 1950s]{.underline}. **[The analysis here is flawed on many
levels]{.underline}**, [but the seeming acknowledgement of the
importance of antibiotics]{.underline} for human needs today [is
interesting]{.underline}, **[because they have structural features which
makes capitalism especially poor at encouraging the development of new
antibiotics]{.underline}**. [Bacteria acquire resistance so rapidly that
the therapeutic window in which pharmaceutical firms can sell a new
antibiotic for substantial profit can be less than a year]{.underline}.
Moreover, [what doctors most want is a novel antibiotic they hardly ever
use, to hold in reserve for use when all else fails.]{.underline}

#### Sarg is a pseudo-scientist.

**Tagrun '18** \[Tagrun; May 28; Physicist; Y Hacker News, "How the
ArXiv Decides What's Science,"
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11790818\]

Sorry to break this to you but [this is **crackpot
science**]{.underline}, and [there is no way such a manuscript can pass
through any **respectable physicist**]{.underline}.

Obviously you\'re not a physicist; let me simply say that [this is
**not** how a **scientific paper** looks like]{.underline}.

It is [just some **philosophical text** attempting to interpret some
**basic concepts** in physics, introducing new fields **no one ever
seen**]{.underline} (seriously?), [and myriad of **strange conjectures**
coming from **nowhere** and it goes **borderline mysticism** about
vacuum. There is **no new basic equation** from which you can derive
new, **experimentally testable** conclusions]{.underline}.

It\'s not even wrong.

Here\'re a few gems from his \"theory\":

\> The energy is inseparable attribute of the matter.

\> The Bohr atomic model is a correct mathematical model when assuming
that the space is void.

\> The intrinsic matter could never disappear.

\> The vacuum is not a void space, but contains a unique grid structure.
This grid structure named a Cosmic Lattice (CL) is built by two types of
alternatively arranged nodes, each one containing 4 sub-elementary
particles with shape of six sided prisms.

\> The Newton's gravitation (universal gravitational law) is a
propagation of the IG field in CL space

What?!? I\'m sorry but I can\'t believe I wasted \~10 minutes reading
this crap. Yes, sorry about the language, but [this is **bullshit
pseudoscience** and any **sane respectable physicist** will **reject
this** and **blacklist** this guy]{.underline}.

Here\'s how new theories in physics work: you put very little and very
very basic assumptions into your theory (which is essentially an
equation, that is compatible with experiments and hence is compatible
with the old theory within a certain limited domain) and new stuff you
derive from your basic equation comes out it in the form of
experimentally testable predictions. You have to get a lot more stuff
than you put into building your theory.

Special relativity is a very nice example, you just assume Galilean
invariance and constantancy of speed of light and out comes
time-dilation, length contraction, energy-mass relation. If you add
equivalence principle you get general relativity which gives you
spacetime and new theory of gravity, blackholes, etc etc. And old
Newtonian physics is happily reproduced when speeds and energy densities
are small. And most importantly, predictions of new theory agrees with
observations and experiments in the domain where the old theory failed.

Some intermediate mathematical stuff between your basic equation and
experimentally testable measurable predictions might be difficult to
interpret (wavefunction and entanglement with Schordinger equation,
\"holes\" with Dirac equation, virtual particles, etc.) but you don\'t
dwell on this stuff like a philosopher because neither your current
theory nor experiments doesn\'t give you a deeper understanding to it
anyway. So instead of going mystic, you sweep the non-testable stuff
under the rug, hope that future physicist will have a better theory
eventually and just \"Shut up and calculate\".

What you don\'t do is, [you don\'t pull a myriad of new philosophical
stuff out of nowhere where your **assumptions** are **all that comes
out** and call it physics]{.underline}.

[Even if you\'re not a physicist, you can see what kind of a
**\"scientist\"** he is by checking his publication history (**0
papers** in **any respectable physics journal**)]{.underline}.

Since the 1980s, [financial activities]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[assets]{.underline} [have played]{.underline} [an]{.underline}
[increasingly]{.underline} **[dominant role]{.underline}** [in
the]{.underline} **[global economy]{.underline}**. At the same time,
[underlying]{.underline} **[economic activity]{.underline}** as measured
by global GDP [has been growing]{.underline} **[more
slowly]{.underline}**. The result has been an ever-larger gap between
the volume and value of financial activity relative to the real economy.
And [that gap]{.underline} [has left]{.underline}
**[economies]{.underline}** [more]{.underline}
**[susceptible]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[financial
instability]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[crisis]{.underline}**
[and more]{.underline} **[dependent]{.underline}** [on]{.underline}
**[fiscal]{.underline}** **[and monetary support]{.underline}** [from
governments]{.underline}. Governments, however, are stretched
thin---thanks to high debt and interest rates and outsized central bank
balance sheets. Nonetheless, [the pace of]{.underline} **[financial
activity]{.underline}** [continues]{.underline}.

We are therefore in uncharted territory. [The threat of]{.underline}
**[financial crisis]{.underline}** [at a time when]{.underline}
[governments]{.underline} [are]{.underline}
**[ill-equipped]{.underline}** [to respond is]{.underline} probably
[the]{.underline} **[greatest risk]{.underline}** [currently facing
the]{.underline} **[global economy]{.underline}**.

[Financial deregulation]{.underline} and innovation---growth interrupted
by financial crises

The process of financialization started in the 1980s, influenced by the
economic thoughts of, among others, Milton Friedman (laissez faire
capitalism with minimal role of government) and Eugene Fama (maximizing
shareholder value). Waves of financial deregulation [were implemented in
the United States]{.underline} (under Ronald Reagan) and the UK (under
Margaret Thatcher), allowing banks and other financial institutions to
engage in more activities and markets. Corporate managers were
increasingly incentivized by stock options, to align their incentives
with shareholders. **[Financial innovation]{.underline}**
[flourished]{.underline}---[with]{.underline} many [new]{.underline}
**[financial instruments]{.underline}**, [especially]{.underline}
**[derivatives]{.underline}**, which [facilitated]{.underline} **[active
trading]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[hedging]{.underline}**
[by]{.underline} [market participants]{.underline}.

**[Debt]{.underline}** [increased]{.underline} over the same period
[while the]{.underline} **[credit quality]{.underline}** [of
both]{.underline} **[public]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[private
borrowers]{.underline}** [steadily]{.underline}
**[deteriorated]{.underline}**, [weakening their abilities
to]{.underline} **[service]{.underline}** [those debts]{.underline}. For
example, there are only two S&P rated corporations with an AAA rating
now compared to sixty in 1980; and the United States is about to lose
its AAA status. Of particular concern has been the pattern of [volatile
capital flows]{.underline} to emerging markets and low-income countries,
[leading]{.underline} [to]{.underline} **[debt buildup]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[subsequent crises]{.underline}**---disrupting and
~~retarding~~ \[hampering\] their growth.

[Financial deregulation]{.underline} and innovation [were
supposed]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [improve]{.underline} the
[allocation of capital,]{.underline} promoting economic growth---which
did occur, albeit unevenly, over the past four decades.
[However,]{.underline} [global]{.underline} [economic
growth]{.underline} [has been slowing down]{.underline}
[from]{.underline} **[4-5 percent]{.underline}** [in the]{.underline}
**[post-war]{.underline}** [decades]{.underline} **[prior]{.underline}**
[to the 1980s to]{.underline} **[3 percent]{.underline}** or less at
present. Moreover, [growth has been interrupted by]{.underline}
**[financial crises]{.underline}**, requiring increasing government
intervention and support.

In the 1980s, f[inancial activities contributed to]{.underline}
[a]{.underline} **[sustained bull market]{.underline}** in the United
States and elsewhere, [leading to the]{.underline} **[Black Monday
market crash]{.underline}** on October 19, 1987---accentuated by the
pro-cyclical nature of new portfolio insurance techniques. Then [market
enthusiasm]{.underline} over the internet [spurred the dot-com market
bubble]{.underline} which burst in 2000. Lower inflation during the
so-called Great Moderation allowed central banks to be accommodative in
their policies which together with new instruments like credit default
swaps and collateralized mortgages/loans obligations contributed to the
Great Financial Crisis (GFC) in 2008. The GFC forced major central banks
(including the Fed, ECB, BoJ and PBOC) to inject a huge amount of
liquidity into their economies through quantitative easing---ballooning
the size of their balance sheets, from \$5 trillion in 2007 to \$20
trillion in 2018. When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, causing market turmoil
in early 2020, those central banks again came to the rescue, increasing
their combined assets again to \$31 trillion---or more than 30 percent
of global GDP---in 2022

It is important to realize that [central banks' actions]{.underline}
have **[reinforced]{.underline}** [expectations]{.underline}
[among]{.underline} **[market participants]{.underline}** [that their
downside]{.underline} **[risks]{.underline}** [would be]{.underline}
**[protected]{.underline}** [by the so-called]{.underline} "[**Greenspan
put"---**whereby the Fed cuts]{.underline} **[interest
rates]{.underline}** [when markets]{.underline} wobble. While this stems
market turmoil in the short term, the resulting expectation encourages
risk-taking and is a clear example of moral hazard at work.

Furthermore, [new sources of]{.underline} **[market
turmoil]{.underline}** [are]{.underline} [arising]{.underline}.
[Panic]{.underline} [has been transmitted]{.underline}
**[increasingly]{.underline}** [quickly]{.underline}
[through]{.underline} **[social media]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[online banking]{.underline}**---as demonstrated by the 2023 US
regional banking crisis. [This]{.underline} has [rendered]{.underline}
**[obsolete]{.underline}** some [financial regulatory]{.underline}
**[safeguards]{.underline}** [such as]{.underline} **[banks' liquidity
coverage]{.underline}** [ratio]{.underline} (requiring them to maintain
adequate high quality liquid assets to meet unexpected deposit
withdrawal).

The widening gap between finance and the economy

Over the years, [the gap between the]{.underline}
**[volume]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} **[financial
transactions]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} the [value of]{.underline}
**[financial assets]{.underline}** relative to the underlying economy
[has widened]{.underline} **[substantially]{.underline}**. According to
the Bank for International Settlements, the global foreign exchange
trading volume has reached \$7.5 trillion per day---far outstripping any
notion of the FX transactions needed for international trade or direct
and portfolio investment activities. [The annual value of]{.underline}
**[US equities]{.underline}** [turnover]{.underline} has [amounted
to]{.underline} **[\$85 trillion]{.underline}**, [or]{.underline} **[370
percent of GDP]{.underline}**---[about]{.underline}
**[60-75]{.underline}** [percent]{.underline} [of which has
been]{.underline} [executed]{.underline} [by]{.underline}
[algorithmic]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[high-frequency
trading]{.underline}**, **[buying]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[selling securities]{.underline}** [in matters of
seconds]{.underline}. It is not clear how such activities may have
helped raise funds for companies to do business.

Most noticeable has been [the growth of all kinds of]{.underline}
**[financial derivatives]{.underline}** [whose]{.underline} [notional
value has]{.underline} [exceeded]{.underline} **[\$600
trillion]{.underline}**---[or more than]{.underline}
**[twenty-seven]{.underline}** [times]{.underline} [global
GDP]{.underline}! Even though the gross market value of those
derivatives contracts (summing positive and negative values) amounted to
only \$20.7 trillion in 2022, that estimate depends on the ability of
counterparties in derivatives contracts to perform as expected. But
during financial crises, counterparties often failed---leaving many
market participants exposed to the full notional value of their
derivatives positions.

Concurrently, according to the UBS 2023 Global Wealth Report, the value
of global assets or wealth amounted to \$454 trillion or 450 percent of
global GDP at the end of 2022. [That value is very]{.underline}
**[unequally]{.underline}** [distributed]{.underline}: [the
top]{.underline} **[1 percent]{.underline}** [of the
population]{.underline} [holds a big]{.underline}
**[chunk]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} **[total
wealth]{.underline}**---for example, around one-third in the United
States. On the other side of the coin[, global debt has
risen]{.underline} [to]{.underline} **[\$307 trillion]{.underline}** in
Q3 2023, according to the Institute of International Finance.

More important has been the role of the United States and the US dollar
in financialization. In terms of value added to [the US
GDP]{.underline}, **[the financial sector]{.underline}**, including
banking, securities, insurance, real estate leasing, and rental
activities, [accounts for more than]{.underline} **[20
percent,]{.underline}** compared to 11 percent contributed by
manufacturing activities. In terms of non-farm corporate profits, the
financial sector accounts for around 50 percent of the total, rising
significantly from 10 percent in 1947. [Many industrial corporations
have]{.underline} [to rely on revenues]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[profits]{.underline} [from]{.underline} **[financial
activities]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[supplement]{.underline}**
[those]{.underline} **[from manufacturing operations]{.underline}**. For
example, GE Capital accounted for 42 percent of GE's total revenue in
2008, and much more in terms of profit, just when the GFC struck (GE
sold GE Capital in 2015). At present, GM derives one-third of its
pre-tax profit from financing the sales and leases of its cars.

Moreover, while the United States accounts for less than 25 percent of
the world economy, [the]{.underline} **[USD]{.underline}**
[has]{.underline} [taken the]{.underline} **[lion's share]{.underline}**
[of global]{.underline} **[financial transactions]{.underline}**---[88
percent]{.underline} **[in FX]{.underline}** trading, [70
percent]{.underline} [in]{.underline} [foreign]{.underline} **[currency

percent]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} [their liabilities]{.underline},
and 58.4 percent of reserves holdings (down from a peak of 71.5 percent
in 2001).

The economy depends on financial activities

[Economies have become]{.underline} **[dependent]{.underline}**
[on]{.underline} **[financial activities]{.underline}** and the growth
of asset values. [That has made them]{.underline} **[more
susceptible]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[financial
instability]{.underline}** [and crises]{.underline}, [which]{.underline}
in turn **[require rescues]{.underline}** [by]{.underline}
[governments]{.underline}. In particular, the dominant role of the USD
in global financial markets means that [a dollar funding]{.underline}
[crisis]{.underline} has **[always featured]{.underline}** in [any
global financial crisis]{.underline}. Consequently, the Fed has assumed
a key role in stabilizing major global financial crises by supplying
dollar liquidity to the international financial system when needed.
However, after several rounds of fiscal supports and injections of
central bank liquidity since the GFC, [government resources have been
significantly stretched]{.underline}---by high government debt (127.8
percent of GDP of the G7 countries) and massive central bank balance
sheets (almost 30 percent of global GDP). [Adding to]{.underline}
**[government debts]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[central bank
balance sheets]{.underline}** [would risk]{.underline}
[unleashing]{.underline} **[major inflationary episodes]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[economic dislocations]{.underline}**. Furthermore,
[such interventions]{.underline} [could be]{.underline} **[less
effective]{.underline}** [in dealing with]{.underline} **[crises over

[in]{.underline} **[asset values]{.underline}** [have]{.underline}
**[skyrocketed]{.underline}**.

Due to the skyrocketing risk of a world-ending confrontation between the
United States and Russia, [World Socialist Website is re-releasing a
series of interviews]{.underline} it conducted in 2017
[with]{.underline} experts on the subject of nuclear war. One of them is
with a senior scientist at Physicians for Social Responsibility named
**[Steven Starr]{.underline}**, which WSWS has titled "Nuclear
winter---the long-suppressed reality of nuclear war".

Starr discusses the research which has shown that in addition to the
unthinkable horrors of flattened cities and nuclear fallout we've all
been told about, "a war fought with existing U.S. and Russian nuclear
arsenals is predicted to make agriculture impossible for a decade or
longer, dooming most people to die from a nuclear famine."

[Starr says a **false narrative** has been spun that the science behind
**nuclear winter theory** is weak]{.underline}, a narrative I've had
parroted at me from time to time in my commentary on this subject. He
says the science is in fact peer-reviewed and robust, and actually makes
very conservative estimates of the environmental havoc that would be
unleashed by black carbon soot thrown into the stratosphere by a large
nuclear exchange. But [this science has been **actively suppressed** and
marginalized by a **junk science** smear campaign and the slashing of
research funding]{.underline}.

## Degrowth

### 2NC -- Degrowth

#### Degrowth solves [globally]{.underline}. 

**Ahern '23** \[Andrew; 02/21/2023; \"How degrowth can help reduce
global conflict,\" MR Online,

[A scenario]{.underline} where demand for production and consumption is
reduced in the Global North [would allow Global South]{.underline}
countries [room for]{.underline} their own [development without having
to service Northern growth]{.underline} or follow the ecologically
destructive path set by the United States and Europe. [Degrowth seeks to
reverse this]{.underline} **[unequal ecological exchange]{.underline}**
where the North and South's resource use converge.15 In such a scenario,
[Global South countries could focus on using their productive
capacity]{.underline} and resources to meet their own needs. For
instance, according to the research by Jason Hickel and colleagues, an
estimate of roughly [43 percent of Global North materials have come from
the South]{.underline}. They state, "in 2015 the North net appropriated
from the South 12 billion tons of embodied raw material equivalents, 822
million hectares of embodied land, 21 exajoules of embodied energy, and
188 million person-years of embodied labor, [worth \$10.8 trillion in
Northern prices]{.underline}---[enough to end]{.underline} **[extreme
poverty]{.underline}** [70 times over]{.underline}. Over the whole
period, [drain from the South]{.underline} **[totalled \$242
trillion."]{.underline}**16 Such an analysis, Hickel and his team claim,
confirms that [unequal ecological exchange is a significant driver of
uneven development]{.underline}, **[inequality]{.underline}**, [and
ecological breakdown]{.underline}. A [degrowth]{.underline} program that
is international in scope and decolonial in principle [will lessen
environmental damage]{.underline}, [raise living standards for
billions]{.underline} of people, [and provide]{.underline} some level of
[equality on the world's stage]{.underline}. It should be noted that
degrowth is not a zero-sum game where those in the Global North would be
"worse off" than before. In fact, [life would be much better for the
global majority]{.underline}, whether you live in the United States or
Ecuador. While it can't be denied that degrowth would allow us to avert
ecological breakdown, the types of policies and provisioning systems at
the heart of the degrowth program would put a special emphasis on
wellbeing and sustainability in all countries. In a degrowth transition,
as opposed to the "grow or die" ethos of modern economics, all people
would have access to life's necessities: healthcare, education, housing,
energy, internet---what some call a "social guarantee."17 Moreover,
people would work less and have more free time to enjoy friends, family,
and nature; people would buy less consumer goods since these items would
have repair mandates; people's health would improve due to less
pollution from fossil fuels and more plant-based diets as well. There is
a bevy of research demonstrating how we can collectively live better
lives than we do now while reducing our use of energy and materials.18
Critics of degrowth often ask "who would this vision appeal to?" The
answer: the people. In my own research analyzing the world's citizens
assemblies, I found that [randomly selected citizens preferred policies
that fit within]{.underline} the [degrowth]{.underline} framework: the
reduction of energy use, transportation systems centered around walking,
biking, and public transit, and minimizing flights, to name a few.19 In
the case of Spain, their citizens' assembly advocated for increased
understanding of degrowth among the population. [Poll after poll
shows]{.underline} that [people]{.underline}
**[prioritize]{.underline}** [the environment over economic
growth]{.underline}.20 [Contrary to bad-faith projections]{.underline}
coming from both the right as well as some on the left, [people
are]{.underline} **[willing]{.underline}** [to enact much more radical
ecological policies than political ideologues are willing to give them
credit for.]{.underline} Scientific experts also agree with the urgency
for degrowth. In a study on support for growth-critical or
growth-supportive statements, researchers found that the majority of
scientific experts support either degrowth or "a-growth" (also called
postgrowth).21 In a survey of experts who work for the German
Environment Agency, these workers were given explicit and implicit
statements about growth where they took a position supporting green
growth, a-growth, or degrowth.22 In both the explicit and implicit
answers, these experts were found to be much more growth critical than
accepting the current economic dogma of green growth. In fact nearly
half of the respondents supported degrowth positions when they were
implicitly stated, demonstrating the [strong scientific foundation of
degrowth without the political "baggage" of the term that may turn off
some]{.underline} scientists.23 This makes sense since there is no
existing evidence for green growth.24 Degrowth, as it has matured, is no
longer becoming an evidential question, but one of strategy and how to
gain political power. At the beginning of this piece I mentioned how in
a highly interconnected global system, growth in the North impacts those
in the South. While reducing the demand for energy and materials would
likely help reduce conflict in these countries, lessen impact on local
ecosystems, and allow them to use their productive capacity to meet
their own needs, it is possible that without careful attention, degrowth
may also exert unforeseen, negative impacts on the South. Firstly, the
degrowth movement is largely composed of individuals who are white,
Western, and materially well-off. This poses a risk that the policies
and proposals on offer from the degrowth movement may not be inclusive
and diverse to include the Global majority. Although the degrowth
movement has been clear that its intentions are directed towards the
Global North, this lack of direct contact has resulted in Global South's
environmental justice movements questioning the applicability, framing,
and analysis of degrowth.25 In a series of interviews with environmental
justice organizers in the Global South, Beatriz Rodríguez-Labajos and
her team found that, "For many people in the South -- especially social
movements -- 'degrowth' will not make sense because of their own history
and experiences, having often suffered from situations of poverty and
scarcity of the most basic needs. Some 'growth' to reach more security
in terms of survival is regarded as logical. Therefore, focusing the
struggle on degrowth is not only perceived as 'missing the point', but
is also in some ways a 'luxury' debate." As the labor movement saying
goes, "if you are not at the table, you are on the menu." While degrowth
has comprehensive policy focused on the Global North, the most direct
way to clarify degrowth's intentions is to make a concerted effort to
directly engage with movements in the Global South in bringing the
ingredients and drafting the degrowth menu. We can [build off the
efforts already being made]{.underline}, [especially with]{.underline}
**[recently increased support]{.underline}** [among Global
South]{.underline} political and thought [leaders]{.underline}.26
Furthermore, as the degrowth movement has developed, so has its
strategy.27 In its earlier stages, the degrowth movement was largely
focused on the local scale with an emphasis on bottom-up organizing.
Since then, degrowth scholars and activists have recognized the need for
a complementary strategy of both bottom-up organizing and centrally
directed implementation. Like all political projects that rely on
existing institutions, there is an inherent risk that degrowth can be
co-opted or lose its connection with the grassroots. In this way, the
degrowth movement could become too provincial with electing the right
people, playing "pragmatic" politics, and betraying the interests of the
Global majority. This critique is not exclusive to degrowth; all major
political projects require navigating this difficult political space.
These criticisms are not to condemn degrowth, but rather, to present
intellectual clarification and greater coordination between the degrowth
movement and its siblings in the South including Buen Vivir, La Via
Campesina, and other post-development and ecosocialist movements. On a
strategic basis, [degrowth could **remedy**]{.underline} [the lack of
North-South solidarity]{.underline} [where the Northern environmental
movement takes direct responsibility for transforming how the Northern
ways of life]{.underline} and production systems [rely on the
labor]{.underline}, [energy]{.underline}, [and materials from the
South]{.underline} (including the waste and ecological consequences),
thereby [demonstrating our commitment to a decolonized and]{.underline}
**[anti-imperialist ethos]{.underline}**. The [Northern environmental
movements have]{.underline} thus far largely **[ignored]{.underline}**
this [Global interdependence]{.underline}. Making this point explicit in
our organizations' communications, education, and political advocacy is
a first step. [Implementing policies that reduce demand and ensure
global justice can happen on]{.underline} both local and [national
levels]{.underline} in which movements target energy efficiency efforts,
reduce working weeks, **[shift tax burdens]{.underline}** [from labor to
consumption]{.underline}, and first and foremost [target the wealthy
through global]{.underline} **[redistribution of wealth]{.underline}**
[via]{.underline} luxury [taxes and debt relief]{.underline}.
Furthermore, Ideas and actions that provide the Global South with the
opportunity to take back its fiscal and productive sovereignty will also
hasten a move towards degrowth.28 In addition, a key industry for
degrowth is the US military. As it stands, the US military is the
world's largest institutional polluter, emitting more greenhouse gasses
annually than over 140 other countries, largely due to its massive
transportation system.29 Further, the US military has over 585,000
facilities, at least 750 military bases in 80 countries and owns nearly
27 million acres of land in the US alone, whereby they cut down forests,
pollute landscapes, and threaten biodiversity in the process.30 Given
the US Military's neocolonial goals of subjugating the Global South,
this is one institution the degrowth movement should prioritize in its
efforts to promote global social justice and build international
solidarity. The military can never be "greened"; it can only be
"degrown" or abolished.31 In a recent Upstream Podcast documentary about
the green transition, guest participant and human rights activist Sergio
Chaparro framed the current "Green New Deal Discourse" into three
buckets: a centrist version like the recently passed Inflation Reduction
Act (IRA) which seeks public-private partnerships through tax credits;
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's social democratic Green New Deal that centers
Keynesian public investment and racial equity; and thirdly, an
internationalist ecosocial Green New Deal in which Caparro placed
degrowth.32 Unlike either Biden's IRA or AOC's Green New Deal which are
largely nationalistic, parochial, and predicated on expanding economic
growth, [degrowth is]{.underline} international in its scope,
**[ecologically sound]{.underline}** [in its science]{.underline}, and
thinking beyond carbon tunnel vision.33 These are the terms and scales
we need to be thinking in if we are to avert ecological collapse and
transform society for the better. [Degrowth offers a framework for
coordination and solidarity between Global North and South
movements]{.underline} [in our]{.underline} strategies, tactics, and
[vision for a better world]{.underline} --- [free from the extractivist
and unjust nature of **colonial capitalism**]{.underline} [that has
sacrificed the South's]{.underline} **[autonomy]{.underline}** [and
livelihood for the North's growth]{.underline}, all the while failing to
deliver a decent life to ordinary people in the process. [In a highly
connected economic-ecological system]{.underline}, [there is a moral and
material]{.underline} [imperative for degrowth.]{.underline}

Facing conflict For many in the world, a **[post-growth]{.underline}**
EU [would be a **more credible partner**]{.underline} [in the fight
against the **ecological crisis.**]{.underline} However, [international
politics is not just about cooperation; it is also about]{.underline}
**[rivalry]{.underline}**. At a time when 'global boiling' cries out for
united action, we are witnessing increasing hostility and violence.
[Failure to act on the ecological crisis would produce even **more
strife**.]{.underline} How would an EU beyond growth fare in a
conflict-ridden world? [Russia's assault on Ukraine brought war to the
borders of the EU and taught Europeans hard lessons about **resource
dependency**]{.underline}. Vladimir Putin thought he could get away with
his war of conquest because the EU was addicted to Russian natural gas.
That was a miscalculation: the EU maintained its support for Ukraine,
even in the face of drastic cuts to gas supplies. But it paid the price
in the form of an energy crisis. EU governments have spent hundreds of
billions of euros helping residents and businesses with their energy
bills. [And almost two years into the full-scale invasion of Ukraine,
the EU still hasn't managed to fully wean itself off natural gas, oil,
and uranium from Russia, adding to Putin's war chest.]{.underline}
Responses to the war have included a push to accelerate the [transition
to renewable]{.underline} energies. However, this makes the EU more
dependent on China, which dominates the supply chains for many critical
raw materials as well as the solar panels, batteries, and magnets made
from them. The EU wants to reduce its import dependency through domestic
mining, better recycling, and strengthening its own greentech industry.
However, [that]{.underline} **[can't be done overnight]{.underline}**.
[In the meantime, we are **stuck** between **two aggressive
autocracies.** A 'slower' economy]{.underline} as proposed by the
degrowth movement [would]{.underline} allow the EU to
**[reduce]{.underline}** its **[over-reliance]{.underline}** [on
imported energy and materials **more rapidly**.]{.underline}
[This]{.underline} [would make]{.underline} the Union [less vulnerable
to economic **blackmail** and thus deliver a gain in **strategic
autonomy**]{.underline}. For example, current decarbonisation policies
aim to replace all petrol and diesel cars with (mainly) batterypowered
electric cars. Since batteries need lithium, EU demand for this metal is
forecast to increase twelvefold by 2030.11 [Under a degrowth scenario in
which **private car** ownership is **scaled down**]{.underline} in
favour of cycling, public transport, and shared vehicles, [the demand
increase for lithium and other critical metals would be **significantly
tempered**]{.underline}. Also, more energy would be saved.12 [We could
well **live to see the day** when our economy can **no longer be
derailed** by **trade coercion** from either Russia or
China]{.underline}. A [post-growth]{.underline} EU [could also **help
mitigate**]{.underline} another type of **[resource-based
conflict]{.underline}**. The expansion of mining and export farming is
often a violent and destructive process, especially in the Global South.
Communities are driven off their land and see their water 1See the
interview with Gaya Herrington later in this report. 10 Sparing the
Planet, Shielding Democracy sources polluted and their forests
destroyed. [**Militias** finance their activities by **seizing
commodities**]{.underline}. [At the **frontiers of extraction**, where
our supply chains start, **conflict is rife,** to the point of
**destabilising governments**]{.underline} and spilling into
neighbouring countries. The Global Atlas of Environmental Justice bears
testimony to this.213 [By reducing our material footprint, we would slow
down the advance of the frontline]{.underline}. In short, a
[post-growth]{.underline} EU [would gain **resilience**]{.underline} [in
the face]{.underline} **[of inter-state resource
conflicts]{.underline}** [and would be **less complicit**]{.underline}
[in intra-state conflicts]{.underline}. But geopolitical rivalry is by
no means limited to resources. Russia's war in Ukraine, for instance,
can hardly be explained by a scarcity of resources. The delusion --
widely shared by the Russian populace -- of restoring the former empire
through recolonisation and the fear within the ruling elite of the
contagious effects of democracy in post-Soviet countries make for better
explanations. This shows that geopolitical strife extends to the very
values on which national societies and global governance are based. The
outcome of such conflicts will influence how much planetary operating
space is left for humanity. Defending democracy [One]{.underline} of the
**[major fault lines]{.underline}** [in geopolitics runs between
**democracy** and **autocracy**]{.underline}. Today, [the rivalry
between democratic and authoritarian governments is **grimly playing
out**]{.underline} before our eyes in Ukraine. Tomorrow, or perhaps in a
few years' time, a violent confrontation could unfold in the Taiwan
Strait. Mainland China's sabre-rattling against Taiwan compels us to
anticipate an armed attempt at unification, which would kill democracy
in Taiwan. [Critics of economic growth **cannot look away** from the
threat that **aggressive autocracies** pose to democracy, human rights,
and the **international rule of law**]{.underline}. There is no doubt
that the transition beyond growth must be democratic. [Democracy offers
a public space to challenge the **growth dogma**]{.underline};
[autocracies would rather squash the debate on '**a new
utopia'**]{.underline} for fear of **[losing authority]{.underline}**.14
[Many 'degrowthers' even advocate **deepening democracy** by extending
it to the economic sphere as a way to overcome the **compulsion to
grow** inherent]{.underline} in shareholder capitalism. [Democracy in
turn relies on constitutional safeguards that protect the rule of
law]{.underline}, pluralism, and human rights. [These include the right
to protest against those in power for their failure to address the
ecological emergency.]{.underline} **[Preventing the
worst]{.underline}** [will not **only require**]{.underline} [green
policies at the national level but also unprecedented **global
cooperation**]{.underline}. This will not happen in the 'might is right'
world that autocrats dream of; that would be a world with even more
violent chaos. Admittedly, [democracies can also resort to violence, but
they **rarely go to war** against each other]{.underline}. [They are
more inclined **to resolve conflicts peacefully**]{.underline}, in
accordance with the rules that just about every country has ever agreed
to. [A rules-based order is **indispensable**]{.underline} not just for
preventing more wars, but also [for tackling ecological
threats]{.underline}. With Russia gone rogue, China behaving more and
more aggressively towards its neighbours, and the US prone to
exceptionalism, the EU has an important role to play in upholding the
international rule of law.

#### Green growth fails -- prefer degrowth as a model to reduce environmental harm and redistribute wealth

[The UN panel's report projects the consumption of
materials]{.underline} in energy generation, civil construction,
transportation, and food [could grow by over 60% by 2060,]{.underline}
to around 170 billion metric tons per year. This growth is also due to
demand for minerals to manufacture solar panels, wind power turbines,
and batteries for electric car systems. [The costs to the environment
would be unbearable, according to the document, unless there is an
"absolute decoupling" between the use of these materials and economic
growth]{.underline} in high-income countries (as is the case of the
United States and Europe) and in upper middle-income countries (as is
the case of China and Brazil) -- in other words, the amount of
[**materials used and** the greenhouse gas **emissions would fall while
the economy continues to grow,** in what would be called **"green
growth."**]{.underline} Those advocating for degrowth submit [**studies
show**ing this **math does not add up**. It is **not
feasible**]{.underline}, they argue, [**to maintain** an indefinite
**increase in production** and consumption **while** at the same time
**conserving Nature** and replacing fossil fuels with
renewables.]{.underline} Using a simple example, this means the solution
is not for the approximately 94 million automobiles manufactured
annually to be electric -- but rather to increasingly exchange
individual transportation for collective transportation. In his book
More Is Less, Jason Hickel defines [**degrowth as a "planned
downscaling"** in the excessive use of materials and energy, in order to
"bring the economy into **balance with the living world**," **while** at
the same time **distributing** "income and **wealth** more fairly, **and
\[investing\] in public goods**"]{.underline} that people need to
flourish. He underscores that his proposal is not just a drop in the
[GDP]{.underline}, but rather that this indicator [be
ignored]{.underline} to build a different type of society, where people
would have more free time to take care of each other and themselves --
and would [consume only what is essential]{.underline}. Hickel and other
researchers suggest transitional measures to reach this goal, starting
in financially wealthy countries, which are historically responsible for
the collapse of the climate and Nature. To shift production, they would
use everything from [**ending "planned obsolescence**"]{.underline} --
when products are manufactured to last for a short time -- to [placing
limits on bank financing]{.underline} for destructive activities that
currently make huge profits, such as oil exploration and industries
producing weapons, private jets and meat. To [prevent unemployment and
distribute income]{.underline}, proposals include [universalizing and
de-privatizing health, education and mass transport]{.underline}; a
shorter work week; guaranteed jobs in public services and in "green"
sectors of the economy; and cancellation of families' education and
housing debts. A manifesto "For an Ecosocialist Degrowth," published in
2022 in the Monthly Review, an American socialist magazine, also details
some priorities. "The first and urgent measure is phasing out fossil
fuels, as well as the ostentatious and wasteful consumption of the 1
percent rich elite \[countries\]," reads the text. "Many forms of
production (such as coal-fired facilities) and services (such as
advertising) should not only be reduced but suppressed; some, such as
private cars or cattle raising, should be substantially reduced; but
others would need development, such as agro-ecological farming,
renewable energy, health and educational services, and so on. For
sectors like health and education, this development should be, first and
foremost, qualitative," continues the manifesto. "Even the most useful
activities have to respect the limits of the planet; there can be no
such thing as an 'unlimited' production of any good." Among the
signatories to the manifesto is Brazilian socialist and political
economist Sabrina Fernandes, the director of research at the Alameda
Institute. She says the issue is "to [readjust the planet's 'material
budget,' allowing for a redistribution of capacities]{.underline}."
"Countries in the North need to make reductions and big ones to their
energy demands, through a coordinated transition, for example, that
allows energy consumption to be increased to provide quality of life in
the South. But, of course, without [illusions in the global periphery
that we should raise consumption to the imperial lifestyle levels
predominant in the North]{.underline}," Sabrina Fernandes told SUMAÚMA.
She points out that "the math still has to add up in terms of global
reduction, so the [North needs to make significant reductions to create
space for the South]{.underline}, which should in turn engage in a fair
transition so that its rise in material consumption provides huge gains
in quality without breaking metabolic limits" -- that is, without
generating more pollution than Nature is capable of absorbing.

### 2NC -- Quality of Life

#### Degrowth improves quality of life while only removing wasteful production -- improves elderly care, provides water, more free time, community involvement

**McInerney \'23** \[Aoife; PhD from Radboud University Nijmegen and the
University of Limerick and teaches in the philosophy department at

[The degrowth movement]{.underline} incorporates ideas from Feminist and
Ecological Economics as well as other schools of thought into an
alternative vision of the economy. The movement [reframes societal
values, shifting away from trends of environmental damage, alienation,
and inequality towards a society that promotes harmony, respect for the
environment,]{.underline} and local democracy. It emphasizes the
wellbeing of local communities, the environment, and social services
over the consumption of \'luxury\' goods.

[Degrowth places **wellbeing at its core**, asserting that it can be
maintained or even improved in a degrowth economy. This can be achieved
by granting people more free time through reduced work hours and
increasing community involvement by managing resources and providing
public services through a commons management approach. Commons
management involves communities providing specific services (e.g.,
elderly care) and resource management (e.g., water) in a democratic and
inclusive manner.]{.underline} The idea is that people could volunteer
more for the community if they have fewer official work commitments.
However, the definition of wellbeing in the context of Degrowth
Economics is rarely discussed or explicitly defined. Analyzing the
wellbeing concept that the degrowth movement supports, we find that this
is often in line with the understanding of wellbeing as we discussed
above.

First, considering wellbeing as a lifelong activity can help us think
about the actions that affect our long-term wellbeing. In economic
terms, to be able to have access to adequate resources in the future we
need to adjust our consumption in the present. Long-term wellbeing that
may have an impact beyond one\'s lifetime is inherently something that
degrowth promotes because degrowth also considers future generations'
wellbeing.

Second, economies must consider the wellbeing of people, animals, and
the environment, as they are interconnected, and the state of one
directly and indirectly influences the state of others. A pluralistic
notion of wellbeing that considers the entire planet\'s condition can
help avoid policies that improve wellbeing for some while inadvertently
decreasing it for others including non-human others. Trade-offs may
sometimes be inevitable, but a holistic approach can help identify and
address them whenever possible. Additionally, the management of
resources through commons can enable exactly that, a democratic and
participatory governance of resources.

Third, the concept of limits and the distinction between authentic and
inauthentic needs goes beyond the idea that increased consumption is
always better, and it helps define the priorities of an economy.
Essentially, an economy should primarily focus on meeting basic needs
for everyone while discouraging inauthentic needs, especially those that
have adverse effects on others. This concept lies at the heart of the
degrowth discourse, which advocates for ensuring basic needs for all,
even if it means relinquishing some inauthentic desires.

For example, while mobility is a necessity, owning a car, particularly
in the presence of effective public transportation, can often be
considered superfluous. The problem with inauthentic needs is that they
can harm the overall wellbeing of the planet. Take private cars, for
instance; when there\'s a viable public transportation system, they
consume resources and emit emissions that could be avoided.

A better understanding of wellbeing can help us offset one of the
biggest charges against the degrowth movement. [Degrowth is often
attacked on the basis that degrowing the economy will lead to individual
and societal impoverishment. This is to say, that degrowth will make us
poor.]{.underline}

[However, the aim of the degrowth movement is to target **inauthentic
and wasteful** production and consumption.]{.underline} This point
benefits from our elucidation of wellbeing as containing an intrinsic
regulative norm best understood as a distinction between in/authentic
needs. \"As a consequence, [degrowth could be argued to not decrease the
current level of wellbeing because it targets consumption that could be
viewed as fulfilling inauthentic needs.]{.underline}

[Further, degrowth could enhance wellbeing by reducing activities that
decrease it, such as planned technical obsolescence.]{.underline}
Additionally, one of the main policy proposals is to decrease working
hours, which would result in an increase in wellbeing because [people
would experience less stress and have more time for **leisure
activities**. Furthermore, degrowth could improve future wellbeing by
preventing environmental damage.]{.underline}

#### Growth is worse for quality of life, and degrowth would only hurt richest people.

The COP26 climate summit in Glasgow has revealed how limited we are in
how we think about solutions to the climate emergency. Much of the
discussion revolved around countries pledging to lower their carbon
emissions, but there was less focus on how this might be achieved. Many
world leaders seem to think that technological innovation and green
growth will take care of the problem. But this is a misguided
assumption.

[Infinite growth on a finite planet is **nonsense**.]{.underline} Even
"green" growth relies on continued extraction of natural resources ---
and is fundamentally at odds with the idea of environmental
sustainability. [While some economists believe that we can "decouple"
growth from our dependence on extraction, real-world data does not bear
this out.]{.underline} In fact, what we see are ever-increasing amounts
of materials being extracted from the Earth even as our society has
embraced supposedly more environment-friendly policies.

[The climate crisis does not call for continued growth. It calls for
degrowth.]{.underline}

What does that mean exactly? Well, different people mean slightly
different things when they talk about "degrowth." But what most
definitions have in common is a recognition of the limits of our planet,
and a corresponding slowdown in resource extraction, and therefore also
in some areas of production and consumption. Unlike a recession,
degrowth is intentional and planned.

For obvious reasons, many might find the word scary. [Does degrowth mean
that our quality of life has to **dramatically decline**?]{.underline}
Would it require us to abandon a market-based economy that cherishes
competition in favor of some kind of a dystopian government-controlled
future? Isn't it just a naive, radical idea doomed to fail?

[The answer to all these questions is no. Degrowth does not spell a
decline in quality of life. While it would mean a decline in the
production of the most polluting products in parts of the world with
unsustainably high levels of consumption, the most drastic effects would
be **felt only by the very richest people**, because it is the very
richest people whose consumption disproportionately contributes to
environmental degradation.]{.underline} It is also important to keep in
mind that consuming more does not necessarily mean greater quality of
life. Indeed, [consuming too much can be very detrimental to human
welfare.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- Global Spillover

#### U.S. degrowth goes [global]{.underline}.

Desmond **Lachman 22**, Senior Fellow at the American Enterprise
Institute, Former Deputy Director in the International Monetary Fund's
Policy Development and Review Department and Chief Emerging Market
Economic Strategist at Salomon Smith Barney, "When the US and Chinese
Economies Sneeze Together", The Hill, 2/2/2022,
https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/592478-when-the-us-and-chinese-economies-sneeze-together

It has been said that **[when the U.S. economy sneezes, the rest of the
world economy catches pneumonia]{.underline}**. If this is true, it
raises serious questions about the current world economic outlook. Not
only is the U.S. economy likely soon to be more than sneezing. So too is
the Chinese economy, the world's second largest economy. Those two
economies combined now account for more than 40 percent of the monetary
value of all the goods and services produced in the world.

Among the reasons to fear that the U.S. economy will soon head for
troubled waters is that the Federal Reserve has belatedly recognized
that the country has an inflation problem and that it will soon have to
raise interest rates to get the inflation genie back into the bottle.

With inflation now running at its fastest rate in the past 40 years, the
Fed has announced that it will stop its bond-buying program in March,
thereby paving the way for a round of interest rate increases. At his
most recent press conference, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell
said that the U.S. economy was strong enough now to withstand multiple
interest rate increases. This is prompting Goldman Sachs to believe that
there could be as many as five interest rate hikes this year

The Fed's imminent interest rate hiking cycle will be taking place at a
time when the country is experiencing both an equity and a housing
market bubble. Indeed, at the start of this year, U.S. stock prices were
at nosebleed levels experienced only once before in the last 100 years.
At the same time, U.S. housing prices even after adjusting for inflation
were above their level on the eve of the last U.S. housing market bust.

Heightening the chances that later this year the U.S. equity and housing
market bubbles might burst is the fact that these bubbles have been
premised on the mistaken idea that interest rates will remain at today's
ultra-low levels for ever. When it turns out that interest rates are
very much on the rise and those bubbles burst, we will experience
financial market stress, especially in the unreformed and largely
unregulated non-bank part of the financial system.

[At the best of times, **any setback** in the U.S. economy would have
**major implications** for the **rest** of the **global economy**. But
these are far from the best of times, especially since the Chinese
economy is now confronted with a **host of challenges** that likely
portend a further marked slowdown in that economy]{.underline}.

#### US degrowth ensures global policy shift -- outsized geopolitical influence AND the US is the lone ideological holdout

Brian **Czech 21**; founder of the Center for the Advancement of the
Steady State Economy (CASSE), the leading organization promoting the
transition from unsustainable growth to a new economic paradigm,
"Degrowth: A North American Vision" May 2021,
https://steadystate.org/degrowth-a-north-american-vision/

[Europeans]{.underline} tend to [accept]{.underline} the tenets of
[socialism **more readily** than Americans]{.underline}. While the
reasons are numerous and historic, the most overlooked one is that
[polities approaching]{.underline} or experiencing [the limits to
growt]{.underline}h [encounter]{.underline} a [greater need for
socialism]{.underline}. Indeed, as [limits to growth result]{.underline}
in **[conflict]{.underline}** and **[social strife,]{.underline}**
**[laws]{.underline}** and **[institutions]{.underline}** are [required
**to keep the peace**]{.underline}. Many of these institutions are or
[resemble "socialist" developments]{.underline}. In the USA, for
example, we have social security, national forests, and Obamacare.

Whatever the reasons, the [main point]{.underline} is that [socialism is
an especially European thing]{.underline}, reflecting to a large degree
the Marxist legacy in European politics.

[In North America,]{.underline} [there's little quarter for Marxist
ideology]{.underline}. It's not a huge loss, either. Das Kapital may
have been paradigm-shifting in the 19th century---kudos to Marx---but it
is not essential today for understanding the unsustainability of
growth-at-all-costs capitalism. More importantly, no one needs the
haunting-spectre baggage that comes with the Communist Manifesto.
[**Degrowth** toward a **steady state economy** in the States will have
to be accomplished pursuant to the American Constitution]{.underline}.
The Constitution can handle it; it won't abide a Marxist revolution.

Marx's monument in Moscow: There for a reason. (Image: CC BY 3.0)

[And if we can't get America on board with de-growth]{.underline}---plus
non-Marxist Canada, Brazil, and Australia among others---[**how's that
going to work** **for the rest of the world**?]{.underline}

This isn't to discourage the Degrowth Marxists operating in Europe, but
the key phrase is "in Europe." Europe has that aforementioned history of
economic and political thought, including Marxist thought and debate
from the days when it was fresh off the pages of the Manifesto.
Europeans can drink Marxist politics with a firehose. On the other side
of the pond, though, and perhaps in the post-Soviet countries of eastern
Europe, advancing a de-growth agenda is difficult enough without bearing
the mantle of Marxism.

Profanity and "Propaganda" --- No Thank You

In North America [there is nothing resembling]{.underline} the European
[Degrowth movement]{.underline}, and for the reasons sketched above,
[probably never will be]{.underline}. The [best we can hope]{.underline}
for is "**[de-growth toward a steady state economy]{.underline}**" with
clear-eyed focus on the macroeconomic goal; not a bad thing for
sustainability purposes at least. The [North American **steady
state**]{.underline} would be a [mixed economy with regulated markets
handling the allocation of rival and excludable goods]{.underline} such
as coffee cups, socks, and bicycles. [Scale]{.underline}, or the size of
the economy relative to its sustaining ecosystem, **[must be determined
through public policy]{.underline}** and planning,
**[informed]{.underline}** [by]{.underline} the best available
**[science]{.underline}** **[in ecological economics]{.underline}** such
as ecological footprint accounting.

#### There's already [latent support]{.underline} globally, and the threshold for transition is [low]{.underline} -- just requires support from [3.5% of the population]{.underline}.

Saito nonetheless insists that [degrowth is politically

these are degrowth policies or just traditional forms of regulation.)

Girona has begun to explore how to implement **"post-growth
policies."**]{.underline} Saito says [success is simply a matter of
persuading a **critical mass of citizens** to push for
degrowth]{.underline}. He cites the statistic popularized by the Harvard
political scientist Erica Chenoweth [that it takes only **3.5 percent of
the population** protesting to **enact change.**]{.underline}

### 2NC -- AT: Mindset Shift

#### Mindset shift now

If you like the idea of a perpetual three-day weekend, you might be one
of a growing cadre that supports the concept of [degrowth]{.underline}:
a school of thought aimed at shrinking economies and moving away from
GDP growth as a metric of success, while instead emphasizing universal
basic services and social well-being. The idea [is gaining
followers]{.underline}, especially in Europe and especially among young
people. But it's not just a fringe theory. A Beyond Growth conference
hosted by the European Parliament last May saw 7,000 attendees,
including the president of the European Commission.¶ Akielly Hu, Grist's
news and politics fellow, discussed the growing popularity of degrowth
with Kohei Saito --- a Marxist author whose 2020 degrowth manifesto
quickly turned into a bestseller in Japan and beyond. (The English
translation, called Slow Down, was just released last month.)¶ "[I think
one of the reasons why people like the idea so much is because, in a
capitalist economy, people work a lot,]{.underline}" Hu said. "[And one
of the central ideas of degrowth is shorter working hours]{.underline}."
We covered this in a previous newsletter about the four-day workweek ---
one of the first degrowth-esque policies that we're beginning to see
implemented in some places. (The idea of a future where work is
deemphasized also inspired Betsy Ruckman to submit the drabble above,
which shows two colleagues enjoying a four-day week and basic services
like accessible public transport.)¶ Hu was also inspired by Looking
Forward's drabbles in writing the lede of her piece, which paints an
image of a degrowth future:¶ [Imagine a world where you work three or
four days a week. In your free time, you play sports, spend time with
loved ones, garden, and engage with local politics. Overnight shipping,
advertising, and private jets no longer exist, but health care,
education, and clean electricity are free and available to
all.]{.underline}¶ It's a vision that's pretty hard to argue with ---
especially, as Hu pointed out, the idea of working less and having more
time for activities that are about joy, not money. But there's another
aspect of degrowth that lends itself to a vision of a clean, green, just
future: It's inherently about producing and consuming less, and that
means less carbon.¶ "We're hurtling toward these major climate
deadlines," Hu said. "And I think there's this deep sense of disconnect
between what we say we're going to do about climate change and what's
actually happening. And one of the things that's actually happening is
that there are all these blatant, unnecessary, and unhelpful ways that
massive amounts of carbon are still being consumed." She offers private
jets as a common example highlighted by degrowth advocates. Taking a
private plane (ahem, Taylor Swift) creates an absurd amount of emissions
proportionate to the number of people it benefits. "It's a form of
consumption that contributes to economic growth, but it's not accessible
to 99.99 percent of people," Hu said. "So why are we spending so much of
the remaining carbon budget on private jets?"¶ Even though the
theoretical future of degrowth may sound appealing, critics still say
it's a political nonstarter. "If you tell people to shrink economies,
it's kind of focusing on scarcity. And that's a little bit unpalatable
in a world where we're already facing so much scarcity," Hu said. But,
she added, the original goal of the degrowth movement was to be a "shit
disturber" --- to provoke thought, and cause people to question the way
economic growth is prioritized in our society and embedded in our
policies.¶ Saito admits the idea of widespread degrowth is "in some
sense utopian." But, he adds, "believing that capitalism will prosper in
the decades to come is utopian, too."¶ We've excerpted Hu's Q&A with
Saito below. Find the full piece on the Grist site.¶ --- Claire Elise
Thompson¶ \-\-\-\--¶ Q. Why do you think we're seeing a growing interest
in critiquing capitalism, and degrowth in general?¶ A. Looking at
previous decades, neoliberal reforms really destabilized our society all
over the world. And there are a lot of discussions about how we can
solve the climate crisis, and how we can solve economic inequality. But
these measures are not properly working, and the climate crisis has been
accelerating. [People are suffering from precarious jobs, low wages, and
a lot of competition. And people are indeed unhappy]{.underline}.¶
Degrowth and the idea of post-capitalism are of course in some sense
utopian at the moment. But at the same time, [people who are really
looking for an alternative]{.underline} --- [people who really care
about the crisis --- can't find the answer within the existing
framework.]{.underline} I don't claim that my answer is definitive and
comprehensive, but [it resonates with the general atmosphere of
dissatisfaction and discontent, especially among younger
generations]{.underline}.¶

#### Studies confirm [latent]{.underline} support for degrowth.

Climate and Global Change, the University of Graz, "Lessons from
COVID-19 for managing transboundary climate risks and building
resilience," Climate Risk Management, Vol. 35, pg. 7

Title: [Lessons]{.underline} from COVID-19 [for]{.underline} managing
transboundary climate risks and building resilience

A growing literature is now exploring options for so-called
**[degrowth]{.underline}**, which aims to promote human wellbeing and
ecological resilience without requiring GDP growth (Hickel et al., 2021,
Kallis, 2017, Keyßer and Lenzen, 2021, Wiedmann et al., 2020, Kallis,
2020). The experiences of the last few years, including
**[COVID]{.underline}**-19, may have [**shifted** public understanding
and opinion on these issues, **especially** in **richer** countries,
which are **best placed** to **lead** with **new policies**. In a recent
**survey** of people in **G20** countries, **74%** of respondents
supported]{.underline} the idea that their country's economic
[priorities should **move beyond** profit and increasing wealth to
**focus more** on **human wellbeing** and **ecological
protection**]{.underline} (Gaffney et al., 2021). Overcoming the
research-implementation gap remains a challenge, however. We do not yet
know how degrowth policies could be adopted at scale or how they would
interact with our current economic processes and patterns of behaviour.
Nonetheless, our climate predicament demands openness to new approaches.
To better understand the options, further research into basic relations
between societal metabolism and social-ecological wellbeing is crucial
(Haberl et al., 2019, Hagens, 2020, King, 2020, Leiva and Schramski,
2020, Schramski et al., 2015, West, 2018, Fischer-Kowalski and Haberl,
2015, Garrett et al., 2020, Giampietro et al., 2013, Ringsmuth et al.,
2016). Although the many challenges and risks associated with a
fundamental economic transition are formidable, arguably, they may be
overcome on the time scale of a human life (decades).4 Conversely, the
risks associated with ever more radiative forcing as we avoid adequately
reducing emissions include transitions of the Earth system to
inhospitable states that may not be reversible on the time scales of
civilisations (centuries to millennia) (Lenton et al., 2019, Steffen et
al., 2018). [The]{.underline} growing [**literature** on **tipping
dynamics** in socioeconomic systems]{.underline} may [offer reasons for
**optimism**]{.underline} about societies' potentials [for a
**timely**]{.underline} rise to the challenge of **[systemic
transformation]{.underline}** (Otto et al., 2020, Lenton, 2020).

### 2NC -- AT: Transition wars

#### Economic decline good -- it opens opportunities for socialist alternatives

**Wolff '09**, \[Rick; influential in the field of Marxian economics,
and The New York Times Magazine has named him \"America\'s most
prominent Marxist economist\"; 2009; \"Economic Crisis from a Socialist
Perspective\"; Socialism and Democracy;

Accessed 7-16-2025; \]

The crisis in capitalism today is not, or not yet, a crisis of
capitalism. Whether it evolves into a crisis of capitalism -- when the
system itself is in question for significant numbers of people --
depends on three factors. [The first is the extent of the economic
meltdown now underway, and the mass suffering, resentment, and
opposition it provokes.]{.underline} The second factor comprises the
policies undertaken to contain and reverse the crisis, their effects,
and their public perception. Finally, [how socialists assess the crisis
in capitalism and intervene in it will also help determine whether it
becomes a crisis of capitalism.]{.underline}

In the history of capitalism, each phase has typically lasted for one or
a few decades. It survives several business cycles and various other
problems by more or less marginal adjustments. [Eventually, however,
these cycles and problems converge to reach levels that exceed the
capacity of marginal adjustments to overcome. A crisis in that phase has
arrived sufficient to prompt social movement for a transition to the
other phase.]{.underline} Sooner or later, such a transition succeeds.
Then, after one or a few decades, the entire process is repeated in the
reverse direction.

[No new boom in yet another sector of US capitalism is available now to
offset the bursting of the real estate bubble. The **long-developing
economic contradictions** of the private phase of US capitalism since
the 1970s -- exhausted workers with unsustainable debts, banks and
brokerages with unrecoverable loans, a government without marginal
adjustments (conventional "policy tools") adequate to unprecedented
magnitudes of economic problems -- **yielded crisis**.]{.underline}
Domestic economic suffering is now rising fast; all indices of
foreclosures, bankruptcies, unemployment, etc. are increasing as of
mid-2009. Foreign businesses, individuals and governments are reacting
self-protectively to the evident weakness and decline of private
capitalism in the US.

The question now is which of three basic economic scenarios will
actually happen. The first possibility is that the current private phase
of capitalism will find yet another way to postpone oscillation to a
state phase. The second possibility is that Obama will be forced to
arrange a new New Deal, to make a transition to a state capitalism.7 The
third [possibility is that the US working class accepts neither the
first scenario nor the second, and **moves instead
against**]{.underline} both [**forms of capitalism** and for an
alternative.]{.underline}

The contradictions of capitalism offer us partial yet useful examples of
the democratization of enterprise advocated by this "Reform Plus"
agenda. One of these, recurring in California for decades, can
illustrate our argument.11 In the Silicon Valley on the peninsula below
San Francisco, groups of computer software engineers in large capitalist
corporations (IBM, Cisco, Oracle, and so on) quit their jobs. They leave
well-paid positions as hired workers. They explain that they detest
being told what to work on and how to work by supervisors and
executives. They reject work in suits and ties, in arid corporate
buildings, etc. They insist that such conditions stifle their
creativity, their work productivity, and their physical and mental
well-being.

After quitting, small groups often gather with their laptop computers in
someone's garage. They form a new enterprise with rules of strict
equality. All decisions about what to work on and how to work are made
collectively. All proceeds from the sale of software they create are
received and distributed collectively (partly to themselves as
individual incomes). The net revenues that remain after individual
incomes and all other costs are subtracted -- the surplus/profits -- are
distributed by means of collective decisions with each engineer having
an equal voice. Each engineer's job description in such enterprises has
two parts: (1) Monday through Thursday work on software in ways
collectively determined, and (2) on Friday participate in collective
decision-making regarding what to produce, how to produce, and how to
distribute the enterprise's revenues.

[In such enterprises, workers have become their own collective board of
directors and have abolished the exploitative worker-capitalist
relation.]{.underline} In Marxian terms, they have replaced their
enterprise's capitalist class structure with a communitarian (or
communist) structure. Because Marxian ideas are largely excluded from
circulating and being taught in the US, these engineers and the
journalists and academics who describe them cannot use Marxian class
terms. Instead, they refer to "innovative entrepreneurship" to explain
the many breakthroughs in software and computer technology achieved by
such non-capitalist (in Marxian terms) enterprises. [The working
conditions of software engineers are no doubt unique, as are the
concrete conditions of all other kinds of work, but many share the
capitalist division between workers and boards of directors that this
new socialist strategy would target for change.]{.underline}

Thus, this new socialist strategy might recognize and celebrate such
basic transitions out of capitalist enterprises as germs of the broader
social change it seeks.12 On that basis, it could demand and pursue the
political, cultural, and economic conditions -- including state
assistance -- needed for such non-capitalist enterprises to function
successfully.13 Such a new socialist strategy could show that
achievement of its goals would provide all workers with a new freedom to
choose between working in capitalist or in such non-capitalist
enterprises. Achievement of such socialist goals would likewise provide
all consumers with new choices between commodities made by traditional
capitalist enterprises and those emerging from democratized ones. State
assistance (financing, subsidies, etc.) would be justified to enable
non-capitalist enterprises to grow and compete with capitalist
enterprises to see what mix of them a democratic society would choose.

7. Conclusion

[**Socialists now confront an historic opportunity**. Repeated
oscillations between private and state capitalism have exposed the
latter's fatal vulnerability. As the current crisis deepens, **many
workers and militants are ready and inclined to support changes** that
go **beyond** another swing to a **state form of capitalism**, changes
that would overcome the latter's proven vulnerability.]{.underline} They
may thus respond to the argument that the internal structures of
enterprises must be transformed in the ways discussed above. They may be
unresponsive to a movement that restricts itself to work for transition
to another state form of capitalism.

[Over the last 150 years, socialism as a movement was
successful]{.underline} in two basic ways. First, it taught everyone
that capitalism could be made more supportive of people's needs, more
humane, and more socially progressive than the devotees of private
capitalism had thought possible, let alone desirable. In the process it
produced powerful and enduring criticisms of private forms of
capitalism. Second, [struggles for socialism helped to generate
valuable, concrete experiments in what could not advance beyond state
forms of capitalism:]{.underline} the New Deal in the US, the USSR,
western European social democracies, and many countries in Asia, Latin
American, and Africa especially after World War 2.14 Many socialists,
then and to this day, have believed that some of what we here call state
forms of capitalism were socialisms.

The argument here disagrees in its focus on what was similar across both
private and state forms: the enduring division between workers and those
who functioned as boards of directors. This argument entails no
disrespect for socialist struggles and achievements in the USSR after
1917, China after 1949 and through the heroic struggles later in Cuba,
Venezuela, Bolivia and elsewhere. They all made historic breakthroughs
in challenging capitalism as a system, in bringing all sorts of social
progress to their people, and in teaching all socialists crucial lessons
drawn from their successes and failures. They could not know what those
lessons were before their practice taught them. The particular lesson
analyzed and extended here identifies another urgently needed
breakthrough, a profoundly democratic transformation inside enterprises.
The point is to overcome the division between workers and directors not
only in private forms of capitalism but also in state forms. The purpose
in doing so is, first, to secure progressive state capitalist reforms
and, second, to advance beyond them toward socialism's classical goals
of equality, democracy, and social justice.

[Imagine]{.underline} that the world as we know it ends tomorrow.
[There's a global]{.underline} catastrophe: a pandemic virus, an
asteroid strike, or perhaps a **[nuclear holocaust]{.underline}**. The
[vast majority of the human race perishes]{.underline}. Our
[civilisation **collapse**s]{.underline}. The post-apocalyptic survivors
find themselves in a devastated world of decaying, deserted cities and
roving gangs of bandits looting and taking by force.

[Bad as things sound, that's **not the end** for humanity]{.underline}.
We bounce back. [Sooner or later, **peace and order** emerge again, just
as they have **time and again** through history]{.underline}. [Stable
communities take shape]{.underline}. They begin the agonising process of
rebuilding their technological base from scratch. But here's the
question: how far could such a society rebuild? Is there any chance, for
instance, that a post-apocalyptic society could reboot a technological
civilisation?

Let's make the basis of this thought experiment a little more specific.
[Today, we have already consumed the most **easily drainable** crude oil
and]{.underline}, particularly in Britain, [much of the
**shallowest**]{.underline}, most [**readily mined** deposits of coal.
Fossil fuels are **central** to the organisation of **modern industrial
society**]{.underline}, just as they were central to its development.
Those, by the way, are distinct roles: even if we could somehow do
without fossil fuels now (which we can't, quite), it's a different
question whether we could have got to where we are without ever having
had them.

So, [would a society **starting over** on a planet **stripped** of its
fossil fuel deposits have the chance to **progress** through its own
Industrial Revolution?]{.underline} Or to phrase it another way, what
might have happened if, for whatever reason, the Earth had never
acquired its extensive underground deposits of coal and oil in the first
place? Would our progress necessarily have halted in the 18th century,
in a pre-industrial state?

It's easy to underestimate our current dependence on fossil fuels. In
everyday life, their most visible use is the petrol or diesel pumped
into the vehicles that fill our roads, and the coal and natural gas
which fire the power stations that electrify our modern lives. But we
also rely on a range of different industrial materials, and in most
cases, high temperatures are required to transform the stuff we dig out
of the ground or harvest from the landscape into something useful. [You
can't smelt **metal**, make **glass**, roast the ingredients of
**concrete**, or synthesise artificial **fertiliser** without a **lot of
heat**. It is **fossil fuels** -- coal, gas and oil -- that provide
**most**]{.underline} of this **[thermal energy]{.underline}**.

In fact, the problem is even worse than that. [Many of the chemicals
required in bulk to run the **modern world**, from pesticides to
plastics, derive from]{.underline} the diverse organic compounds in
**[crude oil]{.underline}**. Given the dwindling reserves of crude oil
left in the world, it could be argued that the most wasteful use for
this limited resource is to simply burn it. We should be carefully
preserving what's left for the vital repertoire of valuable organic
compounds it offers.

But my topic here is not what we should do now. Presumably everybody
knows that we must transition to a low-carbon economy one way or
another. No, I want to answer a question whose interest is (let's hope)
more theoretical. Is the emergence of a technologically advanced
civilisation necessarily contingent on the easy availability of ancient
energy? Is it possible to build an industrialised civilisation without
fossil fuels? And the answer to that question is: maybe -- but it would
be extremely difficult. Let's see how.

We'll start with a natural thought. Many of our alternative energy
technologies are already highly developed. Solar panels, for example,
represent a good option today, and are appearing more and more on the
roofs of houses and businesses. It's tempting to think that a rebooted
society could simply pick up where we leave off. Why couldn't our
civilisation 2.0 just start with renewables?

Well, it could, in a very limited way. If you find yourself among the
survivors in a post-apocalyptic world, you could scavenge enough working
solar panels to keep your lifestyle electrified for a good long while.
Without moving parts, photovoltaic cells require little maintenance and
are remarkably resilient. They do deteriorate over time, though, from
moisture penetrating the casing and from sunlight itself degrading the
high-purity silicon layers. The electricity generated by a solar panel
declines by about 1 per cent every year so, after a few generations, all
our hand-me-down solar panels will have degraded to the point of
uselessness. Then what?

New ones [would be **fiendishly difficult** to create from **scratch**.
Solar panels are made from thin slices of **extremely pure
silicon**]{.underline}, and although the raw material is common sand, it
must be [processed and refined using **complex and precise techniques**
-- the same technological capabilities]{.underline}, more or less, [that
we need for **modern semiconductor** electronics
components]{.underline}. These techniques took a long time to develop,
and would presumably take a long time to recover. So photovoltaic solar
power would not be within the capability of a society early in the
industrialisation process.

\<\<CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

Perhaps, though, we were on the right track by starting with electrical
power. Most of our renewable-energy technologies produce electricity. In
our own historical development, it so happens that the core phenomena of
electricity were discovered in the first half of the 1800s, well after
the early developmpent of steam engines. Heavy industry was already
committed to combustion-based machinery, and electricity has largely
assumed a subsidiary role in the organisation of our economies ever
since. But could that sequence have run the other way? Is there some
developmental requirement that thermal energy must come first? On the
face of it, it's not beyond the bounds of possibility that a progressing
society could construct electrical generators and couple them to simple
windmills and waterwheels, later progressing to wind turbines and
hydroelectric dams. In a world without fossil fuels, one might envisage
an electrified civilisation that largely bypasses combustion engines,
building its transport infrastructure around electric trains and trams
for long-distance and urban transport. I say 'largely'. We couldn't get
round it all together. When it comes to generating the white heat
demanded by modern industry, there are few good options but to burn
stuff. While the electric motor could perhaps replace the coal-burning
steam engine for mechanical applications, society, as we've already
seen, also relies upon thermal energy to drive the essential chemical
and physical transformations it needs. How could an industrialising
society produce crucial building materials such as iron and steel,
brick, mortar, cement and glass without resorting to deposits of coal?
You can of course create heat from electricity. We already use electric
ovens and kilns. Modern arc furnaces are used for producing cast iron or
recycling steel. The problem isn't so much that electricity can't be
used to heat things, but that for meaningful industrial activity you've
got to generate prodigious amounts of it, which is challenging using
only renewable energy sources such as wind and water. An alternative is
to generate high temperatures using solar power directly. Rather than
relying on photovoltaic panels, concentrated solar thermal farms use
giant mirrors to focus the sun's rays onto a small spot. The heat
concentrated in this way can be exploited to drive certain chemical or
industrial processes, or else to raise steam and drive a generator. Even
so, it is difficult (for example) to produce the very high temperatures
inside an iron-smelting blast furnace using such a system. What's more,
it goes without saying that the effectiveness of concentrated solar
power depends strongly on the local climate. No, when it comes to
generating the white heat demanded by modern industry, there are few
good options but to burn stuff. But that doesn't mean the stuff we burn
necessarily has to be fossil fuels. Let's take a quick detour into the
pre-history of modern industry. Long before the adoption of coal,
charcoal was widely used for smelting metals. In many respects it is
superior: charcoal burns hotter than coal and contains far fewer
impurities. In fact, coal's impurities were a major delaying factor on
the Industrial Revolution. Released during combustion, they can taint
the product being heated. During smelting, sulphur contaminants can soak
into the molten iron, making the metal brittle and unsafe to use. It
took a long time to work out how to treat coal to make it useful for
many industrial applications. And, in the meantime, charcoal worked
perfectly well. And then, well, we stopped using it. In retrospect,
that's a pity. When it comes from a sustainable source, charcoal burning
is essentially carbon-neutral, because it doesn't release any new carbon
into the atmosphere -- not that this would have been a consideration for
the early industrialists. But charcoal-based industry didn't die out
altogether. In fact, it survived to flourish in Brazil. Because it has
substantial iron deposits but few coalmines, Brazil is the largest
charcoal producer in the world and the ninth biggest steel producer. We
aren't talking about a cottage industry here, and this makes Brazil a
very encouraging example for our thought experiment. The trees used in
Brazil's charcoal industry are mainly fast-growing eucalyptus,
cultivated specifically for the purpose. The traditional method for
creating charcoal is to pile chopped staves of air-dried timber into a
great dome-shaped mound and then cover it with turf or soil to restrict
airflow as the wood smoulders. The Brazilian enterprise has scaled up
this traditional craft to an industrial operation. Dried timber is
stacked into squat, cylindrical kilns, built of brick or masonry and
arranged in long lines so that they can be easily filled and unloaded in
sequence. The largest sites can sport hundreds of such kilns. Once
filled, their entrances are sealed and a fire is lit from the top. The
skill in charcoal production is to allow just enough air into the
interior of the kiln. There must be enough combustion heat to drive out
moisture and volatiles and to pyrolyse the wood, but not so much that
you are left with nothing but a pile of ashes. The kiln attendant
monitors the state of the burn by carefully watching the smoke seeping
out of the top, opening air holes or sealing with clay as necessary to
regulate the process. Brazil shows how the raw materials of modern
civilisation can be supplied without reliance on fossil fuels Good
things come to those who wait, and this wood pyrolysis process can take
up to a week of carefully controlled smouldering. The same basic method
has been used for millennia. However, the ends to which the fuel is put
are distinctly modern. Brazilian charcoal is trucked out of the forests
to the country's blast furnaces where it is used to transform ore into
pig iron. This pig iron is the basic ingredient of modern mass-produced
steel. The Brazilian product is exported to countries such as China and
the US where it becomes cars and trucks, sinks, bathtubs, and kitchen
appliances. Around two-thirds of Brazilian charcoal comes from
sustainable plantations, and so this modern-day practice has been dubbed
'green steel'. Sadly, the final third is supplied by the non-sustainable
felling of primary forest. Even so, the Brazilian case does provide an
example of how the raw materials of modern civilisation can be supplied
without reliance on fossil fuels. Another, related option might be wood
gasification. The use of wood to provide heat is as old as mankind, and
yet simply burning timber only uses about a third of its energy. The
rest is lost when gases and vapours released by the burning process blow
away in the wind. Under the right conditions, even smoke is combustible.
We don't want to waste it. Better than simple burning, then, is to drive
the thermal breakdown of the wood and collect the gases. You can see the
basic principle at work for yourself just by lighting a match. The
luminous flame isn't actually touching the matchwood: it dances above,
with a clear gap in between. The flame actually feeds on the hot gases
given off as the wood breaks down in the heat, and the gases combust
only once they mix with oxygen from the air. Matches are fascinating
when you look at them closely. Wartime gasifier cars could achieve about
1.5 miles per kilogram. Today's designs improve upon this To release
these gases in a controlled way, bake some timber in a closed container.
Oxygen is restricted so that the wood doesn't simply catch fire. Its
complex molecules decompose through a process known as pyrolysis, and
then the hot carbonised lumps of charcoal at the bottom of the container
react with the breakdown products to produce flammable gases such as
hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The resultant 'producer gas' is a
versatile fuel: it can be stored or piped for use in heating or street
lights, and is also suitable for use in complex machinery such as the
internal combustion engine. More than a million gasifier-powered cars
across the world kept civilian transport running during the oil
shortages of the Second World War. In occupied Denmark, 95 per cent of
all tractors, trucks and fishing boats were powered by wood-gas
generators. The energy content of about 3 kg of wood (depending on its
dryness and density) is equivalent to a litre of petrol, and the fuel
consumption of a gasifier-powered car is given in miles per kilogram of
wood rather than miles per gallon. Wartime gasifier cars could achieve
about 1.5 miles per kilogram. Today's designs improve upon this. But you
can do a lot more with wood gases than just keep your vehicle on the
road. It turns out to be suitable for any of the manufacturing processes
needing heat that we looked at before, such as kilns for lime, cement or
bricks. Wood gas generator units could easily power agricultural or
industrial equipment, or pumps. Sweden and Denmark are world leaders in
their use of sustainable forests and agricultural waste for turning the
steam turbines in power stations. And once the steam has been used in
their 'Combined Heat and Power' (CHP) electricity plants, it is piped to
the surrounding towns and industries to heat them, allowing such CHP
stations to approach 90 per cent energy efficiency. Such plants suggest
a marvellous vision of industry wholly weaned from its dependency on
fossil fuel.

\<\<PARAGRAPH INTEGRITY RESUMED\>\>

Is that our solution, then? [Could our rebooting society **run on
wood**]{.underline}, supplemented with electricity from renewable
sources? Maybe so, if the population was fairly small. But [here's the
**catch**]{.underline}. [These options all **presuppose** that our
survivors are **able to construct** efficient steam turbines, CHP
stations and internal combustion engines]{.underline}. [We know how to
do all that]{.underline}, of course -- [but in the event of a
civilisational collapse, who is to say that the knowledge **won't be
lost?** And if it is, what are the chances that our descendants could
**reconstruct it?**]{.underline}

In our own history, the first successful application of steam engines
was in pumping out coal mines. This was a setting in which fuel was
already abundant, so it didn't matter that the first, primitive designs
were terribly inefficient. The increased output of coal from the mines
was used to first smelt and then forge more iron. Iron components were
used to construct further steam engines, which were in turn used to pump
mines or drive the blast furnaces at iron foundries.

And of course, steam engines were themselves employed at machine shops
to construct yet more steam engines. It was only once steam engines were
being built and operated that subsequent engineers were able to devise
ways to increase their efficiency and shrink fuel demands. They found
ways to reduce their size and weight, adapting them for applications in
transport or factory machinery. In other words, there was a positive
feedback loop at the very core of the industrial revolution: the
production of coal, iron and steam engines were all mutually supportive.

[In a world without readily mined **coal**, would there ever be the
opportunity to **test** profligate prototypes of steam engines, even if
they could mature and become more efficient over time? How feasible is
it that a society could attain a **sufficient understanding** of
thermodynamics, metallurgy and mechanics to make the precisely
interacting components of an internal combustion engine]{.underline},
without first cutting its teeth on much simpler external combustion
engines -- the separate boiler and cylinder-piston of steam engines?

We recognise the difficulties, but we most certainly do not advocate
either apathy or despair. It is neither hopeless nor too late. As Paul
Ehrlich has noted, [there are thresholds in human behaviour when
**cultural evolution moves rapidly**]{.underline}: [\'When the time is
ripe, society can be transformed **virtually overnight**]{.underline}\'
(in Daily and Ellison 2002, p. 233). [Nobody foresaw the collapse of the
Soviet Union and the fall of the Berlin Wall]{.underline} even a few
months beforehand. [There are times when society does change rapidly to
a new path]{.underline}, and **[this is one tipping point we desperately
do need]{.underline}**. Are we close to that tipping point? It\'s hard
to see such points before they happen (as the Soviet Union collapse
showed). However, [change is happening, more and more people are
questioning the endless growth mantra]{.underline}. More people are
[talking about solutions that avoid the endless growth
mindset]{.underline}. [There is more dialogue about this now than there
has ever been before]{.underline}, and that is a very good thing.
Dialogue is the enemy of denial. Given [most]{.underline} people
actually [do recognise that endless growth is impossible on a finite
planet]{.underline}, that reality is starting to move into the realm of
social discussion. However, we can all help to speed this up (and we
encourage you to be part of this). Certainly, we have further to go, and
sure [there is great urgency, for we need to change things
immediately]{.underline}. However, when enough of us change our
worldview, when enough of us call for a steady state economy - then
[governments, business, the media and the education system will
follow]{.underline}. To quote the wisdom of Gandhi: \'You must be the
change you wish to see in the world\'.

In short, [we **don't think** there's much chance that a nuclear war
could cause humanity to go **extinct**]{.underline} or have a
predictably negative impact on humanity's ultimate long-run potential.
(With such a bleak subject, that at least seems like a bit of good
news.)

Here's why.

[Are there]{.underline} [enough **nuclear weapons** to kill everyone on
earth **without** nuclear **winter**?]{.underline}

Right now, **[no]{.underline}**.

Let's do a rough estimate.

We saw earlier that approximately [everyone within **2.5 km** of the
explosion of an 800 kt nuclear weapon would die.]{.underline} That's an
area of around 20 square kilometres. By one estimate, roughly 3.5
million square kilometres of the world are urban areas, so [you'd need
around 175,000 800 kt **nuclear weapons** to destroy **every urban
area**]{.underline} (and that's ignoring the fact that circles don't
perfectly tessellate). [That's a total explosive power of around
**140,000 megatonnes**]{.underline} (Mt).

Maybe there's a way to be more efficient -- smaller nuclear weapons
destroy more area for the same kt of TNT equivalent. Let's consider the
smallest bomb in the current US nuclear arsenal, the B61 nuclear bomb
with a yield of 300 tonnes. With those, you could destroy all urban
areas with only around 16,000 Mt (although you'd need 52 million
bombs).29

Here's a graph of explosive power in the world's nuclear arsenals over
time:

\[Graph Omitted\]

[The **maximum** explosive **power** we've]{.underline} ever [had
is]{.underline} around **[15,800 Mt]{.underline}**. That is to say, even
if we were to use perfectly-targeted and impractically small nuclear
weapons, [there have **never been enough** nuclear weapons to kill
everyone in]{.underline} the world's [urban areas]{.underline}.

[And]{.underline} that's before you consider that [only **55%** of the
world's population live in urban areas]{.underline}.

It's possible that we could, at some point in the future, end up with an
arms race worse than the Cold War. But even then it seems very unlikely
that the initial nuclear explosions could kill everyone on earth.

[What about radiation?]{.underline}

Our guess is that [**radiation and fallout** are less likely to be able
to kill everyone]{.underline} than just the force of the nuclear
explosions. As we saw earlier, [the area in which fallout is fatal
immediately is **relatively small**]{.underline} (and heavily influenced
by factors like the wind), [making it very likely that many
areas]{.underline}, especially in the southern hemisphere, [will receive
basically **no local fallout**.]{.underline} Similarly, we saw that
while previous explosions (like Chernobyl and all previous nuclear
tests) have caused some global fallout, that's far from the quantity
required to kill everyone. This could change with the development of
salted bombs. (Read more about whether radiation could kill everyone.)

\<\<CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

Could nuclear winter cause human extinction? The much more plausible
cause of human extinction is nuclear winter. As we saw above, the extent
to which nuclear winter would result in cooling is hugely uncertain ---
and Robock and Toon's model is likely an overestimate of the extent of
cooling. We've also discussed uncertainties about how many nuclear
weapons would be launched in a nuclear war and how those weapons would
be targeted. We're also not sure what the minimum viable population for
humans could be, but research by Luisa Rodriguez suggests that even if
99.9% of the population is killed, humanity is fairly likely to survive.
What's more, nuclear winter models tend to suggest that humans in much
of the southern hemisphere would survive even in a very large nuclear
war. One paper looks specifically at New Zealand during nuclear winter
and finds that food production would likely exceed the required calorie
level to survive. That said, if there's an arms race followed by a war
where many more nuclear weapons than we currently have are fired, the
risk of extinction would be higher --- especially if the war took place
in the southern hemisphere. But overall human extinction from nuclear
winter seems highly unlikely. It seems like even Robock and Toon
wouldn't disagree with that conclusion. Luke Oman, a co-author of Robock
(2007), said: "The probability I would estimate for the global human
population of zero resulting from the 150 Tg of black carbon scenario in
our 2007 paper would be in the range of 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 100,000... I
don't know offhand anyone that would estimate higher but I am sure there
might be people who would. \[I asked two colleagues\] who did respond
back to me, saying in general terms 'very close to 0' and 'very low
probability.\'"

\<\<CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

[Plausibly, **billions** of people **could be killed**]{.underline} as
the result of nuclear winter. Any event that deadly would be the worst
catastrophe in human history, and we should do much more to avoid and
understand the risks. [But **humanity**, as a species, would be very
likely to **survive**]{.underline}.

Could there be knock-on effects that lead to an existential catastrophe
some other way?

As we saw above, the effects of a nuclear conflict on society are
diverse and difficult to predict --- and certainly not limited to
fatalities.

But ultimately, we know very little. After all, we've only ever had one
war which included a nuclear explosion.

One way in which a nuclear war could be an existential risk is if the
chances of an existential catastrophe are higher in a post-nuclear-war
world than currently. For example, perhaps society after a nuclear war
would be more susceptible to a catastrophic pandemic, or perhaps
powerful weapons could end up in the hands of dangerous warlords. But
[there are also reasons to think that a **nuclear war** could
**decrease** the chances of **another catastrophe**: perhaps society
would **learn** and be more careful in future, and]{.underline} perhaps
[a **decreased** rate of **technological progress** would make it easier
to deal with new threats]{.underline}.

It should not come as a surprise that a [change of the dominant mode of
production]{.underline} of human society [takes place by a **clash** of
**brute forces**]{.underline}, of worldwide war. Limiting his attention
to the aspect of equality of men the anthropologist Walter Scheidel
describes in fascinating historical detail how [wars always preceded the
setup of large scale new organization of society]{.underline}, see
\[Scheidel, 2017\]. To which extent such a war again is on the agenda
today - contrary to the existence of DC - clearly is a question of
forecasting. The previous section of this chapter used a scenario
technique to sketch some contours of a possible third World War. These
scenarios are not independent, mixtures of them are to be expected, e.g.
a common strategy of a player in scenario 1 is to stir up national civil
war (scenario 2) in a satellite country of its opponent (e.g.
Yugoslavia); or to use the rhetoric of scenario 3 to support the fight
of national class struggle (scenario 2). [But will WW3 happen at
all?]{.underline}

[Not necessarily,]{.underline} but with a frightening high probability.
[Some **counterstrategies** already have been mentioned]{.underline}
along the discussion of the scenarios. [The **immediate
candidate**]{.underline}, of course, [is a **global peace
movement**]{.underline}. This movement already played a pivotal role in
ending the Vietnam War, being an incubator for the worldwide cultural
revolution of 1968. As the short life and the macroeconomic impotence30
of this rebellion showed, any movement with durable impact needs not
only roots in personal perceptions and feelings, it also needs a very
sophisticated and well-developed blueprint of the overall working of a
global democratic society. [A mode of production is a complicated
political economy entity, which needs a **complicated system design**.
Fortunately, the explosive **accumulation** of **human knowledge**, of
**science**, should]{.underline} be able to [provide just that -- if it
were not handcuffed by]{.underline} the singular tasks tailored by
[Disintegrating Capitalism. The next best counteraction]{.underline}
thus [is to **organize** the carriers of this knowledge]{.underline},
e.g. [scientists, in a **progressive global class**. Even if WW3
happens, chances are that a **restart is possible** and the
**blueprint** of a **better mode of production** is
**needed**]{.underline}. In this case Umberto Eco's vision of an
upcoming new Middle Ages31, with monasteries (today: universities?)
preserving and developing secret knowledge, might become reality.

The answer can be found in the creation of US settler sovereignty,
forged through war against Indigenous nations. In its early years of
existence, the United States needed free land to repay war debts
following its war of independence with Great Britain. Looking westward
from its original settler colonies to find this land, it created the
first federal administration of Indian affairs office within the
Department of War in 1789 to negotiate treaties with Indigenous peoples
to take land in \'fair trade.\' However, when Indigenous peoples refused
to sell their land, George Washington and the United States were ready
to wage war, or in Washington\'s words, to \'extirpate\' Indigenous
people. These efforts failed, largely because Indigenous nations were
more powerful than the thirteen states at the time. The fledgling US
government waited until another opportunity arose some thirty years
later to attack these nations and gain control of their lands. This time
it was through legalized theft. The most belligerent of these laws, the
Marshall Trilogy (1823-1832), unilaterally changed the status of Native
nations from foreign nations---their status according to treaties---to
colonized subjects of the United States. Between 1823 and 1832 the US
Supreme Court\'s first Chief Justice, John Marshall, as Din geographer
Andrew Curley states, \'defined the status and rights of Indigenous
nations within the United States as \'tribes,\' uncivilized peoples
dependent on it and subject to its complete authority.\'4 Drawing from
the Doctrine of Discovery to justify the domestication of Indigenous
nations, the Marshall Trilogy fabricated laws to alienate aboriginal
title and strip Indigenous nations of their independence. The Marshall
Trilogy demonstrates how the foreign status of Indigenous nations posed
an existential (as well as material) threat to the United States, which
had already proven its intentions for vast territorial, political, and
economic expansion. As the original foreign nations in the way of US
expansion, Indigenous nations thus had to be terminated by any means
necessary. Legalized theft was used alongside treaties and military
campaigns (which included starvation, imprisonment, massacres, and
scorched earth policies) to force termination.1 Its assault on
Indigenous nations shaped the United States\' first decades of
existence, not only giving birth to what we now know as the United
States, but also defining its very existence. Although not thought of as
such, the colonization of Indigenous people by the United States was,
and continues to be, a project of imperialist invasion. The Indian Wars
never ended; the United States simply fabricated new Indians---new
terrorists, insurgents, and enemies---to justify endless wars and
endless expansion. In her 2007 book New Indians, Old Wars, Dakota
scholar Elizabeth Cook-Lynn defines US treatment of Indigenous nations
as a quintessential form of imperialism: \'a national policy of
territorial acquisition through the establishment of economic and
political domination of other nations.\'2 She notes that wars today are
driven by the same \'colonial aggression and imperialistic nation
building\' as the wars of old.3 \'If there is one policy behind the
scenes that links the Iraqi experience of the twentieth century to the
Lakota/Dakota Sioux experience of the nineteenth,\' she writes, \'it is
the policy of imperialist dominance. Trampling on the sovereignty of
other nations for most of its several centuries of nationhood has been
the legacy of the American Republic\'s power.\'4The original imperial
violence enacted by the United States through Indigenous genocide and
colonization in North America continues to this day, all in the name of
natural resources, territorial positioning, and profit. Look at Standing
Rock in 2016 when Indigenous people defending their treaty lands against
the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline were brutalized by the
National Guard, which was sent in to detain and assault water protectors
and land defenders. Look at Hawai\'i and Mauna Kea where Kanaka
Maoli---Hawai\'i\'s Indigenous people---continually face violence from
the US military, along with being arrested by police for protecting
their sacred sites. Look at Venezuela, which is under sanctions for
refusing to cave to US bullying for oil. Look at Palestine, surrounded
by two of the largest US military aid recipients, Israel and Egypt. Look
at Okinawa, where in early 2019, tens of thousands of Japanese citizens
called for the closure of US military bases. Look at Guam. Look at
Vietnam. Look at Bolivia. Look at the Philippines. Look at Afghanistan.
Look at Iraq. The Indian Wars never ended; the United States simply
fabricated new Indians---new terrorists, insurgents, and enemies---to
justify endless wars and endless expansion. [Our struggles for
sovereignty and self-determination are the oldest anti-imperialist
struggles against the United States. In order for humanity to live free
from this violence, we must center the decolonization of Indigenous
nations and dismantle all laws, bombs, guns, sanctions, banks,
corporations, social customs, and agreements across the globe that
perpetuate US imperialism. Only then can we truly achieve liberation and
justice for Indigenous nations in Turtle Island and for all oppressed
nations across the world living under the boot of US domination. This
means that advocates for Indigenous decolonization in the Global North
must have strong analyses and an uncompromising stance on US
imperialism.]{.underline} Our struggles for sovereignty and
self-determination are the oldest anti-imperialist struggles against the
United States. We owe it to our kin in the Global South to remember that
our struggle for liberation is the same struggle they face.We must unite
against our common enemy. We have much to learn from one another. Our
Indigenous relatives and comrades who gathered in the spring of 2010 in
Cochabamba, Bolivia to draft the revolutionary climate document, the
People\'s Agreement, remind us that US imperialism does not happen only
through laws and war- fare[. **Imperialism wreaks havoc on the world
through capitalism**. It keeps resources in the hands of a few while the
rest of humanity starves and the Earth dies.]{.underline} [**Drawing
upon ecofeminist, ecosocialist, and Indigenous principles and knowledge
as tools to combat climate change**, the People\'s Agreement is a pact
from the Global South and social movements that **centers the needs of
the majority of the planet, calling for an end to capitalism rather than
maintaining the hyperconsumption of countries like the United States.
Ending the occupation everywhere thus means centering an effective and
principled approach to climate change**.]{.underline} Because the burden
of US-driven climate change has been externalized to the Global South
(and Indigenous people specifically), the People\'s Agreement makes the
case for enforcing climate debt, and names the special responsibility
that the United States---among all other developed countries---has for
paying this debt and other reparations for its imperialist violence.
**[Ending the occupation everywhere thus means centering an effective
and principled approach to climate change,]{.underline}** thereby
releasing the burden from Indigenous nations and placing responsibility
where it belongs. [To this end, we urge people in the United States to
organize campaigns that enforce the following demands for developed
countries listed in the People\'s Agreement: Restore to developing
countries the atmospheric space that is occupied by greenhouse gas
emissions. This implies **the decolonization of the atmosphere through
the reduction and absorption of their emissions**. Assume the costs of
technology transfer needs of developing countries arising from the loss
of development opportunities due to living in a restricted atmospheric
space. Assume responsibility for the hundreds of millions of people that
will be forced to migrate due to climate change caused by these
countries, and eliminate restrictive immigration policies, offering
migrants a decent life with human rights guarantees in their
countries.]{.underline} Commit to a new annual funding of at least 6
percent of GDP to tackle climate change in developing countries. This
funding should be administered free of conditions and should not
interfere with the national sovereignty or self-determination of the
affected communities and groups. Organizing to implement these demands
can also be viewed as a form of divestment and reinvestment. As the
People\'s Agreement notes, an annual funding pool to repay climate debt
that is comprised of 5 percent of the US\' GDP is \'viable considering
that a similar amount is spent on national defense, and that five times
more has been put forth to rescue failing banks and speculators.\'5 What
if we created a system where the funds spent on imperialism in the form
of defense and bank bailouts were redirected to heal the Earth by
decolonizing the atmosphere and building a dignified future for our
relatives in the Global South? This is not simply a question to ponder.
It is a life- or-death program we must take seriously. The United States
is holding the rest of the world hostage, denying dignity to billions of
people, and literally killing the Earth. Not to mention that [US
imperialism makes it impossible for other nations to practice basic
self-determination or make any meaningful gains when it comes to climate
change without constant interference and aggression from the United
States, which usurps and thwarts any efforts it perceives to be against
its own selfish interests]{.underline}. Only until we embrace
anti-imperialism as the heart of our movements for Indigenous liberation
will we be able to call ourselves true relatives---good relatives---to
our kin in the Global South. We should start by organizing campaigns and
movements to implement the People\'s Agreement.

#### Adopting eco-feminism solves the destruction of the environment via capitalism by appreciating the relationship we have with the Earth.

Teresa **Vojack '23** (Teresa Vojack, degree in business with a focus on
law/paralegal studies, Berkeley College, BASc in Women and Gender
Studies, University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, "When Ecofeminism Tells
A Story -- Indigenous Women & The Earth", pg online @

Accessed 7-2-2025 // PA-SS)

[The relationship between Indigenous women and the Earth is a sacred
one. It is truly a beautiful partnership built on mutual respect and
trust. Land and water are divine and treated as such. Indigenous women
are connected to the Earth in a spiritual way and use every aspect of
their interconnectedness to amplify their voices within their
communities. The Earth is their life force. It is their food
source.]{.underline} (This relationship also applies to animals.) It is
their source from which their education about life stems. Visualize a
tree. See the roots, the trunk, the branches, the stems, and the leaves.
[They see that tree as a life force, and they show it the utmost respect
as they value their interdependence with it. Unfortunately, this
relationship has been threatened as the result of capitalistic ideology
and patriarchal hierarch]{.underline}y. In order to understand why there
are issues now, and how these ideologies impacted them, we need to
understand the source of the change. Let's take a brief trip back in
history. Colonial theory bred a very divisive ideology in that it
created structure of government and community that was solely based in
systems and levels of hierarchy of and between people. They were based
upon class, race, gender, religion, education, and so on and so forth.
Herein enters the strategy of oppression, exploitation, and
intersectional theory circa colonial period. The Indigenous people did
not place in that class system whatsoever. We all know the basics of
what went down. Those that remained (that survived the genocide) were
left to scrounge for whatever scraps that they could which essentially
meant that they had to make deals with the colonists. Compromising their
own ways, principles, culture, and traditions in order to survive.
Suddenly a community of people that previously had little to no level of
class structure were grappling with things like money, levels of
government within their tribes, and modern ways which created separation
and oppression within their own people. How does this all tie into
Ecofeminism? "[Ecofeminism claims that patriarchal structures justify
their dominance through categorical or dualistic hierarchies:
heaven/earth, mind/body, male/female, human/animal, spirit/nature,
white/non-white" (Hobgood-Oster, 3). These binaries create separation.
Fast forward to today and we can still see this in our post-colonial
world having lasting and continued affects on Indigenous people,
particularly women]{.underline}. It is not just here in the US where the
Indigenous women are experiencing oppression. This is happening in the
US, Africa, Canada, India, South America, etc. When we look at the root
of the problem, we almost always come back to the same culprit:
colonialism.  [This is where the theory of Ecofeminism is of vital
importance as it examines the relationship between the oppression that
women experience in relation to the oppression that nature
experiences.]{.underline} Hobgood-Oster said, "Oppression of the natural
world and of women by patriarchal power structures must be examined
together or neither can be confronted fully" (Hobgood-Oster, 1). You
might wonder, how does the oppression of Indigenous women tie into
ecofeminism? How is it that the Earth and their relationship with it is
impacted? [Consider them parallel to one another; both experiencing
oppression simultaneously. The same people that are oppressing the women
as a matter of class structure treat the Earth and its resources in much
the same way: women as something less than men, the Earth as something
less than human. These binary structures have infiltrated and "classed"
their identities. ]{.underline} Women's roles have shifted drastically,
and it has resulted in an increase of violence directed at them by men.
Ecofeminist theory is critical here because it "replaces hierarchal
dualism with radical diversity and relationship" (Hobgood-Oster, Page
3[). This continues now with pipelines (oil industry) in the US and
Canada, as well as Palm oil plantations, and mining in Asia and the
Pacific regions.]{.underline}
https://asiapacific.unwomen.org/en/digital-library/publications/2015/02/the-impacts-of-land-dispossession-on-indigenous-women)
[Violations against collective rights continue everywhere. Land is
taken, people are displaced, and livelihood is threatened. All of this
industry threatens natural resources]{.underline}. The Indigenous women
are fighting back. The pipelines threaten their land and water. It is
their belief that water is the giver of life. When you take or threaten
their water you are threatening their very life force. You are also
threatening their food, transportation, and livelihood.

### Return Sovereignty

#### Returning sovereignty to indigenous people saves the ecosystem. 

Aggeliki **Taskoudi '21** (Aggeliki Taskoudi, Lawyer, ΜΑ in Human Rights
and Migration Studies from the University of Macedonia, "Between climate
change and capitalism: A legal perspective of the policies of Russia in
the Arctic area and the impact on indigenous peoples", pg online @
https://dspace.lib.uom.gr/bitstream/2159/25708/1/TaskoudiAggelikiMsc2021.pdf
// PA-SS)

This postgraduate thesis examines **[the interconnectedness of
capitalism with the climate change emerging in the Arctic
Circle.]{.underline}** The impact of global warming and climate change
in the Arctic [demand direct handling, thus challenging the current
legal framework of the Arctic area]{.underline}. The legal status of the
region is considered a controversial matter for international law and a
field of protracted negotiations. The primary and more compelling issue
discussed is the so-called 'Arctic paradox', which means that States
have gained access to new resources through the use of fossil fuels; and
this constitutes a real dilemma for the Arctic states and the
international community. Hence, the Arctic emerges as a socioeconomic
laboratory of the 'Antropocene' epoch. The Russian Federation is the
leader and the main stakeholder in the Arctic area. This country has the
longest Arctic coastline, the largest oil and gas deposits and the most
ambitious claims on the Arctic continental shelf. Consequently, the
Arctic strategy of Russia is focused on sovereignty and the two economic
perspectives of development in the region, which are oil and gas
exploitation and the opening of the Northern Sea Route. This thesis
reviews the central forces behind Russia's policy and its variations
during the warming of the Arctic. Indigenous peoples of the Russian
North historically inhabit the Arctic as nomadic groups. **[Their
culture, their ancestral land, their linkages with nature and in general
their whole ecosystem are being threatened by the climate change in the
Arctic, which is deteriorating faster than predicted]{.underline}**.
[Both the industrial development and the opening of the new shipping
route, as the main aims of the Russian strategy, will challenge the
survival of the various groups of indigenous peoples.]{.underline} **[In
order to deal with the challenges introduced by climate change,
indigenous peoples must be recognized as the only authorized
stakeholders of the region.]{.underline}** Their empowerment and their
participation to every step of the decision-making processes through the
recognition of their legal status and the operation of non-state actors
and NGOs are examined. Various indicators are analyzed that could
promote a balanced regional development, accounting for the environment,
economy, social needs and adaption of indigenous peoples

#### It\'s decolonization or extinction. 

Simon **Butler '21** (Simon Butler, co-editor of *Green Left Weekly*,
co-author of Too Many People? Population, Immigration, and the
Environmental Crisis, "No Hope for Earth without Indigenous Liberation",

Red Nation, pg online @

Accessed 6-30-2024 // PA- SS)

As heat and severe weather records are broken again and again, it should
be clear by now that there is no limit for capital. There will be no
scientific warning or dire catastrophe that leads to a political
breakthrough. No huge wildfire, terrible drought or great flood will
make governments and corporations change course. To carry on as they are
means extinction. And yet they still carry on: more fossil fuels and
fewer trees, more pollution and fewer species. Recognition that there is
no way out of this crisis without far-reaching, social upheaval animates
the proposals put forward in The Red Deal: Indigenous Action to Save Our
Earth. The short book was authored by activists from The Red Nation, a
coalition devoted to Indigenous liberation and made up of Native and
non-native revolutionaries based mainly in North America. **[The authors
make clear that they believe the campaign to halt climate change and
repair ecological destruction is bound up with the fate of the world's
Indigenous peoples. They say bluntly that "there is no hope for
restoring the planet's fragile and dying ecosystems without Indigenous
liberation" and that "it's decolonization or extinction."]{.underline}**
This is not just a rhetorical flourish. The Red Deal points out that the
approximately 370 million Indigenous people worldwide belong to
traditional lands that cover 22-25% of the world's surface. These
territories overlap with areas that hold more than 80% of the planet's
biodiversity[. Regaining control over their traditional lands is
essential for Indigenous people's ability to protect, restore and care
for them, as they did sustainably for millennia prior to their
dispossession.]{.underline} This makes [decolonization -- which "starts
with land back" to Indigenous peoples -- a critical part of The Red
Nation's proposals to avoid planetary extinction]{.underline}. The
authors of [The Red Deal emphasize that their vision of decolonization
"isn't exclusively about the Indigenous" but is instead meant to bring
together non-Indigenous and Indigenous activists in a common fight for
the future.]{.underline} They say: "What we seek is a world premised on
Indigenous values of interspecies responsibility and balance. We seek to
uplift knowledges, technologies, governance structures, and economic
strategies that will make these values possible, in the immediate future
and in the long term, and which always have the future health of the
land at the center of their design and implementation, Indigenous or
not. In this sense, decolonization is for, and benefits, everyone. It
also needs our collective cooperation to succeed."[Some recent
Indigenous-led movements against ecologically destructive projects have
won international support and attention,]{.underline} [such as the Oceti
Sakowin-led protests to halt the Dakota Access Pipeline at Standing Rock
and the Wangan and Jagalingou people's campaign to stop the huge Adani
coalmine in Queensland's Galilee Basin. But rather than focusing solely
on what Indigenous movements oppose, The]{.underline} Red Deal aims to
draw attention to "the revolutionary potency of what Indigenous
resistance stands for: [caretaking and creating just relations between
human and other-than-human worlds on a planet thoroughly devastated by
capitalism."]{.underline}

### Ecosocialist Degrowth

#### The alt is ecosocialist degrowth

Michael **Löwy et al. '22** (Marxist sociologist, philosopher, and
writer, emeritus research director in social sciences at the CNRS, "For
an ecosocialist degrowth" \[translated\]; 5/12/22; blog da boitempo;
https://blogdaboitempo.com.br/2022/05/12/por-um-decrescimento-ecossocialista/;
Accessed 7/16/25 // I.M.D)

Degrowth and ecosocialism are two of the most important movements---and
proposals---in the radical camp of the ideological spectrum. It\'s true
that not everyone in the degrowth community identifies as socialist, and
not everyone who considers themselves an ecosocialist is convinced that
the degrowth agenda is truly desirable. But there is a noticeable trend
of mutual respect and growing convergence between the two. It is
therefore important to map the broad areas of agreement between us and
to list some of the main arguments for ecosocialist degrowth . This is
what we seek to do below. 1. [**Capitalism cannot exist without
growth**.]{.underline} It requires a permanent expansion of production
and consumption, capital accumulation, and profit maximization. This
process of unlimited growth, based since the 18th century on the
exploitation of fossil fuels, is leading us to ecological catastrophe
and climate change. It poses a threat to the extinction of life on the
planet. The twenty-six United Nations Climate Change Conferences (COPs)
held over the past thirty years have highlighted the ruling elites\'
complete lack of will to halt this march toward the abyss. 2. **[Any
true alternative]{.underline}** to this perverse and destructive dynamic
[**must be radical**; that is, it **must address the root of the
problem: the capitalist system**, its exploitative and extractive
dynamics, and its blind and obsessive pursuit of growth. **Ecosocialist
degrowth** is one such alternative that **directly confronts capitalism
and growth**.]{.underline} Ecosocialist degrowth requires the social
appropriation of the primary means of (re)production and the
establishment of democratic, participatory, and ecological planning.
That is, the [**key decisions** about production and consumption
priorities would be **made by people** themselves **to meet real social
needs, always observing the planet\'s ecological limits**.]{.underline}
This means that [**people**, at various scales, **would exercise direct
power in democratically determining the content, quantity, and form of
production**; as well as in defining how to remunerate different types
of productive and reproductive activities that sustain us and the
planet.]{.underline} Ensuring equitable well-being for all does not
require economic growth. It requires a radical change in the way we
organize the economy and distribute social wealth. 3. [A **significant
decrease in production** and consumption is ecologically
indispensable.]{.underline} The first and most urgent measure is the
gradual elimination of fossil fuels. The same applies to the conspicuous
and wasteful consumption of the richest 1%. From an ecosocialist
perspective, degrowth must be understood in dialectical terms: many
forms of production (such as coal-fired facilities) and services (such
as advertising) must not only be reduced but effectively eliminated ;
[some industrial sectors]{.underline}, such as private automobiles or
livestock farming, [must be substantially reduced]{.underline} ; but
[others still need to be developed: agroecological agriculture,
renewable energy, health and education services, etc.]{.underline} For
sectors such as health and education, this development must be, above
all, qualitative. And even the most useful activities must respect the
limits of the planet. There can be no such thing as \"unlimited\"
production of any good. 4. [\"Productivist\" socialism]{.underline}, as
practiced in experiments like the USSR, [is a dead end. The same goes
for \"green\" capitalism]{.underline}, as advocated by corporations or
by so-called mainstream \"green parties .\" Ecosocialist degrowth is an
attempt to overcome the limitations of past socialist and \"green\"
experiments. 5. It is well known that the Global North is historically
responsible for most of the CO2 in the atmosphere. Rich countries should
therefore shoulder the majority of the degrowth process. But we believe
that the Global South should not attempt to replicate the North\'s
productivist and destructive \"development\" model, but rather seek a
different approach that prioritizes the real needs of populations in
terms of food, housing, and basic services, rather than simply
extracting ever more raw materials (and fossil fuels) for the capitalist
world market, or producing ever more cars for privileged minorities. 6.
[Ecosocialist degrowth also involves transforming, through a process of
democratic deliberation, current consumption patterns]{.underline}---for
example, [by ending planned obsolescence and the logic of non-repairable
goods---or transportation patterns---for example]{.underline}, by
significantly reducing the transport of goods by ship or truck (thanks
to the relocation of production), as well as air traffic. In short, it
is much more than a change in property forms: [it is a civilizational
transformation, a new \"way of life\" based on values of solidarity,
democracy, equality and freedom , and respect for the
Earth.]{.underline} Ecosocialist degrowth signals a new civilization
that breaks with productivism and consumerism, prioritizing shorter
workdays and, therefore, more free time to be dedicated to social,
political, recreational, artistic, playful, and erotic activities. 7.
Ecosocialist degrowth can only triumph if there is a confrontation with
the fossil fuel oligarchy and the ruling classes that control political
and economic power. Who is the subject of this struggle? It is
impossible to overcome this system without the active participation of
the urban and rural working class, which makes up the majority of the
population and is already having to bear the social and ecological ills
of capitalism. But [it is also necessary to expand the definition of the
working class to include]{.underline} those who undertake social and
ecological reproduction, [the forces now at the forefront of
socio-ecological mobilizations: youth, women, indigenous
peoples,]{.underline} and peasants. [A new social and ecological
consciousness will emerge through the process of self-organization and
active resistance of the exploited and oppressed.]{.underline} 8.
Ecosocialist degrowth is part of a broader family of other radical and
anti-systemic ecological movements: ecofeminism, social ecology, Sumak
Kawsay (Indigenous \"good living\"), poor-people\'s environmentalism,
Blockadia, the Green New Deal (in its most critical versions), and so
on. We are not seeking primacy here---we simply assess that ecosocialism
and degrowth share a powerful diagnostic and prognostic framework
capable of complementing the perspectives of these movements. Dialogue
and common action are urgent tasks in the current dramatic situation.

#### Green capitalism fails -- Ecosocialism frees us from the ever-looming profit motive, allowing society to focus on environmental reform and social liberation

Dennis **Sanders '20**, ( budget economist "Ecosocialism vs. "green"
capitalism - What path to save the planet?"; Dec 2020; Freedom Socialist

Accessed 7/14/25 // I.M.D)

The global environmental crisis may seem abstract to some unless they're
fleeing deadly fires or ferocious storms. These disasters appear to be
local and can be hard to connect to each other. But scientists
worldwide, in overwhelming numbers, say that [fossil fuel use and other
**unregulated industrial production are causing disastrous**,
intensifying global **heating**, **deforestation and
pollution**.]{.underline} Millions of species have been eradicated and
human settlement has come too close to wild animal populations. The
worldwide spread of Covid-19 is just the latest result of all this.
**The crisis is existential, and urgent.** The U.N. Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reported in 2018 that we had only about
12 years to contain global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius over
pre-industrial times, in order to avoid the most catastrophic harm. This
was a call for dramatic change. [Millions of people worldwide have
mobilized around this issue,]{.underline} including a series of Global
Climate Strikes in 2019 that more than 6 million people joined. [Yet
**government action has been minimal**, and the greenhouse gases that
drive climate change continue to rise.]{.underline} The question we must
answer is how to achieve the action that people want and need? How do we
win our way through to the solutions that the situation demands? "Green"
capitalism? The environmental movement has mostly focused on fighting
fossil fuels and building sustainable energy. Large companies, even in
the most polluting industries, spend serious advertising money promoting
their "green" initiatives. And because capitalists have found that green
energy can be profitable, they are pouring trillions of dollars into it,
with leaders of major environmental groups such as 350.org and the
Sierra Club as cheerleaders. There is so much more that needs to be
done, and fast.The recent film Planet of the Humans (see August 2020
Freedom Socialist review) correctly describes the crisis and the fact
that current green energy solutions (biomass, solar, wind) require as
much planetary damage to produce them as the benefits they deliver.In
fact, depletion of natural resources and rising greenhouse gas emissions
continue unabated. One example is that the rate of tree cover loss was
2.8% higher in 2019 than 2018, the equivalent of a football field every
6 seconds for the entire year. Among other things, trees absorb and
store carbon dioxide, and when forests are razed, greenhouse gases in
the atmosphere rise.This **[ruin of the planet is baked into the laws of
capitalism]{.underline}.** The system is fundamentally anarchistic,
[**needing constant growth and placing profit over all. It dominates
nature and ignores social costs. The damage to the planet since the
beginning of industrialization is the result of the capitalist economic
system.** Expecting the beneficiaries of the same system that got us
into this mess to get us out of it is
irrational**.**]{.underline}Ecosocialism --- the practical solution.
While Planet of the Humans does a good job of describing the urgency of
the problem and suggesting that capitalism might be an "issue," it
proposes no concrete solutions. It suggests that all technology is bad.
And it makes disturbingly vague comments on the problem of
overpopulation without addressing racist arguments that scapegoat people
of color and poor countries for it. In Ecosocialism: The solution for
survival on planet Earth, Steve Hoffman outlines the Freedom Socialist
Party's clear, ambitious, and necessary plan to make the transition.
[**Socialism** puts the ownership of industries and nature's resources
in public hands, **removing the profit motive** completely.]{.underline}
Workers of all types --- production, technical, and scientific ---
democratically control all aspects of making and delivering goods and
services for human needs. [**Gone is the** chaos, **over-production and
spectacular waste of the capitalist economy**. We no longer need to hope
"the market" will reach high enough profitability for change to
happen.]{.underline} In a human needs centered socialist economy,
[**environmental racism can be eradicated because people of color have
led the movement for change**.]{.underline} Shutting down and cleaning
up toxic production and storage facilities can be prioritized, workers
transferred to safe jobs, and families gain access to fantastic housing
and schools. And with full economic and social power for all, **[women
gain control over their own reproduction]{.underline}**, which has been
shown to reduce family sizes. The energy industry must be nationalized
first, to transition quickly from destructive forms of energy. The
fossil fuel and mining industries lurk behind even "sustainable" energy,
such as shoddy solar planned obsolescence and continuing reliance on
polluting forms of backup energy. Until we remove profit from energy
production, we won't be able to select the right technologies, but in a
socialist economy we have the power to make the best choices. All
sectors of the transportation industry --- autos, airlines, and
railroads --- must be nationalized, and integrated transportation
systems designed to eliminate the need for individual transport and
enable cities and towns to be redesigned. Capitalism consumes so much
energy for wasteful purposes that it is difficult to know what the real
need is. An example is the military. The U.S. military alone is the
largest user of petroleum products in the world. In addition to stopping
its murderous exploits, shutting it down would make a noticeable dent in
greenhouse gas emissions.

We must begin massive reforestation immediately. Deforestation is the
second largest contributor to global warming and also has the effect of
releasing nature's pathogens to society. We must transition away from
industrial farming such as monoculture crop production and unregulated
raising of animals for slaughter. These are the primary drivers of

A planet to save. The problems we face are urgent, difficult and

the young leaders of today's environmental movement.]{.underline} While
many argue that we don't have time to wait for a socialist revolution,
it is not an either-or proposition. We must fight for reforms while
building for the only realistic solution. We don't have time to delay.

[The struggle for green socialism in the long term requires fighting for
concrete and urgent reforms in the near term. Without illusions about
the prospects for a "clean capitalism," the movement for deep change
must try to reduce the risks to people and planet, while buying time to
build support for a more fundamental shift]{.underline}. [In particular,
the battle to force the powers that be to drastically reduce greenhouse
gas emissions remains a key front, along with local efforts to shift
toward agroecological methods, cooperative solar energy, and community
management of resources]{.underline}. Such concrete, immediate struggles
are important in and of themselves because partial victories are vital
for combating environmental deterioration and despair about the future.
For the longer term, these campaigns can help raise ecological and
socialist consciousness and promote activism from below. Both awareness
and self organization are decisive preconditions and foundations for
radically transforming the world system. The synthesis of thousands of
local and partial efforts into an overarching systemic global movement
forges the path to a Great Transition: a new society and mode of life.
This vision infuses the popular idea of a "movement of movements," which
arose out of the global justice movement and the World Social Forums and
which for many years has fostered the convergence of social and
environmental movements in a common struggle. Ecosocialism is but one
current within this larger stream, with no pretense that it is "more
important" or "more revolutionary" than others. Such a competitive claim
counterproductively breeds polarization when what is needed is unity.
Rather[, ecosocialism aims to contribute to a shared ethos embraced by
the various movements for a Great Transition. Ecosocialism sees itself
as part of an international movement: since global ecological, economic,
and social crises know no borders, the struggle against the systemic
forces driving these crises must also be globalized. Many significant
intersections are surfacing between ecosocialism and other movements,
including efforts to link eco-feminism and ecosocialism as convergent
and complementary.]{.underline}12 The climate justice movement brings
antiracism and ecosocialism together in the struggle against the
destruction of the living conditions of communities suffering
discrimination[. In indigenous movements, some leaders are
ecosocialists, while, in turn, many ecosocialists sees the indigenous
way of life, grounded in communitarian solidarity and respect for Mother
Nature, as an inspiration for the ecosocialist perspective. Similarly,
ecosocialism finds voice within peasant, trade-union, degrowth, and
other movements.]{.underline} The gathering movement of movements [seeks
system change, convinced that another world is possible beyond
commodification, environmental destruction, exploitation, and
oppression]{.underline}. [The power of entrenched ruling elites is
undeniable, and the forces of radical opposition remain weak. But they
are growing, and stand as our hope for halting the catastrophic course
of capitalist "growth." Ecosocialism contributes an important
perspective for nurturing understanding and strategy for this movement
for a Great Transition.]{.underline}

Converge! It's not just about winning new sectors of youth, or new
regions, new countries. It is also a question of [working patiently to
bring together social-trade union, feminist, peasant, anti-racist,
anticolonial and indigenous struggles at the grassroots level, across
borders. The contribution of feminists is important, especially because
they emphasize the importance of "caring." That of indigenous peoples is
inspiring because it shows the possibility of a new vision of
relationships between humans and non-humans.]{.underline} The peasants
of Via Campesina are already at the forefront, with their agroecological
program and direct action practices. [The key strategic challenge is to
detach the social-trade union movement from its alliance with
productivism; this means, primarily, the reappropriation of the
collective reduction of labor time, making it THE ecosocialist demand
par excellence.]{.underline} Organize, democratize and deepen! These
three goals go hand in hand. In general, with some exceptions, the
current movement suffers from a lack of organization and democracy. This
is partly the result of its spontaneity, obviously a good thing in
itself. But there is a void. Today, it is filled by individuals, by
long-standing associative structures, and by initiatives of small groups
on social networks. We must go beyond this stage, avoid "substitutism"
and prevent attempts to coopt the movements. Not to let up, but to build
long-term convergences requires a movement rooted in non-exclusionary
and democratic grassroots structures, that is to say, general assemblies
that elect people with revocable mandates to represent them
transparently wherever the struggle is coordinated and determines its
objectives. This mode of organization is the best way to deepen
awareness, to move from immediate issues (sorting waste, etc.) to more
structural issues. Challenge! Greta Thunberg has shown the way.
[Political and economic leaders are trying to co-opt her image, but so
far she has not fallen for "greenwashi]{.underline}ng." In Davos, in
front of the European Parliament and elsewhere, she has blamed the
leaders without compromise, without hesitation[. Let's follow her
example. Let's abandon any illusion that the political system "will come
to understand" the need to be "more ambitious" because there are
so-called "win-win" solutions to reconcile growth and profit with the
climate (that's a joke, there are none!).]{.underline} Let us adopt an
autonomous position, of systematic and uncompromising distrust. Let's
dare to disobey. [Systematically, joyfully and deliberately let us
undermine the legitimacy of the wealthy, their political
representatives, and of all those who refuse to leave behind the
productivist and growth-oriented framework.]{.underline} Invent! As part
of the challenge, legal actions such as 350.org's trial of the century
and immediate demands have their place. Let's challenge decision-makers
to take concrete action straight away: include the obligation in law to
reduce emissions, insulate all public and parapublic buildings, make
public transport free, ban advertising, abandon major works, etc. The
list of possibilities is endless. In the longer term, the climate
movement means that we have entered a new period of history in which the
"ecological question" will traverse and articulate more and more clearly
all social issues. Working towards the convergence of struggles in an
intersectional perspective follows logically. This poses now a long
series of unresolved questions. For example: what political tool can be
forged in the course of the struggle so that it is able to proceed from
the anti-capitalist struggle to the construction of a new world?
Radicalize! We must become aware of our strength. Without the climate
movement, COP21 would not have set the goal of keeping warming below
1.5°C. We must demand that this step forward be followed by concrete
measures, and ensure that they are up to the challenge and socially
just. This is the meaning of the current movement. The wealthy and their
political representatives are under pressure because they know that the
challenge of climate change is potentially revolutionary. All currents
are under pressure, so the lines tend to move. So, rather than letting
ourselves be drawn into the mined terrain of the strategy of small
steps, let us widen the gap. To do this, confront each new proposal with
the scientific diagnosis of what should be done to stay under 1.5°C of
warming without resorting to dangerous technologies while respecting
obligations towards the South as well as social justice[. Finding that
"there is no fit" will help the movement to become radicalized to the
point where it will be able to propose itself an anti-capitalist program
that meets the challenge, and to fight to impose the formation of a
government on this basis.]{.underline} A race at frightening speed. Will
it work? Nobody can guarantee it; we are caught in a race at frightening
speed between the hope of salvation and a plunge into barbarism. From
this angle, the situation presents some analogies with the one that
existed before the First World War, which Lenin characterized as an
"objectively revolutionary situation." The subjective factor was totally
unable to prevent the butchery of 1914-18, but from that butchery there
arose the Russian revolution --- which was suffocated from outside and
strangled from within. A century later, a similar question is posed, on
an even more disturbing scale: **[how far will humanity have to sink
into the trenches of climate catastrophe before finally turning against
capitalism to rid itself of this criminal system once and for
all]{.underline}**? Will the revolution --- the irruption of the masses
on the scene where their fate is at issue --- meet the challenge? Will
capitalism, on the contrary, maintain its bewitching power? These
questions are unanswered. They remind us of Gramsci, and his famous
quote about combining the pessimism of the mind with the optimism of the
will. That optimism is a categorical imperative, because we are certain
of only one thing: the outcome of the race between the disaster and
consciousness of the disaster depends on the re-emergence on a mass
scale of an emancipatory project capable of overcoming the terrible
threats to humanity posed by productivist folly. **[For the ecosocialist
project, there is no shortcut, no way other than
struggle.]{.underline}**

However, [getting rid of capitalism is **not the
solution**.]{.underline} In the last century, we have experienced an
alternative system of [central planning]{.underline} in the Soviet Union
[and]{.underline} the [communist countries]{.underline} of Central and
Eastern Europe. This system [did not allow]{.underline} these countries
to move [beyond an intermediate level of development]{.underline}
because [it **did not provide the freedom and economic
incentives**]{.underline} for individuals [to push the frontiers of
innovation.]{.underline} We have also recently experimented with
[degrowth]{.underline}, but do we really want to [sustain
the]{.underline} way of [life]{.underline} that was ours
[during]{.underline} the first **[lock-down]{.underline}**?
[Capitalism]{.underline} is a spirited horse: it can easily run away,
out of control. But if you hold the reins firmly, it [goes where you
want it to]{.underline}. Despite favourable developments, the United
States is still far from a system that protects individuals against the
risks of job loss or illness, against macroeconomic shocks such as the
2008 or Covid-19 crisis, or against climate risk. As for the European
countries, they have not yet been able to create the ecosystem --
universities, institutional investors, venture capitalists, patrons,
DARPA -- that would allow them to be initiators and not followers in the
technological revolutions to come, and they are in great danger of being
overtaken by China. I believe in the convergence of these models rather
than in the overcoming of the capitalist system.

Faced with the 'rise in inequality', the 'concentration of rents', the
'casualisation of work' and the 'deterioration of health and the
environment', you call in your latest book 1 [for a better regulation of
capitalism in order to direct creative destruction towards **the
objective of fair**er and **green**er **growth.**]{.underline} What
would be the essential features of this?

[We must seek to better **regulate capitalism** rather than trying to
overcome it at all costs.]{.underline} [Creative
destruction,]{.underline} which is its driving force, has [enabled a
considerable growth in our living standards since the first industrial
revolution.]{.underline} Our main challenge today is to better
understand the drivers of this power and then to [direct it towards the
goal of **greener and fairer growth**: new innovations are constantly
occurring]{.underline} and rendering existing technologies obsolete, new
businesses are constantly competing with existing businesses, and new
jobs and activities are being created and are constantly replacing
existing jobs and activities. On the one hand, there is a need to
protect: to support viable companies in order to save jobs and preserve
accumulated human capital, but on the other hand, there is a need to
reallocate resources, in order to encourage the entry of new companies
and new activities, either more efficient or more responsive to
consumers' needs.

The state, business and civil society form an essential triangle to
accompany, rather than halt, the process of creative destruction.

[State intervention]{.underline} is [essential]{.underline} to redirect
technical change [towards green innovation]{.underline}, and [thus avoid
an environmental disaster]{.underline}: without substituting itself to
private firms, it must act on affecting the latter's incentives. In the
[absence of state intervention, companies will spontaneously choose to
**innovate in polluting technologies** and will do so more and more
intensively over time because of the path dependency
effect.]{.underline} A recent study 2 showed that car companies that
innovated in combustion engines in the past tend to innovate in
combustion engines in the future, to the detriment of green innovation.
The consequence will be an increase in pollution, and an acceleration of
global warming. [The intro]{.underline}duction [of a carbon tax or a
subsidy for green innovation has the effect of making the change of
technology less costly and redirecting the **innovative forces** of car
companies towards **electric engines.**]{.underline} But the state
cannot be the only actor in the ecological transition. There are limits
to what the state can achieve on its own, as Roland Bénabou and Jean
Tirole explain 3 . On the one hand, governments are often exposed to
lobbying by different interest groups. On the other hand, global warming
is a global problem, over which the government of a particular country
has little control.

Civil society may also be able to play a role, and in particular
consumers, who appear to be increasingly willing to integrate social and
environmental considerations into their product choices. Indeed,
consumers have the power to greatly influence the choices of firms 4 .
For example, in countries where consumers express genuine concern for
the environment, increased competition in the automotive market is
leading companies to innovate more in green technologies, such as
electric engines. The idea here is intuitive: Since competition leads
firms to innovate more to improve their price-performance ratio and
escape competition from rival firms, [in an economy where consumers
value the environment and innovation is oriented, increased competition
leads firms to innovate to lower the ratio between the price and the
environmental cost of the product, ie to innovate in the discovery of
new]{.underline}, [greener products to escape competition.]{.underline}
Conversely, in an economy where consumers are more concerned about the
price of goods than their environmental cost, increased competition will
not encourage green innovation and will exacerbate the environmental
problem. This is the 'China Syndrome': increased competition lowers
prices and increases consumer demand; production increases and so does
pollution.

#### Decoupling is empirically proven and growth solves climate change.

degrowth: Economic and climatic consequences of pessimist assumptions on
decoupling" Ecological economics Vol 213, July 22 2023,

4\. Discussion: demystifying decoupling

If degrowth scholars are right in their pessimistic assumptions about
decoupling, in their scepticism towards the possibilities of using CDRs,
and in their support for stringent emission reduction targets, they are
right in that the only way to avoid dangerous climate change is through
degrowth. They just have not spelled out exactly how much degrowth their
assumptions translate into, if we follow Hickel and Kallis (2020): 86%
over 30 years (89 if measured per capita) globally, and, if we take
fairness seriously, over 95% for most developed countries. Even less
stringent emission targets, which are probably not compatible with 1.5
°C, lead to massive levels of degrowth for most parts of the world.

If this is the only way to avoid disastrous climate change, it should be
done. The prospects of runaway climate change are arguably worse than an
equalization of global incomes around a level that is low, but still
would allow people to survive. The main problem is, however, that these
scenarios must be regarded as very unlikely. The prospect of countries
like the US to voluntarily cut their per capita income with 98 or 86%,
or China with 8 or even 21%, just not seems great. These scenarios, if
anything, are "out of scope".

Does this mean that there is no way to avoid the dilemma of either
climate disaster or economic collapse? Not if [the decoupling pessimism
of degrowth scholars is mistaken.]{.underline} In this discussion, I
attempt to demystify the "myth of decoupling".

Jackson, 2009, Jackson, 2017 [makes no clear intellectual case for why
high levels of decoupling are impossible.]{.underline} His chapter on
the "myth of decoupling" points to the scarce historical evidence of
absolute decoupling, which, he admits, does not make it less important
nor "does it rule out the possibility entirely" (2009, p. 75). This is
important and logical: Just because something has not happened does not
imply that it cannot happen. It must be acknowledged [that **sufficient
levels of emission reductions** have only]{.underline} seldomly [taken
place during **economic growth**]{.underline}. [But there
is]{.underline}, on the other hand, [no]{.underline} encouraging
[examples of]{.underline} deep [decarbonization under conditions of
degrowth]{.underline} either.

Thus, if we are looking at history for guidance, prospects are bleak. If
it was not for all the human suffering, the collapse of the Soviet
economy could have served as a positive example of degrowth, since
Russia\'s CO2-emissions were reduced very rapidly, with 42% over nine
years. But there are also less discouraging examples of energy
transitions where emissions were reduced almost as fast and under
conditions of relative social stability. [France reduced its emissions
with roughly 25% during the 1980s, and Sweden with 40% during the 1970s
and 80s.]{.underline} During the most intense period, [1979 to 1984,
**emissions fell with 32% under a** **period of**]{.underline}
(moderate) **[economic growth,]{.underline}** which corresponds to an
annual, mean decoupling rate of 9%.1 Even stretched out over a longer
period, the 20 years from 1970 (when Swedish emissions peaked) to 1989,
the [mean annual decoupling rate was 4.5%]{.underline}2 -- more than
Hickel and Kallis\' model regard as feasible. In more recent years, from
the 1990s until today, Denmark has more than halved its fossil CO2
emissions. From Denmark\'s peak emission in 1996 to 2018, the mean
annual decoupling rate was 5.1%.3

None of these cases (see Fig. 1) are as far and wide reaching as to
serve as raw models for the climate transition necessary, and we should
be humble about that. As stated by IPCC, 2018 (p. 15), the "systems
transitions" needed to limit global warming to 1.5 °C with no or limited
overshoot "are unprecedented in terms of scale, but not necessarily in
terms of speed". The path we need to take has not been taken before. But
that does not mean that it is impossible to walk.

and Sweden.

After the peek at history, Jackson turns to the arithmetic argument
described above: he shows that in order to meet the climate targets, the
rate of decoupling needs to increase to levels that seem incredible:
from 0.7% to 7%, but if fairness should be considered and more stringent
targets are to be met, to at least 10%. Such an increase -- tenfold or
more -- is massive and therefore appears as unlikely, but Jackson
provides very few, if any, factual arguments for why it should be
impossible. His conclusion, that there is "no credible" (Ibid., p. 86)
scenario of continuous growth and ecologically sustainability is mainly
based on the arithmetic argument: that increases of the rate of
decoupling of factor 10 or more just seem unrealistic.

But only staring at the numbers is not very convincing. A tenfold
increase in decoupling rate certainly requires large efforts, but why
should it be impossible? Why is 7 or even 10% impossible, when there are
examples of sustained decoupling of 5%? Decoupling CO2 from GDP is not
about numerology, it is, at its core, the result of the efforts that
society take to reduce the use of fossil fuels under GDP growth (which
is the normal condition under capitalism). And [there are several
examples]{.underline} that shows that [societies can transform their
energy systems in very decisive ways]{.underline} (for more examples,
see Sovacool, 2016). Actually, in the second edition of his book,
Jackson (2017, p. 102) indicates that high rates of decoupling might be
technically possible but not "without confronting the structure of
market economies". That would mean that high levels of decoupling are
contingent on economic reform, which is far from numerical
mystifications and in accordance with the argument made here.

Hickel and Kallis\'s argument for an upper limit of 4 % of decoupling is
another case of mystification. Their data are so-called empirical models
that allow users to experiment with different scenarios for emissions
reductions. The most optimistic scenario of decoupling they find is in a
model called C-ROADS (see section 2.4). In C-ROADS, decoupling can be
turned up to 4% per year during the most "aggressive" policies
thinkable: subsidies of renewable energy and nuclear power plus carbon
taxes. But, as noted by Hickel and Kallis (2020), 4 % is not compatible
with the climate goals under conditions of economic growth, and
therefore green growth "are beyond what existing empirical models
indicate is feasible".

The question is, however, what bearing those models have on our actually
existing possibilities for decoupling. An empirical model is a model,
that is an attempt to reduce the complexity of reality into a manageable
number of variables and relate them to each other in predefined ways.
They are helpful tools for scenario-making but, and this should be
self-evident for critical scholars, they are still reductionist and
based on uncertain assumptions influenced by hegemonic discourses. Their
output should therefore not be conflated with what is humanly possible.
Indeed, it would be very surprising if not critical scholars such as
Hickel and Kallis could imagine more "aggressive policies" than energy
subsidies and carbon taxes. Just consider one policy that they have
themselves proposed, resource caps (Mastini et al., 2021). [If a
resource cap for fossil fuels was inserted into the model, emissions
could be turned down at the speed of their wish]{.underline} (it would
certainly also influence GDP, but in contingent ways).

If we further contemplate that there are [historical examples of
sustained levels of decoupling higher than Hickel and Kallis suggest is
possible, their upper limit of 4 % appears as outright
strange.]{.underline} The very idea that such a limit exists is strange.
While physical laws limit what is physically possible, [decoupling is
clearly a social phenomenon.]{.underline} To a large degree, it is what
we make it into.

It deserves to be repeated, however, that impact decoupling, such as of
CO2, is generally more easily achievable than resource decoupling.
Parrique et al. (2019) constructs no less than seven arguments against
absolute decoupling, but many of them are not directly relevant for
decoupling GDP and CO2 emissions. Their conclusion is nonetheless stated
with utmost clarity (Ibid., p. 10): "green growth, that is economic
growth that is sufficiently decoupled from environmental pressures, is
not possible". Also, according to other degrowth scholars, such as
Victor (2008), Jackson (2009), Kallis (2018) and Hickel (2020),
continuous economic growth is most likely not compatible with climate
stabilization. If they are right, the only way to reach the climate
goals is by massive degrowth. In practice, at least Hickel therefore
rule out the 1.5 °C target. But their defeatism is not based in robust
arguments.

I have elsewhere (Warlenius, 2022, p. 259--267) sketched a realist,
dynamic theory of decoupling. I there argue, against both the unfounded
pessimism of degrowth scholars and the excessive optimism of many green
growth advocates, that EKC-type of developments for carbon emissions
does not follow from the spontaneous operation of the market forces, yet
can be produced socially and politically, and will most likely require
forceful state action based on popular support. The theory is supported
by the detailed prospects for energy efficiency and a low- or zero
emission energy and transportation infrastructure that have been put
forward by e.g., IEA (2021), IRENA (2020), Pollin (2020), as well as the
burgeoning literature on a 100% renewable energy system (for an
overview, see (Hansen et al., 2019).

Upon closer analysis, the static [relations between growth and
environmental impacts]{.underline} that is suggested by e.g., the IPAT
equation seems fraudulent; rather, the relations [are
dynamic.]{.underline} Under normal conditions, economic growth increases
emissions (while carbon intensity declines), and degrowth (recession)
stabilizes emissions. Yet at the same time, **[growth is]{.underline}**
probably [**more likely than degrowth** to enable the conditions needed
for]{.underline} intense [climate transitions]{.underline}: the deeply
transformative, costly transitions called for by e.g., IPCC (2018). Two
main decarbonization pathways appears as possible. A low- or degrowth,
slower but more fundamental transition, or a [growth based]{.underline},
forceful and fast [transition]{.underline}. The first risks to be too
slow to avoid climate disaster or have intolerable social consequences,
the second risks to be undermined by further economic growth. I
nonetheless find the second [more realistic and more likely to
happen]{.underline}, and therefore worth fighting for, well aware of the
likelihood for new contradictions between growth and environmental
impacts to await down the road. Disregarded which is preferred, the two
scenarios [undo the claim that]{.underline} only [degrowth can "save"
the climate.]{.underline}

#### Growth is [sustainable]{.underline}, and biotech innovation averts planetary boundaries by facilitating [adaption, carbon sequestration]{.underline}, and reducing [resource use]{.underline}. Absolute decoupling is possible without offshoring. 

**Smith 23** \[Noah Smith; Assistant professor of finance at Stony Brook
University with a PhD in Economics from the University of Michigan;

https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/degrowth-we-cant-let-it-happen-here?utm_source=%2Fsearch%2Fdegrowth&utm_medium=reader2\]

Which is not to say that degrowth contains zero links to actual science,
history, or economics. For example, a degrowther did point me to a paper
by Steffen et al. (2015) in Science --- reputable mainstream scientists
in a very reputable mainstream journal. The paper basically argues that
humanity is currently using too much nitrogen and phosphorus and causing
too much biodiversity loss. Assuming the paper is a good one --- and
degrowthers would never link you to any critiques, even though they
definitely exist --- it is still only one tiny thread in the degrowth
tapestry. [What if we just...used less phosphorus and nitrogen, but
**kept on growing our economies?** We've done that with plenty
of]{.underline} other [natural resources. Degrowthers will wave this
idea away]{.underline}**;** as the infographic above demonstrates**,**
["Green growth is unlikely"]{.underline} is one of their foregone
conclusions.

[That conclusion]{.underline}, by the way, [is based on the **thinnest
of reeds**]{.underline}**.** One of [degrowthers' **central claims** is
that the decoupling of economic growth from environmental damage and
resource use is **impossible**. Parrique has a long
document]{.underline} explaining why he thinks this is the case, and it
is [similar to other degrowther critiques of decoupling]{.underline}
that I've read**.** [What they all share is a **reliance on past trends
to forecast future** trends]{.underline} **---** [decoupling has never
happened, they say, so it won't happen in the future.]{.underline}

[That's a complete fallacy]{.underline}, of course. [Just because
something is unprecedented doesn't mean it's
impossible]{.underline}**.** You might as well say ["A coordinated
program of global degrowth is **impossible because it has never been
done before**, case closed, degrowth is finished, you can all go
home."]{.underline} That would be unfair, and it's equally unfair to say
that just because growth hasn't yet been decoupled from resource use,
that it never will.

[Except...it has. Take carbon emissions]{.underline}**,** probably the
most threatening form of environmental damage. [A great many countries
**have now decoupled the growth** of their economies from the growth of
their **carbon emissions:**]{.underline}

height="4.853354111986001in"}

[This is not relative decoupling]{.underline} **(**[where environmental
damage grows]{.underline}**,** but more slowly than GDP[**),** nor is it
merely per capita decoupling. It is **absolute decoupling**, where GDP
grows and carbon emissions shrink. It's also **trade-adjusted ---
i.e.**]{.underline} it's [**not due to offshoring** of
emissions]{.underline} --- so there's [no reason to think that this
can't happen on a global scale]{.underline} (indeed, [global emissions
may **already have peaked**, while global GDP growth
continues]{.underline}**).**

[Faced with this reality, **degrowthers**]{.underline} do a couple of
things. First, they [simply **move the goalposts.** After relative
decoupling]{.underline} was accomplished, [they claimed]{.underline}
that [absolute decoupling was impossible]{.underline}**,** [based of
course on historic trends]{.underline}. When it became clear that
absolute decoupling was in fact happening, [the degrowthers argued
that]{.underline} OK, well, yes, it's happening, but [**it can't happen
fast enough** to save the planet.]{.underline}

And yes, [it's true that we haven't yet decoupled enough to save the
planet]{.underline}. The operative word here being
["yet"**.**]{.underline} It should be apparent from even a moment's
consideration that [decoupling of a sufficient sufficient to save the
planet will not be evident in the historical data until the planet has
already been saved]{.underline}. In other words, [degrowthers will
**continue** to insist **that green growth is a fool's errand** until a
number of years after that errand **has already
succeeded.**]{.underline}

[A second degrowther response is to lump in various kinds of resource
use all together in order to obscure falling trends in the use of
specific resources]{.underline}. For example, Jason Hickel and some
other degrowthers will often use total tonnage of resource use as a
measure of environmental impact. There are at least two obvious problems
with this practice, besides the fact that it's just one more case of
assuming that historical trends are laws of the Universe. First, [it's
**scientifically incoherent**]{.underline}. How do you measure climate
change in terms of tons of resources used? [How do you compare a ton of
biodiversity loss with a ton of tin mined out of the
ground?]{.underline} If you recycle a ton of wastewater, did you use
another ton of resources? And so on. Second, [using gross tonnage
intentionally **obscures one of the most important sources** of green
growth --- the substitution of more common resources for scarcer
resources.]{.underline}

In other words, this is very poor science indeed. [And yet it's on
**sweeping assertions** like this that degrowth hangs its whole
worldview; without tentpoles like "decoupling is impossible", the whole
edifice becomes merely a collection of disparate pieces of research
about environmental harms]{.underline}. That would be more
scientifically grounded, but [it would probably not be the kind of thing
you could organize a whole European Parliament meeting
around.]{.underline}

#### Degrowth fails -- causation not correlation, transition fails, growth solves,

Accessed 7-14-2025; AY\]

Amid the French protests of May 1968, the idea of degrowth was born
under the name décroissance. It quickly gained traction in Parisian
Marxist circles with work from the likes of Austrian French philosopher
André Gorz and others. When in 1972 the Club of Rome published The
Limits to Growth, the term décroissance came to the mainstream.

Today décroissance is having another moment, this time under its English
moniker, [as degrowth enters both policy circles and popular discourse.
It is, however, a distraction for left climate movements, one that we
can ill afford when the world has such limited time to
decarbonize.]{.underline}

[Degrowth provides neither empirically grounded, actionable solutions
nor a credible theory of social and political change. It suffers from
four big problems.]{.underline}

[1. Degrowth often **confuses correlation for causation** and
**overextrapolates** from the past.]{.underline}

[The strength of the degrowth movement comes from accurately recounting
how wealthy countries developed through the use of fossil
fuels.]{.underline} Fossil fuels and economies coevolved together: coal
powered the earliest factories in the Industrial Revolution. Electricity
then lit, connected, and expanded cities around the world. Oil and gas
knit the post--World War II world economy together.

Economic growth, then, went hand in hand with the growth of emissions.
[The degrowth movement argues that while switching to green growth may
be theoretically possible, sufficiently rapid decarbonization requires
degrowth.]{.underline}

The focus on growth, however, may [lead to confusing correlation for
causation, and at worst **distorting our policy** priorities. Therefore,
an elementary reminder is in order: carbon emissions come from burning
carbon --- they are CO2 emissions, not GDP emissions.]{.underline} To
decarbonize, we need to replace carbon energy sources with clean energy,
and repressing growth will not solve the problem of financing
electrification and energy-input replacement.

This point may seem obvious, but many people seem to forget it and focus
too narrowly on economic growth and GDP (which is of course a
controversial indicator of well-being). Growth is contingent upon energy
input, but that energy does not need to come from carbon. Those who
argue that decoupling emissions from GDP cannot happen fast enough are
extrapolating from the historic association of emissions and growth. If
historical trends routinely and straightforwardly predicted our economic
future, then much of the risk that we know to be endemic to the stock
market and the financial sector would not exist, as the past would be a
sure guide to what's coming next.

2[. Degrowth doesn't acknowledge that redistribution can drive
growth.]{.underline}

[Degrowth requires political suppression of consumption and production.
To offset the massive income reductions this would entail for poorer
populations, many degrowth experts argue that this decrease in
production and consumption should be **accompanied by wealth
redistribution**.]{.underline}

At first glance, that proposal looks reasonable --- we can decrease
emissions and inequality at the same time. But simultaneously reducing
growth and redistributing resources is not so simple. [Redistribution to
lower income groups or populations who have a higher propensity to spend
can actually increase household consumption, which all other things
equal may in turn increase emissions.]{.underline}

[Redistribution is a worthy goal, but on its own it will not decarbonize
the economy.]{.underline} Some nuanced degrowth writing focuses loss
prescriptions on wealthier residents within rich countries and rich
countries overall. This is sensible, [but it ignores the emissions that
are likely to come with emerging market economy (EME) development in
countries like India. It also ignores the recoil of investment in EMEs
that would result from reductions in consumption and growth in wealthy
countries, which would tend to bring excess capital back home to the
richer countries.]{.underline}

Degrowth advocates might argue that these problems could be addressed
through national and global planning regimes, which could (e.g.)
restrain households from increasing consumption too much and force
capital to invest more in poorer countries. But the kind of [state
planning required to mitigate emissions and regulate behavior while
reducing overall production and consumption would need to be a globally
coercive regime, with otherworldly institutional capacities and
knowledge. Imagine the surveillance and punishment apparatuses needed to
constantly monitor people around the world to enforce production and
consumption quotas.]{.underline} Few would voluntarily agree to this
system; governments now are not even following through on relatively
modest climate accords. Maybe a sacrifice of democratic governance would
be worth it, as some have argued. But even if an authoritarian regime of
global planning were justified, what social forces would have the
capacity to institute one?

To be clear, this isn't an objection to planning per se. To address the
climate crisis, we clearly need a big dose of democratic economic
planning that prioritizes ecological goals over profit. But large-scale
planning becomes both more technically and morally fraught when it
involves forcing most of the world's population to accept lower living
standards.

Historically, industrial transformations have required growth, and
relatively lower growth in the context of such transformations has led
to horrific casualties (e.g., the Soviet Union's creation of famine in
Ukraine during its industrialization drive in the early 1930s). Lower
growth means more trade-offs and losses in a transition, meaning that
new capital formation comes at the cost of greater suppression of
consumption and thus of living standards.

This is because the new capital needed to transition has to come from
somewhere. It can come from reallocating resources from traditional
growth sectors (e.g., from agriculture to industry) or from a rising
tide of growth that can improve the living standards of the majority.
Therefore, a global investment boom is necessary to pay for
decarbonization --- not a decline in investment, as many degrowth
advocates claim.

3\. [Degrowth adopts unjustified assumptions from orthodox
economics.]{.underline}

[Degrowth has a lot in common with carbon-tax advocacy]{.underline}.
Carbon-tax supporters, like degrowthers, have advocated decreases in
consumption as the way to decarbonization.

This approach has not gone well historically. The French government
imposed carbon taxes without offering adequate substitutes for citizens
(such as affordable electric vehicless or sufficient public
transportation options); as a result, living costs increased for
lower-income households who spent larger shares of their budgets on
energy, and eventually widespread social unrest resulted.

The truth is that a narrow emphasis on reducing consumption is deeply
rooted in orthodox economics. [An orthodox economics perspective would
claim that we must decrease consumption to decrease
emissions.]{.underline} This outlook tries to predict the future by
holding variables in the present constant. It assumes that resources and
worker productivity are always being maximized and also that energy unit
costs will not decrease.

Those are false assumptions: [resource utilization, productivity, and
energy costs change a great deal. Resource utilization can become more
efficient over time; think about how small computers have become since
the 1980s thanks to increasingly powerful microchips. Productivity and
efficiency constantly vary.]{.underline} Why else would firms share
information and techniques with each other in order to improve
themselves on those measures? And energy costs can also decrease ---
look at the recent collapse in the price of solar.

This means that decarbonization through decreased consumption may not be
necessary. In fact, carrots (economic gains) have had more political
success historically than sticks (economic losses) when implementing
climate policies.

Decarbonization will likely require massive investment. By the most
sophisticated measures, global decarbonization will cost roughly \$4
trillion per annum, and some version of state-led green growth is
probably our best route. Such investment on a smaller scale is already
increasing the availability of carbon-free substitutes in the United
States and China. Degrowthers often focus too much on economic
suppression [when we need to acknowledge that electrification, energy
replacement, and economic justice may require one last economic
boom.]{.underline}

4\. Degrowth doesn't have an adequate theory of political
transformation.

From the radical social reorganization of the Paris Commune to the
policy outcomes that followed the civil rights movement, historians and
social scientists have studied the conditions that lead to successful
political transformation. To explain movement strengths or weaknesses
and predict or evaluate movement successes and failures, many scholars
will plug a movement into what they call a "political opportunity
structure." A political opportunity structure has three components: (1)
public consciousness, (2) organizational or mobilizing strength, and (3)
macro political opportunities.

What is the political opportunity structure of the degrowth movement?
Despite academic chatter, the degrowth movement is irrelevant to most
people in the world. To get a pulse of public opinion, I compared Google
searches of "degrowth" versus "how to get rich."

Google searches for "degrowth" versus "how to get rich." Note: On
y-axis, the value of 100 indicates peak popularity. Explore more here.
The recent peak in "how to get rich" searches represents the Netflix
release of a show under that name.

Not only do most people prioritize growth and prosperity over addressing
climate change (as discussed throughout), but most people also do not
know or care about degrowth. The degrowth movement fails in the arena of
public consciousness in both opinion and salience.

Things look even more dire when examining other aspects of the
movement's political opportunity structure. There is no major social
movement organization or institution centering degrowth in its platform.
If such organizations do exist, they have feeble resources and networks,
which are key ingredients for movement success. The civil rights
movement, for instance, boasted black colleges, churches, and activist
organizations (the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the Student
Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, and the Congress of Racial Equality)
tied together through strong networks and alliances. Degrowth has no
natural constituency, and creating it would require a global-scale
transformation of political consciousness.

Finally, the macro political conditions to support the movement are not
present. There are no political regimes interested in advancing the
movement. Not even the European Union, arguably the international bloc
most committed to decarbonization right now, is interested in degrowth.
At the "Beyond Growth" Conference, European Commission president Ursula
Von der Leyen stated, "A growth model centered on fossil fuels is simply
obsolete" and called for "a different growth model that is sustainable
far into the future." She's talking about green growth, not degrowth.

Furthermore, studies find again and again that democracies prioritize
economic prosperity over real decarbonization. Economic growth can
enhance people's quality of life (barring wars, or the trend of wealth
concentration outpacing growth that Thomas Piketty has documented).
National governments are legitimized by growth, and when they fail to
provide it, there are political consequences.

If economic stagnation often leads to explosions of anger at the status
quo in wealthy countries, imagine how emerging market economies will
deal with forced degrowth (those countries' growth rates in the coming
years are projected to dwarf those of advanced market economies). It is
hard to believe that emerging economies will accept nondevelopment for
the sake of climate goals. (No wonder social scientists in BRICS and
non-OECD countries favor green growth over degrowth.)

Degrowthers might reasonably retort that proponents of green growth
policies also lack the public consciousness, organizational or
mobilizing strength, and macro political opportunities to win meaningful
change. The difference is that the vast majority of society has an
interest in an egalitarian green growth agenda along the lines of the
Green New Deal, because they stand to benefit from a massive public
investment in green jobs, infrastructure, and public transportation that
would raise their standard of living. And organized workers in strategic
sectors like electricity and auto have the structural leverage to win
key climate demands.

In other words, the broader climate movement has a potential coalition
with the interests and capacity to achieve its goals --- but it still
needs to be organized. That means a green growth program has a plausible
potential "political opportunity structure," unlike degrowth.

#### Growth [solves]{.underline} the environment.

**Elvander 23**\[Jonas; PhD researcher in history at the European
University Institute at Florence; 1-8-2023; \"Degrowth Is Not the Answer

First, growth, whether [economic growth]{.underline} or population
growth, [is **not** the cause of climate change]{.underline} or other
environmental challenges. [We]{.underline} have [had]{.underline} many
other [environmental challenges]{.underline} in the past that [we have
overcome]{.underline}, or largely overcome --- [such as the]{.underline}
hole in the [**ozone layer**, **acid rain**, **lead pollution**,
and]{.underline} a great deal of [air and water pollution]{.underline}
in the West --- and [the solution]{.underline} to all of these [did
**not** come from **halting growth**, but instead]{.underline} from
[**new tech**nologies]{.underline} and economic planning in the form of
regulation and technology policy.

As recently as the 1980s, [the ozone layer]{.underline} challenge
[was]{.underline} perhaps an even greater **[existential]{.underline}**
threat than climate change, for it threatened the very ability of
macroscopic life on land to exist. [We didn't solve that]{.underline}
problem [by halting growth in **fridges**]{.underline}, cans of [**hair
spray**, and **a**]{.underline}ir **[c]{.underline}**onditioning units
(and other machines and processes using the chlorofluorocarbons, or
CFCs, that contributed to ozone depletion), [but by regulating a
transition]{.underline} away from the use of CFCs. Today, there are far
more fridges and cans of hair spray than ever before.

As a science journalist, I would also say that [degrowth]{.underline}
fundamentally [**misdiagnoses** the cause of climate
change]{.underline}, biodiversity loss, and other environmental
problems, and as a result has a poor theory of change (a strategy for
how the problem can be solved).

#### Jevon's paradox is [wrong]{.underline}.

[The stronger Jevons paradox tugs the rug from under the one certainty
we have in energy policy]{.underline}, [which is that
nobody]{.underline} --- from Extinction Rebellion to the "Drill, baby,
drill!" wing of the Republican party --- [could]{.underline} possibly
[be stupid enough to object to cars]{.underline}, [houses and appliances
that get the **same result for less energy and less
money**]{.underline}.

[Has Jevons really ruined all this?]{.underline} **[No]{.underline}**.
[Owen]{.underline}, normally a wise writer, [seems to view the Jevons
paradox as]{.underline} something [**utterly inescapable** like the
second law of thermodynamics]{.underline}. [For example]{.underline},
[if an efficient car saves a driver thousands of dollars in fuel
costs]{.underline}, [Owen explains]{.underline}, "[the environment is
**unlikely to come out ahead**]{.underline}, [as those dollars will
inevitably be spent on goods or activities that involve fuel
consumption]{.underline}".

When we regulate to require energy efficiency, consumption will fall
less than pure arithmetic suggests

[Yet **the environment is all but certain to come out
ahead**]{.underline}, [as there are **few more environmentally damaging
ways** to spend a thousand dollars than to **burn a thousand dollars of
gasoline**]{.underline}. [The money could be spent on a thousand
dollars' worth of coal]{.underline}, [I suppose]{.underline}, [but it
could also be spent on a thousand dollars' worth of **tree saplings or
yoga lessons**]{.underline}.

[Thankfully **we can refute the strong paradox**]{.underline}. In my
lifetime, [energy consumption per person in the UK has **fallen by
one-third**]{.underline}, [while carbon dioxide emissions per person
have **fallen by nearly 60 per cent**]{.underline}. As Hannah Ritchie
explains in her book Not the End of the World, while some of this fall
reflects the offshoring of manufacturing to other countries, most of it
does not. [Energy efficiency **really has reduced energy
consumption**]{.underline}.

[Jevons is worth taking seriously]{.underline}. When we regulate to
require energy efficiency, consumption will fall less than pure
arithmetic suggests. So [energy policy should always be considering
other instruments]{.underline} --- including the old favourite of
economists, a carbon tax, which is a Jevons-proof way to discourage the
burning of fossil fuels. [But **let's not let Jevons drag us into
despair**]{.underline}. [We really are moving **towards a cleaner
world**]{.underline}, [and **energy efficiency** has a big part to play
in that move]{.underline}.

#### AI [solves]{.underline} every reason growth is [unsustainable]{.underline}.

The second possibility for humanity beyond Degrowth is that societal
collapse will be averted, and that the world will rid itself of its
obsolete structures without collapse. [Many put their hopes in
exponential technological change, in particular **Artificial
Intelligence** (AI) leading to a **Singularity**]{.underline} (Kurzweil,
2005). [A Singularity]{.underline} - an inflexion in the world economy's
growth mode - [could herald **super-exponential economic
growth**]{.underline} - a growth [explosion of more than **30% GDP
growth per annum**]{.underline} (Davidson, 2021) - and [enable humanity
to **eradicate poverty and disease**, and deal with other wicked
problems such as **environmental overshoot**]{.underline}. According to
Domingos (2015, p.289) AI [could turn the next millennium into "**the
most amazing in the life of planet Earth**]{.underline}." Russell (2019)
considers it plausible that AI may help raise GDP per capita for the
world's population to the current 88th percentile of that of the USA -
which would [add **US\$674 trillion per year** to the world
economy]{.underline}.

Hanson (2018) argues that AI may not be needed for a growth explosion -
but that [the creation of **digital people** "Ems" through **brain
emulations** may become a possibility in the future]{.underline}. In
such an economy where digital people "largely work and play in virtually
reality" at subsistence levels to produce the computer hardware, and the
supporting infrastructure for the virtual reality, [GDP growth will be
so fast - because of all the billions and billions cheap digital people
and the combinations of new ideas that can generated very rapidly - that
**the world economy doubles every month**]{.underline}.

Crisis theory: [Marx saw capitalism as prone to crises due to
contradictions like overproduction]{.underline}. Capitalists push for
maximum production, but workers cannot afford to consume the goods they
produce, leading to cyclical economic crises.

Class struggle: For Marx, history is driven by the conflict between the
bourgeoisie (capital owners) and the proletariat (workers). This
struggle, [he argued]{.underline}, would eventually lead to a revolution
and the establishment of socialism.

Inevitable collapse: Marx believed [that **capitalism would eventually
self-destruct** due to its internal contradictions, leading to a
proletarian revolution and the rise of socialism]{.underline}.

Strengths of his analysis include his:

Focus on labor exploitation, particularly in critiques of income
inequality. Insights into capitalism's cyclical crises, which have been
validated by economic recessions and depressions. Linking of economic
systems with power, inequality and social relations, which continues to
inspire debates on the relationship between capitalism and societal
inequality.

[But there are also **serious weaknesses** in Marx's
analysis]{.underline}.

[Modern economists largely reject Marx's]{.underline} labor
[theory]{.underline} of value, arguing that value is influenced by
supply, demand, market dynamics and marginal utility rather than labor
alone.

[His prediction of capitalism's inevitable collapse has not
materialized, as capitalism has proven adaptable, incorporating welfare
systems and regulations that mitigate some of its excesses.]{.underline}

His economic determinism has been criticized for downplaying the roles
of culture, politics and individual agency in shaping history.

[His analysis has also been critiqued for overemphasizing class conflict
at the expense of other social identities and forms of oppression, such
as gender, race and ethnicity, which also play crucial roles in
capitalist societies.]{.underline}

[Many modern economists view capitalism as **a self-correcting
system**]{.underline}, with [markets capable of allocating resources
efficiently through mechanisms like pricing and competition. Unlike
Marx's crisis-driven view, some modern economists argue that capitalism
can be stabilized through government intervention, fiscal policies and
regulatory frameworks.]{.underline} [Contemporary analysis]{.underline}
of capitalism also [considers the global and technological dimensions of
the system, focusing on financial markets, globalization and digital
economies---**issues Marx did not foresee**]{.underline}.

**[Lower real yields]{.underline}**: [Real yields have notably declined

[reduction signifies **improved borrowing**]{.underline} [conditions and
**lower financing costs**]{.underline} for businesses and consumers.

Resilient Economic Data

**[Econ]{.underline}**omic **[data]{.underline}** has [shown remarkable
**resilience**, boosting]{.underline} [confidence]{.underline}
[in]{.underline} the [economy\'s underlying strength]{.underline}. The
key indicators I have discussed with clients include:

**[Low unemployment]{.underline}**: U.S. unemployment [stands at 3**.7%,
lower than** the **anticipated** 4.6%]{.underline} in Q4 2023. This
strong labor market supports consumer spending and overall economic
activity.

**[Inflation approaching target]{.underline}**: Inflationary pressures
have been [**gradually aligning with target levels**, indicating a
**balanced approach** to price stability and economic
growth.]{.underline}

**[Strong consumer activity]{.underline}**: The consumer sector (a key
driver of U.S. GDP growth) has [also shown resiliebnce, reflecting
underlying economic strength and **consumer**
**confidence**]{.underline}.

**[Expectations of Rate Cuts]{.underline}**

Anticipation of central bank easing in 2024 [has **further fueled market
optimism**]{.underline}, [driven by expectations of reduced funding
costs and a flatter yield curve.]{.underline} Regardless of the exact

#### No peak oil

**Lynch 24** -- Distinguished Fellow at the Energy Policy Research
Foundation and President of Strategic Energy and Economic Research,

**[Wrong]{.underline}**)," Forbes, 01-17-2024,
https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaellynch/2024/01/17/peak-oil-supply-is-back-and-just-as-wrong/

**[We've been here before]{.underline}**. [In the]{.underline} early
**[1980s]{.underline}**, [companies]{.underline} invested in synthetic
fuels [expecting oil prices to rise]{.underline} to (in 2020 dollars)
\$125/barrel in 1990 and \$200 in 2000, compared to the actual
\$50/barrel in both years. Mobil's gas-to-liquids plant in New Zealand
and Exxon's Old Colony synthetic fuel project in Colorado were both
predicated on just those expectations and, obviously, failed
spectacularly.

**[The 1998]{.underline}** article "The **[End of Cheap
Oil]{.underline}**" [did]{.underline} in fact include the subtitle
stating that it was [refer]{.underline}ring [to a peak in conventional
oil]{.underline}. But citing this ignores the rest of the article's
content, including the claim that: "Adding the output of fields of
various sizes and ages...usually yields a bell-shaped production curve
for the region as a whole." Except that in the real world, [production
follows a **wide variety of paths**]{.underline} (which Hubbert himself
originally said), [which means historical production data alone **does
not allow one to predict** **future production** or **estimate the
resource in a country**.]{.underline}

Hardly the only shortcoming of that article; [you could **write a book**
about the **bad analysis** **underlying peak oil
theorists**]{.underline} generally---and I did, The Peak Oil Scare and
the Coming Oil Flood. For instance, the 1998 article also tried to
refute 'economists' argument that **[over time]{.underline}**,
**[technological advances]{.underline}** [**increased the proportion**
of oil that could be extracted]{.underline}, the 'recovery factor,' said
to be incorrect because "oil companies routinely count on technological
progress when they compute their reserve estimate." [Not only do
companies not predict long-term technological progress in computing
reserve estimates]{.underline}, but the authors themselves criticize
economists for not recognizing that **[reserve estimates have grown over
time]{.underline}**.

The 1997 article in the Oil & Gas Journal which I co-authored with M. A.
Adelman was titled "Fixed View of Resource Limits Creates Undue
Pessimism." In it, we argued that [the amount of recoverable resource
tends to **grow over time**]{.underline}, [not least because **better
technology** and **production methods** **increases the fraction of the
resource** which **can be recovered**.]{.underline}

Not so, was the rejoinder. Using methods such as Hubbert curves,
creaming curves and Hubbert linearization allows for reliable estimates
of the resource base. (These are either invalid or incorrectly applied,
which the next post will discuss.) Economists, they insisted, didn't
realize that the increasing estimates in field reserves was an illusion
and "...most of the apparent improvement in recovery factors is an
artifact of reporting." (The End of Cheap Oil).

Now we have an interesting datapoint that addresses this question. One
of the authors of 1998's "The End of Cheap Oil," has co-authored a new
piece, "How Much Oil Remains for the World to Produce? Comparing
Assessment Methods and Separating Fact from Fiction," in Current
Research in Environmental Sustainability." (2022) For purposes of this
post, it is worth noting that they now estimate that the ultimate
recoverable resource for conventional oil is 2500 billion barrels,
compared to 1800 billion barrels estimated in "The End of Cheap Oil."

In other words, [their methods **did not yield reliable
estimates**]{.underline} of URR in 1998 but rather, as Adelman and Lynch
predicted, **[the estimate has grown]{.underline}**. And while they
might argue that the increased amount is trivial, only 700 billion
barrels, that means that [their estimate of the conventional resource
base has **grown faster than consumption**]{.underline}. (From 2000 to
2022, crude plus condensate production was about 610 billion barrels, of
which about 25 billion was shale oil.)

### No resource scarcity

#### Resource scarcity is wrong.

Randall **Wright 20**, Program director for MIT's Office of Corporate
Relations, 4/1/2020, "Forget Megatrends . . . Find and Follow
Movements," *Research-Technology Management*, 63(3), pp 55-58,
https://doi.org/10.1080/08956308.2020.1733897, pacc

But it gets worse---a lot worse. That's because [megatrends are
**frequently wrong**---**way wrong**]{.underline}. In 1956, legendary
geologist M. King Hubbert predicted that US petroleum production would
**[peak]{.underline}** in 1970 with **[oil]{.underline}** running out in
2015 (Novak 2014). In his best-selling 1968 book, **[The Population
Bomb]{.underline}**, Stanford biologist Dr. Paul Ehrlich predicted, "The
battle to feed all of humanity is over. In the 1970s hundreds of
millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs
embarked upon now. At this late date nothing can prevent a substantial
increase in the world death rate" (Ehrlich 1968, p. 11). Harrison Brown,
a scientist at the National Academy of Sciences, published a chart in
Scientific American that looked at **[metal reserves]{.underline}** and
estimated that humanity [would totally run out]{.underline} of copper
shortly after 2000. Lead, zinc, tin, gold, and silver would be gone
before 1990 (Brown 1970). Needless to say, [**none** of it
happened]{.underline}.

In his book More from Less, Andrew McAfee, principal research scientist
at MIT Sloan School of Management, suggests [**technology** and
**capitalism** are why predictions]{.underline} of the future [are
**frequently so terribly wrong**]{.underline}. Essentially, [humans
invent things to]{.underline} empower themselves and [subvert **material
shortages**]{.underline}, while capitalism---Schumpeter's "creative
destruction" (Alm and Cox 2020) fueled by **[capitalism's price
mechanism]{.underline}** that [allocates resources to **their most
highly valued use**]{.underline}---takes them mainstream. Together
they're why megatrends get derailed. [It's why]{.underline} and how [we
invent ways to **grow more food**, **find more oil**, and **better use
materials**]{.underline}.

Here is one example of current megatrends from "The World in 2030: Nine
Megatrends to Watch" that is currently being displaced by meaningful
inventions:

Transparency: Our world will become even more open---and less private.
It's hard to imagine that the trend to track everything will be going
anywhere but one direction: a radically open world. The amount of
information collected on every person . . . will grow exponentially . .
. The tools to analyze information will be well-developed . . . But, all
these tools will shatter privacy in the process (Winston 2019).

Sounds bleak---except that a movement to ensure data privacy is already
well underway, both in software and hardware. In 2015, MIT professor
Nikolai Zeldovich developed Vuvuzela, a private chat application that
hides metadata, including who you chat with and when you are chatting.
Vuvuzela supports millions of users and is secure even if the network
and most of the servers are compromised by powerful nation-state hackers
with capabilities like the US National Security Agency.

MIT professors Vivienne Sze and Max Shulaker are creating new chip
architectures that will enable artificial intelligence (AI) to run
locally on mobile devices. Instead of transmitting personal data to the
cloud, processing occurs locally so only answers or results are
transmitted, keeping personal data secure on devices: "We're developing
systems that enable efficient processing of visual data, so we can
disconnect the processing from the cloud and bring it to the edge or the
palm of your hand," says Sze. "We want to send only relevant information
to the cloud or maybe no information at all" (Brown 2018).

For people who want to keep their personal data private, a movement is
already afoot to figure out economic ways to do so. This movement is
obsessed with making email exchanges as private as face-to-face
conversations and keeping personal data as secure as cash hidden inside
a money belt.

Here's a second megatrend being upended:

Resource Pressures: We will be forced to more aggressively confront
resource constraints. To keep volumes of major commodities (such as
metals) in line with economic growth, we will need to more quickly
embrace circular models: sourcing much less from virgin materials, using
recycled content and remanufactured products, and generally rethinking
the material economy (Winston 2019).

Except that we won't. McAfee compares the consumption of metals for the
entire US economy (not per capita) and US GDP from 1900 to 2015:

In 2015 (the most recent year for which USGS data are available) the
American [use of **steel** was down]{.underline} more than **[15
percent]{.underline}** from its high point in 2000.
**[Aluminum]{.underline}** consumption was [down]{.underline} more than
[**32 percent** and **copper** 40 percent **from their
peaks**]{.underline} . . . . This dematerialization becomes even more
impressive when consumption is compared to the country's economic growth
. . . . Throughout the twentieth century up to the time of Earth Day
(1970), consumption of metals in America grew just about in lockstep
with the overall economy. In the years since Earth Day, [the economy has
continued to grow]{.underline} pretty steadily, [but]{.underline} the
**[consumption of metals]{.underline}** has [reversed]{.underline}
course [and **is now decreasing**]{.underline}. [We're]{.underline} now
[getting **more 'economy' from less**]{.underline} metal year after year
(McAfee 2019, p. 80).

How is this [possible]{.underline}? It's [because things like
aluminum]{.underline} beverage [cans keep getting thinner and thinner,
and lots of gadgets]{.underline} like telephones, tape recorders,
flashlights, calculators, camcorders, cameras, compasses, and compact
disc players--- stuff with metal parts---keep [vanish]{.underline}ing
[inside of smart phones]{.underline}. Here, meaningful inventions are
springing from movements to maximize resource efficiency and converge a
multitude of devices onto a single digital platform all spurred on by
capitalism's price mechanism.

### No AI

#### No AI or autonomous weapons arms race

Elsa **Kania 18**, Adjunct Fellow with the technology and national
security program at CNAS, 4/19/18, "The Pursuit of AI Is More Than an
Arms Race,"
https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2018/04/pursuit-ai-more-arms-race/147579/

However, [the concept of an "arms race" is **too simplistic** a way to
think of the coming AI revolution. To confront its challenges wisely
requires reframing the current debates.]{.underline}

First and foremost, [AI is not a weapon]{.underline}, nor is "artificial
intelligence" a single technology but rather a catch-all concept
alluding to a range of techniques with varied applications in enabling
new capabilities. Just in the near term, [the utility of AI in defense
may include the introduction of machine learning to cyber security and
operations, new techniques for cognitive electronic warfare, and the
application of computer vision to analyze video and imagery]{.underline}
(as in Project Maven), as well as enhanced logistics, predictive
maintenance, and more.

Despite the active research and development underway, these
[technologies remain **nascent** and **brittle** enough that "fully
autonomous" weapons]{.underline} (or even cars) **[are hardly
imminent]{.underline}**. Moreover, [militaries]{.underline} -- **[even
those that care less about laws and ethics]{.underline}** -- [may be
unwilling to relinquish human control due to]{.underline} the
[risks]{.underline}.

### No Bees

#### No impact to bee extinction \-- most staple foods self-pollinate \-- worst case scenario is less variety

**Palmer 22** \[Brian Palmer; Science writer, photographer and visual
journalist; 5-2-2022; A World Without Bees? Here's What Happens If Bees
Go Extinct; NRDC;
https://www.nrdc.org/stories/world-without-bees-heres-what-happens-if-bees-go-extinct;
Accessed 6-21-2025; RS\]

Bees and humans have been through a lot together. People began keeping
bees as early as 20,000 BCE, according to the late and eminent
melittologist Eva Crane. (Yes, someone who studies bees is a
melittologist.) To put that length of time into perspective, the average
global temperature 22,000 years ago was more than 35 degrees Fahrenheit
cooler than today, and ice sheets covered large parts of North America.
Beekeeping probably predates the dawn of agriculture, which occurred
about 12,000 years ago, and likely made farming possible. How important
are bees to farming today? If you ask 10 reporters that question, you'll
get 11 answers. [Some stories say that bees pollinate **more than
two-thirds** of our most important crops, while others say it's closer
to one-third. A spread of that size indicates a **lack of authoritative
scholarship** on the subject]{.underline}. My review of the literature
suggests the same. The most thorough and informative study came back in
2007, when an international team of agricultural scholars reviewed the
importance of animal pollinators, including bees, to farming. Their
results could encourage both the alarmists and the minimizers in the
world of bee observation. The group found that 87 crops worldwide employ
animal pollinators, compared to only 28 that can survive without such
assistance. Since honeybees are by consensus the most important animal
pollinators, those are scary numbers. Look at the data differently,
though, and it\'s clear why the misattributed Einstein quote is a bit of
an exaggeration. A[pproximately **60 percent** of the total volume of
food grown worldwide does not **require animal pollination**. Many
staple foods, such as wheat, rice, and corn, are among those 28 crops
that require no help from bees.]{.underline} [They either self-pollinate
or get help from the wind.]{.underline} [Those foods make up a
tremendous proportion of human calorie intake worldwide]{.underline}.
[Even among the 87 crops that use animal pollinators]{.underline},
[there are varying degrees of how much the plants need them. **Only 13
absolutely** require animal pollination, while 30 more are "highly
dependent" on it.]{.underline} [Production of]{.underline} the
[remaining crops would likely continue without bees with only slightly
lower yields.]{.underline} The truth is, [if honeybees did disappear for
good, humans would]{.underline} probably [not go extinct]{.underline}
(at least not solely for that reason). But our diets would still suffer
tremendously. The [variety of foods available would
diminish,]{.underline} and the [cost of certain products would
surge]{.underline}. The California Almond Board, for example, has been
campaigning to save bees for years. Without bees and their ilk, the
group says, almonds "simply wouldn't exist." [We'd still have coffee
without bees,]{.underline} [but it would become expensive]{.underline}
and rare. The coffee flower is only open for pollination for three or
four days. If no insect happens by in that short window, the plant won't
be pollinated. There are plenty of other examples: apples, avocados,
onions, and several types of berries rely heavily on bees for
pollination. The disappearance of honeybees, or even a substantial drop
in their population, would make those foods scarce. [**Humanity would
survive**---but our dinners would get a lot less
interesting]{.underline}.

### No Biod

#### Biodiversity loss isn't existential\-\--species recover.

[Are we heading for a **Sixth Mass Extinction**]{.underline}?

[Watching]{.underline} the **[populations]{.underline}** of our most
cherished animals [**dwindle** is **painful**]{.underline}. Year by year
we find fewer nests in the trees, fewer footprints in the soil and
smaller herds in satellite images. As tragic as a population decline is,
it's a realm away from the complete loss of a species. When we are
watching a species in decline -- when we have a downward sloping chart
-- we can cling to the hope that we will reach the trough and
[**numbers** will **climb** again]{.underline}. Indeed, [this has
happened **many times**]{.underline}. The [**African**
elephant]{.underline}, the [**Asian** elephant and the **blue whale**
were all on **course** for]{.underline} a **[wipeout]{.underline}**. But
[we **pulled** on the **handbrake** just in time]{.underline}, and
[**populations** have started to]{.underline} **[recover]{.underline}**.

[Over the **last decade**]{.underline} the number of African
**[elephants]{.underline}** in Namibia has doubled.27, 28 In Burkina
Faso they've increased by 50%. In Zambia, South Africa, Angola,
Ethiopia, Malawi and several other countries, populations [are on the
**up**]{.underline}. After enduring a steep decline there were just
15,000 Asian elephants left in India by 1980. Their [numbers
have]{.underline} now [risen]{.underline} to almost 30,000.

Whether a trend is sloping up or sloping down, there is no reason to
believe that it has to continue that way. [We nearly **always** have the
**opportunity** to **turn** things **around**]{.underline}. But when
that line hits zero -- as it does in an extinction event -- our hopes of
a turnaround vanish. It's done. It's finished. That loss hits
differently. [Yet it's one that the planet has experienced many times
over]{.underline}.

[**Ninety-nine** per cent of the 4 billion **species** that have ever
**lived** on Earth are now **gone**]{.underline}.29 [Extinctions have
been]{.underline} a **[natural]{.underline}** part of the planet's
evolutionary history. 30 [Without them, we wouldn't be here]{.underline}
today. [Species go **extinct**]{.underline}, [and **new species**
arise]{.underline}. [This is **evolution**-in-action]{.underline}.

#### Biodiversity loss doesn't impact ecosystem productivity.

Brun et al. (2022) found that a few tall, high-SLA plant species had
stronger effects on primary productivity than any measure of functional
diversity. [We add data on species rarity to show that ongoing
biodiversity loss is **unlikely** to **hamper** ecosystem
productivity]{.underline}, a core insight we feel the authors missed.

Main text

Brun et al. (2022) present important new results regarding the
controversial relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function.
Studying plant communities from the French and Swiss Alps, they assessed
if the presence or abundance of certain plant species were linked to
higher levels of pivotal ecosystem functions, here primary productivity.
They identified 'key' species, which have a decisive role in overall
productivity, and 'keystone' species, which have disproportionally large
productivity effects given their abundance, and which are a subset of
the key species. Out of 2918 plant species found, they identified 38 key
species, of which 11 qualified as keystone species. They found that the
five key species with largest effects on productivity jointly explained
more deviance in ecosystem productivity than any measure of functional
composition. The results provide evidence supporting the Trait Driver
Theory (Enquist et al. 2015), which is related to the 'mass-ratio
hypothesis' (Grime 1998; Garnier et al. 2004), and against the
'complementary resource use hypothesis' (Naeem et al. 1994). Key and
keystone species were found to be taller and have higher than average
specific leaf area.

Brun et al. (2022) state in their introduction that understanding the
relationships between species richness, functional traits and ecosystem
function "is pivotal for assessing the impacts of biodiversity loss".
Their study builds on solid empirical data, a strong analytical
framework and deals with real-world communities, shaped by abiotic
environmental filtering and non-artificial extinction processes,
something rarely undertaken (e.g. Vile et al. 2006; Mokanyet al. 2008).
Therefore, we miss an explicit evaluation of the assumptions underlying
the 'rivet-popper hypothesis' (Ehrlich & Ehrlich 1981). In this powerful
narrative, the popping rivets leading to the crash of the plane are
juxtaposed to species going extinct, leading to ecosystem collapse. The
metaphor has inspired and gained some support from the so-called random
deletion experiments (e.g. Tilman et al. 1997; Hector et al. 1999), in
which all species are assumed to have equal extinction probability.

We plotted a rank-abundance diagram of the species in the data of Brun
et al. (2022) based on their regional occupancy (using mean local
abundance yielded qualitatively equal results, with a strong positive
correlation between regional occupancy and local abundance; Spearman rho
= 0.93, p \<\< 0.001). [We categorized species as either key, keystone,
redlisted or other and superimposed species]{.underline} category on the
diagram (Fig. 1). Redlist status was derived from the redlists for
vascular plants of Switzerland (Bornand et al. 2016) and the French
region Rhˆone-Alpes (Kristo et al. 2015). We found that key and keystone
species strongly tended to be regionally widespread and locally abundant
species, whereas species threatened with regional extinction were found
in the tail of the rank-abundance distribution. [A one-way anova of
difference in log-transformed frequencies revealed that key and keystone
species did not differ in abundance but were both significantly more
abundant than all other categories and that redlisted species were
significantly less abundant than all other categories]{.underline} (p
\<\< 0.001, TukeyHSD). [It appears evident that the contribution of
**rare species** to ecosystem **productivity** is a weak argument for
conservation actions in their favour]{.underline}. In fact, Fig. 2a of
the original paper shows that many species leads to reduced ecosystem
productivity when present.

A revised version of Ehrlich's aeroplane metaphor could sound: The wings
are effectively attached to the body of the plane by a small number of
large rivets of key importance, while numerous small rivets, most of
which tiny as needles, serve no other function than mere decoration
(Gould & Lewontin 1979). [The biodiversity **crisis** and its derived
biotic homogenization **implies** that already common **key species**
increase in occupancy and **abundance**, while initially **un-common**
species decrease or vanish **completely**]{.underline} (Finderup Nielsen
et al. 2019; Kempel et al. 2020).

[There is solid **evidence** for **loss** of endangered species
**disproportionately** happening in **low-productive natural
ecosystems**]{.underline} (Walker et al. 2004; Wassen et al. 2005),
[which we show have **very low extinction risk**.]{.underline} Moreover,
[the plant **species** critical to human sustenance are all
**superabundant crops**, such as wheat, corn and rice]{.underline}. [We
propose it is time the scientific **community acknowledge** that
arguments for **biodiversity** conservation should not be sought in
**optimization** of **productivity**, decomposition rate or -- in
general -- in efficiency of ecosystem **processes**]{.underline}. [We
are]{.underline} not misanthropic, but rather [confident that
**disciplines** such as agronomy, forestry, technical sciences,
geophysics and medicine will look after the well-being of our own
species.]{.underline}

### No Deforestation

#### Deforestation has no impact and peaked decades ago.

Dr. Hannah **Ritchie 24,** Data Scientist, Senior Research at the
University of Oxford, Deputy Editor and Lead Researcher of Our World in
Data, Ph.D. in Geoscience from the University of Edinburgh, B.A. in
Environmental Geoscience, M.A. in Carbon Management, 1/9/2024,
"Deforestation: Seeing the Wood for the Trees," Not the End of the
World: How We Can Be the First Generation to Build a Sustainable Planet,
ISBN: 9780316536950

The **[Amazon]{.underline}** rainforest [is]{.underline} often [called
the '**lungs of the Earth'**]{.underline}. Emmanuel Macron is not the
only one to claim that it produces 20% of the Earth's oxygen. Leonardo
DiCaprio, Kamala Harris and Cristiano Ronaldo are just a handful of
others that have made similar claims.2, 3 Former NASA astronaut, Scott
Kelly, even tweeted this statistic out, followed by 'we need O2 to
breathe!'4

What [they're]{.underline} **[implying]{.underline}** is
that [the]{.underline} **[disappearance]{.underline}** [of
the]{.underline} **[Amazon]{.underline}** [is
a]{.underline} **[threat]{.underline}** [to the
planet's]{.underline} **[oxygen supply]{.underline}**. As we hear about
the loss of the Amazon rainforest, these claims become scary. An article
in the New York Times stated that 'if enough rain forest is lost and
can't be restored, the area will become savanna, which doesn't store as
much carbon, meaning a reduction in the planet's "lung capacity"'.5
Now, [there are very]{.underline} **[real concerns]{.underline}** [about
a '**tipping point'**]{.underline} with the
Amazon. [But]{.underline} it's [not]{.underline} a concern [about
oxygen]{.underline}. The [Amazon]{.underline} doesn't provide 20% of the
world's oxygen. On balance,
it [contributes]{.underline} almost [none]{.underline} of it.

The Amazon does produce huge amounts of
oxygen. [During]{.underline} [**photosynthesis**, it]{.underline} [sucks
up]{.underline} **[carbon]{.underline}** **[dioxide]{.underline}** [and
emits]{.underline} **[O2]{.underline}**. The estimate of 20% is too
high, though: it is [closer to]{.underline} 6 to [9%]{.underline}.6, 7
However, these numbers are beside the point: the Amazon produces a lot
of oxygen, but it consumes a lot
too. [During]{.underline} the **[night]{.underline}**, [when there's no
sun]{.underline} around for
photosynthesis, **[trees]{.underline}** [convert]{.underline} **[sugars]{.underline}** [into]{.underline} [**energy**,]{.underline} [using]{.underline} **[oxygen]{.underline}** to
power the process. Bacteria on the forest floor also consume oxygen when
they're decomposing organic matter that has landed there from the
canopies above. The **[amount]{.underline}** [of
oxygen]{.underline} [the Amazon]{.underline} [consumes]{.underline} is
almost exactly [the same]{.underline} [as the amount it
produces]{.underline}. These **[cancel]{.underline}** each
other **[out]{.underline}**, so it provides almost none of the oxygen in
the atmosphere.

It's not just the Amazon. [None of]{.underline} [the
world's]{.underline} **[forests]{.underline}** or vegetation [give
much]{.underline} [to]{.underline} our [oxygen]{.underline} [supply]{.underline}.
As the geologist Shanan Peters calculated: '[if
every]{.underline} **[living]{.underline}** **[thing]{.underline}** other
than
humans [burned]{.underline} [up]{.underline}, **[oxygen]{.underline}** [levels]{.underline} [would
fall]{.underline} [from]{.underline} **[20.9%]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[20.4%]{.underline}**'.8 [It
would]{.underline} also [take millions of years to
deplete]{.underline} the globe's [oxygen supply]{.underline} by any
notable amount. The **[oxygen]{.underline}** in our atmosphere [came
from]{.underline} **[phytoplankton]{.underline}** in the
oceans, [millions of years ago]{.underline}. Before then, Earth's
atmosphere had none; microorganisms lived anaerobically -- meaning they
didn't need oxygen -- or were 'extremophiles' living in intense
environments, fuelled by elements such as sulphur. Around 2.5 million
years
ago, [the]{.underline} **[Earth]{.underline}** [had]{.underline} its
'**[Great
Oxidation]{.underline}** [Event']{.underline} [where]{.underline} **[cyanobacteria]{.underline}** --
the first organisms to photosynthesise -- [started
to]{.underline} [convert]{.underline} **[CO2]{.underline}** [into]{.underline} **[O2]{.underline}**. [That's
where]{.underline} most of [our oxygen comes from, and it's very hard to
significantly change]{.underline} this balance.

Since [January]{.underline}, a [staggering **121,000
fires**]{.underline} have [broken out across Brazil]{.underline} --- and
mo[re than half of those fires]{.underline} are taking place **[in the
Amazon]{.underline}**, according to the country's National Institute for
Space Research.

The fires are destroying the homes of indigenous tribes, [threatening
millions of animals,]{.underline} and even [darkening the skies over
major cities.]{.underline}

We spoke with some of our own researchers in the College of Natural
Resources to learn more about the fires and what's at stake. Here's what
we found out.

What caused the Amazon fires?

Similar to the United States and Canada --- where
[wildfires]{.underline} are typically caused by humans --- the fires in
the Amazon are [nearly all man-made.]{.underline}

These [fires]{.underline}, however, are often deliberately [set as part
of **slash-and-burn agriculture**]{.underline} --- a method of growing
food in which [farmers and cattle ranchers]{.underline} **[deliberately
cut down]{.underline}** and burn [forestland to clear it for crops and
livestock]{.underline}, according to Dr. Erin Sills, the Edwin F. Conger
Professor and director of international programs in the Department of
Forestry and Environmental Resources.

"Slash-and-burn agriculture has been [practiced for thousands of
years]{.underline} in forests around the world, [especially in the
tropics]{.underline}," Sills said. "Farmers [cut down trees at the end
of the dry season]{.underline} and then [burn them right before the
rains start.]{.underline} This [leaves a nutrient-rich layer of ash on
the ground that provides fertilizer for crops."]{.underline}

For nearly two decades, Sills has studied the impacts of deforestation
and climate change in the western Brazilian Amazon as a member of
Connections Between Water and Rural Production --- a consortium of
university researchers funded by the National Science Foundation.

Her research interests include markets and payments for non-timber
forest benefits, forest-based livelihoods and economic development,
international forest policy and sustainable forest management,
deforestation and land use in the tropics, economic assessment of
invasive species policies, and program evaluation with matching methods
and panel data.

Sills said slash-and-burn agriculture is a **[common practice in the
tropics]{.underline}** [during the dry season,]{.underline} which in the
western Brazilian Amazon, runs from June to August.

After a significant reduction in forest clearing in the Brazilian Amazon
from 2004 to 2012, both **[deforestation and fires are on the
rise]{.underline}**. The [rate of fires in the Amazon has risen by
**more than 85%**]{.underline} [since last year alone.]{.underline}

This is [**false**. The cause]{.underline} of coral deaths in the past
decade [are **multifaceted** with most]{.underline} being [the result of
coastal pollution]{.underline} from various sources [as well
as]{.underline} a known [sensitivity to **sunscreen**]{.underline} used
by reef snorkelers.

Coral can only exist in warm waters and [data show as]{.underline} the
world's equatorial [oceans]{.underline} have [**warm**ed modestly,
corals reefs **expanded**]{.underline} their range. In instances
[where]{.underline} temperature [spikes]{.underline} have [contributed
to]{.underline} coral [**bleach**ing, most]{.underline} of the
[corals]{.underline} have **[recovered]{.underline}**.

The New York Times, NPR, and the Washington Post were among the dozens
of mainstream media outlets publishing alarming stories about a new
report from the Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network (GCRMN).

"Rising ocean temperatures killed about 14 percent of the world's coral
reefs in just under a decade, according to a new analysis from the
Global Coral Reef Monitoring Network," wrote NPR.

The first corals arose during the Cambrian Period about 535 million
years ago and the number and type corals increased dramatically more
than 400 million years ago, coming into existence when global
temperatures and carbon dioxide concentrations were much higher than at
present. Coral have proved adaptable, expanding their range and evolving
and thriving through periods of higher and lower temperatures than the
Earth is either currently experiencing or reasonably expected to
experience in the foreseeable future.

As discussed in Climate at a Glance: [Coral Reefs, coral thrive in warm
water, not cold water]{.underline}, and recent [warming]{.underline} has
[allowed coral to **expand** their range poleward]{.underline}, while
still thriving near the equator.

Recent **[peer-reviewed research]{.underline}** described in a Phys.org
article, titled "Half a trillion corals: World-first coral count prompts
rethink of extinction risks," [should]{.underline} serve to [calm any
concern]{.underline} for the continued survival and flourishing of
corals. [The study cited places the number of corals in the
Pacific]{.underline} Ocean [alone at more than **half a trillion**.
There are likely **trillions more worldwide**]{.underline}.

The scientists involved in the research say [the sheer number of corals
and coral species means the risk of extinction due to climate change is
**vastly lower** than previously claimed]{.underline}.

"In the Pacific, we estimate there are roughly half a trillion corals,'
said the study lead author, Dr. Andy Dietzel from the ARC Centre of
Excellence for Coral Reef Studies at James Cook University," writes
Phys.org. ["This is]{.underline} about [the same number of **trees in
the Amazon**, or **birds in the world**."]{.underline}

"Dr. Dietzel said the eight most common coral species in the region each
have a population size greater than the 7.8 billion people on Earth,"
says Phys.org, continuing, "The findings suggest that [while a **local**
loss]{.underline} of coral [can be devastating]{.underline} to coral
reefs, [the **global** extinction risk]{.underline} of most coral
species [is **low**er than previously estimated]{.underline}."

This research points out that [12 of the 80 coral species
the]{.underline} International Union for the Conservation of Nature
[(IUCN) lists as having an elevated extinction risk, have]{.underline}
estimated [population sizes of **more than one billion**
colonies]{.underline}.

NPR says the GCRMN's "report ... found that warming caused by climate
change, overfishing, coastal development, and declining water quality
has placed coral reefs around the world under 'relentless stress.'"

[Coral reefs do face **many** stressors, but the **best available
evidence** suggests **warmer waters** is a **factor** they can **adapt
to**]{.underline}.

Previous posts on Climate Realism, for example, here, here, here, and
here, show local conditions, like runoff from beach front development
and agriculture, and pollution tied to sun block used by swimmers, not
warmer temperatures or ocean acidification, pose the biggest threat to
[coral reefs]{.underline}. But even these [**threats** are **highly
localized** and **often temporary**]{.underline}, with many coral reefs
recovering within a few seasons after bleaching events.

Science has multiple studies showing corals can and do adapt to the
gradual long-term pace of global warming.

Most portions of coral reefs around the world that have bleached and
been declared dead or permanently damaged over the past two decades
have, in fact, recovered. Whether the 14 percent of corals identified
GCRMN as being dead will eventually recover is unknown. What is [clear
from **history** and]{.underline} the [**available evidence** is there
are trillions of corals in the world]{.underline}, many unaccounted for,
[and to the extent they are threatened with harm, **various types** of
pollution are the **primary** cause, **not warmer waters**]{.underline}.

#### It's [slow]{.underline}, [outweighed]{.underline} by other factors, AND [harmless]{.underline}.

**Shellenberger '19** \[Michael; 2019; Founder and President of
Environmental Progress and Co-Founder of the Breakthrough Institute;
Forbes, "Why Apocalyptic Claims About Climate Change Are Wrong,"
https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelshellenberger/2019/11/25/why-everything-they-say-about-climate-change-is-wrong/#3c1f50c12d6a\]

Few have underscored the threat more than student climate activist Greta
Thunberg and Green New Deal sponsor Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The
latter said, "The world is going to end in 12 years if we don\'t address
climate change." Says Thunberg in her new book, "Around 2030 we will be
in a position to set off an irreversible chain reaction beyond human
control that will lead to the end of our civilization as we know it."

Sometimes, [scientists]{.underline} themselves [make **apocalyptic
claims**]{.underline}. "It's difficult to see how we could accommodate a
billion people or even half of that," if Earth warms four degrees, said
one earlier this year. "The potential for multi-breadbasket failure is
increasing," said another. [If **sea levels** rise]{.underline} as much
as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change predicts, another
scientist said, "[It will be an unmanageable problem]{.underline}."

Apocalyptic statements like these have real-world impacts. In September,
a group of British psychologists said children are increasingly
suffering from anxiety from the frightening discourse around climate
change. In October, an activist with Extinction Rebellion ("XR") --- an
environmental group founded in 2018 to commit civil disobedience to draw
awareness to the threat its founders and supporters say climate change
poses to human existence --- and a videographer, were kicked and beaten
in a London Tube station by angry commuters. And last week, an XR
co-founder said a genocide like the Holocaust was "happening again, on a
far greater scale, and in plain sight" from climate change.

Climate change is an issue I care passionately about and have dedicated
a significant portion of my life to addressing. I have been politically
active on the issue for over 20 years and have researched and written
about it for 17 years. Over the last four years, my organization,
Environmental Progress, has worked with some of the world's leading
climate scientists to prevent carbon emissions from rising. So far,
we've helped prevent emissions increasing the equivalent of adding 24
million cars to the road.

I also care about getting the facts and science right and have in recent
months corrected inaccurate and apocalyptic news media coverage of fires
in the Amazon and fires in California, both of which have been
improperly presented as resulting primarily from climate change.

[Journalists]{.underline} and activists alike [have an obligation to
describe environmental problems **honestly** and
**accurately**]{.underline}, even if they fear doing so will reduce
their news value or salience with the public. There is good evidence
that the [catastrophist framing of climate change is
**self-defeating**]{.underline} because it alienates and polarizes many
people. [And **exaggerat**ing]{.underline} climate change [risks
**distracting** us]{.underline} from other important issues including
ones we might have more near-term control over.

I feel the need to say this up-front because I want the issues I'm about
to raise to be taken seriously and not dismissed by those who label as
"climate deniers" or "climate delayers" anyone who pushes back against
exaggeration.

With that out of the way, let's look whether the science supports what's
being said.

[First, **no credible scientific body** has **ever** said climate change
threatens the **collapse of civilization** much less the **extinction**
of the human species. "'Our children are going to die in the next 10 to
20 years.' What's the **scientific basis** for these
claims?"]{.underline} BBC's Andrew Neil asked a visibly uncomfortable XR
spokesperson last month.

"These claims have been disputed, admittedly," she said. "There are some
scientists who are agreeing and some who are saying it's not true. But
the overall issue is that these deaths are going to happen."

"But [**most scientists** don't agree with this]{.underline}," said
Neil. "[I looked through **IPCC reports** and see **no reference** to
**billions** of people going to die, or children in 20 years. How would
they die?]{.underline}"

"Mass migration around the world already taking place due to prolonged
drought in countries, particularly in South Asia. There are wildfires in
Indonesia, the Amazon rainforest, Siberia, the Arctic," she said.

But in saying so, [the XR spokesperson had **grossly misrepresented**
the science]{.underline}. "There is robust evidence of disasters
displacing people worldwide," notes IPCC, "but [**limited evidence**
that]{.underline} climate change or [**sea-level rise** is the direct
cause]{.underline}"

What about "mass migration"? "The majority of resultant population
movements tend to occur within the borders of affected countries,\" says
IPCC.

It's not like climate doesn't matter. It's that [climate change is
**outweighed** by **other factors**]{.underline}. Earlier this year,
researchers found that climate "has affected organized armed conflict
within countries. However, [other drivers, such as low socioeconomic
development and low capabilities of the state, are judged to be
**substantially more influential**]{.underline}."

Last January, after climate scientists criticized Rep. Ocasio-Cortez for
saying the world would end in 12 years, her spokesperson said \"We can
quibble about the phraseology, whether it\'s existential or
cataclysmic." He added, "We\'re seeing lots of \[climate
change-related\] problems that are already impacting lives.\"

That last part may be true, but it's also true that economic development
has made us less vulnerable, which is why there was a 99.7% decline in
the death toll from natural disasters since its peak in 1931.

In 1931, 3.7 million people died from natural disasters. In 2018, just
11,000 did. And that decline occurred over a period when the global
population quadrupled.

[What about sea level rise? IPCC estimates sea level could rise **two
feet**]{.underline} (0.6 meters) [by **2100**. Does that sound
**apocalyptic** or even "unmanageable"?]{.underline}

Consider that one-third of the Netherlands is below sea level, and some
areas are seven meters below sea level. You might object that
Netherlands is rich while Bangladesh is poor. But [the Netherlands
**adapted** to living below sea level 400 years ago. **Technology** has
**improved** a bit since then]{.underline}.

What about [claims of crop failure, famine, and mass death? That's
**science fiction**, not science. Humans today produce enough food for
**10 billion** people, or 25% more than we need, and scientific bodies
**predict increases** in that share, not **declines**]{.underline}.

#### Capitalism is the most powerful tool humanity has to effectively address climate change.

**Henderson 14** \[Rebecca M. Henderson; One of 25 University Professors

Research; 9-24-2014; We Don't Have to Ditch Capitalism to Fight Climate
Change; Harvard Business Review;
https://hbr.org/2014/09/we-dont-have-to-ditch-capitalism-to-fight-climate-change;
Accessed 7-2-2025; SM\]

[In fact, we know how to address the problem of climate change, **and it
doesn't require ditching the market** economy. Instead, it relies on
harnessing it. We need to stop acting as though dumping heat-trapping
gases into the atmosphere is costless and]{.underline} set a price on
carbon and other greenhouse [gas emissions. We need to stop subsidizing
fossil fuels]{.underline}; the world is currently spending about
[\$500bn]{.underline} to subsidize oil, gas and coal. ([That's not much
less than]{.underline} some current [estimates of what it would
cost]{.underline} us [to build a carbon free economy]{.underline}.) And
[we need to subsidize research into new energy technologies
so]{.underline} that [entrepreneurs can]{.underline} one day [bring them
to market]{.underline}. We're currently spending less than \$2 billion a
year on clean energy research -- that's less than 5% of what we're
spending on health related research, and less than 2% of what we're
spending on defense orientated work.

[Nothing in human history has approached the power and flexibility of
**competitive markets** to create economic prosperity, trigger
innovation]{.underline}, and support political and individual freedom.
[Real capitalism]{.underline} -- a capitalism in which inputs are
properly priced, where information is widely shared, and where there are
no favors for the few --- [is one of humanity's greatest inventions. But
when it comes to carbon **we're not looking at real capitalism** or
truly efficient markets]{.underline}. If we were, [**we would see an
explosion of innovation** that would expedite the transition away from
fossil fuels]{.underline}. We're already seeing corporations all over
the world invest in carbon-free energy, in efficiency, and in business
models that limit environmental impact. With the right kind of policy
reform this trickle has the potential to become a flood.

Both the marchers and Ms. Klein have a point, of course -- namely that
even though we know what to do, we're not doing it. She thinks it's
because we're the victims of evil capitalists. It is certainly true that
political action on climate change would benefit from reforms aimed at
limiting the influence of incumbent industries. [We need to make it
clear that our **commitment is to a capitalism** in which it's not ok
for corporations -- or wealthy individuals -- to use their money to bend
the rules of the game in their own favor.]{.underline} Both the marchers

commitment is to a capitalism in which it's not ok for corporations --
or wealthy individuals -- to use their money to bend the rules of the
game in their own favor. But there is more to it than that. Climate
change is particularly hard to tackle because we're not very good at
trading off current pleasure to reduce future pain. We're a species that
smokes, fails to go to the gym, and takes on credit card debt. In the
same way, we'd prefer to believe that climate change isn't happening and
that if it is we can delay dealing with it.

Our failure to address climate change is thus ultimately a failure of
democracy. [We need to build a social movement that]{.underline} can
insist that our leaders put in place the policies [that will **enable
us** to deal with the threat of climate change]{.underline}. And while
we may struggle with longer-term priorities, we're also a species that
will do almost anything to ensure the welfare of our children. We need
to rediscover the old idea that responsive, democratically controlled
government has a central role to play in ensuring that the rules of the
game are fair, and in dealing with problems like climate change: tough,
long-term collective action problems that can only be addressed by the
state.

[But that doesn't mean that we should abandon capitalism]{.underline}.
With the right policies, [capitalism properly understood is **perfectly
well equipped** to prepare us to face the risk of large scale climate
change. In fact, **it's the only thing that can.**]{.underline}

### No Food Wars

#### No food wars.

Maureen J. **Purcell 24**. Ph.D., M.A., Postdoctoral Researcher, UCI
Blum Center for Poverty Alleviation. Former Lecturer, Environmental Law,
California State University, Long Beach. \"Book Review: Food or War.\"
Environment & Security, Volume 2, Issue 2.

A criticism of Food or war is that the titular argument that food has a
role in the genesis of conflict becomes muddled with the positive
feedback loop argument couched within the food--war nexus Cribb
describes. The
former [seems]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [neglect]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[role
of
conflict]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} [causing]{.underline} **[food]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[hunger]{.underline}** [crises]{.underline},
emphasizing only
a **[one-way]{.underline}** **[relationship]{.underline}** [from]{.underline} [food]{.underline} [crisis
to war]{.underline}. This is not to say that Cribb does not present both
pathways of this nexus---he does and in compelling fashion---but rather
that the [evidence]{.underline} [supports
a]{.underline} slightly **[different]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[more
cyclical]{.underline}** [hypothesis]{.underline} [than the central
thesis]{.underline}.

Similarly, [in emphasizing the]{.underline} inarguably important **[role
of food]{.underline}** [in relationship
to]{.underline} **[conflict]{.underline}**, [other
variables]{.underline} **[critical]{.underline}** [for understanding the
conflict cycle are ignored]{.underline}. [Full
bellies]{.underline} **[do not premise utopia]{.underline}** [as Cribb
seems to]{.underline} **[extrapolate]{.underline}** from his material.
A [well-fed populace
is]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** [one]{.underline} [without]{.underline} **[ideological]{.underline}**, **[moral]{.underline}**, [or]{.underline} **[political]{.underline}** [differences---all]{.underline} [of
which have been]{.underline} [implicated
in]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [conflict]{.underline} [cycle]{.underline}.
At times Cribb [likens food stress
to]{.underline} **["tinder"]{.underline}** (e.g., pp. 140--141,
149), [which would suggest]{.underline}, perhaps more appropriately,
that [the state of the]{.underline} [food system
is]{.underline} [a]{.underline} **[necessary but]{.underline}** **[not
sufficient]{.underline}** **[element of]{.underline}** **[initiating
conflict]{.underline}**. While the argument posited is never that food
is the only cause, [the]{.underline} **[other
contributors]{.underline}** [are]{.underline} **[rarely]{.underline}** [if]{.underline} [at
all mentioned]{.underline}, leaving the non-expert reader without a
sense of what else contributes to this complex issue.

Finally, [while the main argument is persuasive]{.underline} (if at
times muddled) [some]{.underline} [statements would benefit
from]{.underline} **[supporting
evidence]{.underline}** [while]{.underline} [others would
specifically]{.underline} [be]{.underline} [better supported
by]{.underline} **[scientific evidence]{.underline}** [rather than
popular science]{.underline} **[journalism]{.underline}** or news media.
This is particularly true of each instance in which the female gender is
ascribed particular personality traits in universal fashion in apparent
disregard for feminist critiques of stereotyping. Trying to anticipate
this very critique, Cribb states, "This isn't gender stereotyping. It's
an observation about how different kinds of humans think" (2018, p.
201), which does not offer the credibility to his argument that he
thinks it does. From a science communication perspective, the mixing of
scientifically supported and unsupported claims at times makes it
difficult to determine what is a tested and true understanding and what
is Cribb's personal perspective.

### No Inequality

#### Inequality is [statistically insignificant]{.underline}.

Fall of Hipster Antitrust," Arizona State Law Review, 2019, vol. 51  

2\. The [**Empirical Evidence**: Is Inequality **Really
Growing**?]{.underline} 

All of the [papers]{.underline} discussed above [assume that
**inequality** has **increased** in recent years]{.underline}. This
[view is fairly common among economists and would seem to be borne out
as seen in Figure 2 below, which presents the **Gini coefficient** for
U.S. incomes]{.underline} for the last fifty years.166 

![A graph with a red line Description automatically

height="4.760416666666667in"} 

Figure 3, which plots the ratio of the share of US income among the
fifth quintile of income-earning households to the share among the first
quintile of households167 tells a similar story. 

![A graph showing the growth of income Description automatically
generated](media/image9.png){width="6.5in"
height="4.708333333333333in"} 

Robert Kaestner and Darren Lubotsky underscore the point that
[inequality measures can be **significantly affected** by a failure to
account for **government transfers** and **employee benefits** that
presumably **substitute** for **cash income**]{.underline}.168 [Given
that healthcare costs have grown faster than inflation in recent years,
a **failure** to account for **health insurance benefits** could
significantly affect economic inequality measures. Reviewing estimates
from the literature]{.underline}, Kaestner and Lubotsky find that
[including health insurance **substantially reduces** the **gap**
between incomes at the high end of the distribution and those at the low
end]{.underline}.169 Interestingly, however, the authors find that
[there is still an **upward trend** in inequality over time when the
cash equivalent of health insurance and government transfers are
included]{.underline}.170 [The trend, **however**, is **substantially
muted**]{.underline}.171 Specifically, [including government transfers
and the **imputed value** of employer subsidized health
insurance]{.underline}, Kaestner and Lubotsky [indicate that the ratio
of income between households at the ninetieth percentile and the tenth
percentile was about **five** in 1995, growing to **5.2** in 2004 and to
**5.6** in 2012]{.underline}.172 

Although yearly estimates of this more complete measure of income
inequality are not available, and the time series span is somewhat
limited, another approach might be to examine consumption inequality
since consumption will be a function of effective income, and
consumption data are more readily available. Also, [consumption might be
a better measure of welfare]{.underline} as argued by Bruce Meyer and
James Sullivan.173 [When determining the desirability of **antitrust
enforcement** to address economic inequality, presumably one not only
wants to examine the **indirect effects** on people's **incomes** and
**wealth**]{.underline}, but also the direct effect on consumer welfare,
for which consumption might be a useful proxy. 

Considering the arguments raised above regarding the desirability of
using antitrust to fight inequality, [one might reason that **higher
prices** coming from increased concentration make both the well-off
investors and executives and the lowly consumer **worse off**, **but**
the investors and executives are **compensated** through high incomes
due to their **monopoly profits**]{.underline}. Under these arguments,
[we should see an **upward trend** in the consumption ratio between the
haves and the have-nots. Figure 4]{.underline}, which uses data on
average consumption by households in the various income quintiles from
the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey,174 [shows
that while the ratio has grown over time, the growth is **much smaller**
than that found for **income** itself]{.underline}. Further, [unlike
income, the growth is **not nearly as consistent** with periods of
**increasing inequality** and **decreasing inequality**
alike.]{.underline} 

![A graph showing the growth of consumption Description automatically
generated](media/image10.png){width="6.5in"
height="4.739583333333333in"} 

Based on potentially better (i.e., more complete) measures of income and
better metrics of welfare (i.e., consumption), perhaps the [**concerns**
raised]{.underline} in the papers discussed above [are]{.underline} a
little **[overblown]{.underline}**. If so, perhaps the calls for a
ramp-up of antitrust enforcement are not justified (at least on
inequality grounds). That said, even by these measures, it appears
inequality is growing, albeit slightly; therefore, it is worth
discussing whether there is any association between antitrust
enforcement and inequality. 

 

### No Phosphorus

#### Phosphorus impacts are [localized]{.underline} -- no extinction

**Kareiva 18** \[Peter Kareiva and Valerie Carranza, \* director of the

39-50, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.futures.2018.01.001, EA\]

What about the remaining eight planetary boundaries? Stratospheric ozone
depletion is one---but thanks to the Montreal Protocol ozone depletion
is being reversed (Hand, 2016). [Disruptions]{.underline} of the
nitrogen cycle and [of the phosphorous cycle have]{.underline} also
[been proposed as representing potential planetary
boundaries]{.underline} (one boundary for nitrogen and one boundary for
phosphorous). There are compelling data linking excesses in these
nutrients to environmental damage. For example, over-application of
fertilizer in Midwestern USA has led to dead zones in the Gulf of
Mexico. Similarly, excessive nitrogen has polluted groundwater in
California to such an extent that it is unsuitable for drinking and some
rural communities are forced to drink bottled water. However, these
[impacts are **local**. At the same time that there is too
much]{.underline} N loading [in the US, there is a need for
more]{.underline} N [in Africa as a way of increasing agricultural
yields]{.underline} (Mueller et al., 2012). [While]{.underline} the
[disruption of]{.underline} nitrogen and [phosphorous
cycles]{.underline} clearly [perturb local ecosystems,
**end-of-the-world scenarios seem**]{.underline} a bit
**[far-fetched.]{.underline}**

### No Soil Erosion

#### Soil erosion inevitable. Natural forces are the [main]{.underline} cause

**Mulvihill 21** Keith Mulvihill reports on numerous environmental
topics. As a journalist and multimedia producer, he has worked for a
variety of print and digital publications, including the *New York
Times, Reuters Health,* and *Time Out New York (Soil Erosion 101 June 1,
2021) https://www.nrdc.org/stories/soil-erosion-101*

[Soil erosion occurs primarily when dirt is left exposed to strong
winds, hard rains, and flowing water.]{.underline} In some cases, [human
activities, especially farming and land clearing, leave soil vulnerable
to erosion. For example, when farmers till (plow) the soil before or
after growing a season of crops, they may leave it exposed to the
elements for weeks or months]{.underline}. The overgrazing of farm
animals like cattle and sheep can also leave large areas of land devoid
of ground-covering plants that would otherwise hold the soil in place.
Another practice that has devastating consequences for soil health is
deforestation,
particularly [clearcutting](https://www.nrdc.org/stories/deforestation-forest-degradation-causes-effects-solutions),
a widespread practice of the industrial logging industry. [When trees
are cleared away, the land is left exposed to wind and rain without the
security of roots to prevent the soil from being swept
away.]{.underline}

### No US -- China war

#### **No US-China war.** 

**Lei '20** \[Cui; PhD and MA in International Politics, Associate
Research Fellow @ China Institute of International Studies; "Despite
heated talk, risk of a US-China hot war is small"; 7/24/2020;
https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3094121/why-risk-us-china-hot-war-small-despite-heated-talk\]

[Many]{.underline} observers [are pessimistic about deteriorating
US-China relations and believe the two countries are **heading
towards**]{.underline} a cold **[war]{.underline}**. Even worse, [some
argue that the situation might be **more dangerous** than the US-Soviet
Union Cold War, and that a **hot war might break out** between the two.
This argument is **unconvincing**]{.underline}. **[First]{.underline}**
of all, [**deterrents** to a flare-up are]{.underline} much
**[strong]{.underline}**er [**in US-China relations** than in US-Soviet
relations]{.underline}. Although economic and people-to-people ties
between China and the US are declining, they are still close compared to
US-Soviet ties. [It is **hard to decouple** two **closely intertwined
economies** and **societies**.]{.underline} Take two examples. [China is
expected to become the world\'s **largest consumer market**, a
temptation **hard to resist** for exporters, **including** those from
the US. And in **education**, more than **300,000 Chinese students**
study in the US, bringing in **huge revenues** for the US education
industry]{.underline}. Many universities go to great lengths to woo
international students. Recently Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology even sued the government over its new visa restrictions,
now aborted, on international students. [Second, **even if** there is
decoupling, the pain would **not be too great** and can be **kept out**
of the **national security sphere**]{.underline} if properly handled. In
fact, for national security reasons, a modest degree of
**[isolation]{.underline}** [will make both]{.underline} sides more
**[secure]{.underline}** and comfortable. For instance, if
[China's]{.underline} information **[technology]{.underline}** equipment
[cannot capture]{.underline} Western markets, the **[US]{.underline}**
will be more relaxed. If China cannot get advanced technologies from the
US and its technological progress slows down, the [US will
be]{.underline} **[less anxious]{.underline}**. In the same vein, China
feels assured knowing that if the Trump administration does impose a
travel ban on Communist Party members, it would be abandoning one of the
tools available to the US to promote "peaceful evolution" in China.
Economic decoupling is undeniably more painful for China than for the
US. But unlike Japan during WWII, which was hit hard by the US oil
embargo because of its lack of natural resources, China has no such
problems. Given its large domestic market, losing the US as a major
customer is not a disaster for China, and can be compensated through
more dynamic economic activities at home. China can also make up for
being freezed out of technological exchanges by turning to indigenous
innovation. As for the US, it can import goods from other developing
countries, albeit less cheaply. The relative loss is acceptable when
weighed against the heightened perception of economic independence and
security. [Third, the **ideological confrontation** between China and
the US is **less intense**]{.underline} than that during the Cold War.
Unlike the obsession with ideology in those days, [the line between
capitalism and socialism is **blurred** today. The **market economy**
has become **universally recognised** as the best way to promote
economic growth]{.underline} and, politically, many countries have
embraced democracy. Even North Korea calls itself the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea. Although ideological hawks in the US still
long for the day when the beacon of freedom will light up the world,
[after **many years** of fighting **bloody wars overseas**, most
American people are **not interested** in promoting democracy
abroad]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [China just wants to **preserve its
political system** and has **no interest in exporting it** to other
countries, as the Soviet Union did. Thus, ideological **antagonism** in
China-US relations can easily be **eased** by calculations of realistic
**interests**, which create conditions for **compromise and
cooperation**. **Fourth**, both China and the US have **many options
other than war** to achieve their policy goals]{.underline}. While they
have no allies to serve as a buffer, given the nature of the potential
conflict in the South China Sea or Taiwan Strait, [both countries are
**adept at operating in grey zones** and fighting psychological, public
opinion or diplomatic warfare **below the threshold of
war**]{.underline}. The forced closure of the Chinese consulate in
Houston by the US government is just the latest act of brinkmanship. In
addition, [given China's huge economic and financial interests in the
US, the latter can **wield the stick of sanctions** when use of force is
**highly risky** or not worth it.]{.underline} [When both sides have
**many tools and options,** why would they **rush to war** to achieve
their goals? **Last**]{.underline} but not least, [the **imbalance of
power** will act as a deterrent]{.underline}. Some say the US and Soviet
Union did not fight a hot war because they were evenly matched. It was
not the case, actually. At the beginning of the Cold War, the Soviet
Union was at a relative military disadvantage. Moreover, [a country
needs the **will to fight** before **going to war,** even if it is
stronger militarily than its adversary. Having fought **years of
meaningless wars**, the US is **weary of war**]{.underline}. [China,
too, **abhors war**. Having a **clear understanding** of US strength,
**especially** when its own economy is **slowing down** and it is facing
**various domestic challenges**]{.underline}, [China would **not wish**
to **recklessly start a war with the US**. In summary, the possibility
of a **hot war** between China and the US is **very
small**]{.underline}. The greatest danger for China is not a cold or hot
confrontation with the US, but policymakers' interpretation of the
momentary hostility towards Beijing of a portion of the American
population and the larger world. An erroneous interpretation could end
China's march to further opening up, and see it turn instead towards
self-isolation.

\"Capitalism Is What Will Defeat Covid.\" WSJ. 3-19-2021.
https://www.wsj.com/articles/capitalism-is-what-will-defeat-covid-11616192690

[Behold the paradox of this pandemic moment: Large corporations are
political villains, derided on the left and right. Yet the main, and
perhaps only, reason the Covid-19 scourge is easing is vaccines
developed by Big Pharma.]{.underline}

[Few are more acutely aware of this paradox than Alex Gorsky, CEO
of [Johnson & Johnson](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/JNJ), the
healthcare device, pharmaceutical and consumer-goods company best known
for products like Band-Aids and Tylenol. Politicians have vilified his
industry over prescription-drug prices, and trial lawyers for using talc
in its baby powder, which it discontinued in North America in 2020. But
now J&J is a household name in the best way for developing its
single-shot Covid vaccine, which the Food and Drug Administration
approved for emergency use last month. The vaccine is increasing the
U.S. supply of shots at a critical time and will enable a billion people
world-wide to be vaccinated this year.]{.underline}

[J&J's road to the vaccine---from failure to life-saving success, from
investment write-off to breakthrough---is a little-known story about
science, business risk and innovation. There are also lessons for those
who think capitalism is merely about rapacious profit.]{.underline}

["We would never be in the position where we are today if we had not
invested billions of dollars over decades so that we could
respond,"]{.underline} Mr. Gorsky, 60, says in an interview the Monday
morning after the FDA authorized its Covid vaccine. The U.S. Army
veteran had been up since 3:30 a.m., getting in one of his early-morning
workouts before meetings. J&J's Covid-19 vaccine development over the
last year has been a sprint, but the process that led to it has been a
decades-long marathon.

Vaccines such as those for polio, MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) and
seasonal flu have been made from weakened or inactivated viruses. But
patients often produce a weak immune response to the inactivated
viruses, and shots that use weakened viruses can make immunocompromised
people sick. The manufacturing process is also laborious.

[Scientists over the past couple of decades have been studying a
potentially more efficient and effective method known as a "vector
vaccine": using genetically engineered viruses to prime the immune
system by delivering parts of a pathogen's genetic code into human
cells.]{.underline} Our cell machinery then manufacturers the
dopplegangers. The harmless look-alikes trigger an immune reaction,
marshaling antibodies and white blood cells. When the real pathogen
invades, the immune system is prepared.

"Your body has multiple layers of response in these situations. There's
the immediate response, and there's the longer term response," Mr.
Gorsky says. "Your body recognizes the virus and begins producing
antibodies, as well as T-cell and B-cell response."

B-cells produce antibodies that act like sentinels and prevent
infection. T-cells provide backup if a virus penetrates the antibodies'
frontline defense and help enlist white blood cells into action.
Antibodies can fade after a few months, but T-cells stick around longer
and have something of a photographic memory. Some people who were
infected with SARS in 2002-04 were found to have T-cells that remembered
the virus a decade later.

J&J's vaccine was found to be 72% effective at preventing moderate to
severe Covid symptoms (meaning two or more symptoms that don't require
hospitalization) in U.S. trials. That's less than the 95% of the Moderna
and [Pfizer](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PFE) -BioNTech
vaccines, which received emergency-use authorization earlier, and which
are followed by a booster a few weeks after the initial shot. But the
trials aren't directly comparable. For one thing, J&J's trial occurred
later, in the fall and early winter, when more virus variants were
circulating. Some variants with changes to their spike protein, which
helps the virus infiltrate human cells, appear to partly elude the
antibody response.

T-cells aren't as easily tricked. One reason scientists are excited
about J&J's vaccine is that its one shot induces a robust T-cell
response. This means immunity is likely to last longer---how long
remains to be seen---and less likely to be defeated by new variants.

[Mr. Gorsky attributes the strong multilayered immune response from
J&J's vaccine to its innovative adenovirus-vector platform, AdVac, which
it has developed over a decade.]{.underline}

Adenoviruses like those that can cause the common cold---so named
because they were first isolated in human adenoids---are easy to
manipulate because they have a large genome. They also don't integrate
their genes into our own. This makes them an ideal tool for
vector-vaccines. The problem is that many people have pre-existing
antibodies to adenoviruses from prior infections, so their immune
systems may try to shoot down the vaccine as if it were a cold.

In 2007 a promising Merck HIV vaccine, which used the adenovirus-5, or
Ad5, failed to prevent infection in the later stages of a clinical
trial. Worse, data indicated that people who tested positive for Ad5
antibodies were more susceptible to HIV infection than people who
received a placebo, a phenomenon known as vaccine-induced enhancement. A
2008 article in the Journal of Experimental Medicine was titled "The
failed HIV Merck vaccine study: a step back or a launching point for
future vaccine development?"

It was the latter. Merck's HIV-vaccine failure prodded more study of
other adenoviruses like Ad26---the vector for J&J's Covid-19 vaccine.
The Dutch biotech company Crucell had been experimenting with Ad26 in a
vaccine to prevent malaria and other infectious diseases. Unlike with
Ad5, antibodies to Ad26 didn't appear to sabotage the vaccine. In 2009,
J&J entered into a partnership with Crucell to develop a vaccine it
hoped could someday prevent infection from all influenza strains. Two
years later, J&J bought Crucell for \$2.4 billion.

["At that time we had little to no experience in vaccines," Mr. Gorsky
says. But capitalism entails risk: Many Crucell vaccine studies failed,
and "we ended up writing down a very significant portion of our initial
investment." Still, Crucell brought along "two really important
technologies that gave seed to what we're doing today."]{.underline}

[One was the AdVac platform. The other was the PER.C6 manufacturing
technology, capable of mass-producing vaccines quickly and cheaply.
Despite earlier failures, J&J continued to work on vaccines for Ebola,
HIV, Zika and respiratory syncytial virus, all of which are prevalent in
developing countries.]{.underline}

[The company has enrolled more than 150,000 patients in vaccine trials
for these diseases, and last summer the European Medicines Agency
approved its Ebola vaccine. Mr. Gorsky says the trials for other
diseases have made the company confident that its vaccine platform is
safe, even among people who have pre-existing immunity to its Ad26
vector.]{.underline}

[Conducting trials in the developing world also gave the company's
scientists confidence and knowledge to run global trials for its Covid
vaccine. Most participants in J&J's Covid vaccine trial lived outside
the U.S.---12.7% in South Africa, 17.3% in Brazil and 23.3% in five
other Latin American countries. Trials in South Africa and Brazil showed
that J&J's vaccine could prevent severe illness and deaths even against
new variants.]{.underline}

"When we were debating clinical trial sites, and we asked could they
logistically do this, some of our scientists had personally visited them
and said, 'They can absolutely do this, and I can vouch and validate
that they can,' " Mr. Gorsky says. "That's ultimately what put us in a
position to be able to do such a high-quality trial at that particular
moment, even in the face of those kinds of challenges."

J&J was a couple of months behind some other vaccine manufacturers, in
part because its scientists had to make trade-offs to create a
single-shot vaccine that could be mass-produced and rapidly distributed,
including in developing countries. A single dose needed to produce a
robust immune reaction, but not a reaction so strong that it caused
severe side effects.

"We developed more than a dozen different permutations," Mr. Gorsky
says, "and then we put them through some initial testing and selected
our one candidate that we felt we could get the optimal balance." J&J's
vaccine works by using its AdVac platform to transport the DNA that
codes for the spike protein on the surface of the coronavirus into human
cells.

J&J then worked closely with the FDA and the Biomedical Advanced
Research and Development Authority, another federal agency, on clinical
trials and distribution. Mr. Gorsky says that in his 30 years working in
the pharmaceutical industry, he has never seen as much collaboration
between drug makers and government, with which "we were sharing
information in real time." Drug makers have also teamed up: "We all knew
that, while we competed in the marketplace, the real competition here is
the coronavirus."

Merck recently agreed to produce J&J vaccines in its factories. In
January Merck stopped development of its two Covid-19 vaccine candidates
after early clinical trials showed weak immune responses. Merck's
vaccines used different virus vectors than J&J's, but one had shown
success against Ebola.

J&J's vaccine is the third to obtain FDA approval, but preliminary
results from trials
on [AstraZeneca](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AZN) and [Novavax](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NVAX) suggest
they are also highly effective. All these Covid-19 vaccines use
innovative technologies that have been developed and tested over decades
on other diseases. AstraZeneca's vaccine is similar to J&J's, but uses a
chimpanzee adenovirus as a vector. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna
vaccines inject the virus's genetic code via mRNA, which instructs human
cells to produce pseudo-spike proteins, which in turn prompts an immune
response. Novavax's vaccine uses re-engineered spike-protein clones.

About 85% of vaccine candidates fail in trials, and those that succeed
have historically taken 10 to 15 years to develop. It seems like an
incredible stroke of luck and science that we have so many Covid-19
vaccines so soon. But it's more than that. Credit years of research and
investment by drug makers, as well as government collaboration during
the pandemic, which Mr. Gorsky hopes will outlast the pandemic.

["I think this is a golden moment, not only for Johnson & Johnson, but
the biopharmaceutical industry," he says. "We fundamentally believe that
having a market-based, innovation-based, biopharmaceutical as well as a
medical-technology environment, is critical long term to produce the
best overall outcomes for healthcare."]{.underline}

### ! -- Climate Change

#### **Capitalism good for environment**

**Zitelmann '21** \[Dr. Rainer Zitelmann studied history and political
science and received his doctorate in history "with distinction
"Capitalism Is Good for the Environment." Institute of Economic Affairs,
23 Aug. 2021, iea.org.uk/capitalism-is-good-for-the-environment\]

[Most people believe that capitalism is to blame for climate change and
environmental degradation. But numerous scientific studies have arrived
at a surprising conclusion.]{.underline} Every year, the Heritage
Foundation ranks countries around the world based on economic freedom in
a kind of [capitalism index](https://www.heritage.org/index/). [Analysis
has shown that the world's most economically "free" countries also
registered the highest scores on Yale University's [EPI environmental
index](https://epi.yale.edu/),  averaging 76.1 (on a scale from 0 to
100), while the "mostly free" countries averaged 70.2. These two groups
have a significant lead over the "moderately free" countries, which
received much lower ratings (59.6 points) for their environmental
performance.]{.underline} The countries rated by the Heritage Foundation
as either "mostly unfree" or "repressed" received by far the worst
Environmental Performance Index scores (46.7 and 50.3, respectively).
Researchers at Yale University found that there is not only a
correlation between the Heritage Foundation's index and their own EPI,
but also between the EPI and the "[Ease of Doing Business
Index](https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/data)" which is published each
year as part of the World Bank's Doing Business Report and is generally
regarded as the world's most comprehensive and reliable gauge of the
ease of doing business, with higher ratings indicating better, usually
simpler, regulations for businesses and stronger protections of property
rights. [According to the researchers at Yale University, the
correlation between the "Ease of Doing Business Index," which they refer
to as a measure of "economic liberalism" (i.e., an indicator of how
capitalist an economy is), and the EPI is 0.72.In 2016, researchers
published [a study](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/8/7/601) in the
journal Sustainability that included an evaluation of the correlation
between the EPI and the "Open Market Index" (OMI) compiled by the
International Chamber of Commerce (ICC). The OMI measures a country's
openness to free trade and is thus an important indicator of economic
freedom.]{.underline} The researchers found a high degree of overlap
between the OMI index and the EPI: 19 of the OMI's 27 highest-scoring
countries also appear in the top 27 of the EPI. The survey covered a
total of 75 countries, including all G20 and EU members. Together, these
countries account for more than 90 percent of international trade and
investment. The researchers conclude: "It is evident that there is a
strong connection between OMI and EPI scores, supporting our hypothesis
that countries with an open economy score higher in environmental
performance. Overall, our evidence shows that the level of the openness
of an economy is associated with a country's environmental protection."
Another study, "[Is Free Trade Good for the
Environment?](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.91.4.877)"
by Antweiler, Copeland and Taylor, uses sophisticated mathematical
modeling to explore the correlation between free trade -- a key feature
of capitalism -- and environmental pollution. The study finds: "Our
estimates of the scale and technique elasticities indicate that if
openness to international markets raises both output and income by 1%,
pollution concentrations fall by approximately 1%. Putting this
calculation together with our earlier evidence on composition effects
yields a somewhat surprising conclusion: freer trade is good for the
environment." Of course, it can be argued that capitalism leads to
stronger economic growth, which in turn leads to an increase in resource
consumption[. However, the analyses show that, at an early stage of a
country's economic growth, a high level of environmental degradation is
observed, while, after a critical point of economic growth, a gradual
decline in environmental degradation is reported. In addition, there are
two real-world observations that also disprove the argument that
stronger economic growth automatically leads to greater environmental
pollution: In non-capitalist countries, environmental degradation has
been a far more serious problem than in capitalist countries. The
correlation between economic growth and increasing resource consumption
is becoming ever weaker in the age of dematerialization. On the basis of
numerous data series, Andrew McAfee [has
shown](https://www.amazon.de/Post-Peak-Pa-Andrew-Mcafee/dp/1471180360/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=mcafee+more+of&qid=1629214924&sr=8-1) how
economic growth has decoupled from the consumption of raw materials.
Data for the USA show that of 72 raw materials, only six have not yet
reached their consumption maximum. Although the US economy has grown
strongly in recent years, consumption of many commodities is actually in
decline. And the results of all these studies point in the same
direction: capitalism is not the problem, it is the solution -- both
economically and environmentally.]{.underline}

The good news is that [business has a compelling econ]{.underline}omic
case [for action. It will be much easier to make money in a world in
which the climate is relatively stable,]{.underline} in which the major
coastal cities are not under water and in which agricultural collapse is
not routinely triggering the migration of hostile, hungry populations
(IPCC, 2014). Moreover, [the private sector will benefit from a world
that has significantly **less poverty and inequality**]{.underline}
(Buckman et al., 2021).

But this is a collective case, and it might therefore seem unlikely that
any but the most visionary and confident business leaders would attempt
to act on it. What, then, can be done?

The [current move towards shared value,]{.underline} or towards the
simultaneous [creation of private profit and public benefit]{.underline}
is a critical first step. The evidence that there are broad
opportunities to create shared value [is extensive.]{.underline}
[Walmart saved]{.underline} about [\$1bn a year by]{.underline}
redesigning its trucking fleet to **[reduce energy use.]{.underline}**
[Tesla has become one of the most valuable automakers in the
world]{.underline}. [Firms that adopt high road employment
strategies]{.underline} -- that is, that create jobs that pay well,
treat employees with dignity and respect and grant them significant
discretion to shape their own work and build a collective sense of
purpose -- [have repeatedly found that the strategy creates significant
economic value]{.underline} (Henderson, 2020a, 2021).

Although such [actions]{.underline} are sometimes [derided as
greenwashing]{.underline} or dismissed as too small or local to have any
real impact, they often [drive broader change.]{.underline} They act as
demonstration projects: Proving that a [private business can solve a
public problem, **driving down** the **costs** of new technologies and
demonstrating that new business models are indeed feasible.]{.underline}
Tesla's embrace of electrically powered vehicles, for example, probably
accelerated the transformation of the automotive industry by at least
five years. Walmart's embrace of highly concentrated liquid detergents
pushed the entire industry into moving in the same direction.

As a second step, firms can drive change through coordinated action.
While there are many [opportunities for firms to]{.underline} make money
and [address **social or environmental problems**]{.underline} at the
same time, there are also many that can only be exploited if firms act
together. The [move to preserve the world's fisheries is a prime
example]{.underline} (Henderson, 2016). While every firm will benefit if
everyone reduces their catch, no single firm can profit from doing so
alone. Since many fishers understand these dynamics, roughly [half the
world's fisheries are now sustainably fished.]{.underline} [Similar
logic]{.underline} has led to the emergence of cooperative arrangements
[to tackle]{.underline} the twin [problems of sustainability and
unacceptable labor practices]{.underline} in cocoa, palm oil, beef,
textiles, and mining and minerals. For example, a group of consumer
goods [companies]{.underline} seeking to [reduce
deforestation]{.underline} in order [to protect their
brand]{.underline}s was able to [persuade the buyers]{.underline} of
more than 60% of the world's publicly traded palm oil to join them in a
commitment [to buy only sustainable grown oil.]{.underline}

In some cases, these voluntary self-regulatory arrangements have been
extremely successful. [Cooperative arrangements significantly reduced
deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon for many years.]{.underline} But
they are often unstable. Without any real penalty for failing to
cooperate, firms are often tempted to renege on their commitments and
revert to business as usual.

Who -- or what -- might be capable of policing cooperation between
firms, essentially forcing them all to do the right thing and leaving no
one at a competitive disadvantage if they do? There are two
possibilities. The first is investors. A very large fraction of the
world's financial assets is controlled by roughly 12 firms. These firms
are so large that they cannot diversify away from the threat of
catastrophic risks such as climate change (Henderson, 2020b). Some of
the world's wealthiest owners are similarly exposed. The [Japanese
government pension fund]{.underline}, for example, is worth more than
\$1.6 trillion and owns roughly 1% of the world's equity markets. Hiro
Mizuno, who was its chief investment officer until early 2020, came to
[believe that solving problems like social inclusion and climate change
was central]{.underline} to his fiduciary duty because they posed severe
risks [to]{.underline} his [long-term returns]{.underline} (Henderson,
Lerner, Serafeim, & Jinjo, 2020).

The emergence of ESG metrics (Environmental, Social and Governance)
could give investors the means to insist that firms tackle environmental
and social problems, and to track their performance as they do. More and
more, investors are working together to push the firms they own to
address both social and environmental risks. For example, more than 450
investors, representing \$40 trillion in assets, have banded together to
form Climate Action 100+, a group devoted to pushing the world's 100
largest emitters to set concrete targets for reducing carbon emissions
and transitioning to a carbon free economy.

The second institution that might force firms to do the right thing is,
of course, government. If governments worldwide regulated or priced
carbon emissions, for example, it would be in every firm's economic
interest to solve climate change (Cramton, 2017). If governments
strengthened labor regulations, making it illegal to pay any worker less
than a living wage, if they invested heavily in education and health,
actively supported employee organization and aggressively taxed the
wealthy, inequality would fall. If it were illegal for corporations to
flood the political system with money and if anti-trust regulations were
routinely enforced, the largest and most powerful firms would be much
less able to shape the rules of the game in their own favor (Zingales,
2013).

Could business actually help to rebuild our institutions? Possibly.
[Businesspeople are already **coming together** to lobby in favor of
**carbon regulation** and **against money in politics**. We Are Still
In, for example, brings more than 2,000 firms together]{.underline} with
NGOs, faith communities, and city and state governments [to lobby for
pollution reduction targets which will allow the US to comply with the
Paris climate agreement.]{.underline} The NGOs American Promise and
Leadership Now coordinate networks of business leaders committed to
improving American democracy.

In the current environment it may be difficult to imagine the [business
community lobbying for the wholesale]{.underline} re[building of the
institutions of an **inclusive society**,]{.underline} but it [has
happened]{.underline} before. [Germany's private sector]{.underline}
played an important role in [develop]{.underline}ing [Germany's current
institutions]{.underline}, working collaboratively with organized labor
to develop a system of apprenticeship training that is often cited as
one of the central determinants of the country's low inequality and high
productivity, [and similar efforts]{.underline} played out [in countries
as diverse as Denmark and Mauritius]{.underline} (Henderson, 2020a).

Could it happen again? Could the private sector play a central role in
rebuilding our democracies? Should it? It might seem an unlikely idea.
But ask yourself -- what is the alternative? If business stays silent,
focused on profit alone, what will happen? The private sector must seize
the chance to reimagine capitalism.

#### Capitalism is the only solution to technology, innovation, and sustainability. Or else, extinction.

A few hundred years ago, before the rise of capitalism, humans were no
different---they lived roughly 35 years on average and had about
one-and-a-half billion heartbeats just like any other mammal. But gains
in knowledge since then, such as innovations in medicine, agriculture,
and government, have roughly doubled our life expectancy and with it our
average number of heartbeats per lifetime (some dogs and other
domesticated animals have been similarly altered by access to human
innovations). This constitutes a totally unprecedented departure from
the biological status Quo. [Technological knowledge, fueled by capital,
has allowed us to do many things categorically unlike the achievements
of other species as far as we know.]{.underline} The universal
extinction paradigm, which has limited all mammal species so far to one
million years or less, should be high on our list of patterns to break.
[We don't know what existential threats will come or how long we have to
prepare for them, but we can't expect human ingenuity to rush us past
the finish line at the last minute without a context of widespread
continuous technological and scientific progress until that point---**a
project it seems only capitalism can hope to fund.**]{.underline} David
Deutsch observes that the word "sustain" generally refers to the absence
or prevention of change. This is what environmentalists such as Naomi
Klein and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez would like to do with our environment
by ending capitalism. [Their solution to climate change is what all
non-human animals have always done: leave the environment basically
unaltered by refraining from large-scale production, and wait around to
go extinct]{.underline}. Unfortunately, as Deutsch writes, ["Static
societies eventually fail because their characteristic inability to
create knowledge rapidly must eventually turn some problem into a
catastrophe]{.underline}." Thus, it is not that capitalism is the
problem and sustainability is the solution, but that [**sustainability
is the problem and capitalism is the solution.** **Every year, global
capitalism allows more research and development departments to be
funded.**]{.underline} Every day it gives more citizens of affluent and
developing nations the material wealth required for better education and
information technology. Economic growth, coupled with rising carbon
emissions, might lead to a climate apocalypse---or it might continue to
bring us material and technological salvation. We cannot really know in
advance. But [we would be crazy to choose the time-tested alternative to
capitalism: extinction by stagnation.]{.underline}

Private Equity

While some private equity (PE) firms have been known as corpo-rate
raiders with a slash-and-burn approach, private equity's [model of
**value creation**---based on improving the companies in the firm's
portfolio]{.underline}---is well suited to helping scale up
impact-focused compa-nies. They can therefore be an attractive funding
source for double- bottom-line growth-stage companies and natural assets
such as timberland and working forests, particularly now when
traditional PE firms such as KKR, Bain Capital, Neuberger Berman,
Natixis, Apollo, and TPG started [creat]{.underline}ing dedicated
[social and sustainability funds focused on sectors such as
**ag**riculture, **energy**, **edu**cation, **health**, and
**housing.**]{.underline} PE firms generally take a stake in companies,
exercise control through representa tion on the company's board
(sometimes taking a direct role in management), and drive growth and
rapid performance improvement---typically in two to six years---before
selling the company. While less risky than venture capital, private
equity is also a high-risk investment proposition. Investors in PE funds
are typi-cally pension and sovereign wealth funds, endowments, and high
net worth individuals. Given the higher risk to investors and high
management charges, return expectations from this asset class are also
higher. When assessing investment opportunities, according to Cambridge
Associates, the US private equity index has delivered returns of about
11% over the past 10 years. [An example]{.underline} of how PE
investment can help scale up the social impact of its portfolio
companies [is LeapFrog's]{.underline} 15% ownership [**investment** in
India]{.underline}'s Mahindra Insurance Brokers in 2012. With the firm's
investment, the broker was able to become India's third largest,
[enabling it to provide **8 million people**]{.underline}---many of them
rural workers---[with property insurance, life insurance, and a health
insurance product costing as little as 70 cents a month that covers an
entire family's hospitalization costs.]{.underline} "No one has the
reach of Mahindra into rural areas," said Andrew Kuper, LeapFrog's
founder and CEO.42 He explained that [the firm pioneered the health
insurance product in Ghana, "and when we applied it in India, they had a
million people getting health insurance within three
years."]{.underline} In 2017, LeapFrog sold its investment stake to XL
Insurance Group, now part of AXA.It was in 2017, with the closing of the
\$2 billion Rise Fund---founded by TPG, the PE firm, in partnership with
Bono and philanthropist Jeff Skoll---that private equity for impact hit
the headlines. As [the Rise Fund]{.underline} has found, the number of
innovative young companies to choose from when investing for impact is
wide, compared with just a few years ago. The fund's
[investments]{.underline} include Acorns---a microfinance app that aims
to [**financially empower** the million Americans making less than
\$100,000 a year,]{.underline} and the [69% lacking \$1,000 in emergency
savings]{.underline}---and [ViewPoint Therapeutics]{.underline}, a
biotechnology company [develop]{.underline}ing [treatments for
diseases]{.underline} such as cataracts, which lead to visual impairment
and blindness and [affect more than **10 million**]{.underline} people
living [**in developing countries.** The fund helps its portfolio
companies grow by offering capacity-building skills and access to its
global network.]{.underline} It helps young busi-nesses shape their
narratives, giving them a better chance of attracting other investors.
This was the case for Cellulant, a pan-African finan-cial technology
company that in 2018 secured a \$47.5 million funding round led by Rise.
Ken Njoroge, co-CEO and cofounder, explains that the investors helped
the company focus on its business model: Was it a payments business or a
software provider? Was it going to sell to banks or to merchants?
"Frankly speaking, the story wasn't as neat as it is today," said
Njoroge.43 The Rise approach was a good fit for another reason: its
ability to help the company achieve both commercial growth and impact.
"You have a little bit of the patience of an impact investor with the
pressure of a PE," said Njoroge. "The Rise Fund sitting inside TPG
provided for us the attractive dynamic of a bridge in between that meant
we could actu-ally build a good business--- but then that business would
be funda mentally transformative."

is a force for good. BMJ; He was a retired British [medical

[The largest scale reduction of poverty in the history of the planet has
occurred over the past two
decades.[2](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1995499/#ref2) This
unprecedented progress is mainly due to the progressive adoption of
capitalism by the vast populations of China, India, and other Asian
nations: China alone is lifting a million people a month out of
poverty.[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1995499/#ref3) ]{.underline}Yet
Maryon-Davis seems not to have noticed this. [The poorest parts of the
world are the least capitalist.]{.underline} Some nations in sub-Saharan
Africa are going backwards. In Malawi the standard of living (daily
calorie consumption) is perhaps the lowest that has ever existed in
human history. This is a consequence of medical advances which allow
population to increase even during chronic
famine.[^4^](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1995499/#ref4)
[Poverty is bad for health; and wealth is the only thing that can cure
poverty.[5](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1995499/#ref5) And
China and India show that capitalist wealth creation is effective, while
the more "socialist" and redistributive WHO strategy (focusing on health
equity) has a poor track record. The entrenched ideology of
anti-modernisation among international public health professionals
stands in the path of further progress, both at home and abroad. What
the sick and poor of the world need is more capitalism, more
industrialisation, and more globalisation]{.underline}.

[Nothing has done more to lift humanity out of poverty than the market
economy. This claim is true whether we are looking at a time span of
decades or of centuries. The number of people worldwide living on less
than about two dollars per day today is [less than
half](http://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/poverty/overview) of what it was
in 1990. The biggest gains in the fight against poverty have occurred in
countries that have opened up their markets, such as China and India. If
we look over the longer historical period, we can see that the trends
today are just the continuation of capitalism's victories in beating
back poverty.]{.underline} For most of human history, we lived in a
world of a few haves and lots of have-nots. That slowly began to change
with the advent of capitalism and the [Industrial
Revolution](https://fee.org/articles/a-myth-shattered-mises-hayek-and-the-industrial-revolution/).
As economic growth took off and spread throughout the population, it
created our own world in the West in which there are a whole bunch of
haves and a few have-more-and-betters.For example, the percentage of
American households below the poverty line who have basic appliances has
grown steadily over the [last few
decades](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2559403),
with poor families in 2005 being more likely to own things like a
clothes dryer, dishwasher, refrigerator, or air conditioner than the
average household was in 1971. And consumer items that didn't even exist
back then, such as cell phones, were owned by half of poor households in
2005 and are owned by a substantial majority of them today.[Capitalism
has also made poor people's lives far better by reducing infant and
child mortality rates, not to mention maternal death rates during
childbirth, and by extending life expectancies by decades.Consider, too,
the way capitalism's engine of growth has enabled the planet to sustain
almost 7 billion people, compared to 1 billion in 1800.]{.underline}
As [Deirdre
McCloskey](http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/B/bo9419313.html) has
noted, [if you multiply the gains in consumption to the average human by
the gain in life expectancy worldwide by 7 (for 7 billion as compared to
1 billion people), humanity as a whole is better off by a factor of
around 120. That's not 120 percent better off, but 120 times better off
since 1800. The competitive market process has also made education, art,
and culture available to more and more people. Even the poorest of
Americans, not to mention many of the global poor, have access through
the Internet and TV to concerts, books, and works of art that were
exclusively the province of the wealthy for centuries. And in the
wealthiest countries, the dynamics of capitalism have begun to change
the very nature of work. Where once humans toiled for 14 hours per day
at backbreaking outdoor labor, now an increasing number of us work
inside in climate-controlled comfort. Our workday and workweek have
shrunk thanks to the much higher value of labor that comes from working
with productive capital. We spend a much smaller percentage of our lives
working for pay, whether we're rich or poor. And even with economic
change, the incomes of the poor are much less variable, as they are not
linked to the unpredictable changes in weather that are part and parcel
of a predominantly agricultural economy long since
disappeared]{.underline}.Think of it this way: the fabulously wealthy
kings of old had servants attending to their every need, but an impacted
tooth would likely kill them. The poor in largely capitalist countries
have access to a quality of medical care and a variety and quality of
food that the ancient kings could only dream of. Consider, too, that the
working poor of London 100 years ago were, at best, able to split a
pound of meat per week among all of their children, which were greater
in number than the two or three of today. In addition, the whole family
ate meat once a week on Sunday, the one day the man of the household was
home for dinner. That was meat for a week. Compare that to today, when
we worry that poor Americans are too easily able to afford a meal with a
quarter pound of meat in it every single day for less than an hour's
labor. Even if you think that capitalism has made poor
people [overweight](https://fee.org/articles/mandatory-calorie-counts-are-a-dumb-idea-and-dont-help-obesity/),
that's a major accomplishment compared to the precapitalist norm of
constant malnutrition and the struggle even 100 years ago for the
working poor to get enough calories. The reality is that the rich have
always lived well historically, as for centuries they could commandeer
human labor to attend to their every need. [In a precapitalist world,
the poor had no hope of upward mobility or of relief from the endless
physical drudgery that barely kept them alive. Today, the poor in
capitalist countries live like kings, thanks mostly to the freeing of
labor and the ability to accumulate capital that makes that labor more
productive and enriches even the poorest.]{.underline} The falling cost
of what were once luxuries and are now necessities, driven by the
competitive market and its profit and loss signals, has brought
labor-saving machines to the masses. When profit-seeking and innovation
became acceptable behavior for the bourgeoisie, the horn of plenty
brought forth its bounty, and even the poorest shared in that wealth.
Once people no longer needed [permission to
innovate](https://fee.org/articles/permissionless-innovation-vs-the-precautionary-principle/),
and once the value of new inventions was judged by the improvements they
made to the lives of the masses in the form of profit and loss, the poor
began to live lives of comfort and dignity. These changes are not, as
some would say, about technology. After all, the Soviets had great
scientists but could not channel that knowledge into material comfort
for their poor. And it's not about natural resources, which is obvious
today as resource-poor [Hong
Kong](https://fee.org/articles/the-man-behind-the-hong-kong-miracle/) is
among the richest countries in the world thanks to capitalism,
while [Venezuelan
socialism](https://fee.org/articles/venezuela-runs-out-of-toilet-paper-achieves-true-socialism/) has
destroyed that resource-rich country.

### ! -- War

#### Cap solves [war]{.underline}.

Dr. Rainer **Zitelmann 23**, Former Lecturing Professor at Freie
Universität Berlin and former chief editor of Ullstein-Propyläen, "*In
Defense of Capitalism*,"
https://www.ipgbook.com/in-defense-of-capitalism-products-9781645720744.php

First of all, it can be stated that [even on the basis of pure
statistics, the thesis of war-mongering capitalism does not stand up to
scrutiny. With the **rise of capitalism** 200 years ago, the
**frequency** of **wars**]{.underline} did not increase; it
**[significantly decreased]{.underline}**.

I would like to devote this chapter to an examination of three wars by
way of example: the First and Second World Wars and the Iraq War of
2003. I will pursue the question of the extent to which these wars were
"capitalist wars," that is, were triggered exclusively or predominantly
by capitalist interests.

Before we turn to these examples, however, I would like to present some
of the findings of war and conflict research. For many years, a majority
of researchers maintained that democratic countries do not wage war
against each other, or at least very infrequently. 482 Some researchers
qualified this finding somewhat and applied it only to democracies that
also happen to be developed, industrialized nations. But overall, there
was broad consensus on this finding, and the thesis was tested
statistically by forming so-called dyads, pairs of states. These dyads
represent the units of investigation to examine how often and for what
reason such states engaged in military conflict with each other.

There was and is no agreement among researchers as to why democracies
rarely---or perhaps never, given a narrow definition of democracy---wage
war against each other. 483 The German sociologist Erich Weede, who has
conducted extensive research on these issues, stated in 2005 that ["the
**danger** of **conflict** is **particularly low** in dyads where both
states]{.underline} are governed democratically and [**trade**
significantly with each other or are otherwise **economically**
**interdependent**]{.underline}." 484

Since throughout history most democratic states have, at the same time,
been capitalist and most capitalist states have, at the same time, been
democracies, it has never been easy to decide which is more important
for peace: whether a country had a democratic order or whether it had a
capitalist system. As I said, both have typically existed
simultaneously, although there have always been exceptions. Chile under
Pinochet, for example, was capitalist but a dictatorship. Today, China,
too, is increasingly adopting features of capitalism, but it is still a
dictatorship.

In 2007, the American political scientist Erik Gartzke published an
extensive **[empirical analysis]{.underline}** in which he explored
precisely this question: Which plays the greater role in ensuring that
there are fewer wars: democracy or capitalism? Gartzke analyzed dyads
from 1950 to 1992 and examined a total of 222 wars. 485 He [employed
**metrics** for **all**]{.underline} of the [**countries** to show to
what **extent** they were]{.underline} democratic (politically) or
**[capitalist]{.underline}** (economically). Using these ratios, Gartzke
then applied a **[regression analysis]{.underline}** relating to whether
or not the country was engaged in a military conflict. He concludes:
"This study [offers **evidence** suggesting that
**capitalism**]{.underline}, and not democracy, [**leads** to
**peace**]{.underline}." 486

In a **[further study]{.underline}** in 2010, Gartzke and Joseph Hewitt
also [analyzed military conflicts from 1950 to 1992]{.underline}, this
time examining only those conflicts "that elicit decisions from a
state's highest ranking foreign policy leaders." Conflicts that may have
resulted "from clashes between frontline forces not directly authorized
by leading officials" were not considered. 487 This analysis once again
[**focused** on the question of whether a country's democratic political
order or its **capitalist economic order** was more likely to
**prevent** military **conflicts**]{.underline}. Once again, [the result
was that **capitalism**]{.underline}, not democracy, [was the **most
important factor** in the **absence** or **reduced frequency** of
military **conflicts**]{.underline}. Gartzke and Weede agree "that it is
**[economic development]{.underline}** and market freedoms, rather than
political liberty, that [precipitate **interstate peace**]{.underline}."
488

Supporters of the theory of "capitalist peace," however, have different
answers as to why capitalism results in less frequent conflicts. On this
point, Weede more strongly emphasizes the factor of countries'
interdependence through **[trade relations]{.underline}**, while Gartzke
believes that [**financial** market **integration** is]{.underline} more
important [for **peace**]{.underline} than trade.

The topic of trade and war is not new. The British manufacturer and
political campaigner Richard Cobden (1804--1865), a leading champion of
the free trade movement, was at the same time a committed pacifist and
emphasized the importance of trade and mutual economic dependence in
preventing war. "I believe," Cobden writes, "that the desire and the
motive for large and mighty empires, for gigantic armies and navies, for
those materials which are used for the destruction of life and the
desolation of the rewards of labour, will die away." 489 Gartzke, on the
other hand, argues that trade plays a more ambivalent role in preventing
war: "Economic development, financial markets, and monetary policy
coordination all arguably play a more critical role in promoting peace."
490

In 2018, Weede questioned the methodological validity of studies that
conclude that trade does not play a decisive role in whether military
conflicts become less likely and "if all of these shortcomings are
avoided, then almost all studies support the proposition 'peace by free
trade.'" 491 Thus, states that are closely linked by trade are
significantly less likely to engage in military conflict with one
another

Although [**researchers** are still debating which **characteristics**
of **capitalism** play the greatest role in ensuring]{.underline} that
there are [fewer military conflicts between capitalist
states]{.underline}, 492 [at least researchers]{.underline} such as
Weede and Gartzke [have presented **convincing arguments** to support
the view that **capitalism**]{.underline} and not democracy [is the
**decisive factor**]{.underline}. "Since democracy depends on capitalism
or economic freedom as well as the prosperity generated by it, the
democratic peace becomes a mere component of the capitalist peace." 493

Regarding [the frequently cited counter-argument of the **First World
War**, in]{.underline} which [capitalist countries]{.underline}
(including Germany on one side and France and Great Britain on the
other) [fought each other]{.underline}, Weede argues that [**trade
dependencies** were weaker between **France** and
**Germany**]{.underline} (who fought against each other) than was the
case between [**Great Britain** and **France**]{.underline} (who [did
not go to war with each other]{.underline}). 494 "As far as [**trade
linkages** were]{.underline} concerned they [were **strongest**
where]{.underline} least needed---between Britain and France, between
Britain and the United States, between Germany and Austria-Hungary.
These [**pairs** ended up on the **same side** of the
**war**]{.underline}." 495

For me, there is another, more fundamental argument that holds more
weight: Of course, capitalist countries can also wage wars against each
other, and the First World War is just one example of this. Researchers
working on the theory of "capitalist peace" have analyzed long lists of
military conflicts and then examined whether the countries involved were
capitalist or not. However, in my opinion, this method alone does not
lead to a satisfactory conclusion. First of all, it is possible for
capitalist countries to wage war against non-capitalist countries, and
above all, it is conceivable that [countries whose economic system is
capitalist do wage war]{.underline} against each other---[but for
reasons that have **nothing** to do with their **economic
systems**]{.underline}. For by no means is capitalism always ultimately
responsible when countries with capitalist economic systems wage war
against each other. After all, decisions relating to war and peace are
not made by capitalist entrepreneurs, but by politicians, that is,
states. In Marxist theory, of course, the state under capitalism is
always only an agent and executor of the interests of big business---an
argument I refuted in Chapter 5.

From my point of view, [it is necessary to analyze]{.underline} and
determine for each specific conflict whether and [to what extent
representatives of the business class exerted a decisive influence in
the run-up]{.underline} to the outbreak of war or whether politicians
allowed their actions and policies to be directed by business interests.
[Taking the First World War as an example]{.underline}, I will show that
this was not the case and that [leading **representatives** of the
**business communities** in both **Germany** and **Great Britain** were
**opposed** to military action and **war**]{.underline}.

### ! -- Space Col

#### Growth's key to [space colonization]{.underline}---extinction. 

Marko **Kovic 19**, co-founder president of the Zurich Institute of
Public Affairs Research, 2019, \"The future of energy,\"

[Ideally]{.underline}, the [mitigation of climate risks
will]{.underline} **[coincide]{.underline}** [with and]{.underline}
**[contribute]{.underline}** [to the development of improved or even
entirely novel **sources of energy**]{.underline} [that will increase
the **long-term chances of humankind's survival**]{.underline} [by means
of]{.underline} **[space colonization]{.underline}**. [This is **not an
unrealistic expectation**]{.underline}, [given that the mitigation of
climate risks consists]{.underline}, to a large degree, [of replacing
fossil fuels with other, less harmful sources of energy]{.underline}.
However, [some climate change mitigation strategies might
actually]{.underline} **[harm the long-term prospects of
humankind]{.underline}**.

First, [it is possible that dominant climate change
mitigation]{.underline} strategies [will actively **exclude** any form
of]{.underline} **[nuclear energy]{.underline}** [from the repertoire of
climate-friendly energy sources. Existing and experimental]{.underline}
(molten salt) [fission reactors could play a significant role in
replacing carbon-heavy energy sources]{.underline}, but
pro-environmental attitudes often overlap with anti-nuclear sentiments
\[65\]. As a result, and in combination with other problems such as
large-scale market failures of existing fission reactors (one of the
reasons being that generating electricity from fossil fuels is cheaper)
\[66\], nuclear fission does not currently have significant standing as
a "cleantech" contribution to climate change mitigation. From a
long-term perspective, an unfavorable view of nuclear energy in the
context of climate change might mean that technological progress in the
areas of nuclear fission and fusion might come to a halt (for example,
due to explicit bans or implicit disincentives). [If such a scenario
came to be, our attempts at **colonizing space** would
almost]{.underline} **[certainly fail]{.underline}**: [There are
currently no alternatives to **fission** and **fusion**, and it
is]{.underline} **[highly improbable]{.underline}** [that Solar power
alone could suffice for sustaining **extraterrestrial
habitats**]{.underline}.

Second, [there is some probability that climate change mitigation
strategies will **change the social order**]{.underline} [towards
a]{.underline} **[degrowth]{.underline}** [philosophy. Degrowth is a
vague socio-economic concept and social movement that]{.underline}, in
general, [calls for a]{.underline} **[contraction]{.underline}** [of the
global and national economies by means of]{.underline} **[lower
production]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[consumption
rates]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}, to some degree, to [more
**profound changes**]{.underline} [to the "capitalist" system
of]{.underline} **[economic production]{.underline}** \[67\]. Degrowth
or degrowth-like approaches are being actively considered as climate
risk mitigation strategies \[68, 69\], and [degrowth would almost
certainly be a highly effective measure for mitigating climate
change]{.underline}. After all, if we were to drastically reduce or even
completely eliminate the (industrial) sources of greenhouse gases, [the
amount of greenhouse gases that are being emitted would accordingly
drastically sink. From the **long-term perspective**]{.underline} [of
**humankind's survival**, degrowth is **problematic**]{.underline} in at
least two ways. [First, there is a risk that the general contraction of
economic activity would also slow or]{.underline} **[eliminate
progress]{.underline}** [in the domain of]{.underline}
**[energy]{.underline}**, [which would,]{.underline} in turn, [reduce
the probability of **successful space colonization**]{.underline} [due
to an absence of **suitable energy sources**]{.underline}. [Second, and
more fundamental: If degrowth were to become a]{.underline} **[dominant
societal paradigm]{.underline}**, [it is **uncertain** whether the
long-term survival of humankind by means of **space
colonization**]{.underline} [would be regarded a **desirable
goal**]{.underline}. [In a literal sense, establishing
**extraterrestrial colonies would mean growth**]{.underline}; [the size
of the total human population would grow,]{.underline} and the area of
space-time that humans occupy would grow.

[In a more philosophical sense, degrowth might even be]{.underline}
**[antithetical to space colonization]{.underline}**. [Even though both
degrowth and space colonization have a similar moral goal]{.underline}
-- [increasing wellbeing]{.underline} -- , [the ends to that goal are
very different. Within degrowth]{.underline} philosophy, [the goal
is,]{.underline} metaphorically speaking, [not to "live beyond our
means": We should strive for "ecological balance", and such a state
should increase the]{.underline} **[average wellbeing]{.underline}**.
[But the frame of reference is the status quo; Earth and humankind as we
know it **today**. Space colonization,]{.underline} on the other hand,
[operates with a much]{.underline} [**larger frame** of
reference]{.underline}: **[All the future generations of
humans]{.underline}** (and other sentient beings) [who could enjoy
wellbeing if we succeed in colonizing space]{.underline} -- [and who
will categorically be **denied that wellbeing**]{.underline} [if we fail
to colonize space]{.underline} \[70\]. [The goal of space colonization
as a **moral project**]{.underline} [is not to live beyond our means,
but to actively **redefine** and]{.underline} **[expand]{.underline}**
[what our means are through scientific and **technological
progress**]{.underline}.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10614598/)

A concerted effort to expand economic activity in space has the perhaps
unique potential, at least in principle, to address indefinitely both
the demand and supply roots of secular stagnation. In brief, the
potential is as follows. On the demand side, if the United States were
to return to its historical peak levels of public-sector investment in
space---as a share of federal government outlays or gross domestic
product---it could directly add between \$1.5 trillion and \$3 trillion
to demand over the next two decades and indirectly add, by inspiring
**[private-sector investment in]{.underline}** expanded
**[space]{.underline}** activities, potentially much more. [On the
supply side, space might **serve as a new and**]{.underline} essentially
[**infinite physical frontier**, **spurring** **dynamism**,
**innovation**, **and** thus **productivity growth** as have frontiers
throughout history]{.underline}, but this time [**with no end point.**
Similarly, expansion into s**pace is humanity's only real option for
sustained population growth** in the long run.]{.underline} As far as I
am aware, [**only space** offers this combination of
attributes]{.underline}.

To explain this potential a bit more, I start by briefly describing the
idea of secular stagnation and leading explanations for its reappearance
in developed economies in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. [I
then summarize the **reshaping of the space sector** over the past two
decades and discuss the features of the sector, noted above, which may
make it a **promising path** for **escap**]{.underline}ing
[**stagnation** traps]{.underline}. I put special emphasis on Frederick
Jackson Turner's (8) well-known theory of the frontier as a source of
innovation and how space---colloquially known as the "final
frontier"---fits with it. I close with observations on the scale of
historical public investment in space to quantify the potential size of
a policy intervention.

1. SECULAR STAGNATION: A BRIEF PRIMER

The secular stagnation hypothesis first appeared in the late 1930s, when
Alvin Hansen noted---in his Presidential address to the American
Economic Association---a risk of "depressions which feed on themselves,"
a natural subject given the decade the global economy had just
experienced. [The phrase "secular stagnation" was meant to capture both
the persistent nature of the threat and its core feature, namely
**slow** or **negligible econ**omic **growth**]{.underline}.

Low and declining economic growth rates across high-income countries
over the past few decades have revived interest in the secular
stagnation hypothesis, especially as relations between the United States
and a rapidly growing China have become more contentious. The average
real growth rate in the OECD, according to official OECD data, fell from
4.5% over 1960 to 1979, to 2.9% over 1980 to 1999, to only 1.8% over
2000 to 2019. And averages obscure the dramatic case of Japan, for which
these three figures were 7.2%, 2.9%, and 0.7%, respectively. Many
commentators, including leading macroeconomist Lawrence Summers (9),
have warned that the rest of the high-income world is in danger of
"Japanification" if the threat of secular stagnation is not met. The
corresponding figures for the United States, for example, were 3.9%,
3.3%, and 2.0%.

What is the secular stagnation hypothesis? In simple terms, [**secular
stagnation** is the idea that a **sluggish outlook** for the economy
causes people to **save more** and **firms to invest less**, and if
interest rates cannot fall enough to spur investment (perhaps because of
the sluggish outlook), the lack of investment **make**s the
**low-growth** prospects all the more likely to be **fulfilled,
initiating a vicious cycle.**]{.underline} Buried in that seemingly
simple statement are a number of steps that macroeconomists try to model
formally, so as to be sure that they understand the mechanism. For
example, **[Robert Gordon]{.underline}** (10) [describes the
mechanism]{.underline} as follows, ["Slower growth in potential output
from the supply side, emanating not just from slow productivity growth
but from slower population growth and declining labor-force
participation, reduces the need for capital formation, and this in turn
subtracts from aggregate demand and reinforces the decline in
productivity growth. In the end, secular stagnation is not about just
demand or supply but also about the interaction between demand and
supply."]{.underline}

[Gordon mentions **demand** and **supply** because his view starts with
what economists call **"supply-side drivers,"** such as **productivity**
and **population growth**, but requires us to have a theory of why
demand does not step in to save the day]{.underline}. Summers (11)
provides a different description of the core mechanism which does just
that, stressing the role of what economists call the "zero lower bound"
on nominal interest rates. Summers stresses interest rates because they
are supposed to automatically adjust to help a sluggish economy
self-correct. In particular, when there is less reason to invest---for
example, because productivity or population growth is low---we expect
the supply of investment funding to exceed the demand for it, pushing
down the cost of funding, namely nominal interest rates. [If **nominal
interest rates fall**, we in turn expect the **inflation-adjusted cost
of funding**---what economists call the real interest rate---to fall as
well, and thus spur demand for investment. That is, **we expect the
economy to self-correct**]{.underline}.

A problem can arise, however, when conditions are such that the real
interest rate would need to fall well below zero to spur investment
enough to spring an economy out of a stagnation trap. Nominal interest
rates cannot fall (much) below zero because no one will lend cash at
negative rates, and this "zero lower bound" on nominal interest rates
means that real interest rates may also have a floor below which they
cannot fall, especially if a sluggish economy generates deflationary
pressure. If real interest rates cannot fall enough, investment remains
too expensive, and the economy gets stuck in a low-growth stagnation
trap. As suggested above, modern high-income countries with low
population and productivity growth may find themselves in precisely
these conditions. Or, in Summers' own words: "\...if one assumes that
investment is a decreasing function of the interest rate and that saving
is an increasing function of the interest rate and that the level at
which equilibrium with full employment takes place requires a negative
nominal interest rate, then adjustment will take place in the form of a
lower level of output, and that lower level of output may continue
indefinitely."

How does such a vicious cycle get started? Answers rely on a similar mix
of supply-side and demand-side reasons. To Gordon, the slowdown in
productivity and population growth over the past several decades---which
are themselves products of myriad factors---are to blame. Summers makes
room for these factors, but he adds that demand-side factors---such as
the falling relative price of capital goods and capital intensity of
leading firms' technological innovations, as well as persistently low
inflation and nominal interest rates---depress investment demand
relative to saving and are sufficient to get us into trouble on their
own.

And how can it be stopped? Gordon's analysis would imply a focus on
increasing productivity and population, as the higher growth rates they
would engender would spur **[private investment]{.underline}** and
[**initiate a virtuous cycle** through the secular stagnation mechanism
run in reverse.]{.underline} Summers (11) stresses demand-side stimulus,
noting that Hansen's dire predictions were not borne out immediately
because "Hansen wrote before he knew there was going to be a Second
World War, a baby boom, massive investments involved in creating modern
suburbia, and a large-scale increase in the role of government\..." and
that, in the current situation (of 2015), "I find it hard to make a
rational case against a substantial increase in public investments in
Europe and in the United States."

[Interestingly, although it is not often stressed, the practical
implications may be quite similar whether one subscribes more to the
supply-side or demand-side mechanism,]{.underline} namely to spur
private investment, perhaps through public investment, in
capital-intensive, productivity-enhancing, and population-increasing
projects, at a massive scale. Summers, in particular, stresses
infrastructure such as airports and roads as a prime target for the sort
of action he recommends. Kevin O'Rourke (12) stresses [new "green"
infrastructure as a path forward (in response to environmental threats
that may themselves worsen secular stagnation):]{.underline} "If the
scientists are to be believed, and I assume that they are, then climate
change is the biggest single threat we face today. Heading it off is
going to require investment in a whole host of energy and transportation
related sectors."

[2. **SPACE AS A FOCAL POINT FOR COMBATTING SECULAR
STAGNATION**]{.underline}

As the discussion above suggests, [space meets a **number of
qualifications** required of a focal point for investments to overcome
secular stagnation, and it has some **unique characteristics** that
arguably increase its potential]{.underline}. Before turning to these
features, however, we provide a brief primer on the recent revolution in
the modern space sector for those not familiar with it. Additional
details can be found in Weinzierl (13) and the many references cited
therein.

2.1. The Twenty-First Century Rise of **[Commercial
Space]{.underline}**. The Space Age began with the Soviet Union's launch
of Sputnik in 1957. The subsequent decade saw enormous investments by
both the Soviet Union and the United States on "space race" programs,
most famously the latter's Apollo program that landed astronauts on the
moon in 1969. For the next several decades, these two governments and
(to a lesser extent) others built space programs focused on providing
what economists call public goods, namely national security, the
**[pursuit]{.underline}** of basic science, **[and exploration of
space]{.underline}** (14). Consistent with these objectives,
public-sector institutions---both civilian (such as NASA) and military
(such as the US Department of Defense)---designed, directed, and funded
these programs. Much was accomplished, from the Space Transportation
System (the "Space Shuttle"), to scientific instruments such as the
Hubble Telescope, to the International Space Station, the crowning jewel
of the first half-century of the space age and an effort that brought
Russia and the United States, among many others, together in a hopeful
symbol of the power of space to transcend terrestrial divisions.

Despite the achievements of the first 50 y in space, failures of the
Space Shuttle and a perceived slowing of innovation in the sector
eventually led to a shift away from the government-led model toward
decentralization and commercialization. A crucial inflection point was
the Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) contracts of the
mid-2000s, in which NASA changed its approach to working with private
space contractors along a few key dimensions. First, the agency awarded
fixed-price rather than cost-plus contracts and awarded those contracts
to multiple providers, changes that powerfully incentivized efficiency
and increased competition. Second, the agency moved from providing
"oversight" to "insight" for its contractors, freeing them to act with
fewer constraints, cut costs, and speed production. Finally, NASA looked
to become "one customer among many," explicitly urging companies to
build products that would have other customers (and allowing them to
retain the intellectual property that would make that possible). These
changes, along with crucial technological advances that lowered the cost
of space activities, led to a surge of private-sector entrepreneurship,
investment, and success in the sector. Most famously, SpaceX quickly
rose to become the globally dominant launch provider, progressively
driving launch costs down by an order of magnitude from the days of the
Space Shuttle through innovative management, production, and
organizational practices. Edgar Zapata, a NASA engineer, estimated that
resupply of the ISS using SpaceX cost less than half what it would have
cost had NASA followed its previous practices (15).

[**Private investment** capital has aided this transition, with as much
as \$270 billion fueling **a boom** in space businesses across a wide
range of technologies]{.underline} over the past decade, according to
data from Space Capital (16). SpaceX and Amazon have invested tens of
billions of dollars themselves in building out [satellite]{.underline}
constellation[s, promising a new set of Earth observation capabilities
and enormous potential for **data** processing, **communications**, and
**transmission** at scale. The revolutions in launch and technology
costs have also led to early steps toward building a more **holistic
space infrastructure**,]{.underline} from refueling depots in space, to
sustained lunar operations, to commercial space stations.

In this reshaped approach to space, the public and private sectors play
complementary roles in driving innovation and progress. Public-sector
actors---both civilian and military---continue to be the largest source
of funding for fundamental research, exploration, and other activities
that the marketplace has difficulty supporting at efficient levels,
thereby providing a foundation of discovery and innovation upon which
private actors can build. In turn, the [**priv**ate sector's **inherent
dynamism** and **discipline** help public-sector actors to pursue their
goals more **efficiently**]{.underline}, namely through mechanisms that
share key components with the COTS program. These private actors also
bring their own, commercial objectives to space, expanding the range of
activities that can be funded and pursued.

I now turn to describing why this reshaped space sector is promising as
a focal point for an investment push to avoid secular stagnation. I
consider both the supply and demand side of secular stagnation as
described above.

[2.2. **Supply Side**: Space as a **Frontier** to **Drive Productivity
and Population Growth**. Economists have pointed to low rates of
productivity and population growth as key supply-side drivers of secular
stagnation in high-income countries. I consider how expanded activity in
space might address each.]{.underline}

First, supporters of space exploration often tout the foundational
technologies that rely upon and have been developed in space (e.g.,
refs. (17) and (18)) as well as the economic activity supported by space
activities more generally (19). [The **extreme environment** of
**space** and the **high cost and complexity** of launch have **made
innovation crucial to** activity in **space**; NASA]{.underline} (20)
[officially cites camera]{.underline} [**phones**, **LEDs**, **portable
computers**, and even **athletic shoes** as a few of the "20 **things we
wouldn't have without space** travel" and lists such as that omits
**ubiquitous tech**nologies that rely on space such as the Global
Positioning System (**GPS**) and **satellite-based
communications**]{.underline}. [**Extrapolating** **from this**
experience, we might hope that the **expansion of** economic activity in
**space** would continue to **generate dramatic breakthroughs and
inventions, driving productivity growth both in space and on
Earth**]{.underline} (21). Such [hopes are **made** substantially **more
plausible by the rise of commercial space** discussed above **and** the
consequent shift toward a space sector]{.underline} that combines the
power of public-sector investments in [fundamental research and
exploration with **the market's power to drive innovation and
productivity**---what]{.underline} McCloskey (22) calls its "innovism."
Ideally, [**thi**s sector will be able increasingly (and sustainably,
likely with the help of domestic regulation and international
agreements) to tap into resources in space--such as **rare Earth
elements, space-based solar** power, and the unique **research**
environment provided by the vacuum and microgravity of space---to drive
economic development, as was the case for the US
manufacturing]{.underline} sector in the early twentieth century
(23)**[.]{.underline}**

One explanation for why space has generated, and could continue to
generate, so much innovation is that space is a classic "frontier"
environment in the words of Frederick Jackson Turner, an American
historian who famously argued in an 1893 essay that America's economic
and cultural dynamism had their roots in the persistent growth of the
country into frontier territory (which he warned had just reached its
conclusion). While Turner's narrative has been complicated in recent
decades by those---notably Patricia Limerick (24)---who emphasize the
tragic side of American expansionism into territories viewed as
homelands, not frontiers, by indigenous peoples, his idea that expansion
into a challenging and new physical space drives growth lives on as
conventional wisdom for many.

The idea of space as an inspirational frontier is widespread. The
influential television and movie series Star Trek made famous the
phrase: "Space, the Final Frontier." New York Times columnist Ross
Douthat (25) has celebrated the potential of [**sp**ace to reverse
societa**l decline**]{.underline}, writing: "I suspect that a truly
globalized civilization cannot help tending toward decadence so long as
it remains earthbound, so long as there is no hope of finding actual new
worlds to leap toward, conquer, or explore\... So if we want to really
**[escape]{.underline}** decadence\... we need to find a way to climb,
to make a ladder **[to the stars]{.underline}**, and to offer future
generations of humanity a new reality to explore\..." And Turner's
thesis was explicitly linked to space by NASA's own Chief Historian
Stephen J. Dick, who wrote: "The Western frontier closed about 1890, but
Americans found a new one in space." (26)

But what is the mechanism through which this frontier theory might
operate? Though admittedly speculative, we can use recent academic
research on the effects of the frontier to suggest a two-step mechanism
with particular relevance given the current shape of the commercializing
space sector and the context of secular stagnation.

First, Bazzi et al. (27) "shows that the American frontier gave rise to
a persistent culture of **[rugged individualism]{.underline}**."
Specifically, they measure exposure to the American frontier at the
county level from 1790 to 1890 and measure individualism using the
relative prevalence of infrequent children's names in frontier
territories. They describe the idea as follows, "The foundational
contributions\... associate individualism with several related traits: a
view of the self as independent rather than interdependent, emphasis on
self-reliance, primacy of self-interest, and regulation of behavior by
personal attitudes rather than social norms." They find that "Long after
the closing of the frontier, counties with greater TFE \[total frontier
exposure\] exhibit more pervasive individualism."

It is of course debatable whether expanded space activity would generate
the same (or effectively similar) rugged individualism as did the
Western continental American frontier. Reasons for skepticism exist: the
exploration of space is exceedingly dangerous, and at least its early
stages are likely to be dominated by small groups whose members are
highly coordinated, interdependent, and hierarchically commanded. But
like all frontiers, [**sp**ace will attract those individuals who are
willing to take on great risk to pursue a new way of life and new
resour**ces**]{.underline} (which, in space, may include not only
material resources but new settings, such as a vacuum with
microgravity). They may face different dangers than the
**[pioneers]{.underline}** before them, but frontiers have always been
dangerous, and those who [**overcame** the **dangers** of prior
frontiers have appeared to pass on their determination and rugged
individualism]{.underline} to those who follow. It seems reasonable to
expect that space as a frontier would have similar effects.

Importantly, the rise of commercial space over the past two decades is
likely to reinforce the culture of rugged individualism in an expanded
space sector[. The shifts described above---from a centralized space
sector with little competition to a sector that includes both
public-sector activities]{.underline} and [**decentralized**,
**competitive**, "arms-length" activities---empower small]{.underline}er
[firms and individuals]{.underline} by upsetting the established order.
These shifts also require private actors to bear more risk than before,
arguably encouraging some of the ruggedness that characterized past
pioneers.

Second, in this journal, Gorodnichenko and Roland (28) provide [**strong
evidence** of a **causal effect of individualism** on income per worker,
total factor **productivity**, and **innovation**, writing: "Countries
having a more individualist culture have enjoyed higher long-run
**growth** than countries with a more collectivist culture.
Individualist]{.underline} culture attache[s social status rewards to
personal achievements and thus, provides not only monetary incentives
for innovation but also social status rewards, leading to **higher rates
of innovation** and economic growth."]{.underline} Related, and also in
this journal, Leonard and Smith (29) use the Bazzi et al. data described
above to show that individualism is positively related to measures of
economic mobility across US counties. Together, these findings suggest
that the effects of individualism operate at the macro and micro levels
to generate more dynamic economies.

Thought of as a "country" of its own, the **[commercial
space]{.underline}** sector that arose over the past two decades has a
culture that prizes innovation and **[rewards individual
s]{.underline}**uccess. Many date the start of the sector's recent rise
to the \$10 million Ansari X **[prize]{.underline}**, awarded in 2004 to
a company led by celebrated aerospace designer Burt Rutan. British
billionaire and entrepreneur Richard Branson bought the rights to
Rutan's design, making it the basis of Virgin Galactic's race to develop
space tourism. And Branson is far from alone: Jeff Bezos and Elon
Musk---two of the world's richest individuals **[and]{.underline}** both
**[entrepreneurs]{.underline}**---founded and **[lead]{.underline}** the
two most prominent new launch companies of the past two decades, Blue
Origin and SpaceX. [**Hundreds of space start**ups form each year,
funded by a growing space-focused]{.underline} [**venture capital**
sector that is moving space from an industry dominated by enormous
diversified government contractors with steady growth to a fast-paced,
rapidly changing sector]{.underline} with many spectacular failures and
a few spectacular successes, much like the "technology" sector of the
past few decades. The direct involvement of many of that technology
sector's leaders in space---and the increasing numbers of talented young
people choosing to start space companies---suggests just the dynamic
environment that the research on historical frontiers has identified as
helping translate individualism into innovation.

Additional research finds that the relationship between individualism
and growth is stronger in low-growth environments. In fact, despite the
studies cited above, the evidence on the effect of individualism on
innovation and growth is not definitive, with some researchers finding
uncertain or even negative relationships. Recent work by Mostaghel et
al. (30), however, uses Bazzi et al.'s measures of individualism to
"demonstrate the greater (limited) value of rugged individualism in low
(high) GDP growth conditions in driving entrepreneurial activity."
Together, these studies suggest that this two-step mechanism may make
space as a frontier particularly relevant in an era of secular
stagnation.

Aside from its potential to increase productivity growth, [**spa**ce is
uniquely capable of addressing a second driver of secular stagnation:
declining population growth rates.]{.underline} Among others, Tyler
Cowen (5, 31) has argued that declining population growth is both a
symptom and cause of economic and cultural stagnation in high-income
countries. And the data are striking. According to the OECD, all seven
members of the G7 group of high income countries had fertility rates
greater than 2.0 in 1970, while none of them exceeded 2.0 in 2020, and
the average of the seven countries' fertility rates dropped more than
one-third, from 2.33 to 1.51, over this half-century. This dramatic
shift---from above to below replacement levels---portends a long-term
transition to low population growth as more of Earth's nations reach the
**[standard of living]{.underline}** of today's high-income countries.

Space has a unique potential to encourage population growth, but not by
relaxing constraints on [**land** or **resources**]{.underline}; after
all, it is not primarily for those reasons that fertility rates are
declining on Earth. Rather, the expansion of economic activity in space
would, though perhaps not for some time, include the
**[creat]{.underline}**ion of [**new worlds** with their own robust
populations (32) and new technologies to sustain them (which, ideally,
will also increase the sustainability of life on Earth). Increased
investment in the technologies to enable **space
settlement**]{.underline} would therefore be consistent with the
analysis of Jones (33), who has shown formally how the benefit of
further growth in consumption may decline enough in high-income
countries that their priorities shift toward [**lowe**ring the risks of
**civilizational disaster.** The possibility that space
settle**ments**]{.underline} could eventually drive humanity's
population growth may sound outlandish, but it took more than 250 y from
the first British settlement of what became the United States for the
latter's population to exceed that of the United Kingdom; at 25 y, we
are only one-tenth as far from when the first permanent habitation in
space began aboard the International Space Station.

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [Russia, and China
are]{.underline} the primary nations [competing for control of the
Arctic's resources. Parties to the United Nations Convention for the Law
of the Sea are entitled to resources that are within 370 kilometers of
their shorelines, but most of the natural gas resources in the Arctic
are beyond these legal borders. This distance creates a **scramble to
control** these resources that goes **beyond the influence of
international organizations**]{.underline}, stimulating further
intra-nation conflict. As such, [**even nations that are far away** from
the Arctic are beginning to involve themselves in its
affairs]{.underline}, such as China, whose interests lie in the
resources that the Arctic holds rather than the land itself. [China has
few]{.underline} domestic [energy resources]{.underline} with most of
its energy consumption reliant on foreign imports from the Middle East,
the United States, and Russia, [which drives its ambition to **tap
Arctic natural gas** to secure energy independence. China's Arctic
ambitions lay beyond merely energy however, as they have recently
expanded their plans to take advantage of the nation's
resources]{.underline} in the state of legal confusion.

[The Chinese Government has dubbed their involvement in the Arctic
region as the "Polar Silk Road," which is an allusion to the trade
routes that they intend on pursuing following the **acquisition of
natural resources**]{.underline}. China's legal claim to the region
differs from many other nations due to their lack of a land border to
the Arctic, complicating their efforts. Chinese companies such as
Shenghe Resources, China Nuclear Hua Sheng Mining, China National
Petroleum Corp., and China National Offshore Oil Corporation have
attempted to expand their mining projects in the region, but have found
bureaucratic barriers and political opposition coming from the Danish,
who control Greenland. Furthermore, China is outnumbered by its primary
competitors, the United States and Russia, who have been operating in
the region for far longer and have more experience in resource
extraction. China's one icebreaker, known as "The Xuelong 2" or "The
Snow Dragon 2", pales in comparison to the United States' five
icebreakers and Russia's 51 icebreakers. The recent construction of "The
Xuelong 2" has motivated the United States to ramp up production of
icebreakers, including a plan to launch three more by 2029. [The
icebreakers are representative of the larger cat-and-mouse game that is
emerging by the three nations, in which they attempt to pre-empt the
other two countries and respond in kind to an **opposing nation's
expansion in the region**]{.underline}.

**[Feminism]{.underline}**

**Capitalism has empirically supported women and minorities by promoting
individualism, providing a way to escape structures of social
injustice.**

One thinks capitalism is the answer; the other socialism. Their
differences boil down to two points: [how capitalism has affected women
to date]{.underline}, and the viability of alternative systems to
improve a woman's lot.

The professors may disagree --- yet the [data sides **overwhelmingly
with capitalism**]{.underline}.

[When it comes to material living standards]{.underline}, Cudd presents
page after page of evidence to demonstrate "that
[capitalism]{.underline} has [brought]{.underline} about [**a massive
improvement** in life for human]{.underline} being[s]{.underline}" by
reducing poverty and spurring technological innovations in, for example,
healthcare. [Death in infancy or childbirth is much rarer that it once
was]{.underline}. Family sizes are smaller, since children generally
survive into adulthood. [And **women's options have multiplied** as a
result]{.underline}. Holmstrom, however, claims that capitalism has
lessened women's material well-being; it has, she says, exacerbated
inequality, which she conflates with poverty. Cudd counters that those
who care about women's welfare should focus on poverty, which is at a
historic low. Yet Holmstrom does not want to count any past socialist
system as truly socialist --- which in turn shows her bias. But giving
women the freedom to flee rural penury in order to work in factories,
counters Holmstrom, has made them worse off. "The lives of subsistence
peasants may be limited, but materially adequate and stable," she
writes. She thinks factory jobs "seldom provide a way out of poverty".

Cudd answers that the world's poorest people are overwhelmingly rural,
performing informal subsistence agricultural labour: "Global capitalism
has not changed their lives very much; they live much as their ancestors
did."

[As the data shows, factory work has, indeed, **helped women escape**
both **poverty** and the stricter **gender roles** of rural
areas]{.underline}. And while Holmstrom implies that the world's poor
prefer agricultural drudgery to urban work, the ongoing global migration
from rural areas to cities provides evidence to the contrary.

[Capitalism]{.underline}, says Cudd, [has not just liberated women from
the fields **but helped society to see them as
individuals**]{.underline}. [It promotes]{.underline} not only material
progress, but also [social innovation, which]{.underline} has helped
**[break down]{.underline}** those old [prejudices such as
sexism]{.underline}. "Capitalism derives its primary justification from
the maximisation of individual liberty," she says, "and capitalist
societies promulgate the ideology of individualism, which helps to break
down ... sexist norms and practices."

[Indeed, the capitalist worldview subverts sexism and other forms of
collective prejudice --- just look at how it eroded India's caste
system]{.underline}.

"[Capitalism **reduces the oppression** of traditional societies that
impose hierarchies of gender and caste]{.underline}," writes Cudd,
[because embedded within market exchange itself is the idea that each
individual should be free to pursue]{.underline} her
[self-interest]{.underline}. [Market participation also **increases
women's bargaining power** within society, empowering them to **lobby
for legal equality and greater freedom.**]{.underline}

1\. Introduction

A foundational question for ecological economics is how, and [under what
conditions, economies may prosper without growth]{.underline} (Jackson,
2008; Victor, 2008). Steady-state, post-growth or degrowth economists
may differ on details of their diagnoses. They mostly agree, however, on
the [policies]{.underline} they want to see: [caps, carbon and green
taxes,]{.underline} a basic and a maximum income, or working hour
reductions (Kallis, 2018). Such reforms, however, [would require a
**radical change** of the political and economic system]{.underline} if
they were to be implemented (Blawhof, 2012). A theory of
ecological-economic political change cannot but deal with the state, a
core force in social change (Wright, 2009). Yet [the literature on
alternatives to growth is **moot on the question of the
state.**]{.underline} The premise of this paper is that unless
ecological economists and advocates of
post-growth/**[degrowth]{.underline}** develop a theory of what the
state is, how it works and how it changes, their **[proposals speak to
the void.]{.underline}**

Take for example [Tim Jackson's (2008) 'Prosperity without
Growth']{.underline}, a most influential work that proved the
impossibility of addressing climate change if growth were to continue.
Jackson explains the failures of the current political system and offers
policy prescriptions like resource caps, green bonds or working time
limitations. Jackson however [**does not discuss** who and how will
bring such **radical green institutions**.]{.underline} He recognizes
that the neo-liberal state is an obstacle. He advocates a model of
governance that puts the public good first. His book, however, started
as a report written for the UK government. Like other policy advice it
appeals with reason to enlightened policy makers who are supposed to
serve the public. What if though, as Jackson recognizes, [the state
machinery is not neutral but part and parcel of the pursuit of economic
growth]{.underline}? How could change in a post-growth direction come
about?

Likewise, Herman Daly's steady state economics is the most comprehensive
and consistent policy framework developed by an ecological economist.
But when in a recent interview, the interviewer asks Daly 'how a
historical transformation would take place', he responds with 'an appeal
to morality' because 'purpose is causative in the world.' [Purpose is

Geopolitics amid climate change

As climate activist Greta Thunberg likes to remind her audiences, when
the house is on fire, you stop whatever you are doing and focus on
extinguishing. The message is that in our climate emergency all other,
petty concerns must be set aside. Applied to international relations,
this aspirational thinking has some believing that climate change will
imply the end of conflictual geopolitics.44 There are practical reasons
why this type of thinking might have gathered momentum. After all, much
of the world's recent conflict history, including war after war in the
Middle East in the 1990s and early 2000s, was driven in large part by
issues related to petroleum. [It might seem logical that once economies,
as part of their climate mitigation efforts, switch to
renewables]{.underline} like solar and wind, [conflictual international
relations will become a thing of the past. Unfortunately, that change
is]{.underline} **[very unlikely to represent the end of
geopolitics]{.underline}**.45

[First]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} overall **[premise is
wrong]{.underline}**, as [oil and gas]{.underline} **[will not
disappear]{.underline}** any time soon. [Rather, we will observe
a]{.underline} **[gradual shift]{.underline}** [in the energy mix
from]{.underline} **[traditional]{.underline}** energy sources
[toward]{.underline} **[renewables]{.underline}**.46 [An effort to
**fast-track**]{.underline} [the demise of]{.underline} highly polluting
**[coal]{.underline}**, while renewable capacity is still building up,
[might]{.underline} initially [lead to a]{.underline} counterintuitive
[increase in]{.underline} the use of **[methane]{.underline}** ---which
is, at least for Europe, another source of conflictual geopolitical
relations, in its case with Russia.

[Second]{.underline}, as discussed in The New Map by energy expert and
Pulitzer Prize winner Daniel Yergin, [we are by]{.underline} **[no
means]{.underline}** [close to]{.underline} seeing [the]{.underline}
**[end of geopolitics]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[power
politics]{.underline}** in the world. Specifically in the realm of
energy, **[new materials]{.underline}** [such as]{.underline}
**[r]{.underline}**are-**[e]{.underline}**arth
**[m]{.underline}**etal**[s]{.underline}** [will become focal points of
contention]{.underline}. Because these minerals are key inputs to the
construction of wind turbines and electric cars, and will become
fundamental to our technology, varying levels of access to them will
reshape the world order and create new imperatives to ensure the safety
of supplies.47 [Military strategies and foreign policy priorities will
be **reoriented**]{.underline} [toward]{.underline}
**[that]{.underline}** [goal]{.underline}, just as attention has been
focused over the past decades on securing oil supply bottlenecks like
the Strait of Hormuz and the Strait of Malacca.48 Indeed, we can already
get a sense of this, as the European Union has published, and regularly
updates, a list of what it calls "critical raw materials," necessary to
ensure a strong industrial base to the European economy. The US
administration did the same, identifying thirty-five critical minerals.
For example, cobalt is featured on both lists, as a fundamental mineral
in low-carbon technologies like electric vehicles and batteries,
including those used every day in smartphones and laptops. Responsible
for almost 60 percent of the world's known reserves and 97 percent of
global exports of cobalt is the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
suggesting that this country will increasingly enter the spotlight of
global power politics.49

[Any predictions about geoeconomics must also acknowledge that **climate
change**]{.underline} [is]{.underline} [**not the only megatrend at
play**; it overlaps with **others**, including]{.underline}
digitalization, **[automation]{.underline}**, **[quantum
computing]{.underline}**, **[a]{.underline}**rtificial
**[i]{.underline}**ntelligence, [and]{.underline} [**big data**, all of
which exhibit]{.underline} **[important winner-take-all
effects]{.underline}**, and in all of which countries will compete. [A
hugely]{.underline} **[important]{.underline}** [megatrend is the rise
of]{.underline} **[China]{.underline}** and the re-dimensioning of the
United States after roughly a century of global economic and political
dominance.50 [To]{.underline} the relative
**["optimists,"]{.underline}** like political economist Dani Rodrik,
[the relationship]{.underline} between China and the United States
[could]{.underline} **[evolve]{.underline}** [into a]{.underline}
**[milder]{.underline}**, second Cold War or **[mutual
recognition]{.underline}** of existence and differences---an us and them
dynamic within a framework of continued reciprocal trade and investment.
[To the less optimistic, as the global center of economic gravity
**shifts**]{.underline} eastward, [the risk of]{.underline}
**[escalation]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} more **[open confrontation
between superpowers]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}
**[high]{.underline}**.

In his 2017 book Destined for War, historian Graham Allison turned his
attention to what he called the Thucydides trap.51 Analyzing the
Peloponnesian War that devastated ancient Greece, the Athenian historian
Thucydides concluded that "it was the rise of Athens and the fear that
this instilled in Sparta that made war inevitable." [How will the rise
of]{.underline} [a]{.underline} **[new superpower]{.underline}** [play
out in the]{.underline} **[twenty-first century?]{.underline}** [Allison
reviews]{.underline} **[sixteen instances]{.underline}** [of swaps in
economic supremacy]{.underline} between countries over the past five
hundred years [and paints a grim picture:]{.underline} **[war broke out
in twelve]{.underline}** of them. This does not imply that war is
inevitable, but suggests [the Sino-American relationship will shape
geopolitics in **decades to come**. Climate mitigation and international
cooperation will play out against a]{.underline}
**[backdrop]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} **[rising geopolitical
tension]{.underline}** between at least two superpowers, which will
inevitably push other countries to pick sides.

The politics of degrowth

[The]{.underline} **[degrowth]{.underline}** international [vision to
tackle climate change **centers**]{.underline} [on the proposition
that]{.underline} **[wealthy countries]{.underline}**, who have more
than enough, [will]{.underline} **[shrink]{.underline}** their
economies. [By doing so, they will bring down]{.underline} greenhouse
gas [emissions]{.underline}, reducing the risk of catastrophic climate
change. [And]{.underline} they [will do so to such an extent that space
will be]{.underline} **[opened]{.underline}** up [for]{.underline}
**[poorer countries]{.underline}** [to develop]{.underline}, while the
overall world economy and global emissions remain within safe limits.

[From a strictly moral standpoint, this might]{.underline} **[sound
reasonable]{.underline}** and desirable. In light of what we have seen
up to now, [however, we can]{.underline} **[state
categorically]{.underline}** [that there is]{.underline} **[no scenario
under which a small set of countries willingly makes such an act of
self-sacrifice]{.underline}** for the global common good.52 [While
people are]{.underline} **[primed for altruism]{.underline}** and
self-sacrifices, [these are directed]{.underline} first [toward
their]{.underline} **[in-group]{.underline}**, and only later toward
others, [following]{.underline} [**geographical discounting**.
Democratic governments are bound by their **citizens'
preferences**]{.underline}, and therefore these basic human tendencies
define the set of policies that can be considered feasible. Naturally,
citizens of a country constitute only one type of in-group. Groups can
also arise based on shared culture, kinship, language, religion,
geography, and other affinities, as emphasized by Amartya Sen in
Identity and Violence.53 Humanity as a whole, however, cannot act as an
in-group in the absence of an out-group, and this will not change in the
face of climate change.

[The **fond hope**]{.underline} [that some countries will]{.underline}
**[actively shrink]{.underline}** their economies
**[ignores]{.underline}** [the reality that these rich
countries]{.underline} **[themselves]{.underline}** will [remain in
conditions of]{.underline} **[relative scarcity]{.underline}**, which
will [only]{.underline} be [felt]{.underline} **[more
acutely]{.underline}** [as climate change]{.underline}
**[unleashes]{.underline}** its [**negative effects**. This implies that
the in-group will be in constant need of]{.underline} **[extra
resources]{.underline}**, to tackle the needs of the moment, which can
be addressing incipient desertification, building infrastructure to
prevent flooding, and the like.

In addition, [countries]{.underline} themselves, as we have seen,
[experience]{.underline} **[relative income theory]{.underline}**, and
will constantly compare themselves to the past and to other countries.
[While China's economy]{.underline} [**expands at a high clip**,
you]{.underline} **[cannot expect the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [to]{.underline} [**look on with
indifference**. This is not only based on]{.underline}
**[vague]{.underline}** predicaments like "perceptions," or **[sinful
feelings]{.underline}** like envy, [but]{.underline} also on **[hard
realities]{.underline}**, [like the fact that]{.underline}
**[economic]{.underline}** [might goes hand in hand with]{.underline}
**[military spending]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} therefore
international [**political influence**. This]{.underline}, as we have
seen before, [generates a]{.underline} sort of **[geopolitical growth
imperative]{.underline}**. Reduced resources imply less capacity to
protect (or project) a value system, paving the way to reduced
self-determination as a people.54

[The idea]{.underline}, moreover, [that if **rich**]{.underline}
[countries]{.underline} **[shrink]{.underline}** **[poor]{.underline}**
[countries can]{.underline} **[expand]{.underline}** [is based
on]{.underline} an **[incomplete understanding]{.underline}** [of
the]{.underline} **[economics of development]{.underline}**. In 2008, a
group of nineteen leading policymakers, mostly from developing
economies, headed by two economics Nobel laureates, put together The
Growth Report, analyzing the experience of thirteen countries that had
managed to sustain high GDP growth since the 1950s. 55 [Drawing
on]{.underline} the input of over three hundred distinguished academics,
on top of the personal hands-on experiences of the policymakers, the
report sifted out common traits among successful cases. These thirteen
[cases of]{.underline} **["miracle"]{.underline}**
[development]{.underline}, all of which featured sharp reductions in
extreme poverty, included China, postwar Japan, South Korea, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Brazil, and Taiwan---and [a critical feature of]{.underline}
**[literally all]{.underline}** of them [was]{.underline} fast
**[expansion of exports]{.underline}**.56 Note, however, that most
exports go [to]{.underline} **[foreign lands]{.underline}** [that
feature]{.underline} **[consumption aplenty]{.underline}**---that is,
the rich, growing, industrialized countries.

[To recognize this is to see the **flaw in the logic**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} rich countries having to shrink to open up space for
poor countries to grow. The whole idea is based on a
**[misreading]{.underline}** of [the]{.underline} global [economy
as]{.underline} a **[zero-sum]{.underline}** game. Pursuing a degrowth
agenda in the developed world would bring about a collapse of global
trade, closing the door to any hope of fast growth in poor countries,
turning economic miracles into mirages, and forcing millions to remain
in extreme poverty. 57

#### No support to reform the system

**Lynch '19** \[Conor; June 12; He was published in Salon, The
Huffington Post, and Alternet; The New Republic, \"The left\'s failure
to envision a world without capitalism\"\]
https://newrepublic.com/article/154186/bernie-sanders-democratic-socialist-failure-envision-world-without-capitalism

There is a common saying on the left, usually attributed to the Marxist
critic Fredric Jameson, that "it is easier to imagine the end of the
world than it is to imagine the end of capitalism." [The late writer
Mark Fisher once described this as "capitalist realism," or the
"widespread sense that not only is **capitalism** the **only viable
political and economic system**, but also that it is now **impossible
even to imagine a coherent alternative to it**." This sense has
prevailed since the collapse of communism three decades ago, which led
to a triumphalism throughout the capitalist world right up until the
2008 financial crisis and ensuing global recession, which triggered
different anti-capitalist movements. But in the ten years since then, a
true political and economic alternative has yet to materialize. Though
many now believe that capitalism should end, this **doesn't make it**
any more **likely**---not **even if Senator Bernie Sanders becomes
president**.]{.underline} The Vermont senator made that clear with a
speech on Wednesday whose very title proves the limits of his
revolution: "How Democratic Socialism Is the Only Way to Defeat
Oligarchy." He did not denounce capitalism itself, but "unfettered
capitalism" specifically, and even used "socialism" as a sort of
epithet. "Let us never forget the unbelievable hypocrisy of Wall Street,
the high priests of unfettered capitalism," he said. "In 2008, after
their greed, recklessness, and illegal behavior created the worst
financial disaster since the Great Depression---with millions of
Americans losing their jobs, losing their homes, losing their life
savings---Wall Street's religious adherence to unfettered capitalism
suddenly came to an end. Overnight, Wall Street became big government
socialists and begged for the largest federal bailout in American
history." Sanders' hesitance to go any further may come as a
disappointment to many on the far left today, but it's not surprising
given recent history. One of the first major signs of a socialist
resurgence was the outbreak of Occupy Wall Street back in 2011. Though
decentralized and leaderless, it was perhaps the biggest anti-capitalist
movement since "the end of history" was declared 20 years earlier.
[While the movement spread globally and the "occupations" lasted for
months, it didn't produce any coherent vision of what was to replace
capitalism. At the time, Slovenian philosopher Slavoj Žižek commented
that the Occupy movement recalled Herman Melville's famous short story
about the law clerk Bartleby: "The message of Occupy Wall Street is 'I
would prefer not to play the existing \[capitalist\] game.'\... Beyond
this they don't have an answer." A few years after Occupy, Thomas
Piketty published his book Capital in the Twenty-First Century, which
became one of the best-selling academic works of all time and prompted
an international debate about inequality. Though centrist and right-wing
critics labeled Piketty a "modern Marx," the French economist was hardly
calling for an end to capitalism or promoting some grand theory of
capital. With an impressive slew of data, Piketty confirmed what those
on the left had long known: that extreme inequality and the
concentration of wealth is a natural outcome of capitalism.]{.underline}
Unlike Marx, however, Piketty didn't even attempt to imagine a radical
alternative to the system of capitalism. (His prescription was
ultimately a global wealth tax, which manages to be both underwhelming
and unrealistic.) A year after Capital was published in English Sanders
launched his 2016 presidential run, which became another important
display of the growing anti-capitalist mood that had spread since the
financial crisis. Sanders openly identified as a "democratic
socialist"---a radical gesture in itself---and provided an alternative
to the "progressive neoliberalism" that had come to dominate the
Democratic Party since the nineties. (I borrow this term from Nancy
Fraser to describe an alliance between emancipatory movements such as
feminism and anti-racism with "neoliberal forces aiming to financialize
the capitalist economy," who, according to Fraser, use the "charisma of
their progressive allies to spread a veneer of emancipation over their
own regressive project of massive upward redistribution.") Though
Sanders reintroduced class politics to the debate and inspired a
generation of young people to embrace the socialist label, he was
ultimately offering an upgraded version of New Deal liberalism rather
than a true socialist alternative to capitalism. The fact that his most
"radical" policy---public universal healthcare---has been the status quo
in European countries like the United Kingdom since the mid-twentieth
century was telling enough. As many commentators noted at the time,
Sanders was less a democratic socialist in the tradition of Eugene Debs
than he was a social democrat in the tradition of Franklin Roosevelt.
Sanders is now embracing that comparison. His speech on Wednesday was an
effective love letter to FDR (with no mention of Debs). He called for
the Democratic Party to take up the "unfinished business of the New
Deal," and proposed a twenty-first-century version of the FDR's
"economic bill of rights." Though the senator continues to call himself
a democratic socialist, his vague definition of socialism is still
closer to the social democracy that FDR ushered in[. According to
Sanders, democratic socialism is the belief that "economic rights are
human rights," which means the right to a living wage, quality
healthcare, education, affordable housing, and a secure retirement; it
means "requiring and achieving political and economic freedom in every
community in this country," he said. These are all worthy and important
goals, but only right-wing critics would honestly call this
socialism]{.underline}. In the three years since Sanders lost his
primary bid, more and more Americans share his view, loosely speaking.
According to a survey released by Axios just this week, four in ten
respondents would prefer to live in a socialist country over a
capitalist one, and 55 percent of women between 18 and 54 reject
capitalism. That would seem to work in Sanders's favor, but the size of
the primary field has not. He does not have a sole establishment
candidate to contrast himself with, and moreover, many of his
competitors have embraced much of his agenda---albeit without the
confrontational class-politics that defined his first campaign. Sanders
is still the only candidate who is remotely anti-capitalist, and the
only candidate who calls himself a socialist. But his policies aren't
quite as unique as they were in 2016. [Though no doubt "radical" in the
American setting, Sanders' economic agenda would be considered
center-left in the rest of the developed world, and in practical terms
there's not much separating him from Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has
insisted that she is "capitalist to \[her\] bones."]{.underline} There's
a degree of nostalgia for mid-twentieth century social democracy among
today's leading leftists, who long for the days when income taxes were
high, unions were strong, and reformist policies found a middle ground
between the extremes of "socialism" and "capitalism." Commonly referred
to as the "golden age" of capitalism, the postwar era saw a reduction in
inequality, growth in wages and living standards, and increased social
mobility. This was all made possible---in part---by the policies
implemented by New Dealers in America and Social Democrats in Western
Europe. There is a real problem with trying to emulate the social
democratic policies of the twentieth century today, however, and it's
not clear whether the middle-of-the-road approach is still viable in the
twenty-first century. [We live in a far more globalized world than we
did 75 years ago. Capital is more flexible and mobile than ever before
and the rapid economic growth experienced during the postwar era is
unlikely to be repeated, which makes national welfare states harder to
sustain. In Capital, Piketty provided ample evidence that the trends
during the mid-twentieth century were historically anomalous, and that
today's extreme inequality is a return to the norm. "A concentration of
circumstances (wartime destruction, progressive tax policies made
possible by the shocks of 1914-1945, and exceptional growth during the
three decades following the end of World War II),"]{.underline} he
wrote, "created a historically unprecedented situation which lasted for
nearly a century. All signs are, however, that it is about to end." He
added, "Broadly speaking, it was the wars of the twentieth century that
wiped away the past to create the illusion that capitalism had been
structurally transformed." Social democratic policies were originally
designed to "save capitalism from itself." Like Marx, John Maynard
Keynes recognized the inherent instability of capitalism, but unlike the
German revolutionary, he believed the system's contradictions could be
limited and its tensions mediated through state intervention---in other
words, that the system was reformable. [When Keynes was alive, it was
still possible to imagine the end of capitalism (indeed, it was
impossible not to), and the British economist devoted his life's work to
preserving the system]{.underline}. [Today, even if you aren't
"capitalist to your bones" and believe that capitalism is
"irredeemable," as Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez does, it's
nearly impossible to imagine the end of (or at least a viable
alternative replacing it). It's even difficult to imagine a return to
the capitalism of the mid-twentieth century. Sanders is an
anti-capitalist at heart---otherwise he wouldn't call himself a
socialist---but we continue to live in an age where it is easier to
imagine the end of the world than the end of capitalism]{.underline}
(and with climate change and other ecological disasters threatening
humanity, it doesn't take H. G. Wells to imagine the end of the world
these days). The question for today's left seems to be whether the
ultimate goal is to reform or to replace capitalism---and if the latter
is indeed the goal, then what will a post-capitalist world actually look
like? If Sanders wants to set himself apart from a candidate like
Warren, he can start by giving these questions serious thought, and go
beyond a simple critique of what he calls "unfettered capitalism."

#### Transition [fails]{.underline} and locks in [wars]{.underline}. 

**Smith \'19** \[Noah; 4/5/19; Bloomberg Opinion columnist, former
assistant professor of finance at Stony Brook University; \"Dumping
Capitalism Won't Save the Planet,\"
https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-04-05/capitalism-is-more-likely-to-limit-climate-change-than-socialism\]

The climate threat is certainly dire, and carbon taxes are unlikely to
be enough to solve the problem. But eco-socialism is probably not going
to be an effective method of addressing that threat. [Dismantling an
**entire economic system** is never easy, and probably would touch off
**armed conflict** and major upheaval]{.underline}. In the scramble [to
win those battles, even the socialists would almost certainly abandon
their limitation on fossil-fuel use --- either to support military
efforts, or to keep the population from turning against
them]{.underline}. The precedent here is [the Soviet Union, whose
multidecade effort to reshape its economy by force amid confrontation
with the West led to profound **environmental
degradation**.]{.underline} The world\'s climate does not have several
decades to spare.

[Even without international conflict, there's little guarantee that
moving away from capitalism would mitigate our impact on the
environment. Since socialist leader Evo Morales took power in Bolivia,
living standards have improved]{.underline} substantially for the
average Bolivian, which is great. But [this has come at the cost of
higher emissions]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [the capitalist U.S managed to
decrease its per capita emissions a bit during this same
period]{.underline} (though since the U.S. is a rich country, its
absolute level of emissions is much higher).

In other words, in terms of economic growth and carbon emissions,
[Bolivia looks similar to more **capitalist developing
countries**]{.underline}. That suggests that [faced with a choice of
enriching their people or helping to save the climate, even socialist
leaders will often **choose the former**]{.underline}. And [that same
political calculus will probably **hold in China and the U.S**., the
world's top carbon emitters --- leaders who demand draconian **cuts in
living standards** in pursuit of environmental goals will have **trouble
staying in power**.]{.underline}

#### Degrowth causes transition wars[.]{.underline}

**Albert, 23**---Lecturer in International Relations, SOAS, University
of London (Michael, "Ecosocialism for Realists: Transitions, Trade-Offs,
and Authoritarian Dangers," Capitalism Nature Socialism, 34:1, 11-30,

The scenario sketched above highlights that ecosocialist degrowth
[transitions would most likely occur in a context of **deepening
political-economic crisis**]{.underline}, intensifying climate shocks,
and worsening insecurity for the majority of populations. A key danger,
then, is that [even in the **best-case scenario** in which]{.underline}
powerful red-green [movements **decisively shift** the balance of
power]{.underline} vis-à-vis capital and elect leftist parties following
ecosocialist platforms, [this could lead to]{.underline}
"**[authoritarian]{.underline}**" forms of ecosocialism, understood as
ecosocialist [regimes that institutionalize]{.underline} "**[state of
emergency]{.underline}**" [provisions such as unchecked executive
power]{.underline}, [the suspension of democratic rights and
procedures]{.underline}, [restrictions on free speech]{.underline}, [and
military-police repression of dissent]{.underline} (Petras and
Fitzgerald Citation1988). [This has]{.underline} of course [been one of
the primary challenges confronting **all socialist transitions
historically**]{.underline}, [which have had to fight off external
military intervention]{.underline}, [resistance from capitalist
elites]{.underline}, [and reactionary currents from below in order to
protect revolutionary gains]{.underline}. [Things would be **no
different** for future ecosocialisms-in-transition]{.underline},
particularly [given the likely contradiction between the **speed** at
which]{.underline} consumption [cuts may need to be made]{.underline} in
the global north [and the **slowness** with which]{.underline}
post-materialist [cultural change would occur]{.underline}, yet such
problems have not been systematically explored by ecosocialists and
degrowth scholars. [The risks are]{.underline} twofold: first, [that
authoritarian measures would be needed to **enforce lifestyle changes**
upon recalcitrant populations]{.underline} and "deal with the
exceptional circumstances of direct and serious threat" to the survival
of ecosocialist regimes in their early phases; [and]{.underline} second,
that such measures, rather than being temporally limited and abolished
once the "exceptional circumstances" are dealt with, [become the **new
normal**]{.underline} (94).

Quincy Saul and Andreas Malm are among the few ecosocialists who don't
shy away from this problem. Saul, for one, writes that "a period of
'emergency rule,' when the expropriators are expropriated, must be
revised for the twenty-first century, it cannot be dismissed or glossed
over" (Saul Citation2011, 58--59). Similarly, Malm suggests that
carrying out the transition in the needed time frame would require.

warlike state management of all industries ... centralized decisions on
who can consume what goods in what amounts, \[and\] punishment of
transgressors threatening the annual emissions targets ... \[which\] can
only be feasible under an exceptional regime dealing with an unheard-of
emergency (Malm Citation2015, 187)

The risk, in other words, is that ecosocialist [regimes]{.underline}
that are democratically elected in a context of unprecedented
climate-energy-economic crises [may be **forced** down an authoritarian
path in order to enforce carbon rationing]{.underline}, [enact rapid and
far-reaching transformations in land-use]{.underline}, [break through
the gridlock of dysfunctional and polarized legislatures]{.underline},
[and defend themselves against violence and sabotage from capitalist
elites and the far-right]{.underline}. [The danger is **exacerbated** by
the fact that worsening climate and political-economic
crises]{.underline}, [far from **neutralizing** the threat of rightwing
populism]{.underline}, [will most likely **intensify** ethnonationalist
reaction and political polarization]{.underline}. As Malm and the Zetkin
Collective explain: "the higher the temperatures, the more acute the
antagonism between a left that alone stands ready to pick up the
instruments for alleviating the crisis and a right that, for that very
reason, refuses to contemplate it" (Malm and Collective Citation2021,
286--287). Additionally, [given that]{.underline} ecosocialist
[transitions would entail a]{.underline} "**[life-threatening
situation]{.underline}**" [for]{.underline} most if not all sectors of
[the capitalist class]{.underline}, [many]{.underline} of them [would
likely **ally with the far-right** in order to halt such transitions in
their tracks and restore capitalist power]{.underline} "**[by any means
necessary]{.underline}**" (241). Thus [even]{.underline} in [the
**best-case scenario**]{.underline} in which ecosocialists are able to
assume power in core states, this [would **almost certainly** occur in a
context of **rabid far-right resistance** in alliance with global
capital]{.underline}. The risks are particularly acute in, but not
limited to, the US, where the spectacle of armed insurrectionists
storming congress to try overthrowing the 2020 presidential election
give us a taste of what

ecosocialists are up against.

### AT: Degrowth

#### Degrowth is framed as an obligation, not as an intrinsically preferrable alternative

Convivial Alternative. Environmental Values, 28(2),

[Insofar as development implies economic growth, the term 'sustainable
development' appears to some as a contradiction in terms.]{.underline}
However, such conclusions still lack a thorough examination of the
conceptual structure of the two terms between which there is a purported
contradiction. In order to address this issue, the present paper
scrutinizes [some of the assumptions which underwrite the ideologies of
sustainability and of development]{.underline}. It is argued that there
are key assumptions which both ideas have in common, and that
sustainable development is thus perfectly coherent on a conceptual
level. [It is **alternatives which retain either term (such as
'sustainable degrowth'**]{.underline}) [that **are embroiled in
paradox**.]{.underline} The paper then examines two concepts for
criticizing the ideology of economic growth in other terms: dépense and
conviviality. It is argued that the latter is preferable to the former
for the purpose of developing post-sustainable critiques of growth.

When sustainability becomes the central reference for critiques of
processes of growth -- [when it is argued that we need to de-grow in
order to be sustainable -- then **the transition to an economy beyond
growth comes to appear an unpalatable sacrifice**, which is nevertheless
necessary if life is to go on.]{.underline} While the hegemony of growth
is maintained by many means (e.g., Koch,2018), [one important part is
surely played by **framing alternatives to it as if they were
obligations** rather than **intrinsically preferable
possibilities**.]{.underline} And while the ideology of growth can
likewise be criticized by many means, a scrutiny of concepts will surely
play a part in undoing existing closures of the imagination.

Whether as moral exhortations directed at individuals or as injunctions
to-wards systemic change, a prime target for the imperative of
sustainability has long been consumption. Hence, Our Common Future
insists on the necessity of implementing 'consumption standards that are
within the bounds of the eco-logical possible' (WCED, 1987: 44).
Simultaneously, a belief that people in general are unwilling to
voluntarily reduce their consumption lead many to regard such change as
unrealistic (see Maniates and Meyer, 2010). But what does it really mean
to call something an act of consumption?

How then about the issue of consumption? [To recognize economic growth
as a problem for sustainability might lead to calls for voluntary
simplicity and degrowth as a solution.]{.underline} One might then (for
instance) seek to solve this problem by demonstrating to people that
their patterns of consumption (which this growth enables) are
unsustainable. [Conceiving of the same issue as a paradox, by contrast,
would mean to understand the problematic behavior (consumption) as
co-constituted with the goal (sustainability) for which it is a
problem]{.underline}. That is, the aim of sustainability (survival) is
here regarded as something which has become an aim for the same reasons
that encourage people to engage in acts of consumption.

#### Degrowth misdiagnoses the root cause of environmental problems.

First, [growth, whether economic growth or population growth, is not the
cause of climate change or other environmental challenges]{.underline}.
We have had many other environmental challenges in the past that we have
overcome, or largely overcome --- such as the hole in the ozone layer,
acid rain, lead pollution, and a great deal of air and water pollution
in the West --- and the solution to all of these did not come from
halting growth, but instead from new technologies and economic planning
in the form of regulation and technology policy. As recently as the
1980s, [the ozone layer challenge was perhaps an even greater
existential threat than climate change, for it threatened the very
ability of macroscopic life on land to exist.]{.underline} We didn't
solve that problem by halting growth in fridges, cans of hair spray, and
air conditioning units (and other machines and processes using the
chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, that contributed to ozone depletion), but
by regulating a transition away from the use of CFCs. Today, there are
far more fridges and cans of hair spray than ever before. [I would also
say that degrowth fundamentally misdiagnoses the cause of climate change
and as a result has a poor theory of change]{.underline}. As a science
journalist, I would also say that [degrowth fundamentally misdiagnoses
the cause of climate change, biodiversity loss, and other environmental
problems, and as a result has a poor theory of change (a strategy for
how the problem can be solved).]{.underline} Imagine a fully socialist
twentieth century. Socialists would argue that health care, education,
electricity, and industrialization would have been spread to the whole
of the world, and not restricted to the West. Prior to the discovery of
the full extent of the problem of global warming in the 1980s, socialist
societies would have mainly used fossil fuels to power all of this,
especially in those areas where the geography does not allow for
hydroelectricity. Socialists want their public hospitals to be able to
run 24/7 (and indeed many of their factories and other services
essential to social well-being). We don't want to wait for the sun to
shine or the wind to blow for the ventilators and dialysis machines to
be turned on. Indeed, the vast majority of greenhouse gas emissions
entered the atmosphere not since the Industrial Revolution, but since
the 1950s, what geosphere-biosphere scientists call "The Great
Acceleration." This is coincident with the advent of the welfare state
and the legalization and institutionalization of trade unions across
much of the West. Jonas [Elvander: So is there a benefit of socialism at
all with respect to climate change? Leigh Phillips: Absolutely:
socialism can in principle act much faster than markets. The reason for
this is fourfold. First, any market actor that produces a commodity that
is profitable but harmful to ecosystem services (such as coal, oil, or
gas) has an incentive to continue production. This in turn spurs
attempts by such companies to try and capture democratic decision-making
--- lobbying, bribes, corruption, and, as seen with Volkswagen, outright
criminal activity. Meanwhile, a publicly owned entity, so long as it is
properly insulated from market activity, can in principle just carry out
what the electorate demands. A publicly owned entity, so long as it is
properly insulated from market activity, can in principle just carry out
what the electorate demands. Second, there may be a range of goods or
services that are not profitable, but are beneficial to maintenance and
optimization of ecosystem services, and market actors have no incentive
to produce them. Examples here include clean energy infrastructure that
has high up-front capital costs, such as conventional nuclear
power, high-speed rail lines, or the substantial research, development,
and deployment costs of carbon-neutral fuels for hard-to-electrify
long-haul shipping and aviation. Again, a public actor is not restricted
by the need for profitability, but instead only by economic
capacity.]{.underline} This relates to the third problem: we may have
straightforward technological solutions to decarbonize many sectors
already (e.g. nuclear power and renewables for electricity), but there
are a lot of sectors that are socially beneficial yet really hard to
decarbonize. A great example here is cement. For these sectors, we will
need strong state-led innovation policy and industrial policy to de-risk
taking potential technologies from lab bench or pilot project through to
commercialization. And even for those sectors where we do have
straightforward solutions, in many cases the clean alternative is
currently still far too expensive, especially for developing countries,
and there is still a great need for industrial and innovation policy to
shepherd radical cost reductions in these technologies. Such policies
are another form of economic planning, rather than leaving these
questions to the market. Finally, while some environmental problems are
restricted to one or a few sectors --- and thus the technology-switching
doesn't involve much coordination across different sectors (e.g.
eliminating lead pollution primarily affected transport but few other
sectors) --- [in the case of climate change, fossil fuels are the
foundation of almost every sector, with a great many intertwined
dependencies. This is called a "coordination problem," and markets are
very bad at solving them. I also oppose degrowth because it demands a
stagnation or even reduction in the incomes of the Western working
class. A great example here is petroleum production.]{.underline} We
need to sunset petroleum production for combustion purposes sometime in
the next twenty to thirty years or so, while maintaining it for
non-combustion petrochemical purposes. But if we halted all production
tomorrow, society would collapse. So we need to be able to coordinate
sufficient production to maintain society even as we carefully wind down
production for combustion and continue sufficient production for
petrochemicals. All of this runs counter to how market actors operate,
and so at a minimum, the state needs to step in to supervise this
coordination, and at a maximum, the state may need to directly take over
such sectors[. I also oppose degrowth because it demands a stagnation or
even reduction in the incomes of the Western working class]{.underline}.
Degrowthers assert that workers in the Global North consume too much.
The reality is that most Western workers have suffered through more than
four decades of real wage stagnation (or even decline in some sectors),
deindustrialization, and growing inequality.

One of the world's leading experts on inequality, Branko Milanovic, has
done a rough calculation of what a radical redistribution of income ---
everyone in the world earning the same --- would mean. Each person would
earn just \$5,500 per year. While this would be a big increase in the
standard of living for many in the Global South, this would amount to a
sharp reduction in the standard of living for almost all workers in the
Global North. There simply isn't enough wealth in the world yet for
everyone to earn a decent income. We need so much more economic growth.
Marx saw the marvels of capitalism and the Industrial Revolution and
wondered how much farther humanity could go if production were not
restricted to the profit incentive. We would have so much more than
capitalism can produce! This is what he called "unfettering the forces
of production." Today, we can see what he meant concretely in many
sectors, not least in pharmaceuticals. [About four decades ago, large
pharmaceutical companies largely got out of the business of research and
development of new classes of antibiotics because they are
insufficiently profitable compared to drugs for chronic conditions that
have to be taken every day for the rest of someone's life]{.underline}.
[Here is a great example of how socialism would produce so much more. We
wouldn't need to make a profit in order to research and develop new
antibiotics]{.underline}. Jonas Elvander: Some critics argue that
eco-modernism falls into the same trap as green capitalism, i.e. the
belief that growth is possible in a world of finite resources. How would
you respond? Leigh Phillips: This assumes that there cannot be absolute
decoupling, yet we already see decoupling in many sectors thanks to
efficiency gains. A bit of clarification between relative and absolute
decoupling is needed here: relative decoupling is where there is a
reduction in the inputs per unit of production, but there is still
overall growth in inputs, while absolute decoupling is where a sector
has continued to grow without an increase in inputs. [The problem with
capitalism is not that it produces too much, but that it irrationally
limits production to what is profitable.]{.underline} We can see the
latter --- absolute decoupling --- in US crop production, for example,
which has increased even as agricultural inputs such as fertilizer,
water, and crop acreage have declined or plateaued, with the decline in
fertilizer use being particularly sharp. Corn acreage has been
absolutely decoupled from corn production. American potato yields
continue to increase, but the potato market is saturated, so potato
production has plateaued, meaning that land is removed from production.
US consumption of metals marched in lockstep with GDP until about the
1980s. Since then, consumption of important metals such as aluminum,
nickel, copper, steel, and gold have plateaued or declined. (This takes
into account imports and exports, so globalization and offshoring the
problem to the developing world is not the reason for this.) Many
degrowthers simply reject that absolute degrowth has happened, but this
is simply denial of the facts. Some degrowthers, to their credit, accept
that absolute degrowth is real but is happening too slowly and in not
enough sectors. To those degrowthers, I say: "I completely agree! That's
why [we need to focus on more economic planning and the policies
required to speed up absolute decoupling and forget about this degrowth
distraction!" If absolute decoupling is too slow to deal with climate
change, what makes them think that convincing all the electorates and
autocracies of the world that they need to abandon economic growth will
be any faster?]{.underline} Jonas Elvander: In what way does capitalist
growth differ from non- or anti-capitalist growth? Leigh Phillips:
[Capitalist growth is amoral and anarchic, largely outside of democratic
control, and produces inequality and servitude to bosses. Socialist
growth is democratically coordinated and by being so, delivers equality
and liberation from servitude. Socialist growth allows humanity to
"design history," to consciously decide where we want to go next, to
decide which new medicines and technologies will liberate us ever
further from drudgery, danger, and disease, instead of being led by the
nose by whatever happens to be profitable.]{.underline} Let us remember
that our degrees of freedom can be limited by other humans through
oppression, exploitation, and inequality, but also by the rest of
nature. Parkinson's Disease, cripplingly delimiting of freedom, is not
imposed upon its victims by other people, but by genetics. [New
medicines and technologies liberate us from such infringement of
freedom. But if any of those medicines or technologies of liberation are
not profitable, then they will not be produced, or at best be restricted
to those consumers who allow it to be profitable.]{.underline} The
problem with capitalism therefore is not that it produces too much, but
that it irrationally limits production to what is profitable.

#### Degrowth fails \-\-- corporations say no 

Toby **Bowes '25** (Toby Bowes,

https://sites.manchester.ac.uk/global-social-challenges/2025/01/16/less-is-more-is-degrowth-the-solution-to-climate-change/

[While asking whether degrowth would work on a global scale is an
important question, the arguably more important question is whether it
will even be attempted in the first place.]{.underline} [The decisions
on global issues, such as climate change, are no longer solely in the
hands of governments but also in the hands of corporations. Corporations
have been able to use their power to inhibit governmental
decision-making on climate change, both through the use of lobbying and
the threat of moving elsewhere]{.underline} (Bartley, 2018). This was
made clear at COP26, where there were at least 503 fossil fuel
lobbyists, more than any country's delegation at the event. [They do
this as improvements in the fight against global warming would hurt
their profits]{.underline}. If this power dynamic, with corporations
getting in the way of decisive action, continues, [it seems unlikely
that economic degrowth will be a feasible solution for the climate
crisis as it goes against the corporations' need for financial
success.]{.underline} If we are wanting to keep our home planet
inhabitable, we are going to need to make some substantial changes to
the way we live, degrowth or otherwise. While [economic degrowth may be
unlikely to happen due to the capitalistic need for continual
growth]{.underline}, we, as individuals, have a responsibility to
'degrow' our own consuming habits -- not only for ourselves, but for all
the generations that come after us.

### **[Alt Fails (Ecosocialism) -- 2AC]{.underline}**

#### Eco-socialism is the only solution to climate. Capitalism and its institutions fails to address it.

Climate change is nothing new. For decades now, the scientific community
has unanimously sounded the alarm on humanity's out-of-control
greenhouse gas production. Countless international conventions have been
organized, with the United Nations convening a conference on the topic
nearly every year since 1995, including the signing of several
supposedly-landmark treaties. Anyone under 30 today has lived with the
public [prospect of impending environmental catastrophe clouding their
future for their entire lives]{.underline}. In the past decade,
predictions of apocalyptic weather have given way to actual, ongoing
disasters that are clearly linked to climate change. [As heat waves kill
thousands each year in the most at-risk regions such as Pakistan, even
those living in relatively safe regions have faced the effects of
widespread air pollution from fires, and unprecedented, record-breaking
heat has now become a weekly, somehow mundane occurrence.]{.underline}
And yet, despite this openly-acknowledged, [worsening global crisis, we
are no closer to halting,]{.underline} let alone reversing, the damage
of climate change as the world remains poised to blast past the already
catastrophic threshold of 2°C average increases in temperatures
worldwide. **[The failure of climate change mitigation thus far has not
been a failure of science or technology, or even a failure to anticipate
the effects of climate change. Rather, the absence of effective
responses to climate change has been a political failure of capitalism
and its institutions]{.underline}**. The capitalist economic dogma of
leaving everything to the whims of the market places all the agency over
environmental policy in the hands of the ultra-rich, who in turn pursue
individualistic solutions that do nothing to stop the crisis, instead
only saving themselves in climate-proof mansions while leaving the rest
of the world to suffer the consequences. [International institutions
like the United Nations, which in theory should be leading the fight
against climate change, are powerless to intervene by
design,]{.underline} hamstrung by the prerogatives of the U.S.
government, among other imperialist states that benefit from the current
arrangement and which effectively control the UN's ability to pass
binding policy. Meanwhile[, efforts to tie environmental efforts to the
market, such as carbon offsets, are doomed to fail, as any change in the
economic situation that affects the profitability of fossil fuel
production, whether it's an international crisis like the Russian
invasion of Ukraine or simply the ongoing "improvement" of extraction
and refinement technologies that make fuels cheaper (but not cleaner) to
produce, has the ability to completely derail the impacts of
market-based policy]{.underline}. Instead of reducing and eventually
ending society's reliance on fossil fuels, [capitalism has created a
system of carbon indulgences, whereby companies can clear their
consciences (and greenwash their public image) by making token
contributions to sustainable development---all while fossil fuel
production and consumption continues uninhibited.]{.underline} We need
drastic reorganization of the economy on a global level in order to even
begin to mitigate the effects of climate change. [The existing
capitalist ruling class has already proven itself both unwilling and
incapable of addressing this challenge.]{.underline} Beating climate
change requires the transformation to a democratic economy that is
actually responsive to the needs of the working class globally. The
capitalist pipe dream of endless growth benefiting everyone is dead; the
constant growth that capitalism demands can only result in burning the
Earth to a crisp. [We need a rapid transition to sustainable,
non-polluting fuels, and to do it without sacrificing the living
conditions of workers who are currently employed in the fossil fuel
industry, providing them generous pensions and the opportunity to
transfer into new industries. This is a basic, moral necessity, and
entirely impossible within the capitalist economic system. It requires
socialism]{.underline}.The shift to socialism means more than just
demanding that governments (or individual capitalists) respond to the
crisis[---the core of this crisis is that these governments' and
capitalists' interests are diametrically opposed to the sustainable
economic policy that the majority of the world so desperately needs.
Winning a new climate policy, thus, requires a fundamental shift in the
economic balance of power; it requires everyday workers to get organized
and to take matters into their own hands, to organize mass
demonstrations to put our class into motion, and then to seize the
factories and energy infrastructure while organizing general strikes in
the cities. We need to build militant strike-ready unions, as well as a
revolutionary workers' party to tie together these battles and build a
democratic leadership committed to challenge the capitalists. **We must
refuse the capitalists' orders to burn the world as fuel and instead
turn our tools towards a new, sustainable future**]{.underline}. This
is, further, a fight for the fate of the whole world, which must be
fought internationally.This will not happen overnight, but rather
requires the hard work of building mass movements with clear political
demands. We need to build mass actions that can draw ever-growing layers
of people into this struggle: This coming Sept. 17, the March to End
Fossil Fuels, in New York City, will be just such an opportunity that we
should all support.Fighting for political change is a massive, difficult
endeavor. Nevertheless, it is the only remaining solution in the face of
capitalism's failure to lift a finger to save our planet. We have a
world to win, and nothing to lose but our chains.

The last chapter examining solutions is "Participatory Global Climate
Governance." Throughout the book, the authors have been rather coy as to
their views on the state. Here, this becomes a serious defect. There is
no concrete approach outlined, only vague hopes that social movements
outside the institutions of global power and democratization inside them
will somehow provide a way forward. This is admitted directly as a
subhead calls such governance "unlikely but possible." Sadly, this might
well have been a subtitle for the book as a whole.

Finally they try to put their solutions together in "Another Way Is
Possible." Here [the word "possible" has none of the boldness it did in
the early anti-globalization movement. The authors offer at best **a
vague hope** that some mixture of social democracy and "non-reformist
reforms" will **create enough of a space** to address climate
change]{.underline}.

The ideas put forward in Climate Change Solutions rely heavily on this
concept of non-reformist reforms. [Their goal is to directly undermine
the conditions of the capitalist system, because they cannot be
internalized. This explains why the authors adopt the degrowth concept,
worker cooperatives, and global governance **rather than**]{.underline}
an [**ecosocialism** based entirely on sustainably meeting human
needs.]{.underline}

[The problem is **that these are contradictory half-steps**, and yet
even those **seem impossibly distant** even in the most optimistic
cases.]{.underline} Repeatedly, Stuart, Gunderson, and Petersen
recognize that the [labor movements and radical consciousness their
solutions require **do not yet exist or have the required strength** to
implement them. This is frustrating in a book that claims to offer
solutions]{.underline} and even comes close to living social movements
when it talks about energy democracy and degrowth, [but]{.underline}
ultimately [can only proffer a vague hope that some other way might
happen]{.underline}.

Ecosocialists have made a far more revolutionary proposition --- system
change, not climate change. Trying to dig around the margins and in
dated New Left thinkers like Gorz and Marcuse for halfway steps will
never lead to the kind of radical movements that would be needed to
produce either result.

College students\' enthusiasm for Senator Bernie Sanders\'s \"democratic
socialism\" has been one of the most surprising and dispiriting events
of the presidential campaign. Apparently students have not learned that
[historically **all socialist systems**\--democratic and authoritarian
alike\--**failed to satisfy public demands** and were **abandoned after
much suffering.**]{.underline} Capitalism is the only economic system
that offers freedom, opportunity, and increased living standards to the
greatest numbers of people.

These students also must be unfamiliar with Friedrich Hayek\'s The Road
to Serfdom, a brilliant critique of the 1945 British decision to adopt
democratic socialism. Hayek insisted that socialism could not work. If
voters chose to elect a non-socialist government, the socialist economic
plan would be discarded. The alternative was an authoritarian government
that would prevent voters from rejecting the plan.

In the seventy years since the British decision, we have seen both
outcomes. Britain kept its democracy. Voters eventually elected Margaret
Thatcher in 1979. She transformed the economy, sold the socialized
industries, strengthened the market system, and enhanced freedom. Per
capita income and productivity rose. Socialists never forgave her for
achieving what they failed to achieve. Subsequently, Labour governments
returned to office, but they did not restore socialism. Socialism
failed.

Starting in the middle of the twentieth century, [Argentina
tried]{.underline} its own version of [socialism]{.underline}: Peronism.
Despite its rich supply of raw materials and productive agricultural
sector, Argentina under Peronism [suffered sluggish growth, high
inflation, and the loss of freedom.]{.underline} The November 2015
election ended Peronism. Unhappy voters elected a president who promised
to restore the market system, private property, and personal freedom.
[Socialism failed.]{.underline}

[Venezuela]{.underline} is an oil-rich country. The [socialist
gov]{.underline}ernment there [has]{.underline} expropriated most
industry and replaced professional managers with political friends who
lack both skills and knowledge. **[Inflation soar]{.underline}**ed and
recently rose to [more than 100 percent a year.]{.underline} [**Food
became scarce**, and **poverty increased** so much]{.underline} that the
[government stopped publishing]{.underline} the [data.]{.underline} A
privately produced estimate shows that the poverty rate is higher today
than it was when the United Socialist Party came to power seventeen
years ago. Policies designed to help the poor by redistributing income
hurt both rich and poor alike. After two decades of socialism, voters
recently elected a large antisocialist majority to their congress.
Socialism failed.

[**Socialism failed** also in Cuba]{.underline}, in the [former Soviet
Union]{.underline} and its satellites, [and in **every** other **place**
it has been tried.]{.underline} When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1989,
its satellites promptly abandoned socialism and joined the market
system. They understood from experience what US college students who
today cheer socialism have not learned. And they could see that the two
systems gave people different incentives. [Capitalism encouraged effort
and innovation. Socialism did not.]{.underline}

DISTORTED INCENTIVES

It is easy to add other examples of socialist failure. Examples of
success cannot be found because [no socialist country has brought both
growth and freedom.]{.underline} [Two]{.underline} of the [major
reasons]{.underline} for failure [are]{.underline} the **[absence
of]{.underline}** the rule of **[law and constructive
incentives]{.underline}**. Instead of firmly held legal rules, socialism
brings [gov]{.underline}ernment [authorities]{.underline} who [impose
arbitrary political decisions]{.underline}. People adapt by learning to
please politicians.

Consider China. The Chinese economy stagnated after the communist
takeover. So Deng Xiaoping looked around: Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan,
South Korea, and Japan had grown by allowing capitalist firms to compete
in world markets. Living standards rose in those capitalist countries.
Deng changed direction, inviting foreign capitalists to come to China if
they brought their best technologies. Growth soared, not by a miracle
but by the workings of market capitalism. Vietnam later followed the
path away from socialism. The countryside has many new factories owned
by capitalists from Europe and the United States.

Proponents of socialism often point to the Scandinavian countries,
especially Sweden, as successful examples of socialism. Sweden developed
an extensive welfare state but it retained two central capitalist
principles: private ownership of industry and property and a strong
commitment to the rule of law. The welfare state and income
redistribution appealed to a homogenous population that shared a common
culture. Recently Sweden\'s population has become more diverse, and the
welfare system, though still extensive, has shrunk.

The facts about [socialist failure and long-term capitalist success are
not secret.]{.underline} The problems of Argentina and Venezuela are in
the news even now. The mystery is why US college students ignore
socialist failures to cheer for socialism and Senator Sanders. The most
likely reason is a reaction to two well-known weaknesses of capitalism:
occasional recessions and income inequality. Growth since the 2008-9
recession has been relatively slow and, for earners not in the top
income groups, incomes are stagnant.

Sanders does not call for old-time socialism\--that is, government
ownership of the means of production. His main proposals demand higher
taxes on the highest incomes, free college education, increased Social
Security payments, and a higher minimum wage. These are not new ideas,
so we know what their consequences are: minimum wages reduce employment;
increased Social Security payments go to people who do not work and
encourage older workers to retire, so those payments reduce growth. They
also widen the income distribution gap because they often go to the
relatively well-off older citizens.

Sanders\'s promises would cost trillions of dollars. His tax proposal
would not cover the costs and would lower growth. Higher tax rates for
those who earn high incomes reduce savings and the return to
investments, so investment would decline. Reducing investment especially
harms the middle class because new investment is a principal source of
productivity growth, the principal way that middle-class incomes rise.
The persistent success of capitalist economies over the past two
centuries in raising incomes and distributing the gains widely over all
income classes mainly resulted from investment that increased worker
skills and productivity.

HOW PROSPERITY REALLY GROWS

It works like this: when a company invests in new machines or new
computer programs, it must train its workers to use the new tools and
systems. Learning on the job increases workers\' skills. They are able
to produce more, often at a lower unit cost. Productivity and profits
rise. Workers earn more. Further, [capitalism provides]{.underline} the
[incentive to develop new ideas that raise living standards and improve
lives.]{.underline} It is no accident that the computer, the social
network, the increased reliability of automobiles, and much more
originated in capitalist countries. Freedom and property rights
[encourage **innovation** and **progress**.]{.underline}

To pay higher wages, producers must increase productivity and therefore
investment must rise. The socialist program that raises tax rates on
savers and businesses is counterproductive because it reduces
investment. Productivity growth benefits all classes. Owners of [firms
have more profit; workers have higher wages; consumers have lower
prices.]{.underline} Capitalism produces a [cooperative outcome from
which everyone gains.]{.underline} Socialism and higher taxes impose the
noncooperative arrangement of taking from some to give to others. As the
many examples show, everyone eventually loses.

Past administrations and Congresses have promised much more spending
than the revenue the economy will generate. Many estimates put the
unfunded promises for future Social Security and health care at about
\$90 trillion. Adding free college tuition and other promised benefits
pushes the unfunded promises well above \$100 trillion. Unless reformed
and reduced, the promises cannot be met.

Voters should demand that candidates offer a program for managing past
promises. Reforming health care should begin by turning Medicare over to
the states and lowering federal tax rates. Competition across state
lines could lead to cost savings. Competition brings new ways to improve
outcomes and reduce waste.

To get better policies, we need informed voters and productive
incentives. Understanding the benefits and flaws of capitalism is a
first step toward political reform. Our future depends on getting the
policies and incentives right.

#### Socialist environmental policies and mentalities cannot tackle the problem of climate change as effectively as capitalism.

Let's come back now to the ecosocialist critique of capitalism. [What it
really comes down to is **a critique of productivism**. The question we
have to ask is, which system, capitalism or socialism, is more
susceptible to productivist tendencies? I think **the answer is
socialism**]{.underline}, although capitalism is by no means immune.

[The first reason that socialism is]{.underline} more likely to develop
[environmentally harmful]{.underline} productivist tendencies [is that
economic incentives **do not work**]{.underline} very well [under
socialism]{.underline}. In a capitalist society, [the single most useful
tool of environmental policy is to ensure that market prices fully
recognize all externalities. If the price of gasoline at the pump fully
reflects the opportunity costs of pollution and resource depletion,
drivers]{.underline}, regardless of their personal environmental
sensitivities, [will be forced to think about driving less or buying
more efficient vehicles. The same applies to users of industrial inputs,
whether they be plastics makers, farmers, or power plants]{.underline}.

I don't mean to underestimate the difficulty of getting the legislature
of a democratic capitalist country to pass the laws needed to ensure
that market prices reflect environmental values. Still, [when the price
system is used to fight pollution, it seems to work]{.underline}. For
example, in the United States of the 1990s and early 2000s, a system of
tradable permits was used with great success to bring down sulfur
dioxide emissions from coal-burning power plants, with the result that
the intensity of acid rain in the eastern part of the country was cut by
half.

Under socialism, economic incentives to fight pollution do not work as
well. Yes, I know, there is such a theoretical construct as "market
socialism." Under that hypothetical system, advocated by 20th century
writers like Oskar Lange and Abba Lerner, managers of collectively owned
firms guide their production activities in accordance not with true
market prices set by supply and demand, but instead "shadow prices" set
by government planners at levels supposedly equal to opportunity costs.
In theory, there would be no reason why the shadow prices could not
include appropriate adjustments for environmental values. I don't want
to reargue the whole [market socialism]{.underline} debate here. The
concept [has been widely judged to be impractical, and]{.underline} as
far as I know, it [has no living proponents]{.underline}. I think Ludwig
von Mises said it all when he suggested that [a real market is to market
socialism as a real railroad is to a boy playing with toy
trains]{.underline}. So instead, let's look at real world socialism.

In [the Soviet variant of socialism]{.underline}, the problem was not so
much that industrial managers were insensitive to environmental cost
incentives as that they were insensitive to any kind of cost incentive
at all. The Soviet system did not just encourage environmental waste, it
[was wasteful in every conceivable way. It wasted labor, capital,
energy]{.underline}, natural [resources]{.underline}, cement, steel,
coal, tractors, fertilizer, wood, [water]{.underline} [--- it wasted
everything. Why? Because there was **no profit motive**]{.underline}.

Today, some people worry that big banks like Goldman Sachs do not
operate efficiently because they know the government will bail them out
if they make a loss. This is called "privatizing the gains, socializing
the losses." Well, the Soviet economy was a system in which every
enterprise was a Goldman Sachs. No wonder it collapsed.

Now for [the second reason why socialism tends to be more productivist
than capitalism]{.underline}. This one has to do with social attitudes
that arise when there are no property rights. [Where there are property
rights, there is always an owner to resist trespass]{.underline},
whether by people on foot or by noxious chemicals wafting through the
air. True, the legal system doesn't work perfectly. Sometimes owners
can't adequately protect their rights, but the rights are there. Also,
[where there is widespread ownership of at least small scraps of
property, respect for the property rights of others **becomes
widespread** as well,]{.underline} although, alas, not universal.

But wait, the ecosocialist might say, under socialism there are
collective property rights and respect for the property of society as a
whole. Really? Let me tell a story.

At the business school my wife and I used to run in Moscow, the students
put on an annual May picnic. After some advance scouting by the class
president, the entire student body and faculty would jump on the
electric commuter train. A few stops outside the city, we would jump off
and head into the woods for a nice picnic. Whose woods? Some ministry's
or institute's or collective farm's; no one ever seemed to know exactly.
A picnic needed a campfire, of course, so someone would bring an ax and
cut down the nearest sapling to make a fire. When cleanup time came, the
students followed their standard practice, which was to toss all the
beer cans and vodka bottles into the remnants of the campfire, where
they would become broken, charred, and harder to pick up in the unlikely
event that someone were to try to do so later. When we suggested
bringing our own firewood or packing out our garbage, we were met by
looks that suggested such things had never been thought of before. I
started asking friends and colleagues about all this. Why didn't the
socialist property owner care who picnicked there? Why didn't kids learn
to respect socialist property, and clean up after themselves? The answer
was that [people didn't think of]{.underline} those woods as [socialist
property]{.underline}, even though nominally, they were. Instead, [they
were seen as]{.underline} nich'ia sobstvennost­ --- "[no one's property."
As such, **no one took responsibility for them,** and no one felt bad
about abusing them. Extend the same attitude to Lake Baikal, the Aral
Sea, and the Chernobyl nuclear station, and what you get is]{.underline}
Soviet [socialism.]{.underline}

[The third reason]{.underline} that socialism tends to be more
productivist than capitalism [stems from political economy.]{.underline}
Private property gives political power bases to multiple interests.
Sometimes that can work against the environment, as when Appalachian
coal unions and mine owners join to lobby against restrictions on sulfur
dioxide emissions. At the same time, though, producers of low-sulfur
coal from Western states can lobby on the other side, achieving some
kind of balance. Furthermore, not-for-profit groups can use the
mechanisms of private property to protect critical habitat, and private
ownership sustains an independent voice for media that can publicize
environmental causes. Even ecosocialists enjoy the protection of private
property for their web sites and conferences.

[In a socialist system, producers have a stronger grip on the levers of
political power]{.underline}. After all, [as state
enterprises]{.underline}, they are not mere lobbyists --- [they
are]{.underline} themselves [a part of the government
structure]{.underline}. For example, Marshall Goldman notes that there
were protests in the Soviet Union when paper mills first started dumping
waste into Lake Baikal. However, the protesters themselves were always
one government institution, say, the Limnological Institute of the
Academy of Sciences, working against another, in this case the Ministry
of Timber, Paper, and Woodworking. Sometimes the protesters were able to
exploit personal rivalries within the government in order to plant
articles in government newspapers, but in the end, they always lost. The
whole incentive system of the Soviet economy, from the Politburo down to
the local plant manager, was focused on just one thing: meeting the
impossibly demanding production targets of the Five Year Plans. **[The
environment always lost.]{.underline}**

[In the current body of critical reflections both on ecofeminism and
Indigenous feminism, several frictions can be found]{.underline}.
[Ecofeminism is]{.underline} being [criticized by]{.underline} some
[Indigenous feminists who argue that 'Western' feminists invoke
Aboriginal cultural beliefs and histories]{.underline} (Wilson, 2005),
[some warn about **appropriation of Indigenous concepts** when
developing ecofeminist theories]{.underline} (Nixon, 2015). [Some call
for ethical and respectful inclusion of Indigenous women voices to
greater feminist movements]{.underline} (Kwaymullina, 2017), [while
others only see the possibility of **partial connection** between
them]{.underline} (Sempertegui, 2019). [Unified views of 'Western'
ecofeminism and Indigenous feminism]{.underline} can [**harm the way
Indigenous women are perceived**. The application of Western gender
theory and policy to Indigenous has tended to **reduce** women and
girls' experiences to the categories of]{.underline}
'[victim]{.underline}' [and]{.underline} '[other]{.underline}' (Chilisa
& Ntseane, 2010). Similarly, in many Indigenous contexts, the
predominant discourse of liberal feminism tends to focus exclusively on
gender discrimination and gender equality. [The problem is the lack of
recognition of Indigenous women's articulations and conceptualizations
of feminism that **do not focus solely** on gender discrimination or
gender equality]{.underline} (Flowers, 2015; Knobblock & Kuokkanen,
2015). [Such an approach]{.underline} towards Indigenous women [was
demonstrated in the]{.underline} recent [Gender Equality in the Arctic
Report, where, unfortunately, **indigeneity is mentioned only in the
context of violence** and reconciliation]{.underline} (2021). [While
there is a clear tendency of reducing indigeneity and gender in climate
change to the concept of vulnerability, Indigenous feminisms **debate
this dominant discourse** as they come out of a long history of activism
to **address different types of oppression** in their
communities]{.underline} (Anderson, 2020). Importantly, Indigenous
feminism has been 'instrumental' in the resistance to resource
extraction (Yazzie & Baldy, 2018) especially in water protection
movements.

### **[Alt Fails (Indigenous Knowledge) -- 2AC]{.underline}**

#### Collaboration with Indigenous populations fails -- either the alt fails to overcome societal mistrust OR cannot address climate change swiftly enough to prevent existential impacts.

[I\'m not convinced that efforts to change these factors will stop the
proliferation of dangers for indigenous peoples. For changing these
factors requires that the relationships connecting diverse societal
institutions together are already conducive to coordinated action
without further perpetrating harmful injustices. Environmental
injustices **aren\'t any less likely** in actions taken in the spirit of
urgency to adapt to climate change]{.underline} and mitigate a 2°C rise.
Though valuable insights on coordinated action and justice are developed
in research on international negotiations, environmental regimes, or
common pool resource management, I am focusing instead on [what I\'ve
learned from my experiences and work in indigenous advocacy
actions.]{.underline}

[Indigenous peoples often show that the relationships they have with
other societies are]{.underline} lacking in certain qualities. [For
example, indigenous peoples are concerned about ongoing disrespect
against their consent (or dissent)]{.underline} to oil and gas
pipelines, [the distrustful behavior of nations seeking to dispossess
indigenous peoples of their lands through forest conservation or
hydropower, and the failure of accountability and reciprocity in
governmental programs that seek to foster clean energy development or
community resettlement]{.underline}. Here, I write primarily in terms of
human relationships, yet [indigenous peoples understand their societies
and relationships as inclusive of diverse beings and entities beyond
humans]{.underline}. In a more expanded version of this essay, I would
cover how the [violations of consent, trust, accountability, and
reciprocity are also against relative]{.underline}s such as plants,
rivers, animals, insects, seas, mountains, fishes, among others.

Consent, trust, [accountability, and reciprocity are qualities of
relationships that are critical for justice-oriented coordination across
societal institutions on any urgent matter. Yet they are precisely the
kinds of qualities of relationships that **take time to nurture** and
develop]{.underline}. That is, [they are necessary for taking urgent
action that is just, **but they cannot be established
urgently**]{.underline}. The point in the last sentence implies at least
two scenarios pertaining to climate change dangers and the leadership of
non-indigenous societies. While these are not the only scenarios (e.g.,
climate denialist scenarios, among others), I wish to engage the two
here in relation to each other for the sake of dialogue beyond this
essay.

The first scenario involves sweeping global [action to lower greenhouse
emissions, led by nations and other privileged parties]{.underline} and
influencers. Yet, [without respecting the relational qualities of
consent, trust, accountability, and reciprocity]{.underline}, the
implementation of the solutions [harms indigenous peoples
widely]{.underline}, whether [through displacement]{.underline}, land
[dispossession]{.underline}, unfair payment schemes and employment
practices, [exclusion]{.underline} from markets, [or denial of
indigenous agency in planning and leadership]{.underline}. [Here, the
intensity of ecological events]{.underline} (measured in isolation)
[lessens globally and a 2°C rise is averted. However, **environmental
injustices remain**]{.underline} business as usual[. **It\'s too
late**]{.underline}, then, [**to stop climate injustices** tied to the
implementation of adaptation or mitigation solutions.]{.underline}

The second scenario is that nations and other privileged parties and
influencers seek to first establish and repair the qualities of consent,
trust, accountability, and reciprocity. Yet [the time it takes to do so
unfolds slowly, meaning that curbing emissions takes longer because key
projects take more time to get off the ground]{.underline}. While [in
this scenario indigenous peoples]{.underline} eventually [have
relationships]{.underline} with other societal institutions [that are
conducive to justice-oriented coordination, **there is nonetheless a 2°C
rise**]{.underline}, leading to risky environmental disturbances,
whether to indigenous peoples or others. [In this scenario, **it\'s too
late** to avoid dangerous climate change]{.underline}. Yet the
relational qualities for urgent, justice-oriented coordination will be
established for the future beyond this scenario.

The two scenarios suggest to me, among other things, that [there are two
systematic tipping points that are of concern. In terms of climate
change, the ecological tipping point concerns how the inaction of
societies to mitigate their contributions to]{.underline} atmospheric
concentrations of [greenhouse gases threatens to have irreversible and
dangerous effects. The relational tipping point concerns the
**inaction** of societies to establish or maintain relational qualities
**connecting societal institutions together**]{.underline} for the sake
of coordinated action. **[Such inaction]{.underline}** eventually
**[makes it impossible to carry out swift responses to urgent problems
without perpetrating injustices]{.underline}**. The relational qualities
are the same ones I\'ve been discussing, like consent. While many people
are concerned about crossing the ecological tipping point, [the
relational tipping point got crossed long ago thanks to systems of
**colonialism, capitalism, and industrialization**]{.underline}.
