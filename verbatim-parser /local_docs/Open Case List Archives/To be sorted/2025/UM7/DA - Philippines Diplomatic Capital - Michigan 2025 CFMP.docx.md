# Philippine Dip Cap

## Notes

The story -- China is encroaching on the SCS, and the Philippines is
getting scared. US involvement is key because it's a launching point to
protect Taiwan and stop SCS conflicts before it goes nuclear. Second
version is that Philippine involvement spills up to a united ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations), which deters China. Most of
the stuff can be supplemented from the China Revisionism File and the
Iran Dip Cap file. The 1NC internals claims Taiwan and SCS impacts.

Thank you to BFHR for releasing impact defense for me to show the
cross-applications of to this DA, and thank you to BKRS for the Iran Dip
Cap Cards.

[The Philippines also has room to be more proactive and bolder in its

the domestic domain as Filipinos are starting to grasp the depth of
malign foreign influence and interference operations, many of which
point to covert operations by suspected Chinese operatives as well as
Philippine offshore gaming operators run by Chinese and Southeast Asian
nationals that have been the subject of government crackdown.
[[Despite]{.mark}]{.underline} these **[[contentious issues]{.mark}, the

in the Philippines' fo]{.mark}reign [po]{.mark}licy [tempo]{.mark} and
[necessitates leadership]{.mark} to answer the question on what it can
bring to the table]{.underline}. More concretely, [the [Philippines
offers]{.mark} [access and credibility]{.mark}]{.underline}. First, the
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates now
[[has]{.mark} unprecedented [access]{.mark} in the region, more than it
did than the Bases Agreement]{.underline} years (1947-1991). There are
**[[[more EDCA

than former U.S. military bases]{.underline}**. The United States will
thus have [mechanisms allowing it to access theaters in both Northeast
and Southeast Asia thanks to the Philippines]{.underline}. Second, the
[[Philippines stands as a significant part of the first island
chain]{.mark} that is on the frontlines of Chinese
coercion]{.underline}. The significant [access]{.underline} the United
States has gained from the Philippines can be seen as [equal
to]{.underline} what the United States
[demands](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/07/03/politics/trump-nato-letter-norway/index.html)
of [European members of NATO]{.underline}. Once the bases are fully
operational, the Philippines and the United States will be on almost
equal terms with regard to alliance commitments and both sides stand to
benefit from this. **[[The United States' association with the

[[[Deterrence](https://fulcrum.sg/2024-top-10-the-philippines-and-west-philippine-sea-bringing-deterrence-into-the-picture-2/)
should be the starting point]{.mark} of alliance activities in 2025, as
preventing conflict with China should be on top of the minds of alliance
managers]{.underline}. [[China will]{.mark},]{.underline} as any rising
power would, [[seek to supplant the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates as
the [primary power in the Indo-Pac]{.mark}ific]{.underline}. The
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}outh [[C]{.underline}]{.mark}hina
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}ea is part of [Beijing's [Southern Theater
Command](https://cpg-online.de/the-southern-theater-command-and-chinas-maritime-strategy/),]{.underline}
and it has vast interests over the expanse. Having dictated the pace of
events in the South China Sea for over a decade, **[[China already
possesses escalation dominance]{.mark}, and it is expected that it will
seek to further erode the effectiveness of the U.S. military
presence]{.underline}** in the area. This in turn reduces the ability of
the United States to respond to a Taiwan crisis in an efficient manner.
[Since 2012, China has demonstrably sought to reduce the deployment of
the Armed Forces of the Philippines]{.underline} (AFP) in the South
China Sea. By [normative means]{.underline} (e.g. so-called white hull
to white hull diplomacy) **[or by [forc]{.mark}ing [the Philippines to
[believe](https://thediplomat.com/2024/12/philippines-will-not-deploy-navy-in-stand-offs-with-china-marcos-says/)
that the use of civilian vessels is less provocative]{.mark}, China has
effectively [stymied]{.mark} the [capacity of the Philippine military to
defend its maritime domain.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Nevertheless, two
actions of the AFP have pushed Beijing to negotiate with Manila and
prompted a more forceful information campaign. First, [the [Second
Thomas Shoal
incident](https://amti.csis.org/shifting-tactics-at-second-thomas-shoal/)
of June 17, 2024 is evidence that China seeks to avoid extensive
engagement with the Philippine military, which contrasts strongly
against their more belligerent posture against the civilian vessels of
the Philippine Coast Guard and the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic
Resources. Second, the
[deployment](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-deploys-typhon-missile-launchers-new-location-philippines-2025-01-23/)
of the Typhon missiles system in the Philippines has provoked Beijing to
continue its verbal assault, the
[latest](https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/topstories/nation/936063/china-typhon-missiles-foreign-ministry/story/)
of which stated "China will not sit idly by when its security interests
are harmed or threatened."]{.underline} [To build
deterrence]{.underline} against China, **[[robust diplomatic,
informational, military, and economic engagement between the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates a[nd the Philippines will be
necessary]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The [[alliance's deterrent
effect]{.mark} is strongest when China believes that the allied
countries are willing to collectively and cohesively respond to any
escalatory activities]{.underline}. To orchestrate the range of
activities across the alliance, in multiple domains, [the United States
and the Philippines need to establish new alliance]{.underline}
management mechanism[s]{.underline} to coordinate bilateral activities.
Such mechanisms can also help foster shared concepts of deterrence to
ensure the allies approach the problems in a similar way. The allies
should [[activate]{.mark} minilateral and [multilateral diplomatic
channels]{.mark} such as [unified messaging on
China]{.mark}]{.underline}'s dangerous behaviors, [making Philippine
responses to Beijing unpredictable, creating easier avenues for
multilateral activities at sea, and returning the AFP to the frontlines
of the S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea. China
needs to be convinced that the cost of infringing on Philippine
sovereignty and sovereign rights will outweigh the benefits of such
actions. That is the **[[key to deterrence]{.mark}, and something that
Manila and Washington should think about moving forward]{.underline}**.
The allied countries have both unilateral and combined interests and
abilities to boost alliance readiness. The question is [[if Washington
and Manila are prepared to accept the costs of]{.mark} ensuring
[strat]{.mark}eg[i]{.mark}c [stab]{.mark}ilit[y]{.mark} in the
S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea, which may
involve shedding some of the activities that have failed to deter
Beijing. Conclusion Ultimately, the Philippines has great expectations
and confidence in the Trump administration. The alliance is expected to
strengthen further as both the Philippines and the United States enact
their respective foreign policies, especially in the context of
combatting and deterring Chinese aggression. Both are also expected to
be more proactive in their approaches towards the alliance, for mutual
benefit. [The [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
has **[[everything to gain by addressing the concerns of the
Philippine]{.mark}s, further bolstering its position and fortifying its
own national security.]{.underline}**

#### Expanding presence in the arctic trades off with other global initiatives 

**DOD 24** \[Department of Defense; Executive department of the U.S.
federal government; 6-21-2024; Department of Defense;
https://media.defense.gov/2024/Jul/22/2003507411/-1/-1/0/DOD-ARCTIC-STRATEGY-2024.PDF;
Accessed 6-28-2025; VB\]

This strategy lays out the Department of Defense's (DoD's) approach to
the Arctic as the region undergoes rapid geophysical and geopolitical
change.1 The strategy aligns with and nests under the 2022 National
Security Strategy (NSS), 2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS), and 2022
National Strategy for the Arctic Region (NSAR). It also aligns with and
implements the intent of the 2023 DoD Homeland Defense Policy Guidance.

[The NSAR states that [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [seeks an
Arctic]{.mark} region [that is peaceful]{.mark}, stable, prosperous,
[and cooperative]{.mark}. In support of this national-level objective,
DoD, in cooperation [with]{.mark} our [Allies]{.mark} and partners2 ,
will pursue an end state that preserves the Arctic as a stable region in
which the U.S. homeland remains secure and vital national interests are
safeguarded.]{.underline}

[The NDS directs that [activities in the Arctic]{.mark} will be
calibrated to reflect a "monitor-and-respond" approach that is
[underpinned by robust intelligence collection]{.mark} capabilities,
[security cooperation]{.mark} with our regional Allies and partners,
[and]{.mark} the deterrent value of DoD's ability to deploy the Joint
Force globally at the time and place of our choosing.]{.underline} This
strategy guides DoD's efforts to build and sustain this
monitor-and-respond approach to the Arctic. Implementing this strategy
will enable DoD to achieve our desired end state for the region,
aligning with efforts to strengthen homeland defense, safeguard U.S.
interests, and improve interoperability with Arctic Allies and partners
while preserving focus on the pacing challenge of the People's Republic
of China (PRC) globally.

Climate change and shifts in the geostrategic environment drive the need
for a new strategic approach to the Arctic region. [This strategy will
strengthen the ability of the United States to build integrated
deterrence and effectively manage risk to U.S. interests in the Arctic
region by [enhancing]{.mark} our [domain awareness]{.mark} and Arctic
capabilities; engaging with Allies, partners, and key stakeholders; and
exercising tailored presence.]{.underline}

[[Primary risks to]{.mark} the [success]{.mark} of this strategy **[stem
from the need to balance against other]{.mark}** DoD **[global
commitments]{.mark}** or find ways to integrate with other resource
requirements. As such, DoD Components should take these risks into
account during resourcing deliberations through DoD's established
processes.]{.underline}

#### US-ASEAN cooperation is key to deter gray zone escalations in the SCS and a broader Indo-Pacific war.

[[ASEAN matters for America]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
[[important]{.mark} role]{.underline} of ASEAN [[in the]{.mark} US
[Indo-Pac]{.mark}ific strategy]{.underline} cannot be overstated. As the
convener of the region, ASEAN has an indispensable role as a platform
for Washington to clearly articulate its vision for a free and open
Indo-Pacific. ASEAN institutions also [ensure that US [engagements
in]{.mark} humanitarian assistance and disaster relief ([HADR]{.mark}),
security sector [capacity-building]{.mark}, [and governance]{.mark}
reforms are effective and complementary]{.underline} to national and
regional initiatives. ASEAN is a dynamic, diverse and high-growth region
that is important to the US economy. The potential for growth in US
trade is promising, contingent upon a willingness to explore
opportunities for bilateral and multilateral trade agreements and
investment with the region. **[Amer[ica matters for
ASEAN]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Washington's expressed support for ASEAN
centrality is vital for [ensuring ASEAN continues to play a leading role
in shaping the region's security agenda]{.underline}. US presence,
including security sector capacity-building initiatives, **[means that
[no one power can dominate Southeast Asia]{.mark} and dictate on
regional matters, and that the [multifaceted security]{.mark} challenges
are [addressed]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The United States [plays an
important role in ASEAN's economic landscape]{.underline}. Cumulatively,
US companies have invested over \$270 billion in ASEAN, greater than
directed to the four largest Asian economies -- China, Japan, India, and
South Korea -- combined. These private sector-led investments support
ASEAN growth and provide jobs and opportunities to millions in Southeast
Asia. Specific issue areas identified that are important for [[enhancing
the]{.mark} strategic US-ASEAN [partnership]{.mark}]{.underline} include
non-traditional security issues, maritime security, US security
cooperation with Japan and Australia in ASEAN, promoting rule of law and
good governance in Southeast Asia, and enhancing US-ASEAN economic
relations. The United States has a [long history helping Southeast
Asia]{.underline} address humanitarian crises, including those resulting
from natural disasters. With recent improvements in ASEAN's
institutional capacities, for instance, the establishment of the ASEAN
Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian Assistance on Disaster Management
(AHA Centre) the US has incorporated ASEAN mechanisms into its response
efforts. **[[Countering violent-extremism remains a top priority]{.mark}
for both the United States and ASEAN]{.underline}**. Several US-ASEAN
cooperation mechanisms to address [CVE issues need [continued
support]{.mark}, including the Southeast Asia Regional Center for
Counter-Terrorism (]{.underline}SEARCTT) [in Malaysia, the International
Law Enforcement Academy]{.underline} (ILEA), and [the Joint Special
Operation Task Force Philippines]{.underline} (JSOTFP). There are [four
shared cyber security priorities]{.underline} and challenges that are
critical for ASEAN and the United States: [cybercrime, protection of
critical infrastructure, content control, and connectivity]{.underline}.
A holistic approach will help ASEAN countries develop connectivity while
mitigating the impact of espionage from infrastructure investments in
the future, especially those funded by authoritarian states.
**[[Difficulty in dealing with gray-zone tensions in the S]{.mark}outh
[C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea is [compounded by ASEAN countries' differing
threat perceptions, lack of resources and capacity, and weak]{.mark}
interagency [coordination.]{.mark}]{.underline}** While ASEAN
member-states welcome US presence and reassurance, the value of
unilateral freedom of navigation operations by the US Navy remain
underappreciated in the region since many view it as primarily focused
on freedom of navigation for US Navy ships. ASEAN littoral states' major
maritime concern is access to coastal state entitlements (i.e. rights to
access oil, gas and fishery resources in their exclusive economic zones
and continental shelves free from coercion), as provided for under
international law. Since priorities do not align in Southeast Asia, [it
is [important for ASEAN and the United States to develop a common
conception of, and complementary priorities on, the rule of law]{.mark}
in the context of maritime security.]{.underline}

#### An unrestrained China causes war in the Indo-Pacific, and it goes nuclear. 

Dr. Christopher **Ford,** 6-12-20**25,** \[The Hon. Christopher Ford is

State University's School of Defense and Strategic Studies, and a
Distinguished Visiting Fellow at the Pharos Foundation at Oxford, served

Indo-Pacific\", New Paradigms Forum,
<https://www.newparadigmsforum.com/nuclear-risks-in-the-indo-pacific>,
accessed 7/19/25, S.A.M.\]

It is certainly the case that [nuclear risks in the Indo-Pacific are
considerable]{.underline}, and I fear **[they are
growing.]{.underline}** Let me mention [three of the
sources]{.underline} of such risk, and then suggest four things that
might help reduce these risks. Growing Threat of [Great Power
Aggression]{.underline} I think the most likely scenario for a nuclear
war is not the kind of bolt-out-of-the-blue preemption scenario that
Cold War strategists worried so much about. Instead, it's the
[escalation]{.underline} to nuclear use [from a conventional
conflict]{.underline} involving nuclear-armed powers. And in that sense,
the major risk of nuclear conflict stems from the fact that **[after
some decades of relative strategic stability, two of the three great
power nuclear-weapons possessors of the 21st Century are once again
preparing for -- or are already engaged in -- 19th-Century-style games
of regional military aggression, intimidation, and territorial
expansion.]{.underline}** [Russia has led the way]{.underline} in this
respect, of course, but [China is also creating similar risks in the
Indo-Pacific as it expands into -- and militarizes -- areas claimed by
other countries in the S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina
[S]{.underline}ea, as it gradually [expands the territory it controls in
the Himalayas]{.underline}, and as it prepares for the [possibility of
invading and conquering the thriving democracy in Taiwan next
door]{.underline}. It is this apparent thirst for expansion and regional
control that I believe creates the greatest risk of multi-party
conventional war in the region, and hence also [**the greatest risk of
nuclear escalation with the United States.** Nuclear
Build-Up]{.underline} The second -- [related and
overlapping]{.underline} -- factor increasing nuclear risks in the
Indo-Pacific is the scope and scale of [China's huge nuclear weapons
build-up]{.underline}. [Beijing]{.underline} still doesn't publicly
admit that it's doing this, but China is now **[on track to have around
1,500 operationally deployed nuclear warheads by 2035.]{.underline}**
That means approximate [nuclear parity with the United States, and also
with Russia]{.underline}, and it would represent a huge proportional
increase in the number of nuclear weapons in the world. This nuclear
build-up, moreover, seems not just destabilizing but needless.\* Thanks
to Beijing's ongoing build-up of its conventional military power, this
nuclear buildup is occu**[rring at a time in which China faces the
lowest level of relative military threat that it has seen since the
early 19th Century.]{.underline}** In fact, China's [conventional forces
are probably today more powerful]{.underline}, relative to any
conceivable outside power, [than they have been at any point since the
years of the Qianlong Emperor.]{.underline} Thanks to decades of
[post-Cold War nuclear reductions]{.underline} by the United States and
Russia, moreover, the specifically **[nuclear threats China arguably
faces are also now at their lowest]{.underline}**, relatively speaking,
than at any other point in the PRC's history. The **[ratio of Chinese
nuclear weapons to non-Chinese nuclear weapons has never been higher,
and this was true even before Beijing's huge new nuclear buildup began
several years ago.]{.underline}** China's nuclear weapons building spree
is increasingly [presenting both the United States and the Russian
Federation with an historically unprecedented "two-peer problem" of
having to posture for deterrence against two nuclear-armed great power
challenges at the same time]{.underline}.\*\* This increases nuclear
risks directly, and it is also accelerating pressures upon both
Washington and Moscow to build and deploy more nuclear weaponry
themselves. [Proliferation Pressures]{.underline} And it is probably not
just Washington and Moscow that feel such pressures, for a [third
nuclear risk factor stems from the pressure that China's military
buildup and territorial expansionism is placing upon the
nonproliferation regime]{.underline}, by giving China's neighbors
increasing incentive to develop their own nuclear weaponry. These
pressures are particularly [acute today in light of the Second Trump
Administration's weakened commitment to America's alliance with
NATO]{.underline}, which may be confronting our Indo-Pacific allies with
what probably feels like an unprecedented incentive to suspect that
indigenous nuclear weaponization could be their last, best hope to deter
being coerced into becoming vassal states of the Middle Kingdom.
Historically, after all, [U.S. military strength and alliance
relationships have been powerful nonproliferation tools because they
have served to obviate any perceived need by a number of America's
friends and allies to develop nuclear weapons themselves.]{.underline}
Ironically, U.S. strength and alliance relationships have thus tended
also to be in the interest of America's strategic adversaries, because
that U.S. strength and those alliances prevent our adversaries from
having to face additional nuclear-armed opponents in their respective
regions. And, as any student of history will know, this is not at all a
merely hypothetical point. [U.S. security relationships and diplomatic
pressure are what persuaded Taiwan to stop its own nuclear weapons
program in the late 1980s. They are also what persuaded South Korea to
abandon such efforts in the 1970s.]{.underline} Chinese strategists
forget these lessons of history at their peril. As you will all know,
were leaders in Tokyo and Seoul, for example, to decide that
proliferation pressures had become intolerable, it would hardly be
difficult for them to take the kind of nuclear weapons path that we
Americans talked a number of our friends and allies out of taking in the
past. Japan, for example, owns a staggering quantity of separated
plutonium that as of 2023 amounted to 44.5 tons of material altogether,
of which 8.6 tons were stored on Japanese territory. I'm no math whiz,
but using the IAEA's "significant quantity" figure of eight kilograms of
plutonium per weapon, that 8.6 tons of plutonium on Japanese territory
alone sounds like it could be turned into more than 975 bombs. For its
part, South Korea has a large and sophisticated nuclear power industry
that in 2019 was the fifth-largest producer of nuclear energy in the
world. South Korea has for years been requesting U.S. permission to
develop plutonium reprocessing capabilities -- in the form of so-called
"pyroprocessing" -- and South Korean scientists were also caught in
undeclared small-scale enrichment experiments in 2004. So Seoul has,
therefore, certainly not been entirely without interest in producing its
own fissile material. To my knowledge, South Korea has not yet developed
any local capacity to produce it, but it would surely not be too hard
for it to separate plutonium from spent reactor fuel to produce
weapons-usable material if it wished. Moreover, both Japan and
(especially) South Korea are developing increasingly sophisticated
long-range missile capabilities. I can't imagine that either of them
would have trouble effectively delivering a nuclear weapon to China or
North Korea if they possessed such devices. [The Common
Denominator]{.underline} So what is the common denominator of all these
problems? I fear it is **[China. Between its expanding conventional
military power, its threats against its neighbors, its nuclear buildup,
and its continuing refusal to implement U.N. sanctions on the notably
nuclear-risky regime in North Korea, Beijing's policy choices lie at the
center of nuclear risks in the Indo-Pacific.]{.underline}**

[[[Deterrence](https://fulcrum.sg/2024-top-10-the-philippines-and-west-philippine-sea-bringing-deterrence-into-the-picture-2/)
should be the starting point]{.mark} of alliance activities in 2025, as
preventing conflict with China should be on top of the minds of alliance
managers]{.underline}. [[China will]{.mark},]{.underline} as any rising
power would, [[seek to supplant the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates as
the [primary power in the Indo-Pac]{.mark}ific]{.underline}. The
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}outh [[C]{.underline}]{.mark}hina
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}ea is part of [Beijing's [Southern Theater
Command](https://cpg-online.de/the-southern-theater-command-and-chinas-maritime-strategy/),]{.underline}
and it has vast interests over the expanse. Having dictated the pace of
events in the South China Sea for over a decade, **[[China already
possesses escalation dominance]{.mark}, and it is expected that it will
seek to further erode the effectiveness of the U.S. military
presence]{.underline}** in the area. This in turn reduces the ability of
the United States to respond to a Taiwan crisis in an efficient manner.
[Since 2012, China has demonstrably sought to reduce the deployment of
the Armed Forces of the Philippines]{.underline} (AFP) in the South
China Sea. By [normative means]{.underline} (e.g. so-called white hull
to white hull diplomacy) **[or by [forc]{.mark}ing [the Philippines to
[believe](https://thediplomat.com/2024/12/philippines-will-not-deploy-navy-in-stand-offs-with-china-marcos-says/)
that the use of civilian vessels is less provocative]{.mark}, China has
effectively [stymied]{.mark} the [capacity of the Philippine military to
defend its maritime domain.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Nevertheless, two
actions of the AFP have pushed Beijing to negotiate with Manila and
prompted a more forceful information campaign. First, [the [Second
Thomas Shoal
incident](https://amti.csis.org/shifting-tactics-at-second-thomas-shoal/)
of June 17, 2024 is evidence that China seeks to avoid extensive
engagement with the Philippine military, which contrasts strongly
against their more belligerent posture against the civilian vessels of
the Philippine Coast Guard and the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic
Resources. Second, the
[deployment](https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/us-deploys-typhon-missile-launchers-new-location-philippines-2025-01-23/)
of the Typhon missiles system in the Philippines has provoked Beijing to

of which stated "China will not sit idly by when its security interests

deterrence]{.underline} against China, **[[robust diplomatic,
informational, military, and economic engagement between the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates a[nd the Philippines will be
necessary]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The [[alliance's deterrent
effect]{.mark} is strongest when China believes that the allied
countries are willing to collectively and cohesively respond to any
escalatory activities]{.underline}. To orchestrate the range of
activities across the alliance, in multiple domains, [the United States
and the Philippines need to establish new alliance]{.underline}
management mechanism[s]{.underline} to coordinate bilateral activities.
Such mechanisms can also help foster shared concepts of deterrence to
ensure the allies approach the problems in a similar way. The allies
should [[activate]{.mark} minilateral and [multilateral diplomatic
channels]{.mark} such as [unified messaging on
China]{.mark}]{.underline}'s dangerous behaviors, [making Philippine
responses to Beijing unpredictable, creating easier avenues for
multilateral activities at sea, and returning the AFP to the frontlines
of the S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea. China
needs to be convinced that the cost of infringing on Philippine
sovereignty and sovereign rights will outweigh the benefits of such
actions. That is the **[[key to deterrence]{.mark}, and something that
Manila and Washington should think about moving forward]{.underline}**.
The allied countries have both unilateral and combined interests and
abilities to boost alliance readiness. The question is [[if Washington
and Manila are prepared to accept the costs of]{.mark} ensuring
[strat]{.mark}eg[i]{.mark}c [stab]{.mark}ilit[y]{.mark} in the
S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea, which may
involve shedding some of the activities that have failed to deter
Beijing. Conclusion Ultimately, the Philippines has great expectations
and confidence in the Trump administration. The alliance is expected to
strengthen further as both the Philippines and the United States enact
their respective foreign policies, especially in the context of
combatting and deterring Chinese aggression. Both are also expected to
be more proactive in their approaches towards the alliance, for mutual
benefit. [The [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates
has **[[everything to gain by addressing the concerns of the

#### Expanding presence in the arctic trades off with other global initiatives 

**DOD 24** \[Department of Defense; Executive department of the U.S.
federal government; 6-21-2024; Department of Defense;
https://media.defense.gov/2024/Jul/22/2003507411/-1/-1/0/DOD-ARCTIC-STRATEGY-2024.PDF;
Accessed 6-28-2025; VB\]

This strategy lays out the Department of Defense's (DoD's) approach to
the Arctic as the region undergoes rapid geophysical and geopolitical
change.1 The strategy aligns with and nests under the 2022 National
Security Strategy (NSS), 2022 National Defense Strategy (NDS), and 2022
National Strategy for the Arctic Region (NSAR). It also aligns with and
implements the intent of the 2023 DoD Homeland Defense Policy Guidance.

[The NSAR states that [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [seeks an
Arctic]{.mark} region [that is peaceful]{.mark}, stable, prosperous,
[and cooperative]{.mark}. In support of this national-level objective,
DoD, in cooperation [with]{.mark} our [Allies]{.mark} and partners2 ,
will pursue an end state that preserves the Arctic as a stable region in
which the U.S. homeland remains secure and vital national interests are
safeguarded.]{.underline}

[The NDS directs that [activities in the Arctic]{.mark} will be
calibrated to reflect a "monitor-and-respond" approach that is
[underpinned by robust intelligence collection]{.mark} capabilities,
[security cooperation]{.mark} with our regional Allies and partners,
[and]{.mark} the deterrent value of DoD's ability to deploy the Joint
Force globally at the time and place of our choosing.]{.underline} This
strategy guides DoD's efforts to build and sustain this
monitor-and-respond approach to the Arctic. Implementing this strategy
will enable DoD to achieve our desired end state for the region,
aligning with efforts to strengthen homeland defense, safeguard U.S.
interests, and improve interoperability with Arctic Allies and partners
while preserving focus on the pacing challenge of the People's Republic
of China (PRC) globally.

Climate change and shifts in the geostrategic environment drive the need
for a new strategic approach to the Arctic region. [This strategy will
strengthen the ability of the United States to build integrated
deterrence and effectively manage risk to U.S. interests in the Arctic
region by [enhancing]{.mark} our [domain awareness]{.mark} and Arctic
capabilities; engaging with Allies, partners, and key stakeholders; and
exercising tailored presence.]{.underline}

[[Primary risks to]{.mark} the [success]{.mark} of this strategy **[stem
from the need to balance against other]{.mark}** DoD **[global
commitments]{.mark}** or find ways to integrate with other resource
requirements. As such, DoD Components should take these risks into
account during resourcing deliberations through DoD's established
processes.]{.underline}

treaty ally in its disputes]{.mark} with China over the
SCS.]{.underline} The U.S. uses the 2016 Arbitral Tribunal's ruling as a
legal reference to assert freedom of navigation and delegitimize China's
"nine-dash line" claims. **[[Washington supports Manila's claims in the
SCS through]{.mark} public [diplomacy]{.mark}, diplomatic [protests,
and]{.mark} patrol [coordination]{.mark}. Hence, the [Philippines
is]{.mark} the [US's normative leverage]{.mark} in Southeast
Asia.]{.underline}** The [Philippines symbolizes [a "rules-based
order,]{.mark}"]{.underline} giving the US normative leverage in shaping
regional perceptions about China's behavior. In addition, the [U.S.
so-called support to the Philippines in the SCS against China has been
[evident in]{.mark} the context of the U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense
Treaty ([MDT]{.mark}) [through bilateral and trilateral
patrols]{.mark}]{.underline} (with Japan), including near disputed areas
like Scarborough Shoal. The U.S. has also ramped up military aid,
equipment transfers, and ISR (intelligence, surveillance,
reconnaissance) cooperation regarding defense assistance. Concerning
limitations, while treaty-bound, in case of a full-scale armed attack,
the [MDT [doesn't automatically mean U.S. intervention]{.mark} unless
vital U.S. strategic interests are at stake.]{.underline} Conclusion
Overall, the Philippines is [strategically significant to the
U.S.]{.underline} First, militarily, it is a [host to U.S. forward
deployment bases near China, the SCS, and Taiwan]{.underline}. Second,
it is a [[key player in legally challenging China's maritime
claims]{.mark} in the SCS. Symbolically, the Philippines is a showpiece
of the US for alliance credibility in Asia, and geopolitically, the
Philippines is the [swing state]{.mark} in the SCS power contest, the

As the 2020s begin, the world can breathe a collective sigh of relief
that [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates has so far [avoided a
major military crisis with China]{.underline}. Over the past decade,
[China challenged]{.underline} the lawful rights of U.S. [partners and
allies in the western Pacific, built massive artificial island bases in
the disputed Spratly Islands, and actively sought control over all the
waters, seabed, and airspace of the S]{.underline}outh
[C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea. Yet the United States has
maintained its access to those waters, deterred any major Chinese use of
force against its neighbors, and helped support the efforts of Japan to
maintain administrative control over the disputed Senkaku Islands in the
East China Sea. [U.S. strategy has been notably less successful in
preventing China from robbing Southeast Asian partners, including U.S.
ally the Philippines, of their resources and rights in the South China
Sea. But the United States has at least slowed China's advance while
avoiding war.]{.underline} It would be **[unwise, however, to assume
that the status quo is stable]{.underline}**. Deterrence has not
failed---yet. China is unlikely to do something as brazen as forcefully
denying U.S. Navy or commercial ships access to the South China Sea,
attacking American or Japanese bases, or intentionally sinking Filipino
sailors in disputed waters. But **[Beijing continues to probe and test
U.S. and allied resolve, provoking low-level crises which could easily
escalate.]{.underline}** Current U.S. [strategic thinking could trigger
disproportionate responses that would cause such crises to spiral out of
control. **That is the way World War I began a century ago---and it
could happen again.** War games seem to confirm these]{.underline}
historic lessons. One of us has taken part in numerous simulations over
the last five years asking seasoned experts and officials to role-play
how [Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, and American leaders might respond to
crises in the South and East China Seas.]{.underline} The results are
typically sobering. **[Some end in a rapid Chinese fait accompli, such
as the seizure of a disputed island with minimal cost, while U.S. and
allied leaders dither. This type of scenario would lead to considerable
damage to international norms, U.S. alliances, and American national
security.]{.underline}** Even **[more simulations rapidly escalate into
full-scale conflict]{.underline}**, bringing **[China and the United
States to the doorstep of nuclear war over stakes that no rational
observer would consider worth it.]{.underline}** The U.S. national
security community tends to view [the ability to defeat China (or
Russia) in combat wherever an ally might be attacked as an essential
goal]{.underline}. Direct defense or prompt reversal of any aggression,
no matter how small, are the foundational principles of current
strategy. [A]{.underline}rticle [5]{.underline} of the NATO treaty and
simi**[lar mutual defense commitments to Japan and the Philippines treat
all aggression as an equally existential threa]{.underline}**t. So in a
scenario involving a Chinese landing on the Japanese-administered
Senkakus or a threat to the Sierra Madre---a derelict Philippine navy
ship intentionally ran aground at Second Thomas Shoal in the Spratlys
and now housing a dozen soldiers---American strategic culture most often
leads to the conclusion that kinetic action to retake a seized feature
or outpost is justified to avoid abandoning an ally and damaging U.S.
credibility. But **[such an escalation]{.underline}**, while it should
be kept as an option, would be fraught. It might [**end quickly,**
amounting to little more than a skirmish, or large-scale conflict
between nuclear-armed superpowers could ensue. Both sides would **have
powerful political incentives to escalate further**]{.underline}.
Military warning and communications systems might be targeted through
cyberattack or other means in a way that sowed confusion. **[Escalation
control could not be guaranteed]{.underline}**---history and military
scholarship strongly suggest as much, and many war games corroborate it.

for Washington, D.C.]{.underline}, on Sunday for a **[three-day official
visit aimed at reaffirming the Philippines' enduring alliance with the
United States and advancing key national interests.]{.underline}**
Speaking at the Villamor Air Base in Pasay City prior to his departure,
President Marcos said the official visit to the United States is
[important because priority items for discussion include enhancing trade
and economic cooperation, particularly in light of the recently imposed
20-percent U.S. tariff]{.underline} on Philippine exports. "My visit to
Washington, D.C., and most importantly, my meeting with President Trump,
is **[essential to continuing to advance our national interests and
strengthening our alliance]{.underline}**," President Marcos said. "We
will [reaffirm our commitment to fostering our long-standing alliances
as an instrument of peace and a catalyst of development in the
Asia-Pacific region and around the world]{.underline}," the President
said. The President said the visit builds on the active exchanges that
the country has had since US President Donald Trump assumed office in
January this year. President Marcos said his top priority includes
[enhancing trade and economic cooperation]{.underline}, particularly in
light of the recently imposed 20-percent U.S. tariff on Philippine
exports. "**[I intend to convey to President Trump and his Cabinet
officials that the Philippines is ready to negotiate a bilateral trade
deal that will ensure strong, mutually beneficial, and future-oriented
collaborations that only the United States and the Philippines will be
able to take advantage of,"]{.underline}** the President said. "We will
see how much progress we can make when it comes to the negotiations with
the United States, concerning the changes that we would like to
institute, [so as to be able to alleviate the effects of a very severe
tariff schedule]{.underline}," the President said. During the visit,
President Marcos is scheduled to meet with various business leaders to
explore business opportunities that will help further stimulate the
country's economic growth. **[President Marcos' visit comes at the
formal invitation of President Trump, making him the first head of state

The [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates has [deployed its most
advanced fighter aircraft, the F-35]{.underline}, [to the Philippines
for the first time,]{.underline} a move analysts say signals
Washington's intent [to stress-test forward combat readiness in a
region]{.underline} increasingly **[shaped by China]{.underline}**'s
maritime assertiveness. The arrival of the stealth jets for the [Cope
Thunder joint air drills]{.underline} -- launched on Monday at Clark Air
Base and running until July 18 -- reflects a **[more tangible form of
deterrence]{.underline}**, experts say, **[as the Philippines becomes
further integrated]{.underline}** into America's regional defence
network. More than 2,500 personnel -- including 2,300 from the
Philippine Air Force (PAF) and 225 from the US Pacific Air Forces -- are
taking part in the exercise, which focuses on bilateral fighter
integration and enhancing allied interoperability. Lieutenant Colonel
Bryan Mussler, commander of the US 421st Fighter Squadron, told
reporters the decision to deploy the F-35s was meant to deepen
collaboration with regional partners, adding: "A [free and open
Indo-Pacific is something that we enjoy but should not take for granted
in the future years if we want to continue to deter any form of
aggression."]{.underline} While the F-35 features cutting-edge
technology including state-of-the-art sensors, Mussler stressed the
exercise was about more than showcasing hardware. "**[The F-35 is the
cornerstone of the US forces and we have a strong relationship with the
PAF. We look forward to strengthening the alliance and continuing to
integrate]{.underline}**," he said. F-35s and the PAF's FA-50 aircraft
conducted a joint patrol over the West Philippine Sea -- Manila's name
for the part of the South China Sea within its exclusive economic zone
-- to mark the start of the drills. According to Tian Xia, a Hong
Kong-based international relations analyst, the deployment shows that
[Washington is no longer relying solely on symbolic
presence.]{.underline} He described the [F-35 as]{.underline} not just a
jet but "**[a flying command node]{.underline}**" -- capable of
[gathering and sharing real-time battlefield intelligence through
advanced sensors and data links]{.underline}, allowing it to coordinate
with other forces and direct operations across air, land and sea. "Its
deployment shows that **[the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates is [stress-testing forward combat
presence]{.underline}, and the Philippines is clearly part of that
operational map," he said. "This is **[Agile Combat Employment in
action]{.underline}**," Xia added, referring to the US Air Force
doctrine that emphasises rapidly dispersing forces across a network of
smaller, often improvised bases to complicate enemy targeting.
[Philippines as forward launch pad]{.underline} Arnaud Leveau, assistant
professor of geopolitics at Paris Dauphine University, said the
deployment confirmed the [Philippines' emerging role as a frontline
state in US contingency planning, particularly under]{.underline} the
Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement ([EDCA)]{.underline}, which
**[allowed rotational deployments and materiel pre-positioning at key
Philippine military sites.]{.underline}** In 2023, [Manila granted
access to four more EDCA locations]{.underline}, bringing the total [to
nine]{.underline} -- a move that, Leveau noted, **[positioned the
country as a launch pad for US operations in both the Taiwan Strait and
the South China Sea.]{.underline}** "This is not only about geography --
it's about shaping [an operational architecture that enables early,
flexible, and credible force deployment]{.underline} from multiple
vectors," he said. Leveau said the exercise was **[accelerating the
PAF's exposure to Nato-style coordination and joint
planning.]{.underline}** "It contributes to the emergence of a shared
operational culture, which is essential for any meaningful military
cooperation in a crisis scenario," he added. [Deploying F-35s to the
Philippines was also a significant evolution of US posture in Southeast
Asia]{.underline}, he said. "This is no longer a symbolic gesture; it's
an operational signal in the context of intensifying strategic rivalry
with China. By projecting its most advanced combat aircraft to a country
traditionally at the periphery of its regional architecture, **[the US
confirms a shift towards the southern flank of the South China
Sea."]{.underline}** Building capacity and trust Vincent Kyle Parada, a
former Philippine Navy defence analyst, said recent US F-35 deployments
to theatres including the Middle East and Indo-Pacific reflected a
growing emphasis on operational readiness. "We're not just talking about
exercises or signalling here but actual combat operations," Parada told
This Week in Asia. In the case of Cope Thunder, he added, "Washington
isn't just sending these platforms out as a message -- it's an active
effort to capacitate junior allies like the Philippines and integrate
them into a broader nodal defence network". Philippines vows major
exercises in coming Balikatan military drills with US Abdul Rahman
Yaacob, a research fellow at the Lowy Institute, said the [F-35
deployment reflected a "high level of strategic trust" between
Washington and Manila,]{.underline} given how cautiously the US shared
its most advanced military assets. He said the drills offered a chance
to test how US F-35s and the Philippines' FA-50s operated together,
while also [strengthening Manila's defence capabilities to "support the
US for a potential conflict in the South China Sea or
Taiwan".]{.underline} Beijing sees Taiwan as part of China to be
reunited by force if necessary. Most countries, including the US, do not
recognise Taiwan as an independent state, but Washington is opposed to
any attempt to take the self-governed island by force and is committed
to supplying it with weapons. This month's iteration of the Cope Thunder
exercise is the second of the year, following April's joint drills
involving nearly 1,000 personnel and a deployment of F-16s -- the same
multirole jets Manila intends to acquire. "[We are testing our ability
to respond across domains by shaping scenarios that simulate contested
environments requiring flexibility, innovation and operational
depth,]{.underline}" Lieutenant General Arthur Cordura, chief of the
Philippine Air Force, said in his opening remarks. [China claims nearly
the entire South China Sea, including areas also claimed by the
Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam]{.underline}. An international
tribunal dismissed China's claims in 2016, declaring them without legal
basis -- a verdict that Beijing has consistently rejected. Manila and
the US are bound by the long-standing 1951 Mutual Defence Treaty that
calls on both sides to help each other in times of aggression by an
external power.

[This year's Balikatan]{.underline} (shoulder-to-shoulder) [exercises
between the Philippines and the U.S. have not gone exactly as
planned.]{.underline} A showcase drill in the South China Sea flopped
when a decommissioned World War II corvette, the former BRP Miguel
Malvar (PS-19), prematurely sank even before American, Filipino and
Australian troops flexed their muscle and growing military
interoperability. The decrepit warship was supposed to be targeted and
sunk off the Naval Education Training Command in San Antonio, Zambales,
by a joint naval and air force operation to showcase enhanced military
cooperation among the allied nations. [Nevertheless, the 40th
edition]{.underline} of the Balikatan exercises (BK 40-2025)
**[underscored broad continuity in Philippine-U.S. strategic relations
and, more broadly, reflected the "Asia First" orientation of the second
Trump administration's foreign policy]{.underline}**, which perturbed
traditional allies in Europe and West Asia. [Easily among the largest
joint exercises between the U.S. and any regional partner, as many as
6,000 Filipino soldiers joined 12,000 U.S. counterparts along with
troops from Japan and Australia, which have alliance treaties with
Washington and visiting forces agreements with Manila.]{.underline}
Crucially, an expanded contingent of European nations served as
observers, with the Netherlands, Poland, Lithuania and Czech Republic
joining the 'Big Three' powers of Britain, France, and Germany. In
addition to the sheer scale of the exercises, [their nature and location
are equally remarkable.]{.underline} The [weeks-long drills]{.underline}
this year, stretching from April 21 all the way to May 9, [simulated
nothing less than a \"full-scale battle scenario\" and]{.underline},
crucially, saw the deployment of advanced weapons systems by chief
participating nations. The Americans deployed the Navy-Marine
Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System (NMESIS) missile launcher while
the Filipinos used their most potent anti-ship weapon -- the South
Korean-made LIG NEX 1 C-Star \"sea-skimming\" surface-to-surface cruise
missile. [On its part, the Philippines also deployed]{.underline} its
latest batch of Indian-made Brahmos [supersonic missile system just as
the Americans signaled the possible deployment of a second Typhon
battery to the region]{.underline} despite vociferous opposition by
Beijing. **[The latest Balikatan exercises were ostensibly about
enhancing maritime security interoperability among the U.S. and its
frontline allies in Asia]{.underline}**. But it also reflected a
burgeoning "Wall of Missiles" in Western Pacific, with Washington hoping
to deploy advanced weapons systems stretching from Guam and southern
Japan all the way to northernmost provinces of the Philippines in order
to constrain China's resurgence as the dominant military power in Asia.
[Ultimately, it signals an "Asia First" continuity in Washington,
despite the second Trump administration's generally disruptive foreign
policy.]{.underline} An [Air of Continuity]{.underline} The latest
Balikatan exercises came on the heels of major developments, both
diplomatically and geopolitically. For one, it came just [weeks
after]{.underline} U.S. Defense Secretary of Defense Pete **[Hegseth's
visit to Manila, where he underscored the second Trump administration's
"iron-clad commitment" to Manila and emphasized the need for enhancing
joint "deterrence" capabilities against "Communist China's aggression in
the region."]{.underline}** Hegseth, [in continuity with the Biden
administration]{.underline}, maintained that the U.S. is "truly
prioritize\[ing\] a shift \[to Asia\], recognizing "that for the 21st
century to be a free century, [America needs to stand alongside our
allies and partners shoulder to shoulder."]{.underline} To reassure his
hosts, **[the U.S. defense chief announced the deployment of the
Navy-Marine Expeditionary Ship Interdiction System (NMESIS) for this
year's Balikatan exercises, one the biggest on the record, as well as
new major defense deals]{.underline}**. In particular, the second Trump
administration **[cleared the sale of as many as 20 F-16 fighter
jets]{.underline}** to the Philippine Airforce under a whopping \$5.58
billion contract. The deal, which is yet to be finalized, [carried huge
operational and symbolic value.]{.underline} For decades, the
Philippines has struggled to modernize its airforce capabilities due to
financial constraints, institutional corruption, shifting procurement
priorities, and lack of maintenance capabilities. "[This proposed sale
will support the foreign policy and national security of the United
States by helping to improve the security of a strategic partner that
continues to be an important force for political stability, peace, and
economic progress in Southeast Asia,]{.underline}" the U.S. Defense
Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) said in a statement. The new fighter
jet deal reportedly involves [two major variants]{.underline}, namely
[16 F-16Cs]{.underline} (single-seat, single-engine) and [four
F-16Ds]{.underline} (dual-seat jets for training purposes). Although a
fourth-generation fighter developed half-a-century earlier, the
Philippines is eying the newest block 70/72 version of the storied
fighter jet. [**Unlike its critical stance towards other treaty allies,
namely calling on Japan, Europe and Taiwan to dramatically ramp up their
defense spending, the second Trump administration has promised to expand
defense aid to the Philippines.** China has made its displeasure with
the Philippines' actions clear]{.underline}, accusing the Southeast
Asian nation of provoking tensions in the region by more overtly
aligning with America. "[Any defense and security cooperation that the
Philippines engages in with other countries should not target or harm
the interests of any third party, nor should it threaten regional peace
and security or escalate tensions in the region]{.underline}," Chinese
Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said in response to latest
U.S.-Philippine defense deals.

### UQ -- US-Philippine Cooperation Key -- 2NC

#### China's tightening its grip now -- now is key to increase US influence.

current affairs journal published in a weekly print magazine format and

heats up\",

[They came bearing gifts]{.underline}---[cash for
poverty-relief]{.underline} schemes and [shiny motorbikes for
police]{.underline} officers. But **[the Chinese ingratiating themselves
with Philippine officials were also mapping military bases, snapping
coastguard vessels and surveying power plants.]{.underline}** [Since
January the Philippines has arrested more than a dozen Chinese nationals
and alleged Filipino accomplices on charges of espionage.]{.underline}
The arrests point to operations that [blur the line between
influence-peddling and spying.]{.underline} The arrests suggest a **[new
front in China's long campaign to press the Philippines, America's
oldest military ally]{.underline}** in South-East Asia, [to come into
the Chinese orbit]{.underline}. For years, [confrontation has played out
on the S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea, where
maritime disputes have escalated. [China]{.underline} has [occupied
shoals within Philippine waters, blocked resupply vessels, rammed patrol
boats and harassed Philippine fishermen.]{.underline} A year ago a
Chinese coastguard crew armed with staves and axes boarded small naval
boats, severing a Filipino sailor's thumb. [Chinese surveillance over
the sea]{.underline}, deploying coastguard and maritime militia vessels,
drones, satellites and patrol aircraft, is [still growing]{.underline}.
On [July 1st China banned]{.underline} Francis Tolentino, who has just
stepped down as the Philippines' [Senate majority leader]{.underline},
for proposing bills to delineate his country's maritime claims: China
fumes that he has harmed its interests and undermined relations. Now
**[China is trying new ways to gain sway in the Philippines that include
spying, bribery and putting pressure on Filipinos of Chinese descent,
who number in the millions]{.underline}**. It has forced a [local
reckoning.]{.underline} The Philippines, [says]{.underline} Gilbert
[Teodoro j]{.underline}unior, [the defence secretary]{.underline}, "is a
naturally hospitable country...a trusting country". But [since the
Chinese authorities have chosen to abuse that trust, "now we're having
to disrupt their operations".]{.underline} Chinese influence operations
are [not unique to the Philippines]{.underline}. [C]{.underline}hina's
[C]{.underline}ommunist [P]{.underline}arty has long sought to [shape
elite opinion]{.underline} in other countries and gain [back-door access
to key organisations]{.underline}, often through the party's United
Front Work Department, a murky entity tasked with building authority
abroad, especially among ethnic Chinese. In [Australia and America this
approach has included attempts to get advanced tech]{.underline}nology
and to [stifle voices critical of the party's repression of Uyghurs,
Tibetans and]{.underline} democratic [Hong Kongers. **In the
Philippines**]{.underline}, by contrast, **[the goal has much to do with
the country's strategic geography]{.underline}**, says Mr Teodoro. [Its
archipelago lies at the heart of]{.underline} what naval strategists
call [the "first island chain",]{.underline} running [from the Kuril
islands north of Japan to the Malay peninsula]{.underline}. Sitting so
[close to Taiwan]{.underline} and overlooking a key channel into the
western Pacific, [**the Philippines is vital to America's efforts to
contain China.** T]{.underline}he Philippines' closest ties are with
America and its allies, such as Japan, in Asia. [Three clusters of
arrests]{.underline} have taken place this year. In January Deng
Yuanqing, a Chinese national from the Army Engineering University under
the People's Liberation Army, was arrested with two Filipinos. They were
accused of [scouting military bases used by American troops
in]{.underline} a defence arrangement known as the Enhanced Defence
Co-operation Agreement ([edca)]{.underline}, as well as [checking out
gas fields, lighthouses and petrochemical plants.]{.underline} Soon
after, five men allegedly linked to Mr Deng were arrested for [flying
drones to snoop on the Philippine navy]{.underline}. Two Chinese
nationals and three Filipinos were caught [driving through Manila near
sensitive sites in the capital]{.underline}, including the presidential
palace and the American embassy. They were allegedly using an
"imsi-catcher", a device that mimics mobile towers to intercept data.
**[They harvested thousands of communications before their
arrest,]{.underline}** according to the country's detective agency. It
is not clear which parts of the Chinese state might commission such
spying. Indeed, says Jay Batongbacal of the University of the
Philippines, **[these cases, if proven, may be instances of
"crowd-sourced espionage]{.underline}**". Those arrested appear to have
been sloppy and conspicuous. Rather than working for the party, they may
have gathered information off their own bat---for money, or hoping to
curry favour with Chinese authority. To be sure, [state-sponsored
Chinese bodies take aim at the Philippines]{.underline}. Over several
years, [Chinese hackers have targeted government agencies, including the
president's office. Among other things, they have stolen sensitive
military data to do with the disputes in the S]{.underline}outh
[C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea, according to Bloomberg, a news
agency. Last year a number of [mysterious underwater drones were
discovered,]{.underline} which Philippine officials said were
[Chinese-made]{.underline}, probably used [for
reconnaissance]{.underline}. Yet spying is only part of the strategy.
[China has quietly forged local links]{.underline}. [Local governments
are especially susceptible]{.underline} to economic inducement and
bribery, notes Rommel Ong, a retired rear admiral. Until recently, they
could strike deals with foreign actors without central oversight---an
opportunity China exploited. Sisterly love [Consider the provinces of
Palawan and Cagayan.]{.underline} Both sit in strategic spots: [Palawan
faces the S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea;
[Cagayan is less than 100km from Taiwan]{.underline}. [Both host edca
bases, have Chinese sister cities and maintain strong economic links to
China.]{.underline} While Japan, Taiwan and others also have sister
cities in the Philippines, [China has turned such arrangements from
cultural niceties into strategic footholds,]{.underline} says Aries
Arugay of the University of the Philippines. [Cagayan]{.underline} is
typical. Its [former governor]{.underline}, Manuel Mamba, [opposed the
opening of new edca sites]{.underline} and is [critical of]{.underline}
President Ferdinand "Bongbong" [Marcos's hawkish policy]{.underline}
towards China. The two newest edca sites are within the Cagayan Economic
Zone Authority (ceza), where Chinese firms predominate. Since 2011, ceza
has attracted \$140m in foreign capital, mostly from China. [Economic
dependence creates a dilemma.]{.underline} In April General Romeo
Brawner, chief of staff of the armed forces, warned that "[if something
happens in Taiwan, inevitably we will be involved." In such a scenario,
it is not clear how local leaders like Mr Mamba]{.underline} (whose
hometown has also benefited from a China-funded irrigation project)
[would respond.]{.underline} Beyond working at a local level in the
Philippines, [China has long cultivated links with Filipinos whose
ancestors emigrated from China.]{.underline} The Communist Party is
"favourably disposed" to work with people with strong ties to mainland
China, according to AidData, a research group at the College of William
and Mary in Virginia. [Connections can be used as leverage.]{.underline}
Baby Ruth [Villarama, a film-maker, experienced this]{.underline}
first-hand. She directed "[Food Delivery", a documentary about Filipino
fishermen facing Chinese obstruction in the S]{.underline}outh
[C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea. The premiere [was scheduled for a
film festival in March that was sponsored by Puregold, a
Filipino-Chinese conglomerate]{.underline} that runs supermarkets
selling low-cost products in bulk, some made in China. ["Food Delivery"
was pulled]{.underline} two days before its debut. The suspicion, says
Dr Batongbacal, is that the **[Chinese embassy applied
pressure]{.underline}**. **[As China's influence expands across the
Philippines, from local governments to cultural institutions, more
Filipinos may discover that speaking out, if China has anything to do
with it, comes at a cost.]{.underline}**

[While Washington]{.underline}, D.C. [and Beijing negotiate their latest
trade truce]{.underline}, [a quieter, yet profoundly consequential
transformation is underway]{.underline} in Southeast Asia. **[ASEAN is
no longer simply navigating great power competition;]{.underline}**
it\'s [reshaping its role]{.underline} in the global order [through what
I call \'strategic multi-alignment.\']{.underline} Having operated
businesses across ASEAN for over two decades, I've observed [firsthand
how the region leverages global uncertainty into strategic
advantage]{.underline}. Kuala Lumpur\'s recent hosting of [the
ASEAN]{.underline}-Gulf Cooperation Council ([GCC) Summit and the
inaugural]{.underline} [ASEAN-GCC-China Summit illustrates the bloc\'s
multi-vector diplomacy]{.underline} in action. From non-alignment to
[strategic multi-alignment]{.underline} Unlike Cold War-era
non-alignment, which was often reactive and avoidance-based, AS**[EAN's
approach today is proactive. Strategic multi-alignment involves
cultivating multiple partnerships, not out of necessity, but as a
deliberate effort to maximize economic and geopolitical
leverage.]{.underline}** The numbers tell the story: [ASEAN's trade with
China rose approximately 15% in 2024, while trade with the United States
(US) increased 12% and with the European Union (EU) remained
stable]{.underline} at a substantial €258.7 billion, making ASEAN the
EU's third-largest trading partner outside Europe. These figures reflect
[ASEAN's ability to diversify its partnerships without compromising its
autonomy.]{.underline} Crucially, **[this is not diplomatic hedging. It
is deliberate diversification]{.underline}**. [Singapore exemplifies
this with \$8.2 billion worth of new agreements with China in 2024,
alongside deeper defence cooperation with the US and expanded trade ties
with the EU. **Bilateral deals signed by Malaysia, Vietnam, Cambodia and
Thailand with China are not signs of geopolitical allegiance. They
represent calculated moves to drive economic benefit while preserving
independence through ASEAN's collective mechanisms.**]{.underline} It
must be said, however, these bilateral arrangements sometimes create
tensions within ASEAN, particularly when member states\' individual
interests conflict with collective regional positions, as seen in
differing approaches to South China Sea disputes. **[Growth amid
fragmentation]{.underline}** In a time of global fragmentation, [ASEAN
stands out as an economic bright spot. The region is projected to grow
by 4.6% in 2024, significantly outpacing the US]{.underline} (≈
1.7--1.8%) [and the EU]{.underline} (1.1%). While this growth partly
reflects ASEAN\'s deliberate engagement strategy, it also [benefits from
structural advantages, including demographics, natural resources and
positioning in global supply chains that existed before]{.underline} the
current [multi-alignment]{.underline} approach. The [ASEAN-GCC
partnership alone is expected to generate \$50 billion in new trade
flows by 2027.]{.underline} The region's digital economy is on track to
hit \$1 trillion by 2030. According to ASEAN Investment Reports, over
the past two years, [the region has attracted more than \$400 billion in
foreign direct investment, including a record \$230 billion in 2023
alone]{.underline}. **[While traditional partners, such as China, Japan
and the US, remain major contributors, a growing share of capital is now
coming from non-traditional sources]{.underline}** --- particularly
sovereign wealth funds in the Gulf region. Middle Eastern investors are
increasingly drawn to Southeast Asia's infrastructure, energy and
digital sectors, as evidenced by recent multi-billion-dollar joint funds
and investment deals between ASEAN member states and Gulf sovereign
entities **[ASEAN economies are not being fragmented by great power
rivalries; they are actively leveraging them. The Philippines, for
example, has attracted \$12 billion in manufacturing relocations from
China since 2023, cementing its position as a competitive global
outsourcing hub.]{.underline}** Beyond manufacturing, ASEAN aims to
become a hub for the blue economy, with maritime industries already
adding \$2.4 trillion each year to regional GDP. From Singapore's
maritime technology to Indonesia's sustainable fisheries, ASEAN is
setting global benchmarks in ocean-based development. [A 'third way' in
diplomacy]{.underline} In boardrooms across Southeast Asia, the
strategic question has evolved. It is no longer \'How do we avoid taking
sides?\' but **[\'How do we benefit from all sides?\']{.underline}**
Over the past three years, [ASEAN member states have significantly
broadened their strategic portfolio by signing comprehensive
partnerships with Japan, Australia, India and South Korea.]{.underline}
These efforts have delivered tangible returns, generating over \$200
billion in new investment commitments. [Global partners are adapting to
ASEAN's terms too. China's \$15 billion infrastructure fund for ASEAN
includes local content requirements and environmental safeguards,
indicative of ASEAN's stronger negotiating position.]{.underline} During
[Malaysia's high-level engagements with Russia in mid-2025]{.underline},
officials announced [strengthened cooperation on nuclear energy,
technology transfer and energy infrastructure]{.underline}, reflected in
a nearly 63% surge in trade year-on-year in Q1 2025. Meanwhile,
Malaysia's US--Malaysia trade totalled \$80.2 billion in 2024,
underscoring its robust engagement across geopolitical divides. This is
not fence-sitting, it is **[strategic portfolio
management.]{.underline}** The outcomes are obvious. [ASEAN\'s
multi-alignment approach has enhanced its collective bargaining power,
thereby improving its leverage in comparison to traditional, bilateral
diplomatic methods. **Institutionalizing a new regional
order**]{.underline} What ASEAN has demonstrated is that [smaller and
middle powers can shape --- not just respond to --- the evolving global
architecture.]{.underline} But to sustain and scale this approach,
institutional mechanisms must evolve accordingly. Regional leaders
should focus on codifying multi-alignment strategies through permanent
secretariats, standardized trade protocols and integrated supply chain
frameworks. Initiatives like the Regional Comprehensive Economic
Partnership (RCEP), which reduced tariffs on 65% of goods within its
first 18 months, offer a blueprint. Having witnessed ASEAN's evolution,
I believe its model of **[strategic multi-alignment will increasingly be
adopted by other middle powers.]{.underline}** By 2030, I expect
[ASEAN]{.underline} to [broker multilateral agreements that bypass
traditional power centres entirely, redefining diplomacy for a
multipolar world]{.underline}, if it can overcome internal divisions and
maintain relevance as the power competition intensifies. A pragmatic
path forward What we are seeing in ASEAN is a **[shift away from
ideological alignment towards pragmatic, interest-based
engagement.]{.underline}** In a world marked by fragmentation and
polarization, this may be one of the most [**viable strategies for
ensuring regional stability and global resilience.** The success of
strategic multi-alignment depends on maintaining the delicate balance
between competing interests while preserving internal
cohesion]{.underline}. As great power competition intensifies, ASEAN
will face increasing pressure to take sides on issues where neutrality
becomes impossible. The bloc\'s ability to navigate these pressures
while maintaining its strategic autonomy will ultimately determine
whether multi-alignment remains a viable model for other middle powers
to follow. The world is not just watching ASEAN. It may soon be
following its lead, but only if ASEAN can demonstrate that its approach
remains sustainable under mounting geopolitical pressures.

The [U.S. wants to bolster its relations in the Indo-Pacific to guard
against China]{.underline}, but it will have to navigate an environment
that's been stunned by the economic blows dealt by President Donald
Trump's protectionist trade policies. Secretary of State Marco [Rubio is
on his first official trip to Asia this week to attend the
annual]{.underline} Association of Southeast Asian Nations (**[ASEAN)
regional security conference in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.]{.underline}**
The State Department said Rubio will focus on "[reaffirming the United
States' commitment to advancing a free, open, and secure
Indo-Pacific]{.underline} region," rather than on tariffs or trade. The
conference, though, will be attended by officials from a number of the
countries targeted by new tariff rates set to go into effect next month.
Earlier this week, [Trump announced 25% tariffs on two key partners,
Japan and South Korea---which are not members of ASEAN but do have
delegations attending the conference---after negotiations failed to
materialize deals.]{.underline} On Wednesday, [Trump also unveiled an
increased to 20% tariff on the Philippines, an ASEAN member and
longstanding U.S. treaty ally. He also shared new tariff rates on ASEAN
members Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar and
Thailand, effective Aug. 1. Meanwhile, Vietnam---one of three countries
worldwide to cut a deal with Trump---will be tariffed at a 20%
rate.]{.underline} Tariffs have already been at the center of ASEAN
talks, which began Tuesday. "[This meeting takes place amid the
unravelling of assumptions, where power unsettles principle, and calm
can no longer be taken for granted. The global order is
fraying]{.underline}," Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said in
his opening remarks on Wednesday. "Tools once used to generate growth
are now wielded to pressure, isolate and contain." "Tariffs, export
restrictions and investment barriers have now become the sharpened
instruments of geopolitical rivalry," he said. **[Calling on ASEAN
countries to strengthen trade with each other, he added: "This is no
passing storm."]{.underline}** Anwar told reporters after his opening
speech that Malaysian officials were "in [the midst of
negotiations]{.underline}" with the U.S. and that he plans to "raise
some of these issues for his consideration" when he meets Rubio
Thursday. [U.S. seeking stronger security ties in Southeast
Asia]{.underline} U.S. officials have sought to [reaffirm security
commitments to Southeast Asia, even as the U.S. under Trump has
withdrawn from and rolled out apparent punitive measures towards many
countries]{.underline} in the region. In January, [Rubio "underscored
the United States' ironclad commitments to the Philippines" under the
countries' M]{.underline}utual [D]{.underline}efense
[T]{.underline}reaty in a [call about China's "dangerous and
stabilizing" actions in the S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina
[S]{.underline}ea. That same month, he [also spoke with Vietnam's Deputy
Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Bui Thanh Son about China's
"aggressive behavior" in the disputed sea.]{.underline} The [U.S. held
joint maritime drills with the Philippines earlier this year as usual
and signalled further commitment with the presence of USS George
Washington in the S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina
[S]{.underline}ea last week. Earlier this month, [Rubio met with "the
Quad"]{.underline}---officials from Australia, India, and Japan---in an
attempt to **[shift U.S. attention towards the Asia-Pacific after
Trump's military intervention in the Middle East.]{.underline}** A
senior State Department official told the AFP that these sorts of
[affirmations are "in America's interest."]{.underline} But Trump
himself has put U.S. commitments to international partners in doubt,
including rolling back U.S. involvement in the Asia-Pacific region. The
shuttering of USAID put at risk the lives of millions of people in
dozens of low- and middle-income countries, including several in
Southeast Asia. USAID emergency responders in Myanmar were told to go
home as the country was rocked by the aftereffects of a massive quake in
April. And many reconciliation projects meant to address the worst
effects of the Vietnam War were forced to halt due to funding and

The simple fact is that peace in the Indo-Pacific and even the wider
world will be held hostage to one man with totalitarian control,
messianic ambition, strategic impatience, and implacable resolve.
*[Xi]{.mark} has [made unification with Taiwan]{.mark} the signature
issue of his tenure. He now calls it the* [**[essence]{.underline}**
*of* **[national rejuvenation]{.underline}**]{.mark}*.* For years, his
domestic speeches have been grooming officials, the military, and the
public for a "great struggle" and "major test" that will require
extraordinary sacrifice. At every turn, he dares them to fight and be
good at fighting. At a meeting with Biden in late 2023, Xi stated,
"Look, peace is ... all well and good, but at some point we need to move
towards resolution."

*Xi's most critical choices [reflect a ]{.mark}*[**[march to
war]{.underline}**. *Leadership changes*]{.mark} at the 20th Party
Congress in late 2022, for example, *turned the Politburo into a body
more* **[[akin to a war cabinet]{.underline}]{.mark}***.* *Fifteen of
its 24 members now have* **[Taiwan-related experience]{.underline}**.
Included in this cadre is the most recent former eastern theater
commander --- the general responsible for executing a Taiwan fight ---
who was leapfrogged to the Politburo without being a prior member of the
Central Committee.

As disturbing, th*e war machine of the [P]{.mark}eople's
[L]{.mark}iberation [A]{.mark}rmy* **[[continues to
modernize]{.underline}]{.mark}** *at a sprint in every area.* China's
*[hyper-militarization represents]{.mark} the [greatest build-up of arms
since the]{.mark} end of the [Cold W]{.mark}ar.* In 2020, *Xi
accelerated significant military milestones from 2035 to 2027 because he
wanted China's military to* **[modernize faster]{.underline}** *and give
him Taiwan options earlier*. The People's Liberation Army has *since
built vast* **[[underground complexes]{.underline}]{.mark}***, a*
**[modernized]{.underline}** *and* **[proliferated]{.underline}** *space
layer, t[hick ]{.mark}***[[aircraft and air
defenses]{.underline}]{.mark}***, and the world's* **[[largest
navy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. China also created a Strategic Support
Force, which integrates space, electronic warfare, and cyber
capabilities. And *it boasts the [most ]{.mark}*[**[active and
sophisticated]{.underline}** *ballistic missile force*]{.mark} *in the
world.*

*China is concurrently [building up]{.mark} its* **[[nuclear triad at a
gallop]{.mark}.]{.underline}** China aims to neutralize any possible
American nuclear advantage in a crisis in order to devolve a fight to
conventional forces where China thinks it might have the edge. The
former commander of U.S. Strategic Command, Adm. Charles Richard,
repeatedly called China's nuclear force advances "breathtaking,"
"explosive," and a "strategic breakout." Their nuclear missile, warhead
expansion, launch-on-warning, silo construction, and orbital bombardment
developments are all part of Xi's broader push through the 2020s to get
ready for a potential major power confrontation.

On top of this, *[Xi]{.mark} has been* [**[deploying more military
forces]{.underline}** *nearer to Taiwan*]{.mark} *to*
**[reduce]{.underline}** *Taipei's* **[warning time]{.underline}**,
*practice in anticipated wartime areas,* **[demonstrate]{.underline}**
*supposed Chinese military* **[superiority]{.underline}***, and*
**[slowly exhaust]{.underline}** *and demoralize the Taiwan military.*
In U.S. parlance, these acts are akin to warm-start efforts at
"softening the battlespace" for follow-on action. Employing a boiling
frog tactic, China aims to condition Taiwan to an ever-increasing number
of forces surrounding the island. Additional patrol patterns east of
Taiwan are a form of psychological warfare attempting to highlight
China's power to cut off resupply lifelines. Meanwhile, the *Chinese
military has also been intensifying the scope and scale of exercises*
[**[practicing simulated assaults]{.underline}** *on Taiwan*]{.mark}*,
which last many months on China's eastern coast each year.*

At the strategic level, [*China* **[dropped "peaceful
reunification]{.underline}***" as*]{.mark} *its longstanding [official
approach to resolving]{.mark} the [Taiwan]{.mark} issue. Xi has passed
new laws allowing the nationalization of foreign assets in wartime and
stronger measures for nationwide civilian mobilization, including more
societal drills, to improve support of the People's Liberation Army in
wartime*. *Efforts to boost food and energy security are well under way,
and [China]{.mark} is [building ]{.mark}*[**[overland
pipelines]{.underline}** *and* **[coal-fired
plants]{.underline}**]{.mark} *with renewed fervor [in anticipation
of]{.mark} [limiting]{.mark} the [impact of]{.mark} expected*
[**[foreign maritime interdiction]{.underline}** *of oil and
gas*]{.mark} *during any conflict.* China has been building its
strategic petroleum reserves for years in above- and below-ground
facilities well beyond nominal nation-state peacetime buffers. At the
same time, *[Beijing]{.mark} has* **[[deepened its
alliances]{.mark}]{.underline}** *to secure flows from global energy
providers, notably Russia, Gulf Cooperation Council states, Iran, Iraq,
Angola, Brazil, and others.*

*Xi's* [**[absolute prioritization]{.underline}** *of* **[security over
the economy]{.underline}**]{.mark} *is perhaps the most telling of all
war preparation indicators*. In the last 18 months alone, *Xi has
undertaken [massive efforts to
]{.mark}***[[insulate]{.underline}]{.mark}** *the Chinese*
[**[economy]{.underline}** *from*]{.mark} *potential [external
vulnerabilities]{.mark}*, stressing self-reliance at the expense of
growth. This strategic shift is not just related to trade wars,
perceived supply chain vulnerabilities, or de-risking dynamics. Xi seems
to have studied the sanctions playbook the West used against Russia over
Ukraine and subsequently initiated long-lead protective measures to
batten down the hatches of China's economy to resist similar pressure.
In contrast to the milquetoast pushback from the other leading powers
after China put Hong Kong under its boot, *Xi likely knows attempting to
assimilate Taiwan would lead to much fiercer global resistance and
harsher whole-of-society repercussions that would likely last years. And
he intends to ready China to endure them.*

In addition to the extraordinary measures Xi has already undertaken to
protect Chinese supply chains, cyber security, and critical
infrastructure, China may be quietly reducing exposure of its foreign
exchange reserves. *Steady declines in Chinese holdings of U.S. Treasury
bonds since 2018 (from \$1.2 trillion to less than \$800 billion*)
roughly parallel year-on-year increases held by Belgium and Luxembourg,
suggesting China may be shifting the financial custodianship of its
American bonds. If true, this would presumably serve as a layer of
protection against Washington directly capturing China's reserves in
wartime. *It remains unclear if China's shift to U.S. agency bonds (held
by government-sponsored enterprises instead of the U.S. Treasury) may
also be a protective measure. These moves would make sense considering
Xi's order to Chinese banks in May 2022 to reevaluate risk and insulate
against possible "severe U.S. sanctions." Guidance like this might also
explain other curiosities such as why China, as the world's largest
producer of gold, has been buying gold on global markets for 16 straight
months.* Economists who tend to attribute these financial moves solely
to diversification, de-dollarization, or increasing the yuan's value may
be missing the forest for the trees. These measures would also help
shock-proof China from cyclopedic sanctions stemming from a Taiwan
conflict.

[*All strategic war preparation indicators are* **[brightly
lit]{.underline}***,*]{.mark} *but the most telling is [Xi's willingness
to breach]{.mark} the [C]{.mark}hinese [C]{.mark}ommunist
[P]{.mark}arty's [covenant]{.mark} with the Chinese people established
45 years ago to allow China the freedom to get rich.* *Xi has
[deliberately switched]{.mark} the party's mandate [from]{.mark}
enabling China's [economic vitality]{.mark} and building up
[comprehensive national power]{.mark} in a stable ecosystem to the
securitization of everything and tightening down in anticipation of
"reunifying the motherland" and preparing to recover Taiwan at the
expense of that power.* Xi's charm offensive with the White House and
attempts to curry favor with U.S. corporate leaders reflect less a
re-prioritization of economic imperatives to the top billing than an
experiential insight that many profit-myopic Americans can still be
played to China's advantage and induced into business-as-usual
complacency during Xi's crucial combat preparation years. *China would
classically call this approach wielding "***[a hidden knife behind a
smile"]{.underline}** *and ultimately "killing with a borrowed sword."*

### AT: SCS Defense

#### [Ceding]{.underline} the SCS causes [US-China war]{.underline}.

**Lin 15**---(Canadian War Studies -- Royal Military College, B.A. in
Political Science -- McGill University). Shaohan Lin. "After the Pivot
to the Asia-Pacific: Now what?". Journal of Military and Strategic
Studies, Vol. 16, Issue 2.

A holistic examination of the pivot shows a mixed record; Chinese
behaviour has not improved, but has remained well within the margins of
tolerance. Despite partial fulfillment of objectives, the pivot should
be sustained. One topic that is repeatedly played out in Sino-US
relations is the search for common ground in order to facilitate
cooperation and understanding. Ironically, the pivot, even as a policy
targeting China in mind, provides just that. After three years, both the
US and China should realize that their interests need not to clash.
**[[The US]{.underline}]{.mark}** has two unquestionable interests in
the region. First, it **[[needs to ensure]{.mark} that [China's rise
remains]{.mark}]{.underline}** as **[[peaceful]{.mark}]{.underline}** as
possible[[.]{.mark}]{.underline} The US understands that not much can be
done to thwart its economic development and military procurement; it can
only hope to induce docility and responsibility in China so that power
transition can occur smoothly. Second, [**the US must guarantee
stability in the Asia-Pacific**.]{.underline} This condition is crucial
for two reasons. **[Stability allows the US to continue
its]{.underline}** old Hamiltonian [tradition of trade. [The
**S**]{.mark}**outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea [is a major economic
artery]{.mark}**]{.underline} [for the US, [as]{.mark} more than
\$[**1.2 trillion** of]{.mark} its [trade passes through]{.mark} this
region[.]{.mark}]{.underline}62 The event of war, or even [**[violent
resolution of]{.mark} territorial [claims]{.mark}**[,
would]{.mark}]{.underline} severely [[endanger]{.mark} the
back-and-forth of [American goods.]{.mark}]{.underline} Approximately
[[two centuries ago, the US fought **tooth and nail** to]{.mark} secure
this part of the world to [**facilitate trade**.]{.mark} Now that the
economies of the region are blossoming, it should be expected that the
US **stays to profit** as much as possible.]{.underline} The other
reason is that stability implies that the US needs not to choose sides.
[The moment]{.underline} that [the **S**outh **C**hina **S**ea
dispute]{.underline} (or disagreement over Taiwan sovereignty)
[escalates into no-holds-barred hostilities]{.underline}, smaller
[[claimants would **call upon the US**]{.mark} for assistance[. Because
of]{.mark}]{.underline} multiple **[[alliance
treaties]{.underline}]{.mark}** and security partnerships that it signed
in the region, [[the US may be]{.underline}]{.mark} possibly [**[drawn
in]{.mark}**to a war against the Chinese[.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Evidently, this war is one that the US would loath to fight, for the
many reasons mentioned earlier. Yet, the US will face credibility issues
if it refuses to participate in this hypothetical conflict.
**[Asian-Pacific states]{.underline}**, including the nuclear-capable
Japan, **[have depend]{.underline}**ed **[on American security
guarantees]{.underline}** since the Cold War[.]{.underline} In the event
of a military conflict involving China as the clear aggressor, a **[meek
US response]{.underline}** would [compel these states **to
conclude**]{.underline} that [**the American security umbrella cannot be
depended on**.]{.underline} Considering the perpetuating bitter feuds
between various states in the region, **[an Asia-Pacific with a surging
China without American safeguards]{.underline}** may quickly **[devolve
into an arms race with]{.underline}** the possibility of [**nuclear
escalation**.]{.underline} Jeffersonians may be ambivalent with this
outcome; they would probably assert that a war in Asia should be fought
among Asians, and that Americans have no inherent interest in getting
entangled in it. However, in the face of American inactivity, Asian
states may also choose to bandwagon with China. Just like the US, these
states enjoy many benefits with China, and would be deathly afraid of
warring against it. A sudden continental swing in favour of China would
empower it immensely. This zero-sum scenario in which the US would get
the short end of the stick would give the Jeffersonians much to mull
over. China's interests in the region are mostly centered on economic
and nationalistic considerations. **[[China covets]{.mark} large swaths
of [the S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea]{.underline}** in
order [[to]{.mark} have full [access]{.mark} to enormous **reserves of
[oil]{.mark}** underneath its seabed[.]{.mark} **Securing
[trade]{.mark}**]{.underline}, while a given, is a crucial interest as
well[[. **Virulent nationalism** also compels China]{.underline}]{.mark}
to contest the Senkaku Islands with Japan and challenge Taiwan's
sovereignty[[.]{.mark}]{.underline} The American position is not
fundamentally calibrated against China. Regarding Taiwan, for example,
the US has repeatedly assured China that it does not support de jure
independence. As for the South China Sea, China's aspirations in the
region do not impinge on US interests because the US is not a claimant.
The US has pledged neutrality over the dispute and is thus unconcerned
about which state ultimately obtains sovereignty over the South China
Sea.63 The US understands that, regardless of the victor, it will retain
its unlimited access to this trade route. Worries that a victorious
China would bar entrance to the US are unwarranted. Recent Sino-US
economic deals should be ample evidence that China would not deprive
itself of its most important export market. What draws the US and China
together is a mutual interest in preventing the escalation of conflicts
in the Asia-Pacific. Similarly to the US, the region is China's
lifeblood to trade as well. However, this joint desire in maximizing
trade needs not to be conflictual as it is, by nature, a positive sum
game. The only issue, then, that can endanger Sino-US relations is
trust, or lack thereof. This is nothing new, as leaders of both states
consistently advocate that the future of Sino-US relations depends on
progress in transparency, candidness and common understanding. With
deep-seated disagreements and diametric convictions plaguing Sino-US
relations, one can expect that this ideal endpoint will not be reached
anytime soon. In the meantime, both the US and China can find solace in
**[the pivot]{.underline}**. In effect, this initiative **[has
restricted the range of actions of both states]{.underline}**, thereby
[**increasing predictability in the region**.]{.underline} As repeatedly
mentioned, [**the US must "hedge" against China**. It **cannot leave
lest it loses all credibility**. Leaving **will**]{.underline} also
[**be synonymous of giv**ing **the green light for China to act however
it wants**.]{.underline} As for China, it knows that the Americans have
their hands tied by "pivoting" towards the Asia-Pacific. It also knows
that the US does not want to confront China, nor is it adamant about a
specific victor in the plethora of territorial disputes in the
Asia-Pacific. The US' ability to turn a blind eye on small-scale
violence (e.g. ship harassment) gives China the leeway it needs to
unilaterally operate in the region. China merely needs to ensure that
its behaviour, as aggressive as it is, does not escalate into fully
armed conflicts. For the past three years, China has managed tensions
with other claimants quite well, signing agreements for peaceful
resolutions at one point and "peacefully" occupying claimed territories
at another. As long as hostilities are minimized, the US needs neither
to confront China nor to risk its credibility. Evidently, the US is
satisfied with the current situation. In sum, [[despite]{.mark} the
exchange of **[rhetorical opprobrium]{.mark}** between these states,
[both sides have reached a]{.mark} **[tacit agreement]{.mark}** only
[made possible by]{.mark} **upholding [the pivot]{.mark}**[. As long
as]{.mark} the **[Asia]{.mark}-Pacific [remains
secure]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which is in the interest of both the US
and China, [**[there will be no]{.mark} room for [intentional Sino-US
escalation]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} The US gets to keep its
face. Asian-Pacific states get to feel safe. [China will be **kept
down**]{.underline}, but will probably win its territorial contests
through "peaceful" means. Different beds, same dream.

Kevin R. Baker, What Would Happen if China and Japan Went to War?, 2012,

http://45.76.232.54/what-would-happen-if-china-and-japan-went-to-war/

[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} is not an isolationist country but it
[[is]{.mark} **quite [nationalistic]{.mark}**. Their **allies include**,
**Russia**]{.underline}, which is a big super power, [**Pakistan**
and]{.underline} Iran as well as **[North Korea]{.underline}**. They
have more allies than Japan, although most relations have been built on
economic strategies, being a money-centric nation.

[[Countries]{.mark} potentially **[hostile]{.mark} toward China** in the
**event of a Japan vs. China war** [include **Germany**, **Britain**,
**Australia** and]{.mark} **South [Korea]{.mark}**]{.underline}. So
[even though Japan does not outwardly build relationships]{.underline}
with allies, [**Japan would have allies rallying around them** if China
were to attack Japan.]{.underline}

[The **island dispute would not play out** as it did in the **UK vs.
Argentina** island dispute, **as both sides could cause massive damage
to each other**, whereas the UK was far superior in firepower compared
to Argentina.]{.underline}

Conclusion

[Even though China outweighs Japan in numbers, [the]{.mark}
**likelihood** that a **[war would develop into a nuclear war]{.mark}**
means that numbers don't really mean anything anymore]{.underline}. The
nuclear capabilities of Japan and China would mean that [each country
could **destroy each other many times over**. The **island dispute**
[would]{.mark} then [escalate to]{.mark}]{.underline} possible **[mass
[extinction for the human race]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

[The [**nuclear fall out** would **affect**]{.mark} **most of [Asia
and]{.mark}**]{.underline} to a certain extent **[[the
West]{.underline}]{.mark}**. If the allies were then to turn on each
other [it would **spell the end of the human race**]{.underline}. [Bear
in mind that [it will take]{.mark} an estimated **[10,000
years]{.mark}** for Chernobyl [to become safe to walk]{.mark} around and
you'll get an idea of **what state land masses will be in** after a war
of such magnitude]{.underline}. I say 'land masses' as
[countries]{.underline} and nations [would cease to exist]{.underline}
then [and]{.underline} it would be a case of 'if' and 'where' could
[human beings, plant life and animals]{.underline} could exist, if at
all possible, which is very doubtful. [**[Even with]{.mark} underground
[bunkers]{.mark}**, just [**how long** could people survive]{.mark} down
there? **With plant and animal life eradicated** above?]{.underline} I
would say [maybe [20 years **at best**]{.mark}, if there are ample
supplies]{.underline} of course.

bilateral economic deal. In a letter to President Marcos, Trump said the
US has to **[move away from "long-term and very persistent trade
deficits engendered by the Philippines' tariff and non-tariff policies
and trade barriers.]{.underline}**" He argued that the **[relationship
between the Philippines and the US has been "far from
reciprocal."]{.underline}** "**[Starting on August 1, 2025, we will
charge the Philippines a tariff of only 20 percent on any and all
Philippine products sent to the United States, separate from all
sectoral tariffs. Goods transshipped to evade a higher tariff will be
subject to that higher tariff]{.underline}**," Trump said in the letter
dated July 9. The new rate is [higher than the 17 percent tariff that
was supposed to be imposed on Philippine merchandise exports when Trump
announced the policy]{.underline} last April. **[It was adjusted upwards
despite earlier efforts by Philippine trade officials to meet with their
US counterparts to relay the concerns]{.underline}** of sectors to be
affected by the tariff regime. Similar to Trump's first batch of
documents published Monday, the tariff levels were not too far from
those originally threatened in April, although some partners received
notably lower rates this time. While the president in April imposed a 10
percent levy on almost all trading partners, he unveiled -- and then
held off on -- higher rates for dozens of economies. The deadline for
these steeper levels to take effect was meant to be Wednesday, before
Trump postponed it further to Aug. 1. Instead, [countries who face these
threats of elevated duties began receiving letters spelling out US
tariff rates on their products.]{.underline} Trump's latest messages
were near-identical to those published earlier in the week and justified
the tariffs as a response to trade ties that have been "unfortunately,
far from reciprocal." They urged countries to manufacture products in
the United States instead in order to avoid duties, while threatening
further escalation if leaders retaliated to the levies. Apart from
tariffs targeting goods from different countries, Trump has also rolled
out sector-specific duties on steel, aluminum and autos since returning
to the White House in January. On Tuesday, Trump said tariffs were
incoming on copper and pharmaceuticals as well. Philippines delegation
flies to US for negotiations Special Assistant to the President for
Investment and Economic Affairs Frederick Go expressed concern over the
adjusted tariff, but noted that the rate remains the second lowest among
all reciprocal tariffs imposed by the US on the region. The lowest rate
was the 10 percent slapped on Singapore. "But more importantly than all
of these, we remain committed to continuing negotiations with the United
States in good faith to pursue a bilateral comprehensive economic
agreement or if possible, an FTA (free trade agreement)," Go said in a
press briefing yesterday at Malacañang. Go revealed that he, Trade
Secretary Ma. Cristina Roque and Trade Undersecretaries Perry Rodolfo
and Allan Gepty would be flying to the US next week to meet with
American trade representatives, although he clarified that the trip has
been scheduled even before the announcement of the adjusted rate. For
his part, Philippine Ambassador to the US Jose Manuel Romualdez said
yesterday the "Philippines is still planning to negotiate down" the
tariff set on Philippine exports raised from 17 percent to 2 percent.
Although countries can negotiate before the Aug. 1 deadline, Trump
insisted there will be no extensions for the countries that receive
letters. Asked what went wrong in the previous negotiations with the US,
Go replied: "I think there are some posturing here, I don't think I can
comment further. But we will go there next week and we will try to bring
this down if we can." **['Major threat']{.underline}** Trump, who
claimed that [the tariff policy would support US industries and "make
America wealthy again"]{.underline} told Marcos that the [20 percent
tariff is "far less than what is needed to eliminate the trade deficit
disparity Washington has with Manila]{.underline}. **["As you are aware,
there will be no tariff if the Philippines, or companies within your
country, decide to build or manufacture product within the United States
and in fact, we will do everything possible to get approvals quickly,
professionally and routinely -- in other words, in a matter of
weeks,"]{.underline}** the American leader said. [Should the Philippines
decide to increase tariffs on US products, whatever the number it
chooses to raise them by would be added to the 20 percent]{.underline},
Trump warned.

MANILA, Philippines --- [V]{.underline}ice [P]{.underline}resident

statement that [the Philippines should "stay in the middle]{.underline}"
of the two countries in power struggle. "For the Philippines, we -- [our

policy.]{.underline} So, our relationship with the US and our
relationship with China should be two separate engagements and **[we
should not lean towards the US for our problems with China, particularly
our issues in the West Philippine Sea]{.underline}**," Duterte said in
an interview with Russia Today. ML party-list representative-elect Leila

policy in the West Philippine Sea constituted a betrayal of public
trust. "The administration of President Marcos is leaning towards the US

### UQ -- US Says No -- 2AC

#### Trump won't commit -- the "madman" in the White House is [unpredictable.]{.underline}

[**Trump is a \'madman\' with adversaries and allies** Every US
administration since the Cold War]{.underline} has [bluffed and
threatened warfare]{.underline} --- nuclear or conventional --- to serve
their strategic purposes, **[even if the goal is peace.]{.underline}**
Research in political science has suggested that for 80 years, [Russia
has believed the US stands behinds such threats of war, especially if
any other NATO member country is invaded.]{.underline} Where [Trump\'s
madman strategy]{.underline} differs to past US presidents, however, is
that **[he uses it on adversaries as well as allies]{.underline}**, said
McManus. \"Since beginning his second term, [Trump seems to be seeking
to accommodate Russia rather than using a madman strategy toward
Russia.]{.underline} Trump may instead be using a madman strategy toward
Europe,\" said McManus. His [threats to pull out of the
NATO]{.underline} alliance come with an additional, veiled threat that
[he might not defend Europe against future Russian attacks]{.underline}.
But it remains unclear what his ultimate intentions are. The
**[uncertainty embedded in his otherwise familiar rhetoric is what makes
it hard for other countries to know where they stand with
Trump.]{.underline}** **[Trump could be playing a multi-dimensional mind
game.]{.underline}** What can [the madman theory]{.underline} tell us
about Trump? The short answer is that it [tells us nothing]{.underline}
--- but that is the point. \"Trump is clearly aware of his madness
reputation and views it as an asset. Nonetheless, **[it is often unclear
to me whether Trump is deliberately employing the madman theory or just
acting on his genuine impulses,\"]{.underline}** McManus said. McManus\'
research suggests **[leaders who never follow through on their threats
will tend to lose their madness reputations.]{.underline}** \"[If Trump
follows through even some of the time on extreme threats, like he
recently did with trade tariffs, he can probably maintain his madness
reputation]{.underline},\" said McManus. And perhaps that is Trump's
biggest gamble: Playing madman with all sides in his diplomacy hinges on
whether he can keep it up. Meanwhile, **[he leaves everyone
guessing.]{.underline}**

AILSA CHANG, HOST: President **[Trump says he has already ended several
conflicts around the globe and that he is working to conclude several
more.]{.underline}** He\'s doing that by applying his love of cutting
deals to global relationships. Like, take the war between [Russia and
Ukraine]{.underline}. Just this week, he [threw his support behind a
deal for new weapons for Ukrainian defense.]{.underline} But [this is
what he said when he was asked if the decision meant he had picked a
side]{.underline} in the war. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: No, **[I\'m on nobody\'s side]{.underline}**.
I\'m the - no. UNIDENTIFIED PERSON: Why? TRUMP: I want to - you know the
side I\'m on? Humanity\'s side. CHANG: He started by saying, nobody\'s
side. So [what does this tell us about Trump\'s approach to foreign
policy?]{.underline} Well, to help us break all of this down, we\'re
joined now by NPR\'s senior White House correspondent Tamara Keith and
national security correspondent Greg Myre. Hello to both of you. TAMARA
KEITH, BYLINE: Hello. GREG MYRE, BYLINE: Hi, Ailsa. CHANG: All right.
Tam, let\'s start with you. We\'re six months now into
[Trump]{.underline}\'s second term. How would you summarize his approach
to foreign policy this time around? KEITH: Well, as you said, he is
[very focused on deals - peace deals, trade deals, deals for American
businesses]{.underline} - though many of those deals are proving elusive
so far. And he has a [personal approach.]{.underline} That is, it is
often **[about personal relationships - how he feels about the other
world leaders he\'s dealing with]{.underline}**. And then there are his
two defining slogans - peace through strength, and America first. But
slogans don\'t make a doctrine or guiding principle, and often it seems
like aides and supporters are trying to mold those slogans around his
decisions rather than the other way around. So as I was trying to make
sense of this, I called several foreign policy experts from across the
spectrum, and [John Bolton put it most bluntly. He served as national
security adviser in Trump\'s first term and says there is **no national
security grand strategy.**]{.underline} JOHN BOLTON: He made thousands
of decisions in his first term - many of which I agreed with - but
[they\'re out there like a big archipelago of dots.]{.underline} You can
try and connect the dots if you want, but **[he can\'t connect the dots.
That\'s just not the way he makes foreign policy
decisions.]{.underline}** MYRE: And you know, Ailsa, [Trump clearly
prefers the art of the deal to the art of diplomacy]{.underline}. You
know, as some people have put it, you do deals with friends or business
partners, and you do diplomacy with adversaries. But that\'s often a
very hard process. [You often have to make tough
compromises]{.underline} in what\'s a long, drawn-out process. CHANG:
Absolutely. Well, what about specific examples when it comes to wars?
Like, where can Trump claim credit for actually ending a conflict? MYRE:
Probably the [Israel-Iran]{.underline} war is the best example. Israel
launched a surprise air campaign last month, and it set off 12 days of
intense fighting. And the U.S. wasn\'t just some disinterested party
here. Trump\'s team closely coordinated with Israel, and the U.S.
carried out one night of major airstrikes. But after that, [Trump really
declared a unilateral ceasefire, and that\'s what happened, and it is
holding. His role in ending this conflict was crucial.]{.underline} Now,
we should stress that in this conflict and others, the fighting stopped
but there was no real resolution of the larger conflict. We still don\'t
know the exact status of Iran\'s nuclear program, whether Iran will try
to rebuild it quickly. And that\'s really the core issue here. CHANG:
Right. OK, well, what about a place where Trump has not had success but
definitely wants success, like the [Russia-Ukraine]{.underline} war?
MYRE: Ailsa, this is a really good example of Trump wanting a quick deal
even though it doesn\'t appear a realistic option. [He thought he could
work very swiftly with Russian leader Vladimir Putin based on years of a
friendly relationship. He was very dismissive of Ukraine\'s leader,
Volodymyr Zelenskyy]{.underline} - effectively kicked him out of the
White House back in January. But this week, we saw Trump formally adopt
a very different stance. He now seems frustrated with Putin. **[He plans
to sell weapons to NATO, which will then send them onto Ukraine, and
he\'s also threatening punitive measures against Russia if it doesn\'t
agree to Trump\'s proposed ceasefire]{.underline}**. KEITH: And I just
want to point out here that for Trump, this NATO weapons deal checks a
lot of boxes. The U.S. doesn\'t have to spend anything. American
manufacturers get to sell weapons. And in the end, Ukraine gets the
defensive weapons they were asking for. MYRE: And I just want to mention
one other conflict, and that\'s the [Israel-Hamas fighting in Gaza.
Trump actually inherited a ceasefire in Gaza when he took office in
January, but that ended with an Israeli offensive in March.]{.underline}
That conflict just keeps grinding on, and the humanitarian crisis in
Gaza is worse than it\'s ever been. CHANG: Well, what about [other
conflicts]{.underline} that Trump has taken some interest in? Do we know
where they stand? MYRE: Yeah, when Trump was talking about global
conflicts this week, **[he sort of offered this global
tour.]{.underline}** Here\'s part of what he said. (SOUNDBITE OF
ARCHIVED RECORDING) TRUMP: We\'ve been very successful in settling wars.
You have [India-Pakistan. You have Rwanda and the Congo.]{.underline}
That was going on for 30 years. India, by the way - Pakistan would have
been a nuclear war within another week, the way that was going. That was
going very badly. MYRE: So just a quick fact-check here. With
[India-Pakistan, Secretary of State Marco Rubio did jump in and mediate
a truce.]{.underline} The administration certainly deserves credit here.
But there\'s no indication this conflict was on the verge of a nuclear
war, and the ceasefire doesn\'t resolve the larger feud between these
countries, which dates back generations. And the [Trump administration
did help broker this peace agreement between Congo and Rwanda signed in
Washington three weeks ago]{.underline}. If it holds, it\'s a
significant achievement, but many deals in this conflict in the past
have collapsed. CHANG: I want to take, like, a wide lens here, Tam,
because U.S. foreign policy often is built around creating stable,
long-term relationships. And I\'m curious, do you think Trump\'s
approach could be upending expectations among U.S. allies right now?
KEITH: Well, he has certainly added uncertainty to U.S. relationships
with literally dozens of trading partners with his aggressive tariff
agenda. But **[Trump\'s view is that the rest of the world has been
ripping America off, and he\'s been saying that for decades about trade
deficits. He argues that America\'s allies have been free riders on U.S.
military might, and he makes a lot of threats. He walks a lot of them
back, but he keeps everyone walking on eggshells]{.underline}**. I spoke
to Mike Froman, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. MIKE
FROMAN: It\'s a feature, not a bug. I think he views uncertainty as
creating additional leverage, [creating some suspense]{.underline}, you
know, as to how things are likely to come out. KEITH: And with all of
this, Trump has made himself the center of attention globally. All eyes
are on him. CHANG: That is NPR\'s Tamara Keith and Greg Myre. Thank you
to both of you. KEITH: You\'re welcome. MYRE: Sure thing, Ailsa.

### UQ -- ASEAN Fractured -- 2AC

#### ASEAN won't follow on -- [fracturing,]{.underline} deals with [China]{.underline} and [internal conflicts]{.underline} prove.

[For decades]{.underline}, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
--- known as [ASEAN --- has been treated in Washington and other
capitals as a bedrock of regional stability.]{.underline} It has been a
model of consensus-driven diplomacy and [a potential counterweight to
Chinese dominance in the Indo-Pacific. **But in 2025, that image is
becoming dangerously outdated.**]{.underline} [ASEAN is no longer a
coherent political bloc.]{.underline} **[Fragmented by internal crises,
paralyzed in the face of regional threats, and unable to coordinate a
meaningful response to the great power rivalry unfolding around it,
ASEAN is collapsing --- slowly, quietly, but
unmistakably.]{.underline}** The crisis is perhaps most [vivid in
Myanmar]{.underline}, where the [military junta that seized power in
2021 is now fighting for its survival.]{.underline} **[The country is in
open civil war]{.underline}**. Resistance groups have taken control of
large parts of the borderlands, while the regime continues to commit war
crimes and ignore every diplomatic overture. [ASEAN's so-called
Five-Point Consensus --- once touted as a pathway to peace --- has
become a dead letter. The bloc has refused to suspend Myanmar's
membership, despite growing international pressure]{.underline}. Its
only action has been to exclude the junta from high-level summits, a
symbolic gesture that does nothing to halt the violence or alleviate the
suffering of civilians. Myanmar is not the only fracture. [Thailand, one
of ASEAN's founding members and once seen as a stabilizing force in the
region, is now consumed by its own political drama]{.underline}. After
the 2023 general election, [the progressive M]{.underline}ove
[F]{.underline}orward [P]{.underline}arty [won the most seats, only to
be blocked from forming a government by the military-appointed
Senate.]{.underline} In a stunning reversal, [the Pheu Thai Party ---
once the main opposition to military rule --- formed a coalition with
those same military-aligned forces. The deal returned the old guard to
power, sowing deep distrust among voters.]{.underline} Now, [that uneasy
alliance is unravelling]{.underline}. Paetongtarn [Shinawatra, daughter
of exiled former prime minister Thaksin and a prominent Pheu Thai
figure, has been suspended from parliament]{.underline} amid an
escalating scandal involving a leaked phone call with Cambodian
strongman Hun Sen. The call, widely interpreted as backchannel political
coordination, has triggered an [uproar in Bangkok]{.underline}, deepened
factional rifts within the ruling coalition, and [prompted speculation
that another military coup --- Thailand's third in two decades --- may
be on the horizon. Cambodia,]{.underline} for its part, **[is not even
pretending to operate as a democracy]{.underline}**. The 2023 [handover
of power from Hun Sen to his son, Hun Manet]{.underline}, was engineered
with [minimal transparency and no serious opposition.]{.underline}
[Phnom Penh remains one of Beijing's most loyal allies in the
region]{.underline}, frequently **[undermining ASEAN unity on issues
involving China --- especially in the South China Sea.]{.underline}**
Laos is similarly aligned with China and effectively absent from ASEAN
diplomacy. These trends are not isolated. **[They expose a deeper
structural failure: ASEAN's model of consensus, non-interference and
formal equality among states is no longer fit for
purpose]{.underline}**. It worked --- barely --- during the Cold War and
its aftermath, when the region could afford strategic ambiguity. But
today's geopolitical climate is different. Today, [the region is a front
line in U.S.-China competition]{.underline}, and [ASEAN's diplomatic
architecture is proving inadequate. It lacks a unified voice on
security, democracy, trade or technology --- the defining issues of our
time.]{.underline} The bloc's inability to act has [real consequences.
As tensions rise in the South China Sea, with Chinese maritime
aggression accelerating around the Philippines and Vietnam, ASEAN has
failed to issue even a joint statement of condemnation. As the U.S. and
its allies try to build resilient supply chains and technology
partnerships, ASEAN members are signing competing deals --- often with
China --- and undercutting each other's positions.]{.underline} Even on
trade, where ASEAN was once considered relatively cohesive, real
influ[ence has shifted elsewhere. China is now the largest trading
partner for nearly every ASEAN state,]{.underline} and the Regional
Comprehensive Economic Partnership has further institutionalized
Beijing's role at the center of regional commerce. Behind closed doors,
[ASEAN officials increasingly acknowledge the dysfunction. Some are
frustrated by the charade of unity. But the bloc's institutional design
--- a rotating chairmanship, no enforcement powers, and a culture of
diplomatic avoidance --- makes real change nearly
impossible]{.underline}. The result is **[performative
multilateralism]{.underline}**: summits that produce boilerplate
communiqués, working groups that avoid hard issues and a growing gap
between ASEAN's image and its actual influence. This **[matters for U.S.
strategy. Washington has long relied on ASEAN centrality as a foundation
for its Indo-Pacific engagement. But if ASEAN cannot function as a
reliable partner, U.S. policymakers will need to shift
course.]{.underline}** That may mean building more flexible
"mini-lateral" coalitions with individual countries like the
Philippines, Vietnam or Indonesia. It may also require confronting the
uncomfortable truth that ASEAN's decline helps Beijing, which has long
exploited the bloc's divisions to blunt regional resistance to Chinese
assertiveness. Southeast Asia remains one of the world's most dynamic
regions --- economically vibrant, demographically young and
strategically pivotal. But its central political institution is in
retreat. [ASEAN is not dead, but it has become hollow. Until its member
states and their international partners are willing to admit that
reality, the region will remain vulnerable --- not just to external
pressure, but to its own slow unravelling.]{.underline}

#### They can't even admit another member without dismantling the entire alliance. 

Vu **Lam**, **7-16-2025**, \[Dr. Vu Lam is a policy analyst and
researcher affiliated with UNSW Canberra, specialising in Southeast Asia
and Australia's Indo-Pacific engagement, \"Timor-Leste is ready for
ASEAN, but is ASEAN ready for what comes next?\", The Lowy Institute,

accessed 7/20/25, S.A.M.\]

[In October 2025]{.underline}, [ASEAN will admit Timor-Leste as its 11th
member]{.underline}. The move carries symbolic weight. It affirms
ASEAN's commitment to regional inclusion and gives long-overdue
recognition to Southeast Asia's youngest state. But this **[moment of
celebration risks obscuring what the accession reveals about the state
of the organisation itself: ASEAN is increasingly fragmented,
overstretched and constrained by its own foundational
principles.]{.underline}** While much has been said about the logistical
and institutional challenges Timor-Leste faces, equally important is
[whether ASEAN can meaningfully integrate a fragile member without
deepening its own institutional fatigue.]{.underline} That challenge
**[arrives at a time when ASEAN is already struggling to navigate a more
polarised, unequal and contested region.]{.underline}** So, perhaps [the
real question is]{.underline} not whether Timor-Leste is ready for
ASEAN, but whether [ASEAN is ready for what comes next.]{.underline}
Timor-Leste's aspirations to join ASEAN are longstanding. For Dili,
membership opens the door to regional economic frameworks, notably the
Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), and offers access to
development cooperation and diplomatic visibility. But the capacity gap
is substantial. Timor-Leste's bureaucracy is still consolidating, and
its economy remains heavily dependent on petroleum revenues. Even
President José Ramos-Horta has acknowledged that full institutional
readiness is a long-term goal, not a near-term reality. For ASEAN, this
is not a new dilemma. [Past accessions]{.underline}, including Cambodia
in 1999, Laos and Myanmar in 1997, similarly [placed political inclusion
ahead of institutional alignment]{.underline}. The underlying assumption
was that integration would catalyse convergence. But decades later, that
promise remains unfulfilled. **[Institutional divergence has grown, not
shrunk, and ASEAN's ability to function as a coherent community has
eroded in turn. Myanmar, for instance, presently led by the military,
has objected to Timor-Leste's accession.]{.underline}** What makes
Timor-Leste's accession different is the context. [ASEAN is no longer a
bloc of ten semi-aligned postcolonial states finding common ground. It
is now a far more internally diverse and externally exposed
organisation.]{.underline} **[Admitting another underprepared member
without strengthening ASEAN's integrative tools risks compounding the
very weaknesses that make the grouping increasingly
brittle.]{.underline}** Timor-Leste's accession is more than a regional
milestone. It is a mirror that reflects both the strength of ASEAN's
vision and the fragility of its current form. Economically, [ASEAN
remains far from achieving its vision of a single market and production
base.]{.underline} Intra-ASEAN trade continues to hover around 20--25%
of total trade, and regulatory harmonisation remains challenges despite
various facilitation frameworks. [The ASEAN-X model, while enabling
pragmatic flexibility, has entrenched a two-speed system that may
undermine integrative ambitions.]{.underline} An example is that while
the six founding members (**[ASEAN-6) achieved tariff reductions,
Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam have moved at a slower pace thanks
to their differentiated levels of development.]{.underline}**
Diplomatically, the [Myanmar crisis has further exposed ASEAN's
limits]{.underline}. The [Five-Point Consensus,]{.underline} once seen
as a modest starting point, [has stalled]{.underline}, with no
enforceable commitments and little appetite for acceleration. [The junta
continues to defy ASEAN's nominal pressure with impunity.]{.underline}
Rather than mediate or isolate, [**ASEAN has defaulted to
exclusion-without-action, suspending high-level engagement with Myanmar
but offering no meaningful alternative.** In the S]{.underline}outh
[C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea, [ASEAN faces a familiar impasse.
Member states are split between claimants and fence-sitters. China
continues to exploit these divisions through bilateral deals, economic
inducements and political influence, especially with Cambodia and
Laos.]{.underline} The long-awaited Code of Conduct remains
aspirational. ASEAN's strength as a convenor has not translated into
strength as a collective actor. Even internal disputes reveal
institutional gaps. The leaked phone call incident between Thailand and
Cambodia escalated into a domestic crisis in Thailand, a formal
investigation and the suspension of the Thai Prime Minister. With the
Thai government facing possible collapse, the episode has severely
strained bilateral relations. Yet ASEAN remained silent, offering no
platform for de-escalation. These are not isolated setbacks. [**ASEAN's
current operating model, centred on consensus and non-interference, is
insufficient for the scale of the problems it now faces.** The "ASEAN
Way", with its emphasis on informal diplomacy, consensus, and
non-intervention, has long been credited with keeping peace in a diverse
region. And rightly so. But norms that once enabled cohesion now often
obstruct it. Consensus gives every member a veto, leading to inaction on
issues that demand urgency. Non-interference, once a shield against
external imposition, has become a barrier to addressing crises within.
Timor-Leste's]{.underline} accession will likely reinforce this dynamic.
Its [dependence on Chinese-backed infrastructure and economic support
could complicate ASEAN's already-fractured positions on regional
geopolitics.]{.underline} Or its democratic credentials could unsettle
ASEAN's internal balance, where democratic norms, though officially
encoded, are often downplayed in favour of regional cohesion and
consensus. If the bloc cannot coordinate responses to existing tensions,
adding another diplomatically unpredictable member may further dilute
its ability to act.

help us in any way," he said. "[**We try to exhaust all possible options
that we have before we ask for help."** Manila and Washington are bound
by the 1951-Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT), a military pact that can be
invoked in the case of armed attacks on Philippine forces, public
vessels, or aircraft in the S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina

and China in Asia\'s most contested waters have [increased in
frequency]{.underline} over the past year as [Beijing has pressed its
claim to the waterway]{.underline} and Manila continued missions to
bring supplies to soldiers living aboard a rusty, aging warship that it
grounded on a contested shoal. Some observers, including former deputy
US National Security Adviser Matt Pottinger, have called for direct US
naval support for the resupply missions. But [Philippine National
Security Adviser Eduardo Ano said the Philippines wanted them to be a
"pure Philippine operation".]{.underline} "**[This is our legitimate
national interest, so we don't see any reason for them (the US) to come
in]{.underline}**," Ano told Reuters. Ano, who spoke to his U.S
counterpart Jake Sullivan last month to discuss shared concerns over
China's \"dangerous and escalatory actions\", said **[the MDT was "far
from being invoked]{.underline}**". \"We ([the Philippines and
China]{.underline}) **[agreed that there will be some easing tension,
but we will assert our rights, we will not compromise our national
interest, and we will continue to fight and claim what is
ours]{.underline}**,\' Ano said.

### I/L -- Indo-Pac focus fails

#### No amount of diplomatic capital can salvage the fractured relationship Trump has in the Indo-Pacific.

<https://thediplomat.com/2025/06/how-president-trump-lost-the-indo-pacific/>,
accessed 7/20/25, S.A.M.\]

U.S. President Donald [Trump's approach to the Indo-Pacific has been
defined less by strategic foresight than by political
undoing.]{.underline} In his first term, he **[withdrew the United
States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, exited the Paris Climate
Agreement, sidelined ASEAN, and undermined multilateral
diplomacy.]{.underline}** Now [in his second term,]{.underline} [the
pattern continues]{.underline}. He **[withdrew from the Paris agreement
-- again. The Pentagon has launched a formal review of AUKUS, the
trilateral alliance of Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United
States. The Indo-Pacific Economic Framework has been deprioritized.
Washington has gone quiet on the Quad, and regional diplomacy has been
reduced to slogans.]{.underline}** Rather than offering a
forward-looking strategy, [Trump is dismantling what remains of the
Obama and Biden administrations' Indo-Pacific legacy]{.underline}. In
trying to erase his predecessors' record, [he is creating a vacuum
filled not by U.S. alternatives, but by confusion, resentment, and
retreat.]{.underline} As a result, Southeast Asia, long a focal point of
great power attention, is learning to move forward without the United
States. One of the [clearest expressions of this reversal]{.underline}
came on April 2, when [Trump declared "Liberation Day" and announced
sweeping "reciprocal tariffs" on nearly every U.S. trade
partner]{.underline}. Although a 90-day pause on the "reciprocal
tariffs" was later introduced, Trump kept in place a 10 percent
universal tariff. [The announcement sent a shockwave through Southeast
Asia. Under the original formula, Cambodia was hit with a 49 percent
tariff, Laos 48 percent, Vietnam 46 percent, Myanmar 44 percent,
Thailand 36 percent, and Malaysia and Brunei 24 percent. Even the
Philippines, a U.S. treaty ally, faced a 17 percent tariff]{.underline}.
These measures were not guided by clear economic logic. [They were
political pressure tactics]{.underline}, and they damaged trust and
undermined the United States' credibility as a stable economic partner.
[Key industries were not spared]{.underline} from the uncertainty.
[Malaysia and Vietnam together account for over 30 percent of U.S.
semiconductor imports. Although semiconductors were temporarily exempted
from the tariff list, the Trump administration has since floated new
tariffs of up to 25 percent on components such as GPUs and AI server
chips. This unpredictability calls into question U.S. claims to champion
supply chain resilience. In Southeast Asia, economic engagement is
increasingly being viewed not as partnership but as leverage.
China,]{.underline} by contrast, [responded with a calculated show of
diplomacy. Within two weeks of the tariff announcement, President Xi
Jinping visited Malaysia, Vietnam, and Cambodia -- three of the
countries hardest hit by Trump's tariffs. His visit to Malaysia, the
current ASEAN chair, sent a clear message that Beijing is stepping into
the space Washington is vacating]{.underline}. Unlike [the United
States, which now vacillates between coercion and indifference, China is
offering consistent, if self-interested, engagement.]{.underline}
Southeast Asia is not naïve about China's intentions, but it is
pragmatic. And right now, China is showing up. Strategic concerns are
also growing. The Pentagon's review of AUKUS has stirred anxiety among
regional governments. While officials insist the review is routine, it
is difficult to separate it from Trump's broader skepticism of
alliances. In a region where deterrence depends on long-term
commitments, even a hint of retrenchment invites uncertainty. Many in
Southeast Asia are quietly asking: if the United States is reconsidering
its security priorities, what will it still defend? This [uncertainty
deepened during Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth's keynote address at
the 2025 Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore]{.underline}. Hegseth
projected strength, spoke of deterrence, and declared the United States
was "here to stay." But [his speech lacked substance and
sensitivity]{.underline}. When referencing global threats, he described
the events in Gaza as "Islamist terror on October 7th in Israel," while
praising U.S. resolve in Ukraine. He condemned Russian aggression but
made no mention of Israel's military campaign or the humanitarian crisis
in Gaza. This silence stood out. [In Muslim-majority countries like
Brunei, Malaysia, and Indonesia, his framing appeared condescending and
hypocritical. To decry civilian suffering in Ukraine while ignoring it
in Palestine undermines U.S. credibility. Just as striking was the
omission of Myanmar -- where a long-running conflict has destabilized
Southeast Asia, displaced thousands, and fractured ASEAN
unit]{.underline}y. While Hegseth focused on faraway wars, [he said
nothing about the crisis in Washington's declared priority theater. **To
many in the region, the message is now painfully clear. "America First"
does not mean mutual growth or shared responsibility. It means shut up,
do what we say, or face the consequences.**]{.underline} This approach
is alienating the very partners Washington claims to value. **[It also
exposes the contradiction at the heart of Trump's Indo-Pacific strategy:
deterrence without diplomacy, presence without trust, leadership without
listening.]{.underline}** ASEAN is responding in its own quiet way. On
April 10, under Malaysia's chairmanship, the bloc convened a Special
Economic Ministers' Meeting. While the statement emphasized dialogue, it
also signaled a shift. Efforts are underway to upgrade the ASEAN-China
Free Trade Agreement, finalize the ASEAN Digital Economy Framework
Agreement, and deepen cooperation under the Regional Comprehensive
Economic Partnership (RCEP). These initiatives reflect a growing desire
to reduce reliance on an increasingly erratic United States and
strengthen internal economic resilience. This shift is happening at a
moment of global reordering. ASEAN now contributes over 7 percent of
global GDP and more than 8 percent of global growth over the past
decade. The region is indispensable to global trade, maritime security,
and technology supply chains. But Washington appears to treat it as
peripheral. Even the fact that the United States remains the largest
source of ASEAN foreign direct investment -- accounting for 32.4 percent
of the regional total in 2023 -- cannot compensate for policy
inconsistency and strategic tone-deafness. [The deeper problem is that
the United States under Trump continues to operate as if it is still
living in the unipolar moment.]{.underline} But it is no longer the only
game in town. [The region has choices. And while the United States was
in pole position to strengthen its leadership in Southeast Asia through
trade, technology, and security it has instead squandered the
opportunity through self-inflicted missteps. In a multipolar world,
influence must be earned, not assumed. Washington is learning that
lesson too slowly. Southeast Asia is not abandoning the United States,
but it is adjusting. Governments are hedging more actively,
strengthening ties with middle powers, and investing in regional
self-reliance]{.underline}. The days of strategic dependence are over.
What Southeast Asia seeks is not protection but partnership, and that
requires consistency, humility, and mutual respect. [Trump's first term
removed the United States from Southeast Asia's economic future. His
second is cutting it out of the region's strategic present. There will
be no dramatic exit, no final rupture]{.underline}. But when Southeast
Asia finally stops looking to Washington, it will not be out of
disloyalty. It will be out of necessity. And it will remember who turned
away first.

[5 per cent again]{.underline} America's commitment to its Indo-Pacific
allies now comes with **[higher costs, more demands, and inconsistent
conditions.]{.underline}** The administration is driven by [a desire to
deter China and preserve the balance of power in favour of the US.
Washington]{.underline} now therefore [judges cooperation with allies
and partners on the basis of two questions: **is it in America's
national security interest, and will it be enough to deter
China?**]{.underline} This fixation on Beijing has [raised the cost of
aligning with the US]{.underline}, placing [additional burdens on allies
which may run contrary to their own strategic interests or fiscal
capacities.]{.underline} Talks on defence spending best illustrate the
increasing scale of US demands. [In June it was reported that Washington
was asking Indo-Pacific allies to increase spending to 3.5 per cent of
GDP]{.underline} (up from an earlier requirement of 3 per cent). [Later
that month Washington stated it was seeking NATO-like defence spending
commitments of 5 per cent of GDP. Key allies]{.underline}, with the
exception of the Philippines, publicly [expressed their displeasure.
Tokyo cancelled a planned July meeting of US and Japanese defence and
foreign ministers. South Korea's Defence Ministry defended the country's
defence budget. And Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese publicly
rejected Washington's demands]{.underline}. [A few days
after]{.underline} Albanese's comment, the [Pentagon announced a review
of the US's role in the multi-billion dollar AUKUS submarine deal
--]{.underline} hailed as the centrepiece of America's allied
cooperation in the Indo-Pacific. The [Trump administration is also
explicitly asking allies to step up confrontation with
China.]{.underline} Pentagon officials are pushing Japan and Australia
to clarify their roles in the event of a war over Taiwan -- ironic
coming from a country that follows a policy of 'strategic ambiguity' on
the matter. It is also reported that [The Pentagon's AUKUS review may
require Australia to pay more for the submarines and guarantee their
usage in the event of a conflict over Taiwan]{.underline}. Meanwhile,
[other reports suggest that the Pentagon is considering a restructure of
US Forces in South Korea to focus on China, not North Korea, drawing
down troops by 4,500.]{.underline} Some asks are not new. [The Biden
administration compelled allies to align with American defence and
economic security policies on China.]{.underline} However, [tariffs,
combined with the imposition of new conditions on American commitment,
have injected distrust and uncertainty into decades-old
alliances.]{.underline} The linking of questions of political economy
with security and defence creates new requirements for keeping alliances
intact.

### I/L -- US Foreign Policy Fails

#### Trump's foreign policy fails -- nothing has been accomplished.

Doyle **McManus**, **7-20-2025**, \[Writer for the LA Times, \"News
Analysis: Trump\'s \'force of personality\' hasn\'t delivered on key
foreign policy goals\", Los Angeles Times,
<https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-07-20/trump-foreign-policy-analysis>,
accessed 7/20/25, S.A.M.\]

WASHINGTON --- [When]{.underline} President [**Trump returned to the
White House in January, he promised to deliver big foreign policy wins
in record time.** He said he would halt Russia's war against
Ukraine]{.underline} in 24 hours or less, [end Israel's war in
Gaza]{.underline} nearly as quickly and [force Iran to end to its
nuclear program]{.underline}. He said he'd persuade Canada to become the
51st state, take Greenland from Denmark and negotiate 90 trade deals in
90 days. "The president believes that his force of personality ... can
bend people to do things," his special envoy-for-everything, Steve
Witkoff, explained in May in a Breitbart interview. [**Six months later,
none of those ambitious goals have been reached.** Ukraine and Gaza are
still at war. Israel and the United States bombed Iran's nuclear
facilities,]{.underline} but it's not clear whether they ended the
country's atomic program once and for all. [Canada and Denmark haven't
surrendered any territory. And instead of trade deals, Trump is mostly
slapping tariffs on other countries, to the distress of U.S. stock
markets.]{.underline} It turned out that **[force of personality
couldn't solve every problem.]{.underline}** "He [overestimated his
power and underestimated the ability of others to push
back]{.underline}," said Kori Schake, director of foreign policy at the
conservative American Enterprise Institute. "**[He often acts as if
we're the only people with leverage, strength or the ability to take
action. We're not]{.underline}**." The president has notched important
achievements. He won a commitment from other members of NATO to increase
their defense spending to 5% of gross domestic product. The attack on
Iran appears to have set Tehran's nuclear project back for years, even
if it didn't end it. And Trump --- or more precisely, his aides ---
helped broker ceasefires between India and Pakistan and between Rwanda
and the Democratic Republic of Congo. But none of those measured up to
the goals Trump initially set for himself --- much less qualified for
the Nobel Peace Prize he has publicly yearned for. "[I won't get a Nobel
Peace Prize for this]{.underline}," [he grumbled when the Rwanda-Congo
agreement was signed. **The most striking example of unfulfilled
expectations has come in Ukraine**]{.underline}, the grinding conflict
Trump claimed he could end even before his inauguration. For months,
[Trump sounded certain that his warm relationship with Russian President
Vladimir Putin would produce a deal that would stop the
fighting,]{.underline} award Russia most of the territory its troops
have seized and end U.S. economic sanctions on Moscow. "I believe he
wants peace," Trump said of Putin in February. "I trust him on this
subject." But to Trump's surprise, [Putin wasn't satisfied with his
proposal]{.underline}. [The Russian leader continued bombing Ukrainian
cities even after Trump publicly implored him to halt]{.underline} via
social media [("Vladimir, STOP!")]{.underline}. Critics charged that
Putin was playing Trump for a fool. The president bristled: "Nobody's
playing me." But as early as April, [he admitted to doubts about Putin's
good faith]{.underline}. "It makes me think that maybe he doesn't want
to stop the war, [he's just tapping me along,"]{.underline} he said. "I
speak to him a lot about getting this thing done, and I always hang up
and say, 'Well, that was a nice phone call,' and then missiles are
launched into Kyiv or some other city," Trump complained last week.
"After that happens three or four times, you say [the talk doesn't mean
anything]{.underline}." **[The president also came under pressure from
Republican hawks in Congress who warned privately that if Ukraine
collapsed, Trump would be blamed the way his predecessor, President
Biden, was blamed for the fall of Afghanistan]{.underline}** in 2022. So
last week, [Trump changed course and announced that he will resume
supplying U.S.-made missiles to Ukraine --- but by selling them to
European countries instead of giving them to Kyiv as Biden had. Trump
also gave Putin 50 days to accept a ceasefire and threatened to impose
"secondary tariffs" on countries that buy oil from Russia]{.underline}
if he does not comply. He said he still hopes Putin will come around.
"I'm not done with him, but I'm disappointed in him," he said in a BBC
interview. It still isn't clear how many missiles Ukraine will get and
whether they will include long-range weapons that can strike targets
deep inside Russia. A White House official said those details are still
being worked out. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov sounded
unimpressed by the U.S. actions. "I have no doubt that we will cope," he
said. [Foreign policy experts warned that the secondary tariffs Trump
proposed could prove impractical. Russia's two biggest oil customers are
China and India; Trump is trying to negotiate major trade agreements
with both.]{.underline} Meanwhile, [Trump has dispatched Witkoff back to
the Middle East to try to arrange a ceasefire in Gaza and reopen nuclear
talks with Iran]{.underline} --- [the goals he began with six months
ago.]{.underline} Despite his mercurial style, Trump's approach to all
these foreign crises reflects basic premises that have remained constant
for a decade, foreign policy experts said. "[There is a Trump Doctrine,
and it has three basic principles]{.underline}," Schake said.
"**[Alliances are a burden. Trade exports American jobs. Immigrants
steal American jobs]{.underline}**." Robert Kagan, a former Republican
aide now at the Brookings Institution, added one more guiding principle:
"He favors autocrats over democrats." [Trump has a soft spot for foreign
strongmen like Putin and China's Xi Jinping, and has abandoned the
long-standing U.S. policy of fostering democracy abroad, Kagan
noted.]{.underline} The problem, Schake said, is that [those principles
"impede Trump's ability to get things done around the world,
a]{.underline}nd he doesn't seem to realize it. "The international order
we built after World War II made American power stronger and more
effective," she said. "[Trump and his administration seem bent on
presiding over the destruction of that international
order."]{.underline} Moreover, Kagan argued, Trump's [frenetic
imposition of punitive tariffs on other countries comes with serious
costs.]{.underline} "[Tariffs are a form of economic
warfare]{.underline}," he said. "Trump is creating enemies for the
United States all over the world. \... [I don't think you can have a
successful foreign policy if everyone in the world mistrusts
you."]{.underline} Not surprisingly, Trump and his aides don't agree.
"It cannot be overstated how successful the first six months of this
administration have been," White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt
said last week. "With President Trump as commander in chief, the world
is a much safer place." That claim will take years to test.

[[The US and China resumed a defense dialog aimed at preventing an

contacts]{.mark} up and down the chain of command]{.underline} that were
severed as tensions spiked [[over Taiwan and]{.underline}]{.mark}
territorial disputes in [[the S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina
[S]{.mark}ea]{.underline} in recent years.

The talks between China's People's Liberation Army, the US Indo-Pacific

military interactions of concern. Officials met April 3 and 4 in
Honolulu.

"[[Open]{.mark}, direct and clear [communications with the

in a statement.

The meeting was the first since President Joe Biden and Chinese
President Xi Jinping agreed in a November meeting to resume military
contacts severed after then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan in
August. Long before, China had also cut off many in-person meetings as
part of a lockdown to control the Covid-19 pandemic.

The US has previously protested what it describes as "coercive and
risky" behavior from China in areas such as the Taiwan Strait and the
South China Sea. In October, the Pentagon said the US had logged about
300 unprofessional and potentially dangerous incidents since September
2021.

**[A senior US military official]{.underline}**, who spoke to reporters

\*\*\*Tsai = leader of DPP, won the presidential election

A recent article published in The National Interest, Xi Jinping's Great
Game: Are China and Taiwan Headed Towards Trouble?, argues that "there
is a significant possibility that if Tsai Ing-wen is elected president
of Taiwan, a cross-Strait crisis could ensue...because Beijing could
react harshly." However, **[based on]{.underline}** an alternative
analysis of **[Beijing's positions]{.underline}** -- both **[lately and
in recent years]{.underline}** -- **[toward Tsai]{.underline}** Ing-wen
**[and Taiwan]{.underline}**, **[[Beijing remains cautious and
patient]{.underline}]{.mark}**, sometimes
**[[even]{.underline}]{.mark}** quite
**[[amiable]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Four things stand out: First and foremost, **[Beijing now appears to
have eased its attitude toward Tsai, especially compared to several
years ago.]{.underline}** Beijing used to simply label Tsai as a "Taiwan
independence element." In 2009, China's Foreign Ministry publicly
opposed Tsai's planned visit to Japan in a "consistent and firm" way.
But these **[[strong expressions have been absent in recent
years]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Before Tsai's trip to the U.S. in May,
Beijing neither directly referred to her as a "Taiwan independence
element" nor opposed her visit beforehand. After her visit, **[Beijing
made no strongly negative remarks]{.underline}**, despite the fact that
Beijing regarded it as improper for U.S. officials to meet Tsai in
government buildings. Instead, China warned that the U.S. "should not be
sending the wrong signals to Taiwanese independence forces."

Second, **[[Beijing]{.mark} has [suggested]{.mark}]{.underline}** that
**[it could be reconciled to the possibility of Tsai's being the 2016
Taiwanese president.]{.underline}** Recently, Ma Xiaoguang, the
spokesman of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)'s Taiwan Affairs Office
explained the CCP's position toward the Taiwan election: "**[We do not
get involved in, or comment on, the Taiwan
election]{.underline}**...**[We welcome any Taiwan party or
person]{.underline}** as long as they oppose Taiwan independence,
recognize the 1992 consensus and promote the peaceful development of
cross-strait relations." **[Beijing has never denied its strong
opposition to Taiwan independence]{.underline}** since 1949, **[but the
highlight Ma implied here is that]{.underline}** **[[Tsai and her party
could]{.mark} also [be welcomed]{.mark}]{.underline}**, if she can find
a position that both Taiwan and the Mainland China agree upon.

Third, **[[Beijing has issued a series of pro-Taiwan
policies]{.underline}]{.mark}** under Yu Zhengsheng, a member of the
CCP's top leadership overseeing Taiwan affairs. The Mainland "will
continue to create more preferential policies to encourage cross-Strait
exchange, including lifting the entry permit requirement for Taiwan
residents, and recognizing Taiwan ID cards," said Yu on June 14, at the
7th Straits Forum. **[[Yu]{.underline}]{.mark}** also **[[urged Taiwan
to participate in]{.mark} the [A]{.mark}]{.underline}**sian
**[[I]{.underline}]{.mark}**nfrastructure
**[[I]{.underline}]{.mark}**nvestment **[[B]{.underline}]{.mark}**ank.
Undoubtedly, **[these policies are Beijing's "carrots" toward
Taiwan]{.underline}**, but the "carrots" could be real benefits to the
Taiwanese people in a very short time. **[On the other hand, [Beijing
has not shown any "sticks" to Taiwan for years]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
except for certain routine expressions like "anti-Taiwan independence."
Additionally, in terms of the Taiwan issue, **[Xi Jinping's statements
are not the only barometer]{.underline}** of the status between China
and Taiwan. **[Yu]{.underline}** Zhengsheng is the one in charge now and
he is worth studying, especially his remarkable family background: Other
than a brother who dramatically defected to the U.S. in the 1980s, he
**[has strong family ties in Taiwan as well.]{.underline}** Yu has
publicly stated that he has relatives in Taiwan and he wanted to visit
Taiwan soon.

Finally, if you happen to be a fan of Chinese television dramas, you
would also observe that **[Mainland China's attitude toward the history
of Chinese civil war]{.underline}** between the CCP and the Kuomintang
(KMT) **[has significantly changed.]{.underline}** The CCP, since the
Mao era, has regarded literature and art as a tool to mold and shape
ordinary people's opinions. Hence, **[Chinese television dramas are one
of the best indicators of China's policy.]{.underline}** **[Chinese
television drama used to describe the KMT as the traitor]{.underline}**
in the Sino-Japanese War and counter-revolutionary elements in the
ensuing civil war. **[Lately]{.underline}**, however, **[the KMT has
become the positive force in Chinese television dramas]{.underline}**
and the KMT's contributions in the Sino-Japanese War are significantly
recognized. For example, in one recent TV drama broadcast on the
CCP-managed China Central TV Station, **[the hero was a KMT official
rather than a CCP member]{.underline}**, a plot point that would have
been inconceivable in the past. **[[The changed view toward history
offers the CCP a better domestic public opinion on the Taiwan
issue]{.underline}]{.mark}** and leverage in future negotiations. In
fact, **[[the CCP has already softened its
position]{.underline}]{.mark}**: When Taiwan's president Ma Ying-jeou
said that it was the KMT forces that won the Sino-Japanese War, China's
Foreign Ministry did not deny it, but simply added that the victory
should be remembed by the whole Chinese nation.

**[Taken together, on the Taiwan issue]{.underline}**, **[Beijing's
policy is reactive rather than proactive, reserved rather than
assertive, and offers carrots rather than sticks.]{.underline}** It is
fair to say **[that [now is the best time for Taiwan Strait relations
since 1949. The Taiwan Strait is far from a crisis, and will very likely
remain so, even if Tsai]{.mark}]{.underline}** Ing-wen **[[were
elected]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
