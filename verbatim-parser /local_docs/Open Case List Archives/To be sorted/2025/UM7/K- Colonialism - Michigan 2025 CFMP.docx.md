# Kritik---Colonialism---CCFMLP

This file is intended as a compilation of relevant colonialism K cards
about the Arctic from which you can draw inspiration and produce your
own unique approach. There are many different veins of critiques of
colonialism, so when researching, we chose to focus on finding evidence
about a breadth of topic-specific arguments as opposed to producing a
perfectly blocked out critique that stayed within one specific subfield
of anticolonial scholarship even if it wasn't topic-specific.

Many topshelf cards overlap and serve 2NC functions. Some alt cards are
both impact and alt cards, or link and alt cards; some impact cards or
alt cards are also thesis cards, perm answers, etc. Consider reading
some of the 1NC cards in the 2NC if you don't use them for their
original purposes.

112 non-dominance is reflected in various material and non-material
forms throughout the world: [[groups]{.mark} [experience]{.mark}

Duvall 2005, 42. 41 varying ways along multiple societal cleavages
dependent upon the specific context, and not all forms of societal
non-dominance may be relevant to securitization. However, understanding
the relationship between power and non-dominance is important to this
dissertation project because it also influences who is able to
contribute, and in what ways, to public discourse: "Relations of
dominance and non-dominance determine who defines norms and practices
and who must follow them; who is important and who is not; who defines
the parameters of the debate and who does not; who is valuable and who
is not."113 In some cases, non-dominance may translate into structural
or systematic restrictions upon a group's ability to influence
government policy regarding designation and defence against security
threats to that group. Securitization nondominance reflects both
structural and institutional power, because it is both direct and
constitutive of actors, and diffused through regulation of the
interactions between particular social actors. Securitization
non-dominance is thus a reflection of broader forms of nondominance as
they pertain to the ability to construct and respond to in/security. The
argument of securitization non-dominance is fully developed in Chapter
3, and the forms of non-dominance experienced by Arctic Indigenous
peoples are discussed further below and in their specific national
contexts in Chapters 4-7. 2.2 Indigenous Peoples in the Arctic
Indigenous peoples in the circumpolar region exhibit both typical and
atypical traits for indigenous peoples in contemporary global politics.
On the one hand, they are historically colonized populations who no
longer exert full decision-making authority over their traditional
lands. They also demonstrate clear continuity with pre-colonial
practices and social organization, due in part to the relatively recent
experiences of colonization by many Arctic Indigenous peoples,
especially in North America. On the other hand, most of the Arctic
states are stronger democratic systems with rule of law, economic and
social benefits, and respect for indigenous rights than many other
countries with indigenous populations. As discussed below, Arctic
Indigenous peoples enjoy among the highest qualities of life and
greatest degrees of 113 Gunhild Hoogensen and Kirsti Stuvøy, "Gender,
Resistance, and Human Security," Security Dialogue 37, no. (2006): 219.
42 political autonomy and inclusion of any indigenous peoples in the
world. With the notable exception of Russia, Arctic Indigenous peoples
have politically organized themselves into formations that sometimes
challenge the preferences of their colonial state governments without
fear of overt political repression, violence, or retaliation.
[[They]{.mark} thus enjoy a **higher degree** of **political freedom**
than most, while also [experiencing]{.mark} **[material]{.mark}**
conditions and **political non[dominance]{.mark}** [that]{.mark}
**[curtail]{.mark} their [political agency]{.mark}**,
[reflecting]{.mark} their **[status]{.mark} [within]{.mark}** their
**[settler-colonial]{.mark}** political [contexts]{.mark}. While
**[debates over indigeneity]{.mark}** and identity remain
[relevant]{.mark} in the circumpolar region, [by virtue]{.mark} of their
distinct structures of political representation **[Arctic Indigenous
peoples]{.mark}** are somewhat more clearly identifiable than
elsewhere.]{.underline} By definition, they comprise the Indigenous
peoples living in the Arctic regions of the eight circumpolar states.
Informed by the Cobo definition, the Arctic Human Development Report
defines Indigenous peoples as: Those peoples who were marginalized when
the modern states were created and identify themselves as indigenous
peoples. They are associated with specific territories to which they
trace their histories. They exhibit one or more of the following
characteristics: they speak a language that is different from that of
the dominant group(s); they are being [**[discriminated
against]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the **[political]{.mark}**
system]{.underline}; they are being discriminated against within [the
**[legal]{.mark} [system]{.mark}**]{.underline}; their [**[cultures
diverge]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} that of the **[remaining
society]{.mark}**]{.underline}; they often [**diverge** from the
mainstream society]{.underline} in their **[resource use]{.underline}**
by being hunters and gatherers, nomads, pastoralists, or swidden
farmers; they consider themselves and are [[considered]{.mark} by others
as **[different]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} the **[rest]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
the [population]{.mark}**]{.underline}.114 Indigenous peoples number
approximately 500,000 out of the total 4 million inhabitants of the
circumpolar region, and, as shown in Figure 2, form a ring of
overlapping trans-state populations surrounding the Arctic Ocean. A
majority of these live in Russia, which also has the greatest diversity
of Indigenous peoples with over 41 different groups, including the more
populous Chukchi, Evenki, Khaka, Khanty, Nenet, Tuvan, and Yakut
peoples. Aleuts are indigenous people in the easternmost Russian region
of Kamchatka who also inhabit the islands off western Alaska. Mainland
Alaska is home to Athabaskan, Gwich'in, and Inuit (Alaskan Eskimo)
peoples whose territories cross into northern Canada. Inuit form a
majority of the Indigenous population 114 Csonka and Schweitzer 2004,

population in the Canadian Arctic, as well as a large majority of nearly
90 percent in neighbouring Greenland. Sámi are the only recognized
Indigenous people in all of Europe, comprising the entire indigenous
populations of Norway, Sweden, and Finland, with a small number also on
the Kola Peninsula in western Russia.115 While now rooted in the social
and political structures of particular states, the sociological
boundaries of Arctic Indigenous peoples are not consistent with the
colonial boundaries that have been imposed upon them. Indigenous peoples
serve as living reminders of pre-modern patterns of habitation in the
circumpolar region, and reflect relationships and associations that
transcend sovereign borders. The formal political involvement of
Indigenous peoples in the circumpolar region is one of the key features
of the post-Cold War Arctic order. In addition to significant degrees of
selfgovernment, political autonomy, or elected representation exercised
by Indigenous peoples throughout much of the region -- particularly Self
Rule for the Inuit majority in Greenland; selfgovernment or high
representation in public governments for Canadian Inuit through the
establishment of four land claim areas; and the separate Sámi
Parliaments of Norway, Sweden, and Finland -- Indigenous peoples have
also been central to the establishment and activities of the Arctic
Council. Founded in 1996 to provide a dedicated regional forum for
dialogue and cooperation, the Council owes much of the impetus for its
creation to the organization and activism of Indigenous advocacy groups.
Since the 1960s, Indigenous peoples across the Arctic increasingly
established representative organizations to both lobby governments and
speak on behalf of their people, who at the time very much remained
colonial subjects of their southernbased governments. John English,
historian of the Arctic Council, credits the efforts of these
organizations and the leaders they produced with the eventual success of
the Arctic Council negotiations: "Voices that were silenced in the
fifties became audible in the sixties, eloquent in the seventies, and
powerful and influential later. The colonized now came to the colonial
capitals no longer as subjects but as actors shaping their times and the
lives of their people."116 The emergence of Indigenous voices as a
potent political force would substantially alter the shape of the
circumpolar region. 115 Antoine Dubreuil, "The Arctic of the Regions:
Between Indigenous Peoples and Sub-National Entities -- Which
Perspective?" International Journal 66, no. 4 (2011): 923-938. 116 John
English, Ice and Water: Politics, Peoples, and the Arctic Council
(Toronto: Penguin, 2013), 95. 45 Arising from social movements for
Indigenous rights and representation, six groups were formally
incorporated into regional **[[governance]{.underline}]{.mark}** through
their inclusion as Permanent Participants on the Arctic Council: the
Arctic Athabaskan Council, Aleut International Association, Gwich'in
Council International, Inuit Circumpolar Council, Russian Association of
Indigenous Peoples of the North, and the Saami Council. As the first
international intergovernmental body in the world to grant indigenous
peoples formal status with rights to membership and participation
approximating that of the Member States, the Council provides Indigenous
peoples with representation at the premier forum for regional
cooperation. English argues that "it is a mark of the historic change
that the growing prominence of the Arctic Council with its indigenous
participants means that many rules will now be set not only in imperial
southern capitals but often by northern peoples."117 English's detailed
analysis of the Council's origins concurs with the conclusions of other
leading scholars like Oran Young that it is partly through the efforts
of Indigenous peoples that the Arctic has developed from a "region of
peripheries" into a coherent region of its own,118 and with Timo
Koivurova and Leena Heinämäki that Arctic Indigenous peoples have become
so key to regional politics as to enjoy a status close to that of
vetoholders.119 Although they continue to reflect the significant
differences of opportunity afforded by their respective historical
experiences and contemporary circumstances, Arctic Indigenous peoples
have been at the forefront of advancing the political interests of
indigenous peoples and their inclusion in organizations and fora
previously reserved for states. In this respect, Arctic Indigenous
peoples reflect the global achievements of indigenous peoples in
fostering an awareness of indigeneity as a basis for rights and
political inclusion, and establishing a social movement to support the
political project of "global indigenism."120 The adoption of the United
Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 2007, the
creation of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, and moves
towards recognition and reparations for colonially inflicted wrongs all
signify the contemporary emergence of indigenous 117 English 2013, 298.

Despite the significant progress that has been made by settler-colonial
governments and legal authorities in terms of acknowledging and
respecting indigenous rights and title, the relationships between
indigenous peoples and their governments remain structured by the
dominance of settler-colonial values, institutions, and interests.
Though more empowered than ever before, and more so than most indigenous
peoples elsewhere in the world, even in the Arctic, Indigenous peoples
lack the power to control their own collective futures. 2.3 Research,
Non-Dominance and Indigenous Peoples The non-dominance of Arctic
Indigenous peoples is reflected in two distinct forms: material and
non-material (ideational). The material reflections of political
non-dominance vary by country and are discussed in subsequent chapters,
but generally [include **[lower qualities]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
[life]{.mark}, forms of **[governmental control]{.mark}**, and
**[restrictions]{.mark}** [upon]{.mark} [indigenous]{.mark} rights and
[autonomy]{.mark} [resulting]{.mark} [from]{.mark} "the
**[demoralising]{.mark} effects** of **[dispossession]{.mark}**, [forced
removals]{.mark}, **[open racism]{.mark}** and
**discrimination**]{.underline}, and [**[destruction]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} language, **[identity]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark}
**[culture]{.mark}**]{.underline}."122 Less overt but more pernicious,
however, is [the **ideational** non-dominance that has resulted in the
**[discrediting]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} **[indigenous]{.mark}** forms of
knowledge and **[knowledge production]{.mark}**, the
[privileging]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [settler-colonial]{.mark} legal and
political systems, and the ongoing **[marginalization]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} [indigenous]{.mark}** [ways of]{.mark} **knowing** and
[being]{.mark} **[relative]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} those of
**[settlers]{.mark}**. Ideational non-dominance is a form of power
[that]{.mark} [operates]{.mark} "[in]{.mark} [underlying]{.mark}
[social]{.mark} structures and [systems]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[knowledge]{.mark} that advantage some and disadvantage
others]{.underline}."123 ."123 [Indigenous **[traditional
knowledge]{.mark}** and traditional ecological knowledge have long been
[viewed]{.mark} as **[threatening]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} the **[colonial
order]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and have been subjected to concerted
efforts at destruction, 121 Maaka and Fleras 2005, 12. 122 Maaka and
Fleras 2005, 26. 123 Barnett and Duvall 2005, 42. 47 erasure, and
forgetting. As Linda Tuhiwai Smith asserts, "the [**[negation]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} [indigenous]{.mark} views of history was a [critical]{.mark}
part of **asserting** **colonial [ideology]{.mark}**]{.underline},
partly [because such views]{.underline} were regarded as clearly
'primitive' and 'incorrect' and mostly because they [challenged and
**resisted the vision** of colonization]{.underline}."124 [Colonial
[authorities]{.mark} sought to [render]{.mark} [indigenous populations
legible to]{.mark} **new forms** of **[state
power]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which necessitated [[structuring the
social terrain]{.mark}]{.underline} on which indigenous/non-indigenous
relations would occur [[in a manner **advantageous** to the
colonizer]{.underline}]{.mark}. This included depriving prior indigenous
knowledge and forms of organization of the legitimacy to challenge
settler-colonial organization and Western forms of knowledge by
subjecting them to alien standards of colonial law and morality,
preventing their transmission to younger generations, and eventually
co-opting them into certain settler-colonial decision-making processes
and academic research.125 [The result has been the **widespread
[discrediting]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the scientific validity,
**[legal]{.mark} [weight]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark} [moral]{.mark}
[worth]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [indigenous]{.mark} [knowledge]{.mark}
precisely [on]{.mark} the [basis]{.mark} [of]{.mark} its **difference**
from **[settler-colonial]{.mark}**/scientific **[rationalist]{.mark}
modes** of **[thought]{.mark}** and **action**.]{.underline}126 The
ideational dimension of indigenous non-dominance is important to specify
because it sets the context for the material dimension that is more
readily visible in indigenous/non-indigenous relations. The two are
intimately linked, as it is the severing of indigenous peoples' ties to
their cultural and epistemological heritage that facilitates the
material dispossession of their lands, rights, and resources, and
establishes the context for settler domination in their new societies.
Erasure occurs in two ways: through the exclusion and enforced
forgetting of traditional indigenous knowledge, and through the
displacement and disruption of societies guided by and responsible for
generating that knowledge. Vandana Shiva observes: "Over and above
rendering local knowledge invisible by declaring it non-existent or
illegitimate, the dominant system also makes alternatives disappear by
erasing or destroying the reality which they attempt to represent."127
The current Arctic context exemplifies this dynamic, wherein traditional
knowledge has been denied scientific authority and excluded from
official decision making at the 124 Linda Tuhiwai Smith, Decolonizing
Methodologies: Research and Indigenous Peoples (London: Zed, 1999), 29.

settler-colonial political, economic, and social policies have wrought
changes on Arctic societies and ecosystems that undermine the
applicability of traditional knowledge in the first place. Relevant
examples range from human impacts on the Arctic ecosystem such that
traditional ecological knowledge no longer reflects the characteristics
of the circumpolar climate, to settler-colonial policies that have
discriminated against indigenous women with impacts on traditional
structures of community authority.128 The [**[rejection]{.mark}** and
delegitimization of indigenous knowledge]{.underline} [[provides]{.mark}
a **[vital precondition]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} the **[material]{.mark}**
[non]{.mark}-[dominance]{.mark} [experienced by **indigenous
peoples**]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly as it pertains to the
inability to make decisions regarding traditional land-use on ancestral
territories, and related decisions over how indigenous peoples can and
should live in the modern world. 2.3.1 Decolonization and Indigenist
Research A central component of this dissertation involves the
understandings of Indigenous peoples towards the meaning of in/security
in the Arctic region. Given the importance of epistemology and knowledge
production to power relations between indigenous and non-indigenous
peoples, pursuing appropriate and respectful research involving
indigenous peoples is complicated by a history of Western academic
research fraught with deceit, injustice, abuse, appropriation, and
perpetuation of the very structures that render indigenous peoples
non-dominant within their national communities. One of the key functions
that academic research has performed in this process is the explicit or
implicit privileging of settler-colonial and state perspectives,
resulting in the erasure and denial of indigenous histories,
epistemologies, and contemporary interests.129 Far from just the
objective interpretation of facts through theory, Tuhiwai Smith notes
the "problem is that academic writing is a form of selecting, arranging
and presenting knowledge. It 128 The differences between Western
scientific and indigenous observations of Arctic climate change are
shown in the film Qapirangajuq: Inuit Knowledge and Climate Change,
which highlights some of the disagreements and differing interpretations
between indigenous and scientific understandings of the changing
environment. The film is available at
http://www.isuma.tv/inuit-knowledge-and-climate-change. For a discussion
of traditional knowledge and traditional forms of community authority
see Stephanie Irlbacher-Fox, Jackie Price, and Elena Wilson-Rowe,

Canadian Arctic," in Hoogensen Gjørv et al., Environmental and Human
Security in the Arctic (New York: Routledge, 2014). 129 Marie Battiste,
ed, Reclaiming Indigenous Voice and Vision (Vancouver: UBC Press, 2000);
Tuhiwai Smith 1999. 49 privileges sets of texts, views about the history
of an idea, what issues count as significant; and, by engaging in the
same process uncritically, we too can render indigenous writers
invisible or unimportant while reinforcing the validity of other
writers."130 If research into issues pertaining to indigenous peoples is
undertaken without consideration of their views, including but not
limited to the inclusion of indigenous voices and perspectives, then
that research contributes to the "cognitive imperialism" that
underpinned colonization.131 Perhaps especially for disciplines such as
political science, international relations, and security studies that
have primarily focused on state behaviour, the international system of
sovereign states, and the mechanisms of interstate violence and
cooperation that constitute global order, there has been little account
of indigenous peoples: "On the international scene it is extremely rare
and unusual when indigenous accounts are accepted and acknowledged as
valid interpretations of what has taken place."132 Therefore,
contemporary research must be conscious of its role in supporting or
silencing the voices of indigenous peoples and other non-dominant
groups, and the ethical implications of writing them out of academic
accounts of modern politics. To this end, Tuhiwai Smith promotes an
'indigenist' research agenda to help decolonize the methodological and
epistemological approaches of academic research. For indigenous
scholars, decolonizing research may be integral to their individual and
collective senses of Self as indigenous people,133 but for
non-indigenous scholars, like myself, the drive for an indigenist
research agenda "evolves from a need to comprehend, resist, and
transform the crises related to the dual concerns of the effect that
colonization has had on Indigenous peoples and the ongoing erosion of
Indigenous languages, knowledge, and culture as a result of
colonization."134 In this way, indigenist research "borrows freely from
feminist research and critical approaches to research, but privileges
indigenous voices."135 For me, the desire to help decolonize research
through this dissertation stems from: recognition that the Euro-centric
theoretical traditions of 130 Tuhiwai Smith 1999, 36. 131 Battiste 2000,

Battiste 2000, xx-xxi. 135 Tuhiwai Smith 1999, 147. 50 academia offer an
incomplete understanding of the social and natural worlds;
acknowledgment of the historic and contemporary harms inflicted on
indigenous peoples by the convergence of state practices and mainstream
scholarship; and understanding that circumpolar research is empirically
incomplete without incorporating the views of Arctic Indigenous peoples.

(Alexander, "The Structures of Conquest: Debating Extractivism(s),
Infrastructures and Environmental Justice for Advancing Post-development
Pathways," *The Afterlives of Extraction: Alternatives and Sustainable
Futures*, Chapter 3, pp. 57-59, dml)

Extractivism and infrastructure are the two sides of the
socio-ecological coin. [The **[extraction]{.mark}** of human and
non-human life [to]{.mark}]{.underline} 'develop' states,
[[grow]{.underline}]{.mark} economies [[and
modernise]{.underline}]{.mark} infrastructures, while responsible for
creating living possibilities and enchantments (Alexander, 2008; Harvey
and Knox, 2012), is undeniably the modality of development that [[is
responsible for]{.mark} socioecological and climate
**[catastrophe]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Kallianos, Dunlap and Dalakoglou,
2022). '[The [invention of the **boat**]{.mark}]{.underline}', as Paul
Virilio ((2008 \[1983\]), 46) reminds us, '[[was the invention of
**shipwrecks**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The invention of the steam engine
and the locomotive was the invention of derailments. The invention of
the highway was the invention of three hundred cars colliding in five
minutes'. Ward Churchill (2003) and Winona LaDuke and Sean Aaron Cruz
(2012), taking this further, remind us that **[colonial
genocide]{.underline}**--ecocide process on Turtle Island [are
**foundational** to **nuclear weapon production**]{.underline}.
[[Colonial conquest]{.underline}]{.mark} and the 'Indian Wars'
[[established the means to **exterminate**]{.underline}]{.mark}
Hiroshima and Nagasaki [[via **atomic bombs**]{.underline}]{.mark}
dropped on Japan.1 With the wider public recognition of climate change,
we can now say that [the invention of capitalist
industrialisation]{.underline} (as we know it) [has **consolidated** the
pathways towards ecological and climate **catastrophe**]{.underline}.

[Technological [progress]{.mark}]{.underline}, its speed, convenience
and possibilities, offered existential purpose and [[enamoured

he negative side of technology and speed was censored', as Virilio
((2008 \[1983\]), 46) contends. [This underside is [not only
**accidents**]{.mark} and **disasters**]{.underline} as Virilio
indicates, [[but an **entire**]{.mark} self-reinforcing and
administering]{.underline} institutional [[**network** of
extractivism]{.mark} and infrastructure]{.underline} powered by
capitalism(s). This, of course, refers specifically to
materialintensive, or 'hard', infrastructures, such as roads, pipes,
power lines, data centres, power stations and more (Anand, Gupta and
Appel, 2018; Tarvainen, 2022), which function as the skeleton of
capitalism, the shape of modernity, the driving force of extractivism.
Patrick Wolfe's (2006, 388) contention that [colonial]{.underline}
'[[invasion is a **structure** not an **event**]{.underline}]{.mark}',
indicates---past and present---how [the modernist process seeks to
literally]{.underline} '**[steamroller]{.underline}**' [and **absorb**
Indigenous peoples and ecologies]{.underline}, revealing how political
economy maintains this socio-ecological apparatus of conquest. Wolfe's
'structure' refers to settler colonialism and colonial societies, their
political economy and forms of political organisation--- the state
(Dunlap, 2018; 2020). Viewing statist2 infrastructures as conquest
reminds us of the extent to which [[**intense socio-ecological
destruction** is]{.mark} tolerated and [normalised]{.mark} within the
current institutions and economies]{.underline}. This is to say that
colonial/statist3 invasion is also infrastructural (Dunlap and Arce,
2022, 461; Tornel, 2020), which implies the necessity of rethinking and
changing 'resource' [extraction practices]{.underline} and modern
infrastructural construction (Kallianos, Dunlap and Dalakoglou, 2022),
which extends to bureaucratic, judicial and mental infrastructures.
Mental infrastructures [are formed [by]{.mark} **systematically
[bombarding]{.mark}** [people with]{.mark} efforts at **[subjectivity
persuasion]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g. 'brain washing') by private
industries and governments [in order to cultivate particular forms of
public conduct and consumer practices]{.underline} (Bernays,
\[1928\]2005; Herman and Chomsky, \[1989\]2010; Verweijen and Dunlap,
2021). If people want to mitigate ecological crisis, they must become
responsive and challenge the persistence of ecologically destructive
infrastructures and begin (re)transforming their habitation practices to
support their environments. This chapter seeks to address
[an]{.underline} anthropocentric **[[extractive]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and infrastructural **[[bias]{.underline}]{.mark}** that
[**predominates** within]{.underline} extractive and environmental
justice (ej) literatures. This bias relates to how [people]{.underline}
chart (multi-scalar) extractive supply webs, the state and 'justice'
phraseology. Critical approaches, the chapter argues, still suffer from
'infrastructural coloniality' (Dunlap, 2021a, 6), [which
[**underestimates** the accumulation]{.mark} and interdependence [of
extractivism]{.mark}]{.underline}(s) [[and **enables** them through
processual]{.mark} and egalitarian [concerns that **maintain**]{.mark}
**the supremacy** of modernist infrastructures]{.underline} over
ecosystems. [Infrastructural coloniality frequently results
in]{.underline} '**[selling out]{.underline}**'
[ecosystems]{.underline}/habitats, thereby [**subordinating** nonhuman
life]{.underline} (e.g. animals, rivers, mountains, trees and habitats)
[to]{.underline} the desires of various human populations under [the
influence of **[colonial mentalities]{.mark}**]{.underline} and, later,
industrial-'technocapitalist' desires. Civilisation, Empire, Monarchy
and Colonialism, guided by various statist forms and economic logics,
have progressed alongside technological developments, which reinforce
each other to continue industrial capitalist trajectories into
cybernetic and computational capitalism(s) that remain normal features
of (statist) market societies.

**Golańska, 23**---Associate Professor of Cultural Studies and Religion
at the Department of Cultural Research, University of Lodz (Dorota,
"Memorializing the unspectacular: Toward a minor remembrance," Memory
Studies, Volume 16, Issue 6, December 2023, dml)

Acknowledging the urgency of "thinking big" in the context of the
imminent ecological catastrophe, I nevertheless remain unconvinced about
the long-term productivity of such a (universalizing) move within memory
studies. What troubles me is the conceptual (im)possibility of including
the discreet, nuanced, and situated manifestations of these multiscalar
entanglements within this ever-expanding paradigm. It is true that the
hitherto evolution of [the]{.underline} field (from familial, national,
transnational, global, to planetary), as well as its [focus
on]{.underline} a **[shared nature]{.underline}** of remembering,
[generates a situation in which attention is **predominantly** being
paid to]{.underline} what is thought of as [**spectacular developments**
of massive violence]{.underline}, [mammoth destruction]{.underline},
[outstanding atrocities]{.underline}, [and remarkable
deaths]{.underline}.2 It seems that [the]{.underline}
"**[collective]{.underline}**" (rather than "collected"; cf. Olick,
1999) [dimension]{.underline} of memory deliberated upon by memory
studies scholars [enables only a **limited** subsuming of
differentiated]{.underline}, [localized]{.underline}, [and
individualized histories of oppression]{.underline},
[bereavement]{.underline}, [and misery]{.underline}, even if they remain
contingent on more overarching (colonial) practices and (humanist)
patterns of thinking. The current emphasis on the planetary scale of
memory appears to further aggravate this tendency; as Groes (2016: 141)
argues, in such a context, memory must be rethought, since "much more
central now are climatological and geological memory, and perhaps
cosmological memory that dwarfs the individual, embodied memory that is
a part of anthropogenic thinking."

Such **[upscaling]{.underline}** does not come without certain risks. In
that sense, I align with Bond et al.'s (2017: 859) warning, that in
doing so, we [may]{.underline} "[**lose sight** of particular instances
of suffering]{.underline}, [**eliding** the inequitable distribution
of]{.underline} human and environmental [violence]{.underline}, [and
**occluding** a valuable opportunity to map the intersections of global
upheaval and personal trauma]{.underline}" [plotted across the troubling
history of subjugation and extraction]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [paying
attention to]{.underline} (only [seemingly]{.underline})
[**unspectacular** manifestations of violence allows such stories
to]{.underline} "[retain some specificity]{.underline}" (Clark, 2015:
131; see also Bond et al., 2017: 859), whether they refer primarily to
human or nonhuman beings. A more thoughtful analysis of (genealogies of)
localized violence displays its embeddedness in the humanist---highly
extractive and deeply discriminatory---logic of thinking, [unveiling its
**multiscale entanglements** and varied manifestations]{.underline}.
Attending to such (minor) stories of (planetary) harm clearly uncovers,
to reference Braidotti (2020: 265), that [although]{.underline} "[we are
**in this together**]{.underline}, [we are **not one and the
same**]{.underline}" (original emphasis; see also Braidotti, 2019), and
that we are not (and have never been) in this in the same ways. It is
thus necessary to expose the racial and classist blindness, as well as
still to a large extent anthropocentric construction, of the
Anthropocene rhetoric.3 As Yusoff (2018: 2) notes, "As the Anthropocene
proclaims [the language of species
life]{.underline}---anthropos---through universalist geologic commons,
it [**neatly erases** histories of]{.underline} racism that were
incubated through the regulatory structure of geologic relations." It is
therefore crucial to remember---contra Chakrabarty's (2014: 11)
earlier-mentioned views---that "The human and its subcategory, the
inhuman, are historically relational to a discourse of
settler-[colonial]{.underline} rights and the material [practices of
**extraction**]{.underline}" (Yusoff, 2018: 2). As such, the language of
colonialism, which has been increasingly invoked in discussions
associated with the unequal global distribution of climate change's
effects, cannot be approached merely as a metaphor (cf. Bhambra and
Newell, 2022; see also Bhambra, 2021). Processes of colonialization of
land/people and climate change share a natal moment (Yusoff, 2018),
which calls for new forms of remembrance capable of embracing, as
Braidotti (2020: 266) evinces, "different ways of caring," as well as of
responding to a great diversity of racially, socially, religiously, and
economically stratified---albeit often covert or discreet---violences
and desolations.

Unspectacular violence

Writing about different forms of environmental damage, Nixon (2011: 2)
proposes the concept of "**[slow violence]{.underline}**" to
[describe]{.underline} "a [violence that occurs **gradually** and out of
sight]{.underline}, [a violence of **delayed destruction** that is
dispersed across time and space]{.underline}, an attritional violence
that is [typically **not viewed as violence at all**]{.underline}." In
Nixon's (2011: 2) words, "[Violence is customarily conceived
as]{.underline} an event or action that is **[immediate]{.underline}**
in time, [**explosive** and **spectacular**]{.underline} in space,
[and]{.underline} as [erupting into **instant sensational
visibility**]{.underline}." For him, however, [it is urgent to address a
different kind of violence]{.underline}, "a violence [that is neither
**spectacular** nor **instantaneous**]{.underline}, [but]{.underline}
rather [**incremental** and **accretive**]{.underline}, [its
**calamitous repercussions** playing out across a **range** of temporal
scales]{.underline}" (Nixon, 2011: 2). It seems that, for Nixon, [the
**most problematic** dimension of slow violence is connected to its
**unspectacular** character]{.underline}: [such forms of inflicting harm
over extended periods of time remain difficult to mediatize as their
**gradual**]{.underline}, [**silent** advancement enables **decoupling**
of their effects from causes]{.underline}, making it next to impossible
to identify those who should be considered accountable for the generated
harm. Time thus serves as a means of naturalizing and neutralizing "the
state of things" (Rancière, 2013: n.p.). The originality of Nixon's
concept rests on his insistence that [our understanding of violence
**cannot remain limited** to]{.underline} "**[newsworthy]{.underline}**"
[occurrences]{.underline}. In this context, crucial is his
differentiation between spectacular, highly visible events of fast
violence on the one hand, and unspectacular, indirect and invisible
operations of slow violence, on the other hand. While the former catch
public attention and call for immediate civic response, the latter exist
in the shadow, without making headlines.

Nixon's proposal draws on Johan Galtung's conceptualization of
structural violence. Rather than involving direct action between
subjects and objects of violence, [such a form of injuring
is]{.underline} "[built into the **structure** and shows up as **unequal
power** and]{.underline} consequently as unequal **[life
chances]{.underline}**" (Galtung, 1969: 171). In this sense, direct
violence often remains closely connected to hierarchically organized
structures of power, (re)producing social hierarchies. "Cultural
violence," on the other hand, embodied in a rich inventory of cultural
means (such as art, science, religion, ideology), "can be used to
justify or legitimize direct or structural violence" (Galtung, 1990:
291). Also, "a causal flow from cultural via structural to direct
violence can be identified" (Galtung, 1990: 294), as [covert violence
tends to work as a **catalyst** for more specific acts of direct
violence and to serve as a means for **justifying** or **ignoring**
them]{.underline}. While Nixon's elaborations only briefly reference
Galtung's work, I view this aspect of his theory as extremely important,
given the complex, racialized genealogies and cartographies of toxicity
and environmental damage, as well as considering the unequal
distribution of harm across different human and nonhuman entities. Also
worth highlighting is the fact that [not only do the
well-established]{.underline}, [silently operating structural
inequalities make slow violence **possible**]{.underline},
[but]{.underline} they likewise [enable the rendering of such **massive
ferocities** as **unspectacular**]{.underline}.

Posing---as Nixon (2011: 2) highlights---"strategic and representational
challenges," unspectacular violence is typically suppressed, belittled,
and marginalized in public memory. But its absence in the mnemonic
landscape is also connected to the fact that those groups who are most
affected by the detrimental transformations related to processes of
toxicity, contamination, and environmental harm---namely, the
non-affluent, the non-Western, the non-white, the nonhuman---are rarely
considered legitimate political agents, as, at least as far as humans
are concerned, exposure to harm has for long been organized along
color/class lines. Situated on the invisibilized margins of social
hierarchies (ordered by naturalized structural inequalities), the
quality of life of those traumatized by the havoc wreaked by slow
violence's continuous operations remains indifferent to the broader
public, while their authority as witnesses to the regular courses of
inflicting harm happens to be culturally discounted. This is an upshot
of what Said (2001: 10) calls "an imposed silence and the normalized
quiet of unseen power," which constantly works to deepen the
marginalization of those already structurally excluded. Therefore, the
dearth of visibility of unspectacular experiences connected to slow
violence in the broader memorial landscape is a result not only of the
representational difficulties identified by Nixon, but also of the
unequal social organization of power. This hinders possibilities for
mobilization and counteracting. It seems, therefore, that some
arrangements of quite massive and consequential violence are
discursively rendered unspectacular not solely because they unfold in
slow motion (as Nixon suggests), but also (or primarily) because they
mostly affect those who (historically) possess little political power,
that is, the disposable and "non-grievable" (Butler, 2009) bodies, both
human and nonhuman, doomed to experience the degrading conditions for
sustaining life.

Violent legacies

Structural hierarchies and unequal participation in power (including the
possibilities of shaping the memorial landscape) constitute an ongoing
legacy of Eurocentric, humanist ways of thinking, configuring global
power relations on different levels since the beginning of modern times.
In her critical investigation of the white historiographies of
colonization of both knowledge and land, Wynter (1995, 2003) traces the
successive processes of transcribing the European theocentric,
Judeo-Christian, and Scholastic orders of knowledge into a modern,
humanistic one, embodied in what she terms "Man1" and "Man2." Wynter's
strategy connects the homo oeconomicus to, yet also differentiates it
from, homo politicus and homo religiousus (Wynter and McKittrick, 2015:
10). For Wynter, the figuration of "Man1" emerged in a post-1492 context
to code human species according to the "rational/irrational" order,
which excluded people of African descent, designating them to
onto-epistemic absence or death (see McKittrick, 2014: 22; Wynter, 1995;
Wynter and McKittrick, 2015: 47). In the nineteenth century, this
formulation shifted toward the construction of what Wynter (1995) labels
"Man2"---the new bio-centric figure of homo oeconomicus (see also
Wynter, 2003). His formation rested on the code of eugenics-inspired
"natural selectedness/dysselectedness" (Wynter and McKittrick, 2015: 17;
see also Wynter, 2003) (which corresponded to the consolidating
Darwinian theory of evolution, that is, the "Man2's" mythoi),
establishing a categorized order of races and resulting in writing
non-white people out of what was considered "humanness." Within thus
conceived humanism, racism has worked as a systematic dehumanizing
mechanism while the notion of a human originating in a Eurocentric
culture has never stood for the entire species, instead being the
"overrepresentation" of what Wynter (2003: 317) calls the "ethnoclass of
Western-bourgeois" variant of the (white) human. Relying on such
radically exclusionary logic, humanism has produced practices of not
seeing, or ignoring, certain things/people to such an extent that these
things/people are no longer possible to be seen at all, as their
invisibility has already belonged to this system as its driving force.
Within this framework, Wynter (1995) asserts, such omissions cannot be
simply undone, as they remain constitutive of humanism itself. An
entirely new logic is necessary to acknowledge (and remember) these
disregarded (unspectacular) stories beyond the extant structures of
humanist (dualistic) ordering.

Situating it within the context of posthumanist/planetary thinking,
Kaiser and Thiele (2017) place Wynter's historiographical elaborations
in dialogue with memory studies scholarship. They acknowledge that much
work has been done within this field of inquiry to reveal the complexity
of mnemonic processes from different perspectives and critical
positionings, which found articulations in such concepts as Négritude
(Césaire, 2000), Antillanité (Glissant, 1981), Créolité (Bernabé, 1992;
Bernabé et al., 1989), and Black Atlantic (Gilroy, 1993; cf. Kaiser and
Thiele, 2017: 404). Certainly, also much more recent conceptual
elaborations, such as the previously mentioned "cosmopolitan" (Levy and
Sznaider, 2002), "multidirectional" (Rothberg, 2009), and "travelling"
(Erll, 2011) memory, as well as the notion of the "implicated subject"
(Rothberg, 2013, 2019), have further contributed to the pluralization
and complication of the global mnemonic landscape, revealing the various
convergences, interconnections, and contradictions among the different
memorial contexts and (historical) political settings. Nevertheless, as
Kaiser and Thiele (2017: 404) insist, Wynter's work offers yet another
dimension to these (re)formulations, calling for "the systemic
transformation of our conception of humanness" (original emphasis). As
the two authors explain,

Less concerned with the conflicts and confluences of narratives from
different communities, her \[Wynter's\] work brings to the fore the
Euro- and anthropocentric "initial conditions" from which humanness has
been thought and which even a dynamized and multiplied paradigm of
memory leaves largely unquestioned. (Kaiser and Thiele, 2017: 404)

So, for Wynter, the systemic omission of blackness in hegemonic
historiographies "is not an amnesia that could be redressed by turning
the tables or by including forgotten voices as a now acknowledged group"
(Kaiser and Thiele, 2017: 407). Racialized foundations of humanism can
never be undone "by merely including within the category of Man what
this very category requires to be kept outside" (Kaiser and Thiele,
2017: 408; original emphasis). As Colebrook (2017: 419) further
clarifies, "Adding other stories or perspectives, or aiming for maximal
inclusion will only reinforce the sense of 'Man' as an already universal
being" (original emphasis). A gesture toward other than oppositional
dynamics is thus necessary to effectuate a true transformation of the
discriminatory ways of thinking/remembering associated with humanist
exclusionist and extractivist logic, and to genuinely move beyond it.
Perhaps, the recent turn to posthumanist ethics creates a momentum for
such cautious and situated theoretical transmutations, yet ones that
must necessarily acknowledge the racialized genealogy of the current
environmental condition which keeps the human (Anthropos), and its
(geo-logical) agencies, at its very center.

In my reflections on the logic of unspectacular violence's invisibility,
as well as on such violence's absence from the dominant mnemonic
landscape, I read Wynter's work together with Yusoff's ideas elucidating
how the entanglement of racial and environmental damage has for long
been embedded in a humanist framework. The aim is to unwrap the
often-neglected racialized interfaces of natural and human history (to
paraphrase Chakrabarty (2009, 2014)). Yusoff (2018: 52) recognizes "the
formative role of race in the genealogy of an Anthropocenic subject and
the set of environmental processes that accrue in the new subjective
mode of geologic force." Indicating the structural proximity of black
and brown bodies to the inhuman, she claims that this relation has been
shaped by "[historical geographies of **extraction**]{.underline},
grammars of geology, imperial global geographies, and contemporary
environmental racism" (Yusoff, 2018: xii). Such structural intimacy "is
predicated on the presumed absorbent qualities of black and brown bodies
to take up the body burdens of exposure to toxicities and to buffer the
violence of the earth" (Yusoff, 2018: xii). This observation
[corresponds to **highly racialized** geographies of harm generated by
slow violence's unspectacular operations]{.underline}, identified by
Nixon (2011). **[Challenging]{.underline}** the racial blindness of the
Anthropocene [rhetoric]{.underline}, [which laments the **looming end of
the world**]{.underline} (inhabited by white communities), Yusoff (2018:
xiii) pays attention to the fact that "imperialism and ongoing (settler)
[colonialisms have been **ending worlds for as long as they have been in
existence**]{.underline}," except [that harm]{.underline}---[of
dispossession]{.underline}, [genocide]{.underline},
[exploitation]{.underline}, [post-nuclear contamination]{.underline},
[environmental toxicity]{.underline}, [desertification]{.underline},
[forced displacement]{.underline}, [and so on]{.underline}---[has been
**exported**]{.underline} to non-white communities.

Engaging with the racialized impact of environmental damage, Yusoff
renounces framing the Anthropocene as a new condition that forgets its
histories of oppression and extraction; instead, she points to the
humanism-inspired division of matter into nonlife and life as pertinent
to the racial organization of power, foundational to New World
geographies. Thus, for Yusoff (2018: 5), tracing "the traffic between
the inhuman as matter and the inhuman as race, is to examine how the
concept of the inhuman is the connective hinge in the twinned discourses
of geology and humanism" (original emphasis; see also Yusoff, 2013,
2016). In the categorization of matter as a commodity with properties,
but without subjective will or agency, both "dispossession of land (for
extraction) and dispossessions of persons in chattel slavery (as another
form of spatial extraction) are enacted" (Yusoff, 2018: 6). Since
different kinds of extractive genealogy are closely related to each
other (and to Eurocentric, humanist modes of thinking), the strategy of
approaching race "as a geologic proposition" (Yusoff, 2018: 6) opens new
ways of conceiving of the racialized genealogies of the Anthropocene and
to think geology as a relation of power founded on the division between
life (human, white) and nonlife (inhuman, flesh, non-white). After all,
as LeMenager (2014: 5) reminds us, oil has figured as a replacement of
slave labor (see also Nikiforuk, 2012), which aligns the practices of
extracting fossil fuels with the complex socio-economic machinery
enabling appropriation of energy generated by the enslaved bodies---a
process willfully hidden under the banner of development, progress, and
civilizational change, and performed for the sake of their advancement.
Such a conceptualization calls for an explicit acknowledgment of the
(historical) role of racialization and (settler) colonialisms in the
production of global spaces that constitute what is now called the
Anthropocene. In both Wynter's and Yusoff's understandings, violence
against the inhuman is built into the structure of humanism, while the
way in which inhuman matter has been defined makes this form of violence
invisible and unacknowledged in the dominant (memorial) discourse.

It seems that in its [**future-oriented** rhetoric]{.underline},
dystopic as it may be, the turn to planetary sensitivity in memory
studies [risks **failing to acknowledge**]{.underline} the current
condition's own histories of "colonial earth-writing," [violent
dispossession]{.underline} "[under the auspices of **colonial
geo-logics**]{.underline}," and of the "extractive grammars of geology"
(Yusoff, 2018: 2) instrumentalized for imperial purposes. [These violent
amnesias manifest in today's naturalized **hierarchization** of
spectacular versus unspectacular violence]{.underline}, a structure in
which certain processes' belonging to one of these categories is not
only premised on the character of experienced violence (e.g. slow vs
fast), but by who/what is affected by its very operations. Acknowledging
the genealogies of social stratifications, as well as recognizing their
ongoing legacies, enables the understanding that [what counts as
**unspectacular** violence is in fact **quite
spectacular**]{.underline}; however, [these]{.underline} (un)spectacular
developments [remain **concealed from view** by the constant operation
of structures of exclusion shaping]{.underline} the global [economies of
attention]{.underline}, memory, [and care]{.underline}.

Toward a minor remembrance

[Rather than]{.underline} clinging to the somewhat universalizing move
of "**[thinking big]{.underline}**" (or "thinking spectacular") [in the
context of the **catastrophic planetary condition**]{.underline}, [my
proposition here is]{.underline} to scale-down memory studies
investigations with the aim of focusing on the more situated, localized,
private, or indeed unspectacular, experiences of violence. Nevertheless,
such a recalibration cannot be achieved without simultaneously keeping
in mind larger scale temporal and spatial processes. Only [a
**multiscalar analysis**]{.underline}---something that, as Keightley et
al. (2019: 5) argue, the discipline of memory studies has "failed" to do
(see also Van De Putte, 2022)4---has the potential [to
reveal]{.underline} (and remember) [the **multiple facets** of
violence]{.underline}, [to better understand how it
**unfolds**]{.underline}, [and to undertake actions to **counter** its
ongoing detrimental effects]{.underline}. Thinking with feminist
geopolitics5 could be productive in this regard, especially given the
complex entanglement of the geo and the political within the current
debates about both the roots and routes of environmental change.6

Critical of the implicit binarized framework of Nixon's
conceptualization, feminist geopoliticians Christian and Dowler (2019:
1067) argue for a more "relational" approach to violence, enabling [a
conception of]{.underline} "[fast and slow violence as a part of
a]{.underline} '**[single complex]{.underline}**'" (see also Pain,
2015). Returning to the feminist theorization of continuities between
different forms and modalities of violence (cultural, structural,
direct), such an approach [offers]{.underline} "[a **vital pathway** to
address]{.underline} the representational challenge of [slow violence's
invisibility]{.underline}" (Christian and Dowler, 2019: 1068). As the
two authors emphasize, feminists have consistently invested in
explorations of the banal, the everyday, and the invisible,
demonstrating how structural violence regularly and silently invades the
ordinary and the intimate (Christian et al., 2016; Dowler and Sharp,
2001; Hyndman, 2001, 2004; Mountz and Hyndman, 2006; Pain, 2015; Pain
and Staeheli, 2014; Wright, 2008), as well as expounding in detail the
structural reasons of the unequal distribution of concern among the
spectacular/fast/public and unspectacular/slow/private operations of
violence. They have also revealed the links between political violence
and its aftermath (Belcher, 2018; Faria, 2017), as well as exposing
parallel mechanisms of political violence (or military strategies) and
domestic abuse in intimate contexts (Dowler and Sharp, 2001; Pain, 2015;
Pain and Staeheli, 2014; Pratt and Rosner, 2006). Drawing on these
insights, Christian and Dowler (2019: 1072) argue that "slow
\[unspectacular\] forms of violence imbricate with the fast
\[spectacular\], and the fast \[spectacular\] inescapably shapes the
slow \[unspectacular\]." Such [a relational understanding]{.underline},
[rather than focusing on the]{.underline} extrapolation of
[**dissimilarities** between different scales]{.underline} and
modalities, [enables comprehension of the **continuity** of diverse
workings of]{.underline} (political/colonial/environmental)
[violence]{.underline}, "[**linking** the invisible to the highly
visible]{.underline}" (Christian and Dowler, 2019: 1072). [Maneuvering
across **different scales** of analysis]{.underline}---from
global/planetary to intimate/local---[advances a **more encompassing
view** of]{.underline} the [important continuities]{.underline} between
colonial genealogies of environmental change and the racialized
cartographies of exploitation, extraction, and implication. In the
context of the reflections presented in this essay, I believe that [the
notion of the]{.underline} "**[single complex of
violence]{.underline}**"7 can offer a useful framework in at least two
aspects. First, it [enables the **colonial** and **extractive**
dimensions of imperialist]{.underline}, [Eurocentric expansion to be
**linked**]{.underline} as two facets of the same logic. Second, it
facilitates the connection of the violent legacies of humanist thinking
to the ongoing racialized exposure to environmental damage. The
[routinized harms]{.underline} of racism **[accumulate in deadly
ways]{.underline}** (cf. Christian and Dowler, 2019: 1072), [even
if]{.underline} current racism's [consequences **seem**]{.underline} to
be [**detached** from]{.underline} its [colonial origins]{.underline}.
[Such a situation produces conditions for a **neat reproduction of
exclusionary thinking**]{.underline}. In that sense, [treating
spectacular and unspectacular violence as part of a **single complex**
provides us with conceptual tools to **challenge**]{.underline} the
(raced) [epistemologies which]{.underline} tend to [**politicize** what
passes as spectacular while]{.underline} simultaneously
[**depoliticizing** what is deemed unspectacular]{.underline}, [and to
expose the **multiscale**]{.underline}, parallel, and entangled
[**operations** of different modalities and forms of
violence]{.underline}. Keeping the two terms, however, is strategically
salient, as it helps to critically unpack (and challenge) the causes and
methods of affording a different degree of attention to what figures as
spectacular and unspectacular developments (cf. Christian and Dowler,
2019).

39 as political actors. To Alfred and Corntassel, "it is this
oppositional, place-based existence, along with the consciousness of
being in struggle against the dispossessing and demeaning fact of
colonization by foreign peoples, that fundamentally distinguishes
Indigenous peoples from other peoples of the world."106 Similarly, Maaka
and Fleras claim "Aboriginal peoples share a common desire to transcend
colonial mentalities, contest existing constitutional principles,
challenge the normalisation of injustices within systems of power, and
transform the structures of dominance that distort and disrupt."107 For
indigenous peoples, understood to "derive much of their identity from
histories of state-sponsored genocide, forced settlement, relocation,
political marginalization, and various formal attempts at cultural
destruction,"108 non-dominance and resistance to it, experienced both
personally and inter-generationally, are defining features of indigenous
identity and lived experience. Though indigenous peoples are
non-dominant to different degrees and in different ways, their
political, economic, and social domination by historical and
contemporary settler-colonial societies constitutes the political
salience of their claims to indigeneity. As theorized in Chapter 3 and
examined empirically in Chapters 4-7, nondominance is also central to
the forms of in/security experienced by Indigenous peoples in the
circumpolar region. Despite recent achievements and significant progress
in global indigenous politics, which signify improvement in the
relationships between many Indigenous peoples and their colonial
metropoles, I suggest that Arctic Indigenous peoples experience
non-dominance in terms of their ability to define and pursue security.
2.1.1 Colonialism and Power [**[Non-dominance]{.mark}** [results
from]{.mark} [the]{.mark} **shortage** or **[absence of
power]{.mark}**]{.underline}, defined by Barnett and Duvall as "the
production, in and through social relations, of effects that shape the
capacities of actors to determine their circumstances and fate ... the
capacities of actors to determine the conditions of 106 Alfred and
Corntassel 2005, 597. 107 Maaka and Fleras 2005, 9. 108 Niezen 2003, 5.
40 their existence."109 Power takes at least four different forms
depending on the kinds and specificity of social relations through which
it operates: compulsory, institutional, structural, and productive.110
All four forms of power have historically structured the relations
between indigenous peoples and settler-colonial states, but in modern
Arctic societies compulsory power has generally receded as political
actors have increasingly acknowledged Indigenous peoples' inherent,
constitutional, and legal rights. However, [[institutional power
as]{.mark} "**[actors']{.mark}** indirect **[control]{.mark}** over the
[conditions]{.mark} [of]{.mark} action of **[socially distant
others]{.mark}**," **[structural]{.mark} power** "as the constitutive
relations of a direct and specific \[kind\]," [and]{.mark} [productive
power]{.mark} [as]{.mark} "diffusive constitutive [relations]{.mark} [to
produce]{.mark} the situated **[social capacities]{.mark}** of
actors,"111 all remain applicable [to]{.mark} the power states
[exert]{.mark} [over]{.mark} **[Arctic Indigenous peoples]{.mark}**. In
reverse order, the very [establishment of settler states
constitutes]{.mark} [Indigenous peoples]{.mark} by producing them
[as]{.mark} a **[sub-altern]{.mark}** population [within]{.mark} their
own territories (**[productive power]{.mark}**).]{.underline} [Specific
indigenous peoples have been constituted and [shaped]{.mark}
[through]{.mark} the **[policies]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} actions of
**settler states**, for example in terms of policies of relocation and
**amalgamation**]{.underline} of indigenous communities, or through the
very [[designation]{.mark} of specific peoples as indigenous or **[not
through legal]{.mark}** and constitutional
[instruments]{.mark}]{.underline} (structural power). Finally, the
[institutions and agents of **[settler governance]{.mark}** continue to
[exercise]{.mark} **direct** and **indirect [authority]{.mark}**
[over]{.mark} the political and **collective [decisions]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} [Indigenous peoples]{.mark}, structuring Indigenous
self-government and **[constraining]{.mark}** their capacity to realize

### Alt---Blockade---1NC

#### Vote neg to [blockade]{.underline} the 1AC. 'Try-or-die' flips [neg]{.underline}---colonial [catastrophe]{.underline} is decolonial [possibility]{.underline}.

**Cowen, 24**---professor of geography at the University of Toronto
(Deborah, "Crisis in Motion," South Atlantic Quarterly (2024) 123 (2):
297--320, dml)

Barbadian poet Kamau Brathwaite writes, "That moment of utter disaster,
the very moment when it seems almost hopeless, too difficult to proceed,
you begin to glimpse a kind of radiance on the other end of the
maelstrom" (McSweeney n.d.). [This capacity to see **possibility**
through the depths of **catastrophe**]{.underline} and to do so from a
place of investment is exquisite and humbling. Estes [crafts
a]{.underline} similar [**path** through the crisis of settler colonial
infrastructure]{.underline}. Estes (2019) writes that "[new
**pipelines** are creeping across the continent like a
**spiderweb**]{.underline}, [with **frightening speed**]{.underline},
[but in the process]{.underline}, [they are also **connecting** and
**inciting to action** disparate communities of the exploited and
dispossessed]{.underline}."

[The catastrophe of current times is clear]{.underline}. Across these
three entangled stories of expanded reproduction, I have lingered
[in]{.underline} the violence: [the **necropolitics** of contemporary
supply chains]{.underline}, [the **colonial afterlives** of its
infrastructures]{.underline}, [and the **destruction of planetary
ecologies** that have us hurtling toward **apocalypse**]{.underline}.
But [what marks this moment is not just **crisis** but the **movements**
creating possibility for **substantial** and **sustained
transformation**]{.underline}. At each of the many sites we have
encountered, [fierce struggle confronts efforts to expand imperial
reproduction]{.underline}. [From **Amazon workers** to the
**Amazon**]{.underline}, [from the streets of **Montreal** to the
**central plains**]{.underline}, [these]{.underline} "[disparate
communities of the exploited and dispossessed]{.underline}" [are
**saying no** and investing]{.underline} instead [in]{.underline}
motion\'s **[fugitive forms]{.underline}**. [In their refusal of the
status quo]{.underline}, [these movements make possible other forms of
motion]{.underline}.

Mohawk scholar Audra Simpson (2014) pursues the concept of
**[refusal]{.underline}** in the context of colonial dispossession,
suggesting that it [is distinct from]{.underline}
"**[resistance]{.underline}**" [in that it rejects outright the **entire
paradigm** of colonial thought]{.underline}, [value]{.underline}, [and
action]{.underline}. Refusal is the rejection of settler state
legitimacy and authority, she argues, and [it opens up]{.underline} "[a
possibility for **doing things differently**]{.underline}" (7). Tina
Campt (2019) also sees refusal as "a rejection of the status quo as
livable and the creation of possibility in the face of negation." For
Campt, [it is]{.underline} "[a refusal to recognize a system that
renders you fundamentally illegible and unintelligible]{.underline} . .
. [**using** **negation** as a **generative** and **creative source** of
disorderly power to embrace the possibility of living
otherwise]{.underline}."

In her engagement with the spatial practice of refusal, Leanne Simpson
(2021) tells stories of the beaver. She explores the work of this
beautiful creature that blocks some flows, enabling whole new ecologies
to flourish. [The **blockade** is a]{.underline} "**[counter
logistical]{.underline}**" [practice of refusal that
exemplifies]{.underline} this perspective of having [both **disruptive**
and **generative effects**]{.underline}. [Blockades have long been
mobilized against colonial infrastructure to **disrupt colonial
circulation**]{.underline}. At a recent forum with leaders in the "Land
Back" movement, Kanahus Manuel, a member of the Secwepemc Women\'s
Warrior Society, explained, "Blockades have been one of our go-tos as
Indigenous people when we\'re talking about direct action" (Yellowhead
Institute 2020). Manuel situates the power of the blockade in the
context of extractive logistics: "I think about the resources extracted
without our consent. It\'s always about getting these raw resources from
Indigenous territories out to the global market." Manuel further
suggests that [the blockade isn\'t only about **blocking** but about
also **building**]{.underline}. She continues, "The blockade is a place
where we as Indigenous people, our sovereignty, our jurisdiction and our
territorial authority, confront the assumed colonial authority and
jurisdiction. They think they own the land, but we know we own the land,
and the blockade is where we meet." At the same forum, Mollie Wickam,
spokesperson for the Gitemd\'en clan of the Wet\'suwet\'en people, spoke
to the creative capacity of blockades. "It started as a blockade. We set
up a blockade, the RCMP came in and raided, got an injunction against
us. But we are still living out on the territory and it\'s a resurgence
that spread from coast to coast." She continues, "When we shut down the
road . . . as soon as Wet\'suwe\'ten people had control over their
territory . . . the waters run clear again, the animals return. And you
can actually live as a free person. I don\'t know how many people have
actually experienced what that feels like. We\'ve felt it."

Manuel contributed to this extraordinary discussion from the front lines
of a blockade, in a kind of mobius strip of theory and action. This
blockade is one installation of the Tiny House Warriors, a group that
Manuel founded. They build very small homes, directly in the pathway of
the Trans Mountain Pipeline Expansion project, strategically placing
them next to proposed "man camps" to challenge the rampant violence they
concentrate on Indigenous women. The tiny houses are also being equipped
with off-grid solar systems. Village sites "operate under the authority
of Secwepemc law to reassert collective jurisdiction and title over the
whole of our unceded territory" (Tiny House Warriors n.d.).

Dakota scholar Kim Tallbear (2016) has noted the leadership of women and
gender nonconforming folx in Indigenous resurgence and theorizes the
tight relations of care and courage that fuel its feminism. Winona
Laduke and I (2020) have termed [this]{.underline} kind of feminist
assemblage of systems to sustain decolonial life "alimentary
infrastructure." Alimentary infrastructure [is **life-giving** in its
design]{.underline}, [finance]{.underline}, [and
effects]{.underline}---[it **refuses** expanded reproduction and
supports the **regeneration** and **becoming** of
ecologies]{.underline}. Metis scholar Jordan Kinder (2021) describes an
enriched sense of "embodied infrastructure" in the work of the Tiny
House Warriors. Kinder describes their practice as "[a return to
harnessing flows in ways that **foreground** Indigenous epistemologies
and ways of being]{.underline}," one that "[**disrupts** resource logics
and their operations]{.underline}."

Refusal also animates the contemporary abolition movement. In fact, if
movements for land back through [blockade]{.underline} are about
building as much as breaking, we might consider movements for abolition
as plotting radical reproduction. Abolition is not simply a resistance
to the violence of policing or an effort to reform carceral systems, it
[is a rejection of the **infrastructures** of
coloniality]{.underline}---the "infrastructures of feeling," on
Gilmore\'s terms, of white supremacy and the physical infrastructures on
which they are built that produce premature death. [**Dismantling**
violent infrastructures that terrorize some as a means of protecting the
reproduction of others remains]{.underline} a **[key]{.underline}** to
abolition precisely because organizations like the RCMP were founded on
the protection of primitive accumulation through infrastructure
expansion, and this continues to this day. Black Lives Matter--Toronto
cofounder Sandy Hudson (2020) provocatively questions, precisely when in
the RCMP\'s history did they depart from their "literal original purpose
of terrorizing Black & Indigenous communities?" Abolition demands that
reckoning.

At the same time, movement leaders regularly repeat that [abolition is
about **more** than dismantling carceral infrastructure]{.underline};
[it is about **cultivating alternatives**]{.underline}. "What if
[abolition is something that **grows**]{.underline}?" asks Gumbs (2008)
in Critical Resistance\'s collection Abolition Now! Ruthie Gilmore
(2018) insists that "abolition is not absence, it is presence. [What the
world will become **already exists** in fragments and
pieces]{.underline}, [experiments and possibilities]{.underline}. . . .
Abolition is building the future from the present, in all of the ways we
can." This positive vision of abolition as already here becomes clear in
an example that BLM-TO cofounder Janaya Khan offers. In response to a
community member\'s question about existing examples of transformative
justice that do not rely on calling police, Khan suggested, "First and
foremost, [we need to look at models that **already
exist**]{.underline}," specifically citing the experience of elders
(Khan and Newbold 2018). Khan then explains that there is much to learn
from the survivance of Black trans sex workers, and their creative work
in assembling alternative infrastructures of community safety. Khan
explains, "When a client is violent or dangerous, they can\'t call the
cops. Sex work is not decriminalized here. In fact, it\'s heavily
criminalized. And so, Black trans sex workers have invented and
implemented safety strategies in order to keep each other safe because
it\'s not an option to call the police."

[Movements that are making and marking our moment are working to **build
a future** from the]{.underline} "fragments and pieces, experiments and
[possibilities]{.underline}" [that **survive the violence** of imperial
motions]{.underline}. [They are diagnosing the crisis of expanded
reproduction]{.underline}---[and **refusing** to seek **inclusion** on a
sinking ship]{.underline}. Instead, [they are working]{.underline}---as
Octavia Butler encouraged---[to **shape change**]{.underline}. Leanne
Simpson (2014: 13) writes that decolonization is something her ancestors
"set in motion." [Only in that motion]{.underline}, and in the
alimentary infrastructures that support and sustain it, [may we move
toward the radiance **beyond the maelstrom**]{.underline}.

Recent postrepresentational approaches to cartography have advocated for
a perspective that understands \'\[m\]apmaking and map use\' as
\'embodied and dynamic\', emphasising that \'[maps are
constituted]{.underline} in and [through]{.underline}
**[diverse]{.underline}**, **[discursive]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[material processes]{.underline}**\' (Kitchin,
Perkins, and Dodge 2007, 17). Turning their attention to \'living
cartographies\' and foregrounding what maps do as well as what people do
with maps (Rossetto 2014, 522-6), these [critical trends have rethought
mapping as]{.underline} performative and **[emergent]{.underline}**, as
**[ongoing]{.underline}** actions-in-**[process]{.underline}**, and
created links between cartographic theory and fields such as
phenomenology, cognitive science, and new materialism. These new
directions in cartographic theory are particularly useful for
discussions of [decolonial mapping]{.underline} projects because they
[counter]{.underline} the [association between]{.underline}
**[cartography]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[abstraction]{.underline}** [that informs]{.underline} national and
**[colonial cartographies]{.underline}** [at the expense of **lived
experience**]{.underline} (see Roth 2009). For Bjørn Sletto, such
[cartographic abstraction]{.underline} \'inevitably
[effect\[s\]]{.underline} **[violencе]{.underline}** [to
the]{.underline} **[fluid]{.underline}**, **[shifting]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[socially contingent]{.underline}** [nature
of]{.underline} **[lived]{.underline}**, **[indigenous spatial
relationships]{.underline}**\' (2009, 147). Similarly, Renee Pualani
Louis et al. write that [\'there is still a tendency to
view]{.underline} **[Western cartography]{.underline}** [as the
standard]{.underline} by which all other cartographies are measured\'
(2012, 77). 'Western cartography\' is here understood as a territorial
form of mapping that fixes space and sets boundaries. Indeed, as Annita
Hetoev\'ehotohke\'e Lucchesi maintains, \'many [Indigenous nations
have]{.underline} rich **[traditions of mapping]{.underline}**\', and
she aims \'to dispel the myth that Indigenous peoples did not, and do
not, draw maps (2018, 2). As she argues, \'rhetoric and scholarship that
ignores Indigenous cartographic practices denies thousands of years of
advancements, traditions, and intellectual property created by
Indigenous people\' (2018, 14). For her, the [decolonial]{.underline}
potential of [maps]{.underline} lies in their capacity to
[create]{.underline} **[connections]{.underline}** [to the
land]{.underline} (2018, 15) [and]{.underline} \'[tell Indigenous
stories in a meaningful way]{.underline}\' (2018, 12). In
**[Sápmi]{.underline}**, for instance, **[joiks]{.underline}**
[are]{.underline} **[living maps]{.underline}** of the land;
[the]{.underline} soundscape of the [joik recalls]{.underline} the [land
and is a performative act of the landscape]{.underline},
[mountain]{.underline}, [animal]{.underline}, [or person made alive
through the joik]{.underline}.

More broadly, we argue that [combining a focus on mapping
as]{.underline} a **[creative]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[embodied]{.underline}** practice [with]{.underline} **[Indigenous
cartographic thought]{.underline}** and spatial philosophies
[highlights]{.underline} the **[transformative]{.underline}** and
**[generative potential]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}
**[cartography]{.underline}** and opens up the very understanding of
what constitutes maps and mapping, whether in the context of Indigenous
or non-Indigenous artistic and cultural production from the circumpolar
Arctic. We will begin by focusing on the theoretical and methodological
context of cartography as an instrument of power in colonial and
Indigenous contexts and go on to discuss [examples from]{.underline}
[Nunavik]{.underline}, [Sápmi]{.underline}, [Kalaallit
Nunaat]{.underline} (Greenland), [and]{.underline} [Norway]{.underline}.
[These]{.underline} political and artistic initiatives
[involve]{.underline} **[reversals]{.underline}** of cartography
[and]{.underline} **[counter-mappings]{.underline}** [of the
Artic]{.underline}. They credit **[aesthetics]{.underline}** with the
ability to **[redefine]{.underline}** [spatial]{.underline} [perceptions
and]{.underline}, consequently, to [act upon]{.underline} **[existing
power dynamics.]{.underline}** In doing so, [they transmit]{.underline}
**[ancestral knowledge]{.underline}**, **[imagine beyond colonial
violence]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[assert Indigenous
self-determination]{.underline}**.

Cartography as an instrument of power: colonialism and maps?

The North in its entirety can be considered a colonial and militarised
territory, where, nowadays, [decolonial initiatives]{.underline} have
arisen. Among these, several [are rooted in mapping]{.underline}.
[Cartography has]{.underline} [been forced upon the land in]{.underline}
such **[violent ways]{.underline}** that [the only way forward is to
overthrow the practice itself]{.underline}. [Settler
colonialism]{.underline} is not only a political issue; it also
[consists in imposing a way of thinking]{.underline} (considered
superior) [which devalues]{.underline} and replaces
[Indigenous]{.underline} cultural practices and
[ontologies]{.underline}. Maps determine the locations of the centre and
the fringes, as well as the ways in which the land is occupied. As
historically strategic tools, they make it possible to claim an entire
territory without even setting foot on it. The [Rupert\'s Land
treaties]{.underline} and the monopolies held by the major colonial
companies, such as the Hudson\'s Bay Company\'s hold over what is now
the Canadian North, for instance, [gave precedence to the authority of
the word]{.underline} - by the power vested in me, [I hereby declare
that this land belongs to]{.underline} such and such - over physical
occupation. As Bernard Nietschmann puts it, \'\[[more indigenous
territory has been claimed by maps than by guns]{.underline}\' (1994,
37). Indeed, [Europeans]{.underline} took possession of territories
before they set out to explore them. [Maps are]{.underline}
**[agents]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} this [power]{.underline} and
replace the experience of roaming the land with a cartographic
abstraction that will later serve as proof of property, for instance
during subsequent territorial negotiations.

Furthermore, [maps thwart toponymy]{.underline}, [replacing it sometimes
with the]{.underline} **[settler's lexicon]{.underline}**, and at other
times, rather cynically, with something like '[great white
expanse]{.underline}', signaling the unknown (rather than admitting
ignorance) and emptiness (in lieu of acknowledgement). In the Americas,
this imperialist [cartographic violence denies]{.underline} any
[recognition of]{.underline} prior [Indigenous presence]{.underline}, as
acknowledging it would negate the very vocabulary that Europeans used to
claim the land: \'[the]{.underline} **[New World]{.underline}**\', \'New
England\', \'New France\', \'the discovery of America\', \'the founding
of Canada\'. [To allow for the conqueror\'s gesture]{.underline},
[Indigenous toponymy must be silenced]{.underline}.

This [cartographic overwriting leads to the silencing]{.underline} not
only of place names, but also of prior cultures and practices. [Maps
render the land]{.underline} -- an essential and concrete element for
Indigenous cultures - [abstract]{.underline}, [dematerialising
it]{.underline} and [devaluing its empirical understanding]{.underline},
favouring sedentary life over nomadism. Geographer and linguist
Louis-Edmond Hamelin, who advocated for a \'geography of the feet\',
calling for trajectories, experiences, and field observations, writes
that \'such condescending behaviour can only serve to distort the
perception of facts on the ground\' (Hamelin, Chartier, and Désy 2013,
41).3 [For peoples under colonial rule who still]{.underline} have to
[live with the performative efforts of colonial maps]{.underline} within
their governance, [such as the Inuit and the Sámi]{.underline},
**[overthrowing]{.underline}** [cartographic perspectives is a way
to]{.underline} **[transform]{.underline}** [the political
order]{.underline}.

Analysing cartography implies above all examining the conventions that
enable the transformation of the land into an abstract entity, as well
as the values that underlie its cultural portrayal. In that sense, it
goes without saying that [acts of reversal serve as]{.underline}
**[resistance]{.underline}** to settler colonialism. This [defiance can
be Indigenous or not]{.underline}; the artwork América Invertida (1943)
by Joaquín Torres García, an avant-garde artist from Uruguay, has become
iconic in South American cultures and is a perfect example of this
attitude, with its caption reading \'Our North Is the South\'. Robin
McGrath notes. that [in several schools of the Canadian
Arctic]{.underline}, the [map]{.underline} of Canada [is pinned up
upside down]{.underline} (1991, 3). These [reversals lie at the heart
of]{.underline} the **[decolonial struggle]{.underline}**. However, they
cannot reverse the colonial process that favours abstract understanding
over experience and devalues narrative, the foremost method of knowledge
transmission used in many Indigenous cultures.

Far from being a neutral gesture, [portraying the North as
a]{.underline} **[blank space]{.underline}** as per the Western
tradition [has]{.underline} **[social]{.underline}**,
**[political]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[environmental
consequences]{.underline}**. [Cartography has located the Arctic on
the]{.underline} **[outskirts]{.underline}** [of the
world]{.underline}\'s surface [and]{.underline} thereby
**[accentuated]{.underline}** [the foreignness]{.underline} of the
region. [Settler colonialism]{.underline} **[disregards]{.underline}**
the **[political]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[territorial
systems]{.underline}** already in place; [borders]{.underline},
generally abstract ones, [are traced in order to delineate the
land]{.underline}. Two other strategies serve to overwrite Indigenous
understanding of the land in favour of colonial powers: the omitting and
replacing of toponyms. Both negate the history of the territory and
promote the establishment of the colonising power. Instating new
boundaries and overwriting existing toponymy goes hand in hand with
devaluing Indigenous methods of orientation and their pre-existing
cartography and usage of the land. Yet Indigenous peoples\' cartographic
practices were useful to the first European settlers, who leveraged
Indigenous knowledge of the land to explore the American continent.
However, as Georges Emery Sioui deplores, European colonialism dictates
a hierarchy of knowledge that places its modes of thinking, technology,
and spatial organisation above those of other continents (1989). As
Irène Hirt writes,

> \[history has retained few traces of past Indigenous maps - either
> because they were destroyed or because they were transient, drawn on
> sand or on the ashes of a bonfire, or at best on bark or animal skins.
> Furthermore, a portion of these cartographies was immaterial, based on
> cognitive processes (images, mental depictions) or performances
> (rituals, poetic narratives, chants, dances). (2009, 173)

[Colonial maps allowed states to]{.underline} **[shrink]{.underline}**
[Indigenous property to]{.underline} **[tiny]{.underline}**
'**[reservations]{.underline}**' [bound by]{.underline}
**[restrictive]{.underline}** and compulsory **[borders]{.underline}**.
The [naming process]{.underline} itself, the [act of
delineating]{.underline} 'unknown' or '**[uninhabited]{.underline}**'
**[zones]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[exploration]{.underline}**
[followed by]{.underline} **[appropriation]{.underline}** [are part of
a]{.underline} broader **[Cartesian resolve]{.underline}** [to
control]{.underline} the **[land]{.underline}** [through
the]{.underline} **[rational mind]{.underline}**. [This
gesture]{.underline} **[underpins]{.underline}** the **[institutional
power]{.underline}** [which is]{.underline} later [carried out by
the]{.underline} **[map]{.underline}**: [the]{.underline}
**[state]{.underline}**, [the]{.underline} **[law]{.underline}**,
[the]{.underline} **[border]{.underline}** (cf. Said 1993, 225).
[Restoring]{.underline} a geographical and cultural
[identity]{.underline}, as well as reclaiming one's history, thus
[requires]{.underline} a **[reflection]{.underline}**
[beyond]{.underline} **[Western political frameworks]{.underline}**,
[focusing on]{.underline} the forms and hierarchy of knowledge, and
appropriating [the]{.underline} **[map]{.underline}** [as an instrument
of power]{.underline}. This appropriation calls for an act of
**[reversal]{.underline}** [that]{.underline}
**[highlights]{.underline}** [the force carried out by the
map]{.underline}, [followed by a promotion of]{.underline} the
**[toponymy]{.underline}** [that existed prior to]{.underline}
**[colonisation]{.underline}**, as we will now see in the case of Inuit
cartographic practices in Northern Canada.

Conceptualizing Indigenous sovereignty

Notions of Indigenous sovereignty are connected to the right to
self-determination. [[Decolonization must seek the conceptualization and
expression of Indigenous sovereignty outside of the western hegemony and
enduring colonial structures;]{.mark} self-determination and sovereignty
are limited when they can only be articulated within the existing
capitalist order]{.underline}.^39)^ Dr. Melanie K. Yazzie presents the
idea of anti-capitalist decolonization to challenge the "hegemonic
formation of 'extractivism' and its liberal, capitalist,
heteropatriarchal, and settler colonial valance of
development".^40)^ [[This approach]{.mark} to decolonization seems
especially well suited to the Alaskan context as it [critiques how
resource development is carried out in a capitalist system]{.mark},
instead of presenting resource extraction as something inherently at
odds with indigeneity.]{.underline} Indigenous sovereignty is reliant on
the ability of communities to have autonomy over their resources and
decision-making, as they have for thousands of years.^41)^ [[An
anti-capitalist approach to decolonization offers a way to center
Indigenous epistemologies]{.mark} and enable economic, societal,
cultural, and political pathways conceptualized and implemented by
Alaska Native people themselves.]{.underline}

The ideas presented throughout this article are applicable well beyond
the US Arctic, and beyond the realm of resource development. [Interest
in [exploiting natural resources drove historic colonization throughout
the]{.mark} entire [Arctic region]{.mark} and the lingering structures
and systems of power [continue to shape Indigenous lives]{.mark} and

the Arctic Region*---which differs, in one way, from the prior 2013
edition in making no mention of oil or gas^42)^---there is a need for
further research and analysis to identify the implications of this new
strategy on efforts to decolonize and achieve Indigenous sovereignty.
There is also a need to center and privilege Indigenous voices in this
space and, as such, future research must be informed and conceptualized
by and for Arctic Indigenous populations.

[Decolonial]{.underline} and anticolonial [writing in IR has
sought]{.underline} to **[move beyond]{.underline}** **[uncovering
practices]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} colonial
**[erasure]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[violence]{.underline}**
[to instead]{.underline} [focus]{.underline}ing [on how these processes
can be]{.underline} **[disrupted]{.underline}**,
**[dismantled]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[unsettled]{.underline}** to engender new imaginative possibilities
for the study of IR. Olivia Rutazibwa (2023, 325) contributes to this
endeavour by narrating an account of her lived experiences to reflect on
questions of 'the purpose and ethos of scholarly inquiry and how that
translates into decolonial academic praxis'. By foregrounding these
questions, Rutazibwa (2023, 325) demonstrates that the answers to these
require a sober reflection on the 'limitations and impossibilities of
decolonising disciplines' (Rutazibwa 2023, 325). Inspired by the
insights from reparative and abolitionist writing (Gilmore Wilson 2020;
Davis et al 2022), Rutazibwa (2023, 326) shows that a [commitment
towards decolonising]{.underline} and unsettling [requires]{.underline}
**[consideration]{.underline}** [of what]{.underline} '**[we need to let
go of rather than enrich or diversify]{.underline}**'. [Such an
invitation is particularly useful]{.underline} [for]{.underline} a
discipline such as [IR]{.underline}, which has focused much scholarly
attention and debate on the subject of globalising and diversifying
(Acharya and Buzan 2010; Tickner and Blaney 2012; Acharya 2014; Eun
2023). While acknowledging the generative contribution of this
scholarship, Rutazibwa (2023, 325) argues it risks continuing to
reproduce rather than re-imagine, being 'at best a minimal rather than a
sufficient condition of decolonisation or going against empire'. Urging
readers to reconsider where they begin their thinking, Rutazibwa (2023,
326) asks '**[what happens after inclusion]{.underline}**'. Offering a
gentle and tentative response to this, she weaves together a range of
authors who have inspired her thinking to 'curate a patchwork of
potential diagnoses and alternatives' that researchers can adopt when
committed 'to thinking about what happens after inclusion' (Rutazibwa
2023, 330). This contributes to the [wider]{.underline} decolonial
literature that has examined alternative methodological possibilities,
which can be harnessed to re-imagine IR anti-colonially, including
redefining disciplinary ideas of expertise, rigour and truth (Shilliam
2010), decentring mastery in favour of cultivation (Shilliam 2015;
Rutazibwa 2020; Boer Cueva et al 2023), re-imagining isolated and
individualised knowledge practices instead as spaces of relation and
interconnection (Tynan 2020; Tynan and Bishop 2023), renegotiating our
investment in IR and disciplines (Krishna 2001), re-locating
disciplinary and knowledge centres (Waever and Tickner 2009; Chen 2010;
Koomen 2019; Hinds 2023) and prioritising the study of life over death
(Tuck 2009; Krystalli and Schulz 2022; Siklodi et al 2024). These
[interventions highlight]{.underline} the **[potential]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} '**[divesting from violent knowledge
practices]{.underline}**' [through]{.underline}
**[shifting]{.underline}** the **[rationalities]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[tools]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}
**[learn]{.underline}**, **[know]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[practice IR]{.underline}** (Siklodi et al 2024, 7).

In generating these alternative avenues, [decolonial
scholarship]{.underline} in IR (and beyond) [has been attuned to
the]{.underline} necessary **[incompleteness]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[(im)possibility]{.underline}** [of this endeavour
to]{.underline} think and **[re-imagine]{.underline}** [IR]{.underline}
and the academy **[anti-colonially]{.underline}** (Sabaratnam 2011;
Motta 2019; Díaz Calderón 2021; El Kurd 2023; Sen 2023). This
scholarship has shown that a deep [commitment to decoloniality
requires]{.underline} **[forgoing fixity]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[certainty]{.underline}** (Rutazibwa 2020). In
[letting go]{.underline} of this, these works [demonstrate]{.underline}
the '**[generative purchase of uncertainty]{.underline}**' and what
becomes visible and possible when we alleviate the pressure to pursue a
singular truth or solution (Siklodi et al 2024, 19; see also: Krystalli
et al 2023).

Cumulatively, these [contributions offer]{.underline} the
**[seeds]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} **[renewing]{.underline}** our
**[engagement]{.underline}** [with]{.underline} the discipline of
**[IR]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[knowledge-making]{.underline}**, urging readers to reflect on the
practices that nourish and sustain us and those we should thoughtfully
let go of. [These contributions]{.underline}, however, do not offer a
'pre-set research agenda or methodology to replace all existing ones';
instead, they [provide an invitation to embrace the]{.underline}
**[multiple]{.underline}**, **[unfixed]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[messy pathways]{.underline}** [required to rethink the

39 as political actors. To Alfred and Corntassel, "it is this
oppositional, place-based existence, along with the consciousness of
being in struggle against the dispossessing and demeaning fact of
colonization by foreign peoples, that fundamentally distinguishes
Indigenous peoples from other peoples of the world."106 Similarly, Maaka
and Fleras claim "Aboriginal peoples share a common desire to transcend
colonial mentalities, contest existing constitutional principles,
challenge the normalisation of injustices within systems of power, and
transform the structures of dominance that distort and disrupt."107 For
indigenous peoples, understood to "derive much of their identity from
histories of state-sponsored genocide, forced settlement, relocation,
political marginalization, and various formal attempts at cultural
destruction,"108 non-dominance and resistance to it, experienced both
personally and inter-generationally, are defining features of indigenous
identity and lived experience. Though indigenous peoples are
non-dominant to different degrees and in different ways, their
political, economic, and social domination by historical and
contemporary settler-colonial societies constitutes the political
salience of their claims to indigeneity. As theorized in Chapter 3 and
examined empirically in Chapters 4-7, nondominance is also central to
the forms of in/security experienced by Indigenous peoples in the
circumpolar region. Despite recent achievements and significant progress
in global indigenous politics, which signify improvement in the
relationships between many Indigenous peoples and their colonial
metropoles, I suggest that Arctic Indigenous peoples experience
non-dominance in terms of their ability to define and pursue security.
2.1.1 Colonialism and Power [**Non-[dominance]{.mark}** [results
from]{.mark} the **shortage** or **absence of power**]{.underline},
defined by Barnett and Duvall as "the production, in and through social
relations, of effects that shape the capacities of actors to determine
their circumstances and fate ... the capacities of actors to determine
the conditions of 106 Alfred and Corntassel 2005, 597. 107 Maaka and
Fleras 2005, 9. 108 Niezen 2003, 5. 40 their existence."109 Power takes
at least four different forms depending on the kinds and specificity of
social relations through which it operates: compulsory, institutional,
structural, and productive.110 All four forms of power have historically
structured the relations between indigenous peoples and settler-colonial
states, but in modern Arctic societies compulsory power has generally
receded as political actors have increasingly acknowledged Indigenous
peoples' inherent, constitutional, and legal rights. However,
[[institutional power as]{.mark} "**[actors']{.mark}** indirect
**[control]{.mark}** over the [conditions]{.mark} [of]{.mark} action of
**[socially distant others]{.mark}**," **[structural]{.mark} power** "as
the constitutive relations of a direct and specific \[kind\],"
[and]{.mark} [productive power]{.mark} [as]{.mark} "diffusive
constitutive [relations]{.mark} [to produce]{.mark} the situated
**[social capacities]{.mark}** of actors,"111 all remain applicable
[to]{.mark} the power states [exert]{.mark} [over]{.mark} **[Arctic
Indigenous peoples]{.mark}**. In reverse order, the very [establishment
of settler states constitutes]{.mark} [Indigenous peoples]{.mark} by
producing them [as]{.mark} a **[sub-altern]{.mark}** population
[within]{.mark} their own territories (**[productive
power]{.mark}**).]{.underline} [Specific indigenous peoples have been
constituted and [shaped]{.mark} [through]{.mark} the
**[policies]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} actions of **settler states**, for
example in terms of policies of relocation and
**amalgamation**]{.underline} of indigenous communities, or through the
very [[designation]{.mark} of specific peoples as indigenous or **[not
through legal]{.mark}** and constitutional
[instruments]{.mark}]{.underline} (structural power). Finally, the
[institutions and agents of **[settler governance]{.mark}** continue to
[exercise]{.mark} **direct** and **indirect [authority]{.mark}**
[over]{.mark} the political and **collective [decisions]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} [Indigenous peoples]{.mark}, structuring Indigenous
self-government and **[constraining]{.mark}** their capacity to realize
[selfdetermination]{.mark} (institutional power)]{.underline}.
Non-dominance is not a phenomenon limited to indigenous peoples, and its
social significance is certainly not restricted to its relevance for
in/security. Since "these effects \[of power\] work to the advantage of
some and the disadvantage of others,"112 non-dominance is reflected in
various material and non-material forms throughout the world:
[[groups]{.mark} [experience]{.mark} [poverty]{.mark}, prejudice,
**[injustice]{.mark}**, **[disenfranchisement]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark}
**[violence]{.mark}** [by]{.mark} [virtue]{.mark} [of]{.mark} their
**[structurally determined subordinate]{.mark}**]{.underline},
marginalized, or liminal [[positions]{.underline}]{.mark} within their
societies. Non-dominance is thus constituted in 109 Michael Barnett and
Raymond Duvall, "Power in International Politics," International
Organization 59, no. 1 (2005): 42. 110 Barnett and Duvall 2005, 43. 111
Barnett and Duvall 2005, 48. 112 Barnett and Duvall 2005, 42. 41 varying
ways along multiple societal cleavages dependent upon the specific
context, and not all forms of societal non-dominance may be relevant to
securitization. However, understanding the relationship between power
and non-dominance is important to this dissertation project because it
also influences who is able to contribute, and in what ways, to public
discourse: "Relations of dominance and non-dominance determine who
defines norms and practices and who must follow them; who is important
and who is not; who defines the parameters of the debate and who does
not; who is valuable and who is not."113 In some cases, non-dominance
may translate into structural or systematic restrictions upon a group's
ability to influence government policy regarding designation and defence
against security threats to that group. Securitization nondominance
reflects both structural and institutional power, because it is both
direct and constitutive of actors, and diffused through regulation of
the interactions between particular social actors. Securitization
non-dominance is thus a reflection of broader forms of nondominance as
they pertain to the ability to construct and respond to in/security. The
argument of securitization non-dominance is fully developed in Chapter
3, and the forms of non-dominance experienced by Arctic Indigenous
peoples are discussed further below and in their specific national
contexts in Chapters 4-7. 2.2 Indigenous Peoples in the Arctic
Indigenous peoples in the circumpolar region exhibit both typical and
atypical traits for indigenous peoples in contemporary global politics.
On the one hand, they are historically colonized populations who no
longer exert full decision-making authority over their traditional
lands. They also demonstrate clear continuity with pre-colonial
practices and social organization, due in part to the relatively recent
experiences of colonization by many Arctic Indigenous peoples,
especially in North America. On the other hand, most of the Arctic
states are stronger democratic systems with rule of law, economic and
social benefits, and respect for indigenous rights than many other
countries with indigenous populations. As discussed below, Arctic
Indigenous peoples enjoy among the highest qualities of life and
greatest degrees of 113 Gunhild Hoogensen and Kirsti Stuvøy, "Gender,
Resistance, and Human Security," Security Dialogue 37, no. (2006): 219.
42 political autonomy and inclusion of any indigenous peoples in the
world. With the notable exception of Russia, Arctic Indigenous peoples
have politically organized themselves into formations that sometimes
challenge the preferences of their colonial state governments without
fear of overt political repression, violence, or retaliation. They thus
enjoy a higher degree of political freedom than most, while also
experiencing material conditions and political nondominance that curtail
their political agency, reflecting their status within their
settler-colonial political contexts. While debates over indigeneity and
identity remain relevant in the circumpolar region, by virtue of their
distinct structures of political representation Arctic Indigenous
peoples are somewhat more clearly identifiable than elsewhere. By
definition, they comprise the Indigenous peoples living in the Arctic
regions of the eight circumpolar states. Informed by the Cobo
definition, the Arctic Human Development Report defines Indigenous
peoples as: Those peoples who were marginalized when the modern states
were created and identify themselves as indigenous peoples. They are
associated with specific territories to which they trace their
histories. They exhibit one or more of the following characteristics:
they speak a language that is different from that of the dominant
group(s); they are being discriminated against in the political system;
they are being discriminated against within the legal system; their
cultures diverge from that of the remaining society; they often diverge
from the mainstream society in their resource use by being hunters and
gatherers, nomads, pastoralists, or swidden farmers; they consider
themselves and are considered by others as different from the rest of
the population.114 Indigenous peoples number approximately 500,000 out
of the total 4 million inhabitants of the circumpolar region, and, as
shown in Figure 2, form a ring of overlapping trans-state populations
surrounding the Arctic Ocean. A majority of these live in Russia, which
also has the greatest diversity of Indigenous peoples with over 41
different groups, including the more populous Chukchi, Evenki, Khaka,
Khanty, Nenet, Tuvan, and Yakut peoples. Aleuts are indigenous people in
the easternmost Russian region of Kamchatka who also inhabit the islands
off western Alaska. Mainland Alaska is home to Athabaskan, Gwich'in, and
Inuit (Alaskan Eskimo) peoples whose territories cross into northern
Canada. Inuit form a majority of the Indigenous population 114 Csonka

Arctic, as well as a large majority of nearly 90 percent in neighbouring
Greenland. Sámi are the only recognized Indigenous people in all of
Europe, comprising the entire indigenous populations of Norway, Sweden,
and Finland, with a small number also on the Kola Peninsula in western
Russia.115 While now rooted in the social and political structures of
particular states, the sociological boundaries of Arctic Indigenous
peoples are not consistent with the colonial boundaries that have been
imposed upon them. Indigenous peoples serve as living reminders of
pre-modern patterns of habitation in the circumpolar region, and reflect
relationships and associations that transcend sovereign borders. The
formal political involvement of Indigenous peoples in the circumpolar
region is one of the key features of the post-Cold War Arctic order. In
addition to significant degrees of selfgovernment, political autonomy,
or elected representation exercised by Indigenous peoples throughout
much of the region -- particularly Self Rule for the Inuit majority in
Greenland; selfgovernment or high representation in public governments
for Canadian Inuit through the establishment of four land claim areas;
and the separate Sámi Parliaments of Norway, Sweden, and Finland --
Indigenous peoples have also been central to the establishment and
activities of the Arctic Council. Founded in 1996 to provide a dedicated
regional forum for dialogue and cooperation, the Council owes much of
the impetus for its creation to the organization and activism of
Indigenous advocacy groups. Since the 1960s, Indigenous peoples across
the Arctic increasingly established representative organizations to both
lobby governments and speak on behalf of their people, who at the time
very much remained colonial subjects of their southernbased governments.
John English, historian of the Arctic Council, credits the efforts of
these organizations and the leaders they produced with the eventual
success of the Arctic Council negotiations: "Voices that were silenced
in the fifties became audible in the sixties, eloquent in the seventies,
and powerful and influential later. The colonized now came to the
colonial capitals no longer as subjects but as actors shaping their
times and the lives of their people."116 The emergence of Indigenous
voices as a potent political force would substantially alter the shape
of the circumpolar region. 115 Antoine Dubreuil, "The Arctic of the
Regions: Between Indigenous Peoples and Sub-National Entities -- Which
Perspective?" International Journal 66, no. 4 (2011): 923-938. 116 John
English, Ice and Water: Politics, Peoples, and the Arctic Council
(Toronto: Penguin, 2013), 95. 45 Arising from social movements for
Indigenous rights and representation, six groups were formally
incorporated into regional governance through their inclusion as
Permanent Participants on the Arctic Council: the Arctic Athabaskan
Council, Aleut International Association, Gwich'in Council
International, Inuit Circumpolar Council, Russian Association of
Indigenous Peoples of the North, and the Saami Council. As the first
international intergovernmental body in the world to grant indigenous
peoples formal status with rights to membership and participation
approximating that of the Member States, the Council provides Indigenous
peoples with representation at the premier forum for regional
cooperation. English argues that "it is a mark of the historic change
that the growing prominence of the Arctic Council with its indigenous
participants means that many rules will now be set not only in imperial
southern capitals but often by northern peoples."117 English's detailed
analysis of the Council's origins concurs with the conclusions of other
leading scholars like Oran Young that it is partly through the efforts
of Indigenous peoples that the Arctic has developed from a "region of
peripheries" into a coherent region of its own,118 and with Timo
Koivurova and Leena Heinämäki that Arctic Indigenous peoples have become
so key to regional politics as to enjoy a status close to that of
vetoholders.119 Although they continue to reflect the significant
differences of opportunity afforded by their respective historical
experiences and contemporary circumstances, Arctic Indigenous peoples
have been at the forefront of advancing the political interests of
indigenous peoples and their inclusion in organizations and fora
previously reserved for states. In this respect, Arctic Indigenous
peoples reflect the global achievements of indigenous peoples in
fostering an awareness of indigeneity as a basis for rights and
political inclusion, and establishing a social movement to support the
political project of "global indigenism."120 The adoption of the United
Nations Declaration of the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in 2007, the
creation of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, and moves
towards recognition and reparations for colonially inflicted wrongs all
signify the contemporary emergence of indigenous 117 English 2013, 298.

Canadian State," Canadian Foreign Policy Journal 13, no. 3 (2007):
121-131; Niezen 2003. 46 peoples as political actors. The terms of this
inclusion remain constrained, however, by the interests and actions of
settler-colonial states and the international institutions over which
they exhibit significant influence. Although "the most egregious
expressions of colonialism have been discredited ... what remained
untouched are those 'colonial agendas' that have had a controlling
(systemic) effect in privileging national (white) interests at the
expense of indigenous rights."121 Despite the significant progress that
has been made by settler-colonial governments and legal authorities in
terms of acknowledging and respecting indigenous rights and title, the
relationships between indigenous peoples and their governments remain
structured by the dominance of settler-colonial values, institutions,
and interests. Though more empowered than ever before, and more so than
most indigenous peoples elsewhere in the world, even in the Arctic,
Indigenous peoples lack the power to control their own collective
futures. 2.3 Research, Non-Dominance and Indigenous Peoples The
non-dominance of Arctic Indigenous peoples is reflected in two distinct
forms: material and non-material (ideational). The material reflections
of political non-dominance vary by country and are discussed in
subsequent chapters, but generally include lower qualities of life,
forms of governmental control, and restrictions upon indigenous rights
and autonomy resulting from "the demoralising effects of dispossession,
forced removals, open racism and discrimination, and destruction of
language, identity, and culture."122 Less overt but more pernicious,
however, is the ideational non-dominance that has resulted in the
discrediting of indigenous forms of knowledge and knowledge production,
the privileging of settler-colonial legal and political systems, and the
ongoing marginalization of indigenous ways of knowing and being relative
to those of settlers. Ideational non-dominance is a form of power that
operates "in underlying social structures and systems of knowledge that
advantage some and disadvantage others."123 [Indigenous **[traditional
knowledge]{.mark}** and traditional ecological knowledge have long been
[viewed]{.mark} as **[threatening]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} the **[colonial
order]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and have been subjected to concerted
efforts at destruction, 121 Maaka and Fleras 2005, 12. 122 Maaka and
Fleras 2005, 26. 123 Barnett and Duvall 2005, 42. 47 erasure, and
forgetting. As Linda Tuhiwai Smith asserts, "the [**[negation]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} [indigenous]{.mark} views of history was a [critical]{.mark}
part of **asserting** **colonial [ideology]{.mark}**]{.underline},
partly [because such views]{.underline} were regarded as clearly
'primitive' and 'incorrect' and mostly because they [challenged and
**resisted the vision** of colonization]{.underline}."124 [Colonial
[authorities]{.mark} sought to [render]{.mark} [indigenous populations
legible to]{.mark} **new forms** of **[state
power]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which necessitated [[structuring the
social terrain]{.mark}]{.underline} on which indigenous/non-indigenous
relations would occur [[in a manner **advantageous** to the
colonizer]{.underline}]{.mark}. This included depriving prior indigenous
knowledge and forms of organization of the legitimacy to challenge
settler-colonial organization and Western forms of knowledge by
subjecting them to alien standards of colonial law and morality,
preventing their transmission to younger generations, and eventually
co-opting them into certain settler-colonial decision-making processes
and academic research.125 [The result has been the **widespread
[discrediting]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the scientific validity,
**[legal]{.mark} [weight]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark} [moral]{.mark}
[worth]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [indigenous]{.mark} [knowledge]{.mark}
precisely [on]{.mark} the [basis]{.mark} [of]{.mark} its **difference**
from **[settler-colonial]{.mark}**/scientific **[rationalist]{.mark}
modes** of **[thought]{.mark}** and **action**.]{.underline}126 The
ideational dimension of indigenous non-dominance is important to specify
because it sets the context for the material dimension that is more
readily visible in indigenous/non-indigenous relations. The two are
intimately linked, as it is the severing of indigenous peoples' ties to
their cultural and epistemological heritage that facilitates the
material dispossession of their lands, rights, and resources, and
establishes the context for settler domination in their new societies.
Erasure occurs in two ways: through the exclusion and enforced
forgetting of traditional indigenous knowledge, and through the
displacement and disruption of societies guided by and responsible for
generating that knowledge. Vandana Shiva observes: "Over and above
rendering local knowledge invisible by declaring it non-existent or
illegitimate, the dominant system also makes alternatives disappear by
erasing or destroying the reality which they attempt to represent."127
The current Arctic context exemplifies this dynamic, wherein traditional
knowledge has been denied scientific authority and excluded from
official decision making at the 124 Linda Tuhiwai Smith, Decolonizing

settler-colonial political, economic, and social policies have wrought
changes on Arctic societies and ecosystems that undermine the
applicability of traditional knowledge in the first place. Relevant
examples range from human impacts on the Arctic ecosystem such that
traditional ecological knowledge no longer reflects the characteristics
of the circumpolar climate, to settler-colonial policies that have
discriminated against indigenous women with impacts on traditional
structures of community authority.128 The [**[rejection]{.mark}** and

territories, and related decisions over how indigenous peoples can and
should live in the modern world. 2.3.1 Decolonization and Indigenist
Research A central component of this dissertation involves the
understandings of Indigenous peoples towards the meaning of in/security
in the Arctic region. Given the importance of epistemology and knowledge
production to power relations between indigenous and non-indigenous
peoples, pursuing appropriate and respectful research involving
indigenous peoples is complicated by a history of Western academic
research fraught with deceit, injustice, abuse, appropriation, and
perpetuation of the very structures that render indigenous peoples
non-dominant within their national communities. One of the key functions
that academic research has performed in this process is the explicit or
implicit privileging of settler-colonial and state perspectives,
resulting in the erasure and denial of indigenous histories,
epistemologies, and contemporary interests.129 Far from just the
objective interpretation of facts through theory, Tuhiwai Smith notes
the "problem is that academic writing is a form of selecting, arranging
and presenting knowledge. It 128 The differences between Western
scientific and indigenous observations of Arctic climate change are
shown in the film Qapirangajuq: Inuit Knowledge and Climate Change,
which highlights some of the disagreements and differing interpretations
between indigenous and scientific understandings of the changing
environment. The film is available at
http://www.isuma.tv/inuit-knowledge-and-climate-change. For a discussion

of an idea, what issues count as significant; and, by engaging in the
same process uncritically, we too can render indigenous writers
invisible or unimportant while reinforcing the validity of other
writers."130 If research into issues pertaining to indigenous peoples is
undertaken without consideration of their views, including but not
limited to the inclusion of indigenous voices and perspectives, then
that research contributes to the "cognitive imperialism" that
underpinned colonization.131 Perhaps especially for disciplines such as
political science, international relations, and security studies that
have primarily focused on state behaviour, the international system of
sovereign states, and the mechanisms of interstate violence and
cooperation that constitute global order, there has been little account
of indigenous peoples: "On the international scene it is extremely rare
and unusual when indigenous accounts are accepted and acknowledged as
valid interpretations of what has taken place."132 Therefore,
contemporary research must be conscious of its role in supporting or
silencing the voices of indigenous peoples and other non-dominant
groups, and the ethical implications of writing them out of academic
accounts of modern politics. To this end, Tuhiwai Smith promotes an
'indigenist' research agenda to help decolonize the methodological and
epistemological approaches of academic research. For indigenous
scholars, decolonizing research may be integral to their individual and
collective senses of Self as indigenous people,133 but for
non-indigenous scholars, like myself, the drive for an indigenist
research agenda "evolves from a need to comprehend, resist, and
transform the crises related to the dual concerns of the effect that
colonization has had on Indigenous peoples and the ongoing erosion of
Indigenous languages, knowledge, and culture as a result of
colonization."134 In this way, indigenist research "borrows freely from
feminist research and critical approaches to research, but privileges
indigenous voices."135 For me, the desire to help decolonize research
through this dissertation stems from: recognition that the Euro-centric
theoretical traditions of 130 Tuhiwai Smith 1999, 36. 131 Battiste 2000,
xvii. 132 Tuhiwai Smith 1999, 35. 133 Tuhiwai Smith 1999, 38. 134
Battiste 2000, xx-xxi. 135 Tuhiwai Smith 1999, 147. 50 academia offer an
incomplete understanding of the social and natural worlds;
acknowledgment of the historic and contemporary harms inflicted on
indigenous peoples by the convergence of state practices and mainstream
scholarship; and understanding that circumpolar research is empirically
incomplete without incorporating the views of Arctic Indigenous peoples.
**[[Decolonization]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- [in]{.underline} this [case
of how in/security is understood in the **circumpolar
Arctic**]{.underline} -- is thus an analytical and normative goal of
this project. It is important to note, however, that decolonization does
not and cannot mean returning to a precolonial reality; the cognitive,
material, and affective legacies of colonialism may be repaired, but
they can never be undone. As such, decolonization "does not mean and has
not meant a total rejection of all theory or research or Western
knowledge. Rather, [it is [about]{.mark} **[centring
\[indigenous]{.mark}**\] concerns and **[worldviews]{.mark}** and then
coming to know and understand **[theory and research]{.mark}** from
\[indigenous\] perspectives and [for]{.mark} **\[[indigenous\]
purposes]{.mark}**]{.underline}."136 Indigenist research seeks to bring
indigenous peoples' views back into the realm of knowledge production
from which they have typically been excluded. Such an understanding of
the possibility and limits of decolonization will not satisfy those who
call for decolonization to be applied literally to settlercolonial
political, social, and economic systems and institutions currently
extant on Indigenous lands, and who decry the use of "decolonization as
metaphor ... because it turns decolonization into an empty signifier to
be filled by any track towards liberation." These critics argue that
"decolonization in the settler colonial context must involve the
repatriation of land simultaneous to recognition of how land and
recognition of land have always been differently understood and enacted;
that is, all the land, and not just symbolically."137 On such terms,
decolonizing the foreign and security policies of settler-colonial
states is an oxymoron; real decolonization would involve fully
disassembling settler societies' power over indigenous peoples through
the restoration of all settler-occupied territories to the descendants
of their original inhabitants. This literal view of decolonization is
rejected in this dissertation as neither a useful starting point nor
even a desirable objective for political or academic praxis. Such a
maximalist and literal conception of decolonization elides profound
normative questions 136 Tuhiwai Smith 1999, 39. 137 Eve Tuck and K.

original. 51 regarding the future of native-born settler descendants and
more recent immigrants inhabiting indigenous lands, and offers no
reasonable starting point for political negotiation, cooperation, and
reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous peoples. Instead,
this dissertation employs an understanding of decolonization that
aspires towards a post-colonial politics capable of guiding social
scientific inquiry and informing meaningful political change, rather
than contemplating an impossible restoration of pre-colonial reality. It
seeks to bring the voices and views of Indigenous peoples in the Arctic
to the same page as the perspectives of Arctic states, incorporating the
original inhabitants of the circumpolar region into a discourse of
Arctic security from which they have been excluded. In outlining
possible parameters for an indigenist research agenda, Tuhiwai Smith
identifies 25 different projects that comprise a comprehensive research
program for indigenous peoples. The projects have both empirical and
methodological goals, namely to incorporate indigenous knowledge and
indigenous knowledge production into academic research: The projects are
not claimed to be entirely indigenous or to have been created by
indigenous researchers. Some approaches have arisen out of social
science methodologies, which in turn have arisen out of methodological
issues raised by research with various oppressed groups. Some projects
invite multidisciplinary research approaches. Others have arisen
directly out of indigenous practices ... Most fall well within what will
be recognized as empirical research, \[but\] not all do.138 As a
non-indigenous person, and moreover as a privileged, male member of
settler-colonial society in Canada, one of the Arctic states under
examination in this dissertation, some of these research projects are
unavailable to me. It is neither possible nor would it be appropriate
for me to engage in claiming, naming, or giving testimony to indigenous
experiences. Other projects such as revitalizing, restoring, and
returning indigenous practices, language, culture, or territory are
beyond the scope of this dissertation. However, elements of three
indigenist projects are contained within this research, and can be
meaningfully and appropriately contributed to by me as a non-indigenous
scholar examining indigenous political issues: Indigenizing consists of
two dimensions: "The first one is similar to that which has occurred in
literature with a centring of the landscapes, images, languages, themes,
metaphors, and stories in the indigenous world ... \[The second\]
centres a politics of 138 Tuhiwai Smith 1999, 142-143. 52 indigenous
identity and indigenous cultural action ... grounded in the alternative
conceptions of world view and value systems."139 Representing: "The
representing project spans both the notion of representation as a
political concept and representation as a form of voice and expression.
In the political sense colonialism specifically excluded indigenous
peoples from any form of decision making. State and governments have
long made decisions hostile to the interests of indigenous communities
... [Being able as a **minimum right** to **[voice]{.mark}** the views
and opinions of [indigenous]{.mark} communities [in]{.mark} **various**
**[decision-making bodies]{.mark}** is still being struggled
over]{.underline}."140 Reframing: "[**Reframing** is about
[taking]{.mark} much **[greater control]{.mark}** [over]{.mark} the
[ways in which **indigenous issues**]{.mark} [and]{.mark} **[social
problems]{.mark}** [are]{.mark} **[discussed]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**[handled]{.mark}**]{.underline} ... The framing of an issue is about
making decisions about its parameters, about what is in the foreground,
what is in the background, and what shadings or complexities exist
within the frame. [The project of reframing is related to **[defining
the problem]{.mark}** or issue [and]{.mark} [determining]{.mark}
[how]{.mark} best **[to solve]{.mark}** that problem]{.underline}."141
To be sure, this dissertation presents detailed examinations of the
Arctic policies of two circumpolar states. As such, it could be said to
(re)produce the conceptions of Arctic in/security employed by settler
societies that have marginalized, instrumentalized, and oppressed
Indigenous peoples in the region. However, the dissertation also
provides the first detailed case-based and comparative analysis of the
views of Arctic Indigenous peoples towards the meaning of in/security in
their homelands. In doing so, it builds upon and contributes to recent
literature, especially in Canada, that centres indigenous peoples in the
foreign and security policies and practices of the states in which they
reside.142 This project thus reframes the way in which 139 Tuhiwai Smith

105-119. 53 issues vital to Indigenous peoples -- such as environmental
change, linguistic and cultural preservation, natural resources, and
self-government -- are typically understood by policymakers and academic
audiences in the metropolitan south of Arctic states. In doing so, it
represents those issues that Indigenous peoples have articulated as most
pressing to their continued survival and wellbeing as security issues,
extending the theoretical logic of socially constructing in/security
beyond states and privileged national actors to include Indigenous
peoples. And in examining the ways in which Indigenous views of Arctic
security have not been successfully incorporated into the foreign and
security policies of circumpolar states, it indigenizes that discourse
and challenges it to account for the exclusion of Indigenous views. As
an academic study rooted in interpretivist, Western social scientific
methodology that also considers the views and practices of settler
states, this is at best a hybrid indigenist research project. However,
it aspires to contribute towards the decolonization of how Arctic
security is understood through the deliberate and focused incorporation
of those indigenous voices that have been silenced or subsumed. Perhaps
once the discourse has been decolonized, the policies and practices of
Arctic states will follow.

Subaltern security dilemmas: a decolonial approach to Arctic geopolitics
and security [One main [purpose]{.mark} of critical research [is
to]{.mark} [undo]{.mark} **[hegemonic discourse]{.mark}s**, [and]{.mark}
to **[democratise]{.mark}** public **[debate]{.mark}** [through]{.mark}
its **[diversification]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} [promoting
**grassroot**]{.mark} **views** and **[participation]{.mark}**.
[Within]{.mark} international studies and critical [IR]{.mark}, this has
meant, for instance, [deconstructing]{.mark} nationalist and
**[state-centred discourses]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} [security]{.mark} [and
geopolitics and creating **space for subaltern**]{.mark}
**[voice]{.mark}s** and perspectives.]{.underline} Building on the
examples of the green transition and militarisation, this article has
argued for a [need to pursue such a critical and decolonial research
agenda [in]{.mark} the present [context]{.mark} [of]{.mark} **[Arctic
geopolitics]{.mark}** and security.]{.underline} Developing sensibility
to the multiple subaltern security dilemmas(SSDs) that emerge in the
intersections of hegemonic and subaltern perspectives to security should
be central to such effort. The problem of [subalternity was strongly
present in early [debates]{.mark} [regarding]{.mark} the]{.underline}
promotion of 'green' energy projects in Sápmi. Despite the long
tradition of Sámi resistance to natural [**[resource
extraction]{.mark}**,]{.underline} extractive projects that are
[[advanced]{.mark} [in the name of **climate action**]{.mark}
[place]{.mark} such [resistance]{.mark} face to face [with]{.mark}
[discourses]{.mark} [that]{.mark},]{.underline} in the words of Saami
Council's Per Olof Nutti[, [are]{.mark} "[unreasonable]{.mark}"
[yet]{.mark} "[**difficult to stand against** or
criticise]{.mark}".]{.underline} The notion of green colonialism has
efficiently addressed the dilemma, creating space for the articulation
of Sámi rights and experience, but pressure from 'green' projects on
Sámi lands continues to grow. However, [in line with the growing
**[geopolitical]{.mark} [tensions]{.mark}** and **militarisation of
public discourse**, today such projects are [justified]{.mark}
increasingly not just in reference to climate action but also [in terms
of **defence and security**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Recent decisions of
the European Commission to promote and fast-track three new mining
projects in the Swedish part of Sápmi as "strategic projects" under the
Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA) is a case in point. According to the
EC, these strategic projects -- whose approval the Saami Council
describes as ["[devastating **betrayal** of **Indigenous
rights**]{.mark} and Sápmi's future" -- are crucial [for]{.mark} both
the "[success]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the [green]{.mark} and digital
[transitions]{.mark}" [and]{.mark} for the "**[resilience]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} the [defence]{.mark} [and]{.mark} aerospace
sectors"]{.underline} (Saami Council, 2025; European Commission,
2025).However, the concept of [**subaltern security dilemmas** is
particularly useful in the context of
**[militarization]{.mark}**,]{.underline} which is quickly becoming a
[new **major paradigm**]{.underline} of land use and a discourse of
regional development in Sápmi. As with the 'green transition'[,
[military land use]{.mark} can [pose]{.mark} a **[significant
threat]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} the practice of [Sámi]{.mark}
[livelihoods]{.mark},]{.underline} but articulating Sámi rights to the
land, or demanding effective measures to limit the harm done by military
land use, is proving to be particularly difficult. On the one hand, such
[[concerns]{.mark} [may be interpreted as]{.mark}
**[unpatriotic]{.mark}** [or indifferent]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the
exigencies of **[national security]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark}
[therefore]{.mark} result in a [negative]{.mark} stigma and **hate
speech**.]{.underline} On the other hand,
[[upholding]{.underline}]{.mark} such rights can appear difficult also
due to the ways in which the discourses and practices of national and
military security appear to force individual subjects and groups to
choose a side between their security as citizens of the nation state and
their own rights and security as Indigenous and Sámi. [Conversely,
[instead]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [positioning]{.mark} local and
[Indigenous]{.mark} people's [interests]{.mark} and concerns [in]{.mark}
[a]{.mark} [direct]{.mark},]{.underline} clear-cut juxtaposition
vis-à-vis the [**[geopolitical]{.mark}** and security [interest]{.mark}s
[of the]{.mark} [state]{.mark}, the notion of **[subaltern]{.mark}**
security [dilemma]{.mark} that I have suggested here
[appreciates]{.mark} the **[ambiguity]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
[subaltern]{.mark} position [while also clearing space for]{.mark} the
[articulation]{.mark} [of]{.mark} subaltern or [**counter-hegemonic**
resistance and dissent]{.mark}. The position of subalternity [does not
expect that]{.mark} [Indigenous peoples would]{.mark} [not]{.mark}
[share]{.mark} or recognise any of the **[national]{.mark}** or
h**egemonic security [concerns]{.mark}** [of the state]{.mark},
[as]{.mark} [they]{.mark} also [may]{.mark} well [feel]{.mark} that [the
need]{.mark} [to]{.mark} secure the state from foreign invasion or

in]{.mark} considerable [insecurity]{.mark}]{.underline} in spheres of
life that are [**indispensable**]{.underline} for their own future as

such ambiguities and [uncertainties]{.mark} [while building ground for

**[green]{.mark} [transition]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**[militarisation]{.mark}** [need to be understood]{.mark} [as **new
regimes**]{.mark} or paradigms of land use [which pose]{.mark} a

[Sámi livelihoods]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} thereby, to Sámi [rights]{.mark}
and future at large.]{.underline} In the context of the green
transition, the Sámi have already addressed, through conceptual
innovation that centres on green colonialism, [the challenge of how to
articulate **[resistance]{.mark}** against land-grabs justified in the

### Alt---Unthinking---1NC

#### Vote negative to [unthink]{.underline} the 1AC. [Cleansing]{.underline} debate's archive of colonial Arctic knowledge is key to [unlearn]{.underline} the embedded epistemic habits of the settler state.

**Reeploeg, 23**---Associate Professor, Department of Cultural & Social
History, University of Greenland (Silke, "Unthinking historical
thinking: lessons from the Arctic," History Education Research Journal,
20 (1), 2023, dml)

Based on recent research on the [coloniality]{.underline} of historical
knowledge [in the **Arctic**]{.underline}, this article examines the
challenges and opportunities that history education offers in terms of
epistemic and cognitive justice within the context of Arctic memory
cultures (R. Petersen, 1978; Reeploeg, 2021; Segato, 2022). The article
begins by engaging with Indigenous and postcolonial scholarship on how
historical thinking, as a methodology, [can currently be defined as an
**unsustainable** and **unjust** epistemic habit]{.underline} (Cutrara,
2018; Kuokkanen, 2008). Using [Arctic]{.underline} memory cultures as a
research field, the article examines historical [thinking]{.underline}
and historical consciousness not as separate, if overlapping, epistemic
traditions concerned with managing learning about the past. This [risks
becoming another site of **sanctioned ignorance**]{.underline}, [which
**reproduces** and **forecloses** colonialist structures through the
**purposeful silencing** of particular contexts as being **irrelevant**
or **too difficult**]{.underline} (Guha and Spivak, 1988). Instead, both
are integrated into the wider field of memory cultures that produce (not
discover or evaluate) knowledge about the past through a system of
epistemic habits. In doing so, I suggest that [**unthinking** these
epistemic habits]{.underline} as part of a more nuanced critical
pedagogical praxis [is a **necessity**]{.underline}, if historical
thinking is to continue to be part of one of the basic competencies of
historians and educators.

History education does not only take place in educational institutions,
but also in museums, archives and libraries, and in [public discourses
and other sites of collective memory]{.underline} (Ricoeur, 2010). These
[**create** and **transmit** a variety of histories and memory
cultures]{.underline}, [becoming **sites of learning** about the
past]{.underline} (Carretero et al., 2012). Seen from [this]{.underline}
perspective, historical thinking [is part of a whole set of **epistemic
habits** closely tied to the]{.underline} '**[cognitive
empires]{.underline}**' [of dominant western epistemologies]{.underline}
(Ndlovu-Gatsheni, 2021: 882): '[The rise of western empires resulted in
a wider dissemination of western knowledge]{.underline}, [but also in
the **destruction** of much non-western knowledge]{.underline}, from the
burning of manuscripts by missionaries to the extinction of local
languages' (Burke, 2010: n.p.).

Seeing that Indigenous scholarship has always combined critical
pedagogical praxis with ways of thinking about the past (Berthelsen,
2020; Graugaard, 2016; Jensen Hansen, 2022; Møller and McLisky, 2021),
this article foregrounds Inuit and Inuit-oriented perspectives on the
coloniality of knowledge in the circumpolar world. (See Global Social
Theory \[n.d.\] for a definition of the concept of the coloniality of
knowledge.) [Within the Arctic context]{.underline}, previous research
has shown that '[an understanding of the coloniality of knowledge and
its connections to epistemic violence is **crucial** to the study
of]{.underline} memory and [historical legacy]{.underline}' (Reeploeg,
2021: 1061). This article concludes that [much can be learned
**from**]{.underline} ([not **about**]{.underline}) [Indigenous
scholarship and praxis in and about the Arctic]{.underline}, [which has
long combined thinking historically with opportunities to seek epistemic
justice and the restitution of cultural memory]{.underline}.

Background, research approach and structure: controlling the cognitive
wildfire of coloniality

A new Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) framework (UNESCO,
2021: n.p.) aims to 'increase the contribution of education to building
a more just and sustainable world'. The 'Education for Sustainable
Development: Towards achieving the SDGs (ESD for 2030)' framework calls
for education to encourage changes in knowledge, skills, values and
attitudes to enable [a **more sustainable** and **just** society for
all]{.underline}. A previous report by the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) on history and history
education already emphasised the importance of history for
future-oriented policy in education:

\[History\] can be a generative process for imagining futures which are
reparative rather than reproductive of injustices past and present.
These approaches to history involve processes of dialogue and exchange;
they are constituted through educational relationships and thus they
point to the ways in which education is a necessary precondition of
reparative address. (Sriprakash et al., 2020: 6)

The authors here clearly call for education as a mode of transformation,
as well as an interrogation of the logic of diversity, integration and
reciprocity. This [may require **much more** than]{.underline} an
'inclusive' **[recentring]{.underline}** of [non-western ways of
knowing]{.underline}, and [it must include **rethinking** the **very
structures** on which western epistemes are based]{.underline}
(Kuokkanen, 2008). [It must include **disassembling** structures of harm
by **decentring** of european hegemonies of knowledges]{.underline},
[but also by **interrogating** interlocking systems of epistemic
domination and exploitation]{.underline}. In other words: '[We **all**
need to]{.underline} "**[buy in]{.underline}**" [through our **personal
philosophy**]{.underline}, [informing our professional **practice** and
our professional **orientation**]{.underline}. [We all need to
understand the part we continue to play in the colonising
process]{.underline} and indeed the decolonising process' (McKenna et
al., 2021: 5).

The combined [desires for **unity** and **fully knowing**]{.underline}
'[the **other**]{.underline}' [have long shaped]{.underline} history
**[pedagogies]{.underline}**, [**research programmes** and **government
policies**]{.underline}, [and they appear in the shape of **embedded
epistemic habits** around being and knowing]{.underline} (Jones and
Jenkins, 2008). [These]{.underline} in turn [inform **redemptive
fantasies** and **practices**]{.underline} around equality and diversity
[aimed at overcoming history **without** changing ongoing colonial
relations]{.underline}. Jones and Jenkins (2008), in a book chapter
entitled 'Rethinking collaboration: Working the Indigene-colonizer
hyphen', explain the demand for particular types of ongoing
collaborative enquiry and [redemptive gestures]{.underline} as an
[express]{.underline}ion of [a western enlightenment desire for
**coherence**]{.underline}, [**authorisation** and
**control**]{.underline}. As such, [this forms part of a
modernist]{.underline}, [liberal white control system demanding racial
harmony]{.underline}, [collaboration and understanding]{.underline}
(Jones and Jenkins, 2008). So, for example, the [work]{.underline} of
Canadian settler-scholars Heather and Catherine McGregor [seems to offer
**curricular solutions** to the absence of Indigenous
knowledges]{.underline} in schools (McGregor and McGregor, 2016). While
their suggestion to invite Inuit Elders into the educational settings of
Nunavut seems to address a visible knowledge gap, [it also enacts the
**embedded epistemic habits** and **expertise** of the
settler-state]{.underline} (in this case, the Canadian regional
government administrator) (Douglas, 2013; McGregor and Marker, 2018).
However, [the **selective** and **momentary** engagement with Indigenous
knowledges and scholarship as]{.underline} '**[additional
knowledge]{.underline}**' [that simply needs to be **integrated** into
the long list of methods and]{.underline} '**[things to
do]{.underline}**' [of the busy settler-scholar **reduces** reciprocity
to a **redemptive moment**]{.underline} (with the emphasis on momentary)
[that can be adopted by anybody]{.underline} (in unity). [This
**avoids** interrogating and unsettling]{.underline} the logic of
reciprocity in research and teaching relationships, and working to
challenge (not adapt) and undo (not reform) [colonial systems of
domination and exploitation]{.underline}.

Against this background, Indigenous scholars have long argued for [a
**fundamental restructuring** of relations]{.underline} which adds
respect, truth telling and relationality to education (Kuokkanen, 2019).
For history educators and academic researchers, this [means both
pedagogic **unlearning** and]{.underline} '[**recognition** and
**intellectual activation** of Indigenous knowledge]{.underline}'
(Steeves, 2021: 20): listening to, learning from, citing and working
with Indigenous scholarship, while acknowledging and transforming
different types of structural equality that have and are affecting it.
In the world of history education, [this may include **decentring**
yourself and **limiting** other dominant voices]{.underline}, if you are
in a position to do so. [This seems like a first step towards
**respecting**]{.underline} ([not]{.underline}
'**[including]{.underline}**') [Indigenous epistemes and other forms of
knowledge on their own terms]{.underline}, and emerging from their own
intellectual environments. 'This sense of relationality to each other,
to the past, and to epistemologies is integral to a cosmopolitanism that
reflects and respects the uniqueness of local environments' (Cutrara,
2018: 266).

[Inspired by]{.underline} Paulette Steeves's (2015: 62) notion of
'**[pyro-epistemology]{.underline}**', the research approach for this
article [aims for a pedagogic]{.underline} '**[cleanse]{.underline}**'
[of]{.underline} current discourses and [scholarly content]{.underline}
on historical thinking, [as they often include]{.underline}
'[discussions that **misinform** and **fuel racism**]{.underline}'.
Having considered the role of dominant, eurocentric scholarship in the
displacement and erasure of Indigenous scholarship overall, [I
have]{.underline}, for example, **[deliberately reduced the airflow
available]{.underline}** (via referencing) [to the vast volume of
non-Indigenous literature about Arctic]{.underline} cultures and
[histories]{.underline}. [This form of]{.underline} weeding or
[**controlled incineration** of the **cognitive wildfire** that is
western historical writing seems like a **productive way to respond** to
working within the coloniality of knowledge]{.underline} (Quijano, 2007;
Silova et al., 2017). It also informs much of the work done within
western historical practice itself, by historians continuously
questioning and countering the eurocentric nature of western historical
thinking (Rüsen, 2002). Readers keen to point to the lack of engagement
with canonical texts from history education research or Arctic
historiography should look to Eve Tuck's (2009) 'Suspending damage: A
letter to communities', or to Derek Rasmussen's (2002) 'Quallunology: A
pedagogy for the oppressor' to understand this approach.

Expanding Polar Legal Imagination: Speculation and Prefiguration

[As outlined in the introduction, [law is typically]{.mark} a
[reactive]{.mark} discipline; it responds to crises, disputes, or the
needs of states.]{.underline} This is where speculation comes into play,
but how do we speculate (as a practice) with a focus on the polar
regions? [**[Speculative legal praxis invites us to proactively imagine
alternative futures]{.mark}**. This is [not just]{.mark} about
[responding to immediate threats]{.mark} to the polar
environments]{.underline} (environmental law has not managed to do that
in a century of normative developments); [it is [about
rethinking]{.mark} the [legal frameworks]{.mark} themselves,
[questioning]{.mark} their [assumptions]{.mark}, and [envisioning new
possibilities for polar law]{.mark}.]{.underline} One way of doing
speculation is through [[the concept of prefiguration]{.mark}, as a
means of [imagining the future we want]{.mark}. In that sense,
prefiguration [allows us to move beyond]{.mark} the [confines of
existing legal systems]{.mark} and ask fundamental
questions]{.underline}: what is the future of the polar regions we want?
And how do we transpose this vision of the future into a normative
endeavour? Just as the poles are transforming as a result of the climate
and environmental crises, so too must our legal concepts become more
fluid, adaptive, and interconnected. [[Traditional categories]{.mark}
like sovereignty, legality, and normativity, which have
[historically]{.mark} been [fixed]{.mark} and stable, [are now being
challenged]{.mark} by ecological instability. [This demands]{.mark} that
[we move away from static legal systems towards]{.mark} more [adaptive
legal orders]{.mark}]{.underline}, ones that can respond to
molecular-planetary concerns and ecological limits. [[Speculative
thinking is]{.mark} not simply a means to escape from the
present]{.underline}. It is a [[political praxis to reimagine and
reconstruct legal knowledge]{.mark} that can respond to the complex,
entangled realities of the polar regions.]{.underline} It [allows us [to
think beyond]{.mark} the [binaries of state vs]{.mark}.
[non-state]{.mark} actors, [human vs. non-human]{.mark} interests, and
[utilitarian resource extraction vs]{.mark}. [environmental
protection]{.mark}]{.underline}. Instead, it invites us to [**[consider
a normative system that respects Indigenous knowledge]{.mark}**,
non-human [sovereignties]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} the [interdependence of
all life]{.mark} forms within these fragile ecosystems]{.underline}. For
us, [to think of [polar law on a speculative register means]{.mark} not
just imagining future scenarios and arguments for legal governance but
an [overall rethinking of ]{.mark}our way of [polar governance
itself]{.mark}.]{.underline} Speculation, in this sense, is not just
about creating fictitious futures but an active, creative and critical
process of prefiguration, as a means to envision the kind of polar
governance we want to see in the future as both a normative and a
political resituating exercise. If prefiguration becomes a political and
normative praxis, then speculative academia becomes the venue for
scholars to politicise.

#### Hyperborean Legalities: Reimagining Polar Law through notions of prefiguration [challenges]{.underline} liminal portrayals of the Arctic and the superiority of state sovereignty\-\--it [deconstructs]{.underline} existing legal realities and unfreezes conceptual spaces of normativity to create visions of coexistence for what law should be

Speculative Academia -- A turn to 'Critical Polar Jurisprudence'

Using prefiguration as a point of analytical departure, we asked
ourselves what is the kind of future that we want to have in the polar
regions? [[Polar Law]{.mark}, as a subset of international law,
[is]{.mark} an artefact [deeply embedded within the sociocultural
paradigm of modernity and is inevitably infected with]{.mark} the
[methodologies and ideologies of this]{.mark} paradigm.]{.underline} The
field of Polar Law as an academic discipline is riddled with doctrinal
and formalist approaches to the Arctic and Antarctic legal issues. As
international law researchers, we are often trained to look for gaps in
our polar legal realities to heal (de lege ferenda), with almost
messianic ambitions, the ills of our global collective social and
environmental factual realities. Polar law is no exception, and
black-letter methodologies abound. [[Even scholars whose research
involves]{.mark} environmental law, [decolonisation]{.mark} or people
liberation movements, whose themes are perhaps more synonymous with a
broad understanding of 'justice', [often frame]{.mark} their [arguments
through]{.mark} a [doctrinal lens to gain
legitimacy]{.mark}.]{.underline} [As we [aim to reimagine polar law in
ways]{.mark} that are [not limited to state modes of existence]{.mark}
but [include humans and more-than-human entities]{.mark} alike in this
process, since August 2022 we have opened the register of speculation to
what we term a 'critical turn' to polar law.]{.underline} In doing so,
we contented that it was perhaps time to think of '[[Critical Polar
Jurisprudence]{.underline}]{.mark}.' In this context, we have been
convening two streams annually at both the Polar Law Symposium14) and
the Critical Legal Conference (CLC). The Polar Law Symposium gathers
researchers from around the globe on an annual basis, [[providing a
platform for]{.mark} the [exchange of research-based scientific
knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}on a variety of issues pertinent
to polar regions. Conversely, the CLC, which has been a pivotal
gathering since its inception in 1986, [[serves as]{.mark} a
[critical]{.mark} venue [for examining legal and political
issues]{.mark}, through a vast array of theoretical
approaches]{.underline}. That said, the [[Critical Polar
Law]{.underline}]{.mark} initiative has [[emerged to bring these]{.mark}
two [together]{.mark}, [reevaluate]{.mark} the [assumptions commonly
held about]{.mark} the [polar regions and]{.mark} to [address emerging
issues]{.mark} in polar law [through the lens of critical
jurisprudence]{.mark}. It [aims to deconstruct existing legal
realities]{.mark}, [such as]{.mark} the premise of [conceptual
superiority of state sovereignty]{.mark} and its role as the moulder of
law and life in the polar regions. Our way to speculate and prefigure
the future of polar law was to engage on several topics from a more
theoretical perspective with justice at the centre]{.underline}. While
theories of justice have have recently been advanced for Arctic
governance,15) thus far our theoretical endeavours have focused on
broadening this conversation not to focus neither governance nor on the
poles specifically. In an age where planetary politics are being
reassembled, we thought it was worth addressing what lies beyond. We
therefore chose ["theorising" as a means of prefiguration and practice
to assess why]{.underline} [the polar regions can be a site of
theoretical inquiries]{.underline}. Along the way, we articulated
thoughts around alternative theoretical reassessments of polar law.
First, we advance [the term [**Hyperborean Legalities** ]{.mark}to
"[**summon dreamy visions of an alternative legal imaginary**]{.mark}
for the world's northernmost region" and [**to analyse the** **Arctic as
a liminal space**]{.mark}, one **[that exists beyond legal dogmatic
approaches]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Conceptually, Hyperborean
Legalities [[allowed us to challenge]{.mark} the [superiority of state
sovereignty and]{.mark} its role as the moulder of law and life in the
region.]{.underline} The [idea is to challenge both [the way the poles
are]{.mark} often [imagined as empty, frozen, dark lands]{.mark}, and
think alongside the different shapes, forms, and sources of
normativity]{.underline}/ies in the regions.16) Second, and building on
the Hyperborea, we analysed how [the [poles are portrayed as]{.mark}
"[common refuge]{.mark}", [and "areas beyond sovereignty]{.mark}," [yet
also as spaces where state sovereignty]{.mark}/[ies are]{.mark} often
[ontologically reinforced as a tool of exclusion]{.mark}]{.underline}.
In this context, [[in mainstream legal imagination]{.mark}, [they
become]{.mark} "[quasi-frozen sanctuaries]{.mark}]{.underline}" [[where
law freezes yet governance thrives]{.underline}]{.mark}. In these
perceived liminal regions with complex legal, environmental, and social
dynamics, challenging dominant governance structures and traditional
norms. These regions, with their shifting cryospheric
landscapes,17) serve as sanctuaries that bring to light the urgent need
to address climate change and reconsider the relationship between humans
and marine spaces. However, **[[another narrative can be
storied]{.mark}; one [where the fluidity, materiality]{.mark}, [and
disappearance of ice]{.mark}18) [can be]{.mark} thought of as [a]{.mark}
"[sanctuary]{.mark}" [that invites]{.mark} a [rethinking of
environmental protection]{.mark}, [legal frameworks]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} the [struggle against territorial
enclosures]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}in a destabilised planetary
context. [To]{.underline} [come back to prefiguration, [water in a
frozen state can become a source of law]{.mark}. Its disappearance and
the longing for the cold help speculate a normative future that cares
for the human and non-human modes of existence it
supports.1]{.underline}9) This [**[care is not merely]{.mark}** a
**[passive]{.mark}** concern **[but an active relational
engagement]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[recognizing]{.mark} the
[interconnectedness of human and non]{.mark}-[human
entitie]{.mark}s]{.underline}.20) [[Thinking about ice as a source of
law]{.mark} thus [allows us to leave behind landlocked state-bound legal
thinking]{.mark}, [transcend]{.mark} the [constructed ontology
of]{.mark} a [land-sea dichotomy]{.mark}, and think fluidly about
oceanic spaces in all their passing and temporal physical
states.]{.underline} Lastly, it is important to acknowledge that any
political and theoretical engagements with the governance of polar
regions cannot be detached from multiple unfolding planetary crises. The
pitfall of structuring the production of epistemic and normative
knowledge around delimited geographies is that it can lead to tunnel
vision where one becomes unable to see beyond regional impacts. Much
like states, [[polar geographies]{.mark} have been [carefully
constructed along sovereign lines]{.mark}]{.underline}.21) [[To
resist]{.mark} the ever-creeping might of [sovereign powers]{.mark}, [it
is]{.mark} therefore [important to prefigure polar governance as
planetary politics and part of the Earth system.]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}As such, polar governance needs to come to terms that nothing
is polar yet everything is. In Cirkovic's words, this [[calls
for]{.mark} a "**[new ontological understanding of the global
politico-juridical space]{.mark}**" [that]{.mark} "[approximate]{.mark}
the [inclusion and representation of]{.mark} '[everything considered to
be non-human]{.mark}"]{.underline}.22) [In [speculating polar legal
imagination]{.mark}, we therefore [argue that]{.mark} the
[Arctic]{.mark} and Antarctic [regions are not merely]{.mark} as
[amalgamates of geographies]{.mark} subjected to climate change and
geopolitical contestations [but]{.mark} as [conceptual spaces
where]{.mark} the [traditional notions of sovereignty, legality, and
normativity are now unfrozen and set adrift in the open sea of
speculative jurisprudence]{.mark}.]{.underline} In this space,
**[[speculation]{.mark} becomes a creative endeavour that [seeks to
articulate]{.mark}, [enact visions of coexistence and justice]{.mark}
that are [attuned to the specificities of the polar
ecologies]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}and histories and [[seek new
paths for legal theory]{.mark} and practice [in]{.mark} a [collective
reimagining of what law can and should be]{.mark} in a broader planetary
context.]{.underline}

CREATING MATERIAL BASES FOR THE NATIONS WE WANT Eve: Every time I do a
talk on theories of change, especially on Indigenous feminist theories
of change, someone in the audience asks me to talk about what settlers
can do to aid in Indigenous rematriation. This is not that type of
question! But I do want to learn more from you about how you see your
understandings of change in relation to other theories of change---more
about Martineau's constellation that you mentioned. It seems that you
are saying that theories of change/justice/injustice are specific---both
historically and land specific. [But [is there anything to be said
for]{.mark} [how]{.mark} all of [this]{.mark} specificity
[coheres]{.mark} with other specificities? Latches with other movements?
Leanne: [I get that]{.mark} first type of [question about]{.mark} [what
settlers can do a lot]{.mark} and [I hate it]{.mark} because [it erases
everything I've said]{.mark} in my talk [and]{.mark} [tries]{.mark} [to
recenter]{.mark} the talk [on whiteness]{.mark}; we need to stop
providing the space for that. We have to [create material bases for the
nationhoods we want]{.mark}. We [can't rely on]{.mark} the culture that
[capitalism]{.mark} creates. We just can't. We [can't achieve Indigenous
nationhoods while replicating antiblackness.]{.mark} We [can't have
resurgence without centering gender and queerness]{.mark}, and creating
alternative systems of accountability for sexual and gender violence.
Therefore, [we need to create constellations]{.mark} of connections with
other radical thinkers and doers and makers. We need to [build mass
movements with radical labor,]{.mark} with [Black communities]{.mark},
[with]{.mark} radical [communities of color]{.mark}.]{.underline} We
need to stop providing space for the "What can white allies do"
questions and set up spaces where we can connect with other social
movements and create constellations of mutual support and co-resistance.
My experience as an [Indigenous woman is with colonialism, settler
colonialism, occupation and gender violence, and connecting with radical
Black feminists, for instance, is rich ground]{.underline} for me
because we have different but intimately related experiences with white
supremacy. I watched the recent Black Radical Tradition conference
online and I thought, wow, [[these comrades are thinking and
writing]{.mark} [similar things to me]{.mark} and my Indigenous comrades
[and]{.mark} maybe [there is something in that]{.mark}.]{.underline}21
Not that I want to take and exploit their intellectual work, but more of
a, hey---they have their shit together, they have public intellectuals,
they have movements on the ground. They aren't afraid to talk about the
root of things. That's why resurgence is so important. I am not
particularly interested in holding states accountable because the
structure, history, and nature of states is exploitative by nature. I'm
interested in alternatives, I'm interested in building new worlds.
That's not to say that movements that are working to hold states
accountable should do something differently--- only they would know
that. It's not my place to critique that. I'm saying on a very personal
level, this is not where my skills and thinking lie. [I work exclusively
with Indigenous peoples and theoretically my thinking and work is based
in Indigenous resurgence. [Indigenous peoples standing up]{.mark} on our
lands in a principled, strategic, and articulate way, embodying change,
[is]{.mark} [a]{.mark} fundamentally [different approach than begging
the colonizer for their pity]{.mark}, or centering whiteness in
solidarity or in allyship. [We are not relying on victim
narratives]{.mark}.]{.underline} We need to come at this from a place of
principled strength having done the work, and we need to have the backs
of other communities and movements, instead of continuing to dance for
whiteness. There are other movements doing a better job of this right
now than we are. [Grounded normativity has no space for exploitation,
heteropatriarchy, white supremacy, or antiblackness.]{.underline}

I'm in the process of writing a new book on resurgent mobilization and
I've been thinking a lot about constellations within Nishnaabeg thought.
Dene/Cree scholar Jarrett Martineau's dissertation, "Creative Combat:
Indigenous Art, Resurgence, and Decolonization," uses the artistic
practices of a diverse series of Indigenous provocateurs to examine the
decolonizing potential of art-making to disrupt and interrogate forms of
settler colonialism and advance the project of resurgence and Indigenous
nation building.14 [He really advances this idea of the constellation
drawing upon the work of Indigenous artists' collectives and folks like
Black Constellation. Jarrett uses particular concepts and theories to
create constellations that are flight paths or doorways out of
settler-colonialist representation and thought]{.underline}. That's
interesting to me. What happens when we make a constellation out of,
say, Audra Simpson's work on the politics of refusal, Glen Coulthard's
work on recognition, and Jarrett Martineau's work on constellated
relationships in the context of my own work on Nishnaabeg resurgence?
I'm trying to figure that out. To me, in terms of organizing, this idea
resonates both within Nishnaabeg thought but also in the aftermath of
Idle No More. It is clear to me that we need to think about what
resurgent mobilizing looks like. What does solidarity look like within
grounded normativity?15 [How do we use Indigenous place-based
internationalism to build constellations of coresistance with
non-Indigenous communities who are fighting different aspects of the
same system? This idea that you can bring particular theories or
concepts together fits so well with Nishnaabeg [star mapping]{.mark} and
story.]{.underline} I'd like to apply this on the ground in terms of
organizing--- [[individuals or small collectives]{.mark} (stars)
[organizing within grounded normativity and connected to other
individuals or collectives]{.mark} (stars) [through Indigenous
internationalism makes a lot of sense in terms of creating doorways out
of settler colonialism.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Exclusive framing of resurgence movements as "land back" fails -- resurgence must center gendered and sexual issues through the movement.

[[Too often]{.mark} [within]{.mark} Indigenous [politics]{.mark}, a

[sexual and gender violence]{.mark}, and bodies [are]{.mark} positioned
as [less]{.mark} important---issues that [can wait until]{.mark} we have
the [land back]{.mark}.]{.underline} There is also a gendered nature to
this work and this assumption. [[Men]{.mark} working on land and

serves only to divide us by separating and then positioning sexual and
gender violence as less important to physical dispossession. It also
serves to replicate the heteropatriarchal targeting of women and 2SQ
bodies in particular, and in stark contrast to Indigenous knowledge
systems. [[Resurgence must right this]{.underline}]{.mark}. Kwagiulth
(Kwakwaka'wakw) scholar  Sarah Hunt eloquently explains further that not

must treat body sovereignty]{.mark} with the same urgency and importance
[as political sovereignty]{.mark}: Imagine if we had not lost the
capacity to determine and enforce this power over our homelands and our
bodies]{.underline}. If we started enforcing this now, I can tell you
that there would be many chiefs, language speakers, cultural and
political advocates who would lose their heads, because the version of
resurgence we've been nurturing has allowed for cultural leaders to take
up their roles on the "political" front-lines even while violently
preying on people at home. And we have left victims of violence at the
whim of state actors who regularly demonstrate indifference or contempt
for us, rather than building alternative mechanisms for dealing with
interpersonal violence. [This is not true resurgence.15 We must
continually [ask ourselves how we replicate these systems]{.mark} in our
own lives and in the lives of the organizations and movements we are a
part of, [and]{.mark} collectively [generate on-theground
alternatives]{.mark} that center the experiences and analyses of
children and youth, women, and 2SQ people.]{.underline} Gender violence
and the destruction of Indigenous families are the fundamental dividing
and dispossessional issues of our times. Resurgence will not survive,
exist, or be useful if it continues to replicate the violence against
children, women, and 2SQ people. [[Dispossession under settler
colonialism is gendered, and radical resurgence and nation building must
take this into account in a serious and critical manner]{.mark}. There
is no choice]{.underline}.

As discussed in the Introduction, future-oriented history education
plays an important role in achieving justice for all people, and in
developing effective, accountable and inclusive institutions. Research
on historical knowledge and uses of the past has long problematised the
role of historical thinking and historical consciousness in
intercultural settings (McKenna et al., 2021; Steeves, 2021; Trouillot,
2015). Both Indigenous and non-Indigenous scholars and educators have
criticised how [non-western knowledges and histories are **actively
silenced**]{.underline} and discriminated against [in mainstream
research]{.underline} and education (Berthelsen, 2020; Burke, 2002,
2010; Cutrara, 2018; Rasmussen, 2002). More recently,
[scholars]{.underline} of history education and didactics [have argued
for an **epistemological reorientation**]{.underline}, [while
questioning what is **actually worthwhile**]{.underline} historical
[**knowledge** that transforms and advances]{.underline} intercultural
[understanding]{.underline} (Chapman, 2021). Historical [research not
only provides us with **data** or **evidence**]{.underline} about
historical events, people or spaces; [it also expresses
gendered]{.underline}, [racialised and class-based
perspectives]{.underline}, [and imperial or colonial
**complicity**]{.underline}, [as well as **resistance** to any of these
hegemonic ideas and structures]{.underline} (Fjellheim, 2020; Tester and
Irniq, 2008). On the one hand, historical [thinking aims to
teach]{.underline} '[the skills to **think like a
historian**]{.underline}' ([assess **significance**]{.underline},
[interpret **evidence**]{.underline}, [understand patterns of
**continuity** and **change**]{.underline}, [think through **cause** and
**consequence**]{.underline}, [and appreciate the ethics of **different
perspectives**]{.underline}). On the other hand, [certain
types]{.underline} of historical thinking [actually develop a **marked
intolerance** to alternative epistemologies]{.underline}, [rather than
**broadening** them to include a]{.underline} cosmopolitan,
**[communal]{.underline}** '[conversation]{.underline} about the ways we
can teach and learn history' (Cutrara, 2018: 256). History education
strategist Samantha Cutrara (2018) has noted that [a **structured** or
**disciplinary** approach]{.underline} to historical consciousness
[deliberately **depoliticises**]{.underline} history
[teaching]{.underline}, [making it **difficult** to respond to calls to
**decolonise**]{.underline} and Indigenise Canadian history. A recent
UNESCO report seems to agree: '[Learning with the past]{.underline} --
[particularly past struggles over the future]{.underline} -- [is
**crucial**]{.underline}, we argue, [for holding open education as a
mode of **critique**]{.underline}, [rather than allowing it to
**sustain** systems of domination]{.underline}' (Sriprakash et al.,
2020: 3).

Historical thinking can be defined as an epistemic habit. [A **habit**
is]{.underline} '[something that you do **often** and
**regularly**]{.underline}, sometimes **[without knowing]{.underline}**
that you are doing it' (Cambridge Dictionary, 2022). [Epistemic habits
can]{.underline} therefore [be understood as habits relating to
**knowledge**]{.underline}, [or to the **study** and **production** of
knowledge]{.underline}, [which are repeated **without
self-reflection**]{.underline}, simply [because they have become
**normalised** or **ordinary** through **repetition**]{.underline}.
Historical thinking, as part of history education and research, is also
part of the way in which [educational institutions **reduce** a
plurality of worlds and experiences into **simplistic**]{.underline},
[**transferrable** **frameworks**]{.underline}, [which can be **repeated
more easily** in the habitus of the]{.underline} 'national
**[classroom]{.underline}**' (Lennert and Brincker, 2019). This means
that academic disciplines and educational [subjects]{.underline},
including history, [are]{.underline} still [positioned on]{.underline}
'[the **dark side** of the Enlightenment heritage]{.underline}, and . .
. still [influenced by a **nation-centred** and **colonial** world
view]{.underline}' (Nordgren, 2019: 794).

By critically examining the epistemic habits that shape historical
thinking, avenues for enhancing history literacy towards a more
sustainable future can be identified.

Historical thinking in the Arctic: coloniality on ice

The Arctic region is . . . distinguished by a wealth of Indigenous
communities who have been marginalised, historically, and whose cultural
and linguistic traditions have been undervalued, if not repressed, by
state educational provisions. In the twenty-first century, education is
viewed as important to the empowerment of the Circumpolar North. (Beaton
et al., 2019: 14)

Historians and social scientists have long pointed out the problematic
situation for people living with a colonial history and remaining
asymmetric structures and relations (R. Petersen, 1978).

Figure 1 shows the Indigenous population across the Arctic. It
demonstrates the diversity of communities present, as well as the very
different cultural, historical and geopolitical spaces they occupy
across the circumpolar region. Historical thinking, in this context, is
therefore complicated not only by its own epistemic habitus, but also by
the very structures and relations in which these habits are produced (R.
Petersen, 1978). Kalaaleq (Greenlandic Inuit) scholar and former rector
of Greenland's university, Ilisimatusarfik, Robert Petersen (1978: n.p.)
provides a historical overview of the creation and transmission of
'colonialist attitudes and policies that have persisted in Greenland':

The history of Greenland, written by Danish historians, can hardly be my
peoples' history, but a history from the European archives, where the
material was written by colonial civil servants. They wrote their notes
according to some selective rules that were important for the colonial
administration, so in fact an objective history of Greenland cannot be
written from the Danish archives.

Kalaaleq scholar Aviaja Egede Lynge has defined this as [a form of
**mental colonisation**]{.underline}, which [is enacted]{.underline}
both by historians and by history education itself: 'We have always been
taught that we were one of the best colonies in the world. No slavery,
no killings. We learned it through Danish history books and from Danish
teachers' (Egede Lynge, 2006: 1). [This perspective]{.underline} not
only distorts the relationship between Greenlandic Inuit and their own
history and culture; it also [creates]{.underline} '[a mentality that
indicates a self-consciousness as **inferior** to other ethnic
groups]{.underline}' (Egede Lynge, 2011: 1). [Other scholars have
identified the **critical**]{.underline}, but also potentially
**[transformative]{.underline}**, [role of]{.underline} history
[education in this context]{.underline}. [They point out the
**paradoxes**]{.underline}, [**gaps** in knowledge and opportunities for
**decolonial praxis** that are part of Arctic]{.underline} histories,
epistemologies and [research praxis]{.underline} (Berthelsen, 2020;
Bianco, 2019; Kleist, 2021; Kleist et al., in press; Vold, 2021).

Recent research in Nuuk's secondary school education investigated
examples of significant cultural differences between Danish teachers and
Greenlandic students in educational settings, concluding that 'the
educational regime in Greenland is not suitable for the Greenlandic
culture' (Reimer Olsen, 2021: 2). Using interviews and observations from
the classrooms at GUX (Nuuk's high school), the author commented on a
range of miscommunications that centre on conflicting knowledge and
communication systems between Greenlandic students and their Danish
teachers. So, for example, a focus on verbal communication and
culturally specific ideas about time often leads to a situation where
'de to kulturer taler forbi hinanden' (the two cultures talk past each
other) (Reimer Olsen, 2021: 95). This is not a new phenomenon, with
education being seen as an important part of both the modernisation and
Indigenisation of Greenlandic Inuit (Lennert and Brincker, 2019; R.
Petersen, 1980, 1995b). Yet, at the same time, [education]{.underline}
is also an integral part of 'Greenlandic bureaucracy and state
apparatus', which [is]{.underline} '[**overwhelmingly influenced** by
Western values and epistemologies]{.underline}' (Berthelsen, 2020: 56).
[**Reflecting** on and **restructuring** epistemic habits as part of
**everyday praxis** is]{.underline} thus [one way of **resisting** the
ever-present risk of]{.underline} '[being **absorbed** by a very
different]{.underline}, [**totalising** logic]{.underline}' (Tester and
Irniq, 2008: 59). So, [while Arctic memory cultures are produced as
parts of imperial and colonial historical processes and
narratives]{.underline}, [they are also sites of]{.underline} multiple
**[interventions]{.underline}**, significant, active, geopolitical
domains, and concurrent national and (post)colonial identities
(Graugaard, 2016, 2020; Kleist, 2021; Kleist et al., in press).

[A process of]{.underline} school [**reform** by]{.underline}
Naalakkersuisut ([the]{.underline} Greenlandic
**[Government]{.underline}**) that [took place]{.underline} between 1999
and 2002, Atuarfisialak (the Good School) focused on strengthening
Greenlandic Inuit identities. It was based on 'educational research
among indigenous and postcolonial countries' (Egede Lynge, 2011: 276;
Olsen and Tharp, 2013; Wyatt and Lyberth, 2011). However, as [the **main
focus** of]{.underline} this [reform seemed to be more on the
development of **policies** and **frameworks**]{.underline}, [rather
than on their **implementation**]{.underline} (Lennert and Brincker,
2019), and as its success was evaluated according to indicators provided
by the danish evaluation institute (EVA), [it is **difficult** to see
how it **integrated** Indigenous]{.underline} Greenlandic Inuit
[knowledges]{.underline}, [skills]{.underline}, [values and
attitudes]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} approach, combined with the
fact that danish language and culture are necessary for social and
economic advancement, [set **limits** on the actualisation
of]{.underline} '**[pluriversal worlds of knowing]{.underline}**'
(Lennert Jensen et al., 2022). More nuanced, place-based and Indigenous
research such as this is needed to see how sites of learning actually
transmit Kalaallit knowledges, in particular knowledge about the past,
rather than reproducing epistemically problematic assessments from
outside.

Arctic memory cultures and historical thinking: an oxymoron or a
dialogue?

The title of this section playfully appropriates that of a book chapter
by one of the leading figures in historical thinking in canadian history
education, Peter Seixas, who has questioned whether and how Indigenous
historical knowledge can be considered historical thinking at all (in
Carretero et al., 2012). The reductive approaches of this type of
disciplinary thinking illustrate the way in which [current
scholarship]{.underline} on history education in canada '[imposes a
**settler grammar** over]{.underline} the [study]{.underline} of the
past [in ways that **lessen** the space available to develop the
**respect**]{.underline}, [**openness** for truth]{.underline}, [and
**relationality** needed]{.underline}' (Cutrara, 2018: 125).
Significantly, Cutrara (2018) argues that [this approach]{.underline} to
historical thinking [is **problematic** for both non-Indigenous and
Indigenous teaching and learning alike]{.underline}. [It not only does
**damage** in terms of misrepresenting Indigenous ways of
knowing]{.underline} the past [as **radically diverging** from normal or
standard western]{.underline} historical [thinking]{.underline}; [it
also]{.underline} effectively [attempts to **erase** it]{.underline}
(**[ontologically]{.underline}**) from history education
**[altogether]{.underline}**. Researchers from nordic countries have
managed to offer a more nuanced and critical stance, concluding that the
perceived boundaries of historical consciousness reflect an entirely
realistic tension, rather than incommensurability, between different
knowledge positions -- 'one that defines a specific ability that has
emerged through the specific historical process of Western modernity,
and another, which from more general observations, seeks to understand
how people, at different times and in different cultures, create meaning
through experiences of continuity and change' (Nordgren, 2019: 780).

[Centring this type of **strict disciplinary thinking**]{.underline}
within a standardised national curriculum [**does not actually
increase** the ability of teachers and students to **understand** and
**contextualise** historical sources]{.underline} (Samuelsson and
Wendell, 2016). If anything, [it **makes it more difficult** to
construct truly meaningful accounts]{.underline} of the past, which
seems contrary to the intention behind the historical thinking
methodology. As Maori scholar Linda Tuhiwai Smith (2006: 28) points out,
[this discussion is really about **power** and **justice**]{.underline},
[with colonial viewpoints **clashing** with critical aspects of
self-determination and justice for all]{.underline}: '[The **sense of
history** conveyed by these approaches is not the same
thing]{.underline} as the discipline of history, [and so our accounts
**collide**]{.underline}, [**crash** into each other]{.underline}.' So,
if we are to continue to employ historical thinking in history
education, [is it not a necessity to **unthink** aspects that create
**ignorance**]{.underline}, **[misunderstandings]{.underline}**,
**[erasure]{.underline}** -- in short, [**damage**?]{.underline} As
reconciling, repairing, rewriting and rerighting remain central features
of historical literacy and self-determination for Indigenous scholars,
there is an uneasy relationship between historical thinking and
Indigenous epistemes, especially when it comes to self-reflection: '[If
one **cannot observe** one's own **prejudices**]{.underline}, [the
results will be **filled with ethnocentrism**]{.underline}' (R.
Petersen, 1978: 13). [With oppression and discrimination being
**intentional parts** of colonial epistemologies and
ontologies]{.underline}, and thus of historical thinking itself,
'[Western epistemologies and Indigenous epistemologies **cannot easily
fit together** without being honest that the **colonial grammar** of one
has **delegitimised** the other]{.underline}' (Cutrara, 2018: 268).

An important aspect of understanding Indigenous perspectives is that
[the **very conceptualisation** of Indigenous knowledge is
**not**]{.underline} a **[neutral]{.underline}**, universal or
place-based idea, [but an **intentional** piece of colonial
epistemology]{.underline}. [It aims to **flatten** and
**homogenise**]{.underline} what are [nuanced]{.underline}, [localised
knowledge ecosystems]{.underline}, [**forcing** them into **western
frameworks**]{.underline} (Steeves, 2021). A recent review and mapping
of [Indigenous knowledge]{.underline} concepts [in the
Arctic]{.underline} shows many different types of understanding of this
concept across the circumpolar north. These not only vary significantly
across time and place; they are also shaped by both Indigenous agency,
and by national and transnational colonial and political-economic
processes (Egede Dahl and Tejsner, 2021): 'colonised nations and their
indigenes [have **never** been the **passive victims** of colonial rule
but rather **vibrant actors** with agency]{.underline}, [active
engagement]{.underline}, [and resistance]{.underline}, albeit in
situations with grossly unequal power' (Subramaniam et al., 2016: 423).

In an attempt to communicate this difference to non-Indigenous
audiences, some Indigenous scholars have opted to map their own ways of
knowing on to western knowledge only in very specific cases, in order to
avoid recolonising their own epistemes. Table 1, for example, emphasises
both possible convergences and incommensurabilities when trying to
compare the binary western '-ologies' with plural 'ways of \... '.

These [**frameworks of knowing** can either **limit** or **open up** our
access to]{.underline} '**[ecologies of knowledges]{.underline}**'
(Ndlovu-Gatsheni, 2021), [as]{.underline} both historical [thinking and
historical consciousness are **firmly rooted** in]{.underline}, [and
**complicit** with]{.underline}, [western modernity as an
epistemological paradigm]{.underline} (Burke, 2002). Both as
[intellectual and]{.underline} as [disciplinary praxis]{.underline},
historical thinking and historical consciousness therefore [follow the
imperial]{.underline}, [patriarchal and colonial logic of]{.underline} a
world view created back in the sixteenth century (McKenna et al., 2021).
This world view initially included a wide variety of cosmopolitan and
intercultural ways of thinking that represented and transmitted the past
via local epistemes and highly complex, often non-textual, evidence
(Burke, 2010). However, from the mid-eighteenth century onwards,
[european conceptual frameworks]{.underline} started to calcify into
separate disciplines and networks of cultural, social and political
practices. As a result, [general ideas]{.underline} about time, space
and place [were redefined and renegotiated according to western
imperial]{.underline}, [colonial and capitalist logic]{.underline}
(Berthelsen, 2020; Vuorela, 2009). Peter Burke (2010: n.p.) notes how
[this process resulted in knowledge **gain**]{.underline}, [as much as
**loss**]{.underline}, [in the form of]{.underline}
'**[hiding]{.underline}**, **[destroying]{.underline}** [and
**discarding** of knowledge]{.underline}' -- [which]{.underline} today
[provides]{.underline} '[a **challenge** to any vision of the history of
knowledge as **simple progress** or **accumulation**]{.underline}'.

Maori scholar Linda Tuhiwai Smith (2006) describes a set of nine
interconnected ideas that have shaped history as being conceived as [a
**universal**]{.underline}, [**totalising** discourse]{.underline}. This
discourse constructs the past as [following a **linear timeline**
centred on certain humans]{.underline}, as well as defining the practice
of historical thinking [as part of an]{.underline}
'**[innocent]{.underline}**' [discipline that simply
collects]{.underline} '**[left over]{.underline}**'
[evidence]{.underline} in a chronological order (Smith, 2006: 30--1).
Burke (2002) outlines a similar system of ten canonical principles that
[have **shaped** western]{.underline} historical [thinking]{.underline}.
They range from an emphasis on linear chronologies, progress or
development (control of time), to ideas of detachment and objectivity
(lack of emotional attachment, self-interest or bias), to an emphasis on
expressing a 'western' sense of space that separates humans from land or
territory (that is, map making). It is easy to see how these assumptions
have shaped western historical thinking, including Burke's silence
around important ideas, such as the patriarchal nature of history
(generally assumed to be normal or natural), and [the application of
preconceived imperial/colonial **frameworks** and
**vocabularies**]{.underline}. So, for example, historical thinking, as
disciplinary praxis, defines both gender and gender relations according
to a colonial logic, often imposing patriarchal ideas as normative and
inevitable (Jessen Williamson, 2011; Lugones, 2008). [These more
**reductive** types of]{.underline} historical [thinking also
**distort** other ideas]{.underline}, [such as what counts as
**legitimate evidence**]{.underline}, [or what is of]{.underline}
historical **[significance]{.underline}** at all. [The resulting
disciplinary framework makes it **difficult to escape** the colonial
knowledge paradigm]{.underline} when trying to genuinely think
historically, in a sense of 'learning with the past' (Sriprakash et al.,
2020):

Under colonialism indigenous peoples have struggled against a Western
view of history and yet been complicit with that view. We have often
allowed our 'histories' to be told and have then become outsiders as we
heard them being retold. Schooling is directly implicated in this
process. Through the curriculum and its underlying theory of knowledge,
early schools redefined the world and where indigenous peoples were
positioned within the world. (Smith, 2006: 33)

### FW---Epistemology First---1NC/2NC

#### It\'s your responsibility as an educator to prioritize dismantling colonial epistemologies

**Reeploeg, 23**---Associate Professor, Department of Cultural & Social
History, University of Greenland (Silke, "Unthinking historical
thinking: lessons from the Arctic," History Education Research Journal,
20 (1), 2023, dml/Lowell-DB)

Clearly, [[western education, in the Arctic, has]{.mark} had a [negative
impact on Inuit]{.mark}]{.underline} epistemologies, but also on ways of
being in the world ([[ontologies]{.mark}). When knowledge
is]{.underline} extracted and [only available via the]{.underline}
'accredited tap' [of state]{.underline} education (Rasmussen, 2002: 90),
it is incorporated into what Aymara scholar Rivera Cusicanqui (2012:
102) refers to as the 'political economy' of knowledge. Here, [a
combination of epistemic habits]{.underline} is put to work, [ranging
from traditions of assimilating and [neutralising]{.mark} present or
future [decolonial practices, to]{.mark} 'post'-colonialism and
whitewashing]{.underline} ('liberation' of the subaltern by the colonial
and/or metropolitan centre -- via the urban, educated elite) [to the
creation of strategic intellectual mini-empires (academic decolonisation
discourses separate from praxis/actual change making)]{.underline}. They
include diversions, such as mislabelling movements for Indigenous
sovereignty as 'nationalist' or 'reverse racism', therefore [entrenching
existing ignorance about historical, systemic inequalities. In addition,
[Indigenous science and technology are]{.mark}]{.underline} often
extracted and [[appropriated as resources for]{.mark} more
[colonialism]{.mark}, while denying]{.underline} financial and
institutional [resources for decolonial action]{.underline}, such as
language vitalisation and economic sovereignty. Unsurprisingly, this
process can also be traced in history [education]{.underline}, which
often [prefers to use a [rhetoric of neutrality]{.mark} that
[hides]{.mark} the [epistemic violen]{.mark}ce at the root of historical
thinking behind the cloak of objectivity]{.underline}. So, for example,
it presents bias as a mistake or wrong, subjective, 'stance' that can
easily be overcome through intellectual activity/skills, without
addressing the politics of structural inequality and need for change.
For example, Cusicanqui (2012: 97--8) notes how: 'The cultural studies
departments of many North American universities have adopted
"postcolonial studies" in their curricula with an academicist and
culturalist stamp devoid of the sense of political urgency that
characterised the intellectual endeavors of their colleagues in India.'
A similar transformation in european and nordic universities has not
gone unnoticed, with [[research frames]{.mark} on the human dimensions
of climate change in the Arctic, for example, [excluding the politics of
colonialism]{.mark} from the study of human vulnerability and/or
adaptation]{.underline} (Cameron, 2012).

In Arctic scientific practice, this position often combines with
perceiving local knowledges as ethnographically or anthropologically
interesting, but as ultimately secondary or irrelevant. This has
generated common generalisations and misconceptions about Indigenous
knowledge production: 'Indigenous nations are not inherently
anti-science, but instead aspire to a form of science and knowledge
production that is objective, yet ethical and empathetic to peoples who
have been affected by histories of structural inequality' (Smiles, 2021:
227[). Framing Inuit]{.underline} historie[s as]{.underline} politically
inactive 'cultures' whose authors are [merely victims of modernity,
imperialism, colonialism or climate change, rather than people in
constant interaction with, and resistance to, all of these, has long
been part of education]{.underline} and politics [in the
Arctic]{.underline} (R. Petersen, 1995a; Rasmussen, 2002). As is the
case with historical thinking, [[these epistemic habits]{.mark} are
designed to [continue colonial structures]{.mark},]{.underline}
relations and discourses into the future, rather than to restructure
them in the present. They form part of 'A tacit agreement to
misinterpret the world' (Berenstain, 2016: 586), but they are also the
basis for finding counter-narrative opportunities and possibilities for
change.

Changing habits and restructuring relations: lessons from the Arctic

The ethnic condition is ironic, indeed: on the one hand, by our own
example, we are a necessary, external contribution to the European
self-perception; on the other hand, due exactly to this self-perception,
we are not quite matching the European superiority, and must generally
remain a sadly outdistanced supplement, an unbearable reminder. (Arke,
2006: 3)

The previous analysis has explored, on both a theoretical and a
practical level, whether and [how]{.underline} scholars and [[sites of
learning]{.mark}]{.underline} should and [[can
resist]{.underline}]{.mark} what Spivak (1987: 199) calls the
'sanctioned ignorance' that is achieved through [[the epistemic habits
of western]{.mark} historical [thinking]{.mark}]{.underline}. One way to
unlearn existing epistemic habits is perhaps to follow Nordgren's (2019)
suggestion to [understand historical consciousness as an interpretative
process that is both trans-historical and trans-cultural.]{.underline}
This approach at least allows us to unthink the rationality that guides
questions around historical thinking. It allows for the assimilation of
historical thinking into critical pedagogical practices that create
reparative futures (Sriprakash et al., 2020) with 'an openness to
letting the present and the future impose new requirements on the past'
(Nordgren, 2019: 794).

[Indigenous scholars]{.underline} such as Rauna Kuokkanen (2017) [also
suggest a more active role [for educator]{.mark}]{.underline}[s]{.mark}
and academia. She points out that it is [[the
responsibility]{.underline}]{.mark} of both the individual academic,
academic disciplines and academia as a whole, [[to actively engage
with]{.mark} unjust and ignorant epistemic habits -- 'in the form of
responding and reciprocating' to [Indigenous epistemes]{.mark} and other
forms of knowledge]{.underline} (Kuokkanen, 2017: 323). When the
Greenlandic artist and philosopher Pia Arke (2006: 16) states that 'The
suppressed remains suppressed no matter how conscious I am of its
suppression', she points to a central problematic within dominant
postcolonial historical thinking. While [postcolonial
[theory]{.mark}]{.underline} has been very successful in pinpointing the
perplexities of the postcolonial condition, it [[has failed in
fostering]{.mark} accountability and [action]{.mark} when it comes to
addressing complicity with existing colonial structures, ideas and
methodologies]{.underline} (Arke, 2006; Vuorela, 2009). So, rather than
continuing a never-ending loop of pointing out oppression and silences,
she suggests filling the silences and gaps intentionally, with
intercultural dialogue and opportunities 'to play with the pieces of
different worlds' (Arke, 2006: 17). This means [[intentionally
transforming]{.mark} historical literacy and history [education
into]{.mark} a form of [productive dialogue]{.mark} with knowledges
[outside the existing 'cognitive empire']{.mark}]{.underline}
(Ndlovu-Gatsheni, 2021: 882). It means [engaging in a process that
starts by [adopting viewpoints and methods that]{.mark} interrogate and
[dismantle the logic of coloniality]{.mark}, instead of continuing
it]{.underline}. This way, we all participate in unthinking and
[[unlearning western modernity]{.mark} as an epistemological
paradigm.]{.underline}

[In the history of how outsiders imagine the Arctic, we can also make a
connection to what Homi Bhabha calls [the "liminal problem of colonial
identity]{.mark}]{.underline}" that emerges from the "disturbing
distance in-between" the colonialist 'Self' and colonized 'Other'
(Bhabha 1994: 64). [The wilderness/ civilization dichotomy that
[is]{.mark} [at the heart of many imaginaries]{.mark} of the Arctic is
perhaps [similar to]{.mark} the [colonizer/colonized]{.mark},
[or]{.mark} '[Western'/'Other' dichotomy]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
[[comparison]{.mark} of dichotomies [can]{.mark} perhaps
[unearth]{.mark} certain [racist tropes that]{.mark} have [othered
Indigenous Arctic people]{.mark} in political discourse]{.underline} and
visual and literary culture, and [help [to develop an
anti]{.mark}-[colonial lens]{.mark} through which [to better understand
the aesthetics of the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. Such a comparison can
allow us to begin to comprehend the ontological connections between the
ideas of wilderness/civilization (Cronon 1995; Kollin 2001; Oelschlaeger
1991) and colonizer/other (Bhabha 1994; Spivak 2012), uncovering a nexus
centering around notions of objectivity and exteriorization of body and
landscape. This [can encourage aesthetic readings of texts, films,
performances, and political discourse that reveal (neo-)colonial agendas
of exploration and settlement, [ultimately leading to an anti-colonial
agenda of self-realization for Indigenous Arctic people]{.mark}. In
seeking such agendas we can ask how Arctic research stations, oil rigs,
and cruise ships are (re)inscribing colonial legacies onto the sea,
land, and people of the region.]{.underline} If outsiders studying the
Arctic move away from thinking in the wilderness/civilization dichotomy,
from the ontology of the sovereign state, then [[we]{.mark} can begin to
[find new theories and ontologies for thinking about the Arctic in
ways]{.mark} that are [more emancipatory for Indigenous
people]{.mark}.]{.underline} Indeed the burgeoning field of posthuman
studies may hold a major key for how we Think, talk, and act about the
Arctic in an ecologically sustainable and anti-colonial way. The Arctic
in the Anthropocene Non-Indigenous people such as myself, who will
always be profoundly on the outside when studying the Arctic, must
develop new ways of thinking about the region that eschew the dichotomy
of wilderness/civilization, which seems to lead inextricably to the
othering of the peoples and environments of the Arctic[.

[The third tendency is the **increased harm** done to Arctic Indigenous
Peoples\' territory]{.underline}, [cultures]{.underline},
[knowledge]{.underline}, [practices]{.underline}, [health]{.underline},
[and lifeways]{.underline} (Figure 3 a). [**Fifteen** out of the
**sixteen** cases reported]{.underline} these [**life** and **death**
concerns]{.underline} (Batalla, 2020; Kuokkanen, 2023). [The
Sámi]{.underline}, [Iupiat]{.underline}, [Nenets]{.underline},
[Doglan]{.underline}, [Evenki]{.underline}, [Dena]{.underline},
[Entsy]{.underline}, [Inuvialuit]{.underline}, [and Nganasan are
Indigenous communities **actively resisting** them]{.underline} (Figure
3 b). Their primary concern is the loss of reindeer herding or caribou
migration and survival, along with their knowledge, practices,
landscapes, sacred sites, and overall human-nature relationships. This
cultural revival throughout the examples analyzed reveals that reindeer
herding is essential to Sámi and Nenets culture. Normann (2021) explains
that [shared memories]{.underline}, [interactions with other
communities]{.underline}, [and collective activities are **effective
modes of mobilization** against green colonialism]{.underline}, which
continue to damage reindeer herders and other Arctic peoples. Thus, the
continuation of historical extractivist colonial pressures intensifies
through the green shift, territorial invasion, and socio-cultural and
environmental erasure (Clark, 2021; Kuokkanen, 2023). Access to hunting,
fishing, whaling, and sealing is also a source of contention. As
Inuvialuit hunters and community members of Baffin Island stated
\'\'\[...it is\] our right to eat, and our right to continue to live off
the land as we choose, as we have always done\'\' (Bennett, 2021). Yet,
the long history of anti-mining and anti-oil struggles has had a
significant influence on both the physical, the emotional, and mental
wellbeing of the Arctic peoples (Bjørst et al., 2022). [Extractivisms
cause **emotional anguish** to locals by turning **highly political**
issues into **apolitical** and **technical** questions]{.underline}
(ibid). [Corporate-state nexuses]{.underline} also [try to **dissuade**
people from radical resistance]{.underline}, [but instead to express
their views by **colonial** and often **Eurocentric** forms
of]{.underline} private negotiation, participating in certification,
stakeholder [**dialogue** and other **non-contentious**
politics]{.underline}, such as sustainable mining roundtables or even
state consultation and corporate dialogue [in green colonial
contexts]{.underline} (Fjellheim, 2023). [Dunlap & Riquito]{.underline}
(2023) [discuss in depth the **psycho-social damage** that
the]{.underline} pro-mining [corporate-government nexuses contribute to
in green extractivism attempts]{.underline}, such as lithium mining.

The fourth tendency is [rising **resistance** to Arctic
extractivisms]{.underline}. Impacts of climate change [have]{.underline}
long [influenced mobilization]{.underline} of socio-environmental
conflicts [**across** the Arctic]{.underline} (Balzer, 2015; Fedorova &
Mitryaykina, 2021; Magomedov, 2019). In fact, the links between land and
nature, livelihoods, and survival and resistance are all intertwined
with Arctic climate challenges. [Concerns over water]{.underline},
[land]{.underline}, [culture]{.underline}, [hazardous
waste]{.underline}, [and climate change have surfaced as **key
elements** in the anti-colonial efforts in the Arctic]{.underline}
(Figure 2). In the Arctic, the [resistance revolves around historical
and green **extractivisms** in particular]{.underline}. This is [because
green extractivisms **perpetuate** climate colonialities and establish
an **uninterrupted axis** of **false**]{.underline} climate
**[solutions]{.underline}**, [**exacerbating** an already worrisome
situation on Arctic changing territories and climates]{.underline}.
Increasingly, [anti-colonial movements]{.underline}, in the broad sense,
[**reshape** extractivist trajectories]{.underline}. Opposition does
this [by similar strategies to those used in **other
contexts**]{.underline}, [including]{.underline} for example
**[collective resistance]{.underline}**, **[media
activism]{.underline}**, [and **blockade actions** against extractive
colonialities that **devastate** the people and the

### FW---Reps Shape Reality---1NC/2NC

#### Reps of Arctic Indigenous peoples shape reality.

Andrew **Chater** 7-6-20**21**. Dr. Andrew Chater: Assistant Professor
in political science, Brescia University College. "Inuit in the Arctic
Council: How Does Depiction Differ?", Northern Review 51 (2021),
<https://doi.org/10.22584/nr51.2021.009> \[AY\]

[Literature on Arctic Council discourse focuses on general descriptions
of the Arctic in media and concludes that those descriptions impact
public opinion]{.underline}. Previous work has found that media
description of the AC in Canada and the United States is largely
accurate in accounting its role and function; such accounts occur in the
context of reporting on climate change or perceived Arctic regional
tensions.3 Landriault argues that [the way the media writes about the
Arctic impacts the way the public understands the issue: "The less
attention newspapers pay to the Arctic, the less public opinion approves
of confrontational strategies to deal with circumpolar
issues."]{.underline}4 The author finds a link between media coverage
and public opinion: "In fact, more positive coverage of Arctic issues
during the 2010--2015 period coincided with more support for seeking
compromises and negotiations in Canadian public opinion."5 He further
writes that governmental actors have a particularly crucial role in
building discourse: "Thus, public preferences can be tilted in specific
directions, which makes them particularly susceptible to partisan
political messaging."6 [The language used to describe Indigenous Peoples
can impact the way people think about these Indigenous organizations and
their influence]{.underline}.

Existing literature finds that environment and economy are frames
frequently present in discourse about the Arctic region. I have argued
that [previous governments]{.underline}, namely the Harper government in
Canada (2006--2015), [underplayed the threat of Arctic climate change to
the livelihood of Arctic residents and, by extension, to Indigenous
Peoples, focusing instead on the threat to the ecosystem.7 Government
rhetoric frequently frames climate change as a threat to ecosystems and
wildlife]{.underline}.8 Lara Johannsdottir and David Cook study the
Arctic Circle Assembly, a major international conference sponsored by
the Government of Iceland to facilitate collaborative opportunities
between governments and non-state actors. They find that [early Arctic
Circle Assembly events focused on "development, energy, security,
research and science, challenges, cooperation and businesses," but not
necessarily Indigenous Peoples]{.underline}.9 This article seeks to add
to this earlier research by explicitly studying the description of Inuit
in government discourse about the Arctic Council.

Extensive literature regarding discourse around Indigenous Peoples often
focuses on depictions of Indigenous culture in education materials and
government rhetoric; a major finding in this literature is that
[government discourse is often problematic. The current literature about
Indigenous Peoples in the AC examines their role, influence, and power,
but not explicitly discourses and frames]{.underline} (i.e., the
significance and limits of the language used).10 Beyond literature on
the AC, Robert Harding finds that, historically, a dominant media
discourse regarding Indigenous Peoples is that they represent a threat
to Canada, in ways both implicit and explicit.11 Whitney Lackenbauer
finds that media reports frequently mischaracterize the role and powers
of the Canadian Rangers (reserves of the Canadian armed forces), the
majority of whom are Indigenous.12 Peter Nines uncovers that Australian
and Canadian textbooks describing Indigenous lifestyles sometimes
include language that might inadvertently reinforce negative stereotypes
(such as their way of life being "traditional").13 Writers have been
critical that government discourse on Indigenous Peoples draws
distinctions between Indigenous people living on reserves and urban
centres when discussing their rights.14 In contrast, M. Lynn Aylward
argues that elements of Inuit culture and practices are common in the
curriculum of Nunavut despite the Western epistemological basis of the
material.15 Looking beyond the AC, existing literature on discourse
finds that government rhetoric often problematizes the role of
Indigenous Peoples in history and Canadian society. The research
reported in this article helps uncover whether these themes carry
forward to discourse on the AC.

[Inuit critiques of existing research and discourse on Indigenous
Peoples emphasize that interactions in the Arctic region should reflect
Inuit Knowledge and priorities. Proponents of community-based research
call for information exchanges that are authentic,16 co-created,
mutually beneficial, and organically constructed]{.underline},17 while
developing local capacity and partnerships.18 [These relationships must
arise through experience over time19 and be collaborative with community
members.20 The research often includes strategies for community
dissemination]{.underline}.21 Pitseolak Pfeifer writes,

[Arctic research must ensure that 1) Inuit knowledge and everyday
practices on the land are recognized as a qualitative mode of inquiry
producing scientific evidence, and 2) Western ethical research and
publication standards do not exclude recognition of Inuit communities
(i.e., hunters, harvesters, and Knowledge Keepers) as equally valid
references]{.underline}.22

The largest organization that domestically represents Inuit who live in
Canada, [Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, says, "Current policies]{.underline}
that structure federal Inuit Nunangat research funding processes [tend
to curtail Inuit self-determination in research and consequently
marginalize Inuit research priorities."23 They continue, "This hampers
our collective ability to document and create the knowledge required to
more effectively address the needs of our people."]{.underline}24 A
dominant theme in this literature is that [Indigenous Peoples must be
partners and leaders in developing Arctic research]{.underline}. This
article examines whether this theme of collaboration carries forward to
discourse on the AC.

[On that sea, in [1848, commercial whalers]{.mark} from New England
[crossed]{.mark} through the Bering Strait [to kill bowheads for]{.mark}
the [energy]{.mark} in their blubber. [The process they began]{.mark}
[is]{.mark} the focus of this book: the [reduction of]{.mark} an
[ecological space]{.mark}, [in]{.mark} all its [complexity, to]{.mark} a
source of [commodities]{.mark}. [When]{.mark} they had killed whales
nearly to extinction, foreigners turned to walruses and foxes on the
coasts. Then [appetites moved inland]{.mark}, among caribou and
reindeer, [animals]{.mark} whose bodies eventually [fed American]{.mark}
and Soviet [miners]{.mark} [as they turned over]{.mark} the
[earth]{.mark} to find gold and tin.]{.underline} Foreigners followed in
time the concentration of energy in Beringian space, and species. This
book follows their pursuit of that energy, its five sections moving from
sea to coast, coast to land, land underground, and finally back into the
ocean.

The timeline of these journeys covers roughly a century and a half,
beginning in the 1840s and ending near the present. It is a period as
short as a wingbeat in Beringia's history: the seas and mountains here
took millions of years to form; entire species---mammoths and beavers
the size of bison---lived thousands of generations, then disappeared
forever. [[Humans made a succession of societie]{.mark}s across
millennia, [distinguished]{.mark} now [by]{.mark} their
[artifacts]{.mark}: minute tools; carved figures with eerie, screaming
faces; monuments made from bowhead whale ribs.]{.underline} In the
thirteenth century, a civilization called the Thule spread from the
Bering Strait to Greenland. Hundreds of years later, Iñupiat, Yupik, and
Chukchi inherited their Beringian territory and filled it with new
histories. "By the nineteenth century, each nation told that history
differently, each with its own narratives of origin and transformative
events. Generally, there were two kinds of past: what Iñupiat call
unipkaaq, or myth and legend from a deep, indefinite, cyclical sort of
time, and uqaluktuaq, or histories of wars, shamanic feats, and events
in known, linear time. Both kinds of histories were filled with souls,
beings of earth and sky and water that existed in active relationship
with human persons. Some souls were animal, or animals who were once
people; others were giants, or spirits without bodies, or rocks that
spoke. All filled the world with action, leaving no neat cleavage
between subjects who acted and the objects acted upon. Simply telling
stories, which brought the past of these beings into the present, made
both the teller and audience a conduit for souls.4 A conduit of a past
in which much of what made human history wasn't human at all. [What made
the 1840s distinct [in Beringia]{.mark} was thus not change, but [new
agents of transformation]{.mark}, the foreigners who [arrived with
their]{.mark} proliferation of [ideas]{.mark}]{.underline}. From whalers
killing for the market to bureaucrats trying to make borders between
states to young Bolshevik evangelists promising utopia, foreigners came
to Beringia with habits of mind born far away. They came as I had,
familiar with temperate agricultural bounties and the industrial
capacity to take the energy in things---trees, coal, oil---and turn it
into propulsion and power. From these relationships of conversion,
nineteenth-century authors from Karl Marx to Andrew Carnegie wrote new
theories of time---[[theories]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [which]{.mark}
objective [laws]{.mark} [moved]{.mark} human [history from bare]{.mark}
hunter-[gathering]{.mark} life [to]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
[surpluses]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [settled]{.mark} agriculture,
[and]{.mark} [onward to]{.mark} the possibilities for [growth]{.mark},
freedom, and plenty unleashed [by]{.mark} industry. This was the process
of [civilization, a telos]{.mark} [of]{.mark} using ever more of static
nature, ever more energy, to make things of cultural
[value]{.mark}.]{.underline} I was an inheritor of these theories, of a
world in which entering the march of progress made a person human, and
only humans made history.

On this, the particular human character of change, Marx and Carnegie and
their diverse interpreters roughly agreed. They disagreed on much else.
Their differences, after a period of market hunting, split Beringia
between the ideological choices of the United States and the Soviet
Union. The Chukchi and Seward Peninsulas, so alike in their hostility to
agriculture and challenges to industry, thus hosted an experiment in how
different human visions---Beringian, capitalist, socialist---met, mixed,
divided.

[The Arctic Council, lacking formal legislative powers, facilitates

Kneil, [it has contributed to **reasserting** rather than
**diminishing** the territorial claims of these states, embedding the

domains.16 This includes a **procedural requirement** for non-Arctic
states seeking observer status to respect Arctic
sovereignty,]{.underline} as outlined in the Council's 2013 procedural
rules, [inadvertently **supporting existing colonial dynamics** over

role as a political forum, the Arctic Council is a pivotal producer of

several key multilateral agreements focused on Arctic-specific issues,

What followed became the spine of what many of us now refer to as
"**[[Arctic exceptionalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**": the early 1990s
Finnish initiative, the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy, the
creation of the Arctic Council in 1996, the rise of Indigenous
representation (although Indigenous peoples had been politically
organising in the Arctic at least since the late 1970s, outside the
region since the time of the League of Nations, and Indigenous
resistance since the onset of colonisation), the institutional layering
of chairships and declarations (or lack thereof), the careful
choreography of consensus-ish even when global politics fractured
elsewhere. It is a story that has been repeated so many times, it is now
part of the canon of Arctic governance. And like any good story, [its
power [lies]{.mark} not in what it says, but [in **how it**]{.mark}
**i[s told]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

This is not accidental. [[The]{.mark} architecture of this Arctic
[story]{.mark} has [become **mythical**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Arctic
is cast as the setting for a drama of international harmony. [Arctic
cooperation became narrated through the idea of Arctic exceptionalism:
an idea that relationships in the region could be **[sheltered from
geopolitics elsewhere]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The normative claim of
this narrative is that there is a possibility, in the emerging global
age, to avoid the reoccurrence of a Cold War--style, East-West
confrontation, by bringing into political existence the best version of
the Arctic as an "exceptional" region. Again, like any good story, it
had its detractors‏. International relations scholars and practitioners
who would question, sometimes with accuracy, whether the Arctic was
truly geopolitically exceptional or if governance in the region barely
reflected the world order. [[At the start of]{.mark} the war in
[Ukraine]{.mark}, most of us were met with a "told you so!" from more
realist colleagues.]{.underline}

Like any good story, [[the myth]{.mark} of Arctic exceptionalism **still
[endures]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The explanation is rather simple: [[it
follows]{.mark} the familiar [a]{.mark}rc of **[heroic
narrative]{.mark}**]{.underline}: a visionary call, an assembly of
characters, a moment or moments of crisis, a rise through trials and, at
least for now, a work toward the restoration of balance. [It contains
all the elements of enduring myth: **hope**, **danger**,
**transformation**, and **moral clarity**]{.underline}. The myth can be
seen as a normative concept that prescribes the Arctic as a unique
region with a set of unwritten rules, beliefs and history that have
given it a degree of immunity to many of the world's geopolitical
problems. However, as any myth told and retold through countless
generations, some aspects were misunderstood, and along the way, we
potentially conflated the health of a small, peripheral political and
scientific body for the health of Arctic governance itself. We mistook
what could be achieved with the limited tools available. [Even [the
geopolitics that]{.mark} came **[crash]{.mark}ing [on the Arctic's
doorstep]{.mark}** in 2022, which suspended the work of the Arctic
Council, [was **narratively absorbed**]{.mark}. The Council is not
broken, we are told. It is **paused**. It will **resume**. It has
resumed in limited capacity.]{.underline} The story goes on and the
gavel is passed. That is not to say the Arctic Council is not important;
far from it. However, it is only one aspect of what makes the Arctic
exceptional. The real question is [what happens when [the myth
**outlives its capacity**]{.mark} to explain what truly occurs in the
region?]{.underline}

[[The]{.mark} persistence of this narrative structure has]{.underline},
in recent years, become a form of conceptual inertia. It has [allowed
[Arctic]{.mark} governance to remain [anchored in a self-image that **no
longer reflects**]{.mark} the region's political or ecological
[realiti]{.mark}es.]{.underline} The Arctic of 1987 and 1996 is no more.
This is no longer a periphery, even when, too often, it still feels like
it is in states' foreign policy. And, [[for the people]{.mark} in the
region **[it never was]{.mark}**. It is central to **[global climatic
systems]{.mark}**, to shifting patterns of **[economic
investment]{.mark}**, to the geostrategic calculations of **[state and
corporate actors]{.mark}**. The region is [marked by]{.mark} new forms
of **[extraction]{.mark}**, new [tech]{.mark}nologies [of **surveillance
and intervention**, and]{.mark} new **[claims to resources]{.mark}** to
serve in the so-called green transition]{.underline} (we all need the
critical minerals, you see?!). [These [are not]{.mark} outside
[disruptions. They are **part of the Arctic**]{.mark} now.]{.underline}

And [yet, [the language of **exceptionalism**]{.mark}
**lingered**]{.underline}. The notion that the Arctic can remain somehow
above politics, or at least adjacent to tensions, persists in public
statements and institutional documents. Of course, [this rhetorical
insulation [is **narratively convenient**]{.mark}. It allows actors [to
**defer difficult questions**, about **militarisation**]{.mark},
sometimes about **[Indigenous rights]{.mark}** or about our shared
(non-)extractive futures, mostly because they do not fit the mythic
arc.]{.underline} But [[the Arctic was **never**]{.mark} **truly
[insulated]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [The peace]{.underline}]{.mark} [it
projected [was always **partial**]{.mark}, the [cooperation
**conditional**]{.mark}, the [exclusions
**structured**]{.mark}.]{.underline} To say "the Arctic is exceptional.
Period." therefore lacks nuances. This is not to say that there are not
serious academic debates going on about whether Arctic exceptionalism
went away in 2022 but, rather, what we need to develop is a more complex
story about the production of the myth itself and the outcomes no one
could have predicted when the myth first formed in the late 1990s.
Arguing against the old blanket exceptionalism and for a renewed
engagement of why exactly the Arctic remains "exceptional" beyond
geopolitics does not diminish the real achievements of Arctic diplomacy.
On the contrary, it acknowledges that the myth, if left unexamined, can
become a form of forgetting.

There were some additional narratives that emerged across the policies
that bear noting here as well. In some rare instances, the
[[Arctic]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [mythologised]{.mark}, where in the 2013
Managing for the Future in a Rapidly Changing Arctic [policy]{.mark},
the Arctic is described as (p. 33) 'hold\[ing\] an inspiring and diverse
array of natural beauty and life']{.underline} and in the 2019 Coast
Guard's Strategic Outlook, 'the Arctic is an [exceptional
place.]{.underline}' Then Secretary of State Pompeo, in his speech [to
the Arctic [Council]{.mark}, even claimed that 'the world has long felt
the [magnetic pull towards the Arctic]{.mark}.' Ho]{.underline}wever,
the [[word 'pristine']{.mark} was only [used]{.mark}
[once]{.mark}]{.underline} and interestingly, this idea of
[mythologising the Arctic wilderness [contrasts]{.mark} with the more
common framing of the Arctic as a theatre for [geopolitical
competition]{.mark}.]{.underline} This framing began in 2019 with
Pompeo's speech describing the wilderness as an 'arena for power and
competition' and was repeated across the policies from 2019 to 2021.
Whether the region was framed as a (p. 6) '[potential vector for an
attack ... and key theater of competition' by the [D]{.mark}epartment
[o]{.mark}f [D]{.mark}efence in 2019, that its (p. 2) 'capacity as a
[strategic buffer]{.mark} is eroding' by the Air Force, (p. 13) as 'a
new [operating]{.mark} [environment]{.mark} [for]{.mark} [naval]{.mark}
forces', as a (p. 2) 'potential corridor for [strategic
competition']{.mark}]{.underline}, or as (p. 7) '[fuelling the emergence
of Great Power Competition]{.underline} in the region ... \[attributed
to a\] rise in [nation-state ambitions]{.underline} throughout the
region' -- there is no question that [this [geopolitical]{.mark} framing
of the Arctic wilderness is a recent [narrative]{.mark},
[selectively]{.mark} [activated]{.mark} in response to an American
perception that great power competition has already entered the Arctic
space.]{.underline}

[This interesting contrast]{.underline} between mythologising and
geopolitical competition comes back to the idea that in [American
society]{.underline}, the wilderness [has no standard and meaningful
definition]{.underline} -- that instead, it [reflects the broader
[hegemonic]{.mark} social relations]{.underline} of the time.[Footnote34
Thus, this geopolitical framing has been more recently used in the
Arctic because of the more global social & geopolitical way of
[understanding]{.mark} politics on the world
stage]{.underline}.Footnote35 The mythologising of wilderness further
illustrates that mythology has a time and place when justifying American
Arctic Policy but less so now in the face of geopolitical competition.
The two narratives -- one of mythologising and another of geopolitical
competition -- while not as consistent as the three themes mentioned
previously, do pop up across different time periods. Considering the
region as a potential theatre for great power rivalry, interestingly,

[The [Alaska]{.mark}n space [served as a place for]{.mark} American
[policymakers]{.mark} [to supplant new conceptions of
normativity]{.mark} based on western ideals.]{.underline} [[One]{.mark}
of these concepts [was]{.mark} the [integration]{.mark} [of the
capitalist]{.mark} market [economy]{.mark} [into]{.mark} ways of life
the relied-on [subsistence hunting]{.mark}]{.underline}.141 This was
seen as a crucial necessity to bring Native Alaskans into an image of
prosperous self-sufficient modernity. For example, Walrus hunting and
ivory harvesting were incentivized to provide for basic interaction with
the exportation of commodities in exchange for basic modern goods like
rifles, ammunition, radios, and electric tools.142 [Retaining the image
of market integration was only one of the focus of policymakers as new
developments emerged.]{.underline} This tradition as argued by historian
Traci Bynne Voyles [[manifests itself as]{.mark} an embodiment of the
idea of "[Settler colonialism]{.mark}" which is described as "a form of
colonial power that involves the settler making a home in a land that is
already home to Indigenous peoples."143 This settler colonialist thought
[allows]{.mark} the [entitlement of the American state to Indigenous
lands]{.mark}, [especially]{.mark} in lands that are deemed as
"[uninhabited" or worthless]{.mark} in western settler colonialist
views.]{.underline} [The construction of these lands as having no
inherent value to the state allows for the justification of
dispossessing Indigenous inhabitants while providing little benefit to
their own communities]{.underline}. In the Arctic regions, this is also
supported by the concept of "temperate normativity" as developed by
Alaskan Native historian Jen Rose Smith (Eyak). [[Temperate
normativity]{.mark} [is]{.mark} the [demarcation]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[polar]{.mark} and frigid [climates]{.mark}, and those who move through
them, [as inferior]{.mark} to temperate regions which are deemed to be
Eurocentric standards of agricultural fertility and sedentary
lifestyles.144 [In]{.mark} the Arctic [Alaska]{.mark}n regions, [this
projects an inferior categorization onto Indigenous lands]{.mark} that
cannot sustain agriculture, places where permafrost and seasonal
freezing prevents crop creation, [and further encourages white settler
colonialist]{.mark} force[s]{.mark} like the U.S military [to utilize
these lands]{.mark}, and their peoples, for what is deemed as a more
efficient usage of space.]{.underline} In the context of the global Cold
War, these more efficient usages of space often involved the military
scientific complex that had begun to employ the Arctic as a natural
laboratory in the Cold War period. [[This creates a power
imbalance]{.mark}, [or]{.mark} environmental [injustice]{.mark}, that is
significantly more severe for Indigenous peoples who occupy these
"barren" spaces]{.underline}. Voyles terms this phenomena
["wastelanding" and argues [that]{.mark} it [takes]{.mark} two forms:
either [stripping]{.mark} the [value from nonwhite lands]{.mark}
[or]{.mark} the subsequent [devastation of the environment]{.mark} by
pollutive industries]{.underline}.145 Despite these intense pressures of
the Cold War state, Native communities also expressly resisted these
developments through vocal opposition and community organization that
exercised a distinct amount of power on the local and federal political
level.

[was]{.mark} the problem of [enclosure]{.mark}. [Beringian]{.mark}
[spaces]{.mark} and lives [were supposed to follow a single set of
laws]{.mark} and prophecies. It was a problem foreigners had confronted
since Roys struck his first bowhead: [the sea was]{.mark} [never]{.mark}
properly of [a nation]{.mark}; [the coast refused to stay still; the
tundra rebelled.]{.mark}]{.underline} Beringia's underground was a
different sort of challenge. Not that the earth is inert; its shifts
dispersed nuggets and flakes of gold in Arctic streams. [But in the
short breath of a human generation, these changes are slight enough to
be nearly invisible]{.underline}. Gold never stands up and flees the
miner's pan. It does not eat or breed or scatter with changes in
weather. The challenge of mining is undoing stasis, in altering the
entropic results of deep time.

[Changing the bones of Earth is a question of energy.]{.underline} Not
harvesting it, but applying it, with pickax labor or steam power. Placer
mines, where ores lie near the surface, needed calories to turn over
gravels and mud to sift out gold. Lode mines, where metal is
concentrated in veins far underground, needed power to blast away stone.
From the beginning of the Nome gold rush in 1898 onward, the energy to
remake Beringia was rarely local. Whether with human work or the
fossilized sunlight burned in coal dredges and gasoline "engines, mining
reversed the outflow of Beringian energy in whale blubber, walrus fat,
and reindeer meat.

The [[extractivist mentality]{.underline}]{.mark}, as rendered in the
previous section, [[provided the underlying rationale for]{.mark} the
[rapid industrial transformation of Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[regions]{.underline}]{.mark} during the late Industrial Revolution and
into the twentieth century. In a region defined-- by many southern-based
governments and industrial actors-- in terms of remoteness, sparsity of
population, and extremity of climate and landscape, mining, in
particular, provided the catalyst for frontier development and
colonization by modern states. Mining was a "frontiering" activity in
the sense that it advanced the physical and social transformation of far
away "wilderness" regions into resources for modern industry and
governments, while implanting southern technologies and settlement forms
into (largely) previously Indigenous territories (Knudsen et al., 2022).
[Indeed, [extractivism]{.mark} [materially reconfigured Arctic
societies]{.mark} and spaces [through the logic of]{.mark} resource
extraction, whether undertaken via forms of "[primitive
accumulation"]{.mark} such as gold rushes, advanced industrial
capitalist enterprises, or authoritarian, state-led development, as in
the Soviet Union]{.underline}. [Industrializing markets, spurred by
nationalist ideologies, as well as both capitalist and communist
ambitions regarding the conquering of frontiers, [led to a "race" for
the Arctic]{.mark} and its resources.]{.underline} For instance, the
large-scale iron mining complexes of northern Sweden emerged at the end
of the nineteenth century after the completion of a rail line from
Malmberget and Kiruna to tidewater (at Luleå and Narvik, Norway) opened
the region's rich iron resources to European markets. The logistics
created by the mine, with hydroelectric power stations and power lines,
built, in the early 1900s, what was then the largest single
infrastructure system in northern Fennoscandia (Hansson, 2006). Other
large developments followed as the Swedish Arctic rapidly industrialized
and new settlements were established in this multilingual, culturally
rich region, also the home of the Sámi. 41 Although on a smaller scale,
Norwegian and Finnish mining also expanded as part of concerted efforts
to extend state control over Arctic territories and with similar
tensions. The Soviet Arctic, too, saw large-scale settlements develop
around extractive sites, particularly in the Kola Peninsula region and,
to a lesser extent, in the Russian Far East. These industrial centers,
however, emerged out of authoritarian state initiatives (such as
Stalin's Five Year Plans) to develop Arctic resources and
infrastructure, rather than flows of mining capital (Josephson, 2014;
Wilson & Stammler, 2016). The infamous Kolyma gold mines were integrated
into the brutal Gulag system of forced labor and, to some extent, forced
and induced settlement was a feature of many Soviet Arctic mining
communities. Today much activity in Arctic Russia is fly-in-fly-out, and
the future of mining in these areas must be considered alongside
phenomena such as the thawing of permafrost, which, ironically, can be
exploited for a new version of Anthropocene tourism in the Pleistocene
Mammoth Park in the Yamal region, Siberia (Wrigley, 2020). In the North
American Arctic and subarctic, gold rushes to Canada's Yukon territory
and the Alaskan territory acquired by the United States in 1867 were
catalytic events, bringing non-Indigenous migrants and settlers, and
leading to further industrial transformations of the vast, hitherto
Indigenous-controlled region. Unlike the diverse economies and
settlements that emerged in the Scandinavian Arctic, however[, [the
region's]{.mark} transportation and settlement [geography centered
on]{.mark} small-scale, remote, and often ephemeral and [unstable
extractive sites]{.mark}]{.underline} [(]{.mark}Keeling & Sandlos,
2015). [Similarly, Greenlandic mining remained a highly sporadic, yet at
times influential, driver of colonial extractive activity. Mining
settlements were founded around cryolite and coal deposits, promising
the potential for re-orienting the hunting-based Greenlandic economy
toward industrialism]{.underline} (and, for some Greenlanders, a path to
self-determination). Nevertheless, unlike other Arctic regions during
the twentieth century, Greenland remained largely at the margins of
sustained mining activities due to the transportation and environmental
challenges of its Arctic location, and because it was defined as a zone
of strategic interest dominated by the American military rather than as
a commercial development (Doel, Harper, & Heymann, 2016). [For all their
diverse histories and material circumstances, the many mineral
developments around the circumpolar region collectively illustrate the
broad trends and processes of extractivism-- with an Arctic flavor.
[Consider the Black Angel Mine]{.mark}: situated near a former marble
quarry at Maarmorilik [in]{.mark} the Uummannaq district of
[Greenland]{.mark}'s north-central west coast]{.underline} (Figure 2.1),
[the remote site attracted interest [for]{.mark} its [lead-zinc
deposits]{.mark} during a boom in demand for these minerals in the
1960s]{.underline}. Through its Danish subsidiary Greenex, and with the
strong backing of the Danish government, the Canadian mining giant
Cominco brought Figure 2.1 Location map of Greenland. Drawn by Christian
Fohringer. its considerable experience in northern mining (including
contemporaneous efforts to develop a High Arctic mine near Resolute in
Canada) and sulphide ore processing technology to exploit this deposit.
The mine was accessed rather dramatically some 600 meters up the side of
a mountain via cable car, which also transported ore to a processing
facility by the Affarlikassa Fjord. When it opened in 1973, the mine
promised employment opportunities for Greenlanders, although most
workers were employed on a fly-in-fly-out basis, and local Indigenous
labor participation remained low. In fact, Greenlandic workers went on
strike in 1977, protesting against unequal wages and the strict social
controls of the company mining camp (Knudsen et al., 2022). [[The
mine]{.mark} also [proved controversial]{.mark} for its impacts on local
environments and livelihoods: along with [enduring smoke and
dust]{.mark} from the refinery, hunters in the area blockaded an ore
ship in 1975 to protest the impact of spring icebreaking on sea ice
travel. It left a legacy of [water pollution]{.mark} resulting from the
disposal of tailings into the fjord, [contaminating]{.mark} nearby
waters and [marine organisms]{.mark}, including harvestable fish, with
lead and zinc for decades after the mine's closure in 1990]{.underline}
(Eberling et al., 2002). As with so many remote Arctic sites[, [while
the economic benefits of mining]{.mark} (and its associated
infrastructure) [proved]{.mark} ultimately 43
[fleeting]{.mark}]{.underline}, [its effects on society and environment
reverberated for long after closure]{.underline}. In particular, in
spite of its short life the mine nurtured the vision of increasing
self-determination by Greenlanders, a vision that has persisted in
debates around uranium mining and offshore oil development (discussed
later; Bjørst, Sejersen & Thisted 2023, see Chapter 7). Of course, the
Black Angel story is not that of every Arctic mine. Some mining regions
flourished for decades, either from new mineral opportunities or
diversified economies. Much of Arctic Fennoscandia, while embracing the
industry, in fact relies very little on it for employment while
benefiting from the associated investment and infrastructure, a legacy
of an earlier commitment to populate mining regions and build functional
communities (Malmgren et al., 2023, see Chapter 11). Towns and cities in
North America with their origins in mining booms-- Yellowknife,
Whitehorse, and Juneau, for instance-- have matured into administrative
centers while continuing their role as transportation and service hubs
for extractive industries (Piper, 2009). While the Arctic remains, in a
global context, a resource periphery or "primary commodity supply zone,"
new economic and political arrangements, most notably the growing
influence of Arctic Indigenous peoples, have shifted the balance toward
the capture and retention of mining's benefits by the region's
population. Nevertheless, [the "[landscape scars]{.mark}" (Storm, 2014)
of previous rounds of largely settler-colonial forms of extractivism
remain, [along with "imperial debris]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Stoler,
2013) [in a lingering volumetric and vertical environment]{.underline}
(Dodds, 2021). [They [are]{.mark} frequently [invoked in the]{.mark}
[disputes over modern]{.mark} open pit "[mega-mines]{.mark}" [and power
infrastructures]{.mark} that disrupt surface-level reindeer
herding]{.underline} (Röver, 2021) [and other traditional lifestyles,
the impact of Arctic ore shipping disrupting the solidity of sea ice, or
contemporary efforts to address the toxic subterranean legacies of
abandoned and un-reclaimed mine sites around the region. The toxic
experiences and lessons of this extractive past are frequently invoked
as Arctic communities today continue to debate the merits and pitfalls
of minerals-led development for their region]{.underline} (Nuttall,
2017; Dale, Bay-Larsen, & Skorstad, 2018)

[For indigenous survivors]{.underline} who are withstanding coloniality
on stolen lands, [**[adapting]{.mark}** to climate change **[is nothing
new]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [**[Colonial]{.mark}** induced
**[environmental change forced indigenous people]{.mark}**]{.underline}
from their homes [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} the point of
**[[extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Now the same cycle]{.underline}
surrounding relocation and displacement [is forcing
indigenous]{.underline} [people to adapt]{.underline} to environmental
changes in ways that [reifies the hauntings of settler
colonialism]{.underline} (see Ramirez in Naylor et al., 2018). Moreover,
the [colonial practices]{.underline} that are producing environmental
harms are also [responsible for making adaptation difficult
for]{.underline} [indigenous people]{.underline} living in settler
realities (Whyte, 2016b, 2017).

Climate change [adaptation measures are likely to fail if]{.underline}
[adaptation means coping with]{.underline} and adjusting to [colonial
violence]{.underline} and systemic oppression in a climate changed world
(Chakraborty & Sherpa, 2021). Non-indigenous and [settler societies
perceive climate change as an]{.underline} [external threat]{.underline}
that will create a dystopian future. [Whereas indigenous societies
believe that their vulnerability to climate change is an
"intensification of colonially induced environmental
change"]{.underline} (Whyte, 2017, p. 154). Whyte argues that
[**[indigenous people already live in a dystopian climate future where
their]{.mark}** native land, **[environment]{.mark}**,
culture,]{.underline} **[[language, and identity is repeatedly
stolen]{.underline}]{.mark}** [by]{.underline} the
[colonizers]{.underline} (ibid: 160).

Climate coloniality becomes invisible through universalizing discourses
such as *anthropocentric* climate change, and the Anthropocene, which
gained traction through the erasure of the history of global warming
created and continued by extractive colonialism and industrialization at
the hands of (largely) the United States and Western Europe (McEwan,
2021). The [Anthropocene discourse implies that all humans share
responsibility for human induced climate change]{.underline}, and
experience an even distribution of the impacts of industrial capitalism
and imperial/colonial relations (Schulz, 2017 in Whyte, 2017). For
indigenous people, [the Anthropocene]{.underline} is rooted in
colonialism because it [erases colonial violence to nature
and]{.underline} disregards or [divides human-non-human ecological
relationships from]{.underline} [the perspective of
settlers]{.underline} and imperial colonizers (Mitchell, 2015 in Whyte,
2017

**[[Adaptation]{.underline}]{.mark}** to climate change
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} thus **[[rendered a problem for global
humanity]{.underline}]{.mark}** as a whole, homogenizing place-based
contexts and relying on supranational structures to effect adaptation
and mitigation measures. [[The **global
periphery**]{.underline}]{.mark}, despite having many differences and
complex histories, [[is **rendered as a homogenizing unit to be dealt
with**]{.mark} cookie cutter technocratic adaptation
solutions]{.underline}. [[Such]{.underline}]{.mark} technocratic climate
[[solutions create]{.mark} **[sacrifice zones]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
so-called "vulnerable populations" and reproduce neocolonial relations
[that]{.underline} often [make people more vulnerable to political
ecological marginalization]{.underline} (Paprocki, 2021; Zografos &
Robbins, 2020). The [urgency]{.underline} of the climate crisis posed by
the IPCC, [makes little attempt to address the neocolonial structures
embedded in the]{.underline} climate [crisis]{.underline}.
[However]{.underline}, the "**[[crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
[[**narrative** results in those with the **most power**]{.mark} [being
**able to** **ignore climate injustice**]{.mark}]{.underline} (through
the universalizing "anthro" and homogenization of place) [**[and

land **[dispossession]{.mark}**, cultural appropriation, and theft of
indigenous ways of knowing]{.underline} and being **[[in the name of

The [coloniality of adaptation narratives is also visible
in]{.underline} [Eurocentric disaster planning]{.underline} and
practices. For example, by examining the structural faults that fail to
link Puerto Rico\'s colonial past with disaster planning, Rivera
(2022) theorized "[disaster colonialism]{.underline}" that
[deepens]{.underline} "[coloniality of being]{.underline}". Rivera
(2022) turns our attention to the "procedural vulnerability" that gets

normalcy]{.underline}**" **[without dealing with]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[the]{.underline} [**[colonial]{.mark}** past and social inequalities
that produced]{.underline} "**[[vulnerability]{.underline}]{.mark}**" in
the first place (ibid). Rivera also argues that "[disaster
colonialism]{.underline}" [is used]{.underline} as a colonizing tool
[to]{.underline} produce indigenous people as the "vulnerable other" and
[normalize spatial dispossession]{.underline} that would not be possible
if the "disaster" had not occurred.

Expanding on the argument stated by Rivera (2022), we add that [colonial
adaptation narratives create]{.underline} "[vulnerable
others]{.underline}" [who need to be provided with]{.underline}
[technical measures to become "resilient"]{.underline} to climate
change. A climate coloniality perspective shows how these "[vulnerable
others" are made and reified through]{.underline} white saviorism; and
in the settler colonial context, '[settler saviorism]{.underline}.'
Thus, experts are employed to render complex human-environment relations
into simpler problems that can be managed and fixed. [While indigenous
people see adapting]{.underline} to climate change [through more than
10,000 years of co-living]{.underline} in native lands, [settlers see
adaptation as managing lands]{.underline} and environments [to
stabilize]{.underline} capitalist [extraction]{.underline}. As a result,
**[adaptation solutions are by design enacted to fail]{.underline}**.

These simplistic **[[adaptation narratives are not just static projects,
they produce discursive frameworks by which we view and act upon the
world]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Taylor, 2015). [Enacting colonial climate
adaptation narratives]{.underline} thus [becomes a political process
that serves to]{.underline} [normalize a human-environment dichotomy
and]{.underline} in the process [invisibilize]{.underline} the [ongoing
colonial violence]{.underline} that takes place on stolen lands.

Recently, the Arctic began to be treated as a "geopolitical hotspot" and
as a "resource frontier." The region's international (i.e., interstate)
dynamics has been drawing the attention of [[scholars and policymakers
seeking to make sense]{.underline}]{.mark} (and take advantage)
[[of]{.mark} emerging **geopolitical and economic phenomena** in
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} region. One of the main drivers of such
efforts is the so-called [**[Arctic]{.mark} resource boom**]{.underline}
-- an enhanced knowledge on the resource endowment of Arctic seas and
lands, especially in terms of the presence of hydrocarbon and mineral
reserves. Since the publication of the Circum-Arctic Resource
Appraisal in 2008, such knowledge of the region has only increased, and
[[triggered]{.mark} a plethora of **economic [development
projects]{.mark}** for the region -- most geared towards [making]{.mark}
the **commercial [exploitation]{.mark}** of such resources
[viable]{.mark}. Such plans, typical of **neo-extractivist** modes of
**development** and **capital accumulation**]{.underline},1) [demand new
instruments and **technologies of control** over land, territory and
resources]{.underline} -- not only [in enabling the resource
exploitation]{.underline}, but [also in **displacing Arctic Indigenous
populations** that inhabit spaces where resource-based economic activity
is meant to take place.]{.underline} This process has been coupled with
a range of practices aimed at controlling space and mobilities in
indigenous lands -- what DuPlessis calls "striation activities". 2)

Theorizations and [[debates on the Arctic]{.mark} resource boom or on
the geopolitical tensions rising in the region [are]{.mark} generally
[**oblivious** to indigenous political projects]{.mark}, institutions
and articulations in the region.]{.underline} [This erasure]{.underline}
takes the colonial violence underlying the relation between Arctic
States and Arctic indigenous peoples out of sight, [[obscuring]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} violent [**history of expropriation** underpinning]{.mark}
contemporary [Arctic geopolitics]{.mark} and economic
development.]{.underline} Another effect of such perspectives is [the
presentation of [the Arctic as]{.mark} an "**[empty]{.mark}**" space,
devoid of people, social dynamics and politics [other than]{.mark} those
developed and brought by **[Westphalian
States]{.mark}**]{.underline}.3) [This position seeks to
**[justify]{.mark} State [interventions]{.mark}** in the region
[for]{.mark} "[properly]{.mark}" [seizing]{.mark} emerging economic and
strategic [opportunities]{.mark}]{.underline} -- with little to no
regard for indigenous cultures and subsistence in the Arctic, nor to the
already sensible effects of climate change in the region.

The present article seeks to frame [[the "**Arctic resource
boom**]{.mark}" as [a **new wave** of Arctic settler
colonialism]{.mark}.]{.underline} We argue that, [although
[projects]{.mark} for resource exploitation of the Arctic are achieving
unprecedented scale, they [represent]{.mark} a **[continuity]{.mark} of
the colonial project**]{.underline}, benefitting from the way previous
waves of colonization have shaped and reshaped Arctic spaces and the
relations between Indigenous peoples and their traditional territories.
Our discussion is focused on the impacts of colonialism over the
Beringian portion of Inuit Nunaat -- the Inuit homeland -- and the
impacts of colonialism over the relation between State, indigenous
peoples and Arctic spaces. Then we move on to a discussion of the Arctic
resource boom and the strategic and development projects emerging in the
Arctic policies of littoral states and their treatment of indigenous
issues amid economic and strategic pressures to carve out new extractive
enclaves in Arctic territories.

We depart from a historical account of Arctic colonialism, seeking to
understand how [[the]{.mark} colonial [encounter between Inuit
and]{.mark} Euro-[American]{.mark} population[s]{.mark} and the
importance of resource extraction **[shaped]{.mark} contemporary [Arctic
spaces]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- from baleen and whale oil to the gold
rush and discovery of hydrocarbons. One important element here is to
understand how this [first moment of [colonialism **set up the
conditions** for]{.mark} modern-day resource [development]{.mark}
projects.]{.underline} The discussion, then, turns to [contemporary
economic development projects in the Arctic, understanding them as
**neo-extractivist** enterprises]{.underline} -- i.e., [enterprises that
rely heavily on **resource development** and control over space in a
late capitalist globalized economy.]{.underline} As such, [these
projects represent a **geographical [expansion]{.mark}** [of extractive
frontiers]{.mark} in a global scale, [seeking]{.mark} new [resource
reserves]{.mark} and [to]{.mark} reshape space to [make]{.mark} them
**[commercial]{.mark}ly viable**. This [represent]{.mark}s [a **new wave
of colonialism**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- i.e., [of attempts by state and
capital [to **enhance control** over]{.mark} traditional [indigenous
territories]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [and a new wave of threats and
attempts at **[dispossessing]{.mark} Arctic Indigenous Peoples** from
[their rights]{.mark} to their traditional lands and
livelihoods.]{.underline}

There are two different ways to look at a word. One is to analyze the
word in the same way we examine an object; the other is to [engage in a
**[conversation with the word]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The first
approach is reifying because the word is turned into a word-thing and
its understanding is **separated from the power** of the word
[to]{.mark} [confer **meaning**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The second is a
[**[dialogic penetration]{.mark}** [into]{.mark} the word]{.underline} -
a [**conversation** that opens up **fresh aspects** of [the
word]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bakhtin 1981). In this paper, I engage in a
conversation with one of the most powerful words in the world today:
**[[development]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [The power of the word
[stems]{.mark} [from]{.mark} its capacity to **designate** when and
under what conditions a country is considered to be
**developed**]{.underline}. Economic indicators,
[**[industrialization]{.mark}** [and **Western
values**]{.mark}]{.underline} have [taken precedence [over]{.mark}
**[quality of life]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the environment or
non-Western views [[as a measure of]{.mark} **progress**]{.underline}.
The [**[enchantment]{.mark}** with development]{.underline} would be
difficult to understand [[without the]{.mark} [promise]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} [a]{.mark} **[better future]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} an
**ideal of [progress]{.mark}**]{.underline}. If pronounced by
international institutions like the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development (OECD) or the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP), the power of the word development increases to the point
that scattered dreams become regulatory transactions, programs of
action, and statutory conditions, often [dictated by those claiming to
own it]{.underline}. In developing countries, development plans, made
official in the 1950s, have since mediated a precarious contractual
relationship between elected officials and their citizens. Development
is not only a weapon of the strong but also of the weak. As Frederick
Cooper documents in the African context, [development,
[conceived]{.mark} [to]{.mark} **[reinvigorate
colonialism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, was central to elites\' giving up
colonies since it could be administered by Africans as well as Europeans
(Cooper 1997). Latin American elites struggled to handle issues of
development and industrialization outside the influence of the United
States and the Soviet Union. In 1848, they asked the United Nations to
create the Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA), which became a
key player in [articulating alternative views of
development]{.underline} (Sikkink 1991). Moreover, the notion of
development put forward by ECLA transformed the diagnostic of the
[causes of **underdevelopment** [from racialistic explanations
into]{.mark} a [state-led]{.mark} [social]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
**[economic]{.mark} agenda**]{.underline} (Ortiz 2000). Women
articulated their [[struggles]{.mark} [for]{.mark} **[equality]{.mark}**
around the word development]{.underline}. Scholars like Esther Boserup
(1970) pioneered the recognition of women in development strategies.
This recognition was initially denominated by Women in Development
(WID). The aim was to integrate women into male power structures
(Parpart 1995). Criticisms of this approach led to the Women and
Development approach, which called for women-only projects designed to
avoid male domination. A shift to a Gender and Development (GAD)
perspective placed the focus on transforming gender roles and the power
of sustaining gender hierarchies. Women\'s claims were institutionalized
in bilateral assistance programs worldwide and institutionalized in
practices like the United Nation\'s Decade on Women and the program of
action agreed to in Beijing in 1995. By conversing with the word
development, I expect to reveal the secrets of its power and to
contribute to an understanding of why development has captured the
desires of both the powerful and the weak for more than a century.
Engaging in a dialogue with this word is a difficult endeavour, partly
because its meaning has changed historically and partly because the
speaking subjects use the word to convey different meanings. Before
addressing the question of what\'s in the word development, I will trace
its genealogy.

#### The U.S. uses narratives of Arctic harshness to justify domain awareness---surveillance disguised as safety that reinforces control over Indigenous populations.

Perhaps the clearest and most prevalent way that the Arctic wilderness
is described throughout these documents is through a harsh and
unwelcoming lens. Th[e word '[harsh']{.mark} is [used 37 times across
the policies]{.mark}: six times in 2013; four times in 2016; 11 times in
2019; two times in 2020; and 14 times in 2021.]{.underline} This
harshness is often prefaced in opposition to the need for the United
States to gain domain awareness, an approach for understanding security
challenges by stressing full awareness.Footnote32 Earlier documents in
2016 and 2013 stress the harshness of the Arctic wilderness both in
reference to infrastructure development and sustaining forces in the
region.

With the increase in military-focused policies in 2019--2021, the Arctic
is often described as (p. 39) "[[unpredictable]{.mark} [and
harsh]{.mark} as [in]{.mark} the 2019 Coast Guard Strategic Outlook, (p.
4) 'characterized by harsh conditions' as in the 2019
[D]{.mark}epartment [o]{.mark}f [D]{.mark}efence Arctic Strategy, and
the environment is even described as (p. 5--6) ' ... the greatest
adversary to Arctic Operations']{.underline} as in the 2020 Air Force
Arctic Strategy. These [[characterisations]{.mark} of the region suggest
that this harshness makes communication difficult, that there is not as
much maritime and road infrastructure and that variations in weather
makes defence capabilities difficult.]{.underline} This lack of
predictability with (p. 5) 'extreme temperatures, long periods of
darkness and extended daylight, high-latitudes, seasonal challenging and
changing terrain, and rapidly changing weather patterns' makes gaining
domain awareness difficult[. All Arctic policies from 2019 to 2021
[stress the importance of domain awareness]{.mark} and the difficulty of
obtaining it in the Arctic.]{.underline} Not only is the Arctic harsh in
its climate and difficult to gain awareness about, according to the 2019
Coast Guard Strategic Outlook, but it also poses risks to (p. 6)
'agencies charged with providing maritime safety and security to all
Americans, including the hundreds of villages and thousands of seasonal
workers in the US Arctic.' [Much of this recent focus on domain
awareness comes]{.underline} back to recent developments in power
competition in the region -- which has increased [the United States'
focus on this element of its Arctic behaviour both in its imagination
and experience.]{.underline} For example, in the build-up to NATO's 2018
Exercise Trident Juncture, the American Navy faced significant
difficulties -- leading to changes in how the Department of Defence
began to reframe Arctic policy.Footnote33 The adoption of harsh and
unwelcome language has two implications. First[, it falls back on the
comfortable myth of pure wilderness, that the harshness is a feature,
not a bug, in how the Arctic wilderness operates. Second, it
[reinforces]{.mark} [hierarchical thinking]{.mark} in how the region is
conceived. [If]{.mark} the [region]{.mark} [is]{.mark} framed as
[harsh]{.mark} and unwelcoming, [what]{.mark} then [of]{.mark} the
[Indigenous]{.mark} [People]{.mark} [that]{.mark} [live]{.mark}
[there]{.mark} and exist in that climate?]{.underline} By treating the
wilderness here as harsh, that metaphor is extended to what exists in
that wilderness -- namely people in opposition to a more welcoming
colonial south[. Further, by consistently conceiving the wilderness as
harsh and unwelcoming, it makes alternative policies that may reframe
the region in a different way difficult if not impossible -- limiting
the universe of possible approaches to Arctic policy.]{.underline}

Evolution of the Energy Sector

Generally, there are three ways Indigenous communities have interacted
with the energy sector within the Arctic states of Canada and Norway:
through [traditional **oil and gas production**]{.underline}, through
renewable resource developments, like hydro or wind power, and through
the extraction of minerals and resources needed to develop the energy
sector, such as copper mining. There [has been extensive]{.underline}
research done in the first area, as [**resistance** to oil and gas
extraction has been **well documented** for years, especially within
North America]{.underline}.2) Persistence of [state [governments]{.mark}
in [pursuing energy]{.mark} projects [that harm]{.mark} or **pollute
[Indigenous land]{.mark}s** exemplifies the [perpetuat]{.mark}ion of
[colonialism]{.mark} and colonial violence]{.underline}. While these
government actions are not direct forms of physical violence against
human bodies, [the **[indirect]{.mark} forms** are still
[impact]{.mark}ful for [Indigenous communities]{.mark}
today.]{.underline}3) In [2020, there were [protests against]{.mark} the
**[Coastal GasLink Pipeline]{.mark}** in Western Canada, a project
planning to cut through 190 kilometers of the Wetʼsuwetʼen First
Nation]{.underline}. Although environmental and Indigenous consultations
took place, Wetʼsuwetʼen [[chiefs **never gave approval**]{.mark} for
the land to be used, [inciting protests]{.mark} across the
country]{.underline}.

[The [rhetoric]{.mark} surrounding these protests often **[criticized
Indigenous perspectives]{.mark}**, with the media [labeling]{.mark}
anti-pipeline [activism as]{.mark} an act of "**[domestic
terrorism]{.mark}**."]{.underline}4) The [[framing]{.mark} of
[Indigenous resistance]{.mark} to energy developments [as a
**threat**]{.mark} **to the country** [fosters colonial
discourse]{.mark} and may [result in]{.mark} more oppressive controls
such as **[surveillance and]{.mark} excessive
[policing]{.mark}**]{.underline}.5) In the Wetʼsuwetʼen case, [police
and military forces were prepared to use **['lethal force']{.mark}**
against protestors]{.underline} and were authorized to employ 'as much
violence toward the gate as you want' to remove a roadblock protestors
built to obstruct access to Wetʼsuwetʼen land.6) [Dog raids and assault
weapons were used]{.underline}, resulting in the arrest of 74
protestors. Subsequent reports have revealed that [the treatment of
protestors [was **unlawful** and]{.mark} the [tactics]{.mark} employed
[were **'disproportionate'**]{.mark} to the level of
threat]{.underline}, as there were no reports of protestors resorting to
violence.7)

### Link---Exploration (Concept)---1NC/2NC

#### Framing the Arctic as an unknown frontier allows settlers to justify economic exploitation in the name of security, while the resulting wealth remains excluded from Indigenous communities.

narratives of wilderness in US Arctic policy. The Polar Journal, 12(2),

Coloniality exhibits itself in many narratives -- but is particularly
visible in [[framing the wilderness]{.underline}]{.mark} [[as]{.mark} a
place for extractive and [economic opportunity]{.mark} evokes ideas of
ecological imperialism.]{.underline}Footnote38 Taming the wilderness, or
in other words changing what is 'unusable' into 'usable' resources to be
extracted, is colonial in nature. However, [rather than traditional
colonial practices of extracting and leaving the region, the settler
colonial aspect -- remaining in the region for the long term and
settling -- is omnipresent in how the United States thinks about its
Arctic engagement. This has implications for how the United States will
treat areas like the [A]{.mark}rctic [N]{.mark}ational [W]{.mark}ildlife
[R]{.mark}efuge, and the extent to which the United States will
[honour]{.mark} [agreements]{.mark} [considering]{.mark} environmental
protection and conservation in]{.underline} [the face of potential
[economic]{.mark} [gains]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is important here to
note, while these implications stand, historically there is little to no
demonstration of economic opportunities such as the ANWR being acted
upon. In fact, there is a long history of Congress's failure to approve
economic development in the [ANWR and approval is quite
recent.]{.underline} Here, perhaps it may be interesting to point to
other factors explaining this lack of demonstration of economic
opportunities such as the persistent role of environmental activism.

Another example of this coloniality comes from considering the idea of
the Arctic diminishing and its relation to coloniality, importantly
focusing on the disavowal of settler guilt and blame and the myth of
pure wilderness.Footnote39 Again, this has consequences for American
Arctic policy[. When [blame]{.mark} is [removed]{.mark} from the
settler, for example, particularly as it relates to [climate]{.mark}
change, the Arctic region becomes more open to extraction]{.underline}.
In the 21st century, this [translates to [opportunities to
extract]{.mark} critical minerals, oil and gas for energy security
purposes, and fish. Treating the [wilderness]{.mark} as [harsh]{.mark}
and unwelcoming similarly has colonial implications and consequences for
how the United States formulates policy and acts in the
Arctic]{.underline}. The idea of harshness falls back on the myth of
pure wilderness as above and extends the idea of harshness and savagery
to the Indigenous People that live there. [Both people and land are
treated as an '[Other']{.mark} that is inherently created in [opposition
to the land]{.mark} and people of the coloniser society.
Consider]{.underline} the fact [that [food insecurity]{.mark} [rarely
comes up]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [American]{.mark} [security]{.mark}
[documents,]{.mark} [despite]{.mark} being a security [reality]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} many [Indigenous]{.mark} People in Alaska.]{.underline}
These [[narratives]{.mark} weave in and out of American [Arctic
policy]{.mark} documents, coming back to the idea that in the context of
the United States, the wilderness has no concrete definition. Instead,
it operates as a window for scholars to better understand how the
concept of the wilderness is instrumentalized by the state.]{.underline}

Early uses of the word ["**[exploration]{.mark}**" in English can be
[traced]{.mark} back [to]{.mark} the **[15th century]{.mark}** and
[meant to]{.mark} [search something out]{.mark} or investigate it
thoroughly]{.underline}.7 In this way [exploration [establishes]{.mark}
a [relationship]{.mark} [between]{.mark} something which is not known
(or **[unknown]{.mark}**) [and]{.mark} the [process]{.mark} [by which it
is made known]{.mark}]{.underline}. It would only be in the early 20th
century, however, that exploration would begin to [solidify as a
[subject]{.mark} [of **academic study**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Scholarly
interest in the subject would wax and wane as the triumphalist
biographies of European explorers fell out of fashion as empires were
dismantled in the wake of World War II. While popular accounts would
continue to be written by journalists and authors, the academic study of
exploration would be more or less moribund until the 1970s when,
reinvigorated by a broader push for representation in the humanities
pioneered by literary theorists such Edward Said, Paul Carter, and Mary
Louise Pratt, it would cease to be an "academic backwater."8 Drawing on
these insights scholars would promote a [**[critical postcolonial
perspective]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} [reframed]{.mark} the study of
[exploration]{.mark} [through]{.mark} the various lenses of
**[race]{.mark}**, gender, [and]{.mark}
**[imperialism]{.mark}**]{.underline} more generally. This new
perspective led many to the conclusion that exploration was
irretrievably ensnared in the jaws of imperialism and that it was a
fundamentally exploitative venture. From this needed overcorrection,
scholars would later pull back from this totalising view of
explorationas-imperialism and come to instead focus on the
"[[**heterogeneous, contingent** and
**conflictual**]{.mark}]{.underline} 7 Oxford English Dictionary, 3rd ed
(2016), s.v. "[Exploration]{.underline}." 8 James R. Ryan and Simon
Naylor, "Exploration and the Twentieth Century," in New Spaces of
Exploration: Geographies of Discovery in the Twentieth Century (London:
Bloomsbury, 2009), 1. 6 character of imperial projects."9 Taken in its
entirety, [the scholarly literature on exploration can [appear
unwieldy]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [its many iterations]{.mark} that span
**disciplines** and **academic trends**. Such is its nature that some
historians have qualified the study of exploration [as an "**untamable
beast**]{.mark}]{.underline}."10 There have been many attempts to tame
the beast even so, and from them can be [distilled several different
broad approaches to the study of exploration]{.underline}.11 1.1.1
Exploration as human nature One potential approach suggests that, even
though there might be multiple overlapping factors at play in explaining
why states engage in exploration, there is nonetheless an [[innate
**human impulse** to discover the]{.mark} [unknown]{.mark} undergirding
it al]{.underline}l. As the ill-fated mountaineer George Mallory
famously wrote, "I suppose we go to Mount Everest, granted the
opportunity, because---in a word---we can\'t help it." This has
frequently found expression in art, from the enduring popularity of
travel writing and the wanderlust of German romanticism to sweeping
sub-genres of science fiction. Humans, if our artistic presence signals
anything, are often restless creatures inhabited by a [[fundamental
desire to find out what lies]{.mark} just [beyond the
horizon]{.mark}]{.underline}. Literary scholars and mythologists have
argued that this is a reoccurring theme in the stories that humans tell
to, and about, themselves. Looking at myths that featured travel from
around the world, for example, Joseph Campbell influentially argued that
the journeys of most heroes can be described by the structure of the
monomyth: [they leave home, they suffer, they gain insight, and they
ultimately **change the world**]{.underline}.12 More recently 9 Felix

have allowed for new perspectives on these questions. 13 Could there be
a genetic origin to humanity's propensity to explore? There are some
geneticists who believe this is possible. One such effort led by Svante
Pääbo hopes to compare the genetic makeup of Neanderthals which,
according to the archaeological record never succeeded in expanding past
any significant geographic obstacle, with those of the ancestors of
modern humans who had already managed to cover most of the world 45,000
years ago. Although he acknowledges that technology certainly plays a
role in exploration, especially in terms of crossing water, Pääbo argues
that there must be an additional factor---in an interview with a
journalist from the New Yorker he frequently referred to it as
"madness"---that possessed humans to venture out into the open ocean in
search of new lands.14 There are already some traits that are seen as
potential candidates. A study in 1999 found an association between
variation of dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) allele frequencies across the
globe with population migration patterns in prehistoric times.15 Since
then numerous studies have shown that a specific variant carried by
approximately 20% of humans, DRD4-7R, is associated with increased
risk-taking ranging from sexual opportunities to adventure. Even so,
many remain skeptical that the 7R variant is responsible. [Evolutionary
population geneticist Kenneth Kidd believes that to call it the
"**explorer's gene**" would be to overstate its]{.underline} 13 More
generally scientific pursuits, [at least [within]{.mark} [the **Western

importance and fly in the face of numerous studies which have found
contradictory results.16 While shying away from the notion of a single
gene being responsible, [others have examined the ways in which genes
play out in an **advancing migratory wave**---those at the **forefront**
of exploration]{.underline}. In a paper by Moreau et al. researchers
trace the population expansion of early Quebecois loggers along the
Saguenay and noted that those at the front of the wave had more children
earlier, giving them a disproportionate impact on the genetic makeup of
the population.17 This "gene surfing" could have occurred with other
migratory waves elsewhere in the world which could have helped select
for specific combinations that fed into exploratory behaviour.
Researchers found that cane toads on the leading edge of an [**expanding
migration frontier** in Australia had longer legs which enabled them to
travel further, for example.]{.underline} 18 Whether this remains a
significant factor within human populations remains controversial. It is
also unclear to what extent genealogical spread associated with conquest
and accompanying forms of sexual violence plays a role in such trends.
Research out of psychology suggests a variety of different ways in which
humans respond to unknowns. One strand of research suggests that some
humans are more psychologically prone to seeking out the unknown and
engaging in various forms of exploratory behaviour. Curiosity may
overcome aversion in certain situations, for example, which could hint
at a greater predisposition to taking risks in the face of the unknown
in certain individuals.19 This would seem to resonate 16 David Dobbs,

various theoretical strands emerging from elsewhere in the social
sciences that posit a predisposition towards wanting to render the
unknown knowable as a way of asserting control over it.20 On the other
hand, there is also evidence which suggests that the unknown is a
singularly disturbing concept to humans. A recent study noted that the
fear of the unknown, the uncertain, and the unfamiliar is an underlying
element of anxiety disorders and that "fear of the unknown may be a, or
possibly the, fundamental fear."21 This parallels recent currents in IR
theory which have suggested that anxiety offers an explanatory variable
distinct from fear-based explanations.22 Migration scholars have
interpreted this in a different way and have argued that the grasp that
the fear of the unknown has over humanity is such that "xenophobia could
be considered a basic human instinct."23 Contrary to the wanderlust
mentioned above, the unknown has manifest as an intense dread in the
arts as well. As H.P. Lovecraft once suggested: "the oldest and
strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind
of fear is fear of the unknown

When we consider [wilderness through the lens of settler
colonialism]{.underline}, it is important to first consider terminology.
Scholars define settler colonialism in differing but important ways.
While Eichler and Baumeister (Citation2021) suggest it is the commitment
of settlers to establish themselves permanently in the
periphery,Footnote15 Coulthard (Citation2014) argues that the
settler-colonial relationship is one characterised by domination, that
this relationship exists to facilitate the dispossession of Indigenous
People.Footnote16 Todd (Citation2017) proposes that settler colonialism
reproduces the ideologies, relationships, and physicality of colonialism
as ongoing.Footnote17 Other scholars note that settler colonialism is
also premised on the idea that land is transformed into private
property.Footnote18 [What these definitions have in common is that there
is some continued relationship between coloniser, colonised, and land
that uses naturalised social and political hierarchies.]{.underline}
This leads into thinking about [[coloniality]{.underline}]{.mark}, which
is key for the purpose of this article. Coloniality, simply put,
[[is]{.mark} [what]{.mark} [survives]{.mark}
[colonialism]{.mark}]{.underline}.Footnote19 According to
Maldonado-Torres (Citation2007, 243), '[Coloniality, instead, refers to
[long-standing patterns of power]{.mark} that emerged [as a
result]{.mark} of colonialism]{.underline} ... it is maintained alive in
books, in the criteria for academic performance, in cultural patterns,
in common sense, in the self-image of peoples, in aspirations of self,
and so many other aspects of our modern experience.'Footnote20 If
coloniality is what exists today that is [inherited from past colonial
practices]{.underline}, then we can assume that these hierarchies are
present in relations between and within states, as well as in policy,
knowledge production, and across how states handle creating policy in
the Arctic.

While the argument that coloniality is alive and well today is
thoroughly addressed in the post-colonial, decolonial, and Indigenous
literature, [ontological security studies ([OSS]{.mark}]{.underline})
adds a new dimension to the discussion. OSS has not traditionally
addressed the continuation of colonial legacies as a key part of state
autobiographical narratives. However, what OSS highlights is how one of
the [[mechanisms]{.mark} through which [coloniality]{.mark} is
continued]{.underline} is through the selective activation and
deactivation of certain narratives.

Ra[ther than focus on an actor's need for physical security,
[ontological security]{.mark} brings attention to security [as]{.mark}
being.]{.underline} In other words, ontological security refers to an
actor's need for a [secure [identity]{.mark} that contains a sense of
biographical continuity and brings an emphasis to [what]{.mark} stories
and [narratives]{.mark} [we]{.mark} [tell]{.mark} [ourselves]{.mark}
[about]{.mark} [ourselves]{.mark}]{.underline}, [the
[relationship]{.mark} we have with others and the [land]{.mark}
[we]{.mark} [conquer]{.mark}, live on, or occupy.]{.underline} Adopting
this lens focuses attention on the relationship between [anxiety and
identity]{.underline}, and especially how autobiographical
[[narratives]{.mark} and routines [manage]{.mark} [existential
identity]{.mark} as a daily yet often [unconscious]{.mark}
process]{.underline}. In short, it leads us to ask how do [specific
narrative anchor state self-identity and implies that these narratives
have an impact on current stressors and problems.]{.underline}Footnote21
Thus, the [scholarship suggests that scholars should seek out routines,
particular narratives and how ideas are held constant over time to
mitigate anxiety.]{.underline} Anxiety, here, is the [ordering principle
of how states interact with the world and what they [must]{.mark} manage
to [feel secure]{.mark}. States can never solve anxiety, but they can
manage it through routines and narratives.]{.underline} OSS has been
used to study securitisation, moral injury, narration of state identity,
radicalisation, and many other questions of international
politics.Footnote22

[OSS is a useful narrative for answering the question of how the United
States [conceptualises]{.mark} the [wilderness]{.mark} [in]{.mark} its
[Arctic policy]{.mark}. This is because the type of narrative that the
United States uses is indicative of how it manages existential
anxiety]{.underline} and how that selection of narratives is chosen is
key to understanding what underlying principle drives American Arctic
policy. In other words, how does the [United States manage its
all-encompassing existential anxiety in the regional case of the Arctic
and what narratives are at play? Which narratives are chosen can tell us
something about those underlying anxieties? Wilderness narratives point
to coloniality. Further, OSS draws attention to biographical continuity
-- an idea that this research aims to flesh out by considering
continuity in American Arctic policy across different presidencies and
administrations.]{.underline}

OSS literature has not often addressed the role of coloniality in the
shaping of state autobiographical narratives. While some scholars have
noted that established hierarchies, identities, and relationships play
an important role in colonial biographical continuity, this is far from
the norm.Footnote23 Instead, literature has looked at the role of
colonial subjugation -- namely that the emotional trauma from
colonialisation has influence on how states react to anxiety.Footnote24
Thus, bringing in understandings of coloniality, particularly in how
wilderness is conceived of, in coloniser state identity is key for
advancing OSS. Importantly, OSS can also add to post-colonial,
decolonial, and Indigenous literature when considering the mechanisms
through which coloniality is sustained. OSS literature has discussed how
states selectively activate and deactivate parts of their
autobiographical narratives to fit new events and new anxieties into
their worldview.Footnote25 The [instrumental use of these narratives
adds nuance to the discussion of how places like the United States may
take different stances to the Arctic over time,]{.underline} but that
they all rely on coloniality to [reinforce power relations that place
the United States on top of social and political
hierarchies.]{.underline}

The Arctic region is home to 4 million people, including over one
million members of more than forty Indigenous groups (The Arctic
Council, 2015). Half of the population are reindeer herders, who have
their own cultures, languages, and lifeways (Bladow, 2019; Kuokkanen,
2023). [The [Arctic contains]{.mark} large territories with past and
present **[unequal]{.mark} global [relations]{.mark}** [that are
colonial]{.mark} in character. Several [Arctic]{.mark} regions have been
[turned into]{.mark} key **resource frontier [sites]{.mark}**
[for]{.mark} the extractive [**fossil fuel**, **metal**]{.mark} mining,
[**energy** and **forestry**]{.mark} economies]{.underline} supported by
key global North states, such as Norway, Sweden, the United States,
Canada, Finland, Denmark, and the Russian Federation (Bennett, 2016;
Keil, 2014). These Arctic extractivist frontiers have been resisted by
local peoples, often Indigenous (Hanaček et al., 2022; Nygren et al.,
2022). Resistance arises against fossil fuels, but there are also
movements opposing green or low-carbon energy projects (Lassila, 2018;
Össbo, 2023).

[The Arctic is [especially affected by]{.mark} the cascading impacts of
[the climate]{.mark} catastrophe, with its climate warming four times
faster in comparison to other regions]{.underline} (Herrmann, 2015;
IPCC, 2019). The climate crisis and its purported solutions currently
play an increasing role in shaping Arctic life. [[Climate change]{.mark}
is [creat]{.mark}ing [a **discourse**]{.mark} and actions [leading
to]{.mark} the expansion of **[green extractivism]{.mark}** across the
region.]{.underline} While risks are increasing, [the Arctic is
paradoxically [perceived]{.mark} by many domestic and transnational
companies [as a]{.mark} central [point for]{.mark} so-called new
**[green]{.mark} energy [solutions]{.mark}** [and **mining**]{.mark} of
**transition [minerals]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Duxbury, 2021; Hanaček et
al., 2022; Len, 2021). For example, western Greenland, [[where]{.mark}
coastal [glaciers]{.mark} have been [melt]{.mark}ing, [has been]{.mark}
a target of new **[mining ventures]{.mark}** seeking to offer minerals
for the electrification of energy]{.underline} (Gronholt-Pedersen,
2022). [While [the climate crisis has been caused]{.mark} mostly [by
**colonial actions** and **extractivist**]{.mark} **frontier
[expansion]{.mark}** by the elites and corporations of the core areas of
the capitalist world-ecology]{.underline} (Moore, 2016), [[the
Arctic]{.mark} suffers excessively, and [is]{.mark} furthermore cast as
[a \"**sacrifice zone**\" for **extracting minerals** and energy
for]{.mark} supposed [climate]{.mark} change
[solutions]{.mark}]{.underline} (Össbo, 2023). [[The crisis]{.mark} of
[the capitalist world]{.mark}-ecology, meaning a [rush to
**dwindling**]{.mark} **natural [resources]{.mark}**, is [fueling a
desire to **expand extractivist**]{.mark} **[activities in the
Arctic]{.mark}**, creating [a]{.mark} complex and perilous **[feedback
loop]{.mark}**, as Arctic extractivism can directly [drive]{.mark} the
breaching of global climate **[tipping points]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Kröger, 2023). For example, [[**flaring**]{.mark} and increased
atmospheric [**soot and dust** from mining cause **quicker melting** and
make ice sheets **less reflective**]{.mark}. An extractive push has
increased in some parts of the region alongside worsening socio-climatic
crises]{.underline} (Kröger, 2016a, 2018).

[[The Arctic remains a]{.mark} **prime [target]{.mark}** [for]{.mark}
extractivism, notably for [obtaining]{.mark} the [**commodities**
to]{.mark} [produce \"**green**\"]{.mark} or **low-carbon
[infrastructures]{.mark}** instrumental in climate change mitigation
policies]{.underline} (Kuokkanen, 2023). Moreover, the attack on Ukraine
by Russia in February 2022, and the subsequent rush for alternative
energy and raw material sources especially in the European Union, has
led to major new expansion pushes, also in the Arctic (Kopra & Wall,
2022). The sanctions against Russia, and the worsening
climatic-ecological conditions for extraction due to collapsing
permafrost for example, have brought difficulties for the sector in some
parts of Arctic Russia (Kröger, 2023). [Visible **[resource
conflicts]{.mark}** and **resistance movements** [are]{.mark} thus just
[the tip of the iceberg]{.mark} when it comes to local grievances due to
environmental, cultural, and livelihood losses experienced by many
Arctic peoples]{.underline} (Heininen et al., 2022). [This is a topic
that can be explored more deeply through the intertwined concepts of
**extractivism and colonialism**, which examine the **structural**,
**historical** level where extractivist hegemonies have been created
**for the Arctic**.]{.underline}

[Extractivism describes those activities that violently **remove or
extract** large quantities of **natural resources**, causing major
social and **ecological damage**]{.underline} (Acosta, 2011). The type,
character and degree of extractivism vary depending on the sector, style
of extraction, and context (Kröger, 2022). According to Gudynas (2021),
extractivisms -- in the plural, as there are many forms, [such as
**mining**, **fossil fuels**, commercial **agriculture** and
**forestry**]{.underline} -- entail breaking down existing local
economies and their ecological relationships, [with extracted [products
profit]{.mark}ing national or international **[business]{.mark}**
classes [or **governments**. Extractivisms]{.mark},
however]{.underline}, are not limited to biophysical overexploitation
and transformation of the environment (Acosta, 2011; Kröger et al.,
2021; Svampa, 2019). They [[are]{.mark} based on [**onto-epistemic
violence** against Indigenous ways of **relating to the**]{.mark}
**Mother [Earth]{.mark}**]{.underline} (de la Cadena & Blaser, 2018).
For example, [[replacing]{.mark} the latter [with **modernist
assumptions**]{.mark} and ideas [where nature is]{.mark} seen as
**[external and]{.mark} [available]{.mark}**, \"free\" of people or any
constraints [to **exploit and appropriate**]{.mark} in whatever manner,
as fast as wanted.]{.underline} Therefore, Durante et al. (2021: 20)
refer to extractivisms as \"a particular way of thinking and the
properties and practices organized towards the goal of maximizing
benefit through extraction, which brings in its wake violence and
destruction.\" Such forms of colonialism and extractivism, when part of
capitalism, do not only mean imposing domination from foreign countries
and corporations. Colonialism can also be imposed and continuously
sustained internally within a nation state (Casanova, 1965; Churchill &
LaDuke, 1992; Maldonado-Torres, 2016). Arctic extractivisms exist with
several forms of colonial relations (Hanaček et al., 2022).

The concept of [climate colonialism refers to how **[glacier]{.mark}s
[melt]{.mark}ing**, **[sea levels]{.mark} rising**, [and
**storms**]{.mark} negatively [affect those who]{.mark} have **[least
contributed]{.mark}** to the climate crisis]{.underline}, such as
Indigenous peoples, ethnic minorities, and the impoverished (Landrum &
Holland, 2020; Naykanchina, 2012). [Systems supporting colonialisms,
such as **patriarchy**, **racism**, **Eurocentrism**, and
**[extractivism]{.mark}** not only [contribute to]{.mark} such
[conditions]{.mark}, but [also]{.mark} further [impose]{.mark} their own
[climate]{.mark} change **perspectives and
[\"solutions\"]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Sheller, 2023). [Climate change
is in part a result of **colonial extractivism**, and a greater
discussion of this connection in the literature has long been
necessary]{.underline} (Bhambra & Newell, 2023; Moore, 2016). For
instance, [projected [**green solutions** and]{.mark} global [**climate
interventions** reproduce **extractive understandings**]{.mark} and
dominant discourses, including [viewing climate as]{.mark} merely [a
**biophysical problem**]{.mark} to be [remedied with
**tech**]{.mark}**nologies**, **[finance]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark} better
**economic [modelling]{.mark}**]{.underline} (DeBoom, 2022; Sultana,
2022). [[Apolitical approaches]{.mark}, with little to **no
acknowledgment** of global colonial histories, also include adaptation,
vulnerability, and mitigation strategies that continue to
**[displace]{.mark} historically impoverished [people]{.mark}s** [from
their land,]{.mark} [disrupting plural ways of life]{.mark} and
knowledge]{.underline} (Cameron, 2012). According to Gelderloos (2022)
and Osborne & Carlson (2023), industrial expansion and present forms of
pollution are intrinsically linked to the colonial state. The current
climate crisis is the result of a state-corporate nexus responsible for
atmospheric change. However, [[the]{.mark} mainstream crisis solution to
this nexus is based on a **[carbon reduction]{.mark}** 2030
[goal]{.mark}, which [is]{.mark} inherently [linked to]{.mark} existing
fossil fuel and **[green extractivist initiatives]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(ibid).

Put simply, [both [green extractivism]{.mark} and the climate crisis
[perpetuate]{.mark} **logics of [colonialism]{.mark}** [and imperialism
through]{.mark} negative socio-environmental impacts,
**[discursive]{.mark} (green) [ignorance]{.mark}**, climate crisis
denial, [and attempts to create]{.mark} domination and [hegemony by
**extractivist forces**]{.mark} -- all these actions **[further driving
the climate catastrophe]{.mark}**]{.underline} (DeBoom, 2022; Dunlap &
Riquito, 2023; Sultana, 2022; Voskoboynik & Andreucci, 2022). The term
[\"]{.underline}necrocene,\" or the new era of death and extinction on
Earth, refers to such denial and silencing of historical and present
struggles against socio-ecological breakdown (Batalla, 2020; Clark,
2021; Mbembe, 2019). Therefore, the poly-crisis including climatic
breakdowns should be seen primarily as a political state and a colonial
condition (Sheller, 2023). Combined, green extractivism and climate
crises form part of ongoing colonialities.

#### State-centered [proposals]{.underline} of Arctic [green growth]{.underline} and [nuclear leadership]{.underline} [cannot]{.underline} be detached from a logic of [necropolitics]{.underline} which culminates in settler "[Arctic Extractivism]{.underline}" that makes [possible]{.underline} the "[death-dealing assembleges]{.underline}" [against]{.underline} Indigenous life.

[Policymakers]{.underline}, mainly in the Global North, have been
[implementing]{.underline} [new **[green growth]{.mark}**
strategies]{.underline} or [Green New Deals]{.underline}. The [narrative
of sustainability and development]{.underline} behind these policies
[[relies on **ecological modernization ideology**]{.underline}]{.mark},
whose proponents do not question growth (Wilson, 2013). According to
them, these tactics promise more sustainable industrialization and
downscaling of critical emissions (Chuffart et al., 2021; Dunlap &
Riquito, 2023; Zografos, 2022; Zografos & Robbins, 2020). Such
strategies create opportunities for national and transnational companies
to develop so-called sustainable mining for transition minerals,
batterygrid-electrification complexes with major low carbon
infrastructural expansion, large scale hydroelectricity projects,
industrial wind power or large-scale solar power projects in the global
South and North (Avila, 2018; Dunlap & Laratte, 2022; Zografos, 2022).
However, these approaches focus on the addition of new sources of energy
and materials, rather than their full substitution. [Coal production
continues to increase]{.underline} (Roy & Schaffartzik, 2021; York &
Bell, 2019), not least in the Arctic (Savin et al., 2021). Even nuclear
energy and natural gas are seen as two of the solutions to meet net zero
targets on the decarbonization journey (IEA, 2022; Kemfert et al., 2022;
Namaganda et al., 2023). Nonetheless, [**[nuclear]{.mark}** or natural
gas-powered **[projects]{.mark}**]{.underline} also [face
**opposition**]{.underline} (Temper et al., 2020). The term \"[[green
extractivism]{.underline}]{.mark}\" is related conceptually not only to
studies (particularly after about 2015) that analyze conflicts around
so-called transition minerals for [electrification]{.underline} (Dunlap,
2017), but also to the critique of the so-called
[bioeconomy]{.underline} and conflicts and policies to replace fossil
fuels, dating back to the 2000s (Gudynas & Acosta, 2011). Flex crops
(such as sugar cane or palm oil) and \'flex trees\' led to increased
cultivation and extraction for agrofuels, feed, and fiber, facilitated
by land grabbing. These \"green\" plantation expansions perpetuated
social inequality and environmental destruction (Borras et al., 2016;
Dorn et al., 2022; Kröger, 2011, 2016b). We consider green extractivism
as a subset of extractivism, with those activities under the green
economy including more than the bioeconomy (Levidow, 2014). Hence, green
extractivism does not simply relate to forests and agriculture. The
current conversation about green extractivism and the climate crisis
focuses on windfarms, solar, battery complexes, and mining the metals
needed for all of these. Thus, extractivism manifests itself in many
forms and degrees, with diverse effects and consequences (Kröger, 2022a:
47). Green extractivism fuels capitalist expansion through so-called
sustainable development policies, with implications for international
and national legal and political frameworks. These policies jeopardize
social, ecological, and political realities, and create \"green
sacrifice zones\" in which certain lives exposed to contamination are
regarded as having less value than others (Mejia-Muñoz & Babidge, 2023;
Zografos, 2022). Green extractivism arises in the name of climate change
mitigation or green economic \'\'development\'\' (Dunlap & Riquito,
2023). Green extractivism is therefore a process, and in addition to
flex crops, may include bioplastics, carbon offsets (e.g. REDD+)
(Kröger, 2016b), transition mineral mining and related infrastructure
and transportation services (Brock & Dunlap, 2018; Bruna, 2022). The
term \"green\" added to extractivism has, however, typically little to
do with sustainability and solutions to the climate crisis (Zografos,
2022). Green extractivism often causes interrelated socio-environmental
pressures through [**[overexploit]{.mark}ation** of **[socioecological
territories]{.mark}**]{.underline}, including their [[**culture**,
**spirituality**]{.mark}, lifeways, food and customs, [and **social
relations**]{.mark}]{.underline} in Hanaček et al. Green and climate

Ecology Vol. 31, 2024 543 general (Andreucci & Zografos, 2022; Brock &
Dunlap, 2018; Jerez et al., 2021). Thus, extractive \"green\" processes
have typically [[**neocolonialist** characteristics]{.mark} [in]{.mark}
the **[Global]{.mark} [South]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Acosta, 2011;
Hughes et al., 2023; Jerez et al., 2021; Svampa, 2019). They also appear
within the immediate semi-peripheries of the Global North, such as the
Arctic (Hanaček et al., 2022). In biophysical terms, extractivist
economies depend on the extraction of energy and materials, and generate
waste (Georgescu-Roegen, 1971; Martinez-Alier, 2022). In social terms,
control, access, and use of natural resources, disproportionate toxic
pollution, and climate impacts are typically part of this process. There
are also [intersectional [processes]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
\"**[Othering]{.mark}**\", violence, and **death** brought about by the
creation and **[abuse of social divisions]{.mark}**, [along]{.mark} the
lines of gender, class, [race]{.mark}, sexual orientation, caste, and
**cultures**]{.underline} (Andreucci & Zografos, 2022; Batalla, 2020;
Pulido & De Lara, 2018; Tran & Hanaček, 2023). We identify such
processes in varieties of extractivism aiming to achieve a carbon-free
future, and to slow the climate emergency \"ticking clock\" (Bruna,
2022; Clark, 2021). Activists and academics have highlighted how
\"green\" opportunities are not a solution to this crisis, but rather a
continuation of extractivism. [Green extractivism, despite its name,
still [relies]{.mark} [on]{.mark} **[intense material
extraction]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Andreucci & Zografos, 2022; Dunlap,
2018, 2021; Jerez et al., 2021; Voskoboynik & Andreucci, 2022). [In
theory it promotes sustainable development and prosperity for all, but
in practice [turns into **intolerable levels** of]{.mark} [hardship for
**Indigenous Peoples**]{.mark}]{.underline}, fisher, and peasant
communities (Akbulut et al., 2019). In what follows, we argue that the
extension of green sacrifice zones, as well as the new consensus
surrounding the decarbonization path, can be seen as an expansion of
commodity and waste frontiers (Martinez-Alier, 2023), building on
historical patterns of [colonialism and extractivism]{.underline}. Del
Bene and colleagues (2018) argued that \"renewable\" energy hydropower
projects are associated with the oppression of those who oppose them
though protest, undermining diverse epistemologies and world views.
Meanwhile, industrial wind and solar power development projects shape
uneven land conflicts (Avila et al., 2022), occasionally involving
occupation and militarization of local territories and displacement of
populations. In some documented instances there have been assassinations
of activists (Dunlap, 2018; Dunlap & Fairhead, 2014; Fanari, 2021; Tran
& Hanaček, 2023). The mining of green transition minerals have also
brought environmental, social, and economic harms (Jerez et al., 2021;
Voskoboynik & Andreucci, 2022). Minerals and metals identified as
critical to the development of four key green energy
technologies---solar, wind, electric vehicles and energy storage---are
listed by Church and Crawford (2020). 2 They include aluminum, cadmium,
chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, lead, lithium, manganese, molybdenum,
nickel, rare earths, selenium, palladium, silicon, silver, zinc, etc.
Some are newer transition metals (Dunlap & Laratte, 2022). The rush for
rare earths includes various attempts to extract the minerals from the
ocean floor or submarine hydrothermal deposits (Glasby, 2002; Levin et
al., 2020). Smelters and tailings continue to expose local communities
to toxicity (Dunlap & Jakobsen, 2020). We find empirical evidence across
Latin America, South-East Asia, Eastern Europe, and the African
continent (Núñez et al., 2022; Siti et al., 2022; Sovacool et al., 2020;
Zografos, 2022). As the ice across the Arctic recedes,
infrastructure-related projects are on the rise (Hildyard & Sol, 2017).
For example, the Polar Silk Road, part of China\'s Belt and Road
Initiative, involves expanding local economic partnerships through
investments in major infrastructure, **[[nuclear powered
icebreakers]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and other extractive projects
[[along]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[Northern Sea
Route]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Tillman et al., 2018). 3 The start of the
war in Ukraine saw an increase in trade along the route (Silk Road
Briefing, 2023). This Northeast Passage across Russian Arctic waters is
currently usable only for a few months, and requires suitable vessels
due to floating ice (Kröger, 2023). In the next decade however, even a
\"low-carbon\" global climate model predicts warming and melting of the
ice (Kim et al., 2023). The route could reduce by 40% the distance
between Northwest-European ports and the Far East, compared to the Suez
Canal route (Kovalenko et al., 2018). There is also a railroad in the
planning stage to link southern Finland to the **[Arctic
Ocean]{.underline}**, passing through reindeer herding territories
(Junka-Aikio, 2023). But 2 See also Melcher (2024). 3 China has
announced the Belt and Road will involve [green low-carbon energy,
transport, and mining]{.underline} to \'\'make a positive contribution
to addressing climate change\'\' (China Dialogue, 2022). Hanaček et al.

features [shaping]{.mark} the [**socio-environmental** and **political
characteristics**]{.mark} of a place]{.underline} (Locher & Fressoz,
2012; Mercer & Simpson, 2023). The current climate crisis highlights the
importance of understanding colonialism (coloniality) and reacting to
the [undesirable situation that perpetuates it [through \"green\"
extractivism]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bhambra & Newell, 2023; Dorn et al.,
2022). A recent publication by Vela Almeida et al. (2023) indicates that
the European Green New Deal not only provides opportunities for greater
profit, but also buttresses the **[imperial power
structure]{.underline}**, leaving [[little space for anti-colonial
ecologies]{.underline}]{.mark}. Altogether, ongoing developments in the
Arctic region, such as gas, [[nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark}, wind,
hydropower and the new transition mineral rush in the wake of climate
change (Boersma & Losz, 2018; Össbo, 2023), as well as resistance to
such projects (Hanaček et al., 2022) illustrate [climate
[colonialities]{.mark} [and]{.mark} \"green\"
[extractivisms]{.mark}]{.underline}, from old to new (Gritsenko, 2018;
Sultana, 2022). Academics including geographers, journalists, activists,
Indigenous and non-Indigenous people, as well as Knowledge Keepers in
the Arctic, have increasingly agreed that climate change and the
low-carbon transition projects reproduce colonial attitudes. Such
attitudes also impose non-stop structural blindness about ontological,
epistemological, and axiological struggles on the ground (Cameron, 2012;
Lassila, 2020; Normann, 2021) The green shift is nothing more than a
continued extraction of resources \[\...\] The difference is that
resource utilization has been given a nice color, green; we call it
\'green colonization.\' We were first colonized by people from outside
our lands, then colonized by climate change itself, driven by people
from outside our lands, and are now being colonized a third time by
responses to climate change. (Gunn-Britt Retter, head of the Arctic &
Environment Unit, Sámi Council). Source: Arctic Today Newspaper (2021).
In this context, significant colonial dimensions of climate change in
the Arctic are massive expansion of the extractive, industrial, and
shipping sectors (Cameron, 2012), including those emerging from
\"green\" sustainable development promotions (Gritsenko, 2018; Len,
2021). Acknowledging not only colonial history and ongoing colonial
effects of such extractive projects but also resistances against
multiple imperial and colonial \'\'shades of green\'\'
(Carminero-Santangelo, 2014), are important for critical examination of
these interrelated dynamics. Huggan (2016) explains that colonial
aspects in the Arctic context continue through economic, geopolitical,
epistemic dominance by the nation states and transnational companies.
These aspects are incorporated into ideologies of modernization, green
development and progress that rely on Arctic resources. Colonialism,
thus, continues to shape debates and developments in the fast changing
Arctic today, as well as informing contested visions for its future
(Sörlin et al., 2022).

[In the Arctic, [extractivism]{.mark} is underlain by a particular
socio-cultural orientation toward the northern environ ment that
conceives it as a distant storehouse of resources and an extractive
frontier]{.underline}. [This perspective [has roots]{.mark}]{.underline}
(particularly in the European Arctic) [[in]{.underline}]{.mark} deeply
religious and cultural attitudes toward nature in addition to the
[incentives provided by the global [manifestations of European
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even as we are moving into an economy
that has already started de-coupling wealth and economic growth from the
use of traditional mineral and fossil-based resources, [resource
extraction in the Arctic is still caught in the extractivist paradigm
following long historical lines]{.underline} (McCannon, 2012; Josephson,
2014; Nuttall, 2017). [What we see in the Arctic is a pattern of
extractivism that keeps reinventing itself in new guises, adapting to
changing circumstances, and increasingly in tension]{.underline} with
multiple actors and with demands for less intrusive, genuinely
consultative, socially just, and more sustainable solutions. How and
when will this prevailing Arctic extractivism transform, if not
discontinue? Will new extractivist patterns emerge in industries such as
tourism, energy production, strategic minerals, and marine protein
farming, or are other development pathways possible? Changing
human--nature relationships requires rethinking historical, cultural,
and religious definitions of Man's superiority on Earth and the
perceived human "right" to its resources. In contrast to
"nature,""resources" is a redefinition of "natural things" into objects
that are somehow deemed more or less useful for humans, and which in the
capitalist era can be monetized. What these objects are and what their
valueis,eventhattheyconstitute"resources,"objectsofextraction,haschangedwith
time and will continue to do so (De Gregori, 1987; Bridge, 2009).
Already, the Early Modern revolution of natural philosophy has
legitimized the sense that Man's destiny is to dominate and exploit a
nature "out there," a mechanized nature in which humans had no part. Man
replaced God and put himself in a position beyond nature. This
represented no shift from the Judeo Christian tradition, however, as Man
was seen also in biblical times as being the steward of Creation, and
the benefactor of all goods that could be drawn from it (as in for
instance Genesis 2:19). The combination of the Christian anthropocentric
notion of the world, where Man is regarded as God's representative on
Earth, and the Athenian focus on the nature of Man and his ability to
make sense of the world constructed a reality where "Christianity
absorbed the anthropocentric dominance views of Platonic-Aristotelian
Greek philosophy" (Sessions, 1977: 486). This, in turn, helped pave the
way for the future rationalization of man's utilization of the resources
of the planet. Influential feminist thinkers (e.g., Merchant, 1980) have
argued that it would be reasonable to ascribe the subsequent
appropriation of the natural world to the premise that the observing and
acting human subject was firmly placed-- both epistemologically and
morally-- outside of nature. In a colonial frame of mind, "nature" thus
turned into objects of value ("resources")or "marvelous possessions"
(Greenblatt, 1991) that could be controlled, owned, and exploited. [The
[appropriation of the Arctic]{.mark} by representatives of this
Christian culture and mind frame stands in a long line of
confrontations, literally around the world, [with what colonialists
perceived as pristine]{.mark}, [untamed nature that could be
appropriated and mastered in new ways]{.mark}]{.underline}. Frontier
landscapes were the manifestation of God's gift to humankind, and the
solution to the ever-increasing needs of societies for natural bounty.
Men of Western science also played an important role as missionaries of
the Christian faith in conquering the North. As Andrew Stuhl has argued
about later incarnations of these colonizers in Alaska, " their concepts
and research practices have accompanied efforts to conquer, cajole,
civilize, capitalize, consume and conserve the far north since the late
1800s" (Stuhl, 2016: 2), and further back if we consider the European
Arctic. Extractivism, as an extension of Man's God-given right to
utilize the planet's resources, was deeply embedded in the rationale for
a push to the north, as an expression of the century-old endeavor to
"find the world's remaining unclaimed lands" (Stuhl, 2016: 3). More
recent and more secular ideas about land and resources followed that
underlay colonial extractivist philosophy in the broadest possible
traditions of political theory: Locke on labor, property, and the ethics
of resource appropriation; Marx on labor, transformation of nature, and
existential freedom. The ethical and philosophical foundations of
extractivism are found in the very core of [[Western ideas of
modernity]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the Arctic is no exception. Over
time, they [[coalesced into broad developmental narratives that became
embedded in extractivist thought]{.mark}, in the physical domination of
landscapes and its riches, and in the relations to the people who
inhabited it]{.underline} (Bridge, 2009; Richardson & Weszkalnys, 2014).
[These ideas [sharpened under]{.mark} [industrial colonialism]{.mark},
resting on an assumption of virtuous transformation of raw materials to
goods and societal value with little harm of any kind]{.underline}. The
unquestionable harm wrought on local communities was justified with
progressivist ideologies, articulated by several thinkers and, as
extraction grew, by theorists of resource-centered imperialism (Hobson,
1902) and ideas about "control of the tropics" (Kidd, 1898), which also
included "control of the Arctic." One of the key arguments in this
literature was that since Indigenous populations neither would nor could
exploit natural resources at this scale, it was both the right and a
duty of the "civilized peoples" to do so. Civilization, as articulated
by John A. Hobson, a progressive British economist and in fact a critic
of imperialism, was ultimately characterized by a supreme capacity to
extract and develop natural resources. [[According to]{.mark} this early
version of [the]{.mark} "[gospel of efficiency]{.mark}"]{.underline}
(Hays, 1959), [[wealth was going to spread across
society]{.underline}]{.mark}, [including, presumably, the far north,
[perceived by the most wishful visionaries as]{.mark} [the future
epitome of human civilization]{.mark}, [justifiying]{.mark} [continued
hopes]{.mark} [and projects to]{.mark} populate, promulgate, and
[excavate the Arctic in a noble]{.mark} "[northward course of
empire]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Stefansson, 1922). Impacts on nature and
on cultures, transforming both beyond recognition, were in the
extractivist ideology considered largely favorably. ["[Landscape
scars]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Storm, 2014) [[were the]{.mark} terraformed
[evidence of progress]{.mark} [in an extractivist version of the
"improvement of the world "idea]{.mark}]{.underline} that had been an
ultimate legitimizing imaginary to guide British imperialism since the
seventeenth century, long referring to agriculture and plantation
economics, but in the nineteenth century turning decisively industrial
and resource oriented (Gascoigne, 1998; Drayton, 2000). Similar ideas
were advanced in French colonial thought (Rosenblum, 1988)

Recently, [the [Arctic began to be treated as a]{.mark}]{.underline}
"geopolitical hotspot" and as a "[[resource
frontier]{.underline}]{.mark}." The region's international (i.e.,
interstate) dynamics has been drawing the attention of scholars and
[[policymakers seek]{.underline}]{.mark}ing [[to]{.underline}]{.mark}
make sense (and [[take advantage]{.underline}]{.mark})
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} [emerging geopolitical and]{.underline}
[economic phenomena in the region]{.underline}. [One of the main drivers
of such efforts is [the]{.mark} so-called [Arctic resource
boom]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [an enhanced knowledge on the resource
endowment of Arctic seas and lands, especially [in terms of]{.mark} the
presence of [hydrocarbon and mineral reserves]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Since the publication of the Circum-Arctic Resource Appraisal in 2008,
such knowledge of the region has only increased, and triggered a
plethora of [economic [development]{.mark} projects for the
region]{.underline} -- [most geared towards making the commercial
exploitation of such resources viable]{.underline}. [Such
plans]{.underline}, typical of neo-extractivist modes of development and
capital accumulation,1) [[demand]{.mark} new instruments and
technologies of [control]{.mark} [over land]{.mark}, territory and
resources]{.underline} -- [[not only]{.mark} in enabling the [resource
exploitation]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[but also]{.mark} in [displacing
Arctic Indigenous populations]{.mark}]{.underline} that inhabit spaces
where resource-based economic activity is meant to take place. [This
process has been coupled with a range of practices aimed at controlling
space and mobilities in indigenous lands]{.underline} -- what DuPlessis
calls "**[striation activities]{.underline}**". 2) [Theorizations and
debates on [the Arctic resource boom]{.mark}]{.underline} [or on the
geopolitical tensions rising in the region are generally **[oblivious to
indigenous political projects]{.mark}**]{.underline}, institutions and
articulations in the region. This erasure takes the colonial violence
underlying the relation between Arctic States and Arctic indigenous
peoples out of sight, [[obscuring the violent history of
expropriation]{.mark} underpinning contemporary Arctic geopolitics and
economic development]{.underline}. Another effect of such perspectives
is the presentation of the Arctic as an "empty" space, devoid of people,
social dynamics and politics other than those developed and brought by
Westphalian States.3) [This position [seeks to justify]{.mark} [State
interventions]{.mark} in]{.underline} the region for "properly" seizing
[emerging economic and strategic opportunities]{.underline} --
[[with]{.mark} little to [no regard for indigenous cultures]{.mark} and
subsistence in the Arctic]{.underline}, nor to the already sensible
effects of climate change in the region. The present article seeks to
[frame the "Arctic resource boom" as a new wave of Arctic settler
colonialism]{.underline}. [We argue that, although projects for
[resource exploitation]{.mark} of the Arctic are achieving unprecedented
scale]{.underline}, [they [represent a **continuity of the colonial
project**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [benefitting from the way previous waves
of colonization have shaped and reshaped Arctic spaces and the relations
between Indigenous peoples and their traditional
territories]{.underline}. Our discussion is focused on the impacts of
colonialism over the Beringian portion of Inuit Nunaat -- the Inuit
homeland -- and the impacts of colonialism over the relation between
State, indigenous peoples and Arctic spaces. Then we move on to a
discussion of the Arctic resource boom and the strategic and development
projects emerging in the Arctic policies of littoral states and their
treatment of indigenous issues amid economic and strategic pressures to
carve out new extractive enclaves in Arctic territories.

We depart from a historical account of Arctic colonialism, seeking to
understand how the colonial encounter between Inuit and Euro-American
populations and the importance of [resource extraction]{.underline}
shaped contemporary Arctic spaces -- from baleen and whale oil to the
gold rush and discovery of hydrocarbons. One important element here is
to understand how this first moment of colonialism set up the conditions
for modern-day resource development projects. The discussion, then,
turns to contemporary economic development projects in the Arctic,
understanding them as neo-extractivist enterprises -- i.e., enterprises
that rely heavily on resource development and control over space in a
late capitalist globalized economy. As such, these projects [represent a
geographical expansion of extractive frontiers in a global scale,
seeking new resource reserves and to reshape space to make them
commercially viable]{.underline}. [[This]{.mark} [represents a new wave
of colonialism]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [i.e., [of attempts by
state]{.mark} and capital [to]{.mark} enhance [control]{.mark} over
[traditional indigenous territories]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [and a new
wave of threats and attempts at dispossessing Arctic Indigenous Peoples
from their rights to their traditional lands and

The Arctic resource boom and new Arctic colonialisms [In the turn of the
twentieth century]{.underline}, news of the presence of gold in Alaska
and in Chukokta attracted the attention of State, [capital and
individuals seeking to make fortune through mining]{.underline}. Demuth
stresses how the [commercial extraction of minerals demanded, on the
settler side, enclosure and definition of property rights over land and
underground]{.underline}.13) In different parts of Inuit Nunaat,
different arrangements were made in attempt to define and reinforce
borders as well as seizing the economic opportunity brought about by the
knowledge of gold in the Arctic. In the Russian Empire, for example,
gold mining was seen as an imperial concession rather than a private
enterprise, undertook to secure the imperial bullion reserves. In the
U.S, on the other hand, while gold mining was seen as a matter of
private enterprise, it involved State intervention in defining property
rights, settling disputes and defining which citizens were entitled to
the exploitation of gold mining. Both solutions to the problem of
enclosure and property over land were instrumental in extending the
reach of the State inland. The sea was (at that moment) not liable to
territorialization and the hunting activities over the shore and sea-ice
did not entail long-term settlement opportunities, the need to settle
ownership claims and to stimulate mining activity. The discovery of
gold, and the initial ease with which it could be mined, attracted large
contingents of foreigners to Alaska and crystallized ethnic/racial
divisions within Inuit Nunaat. White foreigners sought fortune on gold
mining, while the Iñupiaq of the region were not only physically
segregated, but also relegated to providing subsistence goods and
services (clothing, reindeer meat, transport) that supported the mining
activity. In Russia, on the other hand, the Empire and then the
Bolsheviks sought to control the flow of gold and resettling populations
from other parts of Russia in the region, seeking to turn gold into the
gravitational centre of Chukokta's economy. For the populations of Inuit
Nunaat, these different solutions meant the same -- enclosure that
sought to separate these peoples from their traditional lands and their
livelihoods, which were redirected by the efforts of States to better
serve settler dominated economic activities. The introduction of
coal-powered dredges and the structuration of corporate mining over the
beginning of the twentieth century14) were responsible for accelerating
these trends. Finally[, the discovery of oil in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, in
the late 1970's closes the gap between what we dubbed the "old"
colonialisms and the "new" ones. In the words of Eben Hopson, one of the
founders of the Inuit Circumpolar Council: Our people, who survived the
fur trade, international whaling, and the gold rush, began being
threatened by the world's oil shortage]{.underline}. [The oil discovery
at Prudhoe Bay meant that the European immigrants to America had become
rich, highly industrialised people, and had finally begun to covet our
Arctic land]{.underline}.15) [[Oil and gas
extraction]{.underline}]{.mark}, much like gold mining, are activities
that [[demand]{.mark} great [control over]{.mark} space]{.underline},
[[not only]{.mark} in the [regions where]{.mark} the [extraction
occurs]{.mark}, [but also]{.mark} [in the]{.mark}
**[constitution]{.mark} and maintenance [of logistic
corridors]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Allowing for movement to and from the
producing regions, connecting them to global markets is fundamental in
such economic activities, which makes land an important asset for State
and capitalist agents involved. Moreover, and[, like gold, oil and gas
are deeply enmeshed in global geopolitics, meaning that the development
of hydrocarbon reserves is important for States to achieving their
political and strategic objectives in the global scenario]{.underline}.
The mentioned perception of the coveting of Inuit land, together with
the need to preserve Inuit culture also led to the establishment of the
Inuit Circumpolar Conference, a pan-Arctic Inuit caucus where Inuit
rights and claims were collectively discussed, leading to the founding
of the Inuit Circumpolar Council. Shadian's research details how [the
**'[politics of oil]{.mark}'** articulated Inuit local politics in
Canada, Greenland and the U.S with global issue. The discovery of oil in
regions like northern Alaska and the Arctic in general [has been one of
the main drivers of geopolitical interest]{.mark} in the
region]{.underline}. There were, however, gaps in Euro-American
awareness about the presence of hydrocarbon reserves in the region -- a
trend reversed by the Circum-Arctic Resource Appraisal of 2008. With the
publication of the first comprehensive study by the United States
Geological Survey on the resource endowment of the Arctic, interest in
the economic development of the region spiked. It is estimated that [30%
of the world's undiscovered gas reserves and 13% of the undiscovered oil
reserves are in the Arctic]{.underline}.16) [The [surge in
interest]{.mark} [reflects]{.mark} a global trend: [the emergence
of]{.mark} **[neo-extractivist capital
accumulation]{.mark}**]{.underline},17) [based on increasing pressure
over natural goods and resources and one in which the global extractive
frontiers expand]{.underline}, exerting additional pressures over lands
and territories where resource reserves can be found. [The [expansion
of]{.mark} the [global extractive frontier]{.mark} is directly [related
to]{.mark} [pressure over the traditional lands of Indigenous
peoples]{.mark}, and in tandem with the growing struggle for the
recognition of indigenous rights to self-government]{.underline}. [The
[growing demand for]{.mark} hydrocarbons and mineral [resources]{.mark}
potentially can impact all of Inuit Nunaat, [putting the
security]{.mark} and economic development [of]{.mark} [Arctic States in
a **collision route**]{.mark} with indigenous rights and demands in the
region]{.underline}. [DuPlessis also points to how the [expansion
of]{.mark} the [global extractive frontier is affecting]{.mark} the
[mobilities]{.mark} and spatialities of the indigenous peoples of the
Arctic]{.underline}.18) [Resource development activities and the
discourses that support them are examples of "**[striation
activities]{.mark}**",]{.underline}19) [activities through which the
modern biopolitical state imposes its **striated spatiality over the
smooth spatiality** of the nomadic Sámi people]{.underline}. Transport
infrastructure development plays a large role in this process, since it
is one of the ways through which the state occupies a space and exercise
control over it by organising it in points,20) thus striating it and
enabling the government of movement and other spatialities in the
region. [Striation activities in the Arctic rely heavily on the planning
and construction of physical infrastructure and logistic corridors that
create the necessary lines connecting strategic points, not only for the
direct objective of enabling economic activity via circulation but also

1 \| INTRODUCTION

Over centuries, [[Western desires of Arctic]{.mark} space have
consistently worked to [render icy locales]{.mark} of the North
[**legible** to an audience]{.mark} further south]{.underline} (for
example, David, 2000; Hill, 2008; Lopez, 1986). [Regardless of **varying
temporal claims** to the Arctic by a range of colonial nation-states,
[Indigenous polities]{.mark} have long [called the Arctic]{.mark} home
and [homeland]{.mark}]{.underline} (Gearheard et al., 2013; Krupnik
et al., 2010). In non-Indigenous reportage, [[the Arctic has been
framed]{.mark} through a **dominating lens** that narrates it [as a
**'natural region'**]{.mark} or cryosphere [where elemental
qualities]{.mark} such as cold, ice, snow and darkness [reign
supreme]{.mark}]{.underline} (Marshall, 2012; Ruiz et al., 2019). The
cryosphere is often [overwhelmingly dissected and [demarcated **not by
Indigenous**]{.mark} historical and ongoing [claims to space,
but]{.mark} instead through [the]{.mark} **documented
[presence]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} particular [biota]{.mark} as they
correlate to lines of latitude and/or cold temporalities]{.underline}
(e.g., 'frozen for most of the year'). From parliamentary and
congressional reports to Arctic Council working group documents,
[[maps]{.mark} of a circumpolar region tend to [**define the Arctic by
lines**]{.mark} of latitude]{.underline} such as 66 degrees North (the
Arctic Circle), the northern limit of the treeline or the July 10°C
isotherm. Others have adjusted the lines of demarcation used to define
the Arctic depending on sectoral interests such as conservation,
environmental monitoring, shipping and fishing. [There has been
considerable investment in [refining]{.mark} these **[regional
categorisations]{.mark}**, with efforts made to distinguish between a
High Arctic and a sub-Arctic, which again [use bio-geographical
objects]{.mark} such as surface vegetation [to tease out a transition
zone]{.mark} between very cold and cold environments. [There is no one
Arctic]{.mark}, in other words.]{.underline}

This form of mapping the Arctic is from on high, using vegetation
indicators to carve the surface of the Arctic into segments, while other
more [modern [mapping]{.mark}s [foreground a colonial **desire to
track**]{.mark}, measure [and develop]{.mark} detailed [volumetric
knowledge about Arctic ice, land and sea]{.mark}]{.underline} (Cameron
2015). Surface, aerial, space-based and volumetric mapping work together
as well, [further attempting [to **render legible** the]{.mark}
horizontal and vertical space of the [Arctic]{.mark} and its
ice]{.underline} (on subterranean aesthetics and mapping,
Hawkins, 2020). [[Measuring ice]{.mark} by volume [adds]{.mark} deeper
[colo**nial scientific**]{.mark} **dimensions** [to knowing, occupying
and **extracting** ]{.mark}**from the Arctic**]{.underline}. Academic
disciplines such as [glaciology and permafrost science were integral to
this shift away from and building on surface level measurements of
ice]{.underline} (and associated methods such as repeat photography)
[[to]{.mark} a [focus on]{.mark} ice cores and the volume and depth of
[the cryosphere.]{.mark}]{.underline} As Sorlin and Isberg (2021) remind
us, [ice coring not only [transformed]{.mark} the [social and material
landscapes]{.mark} of Greenland [into a site of]{.mark} considerable
**[scientific and strategic interest]{.mark}** but [also transformed the
**epistemological and material significance** of
ice]{.mark}]{.underline} (Alley, 2014; Cosgrove, 2008). As ice cores
from Greenland and Antarctica are transported and archived in overseas
locations, [the temporal relationship to scientific research of ice and
the data it contains allows for a new form of reconstruction of past
environments and climates.]{.underline} Interpreting the chemical makeup
of two mile long ice cores extracted from ice sheets creates particular
apertures of mediated past climates to emerge. In one sense, then[, ice
core science [created the conditions]{.mark} of possibility [for
**universal narratives** about the history of the Earth]{.mark} to take
shape and inform a climate-catastrophe modernity.]{.underline} While
local fieldwork was consequential in terms of access to ice, often
through the presence of militarised access and partnership, [the
portability of material ice enabled scientific networks to **extend and
transform**]{.underline} (O\'Reilly, 2016 and see the essays in Dodds &
Sörlin, 2002).

colonialities: Evidence from Arctic Extractivisms," Journal of Political
Ecology, 31(1), 538--566, dml)

[Green extractivisms and climate colonialities are **intertwined** with
past oil exploitation]{.underline}, [uranium and iron
mining]{.underline}, [LNG extraction]{.underline}, [and the effects of
climate change in the Arctic area]{.underline} (Figure 1). [Colonial
**consequences** affect land and socio-ecological
**disruptions**]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} in turn [trigger
**resistance**]{.underline} (Ford et al., 2021; Holz, 2023). Similar
findings showing resistance by Indigenous peoples, reindeer herders, and
other supporters against these activities have been reported in the
previous work of Hanaček et al. (2022) as well as Naykanchina (2012).
The 16 cases, as explained below, involve [**indivisible sequences** of
historical and contemporary struggles against extractivism and climate
coloniality in the Arctic]{.underline}, imposed by different
nation-states. Counter-extractivist struggles, [both local and
worldwide]{.underline}, [are a call for **real transformations** towards
sustainability and social equity]{.underline} (Scheidel et al., 2018).

The sixteen [cases reveal]{.underline} four [**significant tendencies**
surrounding green extractivisms and climate colonialities in the
Arctic]{.underline} (Figure 2). The [first is a **positive solution
framing** of new Arctic extraction]{.underline} by its proponents, [in
which discourses]{.underline}, [promotions]{.underline}, [technological
innovation]{.underline}, [as well as support from]{.underline} nation
[states and]{.underline} multinational [companies]{.underline}, [are
performed in an environmentally responsible manner]{.underline}. [This
includes greening the full supply chain]{.underline} including raw
material extraction, processing and production, waste management,
transport, and distribution (Garbis et al., 2023). The trend also
involves specific references to the Nordic context, where oil and mining
activities have (supposedly) always been committed to environmental and
socio- economic improvements (Egerman et al., 2003).

In Russia, greening the supply chain is associated with the
modernization of industrial (Soviet) facilities, which would allow for
further development of emerging energy transition materials, LNG and
nuclear power utility in the supply chain, and overall global trade
(Venovcevs, 2021; Wu et al., 2021). In the Canadian and the US parts of
the Arctic, [the need for **additional infrastructure** or **expansion**
of existing mines]{.underline} (copper, iron) [are **justified** and
**promoted** because of the growing demand for energy transition metals
and infrastructure]{.underline}. In Greenland, [uranium and rare
earths]{.underline}, both of [which are **radioactive**]{.underline},
[are promoted as helpful]{.underline} for combating climate change and
for independence. These findings are in line with the work of Össbo
(2023), who proposes that [green colonialism **blends** past
expropriation with contemporary deprivation]{.underline}. Historically
contested energy and mining projects have previously been discussed as
part of the contemporary green transition and \"**[sacrifice
zones]{.underline}**\" [in the Arctic]{.underline}. We connect such
processes to the climate emergency affecting Arctic peoples. The
region\'s extractivism-based development has resulted in a scenario in
which the interests of the fuel, mining, and now green energy complexes
[are framed as]{.underline} \"**[required]{.underline}**\" [to deliver
a]{.underline} \"**[solution]{.underline}**\" to climate change (Dorn et
al., 2022; Gelderloos, 2022; Voskoboynik & Andreucci, 2022). Arctic
Indigenous peoples regard climate change problems and solutions to it as
a continuation of colonialism, with strong ties between capitalism and
extractivisms\' past and current acts (Callison, 2014; Whyte, 2017).

[The second tendency is]{.underline} that [Arctic
**socio-environmental** and **atmospheric** violence becoming
**inextricably linked**]{.underline} (DeBoom, 2022; Hughes et al.,
2023), [forming **colonial atmospheres**]{.underline} through a variety
of political, social, economic, and environmental means (Mahony &
Endfield, 2018; Osborne & Carlson, 2023). In this (neo)colonial
climate-led resource frontier expansion, **[non]{.underline}**- and
anti-[**extractivist** forms of knowledge and ways of being are
**systemically ignored**]{.underline} (Kröger, 2022), [and serve as a
**foundation** for global]{.underline} green extractivism, increased
energy use, and the [**destruction** of **human** and other-than-human
**nature**]{.underline} (Sheller, 2023; Sultana, 2022). [We came across
**several** Arctic]{.underline} \"**[sacrifice zones]{.underline}**\"
[that can be **compared** to other]{.underline} studies explaining
climate- induced crises of green accumulation and hegemonic profiteering
in [colonized countries and regions]{.underline} (Andreucci et al.,
2023; DeBoom, 2022; Dunlap, 2023). [Here]{.underline},
[epistemic]{.underline}, [ontological]{.underline},
[infrastructural]{.underline}, [and atmospheric violence are **central**
to colonial-extractivism(s)]{.underline}.

(2022), <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpol.2022.104957> \[AY\]

The international, national, and territorial instruments reviewed
collectively emphasize safe navigation, including environmental
protection and human safety, as a requirement to enable access to marine
spaces in Arctic waters. However, the governance values and intent of
these instruments diverge in how safety is conceptualized and in how sea
ice is framed. [Under international and national policies and guidance
which are underpinned by a 'western' or Eurocentric value system, sea
ice is an **impediment to** access and safe **navigation**, and vessels
with icebreaking capabilities **facilitate vessel mobility** and are a
means of **risk management** when transiting ice covered
waters]{.underline}. In contrast, [under territorial policies which are
underpinned by an Inuit value system, intact sea ice is viewed as a
**socio-ecological system** that not only **enables mobility** and
coastal access for people and animals, but is **integral to** Inuit
**culture and well-being**. Vessels with icebreaking capabilities have
the capacity to **threaten this critical coastal
platform**]{.underline}. At the same time, icebreakers also support
activities and logistics for local economies (including resource
development) and can enable the delivery of essential goods to
communities. This positions Inuit and Inuit organizations in Nunavut as
essential to include in icebreaking governance.

In the Canadian Arctic, icebreaking activities fall under federal
jurisdiction, and legislation and regulations have been designed to
implement international conventions and agreements, including the Polar
Code. [Thus, the dominant policies influencing icebreaking
governance]{.underline} in the Canadian Arctic [are **embedded in
colonial structures**]{.underline} \[30\], \[73\]. [The ways in which
the dominant system of governance conceptualizes maritime space allows
the application of linear boundaries to represent dynamic and
indeterminate environments]{.underline} \[59\], \[89\]. The [challenges
of this type of environment are accounted for in part by framing sea ice
as a **barrier to access** and an impediment to vessel and crew safety
requiring strategic planning and risk management. The divergence in how
sea ice is conceptualized and valued, and the **asymmetrical influence**
international and **national policy holds** poses a substantial barrier
to incorporating Inuit rights, perspectives, and governance values into
icebreaking policies]{.underline}. Yet, Inuit rights as affirmed in
Section 35 of the Canadian Constitution Act, the Nunavut Agreement, and
the newly legislated United Nations Declaration on the Rights of
Indigenous Peoples Act provide an imperative for appropriate
consideration and consultation when developing shipping policies (or
resource development projects) that may impact Inuit rights in Canada.

Valued Components identified in the Draft Nunavut Land Use Plan are not
only important ecologically speaking, but also are directly related to
Inuit rights and governance values. The ability of the NPC's land use
planning and consideration of IQ to influence icebreaking activities was
demonstrated in 2015 when it rejected Baffinland's application to ship
ore from Mary River mine for 10 months of the year. It was determined
that the proposal was not compatible with the North Baffin Regional Land
Use Plan,4 as shipping ore in the winter months would require
[icebreaking support]{.underline} that [would **damage** community
**hunting and travel routes**, and potentially **harm wildlife** and
wildlife habitat]{.underline} \[35\]. The regulatory reach encompassed
commercial icebreaking activities in this case because the icebreaking
was taking place to support Baffinland\'s mining activities (subject to
Nunavut regulations). However, territorial jurisdiction does not
supersede federal activities and policies, meaning that in theory, the
decision could have been overturned by the federal government.
Considering these events in light of the Baffinland Phase 2 Expansion
described in Section 2.4, we may once again see how Baffinland's
proposed expansion is considered in light of varying support and
opposition from different hamlets and Nunavut's land use planning
through the final recommendation of the NIRB, which is expected in 2022
\[47\]. The recommendation of the NIRB will be subject to approval by
the Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada minister.

[Communities in the Qiqitani (Baffin) region of Nunavut continue to
experience **declining sea ice** conditions, characterized by a shorter
winter season, with sea ice forming later and melting earlier. The
thinning of the sea ice, and greater variability in its thickness
impacts the network of sea ice trails, making landfast ice more
**unstable** in some places, and less predictable, and therefore posing
greater **risks for travel**]{.underline} (Bravo 2009; Ford et al. 2023;
Krupnik and Jolly 2002). [Inuit elders' **t**]{.underline}raditional
**[k]{.underline}**nowledge [in Nunavut has frequently confirmed the
importance of the knowledge and skill required to read ice conditions
for safe navigation]{.underline} (e.g. changing colors, textures,
patterns of ice beneath the snow, seasonality, onset of ice formation,
stability, growth, and hazards associated with moving ice). [One highly
experienced Igloolik Elder emphasized that sea ice knowledge is 'a large
and complex topic, and the knowledge is acquired only with many years of
patient observation and experience',]{.underline} a body of expert
knowledge not unlike a scientific discipline in many respects. [Inuit
interviewees also drew attention to the many **social** and **material**
forms of sea ice, in effect, its different roles]{.underline}.

[Unlike many other cultures, the Inuit often directly give place names
to sea ice]{.underline}. Approximately 10 km to the northeast of
Igloolik, [Agiuppiniq is the site of an important camp and is the name
given to the most conspicuous ice ridge]{.underline} (Anthony Qunnut,
1995, IE-321; Theo Ikummaq, 2000, IE-466; George Qulaut, n.d., IE-476;
cited in Bravo 2009). [This ice ridge has served as an important
landmark]{.underline} for navigating the large body of water named
'Ikiq' meaning 'a strait'. This so-named ice ridge is created by the
friction of moving ice driven by a current moving past landfast sea ice.
The name Agiuppiniq means 'a file' and refers to the process by which
the ice ridge is created. [The shape and location of the ridge provides
a shelter from the wind ideally located near the ice floe edge for
subsistence seal hunting in the spring]{.underline}.

This example clearly shows that the [potential impacts of shipping in
ice-filled waters are not simply about carving a passage through an
anonymous or featureless platform]{.underline} of sea ice spanning great
distances. [The sea ice has a far more **dynamic existence** and is part
of the **fabric of lived experience**, historically shaped through its
features and place names]{.underline}, a dwelling place revered as a
place of return, and bountiful in the subsistence life it affords. Inuit
trails spanning the coastal waters of the Inuit Nunangat, form a
connected matrix of traditional routes, held together by sea ice. This
has been represented visually in the Pan-Inuit Trails digital atlas
(Aporta, Bravo, and Taylor 2014), which shows the extent to which [sea
ice trails form **connected spaces** of Inuit occupancy. Shipping and
icebreaking can interfere with access to **hunting areas** and
**traditional camps** of indigenous people]{.underline}.

Shipping routes constitute multiple forms of hazard because of their
potential to interfere with traditional trails, disturb marine
ecosystems, and aggravate the fragmentation of sea ice. [Winter and
spring shipping by breaking up sea ice can cut through important
longstanding seasonal sea ice trails, the fabric of Inuit mobility. When
sea ice becomes thinner, fractures, breaks up or is carried away by a
powerful current, a hunter may be suddenly separated or stranded at
sea]{.underline}, requiring all of their skill and knowledge to reach a
place of safety. If the level of hazard for unsuspecting travelers
becomes unacceptably high-risk over time, [this can infringe on Inuit
sources of food and mobility. Furthermore, it can potentially isolate
marine mammal populations, thus altering **essential traditional
reciprocal relationships** between humans and animals]{.underline}.

Isolate and Assimilate: Settler Colonialism in the Canadian Arctic

For many of the world's colonizing nations, the decades following World
War II were marked by the crumbling of their empires; the colonized
peoples left to their own devices to dismantle the harmful structures
and systems left behind in the wake of revolutions. Those that had
turned internally for their systems of control were forced to reckon
with their pasts of assimilation and the federal abuse of their
indigenous populations. Many, but not all. Canada, rather than looking
at its history and the damage it had done, turned to the north, and
doubled down on its colonial ideologies. [The Canadian **[government
presented]{.mark} their [colonization of the Arctic as]{.mark} a
[humanitarian]{.mark} effort**, [as if **taking** ]{.mark}**the [land
and forcing cultural elimination]{.mark}** []{.mark}amongst its people
**[would "save"]{.mark} them [from extinction]{.mark}**. The **[idea
that]{.mark} the [Inuit]{.mark}** [**were disappearing and needed to be
"saved,"**]{.mark} just like the Myth of the Vanishing Indian in the
United States, [**was quite popular**]{.mark} from the late nineteenth
century into the first half of the twentieth]{.underline}. It was [[so
pervasive]{.mark} both in Canada and internationally [that even]{.mark}
Roald Amundsen, arriving in the Canadian Arctic in [1903]{.mark} with
the Gjøa [Expedition]{.mark}, [was shocked to find Inuit still
alive]{.mark}, believing they, "were extinct, and had been relegated to
oblivion]{.underline}."1 Many [**[publications on]{.mark} the
[colonization of the]{.mark} Canadian** **[Arctic]{.mark}**, even all
the way up to 2017, **[follow this myth as an excuse to call it]{.mark}
"[reluctant]{.mark}" [or]{.mark} even "[accidental]{.mark}**"
[colonialism]{.mark}]{.underline}. Edith Iglauer actually praises the
Canadian government's actions, ["No longer demoralized and half-starved
in an ancient and primitive world...the Eskimo is becoming part of our
world, of that economically interdependent society that we
know."]{.underline}2 A publication by the Minority Rights Group from
1994 [[excuses the government's actions by arguing]{.mark} that the
[Inuit never attempted to defend their land]{.mark} by force; the
government assumed there was no attachment to their
country]{.underline}, so "there was no need to obtain their approval
before taking their land for Canada."3 If this statement is correct,
then it says more about the Canadian government's lack of interest in
understanding Inuit culture than it does Inuit attachment. [Inuit
identity is, and always has been, heavily tied to the land and its
resources. Expecting force and violence from a culture largely based on
sharing and cooperating, and one with no history of inter-tribal
warfare, in order to defend that land is a complete misunderstanding of
indigenous traditions]{.underline}. Even respected social anthropologist
Robert Paine writes that, "the more noteworthy feature about the
Canadian north is still the degree that colonialism there was
unintended, even accidental."4 [**[No colonialism is accidental]{.mark},
[nor]{.mark} is it [reluctant]{.mark}**. [Colonialism requires
intent]{.mark}. No one accidentally takes away native land and destroys
cultures in their wake. These [writings suggest]{.mark} a [degree of
support towards the]{.mark} Canadian [government's actions]{.mark};
[or]{.mark}, at the very least, a **[complete refusal to engage with
indigenous voices and suffering]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For those
authors rightly uncomfortable with the idea that any form of colonialism
could be called "reluctant," welfare colonialism remains the most
popular alternative for describing the actions of the Canadian
government in the Arctic. Presented by Frank Tester, one of the most
respected scholars of Arctic history, this angle focuses on the total
forced economic dependencies of the Inuit on the Canadian government.
Tester and his constituents present a well-argued and well-researched
perspective on the colonization of the Arctic, one that certainly seems
to have occurred. Occurred, that is, if economic factors are the only
thing being looked at when defining the region's colonization. Tester,
however, was writing long before Patrick Wolfe's "Settler Colonialism
and the Elimination of the Native." Wolfe presents a form of colonialism
that allows for examination through a more cultural-centric lens, while
still recognizing the exploitation of economics and welfare for purposes
of assimilation. It could be argued that settler colonialism does not
apply due to the relatively smaller percentage of white settlers in
comparison to the remaining indigenous population. Alternatively,
because the government never directly told the Inuit that they had to
leave to make room for outsiders, or qallunaat, the term could not
apply. However, neither of these are the case, nor do they erase the
[[**widespread government usage** of]{.mark} the primary aspect of
settler colonialism:]{.underline} **[[logics of
elimination]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Wolfe designates a series of
outcomes of the logics of elimination, almost [all of which **[apply to
the colonization of the]{.mark} Canadian**
**[Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and include, *Officially encouraged
miscegenation, the breaking down of native title into alienable
individual freeholds, native citizenship, child abduction, religious
conversion, resocialization in total institutions such as missions or
boarding schools, and a whole range of cognate biocultural
assimilations*.5 The Canadian government used wildlife management laws,
residential schools, and control of native health to enforce cultural
elimination, resocialization, and religious conversion. [Inuit land was
broken down into qallunaat controlled settlements, where the Inuit would
be moved either through force or coercion to be assimilated into
Canadian culture, becoming settlers in their own land. [Through]{.mark}
a [structured and organized invasion of life]{.mark} and livelihoods,
the Canadian [government used settler colonialism to isolate and
assimilate]{.mark} the [Inuit]{.mark} in their own Arctic
territory.]{.underline}

Recent reports from the [IPCC]{.underline} illustrate both contentions.
In 2018, the IPCC released its 1.5-degree-warming report,

transition, articulating five multidimensional mitigation
pathways,Footnote2 with feasibility criteria focusing on both the
physical environment and societal systems.

The [[IPCC calls for]{.underline}]{.mark} '[[accelerating the

stewardship of GHG emissions requires that everything be quantified and
commensurable.

The [IPCC speaks of]{.underline} '[zero]{.underline}' or
'low-[carbon]{.underline} energy' [without acknowledging
carbon]{.underline} [is only]{.underline} **[one
indicator]{.underline}** of the human footprint. Instead, [it becomes
expressive of]{.underline} **[all GHGs]{.underline}**, thus providing a
general equivalent to measure the global warming potential of different
activities at the same time. [This approach evades]{.underline} the
potential **[conflicts]{.underline}** [among different regimes
of]{.underline} **[temporality]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}
**[geo-materials]{.underline}** and humans in technological activities,
as well as how the multiple temporalities of carbon may have an impact
on just transition. While environmental movements call for just
transition by balancing deep decarbonization with human welfare, and
ensuring manufacturers reuse and recycle, they still maintain the idea
that [all beings are immersed in]{.underline} a single time -- [the
universal timeline]{.underline}.

The [[IPCC]{.underline}]{.mark} has been critiqued. Many argue it is not
geographically, racially, or gender neutral. Its privileging of the
natural sciences over the social sciences and humanities and its
prioritization of Western science are problematic. Not only does it
[[marginalize Indigenous knowledges]{.underline}]{.mark}; it also
[[supports a polity that sees postcolonial ecologies]{.mark} and
BIPOC]{.underline} (black, indigenous, and people of color) [[as
an]{.underline}]{.mark} '**[[environmental
problem]{.underline}]{.mark}**' (Mills Citation2001, p. 83). At the same
time, scholars have recently noted changes in the IPCC, pointing to the
inclusion of social science/humanities perspectives, a growing
engagement with plural cosmologies, and an acknowledgement that
coloniality and environmental racism play a key role in climate change.
Nevertheless, inscribed in its language, [there remains a linear
trajectory toward]{.underline} attribution, detection, and
**[elimination]{.underline}** of the problem [to reach the telos of a
polity in which there is no colonial or nature problem]{.underline}. It
focuses on green and biofuel promotion, neglect in how such principles
affect smallholders (Arora and Sterling Citation2023) or indigenous and
post-colonial communities, not engaging divergent values, worldviews,
and interests, remaining abstract, and evading what kind of PJT may
emerge and toward what ends.

The [IPCC]{.underline} and other agencies, such as the Intergovernmental
Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES
Citation2019), are [not]{.underline} [value-neutral]{.underline}. They
involve themselves in boundary work (Livingston and Rummukainen
Citation2020), expressing what makes them distinct and separating the
significance of their work from other climate change projects by
defining their object of focus in temporal terms. [In
deploying]{.underline} 'boundary objects -- items or artifacts of
[knowledge that can be adjusted]{.underline} and utilized [across
different]{.underline} socio-political [contexts]{.underline} for
different goals (e.g. temperature targets like 2°C or 1.5°C)'
(Chakraborty and Sherpa Citation2021, p. 49), [these
institutions]{.underline} respond to a multiplicity of stakeholders
[see]{.underline}ing [transition as]{.underline} a [linear]{.underline}
temporal trajectory [without addressing multiple temporalities inscribed
in]{.underline} the PJT, or in racial [capital's retrojective
recompositions]{.underline}, demands of broader collectives. [Boundary
work retains]{.underline} the divisions of nature and the social, and it
prioritizes [[techno-fixes]{.mark} and linear developmental logics
[premised on]{.mark}]{.underline} and consistent with socio-technical
'progress' and [an]{.underline} **[[eschatological
end]{.underline}]{.mark}**. These linear logics call for reforms such as
the improvement of ecological standards of existing institutions and
technologies (York and Eugene Citation2003), where [transition
engenders]{.underline} '[a variant of the [idea of
progress]{.mark}]{.underline}[']{.mark} [that advances
[through]{.mark}]{.underline} '(a) an **[industrial
takeoff]{.underline}**, (b) the construction of **[industrial
societies]{.underline}**, and (c) an ecological transition to a new
phase of **[[superindustrialization']{.underline}]{.mark}** (McLaughlin
Citation2012, pp. 179--180). [Technological]{.underline}
'[fixes]{.underline},' such as innovative renewable energy technologies,
[[provide certainty]{.underline}]{.mark}: 'down the road, there will be
a technology to bail us out' (Malm and Carton Citation2021, p. 11) [[but
not]{.underline}]{.mark} necessarily **[[justice]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[for ecologies]{.underline}]{.mark} harmed and
**[[decimated]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[from]{.underline}]{.mark}
expansion and [**[extractions]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[capital innovations]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Even when providing a clear rationale for action, 'global' reports limit
questions about time, transition, and planetary justice. Such questions
as 'How did we get here?' or 'What kinds of transitions will yield what
change and what justice?' are diverted. Instead, the [[reports]{.mark}
are guided by matrices of dominant power]{.underline} that are
themselves guided by a perpetual 'logic of colonial extractivism'
(Alkhalili et al. Citation2023, p. 2). [They [herald
a]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[temporal orientation]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[toward]{.underline}]{.mark} certain 'settlements' and present
**[[techno-fixes]{.underline}]{.mark}** for the climate crisis as
opportunities [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} [[promote]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[green capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[economic growth]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Avila Citation2018).
[Reformation of the]{.underline} **[capitalist economy]{.underline}**
and environmental change [can only be achieved through]{.underline}
technical and procedural **[innovation]{.underline}** (Hajer and Mol
Citation2010).

Even with its recent referencing of the link of colonialism with climate
change (Funes Citation2022), [the [IPCC does not]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[reckon]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[with]{.underline}]{.mark} the kinds
of [[temporalities]{.underline}]{.mark} [[that]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[inscribe colonial practices]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Postcolonial
sites are 'shackled by environmental determinist renditions of risk'
(Chakraborty and Sherpa Citation2021, p. 49), denying their ongoing,
complex social-ecological transformations.
**[[Extractions]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and]{.underline} **[toxic
environments]{.underline}** [resulting from]{.underline} universal
demands for [change in biogeochemical cycles [are]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[relegated]{.underline}]{.mark}** to the margins,
[[evading]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[entrenched [colonial
ideologies]{.mark}]{.underline}** that focus on addressing gaps in
knowledge. It is as if a reduction of uncertainties and an accumulation
of knowledge will reduce the presumed ignorance of racialized and
postcolonial subjects and leverage individuals and governments towards
action and policy.

All such science-**[[policy debates]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[suffer from
a]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[temporal problem]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In
the IPCC documents, the issues to be dealt with are identified at a
given moment in time (now) or over a temporally codifiable period,
ignoring how [[dominant **temporal understandings**]{.underline}]{.mark}
such as 'backwardness' informed and **[[shape]{.underline}]{.mark}**d
[[colonial]{.underline}]{.mark} practices and [[**injustices** of
**ecological racisms**]{.underline}]{.mark} perpetrated over time. These
[eschatological approaches rely on]{.underline} phenomenological
[narratives of racialized]{.underline}/colonial
[experience]{.underline}. They do not query whether the inclusion of
this link of climate change with coloniality risks realizing a
neoliberal teleological transition goal if the foundations of this
relationship of time and coloniality is not problematized. Cutting-edge
ideas about change can be appropriated but without always reaching
planetary justice for most of the ecologies and communities of the
world. Nor do they suggest how to disrupt temporal dimensions in the
science transition discourses that have conventionally distinguished and
inscribed themselves on the promise of progress. [Tackling]{.underline}
the [[links between colonialism]{.mark} and climate change [requires
understanding]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[temporal logics of
colonialism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, its apparatuses and orders which
have linked colonized peoples and Mother Earth together, evading that at
the forefront of this is a division, sequencing and determining of form
and content entangled with the idea that certain 'natures' have time and
others do not. [[Questioning colonialism's]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[transmutations]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[into]{.underline}]{.mark}
contemporary **[[politico-economic]{.mark}
[infrastructures]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[should be at the
forefront]{.underline}]{.mark} including wealth, polities and social
warfare, highlighting that Euro-based, [[linear models of
transition]{.mark} that [insist on centralizing]{.mark}]{.underline}
scientific '**[[arbitrators of credibility]{.underline}]{.mark}**'
(Chakraborty and Sheza Citation2021, p. 49) [are not the
answer]{.underline}.

In establishing a relationship between climate change and temporality,
scientists and [[policymakers]{.mark} [render]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[unintelligible]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[colonial
violences]{.underline}]{.mark} and ongoing asymmetrical inequities. In
other words, [when the [IPCC's]{.mark}]{.underline} scientific and
[[policy language is grafted onto colonial
injustices]{.underline}]{.mark}, [it translates those]{.underline}
injustices [into]{.underline} what Veena Das calls [a]{.underline}
'frozen slide' (Das Citation2006, p. 106), a forensically examinable
single [event of the past]{.underline}. But [[ecological]{.mark}
[violences]{.mark}]{.underline} or injustices [are [defined
by]{.mark}]{.underline} their perpetuation and
**[[regeneration]{.underline}]{.mark}** across time.

[[Ecological modernization]{.underline}]{.mark} approaches to global
warming [[argue a finitude of]{.underline}]{.mark} natural [[resources
can be overcome through]{.underline}]{.mark} either a 'leveraged
futurity' or **[[market mechanisms]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This approach
to transition takes the linear socio-temporality of capital's
circulation cycles through green technologies for granted: 'Through
reduced population growth, the saturation of demand among prosperous
consumers and improved technological efficiency, we can become both rich
and green' (Asafu-Adjaye et al. Citation2015, p. 6). Monbiot
(Citation2015) says this [[idea of]{.mark} [transition
has]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[missed]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[the history
of capitalism and its]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[racialized
impacts]{.underline}]{.mark}** on different populations and natures. It
lacks neutrality and has colonial and imperial underpinnings (Sovacool
Citation2021). It does not grapple with qualitative and uneven effects
on different forms of existence (Davis and Todd Citation2017, Torres
Contreras Citation2022, Dunlap Citation2023). Nor does it engage with
how such a universal or the time of the human is inscribed in models of
social engineering or ask whether its accounts of change can displace
linearity towards a non-anthropocentric, non-progression material
transformation for a substantive planetary justice.

In many circumstances, [Indigenous understandings of]{.underline}
**[inter-polity]{.underline}** relations [pre-date]{.underline}
contemporary [IR by millennia]{.underline}, and [yet
Indigeneity]{.underline}, or lack thereof, [remains a prototype
for]{.underline} **[epistemic whiteness]{.underline}** within the
discipline and broader governance structures (Brigg et al 2022). For
example, [IR has]{.underline} repeatedly **[dismissed]{.underline}**
[Indigenous]{.underline} political [movements]{.underline},
**[relegating]{.underline}** [Indigenous issues to the realms of
domestic politics]{.underline} or anthropology, deeming such phenomena
peripheral to the core concerns of world politics (Kuokkanen 2019). This
[relegation is]{.underline} [rooted in the assumption of]{.underline}
**[sovereignty]{.underline}** [as]{.underline} a
**[primary]{.underline}** analytical lens [in]{.underline}
[IR]{.underline}, which inherently excludes Indigenous peoples as active
subjects of international relations (Capan 2017; Shaw 2002; Sabaratnam
2011). Instead, [Indigenous populations serve to]{.underline}
'[constitut\[e\] the borders of the]{.underline} modern, the
[rational]{.underline}, the [sovereign]{.underline}, [and the
state']{.underline} (Shaw 2002, 62), stemming from 'narratives derived
from those with "authority" to produce knowledge' (Blackwell &
Ballangarry 2023, 28). A [binary emerges]{.underline}, [where the
white]{.underline}, [Westernised]{.underline}, [Eurocentric nature
of]{.underline} traditional [IR]{.underline} [maintains]{.underline}
**[authoritative voice]{.underline}** and knowledge [and Indigenous
peoples]{.underline} (and other marginalised communities) [are presumed
to]{.underline} **[lack]{.underline}** [and to be engaged in a process
of]{.underline} '**[catching up]{.underline}**' (Moreton-Robinson 2015;
Smith, \[2013\] 2021).

Critical approaches to the Eurocentrism of IR have understandably
focused on this discursive 'lack' of story, concentrating on the gaps
and silences within the discipline that has consequently limited the
agency of actors (Doty 1998; Shaw 2002; Archarya 2014; Capan 2017;
Barthwal-Datta 2023). However, as we explore further, the [solution to
epistemic ignorance is not simply to]{.underline}
**[locate]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[identify]{.underline}**
marginalised non-white subjects within IR. If the assumption remains
that IR offers the most legitimate scholarly depictions of world
politics, the [inclusion of]{.underline} [non-white or
Indigenous]{.underline} issues or [perspectives]{.underline} within the
existing paradigm only validate the [discipline's authoritative
voice]{.underline} (Shaw 2002; Capan 2017). [Centring Indigenous
peoples]{.underline} (and by extension bringing to the centre other
marginalised groups) [without]{.underline} **[tackling]{.underline}**
and transforming [structures of power serves only to
legitimise]{.underline} **[IR itself]{.underline}**, reinforcing its
universality [whilst]{.underline} potentially
**[overlooking]{.underline}** the diverse realities and [perspectives of
Indigenous]{.underline} and marginalised [communities]{.underline} (Shaw
2002, 69). To address the epistemic whiteness of IR theory and practice,
[there is a need to]{.underline} **[fundamentally
re-imagine]{.underline}** [IR]{.underline}, moving beyond
Western-centric narratives and embracing diverse approaches (Brigg et al
2022; Shaw 2002; Sabaratnam 2020; Davis and Blackwell 2023).
[Indigenous]{.underline} perspectives and [ways of]{.underline}
**[being]{.underline}**, **[knowing]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[doing]{.underline}** [offer]{.underline} entirely [different ways of
accessing]{.underline} and comprehending (world) [politics]{.underline}
and it is not enough to attempt to retrofit Eurocentric frameworks with
a perceived Indigenous nuance (Brigg et al 2022; Blackwell 2023).
Through its internal emancipatory frameworks, and an orientation towards
future agendas, '[Indigenous political theory is inherently
about]{.underline} **[re-thinking]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[re-imagining]{.underline}** [what we]{.underline} typically
[mean]{.underline} by [relations international]{.underline}' (Lightfoot
2020, 155). [To address epistemic whiteness]{.underline}
**[demands]{.underline}** [deeper engagement with]{.underline} these
constructions of **[Indigenous]{.underline}** and other **[racialised
peoples]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} **[IR]{.underline}**, the
challenges of representation, and the emerging paradigms that seek to
redefine how we conceptualise and engage with Indigenous politics and
relations.

Taking the concept of Indigeneity seriously in international relations
offers access to numerous ontological, epistemological, and axiological
dimensions that challenge and enrich conventional understandings (see
Kuokkanen 2007). A growing body [scholarship advocates for]{.underline}
a [relational]{.underline} **[ontological reconfiguration]{.underline}**
[that ackn]{.underline}owledges **[Indigenous international
designs]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[political
theories]{.underline}**, arguing that [mainstream IR concepts are
insufficient]{.underline} for understanding Indigenous approaches (Shaw
2002; Capan 2017; Dawson et al. 2021; Kuokkanen 2019; Brigg et al 2022;
Martin and Mirraboopa 2003; Blackwell 2023). By engaging with this
literature, we aim to better understand how [indigenous scholarship
provides different]{.underline} **[methodological]{.underline}** and
**[theoretical frameworks]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}
**[decolonise]{.underline}** and deconstruct [the epistemic]{.underline}
[whiteness inherent in IR]{.underline}, [while]{.underline} also
[emphasising the role of]{.underline} **[Indigenous
peoples]{.underline}**, **[communities]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[scholars]{.underline}** in determining their own role within the
discipline (Lightfoot 2020). In doing so, we emphasise existing
alternatives to the current disciplinary frameworks; seeking to
understand socio-political phenomenon beyond limited colonial terms and
challenge the ontological, epistemological, axiological, and
methodological traditions of mainstream IR (Duarte and Belarde Lewis,
2015; Brigg et al. 2022; Martin and Mirraboopa 2003).

Normative ([white]{.underline}) [ontological]{.underline} and
epistemological [frameworks rest on]{.underline} categorisation and
cataloguing. As noted by Marisa Elena Duarte and Miranda Belarde-Lewis
(2015, 681), the [suppression of Indigenous]{.underline}
[knowledge]{.underline}s is often reflected in many national catalogues;
for example, as they suggest, [terms such as]{.underline}
'[aborigines]{.underline}, Australia---[treatment']{.underline}
[could]{.underline} very easily [be rewritten as]{.underline}
'[genocide]{.underline}'. This is a term that Indigenous peoples often
say 'adequately describes' their experiences---experiences which Larissa
Behrendt (2001, 132) explains is hard to fit within Western academic
legal and political discourse. Too often, [Indigenous
knowledges]{.underline}, or even understandings of Western concepts,
[are **shoehorned** in ways that **deprive** them of their **meaning**
to fit into]{.underline} such [normative]{.underline}
([white]{.underline}) [ontological]{.underline} and
[epistemological]{.underline} [frameworks]{.underline}. Further, the
[deconstruction]{.underline}, [suppression]{.underline}, [and omission
of Indigenous ontologies]{.underline} often [occurs as]{.underline}
[Western institutions catalogue and misappropriate Indigenous
understandings]{.underline} to fit within Westernised frameworks (Brigg
et al. 2022). Duarte and Belarde-Lewis (2015) highlight the necessity
for individuals to engage in decolonization work by stepping away from
normative expectations that confine Indigenous knowledge within Western
institutions. [This includes acknowledging]{.underline} [Indigenous
peoples\' preferences]{.underline} in organizing their knowledge and
documents, [**reframing** colonial]{.underline} and homogenising
**[terminologies]{.underline}** like \"Native American,\" [and
**resisting**]{.underline} the [**suppression** of Indigenous
histories]{.underline} in cataloguing systems (Duarte and Belarde-Lewis
2015). In contrast, academics can employ Indigenous ways of being,
knowing, and doing to better understand and engage in antiracist and
decolonial work.

The ontological and epistemological frameworks of Indigenous Australian
scholarship, for example, have directly challenged the historical
whiteness that characterises traditional IR theory and methodological
approaches. The vast quantity of research conducted on Aboriginal and
Torres Strait Islander people, country, and communities since British
invasion in the 1770s has made this population one of the most
researched on the planet (Martin and Mirraboopa 2003). However
[Indigenous]{.underline} Australians [were]{.underline} mostly [not seen
as collaborators]{.underline} or authoritative voices worthy of
respectful engagement but rather as subjects or even objects of
'intellectual' curiosity (Martin and Mirraboopa 2003; Blackwell and
Ballangarry 2023). This phenomenon led Martin and Miraboopa (2003) to
critique such '[terra nullius research]{.underline}'
[paradigms]{.underline} that [objectify]{.underline} Aboriginal peoples,
instead advocating for research frameworks grounded in
[Indigenous]{.underline} ways of knowing, as well as championing
indigenous intellectual sovereignty. Similarly, Brigg et al. (2022)
discuss Aboriginal Australian political ordering as a means through
which IR can reassess its own knowledge of inter-politic dynamics and
avoid the 'scholarly mining of [Indigenous]{.underline} philosophy for
dominant knowledge's own projects and preoccupations' (Brigg et al 2022,
909). For Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians,
[socio-political life is not ordered through]{.underline} **[Eurocentric
concepts]{.underline}** [such as]{.underline} **[state]{.underline}**
[or]{.underline} **[sovereignty]{.underline}**, [instead
people]{.underline} '**[express]{.underline}** their
**[autonomy]{.underline}** and regulate their selves [in relation
to]{.underline} the [Law]{.underline}, [Dreaming]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} their [accompanying relational-ecological
responsibilities to]{.underline} **[Country]{.underline}**,
**[kin]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[other-than-human
beings]{.underline}**' (Brigg et al. 2022, 904). In doing so, Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islanders draw their sense of responsibility from the
socio-ecological ties to Country and thus do not need a governing body
to enforce power relations such as dictated by traditional IR governance
(Brigg et al. 2021; Blackwell 2023). [Meaningful adoption]{.underline}
and reassessment [of]{.underline} **[IR]{.underline}** foundations
[with]{.underline} **[Indigenous knowledge]{.underline}**
[can]{.underline} thus foster the continued growth of research
communities and critical interdisciplinarity,
**[overhaul]{.underline}**ing the **[traditional
limitations]{.underline}** [instituted by]{.underline} **[disciplined
thinking]{.underline}** [and replacing it with]{.underline} **[broader
political possibilities]{.underline}** (Shaw 2002, 80).

Feminist voices within decolonial and Indigenous scholarship, likewise,
enrich our understanding of global power dynamics and resistance
strategies, often by providing an intersectional approach to
Indigeneity. [Black and Indigenous feminist scholarship highlights
how]{.underline} **[colonialism]{.underline}**,
**[patriarchy]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[racism]{.underline}**
**[intersect]{.underline}** to shape experiences of indigenous women and
voices both as subjects and researchers within the academy
(Moreton-Robinson 2015; Watson 2007, 2022; Simpson 2016; Meyer 2001).
Aileen Moreton-Robinson (2015), for example, discusses the concept of
'The [White]{.underline} Possessive' logic, whereby settler colonialism
operates through the appropriation of Indigenous lands, bodies, and
knowledges; 'the white possessive' is the discursive predisposition that
divides people based on gender and racial characteristics to create a
hierarchy of colonisation, ownership and dominance. Moreton-Robinson
(2015) argues that this [hierarchy]{.underline} ultimately
[underpins]{.underline} contemporary [understandings of nation states
and sovereignty]{.underline}. Furthermore, in Audra Simpson's (2016)
discussions of indigenous feminism and public policy in Canada, she
explores the concept of '[statehood]{.underline}' [as]{.underline} an
**[inherently masculine]{.underline}** and settler colonial [construct
that cannot]{.underline} '**[reconcile]{.underline}**' [its history
of]{.underline} **[colonial violences]{.underline}**, particular against
feminine Indigenous bodies. Ultimately, [engaging with Indigenous
scholarship shows how]{.underline} **[racialised]{.underline}** and
**[colonial hierarchies]{.underline}** consistently [arise from and
are]{.underline} **[strengthened by]{.underline}** [intersecting systems
of]{.underline} **[power]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[inequality]{.underline}** [within]{.underline} **[IR]{.underline}**,
thus emphasising the limitations of existing logics and centring
alternative epistemologies.

This reality does not come without insistence that perhaps [[Native
studies]{.mark} scholarship [has been overdetermined by a **focus on
land**]{.mark}]{.underline},8 as might likewise be true of scholarship
more broadly that is interested in environmental questions. [An
overwhelming **centralization of land** then comes to **determine
conceptually and theoretically** the bounds of several academic
fields]{.underline}. Scholars demonstrate how [[an **overemphasis**
in]{.mark} the terrestrial and in grounded, **[fixed units of
analysis]{.mark}** have [simplified the]{.mark} surface of [Earth
as]{.mark} something **[planar]{.mark} and [not]{.mark}
[volumetric]{.mark}.**]{.underline}9 Technologies like
[**[mapping]{.mark}**, **land [allotment]{.mark}**, **colonial
[borders]{.mark}**[, and **property rights** are]{.mark} [undergirded by
the]{.mark} imagined **[ability to measure land]{.mark}** definitively,
to define [and to separate]{.mark} one part of unmoving, **[static
earth]{.mark}** from another.]{.underline} The tools of [[land
measurement]{.mark} are compromised by their purported objectivity in
**[document]{.mark}ing [material in]{.mark} its
[totality]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Too often the [theoretical tools of
scholarship also [make]{.mark} [space]{.mark} and place [**flat**,
**passive**, or **geometric**]{.mark}.10 [Which]{.mark}, of course, [is
a **false oversimplification** of land.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Land as **flattened geometry** is just one part of the
issue.]{.underline} As Meredith Palmer argues, [[the metrics of
measuring]{.mark} [land are embroiled with]{.mark} histories of
**[anti-Indigenous racism]{.mark}**]{.underline} in what she calls "the
racist acre." 11 Colonial and [[imperial]{.mark} tools and [tactics of
**measuring and observing** land]{.mark} try [to make it]{.mark} into
**[inanimate]{.mark} materiality** [for capitalist **accumulation**,
**sacrifice**, and]{.mark} often [**abandonment** over]{.mark} and
against **[Indigenous relationships]{.mark}**.]{.underline}12 Max
Liboiron, following Sandra Styres and Dawn Zinga, has described that
process as one of making Land into land.13 In this formulation, [[Land
refers to "the **unique entity** that is the]{.mark} **combined living
[spirit]{.mark}** [of plants, animals, air, water, humans, histories,
and events **recognized by**]{.mark} **many [Indigenous
communities]{.mark}**.]{.underline} When land is not capitalized
\[land\] refers to the concept from a colonial worldview whereby
landscapes are common, universal, and everywhere, even with great
variation." 14 Capital L Land is relations; small l land is resource.
Tuck and McKenzie write correctly, then, that "Indigenous intellectual
contributions rarely fail to engage in issues of land and
place---especially via conceptualizations of tribal identity,
sovereignty, and treaty rights---yet when these discussions are taken up
by non-Indigenous and settler scholars, the saliency of land and place
is frequently left out of the picture." 15 Put another way, it is not
simply a problem that land is flattened into passive static space
through technology and narrative alike, but that [those
[flattenings]{.mark} are also the [overlook]{.mark}ing,
[undermin]{.mark}ing, [and]{.mark} an attempted **[seve]{.mark}ring of
[Native]{.mark} [sovereignties and relationships]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Staying attentive to the ways that land has been designated, measured,
surveilled, and documented through technologies that are anti-Indigenous
demonstrate the need by Native thinkers to continue to describe and
reclaim land relationalities in scholarship and in practice.16

Enactments of [[colonialism]{.mark} also [coerce Native peoples
to]{.mark} regard, discuss, and inter[act with land in]{.mark}
**strategic formulations.**]{.underline} Often, [those strategies are
**necessarily iterative**, as colonialism is as historical as it is a
contemporary project, maintaining and **making itself
anew**.]{.underline} [Native polities, communities, and individuals have
had to employ]{.underline} what Gayatri Spivak has called ["**[strategic
essentialism]{.mark}**" to keep homelands under Native
governance.]{.underline}17 [[This is not]{.mark} always [how
Native]{.mark} people may [want to]{.mark} formulate
[relat]{.mark}ionships [to their land]{.mark}s.]{.underline} Federal and
state sponsored colonial projects are often beyond the control and
purview of Native peoples, communities, and polities, such as allotment
and property-making, identity regimes of blood quantum calculations,
removal and relocation from homelands, theft of children and placement
into boarding schools, pollution, and environmental racism. These are
all [[colonial land relations]{.mark} that most often
[require]{.mark}(d) [**military force** and]{.mark} simultaneous if not
subsequential **[bureaucratic violence]{.mark}s**.]{.underline} As
Michelle Daigle has written, "Theorizations of colonial conquest,
resistance, and liberation require interrogations of the fixed
spatialities and temporalities that Indigenous peoples continue to be
relegated to discursively and materially." 18

[[Tied]{.mark} centrally [to]{.mark} these claims of Native [Indigenous
rights is the murki]{.mark}ness which characterized Native [land
rights]{.mark}.]{.underline} Already poorly defined by the state within
a settler colonial discourse, this subject of land ownership was further
complicated by the induction of Alaska underneath the federal umbrella.
Native Inupiat peoples understood this clearly as an extension of the
settler colonial attitudes of the federal government. One quote from the
inaugural Inupiat Patiot made these issues plain: [We were told that
[if]{.mark} [the government reserved our]{.mark} aboriginal
[land]{.mark} for us, [we]{.mark} could not be citizens of the United
States- could not vote-[would be tied]{.mark} on reservation [like a
dog]{.mark}-could not have business come on our land or sell products of
our land. [That was a lie]{.mark} told to us Inupiat [to take away
our]{.mark} aboriginal [lands and mineral
rights.]{.mark}]{.underline}174 Faced with such issues the Indigenous
Alaskans continued to play an active role in the protest of their
dispossession. The demands of the Native Alaskan advocacy groups,
environmental groups, and combined organized political activism worked
to secure land rights and ballooned the federal economic development
budgets with all the necessary safeguards for various federal projects,
like oil pipeline construction.175 Conservation societies such as the
Sierra Club and the Alaskan Conservation Society ran articles in support
of protesting nuclear experimentation on the North Slope. The Wilderness
Society's director Dr. Olaus Marie penned an objection to the continued
use of wilderness spaces as ideal testing grounds, he wrote stating that
Project Chariot and other military experiments were deliberately chosen
["[Why then are]{.mark} such [areas]{.mark} [chosen]{.mark} for this
atomic playing- The Ocean, Nevada, and [Alaska?]{.mark} [Because they
are]{.mark} considered [waste]{.mark} places; places [where it doesn't
matter]{.mark} what damage is done to wildlife or the few people
there."176 Indigenous Alaskan peoples voiced their opposition in summit
meetings, through transnational networks of conservation and community
outreach, and through legitimizing their community and distinct cultural
values within the existing state avenues that came to dominate the
Alaskan landscape.]{.underline}

LAW AND THE JURIDICAL

Scholarship and research about federal Indian law animates much of
Native studies. [[Law is where]{.mark} land, its **dispossession**, and
[**colonial land relations** unfold]{.mark} and continue to be
enacted]{.underline}. Again, and more importantly, [[Native
communities]{.mark} [have their **own legal systems**]{.mark}, legal
obligations, protocols, and practices that both predate colonial contact
and have been [shaped]{.mark}, maintained, and revised [in relation
to]{.mark} **gendered [colonial]{.mark} encroachment and
[dispossession]{.mark}**.]{.underline}21 Native peoples' social
organization and political structures are vast and diverse and preexist
any other form of current federal or state systems of law. Native
studies analyses recognize this reality and are also interested in the
important ongoing problematics of signed, broken, and unhonored
treaties; land cessions; allotment; the theft of Native children from
Native families; murdered, missing Indigenous women and girls (mmiwg);
and myriad land and water claims processes. [[To make]{.mark} claims to
[land **legible to colonial governments**, Native people]{.mark}(s)
[were]{.mark} often [forced]{.mark} and coerced [to articulate
themselves]{.mark} and their relationships to land [in ways]{.mark} that
were deemed **satisfactorily [recognizable]{.mark}** as
Indigenous.]{.underline} [These **regimes of recognition** continue into
the contemporary moment as some tribes continue to seek federal
recognition]{.underline}.22 Through this centuries-long process,
[**[colonial courts]{.mark}** have created a politics of recognition
that [require Native people]{.mark}s [to **adhere to**]{.mark} **a
definition of [fixedness]{.mark}** in space [and a]{.mark} long-standing
temporal and [**material attachment** to land]{.mark}.]{.underline}23

[[Land must be made recognizable]{.mark} and legible [alongside]{.mark}
formations of [indigeneity and race]{.mark}, [which]{.mark} often
**[excludes entities like ice]{.mark}**, river, and ocean.]{.underline}
[[**Settler legal systems** require a]{.mark}n articulated **rootedness
and [fixedness in place]{.mark}**, [countering]{.mark} many
**[Native]{.mark} origin [stories and cosmologies]{.mark}** that include
ice, water, ocean, and migrations across and between]{.underline},24 as
well as ongoing Indigenous mobilities.25 Moreover, [the [legal
legibility]{.mark} that [requires **stasis and sedentarism**]{.mark}
simultaneously necessitates]{.underline} Western forms of cultivation
and agriculture through fertile soil and ground in which to
root---[[something that **ice**]{.mark} **geographies [cannot
lend]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [Indigenous peoples must be made **legible
through settler law**, and so must land, and that rendering legible of
land and peoples are related processes]{.underline}. The articulation of
land, race, and political subjectivity through law iterated in documents
like treaties and land claims settlements later shape how ice and
Indigenous peoples who live with or near ice are juridically understood
or misunderstood. The strategic deployments of land can have deleterious
consequences for peoples of water and ice who aim to use similar legal
avenues toward care of relations.

The strategic, and often necessary, utilization of accepted colonial
interpretation of what counts as land and land relations has resulted in
keeping some homelands intact, yet it is not without consequences. As
Goeman writes,

[To claim [land]{.mark}, it is [set up through]{.mark} the
[court]{.mark} system[s]{.mark} that we [must **claim difference from
settlers**. In]{.mark} our [pursuit to **differentiate**]{.mark}
**ourselves** [from settler colonists, we]{.mark} have [territorialized
land and body]{.mark}.]{.underline} The legal tensions between stability
and static versus change, adaptation, and growth are very real for
indigenous people. They are in a particularly difficult political
situation in which recognition of cultural and racial uniqueness is
detrimental to the overall physical and cultural survival of indigenous
people.26

These kinds of [[land relations framed through a **categorical
difference from whiteness**]{.mark} as enforced and determined by
settler law are at once the mechanism that allows Native peoples to
claim their land and also [creates **harm in an identification**]{.mark}
of self and community.]{.underline} The original moment of articulating
difference from colonists to make claims to homeland is not a singular
event. [This difference must be [**reiterated over time** to
maintain]{.mark} [access]{.mark} to land and things like treaty rights.
Legal relationships to land are also **not homogenous**.]{.underline}

[[The opportunity to legally claim difference]{.mark} from colonists as
precedent for land claims and land rights, such as [in
**Alaska**]{.mark}]{.underline}, Hawaii, and in many places in
California, **[[does not always exist]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In many
places, no treaties were signed, and there is no legal or priority
access for Native peoples to their land relations. [[In Alaska]{.mark},
legal [conflict over]{.mark} what are called "**subsistence
rights**"]{.underline} (access to whaling, fishing, hunting, and
gathering) [continues into the contemporary moment]{.underline}. [When
Alaska Native people demonstrated and lobbied for their [subsistence
rights]{.mark}, those rights [were]{.mark} [denied]{.mark} by state
legislature [as **unconstitutional, race-based
privileges**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Herein lies one dimension of the
problematic identified by Goeman: [when [rights]{.mark} are [articulated
through racial difference]{.mark} in settler courts, they [can]{.mark}
also [be]{.mark} **[denied on those]{.mark} same
[grounds]{.mark}**.]{.underline} However, [in the case of Alaska, the
denial of subsistence rights flies in the face of subsistence access
legally falling under the auspices of federal Indian law, not a
state-level decision]{.underline}.27

[[Anti-Indigeneity that]{.mark} operates to [**remove Native peoples
from their lands** continues]{.mark} the need [to]{.mark} further
**[centralize]{.mark} the importance of
[land]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} This need, unfortunately, also
potentially minimizes conceptual space allowed for water and ice and an
analysis of how these elements cannot come into categorial formation in
ways that land is afforded. Put another way, [the colonial category of
[land as **easily measured** or **captured by tech**]{.mark}**nology
[and law]{.mark}** can [disallow]{.mark} other categories and
**[relations, like water and ice]{.mark}**, to be claimed.]{.underline}
Thus, [[Native studies must]{.mark} continue to [support]{.mark} Native
polities' processes of [**land reclamation** while]{.mark}
simultaneously [contesting the legitimacy of]{.mark} settler-[colonial
governments to **determine such meanings**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
urgency within the field toward land reflects the urgency of the
politics on the ground. The feedback loop of land relations, land theft,
land rights, land claims, land back, land scholarship is a loop
precisely because of the ongoing elements of land dispossession and
enacted coloniality. Moreover, because of the precarity around land
dispossession and the need to continually articulate land relations in
forms legible to settler courts, scholarship in Native studies that
pushes inquiries around reframing land differently can be read as
dangerous and potentially against grounded movements. With this
important reality in mind, I worry about the colonial grounding of the
concept of land that forces it to carry everything we ask it to. We need
to blur the boundaries of these orderings and categories.

### Link---Marine Resources---1NC/2NC

#### Development of marine resources hurts Indigenous land access, health, and livelihoods.

Interaction Between International Human Rights Law and the Law of the
Sea*, Routledge, <https://doi.org/10.4324/9781003242772-2> \[AY\]

[Coastal indigenous peoples face, inter alia, two main challenges with
respect to maintaining their connection with their traditionally used
marine areas and resources. The first challenge relates to the lack of
recognition of indigenous peoples' customary rights to marine space and
associated resources by many coastal States]{.underline}.39 In certain
limited circumstances, where States and domestic courts have shown a
willingness to recognize indigenous customary rights to the sea, such
rights have been framed narrowly and interpreted restrictively.40
Particularly, States remain unwilling to recognize rights of an
exclusive nature and the harvesting of MLRs for commercial purposes.41
This, in turn, has led to the continuing neglect and marginalization of
the deeply embedded relationship that indigenous peoples have with the
sea and its significance to their cultural identity and spirituality.
This tendency of States to reject indigenous claims in relation to
marine spaces and resources stems primarily from a fundamental
conceptual divide between the dominant Western (Eurocentric) view42 --
which draws a clear distinction between terrestrial and marine areas --
and an indigenous perspective which does not distinguish between such
geographical features.43 [Indigenous worldviews of land and sea 'are not
terrestrially bound (terra-centric)'.44 Instead, indigenous peoples see
their traditional territories holistically as the sum of continental
lands, coastal areas, islands, and all traditionally used marine
environments.45 For marine-oriented indigenous peoples, 'land and sea
space are integrated within systems of customary tenure, local
knowledge, and resource use and management']{.underline}.46

[In contrast, States tend to view continental lands and territories as
capable of giving rise to private/communal property rights]{.underline},
including ownership and possession, [while the seas and the associated
resources are considered to be public commons]{.underline}.47 In this
regard, Jackson states that 'while the land has been seen . . . as
layered with proprietary rights, use rights and cultural symbols, [the
\[sea\] has been seen as empty' -- empty because of the Western cultural
construction of the sea as being not subject to any such rights.48 This
binary, statist conception of marine space has considerably undermined
indigenous peoples' customary rights to the sea and the associated
resources, as well as their traditional laws that govern marine
space]{.underline}.

The second challenge, which partly follows from the first, relates to
the increasing pressure coming from non-indigenous economic actors and
State interventions. These challenges, amongst others, stem from various
marine resource development (exploration and exploitation) related
activities and environmental measures, which involve the allocation or
re-allocation of rights to access, control, or use of ocean space and
associated resources away from coastal indigenous communities. These
measures take different shapes and forms.

First, [indigenous traditional fishing grounds and MLRs are increasingly
becoming the subject of competing claims from commercial fishing
activities through the process of privatization of ocean space and
fisheries]{.underline}.49 Privatization initiatives, such as individual
transferable quotas (ITQs) in their different variations,50 involve the
private allocation of rights to access, use, and control marine
resources with little concern for existing customary marine tenure
systems and management practices.51 While developed on the assumption
that introducing private property rights systems in fisheries will solve
the problem of overfishing,52 these [liberal rights-based approaches
have led to the exclusion of coastal indigenous communities and
small-scale fishers 'by concentrating fishing rights in the hands of few
"sea lords" or "armchair fishermen" who own and lease the
quota'.]{.underline}53 The fish farming industry (commercial
aqua(mari)culture) is another factor that controls fisheries resources
at the expense of the coastal indigenous peoples who depend on such
resources.54 Many States have promoted aqua(mari)culture as a rational
response to a growing demand for fish due to the unsustainability of
wild capture fisheries.55 The UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food
has applauded 'the impressive growth of aquaculture' as one means to
ensure food security in response to 'the stagnating wild-capture
fisheries'.56 However, [aqua(mari)culture in coastal areas conflicts
with the traditional fishing rights of indigenous communities, as such
fish farms are usually located on or close to the traditional fishing
grounds of indigenous communities.57 As such, aqua(mari)culture may lead
to the displacement of coastal indigenous communities or to the
pollution of their traditional fishing grounds due to the release of
hazardous waste]{.underline}.58 With the rapid growth of intensive
commercial aquaculture for species with high export value, such as
salmon and shrimp, this potential future threat to coastal indigenous
communities around the globe will likely continue.

Second, [opening ocean space to extractive industrial developments, such
as in/offshore oil and gas activities, mineral extraction, and marine
renewable energy development (MRE),59 creates further threats for
traditional user coastal indigenous communities around the world and
disturbs their ties to the oceans and MLRs.60 Oil, gas, and MRE
development activities require exclusive occupation in large areas of
the sea close to shore where most of the traditional activities by
indigenous communities, such as traditional fishing, take place.61
Industrial oil, gas, and mineral exploration and extraction activities
also dispose of waste in the fishing grounds of indigenous
communities]{.underline}, thereby causing harm to the marine resources
upon which those communities depend.62 As such, there is a high
potential for conflict between [these industrial activities]{.underline}
and the customary rights of coastal indigenous communities in the sense
that they [cause a 'significant challenge to the rights of indigenous
communities to fish and navigate their waters and manage their own
marine environment']{.underline}.63

Third, increasing shipping activities -- including merchant ships and
ships operating in seaborn tourism (cruise ships) -- through or close to
traditional fishing grounds of indigenous communities has a number of
adverse effects.64 [Indigenous communities perceive navigation as an
unacceptable risk of pollution or a risk to their traditional means of
transportation, communication, and harvesting activities]{.underline}.65
For example, [icebreaker traffic may accelerate the break-up of the sea
ice]{.underline}, thereby [causing the destruction of habitats and
limiting the safe use of sea ice by indigenous peoples of the Arctic
region]{.underline}.66 [Increased shipping also threatens indigenous
food security through oil and chemical spills, marine mammal strikes and
disturbances, and the introduction of invasive species from ballast
water discharges]{.underline}.67

Fourth, the implementation of various forms of [area-based management
tools and conservation measures]{.underline}, such as the establishment
of marine protected areas (MPAs), also [affect indigenous communities by
evicting them from their traditionally owned coastal areas]{.underline},
by [restricting access to their traditional fishing]{.underline}
grounds, [or]{.underline} by [excluding them from the decision-making
process regarding the management of marine resources]{.underline}.68
Even though the establishment of [MPAs]{.underline} (with the intention
to conserve and restore endangered marine resources and their habitats)
is commendable, they [may become a form of enclosure that serves as a
means of controlling the ocean and its resources under the guise of
environmental protection -- excluding indigenous peoples and depriving
them of their livelihood]{.underline}.69 Farran rightly observes that
[indigenous peoples are 'increasingly vulnerable to what might be
described as a race for "blue planet credentials"]{.underline} among
nation-states eager to demonstrate their positive contribution to saving
the planet by protecting its oceans'.70 The [focus on marine
environmental protection and fisheries conservation measures may render
the human rights impacts of MPAs on coastal indigenous communities
invisible or the subject of little attention]{.underline}.

The ongoing Sámi resistance against green colonialism has contributed to
a paradigm shift from the green to just green transition in Arctic
social sciences. Meanwhile, another large change,
[**[remilitarisation]{.mark}** [and **securitisation** of the
Arctic]{.mark} region, has gone **[largely unaddressed]{.mark}**
[despite]{.mark}]{.underline} the fact that it, too, has a potentially
[**very [large]{.mark}** [impact]{.mark} [on]{.mark} **[land]{.mark}
[use]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} regional **[development]{.mark}** in the
Arctic]{.underline}. The change is particularly visible in Sápmi and the
northernmost parts of Norway, Sweden and Finland, whose [**[geopolitical
positioning]{.mark}** has **[shifted]{.mark}**
**[drastically]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the context of the Russian
invasion of Ukraine. Especially following Sweden and Finland's NATO
memberships and the Defense Cooperation Agreements (DCAs) with the US,
this area has [[become]{.mark} a [**hot spot** of military training and
**build-up**]{.mark}. [From]{.mark} the **[US]{.mark}** and NATO
military [points of view]{.mark}, [the]{.mark} Nordic cross-border
[region]{.mark} now [forms]{.mark} one single [area]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[operation]{.mark} [that has **high strategic
value**]{.mark}]{.underline}, not only due to its vicinity to Russia but
also by virtue of its Northern and Arctic dimensions. Rather than
peripheric borderlands of the Nordic nation-states, Sápmi and the Nordic
High North is at the heart of the "global Artic" that is thoroughly
immersed in global flows and tensions and subject to considerable
extractive interest (e.g., Finger and Rekvig eds., 2022).
[**[Militarisation]{.mark}** is commonly defined [as]{.mark} the
**[material]{.mark} [and discursive]{.mark}** [process]{.mark}
[whereby]{.mark} a [society]{.mark} [organises]{.mark} [itself]{.mark}
**[ideologically]{.mark}** [and materially around]{.mark} the idea of
[war]{.mark} [as]{.mark} a [way]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
**[protecting]{.mark} its [sovereignty]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
security (e.g., Vastapuu et al., 2024; Lutz, 2002). [A **[decolonial
perspective]{.mark}** on militarisation [centre]{.mark}s
[attention]{.mark} especially [on]{.mark} **[military land
use]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Junka-Aikio, 2024a; 2024b). Military land
use [[can mean]{.mark}, for instance, [construction]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[military **bases**]{.mark} and barracks, **[radar stations]{.mark}**,
[weapons storage]{.mark} facilities, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} using
land or fencing it off for the purpose of military
[[training]{.underline}]{.mark}. More widely, military land use also
[[includes]{.mark} roads, railways, airports and harbours that are
needed for the [movement]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [troops]{.mark} [or]{.mark}
for the security of [supply]{.mark},]{.underline} or population centres
and settlements that emerge in response to the housing and service needs
of militaries. [Rather than merely serving militaries, military land use
[has]{.mark} [**far-reaching impacts** on society]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
the **[environment]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Accordingly, geographer
Rachel Woodward (2004) speaks about military geographies to highlight
its role in shaping societies through spatial organisation. [Military
geographies [produce]{.mark} certain kinds of spaces, places,
environments, landscapes, [connections]{.mark} [and]{.mark}]{.underline}
chains, facilitating particular subjects, futures and forms of regional
[development]{.mark} while overriding others.Historically, military
geographies are [[**deeply entangled** with **colonialism** and
**imperialism**]{.mark}. [In]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [Arctic]{.mark}, the
connection was [particularly]{.mark} [clear]{.mark} [during]{.mark} the
[Cold War]{.mark} [which turned the region into]{.mark} a [hot spot
of]{.mark} the **[nuclear]{.mark} arms [race]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Vladimirova, 2024; Bernauer, 2018; Lockenbauer and Farrish, 2007). For
instance, [[in]{.mark} [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} Canada, Indigenous
[[lands]{.mark} that, [until then]{.mark}, had [remained]{.mark}
[beyond]{.mark} solid [state control]{.mark} [due]{.mark} [to]{.mark}
the cold and demanding environment were **[territorialised]{.mark}** as
sites of [military]{.mark} training and preparation [through]{.mark}
massive [investment]{.mark} [in]{.mark} transport
[infrastructures]{.mark}]{.underline} such as the Alaska Highway, the
network of airports serving the Canadian and Alaskan military forces,
and an extensive system of radar stations (Distant Early Warning Line,
DEW). [These infrastructures brought large numbers of settlers to the
region, resulting in the establishment of new population centres [across
Indigenous lands]{.mark}.]{.underline} Noise and pollution from military
training and low-flying aircraft disturbed people and animals,
over-hunting and fishing became issues, and new livelihoods challenged
traditional ones. Although some of the infrastructure has, since then,
become a lifeline for the region's Indigenous communities, at the time,
they [[drove]{.mark} [**settler colonial** land **appropriation** and
**assimilation**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bernauer, 2018; Lockenbauer and
Farrish, 2007). Today, Sápmi and the Nordic High North exist at the
centre of Arctic military geographies. The change is most visible in the
arrival of foreign troops and a steep increase in large international
military exercises that are organised across civilian and
civilian-military areas. In Northern Finland, international interest in
military training is currently so high that it cannot be met, according
to the Finnish Defence Forces (De Fresnes and Martikainen, 2023).
Militaries consider Northern Finland particularly attractive because of
its supposed "emptiness" and due to the Arctic environment, which allows
training for Arctic warfare (Junka-Aikio, 2024a; 2024b; De Fresnes and
Martikainen, 2023). In local Finnish and national media, the massive
increase in military training and presence has so far been represented
mainly in highly positive terms. Militaries are expected to bring
economic opportunities and investments and boost regional development
(Pylkkänen, 2023; Lapin Kansa, 2024).Rarely discussed, however, is what
kind of development militarisation brings to the Northern regions, for
whom, and at what cost. What is the impact of these new military
geographies on the environment and on traditional livelihoods, and how
does the arrival of troops affect local life? [Likewise,
**[missing]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} **public [debate]{.mark}**
[is]{.mark} the fact that much of the training takes place in Sápmi.,
where the Nordic states have a responsibility under national legislation
and international law to respect Sámi **[Indigenous rights]{.mark}** and
self-determination, [and]{.mark} to negotiate with the Sámi on any land
use that may have a considerable [impact on]{.mark} Sámi [**culture**
and **livelihoods**]{.mark}]{.underline}.Although few people in the
Nordics, the Sámi included, currently dispute the need to strengthen
military defence, the Sámi Parliaments and the Saami Council have
already expressed concern over militarisation's broader impact on Sámi
rights and culture. The UNDRIP Article 30 particularly [cautions against
the [military use of Indigenous lands]{.mark} without proper
consultation]{.underline}, and there are growing worries, especially
among Sámi reindeer herders, over the damage that extensive military
training, noise, traffic and installations cause to reindeer pastures,
reindeer work, and reindeer wellbeing (Junka-Aikio, 2024b). Unless these
concerns are properly addressed, there is a great chance that the
ongoing efforts to boost national security end up producing significant
insecurity for the Sámi.Whether the Nordic states and Defence Forces
understand their legal responsibilities to the Sámi, and whether they
are ready to apply them in the present context of strong military
alliances, is a question that merits close attention. For instance,
Finland's Defence Cooperation Agreement (DCA) with the United States was
drafted in complete secrecy and without hearing the Sámi at all, despite
the Agreement also designating an area within the Sámi homeland region
(Ivalo Border Guard Base) for US use. Like anyone else, representatives
of the Sámi Parliament learned about the Agreement's contents for the
first time from the news a couple of days before the Agreement was
signed (Paltto, 2024). In addition to an increase in military training
and presence, militarisation reshapes land use on the level of transport
and other infrastructures, which are planned increasingly in response to
the stated interests of military defence and security, rather than a
broader vision of regional social and economic development and
future.The recent decision by the Regional Council of Lapland (Lapin
liitto) to add a new road that would cut across the Hammastunturi
wilderness area through the Sámi village of Kuttura in Lapland's new
transport strategy is a case in point. The Kuttura-Repojoentie road
connection was proposed for the first time in 2009, at the time driven
especially by the tourism sector which sought to establish an east-west
connection between two major tourist destinations, Levi and Saariselkä.
However, the proposal was rejected due to strong opposition from Kuttura
villagers, local environmental groups, reindeer herders, and other
locals who worried about its impact on the reindeer pastures, cultural
landscape, and the environment. Although these same groups and the Sámi
Parliament still oppose its construction, the new transport strategy
gave it the green light, this time in response to a request by the
Defence Forces and justified in the name of 'national security'. As with
the green transition, [**[militarisation]{.mark}** [reframes]{.mark}
[Sápmi]{.mark} [as]{.mark} a **[sacrificial zone]{.mark}**
[where]{.mark} local and **[Indigenous]{.mark} [concerns]{.mark}** may
be **[sidelined]{.mark}**, [in the name of]{.mark} some broader
[objectives]{.mark} [presented]{.mark} [as]{.mark} **[urgent]{.mark}**
[and **indispensable** for **national security**]{.mark}, safety, and
the common good.Examples such as these highlight how militarism and
[militarisation]{.mark} [challenge]{.mark} **[democratic
participation]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} Indigenous and **[minority]{.mark}
[rights]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In addition to [[setting]{.mark}
[up]{.mark} a strict **[hierarchy]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[security]{.mark}** needs, [discourses]{.mark} of militarisation tend
[to]{.mark} [**centre** public authority]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[on]{.underline}]{.mark} (usually **[[male]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
military [[personnel]{.underline}]{.mark} and [points of view
[and]{.mark} **[portray]{.mark} [military concerns]{.mark}** [as
**existential**]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} [therefore]{.mark}
[outside]{.mark} public [scrutiny]{.mark} and democratic
[debate]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., Vastapuu et al., 2024). In the
Nordics, militarisation has been [[supported by]{.mark} the swift return
of classical, [**state-centred** discourses on]{.mark}
[geopolitics]{.mark} and security.]{.underline} Despite broad efforts to
expand the meaning and subjects of security over recent decades,
[through academic [and **policy frameworks** such as]{.mark}
environmental and **[human security]{.mark}**]{.underline},
comprehensive security or planetary politics (e.g., Heininen, 2023;
Hoogensen Gjørv et al., 2014; Nicol, 2019; Greaves, 2016; Patrick,
2021), today Nordic public and [[**policy debates** centre]{.mark} again
**[overwhelmingly]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} hard security which stresses
**[military capabilities]{.mark}**, security of supply, [and]{.mark}
[state **control of land**]{.mark} and natural resources. The
**[hegemonisation]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} such [discourse]{.mark}s is
[visible]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the fact that now even renewable energy
**[development]{.mark}**]{.underline} and mining in Sápmi and the High
North is [[justified]{.mark} [and **advanced**]{.mark}
**[increasingly]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} [reference to]{.mark} the need to
end EU dependency on **[Russia]{.mark}**n oil and gas, [and]{.mark} to
boost critical mineral self-sufficiency vis-à-vis
**[China]{.mark}**]{.underline}, rather than efforts to save the planet
and the environment.In such a discursive environment, Sámi concerns over
military land use can be very hard to articulate, even when such land
use threatens Sámi livelihoods in ways that may be considered, from the
perspective of [**[Sámi peoplehood and future]{.mark},** as **[equally
existential]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Today, anyone who resists or
critiques the expansion of land use justified in the name of military
and hard security also risks being seen as unpatriotic, naive, or even a
threat to national security. For now, few people in Sápmi seem willing
to take such a position publicly, either due to the fear of social and
political stigma or because they, too, may feel divided over a situation
in which their own wellbeing and future as Sámi seems to be pitted
against security and safety for all (see, for instance Tarkiainen,
forthcoming). In addition, a number of Sámi activists and political
influencers whom I have interviewed on both the Finnish and Norwegian
sides of Sápmi have highlighted the need to be strategic and to choose
one's battles. The Sámi already have their hands full protecting their
livelihoods from other threats and forms of land use, such as tourism,
logging, and the green transition. As one of my interviewees on the
Norwegian side put it, "no-one wants to end up in a conflict with the
Defence Forces, because it is obvious, who would win that battle"

2 \| FROM 'NATURAL REGION' TO ICE CORE AND NOW 'ATLANTIFICATION'

As scholars of the Arctic have noted, [[a dominant discursive
formation]{.mark} which continues to [frame the Arctic]{.mark} as a
circumpolar region is one characterised by reference to cold climate and
frozen environment]{.underline} (for example, Bloom, 1993; Grace, 2000).
For the last 15 years, there has been a steady production of articles,
books, documentaries and films purporting to track and trace
transformatons of the changing Arctic. [There has been a relentless
quest to identify a 'New Arctic', which is characterised [by]{.mark}
excessive **[change to ice]{.mark}**, ocean and air]{.underline} (for
instance, Evengård et al., 2015). [Physical change is [**held
responsible** for]{.mark} stimulating more **[extraction]{.mark}**, more
[**mobility** and]{.mark} more **[governance]{.mark}**. What gets lost
in]{.underline} these sweeping overviews [are two fundamental
things]{.underline}. First, as Ruiz et al. (2019) note, [is]{.underline}
'Making sense of **[[ice]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[and we would add land,
ocean, air\] [[is **not just**]{.mark} **a [material]{.mark} question**,
[but involves]{.mark} ideas rooted across past, present, and future
**[socio-cultural contexts]{.mark}** and environmental
experiences']{.underline} (Ruiz et al., 2019, p. 8). [The role of
[ice]{.mark} in the human history of the Arctic **[varies in meaning and
significance]{.mark}**; so making sense of loss [will]{.mark} itself
**[reveal different ontologies and epistemologies]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Gearheard et al., 2013). Second, the power of story-telling remains
profoundly asymmetric. [Recent calls for [research in]{.mark}to
[the]{.mark} '[Arctic]{.mark} Anthropocene' [reveal]{.mark} yet again a
fondness for [thinking of]{.mark} the [polar regions as]{.mark}
**'[laboratories']{.mark}** for non-polar audiences [to]{.mark}
**[extract]{.mark}**, **[observe]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**[process]{.mark}** from afar]{.underline} (for example, Finger, 2016).
[[Indigenous]{.mark} and northern [communities]{.mark} have been
**[telling their]{.mark} own [stories]{.mark}** for millennia but still
have to [fight to be heard in a region]{.mark} that so often has been
[framed]{.mark} by outsiders [as a]{.mark} blank, people-less
[void]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[As]{.mark} volumetric [ice became]{.mark} '**quantifiable
[data]{.mark}**[']{.mark} [it]{.mark}]{.underline} encouraged
conversation across disciplines such as climatology and oceanography
(Elzinga, 2017). Ice core research became less about the localised
extraction of ice from ice sheets and instead [[was]{.mark}
[rendered]{.mark} data to be **interpreted** [as]{.mark} global [climate
info]{.mark}rmation and **planetary story-telling**]{.underline}. Thus,
climate modelling in the 1960s and 1970s made the Arctic 'global' and
trans-national far before the term was being used as a shorthand to
describe the growing interest from Asian countries in Arctic geopolitics
and governance (Sorlin & Lajus, 2014; Woon & Dodds, 2020). The
cryosphere became in short 'portable', in ways that earlier maps and
forms of aesthetic media had previously provided, such as through early
photographs, paintings and drawings of glaciers and icefields by early
colonial explorers, travellers and tourists to northern spaces. While
ice had been considered portable, even pocket size through a photograph
or drawing, the technology of ice coring and the infrastructure built to
keep ice cores frozen created a new terrain of the volumetric space of
ice and the data it contains (Antonello & Carey, 2017). Ice data became
part and parcel of computerised climate modelling, intra-proxy
environmental research (for example, pollen, tree rings), and
geo-chronological analyses of human and non-human climate forcing
(Cosgrove, 2008; Achermann, 2020).

In addition to the ice core, [there has been no shortage of endeavors to
**document the Arctic**\'s frozen earth and sea ice]{.underline},
ranging from nineteenth century Russian surveying of permafrost in
eastern Siberia to elaborate monitoring of drifting sea ice during the
International Geophysical Year (1957--8). While these exercises were
informed by scientific labouring, both permafrost and sea ice attracted
an array of other stakeholders, including engineers and industrialists
(Brunn, 2020). These scientific stakeholders were charged with planning
Russian and then Soviet agricultural and industrial development on the
one hand. On the other hand, Soviet and American military planners were
desperate to better understand the sea ice dynamics of the Arctic Ocean.
Submarine operations during the Cold War depended in large part on
having an up-to-date compendium of data on sea ice distribution and
thickness (Roberts, 2015). [[One]{.mark} main [intent]{.mark} of such
mapping projects [was to create knowledge]{.mark} sets [about
ice]{.mark} as a dynamic, transitional materiality [that]{.mark} could
either **[help or hinder]{.mark}** movements of **[military and
capital]{.mark}**, buoying [or]{.mark} tanking [colonial]{.mark}
nation-[state **financial interests**]{.mark}.]{.underline} What links
nineteenth century Russian exploration of eastern Siberia and
mid-twentieth century sea ice mapping is a sense that the Arctic\'s cold
qualities were sufficiently enduring to necessitate academic, financial
and infrastructural investigation and investment (Herzberg
et al., 2018). Such was the scale and extent of frozen ground in Russia
and sea ice in the Arctic Ocean that the Arctic could be routinely
framed as a place of frustration due to the unruliness of ice in
complicating Euro-Western exploration, exploitation, industrial
development and trade, as well as acting as a buffer and at times
barrier to the shrinking of space--time as movements of capital are
enacted (Chu, 2020)

As research connects the global cryosphere to debates about the
Anthropocene, the affordances provided by Arctic and Antarctic ice
became increasingly recognised and celebrated as integral to seasonal
regularity, shaping the wider benefit to the earth\'s (human)
inhabitants that have come to depend upon it since the Little Ice Age.
As scholars of ice have noted, the last 150 years have been
extraordinarily dependent on relationships and entanglements with
artificial and natural frozen water (Dodds, 2018; Heidbrink, 2020). In
the nineteenth century a global ice trade flourished involving the
extraction and transportation of Arctic glacial, river and lake ice that
connected, for example, Alaska to California and Norway to the United
Kingdom. These global movements also demonstrate the role of ice in
fulfilling the need of certain racialised bodies to 'keep cool' in
tropical geographies, which signals and shapes oppressive interfaces
between colonial actors and Indigenous peoples, between the metropole
and the colony (Hobart, 2022). In this way, ice can act as both a
deterrent to movements of empire and colonialism in the Arctic and
Antarctic while also demonstrating aesthetics of colonial comfort of ice
as a comestible transported from the hinterlands. If tropical heat is
disorienting, and ice a mediating factor in providing stability and
comfort for temperate bodies and agents of colonialism, here ice can be
understood as a buffer, something that George Orwell reflected upon in
his ruminations about life in colonial Burma, entitled Burmese Days
(Orwell, 1934).

In the twentieth century, scientific interest in the Arctic, especially
the island of Greenland, grew markedly as climate research began to
shift its attention away from natural variability towards the
perturbative role of human agency. [[The Arctic proved]{.mark} itself to
be strategically [significant to colonial]{.mark}-capitalist
**[militaristic endeavours]{.mark}** and initiatives]{.underline} during
World War II and the appropriately named Cold War. [[What connects the
three]{.mark} developments [is]{.mark} the role and value of [ice:
as]{.mark} **[commodity]{.mark}**, as [**locatable** and
**portable**]{.mark} scientific object, as substance [that
challenged]{.mark} **conventional [military tactics]{.mark}** [and
**domain awareness**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Simultaneously,
civil-military resourcing [could [also enable]{.mark} the material
presence of [**scientific stations** dedicated to **ice coring
and**]{.mark} **ice [surveying]{.mark}** in the Arctic and
Antarctic]{.underline}. [[Domain awareness was]{.mark} not restricted to
land, sea and air]{.underline}. Going 'underground' had its advantages;
[scientists were [eager to discover]{.mark} more about **[what lay
underneath ice]{.mark} sheets** and glaciers while militaries
experimented with plans to hide infrastructure including missile
installations under those same ice bodies.]{.underline} The toxic
remains of such military projects and plans are easily found across
Arctic spaces. [As the ice harvester, [the scientist and]{.mark} the
soldier/naval [officer]{.mark} quickly [discovered what
Indigenous]{.mark} people [have]{.mark} **already long [known and
experienced]{.mark}**[, ice is]{.mark} **highly [dynamic]{.mark}**,
[**shape-shifting** and]{.mark} capable of **frustrating**, **blocking**
and **[resisting]{.mark}** human designs.]{.underline} As Michael Bravo
has alerted us, there is a cryo-politics to all of this (Bravo, 2017).

In this moment of late modernity, however, the Arctic now comes to
matter differently on the main stage and through the main stream.
[[Now]{.mark}, [scholars]{.mark}, scientists, activists and journalists
[report]{.mark} that there is **[too little ice]{.mark}**, too much
glacial retreat, and insufficient frozen terrain]{.underline} (Balog,
2012). [[Ice]{.mark} is **[no longer perform]{.mark}ing** [as a]{.mark}
reliable [buffer]{.mark}]{.underline}---containing subsurface carbon
stores, reflecting heat, and preserving the frigidity of polar waters.
[[Nor is]{.mark} ice performing as [a]{.mark} constant or consistent
[barrier]{.mark}. Whereas earlier dominant refrains regarding the Arctic
discussed it as an **obstacle**, if anything useful to comment upon at
all, now Arctic ice as it drastically transforms shape and viscosity
receives more press than ever.]{.underline} If the Arctic was largely
ignored and overlooked in previous eras of the Western master narrative,
in dominant discourse now, the Arctic in part constitutes what it means
to be a human being in a moment of late-stage capitalism. As Morehouse
and Cigliano (2020) report, glacial funerals are now being held in
Iceland as a way of marking disappearance and persistent sea ice loss is
credited as ushering into existence a 'new Arctic' (on the 'new Arctic',
see Serreze, 2018). Morehouse and Cigliano (2020) suggest that
[[the]{.mark} public [mourning of glacial disappearance]{.mark} operates
as an opportunity to [think of ice as **animate**]{.mark} **rather than
inanimate**]{.underline}, an idea similar to Cruickshank\'s detailing of
Athabascan, Tlingit, and Eyak philosophies pertaining to glacial
sentience, and the long held belief that glaciers are social actors that
change physical, social and spiritual landscapes. [[This]{.mark} is a
loss that [cannot]{.mark} [be]{.mark} adequately [captured by]{.mark}
metrics such as **[ice melt]{.mark}** and surface area exposure
[but]{.mark} something that [speaks to the **connections between ice
and**]{.mark} **the [life]{.mark}-worlds of others**.]{.underline} In
her account of life on either side of the Bering Strait, Bathsheba
Demuth reminds us of how sea ice is lively, animate and life-affirming.
As she notes:

In forming, thawing and shifting under the wind, ice steadies the
circulation of the world\'s oceans, making them hospitable for living
things ... The sea ice shapes being, human and otherwise, on this
planet. From its groaning surface, the world as we know it is made
(Demuth, 2019, pp. 21--36)

Here Demuth\'s attunement to the necessity of ice is understood as
relational, symbiotic and mutualistic in its crucial functioning. It
works, in sympathy, with the other accounts that consider Indigenous
life-worlds and the meaning of ice in shaping the lives of the peoples
of the Arctic (Gearheard et al., 2013).

Simultaneously to Demuth\'s descriptions, [[the Arctic\'s liquefying
materiality presents]{.mark} a series of **[perceived dangers]{.mark}**
that create an Arctic of alarmistic discourse]{.underline}: soon the
Arctic Ocean will be open water, glaciers will disappear, and a warming
Arctic will result in a methane bomb radiating ill-effects around the
Earth\'s climate. In these alarmist renderings of a melting North, [[a
hidden]{.mark} and invisible [enemy lurks]{.mark} with[in]{.mark} the
[ice and its]{.mark} subsurface in the [permafrost as stored
carbon]{.mark}. In its newly appreciated animacy by some, [**ice becomes
a villain** that melts and releases]{.mark} new forms of planetary
[havoc]{.mark}]{.underline} (with perhaps earlier echoes of Soviet
framings of permafrost as villainous even mischievous, see Chu, 2020).
In the last decade and a half, popular writers and academics have warned
about the geophysical transformation of the Arctic and its likely
implications for commerce, governance, human security and even for an
'inhabitable climate' (for example, Wallace-Wells, 2019). The direction
of intellectual traffic favouring a medley of conflictual and
co-operative scenarios for the future Arctic, with a great deal of
energy devoted to present and likely future intentions of Arctic and
non-Arctic states. [[The focus on **ice-free lanes** of]{.mark} traffic
open [a North]{.mark}east/ Northwest [passage]{.mark} that was [once
only fabled]{.mark} and longer-term a trans-polar route, [slicing
through the]{.mark} centre of the [Arctic]{.mark} Ocean]{.underline}

In the midst of all this auditing and speculation by colonial
nation-states, Indigenous Arctic polities, especially those in smaller,
coastal communities in Alaska, are consistently overlooked yet
simultaneously placed with the burden of carbon consequence. The most
recent of which manifesting as enforced relocation via sea level
rise---a relocation not sponsored by the nation-states that carry most
participatory responsibility for the drastic change in sea levels. For
the large part, [[Indigenous communities of the Arctic are interpreted
as **hyper vulnerablised** due to]{.mark} effects of **[disappearing sea
ice]{.mark}**, as noteworthy exemplars of resilience in relation to
adjusting to a **new ice reality**, and/or a (potentially) renewable
resource of traditional ecological knowledge that will assuage climate
collapse for a white, temperate world]{.underline} (Smith, 2021). [Less
[often are]{.mark} Indigenous communities understood as [sovereign
polities with]{.mark} legal, historical and spiritual [claims to
land]{.mark}, water, air and ice]{.underline}. Furthermore, [[rarely are
Indigenous communities]{.mark} included as major [stakeholders in
international]{.mark} and cross-organisational [reports done in]{.mark}
regards to [the Arctic.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[What makes]{.mark}
volumes such as The Meaning of [Ice notable]{.mark}]{.underline},
however, [[is]{.mark} their explicit focus on the meaning that
Indigenous communities give to sea ice; as [a facilitator of
mobility]{.mark}; as provider of [food and]{.mark} supplies used in the
acts of daily life; as [intimately connected to]{.mark} a sense of
[home]{.mark}; and [as a source of]{.mark} well-being and [ontological
security]{.mark}]{.underline} (Gearheard et al., 2013; Aporta
et al., 2014).

[[Training on 'Terra Nullius']{.underline}]{.mark} Let's return to the
case of the Rovajärvi firing range, one of the two identified areas
where restricted US only zones may be established in the future.
[Obviously[, rural regions are]{.mark} more [sparse]{.mark}ly populated
than urban centres. As a result[, the disturbance caused by]{.mark}
military [training]{.mark} to civilians [may be considered]{.mark}
[less]{.mark}, [if quantified in]{.mark} terms of the [number]{.mark} of
persons [affected]{.mark}.]{.underline} The area covered by Rovajärvi
firing range is vast, about 1,200 square kilometress. [[In addition to
military]{.mark} training [infrastructure]{.mark} -- roads, weapon
storage facilities, army barracks, fenced target areas, military debris,
and an impressive network of outdoor toilets -- [the area]{.mark} mostly
[consists]{.mark} [of]{.mark} an [unbuilt environment:]{.mark} forests,
lakes, rivers, hills, and swamps. However, [this does not mean]{.mark}
that [the area would not be used]{.mark} by civilians, [or]{.mark} that
a sharp increase in [military training would not 'disturb civilians'.
Neither]{.mark} does it mean [that there would be plenty of
space]{.mark} (another way of saying the place is empty). First, [in
addition to being a military training area]{.mark}, [Rovajärvi]{.mark}
firing range [is a reindeer pastureland]{.mark} that forms a major part
of Pyhä-Kallio reindeer herding district, [where]{.mark} about
[140]{.mark} reindeer [herders]{.mark} [take care of]{.mark} roughly
[6,500]{.mark} free-roaming reindeer.]{.underline} Reindeer herding is a
traditional, semi-nomadic livelihood, which forms the material basis of
Indigenous Sámi culture and peoplehood. However, the reindeer herders in
Pyhä-Kallio are mainly of Finnish origin. Unlike in Sweden and Norway,
where reindeer herding has historically been the exclusive right of the
Sámi, in Finland it was adopted also by Finnish settlers since there
were no state laws forbidding it. Due to the cold environment, it was
one of the most sustainable livelihoods that could provide a steady
source of food. Although Finnish and Sámi reindeer herding practices
differ in some important ways, both groups consider it a way of life
that carries strong social and cultural meanings. [For many, [it is an
essential aspect]{.mark} [of]{.mark} local and regional
[histories]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the foundation of [land-based identities
and communities]{.mark}. The firing range was [established]{.mark} on
Pyhä-Kallio reindeer herding pastures [in 1949]{.mark} and the area used
by the Finnish Defence Forces has [expanded ever
since]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to a report published in 2013, the
sustainability of reindeer herding in this area is in steep decline.
[This is largely due to military activities that disturb the reindeer,
making them avoid certain pasturelands, resulting in over-grazing on
others]{.underline} (Helle et al. 2013; see also Rovajärven
kehittämistyöryhmä 2013). Reindeer herding in a military training area
can also be demoralising. Sometimes reindeer venture onto the target
areas where they risk being injured or killed by shrapnel. Others get
entangled in or are injured by military debris that litters the area. In
addition, explosions cause large holes in the ground, creating potential
hazards to reindeer herders using snowmobiles. [[The]{.mark}
[largest]{.mark} military [exercises]{.mark} also [coincide with the
calving period]{.mark} in May, causing complications for reindeer
reproduction. [In autumn]{.mark}, larger military [exercises overlap
with]{.mark} reindeer [roundups]{.mark} in late autumn reindeer work,
forcing the herders to rush through the autumn tasks, which are already
dependent on weather conditions and the movement of the
reindeer.]{.underline} The Finnish Defence Forces does compensate some
of the losses, but the herders consider the compensation insufficient.1
[Second, [Rovajärvi]{.mark} [is]{.mark} also [a space of]{.mark} private
[landowners]{.mark} [and]{.mark} rich in [cultural history]{.mark}. When
the firing range was first established, [the area covered]{.mark} not
just state land, but also [privately owned land]{.mark}, [including
houses and entire villages.]{.mark} As the military use of the area has
expanded, more private land has been affected but [much]{.mark} of it
[has been purchased by the state, through forced land
expropriation]{.mark} and voluntary sales.]{.underline} Despite this,
many people still hold on to their properties: today about 6,400
hectares remains under private ownership. Most of the landowners were
either born, or have a long family history in this area, which the
locals call Naarmankaira. While having a home or summer cottage inside a
military training area where access is restricted might not sound
attractive, all property owners whom I have interviewed highlight family
history and a personal sense of belonging as the main reasons why they
still want to stay. These people have learned to live with, and accept,
the thrill of rockets being launched above their cottages from one side
of the area to another. However, pressure from the state to leave the
area is growing. Since the early 2010s, private landowners have no
longer been able to secure any new construction permits for their
properties. The new policy, clearly reflecting the state's desire to
diminish non-military presence in the area, prompted landowners to
organise behind a shared association, Pro Rovajärvi Ry, to protect their
rights and to attract attention to their cause. A decade on, the policy
is still in place and the number of private landowners continues to
decline. Moreover, in the present context of hypermilitarisation, the
space to defend the landowners' rights is dwindling as any talk against
the area's military use risks being conflated as 'unpatriotic' and/or
'harmful' for Finland's defence. [Third, [Rovajärvi]{.mark} or
Naarmankaira [is]{.mark} also [known as a legendary hunting and fishing
ground]{.mark} rich in both prehistoric and historic archaeological
sites. For example, the area has a notably dense concentration of seita,
ancient offering stones or places of worship dating back to the 16th
century often found near good fishing places.]{.underline} It has a rich
wildlife and is a place where local people go hunting, fishing, berry-
and mushroom picking, or simply visit for recreation. During the summer
and autumn, Thai seasonal guest-workers who arrive in Finland to harvest
wild berries are a common sight. Each of these land users must reconcile
with the Defence Forces, [as [ultimately, it is the military who has the
final word]{.mark} on who can access and use the area, when and
how.]{.underline} The extent of area closure varies depending on the
intensity and quality of training, but since also the intensity of
training is set to increase in the context of NATO membership and the
DCA, some CRITICAL STUDIES ON SECURITY 247 locals fear that in the
future, civilian access to the area, or at least large parts of it,
could be entirely prohibited. In the absence of reliable public
communication on the area's future by the Finnish Defence Forces, locals
who are directly affected must rely on rumours. Finally, the area's
military geography also includes groups and actors that are not there,
precisely due to decades of military use. Tourist activities and
operators are forbidden, and as a result, the Defence Forces do not need
to consider them when planning their activities. Likewise, no heavy
industries operate in the area because the military has kept them off.
It is impossible to know how the area and the broader region would have
developed, and what kind of civilian use would have taken place, had the
area not been prioritised for the military. [[Despite]{.mark} any
potential [disturbance]{.mark}, [many]{.mark} in the region also
[welcome]{.mark} the increasing military [activity]{.mark}, because it
is believed to have a positive impact on the local economy. In the
context of an ageing population, dwindling public funding and the
closure of the border with Russia, northern municipalities are desperate
for new sources of income and consider military investments and presence
an opportunity bringing life and economic wellbeing to the region[. The
problem is that,]{.mark} as with mines, the [social, economic, cultural,
political,]{.mark} and [environmental effects of military land]{.mark}
[use remain outside public debate]{.mark} [and]{.mark} hence,
[beyond]{.mark} democratic [deliberation]{.mark}. Questions that should
be asked and discussed include, for instance, [what does it
mean]{.mark}, long term, for municipalities [to become]{.mark}
[economically]{.mark} [dependent]{.mark} [on]{.mark} the presence of
[militaries]{.mark}? How does the growing presence of international
troops affect constructions of gender in the region? What kind of, and
whose, future does the military land use enable, and [what futures are

[The [Necropolitics of Settler Colonialism]{.mark} The enduring
attention and foundational significance bestowed on the China Joe tale
not only serve [to justify masculinist xenophobia]{.mark} but
[also]{.mark} elide other forms of contingent violence, most notably,
methods of [terror and control]{.mark} enacted [on Alaska Native
peoples]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 1883, three Tlingit men were arrested
in Juneau for the murder of a white man, and, before the arrival of the
navy, all three men died as a result of "miners' justice," two of the
men by hanging. [This is a difficult story, to elaborate on the telling
of this violence, yet important to acknowledge both as historic erasure
of Native life and death and as a precursor to the driving- out,
evincing that the settler terror directed three years later at the
Chinese miners was neither singular nor unprecedented.]{.underline}
Understanding that the Native men killed were working as packers,
hauling materials for prospectors over the two- and- a- half- mile
stretch from the mining town to the gold fields, the story of their
deaths provides an additional or alternate gold rush account, one that,
unlike the unending reiteration of China Joe's tale, forcefully produces
white settler subjectivity while remaining unspeakable as a foundational
narrative. Reading lynchings and drivings out together reveals the
structural terror that undergirded miners' law and, rather than
collapsing lynchings and drivings- out into a flattened equivalence,
their shared appearance within a few short years provides a way to read
these actions not only as linked together in their similarity, but also
as incommensurate yet diferential violence. What was considered frontier
justice was known to be harsh, racist even, but was often viewed as rash
and indiscriminate. What the broader picture of lynchings and drivings-
out--- the violence enacted against the diferently colonized and
racialized bodies of Native and Asian people--- exposed was the
necropolitical function of settler colonialism.63 [If Michel Foucault's
[theorization of biopower]{.mark}, the management of life
[through]{.mark} the connected processes of [disciplining bodies]{.mark}
and regulating populations,]{.underline} is, as Achille Mbembe argues,
insufficient to analyze colonial terror, Mbembe's [shift of focus from
life- worlds to death- [worlds proves instructive to the relational
examination of drivings- out]{.mark} and lynchings.64 Instead of
attending to the white heteronormative settler subject produced in the
disposability of racialized others, [a necropolitical frame
parses]{.mark} the messy and uneven violent [management]{.mark} [of
multiple populations targeted for violence]{.mark} and the specific
precarities intended for those who are diferentially racialized and
colonized.]{.underline} Though Mbembe's formulation of the
necropolitical was developed to account for the formation of late-
modern colonial war and terror, critical Indigenous studies scholar
Scott Morgensen challenges the idea of a historical break between early
and modern colonialism, that such a genealogy naturalizes settler
colonialism, and "theories of the biopolitical state, regimes of global
governance, and the war on terror will be insufficient unless they
critically theorize settler colonialism as a historical and pre sent
condition and method of all such power."65 [I build on Morgensen's
assertion that [settler modernity is constituted through a biopolitical
imperative of]{.mark} both [genocidal and assimilative governance of
Indigenous peoples,]{.mark} to argue that [an]{.mark} [imbricated
incorporative disposability of immigrant]{.mark} populations
[works]{.mark} simultaneously to [cohere]{.mark} the space and time of
that [modernity]{.mark}.]{.underline} The lynching finds its way into
popular press of the time because of the coincidental arrival of a
steamship, its passengers witnessing the moment immediately following
the lynching, a Tlingit man hanging from a makeshift scafold, his limp
body over the beach at low tide. The tourists onboard included the
former U.S. Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont and his son Edward. As
the younger Pierrepont recounted, "Even as we touched the wharf, we
noticed something unusual in the scene--- no bustle, no merriment, no
noise; all quiet, men pale. . . . As our eyes wandered along the shore,
searching for a cause, there, standing out plainly defined against the
dark background, we saw a newly erected gallows under which an Indian's
body slowly swayed to and fro."66 Sixty to seventy white miners had
assembled for the hanging, and to assume collective responsibility (and
avoid individual punishment), all had pulled on the hanging rope.
Pierrepont's account runs counter to the travel adventure reenactment of
discovery, by negating the cele bration of arrival: "no bustle, no
merriment, no noise." What interrupts and refutes this narrative, the
"cause," is the lynched Native body. [I offer this reading not to expand
or prolong the sensationalism of the scene but to unflinchingly witness
the colonial violence that ruptures the celebratory tourist narrative[,
even as colonial justice tries to suture settler sociality back
together]{.mark} through the unified action of the white miners and
their juridical documentarian, son of the former eminent law enforcement
officer in the nation. This scene [is]{.mark} at once [biopolitical and
necropolitical portrait]{.mark}, the consolidation of white male
subjectivity and its sovereign right to kill, over and against the
abject and criminalized Native body.]{.underline}

In light of this, it seems pertinent to ask, what kind of broader social
and political analyses and interventions does the framework of settler
colonialism enable? How can settler colonial studies move away from
merely 'exposing' settler colonialism, toward its complex understanding,
and even to challenging it, for instance by amplifying its fractures and
internal inconsistencies? In this regard, Nancy Shoemaker's critique of
settler colonial studies appears particularly instructive.21 She argues
that the stark difference between traditional and settler colonialism
that some of its proponents propose is actually a sliding one, as
colonialism can also take many other forms, which may follow one
another, or exist side-by-side. Subsequently, she lists eleven other
possible categories, of which [**[extractive colonialism]{.mark}** might
be most relevant for the Nordic countries.]{.underline} According to
Shoemaker, extractive colonialism takes interest only in the raw
materials found in a particular locale. [Extractive colonizers might
[push away Indigenous inhabitants to]{.mark} secure **[access]{.mark} to
the [resources]{.mark}**, [but]{.mark} more typically they [depend on
the native for]{.mark} '**[diplomatic mediation]{.mark}**,
**[environmental knowledge]{.mark}**, [and
**labour'**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 22 Extractive colonialism doesn't
presume permanent occupation, but settlement often follows. Hence,
longterm extractive colonialism can lead to the formation of settlements
and thus, of settler colonial relations and regimes.

Another category with direct relevance to this study is [**[transport
colonialism]{.mark}**, which operates through the [establish]{.mark}ment
[and administrat]{.mark}ion of [**international transport** corridors
and **logistical nodal points**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Like extractive
colonialism, [transport colonialism does not necessitate permanent
settlement, but by [creating new]{.mark} economic, political and
cultural **[contact zones]{.mark}**, it [facilitates **cultural
assimilation**, or **gradual 'elimination'**]{.mark} of native cultures
and livelihoods.]{.underline} 'The many varieties of colonialism and
their points of intersection', Shoemaker concludes, 'suggest that
historians could elaborate on the trend started by settler colonial
studies and more precisely investigate colonialization processes as
multifaceted affairs that affected colonizers, the colonized,
landholding, labour, and migration in myriad ways'. 23

Railways have been particularly central for colonial and imperial
expansion. As such, they can provide a valuable starting point for the
study of colonialism in its historically different manifestations. In
Africa and India, railways were needed to secure control and to extract
the colonies' natural resources for export. In North America, railways
became central engines of settler colonialism. Deborah Cowen, who
studies the Canadian Pacific Railroad (CPS) to 'follow the
infrastructures of empire', and to trace the 'making of settler colonial
space', as well as its 'afterlives and refusals', 24 shows how the
railway, completed under British rule in 1881, enabled settler colonial
occupation and native dispossession in myriad ways. Its construction
necessitated import of workforce which later became settlers, and over
time, led to the establishment of railway towns, promotion of settler
agriculture, and large-scale buffalo hunting. Although the CPS therefore
could be regarded as thoroughly 'settler colonial', Cowen highlights
that settler or Canadian interests were not the driving force behind its
construction. Instead, the project was driven by military and merchant
elites in faraway Britain, who in the mid-nineteenth century worried
about the growing rivalry between the British Empire and the United
States over global dominance.25 Exploring the Railroad merely as an
instrument of settler colonialism would thus neglect multiple other
frameworks that are also relevant to understanding its meanings,
functions and impact, such as British imperialism, international
geopolitics and the history of global tradeBuilding on these insights, I
will next turn to the Arctic Railway project, to follow and trace
processes in Finland that can be considered as settler colonial, but not
to the exclusion of other available frameworks. The primary objective is
to explore how settler colonialism has evolved along with changes in the
international environment and the character of the state, and how such
changes affect the ways in which the colonial relations and practices
are articulated in the present.The Arctic Railway projectIn March 2018,
Finland's Ministry of Transport and Communications announced that it was
taking steps to build a new 'Arctic Railway' across Northern Finland.
Together with the Norwegian transport authorities, they had assessed
five routing options and selected the route from Rovaniemi to the
Norwegian port town Kirkenes for further examination. In its press
release, the Ministry described the Arctic Railway as an important
European project that 'would create a closer link between the northern,
Arctic Europe and continental Europe' and 'improve the conditions for
many industries in northern areas'. 26 According to Minister Anne
Berner, the new connection could be in use as early as in 2030 (Figure
1).27The idea is not new as such: a railway that would connect mainland
Finland with the Arctic Ocean has been explored variously since the late
nineteenth century. The early plans were made collaboratively by
Russians and Finns, then Germans, and driven by regional mineral
discoveries and military considerations.28 In 1917, Finland declared
independence from Russia, and three years later, Russia ceded to Finland
the coastal Pechenga region which was the homeland of the Skolt Sámi
people. In the new context, the Railway came to symbolize the rise of
the Finnish nation. Its passionate advocates argued that a railroad to
the Arctic coast would help the nation-state harness the Northern
regions' boundless natural riches for the benefit of its own people,
consolidate Finland's grip of the coastal area amid competing state
interest, and facilitate its settlement with 'decent and right kind of
settlers', i.e. Finnish agriculturalists.29 In the 1930s, the discovery
of large nickel deposits in Pechenga renewed interest in the project,30
and in the 1940s, it was again the German troops' turn to briefly
explore it.31 No construction was ever undertaken, however, as in each
case, further studies exposed the project as too economically unviable
and far too laborious.32 At the end of the Second World War, Finland
lost Pechenga to the Soviet Union. As the region became an arena for the
Cold War, the project was put to rest for decades.

By the first decade of the 2000s, the situation had again changed. The
'iron curtain' no longer dictated the region's development. Moreover,
[as a result of global warming, the **[Arctic]{.mark} region's** vast
natural [resources are]{.mark} becoming more [**exposed for
exploitation**, and]{.mark} new [**shipping routes**, such as the
**Northeast Passage**]{.mark} between Europe and Asia, are expected to
open up.]{.underline} That is why each Nordic state has begun to issue
and regularly update its own Arctic strategy, which lists their goals,
interests and visions for the region. Finland's first Strategy for the
Arctic region, issued in 2010 and updated in 2013 and 2016, [imagined
Northern Finland as a **central transport corridor** and logistical hub
that could cater to the Arctic region's **growing transport needs** and
serve as a bridge between mainland Europe, the Arctic and
Asia.]{.underline}33 The Arctic Railway project participates in this
vision. It was brought up most prominently in the strategy update from
2013, [which framed it mainly in relation to the Barents region's
**oil**, natural **gas** and **mining** industries.]{.underline}34 As
such [it articulates both **[extractive and transport
colonialism]{.mark}** as described by]{.underline} Shoemaker: [its
stated aim is to **[facilitate]{.mark}** natural [resource extraction
in]{.mark} Northern Finland and **[the Arctic]{.mark} at large**, [to
connect the Arctic with]{.mark} mainland [Europe, and to serve]{.mark}
the needs of **[global logistics and trade]{.mark}** with China as the
new key player.]{.underline}

Fair enough, but interestingly, UNCLOS itself never receives any serious
criticism from our realpolitikers when it certainly deserves this. It is
important to understand not just its virtues but also its vices. This is
what is attempted here. From the 18th to the mid-20th century, respect
for the principle of '[**[freedom of the seas]{.underline}**']{.mark}
meant that the stretch of coastal waters said to belong to a state was
three nautical miles or 5.6 kilometres. This was the norm [[set
by]{.mark} the **[imperialist powers]{.mark}** of the time [such
as]{.mark} the [US]{.mark}, Britain, France]{.underline} and others, and
was based on the maximum distance a cannon shot could travel from an
offshore threat. After the Second World War, [**economic ambitions** led
many countries [to]{.mark} [extend]{.mark} their [sovereign
claims]{.mark}]{.underline} to 12 nautical miles, which by the 1960s was
widely accepted as the new norm. Even before this though, there were
**[greedy exceptions]{.underline}**. The first culprit (no surprise) was
the **[[US]{.underline}]{.mark}** which in 1945 under [**President**
Harry Truman **[unilaterally]{.mark} declared** as its
**[territory]{.mark}**]{.underline} all the sea areas corresponding to
its extended continental shelf which was at least, if not more than, 200
nautical miles (370 km). Within the next couple of years a few other
countries such as Argentina, Chile, Peru and Ecuador similarly extended
their sovereign claims over sea waters, seabed and subsoil. In the
post-Second World War era, with decolonisation putting an end to older
empire geographies and creating a huge number of new states thereby
promoting much greater national competition for the resources of the
seas and oceans as well as more maritime traffic, the most important
negotiations for establishing an international Law of the Sea began in
1973. By this time, 25 countries were adhering to the three nautical
miles limit, 66 countries to 12 miles and eight countries to at least
200 miles. These negotiations lasted for nine years culminating in
UNCLOS in 1982 which came into force in 1994 when the 60th country,
Guyana, ratified it. What UNCLOS does [**[UNCLOS]{.mark}** [is]{.mark}
almost **universally** lauded for [laying]{.mark} [down]{.mark}
[laws]{.mark} and rules [whose]{.mark} wide [acceptance]{.mark} it is
believed [has]{.mark} greatly **[reduced]{.mark}** the
number,]{.underline} frequency and potential for inter-state conflicts
that would otherwise have taken place. There are now 167 member
countries plus the European Union. But these gains have also come at an
incalculable cost, now and in the future, which is simply not recognised
let alone counted. But before we come to that let us see what it does.
The 12-mile zone was legally sanctioned as the 'territorial seas'
belonging to a specific coastal state but within which "**[innocent
passage]{.underline}**" of other ships including warships is allowed.
Easily the single-most important new development ushered in by UNCLOS
was the creation and legal sanctification of Exclusive Economic Zones
(EEZs) of 200 nautical miles over which states have sovereign rights to
explore and exploit in the seas, the seabed and subsoil. The area beyond
the EEZs are demarcated as the "high seas" and said to be the "common
heritage of humankind". Here, the stipulated International Seabed
Authority (ISA) finally came into existence in 1994 to regulate,
organize and control through licences and contracts with companies and
governments, all mining explorations to be followed later by actual
operations in the international seabed. Key narrow straits crucial for
shortening maritime routes have been given international status for
"transit passage" but otherwise local coastal states have sovereign
rights over them. It has established a dispute-settlement mechanism for
member countries. Problems and criticisms The biggest beneficiaries of
the introduction of EEZs are those countries with a huge coastline
(Russia, Australia) and big archipelago island states (Indonesia,
Japan), but above all the [three premier **[colonial]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} **[imperialist]{.mark}** [powers]{.mark} of the 18th, 19th
and early 20th centuries, namely the [UK, France and]{.mark} then the
[US]{.mark} which [through force]{.mark} [conquered]{.mark} huge
[landmasses]{.mark} as well as scattered islands [and]{.mark} long
island chains [establishing]{.mark} [**white settler regimes**
by]{.mark} [massacring]{.mark} at least [80%]{.mark} of the
**[indigenous non-white population]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Besides the
US itself, these are Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Brazil. The UK
and France continue to retain many island groups. According to UNCLOS,
uninhabited islands are also entitled to 200-mile EEZs. In terms of
overseas areas in their possession, the top ten in order are France
(11.7 million square kilometres), the US (11.4 million sq km), Australia
(8.5 million), Russia (7.5 million), UK (6.8 million), Indonesia (6.2
million), Canada (5.6 million), Japan (4.5 million), New Zealand (4.1
million) and Brazil (3.8 million). For the US, France and the UK, their
overseas areas exceed that of their own landmasses. The US has accepted
the legal limit of 200 miles but nevertheless, unlike China, is not a
member of UNCLOS. Membership requires the assent of a two-thirds
majority in both houses which Republicans have so far prevented as there
are strong voices which oppose any constraints on the US. For example,
it can currently ignore the ISA when it comes to international seabed
exploration and mining for commercial purposes. Given UNCLOS's ruling
against Chinese claims in the South China Sea, some American strategists
feel US membership would materially strengthen the opposition to China
pursuing its ambitions in this regard. New Zealand, with a population of
around five million has 4.1 million sq km while China with a population
of 1.3 billion has around 900,000 sq km. China's Nine-Dash-Line is a
demarcation that claims island groupings and thus more of the South
China seas. Incidentally, this claim precedes the emergence of Communist
China and continues to be held also by the current Taiwan regime. But
after 1982 UNCLOS, the stakes in terms of areas to be acquired became
much higher than ever before. This would now add a further two million
sq km to China if conceded, which is still well short of New Zealand's
total. Of course the Nine-Dash-Line must not be accepted. But pointing
the disparities between New Zealand and China is meant to highlight how
the legacies of former colonial rule and aggrandisement continue to
shape in highly iniquitous ways the current order; to which one can add
the iniquity that has emerged from sanctioning the principle of EEZs
themselves. The establishment of such EEZs was effectively the
inauguration of a process of substantial privatisation-nationalisation
to shrink what has been called the "global commons". As such, it is in
keeping with the [[growing dominance of]{.mark} **[neoliberal
capitalist]{.mark}** [thinking]{.mark} among the ruling
classes]{.underline} of different nation-states even if the [most
powerful states]{.underline} and those aspiring to join the 'Big Boys
Club' hold the biggest share of responsibility [for having
[produced]{.mark} and endorsed [this outcome]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Before 1982 sovereign rights were over a 12-mile zone. After UNCLOS,
some 36% of the world's waters (by surface area, not volume) have been
[**[excluded]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} the "common heritage of
**[humankind]{.mark}**".]{.underline} The current "high seas" cover 64%
area wise and volume wise amount to over 90%. But the workings of ocean
currents lead to huge concentrations of phytoplankton -- the crucial
base of the fisheries food chain -- being disproportionately deposited
within EEZs so that 87 coastal states control over 95% of the world's
fisheries and because of over-fishing, replenishment rates are seriously
threatened. The world high water mark for fish catch, never since
repeated, was 90 million metric tonnes in 1989 with subsequent catches
stagnant or declining. So much so, that at current rates it is estimated
that that all the world's fisheries can collapse by 2050 or even earlier
as ocean acidification and habitat destruction are also taking their
toll. Predatory fishing by the more powerful fishing companies of the
richer and more prosperous states is a fact. Also 87% of known and
estimated hydrocarbon reserves and many mineral deposits are to be found
among EEZs. When EEZs overlap it is left to the two countries involved
to sort matters out. The region of [greatest tension among neighbouring
countries [caused by]{.mark} such overlaps, by **[economic
ambitions]{.mark}**, by political tensions [and]{.mark} above all by the
**[geopolitical]{.mark} [face-off]{.mark}** [between]{.mark} the
**[US]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **[China]{.mark}**]{.underline} (which
includes military preparations) is the Asia Pacific. There is no proper
Global Ocean Treaty that aims to seriously protect the "common heritage"
of the High Seas. The ISA is more concerned to promote the eventual
extraction of poly-metallic nodules containing valued mineral accretions
from the seabed than with protecting the environment. No licence for
exploratory mining has been turned down. [Environmental Impact
Assessments are]{.underline} done by the contracting company and are
[**not independently verified**.]{.underline} The ISA is [dismissive of
the concerns of environmental organisations like]{.underline} Greenpeace
about protecting the seabed from such future mining or from the various
[powerfully negative environmental side effects that]{.underline} would
be involved such as noxious plumes, noise and light pollution. Insofar
as there are moves towards a Global Ocean Treaty, the ISA is not alone
in wanting a soft treaty that gives priority to economic exploitation
over environment concerns. Summing up The engine that keeps
**[capitalist development]{.underline}** running is the [[constant
**pursuit of profit**]{.underline}]{.mark}, which necessarily
[[requires]{.mark} the constant pursuit of economic growth through
cumulative [exploitation]{.mark} of resources;]{.underline} and that too
within a framework of multiple nation-states where the strongest and
most powerful want to set the rules of international order and
management as much as possible in their own favour. The sane
[[alternative]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example, in the Asia Pacific
(and elsewhere) [[would]{.mark} [be]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[setting
up]{.mark}]{.underline} of a genuinely [[impartial]{.mark} regional
[body]{.mark} [whose]{.mark} number one [priority]{.mark} [would
be]{.mark} the]{.underline} [protection]{.mark} of the oceanic
environment; [the imposition of the most severe [limits]{.mark}
[on]{.mark} the [exploitation of]{.mark} the
[wealth]{.mark}]{.underline} of the seas and oceans; [[widening]{.mark}
the [domain]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the "**common heritage of
[humankind]{.mark}**"]{.underline} by retracting these EEZs; and
organising the distribution of whatever level of resource extraction
that is allowed in the "global commons", in proportion to the respective
population sizes of the countries concerned. Of course this is not going
to happen. [Instead, the process of privatising the seas via UNCLOS has
been joined by the process of [privatising]{.mark} the
[atmosphere]{.mark} [through]{.mark} **[pollution]{.mark} permits** and

terms has for some time now already been privatised for the so-called

racing beyond it, while other forms of grave ecological despoliation on

The series largely avoids the landscape aesthetics that has been
labelled neoromantic in relation to some Nordic television series
(Hansen & Waade, 2017). Instead, it renders landscapes in a
conspicuously unspectacular manner. Rather than stunning sunlit
panoramas enhanced by smooth drone shots (an eye-catching strategy used
in Acquitted and Midnight Sun), landscapes in Occupied are registered
with a relatively static camera in long or medium shots, characterised
by chromatic uniformity and non-luminous, at times gloomy, aesthetics.
This lack of spectacular landscape shots -- with a few telling
exceptions discussed below -- is an important aspect in the overarching
strategy of the series, that is, of critically rethinking the Nordic
eco-exceptionalism. My aim is to show how the Norwegian
eco-exceptionalist discourse, which I [call "**[white
ecology]{.mark}**", is [subverted]{.mark} in the series.]{.underline}
White ecology combines the green-ecological approach -- in Occupied
embodied by Berg and his party -- with the Norwegian national discourse
of nature, reaching back to romanticism, and [[expressed]{.mark}
[through]{.mark} the **[aesthetics of whiteness]{.mark}**. I will argue
that by [juxtaposing]{.mark} the **[Norwegian white ecological
approach]{.mark}** [with the **Russian "Other**"]{.mark}, or stranger,
Occupied manages to [challenge]{.mark} a number of [elements]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} the national eco-exceptionalist
**[self-conception]{.mark}**.]{.underline} An important part of my
argument is that Russia in Occupied can be seen as representing what
theorist Timothy Morton defines as "dark ecology" (2007, 2010, 2016),
and that the relation between Norway and Russia is imagined as one of
"enmeshment" (Morton, 2007) rather than black-and-white opposition. The
aesthetics of whiteness in the Norwegian national discourse include
mountainous winter landscapes usually associated with the North, but
they can also be understood in racial and gendered terms. As Sabine
Henlin-Strømme states, the Norwegian ["**[dominant white
discourse]{.mark}** [equates]{.mark} **[white nature]{.mark}**
[with]{.mark} white **[masculinity]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (2015: 188).
This discourse has long been present in Norwegian cinema, most
importantly because film camera was used by Roald Amundsen during his
Antarctic expedition in 1911--1912, which initiated the genre of travel
film (Sørenssen, 2012). This cinematic discourse became intensi- 88 Anna

Heavy Water War/The Saboteurs\] (NRK, 2015), drawing on the 1948 film,
shows Norwegian resistance fighters in a similarly heroic way, linking
white landscape with white masculinity. The white camouflage suits the
saboteurs wear during their resistance action ascribe, on a symbolic
level, positive connotations to whiteness and link men, whiteness, and
snowy mountains to the heroic Norwegian resistance movement (see also
Sørenssen, 2012). Moreover, [[in]{.mark} **[Western
cultures]{.mark}**,]{.underline} but also within a specifically Nordic
framework[, **[whiteness]{.mark} [connotes
innocence]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Rees observes that the [Norwegian
"**[discourse of innocence]{.mark}**" is also closely [bound]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} the Norwegian **[oil industry]{.mark}**. She argues: The
discovery of [petroleum]{.mark} resources has contributed to a larger
[discourse]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [Norwegian]{.mark}
[exceptionalism]{.mark}; [Norway is]{.mark}]{.underline} not only richer
than other European welfare states, but it is also [[perceived]{.mark}
[as]{.mark} [more]{.mark} **[ethical]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
[democratic]{.mark}** [than **other** **wealthy oil-producing nations**,
such as Qatar or Kuwait]{.mark} \[...\]. [Norway]{.mark} [is]{.mark}
somehow **[inherently]{.mark} [ethically]{.mark}
[superior]{.mark}**]{.underline}. (Rees, 2016: 45) Thus, the notion of
eco-exceptionalism will here signify Norway's unique relation to nature
in the Norwegian national self-conception and its modern variant
involving ecological concerns, as well as how the [[discourse of
**innocence and moral superiority provides a cover**]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} both **[petro-guilt]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the
[**anthropocentric construction** of the **humannature**]{.mark}
relationship in the Norwegian national discourse]{.underline}. In terms
of structure, I will first discuss neoromanticism in relation to Nordic
Noir in order to frame the use of landscapes in Occupied, then examine
its white ecological discourse, and finally, show how a dark ecological
awareness involving Russia serves to challenge the Norwegian
white-ecological, eco-exceptionalist masculine self.

[poverty]{.mark}.]{.underline} The most influential plan for deliverance
came from Jackson. Too short and bespectacled to evangelize overseas, he
came of age as a missionary among the Choctaw. By 1885, when he became
Alaska's education commissioner, he shared the prevailing postbellum
commitment to indigenous assimilation through Christian education and
market production.36 His task, as he saw it, was "[not only to
[teach]{.mark} reading, writing, and arithmetic, but also [how to live
better]{.mark}, how to [make]{.mark} more [money]{.mark} in order to
live better, and how to [utilize]{.mark} the resources of [the
country]{.mark} in order [to]{.mark} [make]{.mark} more

"[take]{.mark} a barbarian [people]{.mark} . . . and lift them up
[to]{.mark} comfortable self-support and
[civilization]{.mark}]{.underline}."38 Jackson found his solution on the
Russian side of the strait in 1890, where he sailed with Captain Healy.
The revenue service had orders to distribute gifts among the Yupik and
Chukchi as a sign of American goodwill. At harbor along the coast,
Jackson met a group of inland Chukchi, people he described as
"good-sized, robust, fleshy, well-fed," and even "half-civilized."39
Their vitality, in Jackson's" estimation, came from owning domesticated
reindeer. Jackson proposed to Congress the idea of importing tame stock.
Big game had gone the way of the bison. The ocean could not be restocked
like a trout stream. Caribou were wild and implicated in a feral
marketplace run by immoral gun and rum traders. But domestic reindeer
could be owned. Jackson, like those who read his congressional reports,
[[understood progress]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [be]{.mark} a function of
[production]{.mark}; [hunting and gathering had to give way]{.mark} to
an agricultural or industrial existence [if Alaska were to be American.
Private property was the foundation]{.mark} of farming and industry.
Possessing reindeer, Smithsonian naturalist Charles Townsend wrote,
would "render a wild people pastoral or agricultural," putting them on
"the first step toward their advancement."]{.underline}40

[[To fix people]{.mark} in space [is]{.mark} the great act of modern
[state power]{.mark}. It is [the logic of property]{.mark}, marking mine
from yours, and of borders, marking ours from theirs. [In the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates, the underground proved easier to enclose
than the sea, the shore, or the land; [with mining]{.mark} claims,
[people were fixed]{.mark} along the Seward Peninsula [by making
stasis]{.mark} seem [natural]{.mark} and voluntary]{.underline}. So at
least it appeared to the people of Nome in 1923, when a crowd of
residents formed to witness the launch of new, "scientifically devised
ways and wholehearted means" of working placer deposits.123 [That means
was cold-water thawing. [Narrow steel pipes pumped unheated water
into]{.mark} gold-bearing [earth, raising the temperature]{.mark} just
enough to melt permafrost. Cheaper than steam, these new fields of metal
rods linked by water hoses joined dredges and steam
shovels.]{.underline} That year, Nome gold mines produced at least a
million dollars' worth.124

[[The dredges]{.mark} that [people watched,]{.mark} cheering, [were
corporately]{.mark} [owned]{.mark}, operated by workers who no longer
spoke of capitalism as a nightmare. Around Nome, corporations [had come
to appear]{.mark} natural[, the only way forward]{.mark}, and what
corporate capitalism did to nature was viewed as a sign of progress.
Enclosing land made wealth. Investing that wealth in remaking more land
caused growth. Remaking land required power; money bought that power in
the form of muscles and steam-fed machinery, and then power found
money.]{.underline} Geologists estimated that at least five hundred
million in gold remained in the Seward Peninsula.125 Some of it was in
the slag made twenty years before by men with hand tools, still
permeated with fine gold that cold-water mining finally made
profitable.126 If technology and commerce could reclaim not just waste
land but the waste of the past, it had to be the future. [[That]{.mark}
future [curtailed]{.mark} other kinds of [Beringian life]{.mark}.
[Roads]{.mark} and short local rail lines [blocked]{.mark}
[creeks]{.mark}. Whole [stream beds disappeared]{.mark} amid detritus,
heaps of rubble, broken flumes, and weeping canals. Open-cut [placer
operations chewed through]{.mark} three-quarters of a [million cubic
yards]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [gravel]{.mark} in a year.127
[Disturbed]{.mark} and channeled [earth slid toward the sea]{.mark} with
every thaw and rainstorm. [Fish]{.mark} pummeled by sediments
[failed]{.mark} [to spawn]{.mark}. [Silt clouded the sun, starving
algae.]{.mark} Productivity plummeted.128 Although [it was
invisible]{.mark} to the triumphant residents of Nome, [capitalist
prosperity was in debt to the elements it rendered static and alienable,
and the beings it destroyed as collateral]{.mark}. Where miners did the
most work, [Beringia's arteries of energy were

[[If the Arctic appears]{.mark} to southerners as [untouched]{.mark},
[this is a function of]{.mark} their [misunderstanding]{.mark}, as well
as northerners\' adaptations not isolation.]{.underline} The northern
landscape is and has been resilient, a term I use throughout this book.
It names a colonial history of extraction-like emptying the Beaufort Sea
of bowheads-and the capacity of people, plants, and animals to cope with
the impacts of such exploitation. [When students of history consider
indigenous vantage points, they can see Arctic colonialism more clearly.
**[Science]{.mark} in particular [loses its sheen of neutrality and
objectivity]{.mark}.**]{.underline} In Cournoyea\'s representation, for
instance, Arctic research is much more grounded, more partial, more
partisan even. [[Scientists]{.mark} come and go to specific locations.
They [arrive pre-programmed with hypotheses to test]{.mark}, which
[rarely answer questions of interest to locals]{.mark}. And they are
nearly [always tailed by schemes of
\"modernization]{.mark}.\'\']{.underline} Cournoyea told of Nuligak and
Mangilaluk, Inuit leaders in Canada\'s Mackenzie Delta, who in 1921
rejected an offer of treaty by governmental agent 0. S. Finnie. At the
time, Canadian officials sought to formalize federal power over northern
lands. Rather than money, Inuit wanted the government to help their poor
and blind. But when Canadian agencies applied that money to introduce
reindeer herding programs-a livelihood common in Siberia and
Scandinavia, but foreign in Canada-Inuit in the delta found this
culturally inappropriate and refused to participate. The government
brought the herds anyway. They created a reindeer reserve where locals
could hunt or trap only if they enrolled as apprentices under the
supervision of white range managers, or if their application for a
permit was approved. [[Inuit]{.mark} were never enslaved, forcibly
conquered, or outnumbered by waves of settlers. Nevertheless, **they
[were marginalized in their homelands]{.mark}**, whether [through the
**transformation of the physical environment**]{.mark} that gave rise to
their livelihoods [or]{.mark} their **[exclusion from decision making
over]{.mark} those [lands]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Indigenous
perspectives like Cournoyea\'s are crucial to understanding today\'s
Arctic, because they disrupt commonly accepted notions of the region and
implicate southerners in northern affairs beyond the fossil fuels they
burn. Indigenous perspectives have not been well recorded by the pens of
academic history, though. For this reason, I have conducted research not
only in archives across the southern United States and Canada , but in
the Arctic as well. I spent twenty months living in Inuvik, a town in
the Mackenzie Delta of Canada\'s Northwest Territories. I confess that
my research in the field was not part of a grand plan hatched at my desk
and then carried out in orderly fashion. I began by moving to Inuvik in
the fall of 2007 as a community volunteer, with hopes of learning from
residents about the impacts of climate change in the Arctic. I spoke
with public figures, including scientists with local offices of federal
agencies and representatives of municipal, territorial, and Inuvialuit
governments. [I heard many times that, while warming temperatures have
altered physical conditions in the Mackenzie Delta, an [understanding of
climate change should be nested in]{.mark} the story of [Arctic science
and colonialism]{.mark}.]{.underline} My interests piqued, I left for
graduate school in 2008 to craft a more in-depth study. I returned to
Inuvik two years later with a commitment to the kinds of community
engagement recommended by environmental historians, historians of
colonial science, public scholars, and the Inuvialuit Regional
Corporation. I attended town hall meetings and joined consultation
sessions between oil companies and hunters and trappers committees. I
sat in on northern studies classes at the high school. I pored over
printed materials and audio recordings at local libraries, the
Inuvialuit Cultural Re-source Center, and the environmental agencies of
the Inuvialuit and federal governments. I spent time on the land with
Inuvialuit, soaking up stories of reindeer and trapping and hunting .
When I found information about science\'s history in the Arctic, I
shared it through formal presentations-to both town organizations and
classrooms of high school students-and informal discussions with
individual residents. I helped organize a five-day field trip that
brought together scientists, Inuvialuit elders, and high schoolers to
explore the culture, ecology, and history in Ivvavik National Park, on
the border of Alaska and the Yukon Territory. Although I spent the
majority of my time in Canada, I also traveled in Arctic Alaska. I
completed a summer field course at the University of Alaska-Fairbanks,
through which I visited North America\'s largest oil field in Prudhoe
Bay and listened to residents of Anaktuvuk Pass talk about the
historical nature of environmental challenges. Only when I headed south
again in 2011 did I find that many of these practices accorded with the
insights of postcolonial scholars, historical geographers, and Arctic
anthropologists. [Let me be clear: I do not wish to speak for Inuit.
Inuvialuit and Inupiat speak on science, colonialism , and environmental
change regularly, and have for some time.]{.underline} My short stay in
northern North America also did not yield complete and objective
information. My personal background shaded my experiences, even as
acquaintances, friends, mentors, and research participants helped me see
different perspectives on the Arctic. [I am aware that [Inuit society
transcends Inuit relations with scientists]{.mark}. Inuit have many more
ideas about the Arctic than I present in these pages. I do not pretend
to know these, or intend to discount them. Rather, I want to draw into
bright context the ways [scientific practices have configured life in
the north]{.mark}-and vice versa.]{.underline} [**This [history of
science and colonialism in the Arctic cannot]{.mark} be fully told
without learning [from Inuit voices]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Interviews,
casual conversations, unpublished materials, and even silences in the
historical record helped me apprehend the colonial nature of science,
both then and now. Indeed, [by [confining studies to non-Native actors
or neglecting indigenous accounts]{.mark}, [historians contribute to
amnesia about colonialism]{.mark} in the north and [overlook]{.mark} the
resilience of [northern peoples and environments]{.mark}.]{.underline}

DISPLACEMENTS

Traces of history animate modern Arctic affairs and landscapes.
Cournoyea shared the intersections of her own family with a genealogy of
knowledge. Her grandfather, Mike Siberia, worked as a technician on a
governmental survey of resources in the Yukon and Northwest Territories,
the Canadian Arctic Expedition of 1913-18. He married an Inuit woman who
served as a seamstress for the scientists, sewing clothes from caribou
so they could collect samples without succumbing to the cold. It was
this expedition that gave Canadian officials the impetus for the
reindeer project. Like scientists, members of Inuit communities played
different roles over the episodes of intervention I examine. In the late
1800s, most were hunting guides. By the 1970s, many testified before
public hearings on oil and gas development - like Cournoyea herself.
This lineage shows that [nothing in the Arctic is \"pure\"-not
bloodlines, land, history, or science.]{.underline} I place the Arctic
in time not to establish what belongs there, but to discern movements.
[[Colonialism]{.mark} was, and [continues]{.mark} to be, a tangle of
[intentional interference and]{.mark} its unintended
[consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Cournoyea\'s testimony evinces,
looking at a corner of the region, and keeping it in focus over the long
view, helps apprehend both the course of history and the undercurrents
of interruption-however fugitive or profound. Displacements in and from
the Arctic, then, are part of the picture of global change I want to
depict. 19 For most of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,
Inuit avoided outsider\'s attempts to control Arctic nature. They relied
on knowledge and experience to live off abundant natural resources,
including whales, seals, caribou, fish, and an array of plants. They
also tapped into economies of exchange operating beyond governmental
jurisdiction-whether through independent whaling or trading companies or
fellow indigenous groups. Their lives, like those in the nonhuman world,
hinged on mobility[. By the mid-195os, Cournoyea noted, Inuvialuit were
stuck]{.underline}. They could no longer rely on the productivity of the
land or the fur economies built upon it. At the same time,
[[governmental scientists ceased to involve]{.mark} them. Many
researchers no longer saw the value of [local guides]{.mark} if they
could complete an entire survey by plane while on the hunt for oil
resources that played little part in indigenous society]{.underline}.
Inuit stewed over these developments and began voicing their
frustration-to scientists. The means of Inuit resilience by the 1960s,
then, was not avoiding science, but appropriating it as a tool in
political organization. Inuit allied with a group of concerned
scientists-particularly those with environmentalist leanings-in their
fight for sovereignty in Arctic Alaska in 1971 and on the Canadian side
of the western Arctic between 1977 and 1984. In other words, as the
military-industrial complex turned northward, and Arctic administrators
granted scientists their highest levels of financial support and
decision-making authority, a reconfiguration of science and power was
set in motion. Contrary to analyses of colonialism in the Global South,
then, the end of my story is not the end of Arctic science. Rather[, [a
century of intervention came to a close by articulating]{.mark} a
[science that was]{.mark} both [humanist and environmental-and
situating]{.mark} it carefully within civil society]{.underline}.
[[**When Inuit inked land claims**]{.mark} agreements]{.underline} with
the United States and Canada in the 1970s and 1980s, there was the
fanfare of a revolution. But [**[there was]{.mark} also a more [subtle
evolution]{.mark}, one [predicated]{.mark}** [**on**]{.mark} **the**
**[supervision of science and]{.mark} regular [monitoring of the
physical environment]{.mark}**]{.underline}. I thus steer clear of
\"decolonization\" as a reference to the period in which land claims
were negotiated and formalized, since it implies a withdrawal of
colonial forces. [I use instead \"postcolonial\" to denote all of the
years after 1881 as [characterized by]{.mark} the [legacies of]{.mark}
the [continued colonial encounter]{.mark}, [with attention to]{.mark}
the [structures through which land was used, studied, and
managed]{.mark}.]{.underline} These analytical choices affect more than
disciplinary terrain. They [comprise a way of being in the world that
treats the past as constitutive of the present]{.underline}. 20 In the
1970s and 1980s, both federal and Inuit governments emphasized the
reorganization of knowledge production through more participatory and
democratic decision making, informed consent procedures, and research
licensing. Through these processes, Inuit shaped research agendas,
resource development projects, and political discourse on environmental
dilemmas at both the national and international levels. In all of these
instances, Inuit forged closer-but no less contentious-relations with
scientists. 21 It may be no surprise then, that Cournoyea closed her
presentation before the Inuit Studies Conference by courting academics,
cautiously. She expressed to members of the audience-many of them
anthropologists, geographers, and ecologists-the Inuvialuit Regional
Corporation\'s interests in collaborating on studies of sea ice and
Arctic warming.

UNFREEZING THE ARCTIC

As the auditorium emptied, and conference-goers began to queue by the
trays of cherry danishes, I introduced myself to the person in the aisle
behind me. The requisite exchange of hellos and credentials ensued. But
something in my introduction caught my new colleague off guard. \"A
historian?\" he remarked, kinking his head. \"What are you doing here?\"
In terms of academic standing, Arctic climate change is the domain of
the natural and social sciences. It is not immediately obvious, to at
least some of these scholars, what history offers to the study of
environmental problems. The study of the past may seem like a hobby, a
luxury in a bygone age of planetary stability. And, to be fair, many
historians choose not to intervene in contemporary debates, even if
their scholarship bears directly on present conditions. 22 For those
Arctic scholars in disciplines outside of history, this book provides a
backstory for climate change and globalization. 

[The **[Arctic]{.mark} has been [central to]{.mark} the [development of
scientific knowledge]{.mark}** []{.mark}since the middle of the 18oos,
just as scientists have been central to developments in the Arctic over
the same period.]{.underline} And, while melting ice is out of the
ordinary, it is also nothing new: it is the latest in a string of rapid
environmental transformations in the region over the last 150 years.
[When we take seriously these [aspects of the Arctic\'s past]{.mark},
rising temperatures and shifting global power dynamics [become more than
ecological or social problems]{.mark}. They become matters of history as
well.]{.underline} Quite literally, [[**previous episodes of scientific
exploration and exploitation permeate northern societies**]{.mark} and
landscapes.]{.underline} [Current **[frameworks of governance and
knowledge]{.mark}-making in the Arctic [are]{.mark} also [products of
the colonial experience]{.mark}**, [established through]{.mark} acts of
[Congress and modern treaties]{.mark}.]{.underline} If, in promoting
ambitious plans for adaptation in the Arctic, this history is concealed,
social and natural scientists may repeat it without realizing it.
Geographer Emilie Cameron has convincingly shown that [such [politics
are at play in climate science today]{.mark}, [specifically in]{.mark}
the [literature on vulnerability and adaptation]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Scientists]{.mark} in these fields often [frame Inuit ecological
knowledge and existing]{.mark} natural resource [management regimes as
inapplicable to physical conditions]{.mark} spawned by climate
change.]{.underline} As a result, [**[Inuit lose standing in channels of
Arctic decision making]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Natural scientists and
social scientists can prevent this situation by examining circumpolar
phenomena in the context of a history of colonialism there, and
remaining committed to the principles of modern treaties and
participatory democracy-like fair representation, informed consent, and
self-determination. For my colleagues in history-and especially
environmental history and the history of science-I intend these pages as
a call to arms. We should engage more fully in current affairs, as
public intellectuals with valuable and relevant expertise. As historians
Mark Carey and Nancy Langston have argued for the issue of climate
change, historians have an ability-and duty-to reframe environmental
crisis in human terms. Circumpolar indigenous peoples have taken the
lead on this, reminding world power brokers that climate change is not a
problem of atmospheric chemistry-it is a human rights issue. We
historians with interests in Arctic and polar regions must complement
this narrative by helping our colleagues in the natural and social
sciences confront the colonial legacies of their disciplines. [We must
also challenge the pervasive misconceptions about the Arctic held in the
communities we call home, misconceptions that, despite their
deconstruction in the scholarly literature, continue to produce
troubling political and material effects in the north]{.underline}. This
kind of publicly engaged history is not meant to discredit scientists,
or reject science in meeting environmental challenges. Rather, it
reorients our discussions from the sites where warming is most obvious
to the places and processes that drive climate change and globalization.

[The [century of science, intervention, and environmental
transformation]{.mark} at the center of this book properly [begins with
the International Polar Year]{.mark} of 1881-83.]{.underline} We have
already seen that [the age of British and Russian [imperialism in the
Arctic incorporated scientists]{.mark} and generated landscape
change.]{.underline} We can set this year apart from that earlier era,
though, for a few reasons. First, [the [Polar Year earned sponsorship
from US federal agencies]{.mark}-the national museum and the Revenue
Cutter Service-[to deploy trained scientists to collect knowledge
in]{.mark} direct [support of resource extraction]{.mark}, [without
regard for]{.mark} issues of [sovereignty or ownership]{.mark}. Second,
and more importantly, the **enrollment of [professional science in
service of US empire displaced Inuit in ways imperial]{.mark} fur
[traders never did. ]{.mark}**]{.underline}Whalers and naturalists
established themselves as experts over Arctic nature, developing a body
of knowledge about marine life, surf, skies, tides, and ice that rivaled
that of Inuit. Fur traders and collectors had relied solely on Inuit as
harvesters, interacting with them mostly at the post. [Now [imperial
agents used science to effect exploitation]{.mark} within the same
territories where Inuit operated-a direct [challenge to Inuit
authority]{.mark}.]{.underline} The details of the International Polar
Year draw out these distinctions. If science and commerce had been
related in British and Russian empire, they were married in the American
version. [Under the command of Lieutenant Patrick Ray, ten men left from
San Francisco for the Alaskan Arctic slope with the mission of making
\"a [three-year unbroken series of]{.mark} weather and magnetic
[observations]{.mark}!\' Their task [reflected]{.mark} both the
[importance]{.mark} of Arctic whaling [to the US economy and]{.mark} the
interests of [world scientific communities]{.mark}.]{.underline} At the
close of the 1870s, scientists convened a series of international
conferences, wherein the United States joined Austria, Norway, Sweden,
Denmark, and Russia to coordinate global observations of meteorological
phenomena in the circumpolar basin. At the time, meteorologists
understood that \"the weather in high latitudes held the key to the
behaviour of the atmosphere on wide scales!\' Perhaps not surprisingly,
weather and navigation studies were also \"of practical interest to the
whaling industry;\' which had lost so many vessels in the Bering and
Beaufort Seas in the 1860s and 1870s. 25 [The [scientists
recruited]{.mark} to carry out these duties were unique from earlier
collectors in Arctic history, even if they came from a familiar
institution. The Smithsonian\'s two recruits for the International Polar
Year, naturalists John Murdoch and Middleton Smith, [held
discipline-specific training.]{.mark}]{.underline} They were not, in
contrast, fur traders pulling double duty as gentleman collectors, as
was the case with Roderick MacFarlane in the early 1860s. Murdoch held a
master\'s degree from Harvard in zoology. When the Smithsonian invited
him to go to Alaska, he was teaching zoology at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison. After returning from the north, he worked with
leading botanist Asa Gray and took a position as librarian at the
Smithsonian, where he consulted the expanding Arctic collections in
crafting a series of publications about Inuit culture in the 1890s. In
ways similar to Murdoch, scientists in the coming century leveraged the
expansion of the North American political economy for the elaboration of
professional careers in science. 26 [[As testament to the role of the
Beaufort Sea in academic and colonial development]{.mark} in the United
States, [whalers and scientists developed]{.mark} a [comprehensive
knowledge about ice]{.mark}.]{.underline} The writings of Hartson
Bodfish, a New England-born whaler who amassed more than thirty years of
Arctic experience, suggest the success of a whaler stemmed from their
hydrological education. Bodfish offered vivid details to readers, surely
to help them avoid crushing defeat in an ice pack. When about to freeze,
the ice would \"mass together and keep getting larger and larger, then
it piles into points and ridges;\' he wrote. To determine if existing
ice is new (and thin) or old (and thus a threat to a ship\'s hull), take
note of its color, he said. \"When the ice is new it is slightly darker
than the water;\' he cautioned, \"but most of it is dirty from the dust
blowing from the shore and looks more like mud than anything else.\'\'
Whalers recognized relationships between ice and wind, as changing wind
directions and intensities could shift the ice pack instantaneously,
presenting hazards to vessels. Knowledge about ice and wind also helped
whalers locate whales. In explaining the migration patterns of bowheads
in the Alaskan Arctic, whaler Jim Allen noted, \"I would say it\'s the
ice and wind conditions that make the difference. There are no two years
the same in the Arctic Ocean.\'\' 27 [Scientific fieldwork also
concentrated on the interface of surf and sky. In doing so, [scientists
reoriented imperial knowledge]{.mark} from terrestrial ecosystems and
economies in the mid-18oos to their marine counterparts by the
1890s.]{.underline} Because the expedition\'s primary objective was
meteorological, Murdoch and Smith were required to serve \"two four-hour
watches each day,\" during which they \"recorded general weather
conditions and took hourly meteorological readings.\'\' Smith\'s journal
entries reveal how this position trained him to look outward and
upward-and not at the ground in front or behind him. He recorded the
daily levels of barometric pressure, temperature, prevailing wind
direction, and wind velocity, eventually computing monthly averages for
these measurements. He also noted the number of foggy days, cloudy days,
and days in which the northern lights were visible. He maintained an
interest in the state of ice, jotting the presence of cracks and the
movements of the ice pack from shore. 28 [The [International Polar
Year]{.mark}, then, [transformed the Arctic environment]{.mark}. Once
the northern limit of the fur trade, the Beaufort Sea coast was now the
southern edge of the commercial whaling industry. Moreover, both
[whalers and scientists could operate]{.mark} within this environment
[on their own]{.mark}, [in direct competition with Inuit]{.mark}, by
refining knowledge about marine biology, hydrology, and
meteorology]{.underline}. When scientists and military officials
confirmed Point Barrow as a safe harbor on shore, the expedition
solidified this change. [The federal government delayed appropriations
for a relief station there, but [private enterprise moved forward with
its own plans. ]{.mark}]{.underline}In 1884, the Pacific Steam Whaling

#### Scientific research is part of the [colonial epistemology]{.underline} that erases Indigenous knowledge 

**Reeploeg, 23**---Associate Professor, Department of Cultural & Social

thinking: lessons from the Arctic," History Education Research Journal,

[Places such as the Arctic are often represented as subject to, rather
than active participants]{.underline} in, [imperial and colonial
historical processes and memory narratives]{.underline}. Inhabitants of
the circumpolar north often find themselves erased from their own
homelands in the 'empty, icy North', described as progress-aversive
ethno-types, colonial possessions, or the focus of thinly disguised
racialisation and exotification (Arke, 2006; Nagy, 2008). As in other
parts of the world, **[[written scientific]{.mark} and historical
[knowledge]{.mark} developed concurrently to imperial
relationships]{.underline}** (Egede Lynge, 2006[). This [forms
part]{.mark} of the techniques of [colonial]{.mark} reimagining and
[re-engineering of geographic and ecological
domains]{.mark}]{.underline}, ethnic boundaries and national identities
(Carretero et al., 2012).

[Scientific expeditions]{.underline}, in particular, were and [are a
central part of]{.underline} a global network of incomers [producing
knowledge about a 'developing' colonial world]{.underline} (Stuhl,
2016). However, [while]{.underline} colonisation historically brought
local colonial administrators, and [historiographies written by colonial
powers]{.underline}, [[Indigenous historians]{.mark}, artists, musicians
and storytellers also [created their own]{.mark} historical
[narratives]{.mark}]{.underline} and memory cultures concurrently
(Møller and McLisky, 2021; H.C. Petersen, 1991). [This was]{.underline}
and is [done using existing, place-based, historical literacy,
vocabularies and languages, while]{.underline} at the same time
[[contributing to]{.underline}]{.mark} the development of new
[[scientific disciplines]{.mark} such as geography]{.underline}, by
taking part in the collection and publication of descriptions and
natural histories of local places for global audiences (Sellheim et al.,
2019). So, for example, the first books printed in Nuuk during the mid-
to late nineteenth century combined a pluriverse of Greenlandic cultural
and historical knowledges. These multi-authored publications featured
both graphic illustrations and narratives about the past, in its widest
sense (Amon et al., 1860; Berthelsen et al., 1859). The second book of
an initial quartet, for example, contains 80 works by 24 authors, in
Kalaallit (Greenlandic), with danish translations and summaries. Other
publications provided english and french translations and illustrations
thought to be of interest to international audiences. However[, the
materials were also, over time, decontextualised and assimilated into
ethnographic and literary collections]{.underline} (Rink, 2022) and
consequent canonisation literature (Kaalund, 1997; Kangermio et al.,
1860). So, on the one hand, the work can be seen as illustrative of how
Greenlanders have made 'their own significant interventions in national
discussions around identity, economics, and politics' all along (Møller
and McLisky, 2021: 711). On the other hand, [the materials at the heart
of these publications [were]{.mark} also [subsequently removed]{.mark}
and dispersed]{.underline} (delegated) [to colonial archives, and
rearranged [and censored according to european]{.mark} premises,
including the [values]{.mark}, tastes [and ideas]{.mark} of]{.underline}
individual collectors, [institutions]{.underline} and audiences
(Kaalund, 1997). [To teach history]{.underline} with these materials
today not only [means]{.underline} acknowledging this process of
delegation and predetermination, but also **[identifying ways to
interrupt the coloniality of knowledge production]{.underline}** (Arke,
2006; Berthelsen, 2020; Silova et al., 2017).

While initially an attempt to aid intercultural understanding and mutual
respect, [the process]{.underline} described above also
[[produced]{.mark} an [ignorance of Indigenous ways of knowing]{.mark}
and valuing [by assimilating]{.mark} and delegating entire world views,
relationships and cultural competencies [into western epistemic
structures]{.mark} and habits]{.underline} (Graugaard, 2016; Jessen
Williamson, 2006; Öhman, 2017). Here is where [historical thinking, [as
a colonial epistemic habit]{.mark}, closely connects to other
methodologies of western scientific research. **[Scientific
research]{.mark} was and [is]{.mark}, in turn, [implicated in
colonialism and imperialism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and in how
'knowledge about indigenous peoples was collected, classified and
represented back to the West, and then through the eyes of the West,
back to those who have been colonized' (Smith, 2006: 30).

The emergence of this New Arctic accentuates the significance of the
historical issues that concern us in these internationally comparative
and interdisciplinary explorations of the history of science and
environmental knowledge in the far north, especially during the
twentieth century. [Without historical insight, long-term patterns and
consequences of colonial administration, resource exploitation, and
military logic are impossible to discern, let alone analyze and
address.]{.underline} Historical perspective illuminates the [new
geo-economics of the Arctic with its changing land- and seascapes by
contextualizing the ways in which both natural and social sciences have
constructed the environmental knowledge that informs policy-makers,
industrial entrepreneurs, and other stakeh]{.underline}olders. These
essays are the first results from the research team 'Colony, Empire, and
Environment: A Comparative International History of Twentieth Century
Arctic Science', funded through the BOREAS initiative of the European
Science Foundation and highlighting thehistorical roots of the New
Arctic.21 Each offers an integrated, comparative, transnational
historical analysis, echoing the historian John V. Pickstone's call for
'more wide-ranging and more "constructive" histories' that build upon
multiple perspectives.22 In part, our challenge has been to develop
transnational roadmaps for interpreting the historical trajectories of
science and technology in high latitudes. Just as modernity transformed
northern landscapes materially, [with new harbors, settlements, mines,
military bases, and research centres, as well as with new hunting and
fishing methods, so it produced ideological transformation. Western
interpretations of Arctic landscapes altered dramatically about 1945. In
the years since, several branches of science have adopted postcolonial
modes of thinking about the landscapes and cultures of the north.
We]{.underline} examine these shifts in several phases, with evidence
that their related processes cut unevenly, as older dichotomies between
centre and periphery, between metropolitan science and local knowledge,
exerted e and still maintain e uneven influences around the circumpolar
Arctic. In these ways, [CEE members regard environmental and scientific
(both natural and social) knowledge as cultural products with their own
uneven histories.]{.underline}We attempt what cultural anthropologist
Ann Laura Stoler has urged, to 'refocus our historical lens on
distinctions between what is residual and tenacious, what is dominant
but hard to see, and not least what is emergent in today's imperial
formations e and critically resurgent in responses to them'.
23Addressing these general themes raises the challenges of
periodization. [The centuries-long 'fur trade and mission' period
identified by the Canadian politician and jurist Thomas R. Berger (1933e
) as characterizing life in North America's arctic sector at least until
the 1950s24 remains a helpful, but increasingly cramped, guide to the
complexities of the circumpolar north. It offers little or no guidance
for understanding whale- or seal hunting or mining, early modern Nordic
treaty accommodations with the Sámi way of life, or the rapid rise of
Soviet prowessin the Arctic during the 1930s]{.underline}.While the
Second World War affected most regions of the Arctic, American military
preoccupationwith the north after 1945 found no parallels elsewhere.
Moreover, new trends in the historical literature have begun to question
older narratives of Arctic exceptionalism. They challenge not just older
region-specific heroic narratives (including those involving Robert
Peary (1856e1920) for the United States and Fridtjof Nansen (1861e1930)
for Norway), but also the still powerful late twentieth-century
narrative of the Arctic as a global environmental bellwether, a frigid
living laboratory where researchers unlock truthsabout global climate
change and the vulnerability of the Arctic (and indeed global)
environment. In these discourses, the [far north represents a largely
pristine environment readily analyzed by modern science, urged on by
details of rising temperatures challenging indigenous peoples'
lifestyles and threatening the existence of wildlife species, especially
iconic polar bears.25 Often forgotten is a legacy of colonial
geographers and field scientists who lent support to processes of
industrial exploitation by 'unlocking' the natural resources of polar
regions for the benefit of more southern societies]{.underline}.26 The
Arctic's legendary status encouraged the growing interest of humanists
and social scientists in understanding polar science especially as part
of the most recent IPY, in 2007e2008. Their works e addressing such
topics as the interfaces of national claims, international boundaries,
and research communities; trans-border research networks; shifting
definitions of professionalism; the interfaces of Western science
andindigenous ways of knowing; and applications of new technologies to
exploration and settlement e have yielded narratives that are richer,
more complex, andmore vitally interconnected with regions to the south
than earlier accounts had suggested.27 Mostimportant, questions asked by
these scholars are at last in step with the farsighted postcolonial
challenges that Thomas Berger articulated so eloquently more than a
quarter of a century ago, urging Canadian citizens and policymakers to
abandon traditional narratives of domination and conquest: 'What happens
in the North', especially from the perspective of those to whom it
represents not frontier but homeland, Berger insisted, 'will tell us
what kind of a peoplewe are'. 28The more recent Arctic narratives derive
in large part from two interconnected shifts. First, while turning their
attention northward, historians of science have sought to reconnect
Arctic history with crucial themes already under investigation in other
parts of the globe, including not only the major industrialized nations
but also remote regions of Antarctica and the tropics.29 Scholars
increasingly recognize that field practices in the far north share key
characteristics with those employed elsewhere around the globe, where
issues of national styles and patronage loom large. Research in the
physical and biological sciences in the Arctic region, in part
reinforced by the International Polar Years, was intimately connected to
research programmes conceived in temperate regions. And while research
in Antarctica was certainly distinct from its northern counterpart (in
large part because there are no indigenous populations there, and the
Cold War-era Antarctic Treaty helped to stabilize southern geopolitics),
scholars have recognized that in terms of concerns over climate change,
tourism, sovereignty, foreign policy, national prestige, and
geopolitical influence, the Arctic and Antarctic are not 'poles apart'.
30 [Indeed, histories of field experience, crucial to many branches of
life- and earth-sciences, especially in polar regions, have gained
importance as reflections of the ways in which international political
conflicts]{.underline}, and their resultant demands for certain kinds of
geographic knowledge, shaped perceptions of the north and determined the
kinds of research undertaken there. [Polar researchers in turn gained
authority from their exclusive field experiences, playing multiple roles
as colonial advisors, experts on northern geopolitics and industrial
development, and eventually also as]{.underline} environmental
activists. In particular, as Igor [Krupnik and Paul Cutler observe, the
history of science and its polar legacy played important roles in the
development of the most recent IPY in 2007e2008, by both 'generat\[ing\]
grass-roots enthusiasm and marshal\[ling\] disciplinary and
institutional resources'.]{.underline} 31The second shift involves the
scope and framing of these inquiries. Most early histories of the Arctic
were national in focus. In addressing largely unexplored topics, it made
sense to begin with historical resources and archival collections
available within individual national contexts. Much excellent
scholarship flowed from these efforts, including William Goetzmann's and
Kay Sloan's examination of the United States' late nineteenth-century
Harriman expedition to Alaska; Trevor Levere's classic survey of Science
in the Canadian Arctic; and the more recent Einar-Arne Drivenes and
Harald Dag Jølle (Eds), Into the Ice: The History of Norway and the
Polar Regions. 32 More recent studies embrace wider geographic and
thematic horizons. They demonstrate how field science was deployed to
help demarcate international boundaries and create cartographic
constructions of 'new land' during the age of colonialism.33 They also
investigate cultural, geographic, and scientific themes that linked high
latitudes and high elevations in popular thought and in selections of
physical sites for scientific research.34 The challenge of revising
older narratives of Arctic science, at its intersections with
environmental history, diplomatic history, social history, cultural
studies, and the history of technology, is large; the rewards are also
great. If earlier writers and scholars saw an Arctic populated by
explorers emblematic of the rapidly advancing industrial societies that
funded them, scholars now understand more fully the importance of ghost
writers who adjusted expeditionaccounts to cater to a popular readership
that preferred chauvinistic clichés and wilderness images permeated by
the Arctic sublime. Celebrated field diaries were published in edited
versions that ignored recurring issues of miscalculation, underfunding,
poor preparation, ineffective teamwork, and feckless leadership.
Continuing accounts of personal sacrifice for higher national and
altruistic scientific causes made sense in light of the disasters of the
Great War. [But crucial roles played by indigenous and other nonwhite
advisers, comrades, and colleagues were likewise suppressed, including
traditional knowledge and sexual encounters shared en route by
indigenous peoples and local settlers.3]{.underline}5 Investigating late
nineteenth-century American Arctic expeditions, Michael F. Robinson
shows how the desire of prominent newspaper publishers (such as the New
York Herald's James Gordon Bennett Jr. (1841e1918)) to capture readers
through serial dramas of exploration in high latitudes shaped lasting
and influential Arctic narratives for more than a century. Sir Henry
Morton Stanley's (1841e1904) successful search in Africa for the missing
Dr. David Livingstone (1813e1873) in 1871 encouraged the practice of
sending a journalist where scientists failed. When the American
journalist Walter Wellman (1858e1934) made several attempts to reach the
North Pole in a dirigible e years before Robert Peary's (now doubtful)
claim to have attained it in 1909 e his exploits were touted in
newspapers worldwide.36Recent scholarship has also shown that Arctic
science has included much more than ice-breakers charting the loss of
sea ice and the effects of climate change on charismatic northern
species. Beyond the Cold War militarization of the far north,
researchers are providing new insights into interconnections among
issues of economic development, national security, and state
sovereignty. In the USSR, Stalin's determination rapidly to expand the
state's planned economy led to the relocation of large numbers of people
into Arctic Russia and Siberia in order to facilitate the industrial
exploitation of these regions.37 A quite different situation emerged in
northern Canada, when the government of Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent
relocated three Inuit families from Hudson Bay to remote Ellesmere
Island during the early 1950s. Here, motivations were likely mixed:
while the relocation seemed justified at the time by declining fish and
game stocks, the policy of creating new settlements near 81 north
latitude also supported Canadian claims to sovereignty over its
northernmost territory. After the Cold War ended, this action fueled
longlasting resentment among Inuit who charged that the resettled family
members had been used as 'human flagpoles'. 38 [Such colonial practices,
which Stoler includes among the most 'visceral' evidence of 'the
forceful presence of imperial debris', were intimately interwoven with
modern developments in science and technology. They were far from
forgotten in the late twentieth century when Nunavut became Canada's
newest territory and Greenland began moving towards
self-rule.39]{.underline}

invasion,16) bring changes to the land with built infrastructure,17) and
introduce the risk of contamination, such as oil spills.18) The
resulting decreased viability of subsistence practices is worsened by
the threat climate change poses to hunting and gathering activities.19)

Although some measures of physical health have improved since
ANCSA,^20)^ [[resource extraction]{.mark} [can compromise the health and
wellbeing of]{.mark} nearby [Indigenous
populations]{.mark}.]{.underline} Significant health disparities remain
among Alaska Natives compared to non-native Alaskans and other US
residents. [Generally[, Alaska Natives]{.mark} have a [lower life
expectancy, increased risk of cardiovascular]{.mark} disease,
[and]{.mark} an elevated burden of [infectious
disease]{.mark}]{.underline}.^21)^ By exacerbating food insecurity, the
negative impacts of resource development may contribute to and worsen
health outcomes. Many of these disparities are rooted in the history of
colonialism and socio-political marginalization; in addition, their
persistence today may be attributed to the disproportionate exposure to
environmental health hazards.^22)^ Moreover, some researchers have found
that health data fails to produce a holistic picture of well-being,
suggesting that there must be a greater consideration for
context-specific understandings of health status.^23)^

Importantly, the effects of resource development are not felt uniformly
by Alaska Natives. Instead, various facets of identity among individuals
and communities impact how they relate to extractive activities.
Socioeconomic class divisions,^24)^ gender identity,^25)^ one's location
in a rural versus urban setting,^26)^ and many other factors can all
impact how resource development is experienced. The complexity of the
relationship between resource development and Indigenous populations,
and the diversity within the Alaska Native population, must not be
ignored or simplified.

Sovereignty and the prioritization of state interests

To decolonize resource development, Alaska Native populations must have
greater control over the process. In other words, one overarching aim of
decolonization in practice is Indigenous sovereignty. However,
[[(neo)colonial narratives]{.mark} shape and [are ingrained
within]{.mark} the traditional concept of [state-centered
sovereignty]{.mark}]{.underline}. Within this concept, [the aims of the
government are continually prioritized; [a hierarchy is established
where]{.mark}by [the interests and concerns of the state are given
primacy]{.mark}]{.underline}.^27)^ This dynamic is one of the reasons
why[, [in the case of]{.mark} Alaska and [Alaska Native populations,
resource development continues to be experienced as a colonial
enterprise.]{.mark}]{.underline} [The gains from extractive activities
do not necessarily or primarily benefit Alaska Native
populations,28) and the interests of outside actors are
prioritized.29)]{.underline} Oftentimes, wealth from resource
development has been extracted from northern regions to benefit other
populations.^30)^ An evaluation of the Red Dog Mine in northwest Alaska,
for instance, found that the local population received a relatively
modest share of benefits in terms of employment, income, and
mobility.^31)^ 

As established through ANCSA, the Regional Corporations are the primary
route for Alaska Native participation in governing resource development
in the US Arctic. These corporations, however, operate under US
corporate law and, therefore, within the frameworks of the capitalist
order. Participation through the structure of the Regional Corporations,
thus, limits the opportunity for Alaska Native populations to achieve
self-determination outside of those conventions. In action, considering
the embeddedness of the corporations within the capitalist and colonial
dynamics of the state, decolonization may necessitate enhancing the
power of and regard for local governments rather than governing resource
development principally through the Regional Corporations.

Prioritization of Western knowledge and conventions

[[A deep-rooted colonial mentality]{.mark} that remains pervasive [is
the assumed supremacy of a Western knowledge
system]{.mark}]{.underline}. This creates a paternalistic relationship
wherein [[decisions are made by external 'experts' and imposed upon the
Indigenous population]{.mark}.]{.underline} [In short, [Indigenous ways
of knowing are undermined]{.mark}.]{.underline}^32)^ The term Indigenous
knowledge is defined as "the understandings, skills and philosophies
developed by societies with long histories of interaction with their
natural surroundings".^33^) [Efforts to decolonize resource development
in the US Arctic must not only embrace these different worldviews,
perspectives, and knowledge systems, but put them first.]{.underline}

[[For many]{.mark} in Western Europe and North America, [the]{.mark}
unfamiliar [Arctic]{.mark}, including Greenland, [is still]{.mark} a
mainly [empty]{.mark} space, sinister and wild, [with only]{.mark} a
smattering of [people whose presence is of minimal
consequence]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Colonialism]{.underline} has long
impacted Greenland and other parts of the Arctic; thus, [it is part of
Greenland's present and future as well as its past]{.underline},
supported by actions such as regular visits of Crown Prince Frederick
and Crown Princess Mary of Denmark. This parallels the Canadian approach
to the Arctic by former Conservative Prime Minister Stephen Harper, who
made annual Arctic visits (Dodds, 2011) and in 2007 declared, 'Canada's
Arctic is central to our national identity as a northern nation. It is
part of our history. And it represents the tremendous potential of our
future' (Lajeunesse, 2008, p. 2--3). Colonialism requires vivid
emotional props and the imaginaries created in texts by Hayes, Peary,
Bartlett and others provided them as do royalty and prime ministers
today[. [Colonialism in the Arctic]{.mark} is not merely a setting, a
context or historical events; instead, it [is a permanent]{.mark} aspect
of the [way futures are envisioned]{.mark}, as Sejersen puts it (2015),
and a logical, if unfortunate outcome, of the cumulative effects of past
activities]{.underline}, including those of explorers, and the
persistent ideas these activities reinforced. As Doreen Massey says,
'Rethinking a politics of place, or nation, is an emotionally charged
issue' (2004, p. 2). This is true for the Danes as well as for the
people of Greenland. Although colonialism was iterative and
shape-changing, Greenlandic Inuit have had to engage in a long difficult
struggle toward a return to self-determination and, in the modern era,
sovereignty that may not be Westphalian (Shadian, 2010); this campaign
continues. The Artic has played an important but overlooked role in the
history of European trade, which is the history of colonialism; in turn,
the pivotal place of explorers in this narrative is rarely emphasized.
When Peary claimed the north pole and Norwegian Raold Amundsen
(1872--1928), the south pole, each planting their respective flags,
Europe was effectively claiming ownership of both ends of the earth. The
flag-plantings were symbolic but, given the extent of European power,
the symbolism was potent and extended beyond itself to have real world
meaning for the Antarctic and the Arctic, especially for the Indigenous
people of the Arctic. Flag-planting gave Europe and the then-ascendant
American state the right to rule and naturalized this right (Farley,
2005, p. 238), following Hayes' comments about the natural rights of the
Danes in Greenland some 40 years before and, after that, Bartlett's
similar assessment and the Pearys' condescending approach. This
understanding of the Arctic's, including Greenland's, seemingly natural
place in global geopolitics has persisted leading through to the present
time. [[Today]{.mark} the Arctic is the site of international struggle
as Canada, Denmark and [other northern countries continue to stake their
Arctic claims and]{.mark} as international [industrialists]{.mark}, such
as international mining companies and research scientists, [bring the
region into their scope]{.mark}.]{.underline} Isaac Hayes' approbation
of the Danish presence in Greenland was one example of how [[explorers
legitimized Arctic regions as cookie jars for outside interests]{.mark},
[using alleged Inuit inferiority]{.mark}]{.underline}, as did Peary and
Bartlett, [[as]{.mark} a]{.underline} lamentable
[[justification]{.underline}]{.mark}. There is, however, an important
place for Greenlandic Inuit knowledge and approaches to resource-use and
genuine dialogue could lead to common understandings and potential
benefits (Danielsen et al., 2014). Ignoring or sidelining Inuit is, at
best, a missed opportunity. Meanwhile, the Arctic is changing rapidly
due to climate change, itself a result of the post-Cold War entrenchment
of the neoliberal agenda with its emphasis on rentseeking natural
resource exploitation (Hinzman et al., 2005; Post et al., 2009); thus,
climate change can be viewed, alongside the demise of the hunter
economy, as a legacy of colonialism. Climate change in the Arctic is a
matter of some urgency as it is placing significant adaptive demands on
the people who live there (Wolf, Allice, & Bell, 2013), including their
mental health (Willox et al., 2015). [[Those with]{.mark} lingering
[influence]{.mark} in the Arctic [are allowing]{.mark} polar [ice caps
to melt]{.mark} an alarming rate [and]{.mark} animal [species to
decline]{.mark} and so on [because their objectives]{.mark} continue to
[reflect long-dominant imaginaries which]{.mark} prevent the development
of knowledge, understanding and empathy and [preclude approaches that
are not neoliberal]{.mark}. [The Arctic]{.mark},]{.underline} including
Greenland, [has been effectively rendered and [remains]{.mark}
unimportant except as [a site of]{.mark} natural [resource exploitation
and the generation of profits to external actors]{.mark}.]{.underline}
This is the highly challenging and charged framework within which
Greenland's and other Arctic leaders must operate. While the adventure
legacy of Arctic explorers is celebrated, the moral legacy of Hayes,
Peary, Rasmussen and others must be considered, especially in light of
its enduring influence and effect on the people of the Arctic.

Sovereignty,

Considering how the United States, Canada, and Russia express
sovereignty, rather than protecting states from outside threats, each
states' versions of expressing security and sovereignty are merely
serving to reinforce hierarchies. [Thus, rather than thinking of
[sovereignty]{.mark} purely [as]{.mark} a **neutral [tool]{.mark}** [in
which]{.mark} [Western states]{.mark} [express]{.mark} their
[power]{.mark} [over]{.mark} [**non-Western** entities]{.mark}, I argue
that sovereignty in the [Arctic]{.mark} is [heavily influenced]{.mark}
by **[neocolonial narratives]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} thus the traditional
[state-centered]{.mark} **conception [of sovereignty]{.mark}** should
therefore change to acknowledge three things.]{.underline} First, the
shifting geography of the Arctic which makes establishing sovereignty
difficult if not impossible (domestic sovereignty). Second, the history
and role of Indigenous Peoples who live there (both in enhancing the
international legal sovereignty of Indigenous people and giving them
more power). Finally, shared sovereignty as a better fit as it will make
a more equitable and historically grounded Arctic version of
sovereignty. Adopting a decolonial lens allows scholars to see that
sovereignty in general creates a normative hierarchy that places the
non-West as 'othered' in opposition to the inherently sovereign West
(White, 2019). This hierarchy that Western states use suggests that
neocolonial narratives continue to influence the way they view security
and sovereignty in the Arctic. Non-Western perspectives on conservation,
for example, are consulted but not placed on the same valuation as
perspectives of Western science, academia, and industry.
[[State-centered threats]{.mark} [from]{.mark} **[China]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} **[Russia]{.mark}** are [given]{.mark} **[more
weight]{.mark}** [than real **individual
insecurities**]{.mark}]{.underline} arising from food, water, and
environmental insecurity. States contribute to individual insecurities
by doing so. [Thus, [non-West]{.mark} [perspectives]{.mark} are
[devalued]{.mark} [in]{.mark} reference not only to
[conservation]{.mark}, but [also]{.mark} other questions related to
[climate change]{.mark}. **[Traditional]{.mark} security**
[lenses]{.mark} [neither]{.mark} [acknowledge]{.mark} this
**[neocolonial power structuring]{.mark}** [nor]{.mark} [fully]{.mark}
[reflect]{.mark} the **[contestation of
sovereignty]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Some scholars have already argued
that sovereignty is contested in the Arctic due to the region's
constantly changing geography as well as the distance between nonArctic
capitals and the Arctic (Gerhardt et al., 2010). First, the adverse
effects of climate change continue to change Arctic geography as well as
geopolitical realities. An updated understanding of Arctic sovereignty
should acknowledge that enacting domestic sovereignty may not be fully
possible. By trying to maintain the same understanding of land and
territory as before that use colonial understandings of ecological
imperialism when relating to land, one cannot really approach and think
about climate change in a productive manner. Thus, the same kind of
expressions of domestic sovereignty, then, should also be reduced in
order to think more critically about climate adaptation and mitigation
strategies. Second, the history and [[role of **Indigenous peoples**
should]{.mark} also [be]{.mark} more broadly
**[acknowledged]{.mark}**]{.underline} in this updated version of Arctic
sovereignty. [Doing so gives them **more legal power**]{.underline} and
sovereignty [over decisions that impact their livelihood]{.underline}.
While Inuit sovereignty is key to Canada's broader Arctic claims, it is
by no means the norm across Arctic states. Further, [acknowledgement is
only one part]{.underline} of the equation. With more scholarly
attention being paid towards the importance of TEK and other
contributions from Indigenous people, so too should sovereignty in the
Arctic reflect that role. [Going beyond]{.underline} acknowledgement
here [would [serve]{.mark} to give [Indigenous peoples]{.mark} **more
legal sovereignty** [to take part in **decision-making** about the
Arctic]{.mark}, something that is sorely lacking now]{.underline}.
Bringing in those voices may seem like a small step, but it would
empower Indigenous Peoples, acknowledging that they too are important
players in the Arctic. Acknowledging this new kind of sovereignty is in
line with what Indigenous leaders are already saying, particularly in
reference to the publication of 'A Circumpolar Inuit Declaration on
Sovereignty in the Arctic' by the Inuit Circumpolar Council in April
2009. Among other claims, the declaration argues that issues of
sovereignty must be assessed in the Inuit's context of a long history of
exercising self-determination and that the Inuit have been ignored in
Arctic sovereignty discussions. [When thinking about the role of
Indigenous people]{.underline} in Arctic sovereignty, thus, [it **[goes
beyond any one state's claim to sovereignty]{.mark}** in the Arctic
**[on a territorial level]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Scholarly, policy, and
activist attention ought to be paid to bringing attention and
acknowledgement to the way Indigenous People use sovereignty. Third,
Arctic policymakers and scholars should consider that [**shared
sovereignty** may be a more equitable and historically grounded version
of Arctic sovereignty]{.underline}. From an Indigenous perspective,
sovereignty has a different meaning and can be helpful here when
imagining how a shared sovereignty can work in the real world. First,
Indigenous conceptions of sovereignty are social and cultural ways of
understanding community -- and thus sovereignty is often linked to an
ability to carry out normal life activities. Therefore, shared
sovereignty in the Arctic can reflect that, acknowledging that
geopolitical competition and increased oil and gas extraction are
threats to that sovereignty. Second, Indigenous approaches to
sovereignty also take a relational approach, thinking about how land and
people interrelate and the importance of being heard in deliberations
between people. In action, this could mean focusing more on the [[Arctic
institutions]{.underline}]{.mark} that exist and
[[givi]{.underline}]{.mark}ng [more [power to **Indigenous
People**]{.mark} in those institutions to be heard and speak [rather
than]{.mark}]{.underline} giving power to **[[states
alone]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In a future Arctic that will be inevitably
changed by the advent of climate change, people and collectives will
have to work together to solve these larger collective-action problems.
This feeds into a third way that Indigenous sovereignty can inform
shared sovereignty. While [[Westphalian sovereignty treats **land**
as]{.mark} an **[exploitable]{.mark}** resource, Indigenous sovereignty
sees land as something to be cared for]{.underline}, the other part of a
reciprocal relationship between people and land. What use is having
sovereignty over a place if it is not cared for or is not productive?
[[Shared sovereignty]{.mark} in action]{.underline} here [would
be]{.underline} a **[[reframing]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the [[Arctic
as a place for **cooperative action**]{.mark} to care for the land as
the **primary objective of sovereignty.**]{.underline}

#### The 1AC's narrative securitization of the Arctic [ontologically secures]{.underline} the colonial American state against settler [anxiety]{.underline}.

**Gricius, 22**---Ph.D. student in the Department of Political Science
at Colorado State University (Gabriella, "Pulling back the curtain:
coloniality-based narratives of wilderness in US Arctic policy," The
Polar Journal, 12:2, 198-214, dml)

When we consider wilderness through the lens of settler colonialism, it
is important to first consider terminology. Scholars define settler
colonialism in differing but important ways. While Eichler and
Baumeister (Citation2021) suggest it is the commitment of settlers to
establish themselves permanently in the periphery,Footnote15 Coulthard
(Citation2014) argues that the settler-colonial relationship is one
characterised by domination, that this relationship exists to facilitate
the dispossession of Indigenous People.Footnote16 Todd (Citation2017)
proposes that settler colonialism reproduces the ideologies,
relationships, and physicality of colonialism as ongoing.Footnote17
Other scholars note that [**settler colonialism** is]{.underline} also
[premised on the]{.underline} idea that land is transformed into private
property.Footnote18 What these definitions have in common is that there
is some [continued relationship between coloniser]{.underline},
[colonised]{.underline}, [and land that uses naturalised social and
political **hierarchies**]{.underline}. This leads into thinking about
coloniality, which is key for the purpose of this article.
[Coloniality]{.underline}, simply put, [is what **survives**
colonialism]{.underline}.Footnote19 According to Maldonado-Torres
(Citation2007, 243), 'Coloniality, instead, refers to long-standing
patterns of power that emerged as a result of colonialism ... [it is
**maintained alive**]{.underline} in books, [in the **criteria for
academic performance**]{.underline}, [in **cultural
patterns**]{.underline}, [in **common sense**]{.underline}, in the
self-image of peoples, in aspirations of self, [and so many other
aspects of our modern experience]{.underline}.'Footnote20 If coloniality
is what exists today that is inherited from past colonial practices,
then we can assume that [these hierarchies are present in relations
between and within **states**]{.underline}, [as well as in
**policy**]{.underline}, **[knowledge production]{.underline}**, [and
across how states handle **creating policy** in the
**Arctic**]{.underline}.

While the argument that coloniality is alive and well today is
thoroughly addressed in the post-colonial, decolonial, and Indigenous
literature, ontological security studies (OSS) adds a new dimension to
the discussion. OSS has not traditionally addressed the continuation of
colonial legacies as a key part of state autobiographical narratives.
However, what OSS highlights is how [one of the mechanisms through which
coloniality is continued is through the selective activation and
deactivation of certain **narratives**]{.underline}.

Rather than focus on an actor's need for physical security,
[**ontological security** brings attention to security as
**being**]{.underline}. In other words, [ontological
security]{.underline} refers to an actor's need for a secure identity
that contains a sense of biographical continuity and [brings an emphasis
to what **stories** and **narratives** we tell ourselves about
ourselves]{.underline}, [the **relationship** we have with others and
the **land** we conquer]{.underline}, [live on]{.underline}, [or
occupy]{.underline}. Adopting [this]{.underline} lens [focuses attention
on the relationship between **anxiety** and **identity**]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} especially [how]{.underline} autobiographical
[narratives and routines **manage existential identity** as a daily yet
often **unconscious** process]{.underline}. In short, it leads us to ask
how do [specific narrative **anchor** state self-identity
and]{.underline} implies that these narratives [have an **impact** on
current stressors and problems]{.underline}.Footnote21 Thus, the
scholarship suggests that [scholars should seek out
**routines**]{.underline}, [particular **narratives** and how ideas are
held constant over time to **mitigate anxiety**]{.underline}.
[Anxiety]{.underline}, here, [is the **ordering principle** of how
states interact with the world and what they must manage to feel
secure]{.underline}. [States can never **solve** anxiety]{.underline},
[but they can **manage** it through routines and
narratives]{.underline}. OSS has been used to study
[securitisation]{.underline}, moral injury, narration of state identity,
radicalisation, and many other questions of international
politics.Footnote22

OSS [is a useful narrative for answering the question of how
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[conceptualises]{.underline} the wilderness in [its **Arctic
policy**]{.underline}. This is because [the type of narrative that
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [uses
is indicative of how it **manages existential anxiety** and how that
selection of narratives is chosen is key to understanding what
underlying principle **drives American Arctic policy**]{.underline}. In
other words, how does the United States manage its all-encompassing
existential anxiety in the regional case of the Arctic and what
narratives are at play? Which narratives are chosen can tell us
something about those underlying anxieties? Wilderness narratives point
to coloniality. Further, OSS draws attention to biographical continuity
-- an idea that this research aims to flesh out by considering
continuity in American Arctic policy across different presidencies and
administrations.

OSS literature has not often addressed the role of coloniality in the
shaping of state autobiographical narratives. While some scholars have
noted that established hierarchies, identities, and relationships play
an important role in colonial biographical continuity, this is far from
the norm.Footnote23 Instead, literature has looked at the role of
colonial subjugation -- namely that [the **emotional trauma** from
colonialisation has **influence** on how states react to
anxiety]{.underline}.Footnote24 Thus, bringing in understandings of
coloniality, particularly in how wilderness is conceived of, in
coloniser state identity is key for advancing OSS. Importantly, OSS can
also add to post-colonial, decolonial, and Indigenous literature when
considering the mechanisms through which coloniality is sustained. OSS
literature has discussed how [states selectively activate and deactivate
parts of their]{.underline} autobiographical [narratives to fit new
events and new anxieties into their worldview]{.underline}.Footnote25
The instrumental use of these narratives adds nuance to the discussion
of how places like [the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [may take **different stances** to the Arctic
over time]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} that [they **all rely on
coloniality** to reinforce power relations that place the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [on **top** of social
and political hierarchies]{.underline}.

Bringing together understandings of coloniality, settler colonialism,
wilderness, and ontological security is essential for the purposes of
this article. This is because I argue that in sustaining its ontological
security, the United States uses coloniality-based narratives of
wilderness in the broader context of settler colonialism. In other
words, [the mechanisms through which the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [supports its Arctic
policy reveal **coloniality-based narratives** of]{.underline}
wilderness, narratives which have been selectively activated throughout
different administrations (Bush, Obama, and Trump), suggesting that the
United States' **[ontological security]{.underline}** relies on such
framings.

[Plausible Indigenous suspicions about space programs]{.underline} also
[draw support from ongoing terrestrial cases in which [Indigenous rights
continue to]{.mark} [be **overridden** in the name of
tech]{.mark}nological needs [and scientific
inquiry]{.mark}]{.underline}. Here, [we may think of the ongoing
placement of telescopes on the sacred ground of Maunakea in Hawai\'i
against sustained Indigenous objections]{.underline} \[11\]. Or the
ongoing political tensions in French Guiana, the European Space
Agency\'s near-equatorial launch site used for the Ariane program
\[12\]. These tensions are charted in Peter Redfield\'s study Space in
the Tropics: From Convicts to Rockets in French Guiana (2000). A study
in which the concept of displacement figures even in times regarded as
post-colonial \[13\]. Whether or not we think in such post-colonial
terms, or in terms of colonialism as continuing structure, [**conflicts
are symptomatic of the difficulties** involved in getting out from under
colonialism\'s shadow]{.underline}. Here, we might think of the 2017
occupation of the launch pad at Guiana Space Center by Indigenous
protestors \[14\]. [[Cases]{.mark} of this sort can involve overriding
of Indigenous concerns, but sometimes they [involve]{.mark} a simple
**[failure to grasp]{.mark} what those [concerns]{.mark} are** or their
distinctiveness. In the case of the 2017 launch pad
occupation]{.underline}, [the Indigenous aspect of the protest tended to
be lost because it occurred within the context of a mass
strike]{.underline} \[15\]. [Coverage and settlement of the dispute
reproduced Indigenous marginalization in the face of a set of funding
concerns]{.underline} more familiar to government agencies and the
French public. [Similar [difficulties in]{.mark} [recognizing]{.mark},
or even making sense of, [Indigenous concerns]{.mark} [can]{.mark} also
[be tracked in]{.mark} Michael Sheehan\'s study of [the conflict between
the Sami]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the [Swedish government over the **Esrange
launch site**]{.mark}]{.underline} \[16\], [constructed in the 1960s and
sitting [above the Arctic Circle]{.mark} [with what the]{.mark}
[Swedish]{.mark} Space Corporation [describes]{.mark} [as "**a
vast**]{.mark}**, [unpopulated]{.mark} impact and recovery
[area]{.mark}**"]{.underline} \[17\]. For the Swedish government, the
site was ideal in terms of location and because it was wilderness. For
the Sami, it was on lands traditionally used for reindeer herding.
[[The]{.mark} initial [dispute has been compounded by a tendency to
re-read Indigenous concerns in line with]{.mark} dominant and
[non-Indigenous]{.mark} ecological [narratives]{.mark} as a matter of
worries about blast protection and fuel discharge]{.underline}. The
convenience of which is that once ecological concerns have been
addressed, there can be little more to complain about.

If the only problem was overriding, then the remedy might still be
thought of in terms of greater sensitivity and respect. But given cases
of failure to fully understand Indigenous concerns (ecological and more
than ecological) as legitimate concerns, inclusion does seem to be
called for. Not only in consultation processes, but also in project
planning and leadership. But inclusion also carries risks of
incorporation, co-opting and the use of client elites. No pathway to
Indigenous inclusion in space-related activities is entirely clear of
concern. Nor is there any prospect that the emerging narrative about
democratizing space will put everything right given that a difficult
tension sits at its heart. Smaller nations, and to some extent ESA, push
democratization through the admirable goal of greater international
inclusion in space activities. But they do so by working with
institutional legacies and political inequalities which date back to
colonial times or (in terms of a "structure not event" perspective)
count as straightforward cases of ongoing colonialism. Hence French
Guiana, hence the Esrange launch site. The upshot is that the
democratization of space can itself become suspect and draw more upon a
view of space simply as New Space for industry. Or as a competing ground
for techno-nationalist narratives \[18\] or for some other manner of
national and trans-national aspirations rather than thinking about space
as "place" \[19\] or as "a cultural landscape" \[20\], i.e., views which
allow a far greater role for concepts of heritage and cultural value.

Some of this calls upon local detail that may not filter through on a
global scale, although [[the predicament of the Sami is]{.mark} well
known across the Arctic]{.underline}. But [even if such cases, with
[a]{.mark} direct relation to space, were largely unknown outside of the
nations in which they occur, there would still be other [driver]{.mark}s
[for Indigenous suspicions about space programs]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[across the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} and in the Americas. In
particular, inte[rnationally [prominent cases of **Indigenous
sovereignty are**]{.mark} **being [set aside]{.mark}** [when the
commercial advantages of doing so appear]{.mark}
[overwhelming]{.mark}]{.underline}. The most recent case from North
America has been the construction of an oil supply route through Lakota
lands, leading to repeated, extensive, and well-publicized Indigenous

[[The notion of visiting]{.mark} and viewing distant and distinct
[Indigenous peoples tied]{.mark} in [to]{.mark} larger national and
transnational imperial [discourses]{.mark} [of the exotic]{.mark} and
foreign]{.underline}. As Julie Cruikshank and Robert Campbell have each
detailed[, Alaska and Africa were brought into a shared constellation
through the adventures of numerous explorers, those who traveled to both
destinations]{.underline}, such as young Edward James Glave, as well as
those who narrated their Alaskan adventure through a vocabulary of
African exploration.56 [[Tourists]{.mark} similarly [emphasized foreign
diference]{.mark} of Alaska Natives through Asian associations. Tourists
[described]{.mark} Native religious [practice as Asian idolatry,]{.mark}
such as one tourist's assertion]{.underline}, "Shamanism is a religion
of awful superstition which prevails in Northern Asia, consisting in a
belief in evil spirits, and in the necessity of averting their malign
influence by magic spells and horrid rites. The prevalence of this
religion among the Alaska Indians is one of the many evidences of their
Asiatic origins."57 [As this passage demonstrates, [tourists]{.mark}
often [felt compelled to describe]{.mark} and comment on [what they
found objectionable]{.mark} or repulsive. [Additional aspects]{.mark} of
Native culture, on the other hand, [met with praise]{.mark}. This was
true of Native material culture, particularly craftwork, as evidenced in
one tourist's praise for the Haida, who "excel in their stone carvings.
We saw some beautiful dark stone vases, very antique and oriental in
shapes."58 In both flattery and denunciation, the [tourist]{.mark}
[discourse]{.mark} of the other [depended]{.mark} [on]{.mark} a [foreign
and exotic Asianness]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Even though [American
tourists patriotically incorporated Ala]{.mark}ska into a larger sense
of national belonging, [such]{.mark} incorporation [was]{.mark} always
[premised on a future settlement]{.mark}, an [envisioning]{.mark} of
[the white settler nation]{.mark} to come. In terms of their present-
moment desires, however, tourist fascination was held by their ideas of
a pure and pristine landscape, unsullied by development, a sublime
expanse inhabited by a noble and primitive other. Even as industrial and
modern futures were touted and expressed, this forthcoming vision
contradicted imperial wishes to dwell in an imagined past, timeless and
remote.]{.underline} Such tensions underscore the ambivalence inherent
in settler orientalism, as Asian racialization indexed both imperial and
settler inclinations, projects tethered by colonial claims to space
produced through sentiments of otherness but diverging in vexed
transcendent and industrial visions. This contradiction can be
apprehended in part through historian John Kuo Wei Tchen's study of
American orientalism in the period before Chinese exclusion. As Tchen
elaborates, early American patrician orientalism that conveyed bourgeois
social status, distinct from European wealth, through Chinese objects
and curios, shifted to a commercial orientalism fascinated with Chinese
wealth even as China was seen to be a waning culture marked by despotism
and efeminate excess and "by the middle of the nineteenth century a
commodifying culture had arisen that was both adoring and hostile."59
[[Settler orientalism held this discordance]{.mark}, a colonial yearning
and dread marked and overlaid by American concerns [for]{.mark}
[expansion]{.mark} and inclusion indexed by the figure of the Alaska
Native, simultaneously Indigenous and foreign.]{.underline}

### AT: Arctic Council=Good

#### Indigenous Arctic Council participation has no policy influence.

<https://doi.org/10.4324/9781003371885-11> \[AY\]

The significant yet complex role of Indigenous participation in the
Arctic Council's work has played a role in the evolution of the
capability of the international law to conceptualize Indigenous Peoples
as norm-makers.61 [Although Indigenous organizations and Permanent
Participants may have political clout within the Council, this **has
not** necessarily **translated into** normative **power to shape
regional governance**]{.underline}. Of course, this is not to say
participation is not important. It does have its place in
policymaking.62 However, it is only one piece of the puzzle to achieve
decolonial justice.

[Despite suggestions that the Council's working groups provide a
normative space for shaping Arctic governance via knowledge pro-duction,
establishing a direct link between Indigenous **rights** and **agency**
remains challenging]{.underline}. Notably, the work of specific groups
like CAFF and SDWG has integrated a rights-based approach into the
sustainable development discourse, linking human rights implementation
to broader governance themes such as conservation, food security, and
health. [While the Council's guidelines and non-binding documents
reflect the contributions of working groups, these outputs typically
focus on sharing **best practices** rather than enforcing **actionable
changes**]{.underline}. As a result, the involvement of Indigenous
Peoples in the Arctic Council's scientific pro-duction underscores a
commitment to participatory rights, aligning with UNDRIP's principles
for Indigenous participation in decision-making processes. However, [the
translation of this participatory engagement into tangible policy
influence within the Arctic governance structure is less
evident]{.underline}.

### AT: Benefit-Sharing=Good

3 \| THE STORIFICATION OF ICE IN ARCTIC GEOPOLITICS

In our reading of the Arctic, we argue that contemporary
[[Arctic]{.mark} geopolitical [discourse too often pivots around
**simple causalities** such as]{.mark} less sea ice equates to growth in
maritime traffic and possible [geopolitical tension]{.mark}]{.underline}
(for a critical review, Depledge, 2019). This in turn invites a phalanx
of technical-scientific experts to qualify claims about the
preponderance of open water or dampen down expectations that the Arctic
will inevitably be a global maritime highway. [[These are]{.mark}
particular and familiar [**colonial moves** towards **possessing** the
Arctic. The relationship]{.mark} between colonialism and northern
territories, including water, [is **not straightforward** given that
many]{.mark} of those [lands]{.mark} incorporated into colonial-nation
states such as Canada, the United States and Russia that
[utilised]{.mark} **[varying projects]{.mark}**, tactics and techniques
to dispossess Indigenous peoples of their lands, lifeways and
livelihoods]{.underline} (Kollin, 2001; Ruiz et al., 2019). What is
often understood as [[a settler impulse]{.mark} to eliminate to replace
by way of genocidal warfare [is **not neatly projected** onto]{.mark}
landscapes of [the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially in thinking
of the particularly situated (ongoing) colonial histories in Alaska and
Canada. The enactment of allotment, and terra-forming forest and plain
into agriculture including ranching, though attempted, was not
successfully replicated further north. [The early needs for [resource
extraction]{.mark} as animating the core principle of
settler-racial-capitalism [was **not easily met** by]{.mark} virtue of
the presence of [**ice and glacier fields** of Arctic
landscapes]{.mark}]{.underline}. Colonial movements and travels in
search of the Northwest/east Passage of the white nationalist race to
the illusive North Pole were temporary and fleeting---apart from later
public policy directed towards the encouragement and support of
homesteaders and gold miners to populate northern spaces, colonial
actors in the North often did not come to stay. Elemental substances
such as frozen earth, sea ice and glaciers were surveyed, mapped and
manipulated, with colonial agents seeking to thaw out permafrost and
restructure parts of the Arctic landscape in terms of agriculture. [[The
needs of colonial desires]{.mark} to cultivate particular foods in
particular ways that aligned with property making through labour and
land [were **thwarted by ice** and its liminal shapes of constituting
land not water]{.mark}]{.underline} (Smith, 2021).

### AT: Debate/Reps/Etc Don't Spill Over

#### The Arctic is a relationship between [practice]{.underline}, [territory]{.underline}, and [knowledge]{.underline} that constitute one other and [inform policy]{.underline}. Scalar distinctions of the [local/global]{.underline} are irrelevant because macro-politics are [always informed by]{.underline} micropolitics.

Circumpolar Security Studies; March 11, 2025;
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/relating-planetary-arctic-more-than-human-considerations/\]
// SaMi🦋

The notion of the Planetary Arctic, as I wish to define it here, is
predicated on an ontological position (i.e. the position one adopts on
the "nature" of reality), that [the Arctic is **not a pre-defined
region** "out there" in which things happen.]{.underline} Rather, [[the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, that is, what we understand the Arctic to
be, [[is]{.mark} **always [incorporated]{.mark}** [in the things we
do]{.mark} "out there"]{.underline} in the physical world. In other
words, [the Arctic is **coextensive** with the practices that enact
it]{.underline}. This means that [the [practices]{.mark} that have
enacted and enact the Arctic as a region of **exploration**,
**geopolitical rivalry**, **multilateral cooperation**, and as a
"**changing**" or "**global**" region [are]{.mark} all **[materially
embedded]{.mark}**, and there are **distinctive geographies** to the
different practices that are **not constrained** by any pre-set regional
boundaries]{.underline}. Importantly, it is [through **the materiality
of the practices** through which the Arctic region is done that matter
itself expresses its vibrancy.]{.underline} To get this point, one only
needs to consider how, [[for example,]{.mark} [ice]{.mark}
can]{.underline}---through its movement, melting, or relative
fixity---[[**impede** or **make possible**]{.mark} the practices
of scientific [exploration]{.mark}, natural resource [extraction,
and military operations that]{.mark} all [enact the Arctic]{.mark}
region [in distinct ways]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Through this
point of view, the notion of [socio-material [relationality
directs]{.mark} the attention toward different(ly) situated
[**micro-contexts**]{.mark} in and [through which the Arctic is
done]{.mark}, and through which human practices relate to the
"more-than-human" world.]{.underline}

Concurrently, while foregrounding these micro-contexts, the notion of
socio-material relationality also suggests that [it is [through]{.mark}
these [contexts]{.mark}, and the relations that form them, that [our
practices]{.mark}]{.underline} (such as Arctic extractivism) [become
**[connect]{.mark}ed [to]{.mark} planetary processes** like [**climate
change** or **global capitalism**]{.mark}.]{.underline} This implies
that [[it is futile to make scalar distinctions between macro and
micro]{.mark} processes, or the global and the local, [since]{.mark}, in
practice, [macro]{.mark}/global [is]{.mark} always [**constituted
through** micro]{.mark}/local.]{.underline} From this perspective the
Planetary Arctic therefore offers a unique vantage point to the
political history and present of the Arctic: [[the]{.mark} political
history of the [Arctic is]{.mark} a history of [the]{.mark}
[practices]{.mark} through [which **different ways of
understanding**]{.mark}/knowing the region become **[enmesh]{.mark}ed
[in]{.mark} various constellations** of [socio-material relations
that]{.mark} are parts of, and therefore **[constitute]{.mark}**,
planetary [phenomena and processes]{.mark}.]{.underline} This underlines
that if we are to focus on Arctic politics from a more-than-human
perspective and attempt to steer clear of adopting the Arctic region as
a ready-made "geographical context" in which we analyse such Arctic
politics, the interface between Arctic knowledge and practices from a
material-relational perspective offers a fruitful starting point.
Concurrently, by adopting this position, [various [Arctic]{.mark}
practitioners from **[scientists]{.mark} to [policymakers]{.mark}**,
**military [strategists]{.mark}**, [**investors**, and
**entrepreneurs**]{.mark} can start to [consider how]{.mark} their
[practices become]{.mark} **articulated as [constitutive parts]{.mark}**
[of the]{.mark} ever-evolving Planetary [Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### AT: Democratic Peace

#### Data for Democratic Peace theory ignores colonial wars that are fought by Herrenvolk democracies 

Hilde **Ravlo** quoting Christine Dunn **Henderson** et al, 20**03**
"Colonial War and the Democratic Peace." The Journal of Conflict
Resolution, vol. 47, no. 4, 2003, pp. 520--48. JSTOR,
http://www.jstor.org/stable/3176207. (Ravlo - Research at Vanderbilt
University quoting Henderson - Singapore Management University, School
of Social Sciences, Faculty Member) II Norah

[[Henderson]{.mark} (2002, 82-83), who [regards]{.mark} the
[d]{.mark}emocratic [p]{.mark}eace [as]{.mark} an illusion, finds that
the founding fathers of the democratic peace, such as Immanuel Kant and
Woodrow Wilson, held racist views and advocated a "[Herrenvolk]{.mark}
[democracy]{.mark}." He notes that the [battle deaths]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} the [extra systemic actors]{.mark} [are]{.mark} [not]{.mark}
[included]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the Correlates of War ([COW]{.mark})
[data]{.mark} and attributes this to ideological [bias]{.mark} in the
[recording]{.mark} [of]{.mark} [history]{.mark} and compilation of
government records. In a singularly vitriolic attack on democratic peace
theory, Haas (1995) argues that it is precisely democracies that have
made colonial conquests and fought wars to prevent the liberation of the
colonies. [Excluding]{.mark} [colonial]{.mark} [war]{.mark} from the
study of the democratic peace [excludes]{.mark} some of the
[bloodiest]{.mark} [wars]{.mark} [fought]{.mark} [by]{.mark}
[democracies]{.mark} (Haas 1995, 7). Preferring to deal only with
"coherent," "mature," and "[stable]{.mark}" [democracies]{.mark}, when
these varying regimes prevent coherence, maturity, and stability abroad,
is clearly [ethnocentric]{.mark}, an attempt to ask darker-skinned
peoples to go to the back of the bus while serious research is in
progress. (Haas 1995, 14]{.underline})A related criticism raised by
Forsythe (1992), among others, is that [democracies have frequently
intervened covertly against elected governments (such as Iran in 1953 or
Guatemala in 1954). Some of these governments cannot be classified as
mature democracies, and the battle deaths have generally been too few to
classify these conflicts as wars]{.underline}. Forsythe nevertheless
notes that one possible interpretation (argued strongly by Hunt 1987) is
that [such interventions into the affairs of other countries are
motivated by "an informal ideology of US superiority, racism, and
anti-revolution"]{.underline} (p. 393). James and Mitchell (1995, 92),
citing covert action by democracies against countries such [as Iran,
Guatemala, and Chile]{.underline}, argue that relatively weak
democracies that seek changes in structural dependency are likely to be
vulnerable to outside efforts toward destabilization. Hermann and Kegley
(1998) have also speculated about such motives for interventions
undertaken by democracies, and Galtung (1996) has characterized
democracies as arrogant, missionary, and belligerent. Covert action
against other democracies is another reason why Reiter and Stam (2002,
150, 159-62) see the normative explanation for the foreign policy
behavior of democracies as a "caricature." Even writers sympathetic to
the democratic peace have noted the tendency of liberal democracies to
participate in colonial wars. Doyle (1983b, 322), who views liberalism
as a "striking success" in creating a zone of peace among liberal
states, argues that "[[liberalism]{.mark} has been equally striking as a
[failure]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [guiding]{.mark} [foreign]{.mark}
[policy]{.mark} outside the liberal world.]{.underline}" [This failure
is not incidental; the very same characteristics "that promote peace
among liberal societies can exacerbate conflicts between liberal and non
liberal societies" (pp. 324-25). Thus, liberal [ideological]{.mark}
[crusades]{.mark} came to [justify]{.mark} liberal
[imperialism]{.mark}]{.underline}. Gleditsch and Hegre (1997, 297) note
the tendency for democracies to engage in colonial conquest, military
intervention, and proxy war. Weart (1998, 239) concedes the existence of
democratic imperialism. Russett (1993, 34) observes that many
democracies have fought wars to acquire or hold colonies or to retain
control of states formally independent but within the range of their
spheres of influence. Yet, he views this as more of an anomaly.1

### AT: Epistemology Irrelevant

#### The 1AC's [extractivist epistemologies]{.underline} have [material effects]{.underline}.

**Alcoff, 22**---Professor of Philosophy at the City University of New
York (Linda, "Extractivist epistemologies," Tapuya: Latin American
Science, Technology and Society, 5:1, 2127231, dml)

First, as we'll see in the case-studies, [extractivist
projects]{.underline} tend to [assume that values can be identified in
an **objective** and **universal** way]{.underline}.Footnote2 Plural and
[competing conceptualizations]{.underline} of the value of an artifact
or of a river or mountain [**challenge** extractivist
projects]{.underline}; [thus it becomes necessary to **dismiss**
alternative views]{.underline} from other parties. When museum curators
are seen as stewards who protect universal values, it becomes easier to
accept the claim that they are the final arbiters of the value of Native
American artifacts. Archaeologists likewise are often presented as
working with superior epistemic methods, such as objectivity,
traditionally defined, so that their assessments outrank others. Tribal
group claims are often labeled particularistic and subjective, neither
objective nor universal, and thus defeasible (Wylie Citation2002). They
may also be defined as "resistance to science" (Fine-Dare Citation2002,
167). The important point to understand is that [the process by which a
value is defined is an **interpretive practice** for all
parties]{.underline}. Allowing plural approaches to the definition of
value disrupts the hegemony of academically trained experts. Thus
accepting pluralist approaches to value determination will involve
accepting not only a pluralism of metaphysical commitments but also
pluralist approaches to the knowledge processes that identify values
subject to extraction.

Second, [extractivist projects have an interest in defining the value
that is extracted in a **non-relational** way]{.underline}. [This is a
way of **externalizing costs**]{.underline}, as capitalists put it. [The
cost of **cleaning up** what has been made **toxic**]{.underline} in the
process of extraction, [the cost of the effects of extraction on
**infrastructure**]{.underline}, [the cost of **regenerating raw
materials** when that is possible]{.underline}, [**none** of these need
to be addressed when]{.underline} the [value]{.underline} of what is
extracted [can be portrayed as **distinct** and
**non-relational**]{.underline} (see, e.g. Wallerstein Citation2006,
57). Thus the assumption that values can be transported to a new domain
without being diminished assumes a non-relational, decontextualized
conceptualization of values as discrete and independent of their
relations to adjacent entities. Resources that are separated from their
original context are not assumed to lose value in the process of removal
unless they deteriorate in some material way. Further, those values that
may be destroyed (such as arable land or animal habitats) in the process
of extracting other values (such as mineral resources) are not
co-determining or co-constitutive but merely adjacent and do not need to
be factored into the quantification of the value achieved in the
extraction. The belief that the values that have been destroyed in the
process of extraction can be fairly paid for in a one-time payment also
makes assumptions that values can be measured quantitatively and
transformed into monetized elements that can then be calculated as a
fair exchange.

In some cases, a value may not diminish in the process of extraction.
But values can be diminished when, for example, artifacts are removed
from their surroundings in ways that compromise the interpretation of
their meaning, or plants with medicinal properties are separated from
local communal practices that may impact their efficacy. The problem is
when we assume without analysis that a non-relational approach is
adequate to assessing value. Rather, the relevance of context and
relationality should be our initial assumption about the nature of
value.

Thus far I have been discussing the metaphysical approach to the value
of objects,Footnote3 but [extractivists also assume that **epistemic
resources** can be identified]{.underline}, [extracted]{.underline},
[and given a fair market value]{.underline}. [The **key feature** of an
extractivist epistemology]{.underline}, I argue, [is the way in which it
treats this epistemic resource as **separable** from its
origin]{.underline}, without subsequent loss, [rendering it into a
**commodity** with exchange value over which **exclusive rights** can be
contractually defined]{.underline}, [protected]{.underline}, [and
enforced]{.underline}. To be commodified in this way, [knowledge must be
**reduced** to information or data without involving interpretation or
analysis]{.underline}, thus [ensuring an **inevitable epistemic
injustice**]{.underline} (Fricker Citation2007). When we understand
knowledge as always involving interpretation, it becomes more obvious
that dialogic processes are necessary for good epistemic outcomes.

Extractivist epistemologies thus involve certain epistemic assumptions
about justification procedures that follow from their assumptions about
the nature of the epistemic resources they are pursuing. Like
extractivist capitalism, [extractivist epistemologies attempt to extract
epistemic elements from their original surroundings]{.underline} and in
this way from their political, ethical, and institutional context of
articulation. [This makes it possible]{.underline} for knowledge-seeking
institutions or individuals [to **avoid being held accountable** to
the]{.underline} ethical, political, and economic [demands of indigenous
groups or other local communities whose resources are being
extracted]{.underline}; a one-time payment is sufficient to cover all
obligations.

### AT: Essentialism

#### Essentialism claims are [wrong]{.underline}.

**Meghji, 23**---Assistant Professor of Social Inequalities at the
University of Cambridge (Ali, "Dwelling in epistemic disobedience: A
reply to Go," The British Journal of Sociology, Volume 74, Issue 3, June
2023, pp. 294--301, dml)

[Decolonial thought]{.underline}, however, [**does not create an
epistemic hierarchy** on the basis of]{.underline} geographical
**[essentialisms]{.underline}**, [and **neither** does it advocate a
**simple turning to the non-West**]{.underline}. In fact, the project
[decolonial theory]{.underline} embraces---that of border thinking---is
incredibly akin to what Go describes when he refers to how anticolonial
sociology is developed from relational positions "of experience, of
subordination and of erasure".

Border thinking [necessitates that we engage with those epistemologies
that may have been]{.underline} "**[affected]{.underline}** by
genocide/epistemicide [but not **fully destroyed**]{.underline}"
(Grosfoguel, 2013, p. 87). However, [the]{.underline}
"**[borders]{.underline}**" [from where we are thinking are not simply
**geographical** spaces]{.underline} that others may simply refer to as
the Global South or non-West. The border, as outlined by Gloria Anzaldúa
(1987), can certainly be a geographical space, but [it also refers to a
**metaphorical** space of exteriority]{.underline} in the world system.
These border perspectives, importantly, are themselves created as
"border" perspectives in virtue of extant power relations (what the
decolonials would refer to as the colonial matrix of power); [they are
epistemologies that exist]{.underline} on "(the)
**[outside]{.underline}** invented by the rhetoric of
[modernity]{.underline} in the process of creating the inside" (Mignolo,
2007, p. 472). [The border]{.underline}, in this sense, [is not a
physical space inasmuch as a **relational position**]{.underline} in the
colonial world order.

[Within this context of border thinking]{.underline}, importantly,
[decolonial thought **does not reify essentialisms** between the
geographies nor the epistemologies of the North]{.underline} (the
center), [and the South]{.underline} (the border). In fact,
[decoloniality is presented as being a third option that **transcends**
the two options of Western modernity and dewesternization]{.underline}
(Mignolo, 2011). [Dewesternization]{.underline}, it is argued, [is **not
on its own sufficient** to delink from the colonial matrix of
power]{.underline}. This is precisely the point Mignolo (2011), for
instance, makes against the decolonization movements of the mid-20th
century: they may have advocated for a dewesternization of culture,
politics, and economy, but they did not necessarily detach themselves
from the coloniality of knowledge and power, as seen in the cases of the
Soviet empire, China, and India. In other words, [within decolonial
thought there is a **suspicion** of socio-political movements which
argue that because something is based in the Global South it is
**inherently superior** to the West]{.underline}, [and that any
knowledge system that exists in the Global South is **inherently
anti-colonial**]{.underline}. Instead, [there is a **recognition** that
this]{.underline} West/non-West [binary **occludes**
how]{.underline}---as Satnam Virdee (2019, p. 6) puts it---[there has
always been]{.underline} "an East within the West and a South within the
North" (and indeed, [a **West** in the **East** and **North** in the
**South**]{.underline}).

The border thinking which decolonial theory advocates, therefore, seems
very similar to what Go describes at the end of his paper when he claims
that "the space of the anticolonial does not mark an essential position
of geography (or race, for that matter) but a relational position of
experience, of subordination and of erasure". [Rather than embracing an
**essentialist**]{.underline} West/non-West
**[binary]{.underline}**---what Go refers to as a geo-epistemic
essentialism---[decolonial theory merely analyses the **geopolitics of
knowledge**]{.underline}. Just like Go\'s argument, [decolonial thought
holds that all knowledge is enunciated from **particular positions** in
the colonial world order]{.underline}. Within this colonial world order,
the positions from which we find more critical theorizing are those
border perspectives---those relational position in the world system,
much like what Go describes.

### AT: Extractivism=Vague

#### Extractivism is a [useful lens]{.underline} for understanding historical and modern practices of plunder---and, theorizing it through a lens of colonialism [avoids]{.underline} their critiques.

**Dunlap, 24**---visiting research fellow at the University of Helsinki
(Alexander, "The Structures of Conquest: Debating Extractivism(s),
Infrastructures and Environmental Justice for Advancing Post-development
Pathways," *The Afterlives of Extraction: Alternatives and Sustainable
Futures*, Chapter 3, pp. 65-66, dml)

[Definitions of]{.underline} renewability and [extractivism are
**established**]{.underline} above, [but the question
persists]{.underline}: [How can industrial capitalist operations **not**
be extractivism?]{.underline} Based on institutional structure and
development priority, academics--- and [people]{.underline}
generally---[have become **accustomed** to and **enamoured** by the
products of extractivism]{.underline}. This
normalised---everyday---infrastructural reality of roads, individualized
automobility, utilitarian architecture, pipes and power lines, to name a
few, have consumed people wilfully, begrudgingly or somewhere in between
and beyond. Remembering how Walter Rostow weaponized capitalist
consumerism to win the Cold War (Cullather, 2013, 161), [we might
understand convenience and entertainment as capitalist]{.underline}
'**[weapons of mass destruction]{.underline}**' [against the
**planet**]{.underline}. [Modernist infrastructural regimes allow us to
**ignore**]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} even to
**[forget]{.underline}**, [how we accommodate capitalism]{.underline},
industrialisation and our (forced or voluntary) servitude to the
development of computational technologies. As the Mining Association of
Canada (mac, 2021) exclaims: 'Before it's yours, its mined'.7 Thus,
[this]{.underline} bounded [definition of extractivism]{.underline}, put
forward by Gudynas (2021) and many others (Mckay, 2020; Ye et al.,
2020), [is accused of **ignoring** the complex financial and material
supply webs]{.underline} of monocultures, research labs, schools,
hospitals, police, prisons and all the rest [that depends on
**plundering** habitats for either materials or energy
production]{.underline} (Dunlap, 2021b). In order [for]{.underline}
agro-[extractivism to be **possible**]{.underline} in the first place,
[there needs to be an **entire**]{.underline} political-economic
**[regime]{.underline}**---the structure of conquest---[in place to
create the **means**]{.underline}, [**scale** and **intensity** that
allows]{.underline} agro-[extractivism]{.underline}: chemical
factories---extracting, dividing and synthesising nature---to produce
pesticides and/or fertilisers; the scientific expertise and laboratories
to research, develop and create genetically modified organisms (gmo s);
and, now, the existing supply webs behind the application of digital
technologies in agriculture, which 'appropriate decision-making based on
the flow of data from individual farms and farmers' (Stone, 2022, 3).
While Glenn Stone (2022) refers to this as 'surveillance agriculture',
indicating how agriculture is becoming digitalized, automated and
eroding control from farmers, the purpose here is to emphasises how
extractive processes, or extractivism(s), are connected at various
intensities through production supply webs, violent histories, economic
and financial actors, and/or institutions. Agro-extractivism requires
mining, and more of it as it digitalises and intensifies. The
'innovation economy', Antti Tarvainen (2022, 2) reminds us, depends on,
emerges from, and systematically affirms settler colonialism, meanwhile
refining 'the violence of technocapitalism' and 'data colonialism'. The
relevance of '**[global extractivism]{.underline}**' [as an **organising
concept**]{.underline} (Nygren, Kröger and Gills, 2022; Chagnon et al.,
2022), **[affirms its relevance]{.underline}**, [as
extractivism]{.underline}, [infrastructural colonisation]{.underline},
[and economic forces proliferate]{.underline}, [transcend
borders]{.underline}, [intersect]{.underline}, [and depend on multiple
extractive companies and trajectories]{.underline}.

[Coming to terms with the reality that]{.underline} '**[everything is
extractivism]{.underline}**' [within the dominant development paradigm
is **important** to any effort to **resituate** the present planetary
situation]{.underline}---[and the **action** that should
follow]{.underline}. [This **extractive reality** should also allow
people to resituate how they **conceive** of politics]{.underline},
conflict, political organisation and, consequently, 'justice' the last
of which is discussed in the next section. Academically, if not
practically, [the imperative exists to take the]{.underline}
socio-ecological damage and [harm]{.underline} created by industrial,
bureaucratic and capitalist systems **[seriously]{.underline}**.
Non-humans, the Indigenous, the marginalised, peoples that consume
little materials and energy, moreover, are the least responsible for
this socio-ecological catastrophe (Bolger et al., 2021), which is not to
forget the psychosocial decay and discontent emanating from modernist
affluence of high-income countries and neighborhoods (Lane, 2000;
Alexander, 2008). [**Properly recognising** the scope of this problem is
the **first step**]{.underline}. Technologies and infrastructures,
however, can be appropriated. This appropriation indicates the
importance of taking the 'best' innovations from this global development
process. If socio-ecological transformation is to take place, it will
require serious and committed efforts to redress the violence done by
technocapitalism and to build new types of (post)developmental
infrastructures.

### AT: Fossil Resources=Good For Indigenous People

#### Resource/oil/gas production creates serious environmental harms for indigenous communities, uniquely in the Arctic

[[Oil]{.mark} and gas [development carries]{.mark} both
[ecological]{.mark} and social [risks]{.mark} and hazards [related to
habitat fragmentation]{.mark}; [disruption of migration]{.mark} from
[pipelines, roads, seismic testing]{.mark}, and marine vessel traffic;
[and increased pollution]{.mark} from oil spills]{.underline}. The
Arctic is one of the world's remaining regions that still enjoys vast
areas of undisturbed habitat, which is necessary for many Arctic
animals, particularly those that migrate. [[Caribou are sensitive to
disturbances]{.mark} from development activities and other alterations
of their habitat (Dana et al. 2009). [Marine species have high
vulnerability]{.mark} to oil spill impacts, particularly those whose
seasonal migrations mean that they are on the move in summer months when
drilling takes place (Gulas et al. 2017). Oil [spills represent]{.mark}
a ["low probability, high impact]{.mark}" [risk]{.mark} that carries a
potentially devastating impact on local ecosystems, [and is a]{.mark}
common [source of concern]{.mark} [for]{.mark} coastal
[communities]{.mark} (McDowell and Ford 2014). [Oil]{.mark} disperses
and [degrades]{.mark} very [slowly at cold
temperatures]{.mark}]{.underline} (Byers 2013). Studies have shown that
two decades after the Exxon Valdez oil spill off Alaska's southern
coast, oil from that spill persisted in the ecosystem (Guterman 2009,
cited in Byers 2013). The Exxon Valdez led to a destruction of local
herring and salmon stocks such that there was no herring fishing in the
area for 15 years (Ravna and Svendson 2018). [Oil [spills are difficult
to clean]{.mark} up in the marine environment [even in]{.mark} the
[absence of ice]{.mark}, as illustrated by the fallout from the
Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. The blowout,
which occurred in the absence of a same-season relief well, released an
estimated 3.19 million barrels of crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico. The
cleanup effort released 1.4 million gallons of chemical dispersants,
adding an additional environmental health concern (Ocean Portal n.d.).
Subsequent analyses pointed to [significant gaps in the regulatory
system]{.mark} within the United States, as well as problems with the
safety culture of the oil industry (Osofsky et al. 2013). Given that it
took 89 days to cap the well in the warm and easily accessible Gulf
waters [raised]{.mark} [questions]{.mark} [about]{.mark} the industry's
ability to safely pursue offshore [drilling]{.mark} in the
Arctic.]{.underline}

#### Resource development projects create the "resource curse" of inviting in temporary workers that kill the environment, culture, and economics of indigenous regions.

[In addition to ecological risks, [resource development projects bring
social risks]{.mark} related to demographic and economic changes at the
community and household level. This may include an [influx of
new]{.mark} [workers]{.mark} from the south, who may introduce different
social norms and practices, [or outmigration from smaller communities to
regional centers]{.mark} set up to support industry
practices]{.underline} (Ensign et al. 2014). [Because many [jobs]{.mark}
associated with oil and gas development [require technical
expertise]{.mark}, [only some]{.mark} residents will likely [find
employment, leading to]{.mark} economic [stratification and]{.mark}
growing [inequality]{.mark} within and between northern
communities]{.underline} (Arruda and Krutkowski 2017; Nilsen 2016). [The
increase in temporary workers who are flown in for short periods
combined with the availability of cash from [industry employment]{.mark}
often [increases]{.mark} the rates of [alcohol and drug use]{.mark} in
industry towns. These various changes are referred to as the "[resource
curse]{.mark}]{.underline}" (McCauley et al. 2016). On the other hand,
from a social perspective, extractive resource development can bring
benefits to communities. For example, residents of Hammerfest, Norway,
the nearest city to Norway's large Snøhvit offshore natural gas field,
report primarily positive impacts from industry on their city. These
include a significant increase in jobs, younger people wanting to stay
in the community, new houses and buildings built, and people moving
there because of jobs and staying there (Loe and Kelman 2016). Arctic
Indigenous Peoples and residents whose ties to place span generations
face additional cultural and social risks related to the erosion of
livelihoods based on renewable resource use. [Across the Arctic[,
resistance to]{.mark} oil and gas [activities has]{.mark} often [been
led by Indigenous]{.mark} [communities]{.mark} [based on
concerns]{.mark} for the continuity of hunting, gathering, and herding
activities and the need for a healthy environment to support these
practices. These practices are essential not only for food security and
maintaining healthy local economies but also for cultural identity and a
sense of connection to place. [Risks that threaten these practices
are]{.mark}, therefore, existential risks that are also [viewed as
threats to]{.mark} cultural [resilience]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### AT: Liberalism Good

#### Liberalism's egalitarian foundations are false and the aff can't access them anyway. 

**Sabaratnam and Laffey, 23**---Senior Lecturer in International
Relations at SOAS, University of London; Senior Lecturer in
International Politics Department of Politics and International Studies,
SOAS, University of London (Meera and Mark, "Complex indebtedness:
justice and the crisis of liberal order," International Affairs 99: 1
(2023) 161--180, dml)

First, contrary to its imagined egalitarianism, [[liberalism has]{.mark}
long [played a key role in]{.mark} **defining** and **[legitimating
hierarchies]{.mark}** of the human]{.underline}, [expressed
[through]{.mark}]{.underline} forms of [[**racialization** and
**gendering**]{.underline}, [including in **property
rights**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and **sovereignty**]{.underline}. [The
implication of this differentiation was to structure relations within
and between societies]{.underline} according to the racial qualities of
one's ascribed descent in a profoundly unequal way, and [[in ways which
**denied**]{.mark} **full [humanity]{.mark}** [to the majority of
people]{.mark} in the world]{.underline}, [[**subordinating**
them]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[as property]{.underline}]{.mark} within
the private realm in liberal societies.15 Second, contrary to the social
contract's domestic imaginary, as Barry Hindess has argued, [[liberalism
was **always** about the]{.underline}]{.mark} 'regulation and
[[re-organization of the international sphere]{.underline}',
[about]{.underline}]{.mark} [those [who can be]{.mark}]{.underline}
['[governed]{.underline}]{.mark} [through]{.underline} the promotion of
[**liberty** and those who must be governed in **other
ways**]{.underline}'.16 Thus, relations between those identified as
'liberal' and those identified as 'other' were typically asymmetric in
liberal thought. Relatedly, liberal ideas and doctrines were developed
in important ways in discussion of settler/imperial relations, rather
than being primarily about relations within European societies which
were then projected out into the wider world.17 In this respect, they
were concerned with the relations of political
expansion---justifications for conquest, territorial acquisition,
corporate freedoms and so on, rather than the domestic organization of a
predefined population within agreed boundaries. These conditions of
appropriation are evident, for example, in the Lockean account of
private property.18

[As]{.underline} Charles [**[Mills]{.mark}** has argued]{.underline},
however, [central to]{.underline} the self-presentation of
[this]{.underline} ideational [framework has been]{.underline} what he
calls [an]{.underline} '**[epistemology of
ignorance]{.underline}**'---in our terms, both historic and epistemic
injustice---[which **denies** or [**erases** these inequalities and
forms of violence]{.mark} and exploitation]{.underline}.19 That is to
say that [[the classic]{.underline}]{.mark} social contract [[imaginary
of liberal thought has **systematically erased**]{.underline}]{.mark},
denied or repressed these aspects of [its]{.underline} historical
instantiation, which have the effect of preserving forms of social
privilege by denying or occluding their **[historical
basis]{.underline}**, thus deflecting claims for justice on these lines.

Institutions

[[This misrecognition of liberal ideas is mirrored by a **misrecognition
of**]{.mark} **domestic [institutions]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} liberal
[states]{.mark}]{.underline}, which have usually been [[framed
as]{.underline}]{.mark} located in discrete territories, with national
histories, [[involving]{.underline}]{.mark} political and economic
**[[rights]{.underline}]{.mark}** for citizens, [and **democratic
government** characterized by internal checks and balances]{.underline}.
[[Such perceptions have been **central** to]{.underline}]{.mark}
arguments about how such states relate to others internationally, for
example in [[the]{.mark} **democratic** or **[liberal peace
thesis]{.mark}**]{.underline}.20 Yet [leading [liberal
states]{.mark}]{.underline} including Australia, Belgium, Canada,
France, Israel, Nether- lands, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the
United States [have]{.underline} also [been shown over time [to operate
through]{.mark} relations of [**hierarchy** and
**exclusion**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [including]{.underline}]{.mark}
[practices of [settler colonialism]{.mark}]{.underline}, [land
expropriation]{.underline}, [treaty abrogation]{.underline},
[suppression of the franchise [and]{.mark} systematic racial
[discrimination]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}21 [Rather than
**restraining** such practices]{.underline}, [[liberal j]{.mark}udicial
[institutions have]{.mark} often [upheld **impunity** for]{.mark} state
agencies and **privileged** imperial/[settler-citizens]{.mark} in these
matters]{.underline}, **[[reinforcing]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
constitutive [hierarchical]{.underline} political
[relations]{.underline} within the country [and the forms of
**dispossession** or [**violence**]{.mark} they entail]{.underline}.22
Moreover, [the colonial/imperial constitution of these states has been a
**significant factor** [in enabling]{.mark} forms of [wealth
creation]{.mark}]{.underline}, [land ownership]{.underline}, [welfare
states and social democracy for poorer white citizens]{.underline}.23 To
understand the domestic institutions of liberal states as so
constituted---both domestically and internationally---is also to
question the liberal democratic approach that supposedly informs their
international relations.24

On this point, conventional narratives of the origins and purposes of
[[international institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the relations
they instantiate, have also been challenged. These institutions [[are
**not**]{.underline}]{.mark} seen primarily as functional [[spaces
of]{.mark} reciprocal [cooperation]{.mark} between states that are
equal]{.underline} before international law, [[but]{.underline}]{.mark}
as [[uphold]{.underline}]{.mark}ing various forms of [legalized
hierarchy that bear **identifiable continuities with
empire**]{.underline}. 25 While it is well known that before the
twentieth century [[a **racialized**]{.underline} '**[standard of
civilization]{.underline}**']{.mark} [[governed]{.mark} admission
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[international
society]{.underline}]{.mark} of recog- nized nations,26 newer
scholarship has traced this relational structure well into the twentieth
century and indeed [up to the present day]{.underline}. The scholarship
examining the foundations of key international institutions has shown
that [[the maintenance of imperial]{.mark} and racial [hierarchies was a
**central concern** of the architects of]{.mark}]{.underline} the League
of Nations and [[the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[N]{.underline}]{.mark}**ations,27 for example, who rebuffed
contemporary demands for racial equality and the inclusion of colonized
peoples at their foundation. [[Even]{.mark} with the changes pursued by
Southern governments]{.underline}, [such as the [declarations
for]{.mark} **human rights**]{.underline}, [**racial [equality]{.mark}**
[and **decolonization**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [further
reforms]{.underline} such as the New International Economic Order [which
would have further empowered/resourced formerly colonized peoples [were
**decisively blocked**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 28 In a continuation of
these patterns, [international institutions at the **heart** of [the
LIO]{.mark} have [produced]{.mark}]{.underline} what has been called
'**[[nuclear]{.mark} apartheid]{.underline}**', 29 '**[peacekeeping
apartheid]{.underline}**', 30 [[and]{.underline},]{.mark} most recently
in a COVID-19 context, '[**[vaccine apartheid]{.underline}**']{.mark}.
31 Thus, international institutions that are meant to produce forms of
reciprocal cooperation and a common legal and normative framework work
instead to uphold hierarchies which they say should not exist in an
institutional sense. Nonetheless, their self-presenta- tion continues to
emphasize the mutual benefits of cooperation for all countries through
such institutions.

Interdependence

They are able to do this in part because the primary political and
economic relations of the LIO are purportedly characterized by
'interdependence', in respect of both cause and context. This term,
although initially used in the 1930s, became popular in the 1970s in the
West to describe relations among core capitalist countries following the
post-Second World War revival of Japan and West Germany and the oil
crisis, and to justify further and deeper institutional cooperation in
the protection of mutual interests.
'[**[Interdependence]{.underline}**']{.mark} [has]{.underline}, however,
[become the **key analytical term** through which liberal thought
understands the relational structure of the
international]{.underline}.32 [This concept has been invoked to justify
a greater role for **multinational corporations** as stakeholders in
global governance]{.underline}, for example, [and to create **pressure**
to harmonize]{.underline} fiscal, trade and investment [rules to promote
further integration]{.underline}. 33 Yet, as global South scholars and
public intellectuals have shown, [such]{.underline}
'[integration]{.underline}' [has]{.underline} also [served to
**[deepen]{.mark}** the [**extractive dynamics** of]{.mark} the world
capitalist economy]{.underline}, [based on **highly [unequal]{.mark}**
[terms of trade]{.mark}]{.underline}, [the exploitation of
labour]{.underline}, [commodity extraction and attendant environmental
degradation]{.underline}, [capital flight and so on]{.underline}.34 Ben
Selwyn has argued, for example, that the [[**empirical evidence**
suggests]{.mark} that global commodity chains are better understood
as]{.underline} '[**[global poverty chains]{.underline}**']{.mark}.35
Recent economic analysis has suggested that [the value
drain]{.underline} from global South to global North economies [enabled
by these linkages has totalled **US\$152 trillion**]{.underline} since
1960. 36 To the extent that [interdependence]{.underline} has been
promoted through LIO institutions, such cooperation often
[serves]{.underline} more narrowly [to [protect systems
of]{.mark}]{.underline} e.g. **[[quasi-imperial
preference]{.underline}]{.mark}**, monopsony, intel- lectual property
and corporate assets [[rather than genuinely]{.mark} to [open up
the]{.mark} world [economy]{.mark}]{.underline}.37 These critiques of
interdependence thinking echo those made about liberal ideas and
institutions; that while self-presenting as universally applicable,
progressive and mutually advantageous, viewed from the South they are
central to the maintenance of hierarchies, patterns of exploitation and
the denial of political, economic and social rights.

### AT: Material Change Key/Theory Fails

#### Theory [is material]{.underline} and pretending it isn't [enables]{.underline} colonial violence.

**Fúnez-Flores, 24**---Assistant Professor of Curriculum Studies and
Teacher Education in the Department of Curriculum and Instruction at
Texas Tech University (Jairo, "Anibal Quijano: (Dis)entangling the
geopolitics and coloniality of curriculum," The Curriculum Journal,
Volume 35, Issue 2, June 2024, pp. 288-306, dml)

[The power of concepts **cannot be underestimated** insofar as they
simultaneously enable us to **interrogate** the world and **take
action** to unsettle colonial]{.underline}, racist, capitalist and
heteropatriarchal [structures]{.underline}. [Theories and concepts can
either serve as **behaviour-regulating discursive systems**]{.underline}
(Wynter, 2003) [that **maintain** the]{.underline} modern/[colonial
order]{.underline} of things [or they can serve as **catalysts for
collective action** seeking to dismantle said order]{.underline}. [When
concepts are **imposed** on others]{.underline}, however, [they have the
pedagogical ability to **distort** the understanding of social
reality]{.underline}; [**justify** material dispossession]{.underline},
[domination and exploitation]{.underline}; [and **prevent** collective
action]{.underline}. When concepts emerge within sites of struggle, they
find their theoretical validity in their praxis orientation towards
radical social transformation. González Casanova (1987) claims that [it
is **impossible** to wage a collective struggle]{.underline} without
concepts, that is, [without **conceptual tools** to read]{.underline},
[interrogate and comprehend the world in which our actions
unfold]{.underline}. Take, for instance, [decolonial theories and
their]{.underline} concomitant [concepts]{.underline}, which are not
problematic in and of themselves, as some critics like to claim, but
[are]{.underline} rather [**problematic** when]{.underline} concepts are
[**abstracted** from the material contexts from which they
emerge]{.underline}. In other words, [when the symbolic]{.underline}
(cultural) [is underscored over the material]{.underline}
(political--economic) [and when both are understood as **ontologically
separate** domains]{.underline}, [this tends to **obfuscate** how they
are **entangled** in everyday practices]{.underline}.

### AT: Perm---Cap Links

#### Indigeneity and capital accumulation are [mutually exclusive]{.underline}.

**Simpson '17**, (Leanne Betasamosake. "As We Have Always Done:
Indigenous Freedom through Radical Resistance", *University of Minnesota
Press*, 2017, Accessed via University of Michigan Library System, DOA:

[My [Ancestors didn't accumulate]{.mark} [capital]{.mark}, [they
accumulated]{.mark} networks of meaningful, deep, fluid,
[intimate]{.mark} collective and individual relationships of
[trust]{.mark}]{.underline}. In times of hardship, we did not rely to
any great degree on accumulated capital or individualism but on the
strength of our relationships with others. The Michi Saagiig oral
tradition has within it stories of Wendat and Rotinonhseshá:ka
/Haudenosaunee coming to us and asking to hunt or farm in our territory
during times of famine. [Our grounded normativity compelled us to
[assist our neighbors if]{.mark} we were [able]{.mark}. [We]{.mark} also
[have]{.mark} a series of [embedded practices that redistribute wealth
within]{.mark} the community.]{.underline} Harvests are distributed in
community to our most vulnerable members---those who cannot harvest for
themselves. Many of our ceremonial practices include a giveaway
component where goods are distributed among participants. [Gift giving
is part of our diplomacy and designed to reinforce and nurture
relationships. In daily life, greed, or the accumulation of capital, was
seen as an assault against the collective because it offended the
spirits of the plant and animal nations that made up our peopled cosmos,
and therefore put Nishnaabeg at risk. "[Capital]{.mark}" in our reality
[isn't capital]{.mark}.]{.underline} We have no such thing as capital.
We have relatives. We have clans. We have treaty partners. We do not
have resources or capital. [Resources and capital, [in fact]{.mark}, are
[fundamental mistakes]{.mark} within Nishnaabeg thought,]{.underline} as
Glenna Beaucage points out, and ones that come with serious
consequences---[not in a colonial superstitious way but in the way we
have already seen: the collapse of local ecosystems, the loss of
prairies and wild rice, the loss of salmon, eels, caribou, the loss of
our weather.]{.underline} Another mistake is [the idea of
[excess]{.mark}]{.underline}. There are lots of Nishnaabeg stories about
the problems with excess. Recall the Deer clan story in chapter 4. When
the Nishnaabeg killed an excess of deer, the deer left the territory, to
the point where today we have an abundance of deer in my territory but
very few Deer clan people, [and this [reminds us of]{.mark} that
[imbalance]{.mark}]{.underline}. Medicine people often look for excess
and imbalance in a person's life when they look for and treat root
causes of illness and disease. Going back, even one generation in my
family, I see a way of life that was careful, frugal, full of making and
self-sufficiency, and one that frowned upon waste, surplus, and
overindulgence. Older members of our communities will often comment on
this, particularly with regards to my generation and our children and
the sea of things they are growing up in. It concerns them. It worries
them. They see it as a problem with the way we are living. On one hand,
for Michi Saagiig Nishnaabeg living Nishnaabewin, [[material
wealth]{.mark} simply [didn't make sense]{.mark}, because we never
settled in one place. We were constantly moving throughout our territory
in a deliberate way, carrying and making our belongings as we
went]{.underline}. Having a lot of stuff made life more difficult on a
practical level. On an ethical level, it was an indication of imbalance
within the larger system of life. [[When]{.mark} Nishnaabeg are
[historicized by settler colonial thought as "less]{.mark}
technologically [developed]{.mark}," there is [an assumption]{.mark}
that [we weren't capitalists because we couldn't]{.mark} be---we didn't
have the wisdom or the technology to accumulate capital, until the
Europeans arrived and the fur trade happened. This is
[incorrect]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[We]{.mark} certainly [had]{.mark}
[the tech]{.mark}nology [and]{.mark} the [wisdom]{.mark} to develop this
kind of economy, [or]{.mark} rather [we had the ethics]{.mark} and
knowledge [within]{.mark} [grounded]{.mark} [normativity to not]{.mark}
develop this system, because to do so would have violated our
fundamental values and ethics regarding how we relate to each other and
the natural world]{.underline}. We chose not to, repeatedly, over our
history.

Tanganekald and Meintangk (Australia) scholar Irene Watson concurred:

The [experience lived before the time of Cook was more than the idea of
sovereignty; it was freedom from the 'muldarbi' or demon spirit. I use
muldarbi here to describe the colonizer, and all forms of exploitation
and power that are dispossessing and destructive of indigenous
peoples]{.underline}. (Watson 2002, paragraph 18, single quotes in
original)

She explained that 'Aboriginal' law is not formalised in legal text but
lived through customs, believes, values, and everyday practices. This
law is incompatible with the notions of sovereignty and land title
promoted by the Australian state. [Imposing the Westphalian concept of
sovereignty onto Indigenous peoples facilitates 'the **continuing
colonial relationship** between colonizing states and indigenous
peoples']{.underline} (Watson 2002, paragraph 44). This idea was echoed
by Sharma and Wright (2008) who asserted that [decolonisation must
reject exploitative and colonialist relations and systems of authority
'organized through the national state, such as sovereignty']{.underline}
(132).

An important question is how the concept of Indigenous sovereignty
differs from Westphalian sovereignty, which has been an instrument of
settler colonialism. To address this question, we uncovered various
perspectives of Indigenous sovereignty occurring in the literature:

First, Vine Deloria, Jr. explained in a US context that [Indigenous
perspectives **reframe** sovereignty in a way that focusses on social
and cultural rather than legal dimensions]{.underline}:

the idea of Indian sovereignty is not simply a legal concept. Numerous
[references to sovereignty cite the nation of a distinct people,
separate from others, as the chief characteristic of Indian sovereignty
indicating that so long as the cultural identity of Indians remains
intact no specific political act undertaken by the United States can
permanently extinguish Indian peoples as sovereign entities]{.underline}
(Deloria 1996, 111).

[Indigenous sovereignty is thus not purely a legal source of political
authority, but rather a social and cultural way of defining community.
The Inuit who live in the Arctic]{.underline} across the international
boundaries of the United States (Alaska), Canada, Greenland, and Russia
[have fought for control over the arctic waters]{.underline}, which are
sought after as shipping routes and sources of untapped natural
resources. [For the Inuit hunting seal is a critical aspect of their
cultural self-understanding, thus they feel responsible for the proper
stewardship of the water. Such stewardship is an **expression of
'sovereign power** across the multiple borders that constitute the
Arctic']{.underline} (Fakhri 2018, 233).

[The Inuit's struggle over sovereignty in the Arctic, however, also
illustrates the **ongoing colonialism** facilitated by elevating
Westphalian over Indigenous conceptions of sovereignty]{.underline}. On
the one hand, the Inuit have had some success with land claims in
Canada, some of which include provisions about political autonomy
(Campbell 2013). Additionally, along with Canada, Denmark, Finland,
Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States, there are six
Indigenous peoples' organisations (Inuit Circumpolar Conference, Aleut
International Association, Arctic Athabaskan Council, Gwich'in Council
International, Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North,
and Saami Council) considered 'permanent participants' in the Arctic
Council, which discusses issues of sovereignty and policy in the Arctic.
On the other hand, [after Russia's attempt to claim ownership of the
Arctic in 2007, Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia and the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [held a summit, without
inviting Indigenous communities]{.underline} (Fakhri 2018; Shadian
2018). [The summit and its final declaration asserted the participating
states' territorial sovereignties over the Arctic and '**enveloped
indigenous livelihood** into each state's domestic sphere']{.underline}
(Fakhri 2018, 236). Once again, the [legal claims of Westphalian states
over their territories sidelined Indigenous perspectives of
sovereignty]{.underline}.

### AT: Totalizing Western Thought/'The West'=Bad

#### No link! Terms like 'Western' and 'the West' are [shorthand]{.underline}, not [complete theories]{.underline}.

**Clavé-Mercier and Wuth, 24**---Postdoctoral Researcher at the
Complutense Institute for International Studies (ICEI) at the
Universidad Complutense de Madrid; Postdoctoral Researcher at the
University of Hamburg (Vaclav and Marie, "At the Crossroads of
Coloniality, Power, and Knowledge: It Is Time to Decolonise Political
Concepts," *Decolonising Political Concepts*, Introduction, pp. 10-11,
dml)

Finally, our use of labels such as 'West' or 'Western' throughout the
volume warrants a final introductory consideration. First of all,
'Western political thought' is here understood as a "body of political,
legal and social theory developed by European, American, Australian and
New Zealand authors and practitioners from the beginning of the modern
period in Europe to the pres- ent" (Ivison et al., 2000: 2). [While it
seems **undeniable** that Western]{.underline} political [thought has
been dominated by]{.underline} some form or variation of modern
[liberalism]{.underline} for some centuries now, [it is]{.underline}
however a [**varied** and **contested**]{.underline} body. [Neither is
it **diametrically opposed** to non-Western forms of
thought]{.underline}. [The development of both Western and non-Western
political thought has **rarely**]{.underline} -- [if
**ever**]{.underline} -- [been **hermetically sealed**]{.underline}
processes, especially in contexts where colonisation processes led (or
forced) to mutual influence. [The aim]{.underline} of this volume [is
**definitely not** to **condemn** theories and authors that can be
considered]{.underline} '**[Western]{.underline}**', [but to
**critically question** them and to **profitably introduce** them into
decolonisation debates]{.underline}. Some of our contributors' chapters
actually advance a decolonisation of political concepts through
discussions of theories and scholars that shaped the so-called 'Western'
canon. In doing so, the contributions draw on different theoretical
strands emerging from/within it, such as French Theory, the Frank- furt
School or US-American Critical Race scholarship. In their discussion, it
is shown that the [particular theoretical frameworks developed by
Western authors may also provide **productive** and **emancipatory**
answers to the prevailing power structures]{.underline}. Thus, [Western
political thought should not be treated as a **homogeneous
corpus**]{.underline}.

[The same occurs with the]{.underline} '**[West]{.underline}**'.
Throughout this introduction and this collection, [our use of such a
label does not stand for a **particular geographical place** or a
**specific site of knowledge production**]{.underline}. Instead, [it
encapsulates a set of particular ontologies]{.underline},
[epistemologies]{.underline}, [worldviews]{.underline}, [and
subjectivities that are deeply intertwined with]{.underline}
modernity/[coloniality]{.underline}. [The ideological West can thus be
challenged from **inside** the geographical West or instead be
predominant and defended **outside** of it]{.underline}. Borrowing from
Yarimar Bonilla, [the West is a **project**]{.underline}, [not a
**place**]{.underline} (2017: 334). A project in that it pursues the
actualisation of a particular mode of being, of knowing, of deciding, of
living collectively, etc. But also a project in the sense that it has
never been totally and purely realised, it remains an aspiration. Much
of this continued incompleteness rises from its constitutive relation
with what would be the non-West, and from the continued existence of
alternative modes of existence to those of the West. Indeed, as Hesse
points out, "we should \[...\] consider the West as always already
creolized by virtue of its modernity and coloniality" (2011: 41).
However, '**[West]{.underline}**' [and]{.underline}
'**[non-West]{.underline}**' [are still **useful**]{.underline}
"[**short-hand** for constellations of sources]{.underline},
[issues]{.underline}, [and methods of argumentation that]{.underline}
\[...\] [produce]{.underline} family resemblances and [recognizable
attributes]{.underline}" [and thus]{.underline} "**[cannot be dispensed
with]{.underline}**, [since they]{.underline} are forms of
representation embedded in mythologies that [**anchor** our
understandings]{.underline}" (Gordon, 2014: 205). They are nonetheless
terminologies to be adopted critically. The very least, as we did here,
is to maintain an explicit acknowledgement of their intrinsic
limitations, the main one being their obfuscation of the often
intertwined constitution of what falls under these denominations.

### AT: Utilitarianism

#### Utilitarian calculations are [unethical]{.underline} and justify [existentially genocidal violence]{.underline}.

**Oliver, 23**---Department of Philosophy, Vanderbilt University (Kelly,
"The Limits and Dangers of Risk-Benefit Analysis: From the Refugee
Crisis to the Coronavirus Pandemic," *The Vulnerability of the Human
World: Well-being, Health, Technology and the Environment*, Chapter 2,
pp. 13--27, SpringerLink, dml)

In Carceral Humanitarianism (2017), I argue against
[[util]{.mark}itarian risk-benefit [calculations]{.mark}]{.underline} as
a principle of ethics. There, I argue that the utilitarian calculus used
by both humanitarian aid organizations and so-called humanitarian
military operations (with its surgical strikes and statistical
modelling) [**reduces** human life to **statistical calculations** of
risk or benefit]{.underline}---and **[not]{.underline}** just risk or
benefit [in the **absolute**]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} rather risk
or benefit as defined by the organization or government doing the
calculations. Risks and benefits are [**always** defined with certain
goals in mind]{.underline}. [They [are **never**]{.mark} without
context]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} therefore [purely]{.underline}
"**[[objective]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [or **free** from]{.underline}
politics or **[bias]{.underline}**. Thus, any utilitarian calculus
assumes some good or goal beyond calculation such as pain or pleasure,
suffering or quality of life. [Even **survival**]{.underline}---life and
death---[are valued relative to particular goals that **defy** the
calculations of risk-benefit analysis]{.underline}. In other words,
employing risk-benefit and utilitarian calculations, requires making
assumptions about end goals and values that defy those very
calculations. It is not just that [there are **always** factors beyond
our control and variables we **do not know**]{.underline}, as the deadly
coronavirus makes painfully clear, but also that risk-benefit and
[[util]{.mark}itarian calculations [do not operate in a **vacuum**
but]{.mark} **[necessarily]{.mark}** make [assum]{.mark}ptions about
[the good]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In the West, risk-benefit analysis or [[util]{.mark}itarian calculative
reasoning]{.underline} has become the dominant mode of addressing social
issues, economic issues, and health issues. For example, Doctors without
Borders uses complex risk-benefit computer modeling to set policies
about where to send medical aid (Neuman, 2016).Footnote 9 And too many
hospitals dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic have had to resort to
triage medicine that uses risk-benefit analysis to distribute scarce
resources such as ICU beds, oxygen, and ventilators.

This type of calculative reasoning, however, [[treats]{.mark} human
[life as **fungible** and **exchangeable**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} thereby [makes acceptable]{.underline} so-called
[**collateral damage** and **death**]{.underline}. The way risk-benefit
analysis is used to calculate acceptable collateral damage in warfare is
a prime example of the costs of calculable reason, where utilitarian
arguments are used to justify acceptable levels of killing and death.
[The calculating machine at the heart of utilitarian risk-benefit
analysis is **dangerous** when it makes individual lives fungible and
exchangeable]{.underline}. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} approach [**does
not** and [**cannot** address the **singularity** of each living
being]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Both humanitarian aid and "humanitarian" warfare operate according to
logics of calculation. In fact, humanitarian warfare and humanitarian
aid operate in tandem. In a sense, nation states create refugees by
limiting citizenship, and then pay humanitarian aid organizations to
take care of them. National sovereignty and its concomitant notion of
citizenship are dependent upon so-called neutral humanitarian space,
which occupies an ambiguous space on the outskirts, and borders of, host
countries. Refugees are detained in camps and detention centers at the
borders in supposedly neutral humanitarian space free from politics and
war. Yet, this neutral humanitarian space, often guarded by state police
and military, is far from independent of state sovereignty.

To the contrary, humanitarian space is coopted to maintain national
sovereignty against the so-called threat of migrants, asylum seekers,
and refugees. In other words, within carceral humanitarianism, refugees
operate as both a threat to national sovereignty, and the justification
for shoring up borders.

The fact that the United States and the European Union pay other
countries to keep refugees from crossing into their borders makes clear
that the lives of these people can be bought and sold like so much cargo
to be held in port or lost at sea. For example, the recent crisis in
Belarus at the Polish border, where, according to migrants and refugees
are being used as political pawns. According to the New York Times:
"Europe has long paid other nations to keep refugees away from its
borders... This gives countries on the European periphery the leverage,
and incentive, to use those refugees as pawns" (see Fisher,
2021).Footnote 10

Policies that treat refugees as collateral damage or units of exchange,
where some lives are more valuable than others as calculated through
risk-benefit analysis, renders the lives of refugees fungible, and
therefore, ultimately, disposable.

Statistical models that compute [comparative valuations set out a
**hierarchy** of life]{.underline}, human and otherwise, [through which
violence is **justified**]{.underline}, [and some lives are
**valuable**]{.underline} (in this case, citizens), [while others are
**disposable**]{.underline} (in this case, refugees). Yet, [in **any**
risk-benefit or utilitarian calculation]{.underline}, [[there is
**always** a remainder that **cannot be
calculated**]{.underline}]{.mark}---not just in the arithmetic sense,
but also [a remainder beyond calculation and beyond
recognition]{.underline}.

[There is always [something we **don't know** that is]{.mark}
**necessarily [left out]{.mark}** of any calculation]{.underline}. [We
are **not masters** of the world and therefore there are always factors
**beyond** our knowledge and control]{.underline}. In addition, there
are elements beyond our comprehension. [It is **not**]{.underline},
then, [just a matter of **gathering all the relevant
data**]{.underline}, and that fact that we always fall short. [There are
elements that affect our calculations that we **aren't even aware
of**]{.underline}, [that we **can never know**]{.underline}. [There will
always be something **outside our comprehension affecting our
calculations**]{.underline}. Furthermore, [human
experience]{.underline}, and the experience of life itself, [**cannot be
reduced** to calculations or exchangeable units]{.underline}. [There is
always something about life that **transcends** even the most
sophisticated mathematical calculations]{.underline}. We might call this
the remainder left over when we attempt to translate ethics into
politics or the singular into the universal. There is always something
about the singularity of each living being that cannot be reduced to any
system of exchange value.

2.3 Justice Between Ethics and Politics

Justice requires continually renegotiating the relationship between
ethics and politics, singular and universal, precisely because there is
always something in excess, something beyond recognition.
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} remainder [[is the **ethical imperative**
that]{.mark} should **keep us awake at night**]{.underline}. [[Rather
than]{.mark} lead to **inquietude** or **[apathy]{.mark}**]{.underline},
the excess beyond our [recognition [keeps us]{.mark} **actively
[searching]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} better ways to approach
[justice]{.mark} **[without]{.mark}** resting on]{.underline} moral
rules or [[risk-benefit calculations]{.underline}]{.mark} or
self-righteous principles. [The remainder]{.underline} beyond
calculation, beyond recognition, [[demands that we]{.mark} continue to
**[question]{.mark}** our]{.underline} own principles and
**[[policies]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [that we continue to examine our
concepts of]{.underline} justice and **[fairness]{.underline}** and
equality.

An [ethical politics]{.underline} is one in which justice demands the
hyper-vigilance self-critical reflection on where any response---ethical
or political---necessarily falls short. It is an ongoing task that
[**cannot end** with risk-benefit analysis]{.underline}. [Despite the
**ethical insomnia** and **political vertigo** caused by this
interminable self-questioning]{.underline}, [we must
**act**]{.underline}---[even **leap**]{.underline}. Although ultimately
the gap between singularity and universality is impassible, [[the
impossibility of]{.mark} achieving [justice is **no excuse** for not
**attempting it every single day**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This tension between politics (which addresses itself to what can be
seen, and to the universal, what can be shared), and ethics (which
addressed itself to what cannot be seen, and to the singular, what
cannot be shared) is the knot at the center of justice.

[[Justice is **antithetical** to util]{.mark}itarian ethics insofar [as
individuals are **not fungible**]{.mark} **units** that can be
exchanged]{.underline}. [Utilitarianism relies on the **calculability**
of]{.underline} pain, suffering, **[survival]{.underline}**, [or the
quality of life]{.underline} itself. And the [utilitarian calculus
relies on determining **thresholds** that separate individuals into
groups]{.underline}, whether it is those who are members of the moral
community or the polis, and those who are not (for example animals), or
those [whose lives are **worth saving** and those whose lives are
**not**]{.underline}.

At some point, however, [this type of line-drawing **inevitably**
becomes either **political** or **arbitrary**]{.underline}. Take debates
over the basis for membership in the moral community. What are the
criteria for membership? Intelligence, language, reason, sentience, the
ability to suffer? And [whatever we decide should be the
criteria]{.underline}, [where do we **draw the line**?]{.underline} For
example, what counts as a language? Does the bees signal dance count?
Or, as some argue, is it merely a code and not a language? What counts
as intelligence? Peter Singer argues that great apes should be extended
rights or admitted to the moral community based on their intelligence,
which is greater than severely mentally disabled persons (see Singer,
1999; McMahan, 2009; Anstötz, 1993).Footnote 11 Some disability scholars
such as Eva Kittay have argued against this comparison, insisting that
human beings should be accorded special status regardless of their
mental abilities (Kittay, 1998a, b, 2009).Footnote 12 The controversy
over Singer's argument demonstrates how [utilitarian line-drawing is
always a **fraught endeavor** that ultimately rests on an **arbitrary
cut off point**]{.underline}.

For example, in Animal Liberation, Singer draws the line between calms
and shellfish, who supposedly cannot feel pain (Singer, 1990,
173--4).Footnote 13 But what if we learn that shellfish can feel pain?
In all these utilitarian endeavors, the liminal cases are unsettling
because they reveal the arbitrariness of borders and the inadequacy of
general classifications. This type of line-drawing or threshold not only
ignores the singularity of each individual, but also poses an arbitrary
or political dividing line as a natural border. The same is true of
national borders used to keep migrants out.

We see something similar in covid triage medicine where triage protocols
disadvantage whole classes of people. Old people, disabled people,
cancer survivors. The coronavirus lays bare the fantasy of calculable
criteria as an ethical way of life. Covid reveals gaping inequities in
the length and quality of life caused by social and economic
"pre-existing conditions." Celebrities and politicians from Madonna to
Andrew Cuomo called the coronavirus the "great equalizer." In March
2020, Cuomo tweeted "This virus is the great equalizer." In reality,
covid is the great unequalizer... Footnote 14

The pandemic forces doctors and nurses to make impossible decisions
about who is given the chance to live and who will die. But these
decisions exist in the context of pre-existing conditions of poverty,
racism, and unequal access to health care that skew any attempt at fair
or reasonable calculation. In a fair and just world, there would be
adequate resources available to everyone. Tragically, the real world is
not so fair or just. And [risk-benefit analysis and calculative
reasoning become the justification for **allowing some to
die**]{.underline}. [[When]{.mark} those [calculations]{.mark} pose as
**justice** or **fairness**]{.underline}, [and when they [allow us to
feel **certain**]{.mark}]{.underline}, even righteous, [[in our
**decisions**]{.underline}]{.mark}, then [[they risk a **slippery
slope**]{.mark} that leads us to a place [where **any** and **all life**
can become **disposable**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The pandemic has made painfully clear the limitations of risk-benefit
analysis and calculative reasoning. Doctors and nurses report being
traumatized when forced to decide who will get life saving resources.
Face-to-face with patients, risk-benefit calculations are not as
straight forward as the mathematical or statistical modelling suggests.

A group of research physicians at the University of California,
describes the problem:

[Utilitarian approaches]{.underline} to ethical problems [often
**appear** to be **more practical** than many alternatives]{.underline}:
[we can **know** what the right course of action is by calculating
whichever choice will produce the **greatest good** for the **greatest
number**]{.underline}. Part of the appeal of utilitarian ethics is that
it seems like it should "work." [In the **real world**]{.underline},
however, [performing the relevant calculations can be **far from
easy**]{.underline}. This is especially true in crisis situations. [[It
may be **impossible** to collect]{.mark} the **[data]{.mark}**
needed]{.underline} as input for the calculations, it may be difficult
or impossible [to create the **decision rules**]{.underline} (predicting
prognosis or comparing outcomes) that constitute the calculations, [[the
calculator may be **impaired**]{.mark} by any number of different
factors]{.underline} (moral distress, fatigue, internal and external
pressures, etc.) [or **non-utilitarian moral constraints**]{.underline}
(such as superseding egalitarian policies, or even exponentially
increasing crisis severity) [can make utilitarian approaches
**infeasible**]{.underline}. (Fedyk et al., 2020)Footnote 15

2.4 The "Lessor of Evils"

[Rather than an ethical solution]{.underline}, [utilitarian risk-benefit
analysis]{.underline} in a triage medicine [is a]{.underline}
"**[lesser]{.underline}** of the **[evils]{.underline}**"
[approach]{.underline}. In fact, as I discovered doing research for
Carceral Humanitarianism, when discussing both humanitarian aid and
warfare, experts described risk-benefit and collateral damage
calculations as the "lessor of the evils" (Oliver, 2017). Some even see
these policies of assessing collateral damage as preventing the worst
evil by preventing massacre, genocide, and mass death. But as Hannah
Arendt reminds us, "[Those who choose the lesser evil **forget very
quickly** that they **still chose evil**]{.underline}" (Arendt, 2003,
30).Footnote 16

In Carceral Humanitarianism, I consider the question of "the worst"
violence. There, I argue that contemporary logics of proportionality
employed by both humanitarian aid organization and humanitarian military
operations are designed to mitigate and control violence and death to
avoid the worst violence and death, according to calculations of the
"lessor of evils." Thus, [we must ask what is [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
"most evil," or the [[**worst** evil]{.underline}.]{.mark} We may think
of genocide as the worst evil, and, in the West, "the worst" is often
shorthand for the "final solution" and the Holocaust. Since the end of
World War II, and the Cold War, "[the **worst**]{.underline}" [[has
become associated with]{.underline}]{.mark} the possibility of nuclear
war, even [the [destruction of the]{.mark} **entire
[planet]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[What if the worst is]{.mark} a result of [the **logic of calculation**
taken to the **extreme**]{.mark} at the expense of **all other
worldviews**?]{.underline} [What if the worst is [when this]{.mark}
calculable [way of thinking is used to justify
**massacre**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[genocide]{.underline}**, [and
**mass death**?]{.underline}]{.mark} [When lives become
**fungible**]{.underline} and exchange, then [we risk]{.underline} "[the
**worst**]{.underline}." Insofar as contemporary so-called
"humanitarian" warfare operates according to the logic of utilitarian
calculations of collateral damage that make some lives disposable, it
too risks "the worst."

[[The worst goes **beyond literal killing** and signals]{.mark} the
**[erasure]{.mark}**]{.underline} a way [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} seeing
the world---or we might as well say [[a **world
itself**]{.underline}]{.mark}---[by **covering it over** with another
worldview]{.underline}. In this regard, [comparative [models that
**reduce** life to]{.mark} units to be **exchanged** or **plugged into
[equations]{.mark}** [operate according to a **world-destroying
genocidal logic**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is to say, when "the worst"
becomes part of the economy of "lessor of evils," life and death are
reduced to a logic of calculation that makes them fungible; one life is
weighed against another. Which is the lesser evil: One thousand four
hundred and twenty-two refugees who died in the Mediterranean Sea in
2020 or the cost to citizens of the European Union of providing safe
passage to refugees? Which is the lesser evil: killing one civilian
infant or killing three soldiers in a surgical strike? Which is the
lessor evil: a 50-year-old diabetic and mother of two with covid dying
because she doesn't have access to a ventilator, or a widowed and
otherwise healthy 70-year-old man dying without access to a ventilator?
Etc. Etc.

What is an acceptable death? The death as collateral damage? [To be
**calculable**]{.underline}, [each life must be **reducible** to a
common denominator and **exchangeable**]{.underline}. [Each life becomes
a unit in an equation]{.underline}, a risk factor.

Yet, as the examples I just mentioned suggest, [these [decisions as
to]{.mark} which is **worse**]{.underline}---[or which is [the
**lesser**]{.mark} of the [evils]{.mark}]{.underline}---[are
**[always]{.mark}** made by **[privileg]{.mark}ing [one
context]{.mark}** over another]{.underline}. Citizenship over foreign
nations. Civilians over military. Diabetes over motherhood. [[How do we
**weigh** one life against another?]{.underline}]{.mark} [How do we
decide whose life is worth **more**?]{.underline} Whose life is worth
more and whose life is expendable as collateral damage? [[Which factors
are]{.mark} deemed **[relevant]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark}
which are **[not]{.mark}**?]{.underline} Which goals are deemed worthy,
and which are not? Ultimately, [[util]{.mark}itarian calculus **[cannot
give us the answers]{.mark}** to these questions]{.underline}.

### Framework---Clash Turns K---2AC

#### [CLASH TURNS THE K]{.underline}. Focusing on the [epistemic]{.underline} consequences of the plan over the [material]{.underline} ones [weakens]{.underline} anticolonial struggle.

**Temin, 24**---assistant professor of political science and on the
faculty in Native American Studies at the University of Michigan, go
blue (David, "A decolonial wrong turn: Walter Mignolo\'s epistemic
politics," Constellations, Early View, doi:10.1111/1467-8675.12744, dml)
\[inserted "it" for grammatical cohesion, insertion denoted by
brackets\]

In conclusion, I briefly suggest an alternative to Mignolo\'s epistemic
politics, which I refer to as worldly anticolonialism. What I call
worldly [anticolonialism addresses epistemic challenges to colonial
categories]{.underline} such as dominant universalisms [with an eye
targeted to their **identifiable historically situated political
effects**]{.underline}. Accordingly, an [analysis]{.underline} based on
worldly anticolonialism [would ask how such categories of thought take
**material form**]{.underline}, [in relation to **specific terrains** of
anticolonial political struggle that have been shaped by **variable
colonial relations** of power]{.underline}. One analogous approach can
be found in recent work by Mamdani (2020), who analyzes how continued
investments in the category of the "nation" in settler and postcolonial
societies alike have themselves been generated through the politically
mediated fashioning of specific collective constituencies. The
[political identities and imaginaries]{.underline} of these
constituencies [are]{.underline} deeply [bound to the colonial past
**not only as pure epistemology** but through constitutive political and
historical processes]{.underline}.7 To illustrate some more specific
benefits of worldly anticolonialism as a point of departure, I turn to
the complex relationship between organized labor struggles and
Indigenous peoples' struggles.

Consider that leadership of major trade unions throughout North America
largely continues to believe that extracting more fossil fuels on
Indigenous lands will furnish some of the few remaining good jobs in an
environment of radical austerity and upward redistribution (Sanicola &
Williams, 2021). This framing of worker interests makes it far easier
for fossil fuel corporations to create a profoundly antagonized field of
political contest pitting "workers' interests" (jobs) against those of
"Indigenous peoples" and environmental movements (keeping oil in the
ground) (Walia, 2015).8

[The goals of more radical]{.underline} union membership and
[anticolonial movements must be to present **compelling**]{.underline}
political-economic **[alternatives]{.underline}** based on massive
decarbonization. This means reorienting non-Indigenous working people
toward the ways that their freedom and well-being also depend---albeit
differently than Indigenous peoples themselves---upon securing and
enhancing Indigenous sovereignty (Klein, 2014, pp. 398−407). To be sure,
such union leaders and [some]{.underline} rank-and-file union members
[certainly do participate in]{.underline} the **[pervasive colonial
epistemic erasure]{.underline}** of Indigenous peoples and the
perpetuation of intensely gendered forms of colonial violence when they
seek to construct new pipeline infrastructures to secure their
livelihoods. I want to suggest, however, that \[[it]{.underline}\] [is
**not obvious at all** that critical political theorists should
**primarily**]{.underline} ([let alone]{.underline},
**[only]{.underline}**) [**foreground** this colonial epistemic
arrogance per se as the **primary obstacle** to an alternative
anticolonial coalition praxis]{.underline}. Indeed, [a **key
goal**]{.underline} of worldly anticolonialism [would be to
**reconfigure** this framing of the political situation at
hand]{.underline}, [by imagining **more robust** and
**compelling**]{.underline} affinities, if not convergences, between
[projects]{.underline} of decolonization and decarbonization [that would
**enhance the well-being** of people and the planet]{.underline}.9

This is so because [politics requires **persuasion** and **organizing**
that can reorient the **interests** and **horizon-making capacities** of
political subjects]{.underline}. [The obstacles to this are **not simply
epistemic** in the sense of **diagnosing** and **deconstructing**
colonial worldviews]{.underline}. Instead, [they are rooted in real
interests]{.underline}, [fears]{.underline}, [hopes]{.underline}, [and
so on that make decolonization **unsettling** and
**fraught**]{.underline}---anxiety-provoking---[for those with power and
for those without it but who see no other path beyond current
arrangements of power]{.underline} (Bosworth & Chua, 2021). [Such
investments are both more stubborn and more mediated by **genuine
political conflict** than]{.underline} the **[epistemological
mechanisms]{.underline}** that Mignolo proposes to dislodge.

To be sure, I would agree with Mignolo were he to suggest in response
that colonial epistemic logics are clearly at work in the political
situation I have described here. No one has to look far to find the
frequent racist representations of denigrated Indigenous "tradition" as
an obstacle to "progress" taking the form of ever-more environmentally
ruinous fossil fuel extraction (Mignolo, 2010a, p. 326). Nevertheless,
[there is **no necessary relationship** between the **diagnosis**
of]{.underline} such [colonial logics and]{.underline} the aspirations
that drive many modalities of critique (including anticolonial critique)
to grasp [the possibilities of **transformation**]{.underline} inherent
in struggles over possible futures. Put bluntly, [forcing open those
alternative possibilities **will not come from epistemic
disobedience**]{.underline}. [It will **more likely** unfold through
**impure**]{.underline}, "**[unlikely alliances]{.underline}**"
[that]{.underline} bind together interested constituencies who come to
[imagine an]{.underline} "**[otherwise]{.underline}**" to
carbon-intensive colonial capitalism [from **different entry
points**]{.underline}. [This might happen by reconfiguring]{.underline}
their constitutive [identities and]{.underline}
"[interests]{.underline}" via mobilization and new forms of
solidarity---that is, [through **politics**]{.underline}.10

### Framework---Fiat=Good---2AC

#### Fiat is good. Understanding [policy details]{.underline} and imagining [alternative state formations]{.underline} is [key]{.underline} to anti-colonial resistance.

**Lea, 25**---Dean, School of Social Sciences, Macquarie University
(Tess, "'Staying with the State': Prefiguring Capacities for Change
Within Indigenous Social Policy," *Bureaucratic Occupation: Government
and First Nations Peoples*, Chapter 5, pp. 89-102, SpringerLink, dml)

If this accountability-smothering militarily-scaffolded juggernaut is
accurately described, how might staying with the state be an answer to
the endemic problems of lacklustre Indigenous policy efforts? Especially
given the broader context of well-satisfied liberal settler continuance?
My key point is that [[understanding the]{.mark} **grim
[micro-detail]{.mark}** of already existing affairs]{.underline}, rather
than pretending these are not the defaults, [**[matters]{.mark}** when
thinking about alternatives]{.underline}. This is where Cooper's concept
of **[prefigurative conceptualisation]{.underline}** comes into view. As
Cooper puts it, 'Prefigurative conceptualising ... [takes place
**acutely aware** of the limits]{.underline}, [flaws and problems
of]{.underline} formations conventionally understood as [state
formations]{.underline}' (2017: 349). [To **rethink** bureaucratic
potential from **within the thick** of inveigled relations]{.underline},
[we might note how [some parts of government **aid** resistant community
actions and **champion** the marginalised]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The
**City of Sydney Council**]{.underline} in New South Wales, for
instance, [delivers advice to cyclists on how they might avoid police
fines]{.underline}, perhaps for riding an unregistered bicycle, by
caringly [suggesting alternative routes]{.underline} through the city,
intercepting riders on pathways to transfer the covert intelligence.

[[Many]{.mark} bureau-[professionals will enact **empathetic care** and
try to **do good**]{.mark} within the parameters they are
allocated]{.underline}, [even]{.underline} as they wrestle with
extraordinary feelings of doubts and futility, [knowing they work
**within** systems that also prosecute harm]{.underline}
(Summerson-Carr, 2011; Oland, 2019). Our locum principal is a case
[in]{.underline} point. Phoning me, a stranger, she was attempting
another avenue, having exhausted the possibilities of changing the
hire-and-fire decisions of the education bureau. She was still
[[struggling]{.mark} to make]{.underline} '**[the system]{.underline}**'
[do better]{.underline}. Her [efforts were **not doomed to
fail**]{.underline}. [I might have been a more powerful
advocate]{.underline}, someone [in charge of]{.underline}, [or more
influential over]{.underline}, [corporate services and
finances]{.underline}. [I might have thought of an administrative
workaround]{.underline}, [playing by the rules to bend them
beneficially]{.underline}. I might have been able to cite a mandated
human resources formula or some funding metric or piece of
administrative law, something which would present a reputational or
exposure risk if it wasn't obeyed. [This would be [to **redirect** the
bureaucracy's capacity to inflict]{.mark} accountability-fed
[pain]{.mark} through rules and regulations]{.underline}, [[to
**different outcomes**]{.underline}, [by playing on **procedural
vulnerabilities**]{.underline}]{.mark} and fears: here, in my fantasy
sketch, the caution that surrounds breaking a policy rule. I might have
stayed the course and won the day.

For an alternate scenario, it is perfectly possible to imagine the
abusive teacher being banned from further classroom work, even without
(my fantasised) regulatory threats. [[There are]{.underline}]{.mark},
after all, [[many]{.mark} mechanisms along a continuum of
**[counter-violent bureaucratic tactics]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [from
whistle-blowers to]{.underline} those [tweaking the wording or enactment
of procedures]{.underline}, [[to **soften**]{.mark} administrative
[blows or **open possibilities**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [**[Clever
clauses]{.mark}** help [create]{.mark} the discretionary [space
for]{.mark}]{.underline} Michael Lipsky's (1980) '[**[street level
bureaucrats]{.underline}**']{.mark}---those facing clients, customers,
patients, wrong-doers, applicants, supplicants, students, fee-payers,
aka 'publics'---[to be **generous** with anomalies]{.underline} (Tummers
& Bekkers, 2014); that is, [[to turn a blind eye]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[to understand]{.mark} the computer made [a
mist]{.mark}ake]{.underline}, [to help [fill in]{.mark} the
[paperwork]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[or]{.mark} to be a friendly
[provide]{.mark}r of practical [solutions]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Internally, [within [the **wordsmithing**]{.mark} **sentinel sites [of
policy formulation]{.mark}** closer to ministries and further from
streets]{.underline}, [progressive political tactics [can]{.mark}
include the long careful work of **negotiating alliances** to [usher new
programs into funded agreements that might yield **material benefits**
for Indigenous people]{.mark}]{.underline}: a housing repair program or
a renal dialysis service, for example. [[Such actions represent
**genuine**]{.mark} **forms of [relief]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[**reform** [and **reprieve**]{.mark}]{.underline} (rewards) [within
otherwise overwhelming bureaucratic systems]{.underline} (thumbscrews).

Staying with the state, [[it is possible]{.underline}]{.mark}, as
Foucault reminds us, [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} '[[**test** governmental
action]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[**gauge** its
validity]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and]{.mark} to [**object** to]{.mark}
activities of the public authorities on the grounds of their
abuses]{.underline}, [excesses]{.underline}, [futility]{.underline},
[and wasteful expenditure]{.underline}' (Foucault, 2008: 246). [It is
**not mandated** that the state resembles a corporate
entity]{.underline}, [shrouding its intents]{.underline} in NPM logics,
[attuned to [extractive]{.mark} capital
[priorities]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It can be turned to **new
possibilities**]{.underline}. These are our systems, after all. As I
write these words, the New Zealand government has released an inaugural
wellbeing budget, where key measures are not gross domestic product but
measures of citizen happiness, through investments in affordable
housing, tenant-friendly rental regulations, domestic violence
eradication, and greater environmental protection.Footnote 2 Writing
about prison abolition, Ruth Wilson Gilmore and Craig Gilmore make the
point that [the profound change in the [state]{.mark}'s
[priorities]{.mark}]{.underline} under neoliberalism, 'away from public
education, away from health care, away from affordable housing and
environmental protection---and toward prisons, jails, policing, and
courts', [represent redirections in spending]{.underline}, [the
acceptance of which have been **publicly cultivated**]{.underline}
(Gilmore & Gilmore, 2007: 148). And [what has been ideologically and
materially curated [can be **directed
differently**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Process-sequencing considers the possibility of shifting directions, or
even reversals, within the trajectory of history]{.underline} (Howlett
and Rayner 2006; G. Wilson, Alcantara, and Rodon 2020). Such reversals
can take place as the result of frictions that exist between multiple
layers or players of a particular organization (Lieberman 2002) or from
recurrent patterns of institutional change that are embedded in an
organization or its surrounding context. [The successes of Permanent
Participants in meaningfully shaping the content and issue framing of
major Arctic Council outputs suggest that the Arctic Council's structure
is not as binding as previously thought. This model has risen in
prominence in political science as an alternative to path dependency or
narrative models, as it has the potential to offer a better explanation
for the creation and development of national political institutions, as
well as political ideas, discourses, and paradigms]{.underline}
(Lieberman 2002; Lindner 2003). Likewise, this approach appears more
closely aligned to the actual empirical record of changes found in many
countries and public policy sectors (Baumgartner and Jones 2002; Howlett
and Rayner 2006).

Proponents of process-sequencing argue that it has advantages over the
path dependency model, as it "provides a plausible way to represent and
account for historical trajectories, it builds social actors and
multiple causal timelines into explanatory accounts, and it offers a
richer sense of how earlier outcomes shape later ones" (Haydu 1998,
341). Sequence does matter. However, this particular theory does not
find all sequences to be irreversible; and, unlike path dependency, it
does not rely on randomized initial conditions to set an organization's
trajectory in motion. Instead, from this perspective, [reiterated
problem-solving within an organization may lead to real shifts and
changes in trajectories. In other words, process-sequencing stresses the
fact that events during an organization's existence can matter for
trajectory just as much as early lock-in events]{.underline} (Mahoney
2000), [and it likewise de-emphasizes the arbitrariness of environmental
conditions at an organization's founding]{.underline} (Abbott 1992).
Further, this approach affirms ways that organizational members'
reflections on structural development (whether negative or positive)
affect their behavior (Lindner 2003).

As such, [this perspective better captures intra-organizational Council
behavior. Lock-in assumes that Permanent Participants would only be able
to veto projects and develop recommendations in Working
Groups]{.underline}, since these are venues to inject influence afforded
to them in the Council's initial Rules and Procedures. [Yet, in the past
fifteen years, the Permanent Participants have ensured that major
Council reports take into account the human dimension of the Arctic,
rather than just economic factors]{.underline}, as Arctic policy tends
to draw heavily from the data and recommendations of Council's reports.
[This shift has led policies to be more holistic in their treatment of
the region, meaning that they emphasize the interconnected nature of the
Arctic's many dimensions13]{.underline} and the multi-dimensional
characteristics that problem-solving must take (Brigham 2013;
Watt-Cloutier 2016). Additionally, they have ensured Observers commit to
Indigenous consultation before undertaking Arctic extraction projects,
which was unanticipated.

[In process-sequencing, change takes place in a series of steps, as
organizational paradigms are constructed and destroyed]{.underline}. One
way that this happens, best articulated by Baumgartner and Jones (2002)
(i.e., focused on the United States domestic policy arena), is
[punctuated equilibrium. In this model, incremental change and periods
of atypical dynamics join to form an overall stepped or punctuated
equilibrium pattern. Change takes place as an irregular, stepped
function when relatively prolonged periods of stability are broken up by
occasional periods of change]{.underline}. Within the context of an
organization, this means that [routine periods of non-innovative
behavior, when members utilize existing processes and resources, are
interspersed by atypical behavior that involves new
activities]{.underline}. These activities "represent a sharp break from
how processes were developed, conceived, and implemented in the past,
but are still rooted in 'the same general or member-specific concerns or
problems' (Howlett and Rayner 2006, 16, emphasis added). Similarly,
Howlett and Rayner (2006) suggest that, while it is more common for
punctuation to happen in subsystem equilibriums, at the systemic or
regime level, things tend to be more stable. This perspective implies
that, [for the Arctic Council (i.e., a major, but single organization in
the mosaic that makes up the Arctic governance system) reversals are
possible, and are more theoretically likely, especially when combined
with member persistence]{.underline}.

In the Arctic, it seems not only to be the case that understandings of
sovereignty are evolving (Branch 2011; Whyte 2017), but also that
[understandings of organizational constraints are shifting in to
consider organizational structures less static than previously
anticipated. After all, Permanent Participants are coming up with new
ways to assert their interests, with a particular boom of activity after
a decade-long lull post-Council creation]{.underline}.

[At the Council's founding, and even through the early 2000s, few
stakeholders could have imagined that Permanent Participants would
create their own policy papers that would compete with over 200 other
actors to inform the content of the Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment
(2009), or conduct a multi-year oral history collection as traditional
knowledge data for the Arctic Impact Climate Assessment (2004). Such
strategies required those Permanent Participants who were involved to
expend significant costs, labor, and resources that would not be funded
or institutionally supported by the Council. Yet Permanent Participant
referenced and used these intra-organizational products in the
development of major Arctic Council outputs, which would go on to have
real and significant impacts on state shipping and transit policies and
the benchmarks states use to measure the effects of climate change over
time]{.underline}.

### Arctic Council=Good---1AR---SDWG=Good

#### Specifically -- the Arctic Council's SDWG uses traditional knowledge and Permanent Participant guidance to promote Indigenous rights.

[The Sustainable Development Working Group (SDWG) of the Arctic
Council]{.underline}, established in response to the growing emphasis on
sustainable development during the 1990s, [is dedicated to guiding
Arctic states in safeguarding the environment, economies, cultures, and
health of both Indigenous communities and other Arctic
inhabitants]{.underline}.54 [SDWG prioritizes the comprehensive
well-being and human aspects of sustainable development]{.underline},
encompassing health, education, cultural heritage, infrastructure,
economic growth, and natural resource management.55

[SDWG's interpretation of sustainable development extends **beyond** the
**conventional balance** of social, environmental, and economic factors
to **include traditional knowledge**]{.underline}, although its
definitions and applications are not explicitly detailed in official
documents. Since 2017, aligning with the UN Sustainable Development
Goals, [SDWG has emphasized incorporating **t**]{.underline}raditional
and local **[k]{.underline}**nowledge [into the **A**]{.underline}rctic
**[C]{.underline}**ouncil's [work, marking a **significant step towards
recognizing Indigenous agency** in Arctic policy and governance
development]{.underline}.56

Early SDWG initiatives focused on creating and harmonizing
Arctic-specific Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) and development
guidelines without explicitly adopting a rights-based perspective.57
Despite this, community protection and local participation were central
concerns. [The revival of this project during Finland's 2017--2019
chairship aimed at identifying environmental management best
practices]{.underline} and developing EIA "good practice"
recommendations, this time [incorporating human rights language by
examining international Indigenous rights standards against actual
project development practices in the Arctic.58 This approach highlighted
Indigenous communities as rights-holders and aimed to integrate
international human rights standards]{.underline}, such as those
outlined in UNDRIP, [into the decision-making process, reflecting a
**concerted effort** to engage Permanent Participants and Indigenous
experts in the project]{.underline}.

Furthermore, [SDWG's work has increasingly focused on Indigenous rights
and security, exploring the resilience concept amidst climate change and
its impacts on social, cultural, and economic rights. Projects like
EALÁT and EALLU have assessed the sustainability of Indigenous reindeer
husbandry and food **security, grounding** their **findings** and
recommendations **in** inter-national human rights and **Indigenous
Peoples' legislation**]{.underline}.59 These initiatives advocate for
the inclusion of Indigenous communities in biodiversity and climate
adaptation strategies, emphasizing self-determination in resource
management.

### Arctic Council=Good---1AR---Permanent Participants=Good

#### Permanent Participants have influence within the Council and beyond it.

In 1995 Canada created an Ambassador for Circumpolar Affairs and
appointed Mary Simon to the position. When negotiating the establishment
of an [Arctic Council]{.underline}, she was able to create a Permanent
Participant cate-gory. [Permanent Participants]{.underline} (PPs) would
not have the same status as states, but they would also not be
observers. They [could sit at the table with senior Arctic officials for
a dialogue. It was the first such category for Indigenous peoples in an
international organization. The ministerial meeting in Ottawa that
established the Arctic Council thus became a milestone for the three
Indigenous peoples' organizations included]{.underline}. In later
meetings, the number grew to include additional PPs who represented
either a single Indigenous people resident in more than one Arctic
state---or more than one Arctic Indigenous people resident in a single
Arctic state. In accordance with these criteria, the Aleut International
Association was admitted in 1998, and the Arctic Athabaskan Council and
the Gwich'in Council International in 2000 (Yefimenko 2021). Although
the Arctic Council is not a formal international organization
established by treaty, it has a secretariat and established rules of
procedure allowing for ongoing Indigenous participation (Rottem 2016:
149).

It has been difficult to sustain many of the cooperative aspects of the
Arc-tic Council, culminating in the suspension of its activities in
2022. Although security matters had been kept out of the Council since
its inception, Russia increasingly perceived NATO as posing a threat to
its sovereignty and resources and built up its military accordingly
(Spohr 2018). States in the region now issue "Arctic strategy" reports
that detail the connection between national security, homeland defense,
and other issues in support of over-all national defense policy
(Department of the Air Force 2020). US--Russian relations openly
deteriorated as a result of Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea. In
response, the United States imposed economic sanctions that pre-vented
American firms from investing in Russian Arctic oil and gas development.
Nonetheless, Russia continued to cooperate with the Arctic Council. In
May 2021, Russia assumed its place in the revolving chairmanship
(Lavelle 2021). However, the seven non-Russian states of the Arctic
Council decided to put a temporary pause on participating in the
meetings of the Council and its subsidiary bodies after the 2022
invasion of Ukraine (Regehr 2022).

The security dynamics in the Arctic shifted dramatically when Sweden and
Finland sought membership in NATO, thus restoring a degree of the
bipolar nature of the Arctic from the Cold War era. This initiative,
together with the suspension of the Arctic Council, could give the
appearance that the environmental era has ended. Yet the Russian Arctic
is a key component of any environmental issues in the region, such as
permafrost thawing and wildfire prevention (McVicar 2022). Given
Russia's considerable assets, any forum that did not include it would be
attempting to govern an area that is mostly outside of its influence. An
increasing number of states identify with the region, and seek "near
Arctic," permanent observer status in the Arctic Council---most notably
China in recent years (Fravel et al. 2021).

Therefore, as we have seen, the eras connected to Arctic governance
over-lap. Moreover, once issues have been bundled together with the
Arctic challenge, they have remained connected even as other aspects
appear to have reverted to Cold War tensions. [The]{.underline}
environmental initiatives and [expanded political participation of
Indigenous people that have characterized the contemporary era have
continued]{.underline}. The upscaling of the challenge from regional to
planetary is still evidenced by ongoing concerns on the global stage.

Moreover, other frames were added, even during the years when tensions
were rising. In 2005, Sheila Watt-Cloutier filed a petition with the
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights arguing that the impacts of
climate change violated the fundamental human rights of Indigenous Inuit
people across the Arctic. Although the Commission did not hear the case,
her action initiated a transformation in how the international community
views climate change. Moving away from discussions of science,
economics, or politics, the action frames climate change as a current
human rights crisis that impacts marginalized communities
disproportionately. The UN Human Rights Council later adopted the first
of a series of resolutions linking climate change to human rights
(Marshall 2022). In framing the issue this way, climate justice
advocates argue that they gain more leverage in both public opinion and
under the law, so that those most affected by it have a seat at the
table. Such framing brings the urgency of the problem to the fore and
helps to focus on human beings and our survival (Watt-Cloutier 2016;
Marshall 2022).

[As the challenges of the Arctic continue to be co-constituted,
understandings of science and the environment and its dangers have been
transformed as groups previously excluded from global governance have
joined the dis-course.]{.underline} Input from the scientific community
in the Arctic region seeks to generate international environmental
cooperation. Yet while scientists do not make value judgments as, for
example, scholars in law and religion do, there is a fundamental clash
between a dominant form of scientific knowledge and the situated
knowledge of local people (Nuttall 2004: 206). Nonetheless, [Indigenous
peoples have (rightly) insisted on their participation in the
construction of knowledge about their communities and environment with
the scientific community]{.underline}. The two groups do not intuitively
share a framework for how to go about doing this; however, [the initial
norms for the participation of Indigenous peoples established through
the AEPS and Arctic Council have remained and influenced other
international organizations]{.underline}.

#### Indigenous participation in the Arctic Council spills up to policy.

Institutional interplay capable of triggering [regulatory advances in
broader regimes also resulted from the legitimacy gain deriving from a
third distinctive feature of the Arctic Council, the **unusually
prominent place given to representatives of indigenous peoples**. Six
associations of indigenous organizations have status as Permanent
Participants, which implies "active participation and full
consultation."]{.underline} Inuit in North America and Greenland are
particularly vulnerable to POP pollutants in marine mammals. [The
participation of Inuit representatives on the Arctic Council served to
raise their awareness to and knowledge about international POP politics
and thus their ability to exert influence. Through this Arctic
institution, Inuit organizations have **direct** and **regular access**
to high-level officials in the foreign ministries of Arctic states,
biannually **even to ministers**]{.underline}. Such political access
proved especially helpful when the locus of international POP regulation
shifted from CLRTAP to the global Stockholm Convention (Fenge 2003).
[The Inuit participants gave priority to engaging U.S. support for an
ambitious instrument, and the U.S. chairmanship of the Arctic Council
during the run-up to the Stockholm Conference provided a platform for
exerting Alaskan influence on relevant decision makers]{.underline}
(Huntington and Sparck 2003, 221--222). [Evidence of their success
includes the Arctic Council's **Barrow Declaration** of
2000,]{.underline} in which ministers agreed to "strengthen efforts to
finalize a comprehensive and verifiable convention at the last session
of the Intergovernmental Negotiations Committee." According to the chair
of the Stockholm Conference, [representatives of indigenous and
environmental organizations influenced the multilateral negotiations in
a productive way and also ensured **sustained publicity** on the
process]{.underline} (Buccini 2003, 250). The Arctic dimension of the
POP problem was symbolized by a carving of an Inuit woman, which was
placed on the chair's table, where it remained throughout the
multilateral negotiations. [The prominent role of indigenous
organizations in the **A**]{.underline}rctic **[C]{.underline}**ouncil
[thus contributed first to the **building** of **a common position**
among Arctic states **on** the desirability of **a strong regulatory
instrument** and thereafter to **maintaining pressure** on negotiators
**to reach agreement**]{.underline}.

#### Poor implementation is due to Arctic Council weakness [broadly]{.underline}, not lack of Indigenous representation. Links are defense at best.

Despite not having an independent legislative or policy-making
authority, the Arctic Council is mandated by the 1996 Ottawa Declaration
to promote cooperation and interaction among Arctic states on issues
related to sustainable development and environmental protection. [Unlike
other international bodies that may function as de facto lawmakers, the
Arctic Council's political status means it **does not** negotiate
international treaties or **make binding decisions**. Its structure,
including working groups, task forces, Senior Arctic Officials, and the
ministerial level, supports its role as a primary **source of
knowledge** and research on Arctic changes]{.underline}.

[The involvement of Indigenous Permanent Participants in the Arctic
Council,14 despite their limited decision-making power, **emphasizes the
Council's commitment to integrating Indigenous perspectives** in
environmental governance]{.underline}. This innovative approach has
spurred collaboration on Arctic environmental and development matters.
Nonetheless, the actual application of Indigenous rights and views
within the Council's activities invites scrutiny on how it enhances
Indigenous agency. A detailed analysis of the Council's impact on
policy, law, and science sheds light on its success in weaving
international human rights standards into environmental governance.

### Arctic Council=Good---1AR---AT: Purely Advisory

#### The Arctic Council's soft law focus is the [result]{.underline} of Indigenous activism -- not a limit on it.

Through this scholarship, another perspective on [the novel nature of
the Arctic Council]{.underline} solidified. This particular outlook is
critical because it [constitutes a shift in which Permanent Participants
began to matter in the ways that they contribute to and benefit from the
norm of soft governance in the Arctic]{.underline}. Whether scholars
argue that the initial membership of the Permanent Participants was due
to the allowance of states (Chater 2015; Koivurova 2008b), or due to
extensive lobbying and campaigning by the organizations (Aalto, Dalby,
and Harle 2003; Broderstad 2011; Martello 2008; Selin and Selin 2008),
the latter's membership in the Council is a meaningful position that
imparts influence. [The presence of **Permanent Participants results in
a Council that placed greater emphasis on soft law**, consensus, and
non-territorial measures of security]{.underline} (e.g. environmental
security, health, and livelihood) [than what would be expected by a
state initiative-driven organization]{.underline} (Koivurova 2010a;
Kolas 2013). A common narrative invoked at the time was that one cannot
talk about the Far North without involving Indigenous Peoples (Gamble
2015; Penikett 2017). This is particularly the case when discussing
problem-solving along the Far North's human and social dimensions. From
the Council's early years, the ICC, Saami Council, and RAIPON
participated in the Sustainable Development Working Group (SDWG) more
consistently and actively than any of the other Working Groups. Even
though some member states had advocated for the Council's narrow
mandate, the SDWG focused strongly on the social and human dimensions of
the Arctic and prolifically produced research and projects on these
topics since the Council's inception. Permanent Participants have
consistently made up a large portion of the Working Group body,
participating in one of the spaces anticipated by early theorists and
practitioners in the Council.

Whether Council spaces were anticipated by early members or not, [the
general consensus of Permanent Participant representatives and many
Indigenous scholars was that Permanent Participant status was a source
of strength]{.underline} (Kuptana 2014; Mack 2018; Meakin 2020; Simon
2010). Among these scholars, Koivurova is particularly prolific. Though
Young predated Koivurova in hypothesizing how [soft, non-binding
governance **advantages non-state actors**]{.underline}, Koivurova
pioneered thinking on how the Permanent Participant class fit within
International Relations theory and the implications their organizational
roles have for the application and development of international law
(Heinamaki 2009; Koivurova 2010b; Koivurova and Heinåmäki 2006; Stepien,
Koivurova, and Tervo 2008). Koivurova's argument was that [the presence
and activity of Indigenous organizations prompted a **reevaluation** of
**i**]{.underline}nternational [law's applicability to the Far
North]{.underline}'s [specific socio-political situations. Indigenous
organizations are thus intentional drivers of change. Similarly,
Loukacheva (2009) framed the **A**]{.underline}rctic
**[C]{.underline}**ouncil [as a space **carved apart** from the
weaknesses of **i**]{.underline}nternational [law where
**I**]{.underline}ndigenous **[P]{.underline}**eople[s could
consequently pursue their interests **without needing state approval**,
given their limited legal capacity]{.underline}. Both arguments rely on
the durability of soft governance in the Arctic; however, the way they
imagine flows of influence and enabling structures differ.

[As the discussion on the Arctic Council has shown increased interest in
Permanent Participants' internationalization over time, we must also
recognize that this interest was facilitated by broader scholarly
interest in Indigenous internationalization efforts]{.underline} that
were taking place across the globe. Internationalization---[moving from
interactions with the state at a domestic level to acting as members of
the international community as an intentional process]{.underline}---is
[a strategy that many Indigenous Peoples view as empowering]{.underline}
(Jull 1999; Koivurova 2010b; Niezen 2000). [Internationalization is
valued as a strategy because of its use of a "boomerang effect:"
compelling states to ensure Indigenous rights through external,
international pressure, rather than trying to compel change through a
state's own domestic colonial structures]{.underline} (Keck and Sikkink
1998, 22). In general, [Indigenous Peoples have not demanded secession
from states, but have instead requested that states recognize and secure
their rights within the structure of the nation-state]{.underline}.
While Permanent Participants were building transboundary connections and
becoming the first Indigenous nations to gain membership in an
international organization, other tribes and nations across the globe
were finding other ways to implement internationalization strategies
tailored to their own political and geographic contexts.

Within the global Indigenous rights movement, [internationalization
surged as a strategy when leaders across multiple countries began to
partner transnationally in a common struggle for rights recognition. For
a number of Indigenous Peoples, their first attempt to directly
participate in the international community was the United Nations, and
their first encounter with the United Nations was with its human rights
mechanisms]{.underline}. Jens Dahl, a nonindigenous participant in the
International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs for 18 years, writes
extensively of the meaning of United Nations attendance for many
Indigenous Peoples:

It was within \[the United Nations forums\] that a particular Indigenous
space emerged. It was a highly frustrating or desperate situation that
pushed people to make the long journey, both geographically and
culturally, from their communities to the polished floors of the United
Nations, where all the world's governments have a seat. At home, they
had tried all legal and political means to ensure they were treated as
equal citizens, to get their civil, political, economic, and cultural
rights recognized, but in vain. They had knocked their heads against a
brick wall and there was no other way forward except to appeal to the
international community. (Dahl 2012, 2)

Through their dynamic interactions over time, both the "global wave of
Indigenous movement" and states engaged in a "new social construction"
within the United Nations and regional organizations (Lightfoot 2008,
84). A new supranational identity of indigeneity emerged out of this
process, informed by the discourse coming out of varied contexts,
including, but not limited to, Latin American, Australasia, and North
American Indigenous movements. Moreover, among certain segments of the
global Indigenous population, this became a new global layer of
Indigenous identity.

In Latin America, the subjectivity of definitions that centered on
Indigeneity and self-determination was addressed in many by the groups'
internationalization strategies. In Bolivia and Ecuador, for instance,
government attempts during the second half of the 20th Century to
develop national identities that rallied around the national interest of
developing extractive industries came at the expense of excluding
Indigenous Peoples' interests (Merino 2018). In response, Indigenous
Peoples across Latin America organized transnationally to overcome
assimilation policies, forming transnational unions, ethnic federations
(especially in the Amazon basin), and creating the Indian Council of
South America. This kind of self-determination expressed at the
transnational level led, then, to greater self-determination internally,
and contributed to a greater nuancing of Indigenous terminologies within
global discourse. Moreover, the Indian Council of South America was a
major campaigner for protections of ITK through the World Intellectual
Property Organization, and for the adoption of ILO Convention 169 in
Central and South America, resulting in disproportionately higher levels
of regional adoption of the Convention (Tockman and Cameron 2014).

Similarly, in Mexico during the 1970s, there was a pervasive domestic
effort to present images of a distinct Mexican identity to the
international community, although this image excluded ethnic and
Indigenous groups (Hilbert 1997). In response, Mexican Indigenous
intellectuals and activists, alongside other Latin American Indigenous
Peoples, actively participated in the creation of the UN's Working Group
on Indigenous Peoples (WGIP) in 1982. This was the UN's forum's way of
addressing the widest breadth of issues with the greatest number of
Indigenous Peoples represented. The forum was a unique effort, even
within the UN, offering Indigenous participants the possibility to
express problems on a regular basis, and voice opinions on how these
problems should be solved (Muehlebach 2001, 416). While it is important
to note that this forum offered no real decision-making power, many
Indigenous delegates still conceptualize their presence as a
transnational political and cultural strategy engaged in multiple
issue-area fronts. Indeed, some consider the WGIP to be one of the first
major creations of an Indigenous place in the international community
(Escárcega 2010; Lightfoot 2008; Muehlebach 2001), the result of an
internationalization strategy of place making.

Building on this precedent, Mexican activists used the WGIP to encourage
other states to condemn Mexico's discriminatory domestic practices while
strategically campaigning for specific definitions of Indigeneity and
ITK that aligned with domestic communities' own understandings
(Escárcega 2010). It was through these efforts that the Indigenous term
of self-determination came to differ from the decolonization movement
that followed World War II: the right of peoples to negotiate their
political status and representation in the nation-states in which they
live, rather than as secession (Lightfoot 2008).

More recently, in the Australasian context, a significant body of work
examined how Indigenous anti-colonial research methodologies expanded
from academic and domestic spheres. Indigenous methodologies, initially
focused on returning knowledge ownership back to Indigenous communities,
has expanded to study and promote decolonizing research and extraction
practices at the global level (Van Krieken 2012). The "rich field of
Indigenous Australian intellectual theorizing" also significantly shaped
global discourse on Indigeneity and colonialism (Richardson 2003; Rigney
1999, 110). In particular, definitions of racism and imperialism
developed in the decolonial Australian academic sphere were exported to
international deliberative spaces by critical race and Indigenous
scholars to form the common language used when developing consultative
and self-determination frameworks. Māori rights gains and pro-ITK
discourse contributed to the creation of the UN's Inter-Commission Task
Force on Indigenous Peoples, shaping global opinion to consider
"Indigenous ecological knowledge \[to be\] an asset of incalculable
value" (IUCN 1997, 35).

Together, [these cases tell the story of a sweeping
movement]{.underline}, beginning in the 1970s with Australian, New
Zealand, Latin American, and Canadian Indigenous Peoples leading
activism at the international level, and likewise [increasingly
leveraging internationalization strategies in order to become players
within the international community]{.underline}. As the cases detail,
this shift particularly increased during their participation in the UN
during the 1980s and 1990s, asserting Indigenous rights under an
international human rights framework. [Indigenous movements in all cases
leveraged international campaigns of international opinion (Lightfoot
2008, 88). These states' desire to be recognized internationally as good
stewards of human rights appears to have enabled significant changes
among Indigenous rights in many countries by the early
2000s]{.underline}. Regardless of the region where Indigenous Peoples
use internationalization as a strategy, [proponents of soft law assert
that the strength of this approach lies in the way it empowers
Indigenous Peoples to control their rights narratives. Specifically, it
enables Indigenous Peoples to own their transition from objects to
subjects of international law]{.underline} (Avango, Nilsson, and Roberts
2013). In cases [where international law was underdeveloped, such as in
the Arctic, internationalization was a process in which Indigenous
organizations proactively sought rights-assurance in specific
areas]{.underline} (Dove 2006; Koivurova 2013a; Koivurova and Heinåmäki
2006). [Underdeveloped international law is not a condition for
internationalization, but signals the fact that the Indigenous actors
may benefit from leveraging the language of soft law---norms,
legitimacy, and socialization---that color which internationalization
strategies are used]{.underline}.

Editorial to the Special Issue: Benefit Sharing in the Arctic:
Extractive Industries and Arctic People The Arctic has a long history of
[[extractive industry]{.underline} [activity]{.underline}]{.mark} that
shaped local communities and regional economies. Some of these colonial
path dependencies could be considered negative lock-ins to perpetuate
boom and bust economic cycles, accumulate resources in the hands of
companies, deprive local residents of access to traditional activities
and cause land degradation and pollution \[1--3\]. However, extractive
industries, [despite negative impacts, [have]{.mark} also
[created]{.mark} **[new wealth and local investment]{.mark}** [in
infrastructure]{.mark} with benefits beyond the industry
itself]{.underline} \[4,5\]. [In some communities, extractive industries
have become an essential element of the local social, economic and
political environment]{.underline} \[6\]. As new resource development
comes to the Arctic, the question of benefit sharing becomes as relevant
as ever. [[Benefit sharing is the]{.mark} [distribution of monetary and
non-monetary benefits]{.mark} [between extractive industries and]{.mark}
[communities]{.mark}]{.underline} a ected by extractive operations. [The
essence of benefit sharing]{.underline}, however, [[goes beyond mere
compensation for damage]{.mark} or investment in local
society]{.underline}. [[First]{.underline}]{.mark} of all[,]{.underline}
[[it is about]{.mark} the **[recognition of]{.mark} the [rights]{.mark}
and interests [of]{.mark} the [Indigenous]{.mark}** and local
communities]{.underline}, [[their]{.mark} [sovereignty]{.mark} over
resources [and]{.mark} the [knowledge]{.mark} that they share with the
industry]{.underline}. [[Benefit sharing]{.underline}]{.mark} is rooted
in the Convention on Biological Diversity (1992) and Nagoya Protocol
(2010) \[7\] and [[emphasizes the need to **allocate**]{.mark} **the
[benefits]{.mark} coming [from]{.mark} natural resources
[extraction]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} the **[local
actors]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In this situation, Indigenous and local
communities are viewed as rights-, stake- and knowledge holders.
[[Second]{.underline}]{.mark}ly, [benefit sharing [is about]{.mark}
**[addressing]{.mark} social justice and [inequalities]{.mark}** between
communities and those who commercialize resources]{.underline} \[8\].
[In this sense, it directly links to the corporate social
responsibility]{.underline} ([[CSR]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[and]{.mark}
the social license to operate]{.underline} ([[SLO]{.underline}]{.mark})
[that companies must earn in order to meet the expectation of being
responsible]{.underline} \[9\]. [[More so]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[benefit sharing is a mech]{.mark}anism [to support]{.mark} free, prior
and informed consent]{.underline} (FPIC) [through **[good-faith
negotiations]{.mark}**]{.underline} and meaningful consultations with
Indigenous and local residents a ected by extractive industry \[10,11\].
[[Third]{.underline}]{.mark}ly, [[benefit]{.mark} [sharing is
about]{.mark} the **[empowerment of]{.mark}**]{.underline} (or regaining
control by) the **[[Indigenous Peoples]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and local
communities in the resource-use process]{.underline}, especially in
benefits that are negotiated as a part of FPIC and resource
co-management \[2,12\]. [[Finally]{.underline}]{.mark}, [benefit sharing
may be instrumental [in attaining sustainable]{.mark}, long-term
economic [development in Arctic communities]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[13,14\]. However, not all forms of benefit sharing lead to the desired
outcomes \[9,15\].

### Benefit-Sharing=Good---1AR

#### Benefit-sharing through the state fosters [capacity-building]{.underline} over one-time compensation which sustains local communities. 

**Tysiachniouk** **et. al, 19** -- University of Eastern Finland,
Faculty of Geographical and Historical Studies. (Maria S. Tysiachniouk,
Andrey N. Petrov, Violetta Gassiy. "Towards Understanding Benefit
Sharing between Extractive Industries and Indigenous/Local Communities

https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9276/8/3/155. Accessed: 7-2-2025)//ilake-mc

In contrast, [investment as a [benefit sharing]{.mark} principle [aims
to **support**]{.mark} **or stimulate [current and future
activities]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [capacities and opportunities [in a
community affected by extractive activities]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[It]{.mark} targets the priorities identified by the receiving party or
negotiated with the company]{.underline} (and sometimes the government).
It [may include payments, but also investment in training and education,
developing infrastructure, providing employment opportunities for the
residents, contracting local businesses]{.underline}, etc.
Metaphorically speaking, [[this principle]{.mark} of benefit sharing
[focuses on giving "**a fishing rod instead of a
fish**]{.mark}"]{.underline}. [This principle [thus **empowers local
communities** and **possesses**]{.mark} **[considerable procedural
equity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However, [it also can take paternalistic
forms when **a company substitutes the state** by investing in
infrastructure and local services]{.underline}. Another principle of
benefit sharing is charity. The charity principle is based on the
assumption that [an extractive company has no fundamental obligation to
provide any benefits, but it chooses to share some profits as a matter
of philanthropy and good will]{.underline}. This principle implies
little procedural or distributional equity and may serve as a
self-promotion mechanism for a developer to earn the SLO.

#### Benefit sharing [empowers]{.underline} Indigenous communities by promoting [good-faith]{.underline} collaboration that builds consensus around meaningful benefits.

is Benefit Sharing? Respecting Indigenous Rights and Addressing
Inequities in Arctic Resource Projects," MDPI, pg. 2. Accessed:

While there is no single model of resource and economic development that
has or will work in Aboriginal communities across the country; [[it
is]{.mark} increasingly [clear that]{.mark} **most [Indigenous peoples
are open to partnership approaches]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Collaboration
makes sense for Aboriginal people, communities, companies, governments
and Canada at large.

In an analysis of international law that specifically seeks to clarify
the concept of benefit sharing, Morgera recognizes the iterative and
dialogic nature of the concept as established in international legal
instruments \[1\] (p. 364):

[[\[B\]enefit sharing]{.mark} differs from the unidirectional (top-down)
flows of benefits and, rather, [aims at developing a common
understanding of what]{.mark} [the benefits]{.mark} at stake
[are]{.mark} [and how they should be shared]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
this connection, [[it]{.mark} has been argued that benefit sharing [is
geared towards consensus]{.mark} [building]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It
[entails an **iterative process**]{.mark}**, [rather than]{.mark} a
[one-off exercise]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[of **good-faith
engagement**]{.mark} among different actors]{.underline} [that lays the
foundation for a partnership]{.underline} among them.

### Benefit-Sharing=Good---1AR---State=Key

#### [State-triggered]{.underline} benefit sharing ensures Indigenous communities receive [guaranteed]{.underline} and [enforceable]{.underline} returns from resource projects in the Arctic.

[[Benefit sharing]{.mark} mechanisms have been [defined as **financial,
legal, and procedural**]{.mark} ways that are used to operationalize
benefits sharing]{.underline} \[5\]. There are several key groups of
such mechanisms employed in the Arctic: [**[Streamlined benefits are
stipulated in]{.mark} the [legislation]{.mark}**, regulation, and tax
code]{.underline}. [Long-term contractual obligations, royalty payments,
and production sharing agreements become streamlined when negotiations
are over and agreements are reached]{.underline}. **[[Benefit sharing is
unambiguous]{.underline}]{.mark}**; [the implementation and distribution
processes are identified and repercussions for noncompliance are
prescribed. [Negotiated benefits]{.mark} is an eclectic group of
**negotiated arrangements** between companies and regional, district,
and municipal authorities or directly with communities or indigenous
enterprises]{.underline}. [These arrangements are often [triggered
by]{.mark}]{.underline} external actors, such as [[the
**state**]{.underline}]{.mark} or a foreign investor. This form of
benefits is most closely associated with community investment. A classic
example of such benefit sharing arrangements is a direct benefit
agreement, such as an Impact and Benefit Agreement.

[The RCMP commanders also instructed officers to "use as much violence

roadblock which had been erected by Wet'suwet'en people to control
access to their territories and stop construction of the proposed 670km
(416-mile) ]{.underline}[Coastal GasLink
pipeline](https://www.tcenergy.com/operations/natural-gas/coastal-gaslink)[ (CGL).]{.underline}

[In a separate document, an RCMP officer states that arrests would be
necessary for "sterilizing \[the\] site".]{.underline}

[Wet'suwet'en people and their supporters set up the Gidimt'en
checkpoint in December 2018 to block construction of the pipeline
through this region of mountains and pine forests 750 miles north of
Vancouver.]{.underline}

[On 7 January, RCMP officers -- dressed in military-green fatigues and
armed with assault rifles -- ]{.underline}[descended on the
checkpoint](https://thetyee.ca/Analysis/2019/01/08/LNG-Pipeline-Unistoten-Blockade/)[,
dismantling the gate and arresting 14 people.]{.underline}

[The checkpoint lies 22km east of a camp operated by a house group of
the Wet'suwet'en called
the ]{.underline}[Unist'ot'en](https://unistoten.camp/)[, which has been
at the center of the struggle against the pipeline.]{.underline}

[The camp is one of several instances where Indigenous people in British
Columbia have reinhabited ancestral territory that falls outside of
demarcated reservations, in what they refer to as
"reoccupation".]{.underline}

[Unist'ot'en spokesperson Freda Huson (Howilhkat) said that the RCMP's
militarized posture during the raid was consistent with a long history
of colonial violence.]{.underline}

["In our experience, since first contact, RCMP have been created by the
federal government to dispossess ]{.underline}[Indigenous
peoples](https://www.theguardian.com/world/indigenous-peoples)[ of their

firearms".]{.underline}

[An RCMP spokesperson declined to comment on the specific content of the
documents, saying they were merely carrying out a December 2018
injunction against people who interfere with the CGL
pipeline.]{.underline}

["During the planning for the enforcement of the court-ordered
injunction, the RCMP took the remote location of the Morice River Bridge
into account and ensured that enough police officers were present in the
area to keep the peace," the spokesperson said. "We also took into
consideration the unpredictable nature of what we could face in the
remote area, and so we moved additional police resources including
members of the tactical and emergency response teams to provide
support."]{.underline}

[The revelations come as the Wet'suwet'en camps brace for a provincial
supreme court ]{.underline}[ruling on an
injunction](https://yellowheadinstitute.org/2018/12/12/an-injunction-against-the-unistoten-camp/)[ applied

### Consequentialism---2AC

#### Refusing to consider [consequences]{.underline} makes them [complicit]{.underline} in the structures they critique.

**Zembylas, 25**---Professor of Educational Theory and Curriculum
Studies at the Open University of Cyprus (Michalinos, "Decolonial
pathways in education: Walter Mignolo, epistemic delinking, and the
risks of ethno-essentialism," Globalisation, Societies and Education,
February 3, 2025, DOI: 10.1080/14767724.2025.2459110, dml)

In his critical analysis of intellectual decolonisation, Moosavi
(Citation2020) cautions that while decolonisation efforts are essential,
they come with notable limitations. In particular, he identifies five
such **[[limitations]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [can
**[undermine]{.mark}** the effectiveness of [decolonisation]{.mark}
efforts]{.underline}: [the [tendency to **oversimplify**]{.mark}
decolonisation [as]{.mark} a **[straightforward]{.mark}**
task]{.underline}; [the risk of [**essentialising** or
**appropriating**]{.mark} the Global South]{.underline}; [the failure to
recognise the **varied** and **complex** nature of marginalisation
within academia]{.underline}; [the pitfalls of
**[nativism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which may elevate certain cultural
knowledge uncritically; [[and **tokenism**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[which]{.mark} can **[reduce]{.mark}** decolonisation [to **superficial
gestures**]{.mark} rather than **meaningful change**]{.underline}.
Moosavi argues that [[identifying these]{.mark} pitfalls [is
**critical**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [as certain
approaches]{.underline}]{.mark} [to intellectual decolonisation [may
**inadvertently perpetuate** the **very coloniality they aim to
dismantle**]{.mark}]{.underline}, thereby [**[reinforcing]{.mark}**
[power]{.mark} hierarchies and marginalisation [rather than
**subverting**]{.mark} them]{.underline}. His insights serve as a
reminder that decolonisation must be approached thoughtfully and
critically, ensuring it is grounded in genuine inclusivity and avoids
replicating reductive or exclusionary practices.

Similarly, Naicker (Citation2023) warns that decolonial theory's
'[exclusively and moralistically exclusionary anti-Westernism begins
**mirroring** the rightist tendencies it sought to locate **solely**
within a **fabricated Western essence**]{.underline}' (237).Footnote1
Although such a sweeping critique risks oversimplifying decolonial
theory, it raises important concerns about the potential pitfalls of an
epistemic approach to decolonisation, particularly regarding its
reliance on identity politics. [[When]{.mark} decolonial
[discourse]{.mark} [**primarily** focuses on **rejecting**]{.mark}
Western [frameworks **without** self-reflection on]{.mark} the
**[consequences]{.mark}** of such move]{.underline}, [[it risks becoming
**entangled** in the **same exclusionary impulses**]{.mark} it seeks to
challenge]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} critique points to a crucial
tension in decolonial thought: how can scholars engage in meaningful
anticolonial work without reducing the complexities of colonial power
relations to a binary opposition between 'the West' and 'the non-West'?

One reason I prefer the term 'anticolonial' (Sefa Dei and Lordan
Citation2016; Zembylas Citation2024) over 'decolonial' is because it
[underscores the need to embed **historical awareness** and **political
engagement** into decolonial work]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}
approach [challenges scholars to [go **beyond**]{.mark} a strictly
[epistemic]{.mark} focus]{.underline}, [[asking]{.underline}]{.mark}
instead [[whether]{.mark} our]{.underline} decolonisation [[efforts
address **material** realities]{.mark} and power structures that
perpetuate colonial legacies]{.underline}. [While epistemic
decolonisation **critiques** Western knowledge hierarchies]{.underline},
[it often **stops short** of engaging with the **political** and
**material mechanisms** that reproduce these hierarchies]{.underline}.
[This raises an important question]{.underline} for decolonial
scholarship in education: [Are scholars at risk of **inadvertently
reinforcing** essentialist or exclusionary narratives that may align
with nationalist or authoritarian agendas?]{.underline}

Future investigations into anticolonial thought in education should
therefore consider several critical questions. How can scholars ensure
that decolonial work does not become co-opted to support
ethno-essentialist or exclusionary politics, as seen when nationalist
discourses appropriate decolonial language to advance their own
hegemonic ends? How can decolonial scholarship in education remain open
to plural voices and multiple narratives without devolving into
uncritical nativism? Additionally, how might we address the complex
interplay between local and global forms of oppression without reducing
anticolonial thought to a simplistic dichotomy between 'the West' and
'the non-West'? [Addressing these questions may allow education scholars
to develop anticolonial approaches that not only **critique** epistemic
colonialism]{.underline}, [but also **actively challenge** political and
material structures that **hinder** collective liberation and social
justice]{.underline} through educational policies and practices [in
**different** political contexts]{.underline}.

### Decolonization's Not A Metaphor---2AC/1AR

#### If they won't defend [material implications]{.underline} of the alt, it [reinforces]{.underline} colonialism.

**Shah, 24**---School of Anthropology and Museum Ethnography, University
of Oxford (Alpa, "When decolonization is hijacked," Volume 126, Issue 4,
December 2024, Pages 553-566, dml)

Indeed, [scholars have **questioned** the use of
**decolonization**]{.underline}. Eve Tuck and K. Wayne Yang (Tuck &
Yang, 2012), working on the United States and other settler colonial
nations, stated, "[[Decolonization is **not a
metaphor**]{.underline}]{.mark}." [[It is not about]{.mark} improving
our **societies**]{.underline}, **[schools]{.underline}**, [or
**[methods]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[It is not]{.mark} just [about
**culture**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact, [[the decolonial desire can
get entangled in resettlement]{.underline}]{.mark},
[reoccupation]{.underline}, [and re-inhabitation [that **furthers
settler colonialism**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For Tuck and Yang (2012),
[[decolonization **must have material
implications**]{.underline}]{.mark}, reparations [of Indigenous land and
life]{.underline}.

### Epistemology Focus Fails---2AC

#### Theorizing coloniality as epistemological [defuses]{.underline} anticolonial struggles by [downplaying]{.underline} material factors.

**Temin, 24**---assistant professor of political science and on the
faculty in Native American Studies at the University of Michigan, go
blue (David, "A decolonial wrong turn: Walter Mignolo\'s epistemic
politics," Constellations, Early View, doi:10.1111/1467-8675.12744, dml)

On this basis, I think [it is **mistaken** to imply that]{.underline}
these intertwined material and ideological [practices can profitably be
subsumed into]{.underline}, [or made a consequence of]{.underline},
"**[coloniality of knowledge]{.underline}**." In short, Mignolo\'s
account misapprehends the fact that [it is]{.underline} these
constitutive **[material practices]{.underline}**---[not simply
the]{.underline} world of the colonial/modern
"**[imaginary]{.underline}**" that they birthed---[that extend into the
present]{.underline} (Mignolo, 2012, p. 6). The more compelling
interpretation presented by scholars of Indigenous and settler-colonial
studies is that there is in fact no clear "event" of rupture (see Wolfe,
2006) or sharp distinction in the Americas between the formal
colonization and occupation of Indigenous societies' lands and a
subsequently more informal, diffuse set of colonial practices to be
labeled as coloniality. Mignolo is certainly right that imperial and
national narratives are entangled. Yet, this intertwinement is only
plausible if interpreted as a statement about the material structures
through which these narratives help to constitute (and do ideological
work in service of the reproduction of) hierarchically stratified
collective subjectivities.

To be sure, my own account of settler-[colonial formations should not be
**overgeneralized** nor **isolated** from other axes of
power]{.underline} (Vimalassery et al., 2016). Moreover, [marking the
end of formal colonial rule is **crucial** for some contexts in which
the]{.underline} imperial power and/or [colonizer society is forced out
but creates **intermediary structures** of unequal relations mediated
through]{.underline} bilateral and international
**[institutions]{.underline}**. The latter are properly the subject of
an analysis akin to forms of "neo-colonialism," dating back to
Nkrumah\'s (1966) classic work. Note, however, that account would
mischaracterize a significant aspect of the situation of Latin America.
Indeed, Mignolo\'s claim that the "conditions have changed. Colonizers
were no longer occupying countries" obscures the ongoing
settler-colonial dynamics of the very geographies where Mignolo situates
his own thinking (Ybarra, 2017).

To be sure, [there is a **complicated set** of variation]{.underline}
and converge [in]{.underline} the racialization processes that hook up
with dominant settler nation-building ideologies (e.g., an ideal of
mestizaje/mixing vs. one-drop racial purity) (Hooker, 2017) and [the
**variable colonial strategies** of land dispossession and labor
exploitation]{.underline} across the Americas, North and South (Gott,
2007; Speed, 2017).5 Nevertheless, Latin American states are---like
their Anglo-settler counterparts---settler-colonial states (Dahl,
2023).6

Why underscore this (perhaps seemingly subtle) divergence? The
differences between coloniality of power and ongoing colonization I am
recounting here may at first blush appear too minor to be worth
pursuing, given the shared emphases on the centrality of colonial power
to political rule, subjectivity, and sociality. For example, scholars
such as Singh (2019) and Mendoza (2016, 2020) have mobilized the MCD
approach in quite productive dialogue with Indigenous and
settler-colonial studies while carefully acknowledging potential
divergences in geographic and conceptual reference points.

One response to my critique is to maintain that Mignolo is simply
theorizing these same material relations through a different lens. I
grant that Mignolo\'s concept of the colonial matrix of power attempts
to encompass material practices, albeit in a rather amorphous way. He
refers to four "specific historical-structural nodes" that include the
material: knowledge and subjectivity; racism, gender, and sexuality,
authority, and economy'' (Mignolo, 2011, pp. 9, 35). Yet these four
"heads" or "interrelated spheres of management and control" are
supported by two "legs"---the "racial and patriarchal foundations of
knowledge," and it is the latter avowedly epistemic and ontological
hierarchies built into the underlying logic of Western knowledge-forms
that he primarily identifies as the "mechanism" of reproduction that
decolonial thinking sets out to disrupt (Mignolo, 2011, pp. 8−9,
216−218). My argument is that [even in formulations gesturing
at]{.underline} just [this connection to material power
relations]{.underline}, it is still fair to observe that [the
relationship **implausibly** runs in a **single
direction**]{.underline}: [from a **separate domain** of epistemology to
**material practices**]{.underline}.

Beyond settler colonialism, [this]{.underline} inattention to the
ideologically mediated character of political epistemology also [tends
to **displace** other valuable analytics by **divorcing** them from
historically grounded accounts of material reproduction]{.underline}. To
take only one example, Mignolo likewise treats capitalism as a form of
knowledge that he labels as "economic coloniality," rather than the
material practices and forms of productive power that secure the process
of "self-valorizing value" (i.e., profit-making and accumulation) in
part through colonial conquest. In general, Mignolo\'s suggestion here
is that racism and patriarchy ought to be apprehended as
ontological-qua-epistemological hierarchies, as opposed to social
practices of defining disposable and exploitable populations that vary
(alongside and with class formation) with social formations or regimes.
[The tendency to posit these **a priori meta-logics**
reduce]{.underline} what other thinkers have productively theorized as
**[quite material structures]{.underline}** of colonial and racial
capitalism (Bhambra, 2021a; Burden-Stelly, 2020; Ulas Ince, 2018)
[to]{.underline} "economic **[coloniality]{.underline}**" [from which
one has an]{.underline} "**[option]{.underline}**" [to escape the
thought patterns]{.underline} thereof.

5 MIGNOLO\'S EPISTEMIC POLITICS

In this section, I further connect these theoretical disagreements to
their political implications. One of the central questions underlying
the MCD project has been an open-ended one about how to refashion
critique in a less Eurocentric key: "What should 'critical theory' be
when the damnés de la terre are brought into the picture" (Mignolo,
2010a, p. 303). I will argue, however, that Mignolo\'s version of
[decolonial thought]{.underline} does not really function as critique
with respect to at least two desirable criteria for a specific critique
of colonial power relations: (1) the capacity to account for the
objective and subjective dimensions of the experiences of domination
that colonized actors articulate through struggles over the terms of
social and political relations and (2) the capacity to account for how
beneficiaries of relative power disavow our/their location in such
relations, which is fundamental to obscuring (and producing via
"feedback loops" or recursive processes) those oppressive social and
political structures. My claim is that the historical account and
central analytic of power that is articulated in the framework of
de/coloniality subtly undercuts both of these criteria. Instead, readers
are left with a project that gives preference to "epistemology" over a
thorough examination of structural and political settlements and social
forces that constrain and shape the conditions for thought and action. I
refer to Mignolo\'s tendency to privilege epistemology in this
particular mode [as an]{.underline} "**[epistemic
politics]{.underline}**."

As to point (1), Indigenous studies scholars engaged in otherwise very
different projects such as Simpson (2014), Byrd (2011), Speed (2017),
Coulthard (2014), and Estes (2019) have nevertheless all theorized
settler colonialism as an ongoing set of practices premised on an
unyielding subjection to land dispossession and territorial occupation.
They all underscore structural continuity across historically variable
strategies of colonization. Indigenous scholars and activists also
espouse an intergenerational political project of resurgence and
resistance, which foregrounds the interpretive and material task of
severing these structurally unbroken links between colonial past,
present, and future. By contrast, Mignolo flatly rejects this conception
of decolonization. He **[dismisses]{.underline}** "[any act or project
of decolonization]{.underline}" [that refers to an]{.underline}
"[indeterminate domain of]{.underline} '**[reality]{.underline}**'"
(Mignolo, 2011, p. 54). [Such a claim **redirects** readers to a
critique of colonial categories as **cognitive illusions**]{.underline},
that is, [as **pernicious epistemic inventions**]{.underline}.
Ultimately, [the latter formulation **misapprehends** the crux of this
relationship between]{.underline} the intergenerational experience of
[specific]{.underline}, [material axes of colonial violence and the task
of theorizing (de)colonization]{.underline}.

More broadly still, [it is precisely attention to]{.underline} a
(intersubjective but no less "real") domain of
**[reality]{.underline}**---which includes the imaginary as a product of
social life---[that **matters** when considering the **political
stakes** of decolonization]{.underline}. Critical social and political
theory is about "resisting reality," in the words of feminist
philosopher Sally Haslanger (2012). [Without this kind of orientation to
**material realities**]{.underline}, [the valuable project of remedying
deep colonial epistemic injustice]{.underline} (see Bhambra, 2021b)
[becomes **highly attenuated** from]{.underline} the sociality and
claims-making at issue in mobilization around [anticolonial
demands]{.underline}, [such as enforcing Indigenous sovereignty and
treaties and returning stolen land]{.underline} ("land back").

My second criteria, point (2), focuses on the way that those who benefit
from intergenerational projects of colonial erasure---"settlers"---are
far more inclined to disavow those structures by denying the
constitutive structural antagonisms in which we/they are situated.
Mignolo aims to distance epistemological questions from what he casts as
a more conventional sociological way of tracking the reproduction of
power in and through discursively generated knowledge claims. To return
as a case in point to a formulation I have already quoted: "What matters
is not economics, or politics, or history, but knowledge. Better yet,
what matters is history, politics, economics, race, gender, sexuality,
but it is above all the knowledge that is intertwined in all these
practical spheres that entangles us to the point of making us believe
that it is not knowledge that matters but really history, economy,
politics, etc." (Mignolo & Walsh, 2018, p. 135) (my emphasis). Here, I
take it that Mignolo is arguing that a central obstacle to remedying
colonial epistemic injustice is an overfocus on patterned material
practices to the point that they are reified as social reality. The
issue with [this claim]{.underline} is that it [**downplays** the **real
dilemmas** faced by differently situated constituencies]{.underline},
[when they seek to undo their practical participation in and/or
subjection to structures of colonial violence]{.underline}. Undoubtedly,
unlearning certain epistemological biases comprises part of the latter
project---say, for example, hierarchies that place formalized written
histories over oral histories as valid evidence in juridical forums
(Nichols, 2020). Yet, it is the partially interest-based constitution of
differentiated, power-inflected perceptions of social phenomena that
critical theorists assess in diagnosing why certain pathological
knowledge-forms are so difficult to dislodge and why they are reproduced
in time and space. More concretely stated, [the turn to coloniality as a
**purely epistemic** register of critique **directs significant
interpretive attention away** from the crucial fact that]{.underline}
settler [epistemic and aesthetic disavowal]{.underline} of the grounds
of Indigenous mobilization and critique [are **part-and-parcel** of
settlers' long-term accumulation of material and intergenerational
wealth through removal and displacement]{.underline}.

Indeed, [one of the **most powerful targets** of critical thought
**sorely lacking** here is the challenge to]{.underline} narratives,
alibis, ideologies, and so on as [practices that]{.underline} both
enable distorted moral truth-bending and systemically [function as
legitimation devices for **material hierarchies** that the dominant
beneficiaries]{.underline} of those systems [refract through their
**seemingly unrelated**]{.underline} ([and]{.underline}, [for
them]{.underline}, **[benign]{.underline}**) [subjective]{.underline},
[affective]{.underline}, [cultural]{.underline}, [and social
investments]{.underline}. [**Tuck** and **Yang**]{.underline} (2012)
[have]{.underline} aptly [insisted that]{.underline} "**[decolonization
is not a metaphor]{.underline}**" so as [to move away from the **loose
use** of decolonization as an **overly capacious**
analytic]{.underline}, [because it is then deployed institutionally as a
**symbolic gesture** that **defuses demands for specific material
follow-up**]{.underline} (see Okoth, 2021), such as restitution (e.g.,
land back) and respect for Indigenous sovereignty and
self-determination. Likewise, [an analysis that **dismisses** the
expression of colonial thought-forms through **specific material
systems** of domination will end up **blurring beyond recognition** the
very emancipatory goals of]{.underline} the enterprise of social and
political [criticism]{.underline}. In short, [the **outsize work** of
the epistemic]{.underline} in Mignolo\'s thought [tends to **wrest these
motivating horizons away** and to place them]{.underline} instead [far
in the **background**]{.underline}. [These are the unfortunate political
effects of]{.underline} the "**[epistemic decolonization]{.underline}**"
that Mignolo foregrounds.

A key implication of my argument here is that the problem of settler
disavowal---or settler attachment and constitution through violence
(Kotef, 2020)---cannot exclusively or even primarily be attributed to
the epistemic "arrogance" that Mignolo (2011, pp. 90−91, 2012)
identifies with "the hubris of the zero point" epistemology, claims to
"truth without parentheses," or the universalizing of "local" European
knowledge projects as "global designs" onto the local histories of the
world. My claim here is not only that this is a misguided way of doing
critical social theory, but also that it has negative implications for
doing critical political theory. Specifically, [it is **not clear**
that]{.underline} claiming to---even genuinely seeking to---live
[this]{.underline} "[decolonial]{.underline}" [epistemological openness
leads in **any particularly liberating political
direction**]{.underline}, [especially without **sustained attention** to
the real-world constituencies in play]{.underline}. More bluntly stated,
[this prescription does **little** to **directly analyze** and/or
**unsettle** epistemic or other attachments insofar as they function as
**enabling investments** in institutionalized and structural forms of
power and domination]{.underline}, such as those relating to sovereignty
and land in settler-colonial contexts.

### Essentialism Turn---2AC

#### Epistemic resistance to decolonial hierarchies gets [coopted]{.underline} in service of [neoliberalism]{.underline} and [ethno-nationalism]{.underline}.

**Zembylas, 25**---Professor of Educational Theory and Curriculum
Studies at the Open University of Cyprus (Michalinos, "Decolonial
pathways in education: Walter Mignolo, epistemic delinking, and the
risks of ethno-essentialism," Globalisation, Societies and Education,
February 3, 2025, DOI: 10.1080/14767724.2025.2459110, dml)

In recent years, many scholars in the field of education have engaged
with [the]{.underline} so called '**[decolonial turn]{.underline}**', a
movement that [seeks to challenge and dismantle the lingering colonial
structures and Eurocentric biases within **knowledge production** and
educational systems]{.underline} (e.g. see Andreotti et al.
Citation2015; Gaztambide-Fernández Citation2012; Shahjahan et al.
Citation2022; Stein Citation2023; Takayama, Sriprakash, and Connell
Citation2017; Tuck and Yang Citation2012; Zembylas Citation2021). This
decolonial perspective, which emerged from the critical work of thinkers
such as Walter Mignolo, Ramón Grosfoguel, [and]{.underline} Aníbal
Quijano, emphasises the need for 'decoloniality', or [the active undoing
of colonial **power structures** and **epistemic hierarchies** that
continue to marginalise non-Western **knowledges** and
**voices**]{.underline}. [These thinkers assert that it is
essential]{.underline} not only to reveal the pervasive coloniality in
various facets of social and political life, including education, but
also [to actively engage in **decolonising knowledge
production**]{.underline}. This engagement includes initiatives like
curriculum redesign, the decolonisation of research methodologies, and
institutional and policy changes aimed at fostering inclusivity
[and]{.underline} valuing diverse epistemic traditions.

One of the most widely cited figures of decolonial scholarship within
the field of education is the Argentinian (US-based) literacy critic and
philosopher Walter Mignolo (Citation2007, Citation2011, Citation2012,
Citation2021; Mignolo and Tlostanova Citation2008; Mignolo and Walsh
Citation2018). Mignolo's work has been deeply influential in developing
[a **framework** for understanding decolonisation as an **epistemic**
project]{.underline}, rather than solely as a political or territorial
one. His emphasis on 'epistemic decolonisation' draws attention to the
ways that coloniality shapes and limits knowledge production, framing
Western epistemologies as historically tied to colonial power
structures. By exploring these dimensions, Mignolo argues that true
decolonisation requires 'delinking' from dominant, Eurocentric ways of
knowing and instead centering local knowledge systems that have been
marginalised or suppressed under colonial rule. In this sense, Mignolo
advocates for the adoption of 'pluriversality', a concept that
highlights the value of multiple, diverse epistemic traditions in place
of a single, universalised Western perspective.

Mignolo's work has resonated strongly within the field of education
(e.g. see Golding Citation2017; Shahjahan and Morgan Citation2015;
Silova, Millei, and Piattoeva Citation2017; Zembylas Citation2023),
where scholars have applied his concepts to challenge the entrenched
colonial frameworks that shape educational structures, policies, and
curricula. By utilising Mignolo's notion of delinking, for example, some
of these [scholars advocate for alternative **epistemologies** and
**pedagogies** that break from Eurocentric traditions]{.underline}.
'Delinking', write Silova, Millei, and Piattoeva (Citation2017),
'challenges the 'emancipatory project' of modernity and colonial
relations and sets out to decolonise knowledge, thus interrupting
dominant understandings about the organisation of the world, society,
and education' (S75). In this sense, Mignolo's work has inspired efforts
to reframe knowledge production through localised, indigenous, and
marginalised perspectives, encouraging educators, scholars, and
educational systems to validate and incorporate these diverse knowledges
as essential components of curriculum redesign, research methodologies,
and institutional reform. This work advances the decolonial project
within education by paying close attention to the epistemic foundations
of decolonisation.

However, Mignolo's [exclusive focus on the **epistemic** aspects of
decolonisation]{.underline}, [along with]{.underline} his [**broad
claims** about the nature and impact of Western modernity and
coloniality]{.underline}, has attracted some criticism. Temin
(Citation2024), for example, argues that Mignolo's singular focus on the
epistemic dimensions of decolonisation 'frequently [**diminishes**
and/or **displaces** some of the more compelling dimensions of
anticolonial thought and decolonisation]{.underline} that have been
traced [in recent historiography]{.underline} and in fields such as
Indigenous and settler-colonial studies' (1). Also, Harruch
(Citation2024) contends that Mignolo's [**rejection** of modernity
and]{.underline} his **[generalising]{.underline}**,
[**de-historicised** approach that coloniality is **constitutive** of
modernity and vice versa rests on]{.underline} '[an **oversimplified**
conception of modernity]{.underline}' [as a Eurocentric civilisational
project]{.underline} -- [a conception that is]{.underline}
'[**theoretically flawed** and **politically pernicious**]{.underline}'
(251). Similarly Vickers (Citation2020) in the field of education has
critiqued claims made by some scholars who cite Mignolo that they rely
'on highly generalising claims regarding the nature and significance of
Western 'coloniality', uninformed by any balanced comparative analysis
of colonialism as a historical phenomenon' (166).

These criticisms turn our attention to some important distinctions
between decolonial theory and anticolonial thought and politics (Naicker
Citation2023). Anticolonialism is generally understood as an
intellectual and political endeavour aimed at exploring diverse forms of
resistance to colonialism and imperialism across the globe (Zembylas
Citation2024). Contrary to this understanding, [decolonial theory often
attributes coloniality **exclusively** to]{.underline} '**[the
West]{.underline}**' [as a **monolithic** source of
oppression]{.underline} (Naicker Citation2023). However, [this
**anti-Western reductionism**]{.underline}, points out Naicjer, [may
**fall short** in addressing the **complexities** of contemporary global
inequalities and injustices]{.underline}. More concerningly, [such
perspectives have]{.underline}, in some cases, [been **co-opted** by
authoritarian regimes]{.underline}, [such as those in **Russia** and
**India**]{.underline}, [to]{.underline} reinforce education policies
that subvert the ideals of equity and the recognition of marginalised
groups (Lewis and Lall Citation2024; Mochizuki Citation2023; Vickers
Citation2020). These regimes, write Lewis and Lall,

[capitalise on **grassroots** and **academic** calls for increased
freedom from **Western neoliberal hegemony**]{.underline}, linking to
and [**co-opting** the work of decolonial]{.underline} national
[philosophers who call for the empowerment of **local knowledge
producers** and the reinstatement of **traditional** ways of **being**
and **knowing**]{.underline} within these contexts. (2024, 1472)

Analysing recent development [in the **Indian**]{.underline} education
[landscape]{.underline}, Mochizuki (Citation2023, 2) shows how
[delinking strategies actually **undermine justice** and
**equality**]{.underline}, '[unwittingly or deliberately supporting
**exclusivist nationalism** and a **neoliberal agenda**]{.underline}'.
Similarly, Vickers laments that '[The neoliberal cadres of the **OECD**
or **World Bank**]{.underline}, [along with nationalist autocrats from
**Beijing** to **Budapest**]{.underline}, [will be **more than happy**
for]{.underline} '**[critical scholars]{.underline}**' [to fulminate
against a **vaguely-defined**]{.underline} '**[West]{.underline}**'
[while embracing]{.underline} '**[epistemological
diffidence]{.underline}**'' (2020, 184).

This article critically examines Walter Mignolo's influential framework
of 'epistemic decolonisation', particularly his concept of 'delinking'
from Western epistemologies. While Mignolo's approach has inspired
substantial decolonial scholarship in education, I argue that his
[emphasis on breaking away from Western knowledge systems can
**inadvertently lend itself** to ethno-essentialist and authoritarian
interpretations]{.underline}. I borrow the term
'**[ethno-essentialism]{.underline}**' from Naicker (Citation2023) to
[denote the **reduction** of diverse cultural and epistemological
practices to a **singular**]{.underline}, [**fixed** essence attributed
to a particular ethnic or cultural group]{.underline}. In this sense,
[one can speak about a]{.underline} '**[pure]{.underline}**'
[Afrocentric]{.underline}, [American-centric]{.underline}, [or other
**localised epistemology**]{.underline}, [framing them as **homogenous**
and **unchanging** rather than dynamic]{.underline},
[contested]{.underline}, [and plural]{.underline}. [By invoking a
**generalising** anti-Western rhetoric of]{.underline} '[returning to
**local roots**]{.underline}' [that draws on decolonial
arguments]{.underline}, I argue that [right-wing nationalist and
authoritarian regimes seek to **suppress** dissent and **delegitimise**
domestic critics in]{.underline} various [educational
settings]{.underline}. This dynamic raises critical questions about the
complexities and risks of implementing decolonial theory in different
political contexts.

### Essentialism Turn---1AR

#### Cooption is empirically proven.

**Zembylas, 25**---Professor of Educational Theory and Curriculum
Studies at the Open University of Cyprus (Michalinos, "Decolonial
pathways in education: Walter Mignolo, epistemic delinking, and the
risks of ethno-essentialism," Globalisation, Societies and Education,
February 3, 2025, DOI: 10.1080/14767724.2025.2459110, dml)

In this section, I discuss and analyse two recent publications in the
field of education that examine the implications of approaches that
advocate epistemic delinking from the West. The first is Lewis and
Lall's (Citation2024) investigation into how [right-wing nationalist
elites in Russia and India have **co-opted** the decolonial agenda
within]{.underline} higher [education]{.underline}. The second example
comes from Mochizuki (Citation2023), who critiques how [delinking
strategies]{.underline} in India [can be **appropriated** to undermine
equality and recognition for marginalised populations]{.underline},
thereby [reinforcing a **nationalist** and **neoliberal**
agenda]{.underline}. These examples were selected for two reasons:
first, they support the argument presented in this article; and second,
they both reference Mignolo's concept of delinking, examining its
implications for decolonisation efforts within their respective
contexts. In the following discussion, I will elaborate on each of these
articles and highlight the risks of ethno-essentialist claims that arise
from decolonisation efforts across various cultural and national
contexts.

Lewis and Lall (Citation2024) argue that [authoritarian leaders
like]{.underline} Vladimir **[Putin]{.underline}**, Narendra
**[Modi]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[Xi]{.underline}** Jinping
[**exploit** calls for decolonisation to **legitimise** their
anti-democratic reforms]{.underline}. [These leaders **co-opt** the
rhetoric of local intellectuals advocating for empowerment and the
**rejection of Western knowledge**]{.underline}, [framing their
authoritarian measures as **necessary** to resist Western
hegemony]{.underline}. As Lewis and Lall write:

[These leaders **capitalise** on grassroots and academic calls for
increased freedom from Western neoliberal hegemony]{.underline},
[**linking** to and **co-opting** the work of]{.underline} decolonial
national [philosophers who call for the empowerment of **local knowledge
producers** and the reinstatement of **traditional** ways of **being**
and **knowing**]{.underline} within these contexts. (2024, 1472)

[This appropriation **undermines** grassroots movements and
**suppresses** dissent]{.underline}, [as universities become
**complicit** in promoting government narratives and silencing critiques
through various repressive tactics]{.underline}. Lewis and Lall's
analysis show that [while decolonisation aims to amplify diverse
voices]{.underline}, [authoritarian regimes have **distorted** this
discourse to **stifle** opposition]{.underline}, [**reinforcing** power
dynamics and discrimination against minorities]{.underline}. Ultimately,
this dynamic illustrates the challenges faced by decolonial efforts in
contexts where democratic institutions are eroding, particularly in
India and Russia. As Lewis and Lall explain further:

\[T\]he weakening of democratic institutions in India and Russia, which
reinforces [the infringements of rights and freedom]{.underline} of
expression, [is **legitimised** through association with
**over-simplified** decolonial ideas]{.underline}, [where to **shut down
critiques** of the regimes in power]{.underline}, [authoritarianism
accuses **Western liberal thought** of creating the ills of a
globalising world]{.underline}. Universities are made to toe this line
(willingly or unwillingly) through various repressive tactics, such as
political appointments, curriculum reform, control of finances, policing
of students, and dismissal or arrests of staff. (2024, 1472)

In particular, Lewis and Lall (Citation2024) mention Mignolo's concept
of decolonial de-linking as an example of how anti-Western discourse can
be potentially co-opted within Russia and India's nationalist
frameworks. However, unlike Hull (Citation2022), who highlights only the
dangers of ethno-nationalism in decolonial theory, Lewis and Lall
provide a more balanced critique and argue that Mignolo's work is 'far
more nuanced than anti-Westernist co-option indicates' (2024, 1475).
They underscore that while both decolonialism and Eurasianism critique
modernity, they differ in their receptiveness to pluralism:
decolonialism promotes diverse dialogue and self-critique, whereas
Eurasianism, especially within Russian state structures, stifles dissent
and advocates a Russo-centric model aligned with state authority. This
distinction reinforces my earlier argument that anti-Western rhetoric in
decolonial theory cannot be simply equated with decoloniality itself.
However, it also serves as a critical reminder for education scholars to
examine how their [theoretical frameworks might be **appropriated** or
**misinterpreted** in ways that]{.underline} can support nationalist or
exclusionary agendas, underscoring the need for vigilance in contexts
where anti-Western sentiments may be mobilised for repressive purposes.

In the second example, Mochizuki (Citation2023) illustrates how
delinking strategies in education could [**unintentionally** or
**strategically** serve nationalist and neoliberal agendas]{.underline},
undermining the goals of inclusion and equality. His analysis highlights
the complexities of implementing decolonial frameworks in India's
educational system and suggests that there is a need for approaches that
mitigate potential misuse of decolonial concepts in education. In
particular, the author examines India's new National Education Policy,
which entails the agenda of the ruling nationalist party for
dewesternization. This policy, points out Mochizuki, echoes the
sentiment that India has suffered from 'the colonial matrix of power'
and now it is the time to break from that. The author warns though that
the efforts to decolonise India's education 'must not be reduced to
positing a simplistic West--East/North--South/White-Nonwhite dichotomy'
(Citation2023, 14). This binary framing, according to Mochizuki, casts
India as either uniformly oppressed by Western forces (from a decolonial
view) or as a monolithic, irrational, and religious society (from a
modernist/colonialist view). A more nuanced approach is needed, argues
Mochizuki, one that recognises the need for epistemic discontinuity with
the colonial past, yet one that does not buy into simplistic and
superficial arguments of decolonisation.

All in all, both of these publications emphasise that [when nationalist
agendas **co-opt** decolonialism]{.underline}, [they **strip** it of its
critical complexity and turn it into a tool for **reinforcing** national
power structures]{.underline}, [rather than **questioning** hierarchical
knowledge systems]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} co-opted version of
decolonialism [**superficially opposes** Western influence but
**avoids** engaging with **nuanced critiques** of power dynamics and
social inequalities]{.underline}. Instead, [decolonial principles are
**reshaped** to support **exclusionary**]{.underline}, [**nationalist**
identities]{.underline}, [often **sidelining** minority voices that
challenge the singular national narrative]{.underline}. [In countries
like India and Russia]{.underline}, as shown in these articles,
[de-linking from Western academic discourse is used to justify policies
that **suppress dissent** by categorising certain critiques
as]{.underline} '**[Western-influenced]{.underline}**' and therefore
undesirable. [These actions **serve nationalist objectives** by
promoting a **homogenous** national identity]{.underline} based on
state-defined 'traditional' values, [while **silencing** diverse
perspectives]{.underline} within the nation. Universities, for example,
are targeted as potential sources of Western thought or critical views,
leading to restricted academic freedom (Dillabough Citation2022; Rubin
and Bose Citation2023). [This creates an environment where]{.underline}
students and [academics who **question**]{.underline} the current
administrations [face **limited avenues** for open debate]{.underline}.
Consequently, the co-opted decolonial discourse diminishes the
democratic and pluralistic ideals it originally sought to promote,
instead entrenching authoritarian governance under the guise of
protecting national identity.

### Harm Reduction---2AC

#### [Harm reduction]{.underline} means extinction [outweighs]{.underline}---things can always get [worse]{.underline}.

**van der Lugt, 25**---lecturer in philosophy at the University of St
Andrews (Mara, "Radical Hope Revisited," *Hopeful Pessimism*, Chapter 5,
pp. 113-114, dml)

For my part, I believe it is worth preserving a considerable distance
between radical hope and other hopes---and to reserve the former for
situations that involve the kind of extreme normative disorientation and
cultural collapse experienced by the Crow. Again, as Charles Taylor has
pointed out, it is not at all clear whether this is an experience
available to us in the modern globalised world, where the majority of
people don't have as narrow a conception of the good as was available to
a warrior culture. It is true that, as several authors have recently
argued, the ongoing development of the climate crisis may involve a
level of disorientation and conceptual loss, precisely because this
crisis has the potential of engendering a future so vastly diferent as
to make the lives of our descendants ungraspable to us--- and, perhaps,
to them. But even if it were possible to predict such eventual
disorientation, it does not follow that radical hope would be the right
response for us now. In fact, [we could easily imagine]{.underline}
radical [**hope** as being the **wrong** response]{.underline} entirely.
For instance, [there are [those who believe]{.mark}]{.underline}, with
great subjective conviction, [that the fight against]{.underline}
climate [catastrophe has **already been lost**]{.underline}, [and
instead of continuing the struggle [we should]{.mark}]{.underline}
'[**[accept]{.mark}** that [disaster]{.mark} is coming]{.underline},
[and begin to rethink what it means to have hope]{.underline}'; that
'we're doomed' [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} should '[[learn to
**die**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Anthropocene.'66

If a case might (tenuously) be made that such gestures of radical
resignation are also manifestations of radical hope---to the extent that
they see the crisis as insurmountable and seek diferent outlets for
virtuous action67---a case can also be made that [such responses
[are]{.mark} **deeply [misguided]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is, first
and foremost, because [they **misunderstand** the nature of the
problem]{.underline} posed by climate change. Unlike one-off disasters
like meteors falling on earth---which is the incredibly unhelpful but
stubbornly persistent metaphor for the climate crisis---the latter is
not the kind of catastrophe that is immediate or total. [[Barring
**complete extinction**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[the
fight]{.underline}]{.mark} against climate change '**[[will never be
lost]{.underline}]{.mark}**,' to repeat the words of David
Wallace-Wells---' because however warm the planet gets, [it will
**always** be the case that [the decade that follows could contain
**more suffering** or **less**]{.mark}]{.underline}.'68

This is the great but wholly unappreciated risk of 'now or never'
narratives, repeated across the board by the staunchest advocates of
climate action, who fail to realise that while the 'now' of the slogan
is justified, the 'never' is not. [While it is crucially important to
emphasise the importance of **acting now**]{.underline}--- [because
actions taken in this decade have a greater ability to **prevent
catastrophic suffering** than actions in later ones]{.underline}---[this
**does not mean** that if we do not act **now**]{.underline}, [we can
rest by acting **never**]{.underline}. [Even if]{.underline} climate
[**targets** come and go]{.underline}, [even if **deadlines** are missed
and]{.underline} political [**promises** broken]{.underline}, [even
after **points of no return** are passed]{.underline}, [we]{.underline}
will [still have reason to continue to **do what we can**]{.underline},
[because the [disaster is **not**]{.mark}]{.underline} one that is
[[**ever complete** and it is our duty to **prevent what suffering we
can**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [To opt for
**[resignation]{.mark}**]{.underline} in this context [is to [opt for
**other people suffering** for]{.mark} **decades**]{.underline}, [even
[**centuries** to come]{.mark}]{.underline}---which is not a decision
that can be made undemocratically, if it can be made at all.69

'And [no matter how dark things may become]{.underline}, [giving up will
**never be an option**]{.underline},' Thunberg reminds us. 'Because
[every **fraction**]{.underline} of a degree and every tonne of carbon
dioxide [will **always matter**]{.underline}. [It will **never be too
late** for us to save **as much as we can possibly
save**]{.underline}.'70 If anything, then, the slogan for climate
activism should not be 'now or never' but 'now---and forever.'

### Internal Link Defense---2AC

#### Their impact claims oversimplify. Colonial epistemologies lack [causal force]{.underline}.

**Naicker, 23**---postdoctoral researcher at the Centre for the Study of
the Afterlife of Violence and the Reparative Quest at Stellenbosch
University (Veeran, "The problem of epistemological critique in
contemporary Decolonial theory," Social Dynamics, Volume 49, Issue 2,
pp. 220-241, dml)

The emergence of Decolonial theory can be traced back to its seminal
publication, Aníbal Quijano's Citation(1991) 2010 essay, "Coloniality
and Modernity/Rationality." As a theoretical movement, Decolonial theory
was constituted by a group of South American diasporic thinkers located
within elite North American Universities. Originally, Decolonial theory
addressed a colonial or racialised global political economy from within
"world systems theory, development and underdevelopment theory and the
Frankfurt school critical theory tradition" (Bhambra Citation2014, 115).
In the last thirty years, the concerns articulated by the "Latin
American Subaltern studies" group, which are rooted in the conceptual
relationship between coloniality/modernity and rationality, have become
transnational. As Decolonial theory has travelled, its focus as a global
theoretical movement has been transformed. Prominent
[scholars]{.underline} such as Sabelo Ndlovu-Gatsheni, Walter Mignolo,
Catherine Walsh and Ramón Grosfoguel [have refashioned Decolonial theory
as **primarily**]{.underline} an **[epistemological]{.underline}** form
of criticism (Hull Citation2021, 67). What is [distinctive]{.underline}
about contemporary decolonial criticism [is the proposal that
colonisation should be reconceptualised as **primarily epistemic
violence**]{.underline}, [and that epistemic violence is **equivalent**
to the institutional dominance of Western secular knowledge over other
epistemologies]{.underline}, which Decolonial theory has falsely
conceptualised as cosmological modes of knowing and being. The latter
are then disqualified as folklore, witchcraft and mysticism. The core of
this argument is that the secular modern West has presented itself as
the only epistemic tradition capable of attaining truth or
objective/universal knowledge. [Decolonial theorists argue that **all**
Western knowledge is reducible to the **ego conquiro**]{.underline},
[which signifies the]{.underline} certainty of the
[European]{.underline} in his role [as **conqueror**]{.underline} over
the colonised. In this framework, [Western]{.underline} secular
[knowledge is defined by a **singular conspiratorial will**]{.underline}
or intention [to **dominate** all other forms of being]{.underline} by
excluding them from contributing to or being part of, hegemonic
discourses on humans. Reconfiguring colonialism as an epistemological
problem has enabled Decolonial theory to differentiate itself and claim
superiority over political economy (Marxism) and postcolonialism --
paradigms to which its scholars were, at one point, beholden (Grosfoguel
Citation2011). The consequences of this shift are two-fold. First,
decolonial thinkers located within the Humanities and the Social
Sciences claim that Universities are colonial institutions,
necessitating a call for the decolonialisation of institutional
structures and curriculum. Second, [Decolonial theory claims that the
coloniality of modern Western epistemology]{.underline} embodied in the
curriculum [is]{.underline} both 1) a symptom of our inability to solve
the contemporary crises and 2) [the **cause** of our civilisational
crises]{.underline}. This controversial notion, articulated in the work
of the most ambitious and influential decolonial thinker in Sub-Saharan
Africa, Sabelo Ndlovu-Gatsheni, goes as far as to argue that: The
current environmental/ecological crises rocking the modern world are
another indicator of the epistemic crisis as well as the systemic crises
that remind us of the catastrophic failures and vulnerabilities of the
modern world system that has been caught off guard. What the world is
facing is a broad "civilizational crisis" which loudly proclaims that
modernity has produced many modern problems for which it has no modern
solutions. Consequently, it would be naïve for peoples of the Global
South in general, and Africa in particular, to continue looking to
Europe and North America for usable knowledge, relevant ideas, critical
theories and solutions to modern problems. (Ndlovu-Gatsheni
Citation2018, 38)

[Blaming the modern]{.underline} "**[West]{.underline}**" [for being
**solely responsible** for planetary crises]{.underline} that illumine
the mortality and immorality of our species [is]{.underline}, of course,
[not novel]{.underline}. [I am **not** suggesting the
crises]{.underline} mentioned above and elaborated upon by
Ndlovu-Gatsheni [are **illusory**]{.underline}. On the contrary, I argue
that [the]{.underline} ecological, economic, gender-based violence and
racial [crises of our time are **factually indisputable**]{.underline},
[but]{.underline} Decolonial theory's [**anti-Western theoretical
reductionism** is **inadequate** for addressing the
problems]{.underline} faced by the contemporary precariat. Today, in
[the age of the Anthropocene]{.underline}, precarity [is **no longer
reducible** to **racial inequality** or]{.underline} the effects of
"**[coloniality]{.underline}**." Reconceptualised as a geological force
or biomass, Achille Mbembe (Citation2017) has argued, the human species
exceeds the demand and capacity of the labour market, engendering
surplus populations that have begun to replicate the precarity and
object-like character of the racialised slaves and colonised in early
modernity. However, the matter is not as straightforward as the binaries
of class and race struggles that defined modes of resistance against
exploitation and oppression until the mid-twentieth century. The tragedy
of our times is that the global precariat signifies an abandoned excess,
superfluous subalterns who are not required for capital to function
(Mbembe Citation2017, 9). More importantly, Mbembe argues the human
population as a geological force has the capacity to not only alter but
destroy the ecological conditions (or eco-systems) on planet earth that
make human habitation possible. In the context of an emergent and
all-encompassing planetary extinction, the precarity once reserved for
the enslaved and colonised black subject becomes a global condition
(Mbembe Citation2017, 1--9; Reyes and Chirindo Citation2020, 7--8).

[This]{.underline} article [is not a **defence** of
colonialism]{.underline}, exploitation or inhumane, naturalistic
hierarchies. [On the **contrary**]{.underline}, I am arguing that
Decolonial theory's [**stereotypical reduction** of the complex
political relations that constitute our contemporary milieu is
**ineffectual** for engaging with]{.underline} the [reality]{.underline}
of contemporary precarity. Despite its supposed constructivism, I
demonstrate in this article that the geo-political rendering of
standpoint theory and the locus of enunciation amounts to a simple
inversion of colonial stereotypes, meaning that [its practitioners are
beholden to an **essentialist conception** of racialised
morality]{.underline}. Furthermore, [this **inversion** of a racialised
colonial morality]{.underline}, [in terms of a **binary distinction**
between indigenous subaltern epistemology as morally good and all
secular Western epistemology as morally evil]{.underline}, signified by
the notion of ego conquiro, [unwittingly continues to adopt the moral
and epistemological norms of **colonial discourse**]{.underline}. I will
demonstrate that Decolonial theory's thesis on the geo-politics of
knowledge, expressed through two concepts, epistemic violence and the
colonial difference, is equivalent to an an ethno-essentialist claim
about how knowledge is produced with an uncritical moralising impulse
(Hull Citation2022).

### Land Focus=Bad---2AC

#### Focusing on the intrinsic connection between Indigeneity and land is [inaccurate]{.underline} at best and [recolonizing]{.underline} at worst.

**Konishi, 19**---Senior Lecturer in the School of Humanities at the
University of Western Australia, Yawuru (Shino, "First Nations Scholars,
Settler Colonial Studies, and Indigenous History," Australian Historical
Studies, 50:3, 285-304, dml)

In her 2010 essay Yamatji scholar Crystal McKinnon acknowledges that
land, as a 'geographical space', is 'central' to the settler colonial
project, and like MoretonRobinson she emphasises the way in which
'Indigenous people have survived despite an often relentless onslaught
from invading colonial forces'. However, [[rather than focusing
on]{.mark} ongoing attachments and connections to **[physical
country]{.mark}**]{.underline} as Moreton-Robinson does, [McKinnon
instead explores the]{.underline} '[reclamation and creation of **social
spaces** through which an autonomous sense of Indigeneity can
be]{.underline} created, continued and [expressed]{.underline}'. Arguing
that [[the endurance of]{.mark} such [social spaces has
been]{.mark}]{.underline} '[**[underexamined]{.underline}**']{.mark},
she contends that [it is **[through such spaces]{.mark}**
that]{.underline} '[[Indigenous cultures]{.mark} and identities [have
**fought displacement** and
**assimilation**]{.mark}]{.underline}[']{.mark}. 34 She rejects
'[[claims that autonomous Indigenous spaces within]{.mark} a
[settler]{.mark} colonial [society **cannot
exist**]{.mark}]{.underline}[']{.mark} because they
'[[only]{.underline}]{.mark} serve to
**[[recolonise]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [everyday [lived
experiences]{.mark}]{.underline} of Indigenous individuals'
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} '[[appear]{.underline}]{.mark} to be
[[focussed on the **structural** and **geographical nature** of settler
colonialism]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and [forget the **social** and
**cultural elements**]{.mark} and the **lived experiences** of the
people themselves]{.underline}'. 35

Significantly, McKinnon reminds us that [settler colonial arguments
about territoriality focus on geographic space and **overlook** the ways
in which spaces are also socially and culturally
constituted]{.underline}. She suggests that [[Indigenous spaces may
be]{.underline}]{.mark} '[**[interstitial]{.underline}**']{.mark}
[[and]{.mark} are often [construed]{.mark}]{.underline} by the
mainstream [[as]{.underline}]{.mark}
'[**[marginal]{.underline}**']{.mark}, perhaps spaces deemed
[[**undesirable** or **inconsequential**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[Yet]{.underline}]{.mark} McKinnon insists that [[for]{.mark} the
Indigenous [occupants]{.mark}]{.underline} '[[these]{.mark} spaces
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} indeed **[[not]{.underline}]{.mark}**
"[[marginal]{.underline}]{.mark}" [[at all]{.underline}]{.mark}. They
are spaces in which we exist and live everyday -- they are normalised
spaces'. [[Such]{.underline}]{.mark} '[marginal]{.underline}' [[spaces
offer]{.underline}]{.mark} '[**[privacy]{.underline}**']{.mark}.
[[They]{.underline}]{.mark} '[[allow identity]{.mark} and culture [to be
**nourished** and]{.mark} **maintained** or [politics and ideology to be
**shared** and **expressed**]{.mark}]{.underline}[']{.mark}, and provide
places where 'Indigenous peoples hold community gatherings, concerts,
meetings, celebrations, mourning or reunions'. 36 Her argument is
illustrated by a number of historical studies including The Coolbaroo
Club, written by Miriwoong researcher Steve Kinnane, Lauren Marsh and
Roger Scholes, which examined the Aboriginal-run Perth dance club where
Noongar and other Aboriginal people gathered from the 1940s to 1960s
despite living in 'apartheid like' conditions.37

McKinnon's arguments are complemented by Pitjantjatjara Indigenous
Social Research professor Barry Judd's 'Sporting Intervention: The
Northern Territory National Emergency Response and Papunya Football'
(2017). Judd considers the racialised tensions of central Australian
football in terms of settler colonialism, arguing that settlers'
historically 'insatiable desire to acquire land' was 'rendered rational
and natural by a simultaneous discursive elimination of Indigenous
people'. He argues that racist othering served to 'de-humanise, displace
and ultimately disremember' Indigenous people, and that Anglo-Australian
nationalism demanded the 'discursive elimination' of Aboriginal people
'from narratives of national identity'. 38 Despite the 'progressive
politics of 1967--1996' which enacted 'profound change' for the Luritja
and Pintupi peoples of Papunya, and saw 'a flourishing of cultural
output and a reassertion of Indigenous identity', Judd argues that the
2007 Intervention reignited and revalidated a discursive othering. In
terms of local sport, this was manifested in the largely nonIndigenous
hostility towards Papunya teams and spectators visiting Alice Springs
for the Central Australian Football League matches.39

Yet, like McKinnon and Moreton-Robinson, Judd argues that Papunya
peoples resisted and evaded this reprisal of 'discursive elimination'.
Instead they formed their own Wilurarra Tjutaku Football League (WTFL),
which is not just a separate competition, but more significantly
reflects a distinct style of game: 'On Country' football. Judd explains
that 'On Country' football reflects Papunya customs and values: there is
minimal touching and body contact, style of play is prioritised over
winning, stress is placed on the importance of family, scores are not
kept but instead 'negotiated by Elders', and 'prize monies \[are\]
distributed in such a way that all teams win' to ensure that all players
can '"save face"'. 40 Thus Judd concludes that while the Intervention
made older eliminationist discourses 'socially permissible and
politically viable' again, the creation of the WTFL represents the way
in which Aboriginal people could 'disengage from Anglo-Australia by
deciding to go their own way'. 41 McKinnon would read [this]{.underline}
as carving out a separate social space which allows their identity to
flourish. While both McKinnon and Judd draw on settler colonial
[theory]{.underline}, they ultimately [present the logic of elimination
as an **enduring** or **intermittent** settler colonial desire rather
than an **overriding structure**]{.underline}. Instead [they emphasise
**Indigenous agency**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} like
Moreton-Robinson [articulate **more optimistic narratives** of
Indigenous]{.underline} cultural and social [**resistance**
to]{.underline} '**[discursive elimination]{.underline}**' [and a
**flourishing reassertion** of Indigenous identity]{.underline}. Both
McKinnon and Judd depict Indigenous identity as enduring, highlighting
different ways in which [Indigenous people **resisted** and **evaded**
assimilation]{.underline}, [and sustained **distinct political
identities**]{.underline}.

#### This is [offense]{.underline}---their paradigm creates [new]{.underline} colonial endeavors. 

**Sharma, 15**---Director, International Cultural Studies Program,
University of Hawai'i Manoa (Nandita, "Strategic Anti-Essentialism:
Decolonizing Decolonization," *Sylvia Wynter: Being Human as Praxis*,
Chapter 7, pg 170-176, dml) \["nos"=Latin for "we"/"us"\]

Emerging in the post--World War II era, [indigeneity is a **relatively
recent mode** of representation]{.underline}, one [that encompasses
**very diverse people**]{.underline} across the Americas, indeed
**[across the world]{.underline}**, often [under a **single**, **shared
subjective understanding** of being the "**first**" to live in any
particular place]{.underline}.22 Being indigenous is a form of co-
identification among people who previously did not see any connection
with one another. It is also a way of laying claim to particular lands
(or, more accurately, territories) on the basis of having (or having
once had) specialized knowledge of that place. Yet, [this mode of
representation, however new or potentially expansive, **remains
particularistic**]{.underline}. Indigeneity is a form of subjectivity
that emerged because of the devastation wrought in the aftermath of
1492. Moreover, it is a form of subjectivity that interpellates people
into efforts to gain national sovereignty within the global system of
national states. Indigenous, then, as a mode of representation includes
the often unacknowledged elision between native as a colonial state
category of subjugation and indigenous as a category of resistance.

[Indigenous conceptualized as such retains]{.underline} two
[**interrelated problems** that ensure that]{.underline} the kinds of
**[unequal relationships]{.underline}** organized in the aftermath of
1492 [are **reproduced**]{.underline}. First, [by [**denying the social
constitution** of the category of indigenous]{.mark}, it **disavows**
people's now-long **history of connectivity** across (and sometimes
against) this category. Because this connectivity **challenges the
particularistic nature** of indigeneity, recognition of
interrelationality is **itself represented as a threat**]{.underline}.
Second, [by continuing to **limit the criteria of
membership**]{.underline} of each nos, [each is **unable to accept as
co-specifics** those who are rendered as **always-already oppositional
others**]{.underline}. Indeed, [in **making any particularistic nos**,
the significance of omitting certain others **cannot be
underestimated**]{.underline}.

[The category of indigenous]{.underline}, thus, [does]{.underline} a
sort of [**political work**. It [produces]{.mark} a **particular
nos**]{.underline} ([and thus a **particular Other-to-indigenous
nos**]{.underline}).23 For some (though certainly not all) of those
currently constituted as indigenous, it seems that one of the
consequences of the enormously uneven Columbian exchange is the
denunciation of the process of exchange itself. Today, the movement of
life, plants, humans, and other animals is often cited as the cause for
the devastation wrought on their native equivalent.24 Rather than focus
on the hierarchical and exploitative relations of the Columbian
exchange, some assume that the cause of the problem was / is mobility
itself. [Within such a worldview, that which **moves** is consequently
denounced as **inherently polluting**, and]{.underline}, in an idiom
that is gaining in popularity, [**movement** and **migration** are
posited as **inherently colonizing**]{.underline}.

[[An understanding]{.mark} of [mobility as **always colonizing**]{.mark}
is evident in the expansion of the term "**settler colonist**" to
include **all those deemed nonnative** in any given space]{.underline}.
Recently, within both indigenous studies and social movements for
indigenous rights, [the [**historical distinctions**
between]{.mark}]{.underline} the voyages of Columbus (and other
**[[colonizers]{.underline}]{.mark}**) and those of
**[[slaves]{.underline}]{.mark}** who survived the Middle Passage,
**[indentured [workers]{.mark}]{.underline}** recruited in the wake of
slavery's abolition, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} present- day
**[[migrants]{.underline}]{.mark}** captured in a variety of state
categories ranging from illegal to immigrant, [have been
**[collapsed]{.mark}**. **All**, it is claimed, are **agents of
colonialism**]{.underline}. It seems, then, that as there has been an
expansion in the subjective understanding of people as indigenous, there
has been a subsequent expansion in their other. Put differently, [within
some indigenous systems of belonging, all past and present people
constituted as migrants are **situated as colonizers**]{.underline}.

In our present "great age" of migration, how did "colonizer" become a
meaningful way to describe people who move across space?25 Indeed, how
did "colonizer" come to be an increasingly dominant mode of representing
indigenous people's others, others who were once understood as
cocolonized people or, at least, not as an oppositional other? Is there
a relationship between these particularistic modes of representation and
the false separation and hierarchical ranking of different but related
experiences of colonization, such as the processes of expropriation and
people's displacement across space?

The answers to these questions lie within the logics of autochthonous
systems of representation and the ways in which claims to indigeneity
bring to life discourses of alienness or foreignness. Jean Comaroff and
John Comaroff argue, [[by]{.mark} "**[elevating to a
first-principle]{.mark}** the **[ineffable]{.mark} interests** and
**[connections]{.mark}**]{.underline}, at once material and moral,
[[that flow from]{.mark} '**native**' rootedness, and **special
rights**, in a **[place]{.mark} of birth**,"]{.underline} autochthonous
[discourses place those constituted as natives **at the top** of a
**hierarchy** of the **exploited**, **oppressed**, and **colonized** and
**insist** on the **centrality** of the **claims of natives** for the
realization of either **decolonization** or **justice**]{.underline}.26
Within the negative duality of natives and nonnatives that such
discourses put into play, **[[origins]{.underline}]{.mark}** (and, in
some contexts, claims of original, versus later, human discovery or
inhabitation) [[become the **key determinant of who belongs**]{.mark} in
any given space today---and **who does not**]{.underline}.

The quintessential alien or foreigner within autochthonous discourses is
the figure of the migrant. This is because the hegemonic understanding
of what it means to be a migrant in today's world is one where migration
is seen as movement away from one's native land. Thus, migrants come to
stand as the ultimate nonnative. [Such a move works to **shift the
focus** from a dialectics of **colonialism**---where the **key
historical dynamic** is one of **expropriation** and
**exploitation**]{.underline}, and the key relationship is one between
the colonizers and the colonized---[to one where the **dichotomy between
native** and **nonnative becomes central** to both **analysis** and
**politics**]{.underline}. Patrick **[Wolfe]{.underline}**, a historian
of Australia, [captures this]{.underline} perspective [well in his claim
that "the **fundamental social divide** is]{.underline} not
[the]{.underline} color **[line]{.underline}**. It is not ethnicity,
minority status, or even class. The primary line is the one
[**distinguishing Natives from settlers**---that is, **from everyone
else**. **Only the Native is not a settler**]{.underline}. Only the
Native is truly local. Only the Native will free the Native. [One is
**either native** or **not**."]{.underline}27

From such an autochthonous perspective, being native is both spatially
and temporally dependent. Temporally, migrants may be identified as
natives at some point in time and in some given space, but once having
moved away from the spaces where such representations may be claimed,
they become nonnatives. Spatially, migrants remain native but only to
the places they no longer live in. Thus, some argue that migrants can
continue to claim native rights to places they have moved from if they
are able to show genealogical descendance from those with native status
in that space.28 Candace Fujikane, in dismissing Asian claims to belong
in the United States, puts it this way: "Indigenous people are
differentiated from settlers by their genealogical, familial
relationship with specific land bases that are ancestors to them. One is
either indigenous to a particular land base or one is not. Asian
Americans are undeniably settlers in the United States because we cannot
claim any genealogy to the land we occupy, no matter how many lifetimes
Asian settlers work on the land, or how many Asian immigrants have been
killed through racist persecution and hate crimes, or how brutal the
political or colonial regimes that occasioned Asians' exodus from their
homelands."29

[In this logic, indigeneity is **racialized/ethnicized**, and in the
process, **land**]{.underline}---or more accurately, territory---[is as
well. Natives, it is assumed, belong in "**their**" native land and
**only there**]{.underline}. Further, [[who can be]{.mark} recognized as
[native is **dependent upon ancestry**]{.mark}, thereby [**adding
blood** to the **discourse of soil**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Descent
becomes of further importance in this distinction, for many indigenous
people are, of course, also Asian (and European and African and so on)
as well as vice versa. [It is one's **ability to claim some indigenous
ancestor** that can allow one to be **seen as indigenous** today. While
[such claims]{.mark} can be **social** and not **biological**, many
indigenous groups]{.underline}, following from certain governments' own
categorical recognition of indigeneity, [[rely on]{.mark} some form of
[**blood quantum** rule]{.mark}]{.underline} that requires a minimal
indigenous lineage. Not surprisingly, [such criteria for
belonging]{.underline} (and for the rights and entitlements of
membership) [**have not always worked** for those subordinated through
**other axes of oppression** and **exploitation**]{.underline}. Thus,
[**many women** have found that their claims to native status are often
the **first to be discounted**]{.underline}.30

In this, [[there is]{.mark} an **ironic [historical continuity]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark}]{.underline} autochthonous ideas and practices of belonging
and [the **underlying [logics]{.mark}** [of the
**colonial**]{.mark}]{.underline} (and, in some places, postcolonial)
**[state]{.underline}**. Indeed, [the meaning of native was one that was
used to **distinguish the colonized** from the **colonizer** so that the
natives could be **represented as less human** and]{.underline},
therefore, [as **legitimately colonized**]{.underline}. Being native,
then, was a signifier of being colonized and the ultimate signifier of
abjectness. [Nativeness as a mode of representation]{.underline}, then,
[was designed to **institutionalize the new racist orders** implemented
by different colonial empires]{.underline}. Importantly, all colonized
people were variously identified as "the" natives in order to signal
their lack of membership in the propter nos of the colonizers.31

In the post--World War II era of postcolonialism, when, through much
struggle, colonial empires were removed from the list of legitimate
forms of political rule, the right to claim rights within and to any
given space came, increasingly, to be seen as belonging to "the"
natives. After all, we were told, the anticolonial project was often
posited as fighting for the rule of the natives for the natives. Not
surprisingly, then, the battle over resources and over place has, thus,
increasingly become one about the meaning of nativeness.

In this way, autochthonous modes of belonging are significant in
advancing particular nationalized regimes of rights, for the national
subject is often defined through an exclusive racialized / ethnicized
criteria through which political rights and rights to property,
especially social property rights in land and natural resources, are to
be apportioned within any claimed national space. Contemporary,
postcolonial forms of racism are often based on ideas of autochthony.
All those who are said to have migrated to the places where they live
(or who cannot prove their prior inhabitance) are increasingly viewed as
agents of (instead of co- victims of) colonial projects. The ruling
ideology of nationalism has provided an explanation for belonging and
has come to be a key way to distinguish between who is properly native
to any given place and who is not. Today, the rhetoric of autochthony is
evident throughout the world, including diverse sites in Europe,
southern Africa, Central Africa, Latin America, North America, and the
Pacific. Significantly, such a discourse spans the political spectrum
from the Right to the Left. Here, I focus on the emergence of
autochthonous discourses in indigenous nationalist politics (engaged in
by both natives and nonnatives) in the territories claimed by Canada and
the United States, with a particular focus on the Hawaiian archipelago,
where this discourse is well rehearsed.

The position that all migrants are settler colonists has been advanced
in a number of recent scholarly works in Canada and the United States.
In the context of Hawai'i, it has been argued that "Asians" in Hawai'i
(most of whom are the descendants of contractually indentured plantation
laborers who began arriving in the mid- 1800s) are "settler colonists,"
active in the colonization of native Hawaiians due to their nonnative
status.32 The main distinction between the two groups, they argue, is
that native Hawaiian claims are based on rights of national sovereignty
over "their land, water, and other economic and legal rights," while
Asians, because they are not native, have no right to make such
claims.33

In a Canadian context, Bonita Lawrence's and Enakshi Dua's article
"Decolonizing Antiracism" (2005) in Social Justice makes some of the
same arguments made by the contributors to the special issue of Amerasia
Journal on "Asian Settler Colonialism in Hawai'i."34 Like them, Lawrence
and Dua also focus on those nonnatives who are nonwhite. They contend
that the antiracist praxis of nonwhites has "contribute\[d\] to the
active colonization of Aboriginal peoples."35 Indeed, they contend that
"antiracism is premised on an ongoing colonial project" and on "a
colonizing social formation."36 Postcolonial critiques of national
liberation strategies, social constructivist critiques of the
naturalness of races or nations, and arguments against ethnic
absolutism, such as those made by Stuart Hall, become, for them,
examples of how antiracism is a colonial practice.37 Lawrence and Dua
maintain that these kinds of analyses colonize indigenous people by
"contribut\[ing\] to the ongoing delegitimization of Indigenous
nationhood."38

In these essays, then, critiques of nationalisms or of the
naturalization of social categories are tantamount to attacks against
indigenous people. It is in such assertions that we can find the
ideological character of autochthonous discourses. In arguing for the
theoretical and political centrality of nativeness, there is an effort
to depoliticize native nationalisms. By insisting that any critique of
nationalism is tantamount to a colonial practice, the nationalist
assumptions and politics of native nationalisms are taken out of the
realm of that which can be contested. Consequently, native nationalisms
are posited as the only strategy for decolonization.

It is precisely the nationalism inherent within autochthonous discourses
that helps to explain not only why all nonnatives are conceptualized as
colonizers but also why the (varied) critics of nationalism (or those
who argue for the social basis for ideas of race and ethnic purity, or
those who uncover a politics of solidarity across such lines) are also
colonizers. Negatively racialized persons, in this logic of nationalized
self- determinacy, are relegated to being mere minorities of various
nations and their existing or hoped- for national sovereign states.
Thus, because they are not a people / nation as defined by hegemonic
doctrines of self- determinancy, Asians, for example, in Hawai'i, or
elsewhere in the United States and Canada, are represented as not-
colonized and, therefore, in the dualistic mode of autochthonous
representations, as colonizers.

Within autochthonous discourses [one **can only be colonized** if they
"**belong**" or are **indigenous** to that space itself]{.underline}. In
this view, [the [colonization]{.mark} that people experience [supposedly
**ends** once one **moves away**]{.mark} from the colony]{.underline}
(or, now, the postcolony). Instead, [these migrants come to be
**represented as colonizers**. Because a **key aspect** of the
subjective understanding of indigenous is being a colonized person,
[**only other colonized persons** can be]{.mark} seen to be
**[co-specifics]{.mark}**. Neither those **constituted as
[migrants]{.mark}** nor their **struggles** can be perceived as **part
of anticolonial struggles**]{.underline}. As such, [they **[cannot be
included as commensurate human beings]{.mark}** within any colonial or
postcolonial space.]{.underline}

[[This]{.mark} view imagines the space of colonialism as **finite**. It
**fails to see the broader field of power** that processes of
colonialism opened up]{.underline}. More specifically, [it **fails to
see migration** as a **part of the colonial experience**. The
world]{.underline} as seen through an autochthonous lens [is one of
**discrete**, **disconnected spaces**, each belonging to its native
people]{.underline}. This is the autochthonous view of the world prior
to colonization and of the ideal decolonized space. It thus appears that
as borders and relationships begin to realign to allow for new forms of
subjective understanding and conspecificity, some scholars and activists
are actively working to re- fix borders and territories through
particularistic strategies of identification. [The new mode of
representation of indigeneity]{.underline}, which, ostensibly, appears
to be an expansion in subjective understanding, [creates a **Manichaean
dualism** of native and nonnative. Such a logics]{.underline} of
representation assumes that all past and present processes of exchange
are inherently destructive. Colonialism, from such a view, was (and
remains) about people moving about and that it was / is in this process
of moving away from where they are native to places where they are not
that has caused the enormous destruction of life. By casting all human
mobility as colonial acts, autochthonous modes of representation,
ironically, [**empty out** from the meaning of colonialism the
**enormous violence** that has been done by colonizers. It also
**minimalizes**---or even **[denies]{.mark}**---the [**violence done**
to people who]{.mark} **moved** and who **[move]{.mark}
today**]{.underline}.

[Borders, including the borders between natives and
nonnatives]{.underline}, although seemingly about the physical
separation of those in the national nos from its foreign others, then,
[are **primarily concerned with making differences** within the **same
space** that the nos [and]{.mark} its others both live in. Because
**we**]{.underline}---and, with Sylvia Wynter, I use "we" in all the
fullness of the term "**[humans]{.underline}**"---[have long lived in a
world that is **connected across now-demarcated spaces**, making
**claims**]{.underline} to land, to livelihoods, and [**to belonging**
on the basis of **particularistic claims**]{.underline}, such as a
racialized national membership, [**only works to [ensure]{.mark}**
that]{.underline} the [**[oppressions]{.mark}** and
**exploitations**]{.underline} wrought in the aftermath of 1492 [[are
**maintained**]{.mark}, albeit [in **new guises**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Law/Recognition=Good---2AC

#### Legal frameworks are not assimilationist or genocidal. At worst, they can be [overcome]{.underline} and [reappropriated]{.underline} --- at best, they supercharge Indigenous [economic prosperity]{.underline} and [territorial sovereignty]{.underline}.

The Rise of Co-Management and the Reform of Indigenous Land Claims

Critics of the land claims process are correct to note the original
structural flaws and the assimilating pressures introduced by the ANCs.
Yet [the [land claims model]{.mark} would [prove **resilient and
adaptive**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as [[Indigenous corporations]{.mark}
matured and their boards, managers and shareholders found ways to better
**[balance t]{.mark}raditional [k]{.mark}nowledge** [with modern
values.]{.mark}]{.underline} Today the [Indigenous corporations
[represent a **huge economic force**]{.mark} not only [in]{.mark} the
state of Alaska but across all of [Arctic North
America]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Rather than **forcibly
assimilating**]{.underline}]{.mark} [a reluctant Indigenous community
[in]{.mark}to a new [market culture]{.mark}, Indigenous Peoples [instead
**re-imagined**]{.mark} **the [land claims]{.mark}** model as their own,
[infusing it with]{.mark} a deep commitment to the **preservation and
revitalization** of [traditional knowledge]{.mark} and values [in
**balance with economic modernization**, pushing back against
ANCSA]{.mark} at the local, regional, state, and circumpolar
level]{.underline}.

[This structural evolution]{.underline} in the land claims model
[[appeared in]{.mark} the very first of Canada's land claim treaties
that followed ANCSA, the 1975 James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement
([JBNQA]{.mark}).]{.underline} The JBNQA introduced land and resource
co-management as well as self-government at the regional municipality
level as vehicles for Indigenous re-empowerment, and as mechanisms for
the interplay of traditional Indigenous knowledge, in both the Cree
communities of the James Bay Lowlands and the Inuit communities of
Nunavik. These mechanisms were reaffirmed when the JBNQA was extended to
the Naskapi territories of Northeastern Quebec in 1978 with the
Northeastern Quebec Agreement (NEQA).

[The]{.underline} Inuvialuit land claim in the Western Arctic which
followed (with its Agreement-in-Principle ([[AiP]{.underline}]{.mark})
negotiated in 1978, and the Inuvialuit Final Agreement
([[IFA]{.underline}]{.mark}) signed six years later in 1984), would like
the JBNQA/NEQA similarly [**[transcend ANCSA's corporate model]{.mark}**
by [institutionalizing **co-management of**]{.mark} **land, water,
[natural resources]{.mark}**, wildlife harvesting and
resources]{.underline}, in addition to a comparable scale of financial
compensation for those lands ceded to Canada. [It also [included]{.mark}
a share of [**government royalties** for]{.mark} oil, gas, and [mineral
development]{.mark} on federal land]{.underline}; government commitment
to meaningful economic participation in any development inside the
settlement area; and the formation of new national parks in the
settlement area that further protected the Inuvialuit land base from
development, while (also a departure from ANCSA) allowing unhindered
subsistence activities.

[In turn, this [inspired the U.S. f]{.mark}ederal [g]{.mark}overnment
[to]{.mark} **finally [address subsistence]{.mark}** [in
Alaska]{.mark}]{.underline} in the 1980 Alaska National Interest Lands
Conservation Act (ANILCA) after its omission from ANCSA, in essence
retrofitting Alaska's 1971 land claim with subsistence protections under
separate federal legislation nine years later, in contrast with the
fully integrated solution developed by Canada with its benefit of ANCSA
hindsight.11)

From Co-Management to Knowledge Co-Production: Increasingly
Collaborative (and Complex) Arctic Governance

[The reintroduction of traditional subsistence]{.underline}, with a more
inclusive role of traditional knowledge in managing subsistence,
[[reflects the **positive feedback loop**]{.mark} generated [by]{.mark}
the Canadian approach to [land claims]{.mark}. Its embrace of
traditional knowledge]{.underline}, from ANCSA's more assimilative and
"western" approach, has [transformed Arctic North America's
governance]{.underline}, yielding a complex patchwork of co-management
systems at the local and regional level. Co-management experts Thierry
Rodon and Aude Therrien view the institutional development of
co-management boards for jointly governing Indigenous homelands as a
complex governance arrangement necessitated by the demands for
multilevel governance across the Arctic.12)

Despite industry concerns with the resulting Balkanization of
decision-making, [[Indigenous Peoples]{.mark} have enthusiastically
**[defend]{.mark}ed their [gains]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} effectively and
**pro-actively [utilized]{.mark} their [co-management
structures]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This complexity is highlighted in
Mark Nuttall's research on the co-management of Arctic oil and gas
resources in Alaska and the Canadian Arctic,13) including his detailed
study of two generations of oil and gas co-management in the Mackenzie
River Valley, as well as Claudia Notzke's earlier pioneering research on
resource co-management across Canada,14) which chronicles both the
proliferation and increasing saliency of co-management as a governing
principle for natural resource management, even in regions without
settled land claims.

Derek Armitage et al.'s 2011 study of co-management in the Canadian
Arctic demonstrates how [co-management provides a mechanism for both
Indigenous [Peoples and governments]{.mark} to [learn]{.mark} **how [to
be adaptive]{.mark}** [amidst]{.mark} "**uncertainty and [environmental
change]{.mark}**."]{.underline}15) In short, social learning and
developing the adaptive capacity for resolving complex challenges
collaboratively has resulted in new levels of knowledge co-production
that successfully synthesize Indigenous and western approaches. Such an
approach introduces [[a]{.mark} "**[collaborative process]{.mark}** to
bring together a plurality of knowledge sources" that both [**reconciles
asymmetries in power** and overcomes]{.mark} the many [complexities
of]{.mark} [multilevel governance]{.mark}]{.underline}.16) Adaptive
co-management aligns with evolving decision-making networks that
increasingly incorporates tribal participation as governments at all
levels learn to collaborate with a wider ecosystem of stakeholders and
to embrace both western scientific and traditional ecological knowledge.

Fallacies

[Maximalism **ignores** the fact that the **value** of any

**larger**]{.underline} strategy grounded in a power

[help **build power** and sometimes they **don't**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Taken **alone**]{.underline}, [they are **not an adequate tool to test

The simple reason is that [there are **not enough** people who are
already 100% aligned]{.underline}. Our [organizations and movements need
to **grow**]{.underline}. Holding on to tactics and [**overly
[idealistic]{.mark}** [demands that keep us small but pure]{.mark}
ignores the **basic strategic imperative** of building

those who demand too little and tell our movements to set their sights
too low. [But we should not **[mistake]{.mark}** putting forward
[anything less than our most ambitious aspirations for]{.mark} an act of
**[cowardice]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In fact, [it might reflect a
**sober assessment** of our own power or advance a **longer term

[Maximalist thinking is]{.underline} particularly [**pernicious** when
it is used to justify not doing the **basic work** of
organizing]{.underline}: talking to lots of different kinds of people on
the doors, in their homes, and in their workplaces. [We need to meet
people where they are]{.underline}, build relationships, and move them
into action. [The work]{.underline} of organizing and base building also
[**disciplines** our tactics by **grounding** them]{.underline} in the
needs and demands of our people.

Our [opponents are **formidable** and **dangerous**]{.underline}. [[We
must assess the power we **actually have** at **all times** and in
**every circumstance** so that we don't either **leave power on the
table** or **overreach** and **come up empty**]{.underline}.]{.mark}
[[Sometimes]{.underline}]{.mark}, [our [assessment]{.mark} will [reveal
the need for us to build]{.mark} **tactical** and **strategic
[coalitions]{.mark}** [that share **broad**]{.mark}]{.underline} ---
[[though **not identical**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[**goals** to fight

1\. Introduction

Since the state and its colonial proxies first began to encroach upon
their homelands centuries ago, Natives of Arctic and Subarctic North
America have endeavored to assert and defend their Aboriginal rights and
cultural traditions, and to preserve as much of their autonomy as they
could. [[As Natives learned]{.mark} more [about]{.mark} the many systems
and structures of governance that were exported from distant
[colonial]{.mark} centers in [Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}, from the
commercial trading posts and early global networks they were part of, to
the largely democratic constitutional polities that would eventually
take root in their homelands, [[they]{.mark} found many new ways to
[reassert, and]{.mark} increasingly, [**restore, their autonomy** --
through **diplomacy**]{.mark}, protracted]{.underline} (sometimes
multi-decade and multigenerational) [[**negotiations**, and]{.mark}
various forms of **[political protest]{.mark}** and
engagement.]{.underline} In the Eurasian Arctic, a greater demographic
upheaval by settlers would initially limit gains by Natives in restoring
their rights and reasserting autonomy -- but through international
Native diplomacy by regional Native organizations like the Inuit
Circumpolar Conference (later renamed the Inuit Circumpolar Council),
and later through their status as Permanent Participants on the Arctic
Council, [[Natives from the]{.mark} more settled regions of the Eurasian
[Arctic]{.mark} would [join in]{.mark} the movement toward the
**[collaborative and inclusive]{.mark}** vision of **Native
[self-governance]{.mark}** that took shape in **Arctic North America** a
generation earlier]{.underline}, transforming what began as a regional
movement into a veritable circumpolar (and increasingly global) movement
for the restoration of Native rights.

The scale of this movement and the support for its goals from most
member states on the Arctic Council, many of which view Native
constitutional integration as an elegant solution to their problem of
sovereign legitimacy in the Arctic, contributed to both the domestic
social peace as well as circumpolar international peace -- and [[the
resulting calm became]{.mark} known as "**[Arctic
exceptionalism]{.mark}**."]{.underline} Its relative tranquility, with
its balanced relationship between indigenous and state interests and
institutions, owes much to the domestic reconciliation of tribe and
state that has taken place during this historic and exemplary period of
northward state expansion. (Heininen, 2011; Käpylä and Mikkola, 2015)
This contrasts sharply with elsewhere in the world, from further south
in the Americas to the bitterly contested colonial expansions in Africa
and Asia, where the modern state collided more forcefully (and with
greater kinetic energy) with the interests and sovereign aspirations of
countless indigenous empires, nations, and tribes, from the late 15th
century onward -- the result of which was a long legacy of annihilatory
warfare, genocide, forced migrations, and coercive assimilation policies
as states expanded onto indigenously self-governing lands -- resulting
in the general extinguishment of indigenous identity even as tribes
heroically fought back against the expanding state, even if inevitably
losing to the state's superior military power. (Time-Life Books, 1993;
Todorov, 1999; Utley & Washburn, 1977)

2\. Northward State Expansion: From Colonization to Collaborative Arctic
Governance

In the Far North of the North American continent, from the Aleutians in
the West to Greenland in the East, sovereign states (with their
concentrated military-industrial powers) collided with indigenous
peoples and polities much later in history, with economic contact,
through corporate proxies such as chartered companies operating on
behalf of distant sovereigns, coming to dominate the process of
colonization from the first Arctic voyages of the 16th century onward.
(Hartwig, 1874; Bockstoce, 2009) [[By the time the]{.mark} presence of
the rapidly modernizing [state began]{.mark} to be felt [in the
Arctic]{.mark}, [its methods]{.mark} for asserting political control
began to **soften**]{.underline}, with hard military power (as embraced
by the Russians in their initial conquest of the Aleutians and
consequent displacement of its peoples), [[shift]{.mark}ing [to
**soft**]{.mark}**er [power]{.mark}**, with **[economic
integration]{.mark}**, enhanced [by **treaty and autonomy**
negotiations]{.mark}]{.underline}, largely replacing conquest for the
final integration of Arctic territories into the American, Canadian and
Danish polities. (Gerhardt, 2011; Young, 1998; Zellen, 2008) With this
softer expansion marked less by muscular conquest and more by a gradual
hybridization of economic structures to integrate subsistence practices
with market dynamics, [northern [Natives]{.mark} did not feel compelled
to engage the state frontally by force but began to [see state
expansion]{.mark} more **[symbiotically]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
(Keskitalo & Southcott, 2014; Heaton, 2012) Sovereignty, security, and
survival across the Arctic region would require accommodation, rather
than confrontation, from both sides.

### Oppositional Scholarship Fails---2AC

#### Centering debate on the production of [oppositional scholarship]{.underline} gets [coopted]{.underline} by colonial elites.

**Okoth, 23**---member of the Salvage editorial collective (Kevin
Ochieng, "Decolonisation and the Decline of the 'Bandung Spirit'," *Red
Africa: Reclaiming Revolutionary Black Politics*, Chapter 1, pp. 16-20,
dml)

[The recent [focus on **epistemic**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [**symbolic**
or **cultural** [concerns]{.mark}]{.underline} of decolonisation can
largely be attributed to the Decolonial Studies (DS) school spearheaded
by the Argentinian linguist Walter Mignolo, which [has
[re-conceptualised decolonisation as]{.mark} a **[purely
academic]{.mark}** and **intellectual** issue]{.underline}. While the
discourse encompasses multiple strands of writing on colonialism and
epistemology, DS [scholars share a common set of theoretical
positions]{.underline}, [including]{.underline} Enrique Dussel's
anti-universalism, Mignolo's geopolitics of knowledge, Immanuel
Wallerstein's world- systems theory, and Sandra Harding's standpoint
theory, [an epistemic [approach]{.mark} which [argues that research must
**begin** with]{.mark} the perspectives of [the **most
oppressed**]{.mark} and **marginalised**]{.underline}, [since they are
socially situated in a way that gives them an advantage in gaining
certain forms of knowledge]{.underline}. Most importantly, however, DS
builds on the concept of the coloniality of power first articulated by
Aníbal Quijano to describe a 'matrix of power that produces racial and
gender hierarchies on the global and local level, functioning alongside
capital to maintain a modern regime of exploitation and domination'.17

For Quijano, coloniality is a mode of power that has its roots in two
historical processes: the codification of difference (i.e., superiority/
inferiority) in the idea of race, and the establishment of new modes of
control which made labour and resources available for capitalist
accumulation. Such formulations are, of course, nothing new. But it is
Quijano's linking of modernity and coloniality in a singular matrix that
constitutes his major contribution. What this matrix enables us to see
is that coloniality is the other -- dark -- side of modernity, the
inevitable outcome of an epistemological frame that enables the colonial
project to survive in reconstituted forms. Mignolo and other DS scholars
supposedly offer a way out of the oppressive bind of Quijano's
modernity/coloniality matrix. As Mignolo explains in On Decoloniality:

If there is no modernity without coloniality, if coloniality is
constitutive of modernity, if the '/' \[in the triad
modernity/coloniality/decoloniality\] divides and connects, then
decoloniality proposes the undoing of modernity. That is, decoloniality
implies demodernity. At the same time, modernity/coloniality engender
decoloniality. So there would be no decoloniality -- and decoloniality
would not be necessary -- if modernity/ coloniality had not created the
need to delink from the rhetoric of modernity and the logic of
coloniality.18

DS proposes new ways of 'thinking, sensing, believing, doing, and
living' that delink from the Eurocentric knowledge production of
modernity. Its aim, then, is to enable a reconstitution of knowledge
based on 'epistemic pluriversality': the coexisting epistemologies and
practices of the multiple worlds that the cultural and linguistic Other
inhabits. In doing so, they are pushing back against modernity, which
relies on a philosophical anthropology that, to borrow a phrase from
Sylvia Wynter, overrepresents European man as if it were the Human
itself, and subjugates those who have been categorised as subhuman
according to colonial logics.

[There is a **tension** between the **emancipatory aims**]{.underline}
to which DS pledges allegiance, [the **theoretical
framework**]{.underline} it proposes, [and its proponents'
**positionality** in the international]{.underline} ([and
intellectual]{.underline}) [division of labour]{.underline}. [What are
the implications for anti-imperialist struggle in the global south if
[those at the **forefront** of challenging]{.mark} the Eurocentricity of
[knowledge]{.mark} production [are based in]{.mark} the
**[resource-hoarding universities]{.mark}** of the global
north]{.underline} (and especially in the United States)[?]{.underline}
[Is there not a **[danger]{.mark}** here [of
**reproducing**]{.mark}]{.underline} precisely the kind of **[[epistemic
coloniality]{.underline}]{.mark}** from which we are trying to
delink[?]{.underline} And [what are we to make of]{.underline} DS'
[reliance on a **[deferential]{.mark}** version of standpoint
theory]{.underline}, [whose **[narrow focus]{.mark}** on]{.underline}
'[spokespeople from marginalised groups]{.underline}' [could
[**prevent** us from centring those voices]{.mark} whose exclusion DS
claims to be fighting against?]{.underline} As Olúfémí O. Táíwò
explains, 'The concept of elite capture originated in the study of
developing countries to describe the way socially advantaged people tend
to gain control over financial benefits, especially foreign aid, meant
for others'. But '[**[elite capture]{.underline}**'
[can]{.underline}]{.mark} also be used to [describe]{.underline} '[how
political projects can be **hijacked** in **principle** or in **effect**
by the well positioned and resourced]{.underline}'.19 There is, perhaps,
an analogy to be made between certain types of [scholars in the
neoliberal university]{.underline} and the neo-colonial elites; both
[**[enable]{.mark}** the **reproduction** of a system that ensures the
**[continued exploitation]{.mark}** of the very people they claim to
represent]{.underline}.

Táíwò is not [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} only one concerned with elite
capture. In 'Reflection on the Practices and Discourses of
Decolonisation', a forcefully argued critique of DS, the Bolivian
Anarcho-feminist Silvia Rivera Cusicanqui takes aim at a Latin American

[[intelligentsia]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[strikes]{.mark}
**post-modern** and]{.underline} even **[[post-colonial
poses]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and to the US academy and its followers
who built pyramidal structures of power and symbolic capital -- baseless
pyramids that vertically blind certain Latin American universities --
[[and]{.mark} form **clientelist networks** with indigenous and black
intellectuals]{.underline}.20

[These intellectuals]{.underline}, she argues, [[reproduce]{.mark}
a]{.underline} '[**[conditional inclusion]{.underline}**']{.mark} -- a
sort of 'second-class citizenship [[that moulds subaltern]{.mark}
imaginaries and [identities into]{.mark} the role of
**[ornaments]{.mark}** through which the anonymous masses play out the
theatricality of their own identity]{.underline}'. By reducing
Indigenous peoples to the marginal status of minorities, 'noble savages'
or 'guardians of nature', scholars like Mignolo and Catherine Walsh
[effectively]{.underline} exclude them from modernity and the crucial
struggles that are waged within it. Cusicanqui accuses Mignolo of
[[building]{.mark} a]{.underline} '**[small [empire within an
empire]{.mark}]{.underline}**[']{.mark} -- a formation that perpetuates
coloniality in Latin America [[by]{.underline}]{.mark}
'[**[enthroning]{.underline}**']{.mark} [[decolonisation in the
academy]{.underline}]{.mark}.21 Through [the **appropriation** and
**depoliticisation** of]{.underline} the work of [radical]{.underline}
Indigenous [scholarship]{.underline}, like that of Cusicanqui herself,
Mignolo [**marginalises** these scholars and activists from the very
debates that they themselves started and are still engaged
in]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}, in turn, [**limits** the
**imaginative power** and **emancipatory potential** of their
discourse]{.underline} on 'decolonisation'.

Decolonial Studies' concept of delinking does not correspond to the
Bandung-era demand, elaborated theoretically by Amin, that nations in
the global south should economically and politically delink from
imperialism. Rather, [delinking]{.underline} here [takes place
exclusively on an epistemic level]{.underline}. This is because, Mignolo
and his frequent collaborator Walsh argue, decoloniality delinks from
the knowledge of political theory, political economy and the
corresponding subject formation these knowledges entail.22 DS makes a
sharp distinction between colonialism as it is commonly understood and
the more abstract phenomenon of coloniality. While colonialism simply
refers to a political and economic relation in which 'the sovereignty of
a nation or a people rests on the power of another nation', coloniality
refers instead to the underlying 'patterns of power' -- in the spheres
of knowledge production or culture, for example -- that have survived
beyond the official end of colonial domination.23 For Mignolo and Walsh,
the national liberation movements of the Bandung era were engaged in
'dewesternisation'; that is, they were simply trying to fight
coloniality on its own terms (those of the nation-state), thus failing
to challenge the 'epistemic empire' that colonialism created.
Decoloniality, on the other hand, is not a state-led project, but
emerges from 'people organizing themselves in their local histories'.24
Theirs, they argue, is the only true decolonising praxis.

In her 1993 essay 'Public Enemies and Private Intellectuals', Ruth
Wilson [Gilmore takes issue with]{.underline} three approaches to
scholarship that have shaped how marginalised academics present
themselves in the neoliberal university. Gilmore groups these approaches
together under the banner of '[**[oppositional
studies]{.underline}**']{.mark}, which includes overlapping approaches
such as 'individual careerism', 'romantic particularism' and 'luxury
production'. [She defines **romantic particularism** as the tendency to
**uncritically [celebrate]{.mark}** the essential]{.underline}
'[**[authenticity]{.underline}**']{.mark} [of epistemologies and
cultures that have been suppressed]{.underline} by colonialism and
imperialism. **[Luxury production]{.underline}**, on the other hand,
[refers to the **relatively comfortable site**]{.underline} (i.e., [the
university]{.underline}) [from which these scholars produce]{.underline}
'oppositional' knowledge. For Gilmore, the final tendency, **[individual
careerism]{.underline}**, '[assigns **primary importance** to the
fact]{.underline} -- [and survival]{.underline} -- [of oppositional
studies within the intellectual and social structures of the
university]{.underline}'.25 To this end, [[scholars become **obsessed**
wit]{.mark}h the idea of [being]{.mark} the **first to coin** a
theoretical concept or [the **most knowledgeable**]{.mark} about a new
oppositional object]{.underline} -- [a performance]{.underline}, [text
or theory]{.underline}, for example. All three [tendencies [lead]{.mark}
oppositional scholars [to **distance themselves** from]{.mark} broader
social [struggles]{.mark} taking place outside of the
university]{.underline}, [[while they]{.mark} continue to **[derive
their]{.mark} academic [credibility]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} a close
identification with precisely [these]{.mark} struggles]{.underline}.

### Rejecting State=Bad---2AC

#### The alt [fails]{.underline} at best and [actively empowers]{.underline} neocolonial violence at worst.

**Kapoor, 24**---professor of Critical Development Studies at the
Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change at York University (Ilan,
"Intersectionality, Decoloniality, Indigenous Localism: A Critique,"
Theory, Culture & Society, OnlineFirst, doi:10.1177/02632764241303689,
dml)

There is much to learn from decoloniality -- from its multi-dimensional
analysis of coloniality, to its [[critique of Western modernity]{.mark}
and its]{.underline} prescriptions for decolonizing the colonial matrix.
But Mignolo's [analysis [inclines toward **romanticizing** decolonial
spaces]{.mark}]{.underline}. He has almost nothing critical to say about
the subaltern/Global South; it is [as though they are **somehow immune**
to contradiction]{.underline}, [failure]{.underline}, [or
disagreement]{.underline} (Kapoor and Zalloua, 2022: 96--9).

[This is evident in]{.underline} Mignolo's reliance on
[**[simplified]{.mark}** and **intransigent [binaries]{.mark}** such
as]{.underline} when he pits **[Western]{.underline}** 'imperial'
[universalism against **decolonial** pluriversality]{.underline}, which
for him is invariably 'convivial, dialogical, or plurilogical . . .
decolonial and communal personalities are driven by the search for love,
conviviality, and harmony' (Mignolo, 2018: xii, xiv; see also Mignolo,
2011: 313). It is also evident in the work of the
Modernity/Coloniality/Decoloniality [research]{.underline} programme, a
collective Latin America-focused research project of
[[which]{.underline}]{.mark} both Mignolo and Arturo Escobar are part.
The project [[prioritizes]{.underline}]{.mark}
'[**[non-Eurocentric]{.underline}**']{.mark} [[forms]{.mark} of
living]{.underline}/knowledge rooted in such communities as the
Zapatistas in Mexico, Indigenous groups in Ecuador and Bolivia, and
Afro-Latinx movements in Colombia (Asher, 2013: 838; see also Escobar,
2020: 84--96, 120--35; Mignolo, 2011: 11, 213--51). Yet when Mignolo
applauds, for example, the Zapatistas for their participatory politics
and collective consensus-making, he appears to ignore that
consensus-based politics can coerce single decisions on communities,
often suppressing subaltern voices (Kapoor, 2008: 107--8, 2020: 147--69;
see Rancière, 1999). When Mignolo praises Indigenous communities, he
**[[ignores]{.underline}]{.mark}**, for instance, [the [**cooptation**
of Indigenous leaders]{.mark}]{.underline} by the Ecuadorean state, the
Morales regime's [[**backtracking** on]{.mark} commitments to
[Indigenous self-determination]{.mark} to appease capitalist
extraction]{.underline}, [**[ideological divisions]{.mark}** between and
among Indigenous groups]{.underline} across North, South, and Central
America, [[or]{.underline}]{.mark} the anti-Muslim politics of sections
of adivasi (Aboriginal) communities in India in [[**collaboration** with
right-wing]{.underline}]{.mark} Hindu
[[supremacists]{.underline}]{.mark}: 'What is **[absent]{.underline}**
in Mignolo's representations of the subaltern [are]{.underline} the
[warnings]{.underline} by the likes of Freire and Fanon [about the
possibility of internalized subaltern oppression]{.underline},
[racism]{.underline}, [and co-optation]{.underline} (which is ironic,
given that Fanon is one of Mignolo's key decolonial exemplars)' (Kapoor
and Zalloua, 2022: 96; see also Baviskar, 2007; Merino, 2016).

The extent of such an indiscriminate politics of
authenticity/romanticization is to be gleaned in Mignolo's recent
endorsement of a book from a right-wing Hindu author (Deepak, 2021) who
deploys decolonial arguments to make the case for a return to a Hindu
(Brahmanical) epistemology. After a public outcry, Mignolo eventually
withdrew his endorsement,8 but his [[willingness to **uncritically
embrace** a]{.underline}]{.mark} Hindu nationalist [[politics]{.mark}
just [because it is **disparaging of Western
epistemology**]{.mark}]{.underline} and aims at retrieving an
'Indigenous' Hindu cosmology [is revealing of the decolonial tendency to
embrace putatively]{.underline} '**[authentic]{.underline}**' [Global
South spaces even if they are **elitist** or
**oppressive**]{.underline}.

What is conspicuously missing in Mignolo's decolonial position is the
dimension of the Real, the imminent blockage that prevents any
discursive formation -- whether capitalist, post-capitalist, or
pluriversal -- from actualizing its identity. As Crenshaw does with
intersectional identity, Mignolo appears to so revel in the jouissance
of the subaltern/Global South space that he is blind to -- disavows --
social contradictions. Hence his resort to an authentic pluriversality
devoid of imperfections: a space where, as Michaelsen and Shershow
(2007) underline in their analysis of his work (p. 53), there is de
facto consensus and agreement, indeed not even the need to criticize,
debate, or deliberate. [This [appears as]{.mark} the **[textbook]{.mark}
definition of [ideology]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- [the **erasure** of
the political]{.underline}, the covering over of social antagonism
(Žižek, 1989: 25).

The accompanying proclivity is that [the production of an authentic
Global South subaltern space ends up **militating against** the putative
political subject of decoloniality]{.underline} -- [the
subaltern]{.underline}. In this regard, echoing Spivak (1988), Asher
(2013: 838--9) suggests that Mignolo and his decoloniality peers are
'turning to subaltern knowledge to fulfill \[their\] desire to create a
just world for humans and non-humans'. Decolonial jouissance of the
pluriverse induces the absence of critical self-reflexivity on the part
of the decolonial analyst, with the latter portraying himself as
transparent relay able to accurately capture the subaltern voice. The
search for a subaltern pluriverse thus becomes a self-fulfilling
prophecy: you project a pluriversal platform on the subaltern and then
rejoice in miraculously finding it! But in this mêlée, the subaltern is
not heard (which is why my above critique of Zapatista participatory
politics says less about the Zapatistas than Mignolo's construction of
them).

Mignolo's [Manichaean [argumentation]{.mark} also tends to be **broadly
dismissive** of Western thought]{.underline}, [accusing it of complicity
in the colonial matrix of power]{.underline}, [thus appealing for it to
be superseded]{.underline} (Mignolo, 2002: 80, 2010: 346). He seems [to
[**conflate** hegemonic European]{.mark}]{.underline}
([colonial]{.underline}) [[thought with European thought writ
large]{.underline}]{.mark}. In so doing, he [**[fails to
acknowledge]{.mark}** the many [European]{.mark} intellectual
**[counter-discourses]{.mark}** to colonial rationality or binary
thinking]{.underline} (anti-imperialism, non-dualism, communitarianism,
etc.) [with [which]{.mark}]{.underline}, for all intents and purposes,
[much of [decolonial thought is **allied**]{.mark}]{.underline}. He
fails as well to account for his own debt to so-called Eurocentrism,
disavowing that his intellectual background, as well as the very
language (English) and critical tools he deploys (e.g. geopolitics,
difference, epistemology, gnoseology, aesthesis), are unavoidably
Eurocentric (Kapoor and Zalloua, 2022: 99--100). Worse still, his
[policing of the boundaries of what is]{.underline}
'**[Western]{.underline}**'/'non-Western' [ends up **eliding** the
centuries-old cultural and economic exchange between Europe and its
putative others]{.underline} (Africa, the Arab world, Indigenous
America, the Indian subcontinent, etc.); [or indeed the **substantial
history** of subaltern resistance]{.underline} -- [in Europe's
colonies]{.underline}, [and in Europe itself]{.underline} -- [that is
**integral** to the emergence of such notions as]{.underline}
'equality', '**[freedom]{.underline}**', and 'social justice' (see, for
example, Anghie, 2005; Buck-Morss, 2009; Cusicanqui, 2012).

Thus, Mignolo's [decolonial disavowal]{.underline} of the
unconscious/Real [is]{.underline} not only deeply ideological for
romanticizing subaltern pluriversality, but also **[deeply
depoliticizing]{.underline}**. Rather than seeing internal (community or
social movement) differences and contradictions as weaknesses/traumas to
be suppressed or avoided in order to produce a perfect subaltern 'hero',
why not try to face them head-on to invent new and creative (although
never harmonious) subaltern political spaces? [Rather than understanding
colonial violence and dispossession as a reason to **nostalgically
manufacture**]{.underline} past or present [glory or wallow
in]{.underline} victimhood and **[resentment]{.underline}** ([against
European thinkers]{.underline}), [[why not]{.mark} struggle to [**become
proficient** with]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and
**use**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[European discourses of emancipation and
freedom]{.mark} to fight for subaltern equality and social justice
everywhere?]{.underline} [[The Western colonial legacy is]{.mark} indeed
[imperialist]{.mark} domination and plunder]{.underline}, [[but it is
**also**]{.underline},]{.mark} as Žižek (2009) underlines, 'that of [the
**[self-critical examination]{.mark}** of the violence and exploitation
the West itself brought to the Third World]{.underline} . . . the West
supplied the very standards by which it (and its critics) measures its
own criminal past' (p. 115). [The [antagonisms of European
hegemony]{.mark}]{.underline}, in this sense, [[can be]{.mark} viewed as
**[powerful]{.mark} subaltern political
[resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And such is the case not only for the
subaltern from the Global South, but also for the subaltern from the
Global North: their common predicaments could be the occasion to find
cause together in shared trauma (Kapoor, 2020: xv, 66; Kapoor and
Zalloua, 2022: 20). [This is something that]{.underline} Mignolo's
[demonization of the West **precludes**]{.underline}, failing as it does
to distinguish hegemonic from subaltern (counter-) discourses, whether
in the West or otherwise, thereby further depoliticizing the subaltern.

Finally, there is the issue of [the [exclusion of the
**state**]{.mark}]{.underline} and political economy in Mignolo's gloss.
In regard to the state, Mignolo stands firmly against it, predictably
seeing it as the political expression of (Western) coloniality. For him,
pluriversal spaces would 'exist independently of the state and
corporations' by delinking 'from state forms of governance, from the
economy of accumulation' (Mignolo, 2018: xii, xiv). Thus, 'the future
would be composed of "communal nodes" around the planet cooperating
rather than competing with each other . . . \[through\] the entanglement
of several cosmologies connected today in power differential' (Mignolo,
2011: 283, 2018: x).

But Mignolo's position [[appears]{.mark} politically
**[naive]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [Without some]{.underline}]{.mark}
[form of **[coordinating authority]{.mark}** like a state]{.underline},
[it [remains **unclear**]{.mark} [how]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[security and well-being]{.underline}]{.mark} of 'communal nodes'
[[would be realized]{.underline}]{.mark}; [[what would ensure
**cooperation**]{.underline},]{.mark} [rather than
conflict]{.underline}, [[among and between nodes]{.underline}]{.mark},
especially given 'power differential'; [[and how]{.mark} these nodes
would be able [to **thwart** the]{.mark} continuing [incursion
of]{.mark} global [capital]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[or threats
from]{.mark} both the [**Western** and]{.mark}]{.underline}
['**[de-Westernized]{.underline}**' [powers]{.underline}]{.mark}
envisaged by Mignolo. It seems, in fact, that his [pluriversal
politics]{.underline} [**unconsciously requires** a]{.underline}
national, regional, and/or transnational [state]{.underline} to ensure
[the [coexistence of]{.mark}]{.underline} '[**[many
worlds]{.underline}**']{.mark}. He [[appears to **count** on]{.mark}
such things as [peace enforcement]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}
[cooperation]{.underline}, [provision of [universal education and health
care]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[regulation of
multinationals]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[campaigns against]{.mark} global
[viral infections]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and so forth]{.underline}, for
his communal nodes [to **thrive**]{.underline}.

#### Especially if they don't envision a change to the [state]{.underline}.

**Kapoor, 24**---professor of Critical Development Studies at the
Faculty of Environmental and Urban Change at York University (Ilan,
"Intersectionality, Decoloniality, Indigenous Localism: A Critique,"
Theory, Culture & Society, OnlineFirst, doi:10.1177/02632764241303689,
dml)

But it is precisely à propos his gloss on Indigenous alternatives that
problems arise. There appears to be a contradiction between his desire
for a 'non-dialectical' [[Indigenous **resurgence**]{.underline}]{.mark}
and one that is 'self-consciously traditional'. Indeed, drawing on the
work of Taiaiake Alfred (2005, 2009) and Leanne Simpson (2011, 2014), he
insists that such a resurgence 'does not require us to dialectically
transcend Indigenous practices of the past' (Coulthard, 2014: 154).
Instead, he [[endorses]{.underline}]{.mark} a 'self-conscious
traditionalism' (p. 155) aimed at [rehabilitating and [strengthening
Indigenous cultural identity to **opt out** of the]{.mark}]{.underline}
coercive and assimilative liberal [[politics of
**recognition**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The idea is to draw on Indigenous
traditions to 're-creat\[e\] the cultural and political flourishment of
the past' (Simpson, quoted in Coulthard, 2014: 156). Coulthard sees such
cultural reclamation as critical and socially progressive, aiming for
example at a pro-feminist and LGBTQ+ politics (pp. 157--8).

Yet, in the absence of a dialectic, such progressivism appears as
wishful thinking. For Hegel, who Coulthard (2014) specifically
references in this regard (pp. 26--9), the dialectic is decidedly the
site of self-division and alienation, moving the subject toward
self-consciousness and critique (Hegel, 1977: 138, 2010: 360; McGowan,
2019: 12). Here, it is subjectivity's immanent (not transcendent)
self-contradiction that both structures identity and propels it forward
(i.e. outside itself, toward that which it is not). Without a dialectic,
then, [[it is **difficult to understand** how]{.underline}]{.mark}, in
Coulthard's vision, [Indigenous [traditionalism would
become]{.mark}]{.underline} ['**[self-conscious]{.underline}**']{.mark}.
What would enable or mediate such autocritique? [[Why would
traditionalism be]{.mark} **socially [critical]{.mark}** and
**progressive** [rather than **regressive**?]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[Missing]{.underline}**]{.mark} in 'Indigenous traditionalism', in
other words, [[is the domain of the **political**]{.underline}]{.mark}
(Rancière, 1999), which is what responds to ever-present social
antagonisms (the Real), thus [making for a landscape of **contestation**
and **debate**]{.underline}. And [[the **lack** of the
political]{.underline}]{.mark} in Coulthard's case [[means that
Indigenous traditionalism]{.underline}]{.mark}, [**despite** attempts to
recover and renew it]{.underline}, still nostalgically aspires to a
'flourishment of the past'. Not so different from Crenshaw's
intersectional identity or Mignolo's decolonial politics of
authenticity, Indigenous culture thereby [[becomes a]{.mark} positive
and [depoliticized **cultural resource**]{.mark}]{.underline}/archive,
once again [[risking]{.underline}]{.mark} fetishization,
essentialization, **[[commodification]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Coulthard
gestures toward the Real of culture by favouring Indigenous social
progressivism in the midst of traditionalism, but ends up settling for
what Zalloua (2023) aptly calls a 'self-enclosed decolonial revival
project' (p. 186, n173). His critical cultural politics is undercut by
his jouissance of 'traditional' identity.

This is all the more perplexing given that his exemplar, Fanon (1963),
is notably critical of a politics of identity and authenticity, seeing
the négritude movement, for example, as a 'blind alley' -- a narrow
'racism of defense' that is nothing but the 'logical antithesis' of
White European prejudice against Blacks (pp. 163--4, 214, 212). Despite
the tendency toward cultural recovery after the trauma of colonial rule
(racism, exploitation, dispossession, domination), Fanon writes that
'the past can in no way be my guide in the actual state of things'
(Fanon, 1967: 199--200), advocating instead for a dialectical and
politicized vision of culture -- a 'fighting' culture, one that 'takes
its place at the very heart of the struggle for freedom' (Fanon, 1963:
222, 233). It is such political dynamism that secures against the
positivization of culture or the enjoyment of tradition, impeding either
from encrusting borders or identity.

Coulthard's [[advocacy of Indigenous localism]{.mark} provides further
evidence of this **depoliticized**]{.underline} -- [albeit **outwardly
critical**]{.underline} -- [stance]{.underline}. As just mentioned, he
is [rightly condemnatory of the settler state for its continuing
coloniality of power]{.underline}. [But]{.underline} like Mignolo, he
[appears]{.underline} thereby [to **do away** with it]{.underline},
[advocating instead for Indigenous self-determination]{.underline} 'by
cultivating [self-sufficiency]{.underline} through . . . localized and
sustainable production' (p. 172). And just like Mignolo, he [[provides
**no clues** as to how]{.mark} such a decentralized politics [would fend
off]{.mark}]{.underline} '**[[settler colonial
capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**' [[in the **absence** of a
**state-like coordinating authority**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Coulthard's
[self-critical Indigenous traditionalism appears]{.underline}, once
again, [to **unconsciously require** a]{.underline} (local, national,
and/or transnational) [state to resist both coloniality and the reach of
corporate capitalism]{.underline}. In this regard, Zalloua (2023) asks:
'[[can Indigenous nations **truly live** if capitalism **thrives
everywhere else**]{.mark} in the world]{.underline} (assuming one can
even manage to kill it at home via sustainable and self-sufficient
Indigenous economies)[?]{.underline} [[Doesn't global capitalism
**benefit** if Indigenous communities keep their]{.underline}]{.mark}
anti-capitalism, their nonexploitative
[[alternatives]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[**local**?]{.underline}]{.mark}'
(p. 31). An anti-capitalist 'self-conscious traditionalism' thus appears
a contradiction in terms, since the demise of global capitalism would
require a transnational, and precisely not a decentralized/localist,
riposte.

Moreover, [other frames were added, even during the years when tensions
were rising. In 2005, Sheila Watt-Cloutier filed a petition with the
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights arguing that the impacts of
climate change violated the fundamental human rights of Indigenous Inuit
people across the Arctic]{.underline}. Although the Commission did not
hear the case, [her action initiated a transformation in how the
international community views climate change. Moving away from
discussions of science, economics, or politics, the action frames
climate change as a current human rights crisis that impacts
marginalized communities disproportionately. The UN Human Rights Council
later adopted the first of a series of resolutions linking climate
change to human rights]{.underline} (Marshall 2022). [In framing the
issue this way, climate justice advocates argue that they gain more
leverage in both public opinion and under the law, so that those most
affected by it have a seat at the table]{.underline}. Such framing
brings the urgency of the problem to the fore and helps to focus on
human beings and our survival (Watt-Cloutier 2016; Marshall 2022).

[As the challenges of the Arctic continue to be co-constituted,
understandings of science and the environment and its dangers have been
transformed as groups previously excluded from global governance have
joined the dis-course]{.underline}. Input from the scientific community
in the Arctic region seeks to generate international environmental
cooperation. Yet while scientists do not make value judgments as, for
example, scholars in law and religion do, there is a fundamental clash
between a dominant form of scientific knowledge and the situated
knowledge of local people (Nuttall 2004: 206). Nonetheless, [Indigenous
peoples have (rightly) insisted on their participation in the
construction of knowledge about their communities and environment with
the scientific community]{.underline}. The two groups do not intuitively
share a framework for how to go about doing this; however, the initial
norms for the participation of Indigenous peoples established through
the AEPS and Arctic Council have remained and influenced other

#### Inclusion of Indigenous people in policymaking leads to more [just]{.underline} policies that ensure [sustainability]{.underline}.

**Milligan**, **23** -- Scottish philosopher who is currently a Senior
Researcher in the Philosophy of Ethics with the Cosmological Visionaries

The culmination of this paper will be an argument from belonging. This
argument has an intermediate conclusion, and a final conclusion. The
intermediate conclusion is that [a sense of belonging not just to the
Earth\'s surface, but to a larger region of space is going to become
**indispensable** if we want to understand the deeper human significance
of our expansion into space]{.underline}. The final conclusion is that
**[[Indigenous inclusion can]{.mark} and should [help]{.mark} to [inform
the]{.mark} [development]{.mark}]{.underline}** of such a sense of
belonging. For simplicity, "inclusion" will be used as a placeholder for
Indigenous participation and engagement with a variety of governmental
and non-governmental bodies involved in space activities. As the theme
concerns belonging, the argument will also be rather philosophical, and
so it concerns the background to policy discussions more than a
specified program of action. What is said will be consistent with
several policy approaches just so long as they are shaped by a concern
for the relevant kind of inclusion. While [the argument is]{.underline}
philosophical, it is nonetheless [geared to set out a pragmatic reason
for strengthening Indigenous inclusion over the long term]{.underline}.
And [this pragmatism may help to reinforce a sense that the view set out
could make its way into the shaping of policy, or otherwise contribute
to answering questions such as "[What advantages]{.mark} are there
[to]{.mark} building [Indigenous inclusion into policy?]{.mark}" One
answer will be, "We [end up with]{.mark} **[policy that is more
just]{.mark}**."]{.underline} [[Another will be, "We end up with policy
better **geared to the long term**]{.underline}]{.mark}." By which, I
mean the period of time during which key features of our identity will
be reshaped as beings who may belong, and feel at home, not only on the
surface of the Earth, but elsewhere also. This elsewhere need not be
everywhere, or even make us multi-planetary, just so long as it is
expansive enough to require a shift in ideas about who we are.

Largely [as a result of Indigenous political foresight and
perseverance]{.underline} -- from the municipal level all the way up to
the international level through diplomatic bodies such as the United
Nations and more regionally-focused like the Arctic Council -- [a solid
foundation for Arctic exceptionalism has been established, buffering the
region from contending influences such as renewed nationalism and state
rivalry]{.underline}, preserving regional order even as states face off
against one another in an increasingly contested Arctic.

It was the historic 1971 passage of [the Alaska Native Claims Settlement
Act (ANCSA) -- the pioneering land treaty transferring 44 million acres
of land title and one billion dollars in compensation to Alaska
Indigenous peoples --]{.underline} that [established the foundation
stone for the emergent system of co-management and collaboration across
Arctic North America]{.underline}, a model embraced while being greatly
enhanced as Inuit land claims built upon ANCSA's foundation in the
Canadian Arctic, strengthening it by enhancing the breadth and diversity
of collaborative structures while retaining the system of Indigenous
village and regional corporations that defined ANCSA, with Inuit land
corporations gaining title to nearly one-tenth of their traditional land
base much the way the regional corporations did in Alaska, and with new
co-management structures increasingly enabling Indigenous participation
in resource management and in environmental screening and review
processes.

What started with ANCSA at the start of the 1970s would continue to
evolve and transform over the next half century, in both Alaska and
across the international boundary in the Canadian Arctic, a process
watched closely by Arctic Indigenous peoples in other regions as well as
Indigenous peoples from elsewhere in the world. [This dynamic, living,
and evolutionary process is illustrated well by Alaska's many post-ANCSA
amendments designed to correct perceived flaws in the original land
claims structure in Alaska]{.underline} (starting as early as 1976, with
more to come in 1980, 1987 -- the famous '1991 amendments', 1995, and as
recently as 2017) and in the subsistence provisions included in the 1980
Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) designed in
part to redress ANCSA's omission of subsistence protection; as well as
the 1993 federal recognition of Alaska's Indigenous communities as
tribes -- the culmination of the 1980s' tribal sovereignty movement that
spread across village Alaska in reaction to ANCSA's corporate focus --
and in the years since, in the piecemeal, multilevel effort to align
federal policy and tribal aspirations (amidst occasional resistance by
the state of Alaska) that has played out across nearly half a century.

Across the border, the process of strengthening and rebalancing the new
political economies inside land claims settlement areas has been less
piecemeal and more iterative and cumulative, with land claims accords
internally integrating these very same processes that were addressed ex
post facto outside the land claims process in Alaska, making for a
smoother and more elegant institutional process -- albeit with numerous
implementation challenges revealing the very same kinds of clashes
between traditional/Indigenous and Westphalian/state values in both
Canada and Alaska -- as reflected in the structures of the 1984
Inuvialuit Final Agreement (agreed to in principle in 1978, seven years
after ANCSA, two years after ANCSA's first amendments, and two years
before ANILCA); the 1993 Nunavut Land Claims Agreement (whose
territorial secession, to form the Nunavut Territory, took place in
1999, but which continues to experience frictions between the Inuit of
Nunavut and the federal government over two decades later); and the 2005
Labrador (Nunatsiavut) Inuit Land Claim, which opted for a more
localized ethnic government rather than a public system, rejecting the
Nunavut model owing to demographic and economic pressures from
Newfoundland and its mining and fishing interests.7

What looks to be a raw and dissonant clash in the Hegelian tradition of
separate and competing processes driven by separate branches of
government and competing levels of analysis in Alaska appears to be a
more unified synthesis in Canada. But all is not what it seems: the
Canadian process achieves synthesis largely in the absence of large
settler populations or powerful regional governments -- in northern
regions like Alaska with substantial non-Indigenous populations, like
the Yukon, Newfoundland and the northern provinces, the very same,
dissonant, dialectical clash has taken place and continues to recur. And
even in regions of Indigenous demographic predominance, there has been
resistance on implementation, insufficiency in training funds and
support, and many other clashes between the Inuit and the Canadian
federal government in Ottawa, which has at times appeared to be more of
reluctant partner (especially with regard to Nunavut implementation when
compared to the official enthusiasm that greeted its formation), and
whose reluctance suggests perhaps some second thoughts in Ottawa on the
extent of devolution in power achieved by the Inuit.

3 From Co-management to Collaborative Arctic Sovereignty:
Transnationalism as a Bridge

Despite these bumps along the road to implementation, [co-management
offers no less important a path toward synthesis of these competing
forces, with regional, largely internal 'regimes' balancing Indigenous
and non-Indigenous interests]{.underline}. States continue to
predominate in terms of material power but [Indigenous peoples command
demographic predominance in remote regions, becoming essential
stakeholders in Arctic sovereignty. It is this fundamental demographic
truth, and the minimal settler populations in the Canadian Arctic, that
has ensured the progress continued, and that Inuit empowerment
strengthened]{.underline}, even as Ottawa began to display a more
conflicted view through its foot-dragging on implementation, and
occasional assertions of a desire to streamline the highly localized
patchwork of co-management regimes into something more industry (and
federal government) friendly. Recent history presents numerous case
studies that illustrate the increasing success of co-management as a
paradigm for Arctic governance, and, perhaps paradoxically, increasing
conflicts between the very unequal parties that co-management has
structurally united.

[While co-management has experienced its share of
challenges]{.underline}, with federal foot-dragging on making
appointments to co-management boards and funding programs to which
Ottawa committed during land claims negotiations, and resistance to
decisions driven by traditional over western knowledge systems, or
cultural over economic/commercial values, [these challenges and
associated tensions are, in their own way, **proof of co-management's
success** -- establishing a hybrid governing structure to **mediate the
many differences** in values, aspirations and policies between tribes
and states. Co-management structures, in addressing and attempting to
find synthesis in the state-tribe dialectic, reflect a transformation in
the concept of Arctic sovereignty as states increasingly **root their
sovereignty in the consent of Indigenous peoples**, and as much as
possible, align their interests with them]{.underline} (not unlike how
HBC governed earlier in history, with its overlapping sovereign layers,
devolving much autonomy to its Indigenous partners and proxies while
maintaining an iron fist over its monopoly trading rights.) Modern
states have been no different, with a steadfast desire to maintain its
monopoly control over foreign and defense policy, and its economic
supremacy, even while showing accommodation on other issues.

Much literature on Arctic land claims views the relatively recent wave
of successful land claims negotiations in Arctic North America from 1971
to 2005 as the beginning of an Arctic modernization and globalization
process, but history shows a longer integration of traditional northern
economies and market economies with roots far outside the region. The
formative legacy of this extensive history of economic collaboration
tends to be understated, with 'Oil Age Eskimos' perceived to be a new
phenomenon, and Inuit economic interactions with the global oil industry
a fundamentally new era. Such a perception has been reinforced by the
successful efforts of Indigenous rights activists and jurists like
celebrated retired BC Supreme Court justice Thomas R. Berger, who
galvanized interest in and support for traditional Indigenous values
through public hearings and thought-provoking reports and books based on
those hearings that warned of a sudden, historically transformative
moment -- starting in the 1970s with Berger's Mackenzie Valley Pipeline
Inquiry, which froze economic development in the Western Arctic until
settled land claims could provide greater Indigenous participation in
that development, and repeated during the Alaska Native Review
Commission a decade later, and again two decades after that with his
Conciliator's Report on Nunavut Implementation, and then again a decade
later when he helped to save the Peel River watershed from development
efforts in the Yukon that bypassed the co-management processes
established by the Yukon First Nations Umbrella Final Agreement (UFA).

A generation after Berger's Mackenzie Valley Pipeline Inquiry
effectively blocked resource development in the Western Arctic for a
decade, the Mackenzie Gas Project (MGP) would hold a new round of
consultations in the very same communities of the region starting in
2004, now with Indigenous groups sitting at both sides of the table,
representing both the corporate stakeholders hoping to extract and
transport natural gas up the Mackenzie River to southern markets (as
one-third equity owners via the Aboriginal Pipeline Group) as well as
the local communities grappling with the effects on traditional
subsistence activities and the natural environment.8 The effort proved
successful procedurally, and in 2011 the Mackenzie Valley pipeline was
granted federal cabinet and National Energy Board approval. But by then
gas prices had collapsed, and the economics of the pipeline were no
longer attractive, so the victory was pyrrhic -- the consultation
process was now beyond doubt inclusive of Indigenous interests, as
diverse as they were, but it had consumed so much time that the
underlying market fundamentals had transformed before its favorable
conclusion, ultimately dooming the project. But it remains no less
illustrative of the tectonic shift in the Arctic's political economy
that had taken place since the first Mackenzie Valley Pipeline Inquiry
in the 1970s, and the maturation of Indigenous participation in Arctic
development.

[It was the co-management table that provided the structural model for
the Arctic Council where an observer state like China sits in the back
of the room, while the six Indigenous Permanent Participant groups sit
at the main table, next to the eight member states]{.underline}; though
decisions reside with the sovereign, [the informal influence of the
Indigenous groups is **near parity** with the member
states]{.underline}, and with close connections to their state
counterparts, [enduring policy alignments between the Indigenous groups
and their host states augment the voice of the Permanent Participants
even further]{.underline}. But at the working group level, funding
disparities limit areas of Indigenous engagement, providing more space
for observer states and NGOs to influence Arctic policy through their
technical expertise. On the whole, however, [at the co-management table,
Arctic Indigenous peoples and states not only share the stage but
increasingly **unite their voice**]{.underline}. Thierry Rodon and Aude
Therrien describe the land claims process and the consequent
institutional development of co-management boards for jointly governing
Indigenous homelands as a complex governance arrangement necessitated by
the demands for multilevel governance in the Arctic,9 and despite
complaints from numerous political and business leaders on the resulting
'Balkanization' of decision-making in the post-land claims Arctic and
ongoing efforts to streamline this process through regional integration,
[Indigenous leaders have to a large measure defended their gains and
protected existing co-management structures, with their intensely
localized geography, particularly in the ethnically diverse Northwest
Territories and Yukon]{.underline}. In Nunavut, which is ethnically
unified by its overwhelming Inuit majority population, concern is less
with a Balkanized decision-making landscape of the sort that has emerged
in the more western territories of the Canadian North and in Alaska, and
more with the Government of Canada's lackluster commitment to land
claims implementation, and what Inuit perceived to be a half-hearted
commitment to co-management in Ottawa. As a result, Arctic North
America's lands, waters and resources remain governed by a
continent-wide patchwork of co-management boards that is, by its very
nature, institutionally complex.10

This complexity is highlighted in Mark Nuttall's insightful research on
the co-management of Arctic oil and gas resources in Alaska and the
Western Arctic,11 and Claudia Notzke's pioneering research on resource
co-management across Canada,12 which chronicles both the proliferation
and increasing saliency of co-management as a governing principle for
natural resource management, even in regions without settled land
claims. Indeed, [so well-suited is co-management to resource-rich
frontier regions, it has been **decoupled from the land claims
process**, finding its way into resource-rich parts of Canada's settled
southern provinces where competing claims to the land have precluded
successful negotiation of land claims, becoming a salient micro-level of
analysis independent of land claims settlement]{.underline} -- as
evident in the emergence of "strategic co-management" systems designed
for "cooperative environmental management" of natural resource-rich
area, yielding stand-alone co-management bodies in areas of southern
Canada without settled land claims.13 Derek Armitage et al.'s 2011 study
of co-management in the Canadian Arctic demonstrates how co-management
provides a mechanism for both Indigenous peoples and governments to
learn how to be adaptive amidst "uncertainty and environmental change,"
and thus to benefit from social learning for developing adaptive
capacity for resolving complex challenges collaboratively, [resulting in
new levels of knowledge co-production that successfully **synthesize
Indigenous and western approaches** -- introducing a "collaborative
process \[to bring\] together a plurality of knowledge sources" that
both reconciles asymmetries in power and overcomes the many complexities
of multilevel governance]{.underline}.14

4 Transnationalism and Arctic Globalization: Harmonization of Indigenous
and State Interests

[Just as co-management strives to institutionalize the dynamic balancing
of competing traditional and modern values, and of tribal and state
powers, it can also help to establish a foundation for the diplomatic
balancing of Arctic interests and non-Arctic interests
alike]{.underline}. Indeed, it can serve not only as a metaphor, but an
institutional foundation, for the management of the emergent state
competition gathering steam in the Arctic. Derek Armitage et al.'s 2007
volume, Adaptive Co-Management: Collaboration, Learning and Multi-Level
Governance,15 illustrates the globalization and universalization of
co-management far beyond the Arctic region with case studies that
include both northern examples of co-management (from Alaska, Yukon,
Northwest Territories and Nunavut) as might be expected, as well as case
studies of co-management in places as diverse as Vancouver Island,
Southern Ontario and Atlantic Canada in Canada's southern provinces in
addition to Wisconsin in the USA; Belize, Barbados, and Grenada in the
Central America/Caribbean region; and Sweden in Europe. Indeed,
co-management has truly gone global. Former Yukon Premier Tony Penikett
has observed that Indigenous treaties in Canada are themselves
"inherently international because natives are transnational," even if
governments in North America still view Indigenous peoples as
"domesticated" components of their constitutional polities. To Penikett,
[land claims treaties and the many co-management structures they yielded
are "remarkable nation-building achievements," helping to offset earlier
colonial-era treaties and the "historic failures of colonizing states to
respect their treaty promises]{.underline}."16

Looking to the future, as the polar thaw drives continuing Arctic
globalization, and non-Arctic states show increasing interest in Arctic
lands, waters and resources, the strategic center of mass for engaging
in Arctic enterprises of all sorts will be the myriad co-management
structures that define the post-land claims political topography of
Arctic North America. Indeed, the Arctic Council emerged from the many
structures of multi-level and multilateral co-management developed
within the Arctic at the domestic level -- between tribes, local
governments, state and territorial governments, national governments,
economic entities, and environmental actors, both within and across
borders.

The Arctic Council, with its unique and evolving structure bringing
Indigenous Permanent Participant groups and the founding member states
together, joined by observers (both state and non-state that increase in
number and diversity over time), is well designed for the inclusion of
new voices, particularly competing voices -- after all, it was the
moderation of competing voices between tribal and settler interests
that, through the land claims process, transformed Arctic governance
into a meaningfully collaborative process that in many cases
successfully balances those voices, finding consensus despite the many
asymmetries of the actors involved. The Arctic Council is thus firmly
(and deeply) rooted in collaboration, bringing co-management to the
global stage.

Case Examples

Climate change such as global warming has accelerated [**[permafrost
thaw]{.mark}** and **sea ice melt**, resulting in conditions that
**directly impact Arctic Indigenous peoples** and
communities.]{.underline} Such conditions yield multiple limitations and
losses, [many of which **[threaten]{.mark} the livelihoods** among
[Indigenous]{.mark} peoples in the Circumpolar North. These include
access to **natural [resources]{.mark}** and **ancestral
[lands]{.mark}**, as well as loss of **[land and housing]{.mark}**,
which can [lead to **forced relocation**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

More specifically, [global [warming]{.mark} yields changes in ecosystems
with a direct [impact]{.mark} on Indigenous peoples' **[everyday
physical]{.mark} health**, **[mental health]{.mark}** and **overall
wellbeing**. From [loss]{.mark}es [of]{.mark} Indigenous [tr**aditional
knowledge**]{.mark} and connection to cultures to [increas]{.mark}ing
**[food insecurity]{.mark}** and [health risks related to water
quality]{.mark}, Indigenous peoples and communities experience
**disproportionate impacts** as a result of climate change]{.underline}.
In the Circumpolar North:

"For instance, coastal erosion and [[thawing permafrost]{.mark} are
[destroy]{.mark}ing or threatening [cultural]{.mark}ly **significant
[archaeological sites]{.mark}** across the Arctic.]{.underline} In
Alaska, this includes the erosion of an Ipiutak cemetery, while in
northwestern Canada, the most significant Inuvialuit archaeological
sites are at high risk of deterioration. [Climate change is also
affecting culturally important **[wildlife]{.mark} populations**
[and]{.mark} access to **[subsistence harvests]{.mark}** by [impeding
safe]{.mark} access and [travel]{.mark} [across]{.mark} the [land,
water, and ice]{.mark} for hunters and fishers]{.underline} in Alaska,
Greenland, Siberia, and Canada"13)

[This [diminished]{.mark} ability to engage in **[traditional
activities]{.mark}** such as subsistence activities [contributes to food
insecurity.]{.mark}]{.underline} Yet, [this diminished ability to engage
in traditional activities [also]{.mark} leads to **[loss of
identity]{.mark}** among Indigenous peoples.]{.underline} "For the Saami
in Europe and Russia, some of the most significant health impacts stem
from the adverse effects on mental health arising from stress and
navigating pressures to change their traditional way of life."14)

Leveraging LDOH can help protect the health and wellbeing among Arctic
Indigenous peoples. LDOH are a legal strategy to hold nation-states
accountable to address climate change effects that cause human rights
violations, particularly within the context of UNDRIP. Specifically,
areas in international law including human rights law and law of the sea
-- which are underutilized and often overlooked -- can protect land and
marine resources that are critical for Arctic Indigenous livelihoods.
Areas in [[domestic law]{.mark} too [can **protect resources** that

and cultural activities.]{.underline}

[Native [participation in the **defense of Alaska**]{.mark} would
[provide a powerful unifying force]{.mark}]{.underline}, stimulating the
movement for Native rights as the dynamic social transformation of the
U.S. Civil Rights movement flowed north into Alaska, [cul[minating in
the]{.mark} historic 1971 passage of the **Alaska Native Claims
Settlement Act** ([ANCSA]{.mark}), the pioneering land treaty
[transferring **44 million acres** of land]{.mark} title and \$1 billion
in compensation to Alaska native]{.underline}s, a model embraced and
later enhanced as Inuit land claims were negotiated across the entire
North American Arctic, [with [Inuit gaining]{.mark} title to nearly
[**one-tenth** of their]{.mark} traditional [land]{.mark}
base]{.underline}, and new co-management structures enabling a joint
approach to managing natural resources, land access, and economic
development. (Zellen, 2008) By the time the Inuvialuit of Canada's
Western Arctic settled their land claim in 1984, based on their
Agreement-in-Principle (AiP) negotiated in 1978, they had greatly
advanced the land claims model, favoring Native traditions that ANCSA
had, in its original form, overlooked.

Indeed, the early years of ANCSA implementation were famously described
by former B.C. Supreme Court justice and prominent land rights advocate
Thomas R. Berger as dragging Alaska Natives "kicking and screaming" into
the twentieth century, and many Native corporations approached the brink
of bankruptcy, forced to monetize their net operating losses in a last
desperate bid to stay in business. (Berger, 1985; Zellen, 2008;
Sillanpaa, 1988) A new cottage industry of northern investment, legal,
and policy advisors emerged -- sometimes to the benefit of their
clients, but often not -- a problem that would persist across the entire
Arctic region as land claims transferred large cash settlements to
northern beneficiaries of settled claims. In addition to the
corporatization of village Alaska, ANCSA's original design also had
major structural flaws that nearly proved fatal to the land claims
experience, including a 20-year moratorium in transferring shares in
Native corporations to non-Natives, which many feared would inevitably
result in the dilution of Native ownership, known as the "1991 time
bomb," which necessitated amending the original land claims legislation
in the years that followed. (Sykes et al., 1985; Worl, 1988)

While critics of the land claims process are correct to point out these
original structural flaws and the assimilating pressures introduced by
new corporate structures, [the [land claims]{.mark} model [has]{.mark}
nonetheless [proved **resilient**]{.mark} **and adaptive**, [as Native
corporations]{.mark} **matured and their [boards]{.mark}**, managers and
shareholders found ways to better **[balance]{.mark} [traditional and
modern values]{.mark}**, learning from their crash course in capitalism
as they went]{.underline} -- [so today the Native corporations represent
a **huge economic force** not only in the state of Alaska but across all
of Arctic North America.]{.underline}

[[Rather than **forcibly assimilating**]{.mark} a reluctant Native
community into a new market culture, [Natives]{.mark} instead
**[reimagined]{.mark}** the [land claims]{.mark} model as their own,
[infusing it with]{.mark} a deep commitment to the preservation and
revitalization of [**traditional values** in balance with **economic
modernization**]{.mark}, pushing back against ANCSA at the local,
regional, state, and circumpolar level.]{.underline} Thus the Inuvialuit
land claim which followed ANCSA across the international boundary in
Canada's Western Arctic would entitle the 3,000 Inuvialuit (many recent
descendants of Inupiat settlers) living in six communities to 35,000
square miles of land; co-management of land and water use, wildlife, and
environmental assessment; wildlife harvesting rights; financial
compensation of \$45 million in 1978 dollars (and departing from ANCSA,
inflation-adjusted to a more bountiful \$162 million) for lands ceded to
Canada; a share of government royalties for oil, gas, and mineral
development on federal land; government commitment to meaningful
economic participation in any development in the settlement area; and
the formation of new national parks in the settlement area that further
protected their land base from development, while (also departing from
ANCSA) allowing subsistence activities unhindered (which in turn
inspired the U.S. federal government to finally address, and in essence
federalize, subsistence in its 1980 Alaska National Interest Lands
Conservation Act (ANILCA). (Zellen, 2008)

[[This revised model]{.mark} has [remained]{.mark} largely [intact
in]{.mark} subsequent comprehensive [**land claims**, from]{.mark}
[**Nunavut** to **Nunatsiavut**]{.mark} to the east, and in the many
[**Dene** and **Yukon First Nation**]{.mark} settlement areas to the
south of the Inuit homeland, [showing great endurance]{.mark} as a model
[for **northern development**]{.mark} from which there has been no
retreat.]{.underline} While augmented with new tools for achieving
increasing levels of self-governance, the land claims treaty structure
continues to embrace collaborative (and adaptive) co-management of lands
and resources, and to balance the inherent tensions between market
economies and traditional subsistence.

While constitutionally distinct, the steady evolution from Home Rule to
Self-Rule in Greenland mirrors the achievements of Natives in Alaska and
the Canadian Arctic, leveraging the long and enduring foundation of
economic integration to assert and achieve political gains, and to
strengthen the role of Natives in governing their homeland. The range of
governing institutions has, as a result of this complex jurisdictional
landscape of Arctic North America, proliferated in form and in number:

¬ At the municipal level of government, there is the North Slope Borough
in Alaska, a vast municipality that sustains itself through property
taxation of the Prudhoe Bay oil facilities, a borough larger in size
than many of America's original 13 states that governs a population of
just 6,000---with hundreds of millions of dollars in property taxes to
build world-class infrastructure and provide modern government services
in a region that had historically lacked such essentials as schools and
hospitals; as well as the neighboring Northwest Arctic Borough, with
fewer resources and thus less regional economic development. (NARF,
1975; NARF, 1988)

¬ At the territorial level, there is [[the]{.mark} vast [Nunavut
Territory]{.mark}, governing one-fifth of Canada\'s landmass,
[created]{.mark} [through]{.mark} the **[peaceful secession]{.mark}** of
the Eastern Arctic from the old Northwest Territories]{.underline}, and
home to some 30,000 people, almost entirely Inuit, scattered across 28
villages in an area larger than Western Europe---and a source of much of
Canada\'s future natural resource wealth and strategic waterways.
(Gerhardt, 2011)

¬ And at the tribal/indigenous level, there is [[the Inuit
government]{.mark} of Nunatsiavut in northern Labrador]{.underline},
which has a unique Inuit constitution that governs its 2,000 Inuit
residents living in six villages in a traditional manner, [[**rejecting
a public governance model** in favor of one]{.mark} more distinctively
[tribal in nature]{.mark}]{.underline} (owing to the demographic
predominance of non-Natives in Newfoundland and Labrador, making a
public model inherently risky there in contrast to Nunavut, which enjoys
Inuit demographic predominance)

As shown by these innovations in collaborative northern governance,
[[indigenous culture]{.mark} has [become **increasingly
recognized**]{.mark} not as a fault line of conflict, but [as a]{.mark}
new and **viable [boundary line]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} political
[institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}, providing a foundation for political
stability across regions, transcending national boundaries. The
experience across the Arctic suggests that with foresight and
innovation, and a willingness to redraw political boundaries through a
commitment to the principles of co-management and further jurisdictional
developments (from the establishment of regionally self-governing Native
municipalities like the North Slope Borough to the secession of Nunavut
from the Northwest Territories to create a self-governing Native
territory) to better reflect indigenous identity and fulfill Native
aspirations for autonomy, [it is possible to create stable frontier
region **free of war**, [with]{.mark} durable and [effective mechanisms
for **mediating tribe-state disputes** before they explode into
violent]{.mark} domestic or regional
[conflagrations]{.mark}]{.underline} as we see in other, less
collaborative corners of the world.

#### [Indigenous progress]{.underline} within the state on Arctic issues is [possible]{.underline}.

[By the last decades of the twentieth century, if not before[, it became
clear]{.mark} [that Indigenous peoples]{.mark} and communities [were not
comfortable]{.mark} with a governmentcentric approach to Indigenous
affairs]{.underline}. Canadian authorities opened negotiations on modern
treaties in the early 1970s and, over the following 30 years, signed
agreements with Indigenous peoples across much of the territorial North,
northern Quebec and Labrador. [These sweeping [agreements
provided]{.mark} substantial [cash]{.mark} settlements[, resource
revenue arrangements,]{.mark} Indigenous [roles in]{.mark} environmental
[management]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the approval of natural resource
[projects]{.mark} [and]{.mark}, most importantly, substantial scope for
Indigenous [self-government.]{.mark} Negotiating the treaties took years
and drained Indigenous financial and political resources; implementing
the agreements provided to be a formidable challenge on its own,
[requiring extensive and ongoing engagement with]{.mark} both [the
government and]{.mark} the [court.]{.mark} In Canada, Indigenous people
also won a series of major court victories, particularly the 2004
Supreme Court decisions in Haida and Taku, that gave them sharply
increased authority, under "duty to consult and accommodate" provisions,
over natural resource development on their traditional territories
(Alcantara 2007).]{.underline}

#### Their advocacy is wrong -- indigenous groups have made significant progress within governmental institutions within arctic decision-making that creates a unique avenue for change -- they totalize!

[Perhaps [the most significant]{.mark} long-term [change]{.mark} in
Indigenous affairs in the Far North [rests]{.mark} [with]{.mark}
regional [engagement in policy-making]{.mark}]{.underline}. For
generations, in a classic Arctic manifestation of colonial governance,
policy was developed in southern capitals and imposed, typically with
little or no consultation, on the Indigenous peoples in the North. For
generations, the governance of Arctic, especially in the American
Arctic, regions was marked by neglect or disinterest. After World War
II, welfare-statism took hold, perceived by governments and southern
peoples as acts of generosity and as a commitment to bringing the
Indigenous peoples of the North into the national mainstream. Indigenous
peoples pushed back against the intrusions of the state, but with a
decline in traditional economies and the dislocations associated with
major resource development, population growth and major infrastructure
projects, along with the expansion of southern and international
cultures, brought substantial and external-imposed changes into the
North. [The battle lines were many including stopping or changing
large-scale development, fighting for the recognition of Indigenous
rights, coping with linguistic and cultural change and managing the
aggressiveness and cultural weight of non-Indigenous peoples in the
North.]{.underline} At the same time, in many areas resources were
limited, including an overstretched leadership cadre, few
local-controlled funds and limited government support. [[Paternalism
proved resilient]{.mark} and national governments resisted efforts to
accommodate Indigenous aspirations]{.underline}. Over time, the
combination of Indigenous self-determination, national and international
political developments, growing non-Indigenous support for Indigenous
aspirations and new legal, political and treaty arrangements, as well as
international law, resulted in dramatically different approaches to
Arctic governance and management. Through processes that varied by
country and region, [[Indigenous peoples became more]{.mark} actively
[involved]{.mark} [in]{.mark} issues of national and Indigenous
[governance]{.mark},]{.underline} implying policy influence and
interchange, as well incorporation of indigenous perspectives into
mainstream political arrangements (Broderstad 2014). There were many
aspects to this change, ranging from treaty negotiations,
self-government agreements and self-governance arrangements to
Indigenous educational and training programs, natural resource
management and socio-cultural programming. The central development in
Indigenous governance has been the emergence of the co-production of
policy and political partnerships across the Arctic. From the Arctic
Council, where Indigenous representations work closely with national
government representations, through national and regional government
collaborations with Indigenous authorities, co-production of policy has
emerged as a major force for governance transformation. The concept is
relatively straight-forward. [With the processes varying between
countries, [Indigenous organizations]{.mark} and institutions [work
with]{.mark} national and regional [governments to identify areas for
policy development]{.mark}, [agree]{.mark} [on]{.mark} general
[program]{.mark} and policy [parameters]{.mark}, [develop]{.mark}
collaborative [policy]{.mark}-making and [implementation
processes]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} [monitor]{.mark} the policy
activity.]{.underline} The most successful early examples came largely
in wildlife and land management, but governments increasingly realized
the folly of proceeding without full and sustained indigenous
engagement. In almost all areas of Arctic public policy, from health
care and education to economic development and climate change
initiatives, Indigenous peoples are engaged, to a greater or lesser
extent, on policy design and development. The arrangements are less
pronounced in Russia, where national authority remains extremely strong,
but are central to policy efforts in Greenland and the Canadian North.
Across Scandinavia, the Saami Parliaments in Finland, Norway and Sweden
stand out as prominent political institutions of Saami-state interaction
and enhanced institutionalization. None of the Saami parliaments have
any legislative power. But it is fair to say that the actual influence
of the Norwegian Saami Parliament in relation to national political
institutions is more comprehensive compared to the two Nordic siblings.
In Norway, consultations have become the main mechanism in the
governance of Saami affairs. As emphasized by the Norwegian Saami
Parliament, the right to self-determination is more than the right to be
consulted. Simultaneously, the right to be consulted is a central
element of implementing self-determination on areas affecting both Saami
and others. [[In Alaska]{.mark}, community [engagement is
notable]{.mark} [in]{.mark} areas related to [economic development,
energy infrastructure]{.mark} and education. Across the Arctic, in one
of the most important transitions in recent history, Indigenous peoples
and [communities]{.mark} [have become]{.mark} increasingly
[involved]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the co-development of [public
policy]{.mark} and the general management of government programming.
Colonialism dies hard, as history has shown, and there are profound
policy-making challenges that remain. But [the Far North]{.mark} has
[produced]{.mark}, largely at the insistence of Indigenous
peoples[,]{.mark} [a "lab]{.mark}oratory" [for]{.mark} the
[understanding]{.mark} of Indigenous [re-empowerment]{.mark}. That the
process remains far from complete and quite uneven across the
Circumpolar World, there are promising signs that Indigenous engagement
in policy production and, indeed, the coproduction of Arctic policy at
the regional, national and international levels can produce substantial
improvements in Indigenous conditions.]{.underline}

### Rights=Good---2AC

#### The alt [lacks]{.underline} radical purchase at [best]{.underline} and enables [rampant]{.underline} violence under the decolonial banner at [worst]{.underline}. The rights paradigm is [imperfect]{.underline} but [better]{.underline} than a total break from modernity.

**Chan, 23**---Department of World Politics, Sometime Foundation Dean of
Law and Social Sciences, SOAS University of London (Stephen, "My
decoloniality is not your decoloniality: the new multiverse -- an
opinion piece," Social Dynamics, Volume 49, Issue 2, pp. 369-375, dml)

The term has become a mantra, but "**[decoloniality]{.underline}**" [has
almost **no precise meaning** and is used as an **ideological
trope**]{.underline}. [It points]{.underline} in a "progressive" sense
[towards a **status quo ante**]{.underline}, almost an arcadia descended
from an anti-slavery Victorian regret [that]{.underline} colonialism had
robbed the "native" of his "innocence." That [there was something
**purer** before colonialism]{.underline} and its particular
manifestation of imperial globalism.

It is a term brandished often in African studies, but the imperial
outreach impacted most of the world. And [the status quo ante means many
different things in e.g.]{.underline}, **[China]{.underline}**, [where
the world before European incursion was **very different** to that of
the conglomerated and homogenised]{.underline}
"**[Africa]{.underline}**" of easy discourse, never mind its 2000
languages, ethnic groups, and senses of history.

In a very real sense, the decolonial impulse is a direct descendant of
Postcolonial Studies (PoCo). PoCo had a very precise birthdate -- August
29 1989, at the Silver Jubilee Triennial Conference of the Association
of Commonwealth Literature and Language Studies held at the University
of Kent. Edward Said was the keynote speaker -- in fact, Said rehearsed
many of his chapters for Culture & Imperialism in a lecture series at
Kent --, and Said bluntly asked why a wealth of world literature was
still associated with a grouping many people regarded as both British
and an echo of Empire? At a stroke, Commonwealth Literature was replaced
by Postcolonial Studies -- although it still overwhelmingly meant
literature written in English (Chan Citation2014, 123--131). There was
no commitment to study literature in, e.g., the languages of Africa --
even though in 1984, a full five years earlier, Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o had
rehearsed what became Decolonising the Mind (Wa Thiong'o Citation1986)
in his Robb Lectures at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. Those
lectures and the subsequent book were adamant that only by expressing
oneself in one's own language could what we would now call a "decolonial
self" be uncovered or recovered and expressed. Ngũgĩ thenceforth wrote
in Kikuyu, but Kikuyu is, as noted above, one of 2000 African languages,
and in his own sense 2000 senses of authenticity and ways of thought
expressed by way of language. [A true decolonial project is]{.underline}
thus [one of **immense complexity**]{.underline}, [**navigation** and
**unavoidably**]{.underline}, finally, one of [unwholesome
**hierarchies**]{.underline}. Which of the 2000 might be the most
important?

And can one speak to another without the lacunae of translation? Ngũgĩ's
audience relies on translation. He seems only recently to have been
"discovered" in France and the French translations of his work have
created a sensation (e.g., Boizette Citation2023). But, even without
translation, Ngũgĩ's use in, e.g., Petals of Blood of motifs and lines
drawn directly from Yeats speaks to the need for an internationalism as
a conjoined twin to local authenticity. In the meantime, his Kikuyu
cannot speak to Wole Soyinka's parental tongue of Yoruba, which cannot
speak to the "unknown" Zambian writer Stephen Mpashe's Bemba (unknown
because almost no postcolonial or decolonial scholar reads Bemba)
(Lutato and Primorac Citation2013, 30--31). But, if the world of forced
colonialism created great dislocation and, above all, pain, what moral
speech can be transacted across this world of pain if confined only to a
huge number of separate languages?

[The issue is further complicated by the artefacts of colonialism
adopted as the]{.underline} "**[new authentic]{.underline}**" [to the
point of becoming fully]{.underline} "**[traditional]{.underline}**."
Zambia is constitutionally a Christian nation; its "traditional" female
dress, the wrap chitenge, was introduced by missionaries anxious to
promote female modesty. The "traditional" staple food, nshima, a
maize-based dish, was introduced throughout Southern Africa by white
employers seeking a cheap way of feeding the "natives" who worked for
them. Maize was itself an import, largely replacing the indigenous
millet. [Attack]{.underline} any of [these as]{.underline}
"**[colonial]{.underline}**" [and it is an attack on an authenticity in
a country which **cannot be decolonised** of such things]{.underline}.
And culture does not contain many more basic elements than food,
clothing and religion.

Zambia is in any case a composite country -- composed in part because
the minions of Cecil Rhodes declared it a unified territory. But Kenneth
Kaunda, the founding president of the independent country, sought to
unify the 72 ethnic groups of the country, plus the Indian and white
population, with his own composite ideology -- part "traditional,"
though selectively so, part British social welfare state philosophy, and
part Gandhian. The last as a means of passive but
internationally-supported defence against the depredations of the
aggressive white minority southlands of Rhodesia and Apartheid South
Africa. In declaring a national ideology, Kaunda also sought to speak an
international language to gain allies as he suffered white attacks on
his young country. He achieved a [hybrid postcoloniality]{.underline}
(Chan Citation1992).

Both Lily Ling's "Worlding" and Edward Said's hybrid intersections
[suggest that those once imperialised can **turn the
tables**]{.underline}. **[Ling]{.underline}**, who managed to have an
entire International Studies Association annual conference devoted to
Worlding [simply proposed that the expression of multiple cultural
foundations made the world more cosmopolitan and Western cultural
foundations]{.underline} -- including those that went into normative
theory -- [less hegemonic]{.underline} (Agathangelou and Ling
Citation2009). **[Said]{.underline}**, even in resisting cultural
imperialism, [sought]{.underline} exactly the hybrid [fightback on one's
**own terms**]{.underline}. The emphasis here is on "one's own terms."
[In one's own adaptation and fusion]{.underline}, [including of
**Western thinkers**]{.underline}, canonical or not, [the previously
subordinated create difference in order to stipulate **new terms** to
the previously]{.underline} "**[universal]{.underline}**" (Howe
Citation2006). Christian churches in Zambia, within an amazingly
ecumenical national United Churches of Zambia umbrella -- involving both
established churches and entirely new charismatic ones -- widen the
scope of Christianity, lead the way in terms of gender equality by the
creation of female Bishops and channel tongues and powers of healing
that resemble both those of the apostles in the Biblical book of Acts
and those of many cultural practices and rituals that existed before
Christianity (Gifford Citation1998). In a sense, Christianity has
rendered the "old" and the more fully traditional more acceptable in
modern terms. And more able to assert their place in a nationalism. In
other words, [it does not **decolonise**]{.underline}; [it **reworks**
colonial influences]{.underline} into something that works against the
central colonial ambition of subordination and, indeed, seeks to
influence metropolitan concepts and practices of religion.

Or [to overcome and **establish**]{.underline} a latter-day
[**hegemony** over the metropolitan order with its imperialising and
colonising history]{.underline}. But [is]{.underline} President Xi
Jinping's new **[China]{.underline}**, drawing from values of the past,
[an example of decolonisation at its **most selective** and
**opportunistic**?]{.underline} [**Uighurs** and others might say so as
the past that is celebrated is **rule over other people** by the Han
Chinese]{.underline}. Granted, China feels it has much from which to
emerge -- after its "century of humiliation" by imperial forces, a
century of bitterness (Mitter Citation2004). But it officialises what is
acceptably valuable from the past. The Falun Gong's mixture of Taoism,
Buddhism and Confucianism is not, for example, officially acceptable
(Chan Citation2003, 192--196). And it overlooks pre-Communist efforts to
blend an antiquity with new constructions and even new forms of Western
thought. Even the Tai Ping, which almost overthrew the empire in the
nineteenth century, advocating a self-invented Christian brotherhood and
sisterhood which surmounted an array of local mysticisms, had its own
modernisers (Platt Citation2012). In short, decolonisation required
thought and not the permission, the imprimatur, only of a supreme
leader. But, in terms of what Realist International Relations calls
"high politics," Xi's is a "high decoloniality," one linked with power
and power plays that are transacted both nationally and internationally,
but on the basis of huge modern technology and economic reserves.

[And what about the **Taleban** in Afghanistan?]{.underline} [They claim
not only a **decolonial mission** but one of **absolute** and **mandated
authenticity**]{.underline}. Beginning, in Rashid's (Citation2001)
account, as a rescue mission of kidnapped young women, they have become
a constrainer of the rights, capacities and future development of women.

Similar questions can be asked of female genital mutilation as a pre-
and perhaps decolonial traditional practice. At what stage, and with
what methodology, should a metropolitan feminism intervene?

And, in [the **Russian war against Ukraine**]{.underline}, that too [is
in the name of a **Russian authenticity**]{.underline}, [a **status quo
ante** in the face of a colonial creeping forward of
**NATO**]{.underline}. Vladimir [**Putin's** rhetoric is a decolonial
rhetoric]{.underline} (even if the Ukraine citizens themselves feel it
is imperative to resist a new wave of Russian colonialism).

[Returning to **Africa**]{.underline}, [there is]{.underline} of course
the somewhat wretched example of [the]{.underline} late-nationalist and
[decolonial era of]{.underline} Robert **[Mugabe]{.underline}**, with
its nominal return of land to the people, [**rapidly corrupted** by
oligarchic ownership]{.underline} of the best land, [and the lack of
**modern**]{.underline} agri-industrial and agri-economic [**planning**
making the decolonial project a **disaster**]{.underline} for his people
(Chan Citation2019) -- a disaster perpetuated, only with less style, by
his successor.

The case of Zimbabwe, of which I have written much earlier, sets a
frame, however, for the work of Sabelo Ndlovu-Gatsheni -- best known for
his series of works on epistemology and how ownership of one's thought
is a prerequisite for freedom, i.e., not thought and styles of thinking
imposed by an intellectually hegemonic metropole (Ndlovu-Gatsheni
Citation2018). One would have assumed that he was by default a
decolonialist. Instead, he warns of the trap of easy rhetoric. In his
book, Coloniality of Power in Postcolonial Africa, he warns that there
can be no "authenticity" in the modern world for any nation unless it
knowingly, self-reflectively, immerses itself in the contradictions
between self and other, modernity and tradition, accomplishment and
stagnation (Ndlovu-Gatsheni Citation2022). If I may use the words of the
US poet McClure (Citation1969, opening epigram), "the struggle to it is
DARK BROWN the struggle itself is a solid moving in an inferno ... ,"
and if I may add my own gloss, being turned into liquid shit in the
process. Thus adding a colloquiality that Ndlovu-Gatsheni would not have
used, [the work of authenticity is]{.underline}, in more pedestrian
words, **[messy]{.underline}**. And even more so [in a world of power
politics and a myriad exploitations and dependencies]{.underline} --
[each different]{.underline}, [so that the condition of]{.underline}
exploitation and dependency of [the **Solomon Islands**]{.underline},
flung across the South Pacific, [is different to that of
the]{.underline} landlocked **[Central African Republic]{.underline}**.
[But **both**]{.underline} the Solomon Islands and the Central African
Republic [would like to speak one day in a **common language** of
accomplishment and the transcending of dependency]{.underline} -- [to
speak]{.underline}, in short, [a **normative language**]{.underline}.

But to speak norms in ways that were not first coined by Immanuel Kant.
The "categorical imperative" of Recht, an overarching realm of cosmic
natural justice, has parallels in every realm with a history of cosmic
imagination. [A **human right** can be drawn into being in a way
**unimagined** by normative thinkers of the West]{.underline}. Freedom
from an unjust emperor in China was every bit as courageous both in
thought and deed as any uprising against a dictator in Europe. [The
**ultimate decoloniality**]{.underline}, if you like, [is a horizontal
global society with values that **bind across the board**]{.underline}
but spoken and thought like the Tower of Babel. And, in dealing with
contradictions, hybridity becomes the condition of a non-pastoral
non-Arcadian decoloniality.

In short there is no "authenticity" in any case without re-creation in
an unavoidable epoch of modernisation and modernism. Hybridity is built
into existence. But [the case for non-hegemony means also a **world of
nation-states** and people in an **acknowledged horizontal
equality**]{.underline}. In that equal space, differences and wonders
can grow, but communication, transactions and commonality can as well.
Commonality, but not universality.

[That re-creation must work **with** peaceful modernity]{.underline},
[not seek licence for **death** and **slaughter**]{.underline} as in the
modern wars of Liberia, with the re-creation of poro as a ritual of
invulnerability and its permission to kill others not invulnerable --
all [mixed with the modernity of **assault rifles**]{.underline},
[**artillery** and **motorised transport**]{.underline}. This recipe for
terror applied also to some female fighters as well as male ones (Ellis
Citation1999).

So [the task of the future is to seek the common language
of]{.underline} values, of **[rights]{.underline}**. [But this language
can itself be **hybrid**]{.underline}. My PhD student from Botswana,
Alice Mogwe, won the Friedrich-Ebert-Stiftung Prize for Human Rights in
2021 for her leadership of both international and Botswanan human rights
(SOAS Citation2021). She is known for her work in gender equality and
the rights of those with sexual preferences that are not part of a
Tswana mainstream. But the language used in Botswana by Mogwe is [not
only drawn from the vocabulary of **Western**]{.underline} LGBT+
**[rights]{.underline}**, [but from]{.underline} Tswana **[traditional
discourses]{.underline}** on tolerance, plurality and acceptance
(CitationMogwe ongoing). The vocabulary is as dense as anything in
Western discourse on such issues -- but is almost wholly unknown in the
West; while Western non-governmental aid donors to civil society
organisations in Botswana insist upon the use of Western vocabulary.
[The situation of a **reverse insistence**]{.underline}, that the donors
must learn several thousand vocabularies from many countries in order
[to claim decoloniality in what **necessarily** remains a **hierarchical
relationship**]{.underline} -- someone has money to give and someone
doesn't -- [is addressed]{.underline}, if not fully satisfied, [by an
acceptance of]{.underline} hybridity in vocabulary and [a **commonality
of values** even if differently conceived and expressed]{.underline}.

Legal milestones: Significant, but fragile

[For decades, Inuit communities have warned global governments of the
existential threats that they face---threats that also have global
repercussions. For example, [**Inuit organizations play a key role in
international efforts**]{.mark} seeking [to regulate chemical
substances]{.mark}, [including]{.mark} the [**Stockholm** **and Minamata
Conventions**]{.mark}, as well as the [**Arctic Council**]{.mark} and
the [**International** **Maritime Organization**.
]{.mark}]{.underline}Thanks to their historic and contemporary efforts,
as well as the [broader [mobilization of Indigenous and allied
voices]{.mark} across the country, [we are beginning to see meaningful
shifts in]{.mark} how [laws]{.mark} are developed,]{.underline}
especially in terms of whose voices are included in decision-making
processes. [In a notable step forward, [Canada passed its first
environmental justice law]{.mark} last year. This law [provides a
crucial tool for advancing]{.mark} the [wellbeing of Arctic
communities]{.mark} by [requiring]{.mark} that [environmental decisions
made by the]{.mark} Canadian [government take into account local
realities, Indigenous knowledge and]{.mark} the [systemic
inequalities]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}that affect health, food
security and the broader human environment. Another [significant victory
for the [right to a healthy environment]{.mark} was [recently secured
through]{.mark} the [Canadian Environmental Protection Act]{.mark}. For
Arctic communities, the [recognition]{.mark} of this right [under
federal law provides]{.mark} a [critical legal foundation to demand
environmental policies]{.mark} and programs [that reflect]{.mark} their
[unique living conditions]{.mark}]{.underline}, address the persistent
pollution threatening their health and the need to protect the
ecosystems their ways of life depend on. [[Through]{.mark} this
[legislative reform]{.mark}, [the federal government has]{.mark} also
[acknowledged]{.mark} that [certain communities]{.mark}---[especially
Indigenous]{.mark}, racialized and remote ones---[are disproportionately
affected]{.mark} by environmental damage.]{.underline} While imperfect
and still insufficient, these changes to the law pave the way for a more
equitable transformation of our public policy. [**[The Arctic must be
fully included in]{.mark} -- [and benefit from]{.mark} -- this [evolving
legal landscape]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Whether in terms of plastic
pollution, chemical pollution, climate change or biodiversity loss,
Arctic communities experience a disproportionate share of the
environmental harms. **[These [legislative reforms can]{.mark} and must
[be leveraged to protect the North's]{.mark} fragile
[ecosystems]{.mark}, [uphold]{.mark} the [rights of Indigenous Peoples
and support communities]{.mark} in their fight against environmental and
climate injustice.]{.underline}**

The role of research in building justice

[[Researchers have a vital role to play]{.mark} in this
context.]{.underline} By documenting environmental inequalities,
generating localized data and centering Indigenous knowledge, [[research
conducted in true partnership]{.mark} with Indigenous communities [can
serve as a powerful catalyst for advocacy]{.mark}, policy change and
transformative action. By [drawing on new **legal frameworks**]{.mark}
such as the environmental justice law or the right to a healthy
environment, scientists **[can help shape public policy]{.mark}**,
**support [community-led advocacy and co-develop]{.mark}**
**[solutions]{.mark} grounded in the lived realities of the
North**.]{.underline}

[[Inuit are in the best position to inform the world of]{.mark} the ways
in which [climate change]{.mark} is impacting their
homeland]{.underline}. The relationship to and understanding of the land
that accompanies thousands of years of living sustainably in the Arctic
is a perspective that Inuit hold, and one that is vital to our
international understanding of how to approach Arctic governance. In
Canada, [[Inuit]{.mark} have [achieved considerable ability to
participate in governance]{.mark} on the matters that affect them most.
This has [culminated over decades of Inuit determination to be included
in]{.mark} these [policy]{.mark} and governance
[matters]{.mark}.]{.underline} This [level of **[engagement between
Inuit and the Government]{.mark} of Canada, facilitated by these Inuit
organizations, [shows how powerful and effective]{.mark} Indigenous
[organizations can be in achieving]{.mark} Indigenous
[self-determination]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Of course, the nation-state
also has to be willing to engage with these organizations, in this case
being the Government of Canada. [[Canada]{.mark} has recently
[shown]{.mark} their [commitment to work with Indigenous groups
in Canada's Arctic and Northern Policy
Framework]{.mark}]{.underline}[ ]{.mark}(2019). This level of commitment
towards collaboration does not exist in every nation-state around the
world, often making it difficult for Indigenous organizations to achieve
the level of collaboration they desire. Nonetheless, [this example of
[collaboration between Inuit and the Government]{.mark} of Canada
[demonstrates]{.mark} the [decision-making capabilities that]{.mark} can
[arise]{.mark} out of Indigenous organizations' fight towards
self-determination.]{.underline} At the international level,
[[Inuit]{.mark} have been [involved in policymaking through]{.mark} the
[Inuit Circumpolar Council]{.mark}, a [Permanent Participant on]{.mark}
the most influential governing body for the circumpolar region, [the
Arctic Council.]{.mark}]{.underline} At the state level in Canada,
[Inuit have been [involved in policymaking through the Inuit Tapiriit
Kanatami]{.mark}, the national association for Inuit in
Canada.]{.underline} Finally, the four Inuit land claim agreements that
exist in Canada have also contributed greatly to Inuit ability to
participate in policymaking and governance decisions affecting the

These [**Inuit [organizations are excellent examples of]{.mark} the

create and develop policy solutions for the issues that they understand
best. [These representative organizations and the reports they create

[[Law]{.mark} in general [and indigenous law]{.mark} in particular
[have]{.mark} a niche and [significant role to play when it comes
to]{.mark} various [issues and developments in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}, but without real advocates and competent
bearers of this knowledge, \"first of all among indigenous peoples
themselves, it is challenging for a dominant national legal culture to
become more flexible and inclusive of indigenous law. [Important
questions in the many years ahead would be: how law (both indigenous and
State) and legal systems could assist in dealing with current and
emergent challenges and opportunities in the North]{.underline}? How
these legal systems and customary/indigenous law practices are efficient
and legitimate in the eyes of Northerners (both indigenous and other
residents)? How existing pluralism and co-existence of indigenous and
non-indigenous law practices can contribute to the resolution of issues
of common concern in the Arctic? In other words, [more **[legal
cooperation and understanding]{.mark} of [indigenous law]{.mark} and its
workability [with]{.mark} national [legal systems is required to fill in
knowledge gaps and find plausible solutions to]{.mark} the many [issues
and challenges of Arctic developments]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Canadian
experience of the Inuit of Eastern and Central Arctic shows that [the
[national legal system can learn a lot from indigenous forms of dispute
resolution]{.mark} and a more inquisitorial manner of dealing with the
judicial process; [it can]{.mark} also [show]{.mark} more [flexibility
in ensuring]{.mark} the [harmonious co-existence of both "Western" and
indigenous legal traditions]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Both national and
[indigenous legal systems could]{.mark} further [learn from each
other,]{.mark} so as further actions may be required to ensure the
continuity, rejuvenation and revitalization of indigenous law in the
existing legal thinking and practicing.44]{.underline}

On 10 September 2019, Canada's Liberal government quietly released its
long-awaited Arctic and Northern Policy Framework (ANPF). After four
years of development, the document appeared on the Crown-Indigenous
Relations and Northern Affairs website. It included no photos, maps, or
even a downloadable pdf -- just a wave of words, over 17,000 in the main
chapter alone. The single infographic that accompanied the framework's
release captured its main "highlights": [that a
"whole-of-**[government]{.mark}**, **[co-development]{.mark}**" process
that created the [framework]{.mark} [involved]{.mark} the three
territorial governments, [over **25 Indigenous organizations**]{.mark},
as well as three provincial governments. 1 This collaborative process
[represents]{.mark} the "[**profound change** of direction]{.mark}" that
the Government of Canada highlights]{.underline} in the opening sentence
of the ANPF. 3 Iqaluit Mayor Madeleine Redfern noted how "the [framework
speaks to the fact that we need to be [more **collaborative**]{.mark},
[more **strategic**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It's not a strategy per se,
other than to say we need to actually be working together."2 The
government's emphasis on collaborative governance recognizes that when
Ottawa has defined problems facing the North incorrectly or has set the
wrong priorities, with little consultation from Northerners, policy
responses have been shortsighted and ineffective. While critics have
lauded the process involved in co-developing the framework, they have
questioned the hasty release of what seems to be a partially-developed
document, coming just a day before the federal government announced
Canada's 2019 federal election. The ANPF appeared with no budget,
timelines, or clear plan to address the wide array of challenges and
issues identified. Critics have labelled the Arctic Yearbook 2019
Kikkert & Lackenbauer 2 framework a "half-baked" and "chaotic mess"4
that simply lists well-known issues and gives "lip service to addressing
the problems,"5 [while providing no "concrete" plan for action. 6 The
ANPF [highlights]{.mark} many [well-known issues]{.mark} that
Northerners have identified for years, [including]{.mark} **[climate
change]{.mark}** impacts, [food insecurity]{.mark},
**[poverty]{.mark}**, **[health inequalities]{.mark}**, and [housing
shortages]{.mark}. It is useful in [reinforcing]{.mark} **[common
understandings]{.mark}** of these problems [with]{.mark} those most
affected, reiterating the importance of these issues to the general
Canadian public, and setting **[priorities]{.mark} [for federal
policy]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [The framework also points out that the
**[government]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} its **[Indigenous]{.mark}** and
territorial [partners]{.mark} have already [acted]{.mark} [on]{.mark}
some of the [challenges]{.mark} and opportunities [identified]{.mark}
during the long co-development process -- particularly [through]{.mark}
[innovative]{.mark} [and]{.mark} unique **[community-based
initiatives]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The ANPF's expressed objective,
however, is to provide a "roadmap" to [[achieve]{.mark} the "**[shared
vision]{.mark}**" co-developed by the groups involved in the process. If
this is a roadmap, it is one with few clear directions -- a map
[that]{.mark} [identifies]{.mark} [hazards, problems, and
opportunities]{.mark}]{.underline}, but does little to illuminate how
the federal government will work practically with its partners
[[to]{.mark} [navigate]{.mark} the complex terrain around **[myriad
Arctic policy]{.mark}** [priorities]{.mark} [and]{.mark} seemingly
**[intractable political dilemmas]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

### State=Good---2AC---Generic

#### Anti-statism performs an [ethical]{.underline} and [existential failure]{.underline} by abandoning the [ethical pursuit of revolutionary power]{.underline} through the [nation-state]{.underline}.

Humanities Review 71 (May 2023), dml) \[language modifications denoted

A Western turn away from internationalism and towards critiques of power
cannot be traced back to a single point: one cannot place it simply as a
result of, say, the New Left insurgencies, Foucault or indeed fractures
within or around the Soviet or Sino-Soviet projects. In our time [a
**great [contradiction]{.mark}** [has arisen between]{.mark} ethical
minoritarianism]{.underline}, in itself not a bad thing, [and [any
notion of commanding the]{.mark} **machinery of [state]{.mark}** through
which some]{.underline}, but not all, [of these ethical conundrums can
be resolved]{.underline}. [[To frame]{.underline}]{.mark} the climate
[[crisis through the lens of **individual**]{.mark} or even
**generational** guilt and argue it should be addressed through an
[**ethics of care** risks **obscuring**]{.mark} both [its]{.mark}
material and historical [**foundations** and]{.mark} its potential
**[remedies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. John Frow, writing on the 'agents'
that hold some power over the 'transmission of a world' laments that
they are 'nation states, political parties, ... and only in the last
instance a citizenry with a stake in a future world' (26). Yet [it is
**vital** at this juncture that we **do not abandon** the idea of a
**nation** with a responsibility]{.underline} for its citizenry, or a
political party with responsibility [for the **future**]{.underline}.
[The globe is **not solely constituted** by]{.underline} multi-party
[democracies held hostage to fossil capital with a disenfranchised and
economically privileged citizenry]{.underline}. [In]{.underline} those
[other nations]{.underline}---marginalised and blacklisted as they might
be by Northern centres of capital and imperial power---[there are
**models worth considering**]{.underline}.

A [hostility to states and nations]{.underline}, while understandable in
the specific Australian sub-imperialist context, [**does not hold up**
to theoretical scrutiny if our horizon is equality]{.underline}: global,
intergenerational and otherwise. Samir Amin, for instance, notes how
[an]{.underline} '"**[[anti-state]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
[strategy]{.underline}' [[unites]{.mark} **perfectly** [with the
capitalist]{.mark}'s strategy [to **reduce** actions]{.mark} by the
state to **[redistribute wealth]{.mark}** and **regulate
corporations**]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} instead [**reduce** the
state's role to its **policing** functions]{.mark}]{.underline} (27). At
this late stage of ecological catastrophe, [the **mass
[extinctions]{.mark}** and **depredations** of our
**planet**]{.underline} under capitalism [[demand]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[as an **ethical imperative**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [**large-scale
[changes]{.mark}** [that can be **only**]{.mark} enacted [on the level
of the **state**]{.mark} and **international blocs** [with]{.mark}
sufficient **organisational [capacity]{.mark}** [and **drive**]{.mark}
to bring such changes to fruition]{.underline}. Likewise, [a total
**antagonism** to]{.underline} '**[nation]{.underline}**' **[does not
get us anywhere]{.underline}**. Expressions of Australian nationalism
typically operate along state-sanctioned lines and celebrate invasion,
colonisation and genocide. This is because Australia is not
Indigenous-led, and because it remains, in real economic and political
terms, shackled to an old empire (Britain) and dependent on the new one
(the United States). However, [to have a **wider view**]{.underline},
[informed by the **histories** of anti-imperialism and decolonisation in
**Asia**]{.underline}, [**Africa** and **Latin America**]{.underline},
[is to be aware of the **crucial role** of national liberation movements
in successful struggles against colonial rule]{.underline}. [Nation can
be the **only thing** that stands between a group of people and their
exploitation by imperialist powers]{.underline}. [[Nations can be
**revolutionary**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[such as]{.mark} the national
liberation fronts in **[Southern Africa]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[[nations can be **Indigenous**]{.underline}, [as with **First
Nations**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [A discourse without sufficient nuance
on the question of nation **ignores** how]{.underline}, [in contemporary
geopolitics]{.underline}, [it is [on the level of **nation**]{.mark}
that military and economic [imperialist endeavours are met with the
**most**]{.mark} **significant [resistance]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[Being]{.mark} unequivocally [against nation]{.mark}]{.underline}, to
quote Amin, '[[encourages]{.mark} the [**acceptance** of]{.mark} the
role of [the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[as]{.mark} **military superpower**
and **[world policeman]{.mark}**]{.underline}' (27).

Unfortunately, the fall of the USSR and [historical
mistakes]{.underline} of socialism [have encouraged]{.underline},
generally speaking, a [drawing inward]{.underline} among Western
leftists, [towards **individual ethics** and away from the **ethical
pursuit of power**]{.underline}. The turn of the left away from
international solidarity and towards capitalism and compromise can be
read sociologically. Radhika Desai notes how the major parties of the
left within bourgeois capitalist states are today commandeered by a
professional managerial class of neoliberal converts, whereas their
counterparts in earlier eras had been socialists and Marxists. The
result is a left that mistakenly 'attributes the prosperity of the major
capitalist powers to capitalism's productive vigour, not their
imperialism, and refuses to contemplate how to organise production in
socialist societies and how to do so against the inevitable opposition
of imperialism's remaining bastions' (Desai). [Comprehending the
**textures** of imperialism is **key**]{.underline} here. [[If we
view]{.mark} the world [**solely** through]{.mark} a lens cut by [the
**US**]{.mark} **imperial core**]{.underline}, [[we
will]{.underline}]{.mark} be blind to
\[**[[ignore]{.underline}]{.mark}**\] [geopolitical material forces and
[context]{.mark}]{.underline}, [we will not]{.underline} see
\[[know]{.underline}\] [[what empire **does**]{.mark} nor will we
comprehend [the **alternatives**]{.mark} outside it]{.underline}. [If we
**actually want transformation** within]{.underline} Australia and [the
centres of imperial capital]{.underline} it subordinates itself to, [it
is **imperative** to look and learn from **alternative models** being
practiced in the world]{.underline}. [At the very least [we can learn
**what not to do**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and recognise the **vast
difficulties** of the challenge ahead]{.underline}. [[For]{.mark} the
sake of [the **planet** and our **species**]{.mark} we need to
ask]{.underline}: what is it that we can learn from countries that in
their post-revolutionary phases have not only built barricades of
resistance to the US world order, but also made significant achievements
at home? [Is]{.underline} intergenerational [justice possible
**without** geopolitical materialism?]{.underline}

#### The permutation solves---indigenous groups want utilization of UAVs specifically.

[Results Consultation and purposes The [communities]{.mark} of Surama
and Wowetta [enthusiastically embraced the]{.mark} opportunity to
introduce [UAVs]{.mark} to their skies.]{.underline} In both villages,
there were requests to see the UAVs fly, but beyond that, the leadership
was quick to identify the potential benefits of natural resource
management and forest cover change monitoring that the aerial
perspective could bring. [Both Surama and Wowetta identified two persons
to work [in building]{.mark} the UAVs [and collect data]{.mark}
[on]{.mark} their [lands]{.mark}. Data collection [is]{.mark} currently
[ongoing]{.mark} in both villages. Community members noted that UAV
[imagery can be useful in]{.mark} natural [resource management]{.mark},
with particular reference to measuring the amount of forest under
various uses by the village, mapping forest degradation, deforestation,
and reforestation.]{.underline} Most critical, in light of the recent El
Nino event, village members also expressed a desire to measure the areas
currently covered by their farms and the types of crops being grown in
their village. Communities also expressed the desire to estimate the
productivity of their crops each year so that they can be ready for
natural disasters. [Further, [communities]{.mark} [noted]{.mark} that
spatial [data]{.mark} and imagery could be [useful]{.mark} [in]{.mark}
planning their village's development, including making
[decisions]{.mark} on where to site future buildings, and forests to be
used for various purposes, including in REDD+. UAV building]{.underline}
We found that using the videos downloaded from www.youtube.com was a
very effective training method to build UAVs. [Once the videos were
viewed, and all of the materials for building the UAV were provided to
the trainees, they assembled their new UAVs in around 8 h.]{.underline}
The resulting craft was tested and used to fly missions in both
villages. Mission planning and imagery collection Using the Mission
Planner software and the pre-loaded Landsat imagery was not an option in
our case. Whereas in coastal Guyana the high-resolution imagery allowed
for details on the ground to be collected and used in setting up flight
plans, the coarse-scale imagery available for the Rupununi meant we
needed to rely on the GPS to develop missions. Nevertheless, missions
were planned for two farms in each village at two stages of growth: new
farm and 1 year old farm (Fig. 2). The new farms represented areas that
are currently under cultivation and were cut in 2016. The 1 year old
farms were cut in 2015 and are currently being fallowed. As the goal of
the larger project is to develop a timeseries of imagery showing change
in indigenous farms, these two farms, in the respective villages, will
serve as the baseline for future analysis. [In addition, [as we]{.mark}
continue to [operate]{.mark} UAVs in the villages [the users will become
more familiar]{.mark} with UAV technology and gain a greater
understanding of how they may be useful to their
livelihoods]{.underline}. A key point to note is that [when the
participants collect data on their missions, they have the first access
to these, and can decide whether to share the data with the
non-indigenous project team members]{.underline}. [With spatially
referenced data in hand, they can begin to take measurements of crops
and make estimates of future productivity in times of unfavorable
weather.]{.underline} Second, as the landscape for forest management
changes in Guyana, indigenous lands are becoming more important for a
number of reasons, including the LCDS. The LCDS opt-in mechanism (Office
of the President 2010) will allow communities to use their forests for
payment for ecosystem services, and this promises to bring benefits to
communities, but they need to be prepared for this reality. The LCDS
will mean that there is a need for a greater accounting of changes in
forest cover, with deforestation, degradation, and reforestation to be
measured at temporal resolutions not currently possible, and certainly
not financially feasible, using satellite platforms. [[Indigenous
communities recognize]{.mark} the [flexibility]{.mark} and agility
[associated with UAV]{.mark} data collection, and how such data can help
them to keep track of finer-scale land-use and land-cover changes.
Third, the aerial perspective will allow indigenous peoples to better
appreciate their relationship with fauna and flora within the swidden
agriculture plots.]{.underline} As we see in Fig. 2, as a part of the
swidden agriculture process, various tree bole are not converted to
ashes in the land clearing process. These boles become important
habitats for the agouti and other rodents that are important to the
ecosystems crafted by indigenous peoples and fauna. Similarly, multiple
trees killed during fire become important habitats for birds that play
important roles in seed dispersal. Lastly, although preliminary, we are
collecting the data to track the progression from farm to tree fallow
and this will be important for other processes, such as studying
secondary successional rates and understanding which species of plants
occupy various seral stages. This is an exciting new avenue that is
unfolding and it will shed light on how swidden agriculture plots shape
the ecology of forests around indigenous people's lands. [The fact that
[communities own the data collected]{.mark} from UAVs [is an important
point]{.mark} and one that will allow communities to guard against the
release of data that they do not approve.]{.underline} Given that UAVs
are being used to open up new directions in natural resource management
research (e.g., Shahbazi et al. 2014) we hope that this paper and the
steps we took to engage indigenous peoples will inspire additional and
similar projects. [In the future, we will continue to collect data from
the field to examine how forest gaps are being filled by vegetation and
we will make inferences for a number of important processes, including
carbon sequestration, and habitat suitability for wildlife and fauna
alike.]{.underline} We hope to encourage researchers to continue
exploring how UAVs can be used to study indigenous lands with the goal
of allowing the inhabitants to successfully protect their cultural
practices while simultaneously securing their livelihoods.

53 1958-1982: Three United Nations Conventions on the Law of the Sea
UNCLOS I & II (1958-60) and UNCLOS III (1973-1982 ) Vested national
interests played a central role in pushing for an international
agreement on ocean governance largely from countries determined to their
own interests in maintaining exclusive control over its own coastal
waters while also having right to the high seas. Based on the desires of
countries to claim ocean space, the [focus of the first UNCLOS was to
"examine the **law of the sea**, taking account not only of the legal
but also of the technical, **biological**, economic and political
aspects of the problem and to embody the results of its work in one or
more **international conventions**]{.underline}". 163 Diplomats from 86
countries participated in the conference in Geneva. The conference
started in February and lasted 3 months. Given the scope of the UNCLOS
I, work was divided among five committees that produce 4 different
agreements each pertaining to a different part of the ocean. First, The
Convention on the Continental Shelf which codified the Truman
proclamations through its definition of the continental shelf as "the
[seabed and subsoil of the submarine areas adjacent to the coast but
outside the area of the territorial sea, to a depth of 200 metres or,
beyond that limit, to where the depth of the **superjacent waters**
admits of the exploitation of the natural resources of the said
areas]{.underline}". 164 An important aspect of this definition was the
focus on the [limitations of technology to the definition of the extent
of the continental shelf.]{.underline} This would become a significant
issue as technology evolved over the next several decades to exploit
virtually every part of the ocean's seabed. 165 Second, UNCLOS I
addressed the issue of the freedom of the seas in the Convention on the
High Seas. Defined as the area beyond the contiguous zone, the high seas
were open for use by coastal and non-coastal states could exercise:
(1)Freedom of navigation; (2)Freedom of fishing; (3)Freedom to lay 163
United Nations, "Resolution 1105 (XI) of the General Assembly of the
United Nations Convening the Conference," 1958. 164 International Law
Commission, "Convention on the Continental Shelf" (United Nations &
International Law Commission, 1958). 165 Castillo and Caminos, Law of
the Sea. 54 submarine cables and pipelines;(4)Freedom to fly over the
high seas". 166 In addition to this, the convention highlights, although
vaguely, the rights for arrest, seizure of property and defines specific
rules regarding piracy, pollution, and violent conflict of warships. The
sister convention of the agreement on the high seas pertained to
fishing: the Convention on Fishing and Conservation of the Living
Resources of the High Seas. Shorter than the others, this treaty briefly
outlines those states are entitled to fish on the high seas if they are
not in violation of any other treaty or disregarding scientific evidence
that would indicate environmental harm was being done. 167 The document
also provides a rough framework for the settlement of disputes regarding
fishing rights. Although the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the
Contiguous Zone would prove to be the most problematic of the 1958
treaties, the issue of living resources on the high seas would become a
growing problem and remains to be addressed presently. Finally, and most
importantly, the Convention on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous
Zone designated the extent and terms of coastal state sovereignty. The
territorial sea was a space where coastal states exercised complete
control over the pelagic and benthic resources following the rules of
international law. 168 Jurisdiction also extended to airspace. The
single exception to this control was bypassed only vessels exercising
their right of innocent passage which allowed them to transit through
the space peacefully if they performed no other actions but passage. 169
An important component of innocent passage required submarines to
surface and display their flag. The contiguous zone was the second
element of this convention and echoed the decisions of the ILC in 1955:
"a zone of the high seas contiguous to its territorial sea, the coastal
State may exercise the control necessary to: "(a)Prevent infringement of
its customs, fiscal, immigration or sanitary regulations within its
territory or territorial sea; (b)Punish infringement of the 166
International Law Commission, "Convention on the High Seas" (United
Nations and International Law Commission, 1958). 167 International Law
Commission, "Convention on Fishing and Conservation of the Living
Resources of the High Seas" (United Nations & International Law
Commission, 1958). 168 International Law Commission, "Convention on the

International Law Commission, 1958). 169 International Law Commission.
55 above regulations committed within its territory or territorial
sea.". 170 A final condition clarified that this limit could only extend
12 nautical miles from shore. However, this convention failed to reach
agreement on an important factor: the extent of the territorial sea.
While most states observed the 3-mile limit, proposals ranged from 3-12
miles. Larger, naval powers proposed narrower territorial limits largely
due to their ability to exercise sovereignty while smaller states tried
to extend their power as much as possible. 171 The result was a
frustrating stalemate that evaded a conclusion. The four parts of UNCLOS
I entered into force between 1962 and 1966. The slow process was due to
a brief and unsuccessful UNCLOS II meeting. The conference had a narrow
focus: resolve the two inconclusive issues of the extent of territorial
seas and the lack of decision regarding exclusive fisheries zones. 172
Once again, states could not reach an agreement on the extent of
territorial seas and the United States came under fire for its
conservative proposals on extent of sovereignty. Even after compromising
on a more generous limit with the Canadians, the US-Canadian solution
failed to pass by one vote. The U.S. was unable to obtain approval to
continue negotiations, the meeting concluded after only six weeks and
reached no new conclusions. Following UNCLOS II there was little
incentive to reach a global agreement regarding coastal ocean
sovereignty and exclusive fisheries rights. This did not stop the
cascading consequences of the Truman proclamations: coastal states
continued to assert and expand claims to territorial waters and
exclusive fisheries zones. Regional agreements also became frequent. For
example, the Declaration of Santo between Latin American and Caribbean
states extended claims fishing rights to 200 miles. 173 These expansions
were especially concerning regarding territorial seas where states held
full sovereignty. This 170 International Law Commission. 171 Liam

173 Juda, International Law and Ocean Use Management. 56 meant that any
foreign flagged vessel had announce its presence, fly its flag, and
request innocent passage. 174 UNCLOS I had attempted to reduce the
clutter of varying claims to ocean space but a decade after the treaty
entered into force, competing regional declarations, jurisdictions and
varying perspectives on maritime law were once again a concern. Disputes
came to a head in 1973 when there was another universal call to revise
the law of the sea convention. Compared to its two predecessors, UNCLOS
III was a monumental event in both scope and in its effectiveness. The
conference brought together representatives of 150 countries and
demonstrated that the law of the sea could evolve based on the observed
pitfalls and voids in its present state. Most importantly, taking note
from the Hague Codification Conference of 1930 and tribunals like the
International Court of Justice created post World War II, UNCLOS III
created unbiased bodies to resolve conflicting interests and regulate
ocean use. 175 However, the successful drafting and refining of all
terms came at a price: UNCLOS III required nine years of continuous
negation before its completion in 1982. The Components of UNCLOS III
With 17 parts, 320 articles and nine annexes, UNCLOS is a sprawling body
of work considered as the sum of all three conventions and negotiations
between 1958 and 1982. 176 Large and complex the focus of UNCLOS can be
summarized as the legal body that determines the governance of coastal
ocean space and the high seas. Other issues pertaining beyond the
surface ocean and the water column are distributed among the supporting
bodies of the system. The International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea
(ITLOS) is tasked with peaceful resolution of international conflict.

simply "the Area" beyond the continental shelf. Finally, the Commission
on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) is focused on the
evaluation of the claims to related to the expansion of ocean
sovereignty based on the nature of the seafloor. Although UNCLOS carries
the name of the United Nations, the UN does not have any major
functional role in the execution of the treaty. Instead, UNCLOS exists
independently and largely depends on the three legal bodies established
with its foundation. Beyond this, it straddles a space between the
jurisdiction of the OLC and the Office of Legal Affairs (OLA), subsets
of the United Nations system. The primary focus of UNCLOS III was to
address the problematic codification of rules on the sovereignty of
ocean space. At its core, the treaty consolidates all four of the
treaties of UNCLOS I under a single agreement while adding a significant
number of details to each to ensure better enforcement. Broadly, of the
seventeen parts of the agreement, half are dedicated to the different
ocean zones and the rights of states to their use and their resources.
These zones can be divided in to two types: (1) control of the water
column and (2) control and access to the seabed. The two major
evolutions concern the areas where the second convention on the law of
the sea fell short. By the time of the third convention on the law of
the sea, most coastal states had adopted a 12-mile territorial sea. As a
result, the addition of Article 3 in Part 2, Territorial Seas, of UNCLOS
III codified this general trend finally establishing a universal
territorial sea limit at 12 nautical miles from short (Figure 2). The
next significant evolution was the specification of the extent of claims
on economic resources, i.e., fisheries and the continental shelf. 177
First, the continental shelf was defined as "the seabed and subsoil of
the submarine areas that extend beyond its territorial sea throughout
the natural prolongation of its land territory to the outer edge of the
continental margin, or to a distance of 200 nautical miles from the
baseline". 178 Then, drawing heavily on the issues regarding fisheries
as well as The Convention on Fishing and Conservation of the Living
Resources of the High Seas of 1958, Part V of the treaty established the
177 United Nations, United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. 178
United Nations. 58 Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). Through Article 57,
the EEZ of each coastal state "shall not extend beyond 200 nautical
miles from the baselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea
is measured." (Figure 2). 179 Both limits followed the precedent set by
the Declaration of Santo regarding fisheries and were intensely
supported by the United States which sought to protect exclusive access
to both its benthic and pelagic resources.. 180 Part V provided states
with "sovereign rights for the purpose of exploring and exploiting,
conserving and managing the natural resources, whether living or
non-living". 181 Beyond these limits, the remainder of the oceans are
governed by the freedom of the seas and considered the "common heritage
of humankind". This space is divided into the pelagic space, the high
seas, and the benthic space, the abyssal plains also referred to as "the
Area" (Figure 2). The governance of the high seas evolved little from
1958, leaving regulations vague. The Area was a response to the
developing technologies for deep sea exploration and exploitation of
valuable metals and minerals beyond the continental shelf. Unlike the
high seas, the Area received it's an independent council to oversee and
approve use. The third convention on the Law of the Sea made another
significant step forward in ocean governance compared to its
predecessors: the convention established two independent councils to
interpret, evaluation and enforce the law of the sea. These legislative
bodies were established specifically to administer the law of the sea
and regulate the use of benthic space. First, and most important,
created by Annex VI, the International Tribunal on the Law of the Sea
(ITLOS). Situated in Hamburg, ITLOS is "composed of a body of 21
independent members, elected from among persons enjoying the highest
reputation for fairness and integrity and of recognized competence in
the field of the law of the sea.". 182 A series of articles is dedicated
to ensuring this body remains as unbiased and diverse as possible to
ensure fair judgement. The jurisdiction of the tribunal regards "The
jurisdiction of the Tribunal comprises all 179 United Nations. 180 Juda,
International Law and Ocean Use Management. 181 United Nations, United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. 182 United Nations. 59
disputes and all applications submitted to it in accordance with this
Convention and all matters specifically provided for in any other
agreement which confers jurisdiction on the Tribunal.". 183 Following
the acceptance of an application, the tribunal presides over a series of
hearings and then proceeds to decide by majority vote. In short, UNCLOS
III provided a means resolve international ocean conflict in a peaceful,
fair, and neutral way. 184 The second and more surprising component is
the foundation of The International Seabed Authority (ISA or the
Authority) was created through Section 4 of Part XI of UNCLOS III and
tasked with the management of the use of the Area. The establishment of
the Authority and its governance of the deep seabed is both the longest
and the most notorious section of the UNCLOS document. The Authority has
absolute governance over the entire abyssal seabed space: it may
initiate research and investigations into the state of the resources,
issue regulations and recommendations, supervise the activities of
countries and all activities in the Area must be subject to its approval
via permit. 185 The organization is complex, functions globally and
entirely independent. The large power instated in the Authority led to
the refusal of the United States and other states to sign UNCLOS III as
it was seen as a violation of the freedom of the seas.186 Part XI became
the only part of UNCLOS III to be amended in 1994 (after another 10
years of debate) and decreased the extent of its power. Regardless, the
United States remains opposed UNCLOS on this basis as it deems it a
threat to its economic pursuits in deep sea mining. Finally, although
not as significant, Annex II of UNCLOS III created another body
concerned with the seabed. The Commission on the Limits of the
Continental Shelf (CLCS) is composed of "21 members who shall be experts
in the field of geology, geophysics or hydrography \[...\] having due
regard to the need to ensure equitable geographical representation". 187
The commission has two functions: firstly, to evaluate claims to the

regarding the management of shelf space if there is evidence for concern
from recent scientific publications.188 1982-present: The Successes and
Failures of Global Ocean Governance From its signing in 1982, UNCLOS has
served to govern and manage global ocean space for almost 40 years. In
this time, it has been put to the test on multiple occasions and has
also shown where it falls short in its goal to provide equitable and
sustainable use of the oceans. Built on a culmination of maritime
customs existing since before 533 AD, the treaty was able to seamlessly
consolidate and clarify generally accepted notions such as the limits of
territorial sea or the right to innocent passage. 189 In addition, it
went a step further and provided a framework to resolve and mitigate
various disagreements and contending claims to coastal space through
ITLOS. The judicial body is now credited the for preventing a series of
violent conflicts such as regional naval wars. The creation of the IAS
also demonstrated the ability of the convention to evolve over the
course of several meetings to address jurisdiction issues. However, in
recent years, UNCLOS has also come under fire for its sprawling array of
failures. The first and perhaps greatest of the issues in UNCLOS
concerns the high seas. The high seas are still managed following a
freedom of the sea's mentality where there are no limits on access,
amounts of resources or behavior. This was not a problem when resources
were plentiful, and access (due to lack of knowledge and technology) was
a limiting factor. Today, it is one of the most damaging loopholes to
the global ocean regarding illegal fishing, human rights and trafficking
and piracy. Since it does not fall under the jurisdiction of any
country, the high seas make it virtually impossible to apprehend
criminals in the grey space that makes up. 60% of the oceans. 190 In
addition, while UNCLOS designates a country's claims on 188 Division for
Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea, Office of Legal Affairs, United
Nations, "Scientific and Technical Guidelines of the Commission on the
Limits of the Continental Shelf" (United Nations, 1999); United Nations,

Perl-Rosenthal, A World at Sea. 190 Urbina, The Outlaw Ocean. 61 coastal
waters via EEZs, territorial waters and the continental shelf, it
remains only as effective and powerful as the country that enforces it.
This echoes one of John Selden's core statements of "Mare Clausum". Does
the law of the sea matter for a country that has no means to enforce it
within its waters? For a country like Palau that "consists of only about
177 square miles of land (roughly the size of New York City), its
sovereignty extends across 230,000 square miles of wide-open seas
(nearly the size of Texas)". 191 Surrounded by countries with some of
the largest fishing fleets in the world (China, Japan, Taiwan, etc.) a
single patrol vessel is responsible for enforcing this jurisdiction of
the area. The colonial traditions of control and ocean sovereignty
remain prominent today as international law wrestles with solutions that
do not rely on the individual naval and economic capabilities of a
country. If the USA navy takes on the role of a global ocean police, is
this a matter of greater good or a display of maritime dominance?
Second, an issue that was a touched on by the ILC even before the
convention at the time of the Truman proclamations: how can global ocean
governance be successful is participation is optional? 192 This is a
central and frustrating issue several international agreements (such as
the International Whaling Commission) have experienced with countries
leaving and joining at will when it is convenient. Unfortunately, the
same is true for UNCLOS. At present, one of the world's largest naval
powers is not part of the agreement: the United States. Due to its
interests in seafloor resources and its large continental shelf (i.e.,
Part IX of UNCLOS III), the United States has neither signed nor
ratified the convention. If the U.S. is not part of the agreement,
should it follow UNCLOS guidelines regarding conflict? What about
countries that find themselves in conflict with the nation? However, a
lack of adherence can be observed among signatories as well. In 2016,
the Philippines took a dispute on the territorial claims of China in the
South China Sea to ITLOS for resolution. 193 Using the "claim of the
nine-dash line, China lay claims to most of the marginal sea based on
historic use. The 191 Urbina. 192 Castillo and Caminos, Law of the Sea.
193 International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, "Digest of
Jurisprudence of the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea." 62
Philippines took this as a violation of the law of the sea given the
200-nautical mile limits of EEZs. 194 Both signatories of UNCLOS, the
ruling of ITLOS should have resolved the dispute. When the tribunal
ruled in favor of the Philippines, China publicly announced it will not
accept the tribunals ruling as ITLOS did not have proper jurisdiction in
the matter. As a result, the Philippines received little more than a
moral victory while geopolitically, given China's imposing presence,
little happened to pressure the country in to accepting the ruling. 195
Globally, other UNCLOS signatories seemed indifferent to the result and
no state could take direct action regionally to challenge the states
sovereignty. 196 In short, the event demonstrated that while the rules
may be written, it is an entirely different matter to follow them.
Finally, while based on prior agreements, UNCLOS remains fundamentally
based on terrestrial law. Maritime law continues to assume that the
ocean is stagnant be it in resources, or in the delimitations of ocean
space established by coastal countries. However, with climate change and
increasing anthropogenic pressures marine ecosystems are changing. We
are beginning to see that laws once put in place are not effective in
addressing these changes or anticipating them. An example of this is the
Arctic. As sea ice extent decreases due to increased emissions of
greenhouse gases, the Arctic is opening to new economic activities such
as oil-drilling and international shipping. In the past, the region has
been divided between eight member countries of the Arctic treaty with a
small, seasonally accessible space of high seas at the center of the
region. 197 However, with new economic potential, states are beginning
to discuss claims to the region due to factors such a "arctic proximity"
or the seabed falling under the "commons of humankind". Just as Pope
Alexander I designated Portugal and Spain as sovereigns of all
territories "found 194 International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea;

found", should such precautions be incorporated in to UNCLOS given the
changing state of our oceans? 198 Summary: The Future of UNCLOS With 169
signatories, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is an
incredible achievement in international law and global cooperation. The
president of the Third Convention on the Law of the Sea celebrated it as
a victory in the "rule of law and the peaceful settlement of disputes"
and a symbol of "human solidarity and the reality of
interdependence".199 He goes on to summarize UNCLOS as the constitution
for the oceans. While UNCLOS was revolutionary in many aspects, it
reiterated what others had already established. The treaty did not make
any radical changes or improvements to address gaps that existed
(piracy, human rights, flagging, etc.) and remain a problem up until
today. With some of its first documents over 50 years old, the
convention has yet to see any major additions or reforms to address
pressing issues such as gaps in jurisdiction, climate change or
technological advances. Upon closer analysis, the shortcomings of the
agreement become frustrating and beg the question: although codified,
have we improved in our approach to the management of marine space? Does
this approach support equitable ocean use or simply empower dominant
coastal states? UNCLOS oscillates between this heavily colonialist
approach and the radical opposite resembling Grotian principles of
"freedom of the seas". The state-centric approach focused on absolute
sovereignty of territorial waters allows little room for the
consideration of coastal cultures and traditional users. Conversely, the
problematic status of the high seas demonstrates the pitfalls of this
alternative. Generally vague, the laws governing the high seas allow for
loopholes that are exploited by organizations around the world from
illegal fishing to the abuse of human rights. 198 Commager, "2. Papal
Bull INTER CAETERA. May 4, 1493." 199 Koh, Tommy T. B., "A Constitution
for the Oceans: Remarks by Tommy T. B. Koh, of Singapore. President of
the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea." (United
Nations, October 12, 1982). 64 In summary, UNCLOS carries on the
longstanding tradition of ocean governance and maritime law: vague,
varied and inherently dependent on citing other predecessor agreements
that maintain the same flaws. A culmination of the centuries of local
maritime traditions and international treaties, the system also carries
the burden of the flaws of these predecessors. In addition to its
archaic nature, UNCLOS is beginning to face new threats alien to those
who designed the treaties that it built on: climate change and rapid
development of powerful technologies such as satellite, and artificial
intelligence. The global ocean has been synonymous with its vastness. We
are reaching a turning point whereby our heavy use, growing demands and
lack of monitoring, its ecosystems are changing and resources dwindling.
200 The "commons of humankind" can no longer be treated as an open and
endless resource as they are described in the United Nations Convention
on Law of the Sea. While we still do not entirely understand them, we
are racing to conquer them. The same mentality that has long motivated
countries to define treaties and codes to demonstrate their sovereignty
of ocean space now pushes commercial and political bodies to attempt to
divide up the last frontier on our planet. International Seabed
Authority and recent claims on seabed space are proof of this. Looking
into the future, we must consider how we will adapt and inform this
complex international system used to govern our global ocean to ensure
we use our ocean fairly and sustainably. Chapter 5 -- The Place of
Indigenous Peoples in International Law Overview The history of maritime
law and [UNCLOS may seem removed from the history of the rights of
indigenous peoples. However, given the importance of oceans in
**exploration and colonization**, the issue of indigenous peoples in
newly "discovered" lands and discussions surrounding **maritime
sovereignty**, the history of the law of the sea and indigenous rights
go hand in hand.]{.underline} In some cases, the same key figures 200

Together with Chapter 4, this chapter will serve to provide global
background for national and regional narratives explored in the case
studies of the Northwest Passage in Canada and the Torres Strait in
Australia. As a result, the following sections will focus only on
pivotal decisions in international law pertaining directly to the issues
of indigenous status and sovereignty related to the case study topics.
Laying Foundations of Discovery and Dominance The [narrative of
indigenous rights in international law began with and continues to be
shaped by legislation dating back to the 15th century]{.underline}.
Similarly, to the Law of the Sea, the [history of indigenous law is
tightly bound with the "**discovery" of new lands** and the need to
conquer them]{.underline}. Beginning in 1436 and concluding in 1493, a
series of papal bulls justified European explorers in their conquest of
new territories. The concepts contained within these papal bulls have
come to be known as the "Doctrine of Discovery" and have defined
discussions in human rights and international law going forward. The
papal bulls that make up the Doctrine of Discovery originate from the
traditions of crusades. Although confined to the 13th century, the legal
arguments that justified Christian expeditions to conquer and convert
populations of "heathen and infidel" peoples in the Middle East lay the
foundations for the reasoning behind colonization and conquest of
Africa, North and South America.201 The central role of the pope and the
Catholic church demonstrates the importance of religion in all
international legislation concerning "discovery" and colonization of new
territories. The early 1400s marked the beginning of an 201 Robert J.
Miller et al., Discovering Indigenous Lands (Oxford University Press,
2010), https://doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199579815.001.0001; David
H. Getches et al., eds., Cases and Materials on Federal Indian Law, 6th
ed, American Casebook Series (St. Paul, MN: Thomson/West, 2011). 66 era
of disputes over overseas claims between the Christian kingdoms of
Portugal and Spain (Castile). Initially, conflict sparked over claims to
Northern Africa as well as the strategically placed Canary Islands both
of which were desirable for resources like gold and slaves. In 1436,
King Duarte of Portugal requested that papal permission to conquer the
territories. While pope Eugenius IV responded with the papal bull Rex
Regnum supporting the European presence in the Canary Islands, [his
stance on the sovereignty of the two countries remained neutral.202 Rex
Regnum remained crucial in shaping the way Wester society justified
colonization: while the Church acknowledge the right of indigenous
peoples to property and sovereignty, the need for colonization was
justified as necessary through a need to lead indigenous communities to
civilization and religious conversion.]{.underline}203 The conflict
between Portugal and Spain over African territories would come a head in
the 1450s with the two papal bulls of Nicholas V: Dum Diversas and
Romanus Pontifex. Given the close relationship of Nicholas V to the
Portugese crown, both documents would favor King Alfonso of Portugal.
However, each document dealt with a separate perspective of
colonization. In 1452, with papal bull Dum Diversas (in Latin, "until
different") Pope Nicholas V took a stance on the issue of the indigenous
communities encountered by Portugese settlers. The legal edict stated
that "we grant to you full and free power, through the Apostolic
authority by this edict, to invade, conquer, fight, subjugate the
Saracens \[Muslims\] and pagans, and other infidels \[...\], and
wherever established their \[...\] dominions, lands, places, \[...\] any
other possessions, mobile and immobile goods found in all these places".
Shortly after, Nicholas V issued the papal bull Romanus Pontifex, this
time drawing upon themes in Dum Diversas, explicitly stating that "to
invade, search out, capture, vanquish, and subdue all Saracens and
pagans whatsoever, and other enemies of Christ \[...\] and to reduce
their persons to perpetual slavery, and to apply and appropriate to
himself and his successors the kingdoms \[...\] goods, and to convert
them to his and their use and profit". The document bound all Christian
monarchs to acknowledge Portugal's exclusive claims 202 Frances
Davenport, "Bull Romanus Pontifex (Nicholas V.). January 8, 1455, The
Document," in European Treaties Bearing on the History of the United
States and Its Dependencies to 1648, ed. Charles Oscar Paullin (Carnegie
Institution of Washington, 1917); Getches et al., Cases and Materials on
Federal Indian Law. 203 Miller et al., Discovering Indigenous Lands. 67
to the islands and all of Africa with the threat of excommunication if
this claim was contested.204 Romanus Pontifex echoed the reasoning of
crusades as it laid out colonization and conquest of new territories as
work supporting the greater good of Christianity. [The clear statement
of "perpetual slavery" and "appropriation" lay the foundations for the
language and mentalities of Western legal systems towards indigenous
communities going forward]{.underline}. The bull Romanus Pontifex played
a key role in justifying conquest and colonization and continued to do
so when in 1492 when Christopher Columbus claimed North America in the
name of the Spanish crown. Romanus Pontifex gave Portugal exclusive
claims to all African territories and "undiscovered lands". However, the
reasoning of "converting infidels" and "pagans" for the good of the
Church in previous papal bulls was used by King Ferdinand and Queen
Isabella to procure Bull Intercaetera Divinae from Pope Alexander VI in
1493. While examined as a foundational document in the history of the
Law of the Sea, the papal bull all marked the first application of the
Doctrine of Discovery to the North America. The document begins stating
that the goal of the Spanish crown and Columbus's expedition is "to seek
out and discover certain islands and mainlands remote and unknown and
not hitherto discovered by others, to the end that you might bring
\[...\] the profession of the Catholic faith their residents and
inhabitants". Seemingly contradictory, the statement demonstrates a
fundamental concept of the Doctrine of Discovery: while the Church
recognizes indigenous peoples as nations, their claims to land are
unjustified if they are not Catholic. As a result, lands they inhabit
are considered undiscovered. This principle will continue to appear for
centuries to come. Given the claims of the Bull Intercaetera to all
lands West of the Azores, the bull was followed by the final legal edict
of the Doctrine of Discovery. The Treaty of Tordesillas of 1494
clarified the claims of "newly discovered lands" of Spain and Portugal
while also dividing the world in half between the two monarchies,
providing them exclusive sovereignty to these territories. The Treaty of
Tordesillas is 204 Miller et al., Discovering Indigenous Lands; S. James
Anaya, Indigenous Peoples in International Law (New York: Oxford
University Press, 1996). 68 considered the first piece of legislation
addressing the Law of Nations in any way.205 In Discovering Indigenous
Lands, Robert Miller summarizes the principles contained in the bulls
and treaty of the 1400s: firstly, the Church had the right to grant
political and secular rights to sovereignty to Christian states over any
lands unclaimed by a European power, second exploration and colonization
were justified as they helped exercise "necessary" Christian
guardianship over "infidels" and finally through Spain and Portugal's
claims in the Treaty of Tordesillas, the western world declared it's
symbolic possession of all "new lands".206 Colonial Narratives in
International Law and Governance Legislation from the 1400s [justified
the conquest of new lands by European explorers and settlers and their
purpose. However, the Doctrine of Discovery remained vague on the fate
of indigenous peoples and their treatment upon conquest]{.underline}.
Beginning in the early 1500s, the following two centuries would document
the evolution of moral and legal narrative surrounding [indigenous
rights and treatment. Intiial discussions would evolve into the early
principles of international law leading up to the Law of Nations and the
definition of Westphalian sovereignty]{.underline}. The bull
Intercaetera Divinae provided Spain with a secure title to the
territories encountered by Christopher Columbus. The [period that
followed was characterized by rapid Spanish colonization of North
American territories with grim consequences for indigenous
cultures]{.underline}. The extensive reduction of indigenous populations
through war and disease led to additional legislation justifying and
supporting the actions of Spanish conquistadors: The Requerimiento
(Requirement) of 1513207. A piece of colonial legislation, the
Requerimento was considered a charter of conquest and was [required to
be read to any indigenous community upon encounter]{.underline}. The
charter stated that, the Pope of Rome "was to be the head of the entire

[**enterprises** they create]{.mark} to achieve their goals for **social
change** and **social justice**]{.underline}.

[**Indigenous entrepreneurship** is a foundation for understanding
**Indigenous enterprise**]{.underline}, for it is often [Indigenous
entrepreneurs]{.underline} that [create and operate such
entities]{.underline}. [Indigenous entrepreneurship has been defined
as]{.underline}, '[the **creation**]{.underline},
**[management]{.underline}**, [and **development** of new ventures by
Indigenous people for the benefit of Indigenous people]{.underline}. The
organisations thus created can pertain to either the private, public or
non-profit sectors' (Hindle & Moroz, 2010: 363). Hindle and Moroz
developed a framework for [[Indigenous
entrepreneurship]{.underline}]{.mark} research that [[highlights]{.mark}
the relative importance of [**communities** rather than
**individuals**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} which
[[emphasises **culture**]{.mark} and **social norms** [over]{.mark}
**resources** and **[profits]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Peredo, Anderson, Gailbraith, Honig, and Dana (2004) acknowledge that
[Indigenous peoples strive to **plan** and **control** their own
development]{.underline}, [their **rights over resources**]{.underline},
[and to **rebuild their communities**]{.underline}. However, Indigenous
development founded on Indigenous culture and society has proved
problematic, as [Indigenous entities **struggle to exist** in the
economic and organisational systems of the dominant
culture]{.underline}. In a similar vein, Peredo and McLean (2010)
discuss how [[Indigenous peoples around the world have turned to
**entrepreneurial endeavour** to improve]{.mark} the [conditions]{.mark}
of themselves and their communities]{.underline}. They suggest that
'[Indigenous communities act **collectively** as both **entrepreneur**
and **enterprise**]{.underline}, [with profit-making **subordinate** to
social outcomes]{.underline}' (2010: 614).

For Cahn, '[In Indigenous societies **throughout the
world**]{.underline} "**[business]{.underline}**" [and [**economic
activities** are embedded in **cultural** and **social
aspects**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [creating **unique styles** of
entrepreneurship]{.underline}, which are [often
**community-oriented**]{.underline}, and [with **diverse livelihood
outcomes**]{.underline}' (2008: 1). Her focus is Indigenous
entrepreneurship, culture and micro-enterprise in Samoa. Cahn found
that, 'where micro-enterprises blend well with fa'aSamoa1 , an
"Indigenous" style of enterprise develops, and fa'aSamoa is a motivating
factor and asset, which enhances entrepreneurial activity' (2008: 16).
Further, she found that [[whilst cash was]{.mark} an
**[important]{.mark} outcome** of enterprise]{.underline}, [[so too
was]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**social** and **cultural
capital**]{.underline}]{.mark}, 'that was [developed through **actively
engaging** in]{.underline} the [values and expression]{.underline} of
fa'aSamoa' (2008: 17).

In their definitive text Dana and Anderson note that, 'there is a rich
heterogeneity among Indigenous peoples, and some of their cultural
values are often incompatible with the basic assumptions of mainstream
theories. Indigenous entrepreneurship often has non-economic explanatory
variables... We propose that entrepreneurship opportunity recognition
and evaluation is therefore culturally determined: however, we note that
culturally determined opportunities for entrepreneurship are often
disrupted by entities external to Indigenous peoples' (2007: 601).

Further, Henry, Dana, and Murphy (2017: 5) argue that [Indigenous
entrepreneurship]{.underline} differs from the dominant theoretic themes
of mainstream research into entrepreneurship, which tends to focus on
the characteristics of individuals. The literature from Indigenous
scholars, on the other hand, often [focusses on [the **emancipatory
nature** of **entrepreneurial actions**]{.mark} and
**intent**]{.underline}. They write, 'The approach is different because
it focusses on how [entrepreneurs and communities can **surmount unique
social** and **environmental constraints**]{.underline} that apply to
them'.

Herein lies one of the conceptual overlaps between social innovation,
cultural capital, and Indigenous entrepreneurship. Aramburu and Saenz
(2011) note that an organisation's ability to innovate is linked to its
intellectual capital, or new knowledge. This paper argues that an
organisation's innovation capabilities are also linked to its cultural
capital, which Throsby defines as 'an asset embodying cultural value'
(1999: 3). Throsby adds that culture should be added to the three
traditionally acknowledged forms of capital -- physical, human, and
natural -- because it enriches economic analyses. The [Indigenous
entrepreneurship]{.underline} literature also [[highlights the
**significance of**]{.underline}]{.mark} both social and cultural
**[[capital]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Light and Dana (2013) recognise that
social [capital **assists** Indigenous entrepreneurs [in terms of
the]{.mark}]{.underline} social, networking and others [[**resources**
it brings and the]{.mark} **strategic [relationships]{.mark}** [it
generates]{.mark}]{.underline}, whilst Henry, Dana, and Murphy (2017)
link cultural capital to environmental context, personal identity and
self-efficacy, which have been found to enhance entrepreneurial intent
amongst Indigenous peoples.

This complexity is highlighted in Mark Nuttall's research on the
co-management of Arctic oil and gas resources in Alaska and the Canadian
Arctic (Nuttall, 2008), including his detailed study of two generations
of oil and gas comanagement in the Mackenzie River Valley, as well as
Claudia Notzke's earlier pioneering research on resource co-management
across Canada (Notzke, 1995), which chronicles both the proliferation
and increasing saliency of co-management as a governing principle for
natural resource management, even in regions without settled land
claims. Indeed, [[so **well-suited** is co-management to
**resource-rich**]{.mark} **frontier [regions]{.mark}**, [it]{.mark} has
been **decoupled from the land claims process**, finding its way into
resource-rich parts of Canada's settled southern provinces where
competing claims to the land have [precluded **successful**]{.mark}
**negotiation of [land claims]{.mark},**]{.underline} becoming a salient
microlevel of analysis independent of land claims settlement -- as
evident in the emergence of "strategic comanagement" systems designed
for "cooperative environmental management" of natural resource-rich
area, yielding stand-alone co-management bodies in areas of southern
Canada without settled land claims. (Notzke, 1995) And Derek Armitage et
al.\'s 2011 study of co-management in the Canadian Arctic demonstrates
how [[comanagement]{.mark} provides a mechanism [for]{.mark} both
[Natives and governments to]{.mark} learn **how [to be
adaptive]{.mark}** amidst \"uncertainty and environmental
change,\"]{.underline} and thus to benefit from social learning for
developing adaptive capacity for resolving complex challenges
collaboratively, [resulting in new levels of knowledge co-production
[that]{.mark} successfully **[synthesize indigenous and western
approaches]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- introducing a \"collaborative
process to bring together a plurality of knowledge sources\"
[[that]{.mark} both **[reconciles asymmetries in power]{.mark}** and
overcomes the many complexities of multilevel governance.]{.underline}

8\. The Globalization of Co-Management

Armitage's earlier 2007 co-edited volume (with Berkes and Doubleday) on
adaptive co-management, institutional learning, and multi-level
governance illustrates the globalization and universalization of
comanagement far beyond the Arctic region. Its case studies include
northern examples of co-management from Alaska, Yukon, NWT and Nunavut
as might be expected, as well as case studies of co-management in places
as diverse as Vancouver Island, Southern Ontario and Atlantic Canada in
Canada\'s southern provinces; in addition to Wisconsin in the United
States; Belize, Barbados, and Granada in the Central America/Caribbean
region; and Sweden in Europe. Indeed, co-management has truly gone
global.

Former Yukon Premier Tony Penikett has observed that Native treaties in
Canada are themselves "inherently international because natives are
transnational," even if governments in North America still view Natives
as "domesticated" components of their constitutional polities. To
Penikett, [land claims treaties and the many [comanagement]{.mark}
structures they [yielded]{.mark} are "**[remarkable nation-building
achievements]{.mark}**," helping [to **offset earlier
colonial**]{.mark}**-era [treaties]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the "historic
[failures]{.mark} [of]{.mark} colonizing [states to respect]{.mark}
their treaty [promises]{.mark}."]{.underline} (Penikett, 2014) Looking
to the future, [[as]{.mark} the polar thaw drives continuing Arctic
globalization, and [non-Arctic states show increasing interest]{.mark}
in Arctic]{.underline} lands, waters and resources, [[the]{.mark}
strategic [center]{.mark} of mass [for engaging]{.mark} in Arctic
enterprises of all sorts [will b]{.mark}e the myriad
**[co-management]{.mark} structures**]{.underline} that define the
post-land claims political topography of Arctic North America.

Just as co-management strives to institutionalize the dynamic balancing
of competing traditional and modern values, and of tribal and state
powers, it could establish a foundation for the diplomatic balancing of
Arctic interests and non-Arctic interests alike. Co-management can thus
form a vital nexus at the very heart of Arctic globalization.
[[Co-management introduces a **collaborative**]{.mark}
**decision-making** [process]{.mark} that is at heart adaptive, and as
such is well-suited to the arrival of new actors on the Arctic stage
with values, interests, and capabilities that may differ profoundly from
their local, regional and indigenous counterparts.]{.underline} Just as
[co-management has successfully]{.underline} (but not always
frictionlessly) [[negotiated an]{.mark} [**equilibrium** between]{.mark}
contending **[traditional and contemporary
values]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and between tribal and state interests,
[[it]{.mark} could [serve]{.mark} not only [as]{.mark} a metaphor, but
[an **institutional foundation**]{.mark}, for the management of the
emergent state competition gathering steam in the Arctic.]{.underline}

9\. An End to Arctic Exceptionalism?

While the post-Cold War Arctic has been marked by a spirit of
collaboration between multiple levels of stakeholders, whether
indigenous peoples, states, or transnational organizations, [this
collaboration has taken root [at a **unique historical
moment**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- one [[defined]{.mark} as much
[by]{.mark} the dramatic **[decline in]{.mark} international
[tension]{.mark}** and inter-bloc state rivalry that followed the end of
the Cold War]{.underline} and the largely peaceful breakup of the Soviet
Union into independent states as by the historic reconciliation between
tribe and state in the Arctic region, especially Arctic North America,
after the nearly half-century long process of land claims negotiation,
structural innovation, political devolution, and implementation of
co-management systems across the entirety of Arctic North America --
with the region buffered from external stressors by the remoteness and
harshness of Arctic climate and geography.

[Even [as war erupted in other]{.mark} ethnically complex
[regions]{.mark} such as the Balkan Peninsula, and throughout the Middle
East, Africa and South Asia where tribal dynamics greatly influence
political stability, **[calm prevailed in the
Arctic]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The causal ambiguity inherent in the
concept of "Arctic Exceptionalism" is rooted in the inability of
separating this protracted period of circumpolar peace and stability
from these historic events and processes, or from the region's distinct
geography and climate. Thus, the state of ["[Arctic
Exceptionalism]{.mark}" may not be an inherent "default" condition of
Arctic international relations but one that [has arisen in lockstep with
its **historical**]{.mark} **and strategic [context,]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} one that **[can evaporate]{.mark}** as historical trends
and the strategic environment transform.]{.underline}

Add to this the many complexities of the Arctic's geophysical
transformation catalyzed by climate change, which may introduce myriad
stressors to disrupt the Arctic calm, one may reasonably look to the
future with new caution and concern.

[A comparative look at [U.S]{.mark}. Arctic [strategy]{.mark} during the
post-Cold War period [shows]{.mark} a [continuous]{.mark}, unbroken
chain of official documents committed to **[collaborative]{.mark},
multilateral [Arctic engagement]{.mark}**, in partnership **[with Arctic
indigenous peoples]{.mark}** and states]{.underline} (including Russia,
with which the U.S. directly aligned its interests at the May 28, 2008
Arctic Ocean Conference in Ilulissat, Greenland, as reflected in the
Ilulissat Declaration uniting the interests of the Arctic 5 (A5)
littoral states, and embracing the Law of the Sea Convention (LOSC) as
the guiding mechanism for Arctic Ocean management). This is evident in
the Clinton Administration's Arctic policy (as articulated by
Presidential Decision Directive/NSC-26 issued on June 9, 1994) as well
as the Bush Administration's update, as articulated in National Security
Presidential Directive (NSPD-66) on January 9, 2009, and again in the
Obama Administration's National Strategy for the Arctic Region (NSAR)
issued on May 10, 2013. Over two decades spanning the collapse of the
Soviet Union and the re-emergence of a sovereign Russian state, and the
eruption of the Global War on Terror, and well into the acceleration of
a polar thaw, regardless of ruling political party, American Arctic
strategy remained at heart collaborative and multilateral.

But in the years that followed the release of NSAR, global interest in
the Arctic greatly intensified, and in response the Arctic Council
opened its doors to a wide range of non-Arctic states as official
observers of the Council, with indirect opportunities to participate
through partnership with Arctic Council members. The increased
complexity of world politics, and in Arctic international relations, and
the assertion of interests in and through the Arctic by non-Arctic
states, combined with a strategic re-assessment of Russian military
ambitions in world politics, began to shake the very foundations of
Arctic Exceptionalism. This precipitated a re-assessment of American
strategic policy with regard to the Arctic region, and a questioning of
the very foundation of Arctic Exceptionalism. This became evident in the
December 2016 Report to Congress on Strategy to Protect United States
National Security Interests in the Arctic Region, and has again been
reflected by the updated United States Coast Guard Arctic Strategic
Outlook, released in April 2019, where dual concerns with both Russian
and Chinese Arctic ambitions cast a long shadow over the collaborative
spirit that infused preceding strategy documents. Arctic collaboration
and cooperation is still a guiding principle, but it is framed more by
alliances and military partnerships than by a presumed universality of
inherent Arctic collaboration10. Embracing the 'Shared Space' of
Co-Management in International RelationsLooking forward, it appears we
are at a crossroads: there is still every opportunity for the Arctic to
remain a zone of international peace and cooperation, so long as the
many stakeholders in the Arctic continue to work collaboratively, and to
find ways to align their interests. But there is also the specter of the
re-emergence of a new Arctic Cold War, should such a collaboration prove
incompatible with the future actions of the many states vying for Arctic
influence and involvement. Whether the path forward is continued
exceptionalism or a collapse in the peaceful Arctic order depends much
on the willingness of new Arctic stakeholders to uphold the
collaborative commitments embraced by the Arctic states and the
indigenous peoples of the Arctic, and which established trust and
cooperation through the creation of joint-governing mechanisms, such as
the many comanagement regimes established after land claims were
settled.An interesting barometer of this will be whether the new Arctic
stakeholders engage respectfully with the comanagement system. While the
Arctic Council's member states and indigenous permanent participants
reflect, to a large measure, the original parties to the co-management
process that took root in the Arctic after land claims were settled,
recent years have witnessed the proliferation of observer states that
now participate in Council meetings from well outside the Arctic,
including the industrialized maritime states of Asia with domestic
markets hungry for natural resources, shipping companies that can
benefit from emergent Arctic sea lanes, and the technological
capabilities needed for Arctic resource and infrastructure development.
There is much potential for North-South partnerships as Arctic
globalization continues; but in order to proceed, knowledge of and
respect for these many localized systems of co-management is essential.

[By **[embracing co-management]{.mark}**, and navigating the complex
administrative landscape of the post-land claims Arctic with humility
and respect, non-Arctic states will [find **enthusiastic partners** in
villages]{.mark} from one end of the Arctic to the other, [and]{.mark}
through the **[mutual]{.mark}ity of [collaboration]{.mark}**[,
enjoy]{.mark}]{.underline} the reciprocity of what Snook, Cunsolo, and
Dale (2018) call [the "**[shared space]{.mark}**" of
co-management.]{.underline} [This will [**build trust**, and
**smooth**]{.mark} **[relations]{.mark}** not only with native
communities and local levels of governance, but the federal agencies and
departments that participate equally in the co-management
process.]{.underline} But it is important to remember that Arctic
co-management has been around for nearly half a century, and that local
stakeholders are deeply committed to the comanagement process. [They not
only sit at the table: [**they built the table at which they
sit**,]{.mark} having negotiated for many years, sometimes decades, [in
a]{.mark}n [historic process of **re-empowerment of indigenous
peoples**]{.mark} across the Arctic.]{.underline} Just as non-Arctic
observers at the Arctic Council sit around the table but not at it, a
place at the comanagement table is earned through trust and mutual
respect. Remembering this can unlock unimagined opportunities for mutual
gain and prosperity. Forgetting this, however, could result in a missed
opportunity of equal magnitude, and plant the seeds for what could
become a new Cold War at the top of the world.

Needless to say, [this]{.underline} article [does not **reject**
decolonial theory]{.underline}. Instead, [my aim is to reflect on the
potential **pitfalls**]{.underline} of some versions of decolonial
thinking [and to argue for a more **nuanced** and **critical**
approach]{.underline} to its application in education. While decolonial
critique is essential, it is important to recognise that [our
theoretical perspectives have **real consequences**]{.underline},
especially [when used in **different political contexts**]{.underline}.
I focus particularly on one decolonial scholar, namely, Mignolo, both
due to his substantial influence across education and other fields, and
to avoid the risk of overgeneralising about decolonial scholars (cf.
Temin 2024). This [focused analysis allows for a **nuanced critique**
that acknowledges both the **value** and **limitations** of a specific
decolonial approach **without** collapsing **all** decolonial approaches

These concerns about the convergence between neo-Traditionalism and
decoloniality theory invite a deeper reflection on the implications of
these theoretical positions; this is certainly a worthwhile argument to
pursue. However, it would be misguided, in my view -- and here I depart
from Hull's (Citation2022) argumentation -- to attribute this
convergence to decoloniality theory or to fault it for aligning with
far-right and authoritarian ideologies. The central point that must be
highlighted, in my view, is that [scholars need to **critically
examine** how these frameworks operate in relation to **specific
political contexts**]{.underline}. The [**rejection** of **universal
truth**]{.underline} in both theories [raises questions about the
**political implications** of these theories and the risks
of]{.underline} what Naicker (Citation2023) calls
'**[ethno-essentialist]{.underline}**' [claims]{.underline}. For
example, it is worthwhile to examine whether and how Mignolo's
geo-politics of knowledge creates openings to ethno-essentialist claims
about how knowledge is produced [in **different political
contexts**]{.underline} (e.g. Russia, India, China, Hungary). Does his
framework imply an Afrocentric, Islam-centric, or Christian-centric
epistemology that 'is reducible to a geo-political tradition of
cosmological meaning' (Naicker Citation2023, 223)? Engaging in
[this]{.underline} critical examination [is **vital** to ensure that the
quest]{.underline} for cultural recognition [does not **devolve** into a
**rigid adherence** to identity politics or positionality that
ultimately **undermines**]{.underline} the very values of [anticolonial
thought and politics]{.underline} (Zembylas Citation2024). While it is
true that some despotic regimes have invoked anti-Western agendas under
the guise of promoting traditional or religious values, there is limited
scholarly work in the field of education that directly traces and
substantiates these agendas as being derived from or aligned with
decolonial theory. To show the political consequences of epistemic
ethno-essentialist claims in different educational settings, I draw next
from two recent examples in the literature that illustrate how epistemic
delinking can be appropriated by authoritarian forces.

### AT: Democracy Ks

#### Democratic states are less colonial prefer empirical studies 

BENJAMIN E. **GOLDSMITH** et al, **2008**, *Letting Go Without a Fight:
Decolonization, Democracy and War, 1900---94. Journal of Peace Research,
45(5), 587--611.* doi:10.1177/002234330809432210.1177/0022343308094322
(Goldsmith - Political Science at University of Michigan, 2001; Senior

Our [central finding is that [democratic]{.mark} imperial
[states]{.mark} are more [likely]{.mark} [to]{.mark} let their
[colonies]{.mark} [achieve]{.mark} [independence]{.mark}
[without]{.mark} going to [war]{.mark} with them]{.underline}. This is a
[monadic effect consistent with the implications of Lake's]{.underline}
(1992) theory, and we believe it is a new confirming result. Our
examination of the separate components of the Polity measure further
supports Lake's theory. Neither the democratic nature of executive
recruitment (even if it is measured by the size of the 'winning
coalition') nor the degree of political competition significantly
affects the chance of war with colonies. Rather, our results suggest
that it [is the immediate, formal, [institutional]{.mark}
[constraints]{.mark} [on]{.mark} the [gov]{.mark}ernment leadership that
play the greatest role in making democratic states more 'benevolent'
(less dangerous) imperial masters]{.underline}. Taken as a whole, the
monadic effect and the strength of the executive constraints component
are compelling evidence in favour of Lake's theory of democratic peace.
[This result certainly deserves further exploration.7 The straight
interpretation would be that constrained executives face [fewer]{.mark}
[losses]{.mark} [from]{.mark} rents extracted from [colonies]{.mark}, so
they are more reluctant to risk a colonial war.]{.underline} We also
suggest that the delays in decision making placed on a [constrained
executive may simply allow colonial movements to [seize]{.mark} the
[initiative]{.mark} [before]{.mark} a [democratic]{.mark} imperial state
is able to [respond]{.mark} [effectively]{.mark}]{.underline}. On the
other hand, there is little evidence for a dyadic democratic peace
effect in the process of decolonization. The regime type of the colony
does not have a significant effect on the likelihood of war. This is so
for existing data before and after independence and for data projecting
regime type of the colony at independence back for the two previous
years where data are missing (not shown). It is only for the seven-year
period after independence that the dyadic democratic peace emerges
(Table I, Model 4). The rejection of the dyadic effect supports the view
that the nature of the regime of imperial states, rather than that of
colonies, is a decisive factor. This confirms the finding of Diehl &
Goertz (1991: 502) that 'when a dependent territory is granted
independence, the conditions of that transition (peaceful or violent)
are largely determined by the actions of the imperial/colonial power and
not by indigenous forces'. As is true in the [broader democratic peace
literature, our results do not undermine the validity of the realist
assessment that power and changes in power relations are still crucial
in influencing conflicts.]{.underline} However, we also clearly find an
important role for liberal democracy. So the major theories of
international relations must sit next to each other, if awkwardly, to
explain wars of decolonization, just as they do in current explanations
of international war and peace. But the power-related results in our
study are not entirely consistent with those of the only other study we
have found to deal with these topics. As noted, contrary to the finding
of Diehl and Goertz, we find that imperial decline actually makes war
with colonies less likely. Also, Diehl & Goertz (1991: 515) conclude
that 'if any of these \[dependent\] territories becomes an independent
state, it will do so peacefully. The norm of national independence is
now almost universally accepted, offering a potentially powerfully
restraint on state action'. We would like to challenge and qualify this
conclusion. There is a strong effect for the status of sovereign
independence itself. We see this not only as enhancing the capability of
the former colony, but also potentially as indicating the importance of
the norm of sovereignty itself. But, we see no reason to doubt that
independence movements in the 21st century, as in the 20th, may lead to
war. Our analyses give some clues as to the conditions when such wars
are more likely and how to reduce the chances of such wars occurring.
These can be stated concisely: powerful, rising imperial states are more
dangerous than declining ones; dependencies that are more evenly matched
with the dominant state are more dangerous; and sovereigns that are,
nevertheless, [liberal democracies are less dangerous]{.underline}. We
recognize that further investigation is warranted for our topic. Some
important controls could not be included in this initial study. Many
factors included in studies of the interstate democratic peace seem
appropriate for decolonization as well -- for example, trade relations
and other aspects of economic interdependence (Oneal & Russett, 1997),
the size of middle classes,8 civil society (He, 2004), referenda
mechanism (He, 2002b), the model of democracy such as cosmopolitan
democracy (He, 2002a), federal arrangement (He, 2006) and variants of
nationalism. In conclusion, [our [empirical testing confirms]{.mark}
t]{.underline}hat, in confronting the challenge of independence
movements[, [democratic]{.mark} [states]{.mark} are more likely than
authoritarian states to use [peaceful]{.mark} means to deal with
secession or allow for peaceful secession or independence. In other
words, confronted with independence or secession movements, democracies
produce more peaceful outcomes than authoritarian states.]{.underline}

### AT: Elimination Thesis

#### The elimination thesis is [empirically]{.underline} and [experientially]{.underline} disproven.

**Konishi, 19**---Senior Lecturer in the School of Humanities at the
University of Western Australia, Yawuru (Shino, "First Nations Scholars,
Settler Colonial Studies, and Indigenous History," Australian Historical
Studies, 50:3, 285-304, dml)

Indigenous scholars are not alone in questioning settler colonial
studies: in Australia it has also been critiqued by non-Indigenous
scholars, in particular historians such as Lisa Ford and Tim Rowse.65 In
his thought-provoking 2014 article 'Indigenous Heterogeneity' [Rowse
criticises the]{.underline} '**[teleology of
[elimination]{.mark}]{.underline}**[']{.mark} [[as an **explanatory
model**]{.underline}]{.mark} for the 'history of Australia's internal
colonial experience', arguing that [it has]{.underline}
'**[reduced]{.underline}** \[historians'\]
**[sensitivity]{.underline}**' [to the diversity of Indigenous
histories]{.underline}, [experiences of governmental
intervention]{.underline}, [and articulations of

[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}, as Rowse asserts,
'**[homogenising]{.underline}** ... [and
**[dehistoricising]{.mark}**]{.underline}[']{.mark}. 67 To challenge
this tendency, [he emphasises the **differences** between]{.underline}
the [histories]{.underline} in northern and southern Australia,
especially [[in terms of **labour** and **land-based
economies**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Rowse]{.mark} also [**questions**

(iii) [[**differing responses** to]{.underline}]{.mark}
'[[acculturation]{.underline}]{.mark}' [[which]{.underline}]{.mark} in
the end **[[do not see it as incommensurate]{.underline}]{.mark}** with
Aboriginality.68

As [Rowse demonstrates]{.underline}, [[**empirical evidence** challenges
the]{.underline}]{.mark} '**[[logic of
elimination]{.underline}]{.mark}**', [in particular its insistence that
Indigenous people **were not valued** for their labour]{.underline}.
Many [[**historical studies** as well as **Indigenous firsthand
testimonies** confirm]{.mark} his critique]{.underline}. For example Ann
Curthoys, Regina Ganter, Lyndall Ryan, and Leah Lui-Chivizhe and I,
among others, have demonstrated [there was **clearly** [a strong desire
for Indigenous labour in]{.mark}]{.underline} Western
**[[Australia]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Queensland and even New South
Wales, and [[protection legislation]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly
in Western Australia and Queensland, [[articulated]{.mark}
**explicitly** [how Indigenous labour could be
harnessed]{.mark}]{.underline}, [exploited]{.underline}, [and
controlled]{.underline}.69 While unfree Indigenous labour may have been
'derided' and in some industries was eventually replaced, [Indigenous
workers]{.underline} nonetheless [played a **significant role**
in]{.underline} the establishment of [**pearling** and
**pastoralism**]{.underline} in the north, [and]{.underline} Indigenous
knowledge and labour [as **guides**]{.underline},
**[shepherds]{.underline}**, **[shearers]{.underline}**, [**mail
runners** and **so on**]{.underline} arguably enabled settlers with
little capital to practise agriculture.70 Further, [attempts to disrupt
this supply of]{.underline} '[colonised labour]{.underline}', through
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander mobility or political agitation
for fair wages and conditions, [were **condemned** and attempts were
made to **suppress** such efforts]{.underline}. [[The value]{.mark} of
Indigenous labour [was also **evidenced** in]{.mark}]{.underline}
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander oral histories and biographies
explaining [[their]{.mark} strategic [use of]{.mark} **labour
[strikes]{.mark}** as a form of political protest]{.underline} for
better employment conditions and more autonomy on their own country.71

To offer [[a **more optimistic**]{.mark} and **balanced
[counterpoint]{.mark}**]{.underline} to both settler colonial theory and
race relations history, I [suggest that]{.underline} alongside these
transnational and national approaches [we]{.underline} also
[[recognise]{.mark} local [histories of Indigenous experience that **do
not revolve** around settler]{.mark} colonial
[domination]{.mark}]{.underline}, expropriation, exploitation or
elimination. Here we can look to Bunurong writer Bruce Pascoe's Dark
Emu: Aboriginal Australia and the Birth of Agriculture (2014 and 2018)
and Worimi scholar Dale Kerwin's Aboriginal Dreaming Paths and Trading
Routes (2010).72 Both books are broad histories of Aboriginal daily
life, trade, mobility and storytelling across Australia which draw on
colonial documentary sources and archaeological, zoological, and
botanical studies, but are primarily influenced by Aboriginal knowledge
and oral histories, as well as firsthand observations of country. As
Pascoe explains, [by]{.underline} using documentary sources but
'[adjusting our perspective by **only a few degrees**]{.underline}, [we
see a **vastly different world** through the same window]{.underline}'.
73 I would term such works extra-colonial histories. In my own work, I
have often been drawn to the pre-colonial history of early
[cross-cultural encounters]{.underline} between Aboriginal people and
European explorers, where history was played out between individuals and
when neither 'native' nor 'newcomer' consistently held the upper hand.74
I endeavoured to resist reading these early encounters teleologically,
as if they presaged the colonial history yet to come. In a 2008 essay on
a meeting between French explorers and Malgana people at Shark Bay,
Western Australia, I argued that:

the Aboriginal men [were **not** simply]{.underline} pushed into [a
**defensive response** to]{.underline} the coming of [the
Europeans]{.underline}, as the historiography suggests, [but displayed
**varying attitudes**]{.underline} to the white strangers, [including
curiosity and indifference]{.underline}. [They were not simply
**colonial subalterns in waiting**]{.underline}, [but **active agents**
in a cross-cultural extra-colonial encounter which may have unfolded in
**any number of ways**]{.underline}.75

Other historians have taken similar approaches to produce [innovative
histories]{.underline} which [shed new insights on early colonial
relations]{.underline}, such as Tiffany Shellam's Shaking Hands on the
Fringe: Negotiating the Aboriginal World at King George's Sound (2009),
Grace Karskens' The Colony: A History of Early Sydney (2009), Paul
Irish's Hidden in Plain View: The Aboriginal People of Coastal Sydney
(2017), and Valda Blundell et al.'s Barddabardda Wodjenangorddee: We're
Telling All of You: The Creating, History and People of Dambeemangaddee
Country (2017). These local histories of particular Indigenous
communities narrate the stories of individuals, [and reveal that [the
arrival of]{.mark}]{.underline} British [[colonists **did**]{.mark}
**not suddenly** and **[irrevocably transform]{.mark}**
Mineng]{.underline}, [Eora and Dambeemangaddee [worlds and **wipe
out**]{.mark} their [people]{.mark}]{.underline}.76 While We're Telling
All of You includes an overview of the community's first encounters with
'outsiders', frontier resistance, missions and the impact of World War
II, most of the book is firmly focused on Dambeemangaddee history:
including stories passed down of the 'places ... created by powerful
ancestral beings during Lalai' as well as stories of different 'old
people' and their family lines. [Rather than taking **centre
stage**]{.underline}, [colonial history is]{.underline} instead [pushed
to the **margins**]{.underline}, [since]{.underline} '[the historical
documentation of [colonisation]{.mark}]{.underline}[']{.mark} [[is
but]{.underline}]{.mark} '[[a **pin prick** in the **long
history**]{.mark} of the Dambeemangaddee lands]{.underline}'. 77 Like
many of the Indigenous scholars discussed earlier, the authors of this
book have an eye on the future: they wanted to write a history for their
own future generations.

### AT: Extinction Ks---No Link

#### No link to extinction Ks---our impacts are [descriptive]{.underline}, not [normative]{.underline}.

**McLaughlin, 24**---Lecturer in Global Political Theory at the
University of Exeter (Alex, "Existential Risk, Climate Change, and
Nonideal Justice," The Monist, Volume 107, Issue 2, April 2024, Pages
190--206, dml)

Before engaging in a more detailed discussion about how existential risk
might be connected to debates about climate justice, it will be
necessary to clarify how those respective terms are being understood.
[The concept of]{.underline} '**[[ex]{.mark}istential
[risk]{.mark}]{.underline}**[']{.mark} [[has become **associated**
with]{.underline}]{.mark} a small but expanding field that we can call
Existential Risk Studies (ERS). Stated at the most general level, ERS is
concerned with large-scale global risks that could lead to widespread
societal collapse or human extinction. The field aims not only to
systematise thinking about these risks but also to contribute to their
mitigation. There is, of course, a much longer tradition of thinking
about extinction, a fact ERS could do more to acknowledge. Most cultures
are imbued with eschatological narratives, often with religious
underpinnings, and science fiction writing has long explored apocalyptic
imaginaries (see Beard and Torres 2020). But ERS as a particular
self-referential domain of academic study has its roots in a set of
prominent institutions,1 and in a particular brand of utilitarianism,
emphasising the vast value of potential future well-being that will be
enhanced by advances in technology (Bostrom 2002; cf. Cremer and Kemp
2021). As the field has expanded, [[a]{.underline}]{.mark} broadly
[[**utilitarian** position]{.underline}]{.mark} remains dominant,
generally formulated in terms [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} a view known as
'[**[longtermism]{.underline}**']{.mark} (e.g., MacAskill 2022; Ord
2020). According to longtermism, ensuring the far future goes well is a
key priority of our time; according to strong longtermism, a version of
the view favoured by a number of influential figures in the field (e.g.,
Greaves and MacAskill 2021), ensuring the far future goes well is the
key priority of our time.

There is much to say about how ERS understands itself, about how
problems are framed in prominent texts and about the field's historical
development, but [I set these]{.underline} issues
**[aside]{.underline}** (see, for example, Cremer and Kemp \[2021\]).
[My aim is to take a]{.underline} generic and [**minimal** definition of
existential risk]{.underline}, and to explore whether it could have a
bearing on contemporary discussions about climate justice. For the
purposes of this paper, [[I understand]{.mark} existential risk simply
[as the risk of]{.mark} an event or process which]{.underline}, by
itself or in combination with other events or processes, [threatens the
[**extinction** of the human species]{.mark}]{.underline}. Clearly
[[this is a **minimal** definition]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} I should make some qualifications. As stated,
existential risk [is **[not]{.mark}** a **[moralised]{.mark}**
concept]{.underline}: [[it **describes**]{.mark} a threat to the
survival of the human species]{.underline}. By way of contrast,
longtermism understands existential risk in moralised terms, as a
phenomenon which is distinctively bad because of the way it threatens to
extinguish the enormous value inherent in the well-being of potential
people in the (technologically enhanced) far future. I find the
longtermist account of existential risk unattractive, but my thin
concept also serves an important purpose for the following discussion.
[I want to explore]{.underline} some [**different ways** existential
risk might be relevant for **debates**]{.underline} about climate
justice, and [so I leave its moral content **open** for
now]{.underline}. Longtermists would accept that what I classify as an
existential risk---an extinction threat---would count as such, even if
their moralised definition might encompass a greater range of threats,
such as a 'technological arrest' that does not lead to extinction, but
which prevents humanity from reaching its potential (Bostrom 2002).

[The term]{.underline} '**[existential risk]{.underline}**' [is often
used **differently**]{.underline} to the way I use [it]{.underline}
here. As Huggel et al. (2022, 7; see also Caney \[2014, 127\]) note,
existential risk [can be used to describe a threat]{.underline} "[to the
existence of a **subject**]{.underline}, where [this]{.underline}
subject [can be an individual person]{.underline}, [an entire
community]{.underline}, [a nation state]{.underline}, [or
humankind]{.underline}." For example, [the threat posed to **indigenous
cultures** by settler colonialism is **clearly** an existential risk to
the affected communities]{.underline}, and that would not be encompassed
by my definition. Indeed, [a tendency to focus on [species-level]{.mark}
rather than community-level existential risk [is the source of]{.mark}
**understandable [grievance]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[as]{.mark} many
have pointed out that the kinds of [losses]{.mark} that animate a
concern about humanity]{.underline}---cultural devastation, geographical
dislocation, massive loss of life---[[have **already been experienced**
by many]{.underline}]{.mark} indigenous groups throughout history (e.g.,
Whyte 2018, 225--29). [I **agree** [that these are **important
concerns**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and they]{.underline} partly [explain
my **reservations**]{.underline} [about using [the concept]{.mark} of
existential risk]{.underline}. [My discussion [is **not** supposed to
imply]{.mark} that the term existential risk should **[only]{.mark}** be
used according to [my definition]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[or]{.mark}
[that the]{.mark} sort of [risk]{.mark} I focus on [is **especially
troubling** in comparison to others]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[But]{.underline}]{.mark} I take it that [[there might be something
about]{.underline}]{.mark} the relationship between climate change and
[[the future of the human species that will bear on **debates**
about]{.underline}]{.mark} climate **[[justice]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
and so I restrict my discussion to the particular but prominent
definition of existential risk that refers to extinction.

### AT: Extinction Ks---Universality Good

#### The [premise]{.underline} of the K is backwards. Ignoring the [universal dimensions]{.underline} of our impacts because of its [particular]{.underline} effects is [colonial]{.underline} and [violent]{.underline}.

**Sharma, 15**---Director, International Cultural Studies Program,
University of Hawai'i Manoa (Nandita, "Strategic Anti-Essentialism:
Decolonizing Decolonization," *Sylvia Wynter: Being Human as Praxis*,
Chapter 7, pg 168-170, dml)

Wynter's insistence that [an examination of people's modes of subjective
understanding tells us something]{.underline} very [**useful** about how
to end practices of colonization]{.underline}, specifically her
understanding of humans as being "hybridly" organic and "languaging"
life forms. [All humans]{.underline}, she argues, [have
"**culture-specific** system\[s\] of symbolic
representation,"]{.underline} which alone influence our "modes of
conspecificity."14 It "is [on the basis of]{.underline} that mode \[of
**[subjective understanding]{.underline}**\]," she adds, "that the
[subjects of each human order]{.underline} are enabled to [experience
themselves as symbolic kin or interaltruistic
conspecifics]{.underline}."15 [**Particularistic modes** of essentialist
subjective understandings **inherently** create [a **limited
sense**]{.mark} of conspecificity, one that **continuously** [creates
the conditions for]{.mark} the **[subjugation]{.mark}** of
others]{.underline}. [This is]{.underline} because any particularistic
propter nos is [practically "[**impervious** to]{.mark} **philosophical
attack**" and]{.underline} "impervious also [to **empirical
[counterevidence]{.mark}**."]{.underline}16 Hence, [[those
within]{.mark} it [are]{.mark} often **[unable to see]{.mark} the
[shared humanity]{.mark}** of those imagined as outsiders]{.underline}.

Therefore, Wynter proposes that "the central mechanism at work" in
processes of colonization---and even decolonization---"was and is that
of representation."17 It is through strategies of representation "that
each human order and its culture- specific mode of empirical reality can
be brought into being as a 'form of life'."18 And, importantly, [who we
**think** we are]{.underline}---be it "Spanish" or "European" or "Aztec"
or native---and who our co- specifics are (those with / for whom we feel
we have a connection) [has **significant effects** on our
actions]{.underline}. Wynter shows, for example, how the "Spanish"
conquistadores were as incapable of imagining the "Aztecs" as their co-
specifics as the "Aztecs" were in their view of other groups in (what is
now) Mexico. The [actions]{.underline} of both the Spanish and the
Aztecs [were **limited** by]{.underline} their [**partial**,
**subjective understanding**]{.underline} of themselves. [The problem of
**[partial perspectives]{.mark}** on being human]{.underline}, then,
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} one that is [[**shared** across the
line]{.mark} of colonizer/colonized]{.underline}.

Hence, [Wynter calls for another]{.underline} root [expansion in
thought]{.underline}, one [that can imagine]{.underline} the propter nos
as one **[encompassing [all humans as a species]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
This possibility [exists not in the **abstract** but in the
acknowledgment that human beings [are]{.mark} **deeply
[interconnected]{.mark}** with one another]{.underline} and with the
environment of which we are a part (although, unfortunately, Wynter's
call does not extend to nonhuman life).19 [This connectivity remains
**real** [even as]{.mark}]{.underline} the [groups and
territories]{.underline} we are said to belong to [are **ideologically
rendered** as being **particularistic**]{.underline} (e.g., the United
States as a "white" space) [or as our [connections]{.mark} to each other
across spaces [are **denied**]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., we are
"American"). Indeed, as a result of the global expansion of ruling
relations, life on the planet and thus [our diverse planetary lives and
ties are]{.underline} perhaps [**more connected** to each other than
**ever before**. This, along with the **threat of nuclear destruction**
hanging over all of our heads]{.underline} for the last sixty- odd
years, [shows us that our **futures** are also **intimately related**.
It is the reality of these connections and [our **shared need** to
**secure the conditions of continued life**]{.mark} that
may]{.underline}, Wynter argues, [[make it possible]{.mark} for us [to
**accept** each other]{.mark} **in toto**]{.underline}, as a truly co-
identified species.

### AT: Extractivism/Resources Ks---Extraction=Good

#### Extractive development in the Arctic can [coexist]{.underline} with Indigenous self-determination. Indigenous communities are asserting agency, negotiating terms, and shaping governance frameworks now.

The first is [[the **recurring role of Indigenous

Indigenous rights which [relates]{.mark} closely [to the]{.mark}
development of international human rights and the [role of Indigenous
voices]{.mark} in the international legal arena]{.underline} as noted in
chapter one. [[From]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [Gwich'in Nation in

[Greenland]{.mark}]{.underline} [to the Sami across Norway]{.underline},
[Finland]{.underline}, [Sweden]{.underline}, [and Russia]{.underline},
[[Indigenous activists]{.mark} have [play]{.mark}ed [a **crucial part in
advancing and securing rights for their communities**]{.mark} on both a
local and regional Arctic scale]{.underline}. [This activism will
continue to grow in importance in the Arctic]{.underline} and this
future will be discussed in the fourth chapter.

#### Resource development in the Arctic [empowers]{.underline} Indigenous communities to [control]{.underline} their future and assert [sovereignty]{.underline} rather than [dispossession]{.underline}.

[[The resource potential of Greenland is the basis]{.mark} [on
which]{.mark} the country's [hopes and aspirations]{.mark} [for a better
future are built]{.mark}]{.underline}. "[The geological potential in
Greenland is huge]{.underline}" (Greenland's Mineral Strat egy
2020--2024, 2020, 6), [Furthermore, a lot of the potential is still not
well known and there are continuous expectations of finding even more
significant resources as the land and the sea undergo more exploration
in the future]{.underline} (Boersma and Foley, 2014). Indeed,
[[Greenland is]{.mark} often [depicted as a]{.mark} "**[frontier
country]{.mark}**" and a "**green field**"]{.underline}, [[attesting to
the country's vast future potential as]{.mark} a [global reserve of
resources]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark} expected [revenue]{.mark}
from the resources]{.underline} [[is]{.mark} often presented [as a
solution that will enable Greenland to **break**]{.mark} **[away
from]{.mark} its [dependence on Denmark]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} to
maintain and [develop]{.mark} the [society]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Resources]{.mark} are a blessing for Greenland in that they
**[promise]{.mark} [wealth and well-being]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Nuttall 2017; Lindroth 2020). [The [potential finding
of]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} for example, [[oil could enable
Greenland to]{.mark} considerably **[diminish its]{.mark}
[dependence]{.mark}** on the Danish annual block grant]{.underline}.
Greenland's new mineral strategy states that the development of a
resource industry will be "for the benefit of all of Greenland"
(Greenland's Mineral Strategy 2020--2024, 8). [[The expectancy is that
Greenland will have a **functioning resource extraction
industry**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Bjørst, 2016; Wilson, 2017) [[and once
this is a reality]{.mark}, [the country's resources will]{.mark}
eventually [facilitate the country's **achievement of
independence**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Some views go even further and
state that independence is "**the only answer**" to the current problems
in Greenland and the only way to "salvation"]{.underline}.

### AT: Extractivism/Resources Ks---Defense

#### Extraction is on the [decline]{.underline} and unsustainability is [wrong]{.underline}.

**Terzi, 22**---Economist at the European Commission's
Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs, Adjunct
Professor at Sciences Po and at HEC Paris (Alessio, "Understanding the
Winds of Change," *Growth for Good: Reshaping Capitalism to Save
Humanity from Climate Catastrophe*, Chapter 6, pp. 143-146, dml)

Diehard [degrowth advocates might]{.underline} now [point out
that]{.underline} such [a technology-led plan]{.underline} to tackle
climate change [will require **large material inputs**]{.underline} to
get every thing electrified [and]{.underline} get new renewable power
plants built. And because "you can't produce stuff out of thin air," as
their slogan goes, that is the end of innovation; we are simply kicking
the can down the road because, on a finite planet, [we are **bound to
run out** of raw materials]{.underline}.

On this point, as President Obama liked to say, "let me be as clear as I
can be." Innovation, and therefore economic [growth]{.underline},
[**will not run out** of materials]{.underline}, [because the very
definition of a production material depends on **what is
available**]{.underline}. [This is something we have observed
**throughout human history**]{.underline}. [Societies solve problems
using what they have on hand]{.underline}. [Think of]{.underline} a
widespread basic technology like **[writing]{.underline}**, [developed
by many societies **independently**]{.underline} to meet exigencies of
commerce first, and then knowledge accumulation more broadly. Depending
on location and existing technology, [several writing materials have
been used **throughout history**]{.underline}---stone tablets, clay
tablets, bamboo slats, papyrus, wax tablets, vellum, parchment, paper,
and copperplate---[all depending on **local availability**]{.underline}.
[The same could be said of]{.underline} basic
**[navigation]{.underline}**, which has been with humanity since
prehistoric time: early vessels were built using techniques and
materials from bamboo and logs to reeds and leather, based on material
availability and local needs.

In 1968, biologist Paul Ehrlich caused a sensation by predicting, in The
Population Bomb, that humanity would run out of resources and people
would be starving to death before the next decade was out. The only
escape in his view was strict population control, of the type
implemented by China with its "one-child policy" ten years later. It was
the Malthusian story redux, and just as in Malthus's time, the power of
innovation was underestimated. At the time, economist Julian Simon made
a famous scientific wager. He challenged Ehrlich to pick any five
commodities, saying that regardless of the choices he would bet on their
prices being lower ten years later. Ehrlich picked ones that looked
likely to run out: copper, chromium, nickel, tin, and tungsten. By the
end of the decade, all were priced lower. It is important to understand
that it is not that Simon got lucky. Rather, he understood the dynamics
of capitalist markets: [as the price of a commodity goes
up]{.underline}, [it activates a **rationing mechanism** whereby buyers
**shift away** from that material]{.underline}---[and this prods the
innovation machine to **find alternatives**]{.underline}, [or devise
**more efficient ways** to use what is available]{.underline}.37 [The
reason that the price of **tin**]{.underline}, for example, [went down
is that **aluminum** became a **cheaper** and **better
substitute**]{.underline} for it.

Aluminum has a neat story of its own. It is the most abundant metal in
the Earth's crust. And yet, up until the 1880s, when a method for
melting and electrolyzing its ore was invented, it was prohibitively
expensive, meaning it was not a production material, but treated more as
a precious metal. Dartnell reports the curious episode of an imperial
banquet organized by Napoleon III in the first half of the nineteenth
century. In this setting, aluminum cutlery was displayed as an
ostentatious show of power, reserved for the most distinguished dinner
guests, while less favored guests used knives and forks of simple gold.
The very definition of what is a commodity, and useful in production,
varies across centuries, and depends on availability.

The concern that some input material will come to an end, and that this
crisis will deal a fatal blow to civilization, is a recurrent theme in
history. In Britain, the fear was expressed in the age of sail that when
the country was depleted of oak, the fundamental wood used in
shipbuilding and masts at the time, the country would become defenseless
at sea. Clearly, this did not happen; eventually iron replaced the need
for wood, and in the meantime, sufficient supplies came through trade
with Scandinavia, the Baltics, and North America. For goods that cannot
be replaced, prices generate strong incentives to become better at
extracting and recycling them.38 Think of copper, which has good
properties as an electrical conductor. As electrification was in full
swing in the early twentieth century in the United States, geologist and
copper-mining expert Ira Joralemon warned that "the age of electricity
and of copper will be short. At the intense rate of production that must
come, the copper supply of the world will last hardly a score of years.
. . . Our civilization based on electrical power will dwindle and die."
One century later, we can see that this prediction did not age well.

[It is not even a necessity that the bulk of our technological solutions
must be based on **geological materials**]{.underline}.
[Think]{.underline}, for example, [of recent research on
**fertilizers**]{.underline}, based on the discovery that [certain
**bacteria** can capture atmospheric nitrogen]{.underline}, without the
high pressures and temperatures of the polluting Haber-Bosch process
described above. Likewise, [the research frontier is **shifting** toward
new materials]{.underline}, [opening up the possibility of producing
consumer goods with **algae-based bioplastic**]{.underline}. It would
seem that if the twentieth century was characterized by the triumph of
inorganic chemistry, the twenty-first might well be the century of
organic materials, repurposed to meet human needs. This age is being
ushered in by the advent of **[biotechnology]{.underline}** which, also
thanks to recent advances like Crispr / Cas9, [will provide **powerful
tools** to address current challenges]{.underline}, [from reducing the
use of **pesticides** and **herbicides** in agriculture to fostering
**natural carbon sequestration**]{.underline}.

[Innovation not only yields new technologies and products, but also
allows **more value** to be extracted from what is **already
available**]{.underline}. Under the heading of more efficient material
use falls, for example, the idea of [the **circular
economy**]{.underline}, in which society [is organized to]{.underline}
reuse or recycle extensively, and [rely **less** on new material
extraction]{.underline}. [The **digital revolution** has also caused the
economy to be more and more]{.underline}
"**[dematerialized]{.underline}**" [in production and
consumption]{.underline}, [as it becomes more based on **intangible
goods**]{.underline}.39 This is what economist Danny Quah refers to as
the "weightless economy." [Another push toward more efficient use of
reduced material inputs is]{.underline} known as [the]{.underline}
"**[sharing economy]{.underline}**," as seen recently in urban settings
with cars, mopeds, home rentals, and coworking spaces. Under this model,
[people shift from individual ownership of an asset to an
arrangement]{.underline}, usually employing digital technology, [by
which it can be shared by multiple users]{.underline}, [collectively
extracting **more utility** out of the **same amount** of
material]{.underline}.

Andrew McAfee shows in More from Less the extent to which [the American
economy has **dematerialized**]{.underline} since the 1970s, including
[by slashing its consumption of virtually **all** the **seventy-two
material resources** tracked by the US Geological Survey]{.underline},
[including **minerals**]{.underline}, **[timber]{.underline}**, [and
**cement**]{.underline}, whether domestically sourced or imported. In
its agricultural sector, [the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [managed to increase crop production by **35
percent**]{.underline} between 1982 and 2015, [while **reducing** the
use of fertilizers and returning to nature an amount of land equivalent
to the state of **Washington**]{.underline} (45 million acres). [The
same combination of productivity enhancements and dematerialization has
allowed many advanced economies to see **reforestation** and **economic
growth** progressing together]{.underline} over the past three
decades.40

To sum up this discussion, an old quip might suffice: The Stone Age did
not come to an end because we ran out of stones. Likewise, the age of
oil and gas will not end because we will run out of those, and
[innovation **will not come to an end** because we run out of material
inputs]{.underline}. [While in **theory**]{.underline}, and strictly
speaking of physical inputs, it is conceivable that [a finite planet
could be depleted of **all materials at once**]{.underline}, [as a
**practical reality** this is **not a concern**]{.underline}. Assuming
[that point]{.underline} were ever reached, it [would be in a future
**so distant** that]{.underline}, by then, [our material sources would
probably **not be confined** to this planet]{.underline}.

### AT: Extractivism/Resources Ks---'Extractivism' Oversimplifies

#### Broad theories of 'extractivism' [oversimplify]{.underline} and [inhibit]{.underline} material action against extraction.

**Szeman and Wenzel, 21**---Department of Communication Arts, University
of Waterloo; Department of English and Comparative Literature,
Department of Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African Studies, Columbia
University (Imre and Jennifer, "What do we talk about when we talk about
extractivism?," Textual Practice, 35:3, 505-523, dml)

First might be the question of travelling theory: [how well do
the]{.underline} geographical, politico-economic, and
material-ecological relations [named by extractivism **translate**
beyond a Latin American context]{.underline}, [or **across time** from
the early phase of colonial conquest]{.underline} in the sixteenth
century [to the twenty-first-century present?]{.underline} [This
question is raised]{.underline} explicitly by Terian, and tacitly
[by]{.underline} other authors' [attention]{.underline} in this special
issue [to sites in Romania]{.underline}, [Ukraine]{.underline}, [Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}, [Mozambique]{.underline}, [Ghana]{.underline}, [the
U.S. Gulf Coast]{.underline}, [and New Mexico]{.underline}; it lies,
too, at heart of Parks's instructive assessment of 'resource poetics' in
Appalachia. Indeed, [the]{.underline} itinerary of our own
[argument]{.underline}, [ranging across worlds and
continents]{.underline}, [assumes a **considerable conceptual reach**
and **mobility** for extractivism]{.underline}. Still, perhaps [it is
better to]{.underline} write of extractivisms, in order to [attend
**carefully** to]{.underline} the dynamic and diverse particularities of
relation across space and time.

Second might be [the risk of **conceptual creep** and **adjectival
ubiquity**]{.underline}. Just as Anthropocene seems to be increasingly
-- and often rather loosely -- invoked as a new synonym for modernity,
[there is a **danger** that extractivist may become the **adjective**
and **epithet du jour**]{.underline}. Along with longstanding
invocations of neoliberal globalisation, 'settler colonialism and
extractive capitalism' (to cite one recent expansionist account of
[extractivism]{.underline}) [have]{.underline} now [been added to an
**excoriating litany** of]{.underline} exploitative badness -- that is,
[the **villainous forces** shaping the past and present and deranging
the future]{.underline}.Footnote13 Our concern about this litany derives
not from any doubt about the malevolence of these forces; rather, [we
wonder about the **vitiating effects** of a **lack of terminological
precision** in adjectives whose modifying]{.underline}, [specifying
force threatens to **dissolve** into **synonymic
restatement**]{.underline}. [In too much discourse today]{.underline},
[all colonialisms are settler colonialism]{.underline}, [and all
capitalism is extractive]{.underline}, just as a notional neoliberalism
has long been the very air we breathe. Instead, what if we hold on to
extraction as a specific moment in, or aspect of, particular versions of
economic production, with implications for labour, value, and profit?
This approach would insist upon understanding extraction (or
extractivism) not as a synonym for capitalism but as one potential
aspect of it, which stands in dynamic relation to other parts (and which
also, as is sometimes forgotten, played an important role in other
economic modes, not least the political ideology and technological
developmentalism of the former Soviet Union). With regard to the
particular role of extraction within capitalism: Is the metabolic rift
between country and city identified by Marx (and traced through cultural
imaginaries by Raymond Williams) properly described as
extractive?Footnote14 How are neoliberalism's promises premised on
extraction? Are all instances of privatisation or asset-stripping to be
understood as 'extractivist', rather than only those which involve
things like land enclosures or mining concessions? What, we ask, is
extractive (or extractivist) about extractive capitalism, if, as Imre
Szeman has observed, [extraction is on its way to becoming
simply]{.underline} '[the name for **any process through which value is
generated** for capitalism]{.underline}'?Footnote15

The answer, we think, must have something to do with materiality.
Extractivism demands critical attention to the stuff of nature upon
which capitalism (or socialism, for that matter) does its work of
accumulating surplus value. The itineraries of material flows charted in
extractivism's Latin American genealogy indicate several kinds of rift
-- geographic, social, metabolic/ecological -- that create disjunctures
in the value extracted from, produced by, and returned to sites of
extraction and the lifeworlds in which they are embedded. And if
materiality matters in these ways, then [the use of extractivism as a
**conceptual umbrella term** may be **inadequate**]{.underline}, in at
least two ways: first, inadequate [to describe the **variety** of social
relations constellated around **different kinds** of
resources]{.underline} -- not only fossil fuels, but also, say, ores,
rubber, bauxite, tin, lithium, sugar, cacao, diamonds, gold, lumber,
etc.; [and]{.underline} second, inadequate [to describe how these
different resources and relations **register** in]{.underline},
[or]{.underline} otherwise [**intersect** with]{.underline}, [cultural
production]{.underline}.Footnote16 That is to say, to the extent that
one might want to speak of an extractivist aesthetic, there is perhaps
not one such aesthetic, but many.

More simply and crudely, in the terms laid out above, we might say that
extractivism names a human instrumentalisation of nonhuman nature: the
use of nature only as a means toward human ends -- or, to be slightly
less crudely universalist, a means toward the ends of some subset of
humans. The key point is that [extractivism]{.underline}, in this
specifically material and ecological sense, [is **only one form** of
instrumentalisation among many others]{.underline}. [In the
proliferation of extractivism-talk]{.underline}, however, [we notice
another troubling aspect of **conceptual creep**]{.underline}. [Enlisted
to describe other kinds of exploitative relations]{.underline} -- say,
among humans, or between humans and other sorts of things, such as texts
-- '**[extractivist]{.underline}**' [expands into a synonym
for]{.underline} '**[instrumentalist]{.underline}**', [in which **use
implies abuse**]{.underline}. [This metaphorisation]{.underline}, we
argue, [involves a simultaneous **dematerialisation**]{.underline},
[**losing** the very thing that gives extractivism its **conceptual
bite**]{.underline}.

This dematerialisation has rather different implications, depending upon
what sorts of relations are being described as extractivist. As Thomas
Waller helpfully explains with regard to political economy, contemporary
resource extraction under global capitalism has become deeply entangled
with broader trends toward financialisation, so that profits are to be
made more upon dematerialised abstractions of money than upon the gritty
materiality of 'raw materials' themselves, in ways qualitatively
different from earlier transformations of resources into money. This
example offers an important insight about the close and sometimes
counterintuitive relationships between extraction and abstraction, words
that come from the same Latin root, even if they name putatively
distinct processes of 'taking out' and 'taking from'.

The proliferation of extractivist metaphors outside the realm of
economic production has a more troubled, often unconsidered relation to
the problem of dematerialisation. Particularly tricky are the slippages
entailed in the reflexive gestures of literary critics and other
humanities scholars who examine other kinds of production -- of, say,
knowledge, or literature and literary criticism -- through the lens of
extraction. 'The colonialist theory of most efficient information
retrieval' is Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak's apt formulation to describe
the stance of First World-located feminists seeking to produce knowledge
about or from -- rather than with -- women in the Third World.Footnote17
The isomorphism between this model of knowledge production and models of
economic production based upon resource extraction may seem evident, but
the 'colonialist theory' invoked by Spivak is that of anthropology
rather than political economy. The operations through which a person
becomes a 'native informant' are not identical to those through which
nonhuman nature becomes a 'natural resource'.Footnote18 Edward W. Said
taught us long ago to recognise disciplines across the humanities and
social sciences as modes of power/knowledge constellated in Orientalism
and European imperialism. He also insisted, however, upon the varied,
'uneven exchange' among 'power political', 'power intellectual', 'power
cultural', and 'power moral'.Footnote19 With regard to extractivism as a
critical framework, Said's insight suggests that [the potential gains of
identifying congruences among various modes of (ab)using
things]{.underline} (human, nonhuman, or inhuman; inanimate or
inanimate; material or immaterial) [to make or get other
things]{.underline}, in situations of unequal power, [may be **far
outweighed** by the **loss of conceptual precision** and **force**
necessary to **understand** and **intervene** in the interwoven politics
of nature]{.underline}, [labour]{.underline}, [and
knowledge]{.underline}.

With regard to literature and literary studies, the import of
extractivist metaphors is complex and multivalent. Attention to the
actual materiality of books or their digital equivalents -- as in
Christine Okoth's insightful consideration here of TV, computer, and
tablet screens -- is a salutary reminder of the crucial terrains and
itineraries beyond that magical relay between word, eye, and mind that
are implicated in the act of reading. The publishing industry exists
within global capitalism, not in hygienic isolation from it. Recent
theories of world literature modelled after Immanuel Wallerstein's
world-systems analysis assume a congruence between economic and literary
peripheries. This framework, which attends to the ways that literature
is imbricated within economic production, is able to grasp, for example,
how the extraction and export of bauxite from Ghana can be read through
the same lens as the production of a book like Ayi Kwei Armah's The
Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born (1968). Tracing continuities in economic
and affective relations before and after Ghana's Independence, Armah's
novel grounds the postcolonial disillusion of its unnamed protagonist
partly in his job as a railway employee responsible for tracking the
movement of trains carrying minerals and timber from the Ghanaian
interior to the 'waiting Greek ships in the harbor'. The 'wailing
whistle of an old steam engine ... brought with it a vague taste of
sorrow.'Footnote20

Indeed, this link between economic and literary production was the key
insight in Jennifer Wenzel's 'Petro-Magic-Realism: Toward a Political
Ecology of Nigerian Literature', which identified similarities among
what we might now call 'extractive' economies involving commodity
exports of palm oil, petroleum, and literature-for-publication by
metropolitan presses; the nineteenth-century Euro-African trade in palm
products was itself a shift toward 'legitimate' commerce after the
British abolition of the slave trade.Footnote21 Yet what does it mean to
understand literature as a commodity within the translocal itineraries
assumed by the framework of extractivism? Terian argues here that
'magical realism was indeed born as a reaction to extractivism' -- an
observation that must be juxtaposed with arguments by critics like
Graham Huggan, Sarah Brouillette, Stephen Slemon, and Michael Valdez
Moses, about the ways in which magical realism also functions as a
marketing category for publishers or a homogenising catch-all notion of
exotic 'difference' for readers.Footnote22 If literature is something
like an extractable commodity, then its very production is subject to
pressures of demand. Waller emphasizes the pressure of such metropolitan
expectations on literary production; he argues suggestively that the
spectral non-referentiality of João Paulo Borges Coelho's Campo de
Trânsito must be understood in terms of the 'correspondence between
dematerialised forms of capital and the abstractions of narrative
modes', in which the 'hemorrhaging of domestic capital' registers
stylistically as a refusal of 'local colour'.

Learning to read for extractivism while not doing extractivism is, it
seems, no simple matter, given these ways in which readers are
implicated in the economics of literary production, as well as the
proliferation of mining metaphors to describe the acts of reading and
interpretation. Yet [is reading **really so similar** to
mining?]{.underline} [Is meaning really a **finite**]{.underline},
**[non-renewable resource]{.underline}**, [whose production depletes the
source]{.underline} ([and immiserates those at the site of
extraction]{.underline})[?]{.underline} [Is the energy consumed or
produced by processes of interpretation **truly** like the **burning of
fossil fuels**?]{.underline} Cronon might argue for a 'middle ground,'
an interpretive relation of use that is not abuse. With regard to the
recent emergence of energy humanities, we would situate Elizabeth
Barrios's central claim -- that literary critics did not learn to read
oil novels as instances of petroculture until they confronted the threat
of climate change -- within a much longer, geographically-varied
history, to which her own essay attests with its attention to a
decades-long tradition of oil novels and petrocriticism in Venezuela.

Literary, literary-critical, and broader civic attention to fossil fuels
(perhaps, interestingly, less so to other kinds of extraction) has long
been driven by crisis, whether (to name only a few) the dislocations of
the 'oil encounter' at drill sites around the world, the oil shocks of
the 1970s (and subsequent scarcity panics), U.S. wars in the Persian
Gulf, the execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa in Nigeria, and the one-two punch
of Hurricane Katrina and the Deepwater Horizon blowout in the U.S. Gulf
Coast. As Frederick Buell has shown, denial about fossil fuels has been
punctuated by these moments of periodic crisis and concern, which
predate sustained public concern about climate change.Footnote23
Barrios's excavation of a robust, longstanding tradition of fiction and
criticism in Venezuela implicitly contradicts claims (such as those
famously made by Amitav Ghosh, writing in 1992, in the wake of the first
Gulf War) about the dearth of 'oil novels' or lack of critical interest
in them, although this exception might well reinforce the rule for which
Ghosh argues in his more recent book.Footnote24 Remember Chakrabarty's
assessment of the connection of democracy with energy: seldom has fossil
fuel use been explicitly connected with the shape of political forms,
and their possibilities or impossibilities (which is not the same as
saying that oil has not had a role to play in geopolitics.)Footnote25
Despite the constitutive role played by fossil fuels and other forms of
extraction in shaping every aspect of every element of modernity, both
in and beyond energy crises, literature has rarely imagined extraction
to be anything more than a means of achieving power and money, when it
has attended to energy and extraction at all.

Given this constitutive absence, one which is not filled in by recent
literary-critical attempts to locate oil fictions wherever they might
be, the consolidation of the energy humanities still offers an important
transnational forum and comparative perspective to conversations that
had previously been contained within national or regional literary
traditions (e.g. Venezuela/Latin America or Nigeria/Africa). The lesson
we draw from reading Barrios's essay, given its attention to the
Venezuelan example, is the imperative to historicise and provincialise
claims about the 'we' constituted by petromodernity, so that energy
humanities does not entrench as an unexamined universalist norm what are
actually bourgeois North American subjectivities shaped by 'fictions of
surplus', and by distance from sites of extraction.Footnote26 Indeed, we
find surprising and instructive resonances among Okoth's account of the
historical intersections between mineral extraction and racial
subjection at Elmina Castle (whose very name bears the trace of these
superimposed economies), Andrei Rogatchevski's account of miners'
underground solidarities in Ukraine and beyond, and Krieg's account of
'coal optimism' in Appalachia. These fascinating essays resist the
too-easy analytic gesture of simply lumping in humans with nonhuman
nature as objects of extraction; they tease apart processes involving
the extraction of wealth from beneath the soil and above it, on the one
hand, from the related but distinct operations of racialisation or class
stratification and solidarity, on the other. In his account of what
Stephanie LeMenager might call loving extraction, Krieg attends to
ambivalent attachments of those whom an extractivist framework might
describe simply as exploited or immiserated.Footnote27 Affect seems to
follow a different trajectory in the imaginary than resource flows do in
global capitalism -- an insight with important implications for
politics, as we suggest below.

Our argument up to this point has focused on the dangers of [conceding
**too much conceptual ground** to a concept of extraction that has
become generalised and generalisable]{.underline}. One of the perils of
extractivism is that it [tends to **flatten** the ground]{.underline},
[**collapsing** historical]{.underline}, [geographical]{.underline},
[and cultural distinctions that should be important to **fully
understanding** the specific operations of extraction]{.underline},
[including the ideologies and imaginaries that surround it at any given
time and in any given space]{.underline}. There is a second peril that
emerges out of this generalisation of extraction, in what might seem at
first glance to be a contradictory process. [Extractivism enables
extraction to become a process **writ large**]{.underline}, [the name
for **any kind** of taking out or drawing out]{.underline} -- [whether
of iron ore and oil]{.underline}, [value]{.underline},
[work]{.underline}, [data]{.underline}, [or meaning]{.underline},
[or]{.underline} indeed [any other process that appears to fit the
mould]{.underline}. There's no problem per se with the metaphoric or
rhetorical use of extraction to speak to the outcomes of different
practices; literature professors have long urged their students to
extract meaning from the texts they're reading, or to exploit quotes
they borrow from others in order to make their own arguments. [The
problem]{.underline} we are pointing to [emerges]{.underline} only [when
an **equivalence** is drawn between extraction of]{.underline} this kind
-- **[meaning]{.underline}**, via the reading of a literary text -- [and
a very different mode of extraction of]{.underline} different sorts of
**[objects]{.underline}**: mining coal, drilling for oil, harvesting
timber.

Why have these broad connections been made? What critical impulse drives
the use of extractivism to simultaneously flatten the ground and, at the
same time, to expand the field of extraction to name incommensurable
processes at work in very different kinds of practices and activities?
For the two of us, the answer lies in a gathering sense of urgency and
planetary emergency. Environmental literary criticism has taken on a
difficult mission. Like other forms of contemporary criticism, the
environmental humanities not only aim to interpret and understand (let's
say, to keep things simple) representations of environment and nature
within cultural expression, but also to assess the politics of texts,
practices, and performances -- and to intervene in these politics. This
interpretive work -- the work of making careful sense of multivalent
processes of mediation -- is carried out in relation to a set of
questions that demand immediate answers: climate change and the threat
posed by human activity such as extraction to everything on the planet,
living and non-living. There is a necessary urgency to this work; there
is a desire for critical writing to be part of the solution to climate
change, to participate in whatever way it can in activating new
relations and imaginaries that would, for example, take the place of
resource logics. Everything depends on it.

But just how can literary criticism have an impact on the environment?
How can it effectively take on the dual mission it has set itself as a
critical practice? The two of us have certainly struggled with these
questions ourselves, as we've wondered about how a professionalised
practice with a very small audience composed almost exclusively of
fellow professionals can intervene in climate change and other crises
with the same impact that, for instance, movements of Indigenous people
or large eNGOs have managed to do. As humanities scholars, what form
does our politics take? Just whom are we speaking to when we write about
processes like extraction? Pondering a similar set of questions,
Lawrence Buell suggested that professors and teachers of ecocriticism
had an impact through a kind of 'trickle down' effect: students who took
classes with environmentally-minded critics would slowly spread the
word, so that environmental consciousness would move through the
population like a virus and change dominant ideologies about nature
subtly, but powerfully.Footnote28 As we have all learned, some viruses
do spread quickly. But others move very slowly indeed, especially given
the number of students enrolled in English programmes, and the fewer
still who take classes devoted specifically to eco-criticism.

Extractivism seems to offer a way around some of the anxieties and
doubts that surround this nagging question of why we do the work we do,
in the midst of the troubles we face. If extraction names simply the
removal of natural resources from the earth, there really isn't very
much that literary criticism can say about it, at least not for the
reasons and with the effect it hopes to have by assessing extraction in
the first place. There are other disciplines that speak to specific
politics surrounding a site of extraction with more force than we do,
and there are other voices -- journalists, policymakers, those working
for NGOs, filmmakers, and artists -- who have more successfully raised
attention to the systemic violence that attends extraction.

But note: [the moment one adds the]{.underline} suffix
**[-ism]{.underline}** to the noun, [extraction is **transformed** into
a system or ideology]{.underline}, a representational and symbolic space
linked to the use (and abuse) of nature-as-resource. Here,
[suddenly]{.underline}, extraction is made available to humanists, who
can set themselves [the task of naming and codifying the elements
comprising this ideology]{.underline}, whether understood as
extraction's backstory or the ongoing mechanisms that permit the violent
continuation of extraction. The gritty materiality of extractivism [is a
way of **getting one's critical hands dirty**]{.underline}, in a good
way. For literary critics, this work on ideology takes place in relation
to literary texts, tracking how they tacitly participate in the
production of extractivism, which is always understood in advance to
extend well beyond the literary into other representational realms, or
probing those texts that imagine themselves as also naming extractivism
-- a form of literary politics distinct from merely registering or
representing extraction itself. By naming, we have in mind the kinds of
moves that bring into focus the hitherto unsaid, unseen, tacit,
implicit, ambient, air-we-breathe assumptions, norms, and forces that
suffuse texts and lifeworlds alike -- sometimes through a figure-ground
reversal in which the taken-for-granted becomes impossible to ignore.
One might say that a particularly sophisticated mode of such naming also
looks reflexively at the critic's own practice and situation, so that
possible (if problematic) homologies between, say, reading and mining
loom large.

It is probably for this reason that [extractivism gets written into
**all manner of practices**]{.underline}. The presumption is that a
dominant ideology is absorbed by every practice, by every aspect of a
given configuration of power.Footnote29 Thus, [once one
starts]{.underline} reading for oil or [looking for
extractivism]{.underline}, [one finds and names it
**everywhere**]{.underline} -- [but on **freshly flattened
ground**]{.underline}. [And after such naming]{.underline}, [**then
what**?]{.underline} [Out in the world]{.underline}, **[the digging
continues]{.underline}**. [This is not to say that critical or
pedagogical work has no effect]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} to
acknowledge that [the site of its intervention is **almost never** the
site of extraction]{.underline}. And that [a critical goal set in
advance]{.underline} of reading any given text [is likely to find **holy
grails** that **impede** a more complex understanding]{.underline} of
the text, the world, and the critic's place in it. (Relevant here is the
sometime reduction of 'theory' to a pre-constituted set of assumptions
about the precise nature of social and political forces and practices,
taken from outside the realm of the literary, and 'applied' to the text
at hand, thereby demonstrating the validity of the theory -- as opposed
to attending to the modes of intelligence and forms of mediation at work
within the text and the critic's relation to it, and how they intersect
with those forces and practices in ways that the 'theory' cannot
predict.) All too often, in other words, naming extractivism as an
ideology to be interrogated means the critic knows in advance how to
think about the text, rather than thinking with it, or watching it
think.

At worst, [the invocation of]{.underline} a word like [extractivism may
be a **shortcut** for establishing one's political bona
fides]{.underline}, possibly in a litany of badness as described above.
The invocation of a concept like Jacques Rancière's 'distribution of the
sensible', for example, may assume that the critic can muster sufficient
leverage or traction to accomplish the work of redistribution, while
forgetting that critics and authors inhabit the regime of the sensible
on which they hope to work.Footnote30 Or that other kinds of
redistribution -- for which criticism and theory offer less immediate
results -- remain urgently necessary. And still, out in the world, the
digging continues. The two of us worry, in other words, about these ways
in which literature and literary [criticism imagine for themselves a
**lead role** in the game of politics that is almost in **inverse
proportion** to their **actual social import** at the present
moment]{.underline} -- wanting, like Mungau in Borges Coelho's Campo de
Trânsito, to see the world with bigger eyes than those we possess. As
Krieg writes bleakly, [there is a world of difference
between]{.underline} literature understood as a mode of **[affect
management]{.underline}**, on the one hand, [and
undertaking]{.underline} '**[material struggles]{.underline}** for
democratic control over the means by which society reproduces itself',
on the other. A similar tension is at work in Parks's citation of Mark
Nowak's trenchant query, '"Where are the poems in dialogue with these
global peoples' movements?"'. To put it all too bluntly: [despite the
laudable]{.underline} (and necessary) [ethical and political aims that
underlie]{.underline} the literary [critical interrogation of
extractivism]{.underline}, in the very worst forms of its expression [it
risks becoming simply a means of making it possible for criticism to
**believe itself** to be **participating actively** in environmental
change]{.underline}, by contributing disciplinary insights that can come
from nowhere else. Okoth perhaps has a similar concern in mind when she
observes that literature's role is not merely diagnostic, 'pointing to
sites of extraction across the globe and lamenting the state of
ecological damage. Rather, literature can identify the forms that
extraction produces and appropriate those same forms in pursuit of
politically and culturally formal reinvention'.

### AT: IR Ks

#### IR isn't intrinsically Western. Rejecting it wholesale falls for the [essentialism trap]{.underline} and [reinforces]{.underline} the status quo.

**Barnett and Zarakol, 23**---Professor of International Affairs and
Political Science, Elliott School of International Affairs, George
Washington University; Professor of International Relations at the
University of Cambridge (Michael and Ayşe; "Global international
relations and the essentialism trap," International Theory, Volume 15,
Issue 3, 428-444, dml)

First, as noted above, essentialism provides a 'common sense' for the
practice and theorization of world politics. Essentialized categories
are almost required for those who want to understand strategic and
instrumental action.Footnote 48 [Any time categories of analysis are
invoked]{.underline}, [there is also]{.underline} necessarily a moment
of **[reification]{.underline}**, of fixing meanings. Indeed, [by
[naming]{.mark}]{.underline} 'Global **[[IR]{.underline}]{.mark}**' [[as
a]{.underline}]{.mark} '[**[thing]{.underline}**']{.mark} [that displays
certain]{.underline} '**[tendencies]{.underline}**', [we [could
be]{.mark}]{.underline} read as
**[[essentializing]{.underline}]{.mark}** our object of enquiry, [[even
as we **critique**]{.mark} advocates of]{.underline} Global IR for
[doing]{.underline} just [this]{.underline}. [The same can be said of
many other terms we invoke]{.underline}:
'**[[mainstream]{.underline}]{.mark}**' [[IR]{.underline}]{.mark},
'**[[the West]{.underline}]{.mark}**', [[and more]{.underline}]{.mark}.
However, there is a major difference between recognizing that naming
objects involves 'as if' assumptions about their intersubjective meaning
and relative stability, and resting claims, whether descriptive,
interpretative or explanatory, on the essential properties of these
objects. [The [assumption that]{.mark} countries and [regions
have]{.mark}]{.underline} '[[**radically different** histories
and]{.mark} political [theories]{.mark} than that of the
**West**]{.underline}' [[relies on claims about **homogenous
units**]{.underline}]{.mark} that are inscribed within unique historical
points of origin that, in turn, generate singular, or at least
distinctive, cultural packages -- and, hence, different theoretical
traditions.Footnote 49 Of course, lived experiences are hugely important
to the creation of lifeworlds -- [place matters]{.underline}.
[And]{.underline} equally importantly, [many]{.underline} of the
[[units]{.mark} of analysis]{.underline} that are examined in world
politics [[are stable]{.mark} and]{.underline}, oftentimes, highly
[resilient]{.underline}: religions, states, racism, and more.
[[But]{.mark} this does [not]{.mark} make them
**[static]{.mark}**]{.underline}: [[religions are
**reconfigured**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[the character of states
**ebbs** and **flows**]{.underline},]{.mark} [[racism takes **diverse
forms**]{.mark} across time and place]{.underline}. And these shifts are
not just the product of interactions between units. Rather, they are
generated by the interplay between peoples, belief-systems, forms of
governance, modes of exchange, and more. A relational understanding of
'things' does not deny the importance of enduring patterns or relatively
stability within objects of analysis. [It would be
**[impossible]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and **nonsensical**]{.underline},
[[to claim that states]{.underline}]{.mark}, [regions]{.underline}, [and
similar entities [were **not meaningful categories**]{.mark} of
analysis]{.underline}. A mix of relational social theory and global
history can help both to disrupt 'common sense' essentialism,Footnote 50
however, and serve as an alternative way of examining the space opened
up by Global IR.

Second, [[essentialism]{.mark} is **hard to dislodge** because of
disciplinary logics]{.underline}. Disciplines have material,
institutional, and epistemic resources [that **[reinforce the status
quo]{.mark}**]{.underline}.Footnote 51 IR is no exception. As noted
above, IR also often adopts features of radical challenges that help to
maintain its legitimacy. At present, Global IR is [[mixing a]{.mark}
more [radical]{.mark} normative [agenda with a conventional
ontology]{.mark}]{.underline}. This [[leaves it **vulnerable to
cooptation**]{.mark} as a kind of disciplinary]{.underline}
'**[diversity plan]{.underline}**'. For example, [a
**core**]{.underline} aspiration of Global IR is to recover the agency
of actors in the Global South. The [**point** is]{.underline} well-made:
[Western IR scholarship has written history as if the **only actors that
mattered** were **Western**]{.underline}. By placing non-Western
traditions on an equal footing with Western concepts and
theories,Footnote 52 it is argued, IR can be 'reimagined' as a site of
'plural universalism': many civilizations within one world.Footnote 53
However, [this is a **thin form of globalizing** in which representation
emerges from the **sum of its parts** rather than]{.underline} the
[deep-rooted]{.underline}, [entangled histories]{.underline} that forge
global order. The papers in this symposium outline an agenda premised on
a more consistent link between ethical intent and ontology, with the
potential to develop Global IR in novel directions. We hope to replace
an 'add and stir' strategy with a 'global all the way down' approach
that deepens the remit of the Global IR project.

The third dynamic driving Global IR towards the
[[essentialism]{.underline}]{.mark} trap is the way in which its
advocates contain a particular form of standpoint epistemology.
Standpoint epistemology is rooted in the notion that worldviews emerge
from positionalities: what we think derives from where we stand.Footnote
54 This view [[lies at the **heart** of]{.mark} attempts to think IR
from **[different starting points]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- from a
distinct positionality, it is argued, comes a distinctive set of
interests.Footnote 55 This assumption also lies at the heart of
decolonial scholarship, which rests on a geo-epistemological standpoint
underlining cultural dissonance. In both cases, identities shape both
how actors act in the world and how we, as observers, see it. [If
actors]{.underline} '**[know]{.underline}**' [the world through their
**positionalities**]{.underline} (geography, race, class, gender,
political alignment, and so on), scholars also 'know' the world through
[these contexts]{.underline}. Positionalities [are
**inescapable**]{.underline}. The question then becomes: what forms of
knowledge production are adequate once the centrality of positionality
to worldviews is recognized? Standpoint theory valorizes 'insider'
perspectives for very good reasons -- it helps to empower peoples and
communities who have been silenced by hegemonic practices and reveals
that these practices are themselves perspectival. Yet [when]{.underline}
'**[insider]{.underline}**' [positions become the **only way** in which
[valid]{.mark} scholarly [knowledge production]{.mark}
operates]{.underline}, [then]{.underline} it follows that only Chinese
scholars can teach and research about China, only Muslims about Islam,
only white men about white men, and so on.

In this way, [we return to the **essentialism trap**]{.underline}, one
[in which the authorization to take part in conversations]{.underline}
about 'insider' concerns [[is **restricted** to]{.underline}]{.mark}
'**[insiders]{.underline}**' who can be identified, [through
**[preordained positionalities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In such cases, it
is often geography that denotes 'authentic' subjectivity. And this
subjectivity, in turn, represents the limits of our communities. To
reiterate: there are sound reasons why standpoint epistemologies are
mobilized to certify lived experiences that have been violently
suppressed through exploitation. But in scholarship, [there is a need
for **caution**]{.underline}, not least [because this positionality can
serve as [a form of]{.mark}]{.underline} 'primitivism' that rests on the
**[[idealization]{.underline}]{.mark}** of a supposed 'prelapsarian
innocence'.Footnote 56 [[It can also be **vulnerable to**]{.mark}
**cooptation** by powerful [elites]{.mark}]{.underline}, [becoming
deployed in tandem with [claims to authority]{.mark} [that rest
on]{.mark} notions of **[cultural authenticity]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[something made more likely by trends towards
**authoritarianism**]{.underline} of various kinds.Footnote 57 [[The
**unintended consequence**]{.underline}]{.mark} of a movement seeking to
open up the discipline to more diverse voices then [[could be to
sustain]{.mark} political forces that promote
**[narrow]{.mark}**]{.underline}, even [**[chauvinistic]{.underline}**,
[agendas]{.underline}]{.mark}. In IR\'s current operating environment,
claims around 'pluralism' can lead towards closure rather than openness.

Whatever important work standpoint theory does politically, therefore,
we do not think it should serve as the only basis for the scholarly
project of Global IR. [To see positionality]{.underline}, whether around
geography or culture, [as the **start**]{.underline} -- [and
**end**]{.underline} -- [of conversations about]{.underline} Global [IR
is]{.underline}, we think, [a **limited vision**]{.underline} of the
project\'s potential. The challenge is to represent diversity without
essentializing difference. The articles in this symposium take up this
challenge by identifying both distinct experiences and the deep
connections between social sites 'at home' and 'over there', the
'foreign' and the 'domestic', the 'East' and the 'West', 'metropole' and
'colony'. Standpoint epistemologies can occlude these connections and
the wider dynamics they are embedded within. This symposium inverts this
approach, seeing connections as the basis of units. The foundations of
this approach lie in a relational ontology.

Escape velocity: relationalism and global history

Relationalism takes many forms, from the familiar (some varieties of
constructivism) to the avant-garde (quantum-inspired
hyperhumanism).Footnote 58 Although the differences between forms of
relationalism are considerable, all relational approaches recognize that
relations are prior to and produce entities. Tilly\'s processual
sociology, for instance, is pitched against the presumption of 'coherent
durable monads' to the neglect of 'contingent, transitory connections
among socially constructed identities.'Footnote 59 According to Tilly,
bad habits have been passed down by his generation:

We learned and in turn taught a practice of this sort: (1) assume a
coherent durable, self-propelling social unit; (2) attribute a general
condition or process to that unit; (3) invoke or invent an invariant
model of that condition or process; (4) explain the behavior of the unit
on the basis of its conformity to that invariant model.Footnote 60

For Tilly and other relational thinkers, this procedure will not do.
Emirbayer makes clear what is at stake: 'whether to conceive of the
social world as consisting primarily in substances or in processes, in
static 'things' or in dynamic unfolding relations.'Footnote 61
Relational thinkers do not argue that interests, goals, and identities
cannot be stable. Rather, their position is that, however stable, these
entities are forged relationally and subject to ongoing logics of
reproduction and contestation. [[The West]{.underline}]{.mark}, for
example, [[is **not**]{.mark} **a [fixed]{.mark} entity** that existed
prior to its engagement with the non-Western world]{.underline} --
[transboundary relations between Western and non-Western societies led
to a **change** in their organizing logics]{.underline},
[positions]{.underline}, [and sense of the world]{.underline}.
Similarly, [the idea of [the West and]{.mark} the [institutions]{.mark}
that support it [are]{.mark} **regularly
[reassessed]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,
**[contested]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [[and
**reproduced**]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is an entity-in-motion. Against
claims of constancy, relational accounts stress the ways in which
traditions are always living.

Relations may be fleeting or enduring, deep or superficial, direct or
indirect, mono- or multi-directional, interpersonal or impersonal. To
assess their significance, [we need to know **which** relations matter
and **when**]{.underline}, **[where]{.underline}**, [and **how** they do
so]{.underline}. This directs attention to sites where relations cohere
(e.g. borders), actors that direct relations (e.g. powerful polities),
gaps where relations are sparse or reversible (e.g. extractive regimes),
and historical moments when relations break or global integration is
either stopped or reversed (e.g. aspects of contemporary world
politics). This symposium, therefore, seeks to identify patterns of
connections: the structural entanglements, premised on asymmetrical
power relations, which generate processes of historical development.
Relations, hypothetically speaking, can be egalitarian, but most social
relations that concern IR are defined by inequality and hierarchy. Our
concern is with the ways in which relations generate systems of
stratification: racial, epistemic, geographic, and more.

Despite this shared concern with hierarchical patterns of global order,
the symposium offers a major challenge to the use of essentialism and
its auxiliary claims in Global IR. Against essentialism, it replaces the
starting point of units as entities-with-fixed-attributes with the
notion of units as entities-in-motion. Against substantialism,
relational approaches argue that it is connections between social sites
that produce the entities that are often treated as having an essence:
cultures, geographies, nations, regions, civilizations, and more. In
contrast to internalism, relationalism stresses the entanglements
between 'inside' and 'outside' that are generative of historical
development. Against methodological nationalism, this approach points to
the ways in which actors and units are nested within broader scales.
Taken together, these moves have two main components: first, the papers
in this symposium identify the ways in which historical processes are
boundary-crossing; second, they theorize these boundary-crossing
connections as patterns of entanglements. The result is an interest in
systems of stratification. A relational starting point leads, in turn,
to a focus on transboundary connections, structural entanglements, and
systems of stratification.

The aim of Global IR is to use the openness of the contemporary
conjuncture to reform or recast core components of the discipline: its
forms of epistemic certification, its geographical range, its conceptual
grids, and more. We want this project to succeed. However, for this to
happen, we think that Global IR must avoid the gravitational pull
presented by the essentialism trap. This symposium sets out some ways in
which this trap might be avoided and articulates another way of
advancing Global IR.

The first article, by Barkawi, Murray, and Zarakol, analyses the
underlying power dynamics that have pulled the Global IR project in
potentially problematic directions. It argues that both American and
Global IR share a Eurocentric spatial imaginary, one that was a product
of Western expansion and empire. [Insisting that geographical
representation]{.underline} -- geo-epistemology -- [is the **solution**
to the problem of Eurocentrism]{.underline} (or American bias)
reproduces the very problems Global IR seeks to address, and
**[traps]{.underline}** Global [IR in **essentialist
representation**]{.underline}. The second article extends this analysis
by examining the ways in which proponents of Global IR read IR\'s
disciplinary history. Focusing on India, Bayly shows how a relational
sociology of disciplinary knowledge, rooted in imperial knowledge
complexes, provides an account of disciplinary IR as 'global at birth',
a globality that has subsequently been occluded in favour of a more
essentialist reading of a singular birth story. Also deploying insights
from global history, the third article, by Hui, questions if students of
historical Asia who challenge Western IR for 'getting Asia wrong' do
'get Asia right'. The paper de-essentializes 'China\'s hegemony' by
disaggregating the concept of 'China' and examining the multivocal and
contradictory reactions of China\'s neighbours in the full universe of
China\'s relevant relations across Asia. The final article, by Barnett
and Lawson, demonstrates one way of achieving the relational escape
velocity discussed above by providing a reappraisal of one of the
central theoretical concerns in contemporary IR: the notion of global
order. The symposium closes with a series of critical reflections on its
main themes by Pardesi, Çapan, and Yunis.

Recognizing that we have been here before is important in terms of
analysing what is at stake in contemporary debates about Global IR. It
is equally important for attempts, such as ours, to generate alternative
ways of theorizing the global. Each of the papers in this symposium
therefore rests on a shared sense of critique (essentialism and its
auxiliary assumptions) but develops its own particular remedy
(relational accounts premised on transboundary connections, structural
entanglements, and systems of stratification). [The
takeaway]{.underline} from the symposium [is not]{.underline},
therefore, [a **single**]{.underline} '**[solution]{.underline}**' [for
where IR theory]{.underline} in general, or Global IR in particular,
[should go]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} rather [a series of
openings]{.underline} through [which IR theory can use]{.underline} the
current crisis [**productively** rather than as another means of
**closure**]{.underline}. But the symposium promises more than this. It
argues that [[**engagement** with]{.underline}]{.mark} global history,
alongside a relational ontology, helps to provide theoretical resources
-- connections, entanglements, stratification -- that can underpin
Global [[IR\'s research agenda]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is an agenda, we
think, that [[is **rich in possibilities**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### AT: Liberalism Ks

#### Liberal norms of law and sovereignty [reduce international conflict]{.underline}.

**Gill-Tiney, 22**---Lecturer, Department of Politics and International
Relations, University of Oxford (Patrick, "A Liberal Peace?: The Growth
of Liberal Norms and the Decline of Interstate Violence," Journal of
Conflict Resolution, 2022, Vol. 66(3), 413--442, dml)

This article shows that [[liberal]{.mark} interpretations of
**[sovereignty]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [which [emphasize]{.mark}
**[i]{.mark}nternational [law]{.mark}**]{.underline},
**[[interdependence]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[free
[trade]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [**[democracy]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**individual [rights]{.mark}** and **freedoms**]{.underline}, [have
become **increasingly prevalent**]{.underline} in UN Security Council
resolutions since 1970. Given that two non-western states, Russia/Soviet
Union and China, are permanent members, I argue that the content of
these resolutions reflects broad consensus between major powers---both
western and non-western---as how these norms should be interpreted. This
is not the same as arguing that these states share preferences or
interests, rather, substantial differences remain, largely along the
cleavage between the United States, Britain and France on the one hand
and China and Russia on the other (Einsiedel and Malone 2018, 156-58).1
Yet, the collective positions of these states have evolved over time,
suggesting a shift in how sovereignty is understood. The dominant role
that these states have in shaping the international order means that
[their collective understandings may be taken as representative of the
**normative structure** of international society at any point in
time]{.underline}, [with the expectation that this impacts **all**
states in the system]{.underline}.2

I argue that [[as liberal]{.mark} interpretations of these fundamental
[norms **increase**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[the **likelihood
of**]{.underline}]{.mark} a dispute participant resorting to
**[[violence decreases]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Through content analysis
of all UN Security Council resolutions between 1970 and 2014 I first
create a measure of the strength of liberal interpretations of
sovereignty. This is then utilized in quantitative analysis of dispute
participants in the period to explain the variation in the level of
violence employed. [I find **statistical** and **substantive support**
for my theory]{.underline}, [showing **[empirically]{.mark}** that [the
growth]{.mark} in liberal norm interpretations [is **negatively
associated**]{.mark} with the likelihood of]{.underline} a state
resorting to [violence]{.underline} in an interstate dispute.

[This is [not]{.mark} to argue [that structural]{.mark}
[arg]{.mark}ument[s]{.mark} [are **wrong**]{.mark}]{.underline}, far
from it, [nor is it to **reject** the roles of conventional and nuclear
capabilities]{.underline} in shaping interstate conflict behavior.
[[Rather]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[state power does
matter]{.underline}]{.mark}**, that is why the collective
interpretations of the permanent members of the UN Security Council are
used to understand the system. Domestic veto players, intergovernmental
enforcement mechanisms, and trade dependency all do shape the responses
of policymakers during an interstate dispute. However, [the
**intersubjective ideas** they carry with them into disputes
are]{.underline} also [**crucial** to understand why some disputes
**escalate**]{.underline}, [and others do **not**]{.underline}.

This article contributes to our understanding of the role that ideas
have in shaping interstate conflict in two ways. Firstly, I contribute
to the large literature which has sought to understand the role which
norms play in selecting for certain behaviors over others. Most of the
work within this area has been qualitative and has either charted the
development of specific bundles of norms over long periods (Keene 2012,
2013; Risse, Ropp, and Sikkink 1999; Sandholtz 2007) or focused on the
life-cycle of specific norms (Eckstein 1988; Finnemore 2000; Finnemore
and Sikkink 1998; Krook and True 2012; Nadelmann 1990; Sandholtz 2007;
Sandholtz and Stiles 2008). I build upon these insights by arguing that
the norm of sovereignty has been re-interpreted over time, and that the
collective nature of reinterpretation means that it can be used to
examine its impact in interstate conflict.

Secondly, this article provides an innovative means of exploring ideas
in a quantitative framework. The quantitative interstate conflict
literature has heavily favored structural and power-based explanations
for actor behavior. This has come at the particular expense of norms.
Whilst there is widespread acceptance that norms matter amongst these
scholars, they have tended to set aside norm-based explanations given
the difficulty of objective measurement. This difficulty revolves around
the problem of having surety that multiple actors share an idea, that
is, intersubjective understanding. The most obvious sources of data to
assess this would be a survey of policymakers or the content of
international legal documents. This first avenue is incredibly difficult
to gain anything but anecdotal responses too. Policymakers are hard to
get access to and may misrepresent their own thoughts and actions to
show themselves in as best light as possible. Ensuring that any
respondents have understood the survey in the same way is difficult
given language differences, whilst response rates are likely to be so
low as to prevent a non-random sample from being acquired, even if the
potential pool of relevant participants is widened to include all senior
politicians and bureaucrats, both incumbent and preceding.

Some of these problems are resolved by utilizing the texts of
international legal documents. Given that these are generally carefully
and cautiously written the researcher is more certain that the drafters
actually share an understanding of the topic. Recent work by Allee and
co-authors (Allee, Elsig, and Lugg 2017; Allee and Lugg 2016) have
innovatively utilized content analysis of interstate trade deals to
explore how much is replicated in subsequent deals, which sheds light on
the relative power of the participants. This has certainly gained deeper
understanding of the topic, but is not a suitable approach for this
research questions for two reasons. Firstly, these deals are generally
drafted by small numbers of states, that is, they may not be assumed to
represent the preferences and interests of nonparties. Secondly, whilst
interpretations are spelled out, these may be mechanistic rather than
ideational, making it unclear what the broader normative position may
be. This is made more acute by the drafting being down by bureaucrats
and lawyers rather than policymakers themselves. Whilst some direction
is no-doubt given by the latter, assuming a high level is problematic.
Utilizing the content of UN Security Council resolutions addresses these
problems because the documents may be assumed to be political, that is,
though member states are represented by ambassadors, a high-level of
involvement by their state governments is typical given the importance
attached to security issues. Moreover, since the permanent membership is
diverse in interests and preferences, and these members can veto
unpalatable resolutions, they may be reasonably assumed to provide
insight into intersubjective understandings.

Existing Explanations of Interstate Conflict and the Role of Norms

Two existing literatures are built on here, firstly, the broad
democratic peace literature, including its offshoots and opponents, and
secondly, scholarship on the evolution of international norms. The
former literature initially focused upon regime type, and over time has
been widened to include more fine-grained analyses of domestic political
structures in any state (Bell and Quek 2018; Fearon 1994; Gries et al.
2020; Huth and Allee 2002; Tomz, Weeks, and Yarhi-Milo 2020; Weeks 2012;
Weiss 2013; Weiss and Dafoe 2019). However, the approach in all of these
works is to examine structures, that is, formal institutional
constraints encountered by decision makers, rather than norms, that is,
the role of shared principles, perceptions and expectations of behavior.
The distinction between norms and structure is not rigid. This is most
clearly seen in the term "institution" which is commonly used to mean
both formal structures which limit the agency of decision makers, but
also a set of norms, rules, and practices which govern a specific area.
To clarify the distinction being made in this article, I adapt the
nomenclature used by Reus-Smit (1999) who distinguishes between
constitutional institutions, norms without which a society of states
could not exist, and fundamental institutions, which facilitate
cooperation. The former includes sovereignty, as well as the rights of
self-determination and nonintervention, and the latter contractual
international law and the organizations which enforce it (both internal
and external to states). In this article, I term the former "norms" and
the latter "structures."

The democratic peace literature has spurred several offshoots, the most
relevant of which are those which have argued that rather than regime
type the "peace" is generated by economic factors including trade
interdependency and level of development (Gartzke 2007; Hegre 2000; Kim
2014; Kinne 2012; McDonald 2009, 2010; Mousseau 2013; Schneider and
Gleditsch 2010) or shared intergovernmental organization membership
(Appel 2018; Kinne 2013a, 2013b; Prorok and Appel 2014). More general
critiques have argued that any effect seen is due to the prior
settlement of territorial disputes (Gibler 2012; Gibler and Tir 2014;
Owsiak 2012), nuclear weapons (Waltz 1990), alliances (Kydd 2005),
unipolarity (Monteiro 2014) or military power (Layne 1994; Rosato 2003)
instead. With the exception of the latter critiques, this debate has
broadly accepted the importance of norms (Doyle 1986; Moravcsik 1997;
Owen 1994; Russett and Oneal 2001), especially as the "good" functioning
of domestic and international structures, particularly veto players,
requires political actors to have the right norms.

This relationship between norms and structures has been more closely
addressed through the focus on contracts, that is, to hone in on
specific economic norms and structures characterized as allowing an
economic market to function "with extensive and regularized transactions
among strangers that require an element of trust" (Mousseau and Xiongwei
2018, sec. Emergence Contractualist Peace). This literature argues that
the relationship between peace and democracy is spurious, and rather,
that both are explained by "contracturalist" norms and structures (Gelpi
and Grieco 2008; Mousseau, Hegre, and O'Neal 2003), which builds upon
the work of (Acemoglu and Robinson 2006; Dahl 1997; North, Wallis, and
Weingast 2009). Yet, the literature still relies upon
operationalizations which are essentially structural, that is, whilst
recognizing the importance of norms, the empirical testing has fallen
short.

A comparatively small subset of the literature has examined norms as an
explanation for the democratic peace. For Deutsch (1957), though NATO is
understood as a structure, a security community is more crucially formed
around shared values (norms). Kahl argues that the basis of the
democratic peace is collective identity rooted in liberal democracy
interlinked by intergovernmental organizations (1998). For Risse, the
influence of NATO allies upon the foreign policy of the United States
demonstrates the importance of liberal norms, through a mechanism which
relies upon the similarity of domestic political institutions in these
liberal democracies and coalition-building (1995). Though valuable
additions to the literature, and in Deutsch's case systematic in its
treatment of the subject, these works fail to tackle the question of
whether the democratic peace is structural or norm based since the two
are entwined throughout. The difficulty in conceptualizing, isolating
and operationalizing norms is a clear problem. Broadly, it is hard to
isolate a norm from either the structure in which it exists or from
other norms for analysis. It is also a challenge to show that any norm
is truly intersubjective in understanding or to measure its effect upon
some outcome of interest. Yet, without attempts to do so we are left
with a partial picture, particularly for those emphasizing the
importance of structures---be these domestic or international---for
reducing interstate conflict. In short, the existence of a domestic
legislature, independent judiciary, or interstate treaties, is only
relevant if the individuals which employ them do so appropriately. To
understand this necessitates exploring the ideas in the heads of these
individuals, and particularly, how these ideas are shared.

In contrast to the large, predominantly quantitative, literature which
has examined the democratic peace and wider questions linking regime
type to the onset, conduct and termination of interstate disputes and
wars, the broader literature on interstate norms has tended to be
qualitative and highly focused. This has resulted in detailed work on
human rights (Risse, Ropp, and Sikkink 1999), humanitarian intervention
(Wheeler 2000), and nuclear weapons (Rublee and Cohen 2018; Tannenwald
1999). There is no doubt that this has contributed to our understanding
of interstate relations, yet the clear shortcoming is generalizability.
That is, the specificity of these approaches, necessary to make any form
of causal claim, is in a sense also the undoing.

In this article I focus on the reinterpretation of the sovereignty norm
by powerful states. I argue that they have a dominant role in shaping
the normative landscape of the international system by being tasked with
the interpretation of norms and the maintenance of international society
(Hurrell 2007; Wight 1978; Saunders 2006). Operationalizing this, I
utilize UN Security Council resolutions as a means of assessing what the
consensus position of the permanent members is. Content analysis is used
to examine the normative framing of resolutions, allowing both an
exploration of change over time, and quantitative measures of the
relative strength of these ideas to be derived which can then be used in
regression analysis.

The Constraining Effect of Liberal Interpretations of Sovereignty

Norms are dynamic, and undergo processes of evolution, creation and
destruction. Change may occur gradually as actors shift their
understandings towards an alternative, or suddenly through systemic, and
thereby social, change. In international relations, the latter is
tightly linked to sudden shifts in great power authority, which has
typically occurred due to defeat and a subsequent realignment of
international order. War, and its aftermath, can lead to substantial
rearrangements of international order, meaning both a new distribution
of power, but also a re-interpretation of international society. In
examining change in understandings of sovereignty I term gradual change
"evolution" and sudden change "tectonic."

Interpretations of Sovereignty

The post-World War Two era allows examination of both evolutionary and
tectonic change in understandings of sovereignty. Evolution occurs
during relative peace, whilst tectonic change is part of major
realignments of international order. The end of the Cold War, though
non-violent certainly led to significant power shifts, resulting in a
tectonic change. The pre- and post-Cold War eras are eras of evolution.
Assessing rivalrous interpretation of norms is crucial to understanding
these changes. I outline a divergence between traditional and liberal
interpretations which are used to examine change in norms, and the
effect upon international conflict.

Over the post-World War Two period two interpretations of sovereignty
have existed, firstly, that emphasizing territorial sovereignty and
non-interference in the domestic affairs of others, and secondly, that
emphasizing international law, interdependence, free trade, democracy
and individual rights and freedoms in international affairs. I term the
former approach to sovereignty "traditional," and the latter "liberal."
A liberal interpretation of sovereignty, therefore, is one which places
emphasis upon the actions of states, particularly those between a
government and its citizens. Sovereignty in this understanding implies
not only the exercise of power over a territory and people (as in the
traditional understanding), but also that there are limits to the
exercise of power and duties to a people (Sandholtz and Stiles 2008,
287-88).3 This has been most clearly stated in the Responsibility to
Protect doctrine. I examine the relative balance between these two
interpretations over time, arguing that this balance alters how
sovereignty is understood, and thereby is related to the likelihood of
escalation in interstate disputes.

My expectation is that the relative balance between these two modes of
interpretation has shifted over the post-World War Two period to favor a
liberal interpretation. This does not mean that traditional
interpretations are irrelevant, rather, that they have been
de-emphasized in international discourse relative to the latter. A
spectrum in which purely traditional and purely liberal interpretations
mark the poles is conceived of as existing, with great powers occupying
positions between the two. The effect that this shift toward a liberal
interpretation of sovereignty has occurred on international conflict
escalation is now examined.

Understandings of Sovereignty and Conflict Escalation

How understandings of sovereignty impact international disputes may be
explored in terms of the conflict life-cycle, that is, why a dispute
emerges, why violent conflict breaks out, and how the conflict ends, or
in terms of participant conduct during war. Here, I examine the effect
of change in the collective understanding of sovereignty upon
escalation, meaning that I assume the prior existence of international
disputes. Whilst the effect of norms upon the onset of disputes is an
important question, very few disputes result in the use of violence,
that is, though onset is a necessary condition for violence, it is far
from sufficient. I examine escalation from a nonviolent dispute to a
violent dispute---the use of armed force in international
relations---because this is of greater substantive significance to state
leaders and their citizens. Moreover, whilst reducing the likelihood of
dispute onset would likely result in less international violence, [the
more normatively important question is how to avoid
**escalation**]{.underline}, [as this **reduces the costs** of
war]{.underline}: human death and economic destruction.

This is not to trivialize dispute onset, and logically we might expect
the growth of liberal understandings of sovereignty to also reduce onset
rates as well as escalation likelihood. However, there are two reasons
why we may doubt the substantive significance of this, firstly, dispute
onset is a relatively low threshold, and secondly, onset is often
triggered by events beyond the direct control of a state. To this first
point, a dispute simply means that two or more actors disagree over
something, oftentimes the behavior of the other side or the distribution
of some good (for instance, territory). This article utilizes
Militarized Interstate Disputes as the operationalization of dispute,
and many disputes are comparatively minor events, with the threshold
being that one of the two parties has a minimum level of militarization
as part of the dispute (for example, the issuance of a deterrent, or
compellent, threat). A focus on onset, therefore, would prevent
observation of substantively more important actions, that is, the actual
use of force against another. Secondly, many disputes begin due to
accident and/or the decision making of low-level military commanders or
political officials who are neither in the position to consider national
interests nor strategic interactions. This means that onset may
essentially be an apolitical decision which takes little or no account
of the broader strategic landscape nor the structural and normative
context. It is after onset, that is, when escalation is considered by
policymakers, that the stakes are higher and when causal mechanisms
common to this topic are most active.

[Escalation]{.underline} then, [is a **political**
decision]{.underline}. In making the choice to escalate, or not,
[policymakers are]{.underline} impacted by a range of strategic factors,
but crucially, are also [constrained by **norms**]{.underline}. [The
[use of force]{.mark} in international relations [must be
**justified**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and since 1945 the UN Charter
specifies just two: self-defense and collective peace enforcement. To
this, we might also add humanitarian intervention, though this remains
contested. As a baseline, therefore, when faced with dispute onset,
policymakers must justify their actions with reference to one of these
reasons. Moreover, [[in making the **decision to
escalate**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[policymakers are]{.mark} also
**[constrained by liberal values]{.mark}** which emphasize
diplomacy]{.underline}, [cooperation]{.underline}, [international
law]{.underline}, [international organizations]{.underline}, [the rights
of the individual]{.underline}, [and to question the legitimacy of the
march to war]{.underline}. Taken [together]{.underline}, [[this **slows
the decision to escalate**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[since legal
justification is **needed**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[diplomacy is
**necessary**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and potential]{.mark} economic and
human costs **[understood]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [**calculated** and
**defended**]{.underline}. [A shift toward liberal interpretations
thereby means a **reduced probability of escalation** to
violence]{.underline}, tacitly assuming that the risk of a dispute
arising in the first-place is unchanged. This leads me to my first
hypothesis, which relates to the evolution mechanism of change:

Hypothesis 1: [Given an international dispute]{.underline}, [the risk of
escalation **decreases** as liberal interpretations
**increase**]{.underline}.

An alternative explanation is that any impact of normative change is
actually a result of the end of the Cold War, that is, the
redistribution of power between great powers, typically resulting from
system-wide conflict results in qualitative differences in
interpretations of fundamental norms between peace-periods. Whilst the
end of the Cold War did not involve a system-wide war, it did mark the
end of sustained rivalry between great powers. The pre- and post-
periods can thereby be compared. Given the rivalry of the United States
and Soviet Union during the Cold War, and the relative dominance of the
United States post-Cold War, we might expect qualitative differences in
conflict behavior to be observable in the two time periods,
attributable, perhaps, to a greater emphasis upon liberal
interpretations in the post-Cold War era. The dramatic change in the
distribution of power triggered a significant change in the consensus
surrounding interpretation of fundamental norms of international
society. This leads me to my second hypothesis, which captures the
tectonic change mechanism:

Hypothesis 2: [The risk of dispute escalation decreases given a systemic
increase in **liberal interpretations of sovereignty**]{.underline}
attributable to the end of the Cold War.

Method

I use multiple logistic regression to estimate the effect of change in
the normative landscape on the use of force by dispute participants. To
address the underlying selection problem, that is, that dispute onset is
non-random, I also estimate maximum likelihood and twostep Heckman
selection models. Substantive significance from the logistic regression
is then explored utilizing the observed values for predicted
probabilities approach (Hanmer and Ozan Kalkan 2013). Standard errors
are robust and clustered by year, where model specification allows (that
is, not in the Heckman twostep model). This is to take account of the
data structure since years differ by the number of Militarized
Interstate Disputes (MIDs) which onset and the number of participants in
these MIDs. Because the independent variables are annual values, the
same value is given to all dispute participants in the same year. If
standard errors were not clustered by year then there would be
substantial withincluster correlation.

[This]{.underline} paper [models]{.underline} the hostility level of
interstate [disputes as a **monadic** phenomenon]{.underline}. [Much of
the literature]{.underline} on democratic peace theory [utilizes a
**dyadic** setup]{.underline}, either directed or undirected. I opt for
a monadic structure for three reasons, firstly, because [many of the
theoretical explanations for the democratic peace are]{.underline} in
essence, **[monadic]{.underline}** explanations, with a dyadic version
layered on top. For instance, the core claim of much of the literature
is that democracy reduces the hostility of foreign policy, a monadic
claim, because leaders are accountable to citizens who have a low
tolerance for the costs or war, and because legislatures and a free and
independent media provides greater scrutiny of policymaking, slowing the
march to war. The dyadic version of this---the interaction of joint
democracy---relies on the signals that these same processes provide to
another actor. It is puzzling, therefore, that empirical findings have
tended to show support for the latter, but not for the former. Secondly,
[the **difficulty** in finding empirical support for any monadic
explanation means that [a **higher threshold** is]{.mark} being
[set]{.mark} here [by]{.mark} using [a monadic
approach]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thirdly, the argument I make, that
liberal norms reduces the hostility level of interstate disputes, may
have varying effects according to the regime type of dyads. However,
that claim is not made here, rather I argue that these norms exist for
all in international society, not for a subset, and that they act
directly upon policymakers, not only when policymakers interact with
their international counterparts.

SUSTAINABILITY IN MINING

Looking to the future of mining in the Arctic: can this industry provide
an opportunity for sustainable development and reconciliation?
Sustainable development has been defined as "development which meets the
needs of the present without compromising the ability of future
generations to meet their own needs" (Brundtland Commission, 1987).
Whilst sustainable mining may be an oxymoron, [[sustainability in
mining]{.mark} leading to the development of sustainable outcomes, [is a
legitimate concept]{.mark} that **[we should be working
towards.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Sustainability within the mining
industry can be multifaceted, encompassing projects which aim to not
only reduce the environmental and social impacts of mining through
stewardship of the natural environment but to also add value, creating
something sustainable in the long term. [Sustainable goals [must also
include]{.mark} the development of, and continued effort towards,
building [**long-term relationships** with communities]{.mark} who are
[impacted by]{.mark} the [mining]{.mark} process. Ensuring that mining
is sustainable is not just reliant upon **[ethical extraction]{.mark}**
but [also **protecting the long value chain**]{.mark} that occurs after
the mining has taken place. [This]{.mark} process [creates
**environmental**]{.mark}, [**social**, and **economic value**
which]{.mark} can **[positively benefit]{.mark} the [local
communities]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

For example, [despite being built on environmental disaster, **Faro**
mine in Canada is now home to [the **Faro Mine Remediation
Project**]{.mark}, a government [an]{.mark}d [**Indigenous-led**
program]{.mark}.]{.underline} This program provides employment and
training opportunities for Kaska and other Indigenous citizens (FARO
Mine Remediation Project, 2022) and is an example of a longterm project
[which [provides **opportunities for locals** whilst]{.mark} at the same
time **[rehabilitating the environment]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Incorporating sustainability principles into the lifecycle of a mining
operation and beyond, has the potential to have a positive impact on
communities and, if incorporated into the early planning stages, could
contribute to the long-term sustainability of the local area.

These questions are also particularly pertinent in Greenland, a country
with 92% Indigenous population, a great potential for mineral resources,
a large expanse of unexplored land and a limited history of resource
development (In 2020 there were 2 active mines in Greenland compared to
1001 in Canada). Despite the small number of mines in Greenland, some
areas (such as in South Greenland) have been mined for more than a
century and a significant proportion of the population of Greenland have
some experience of exploration and mining operations and are positive
towards mining (e.g., Agneman, 2018; Thaarup et al., 2020). As Greenland
continues to be explored, coastal regions are becoming more and more
prospective, and the number of exploration licences is slowly
increasing.

The government and people of Greenland are currently battling with
questions of environmental, economic, and political opportunities. For
example, [the controversial **[Kvanefjeld rare earth deposit]{.mark}**
is one of the most significant rare earth deposits globally]{.underline}
and presents an opportunity for Greenland to become an internationally
significant supplier of raw materials and perhaps establish economic
independence from Denmark. Many [[local residents **support the
project** as it offers]{.mark} **greater [employment]{.mark}** whereas
other have raised concerns about disruptions to the environment and the
lack of adequate information]{.underline}, particularly surrounding the
potential radioactive pollution, and failure to consult and seek local
community's free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) (Orellana et al.,
2021). It should be noted, however, that the main concerns around the
Kvanefjeld deposit are related to the presence of uranium in the ore.
This is not reflective of the "typical" concerns to other exploration
and mining operations elsewhere in Greenland, many of which are seen
largely positively. A recent report on sand mining in Greenland surveyed
almost 1,000 Greenlanders (\>1.5% of the population) and found that
large majorities support extraction but oppose foreign involvement
(Bendixen et al., 2022).

Examples of [Indigenous **Collaboration and Ownership**]{.underline}

A direct result of [[oil and gas extraction throughout the
Arctic]{.mark} has [seen]{.mark} the **[increase in
co-]{.mark}management** structures [between Indigenous
communities]{.mark} and developers]{.underline}. The legacy of oil and
gas extraction in Canada has led to a historical relationship of
distrust between Indigenous communities and extractive industries. The
oil and gas industry in Canada had a significant impact on Indigenous
communities through the ever-increasing wave of Europeans arriving to be
a part of the extractive industries' growth (Alberta's Energy Heritage).
The 1850s in Canada saw a dramatic increase in the production of oil,
with the Mining and manufacturing Company of 1854 being the first
dedicated oil company in North America (Alberta's Energy Heritage).
Furthermore, projects developing access and acquisition of gas, such as
Coastal GasLink in British Columbia, have been accused of violating FPIC
principles, thus continuing the challenges navigating these forms of
extractivism and the Indigenous right to self-determination (StandEarth,
2022).

Whilst mining and Indigenous relations are typically portrayed in a
negative light, there are examples, particularly in the Canadian Arctic,
which can inform future exploration and mining. [[**Red Dog mine** in
Alaska]{.mark}]{.underline} is a major world producer of Zn and Pb and
[[is co-owned by]{.mark} Teck Alaska and [the **NAANA Indigenous
corporation**]{.mark}, providing an example [where **typical
approaches**]{.mark} to western business deals [were challenged,
resulting in a]{.mark} potential **[new approach to business]{.mark}**
in the Arctic.]{.underline} Raglan mine in northern Quebec is another
example of a major world producer of Ni and the location of Canada's
first Impact Benefit Agreement with Indigenous communities, promoting
political, social, and economic development of the region. [[Indigenous
knowledge]{.mark}, in **collaboration** with two neighbouring Inuit
communities, [was incorporated into]{.mark} the **[e]{.mark}nvironmental
[i]{.mark}mpact [a]{.mark}ssessments** prior to the Raglan mine
operation, resulting in a shortened shipping season [to]{.mark} **aid
[conserv]{.mark}ation** relating to Arctic char and [seal
populations]{.mark}]{.underline} (Natural Resources Canada, 2007).

[**[Indigenous collaboration]{.mark}** and ownership [is increasingly
common in **Arctic development**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example,
[First Nations, [**Métis**, and **Inuit entities** were **partners or
beneficiaries** in]{.mark} nearly [20% of Canada's]{.mark} existing
electricity-generating [infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2022
(Gall et al., 2022), most of which produces renewable energy, reducing
reliance on diesel generators in these remote regions. [[The
**Nechalacho rare earth project**]{.mark}, located on the traditional
lands of several Metis and Dene First Nations groups in the Northwest
Territories, [involves a **51% joint venture**]{.mark} ownership [by the
**Yellowknives Dene First Nations**, who]{.mark} will [control
mining]{.mark} operations at the site.]{.underline} This project
provides significant potential for Indigenous and northern employment
and economic benefit and is the first example of a First Nations
business entity contracting for a mine operation on traditional lands in
Canada.

Prior to the formation of international instruments, such as UNDRIP,
FPIC and ILO No. 169, the decisions and legislation made in the Arctic
mining sector were widely done so by corporations with very little to no
Indigenous involvement in the decision-making processes. In 2018 the BC
Regional Mining Alliance (BCRMA) was developed, an industry-led
strategic partnership between Indigenous groups, industry and provincial
government, that focuses on bringing investment through collaborative
partnerships. The Golden Triangle region in British Columbia has been a
hotspot for mineral and geological exploration for the last 150 years
and investments and developments made by BCRMA has ensured that this
region is becoming increasingly accessible (BCRMA, 2023).

Additionally, [in 2021, **[Suncor Energy]{.mark}**]{.underline}
announced an unprecedented step forwards in terms of Indigenous and
industry collaborations. They [[announced a]{.mark} new [partnership
with **eight Indigenous communities**]{.mark} in Wood Buffalo, this
partnership allows the eight Indigenous communities to acquire all of TC
Energy's 15% equity interest in the Northern Courier Pipeline Limited
Partnership]{.underline} (Foulis, 2021). This partnership is a
reification of reconciliation attempts and exemplifies the wanted change
from communities, within extractive sectors.

Examples of [Indigenous/Community Led Initiatives]{.underline}

Since the introduction of international instruments such as UNDRIP, FPIC
and the ILO Convention No. 169, [there has been an increase in
**[Indigenous-led initiatives]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Many of these have
been [[focus]{.mark}ed specifically [on]{.mark} the **[green
transition]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Securing Indigenous Peoples' Rights
in the Green Economy [([SIRGE]{.mark} coalition)]{.underline} is one
example of an Indigenous-led initiative. [This coalition is led by an
Indigenous Steering Committee which [is made up of **two representatives
of Indigenous Peoples**]{.mark} from each of the seven socio-cultural
regions across the globe.]{.underline} SIRGE implements transformative
solutions to secure the rights of Indigenous Peoples in the global
transition to a green economy. [This organisation has [recently released
a guide for]{.mark} Indigenous leaders to **develop [FPIC
protocols]{.mark}** and [to]{.mark} implement these to **[ensure
self-determination]{.mark}** is reified for all Indigenous community
members.]{.underline}

Another example of Indigenous communities heading initiatives within the
extractive sector is [in Alberta where the **[Frog Lake]{.mark} [First
Nations]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the **[Kehewin Cree Nation]{.mark}** are
[propos]{.mark}ing an **[Indigenous-led carbon capture]{.mark}** and
storage]{.underline} (CCS) hub located on their traditional territory.
Whilst these communities are partnered with Kanata Clean Power and
Climate Technologies Corp. and Vault 44.01 Ltd., [it is expected that
the Indigenous majority ownership share will be opened to other Treaty
Six First Nations as the development progresses]{.underline} (Jaremko,
2023).

CONSIDERATIONS FOR FUTURE EXPLORATION AND MINING IN THE ARCTIC

Industries, such as the extractive industries, have a long history in
the Arctic which is intertwined with the development of social movements
and legislation in the region. In parallel to these movements, [we are
also **in the midst** of [the **green transition**]{.mark} which, **[if
not managed correctly]{.mark}**, [could have unintended consequences for
local communities and the environment.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The motivation for this article came from the inspiring conversations
between a diverse group of young and openminded emerging leaders from
across or working in the Arctic who share a common vision of creating a
sustainable north, where voices and decisions of the North are from the
North and planetary and human welfare are at the forefront of our
actions. These conversations highlighted that [the topic of [mining is
**not**]{.mark} **as [taboo]{.mark}** as originally assumed,
[but]{.mark} instead, [is a **part of our history** and]{.mark} a part
of our [future]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, [**[it is up to us to
reimagine the future of mining]{.mark}** and how]{.underline}, and if,
[this might form a part of the future of the Arctic.]{.underline}

This article does not attempt to find a single solution when it comes to
the future of mining in the Arctic. In fact, many of our examples draw
upon solutions from a wide range of groups such as Indigenous
communities, government organisations, legislation, as well as the
mining industry itself. In acknowledgement of the inherent
interconnectedness of mining and the UN's sustainable development goals,
we aim to [[**encourage conversations** about mining in the Arctic, such
that]{.mark} a variety of [voices can be heard]{.mark}.]{.underline} We
have focussed on providing a range of examples of [[mining]{.mark} and
exploration [in the Arctic]{.mark} that have the potential to
[bring]{.mark} about [**positive benefits** to local communities]{.mark}
and the environment. These examples [include]{.mark} the **[involvement
of]{.mark} multiple [different voices]{.mark}**, particularly [in the
early stages of a project]{.mark}, and led to design and implementation
[that **braided indigenous knowledge**]{.mark} or
ownership.]{.underline} What all of these examples have in common is
initially a conversation, something that underpins FPIC and provides
culturally and community specific solutions.

We hope that [[showcasing]{.mark} more [**positive examples of mining**
in the Arctic]{.mark} will [bring about]{.mark} more **[constructive
conversations]{.mark}** that help [to reimagine
mining]{.mark}.]{.underline} We hope that by sharing these stories we
can promote learning and collaborations which will positively impact the
future of the Arctic.

### AT: Nation-States=Bad

#### Nationalism [causally]{.underline} pacifies the world and [prevents]{.underline} imperial interventions.

**Metselaar, 18**---Master's candidate in International Cooperation,
Graduate School of International Studies, Seoul National University
(Sebastiaan Laurens, "A study on how modern nationalism can prevent
imperialism from re-emerging,"
<http://s-space.snu.ac.kr/bitstream/10371/141693/1/000000151525.pdf>,
dml)

The nation currently has its limitations. To break down this limitation
aspect, we can take [any nation]{.underline} for our example as all of
them, even the ones encompassing millions or even over a billion people
[has to deal with **finite** or]{.underline} to some extend [**elastic**
boundaries]{.underline}. Beyond these boundaries lie other nations.
[These boundaries represent]{.underline} the well-developed
understanding in international relations on a nation's legal property
rights. These [inviolable rights]{.underline} were [**absent** prior to
the establishment of the **nation** and]{.underline} were
**[only]{.underline}** to be [**acknowledged worldwide** by the
international community starting from the decolonization period, marking
**modern nationalism**. Now that basically all land is claimed by a
nation and that globalization has led to a world market where goods,
services, and]{.underline} (human) [resources can be exchanged with
ease, it has **drastically reduced** the attractiveness of **pull**
factors]{.underline}. Plus, [no nation imagines itself as **one**
with]{.underline} mankind, not a single nationalist dreams of a day
where [all human beings]{.underline} will join their nation as for say
Christians dream of a wholly Christian planet.

Before the French Revolution started, [both **push** and **pull**
factors were present that would attract a tribe, kingdom, or empire to
conquer territory without being held accountable for their
actions]{.underline}. The development of the nation and the
industrialization, created a larger gap between the developed areas and
undeveloped areas (i.e. Europe and basically the rest of the world).
[Imperialism was a **logical consequence** as a distinction between
nations, those who **have** nationalism, and non-nations, areas that
**do not** have nationalism]{.underline}, became clear. [No nationalism
meant that no nation had claimed **property rights** over a certain
territory]{.underline}. Thus, [prior to the decolonization period and
the development of the international system, there were **no resisting
forces** that strong ever in the history of humankind that could
**oppose imperialism**]{.underline}. Important for the understanding of
these distinctions, it has to be emphasized that the world is divided
per area and that each area was in a different stage of development.
When in Europe the nations started to form, in other parts of the world
the areas would be controlled by tribes, kingdoms, or empires. In the
past, the West became more advanced than we could have seen for example
in Asia in the 18th century. Even in present day the West takes the lead
in technological, military, and economic development, despite Asia is
catching up in some cases or even went beyond the level of certain
Western developments. Africa however is still lacking behind and there
will most probably be never a point in time where all areas in the world
reach the same level of development.

If indeed the process of nation building follows similar paths as it did
in Europe, then Africa could be in the phase of enlightenment as efforts
are being made to modernize and to search for a solid national identity.
As mentioned earlier, most developing countries are weak states. The
Hutu's and Tutsi's were enforced to live within borders they have not
chosen themselves but were enforced with by the end of the colonial
period. On a world map, the boundaries of the nations are clear, but it
does not show the nationalness of the citizens within those boundaries.
It is a painful inheritance of the colonial era. By for example
establishing a common language and modernizing education like the
Europeans did during the transition from dynasticism to nationalism and
imperialism, it will help to strengthen the imagined community that is
the nation, further decreasing the pull factors.

[Obvious **mistakes** have been made]{.underline} throughout the
decolonization period [that are still having **disastrous consequences**
today]{.underline}. Also [nations]{.underline} like Iraq, Syria, and
Lebanon [had]{.underline} their [borders drawn in the sand]{.underline}
by England and France [without]{.underline} them [taking into
account]{.underline} how **[local history]{.underline}**, religion,
geography, and economy had influenced the citizens. The people would not
identify themselves with one another, they were descendants from the
Abbasid Caliphate or the Babylonian or Ottoman Empire, all who had
different cultures. Nonetheless, these nations were (forcefully or
without much effort) created, and the problems for creating them created
the many civil wars we see in the Middle East today. [Nevertheless,
these newly established nations had claimed **full sovereignty** and
**independence** over their distinct territory, that any attempt of
conquering would be **illegal** and **costly**]{.underline} as witnessed
with IS and the Kurds, [even here a **re-emergence** of imperialism will
be **prevented**.]{.underline}

[The imagined community feature was **most important** for the
understanding of the roots of nationalism as it contains the element of
belonging to something **bigger** than the individual]{.underline}.
Explaining that it is imagined because the members of even the smallest
nation will never know most of their fellow-members, meet them, or even
hear of them, yet in the minds of each lives the image of their
community (Anderson 2006). It is [the **limitation** and **sovereignty**
aspect of nationalism]{.underline} that [marked these new
nations']{.underline} their property [rights]{.underline}
([**disappearing** of pull factors]{.underline}).

[Though we do live in the **most peaceful era** of our time, we tend to
forget **how much more violent** the world has used to be]{.underline}.
These days, [more people die of **car crashes** than being killed by
**wars** or **terrorism**]{.underline}. We commemorate the wars and
celebrate our independence, to continue the realization of what happened
and to what extend we are capable of committing inhumane crimes.
[Whether internal state conflicts have been decreased]{.underline} since
the end of World War II [is **debatable**, but that clashes between
states have decreased is **undeniable**]{.underline}. The succession of
the League of Nations by [the United Nations]{.underline}, [provides one
of the **most powerful resistance** to pull factors in keeping nations
in check with regards to imperial ambitions. Obviously there were
**tensions**]{.underline} during for example the Cold War [and conflicts
**did break out** between states, but in light of the **historic time
frame**, it has **never been this peaceful** as it is today. No Roman or
Ottoman empire can start a **conquest**]{.underline}, in fact, ever
[since the end of the last great war no country recognized by the United
Nations has been **conquered** or **wiped off the map**]{.underline}.
[Even the superpowers today who have all the means for starting their
imperial conquest have to take into account that such conquest are **too
costly to undertake**]{.underline} (e.g. Russia and Crimea, China and
Tibet). [And despite that conflicts are still present; the United
Nations does not only have the tools to **interfere** military
wise]{.underline} (i.e. peacekeeping operations), [but also the
capabilities to **sanction** perpetrators. The United Nations might be
**far from perfect**]{.underline} as power struggles within the system
exist, causing nations among each other to differentiate in meaning and
action. [However, as long as it is in place, nations will **rethink**
once more their behavior]{.underline}.

Thus, [no country has attempted to **conquer another nation** ever since
the end of the decolonization period. The rise of the nation has a
**causal relationship** to the **decline in interstate
violence**]{.underline}. Moreover, the [nationalists]{.underline} in a
country [**do not want** to start an imperial conquest and make
colonies]{.underline}, instead, [they want the colonials **out** of
their country. The nationstate as we know it today is **deeper rooted**
in the emotions of the masses than any other previous political
organization has achieved before]{.underline}. In order for nationalism
to develop and for sovereignty to be claimed by the populace, a complete
revision of the status quo was required.

As for Korea, the foundation of nationalism developed during the
annexation by Japan and it was not strong enough to prevent the
separation between the North and South. These days, South-Korea has
probably one of the strongest forms of nationalism. The love for the
flag and the (popular) culture, the remembrance of its past, all
contribute to strong sense of horizontal connection. The best and most
recent display of Korea's nationalism were the regular massive protests,
by the millions, opposed to the Korean president. The fear of the Korean
people in the survey stated in the introduction are therefore overrated.

[Not only have the costs of imperial warfare **gone up**, its profits
also **declined**. Looking into the **history** of empires, the **mere
reason** for expanding was to search for **resources** that could still
the economic hunger for growth]{.underline}. Thus, [most conquests were
focusing on securing **material wealth**]{.underline} such as gold,
silver, spices, cattle, but also slaves. [These days, we all have access
to a **global market**]{.underline} [and as]{.underline} our traditional
[resources are getting **exhausted**, there is a shift]{.underline} in
focus [to]{.underline} for example **[renewable]{.underline}** energy
[sources]{.underline}. So, [not only]{.underline} war [did war became
**less profitable**, peace became **more lucrative** than
ever]{.underline}.

### AT: No Cooption/Essentialism/They Aren't Responsible

#### No

**Zembylas, 25**---Professor of Educational Theory and Curriculum
Studies at the Open University of Cyprus (Michalinos, "Decolonial
pathways in education: Walter Mignolo, epistemic delinking, and the
risks of ethno-essentialism," Globalisation, Societies and Education,
February 3, 2025, DOI: 10.1080/14767724.2025.2459110, dml)

My [argument]{.underline} here [is not]{.underline} to claim [that
decolonial theory]{.underline} or Mignolo's framework [are]{.underline}
'**[responsible]{.underline}**' [for]{.underline} their
[appropriation]{.underline} by authoritarian or right-wing agendas. Such
a view would not only be politically and intellectually naïve, but also
oversimplify the complex dynamics at play. Decolonial theory, especially
Mignolo's concept of 'delinking', which has been at the centre of this
paper, was conceived to question Western dominance and empower
marginalised voices. However, [when theories enter diverse political
landscapes]{.underline}, [they can be **reinterpreted** in ways that
**deviate** from their original intent]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}
reinterpretation [is **not accidental**]{.underline}; [it builds on
**specific pitfalls**]{.underline} within decolonial theory,
particularly its emphasis on epistemic decolonisation, [which
can]{.underline} at times [lead to **ethno-essentialist**
claims]{.underline}. In the case of Russia and India, [nationalist
leaders have **strategically rebranded** delinking as an anti-Western
stance that **suppresses critique** and promotes a singular national
identity]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} does not indicate a flaw in
decolonial theory itself but instead [highlights the potential for
powerful ideas to be **co-opted** when not **critically examined** in
context]{.underline}. Scholars must therefore be mindful of the new
geopolitics of education (Moscovitz and Sabzalieva Citation2023),
particularly how decolonial theories might be adapted and strive to
clarify their theoretical, ethical and political boundaries to resist
misuse.

### AT: Ontology

#### Sweeping theories of radical indigenous ontological difference ignore the [nuances]{.underline} of [actual struggles]{.underline} that [strategically repurpose settler categories]{.underline} 

**Rosenow, 19**---Senior Lecturer in International Relations at Oxford
Brookes University (Doerthe, "Decolonising the Decolonisers? Of
Ontological Encounters in the GMO Controversy and Beyond," Global
Society, 33:1, 82-99, dml)

Despite the force and importance of this argument, I have felt slightly
uneasy when reading those conclusions. [[Focusing on **radical
ontological difference**]{.mark} can **easily [lead]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} a **romanticised [reification]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} other
peoples' [difference]{.mark} that is **[in danger of ignoring
actual]{.mark} political [struggles]{.mark}** [and **demands on the
ground**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Cusicanqui argues, [[those]{.mark}
struggles **[might]{.mark} very well [emerge]{.mark}** [out of an
"**indigenous modernity**", **rather than**]{.mark} **an
[insistence]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} the **right to one's
[difference]{.mark}**]{.underline}. By this she means that [[some
Indigenous people]{.mark} aim to **[formulate a hegemonic
vision]{.mark}** for how to structure a society that is **[valid for
everyone]{.mark}** (Indigenous **AND** non-Indigenous)]{.underline}:
they work for a society that is in their "image and likeness",
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[**use modern notions** such as
"**citizenship**"]{.mark} for this purpose, [rather than
**rejecting**]{.mark} **the latter [as irreconcilable]{.mark} with one's
own world**]{.underline}.39 By contrast, [some]{.underline} North
American Indigenous [intellectuals call for an Indigenous
"**resurgence**" that, **rather than seeking hegemony**, altogether
**turns away from seeking recognition** by wider (colonial)
"society"]{.underline}. As Leanne Betasamosake Simpson points out, [in
such "resurgent mobilization ... there is **virtually no room for white
people**".]{.underline} 40

But my unease was also emerging from something else, which is what I
want to focus on in this article: the problem that encounters and
conflicts are yet again made sense of within overarching structures of
knowledge production rather than cultivation (despite the intention to
do otherwise). As de la Cadena herself makes clear in the quotation
above, what is encountered as "different" is inevitably described "in
forms that I could understand" (my emphasis)---even whilst
simultaneously recognising that one's description does not capture what
the encountered practices actually do. Sense-making, for de la Cadena,
takes place at what could be called two levels: At a first level, there
is the inevitable process of making sense of an alienating affective
experience on the spot, from within one's own framework of understanding
the world. At a second level, then, de la Cadena attempts to make
legible her grappling and not-understanding in the context of a book for
an academically literate and interested audience---in other words, in
the writing-up of her ethnographic research.

In Rojas' and Blaney and Tickner's case, given that their articles do
not aim to make an empirical contribution, sense-making takes place at
what could be called a third level: what is drawn upon is the
understanding that emerged out of the ethnographic work of others, which
is brought into conversation with various bodies of theoretical work in
order to make a conceptual contribution. This takes place via the
coining of central concepts and the outlining of all-encompassing
frameworks that are meant to help us understand the analytical,
normative and political consequences of their argument for scholarly
work more broadly. The ontological encounters of others are used to
delineate the merits of ontological encounters in general, in IR and
beyond. This objective leads to a particular way of developing and
structuring a generic argument that makes it difficult to move beyond
sense-making frameworks that are necessarily geared towards settling all
those unsettling and disconcerting experiences that were the focus of
the articles in the first place.

[This is]{.underline} also [the problem of some **central decolonial
work**]{.underline}. Drawing on Edouard Glissant, Mignolo, for example,
critiques the "requirement of transparency" that forms the basis for
understanding in Western social science scholarship. He argues for [the
"**right to opacity**" of those located on the **other side of the
colonial difference**]{.underline}.41 But this claim sits at odds with
his simultaneous desire to write a new, all-encompassing history of "the
modern/colonial world system". 42 And like in Rojas' and Blaney and
Tickner's articles, terms such as "pluriversality"43 or "diversality"44
[are coined in order to have a (**one!**) concept for a **similarly
all-encompassing solution** to domination]{.underline}. While de la
Cadena is critical of her own "anxiety to understand coherently (with
which I meant clearly and without contradiction"), and while she points
out how [this]{.underline} "was often out of place", 45 Mignolo as well
as Rojas and Blaney and Tickner [seek to place]{.underline} such
[anxiety in **yet another coherent framework** that **holds everything
together**]{.underline}.

The question arises whether this can be any different in scholarly work
that is not directly based on ethnographic research itself, and which
can therefore not lay claim to a direct experience of ontological
controversies. This has become an important question for my own
(likewise third-level) work on anti-GMO activism. My work to date has
primarily aimed at making a conceptual contribution, and has relied on a
conversation between the ethnographic research of others and various
bodies of conceptual work, including decolonial and "ontological turn"
literature.46

But as I have already indicated in relation to de la Cadena's work, when
writing up their research for academic purposes, even those who have
directly experienced ontological encounters find it hard to resist the
tendency to conclude their work with stringent, overarching, coherent
conclusions that the Westerneducated reader can grasp and "take home".
In the next section, I will draw on two anthropological ethnographic
texts that are significant for research on the GMO controversy to show
how this works. The two texts that will be analysed in the next section
engage with the GMO controversy in Paraguay and Mexico respectively, and
they have stood out for me in the way they manage to convey a sense of
unease and grappling with ontological encounters and conflicts. However,
as the next section will show, they as well end up providing a framework
and conclusions that can accommodate and make sense of the encountered
ontological difference.

3\. Ontological Encounters in the GMO Controversy

According to Susana Carro-Ripalda and Marta Astier, much of the research
that is carried out in relation to the question of what smallholder
producers in the Global South truly think of (and say about)
agricultural biotechnology is unable to grasp the "ontological
incompatibility" that exists between the experienced human/nonhuman
relations in small-scale agriculture on the one hand, and the logic that
underlies genetic engineering (GE) on the other.47 This is precisely
because most social research is itself grounded in the crucial
modern/colonial nature-culture divide: the former can only be known
through scientific means, while the latter can be known through the
study of social/cultural/political practices. Knowledge about nature is
about establishing "facts", which are either true or false (i.e. nature
as "one" is either correctly or incorrectly represented), while
knowledge about culture is about studying meaning, which is necessarily
(due to the existence of different cultures) multiple.

The question of whether GMOs do or do not pose a "factual" danger
consequently lies outside of the remit of the social sciences, which
therefore focus on the social dimension of statements that are made
about nature. But as Kregg Hetherington's reflections on his own
anthropological research journey in Paraguay make clear, this tacit
signing-up to modern ontology can lead to difficulties in understanding
the reality of the people one is interested in.48 Coming from a position
in which he took for granted the scientific distinction between (proven)
"fact" and "error", Hetherington explains how he "translate\[d\]" the
claims of the leader of a local peasant movement49 (Antonio) about the
truth of (GM) soy "killer beans" into something else:

Until this point, I had approached ethnography as an extended discussion
with and about humans, and I was less interested in beans than I was
with what Antonio said about them ... To be blunt, Antonio kept pointing
at the beans, and I kept looking at him ... I was comfortable saying
that this was a figure of speech, a kind of political rhetoric, or even
to claim that this is what Antonio believed, all of which explicitly
framed 'la soja mata' (soy kills) as data for social analysis, rather
than analysis itself worthy of response.50

However, Hetherington points out that not believing in the truth of the
killer bean did not prevent him from "participating in Antonio's
knowledge practices". 51 Becoming involved in the anti-soy bean activism
of the peasants, Hetherington became "part of the situation" that made
the killer bean turn into a crucial agent in a court case that was
brought against two soy farmers for the murder of two activist peasants.
As a result, killer beans became transformed into a matter of national
concern. Crucially for Hetherington, participation involved more than
joining the situation in spite of his lack of belief: it led to him
becoming immersed in a relation with both peasants and beans that
started to have a physical impact on him---in de la Cadena's words, he
indeed became "partially connected": 52

Beans didn't scare me at first. Indeed, as a foreigner to the situation
that gives rise to killer beans (a Canadian no less), giant fields of
soy were a familiar, even a comforting sight. But it took only a few
months with Antonio for me to start feeling the menace from those
fields. Soon, the sweetish smell of glyphosate, recently applied, and
especially the corpselike smell of 2, 4-D mixed with Tordon, could ruin
my appetite and make me expect to see people emerge from their homes to
show me pustules on their legs and stomachs.53

Similar observations are also found in Carro-Ripalda and Astier's
contribution to the 2014 Agriculture and Human Values symposium on the
challenges of making smallholder producer voices being heard in relation
to agricultural biotechnology.54 While most of the contributions to the
symposium concentrate on how to tease out smallholders' "real" voices in
the most effective way, Carro-Ripalda and Astier critically reflect on
their own perceived failure to become knowledgeable about smallholders'
voices in their research on GM maize cultivation in Mexico.

It was through ethnographic fieldwork in rural areas in Central Mexico,
in-depth structured interviews, focus groups, participant observation
and, finally, a National Workshop in Mexico City with over 50
stakeholders (including smallholder producers) that Carro-Ripalda and
Astier attempted to get a better sense of what the actual voices of
peasants in the GM controversy were trying to convey.55 However,
particularly the final workshop, which aimed to create conditions under
which Mexican smallholder producers could speak on their own terms about
GM maize cultivation, "unwittingly reproduced the conditions of
exclusive, techno-scientific and regulatory spaces". 56 The public
discourse that centres on questions of safety, science, possibilities of
regulation and problems of potential contamination, and which is upheld
by both GM maize proponents and antiGMO activists, dominated the
workshop debate. Even when present smallholders raised different
concerns, the discussion always returned to the previous, main ones, as
if those who had spoken differently "had not spoken at all". The way
that smallholders could articulate "their perceptions, ideas, and
desires" was thereby "severely limited". 57

Carro-Ripalda and Astier are focused on the dominance of one particular
(techno-scientific, regulatory) discourse that, they maintain, disabled
smallholder voices engaged in different discourses from speaking up or,
when speaking, from being heard. In other words, smallholders were
unable to adequately represent their own understanding of what is at
stake in the GM maize controversy in Mexico. Considering what I have
pointed out in the previous section, based on Rojas, difference is
thereby transformed into an epistemological, rather than an ontological
one: Carro-Ripalda and Astier's argument is implicitly based on the
assumption that, under the right conditions, difference can be
translated into something that can be communicated to, and discussed
with, other stakeholders. But the term "ontological incompatibility"
that the authors themselves use indicates there is something else at
play, which cannot easily be translated: the nature of the relation of
smallholder producers to their "land, seed, crop, climate ... as told
and understood by themselves"; the "central place" that Maize continues
to occupy in Mesoamerican pre-Hispanic cosmology, and "the social and
cultural significance" that goes along with that.58

Carro-Ripalda and Astier's emphasis on the problem of the dominant
discourse, and the overarching Mexican structures of domination this
discourse is related to (such as the "neoliberal vision of the Mexican
agricultural future"59), makes it occasionally difficult to understand
what the problem of "ontological incompatibility" really is about. At
the end of the article, the place of the smallholder producers whom they
have engaged seems once again clearly delineated and knowable: at stake
for smallholders are, Carro-Ripalda and Astier argue, "their lives as
maize cultivators, their pride in their craft and knowledge, and their
ceremonially demanded right to information, choice and access to their
'own resources'". It is not just about "retaining 'traditional' ways of
agriculture", as the anti-GMO movement maintains, but also about
claiming "political, economic and socio-cultural rights."60 Though this
certainly adds a significant dimension to the debate, it indeed simply
seems to add to, rather than radically challenge, the frameworks that
are conventionally used in the anti-GMO debate, as well as the
frameworks that focus on how to bring out and represent other people's
"voices" in a better way. Is this simply unavoidable when it comes to
the production of academic knowledge through/in academic writing? As
already indicated in the previous section, academic writing pursues by
definition the objective of enhancing knowledge and providing improved
insight into a certain situation. In its very structure, an academic
piece of work aims to resolve and settle, rather than to dislocate, to
destabilise, or to provide discomfort.

Carro-Ripalda and Astier's article is meant to render legible their own
encounter of ontological difference for an academic audience. Is it
possible for the reader to dig below these representational strategies,
and to relate more directly to their encounter of what they themselves
call ontological incompatibility? And which has led them to brand their
final workshop, in a quite un-academic way, as a "failure"? There are a
few places in the article in which their inability to put into words and
arguments all of "the complexity of experiences, relations and reasons
that bind people to maize"61 is more obvious. Becoming attuned to this
complexity is linked to the authors having to become at least "partially
connected"---to yet again use de la Cadena's phrase---to the relations
they attempt to trace. It is interesting, for example, that
Carro-Ripalda and Astier talk about "voices" as going beyond the
semantic level, as conveying something acoustically, and as requiring a
form of listening that shies away from asking pre-given questions. It is
also interesting that some of that took place when they literally walked
together with their interlocutors; precisely as it is emphasised by
Blaney and Tickner:62

Despite the shortcomings of the workshop ... we felt that that, through
our research on the ground, we had engaged with male and female farmers,
heard about their perspectives on GM and their visions of a rural
future, and accompanied them to work in milpas and markets. So, what do
smallholder farmers' voices sound like? What meanings did they convey to
us? We will provide here but a few of those sounds and meanings ... 63

Despite returning to the idea of voices as conveying "meaning" in this
quote, meaning is related to sounds, to walking together, to particular
places with their own sounds, smells, and colours. The sample of actual
"voices" Carro-Ripalda and Astier then choose to present yet again
invoke an intricate sense of the relationality of farmers and nonhumans:

It is a joy to plant, getting hold of the maize, of a beautiful cob
which is pleasant, to go to the harvest, to look at pretty cobs, all
regular. Because this is what sustains me.

You can see the difference in the seeds straight away ... You need to
look at the cob and as soon as I grab it I see the difference.

It is the person who knows the seed the one who chooses it \[for
replanting the following year\].64

By contrast, GM maize is associated by the smallholders whom
Carro-Ripalda and Astier cite with feelings of "artificiality,
estrangement and distrust towards the created object (the GMO) in
itself, not only because of deep ontological considerations ... but
because of the political and economic motives which are 'assembled' into
it."65 Although the authors make a distinction between ontology and
politics/ economics here, their invoking of the "assemblage" precisely
shows how the latter becomes part of ontology itself, and then (as in
the case of Hetherington) impacts on the sensual, bodily connection with
the maize. Understanding the relation between "things" in this way
allows for an analysis of power and domination that has at least the
potential of moving beyond pre-given frameworks; strategically
suspending them in order to "sharpen \[the\] analysis of exactly how
power operates, how relations are made and undermined, and with what
consequences". 66 Genetically modified maize is a problem because it is
part of particular Mexican neoliberal visions and strategies, but in the
context outlined by Carro-Ripalda and Astier, that vision is not only
(and not even primarily) made sense of through given frames of
knowledge, such as Marxist theories of the exploitation of labour, but
sensually, through the way it disrupts the (physical) pleasure and joy
that has sustained the farmer-maize-assemblage so far.67 GM technology
externalises the maize from farmers and estrange them from their ways of
life; and it is only through this externalisation that GM maize becomes
perceivable as a potential source of "contamination", as a danger
against which farmers need to "defend" their seeds.68

Now, some might counter that the previous paragraph in practice only
provides a fancy repackaging of the two well-rehearsed arguments brought
forward by many anti-GMO activists: (a) that the problem of GMOs is an
intrinsic property that makes it "unsafe" (which activists try to
scientifically prove), and/or (b) that the fundamental problem of
agricultural biotechnology is that it estranges farmers from their
traditional, ancestral way of life, that it allows for their
exploitation, and that it provides a further foothold for neoliberal
visions of how the world should be ordered. Both arguments are grounded
in modern ontology: the first goes down the route of science (contesting
"facts" about the "nature" of GMOs on the basis of science itself),
while the second goes down the "social" route by either making a case
for the need to respect cultural multiplicity, or for the need to
prevent economic exploitation. Some activists make use of all of these
routes and arguments. Famous environmental activist and intellectual
Vandana Shiva, for example, determines the alienating character of the
GMO to be an intrinsic property, while at the same time depicting
smallholder producers as intrinsic "'reservoirs' of local or indigenous
knowledge or as 'natural' conservators of biodiversity through their
traditional practices". 69 According to Carro-Ripalda and Astier, this
"unwittingly reinforce\[es\] images of smallholder producers as passive,
timeless and voiceless."70 This leads to precisely the sort of
romanticised reification of "difference" that I have critiqued in the
previous section of this article---paradoxically, in this case, on the
basis of an ontology that is deeply modern, as it regards both "things"
and "people" as ontologically stable and classifiable.

By contrast, the authors of the two texts I have analysed in this
section trace ontological encounters that cannot be contained by the
nature/culture dichotomy. There is no pre-given (social) theory of
neoliberalism and global power relations that dictates how the "voice"
of the farmer needs to be made sense of. There is also no pregiven
understanding of the "factual" (scientific) nature of GMOs. The notion
of radical difference that comes up in these two texts emerged from
precisely the "misunderstandings" that the encounter of ethnographers
with "other people" and their relations brought to the fore; but
importantly, it did not make any clearer to the ethnographer what the
"stuff" that grounded the misunderstandings is actually composed of.71
Yet, somewhat paradoxically, despite all this emphasis on
misunderstandings, incompatibility, grappling, failure, and critical
self-reflection of one's own assumptions---at the end of the day what is
left for the readers (at least if they do not explicitly focus on the
"ethnographic excess" found in the writings) is the impression that they
know more about "stuff" than they did before: that they understand the
situation better, that new knowledge has been produced, that the object
of analysis is more transparent than it has been before. How can this
subjugation of the encountered ontologically difference to academic
strategies of comprehensive sense-making avoided (if at all)?

This article itself is now coming up to what would normally be a
conclusion---i.e. the treacherous waters of nailing its contribution to
knowledge. Given that this article is yet again another "third-level"
engagement with questions of ontology and decoloniality, the question is
whether there is any way to avoid this pull of hegemonic modes of
academic knowledge production. Rather than providing a conclusion and
reiterate the core argument that the article has made, I will attempt to
finish this piece by raising even more questions, and by providing some
further reflections.

4\. Turtles all the Way Down: (Further) Reflections on What Questions to
Ask

The pull of hegemonic systems of academic knowledge production is
difficult to avoid. This is the case even in writings that are directly
based on ontological encounters and controversies, and that reflect on
the displacement that encountering different ontologies has entailed.
But as I have indicated, this problem is even more pronounced in
writings---like my own---that provide what I have previously called
"third-level" sense-making of ontological encounters.

The contribution of third-level analysis is usually a conceptual one,
which makes it by definition veer towards the general and abstract
rather than the concrete. In relation to the literature on decolonial
thought and the ontological turn, this becomes manifest in three
different (yet interrelated) ways: first, in the desire to provide an
understanding of ontology that enables a conceptualisation of the former
as multiple. Drawing on the work of Mario Blaser and Eduardo Viveiros de
Castro respectively, Rojas and Blaney and Tickner argue that ontology
can be thought of as multiple if reality is understood as always being
"enacted" or "performed". 72 This is what Blaser calls an understanding
of ontology as "materialsemiotic": one that defines reality as "always
in the making through the dynamic relations of hybrid assemblages". 73
Pinpointing it like this is inevitably geared towards answering the
question of what reality as such, in general is about. Secondly, there
is an ambition to coin the general normative-political project that
arises out of this understanding with a singular concept, such as the
pluriverse. Thirdly, arguments about ontological multiplicity and the
emancipatory-decolonial political projects that arise out of its
recognition are written for an audience of a particular discipline, such
as IR: the aim is to provide a wholesale, general rethinking, or,
indeed, "reconstruction" of the latter.74

What sort of questions drive conceptual work into that direction, and
what desire "to know" underlies the questions? According to Cherokee
philosopher Brian Yazzie Burkhart, for Native Americans "the questions
we choose to ask are more important than any truths we might hope to
discover in asking such questions". 75 By contrast, Western knowledge is
always (at least in the mainstream) propositional knowledge: "knowledge
of the form 'that something is so'". Here, knowledge cannot be verified
by referring to direct experiences: "there must be something underlying
them and justifying them". 76 Burkhart gives the example of the "routine
response" given by "Western people" to Indigenous accounts of creation:
"In \[one\] account, the earth rests on the back of a turtle. The
Western response to this account is simply the question, 'What holds the
turtle?'" This question makes no sense to the Native storyteller,
because the truth of the story lies in the paths to rightful action that
it outlines, rather than what it has to say about the "reality" of the
world. But when the Westerner insists on the question, the answer
finally is: "'Well, then there must be turtles all the way down'."77

Equating Rojas' and Blaney and Tickner's work with European mainstream
(hence analytic) philosophy seems, at first glance, incredibly unfair.
After all, those authors precisely advocate the cultivating of knowledge
by direct awareness or acquaintance in exactly the way that Burkhart
identifies as typical for Native Americans. But on the other hand, the
framework that circumscribes their emphasis on the need for
"concreteness" is still an abstract one that wants to answer the
question of how things really are and should be: enacted, performed,
pluriversal, ... The point is not whether this argument about reality
and politics is right or wrong. The point is to recognise that it is
driven by particular questions that might make no sense in the context
of other intelligence systems, but that need to be addressed in an
academic article in order to make a conceptual argument compelling,
convincing and original for an audience that primarily sits (whether it
likes it or not) within a Western, colonial, hegemonic system of
knowledge production.78 And even when the contribution to knowledge
production is not primarily conceptual, as in the "second-level" work
that I have analysed in the previous section in relation to the GMO
controversy, the final argument that is made (e.g. about peasants'
economic and cultural rights) is yet again lucid and comprehensible to
an audience that seeks to comprehend "stuff" within modern parameters.

Where to go from here (particularly as a white, European scholar)? As
suggested by Tucker, one way might be to engage in much more direct,
ethnographic research, which would enable more direct experience of
ontological encounters. Despite previously-mentioned problems of even
that research not going far enough, there is without doubt more space
for providing a sense of grappling and dislocation if the originality of
a piece of work is not purely grounded in the conceptual contribution it
aims to make. However, not every scholar is able--- body-, context- or
funding-wise---to spend extensive periods of time in different places,
and the ethical and political pitfalls of researching "radical
difference" through fieldwork with---but often rather on---others have
been pointed out by Indigenous scholars numerous times.79

But even for those unable or unwilling to do more primary, empirical
research, there is space to push the boundaries of what can and should
be written about (and how). For decades there have been attempts to
provide "innovative" platforms, for example at conferences, to talk
about "stuff" in different ways (e.g. through storytelling or artistic
practices; not at least by e.g. Indigenous peoples themselves80).
However, these "innovations" are still at the margins, and they will
most likely never be able to compete with acknowledged knowledge
production outlets such as journal articles and scholarly books. But
even within the latter, there is always at least some space to push for
more open-endedness, more reflection on the author's embodied
positionality, more auto-critique, more uncertainty and grappling (even
if this is based on reading about the ontological encounters of others).

Although this sort of embodied self-reflection on a writer's
"situatedness" (which in my own case means being "on the colonising side
of a divide"81) has obviously been advanced by many critical scholars
for decades (including feminists and post- as well as decolonial
scholars), this article has hopefully shown that [there is still
(**always**) a **need to go further**, in order to **more fundamentally
challenge hegemonic**, **modern/colonial modes** of knowledge
production]{.underline}. The sense of unease that I have outlined in
section two was particularly strong when reading conclusions that were
geared towards making recommendations for the discipline of IR, or for
"international politics", as such. [[Aiming to **make generic
conclusions for** ]{.mark}**entire disciplines**, **political fields**,
or [global "**issues**" **pushes**]{.mark} **the generality** and
**[abstraction]{.mark}** of a contribution **even [further
away]{.mark}** [from an **advocacy of the
concrete**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Why, and to whom, does it matter
whether IR, as a discipline, or international politics, as object of
study, becomes more pluriversal or not? What are the actual benefits of
the concept of the pluriverse in the first place? Or to pick up the
theme of this special issue: why does it matter whether IR is, or should
move into, a mode of affirmation rather than critique?82 Why is this a
good question to ask---and for whom? [[This]{.mark} is **not just a
theoretical problem**, but it [has **real-life consequences for
actually-existing decolonial struggles**. The desire for **making a
generic argument** about relational ontologies]{.mark} and a pluriversal
politics [**harbours the danger of making a huge variety of demands**
and **struggles**]{.mark} **that often exist [in tension]{.mark}** and
**contradiction** [with each other
**commensurable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indigenous demands for the
repatriation of "their" land might be at odds with the social justice
demands for redistribution and "the commons". 83 For Blaney and Tickner,
decolonial thought is commensurable with not just the ontological turn
literature, but also feminist and other critical interventions.84
Mignolo and Arturo Escobar advocate a transnational fight for global
justice and are enthusiastic about the potential of global movements to
achieve that aim together.85 Like Mignolo, Rojas explicitly draws on the
World Social Forum slogan "Another world is possible" as well as the
Zapatistas slogan of "a world where many words fit" to make her case
about the need for a pluriversal understanding of
emancipatory-decolonial politics.86 [While]{.underline} it can be argued
that [[this]{.mark} problem of **seeing all these struggles** and
**demands as commensurable** [goes back to a **lack of actual engagement
with particular** ]{.mark}**decolonial [practices]{.mark}** and
**battles**]{.underline}, what I have argued in this article is that
[[it is also related to]{.mark} the problem of **how** and [**what sort
of knowledge is produced** and **valued** in the Western academy:
knowledge that is **abstract**, **generic**, and **applicable beyond a
specific context**]{.mark}. Knowledge that is **driven** by the desire
to **know what is**.]{.underline} Knowledge that desires to know what
holds the turtle---all the way down.

### AT: Property Ks

#### Their kritik of property logics is [flattening]{.underline} and [disempowering]{.underline}. There are [multiple]{.underline} properties that are [not]{.underline} irredeemably entangled with hegemony.

**Shoemaker, 19**---Associate Professor of Law, University of Nebraska
College of Law (Jessica, "Transforming Property: Reclaiming Indigenous
Land Tenures," California Law Review 107, no. 5 (October 2019):
1531-1608, dml)

Because of these twin influences of standardization and stability,
[[property]{.mark} as a system [can **seem**]{.mark} **uniquely
[immune]{.mark}** [to reform]{.mark}]{.underline}.
**[[But]{.underline}]{.mark}** when we scratch at these initial
instincts, we see that [the **actual experience** of property systems
over time]{.underline}, and [around the world]{.underline}, [reflects a
**high degree** of pluralism and dynamism]{.underline}. This Section
explores this reality as a window to the broader range of available
options for the future of American Indian land tenure.

1\. Pluralism

Despite our deep ideas about the need for standardizing property
institutions, property institutions are highly pluralistic in practice.
Even with theoretically standardizing mechanisms like numerus clausus,
the units of property that do exist are highly malleable. This is
already evident in the initial creation of the special Indian trust
status and historic Indian title. But more so, even in the presumptively
standardized fee simple state system, property owners can use a range of
flexible legal tools\--including real covenants, equitable servitudes,
contracts, business forms, and private trusts\--to produce nearly any
combination of bespoke terms and conditions on property ownership. 239
Thus, the information-cost-reducing justification for property\'s most
standardizing attributes may never be fully achieved, and therefore need
not limit reform strategies so much.240

[Structurally]{.underline}, [[multiple]{.mark} property
[systems]{.mark}]{.underline}, each [derived [from **distinct sources**
of authority]{.mark}]{.underline}, already [[**coexist** and
**overlap**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the United States. 24\' Even core
aspects of non-Indian property law vary by state, and local governments
impose a variety of location-specific land use regulations.2 42 In
addition, [a **significant literature** has explored the overlap of
formal and informal legal and social orders for specific resource
control rights]{.underline}.243 Families in the United States have
multiple informal arrangements for property within their own
households.24 4 Ranchers and other resource users routinely develop
their own norms for trespass enforcement and control within specific
geographic areas. 245 And other [complex de facto property arrangements
emerge **everywhere**]{.underline} from standing in line for general
admission concert entry to traditions surrounding how one acquires and
protects a roller derby name. 246

Moreover, rather than producing economic travesties, [[this]{.mark} kind
of institutional flexibility and system-wide variation can be **highly
desirable**]{.underline}. [It [makes property]{.mark} more
**[robust]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[[innovative]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[[and **responsive** to a **wide range** of social
needs]{.underline}]{.mark}.247 Standardization [narratives assume
**material [wealth maximization]{.mark}** is the purpose of
property]{.underline}, [but this [is neither the **primary
purpose**]{.mark}]{.underline} of reservation land tenure [[nor the
**only function**]{.underline}]{.mark} of property itself. I have
already discussed how [[property]{.mark} law [can]{.mark}
**fundamentally [shape]{.mark}** [the way individuals **relate** to one
another]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[**engage** with the]{.mark} physical
[world]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}, by
communicating important social hierarchies and relationships,
[[**translate** social values]{.mark} to the real world]{.underline}.24
8 Designing these systems entails both material and nonmaterial values
choices. 24 9 Beyond just economic objectives, [property
designs]{.underline} also [reflect **essential choices** about
environmental stewardship]{.underline}, historic preservation,
individual liberties, shared [community relationships]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} distributional [equity]{.underline} ([or lack of
equity]{.underline}) among all citizens, whether they are property
owners or not. Discussions about this kind of values pluralism in
property are robust, particularly in the progressive property
literature. 25 0 This work reveals that [[property is]{.mark} **highly
[plural]{.mark}istic**]{.underline}, [and [there is **no
single**]{.mark} **correct [metric]{.mark}** [for
assessing]{.mark}]{.underline} the best design of [property
[relationships]{.mark}]{.underline}. 25 1

Buried in colonialism was a pervasive idea that Indigenous and European
property systems could not coexist because Indigenous property rights
were incompatible with English privatized interests, and \"as a matter
of the relationship between the two regimes: simply by existing, the one
excludes the other.\"25 2 It may be true that [**[some]{.mark}**
conflicts [are inevitable]{.mark} to the extent]{.underline} the two
[regimes create **literally contested claimants**]{.underline} to the
same physical space or object. For example, Canadian scholar John
Borrows has emphasized the importance of physical mobility to Indigenous
freedom. Borrows argues that Indigenous Peoples must be permitted \"to
freely move throughout our countries, and across the broad world of
ideas,\" with flexibility to \"relate to land and ideas \[not\] as
others expect.\" 25 3 Although such freedom is essential, direct
[[conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark} to a single resource [[may]{.mark}
sometimes [be]{.mark} **best [resolved]{.mark}** [through
a]{.mark}]{.underline} unified [**[property order]{.mark}** or
negotiations between legal orders]{.underline}.25 4 Apart from these
direct conflicts, however, divergent property regimes and values can and
do exist in multiple contexts.2 ss

There is no insurmountable reason tribal governments should be denied
the freedom to explore different property law ideas and design their own
property regimes to reflect a unique balance of values and concerns. In
fact, given pressing environmental and equitable issues across the
United States today, this landscape of exploratory innovation in
property law may be essential to building greater resilience for all of
us.

2\. Dynamism

Outside of reservation territories, this kind of values pluralism is
constantly negotiated and renegotiated in property and land use
regulation, in both large and small ways. Despite narratives of
stability, [property law is **actually highly dynamic**]{.underline}.
The key is to consider how property dynamism operates [at **different
scales** and across **different institutional dimensions**]{.underline}.

[[Much]{.mark} of the [lit]{.mark}erature]{.underline} on property
system change [[focuses on]{.underline}]{.mark} rare, cataclysmic
transitions from commons or other forms of collective ownership to
privatized property, or vice versa. 25 6 Even then, there is much we do
not understand.257 This work focuses on very dramatic restructuring
events and emphasizes changes that occur only along
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} \"[[right to
**exclude**]{.underline}]{.mark}\" axis, moving for example from open
access to an individual\'s right to keep out nonowners. Examples include
the shift from common fields and feudalism to enclosure and then
westernized private property in England,258 the transitions in and out
of farm collectivization in the Soviet Union and the People\'s Communes
in Mao\'s China,25 9 and Harold Demsetz\'s famous (and highly contested)
narrative of the emergence of private rights to fur trading territories
among the Indigenous populations of the Labrador Peninsula. 2 60

[[Other property reforms]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, have occurred in
different ways but [[are]{.mark} **no less
[important]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Examples include]{.mark} the
**[desegregation]{.mark}** of white-only lunch counters]{.underline} in
the South; [the advent of **new [tenure structures]{.mark}** including
modern condominiums]{.underline}, [cooperatives]{.underline}, [and
planned developments]{.underline}; [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
introduction of **[important [creditor
protections]{.mark}]{.underline}** for the family home. 261

In practice, [property has **adapted** over time and continues to do
so]{.underline}. 262 In fact, [property **must** incorporate the
capacity for reform]{.underline}, change, and exchange. 263 The
consequence of perpetual stability is ossification, and this risk has to
be balanced with responsiveness to changing conditions and demands. 2 6
[Legitimate property systems must continue to evolve to respond to
changing citizen needs and on-the-ground circumstances over
time]{.underline}. 265 In fact, mainstream property scholarship has even
debated recently whether the fee simple absolute itself is ready for a
newer, changed incarnation-or should be abandoned altogether.266

[Property change]{.underline} actually [occurs across **different
variables** and at **different scales**]{.underline},
[reflecting]{.underline} more [**nuanced gradations** in how property is
defined and regulated]{.underline}. For example, [instead of thinking of
property]{.underline} as only changing [in a **binary** way]{.underline}
from open access to private, Shitong Qiao and Frank Upham have argued
that [exclusion exists along a **spectrum** that may change in **myriad
ways** over time based on **context**]{.underline}.267 [There is a
**whole range** of hybrid institutional choices]{.underline}. For
example, Scotland underwent a major land reform process in 2003.268 It
now recognizes a public right to access private and public lands for
certain beneficial uses, which limits a landowner\'s right to exclude
sometimes, but not always, in nuanced ways.

In addition, [[property]{.mark} reforms [occur **not only**
along]{.mark} the **[exclusion]{.mark}** axis [but across a **range** of
other]{.mark} property [functions]{.mark} and rights]{.underline}.
Abraham Bell, Gideon Parchomovsky, and others have argued that [focusing
**only** on the axis of exclusion]{.underline} ([or on who **owns** the
asset]{.underline}) [**misses** many other evolutionary trajectories in
property law.]{.underline} 27 0 These include changes in the boundaries
of the owner\'s other rights of dominion (including the terms of an
owner\'s rights to possession and use) and the asset configuration
itself.271 For example, other notable historic land reforms have
included changes in whether women can even own property,272 what
inventions and ideas are available for intellectual property
protection,273 and the invention of zoning law itself.274

Finally, property change can and does occur in different-sized events.
Carol Rose has classified three levels of property system changes. The
most radical shifts\--like the abolition of slavery\--require some kind
of major revolution or political upheaval. 275 In the middle, various
regulatory adjustments respond to smaller social changes, like
modifications of environmental laws based on developing science or
ecological concerns. 276 And finally, functioning property systems also
require a host of little adjustments made on an ongoing, housekeeping
basis as citizens, and sometimes courts, resolve everyday uncertainties
and concrete disputes between stakeholders. 277

In all cases, [property is constantly changing]{.underline},
[experimenting]{.underline}, [and evolving]{.underline}.
[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} final [[challenge]{.underline}]{.mark} in
thinking about the future of American Indian land tenure, then, [[is
**not** whether]{.underline}]{.mark} a range of more creative [[reforms
are **possible**]{.underline}]{.mark} ([[they
**are**]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[but **how**]{.mark} **best [to get
there]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is the subject of the penultimate
Section.

### AT: Realism Ks

#### Realism enables [radical resistance]{.underline} to domination---at [worst]{.underline}, there's [no link]{.underline} to their Ks because realism isn't a [monolith]{.underline}.

**Franceschet, 24**---Professor, Department of Political Science,
University of Calgary (Antonio, "A Realist Ethos of Resistance in Global
Politics," Global Studies Quarterly, Volume 4, Issue 2, April 2024, dml)

This article argues that [Realism contains an implicit ethos of
**resistance**]{.underline}, [which **reverses** the conventional image
of the tradition as **coldly accepting** the powerful dominating the
weak]{.underline}. Uncovering this ethos, however, requires three shifts
of perspective immanent to Realist debates. Disputes over the
possibility and significance of these shifts are longstanding and yet
have been the focus of much recent scholarship aimed at critically
reinterpreting a "classical" Realism in contrast to structuralist and
conservative variants. These shifts are (1) from an extreme to moderate
view of power politics; (2) from naturalizing the status quo to
envisaging progressive change from within the political domain; and (3)
from a horizontal view of politics among nations (or other like
entities) to a global view of power politics. In this article, a Realist
ethos of resistance is also articulated through a parallel engagement
with the philosopher Bernard Williams. His anti-moralist theory of
legitimate political power is an influential resource in new Realist
political theory. I extend his key concepts to a wider discussion---in
both IR and political theory---of the tradition's implicit ethos of
resistance. By engaging with classical Realist themes in IR in tandem
with Williams' ideas, [this]{.underline} article [illustrates Realism's
significance as a **challenger** to apologies for **domination** and
**injustice**]{.underline}. The contribution of this article is to
position a Realist voice about the realities of power politics in recent
debates over human rights to resist in global politics. Together,
classical and "new" [Realisms are **relevant** because they can
theorize]{.underline} such rights [within the context of knowledge about
the conditions and limits of legitimate power in **real-world
struggles**]{.underline}, [rather than **moralizing** resistance in the
**abstract**]{.underline}.

[This]{.underline} argument for a Realist ethos of resistance [builds
upon **extensive scholarship**]{.underline}, in both IR and political
theory, [**undercutting** the notion that Realism is a doctrine
of]{.underline} "**[might makes right]{.underline}**." As Vibeke Schou
Tjalve and Michael C. Williams state, "[From its
**origins**]{.underline}, political [realism has been based on being
**sociologically realistic** and **ethically responsible**]{.underline}"
(Tjalve and Williams 2015, 58). [The argument also builds on the
recovery of intellectual resources]{.underline}, [from **within** the
tradition]{.underline}, [concerning **morally illegitimate** forms and
uses of power]{.underline}, [in addition to the political ethics of
resistance struggles **against domination** and
**injustices**]{.underline}. That scholarship uncovers how
[exemplar]{.underline} mid-twentieth century classical
[Realists]{.underline}, such as Hans J. Morgenthau and Reinhold Niebuhr,
[**insisted** on the need to]{.underline}, in Morgenthau's words,
"[**regulate** and **restrain** the power drives that otherwise would
either tear society apart or deliver the weak to the arbitrary will of
the powerful]{.underline}" (Morgenthau 1985, 244). Indeed, [classical
Realist meditations on restraint and the limitation of power extend to
the **inevitability** and **necessity** of bottom-up challenges to
domination]{.underline} (Tjalve 2008; Hartnett 2021). This literature
complements recent applications of Realist ideas to the philosophy and
tactics of civil resistance and civil disobedience (Mantena 2012; King
2018; Sabl 2021). Building on these interventions, I develop a concept
of an ethos of resistance to frame and ground legitimate resistance
within the frictions and disagreements of the broader tradition, and
then situate a Realist voice in contemporary debates about resistance
rights in an era of global injustices.

This article proceeds in five steps: First, I outline how [the
tradition's core tenets are **not fixed**]{.underline}, and yet can
still be represented as a conversation about knowledge and truth about
the "reality" of politics and the challenges of formulating a political
morality appropriate to this reality. Second, I define Realism's
implicit relationship to an ethos of resistance through examples, both
the canonical and the unexpected, to provide a glimpse---and initial
description---of Realism's ethos. Third, I show how [an ethos of
resistance aligns with]{.underline} three **[shifts]{.underline}**
immanent to debates [within]{.underline} classical and "new"
[Realisms]{.underline} noted above---[toward
**moderation**]{.underline}, [embracing **progressive political
change**]{.underline}, [and a **global view** of power
relations]{.underline}. Fourth, I reinterpret the Realist philosopher
Bernard Williams' key concepts of the first political question and the
Basic Legitimation Demand as illustrations of an ethos of resistance
(Williams 2005). Finally, I situate this ethos in recent literatures
concerning a universal human right to resist domination and injustice.
By identifying Realism's internal resources for an ethos of resistance,
I show how the tradition both complements and critiques recent
non-Realist scholarship. Rather than advancing an applied ethics of
resistance, a Realist ethos focuses on how politics is about legitimate
power in contextual and real-world struggles.

A preliminary comment on resistance is in order. In this article,
resistance refers to a variety of political acts resulting from a
capacity to withstand or limit power (Barbalet 1985, 531). Resistance
comes in many forms and varies according to the nature of the power it
seeks to limit (Barnett and Duvall 2005). Depending on the context,
resisters seek a diversity of actions and outcomes, including
withdrawing cooperation and labor in support of a particular political
and social order, mobilizing political opposition, undermining a foreign
occupation, terrorism, and causing a revolution resulting in regime
change.1 In all its forms, resistance contests the legitimacy of power.
Acknowledging the variety of resistances, this article starts and ends
with a broad conception, and then narrows the topic by focusing on the
illegitimacy of domination.

What is Realism? From Axioms to Two Axes

[Realism is]{.underline} an "artificial construct" built from
asynchronous conversations about politics (Forde 1992, 62). As Jonathan
Haslam states, it is [a]{.underline} "[**spectrum** of
ideas]{.underline}" [and **not**]{.underline} "[a **fixed point of
focus** with sharp definition]{.underline}" (Haslam 2002, 249). In IR,
the history of political thought, and political theory, many seek to
define Realism's core tenets or axioms. Three general axioms from the
literature are (1) that politics should be understood on its own terms,
rather than through moral, idealistic, or religious categories (Galston
2010, 408; Finlayson 2017, 267); (2) that politics results from and
reflects intractable realities, namely "disagreement, contestation, and
coercion" (Rossi and Sleat 2014, 691; see also McQueen 2017, 297). And
therefore, (3) descriptively and prescriptively, Realists analyze the
"primacy of self-interest over moral principle" as a "necessity, and
therefore as a right" (Forde 1992, 62). It is possible to identify other
and more specific axioms but doing so risks having to concede exceptions
and internal disagreements. Rather than ignore the impact of these
divergences and incongruities, some point to the advantages of a
"reflexive" approach to Realist theorizing. Here, as Brent J. Steele
notes, "Reflexive [realism does not]{.underline}. . .[seek to
**reify**]{.underline} central modern realist [assumptions of
**power**]{.underline}, **[anarchy]{.underline}**, [or even]{.underline}
'**[the state]{.underline}**' [as **absolute**]{.underline} principles
of international politics, [but instead as contexualized artefacts that
**can** and **have changed**]{.underline}" (Steele 2007, 276--7).
Similarly, as Geróid Brinn argues, the problem in defining Realism in
relation to "shared tenets" is that "[even when different realists do
have shared commitments]{.underline}, [they will often mean **very
different things** to each]{.underline}" (Brinn 2020, 211).

To advance my argument about a Realist ethos of resistance, I focus on
two axes as virtual lines of conversation---both in agreement and
dispute---over the axioms that are commonly asserted:

Axis 1 (A1): Realism gravitates around the goal of advancing knowledge
claims about the fundamental nature of the political and power;

Axis 2 (A2): Realism confronts and advances questions of political
morality not in the abstract, but within the logic of A1 knowledge
claims.

The A1 axis involves claims about the nature and effects of the "given"
or limiting features of politics, and includes inter alia: human nature
and psychology; the insecurities and fears actors have in conditions of
anarchy or insecurity; and conflict and disagreement over fundamental
interests, values, and identities. An example of an A1 statement by a
classical Realist is Hans J. Morgenthau's: "the truth of political
science is the truth about power, its manifestations, its
configurations, its limitations, implications, its laws" (quoted in
Cozette 2008, 10). Another example from new Realist political theory is
Bernard Williams' assertion of the "universalism of negative
capabilities." He states, "the only certainly universal material of
politics: \[is\] power, powerlessness, fear and cruelty" (2005, 59). As
exemplars of classical and new Realisms, [neither Morgenthau nor
Williams assert that we must simply **take the world as it
is**]{.underline}. Rather, [knowledge claims are entangled with
practical and moral questions framed by the political]{.underline}; A1
statements raise A2 questions. [Seeking to **avoid wishful
thinking**]{.underline}, **[infeasible hopes]{.underline}**, [and
**abstract doctrines**]{.underline}, [Realists]{.underline}' A2
[discourse is]{.underline} distinctive.

Morgenthau follows his statement above [about uncovering
the]{.underline} "**[truth]{.underline}**" [about power's
manifestations]{.underline}, [configurations]{.underline},
[limitations]{.underline}, [and laws]{.underline}, with the A2 statement
that a Realist must tell "power what it can do and what it ought to do,
what is feasible and what is required" (quoted in Cozette 2008, 10).
Similarly, as William Galston writes, new "[Realists begin from where a
given political community **is**]{.underline}, [they assess the
**strength** of the bulwarks against the great evils of the human
condition that community has erected]{.underline}, [and they formulate
the **next steps** based on that assessment]{.underline}" (2010, 396).
At the same time, there are internal frictions within Realism because
the "universal" materials of politics (A1) and "next steps" are both
contextual and contested (A2). Defined in terms of a set of typical
axioms, Realism lacks a clearcut, paradigmatic, or shared perspective on
legitimate resistance to domination. However, when the tradition is also
understood relative to longstanding conversations about (A1) knowledge
claims of political reality, and (A2) the practical and moral
engagements that arise, we can see glimpses of an ethos of resistance.

Glimpses of a Realist Ethos of Resistance

Glimpses of a Realist ethos of resistance appear in revisiting and
reappraising some dominant narratives of the tradition. Thucydides'
famous "Realist" account of a dialogue in the Peloponnesian War
(431--404 B.C.E.) is often misunderstood (see Lebow 2003, 35). The
backdrop is Athens' wider war with Sparta. In the conversation between
the powerful Athenian generals and the weaker Melians, the former
demanded allegiance and submission. The Melian leaders maintain a right
of neutrality and independence, as a matter of justice (Thucydides 2008,
567). The Athenians' notorious response is that, among those unequal in
power, "the strong do what they can. . .the weak suffer what they must"
(2008, 566--7). When the dialogue ends, it is understood that the
Athenians "besieged the place" with the Melians being killed and
enslaved for their resistance (2008, 576).

The meaning and results of these words and actions are often depicted as
an instance of Realist intellectual and moral "honesty" (Forde 1992,
72). But "Thucydides leads his readers to regard this \[slaughter of the
Melians\] as an act of barbarism---that is, as morally reprehensible in
some sense," and one that eventually leads to Athens' breakdown into
"factious strife" (Forde 1992, 73). As Richard Ned Lebow argues,
Thucydides' narrative is not reducible to propositional axioms about
power, and the supposed futility of resistance. Rather, "Greek tragedy
and classical realists had a different understanding of knowledge" or
"tacit political knowledge," which engages "our intellect and emotions"
(Lebow 2003, 59). As he writes,

Thucydides is using the Dialogue to tell us that raw force can impose
its will at any moment, but no empire has the military and economic
capability to repress its subjects indefinitely. Allies who regard
themselves the objects of exploitation will rebel when the opportunity
arises. Oppression also leaves memories that inhibit future attempts at
empire building. (Lebow 2003, 125)

Indeed, an over-extended Athenian power, applied with needless cruelty,
was undercut by a deeper crisis of legitimacy (Lebow 2003, 216).

Many including Lebow highlight the parallels between Thucydides and
Morgenthau's Realist opposition to the Vietnam War in the 1960s (Lebow
2003, 125; Cozette 2008, 16--8; Scheuerman 2009, 164--95; Zambernardi
2011). Morgenthau believed it was unrealistic for the United States to
expect to convert its superior military power into victory in Vietnam,
and the elimination of communist influence in the region. But crucially,
he took seriously that the Vietnamese resistance was part of a longer
"national" struggle to drive out foreign and colonial dominators
(Morgenthau 1968, 32; Lebow 2003, 240; Zambernardi 2011, 1340). For the
Vietnamese, fighting for national independence was a grave interest,
although they were divided on how to achieve it. By contrast, the United
States had no similarly grave interest in the fight, despite what its
leaders claimed (Lebow 2003, 240). From an American perspective,
Morgenthau believed the war was unnecessary and could only undermine
influence among allies and national unity (Scheuerman 2009, 171--2).

These two widely discussed Realist vignettes are important examples of
disputes among Realists over core axioms. Consider the axiom of the
primacy of self-interest over moral principle. Were the Athenian
generals being "Realists" when they asserted that their self-interest
and superior power required dispensing with any notion of "justice"? Or
was Thucydides' observation that Athens' extreme and infamous slaughter
of the Melians epitomized a loss of ethical balance and restraint that
many believe should define the tradition? Morgenthau's Thucydides-like
"Realist" critique of the American War in Vietnam clashed with others
who saw the conflict as a necessary response to Cold War geopolitical
struggles, and with vital national interests at stake (Zambernardi 2011,
1352--3). Such disagreement raises again the awkward question of whose
Realism is more attuned to the "real" A1 truths and knowledge claims.
Morgenthau's protest of the American War on Vietnamese resisters has
become a new cautionary tale, particularly in the scholarship on [the
tradition's]{.underline} classical, [reflexive history]{.underline}, and
contemporary relevance (Lebow 2003, 234--54; Williams 2005, 193; Steele
2007, 286; Tjalve 2008, 2, 75, 118).

These two well-known vignettes also [offer suggestive glimpses
of]{.underline} this article's central concept, an ethos of
resistance---[an implicit attitude that resistance is a **legitimate
response** to domination by the powerful]{.underline}. Karuna Mantena's
article on Mohandas [**Gandhi**'s activism against British colonial rule
provides another]{.underline}, unexpected [glimpse of such an
ethos]{.underline}. He depicts Gandhi's leadership and philosophy as
[premised on]{.underline} "another" kind of **[Realism]{.underline}**
(2012, 457). Inverting the stereotype of naïve moralism, Mantena asserts
that key texts and events show a much different picture: "[Gandhi\'s
realist theory of politics was a **contextual**]{.underline},
**[consequentialist]{.underline}**, and moral-psychological [analysis of
a political world understood to be marked by inherent tendencies toward
conflict]{.underline}, domination, and violence" (Mantena 2012, 459).
[Gandhi focused on how non-violence is a]{.underline} "[**practical
orientation** and a set of **strategic responses** rather than simply an
**ethical stance** or standard of moral judgement]{.underline}" (Mantena
2012). Quite clearly, Gandhi was more than a dispassionate historical
observer, like Thucydides, and exercised an influence different than an
activist--scholar--citizen like Morgenthau, who was frustrated by his
country's reckless imposition of power in Southeast Asia. Yet Mantena
shows that Gandhi's leadership was based on a dispassionate
interpretation of the human passions and inclinations, such as pride,
honor, and reactivity to cycles of violence (along the A1 axis). At the
same time, Mantena's research shows how Gandhi dissolved the distinction
between the A1 and A2 axes: The active demonstration of truth
(satyagraha) through disciplined and restrained non-cooperation
demonstrated the irrational contradictions and illegitimacy of British
colonial rule (Mantena 2012, 462--4). This study recasts the events
surrounding Gandhi's moral leadership beyond their well-known effects on
transforming the real-world politics of colonial domination, as Realist
rather than moralistic. I suggest they also offer a glimpse of what is
meant here by an ethos of resistance.

I use [the term **ethos**]{.underline} to [underline that Realism's
political morality **eschews** a **universalist**]{.underline},
[**extra-political** concept of right and wrong that **takes
precedence** over the real-world political realm]{.underline}. Instead,
[an ethos is a disposition and attitude to this realm]{.underline}.
Indeed, recent scholarship on classical IR Realism often employs the
term ethos to point to distinctive versions of a non-moralistic
political morality.2 As Mark T. Lilla writes, [an ethos can inform and
overlay a morality or ethical code]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} by
doing so, it [becomes]{.underline} "[**more** than **abstract
reasoning**]{.underline}" (Lilla 1981, 14). Indeed, "\[e\]thical theory
is really the furthest thing from an ethos. . .\[[which
tends]{.underline}\] [towards abstract logical systems **quite
divorced** from the lives we live]{.underline}" (Lilla 1981, 10). [The
term can also be related to]{.underline} Max Weber's political ethos,
characterized by skepticism of moral absolutism and [recognition of the
need to]{.underline} "[make **consequentialist calculations** to help
determine the appropriateness of particular political
means]{.underline}" (Satkunanandan 2014, 169). Such an ethos accepts the
"'ethical irrationality' of the world and thereby rise\[s\] to the
fundamental, substantively unspecifiable, and inexhaustible
responsibility \[of political actors\] to respond to the world 'as it
really is'" (Satkunanandan 2014).

This article suggests that an ethos of resistance in Realism overlays
the specific political and ethical judgments and decisions of scholars
and actors. With such an ethos, resistance is understood as a blameless
response to those responsible for domination and injustices, rather than
as futile action. But not all Realists would adopt such an ethos; and in
the next section, I show how it only comes into focus within the
tradition because of three choices.

Three Realist Choices: Moderate, Progressive, and Global

These initial glimpses of a Realist ethos of resistance correspond with
three choices within the tradition's history. The ethos is activated by:
(1) choosing political moderation over extremism; (2) an openness to
progressive change to a status quo versus conserving extant power
arrangements; and (3) an expansiveness with respect to theorizing the
significance of resistance in politics, locating it globally rather than
horizontally among states or vertically between a state and its
subjects.

Extremist and Moderate Realisms

The most significant internal divide between Realists is often described
as the extremist versus moderate orientations to politics (A1) and the
morality (A2) of action (see Forde 1992; Mantena 2012, 455; McQueen
2017, 298). At the extremist end of the spectrum, Realism endorses might
makes right, a maxim that moderates reject in favor of making judgments
about the need to balance and modulate conflicting political objectives.

Extremist Realism argues that natural or objective forces create an
unyielding reality of struggles for power. In such struggles, those with
more power possess a "right" to dominate the weak (as an A1 claim). The
Athenian generals tell the Melians, "You know as well as we do that
right, as the world goes, is only in question between equals in power"
(Thucydides 2008, 566). As Walzer (1977, 5) observes, the logic of this
argument is that political necessity narrows and bifurcates the
political: For Athens, it is "reign or be subject," and for the Melians,
it is "yield or be destroyed." Extremist Realism "claim\[s\] to have
discovered an awful truth: what we conventionally call inhumanity is
simply humanity under pressure" (Walzer 1977, 4). Indeed, contemporary
structural Realists such as John Mearsheimer appeal to the so-called
awful truth to explain if not justify great power domination and
aggression: "The sad fact is that international politics has always been
a ruthless and dangerous business, and it is likely to remain that
way....the international system forces states which seek only to be
secure to nonetheless act aggressively toward each other" (Mearsheimer
2014, 2, 3). Recently, he applied this view to Russia's annexation and
invasions of Ukraine, as understandable responses to Western powers'
behavior, namely, attempts to check or limit Russia's sphere of
dominance (i.e., expanding NATO's membership) (Mearsheimer 2022). Not
unlike Athens' atrocities in Melos, Russia's attacks on Ukrainian
civilian targets are extreme. But for extreme Realists, real-world
politics will necessarily involve atrocities inflicted on the weak.

Challenging extremist Realist arguments is a necessary step to
identifying how and where an ethos of resistance can fit in the broader
tradition. Ido Oren (2009) challenges the contradictions in structural
Realism's approach to the relationship of supposedly objective realities
and prescriptive advocacy. On the one hand, Mearsheimer (2014, 3) argues
that the objective realities of power and anarchy cannot be altered to
appease an extraneous ideology or morality, such as justice or human
rights (Mearsheimer 2014, 46--8). On the other hand, when real-world
actors---whether victims or third-party powers---resist or push back,
the extremist version of structural Realism asserts prescriptive
language against irrational behavior, i.e., at odds with the actors'
objective interests. But as Oren asks, "if there\'s a 'real world'
impervious to political thought, why bother to try to influence it?"
(2009, 283). After all, the Athenians generals try to convince the
Melians that it would be better for all concerned if they simply
capitulated. As well, Mearsheimer criticizes Western policymakers for
insensitivity to Russia's geopolitical anxieties about NATO's eastward
expansion (Mearsheimer 2022). Unless significantly amended, extremist
Realism's descriptive (A1) and prescriptive faces (A2) become
paradoxical, leading to an "impossibility of being a consistent and
thoroughgoing realist" (Oren 2009, 296).

This impossibility is augmented by extremist Realism's ideas concerning
political (a)morality. As Mantena suggests, "if politics is understood
as determining, partly or wholly, its own internal standards, it opens
the door to harder edged realisms that dispense with the category of
morality altogether" (2012, 346). By fetishizing the strong's
ability/"right" to dominate the weak, extreme Realists go far beyond
steering clear of naive moralism. Instead, they advocate a kind of
solipsist amoralism for the most powerful actors. The position of the
Athenian generals is that the Melians ought to "have the good sense to
submit to the inevitable domination of the stronger" rather than
"moralizing the supposed 'injustice' of it" (Forde 1992, 72). Submitting
to the stronger power "without resistance. . .\[would minimize\] the
suffering on both sides" (Forde 1992). With such claims, and to Walzer's
point, extreme Realism hollows out and eviscerates any possibilities for
the meaningful moral argumentation (along A2).

[Closer examination of the tradition reveals the persistence of a
moderate alternative rooted in classical Realism]{.underline}. For
moderates, [politics is **not reducible** to the power to **dominate**
and **coerce** others]{.underline} (Lebow 2003, 275, 310; Barkin 2010,
19--20). Instead, [politics must entail perceptions of authority or
legitimacy]{.underline}, [as well as leadership or political
judgment]{.underline}, [which together provide
opportunities]{.underline}---[and responsibilities]{.underline}---[to
**temper** the most flagrant of excessive impulses of
power]{.underline}. Indeed, for moderates, [unrestrained
power]{.underline}, [and flagrant injustices **undermine** the
fundamental]{.underline} political and social [purposes that power is
meant to create and secure]{.underline}.3 While structuralist Realism
remains a dominant IR approach, a recent generation of reflexive,
broadly constructivist research shows how the tradition's history is
heavily populated with the arguments of moderate Realists. Thucydides,
Hobbes, Clausewitz, Morgenthau, and other classical Realists theorized
how the tensions among politics, power, legitimacy, and resistance
cannot be short-circuited in favor of extremist actions (Lebow 2003, 35;
Steele 2007, 273; Hom and Steele 2010, 272; Levine 2012, 26; Tjalve and
Williams 2015, 39; Hom 2018, 139). There is also a literature uncovering
how [many classical Realist reactions to power are rooted
in]{.underline} religious [conceptions of **human finitude** and
**social justice**]{.underline}, [as well as]{.underline} early modern
European and republican conceptions of [the need to **check** and
**limit** uncontrolled power and domination]{.underline} (Rosenthal
1991; Murray 1996; Williams 2005, 6, 18; Tjalve 2008, 5, 16; Tjalve and
Williams 2015, 39--40; Hartnett 2021). Indeed, [a moderate Realism
theorizes power in terms of legitimacy and limitation]{.underline}, [and
this introduces an **accepting**]{.underline}, [if not
**radical**]{.underline}, [advocacy for resistance to
domination]{.underline}. Moreover, [moderates see resistance to abuses
and injustices as **important** and **consequential**]{.underline},
[rather than futile and irrelevant]{.underline}.

Status Quo and Progressive Realisms

[It is axiomatic for Realism that]{.underline} disagreement, conflict,
and [power struggles cannot be eliminated through instituting a
universal set of moral values]{.underline} and legal norms. [But it is
an **ongoing debate** whether this skepticism]{.underline} ultimately
[reinforces status quo power relations]{.underline} and institutions,
[or whether Realism can envisage **progressive** and even **radical**
change]{.underline} (Finlayson 2017; Goodhart 2018, 81--106; Brinn
2020). As Duncan Bell writes, [Realism is]{.underline}
"**[not]{.underline}** (in any of its usual variants) [a **fully
fledged** political ideology]{.underline}, [with coherent and
determinate positions]{.underline} on a wide range of moral and
political issues" (Bell 2009, 12). Instead, [the tradition is a
**conversation** among ideologically and politically diverse
standpoints]{.underline}. Realist disagreement over the necessity and
possibility of reconciling power politics with purposeful social and
political change, even progress, occurs along both A1 and A2.

[In **contrast** to stereotypes of Realists as **complacent** and
**conservative**]{.underline}, [recent scholarship has shown how **key
thinkers** of the tradition sought **feasible challenges** to existing
power relations and institutions]{.underline}. For instance, Michael
Williams' (2005) category of "wilful" Realists, illustrated by Thomas
Hobbes, J.-J. Rousseau, and Morgenthau, paints a different picture. For
these thinkers, being realistic requires a political social construction
project; the constitution of actors capable of generating conditions for
legitimacy in liberal modernity (2005, 16, 20). Similarly,
**[Scheuerman]{.underline}** (2011) [contrasts more
**conservative-minded** Realists]{.underline}, who prioritize skepticism
of change to the point where support for a status quo is the only
"realistic" choice, [with **progressive** Realists]{.underline},
[who]{.underline} advocate for significant, yet gradual reforms.
Twentieth-century progressive Realists include E.H. Carr, Reinhold
Niebuhr, and Hans J. Morgenthau. Unlike the latter-day conservatives
Scheuerman mentions (such as Henry Kissinger, Kenneth Waltz, and
Mearsheimer), this earlier wave of progressives [argued that Realism
**errs** when it tracks **too closely** with the interests of status quo
power arrangements]{.underline}. For one thing, [endorsing a status quo
of great power relations **increases the possibility** of **nuclear**
and other **atrocities**]{.underline}. [The very **survival** of the
species]{.underline} and of the political domain, one for which there
are opportunities to preserve and advance human interests, [is at
stake]{.underline}. But [there is a more comprehensive set of
progressive interests at stake in **challenging injustices** and
**inequalities**]{.underline}.

On political and moral grounds, [classical Realists have **critiqued**
efforts to conserve **perverse power inequalities** or **social
domination**]{.underline}. Dissent and resistance to unjust power
structures were key themes in both Niebuhr and Morgenthau's
interventions. To be clear, neither claimed nor advocated that
revolutionary politics or violence is the best remedy for oppression or
domination. Yet [they **firmly rejected** passively accepting an unjust
status quo]{.underline}. [**Niebuhr** wrote against moralistic and
religious pacifisms that acquiesce to violent oppression]{.underline},
[whether in the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, [with respect to **racial
discrimination**]{.underline}, [or **globally** in respect to
**imperialism**]{.underline} (Scheuerman 2011, 22; Hartnett 2021, 161).
As he wrote in his 1932 Moral Man and Immoral Society: "When collective
power, whether in the form of imperialism or class domination, exploits
weakness, it can never be dislodged unless power is raised against it.
If conscience and reason can be insinuated into the resulting struggle
they can only qualify but not abolish it" (Niebuhr 2021, 6). Similarly,
Morgenthau argued that "social conflict remained permanent features of
the human condition" and that justice and equilibrium among conflicting
groups were required to "eliminate the incentive to seek justice through
strife" (Scheuerman 2011, 24). [Far from a **complacent acceptance** of
power realities]{.underline}, [**Morgenthau** argued that a Realist
theory]{.underline} "\[a\]t its very best. . .[**cannot help** being a
**subversive** and **revolutionary** force]{.underline} with regard to
certain vested interests---intellectual, political, economic, social in
general."4Mantena's (2012) analysis of Gandhi's activist philosophy
echoes Scheuerman and others' treatments of mid-century American and
European progressive Realists. [For such Realism]{.underline},
[progressive change is **possible** and **necessary** for countering
injustices]{.underline}, [whether caused by **great power
hubris**]{.underline}, **[capitalism]{.underline}**,
**[colonialism]{.underline}**, [or other forces of **social
domination**]{.underline}.5

Indigenous engagement in renewable energy projects is motivated by
several factors, including economic development, self-determination, and
climate change adaptation.

Renewable energy is recognized as an economic opportunity by, and for,
Indigenous Peoples. [The ]{.underline}[Cowessess Renewable Energy

Despite the risks associated with renewable energy developments, on a

[Position: [Green transition as]{.mark} a driver of change The
[Arctic]{.mark} has the [potential to play]{.mark} an important role in
the green transition, as illustrated in the four fingerprints. Both
[as]{.mark} an important provider of [resources]{.mark} (material and
energy), [and]{.mark} as [assistance to meet]{.mark} the climate goals
agreed upon in the 2015 [Paris]{.mark} Agreement by making it easier to
replace fossil fuels with renewables as well as providing carbon
storage.]{.underline} Meanwhile, changes also bring opportunities and
green transition can be a driver of change in the Arctic -- to improve
quality of life, well-being, and support the local livelihoods in Arctic
communities. For the peoples of the Arctic, there is a need for both
sustaining the good life while being part of a global green transition
moving away from fossil fuels dependency. [Green [transitions]{.mark},
if managed well[, can be of]{.mark} particular [importance]{.mark} to
the continuation and proliferation of Indigenous cultures, as we learned
from NWT. However, other settings we have identified include how the
concept can offer a "promise" about being green and transformative
without being binding or committing to local needs or
agendas.]{.underline} As FAI scholars, we would like to encourage a
green transition informed by the knowledge and expertise that already
exists within the local communities, also make sure to connect local
communities across the Arctic regions as to be inspired by each other

citizens. Takeaways from our field trips, observations, and document
analysis conducted in various places in the Arctic on the current
position is: 1. The Arctic has a new strategic role because of the green
transition, 2. Arctic [communities lack]{.mark} physical as well as
policy [infrastructure]{.mark} [for a]{.mark} successful
[transition]{.mark}, 3. Green transition is not "a one size fits all" in
the Arctic; different communities have different opportunities as well
as requirements when it comes to green transition, 4. There is a
knowledge gap both in terms of what Arctic communities need from a
transition, and how these needs best could be met, and 5. Green
transition can become an important driver of change in the
Arctic.]{.underline}

the tactics employed were 'disproportionate' to the level of threat, as
there were no reports of protestors resorting to violence.

### AT: Sovereignty Ks

#### [Strategic reappropriation]{.underline} of sovereignty is an [essential part]{.underline} of decolonization.

**Reed, 14**---Vassar College (Kaitlin, "We Are Salmon People:
Constructing Yurok Sovereignty in the Klamath Basin,"
<https://digitalwindow.vassar.edu/senior_capstone/304/>, dml)

The problem of the political is also especially relevant in
understanding the construction of Yurok sovereignty broadly, and
resource conflict in the Klamath Basin more specifically. The concept of
[**sovereignty**, when used in an **indigenous context**, "signif\[ies\]
a **multiplicity of legal** and **social rights** to political,
economic, and cultural self-determination"]{.underline} (Barker 1).
[Sovereignty is portrayed by **both American** and **tribal
governments** as the **paved road toward autonomy** and
**self-determination**, a means of **economic prosperity** and the
ability to **enforce rights** over land, water and other
resources]{.underline} (Wilkinson, 2005: xiii). Indeed, [it is **rather
indisputable** that sovereignty, as a **discourse** and **mode of
pressing political claims**, has brought **tangible** and **material
benefits** to tribal communities]{.underline} (Barker 18; Alfred 39).
Yurok sovereignty is utilized as means to protect the Klamath River and
its salmon; as noted above, sovereignty frames the constitution and
exercise of authority, including authority over water.

Often portrayed as a stand-in attempting to represent all indigenous
rights (Barker 1), "[sovereignty as a discourse is unable to capture
fully the indigenous meanings, perspectives, and identities about law,
governance, and culture, and thus over time it impacts how those
epistemologies and perspectives are represented]{.underline}" (19). [The
continual (re)production of sovereignty holds the potential to
**permeate indigenous forms of governance** and thereby change the very
relation indigenous peoples hold with the land. This is particularly
pertinent for indigenous communities because relationships with the land
and resource stewardship are **fundamental components** of an indigenous
sovereignty]{.underline} (Tsosie 1302). Native peoples are tied to the
land in ways Western thinkers often cannot understand (Champagne 7;
Deloria, 1973: 1). The land itself is sacred; Native epistemologies and
worldviews are predicated on an ability to live and care for the land
they occupy (LaDuke, 2005: 189). [And thus, the **ability to protect the
vitality of natural resources** \-- understood as gifts from the Creator
\-- is **paramount** in the assertion of an indigenous
sovereignty]{.underline} (Fenelon 112).

With notions of land in mind, [the **processes of exclusion** and
**drawing boundaries become evident** in discourses of
sovereignty]{.underline}. Indeed,

One of the major problems in the indigenous sovereignty movement is that
its leaders must qualify and rationalize their goals by modifying the
sovereignty concept\...\[which\] itself implies a set of values and
objectives that put it in direct opposition to the values and objectives
found in most traditional indigenous philosophies. (Alfred 43).

Alfred is articulating constructions of epistemological boundaries
wherein indigenous relationships to land and resources are not
adequately represented within discourses of sovereignty. What is at
stake is not only our connection to the land, the very essence of
indigeneity, but the unique tribal identity defining indigenous peoples
since time immemorial. Indeed, [when "sovereignty \[is\] treated as
**unitary**, **pre-formed universals**"]{.underline} (Lindner 13), [it
aims to **standardize hundreds of very diverse groups** of indigenous
people]{.underline}. Alfred argues that "the actual history of our
plural existence has been erased by the narrow fictions of a single
sovereignty" (33). [And thus, it becomes **increasingly important** for
alternative narratives to be shared]{.underline}. The point, therefore,
is that \'Native American\' is not a unified body with a common
governance structures; nor should individual tribes be expected to
conform to structures of Western governance (Tsosie 1307).

[Western constructions of sovereignty, however, **can be** (and **have
been**) **resisted** and **refashioned** by indigenous
peoples]{.underline}. Indeed,

[\'Native sovereignty\' -- is founded on an ideology of **indigenous
nationalism** and a **rejection** of the models of government rooted in
European cultural values. It is an **uneven process** of reinstituting
systems that **promote the goals** and **reinforce the values** of
indigenous cultures]{.underline}, against the constant effort of the
Canadian and United States governments to maintain the systems of
dominance imposed on indigenous communities during the last century.
(Alfred 40)

Indeed, [though the '**colonial stench**' of sovereignty is
**problematic**, that is **not to say it cannot be a useful tool** for
indigenous peoples]{.underline}. Though the colonial term
['sovereignty']{.underline} is "incomplete, inaccurate, and
troubled\...it [has]{.underline}\...[been **rearticulated** to mean
something altogether by indigenous peoples]{.underline}" (Barker 26).
And what that something else means must always be tribally specific.

Essentially, [sovereignty in and of itself is a colonial tool.
But]{.underline} \-- like Native writers\' use of English in
storytelling \-- [can be **reappropriated** to represent another reality
altogether and utilized to reconstruct meaning]{.underline}. Indigenous
scholars have articulated the problematic origins of the term, yet also
the benefits it has brought. Simultaneously, however, [some scholars
**disown the concept** as an appropriate political
objective]{.underline}. And thus, it is helpful to examine Yurok notions
of sovereignty in the context of the political. [The]{.underline}
Yuroks\' **[entrance into a Western political framework]{.underline}**,
however, [**must not be read** as an **abandonment of culture** or
**traditional forms of governance**. Rather, the **construction** and
**assertion of**]{.underline} Yurok [**sovereignty** was in response to
the creation of an **unbalanced society**]{.underline} over the past
century \-- a society that depends upon environmental exploitation to
function. Yurok [sovereignty]{.underline}, therefore, [will be
understood]{.underline} in this context [as a means in which to
**negotiate with larger governing structures**; a means in which to
**legitimize sought after authority**; and]{.underline} ultimately, [one
of the **last remaining options available to protect**]{.underline}
their **[ways of life]{.underline}**. Ironically, [sovereignty will be
**essential** in the **larger decolonization project**]{.underline}
unfolding across the continent.
