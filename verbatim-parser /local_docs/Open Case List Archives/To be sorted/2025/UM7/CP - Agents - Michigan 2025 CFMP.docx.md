#### The Republic of India should propose a Critical Minerals Agreement with the United States of America, offering exports of rare Earth elements in exchange for assistance with developing its beach sand mining capabilities.

#### The CP solves---India has vast mineral reserves but their mining capabilities aren't developed---US technology and expertise allows India to become a global supplier of REEs.

China produces over 60 percent and refines over 90 percent of all rare
earth elements (REEs). Although REEs are not rare in nature, the
processing of REEs is concentrated in China, creating supply chain
risks. REEs are crucial for various technologies, including advanced
magnets, wind turbines, batteries, and drones. [[India has one of the
world's largest REE reserves]{.mark}, [as well as existing processing
capabilities that can be further developed. By cooperating on beach sand
mining]{.mark} (BSM) and processing, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[and India]{.mark} can [reduce]{.mark} their [reliance on China]{.mark},
[supporting both countries' strategic goals]{.mark}.]{.underline} This
can benefit both countries' REE supply chains. The collaboration should
focus on two areas: developing private processing and strengthening
environmental, social, and governance (ESG) frameworks. Beach Sand
Mining & Nuclear Energy [[India has rich sand deposits
containing]{.mark} monazite, which includes thorium and light
[REEs]{.mark} such as neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium.
Given the presence of thorium, which is a nuclear fuel, and India's
pursuit of thorium-based nuclear energy, the government regulates sand
mining, allowing limited private participation and exports.]{.underline}
The public sector undertaking "Indian Rare Earths Limited" (IREL) leads
thorium extraction with limited REE production but has recently
refocused on REEs. IREL plans to triple its REE production by 2032. The
United States seeks to diversify its REE supply chain from China.
[[India]{.mark} on the other hand, [has limited REE processing
capabilities]{.mark}, [but can move up the value chain if it invests in
advanced processing]{.mark}. This [presents a significant
opportunity]{.mark}.]{.underline} Developing Private Processing
Facilities The presence of thorium in India's beach sand means IREL, and
sand mining, is regulated by the Department of Atomic Energy (DAE).
Private companies were previously involved in BSM, but amid concerns
over illegal mining, in 2016, the Ministry of Mines introduced the
concept of permissible "threshold value" of monazite from mined
materials through the Atomic Mineral Concession Rules 2016. The rules
were amended in 2019, reducing the threshold value of monazite to 0.00
percent, effectively banning private BSM. The government has been
considering re-introducing privatization for BSM but this, however,
faces ESG concerns. As a de facto monopolist until then, IREL operates
several BSM projects. These projects produce thorium, and
REEs---primarily REE oxides, which are lower in supply chain value.
Facilitated by a Track 1 memorandum, IREL has partnered with Japan's
Toyota Tsusho Corporation. Toyota has set up an advanced processing
plant in Andhra Pradesh which has processed REEs since 2013. The
processed materials are exported to Japan, which sought alternatives
after China temporarily curtailed REE exports in 2010. With
[[IREL]{.mark} planning [to triple]{.mark} its [output by 2032]{.mark},
the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has]{.mark} an [opportunity to
secure strategic REE supply chains by supporting processing in
India]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[India]{.mark} [stands to gain]{.mark} by
getting [processing for its extracted REEs]{.mark} and moving up in the
supply value chain. The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [can
support]{.mark} an [American company]{.mark} in [forming a similar
partnership as Toyota through a Track 1 agreement]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Currently, the United States is diversifying its REE supply chains by
making investments in companies like MP Materials. [Since IREL is an
Indian government company and has no Chinese shareholding, it can be a
significant strategic partner.]{.underline} The U.S. government should
provide financial support to interested companies through organizations
such as the Development Finance Corporation (DFC) to derisk and enable
market entry. A critical minerals agreement (CMA) with India would
ensure that processing companies can supply the United States with
products compliant under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).
Environmental, Social, and Governance Mechanisms If done improperly, BSM
can have ESG implications, including habitat destruction and illegal
mining. This is what led to outlawing of private BSM in the first place.
Cognizant of this, the government has introduced several measures such
as the "Sand Mining Framework," "Coastal Regulation Zone" regulations,
and penalties. [The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [can support India
by sharing technology and expertise]{.mark}, [such as]{.mark} real-time
[environmental monitoring systems]{.mark} inspired by those employed by
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)]{.underline}. [This
collaboration can [ensure]{.mark} that [India's mining practices align
with global standards]{.mark}. [The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates can
[also]{.mark} [assist India in developing comprehensive frameworks like
the National Environmental Policy Act]{.mark} (NEPA), which mandates
detailed environmental impact assessments. These frameworks can include
stricter regulations to curb illegal mining and enhance supply chain
transparency and promote sustainable extraction.]{.underline}
Additionally, [joint ventures]{.underline} [can introduce cleaner
technologies like those encouraged under the U.S. Clean Air Act,
reducing emissions and waste. U.S. models of community engagement and
corporate social responsibility, like the "Community Right-to-Know"
provisions of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act
(EPCRA), can ensure community development. This includes strengthening
India's Districts Minerals Foundations frameworks to support healthcare,
education, and infrastructure. [Beach sand mining offers]{.mark} an
[opportunity for]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and India
to strengthen their partnership.]{.mark} By developing private
processing facilities and enhancing ESG frameworks, [the United States
and India can secure critical REE s]{.mark}upplies.]{.underline}

[The [nation's reliance on]{.mark} imported critical minerals and
[r]{.mark}are [e]{.mark}arth [e]{.mark}lement[s]{.mark} [from
China]{.mark} was [discussed]{.mark} [in 245 committee]{.mark} meetings
and mentioned in 95 reports [during the]{.mark} [118th
Congress]{.mark}'s 2022 and 2023 sessions]{.underline}, according to
Congress.Gov. [[When Congress adjourned]{.mark} on Dec. 20 with the
midnight passage of a continuing resolution to fund the government
through March, [it did so without adopting any]{.mark} of the 415
proposed [bills related to critical minerals]{.mark} as standalone
legislation over the last two years.]{.underline} While measures
bolstering supply chains and processing capacity for national defense
were incorporated into omnibus spending packages, such as the annual
National Defense Authorization Act, [[only a handful of critical mineral
bills]{.mark} were [vetted in committee]{.mark} and a rare [few]{.mark}
[presented for floor votes before dying]{.mark} unheard [in the other
chamber]{.mark}.]{.underline} Critical minerals are just one of many
issues where the 118th Congress left reams of unresolved legislation
languishing in its wake, a lame-duck body now in dissipating repose
before expiring when the 119th Congress convenes on Jan. 3. There were
19,304 measures introduced in 2023 and 2024 in the Senate and House,
with 399 adopted through Dec. 20, according to reviews of GovTrack.us
bill tracker and Congress.gov's Statutes At Large, which documents "all
laws and resolutions enacted during each session of Congress." The
19,304 introduced bills were the most since the 95th Congress put more
than 22,000 on the docket in 1977-78, according to GovTrack. The 399
adopted measures, meanwhile, is the fewest to pass both chambers since
at least 1973-74, which is as far back as Govtrack.us and Congress.gov
chart such statistics; 233 originated in the House, 157 in the Senate,
and nine were joint resolutions. Those 2023-24 adopted measures, which
"enacted 83 public laws," are less than a third of the 1,234 that were
passed in 2021-22 by the 117th Congress. Critical minerals are rare
earth elements that were a common topic in hearings the last few years
because, of the top 50 critical minerals defined by the United States
Geological Survey's (USGS's) November 2022 list, the United States can
only now domestically source a handful. These are minerals and elements
needed for electronics and national defense. For instance, nearly
three-quarters of the world's lithium is produced in Australia and
Chile; three-quarters of cobalt comes from the Congo; two-thirds of the
world's platinum from South Africa; and 90 percent of niobium from
Brazil. While raw critical minerals and ores can be found around the
world, including the United States, China-based companies dominate
processing them. China controls the global processing of at least 30
such minerals, according to a November 2023 report. The United States is
100 percent import-reliant on, for instance, yttrium, used in alloys,
radar microwave filters, and ethylene polymerization; rare earths used
in smart phones and cameras; bismuth and tungsten for metallurgy;
arsenic for semiconductors; barite for hydrocarbon production; antimony
used in batteries; germanium and gallium used in semiconductor chips and
fiber optics; and graphite used in batteries and lubricants. On Dec. 2,
the Biden administration expanded export controls on semiconductors and
manufacturing equipment to China, imposing restrictions on 24 types of
semiconductor manufacturing equipment, three software programs, and
high-bandwidth memory chips to entities related to Chinese semiconductor
manufacturing and investment companies. In response, China announced on
Dec. 3 that it was tightening restrictions on exporting minerals needed
for advanced semiconductors, essentially banning export of gallium,
germanium, and antimony to industries and companies linked to the United
States. The next day, it added graphite to the list. Stymied by
Definition Facing these trade war actions, Congress did little in its
waning days before adjourning to address economic and national defense
priorities it had deliberated the last two years. It left a parcel of
bills related to overall energy development on the table, including
measures that can streamlined the permitting process despite a
pan-industry, bipartisan rally cry. Most notably idling for more than a
year was HR 1, The Lower Energy Costs Act, essentially a blueprint for a
House GOP "drill baby drill" energy policy that the Democrat-led Senate
never heard in committee. The [proposed [Energy Permitting Reform
Act]{.mark} of 2024]{.underline}---co-sponsored by Sens. Joe Manchin
(I-W.Va.) and John Barrasso (R-Wyo.) and lauded by energy and mining
associations as a good first machete hack into the regulatory
thicket---[[died unheard]{.mark} in the House. A significant component
of hearings was dedicated to getting the Department of Energy (DOE) and
USGS on the same page in [defining]{.mark} what is a [critical
mineral]{.mark} and how the federal government should comprehensively
assess sources, supply chains, and end-uses in developing a
strategy.]{.underline} Among bills seeking to define critical minerals,
HB 8446, The Critical Mineral Consistency Act of 2024, advanced the
furthest. Sponsored by six Republicans led by Rep. Juan Ciscomani
(R-Ariz.), it amends The Energy Act of 2020 to require the Interior
secretary to submit an annual report comprehensively assessing all
global critical mineral and rare earth element resources and to
harmonize minerals definitions and listings used by the DOE and the
USGS. [It [spiraled]{.mark} [into]{.mark} boxed canyon
[partisanship]{.mark} by [including copper as a critical
mineral]{.mark}, which Democrats objected to as a "gift to the copper
industry and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP),"]{.underline} noting
Resolution Copper, owned by Rio Tinto, a global mining corporation, is
proposing a copper mine in New Mexico. "And guess who owns the largest
stake in Rio Tinto?" Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) asked. "The Chinese
government." HB 8446 was among the bills the House Rules Committee moved
to the floor on Nov. 12. The proposal passed the House on Nov. 14 in a
245-155 vote and was never heard in the Senate where the copper
inclusion nixed its passage. November Bred, December Dead [The House
Natural Resources Committee's Energy & Mineral Resources Subcommittee on
Nov. 19 advanced three critical minerals-related bills that were never
heard on the floor, including HR 7807,]{.underline} The
Intergovernmental Critical Minerals Task Force Act, sponsored by Rep.
Jay Obernolte (R-Calif.). The bill would establish an intergovernmental
critical minerals task force to "assess the reliance on the People's
Republic of China for critical minerals." It is similar to several other
bills attempting to lay the foundations for how the government will deal
with critical minerals that [never got to a floor vote.]{.underline}
Others include SB 3631, [The Critical Minerals Security Act of
2024]{.underline}, which would require reports on critical mineral and
rare earth element resources around the world and outline the
development of strategy for the development of advanced mining,
refining, separation, and processing technologies. Co-filed by six
sponsors led by Sens. John Cornyn (R-Texas) and Mark Warner (D-Va.), it
was adopted by the Senate on Nov. 19 and [never heard in the
House.]{.underline} Also advanced that same day by the House
subcommittee was SB 3631's companion bill, HB 7662, and HR 10005, "The
Expedited Appeals Review Act" (EARA), sponsored by Rep. Harriet Hageman
(R-Wyo.), which would have decluttered the Department of Interior's
Board of Land Appeal process that only saw 34 of 290 cases resolved "on
actual merits" in 2023 with just two decisions favoring appellants. The
backlog-building continued into December, with further deliberation of
new go-nowhere bills while those already heard pend expiry. On Dec. 11,
the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party's Critical
Minerals Policy Working Group on Dec. 11 adopted three more measures
aimed at mitigating China's dominance of the critical minerals and rare
earth supply chain. The bipartisan panel, led by Reps. Rob Wittman
(R-Va.) and Kathy Castor (D-Fla.), introduced the Earth Sciences and
Cooperation Enhancement Act of 2024, which would have appropriated \$3
million in authorizing the interior secretary to sign memoranda of
understanding (MOUs) with foreign governments to promote collaboration
on critical mineral supply chains. The working group endorsed a proposed
amendment to the Export Reform Control Act of 2018 co-sponsored by
Wittman and Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Mich.), which establishes export
controls on "black mass," a mixture of components in recycled
lithium-ion batteries, and "swarf," a byproduct of the metal machining
industry. It also advanced a proposed Critical Minerals Workforce
Enhancement Act, co-filed by Reps. John Moolenaar (R-Mich.) and Ritchie
Torres (D-N.Y.) which, among other provisions, amends the Immigration
and Nationality Act to allow those with critical minerals experience to
apply for a national interest waiver as part of their EB-2 visa
petition. Not only didn't these [December-filed [proposals]{.mark}
advance further, but they [weren't enumerated. If Congress wants to hear
these bills]{.mark}, and literally hundreds of others, again, [they will
need to be repackaged, re-numerated, and re-filed.]{.mark}]{.underline}
The good news is, after hundreds of hours of hearings and nearly 100
reports, many of these measures---the vast majority bipartisan---should
move quickly after the new Congress is seated.

[[Critical minerals]{.mark} are a [crucial part of the
India-]{.mark}United States ([US]{.mark}) [bilateral partnership]{.mark}
with developments such as the Initiative on Critical and Emerging
Technologies (iCET) and the signing of the recent (October 2024)
Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on critical minerals supply chains.
[The MoU]{.mark}, which is one of few examples of India's bilateral
cooperation on critical minerals. It [aims to leverage]{.mark} 'the two
[countries']{.mark} [complementary strengths to ensure]{.mark} greater
[resilience in the critical minerals sector']{.mark}. The India-US
partnership is increasingly focused on developing closer ties through
technology and clean energy cooperation in the critical minerals sector.
Some priority areas of the MoU therefore include 'identifying equipment,
services, policies, and best practices to facilitate the mutually
beneficial commercial development of US and Indian critical minerals'
along the global supply chains.]{.underline} Growing demand for a clean
energy transition is driving more countries to look for diversified
supply sources for critical minerals. In the race to power a green
economic future, critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, and rare earth
elements are essential resources driving the global shift to clean
energy, advanced technology, and defence innovation. Yet, the world
faces a stark reality: China controls 60% of global rare earth mining
and a staggering 80% of its processing capacity, creating an
overdependence on a single nation. Recently, trade war tensions
escalated between China and the US with the Biden administration's
crackdown on China's semiconductor industry. In retaliation[, [Beijing
banned exports of]{.mark} key [critical minerals]{.mark} to the US,
citing 'dual-use' concerns. This [highlights]{.mark} the [need to
diversify supply chains]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [reduce]{.mark}
[reliance]{.mark} on a single dominant supplier. As the second and third
highest emitters global CO₂, both the United States (13%) and India (8%)
are rapidly moving towards ensuring a green energy
transition]{.underline}. For India, with its ambitious target of
achieving 500 GW of renewable energy capacity by 2030 and electrifying
30% of its vehicles, the stakes couldn't be higher. [Meanwhile, the
[US,]{.mark} [with over \$17 million in investments]{.mark} to secure
critical mineral supply chains, is [ramping up efforts to counter
China's]{.mark} quasi-[monopoly]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is where an
[[India-US partnership]{.mark} becomes not merely beneficial but a
[strategic imperative]{.mark}. The [two nations]{.mark} can
[build]{.mark} a resilient and [diversified supply chain for critical
minerals]{.mark}. [India's]{.mark} ambition to become a global
[manufacturing]{.mark} hub is [advancing rapidly]{.mark}, driven by its
renewable energy goals. Meanwhile, the [U.S. brings]{.mark}
[tech]{.mark}nological expertise [and]{.mark} significant [financial
resources]{.mark} to the table. These strengths [create]{.mark} the
[foundation]{.mark} [for]{.mark} a strong and [mutually beneficial
partnership.]{.mark} Together, they can secure their energy transitions,
boost bilateral trade (already at a record \$191 billion in 2022), and
create a powerful counterweight to China.]{.underline} Together, they
can secure their energy transitions, boost bilateral trade (already at a
record \$191 billion in 2022), and create a powerful counterweight to
China. The question, therefore, is less about *why* India and the US
should partner on critical minerals---and more about finding ways of
*how* they can turn this opportunity into a transformative partnership.
After outlining the history of the India-US partnership, this article
goes into laying out [why the [two]{.mark} [should collaborate]{.mark}
[in the]{.mark} critical minerals [sector]{.mark}, highlighting the [80%
overlap between]{.mark} the lists of [minerals]{.mark} for both
countries. It discusses how critical minerals cooperation is and can be
further embedded into the climate and energy partnership. It also gives
some policy options to enhance collaboration in the sector.]{.underline}
Growing role of energy, tech and trade nexus in the India-US partnership
[[Critical minerals]{.mark} have emerged as [a cornerstone of]{.mark}
the growing [India-US partnership]{.mark}, strengthening their energy,
technology, and trade linkages]{.underline}. As India's External Affairs
Minister highlighted, both countries "value the strides we are making in
our tech collaboration and economic partnership". [This [bilateral
relationship]{.mark} is [founded on shared interests]{.mark}, democratic
values, strategic alignment, and economic potential, [evolv]{.mark}ing
[into a robust partnership]{.mark} over three decades.]{.underline}
Chietigj Bajpaee identifies three pillars: shared democratic values,
countering China, and India's economic growth. [India's growing economy,
projected to be the third largest by 2030, aligns with US
'friendshoring' strategies to reduce reliance on China. Shared goals
include building resilient supply chains, expanding collaboration in
emerging technologies like clean energy, semiconductors, and critical
minerals, and tapping into India's digital and information technology
(IT) strengths. Despite challenges like infrastructure and
protectionism, [India's]{.mark} [aspirations]{.mark} as a manufacturing
hub [complement US interests]{.mark}, further strengthening this vital
partnership. India's growing influence in critical and emerging
technologies also creates opportunities for collaboration with the US,
particularly in high-value sectors like clean energy, semiconductors,
and critical minerals.]{.underline} India's growing influence in
critical and emerging technologies also creates opportunities for
collaboration with the US, particularly in high-value sectors like clean
energy, semiconductors, and critical minerals. India and the US have
witnessed a rapid evolution in their collaboration on energy, climate,
and technology, driven by a convergence of strategic interests and
shared global challenges. Key initiatives such as the U.S.-India Climate
and Clean Energy Agenda 2030 Partnership and the Strategic Clean Energy
Partnership (SCEP) reflect the growing alignment between the two nations
on energy security and climate resilience. These frameworks emphasise
joint efforts in clean energy innovation, decarbonisation technologies,
and sustainable infrastructure, positioning the partnership as a
critical pillar of bilateral cooperation. As both countries seek to
mitigate supply chain vulnerabilities and reduce dependency on China for
critical resources, this collaboration underscores the geopolitical
importance of resilient, diversified supply chains in an increasingly
multipolar world order. A [significant development reinforcing this
trajectory is the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies
([iCET]{.mark}), launched in 2023. Designed to deepen bilateral ties in
semiconductors, artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and critical
minerals, iCET illustrates how technology-driven collaboration is
central to ensuring economic security and strategic autonomy. [By
focusing on critical minerals]{.mark}, the [initiative]{.mark} plays a
[vital]{.mark} role [in enhancing supply chain resilience]{.mark} and
fostering joint research and development efforts.]{.underline} As the
geopolitical landscape continues to shift, India and the US are
well-positioned to leverage these growing areas of cooperation to
enhance their influence in critical sectors shaping the 21st-century
global economy. [By aligning their priorities in critical mineral
development, both nations are strengthening the foundation of their
partnership and advancing shared goals in energy security, technological
innovation, and economic growth.]{.underline} Expanding India-US
Collaboration on Critical Minerals [The [partnership]{.mark} between
India and the United States [on critical minerals]{.mark} has evolved
significantly, [underscor]{.mark}ing the [importance of international
coop]{.mark}eration in securing resilient supply chains. Despite shared
ambitions for self-reliance, both countries have recognised that
collaboration, not isolation, offers the best path to meeting the rising
global demand for these strategic resources.]{.underline} There are four
factors driving India-US cooperation on critical minerals: ([1)
America's deepening international partnerships in this sector, (2) the
80% overlap between the critical minerals identified by India and the
US, (3) the shared history of India-US clean energy partnerships, and
(4) the developing national security and technology collaborations
between the two partners.]{.underline} American policy thinking on
critical minerals can be seen to develop after the 2010 Chinese export
ban on Japan of crucial minerals needed for semiconductors and
automobiles over maritime disputes. The 2010 incident can be considered
the lynchpin that set off the strategic thinking and highlighted the
policy need for ensuring reliable and secure access to critical
minerals. Policy development picked up more wind as the need for
critical minerals became more apparent as did concerns over Chinese
monopoly of supply chains. America has significantly focused on
developing its domestic capacity on mineral mapping, mining, and
processing. While much of the developments have focused on ensuring
domestic capacity and stockpiling of critical minerals, at the same
time, the US has also been on the front foot in recognising the
significance of international cooperation for critical minerals (see
Table 2). Not only has it inked various bilateral partnerships (e.g.
Canada, Australia, Japan, South Korea, and India), the US has also been
the shaping international cooperation frameworks such as the Minerals
Security Partnership. Out of the 50 critical minerals identified by the
US in its list of critical minerals (2022), 40 of them overlap (see
Figure 1) with India's list of critical minerals (2023). There is an 80%
overlap between minerals identified by both countries showcasing
potential for cooperation, especially in third geographies such as
Africa. This is because many of the minerals identified are Platinum
Group Metals or Rare Earth Elements (REEs), which are geographically
located in Africa. India also has deposits of various REEs such as
thorium and light REEs such as neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and
terbium. International collaborations, such as the one between Indian
Rare Earth Limited (IREL) and Toyotsu Rare Earth India Limited
(subsidiary of Toyoto Tsusho Corporation, Japan), has significant
potential for India and the US to further strengthen collaboration for
mutual benefit. Figure 1: Common minerals between India and US list of
critical minerals (also see Table 3 in Annex) \[Image Omitted\] [The US
and India have a long history of collaboration on clean energy and
climate projects, built on shared goals of energy security, sustainable
development, and combating climate change (see Table 1). This
[established synergy]{.mark} in clean energy [provides]{.mark} a strong
[foundation]{.mark} [for deeper collaboration on critical
minerals]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} As the building blocks for clean
technologies like solar panels, electric vehicles, and semiconductors,
critical minerals are essential to achieving net-zero targets. [This is
reflected in the India-U.S. MoU on Critical Minerals Supply Chains
(2024) and the India-US Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technologies
(iCET). As well as through joint initiatives under the Minerals Security
Partnership (MSP) such as the MSP Finance Network and Quad Principles on
Clean Energy Supply Chains. With their shared experience in clean energy
cooperation, strong bilateral frameworks, and complementary
capabilities, the US and India are well-positioned to become strategic
partners in ensuring global critical mineral security.]{.underline}

On October 3, [the [United States and India]{.mark} [announced]{.mark} a
[major agreement in]{.mark} one of the [priority sector]{.mark}s [for
both countries -- critical minerals]{.mark} supply chain cooperation.
The [two sides vowed to "expand and diversify" supply]{.mark} [routes
and leverage complementary strengths]{.mark}. The latest
[agreement]{.mark} [underscores India's potential as a major partner in
the U.S.-led efforts to diversify]{.mark} away [from China-controlled
mineral s]{.mark}upply chains.]{.underline} Out of the expansive list of
critical minerals, the two sides are exploring deeper collaboration in
the Rare Earth Elements (REEs) sector, where Beijing currently enjoys a
near-global monopoly. In the wider U.S.-China geopolitical competition,
rare earths have emerged as a critical choke point due to their use in
military applications and Beijing's willingness to use its dominance to
restrict access for political and strategic gains. The [Indian
government should focus on the twin goals of mining and processing of
rare earths by building domestic capacity through international
partnerships to raise the country's share in a diversified and secure
supply chain.]{.underline} With the world's fifth-largest reserves of
rare earths, India could play a crucial role in reducing global
overdependence on China and building a stable and diversified supply
chain. However, at the moment, the country lags in all stages of rare
earth development -- mining, processing, refining, and magnet
production. It also faces multiple challenges such as a lack of private
capital, technology access, and environmental concerns. To change
course, the Indian government has attempted to streamline laws,
encourage private investment, and foster bilateral and multilateral
partnerships. However, the ambitious strategy that aims to
simultaneously address the entire lifecycle of rare earths exploration
and use requires a prioritization of objectives. Instead, the Indian
government should focus on the twin goals of mining and processing of
rare earths by building domestic capacity through international
partnerships to raise the country's share in a diversified and secure
supply chain. All Rare Earth Roads Go Through China Rare earths comprise
17 minerals that are abundant in the earth's crust. However, these
rarely occur in concentrated form and generally have mixed deposits of
iron, phosphate, copper, and gold. In India, rare earths are primarily
found in beach sand deposits mixed with monazite, in states such as
Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh. REEs are deployed in a variety of
critical sectors like defense, electronics, clean energy technologies,
and electric vehicles. In military systems, they are used in jet
engines, fighter jets, submarines, missile guidance systems, satellites,
and GPS equipment. While China possesses over one-third of the world's
reserves, the country effectively controls upstream, midstream and
downstream sectors. Though its production share is close to 70 percent,
it has over 85 percent share of the processing and around 90 percent of
the share for key finished products like permanent magnets.
[[The]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates is [dependent on China
for]{.mark} over [70 percent of its rare earth
consumption]{.mark}]{.underline}. For the EU, reliance on China for
certain minerals is close to 100 percent. Despite their national
security significance, Western governments and companies have struggled
to escape China's orbit of rare earths. This concentration of rare earth
power has provided Beijing a political weapon that it wields quite
often. For instance, in 2010, China was accused of blocking rare earth
exports to Japan for two months in retaliation for Tokyo arresting the
captain of a Chinese fishing trawler near disputed islands. In December
last year, Beijing announced a series of technology export bans related
to mining, processing, and manufacturing of magnets on national security
grounds. Beijing's dominance in rare earths and its ability to cut off
access to these minerals that are used in strategic sectors have
triggered policy responses from the United States, European Union, and
Japan, resulting in several bilateral and multilateral agreements to
reduce their reliance on China. India, too, has amended its mining laws
and released a list of 30 critical minerals that it will prioritize for
domestic mining and overseas access, which includes rare earths. New
Delhi is also part of the 15-member group called the Minerals Security
Partnership, an informal organization of largely rich nations to
coordinate efforts on mineral diversification. India has also announced
bilateral agreements with countries such as the United States and
Australia. While these are welcome moves, significant challenges in
India's ability to exploit its reserves remain. Rare Earths, Complex
Challenges Despite having around six percent of the world's reserves,
India produces less than one percent of the total share of rare earths.
This is partly because a state-owned entity, the Indian Rare Earth
Limited (IREL), has an effective monopoly on production, partly due to a
ban on beach sand mining in 2019 due to rampant illegal activity. Since
then, the government has approved only a selected list of private
exploration companies to enter the rare earth market. There are a
handful of separation and refining facilities, the most notable being
the joint venture between IREL and Japan's Toyota Tsusho Corporation in
the state of Andhra Pradesh. The downstream industries, such as
alloy-making and magnets, are non-existent. Like other countries, India
too heavily relies on China, with nearly 60 percent of the total imports
of rare earths sourced from Beijing. The Indian rare earth domestic
industry faces several challenges such as lack of private capital,
technical know-how, and environmental implications. The extended
monopoly of IREL has dissuaded private sector participation and the
government's recent steps have not moved the needle much. Lack of
technical expertise is a perennial challenge that has hindered the
development of midstream capacity in the country. As rare earth mining
and processing require large amounts of energy, and generate high
quantities of toxic waste and radiation, protecting the environment
while increasing the capacity remains tricky. Charting Pathways to
Success To develop its rare earth capabilities and contribute
meaningfully to the global supply chain, the Indian government should
first prioritize its objectives for the sector. Instead of attempting to
build an entire ecosystem with all stages of production, the focus could
be on leveraging the country's resources by expanding mining and
processing. India already has a limited mining and processing capacity
that could be scaled up through infusion of private capital and
technology, utilizing bilateral and multilateral collaborations to do
so. [[India]{.mark} should [look no further than]{.mark} its Quad
partners -- the [United States,]{.mark}]{.underline} Australia, and
Japan, who could each play a big role in resolving both financial and
technological hurdles. For example, the [[latest bilateral Memorandum of
Understanding]{.mark} (MoU) [with Washington]{.mark} is [a step in the
right direction]{.mark}, as it [mentions priority areas such as]{.mark}
["identifying equipment]{.mark}, [services, policies and best practices
to facilitate commercial development" of both]{.mark} the [U.S. and
Indian mineral sectors]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [[two countries]{.mark}
are also [discussing]{.mark} critical [mineral diversification
efforts]{.mark} [under]{.mark} the U.S.-India initiative on Critical and
Emerging Technology [(iCET).]{.mark}]{.underline} [[The United
States]{.mark}, which is the second-biggest miner of rare earths after
China, [sees an opportunity for India to scale up]{.mark} its
[processing]{.mark} sector [and]{.mark} is [ready to support]{.mark} its
[development]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Bilateral initiatives
provide]{.mark} an [opportunity for India to encourage U.S. private
investments and technology transfers]{.mark}.]{.underline} Similarly,
India's existing partnership with Australia on critical minerals should
be expanded to include rare earths. Australia, the fourth-biggest rare
earth producer in the world, has the technological edge and experience
to assist India in spurring private investment and transfer of
commercial-scale proven technologies. Japan, too, is a valuable partner.
After the 2010 Chinese embargo, Tokyo went on a war footing to reduce
its rare earth reliance on China from 90 percent to 58. A major part of
the campaign was to secure overseas deposits via huge financial
infusion, along with technical and technological assistance led by its
one-stop-shop government agency -- Japan Organization for Metals and
Energy Security (JOGMEC). The existing Japanese tie-up with IREL could
be a guiding light for sharing best practices, technical know-how, and
future Japanese investments in this sector in India. To develop its rare
earth capabilities and contribute meaningfully to the global supply
chain, the Indian government should first prioritize its objectives for
the sector \[...\] the focus could be on leveraging the country's
resources by expanding mining and processing. India's membership in the
Minerals Security Partnership could also provide New Delhi with a
platform to advance its domestic interests by attracting private capital
and expertise. Similarly, India can make use of the Quad framework,
which already focuses on critical minerals, to coordinate its rare earth
priorities with member states. This would ensure a targeted approach and
enhance efficiency. Finally, [bilateral]{.underline} and multilateral
engagements should be complemented by streamlining domestic regulations,
intensifying state-led investments in R&D, especially in the processing
sector, and promoting private investment in mining and processing with
adequate environmental safeguards. The Modi government at the center
should also reach out to the states to align its objectives with their
priorities and ensure an investor-friendly ecosystem. While blessed with
rare earth endowments, [[India]{.underline}]{.mark} faces multiple
challenges in becoming a crucial player in the rare earth industry.
However, it [[has]{.mark} the [potential to become a significant
mining]{.mark} and processing [source in]{.mark} the global [rare earth
supply chains,]{.mark} while [achieving its stated objective of
self-reliance]{.mark} in one of the most critical strategic
sectors.]{.underline} If not done right, India's dependence on China for
rare earths could prove costly in a future contingency. [The global call
to develop diversified supply chains has put India on the map. With
existing support from international partners and friends, the time is
now for India to move and move fast.]{.underline}

[[India]{.mark}, like many countries, is [grappling with Beijing's
restrictions on]{.mark} rare earth element ([REE]{.mark})
[exports]{.mark} --- and [it wants to develop its own]{.mark} domestic
[supplies]{.mark}. Experts say [it could become an]{.mark} important
[alternative to China]{.mark} in the sector, but will require much more
public and private investment. In recent weeks, the world has been
facing a rare earths shortage in light of curbs from China]{.underline}.
Auto manufacturers across India, the U.S., Japan, South Korea and
Germany have been affected. [In response, [Indian officials]{.mark} are
[evaluating]{.mark} [how]{.mark} [Indian Rare Earths]{.mark} (IREL), a
government-owned company, [can be leveraged to increase REE
production]{.mark}]{.underline}, sources told CNBC-TV18. The report
comes just days after [[India's]{.mark} [Union Minister of Commerce and
Industry]{.mark} Piyush Goyal [called]{.mark} [China's]{.mark} [pause in
exports]{.mark} of rare earth elements [a "wake-up call]{.mark}" for the
world and an [opportunity for India to provide an
alternative.]{.mark}]{.underline} Geoffrey Pyatt, senior managing
director of critical minerals at McLarty Associates and former U.S.
assistant secretary of state for energy resources from 2022 to 2025,
echoed the commerce minister's statements. ["This is both a wake-up call
and [an opportunity]{.mark} for us [to deepen U.S.-India collaboration
on an issue important to future economic competitiveness]{.mark}," he
told CNBC.]{.underline} China's dominance Beijing recently signaled
plans to ease controls, and U.S. President Donald Trump has said that a
trade deal with China that includes a resolution on rare earths is
"done." But China's control of rare earth exports was not a new policy,
with gradual restrictions of international sales occurring over the past
two years. The recent shortage has further highlighted the country's
dominant position in REEs: It produces roughly 60% of the world's supply
and processes almost 90%, which includes materials imported from other
countries. That gives Beijing considerable leverage over a supply of
minerals crucial for various modern technologies, including robotics,
clean energy, batteries and military equipment. India's potential It's
important to note, however, that [[rare earths are not rare in
nature]{.underline}]{.mark}. While China has the largest deposits of
REEs at 44 million tons[, [India]{.mark} also [has]{.mark} a substantial
amount at [6.9 million tons,]{.mark} according to the U.S. Geological
Survey. That gives it the [world's third-largest
share]{.mark}]{.underline} of reserves behind that of Brazil, as per the
agency's records. [India [also has]{.mark} nearly [35% of the world's
beach and sand mineral deposits]{.mark}, which are [significant sources
of]{.mark} important [rare earths]{.mark}]{.underline}, according to a
recent report from EY. Given those considerable reserves,
[[India]{.mark} is "[poised]{.mark} [to play a key role in
building]{.mark} a [more diversified global rare earths supply
chain]{.mark},"]{.underline} Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical
Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, told CNBC. However, in order to use REE reserves, countries
need the ability to mine and extract raw materials, as well as the
capacity and technology to process and refine them for final use. [[So
far]{.mark}, [India]{.mark} is [lacking in a]{.mark}dvanced [separation
and refining tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}, especially compared with
China, the U.S. and Japan, said Abhijit Kulkarni, partner at EY
Parthenon, noting that India so far contributes less than 1% of global
REE production. Other challenges India faces is a lack of specialized
technical expertise in REE mining and processing as well as poor
infrastructure in India's mining regions, he added. [As part of efforts
[to change that, India launched the National Critical Mineral
Mission]{.mark} in 2025. The initiative [aims to develop an effective
framework for REE self-reliance]{.mark} in the face of China's
restrictions and other threats posed to the geographically concentrated
supply chain.]{.underline} Sources told CNBC-TV18 [the [Indian
government]{.mark} is [also considering private sector collaboration
with IREL]{.mark}]{.underline}. Among the options being considered are
government incentive schemes and capital subsidies aimed at encouraging
local mining and processing. According to Kulkarni, a lack of private
sector participation in India's REE space, in particular, has stifled
innovation and scalability. [[Working in its favor]{.mark}, however, is
[booming domestic demand across technology sectors]{.mark} including
electric vehicles, electronics and defense.]{.underline} "[This dual
factor makes India both a potential supplier and consumer]{.underline},
[which [encourages]{.mark} government and industry [investment into
building domestic capabilities]{.mark},"]{.underline} he said.
[[India]{.mark} is [already in the process of completing several
domestic REE projects, including]{.mark} a [IREL rare earths magnet
plant. "India]{.mark}]{.underline} will not be able to replace China's
position in the market, but it [[can]{.mark} certainly [play an
important role in providing]{.mark} a [new source of rare
earths]{.mark},"]{.underline} CSIS' Baskaran said. In the meantime,
Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal said India is also searching
for alternative REE sources outside China. A delegation of Indian auto
industry representatives is also gearing up for a China visit in an
attempt to expedite their imports of rare earth magnets, according to
local reports citing industry sources.

Why in the News? [[India-U.S. ties]{.mark}, [once seen as]{.mark} strong

deal-based [diplomacy]{.mark} [contrasts with India's strategic]{.mark}
and civilisational [outlook]{.mark}, causing mistrust]{.underline}. Eg:
Trump's unpredictable style --- praising one day, criticising the next
--- makes it difficult for India to navigate the partnership
confidently. Return of "India-Pakistan Hyphenation": The revival of
outdated strategic equivalence between India and Pakistan has offended
Indian diplomatic efforts to de-hyphenate its rise. Eg: Trump's offer to
mediate on Kashmir post-Operation Sindoor and remarks equating both
nations reignited diplomatic concerns in New Delhi. [[Contradictory
Economic]{.mark} and Strategic [Signals]{.mark}]{.underline}: Despite

with India's]{.mark} China-plus-one strategy and [investment
goals]{.mark}.]{.underline} What key factors are straining India-U.S.
ties under the Trump administration? Revival of India-Pakistan
Equivalence: The U.S. has reverted to "hyphenating" India and Pakistan
as strategic concerns, undermining India's diplomatic efforts to
decouple its rise. Eg: Trump's comments post-Operation
Sindoor---offering mediation on Kashmir and warning of nuclear
escalation---were seen as diplomatically regressive. Economic Mixed
Signals: [The [Trump administration sent conflicting signals on India's
role in global supply chains]{.mark}, affecting investor
confidence.]{.underline} Eg: Trump reportedly discouraged Apple from
expanding manufacturing in India, undermining India's China-plus-one
strategy. Restrictive Immigration Stance: The H-1B visa policy, critical
to U.S.-India tech ties, has become vulnerable to protectionist rhetoric
and political posturing. Eg: Curtailing H-1B visas strains the Silicon
Valley--India innovation ecosystem, weakening a pillar of bilateral
cooperation. How can India manage uncertainties in its U.S. engagement
strategy? [**[Pursue]{.mark} Calibrated and [Persistent]{.mark}
[Diplomacy]{.mark}**: [India must]{.mark} [avoid]{.mark}
[overreaction]{.mark} [and focus on]{.mark} quiet, [sustained engagement
to preserve strategic alignment. Eg]{.mark}: [Continued cooperation in
defence]{.mark}, Quad, [and intelligence sharing]{.mark} [can reinforce
long-term trust]{.mark} despite short-term irritants. Broaden Strategic
Outreach in the U.S: India should strengthen its influence beyond
traditional diplomacy by engaging Congress, think tanks, and the
Indian-American diaspora.]{.underline} Eg: Leveraging support from
Indian-origin U.S. lawmakers helps build bipartisan consensus for
stronger ties. Accelerate Domestic Economic Reforms: India must boost
its manufacturing, regulatory clarity, and infrastructure to reinforce
its attractiveness as a global partner. Eg: Advancing Make in India and
supply chain resilience makes India indispensable to U.S. Indo-Pacific
strategy. Why does the U.S. tilt towards Pakistan concern India's
strategic interests? Revival of India-Pakistan Diplomatic Parity
(Hyphenation): By treating India and Pakistan as strategic equals, the
U.S. threatens to undo India's efforts to decouple its global risefrom
the South Asian rivalry. Eg: Trump's offer to mediate in Kashmir and
mention of India and Pakistan in the same context post-Operation Sindoor
reflect regressive diplomacy. What steps must India and the U.S. take to
revive their strategic partnership? (Way forward) Strengthen
Institutional and People-to-People Engagement: Both countries must go
beyond government-to-government ties and deepen connections through
think tanks, academia, diaspora, and legislative forums. Eg: India
leveraging the Indian-American diaspora and policy institutions in
Washington can build long-term bipartisan support. Reframe Economic and
Immigration Cooperation: Economic reforms in India and predictable
immigration policies in the U.S. can boost mutual trust in trade and
talent exchange. Eg: Reframing the H-1B visa regime as a tool for mutual
innovation rather than political leverage strengthens tech cooperation.
Reinforce Shared Strategic Values and Regional Vision: [[India

recovery of the outstanding loans which included selling personal
properties of the promoters which were in an advanced stage.

The Tribunal perused the facts and came to the conclusion that the
admitted position of the debtor is that the personal properties have
been given as a \"Security\" to the banks which clearly implies that the
properties are currently not under the ownership of the Corporate
Debtor. In that regard, to ascertain that whether the properties which
are not owned by a Corporate Debtor will come within the ambits of the
Moratorium or not, the Tribunal examined Section 14 (c) of the Code and
observed that the canon of interpretation is a very important tool for
gauging the intention of the legislature and language of the Statute is
such that no word can be added, or substituted or deleted from the
enacted Code, thereby [the term \"its\"]{.underline} in the
aforementioned section becomes very important because on a plain reading
of the section it is understood that on the commencement of the
Insolvency Process, the Moratorium shall be declared for prohibiting any
action to recover or enforce any security interest created by the
Corporate Debtor in respect of its property, the [usage of the word
[\"its\"]{.mark} clearly [makes a distinction between the property owned
by the]{.mark} Corporate [Debtor and **other** properties]{.mark},
[which means that the Moratorium will have **no application on the
properties beyond the ownership** of the]{.mark} Corporate
[Debtor]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this case, since the property in
question was given as security to the bank, the moratorium would not
apply on the personal properties.

[The legal question to be resolved by the court is whether the word

be deemed a ruling *in praesenti*]{.underline}.14 The answer to this
query is not to be divined from rules of grammar;15 it must be governed
by the age-old practice culture of legal professionals and its
immemorial language usage. To determine if the omission (from the
critical May 18 entry) of the turgid phrase, \"and the same hereby is\",
(1) makes it an in futuro ruling - i.e., an expression of what the judge
will or would do at a later stage - or (2) constitutes an in in
praesenti resolution of a disputed law issue, the trial judge\'s intent
must be garnered from the four corners of the entire record.16

Why in the News? [[India-U.S. ties]{.mark}, [once seen as]{.mark} strong
and [promising]{.mark}, [now face a]{.mark} quiet
[shift]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Recent U.S.]{.mark} actions like engaging
Pakistan's military and [economic warnings]{.mark} to India have [caused
concern]{.mark} [in Delhi]{.mark}.]{.underline} Why does the India-U.S.
relationship face a strategic drift despite deep convergence?
Transactional Approach Undermines Long-term Trust: [The [Trump
admin]{.mark}istration['s]{.mark} [focus on short-term]{.mark},
deal-based [diplomacy]{.mark} [contrasts with India's strategic]{.mark}
and civilisational [outlook]{.mark}, causing mistrust]{.underline}. Eg:
Trump's unpredictable style --- praising one day, criticising the next
--- makes it difficult for India to navigate the partnership
confidently. Return of "India-Pakistan Hyphenation": The revival of
outdated strategic equivalence between India and Pakistan has offended
Indian diplomatic efforts to de-hyphenate its rise. Eg: Trump's offer to
mediate on Kashmir post-Operation Sindoor and remarks equating both
nations reignited diplomatic concerns in New Delhi. [[Contradictory
Economic]{.mark} and Strategic [Signals]{.mark}]{.underline}: Despite
promoting Indo-Pacific cooperation[[, U.S. actions]{.mark} have
[undermine]{.mark}d [India's]{.mark} [manufacturing ambitions]{.mark}

[discouraged]{.mark} [Apple from expanding in India]{.mark}, [clashing
with India's]{.mark} China-plus-one strategy and [investment
goals]{.mark}.]{.underline} What key factors are straining India-U.S.
ties under the Trump administration? Revival of India-Pakistan
Equivalence: The U.S. has reverted to "hyphenating" India and Pakistan
as strategic concerns, undermining India's diplomatic efforts to
decouple its rise. Eg: Trump's comments post-Operation
Sindoor---offering mediation on Kashmir and warning of nuclear
escalation---were seen as diplomatically regressive. Economic Mixed
Signals: [The [Trump administration sent conflicting signals on India's
role in global supply chains]{.mark}, affecting investor
confidence.]{.underline} Eg: Trump reportedly discouraged Apple from
expanding manufacturing in India, undermining India's China-plus-one
strategy. Restrictive Immigration Stance: The H-1B visa policy, critical
to U.S.-India tech ties, has become vulnerable to protectionist rhetoric
and political posturing. Eg: Curtailing H-1B visas strains the Silicon
Valley--India innovation ecosystem, weakening a pillar of bilateral
cooperation. How can India manage uncertainties in its U.S. engagement
strategy? [**[Pursue]{.mark} Calibrated and [Persistent]{.mark}
[Diplomacy]{.mark}**: [India must]{.mark} [avoid]{.mark}

Outreach in the U.S: India should strengthen its influence beyond
traditional diplomacy by engaging Congress, think tanks, and the
Indian-American diaspora.]{.underline} Eg: Leveraging support from
Indian-origin U.S. lawmakers helps build bipartisan consensus for
stronger ties. Accelerate Domestic Economic Reforms: India must boost
its manufacturing, regulatory clarity, and infrastructure to reinforce
its attractiveness as a global partner. Eg: Advancing Make in India and
supply chain resilience makes India indispensable to U.S. Indo-Pacific
strategy. Why does the U.S. tilt towards Pakistan concern India's
strategic interests? Revival of India-Pakistan Diplomatic Parity
(Hyphenation): By treating India and Pakistan as strategic equals, the
U.S. threatens to undo India's efforts to decouple its global risefrom
the South Asian rivalry. Eg: Trump's offer to mediate in Kashmir and
mention of India and Pakistan in the same context post-Operation Sindoor
reflect regressive diplomacy. What steps must India and the U.S. take to
revive their strategic partnership? (Way forward) Strengthen
Institutional and People-to-People Engagement: Both countries must go
beyond government-to-government ties and deepen connections through
think tanks, academia, diaspora, and legislative forums. Eg: India
leveraging the Indian-American diaspora and policy institutions in
Washington can build long-term bipartisan support. Reframe Economic and
Immigration Cooperation: Economic reforms in India and predictable
immigration policies in the U.S. can boost mutual trust in trade and
talent exchange. Eg: Reframing the H-1B visa regime as a tool for mutual
innovation rather than political leverage strengthens tech cooperation.
Reinforce Shared Strategic Values and Regional Vision: [[India
and]{.mark} the [U.S.]{.mark} [must revive]{.mark} the moral and
strategic purpose of [their partnership]{.mark} --- [promoting a
rules-based, democratic]{.mark}, Indo-Pacific [order. Eg: Joint

ONBM

[On March 28, [2023]{.mark}, the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and
Japan]{.mark} [entered]{.mark} [into a bilateral agreement]{.mark},
titled the Agreement Between the Government of the United States of
America and the Government of Japan on [Strengthening Critical Minerals
Supply Chains]{.mark}]{.underline} ("U.S.-Japan Critical Minerals
Agreement" or "Agreement"). Context and Significance of the U.S.-Japan
Critical Minerals Agreement Prompting this agreement were concerns
surrounding the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 ("IRA") and the
applicability of tax credits to electric vehicles ("EVs") for which
battery minerals are processed in Japan. As discussed, the IRA amended
the consumer EV tax credit, which requires that 40 to 80 percent of the
value of the critical minerals in a vehicle's battery be extracted or
processed in the United States or in a country with which the United
States has a free trade agreement ("FTA") in effect or be recycled in
North America. A number of U.S. trading partners do not have a free
trade agreement with the United States and have expressed concerns about
the IRA's FTA requirement. The EV industry has similarly expressed
concerns that there is an insufficient supply of minerals from FTA
partner countries. In the recent proposed regulations on the new clean
vehicle credit under the IRA, Treasury interprets the term "free trade
agreement" broadly to include agreements that meet certain criteria,
even where such agreements are more limited in scope compared to
traditional, comprehensive free trade agreements. Those criteria
include: whether an agreement between the United States and another
country, as to the critical minerals contained in electric vehicle
batteries or more generally, and in the context of the overall
commercial and economic relationship between that country and the United
States: (A) reduces or eliminates trade barriers on a preferential
basis; (B) commits the parties to refrain from imposing new trade
barriers; (C) establishes high-standard disciplines in key areas
affecting trade (such as core labor and environmental protections);
and/or (D) reduces or eliminates restrictions on exports or commits the
parties to refrain from imposing such restrictions. In other words, the
proposed regulations would define FTA countries to include not only
trading partners with which the United States "has comprehensive free
trade agreements (that is, agreements covering substantially all trade
in goods and services between the parties, including trade in critical
minerals),"\[1\] but also countries that meet the above criteria with
respect to "the critical minerals contained in electric vehicle
batteries." Noting that the term free trade agreement is not defined in
the IRA or in the Internal Revenue Code, Treasury explains that the
proposed definition, consistent with the goals of the IRA, "expands the
incentives for taxpayers to purchase new clean vehicles and for vehicle
manufacturers to increase their reliance on supply chains in the United
States and in countries with which the United States has reliable and
trusted economic relationships." The proposed regulations mention the
U.S.-Japan Critical Minerals Agreement as "\[o\]ne example" of trade
agreements that fall under the latter category of agreements with a
limited scope. The proposed regulations also note that "\[t\]he Treasury
Department and the IRS have consulted with the U.S. Trade Representative
in applying the proposed factors here." Overview of the U.S.-Japan
Critical Minerals Agreement The new U.S.-Japan Agreement focuses on five
minerals used in EV batteries, consistent with its stated objective,
which is: to strengthen and diversify critical minerals supply chains
and promote the adoption of electric vehicle battery technologies by
formalizing the shared commitment of the Parties to facilitate trade,
promote fair competition and market-oriented conditions for trade in
critical minerals, ensure robust labor and environmental standards, and
cooperate in efforts to ensure secure, sustainable, and equitable
critical minerals supply chains.\[2\] Trade in Critical Minerals The
Parties affirm their obligations under the World Trade Organization
("WTO") not to impose undue prohibitions or restrictions on imports of
critical minerals from --- or on exports of such minerals to --- the
other's territory and to accord national treatment to the critical
minerals of the other territory.\[3\] The Parties also agree to maintain
their "current practice" of not imposing export duties on critical
minerals exported to the other's territory.\[4\] The Parties commit to
confer on domestic measures to address non-market policies and practices
of other countries "affecting trade in critical minerals," as well as
"on issues relating to global critical minerals supply chain."\[5\] The
Parties will also confer on "best practices" concerning national
security review of investments by foreign entities in the Parties'
critical mineral sector, including through notifications of such
investments to the other Party where appropriate.\[6\] The Parties also
agree to support each other's efforts to address any supply chain
disruptions. \[7\] Sustainable and Equitable Supply Chains for Critical
Minerals The Agreement includes non-binding commitments on environmental
and labor rights protections with respect to critical minerals supply
chains. For instance, each Party "confirms its intention to ensure that
its environmental laws and policies provide for, and encourage, high
levels of environmental protection with respect to critical
minerals."\[8\] Similarly, each Party "confirms its intention to adopt
and maintain labor rights in its statutes and regulations, and practices
thereunder" and "to effectively enforce its labor laws."\[9\] Security
Exception The Parties agree that the Agreement shall not be construed
to: require a Party to furnish or allow access to any information the
disclosure of which it determines to be contrary to its essential
security interests; or preclude a Party from applying any measure that
it considers necessary for the fulfilment of its obligations with
respect to the maintenance or restoration of international peace or
security or for the protection of its own essential security
interests.\[10\] Cooperation and Consultations The Parties commit to
"seek to cooperate bilaterally and in plurilateral fora, as appropriate,
regarding efforts to ensure secure, sustainable, and equitable critical
minerals supply chains." The Parties also commit to "endeavor to refrain
from adopting or maintaining any measure that would nullify or impair
the objective of this Agreement or otherwise impede the cooperation
undertaken pursuant to this Article." \[11\] While the Agreement does
not provide a dispute resolution clause, the Parties commit to "enter
into consultations regarding any matter that might affect the operation
or interpretation of this Agreement" upon either Party's request, "with
a view to arriving at a mutually satisfactory resolution of the matter
within 60 days of the request."\[12\] The Agreement also mandates that
the Parties evaluate their respective capacities for the extraction and
processing of critical minerals every two years to determine if an
amendment to, or termination of, the Agreement is appropriate.\[13\] Key
Takeaways and Considerations for Future Developments [[The]{.mark}
U.S.-Japan Critical Minerals [Agreement]{.mark} is [the first of its
kind]{.mark}, [but will]{.mark} likely [not be the last]{.mark}. The
Agreement may [set a precedent for]{.mark} other [U.S. trading partners
that do not]{.mark} currently [have qualifying]{.mark} "free trade
[agreements"]{.mark} under the IRA, such as the European Union and the
United Kingdom.]{.underline} In a joint statement following a meeting on
March 10, 2023 between European Commission President Ursula von der
Leyen and U.S. President Joe Biden, for instance, the United States and
the EU agreed to begin negotiations for a "targeted critical minerals
agreement for the purpose of enabling relevant critical minerals
extracted or processed in the European Union to count toward
requirements for clean vehicles in the Section 30D clean vehicle tax
credit of the Inflation Reduction Act." According to the joint
statement, that agreement would expand "access to sources of critical
minerals that are sustainable, trusted, and free of labor abuses" and
"reduce unwanted strategic dependencies in these supply chains, and to
ensure that they are diversified and developed with trusted partners."
It is reported that Indonesia is also set to propose a similar agreement
with the United States, which a senior Indonesian official referred to
as a "limited FTA." The U.S.-Japan Critical Minerals Agreement covers
only five "critical minerals" --- lithium, graphite, manganese, cobalt,
and nickel --- even though there are 50 critical minerals covered under
the IRA. Undoubtedly, the minerals covered under the Agreement are the
most important and most resource-constrained minerals for EV batteries.
However, the critical minerals requirement of the IRA can be met if the
United States has an FTA with a foreign country, whatever the scope of
that FTA. As a result, even though this limited Agreement covers only
five, all critical minerals extracted or processed in Japan ---
including aluminum, for example --- may qualify as critical minerals
under the IRA if the regulations as proposed are finalized. Concerns may
thus be raised that this narrow Agreement on five minerals could operate
to convert any of the 50 minerals extracted or processed in Japan into
qualifying critical minerals.\[14\] [The narrowly-tailored [agreement
with Japan]{.mark} [is]{.mark} the latest [example]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
an [executive agreement that obviates]{.mark} [the need for
Congressional approval]{.mark}. Congress has been critical of the
growing reliance of the Biden Administration to pursue trade pacts that
need no Congressional approval, including most recently the
IPEF.]{.underline} House Ways & Means trade subcommittee Chair Adrian
Smith (R-NE), along with other key trade lawmakers from both parties,
has criticized the deal with Japan --- as well as a similar arrangement
under negotiation with the European Union --- because the administration
failed to provide sufficient transparency to Congress during the
negotiations. The trade subcommittee's ranking member, Rep. Earl
Blumenauer (D-OR), has also sharply criticized the Agreement, stating "I
fear we are crossing the Rubicon. [Today, the Biden Administration set
the stage to [ignore congressional intent]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
unilaterally [circumvent Congress']{.mark} constitutional role on
international trade."]{.underline} Companies will want to closely follow
ongoing and future U.S. negotiations toward similar agreements,
including with the EU. Interested parties should consider submitting
comments on the proposed regulations (including the FTA provision),
which are due on June 16, 2023. The regulations will likely be finalized
by the end of this year.

ONBM

It took Earth millions of years to deposit \"rare earths\" into isolated
batches, and it took a century after their discovery for scientists to
figure out what to do with them besides make lantern wicks burn
brighter. They became the building blocks of this age of technology -
integral to every smartphone, automobile and computer, and they\'re
behind staggering advances in medicine, energy production and weaponry.
It took China a decade to corner the world market in these 17 peculiar
metals, and years for the U.S. to realize it needed a coherent strategy
to gain independence from China\'s whims. Yet it took only hours for two
right-wing political groups to scuttle Congress\' bipartisan plan. After
a year of negotiation, HR1022 was fast-tracked, requiring two-thirds
approval. Rep. Eric Swalwell, D-Dublin, the bill\'s sponsor, had the
backing he needed. The morning of the vote, however, Heritage Action and
Club for Growth pulled off a deal-killing scheme that placed the vote on
their \"scorecard.\" Fearing the loss of their seats to
ultraconservatives in primary races, some Republicans backed down. The
bill gasped and died, 10 votes short. After weeding out the lies,
half-truths and straw arguments in the right-wing threat, there remain
[[two]{.underline}]{.mark} basic [arguments [against the
bill]{.mark}:]{.underline} The **[[groups]{.mark} [don\'t want
government oversight of]{.mark} the [rare-earths]{.mark} industry [and
they hate the idea of funding that and a technology
database]{.mark}]{.underline}**. These elements, however, are the heart
of the bill, and they are the guarantees we need for public safety.
[Government [oversight is necessary.]{.mark} Rare earths are mined, and
there\'s no such thing as clean mining. [Monitoring is needed
for]{.mark} the [public welfare]{.mark}.]{.underline} According to the
EPA, [there is [no formal]{.mark} national [strategy for
managing]{.mark} the [mining]{.mark}]{.underline}, refining and
manufacturing of rare earth elements. Ninety-five percent of what\'s
mined is waste, and contaminants can include radioactive dross, released
acids and the problems of heavy metals, tailings and concentrates
typical of any mining operation. Manufacturing these elements into super
magnets and other products is also hazardous and demands supervision.
[[No]{.mark} government [oversight?]{.mark} They have to be kidding. No
database, or, as the bill says, \"information hub\"? [This is a
farsighted innovation for a unique
situation]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Rare earth deposits are vastly
different from other ores. The complex separation of the elements from
the matrix has to be tailored to the deposit, to the very atomic
structure of the elements present, and there are a number of basic
refinement methods. [A [databank for sharing information]{.mark} is a
monumental idea.]{.underline} [The [price tag]{.mark} is [\$25 million a
year]{.mark} for five years to fund oversight and the
databank]{.underline}. It\'s a modest investment with big dividends in
public safety, jobs and innovation. Without [[those]{.mark} [two
provisions, condemned by the right]{.mark}]{.underline}, China benefits.
That nation, which produces 95 percent of the global REE supply, gained
its position by mining, refining and manufacturing with no thought for
the environment and people. China\'s new high taxes on rare-earth
elements, announced this week, will only begin to fund the cleanup, and
the costs will be passed down to us, the end users. In just a few hours,
[[years of work and bipartisan negotiation]{.mark}, Swalwell said,
\"[was reduced to rubble]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}\" But he has
options. We encourage him to go forward with his plan to reintroduce the
bill, and position it for a simple-majority vote. It will require only
one thing of congressional members: the realization that, just as it
took millennia to deposit rare earths, it took millions of years for
humankind to develop a spine. It\'s time for more members of Congress to
show theirs.

[[ESA]{.mark} has [contributed]{.mark}, [through]{.mark} its
[**satellite** projects]{.mark}, [to]{.mark} the [understanding]{.mark}
and monitoring of the Earth's environment]{.underline}. ESA and the
European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites
(EUMETSAT) concluded a [co-operation agreement in October 2015 that
provided for the further development of MetOp Second Generation
satellites, which were to be operational from the
mid-2020s]{.underline}. During 2022--26 ESA and EUMETSAT were jointly
establishing a Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) operational geostationary
meteorological satellite system. [[ESA]{.mark} and [EUMETSAT also
collaborate on]{.mark}]{.underline} the MetOp/EPS (EUMETSAT [[**Polar**
System]{.underline}]{.mark}) programme, [to provide observations from
**polar orbit**]{.underline}. In March 2021 ESA and a representative of
a Swedish consortium signed a contract providing for the development of
a new Arctic Weather Satellite mission---to be developed with EUMETSAT,
[[with the aim of]{.mark} providing '**nowcasting'**]{.underline} (i.e.
very short-range weather forecasting) [[in the Arctic]{.mark}
region.]{.underline}

[ESA is [responsible for]{.mark} the space component of the European
Commission's [Copernicus]{.mark} initiative]{.underline} (previously
known as the Global Monitoring for Environment and Security programme).
In April 2014 it launched the first of a series of Sentinel Earth
observation satellites. Sentinel-6, with a particular mission to produce
data on sea level rises, was launched in November 2020.

[The Space Situational Awareness]{.underline} (SSA) programme, which
became fully operational in 2012, [aims to develop a capability to
monitor natural phenomena as well as potentially hazardous
objects]{.underline}. In April 2013 an [ESA Space Weather Coordination
Centre]{.underline} (SSCC) was inaugurated in Brussels (Belgium), within
the framework of the SSA; an SSCC help desk provides expert support for
satellite operators, the telecommunications and navigation sectors, and
government agencies and research institutes on solar weather,
ionospheric weather, and on the state of the geomagnetic and the orbital
radiation environments.

ESA's FutureEO research and development programme [[focuses on]{.mark}
developing [**innovative** satellite missions]{.mark} and ways of using
Earth observation]{.underline}. ESA Earth Explorer missions, the
research element of its Living Planet Programme, aim to enhance
understanding of the Earth's system while addressing key challenges
identified by the scientific community. [[Ongoing missions
include]{.mark} CryoSat-2, launched in 2010 to monitor changes in the
thickness of polar sea ice and of the Antarctica and
**[Greenland]{.mark}** ice sheets]{.underline}; the Soil Moisture and
Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, launched in November 2009 to further
understanding of the Earth's water cycle; the Atmospheric Dynamics
Mission---Aeolus---launched in August 2018, to demonstrate measurements
of vertical wind profiles from space; Swarm, launched in November 2013
to investigate the Earth's magnetic field; and Biomass, which aims to
assess annual changes in the above-ground biomass of tropical forests.
An Earth Cloud, Aerosol, and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) mission was
launched in May 2024, with the aim of improving the representation and
understanding of the Earth's radiative balance in climate and numerical
forecast models, and a Fluorescence Explorer (FLEX) programme is
planned, to monitor photosynthetic activity. In February 2021 ESA
approved the development of a Harmony satellite initiative, designed to
measure small alterations in the shape of the Earth's land and sea
surfaces that might indicate volcanic, earthquake, or glacier melting
activity and concomitant sea level rise risks. In November 2022 the
Council approved the development of an Aeolus-2 mission (with a focus on
measuring global wind speeds), and MAGIC, which was to observe the
volume of water in oceans, glaciers and ice sheets.

[[There is considerable interest]{.mark} in Germany and [across Europe
in]{.mark} using the data, as improved weather forecasts in [the polar
region]{.mark} will lead to significant improvements in forecasts on the
European continent]{.underline}, particularly for prolonged periods of
heat and cold.

[[AWS]{.underline}]{.mark} is a precursor to the EPS Sterna satellite
constellation, which [[is being developed by the]{.mark} European Space
Agency (**[ESA]{.mark}**) on behalf of the European Organisation for the
Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites]{.underline} (EUMETSAT). EPS
Sterna will comprise three generations of six small satellites in three
Earth orbits, delivering precise weather data from the polar regions
over the long term. The constellation will complement existing satellite
systems such as MetOp-SG from EUMETSAT and JPSS from the US National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

[AWS [will demonstrate]{.mark} the [functionality of the
satellite]{.mark} and its instruments[, as well the benefits]{.mark} in
terms of cost- and time-efficiency of the \'New Space\'
approach.]{.underline}

Fast, cost-effective and future-proof with German technology

[AWS was [developed with completely new methods]{.mark} in order [to
achieve results **cost effectively** and on **schedule**]{.mark}, in
line with the New Space approach]{.underline}. In particular,
[[technical requirements]{.mark} and testing procedures [were
significantly simplified]{.mark}, [leading to the]{.mark} completion of
the [satellite just 36 months after ESA awarded the contract]{.mark} to
the main contractor, OHB Sweden. The project remained remarkably cost
efficient throughout.]{.underline}

Walther Pelzer, German Aerospace Center (Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und
Raumfahrt; DLR) Executive Board Member and Director General of the
German Space Agency at DLR, highlights the project\'s significance for
the German economy and research community: \"I am very pleased that we
can strengthen Germany as a space centre with AWS. German research
institutions and medium-sized space companies have played a major role
in the satellite\'s development. The planned production of a total of 20
satellites as part of the EPS Sterna programme will result in numerous
contracts for German SMEs in the long term.\"

Germany is contributing around 18 percent of AWS\'s costs through ESA,
funded by the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action
(BMWK). The EPS Sterna constellation will be operated by EUMETSAT and
funded by the Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport (BMDV).

\"[ESA has succeeded in developing a proto-flight model of the AWS in a
**very** short time, [demonstrating its]{.mark} operational
**[readiness]{.mark}** ahead of a potential future]{.underline} EUMETSAT
programme. [This showcases the ways satellites [can be successfully and
efficiently developed]{.mark} with the help of New Space approaches.
This innovation ecosystem is precisely what we aim to advance with our
space strategy]{.underline},\" says Anna Christmann, Federal Government
Coordinator of German Aerospace Policy.

interests in [the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. A variety of ESA
programmes are directly or indirectly targeting the Arctic area for
scientific purposes, for a better understanding of the Arctic
environment or to support other activities in the Arctic region, since
many of the specific challenges of the Arctic can be addressed by space
technology. [Monitoring and assessing the Arctic environment are tasks

(SGDs), which were adopted by UN Member States in 2015, apply globally,
the Arctic is especially affected by the changing climate and thus
considered to be of great interest to the European and international
community. [[ESA fully supports]{.mark} and works towards attaining the
**[SGDs]{.mark}**, and has to this end created a toolbox to target each

economic development in the Arctic]{.underline}. After providing a
general introduction to the Arctic and its legal status, as well as an
overview over different interests in the region, this paper details the
numerous ways, in which space activities can contribute to the
sustainable development and life in the Arctic. [It then turns to

#### Europe gets [on board]{.underline} --- [Zero deficits]{.underline}. Funding [links harder]{.underline} to the aff.

("Addressing Arctic Vulnerabilities: Lessons from Ukraine," CSIS, Dec

<https://www.csis.org/analysis/addressing-arctic-vulnerabilities>,
Accessed 7/5/2025)

[[Addressing]{.mark} several [vulnerabilities]{.mark} in particular
[would effectively bolster Arctic security]{.mark}. While most
[European]{.mark} NATO members **[already agree]{.mark}**]{.underline}
with and have begun to answer the need for a general increase in defense
expenditure---particularly in naval power for Arctic states---since
February 2022, there remain points of weakness.

Arctic geography is vast and remote, making it hard to establish and
maintain a comprehensive surveillance and communications network. A cold
and rugged climate subject to rapid environmental changes, including in
ice conditions, make the Arctic a challenging operating environment and
constrains options for building robust infrastructure.18

In the absence of a redundant communications network, long-range
communications in the Arctic primarily rely on undersea cables, a
dependency that is a vulnerability.19 [[Undersea cables offer little
resistance to sabotage, acting as **low-hanging fruit** for]{.mark} an
adversary to exploit though physical damage, cyberattacks, or
[espionage]{.mark}]{.underline}.20 For zones like Svalbard, which is
dependent on two fiber-optic cables for outside communications, [[the
situation is **precarious**]{.underline}]{.mark}. A loss of both cables
would carry strategic implications, as transmissions to and from the
K-SAT satellite station---the world's largest satellite ground station
and of strategic importance to satellites in polar orbit---would
effectively be lost.21

Svalbard's fiber-optic cable dependence was tested in January 2022 when
one of the cables was cut, rendering the archipelago entirely reliant on
reserve capacity from its one remaining cable. Although the cause of the
incident remains unconfirmed, Russian trawlers were spotted by the cable
shortly beforehand.22 Similarly, in April 2021, a 4.3-kilometer section
of an undersea cable outside the Norwegian coast disappeared, with no
information on how or on the actors involved.23 In addition, while
outside of Arctic territory, the 2022 Nord Stream Pipeline sabotage in
the Baltic Sea strongly resembled the Svalbard incident.24 With all of
these incidents left unattributed, albeit doubtlessly caused by human
interference, they reflect both the vulnerability of critical subsea
infrastructure as well as the need for maritime situational awareness in
the Arctic.

The same vulnerabilities can be applied to Arctic petroleum
infrastructure. As Norway has become the largest petroleum supplier in
Europe---in tandem with European states reducing their reliance on
Russian energy---the Nordic country's strategic importance as an
exporter has greatly increased. The security dimension of energy
production has become more visible. This also makes Norwegian energy
infrastructure in Arctic waters an increasingly attractive target for
Russian sabotage.25 Furthermore, Norway has recently permitted
exploration of mineral extraction further into the Arctic, which may
lead to additional geopolitical importance for the Norwegian continental
shelf.26 Additional maritime infrastructure incentivizes increased
awareness to safeguard these assets against potential threats.

While [[space]{.mark}-based [com]{.mark}munication [is the most
**capable alternative**]{.mark} to undersea cables, the Arctic is
[hampered by]{.mark} significant [shortcomings in satellite]{.mark}
capabilitie[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. Conventional SATCOM from
geosynchronous orbit is unstable or unusable in large parts of the
Arctic due to limited coverage above 70 degrees latitude.27 As a result,
satellite coverage in the Arctic largely relies on satellites in polar
or highly elliptical orbits. Currently, Arctic SATCOM mainly encompasses
narrowband frequencies with constrained data rates and high latency,
thereby limiting functionality. [[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
possesses military satellites with encrypted communications, such as the
Enhanced Polar System, but the existing [pool]{.mark} of Arctic
satellite capabilities [is **insufficient**]{.mark} for current
operational requirements]{.underline}.28 The accuracy of precision,
navigation, and timing (PNT) systems, such as GPS, is also limited in
the Arctic, causing potential challenges for precision-based munitions
and navigational awareness.29 Even with fully functional PNT systems,
Arctic states can still expect Russian GPS-jamming as an asymmetric tool
to impact states' abilities to utilize advanced munitions and
vehicles.30

Aside from SATCOM, [[bolstering]{.mark} situational [awareness depends
on continuous]{.mark} and accurate [ISR]{.mark}]{.underline}
(intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance) over the vast Arctic
region, which is [[only achievable through]{.mark} a foundation of
[space]{.mark}-based ISR]{.underline}.31 While aerial capabilities such
as P-8 reconnaissance aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) may
supplement localized ISR, these capabilities have insufficient range and
speed to cover the vastness of the Arctic geography.32 Similarly,
sea-based capabilities, including Coast Guard vessels and sea-based
drones, face limitations in range and operational endurance, making it
challenging to ensure comprehensive coverage without the support of
space-based systems.33

[[The Space Force relies **entirely** on data]{.mark}---[but]{.mark} it
[lacks]{.mark} the [systems]{.mark} and tools [to analyze and
share]{.mark} that data]{.underline} properly even within the service,
let alone [[with international partners]{.underline}]{.mark}, officials
said May 1.

"[**[It's the backbone of everything]{.mark}** that we're going to do,
every application that we're going to build, every system that we
use]{.underline}," Shannon Pallone, program executive officer for battle
management and command, control, and communications at Space Systems
Command, told an audience of defense contractors at the ACFEA Northern
Virginia chapter's Space Force IT Day in suburban Virginia.

She said space is increasingly a "system of systems environment ... You
don't have satellite A over here, and satellite B over there and they
never talk to each other. Everything interacts." She compared it to a
mapping app on a modern smartphone: "They're interacting with data,
they're getting smarter over time. They're pulling in restaurant
reviews, pulling in real-time traffic data, pulling in weather," she
said.

In the same way, Pallone said, the Space Force has to think about data
as a principle element in all its technology. "If we're not thinking
about it with a data-first mentality, we're going to end up buying the
wrong things. They're not going to talk to each other, and we're never
going to get to where we need to go."

"It's the most foundational and fundamental thing that we need to get
right as a Space Force," she told a panel on data and artificial
intelligence.

Data "really enables all our space operations," agreed Lt. Col. Jose
Almanzar, commander of the 19th Space Defense Squadron, which is one of
the Space Force units responsible for tracking objects in space. "You
can't do launch, can't fly satellites, can't really de-orbit or even
operate satellites safely without having that fundamental space domain
awareness data. ... Without \[that data\] I think all the other
functions we do in space are in jeopardy," he said.

Tracking 46,000 objects in orbit generates about 1 million observations
daily, Almanzar said. That's on top of a daily feed of commercial SDA
data compiled by the service's Joint Commercial Office, he said.

Such a huge volume of data creates a couple of challenges, he explained.
"One, how do we prevent important data from falling beneath the noise
floor, and it goes unnoticed? That's a big risk. But, two, when a lot of
things are coming at the operators, how do we minimize the risk that
they get inundated with useless data? And how do we tease out what's
useful, what's not, in different environments?"

Providing that firehose of SDA data, even to other Space Force
components, is challenging, Almanzar said, because of the limitations of
aging legacy systems.

Some of the Guardians that joined his team "probably saw some really
nice commercials on TV with really cool graphics and whatnot," Almanzar
said.

"And when they show up to \[our unit\], and they see the system that
we're working with, they're like, what is this? What are we dealing
with? And that's not just a 19th \[Space Defense Squadron\] thing,
that's across the Space Force," he said, adding that the service was
investing heavily to modernize quickly.

But, in the meantime, he said, "there's risk there, because a lot of the
systems we're using aren't interoperable."

He explained that, [[to move data around, operators]{.mark} frequently
[have to **burn it onto a CD**]{.mark}]{.underline}. "Those are small
round plastic discs for the folks that don't remember," he joked.

[[Those problems are]{.mark} even [worse when it comes to
**international partners**]{.mark}]{.underline}, explained Group Capt.
Jonny Farrow, the deputy director for strategy, futures, partnerships,
and requirements at Space Force HQ and a Royal Air Force exchange
officer, during an earlier session.

[[As a result]{.mark} of over-classification and other restrictions on
information]{.underline}, he said, [[adversaries can know more about
what U.S. forces could achieve in space than allies
do]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"To put things in terms of red and blue, I would say collectively, the
red forces probably know more about blue capabilities than the blue
forces know about each other. And [that's an **absolute
fact**]{.underline}. And it's certainly something that we really need to
get over if we are going to get further," he said.

[Finland's Unique]{.underline} Maritime [Industry]{.underline}

[[Finland's]{.mark} [shipyards]{.mark} have the [capacity]{.mark} to
[produce icebreakers **quickly**]{.mark} and [at]{.mark} a **[reasonable
cost]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is estimated that, compared to US
icebreaker production underway, [the [average]{.mark} [Finnish]{.mark}
[icebreaker]{.mark} would **cost about a [fifth]{.mark} of the
[price]{.mark}** and be **[completed]{.mark} in [about 24
months]{.mark}** after a contract is signed, in part due to the
ecosystem developed around the shipyards and close coordination with the
Finnish government.]{.underline} The Finnish Marine Industries
(Meriteollisuus in Finnish) as an industry group represents the combined
industries of Finland's maritime cluster that makes Finnish shipbuilding
so cost effective and efficient. [Finland's maritime industry consists
of over 1,100 companies and employs more than 25,000
people]{.underline}. The ecosystem surrounding the major Finnish
shipyards is the secret sauce that makes their [**maritime**
**industry** one of the **most competitive** in the world.]{.underline}

Finland's shipyards have the capacity to produce icebreakers quickly and
at a reasonable cost. It is estimated that, compared to US icebreaker
production underway, the average Finnish icebreaker would cost about a
fifth of the price and be completed in about 24 months after a contract
is signed, in part due to the ecosystem developed around the shipyards
and close coordination with the Finnish government.

[Many [European]{.mark} [shipyards]{.mark} have [ceased]{.mark}
[operations]{.mark} or significantly declined in output, in favor of
cheaper labor at shipyards in Asia]{.underline}. Today, China, Japan,
and South Korea make up more than 90% of shipbuilding worldwide. The
[**[shipbuilding expertise]{.mark}** [preserved]{.mark} in **Finland**
is therefore [highly **specialized**]{.mark}, [building **ice
resistant**]{.mark} **[vessels]{.mark}**, [ferries]{.mark}, and other
specific functions]{.underline}. Beyond breaking up ice in Finland's
ports and allowing the flow of goods, its icebreaker fleet also plays a
vital role in search and rescue, oil spills, route planning, emergency
towing, and maritime traffic control. [**[Finland's]{.mark}
[icebreakers]{.mark}** are [operated by a **state-owned
enterprise**]{.mark}]{.underline}, compared to the United States or
Canada where the country's navy or coast guard operates their
icebreakers.

In the past, Russian ownership, support of, and business for Finnish
shipyards has raised concerns in US-Finnish relations. [However there
was a [hard **break**]{.mark} **[in relations between Russia and
Finland]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} the invasion of [Ukraine in
**2022**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Since then, all [ongoing projects with
Russian companies have ceased]{.underline}, the main land border with
Russia has been closed since November 2023 following waves of
instrumentalized migration, and [**Finland's** **[decision]{.mark}** to
[join **NATO**]{.mark} [cemented]{.mark} the Nordic nation's place in
Western [security architecture]{.mark}.]{.underline} Although it was
never in doubt that Finland aligned itself with the West--its purchase
of 64 US-made F-35 fighter jets in 2021 sent a clear signal to
Washington--[Finland's decision to join NATO removed the final inkling
of doubt and [**paved the way** for **increased** **icebreaker**
**cooperation**]{.mark} between the US and Finland.]{.underline}
Finland's President, Alexander Stubb, said that the ICE Pact would not
be possible without Finland's NATO membership. With this concern
removed, Finland can raise NATO's icebreaking capabilities through its
knowledge and shipyards.

If you ask your average Finn what their country is best known for, they
might point to saunas or their regular top ranking as the world's
happiest country. But for Finland, a country in which almost every port
freezes over with ice up to 30 inches thick for up to half of the
year--and 92.4% of trade in 2022 flowing through these ice-prone ports
each year--it has had to develop a specialized knowledge of icebreakers
and icebreaking technology[. [Finland]{.mark} [**leads the world** in
**icebreaker** design and **construction**]{.mark},]{.underline} with an
often-cited fact that [**[80%]{.mark}** of the world's icebreakers are
**[designed by Finnish firms]{.mark}** and more **than [60% of]{.mark}
icebreakers are [built in Finnish shipyards]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This
hard-earned knowledge has made [[Finland]{.mark} a **[global

now [**seeks to share its know-how** via the **ICE

States, Canada, and Finland. Before turning to the larger implications
of the trilateral partnership, it is worth unpacking what allows Finland
to be a giant in the icebreaker industry, evaluate its current
icebreaker fleet and its capabilities, as well as look ahead to its
icebreaking industry's potential growth under ICE Pact.

There are [three major shipyards in Finland]{.underline}: Helsinki
shipyards, Turku shipyards, and the Rauma shipyard.

[Helsinki shipyards]{.underline} were established in 1865 and began
building icebreakers in 1910. As of November 2023, Davie (a Canadian
company) is the largest owner of the Helsinki shipyard, taking over
after the previous Russian owners were ousted following Russia's 2022
invasion of Ukraine. In 2010, Russian ownership was initially 50 percent
through the United Shipbuilding Corporation, in partnership with a South
Korean company, STX. Beginning in 2017, the Russian company sought to
sell its holdings after increased US sanctions against the company
limited business.

Meyer Turku operates out of the Turku shipyards which have been in
operation since 1737. The Turku shipyards, located in the former capital
of Finland on the southwest coast, prides itself in constructing modern
and environmentally friendly vessels, especially cruise ships and
specialized vessels. Turku shipyards produced the Icon of the Seas, the
world's largest cruise ship in the world that entered into service in
2024. The Turku shipyard is so large that more than half of the
companies involved in the Finnish maritime cluster trade with it.

The **[[Rauma shipyard]{.underline}]{.mark}** is run by Rauma Marine
Constructions ([RMC]{.underline}), a company [founded in 2014,
on]{.underline} [Finland's west coast]{.underline}. After STX withdrew
from Rauma in 2013, the shipyard was almost shut down, nearly ending 300
years of production and potentially costing 600 jobs from Rauma and
another 100 from Turku, before RMC was launched. In Rauma[, three
icebreakers have been designed and built between 1993 and 1998: the
Fennica, Nordica, and Botnica.]{.underline} The Fennica and Nordica are
still in operation by Arctia Oy, while the Botnica was sold to the Port
of Tallinn in 2012. [RMC is still engaged in the maintenance of the
Nordica and Fennica, and a project to upgrade the capabilities of the
icebreaker Otso was completed in 2015.]{.underline} The **[[four
multi-role]{.mark} [corvettes]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[commissioned]{.mark} [by]{.mark} the Finnish
[Navy]{.mark}]{.underline} are also being **[[designed]{.mark} in

Once an icebreaker launches from the major shipyards, how is it operated
and by whom? [The [majority of Finland's icebreaker]{.mark}
[fleet]{.mark} is [operated]{.mark} and managed [by Arctia]{.mark}
Ltd,]{.underline} a [company [fully owned by]{.mark} the [Finnish
state]{.mark}]{.underline} and its corporate governance falls under the
Ministry of Transport and Communications. Arctia is operated by 423
staff (as of 2023), of which about 254 are marine personnel.

Beyond government ownership of the company managing the icebreakers in

considerable [investments in]{.mark} major [companies in]{.mark} the
value [chain of]{.mark} the [icebreaking design]{.mark} and
[construction]{.mark} process.]{.underline} Two thirds of Aker Arctic, a

remain in good standing** **with**]{.mark} its largest stakeholder, the
**[government]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [Finnish government stepped in

ice-going vessels, including **[icebreakers]{.underline}**. Among its
portfolio of [icebreaker [designs]{.mark}]{.underline} is the
**[[Polaris]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Finland's newest icebreaker) and the
**[[USCGC Mackinaw]{.underline}]{.mark}**, a heavy icebreaker [operated

Finland's Current Icebreaker Fleet

Pinning down exactly how many ships make up Finland's icebreaker fleet
is difficult, in part due to various classifications of hull thickness
and icebreaking capabilities. [The US Coast Guard lists in a 2020
infographic that Finland has **11 icebreakers**]{.underline} (two of
which have since wound up in Russia, another is a tugboat with limited
icebreaking capabilities). The number is in constant flux as ships
undergo repairs or are refitted.

According to Finland's maritime strategy, at least nine icebreakers are
needed in normal or moderate winter conditions to ensure the safe usage
of its ports year-round. At the time of publication, Finland's
icebreaker fleet consists primarily of 8 vessels (the Polaris, Fennica,
Nordica, Otso, Kontio, Urho, Sisu, and Voima). An additional 6 vessels
have icebreaking capabilities and, although they are not primarily used
as such, could be utilized in a state of emergency (the Louhi, Ahto,
Zeus of Finland, Turva, Sampo, and Calypso/Saimaa).

Russian icebreakers famously rely on nuclear power for their fleet, but
as of 2021 they too are experimenting with designing a LNG-powered
icebreaker. The Polaris has a planned 50 year lifecycle and is operated
by a 16-member crew. [As the first LNG-powered icebreaker, the
[Polaris]{.mark} is a **[next generation heavy icebreaker]{.mark}** and
will [likely be a **model** **for** future vessels]{.mark} built as part
of **ICE Pact**.]{.underline}

The MSV Fennica and Nordica are sister ships, designed in Rauma and
launched in 1993 and 1994, respectively. Both are considered
multipurpose icebreakers, balancing power with precision to adapt to
many operating environments. The two Otso (referring to a Finnish
mythological bear) class vessels: the IB Otso and Kontio are identical
ships that launched in 1986 and 1987, respectively. The Otso and Kontio
replaced the aging Karhu (bear in Finnish) class icebreakers (the Karhu,
Murtaja and Sampo) and are typically the first to be deployed in the
icebreaking season. They are less powerful than the larger Urho and
Sisu, and were built with cost efficiency in mind, reducing operating
costs with a smaller crew and an efficient hull design. The
[Kontio]{.underline} [was outfitted in 2010 with oil recovery
equipment,]{.underline} making it one of the **[go-to ships in the event
of a major oil spill.]{.underline}**

The veteran vessels of the Finnish icebreaking fleet are the two Urho
class ships--the IB Urho and Sisu--and the "old faithful" IB Voima, the
latter of which helped launch Finland's icebreaking industry into the
public eye. The Urho--named after President of Finland Urho
Kekkonen--launched in 1975, followed shortly thereafter by her sister
ship the Sisu in 1976. The Urho and Sisu have three additional sister
ships flagged by Sweden that were developed in cooperation with the
Swedish government, the Atle (1974), Frej (1975), and Ymer (1977). The
Urho class vessels are workhorses capable of displacing 60% more ice
than its predecessor (at the trade-off of less ice resistance). For the
first time in history, all 23 of Finland's ports were fully ice-free
thanks to the Urho and Sisu. The Sisu was named after the untranslatable
Finnish word that defines the country's stoic tenacity, but its name
also commemorates Finland's first diesel-electric icebreaker that
launched in 1939, also named Sisu. It was replaced in 1976 by the much
more powerful Sisu still in operation today, the original Sisu was
briefly renamed the Louhi from 1975 to 1986 before being broken up.

The IB Voima, the [oldest icebreaker still in operation in Finland, was
commissioned in 1954 and celebrated its 70th anniversary in February
2024]{.underline}. The Voima was built by Wärtsilä (whose engine designs
power most of Finnish icebreakers) as part of Finland's post-war
rebuilding program. War reparations to the Soviet Union, amounting to
\$300 million in ships and machinery, led to the design and creation of
what was then [considered to be the most **technically advanced
icebreaker** in the world.]{.underline} The Voima has four sister ships,
three were given to the Soviet Union (Kapitan Belousov in 1954, Kapitan
Voronin in 1955, and Kapitan Melehov in 1956), and one was delivered to
Sweden (Oden in 1957). It received a major upgrade between 1978 and 1979
to modernize its machinery, including a completely new main engine, new
quarters for the crew, and a new bridge. Because the renovation took
place around the same time as the launch of the Urho class vessels, it
shares many technical capabilities and similarities to the Urho and
Sisu. Although much of its interior has been replaced, the Voima remains
one of the oldest icebreakers in active service. In 2016, the Voima
received a ten-year life cycle extension and in 2023 received a major
update of its main drive and diesel automation.

The [[aforementioned **eight icebreakers**]{.mark} are all operated by
Arctia and are **[state-owned]{.mark}**.]{.underline} There are a
[handful of **[additional icebreakers]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
operation that, [in the event of a major crisis or
incident,]{.underline} could be **[[called upon for]{.mark}
[service]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The Finnish Navy operates a pollution
control vessel named Louhi, with pennant number 999 on her hull. The
Louhi entered service in 2011 and was designed by Työvene (Työvene also
designed the Harbour Icebreaker IB Ahto, operated by Arctia). It is
formally owned by the Finnish Environment Institute (SYKE) but [operated
by the Finnish Navy]{.underline}. Although the Louhi's main mission is
not solely icebreaking, [it has the hull strength and capacity to
operate as an icebreaker if necessary.]{.underline}

Alfons Håkans, based in Turku, designs tug boats capable of operating in
icy conditions. Its considerable fleet consists of 39 tugs, 13 barges,
and 16 work boats. Of its 39 tugs, 8 are classified as 1A Super and 22
vessels as 1A, meaning they can operate in icy conditions and help to
ensure vessels can deliver goods to ports across Finland and the
Baltics. The Zeus of Finland is the best known and one of the most
capable icebreaking tugs operated by Alfons Håkans. There exists various
ice classes rankings across the world, with the most standardized being
the Polar class, however Finland operates using the Finnish-Swedish ice
class. This consists of rankings from 1A Super, 1A, 1B, and 1C. There
has been a proposition for a new class, the 1A Super+, to separate those
vessels which are able to operate without assistance practically in any
conditions.

Additionally, the Finnish Border Guard vessel [Turva]{.underline},
launched in 2013, [is capable of breaking ice up to 80 centimeters (31
in) in thickness and is sometimes counted towards Finland's icebreaking
fleet]{.underline}. The Turva is the largest vessel in the Finnish
Border Guard's fleet and is its [first to be powered by]{.underline}
**[LNG]{.underline}**. The Sampo icebreaker, which entered into service
in 1960, was bought by the northern town of Kemi, Finland as a tourist
attraction in 1987. The City of Kemi began operating the Sampo
icebreaker in 1988 and it has become a major tourist draw to the region.

Another icebreaker that is occasionally included in some lists of
Finnish icebreakers is the Calypso/Saimaa, operated by Alfons Håkans.
The tugboat Calypso has an attachable, self-propelled icebreaking bow
(the first of its kind) that allows it to assist vessels on Finland's
largest Lake Saimaa. Lake Saimaa, the fourth largest freshwater lake in
Europe, is connected to the Gulf of Finland via a canal near Vyborg,
Russia. Prior to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Saimaa Canal
was regularly used by Finnish recreational vessels seeking to drydock
for the winter. Half of the canal is in Finnish and half in Russian
territory, with a 1962 lease agreement renewed in 2012 regulating use of
the waterway. Despite the canal formally reopening for cargo and
passenger boats in June 2024, virtually no traffic has been reported.
The extremist Task Force Rusich paramilitary organization has claimed to
have been patrolling the Russian side, prompting concerns over the
security of canal maintenance employees. Task Force Rusich is sanctioned
by the United States' Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and
described them as "a neo-Nazi paramilitary group that has participated
in combat alongside Russia's military in Ukraine." Effectively, this
means that the Calypso is locked in Lake Saimaa, unable to traverse the
Saimaa Canal to the larger Gulf of Finland and Baltic Sea if needed in
an emergency. It could be transported by road or rail, if necessary. In
the same vein as the US Great Lakes, Lake Saimaa needs an icebreaker
onhand.

Finland's Lost Icebreaker: The Thetis

Finland has a long history of building and selling icebreakers to the
former Soviet Union and Russia (such as the Karhu, Apu, or more recently
the Hermes), its neighbors in the Baltics (such as the Botnica and
Tarmo, which were sold to Estonia, and the Varma, which was sold to
Latvia), and for its fellow Nordics (primarily Sweden, Norway's ports
remain largely ice free due to the Gulf Stream). Finnish shipyards
continued to produce ships for Russia and Russian companies until the
2022 invasion of Ukraine.

Although there was a hard break in sales to Russia following the 2022
invasion, a Finnish icebreaker still wound up under Russian ownership in
2023: the Thetis. In operation by Alfons Håkans until July 2023, the
Thetis was sold to a Hong Kong-based company that transported the
icebreaker to Istanbul. The ship was later re-routed to St. Petersburg
for repairs, with the new owner claiming the port at Istanbul was unable
to accommodate the ship. Now, the Thetis is based out of Murmansk and
flies a Russian flag. Alfons Håkans did not violate international
sanctions on Russia and conducted a thorough investigation of the buyer,
who reportedly had neither links to China nor Russia. This underreported
saga demonstrates: 1) the geopolitical importance of icebreakers, 2)
continued attempts by Russia to coercively acquire Western technology,
and 3) the important role of friendshoring and limiting access to next
generation icebreaking technology amongst allies.

Finnish Icebreakers: A Rare Export

[Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 and severing of economic
ties with Russia, **Finland** **has** **been in search of a market** for
its exceptional maritime and shipbuilding base.]{.underline} The
[ecosystem]{.underline} surrounding Finnish [icebreakers]{.underline}
allows them to be **[built at a remarkable speed]{.underline}**, at a
[**price point far** **lower** than anyone else, and their **technical
expertise** mean Finnish icebreakers are **cutting edge.**]{.underline}
Finland's current fleet of icebreakers meets domestic demand to keep
their ports operational year-round, but as the Voima's age and continued
extensions shows, [Finland too needs new icebreakers]{.underline}. [Now,
as a **NATO ally**, Finland can **usher in a new era of icebreakers** by
**sharing** its **know-how** with the alliance and help to **minimize**
the **advantage Russia** **has** in icebreaking
capabilities.]{.underline}

### Nuclear Icebreakers Bad

#### 

Most of the [Russian icebreaker fleet is nuclear-based due to the fuel
costs of running an icebreaker]{.underline}. On average, an ic[ebreaker
working in regions with three-meter-thick ice uses more than 100 tons of
fuel per day.]{.underline} However, **[nuclear icebreakers have obvious
concerns as well]{.underline}**. In fact, [should an accident occur, the
consequence would be as **severe as the Chernobyl** **disaster** and the
**Deepwater Horizon oil spill combined**: **devastating**.]{.underline}

NPV = Nuclear Powered Vessel

[Despite the high energy output, it can create **devastating
situations** in terms of security]{.underline}. Thus, the field and port
of installation must be determined clearly. [Due to the possibility for
large energy output from radioactive fuels, commercial NPV access to
canals or ports may be limited]{.underline} or forbidden \[26\].

[Reactor production, high investment and operating cost, maintenance,
emergency response, difficult dismantling process and fuel disposal are
remarkably]{.underline} compelling, comprehensive, **[costly and
unpredictable]{.underline}** compared to conventional propulsion marine
vessels \[9,19,26,27\]. That\'s why **[sustainability and stability
could not be achieved]{.underline}**, in spite of that NPVs left a
notable impact on maritime history \[26\]. Shipbuilders, ship-owners and
ship operators have not fully accepted NP systems on merchant ships,
despite the fact that low fuel cost, high speed and increased cargo
capacity make nuclear ships optimistic \[10\]. [Environmental
perceptions and social concerns are the primary barriers on NPVs
operation]{.underline}, throughout the entrance and mooring to the ports
\[26\]. [High vibrations and increased pitch and roll can result in
extremely serious threats on the environment, people, and other
things]{.underline}, when NPVs operating in bad weather conditions. In
addition, [accidents]{.underline} such as collision, grounding and
sinking that [can also occur even in good sea conditions can cause the
**leakage of radioactive material and meltdowns**]{.underline} \[5,10\].
Nuclear power plant equipment and workers\' clothing are exposed to
radioactive pollution. Briefly, possible damage as a result of the
spread of radioactivity to the environment is one of the biggest and
most noteworthy obstacles to nuclear system \[2,28\] [since the behavior
of the reactor and the limits of harm are difficult to fully
pinpoint]{.underline} \[5\]. That\'s why, radiation shielding barrier,
vibration reduction tools, collision and grounding preventive systems,
energy, cooling equipment should be installed on NPVs to minimize or
completely eliminate the leakage \[3,12\].

In contrast to high energy, the [construction of new NPVs brings nuclear
waste]{.underline}. Therefore, disposal processes need to be accelerated
and improved since [disposal of old nuclear wastes still
continues]{.underline} \[2\]. Service supply, port acceptance procedure
of countries, [lack of trained personnel are tremendous challenges on
using in maritime]{.underline} industry \[10\]. Moreover, [NPVs have the
potential to invade the lands of thousands of people \[2\].]{.underline}

[**Breaking ice** **requires** a host of **specific design
features**.]{.underline} Traditional [icebreakers pair **high-powered
engines** with **specially shaped** **hulls** designed to create
downward pressure over the top of the ice, breaking it apart under high
tensile forces, as ice is weak in tension]{.underline}. For particularly
thick ice, or ice ridges, the [entire front of the icebreaker may be
driven up onto the ice, breaking the ice beneath it.]{.underline} The
hull and ship structure must be strong enough to withstand the impact of
ice, and a heavily [reinforced "**ice-belt,"** often made of special
high-strength steel,]{.underline} is installed near the level of the
waterline. Things [like **air bubbler** **systems**]{.underline} (which
blow bubbles of air up around the ship from beneath the water) and
[**low-friction paint** reduce friction as the ship forces its way
through the ice]{.underline}. Traditional [icebreaking hull shapes,
while well suited to breaking through ice, perform poorly in open ocean
operations;]{.underline} the Polar Star has been dubbed "The Polar
Roller" due to its tendency to roll constantly.

The development of rotatable "azimuth" thrusters in the late 1980s,
sometimes known as azipods, changed the mechanics of icebreaking.
Icebreaking ships with azimuth thrusters are often designed to break ice
by moving backwards, using the propellers to break ice from below and to
flush the hull with water to reduce friction. Not only does this reduce
the power required to break ice, but it allows for the front (bow) of
the ship to be designed for better open water performance. Some modern
icebreakers are designed to use azimuth thrusters to move forward at an
oblique angle to create an especially wide channel.

design and construction a specialized field of expertise.]{.underline} A
[relatively **small number** of **shipbuilders** are **responsible** for
the **lion's** **share** of icebreaker design and

them.]{.underline}

Bollinger Shipyards has been awarded a \$951.6 million government
contract to build the first American new heavy polar icebreaker. These
are the first such orders in nearly 50 years for American shipyards.
This is the first in a series of ships to be built under the U.S. Coast
Guard polar security cutter (PSC) program.

[Bollinger Shipyards announced a few days ago that it had been awarded a
\$951.6 million contract to build the first American new heavy polar
icebreaker]{.underline}, the first such order in nearly 50 years. The
[**contract** had **been prepared earlier** in cooperation with the U.S.
Coast Guard]{.underline}. However, the [requirements and series were
still being agreed upon,]{.underline} which is why the [signing of the
contract was not announced until March of this year.]{.underline}

The [Lockport, Louisiana-based shipyard group announced that the
contract modification accelerates the detailed design and construction
phase of the U.S. Coast Guard polar security cutter (PSC]{.underline}).
The way is being [paved for the first ship in the series]{.underline},
the 460'x88′ USCGC Polar Sentinel (WMSP-21).

The [icebreaker is scheduled for **completion by 2030**.]{.underline}
The contract was awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command. [The U.S.
Navy manages the fleet development program in conjunction with the U.S.
Coast Guard.]{.underline} Acquisitions and oversight of contracts and
spending for Coast Guard ships and vessels are managed through an
integrated office.

"Securing this contract modification was truly a Herculean effort and
underscores the incredible confidence the U.S. government has in
Bollinger [to build and deliver the **first heavy polar** **icebreaker**
in **half a century**,"]{.underline} said Ben Bordelon, president and

[Finland]{.underline}, which joined NATO in May 2023 as its 31st member,
[is considered to be the most experienced Arctic nation building polar
icebreakers]{.underline}, with **[centuries-long
experience]{.underline}**. [Reportedly, a Finnish **shipyard** can build
and deliver a **polar-class icebreaker** within **24 months** once the
contract has been signe]{.underline}d. Over the past years, Finland has
delivered cutters for South Africa, Australia, Argentina, and even
Russia. Moscow has subcontracted several cutters to Finland, including
the Project 21900M cutter Murmansk. In October 2022, the Finnish
Ministry of Foreign Affairs blocked Helsinki Shipyard's delivery of a
new environmentally-friendly icebreaker to the Russian company Norilsk
Nickel[. **Could** **Helsinki** also **"break the ice" for the U.S.
Coast Guard?**]{.underline}

The option for Washington to buy Finnish-built polar cutters has already
been. In 2017, Finnish Consul General in the U.S. Stefan Lindstrom
suggested [Finland could help the U.S. solve this problem]{.underline}.
"[The U.S. is now in dire straits about its own icebreaker
fleet.]{.underline} They only have two and they are both seriously
outdated. We can help," he said. [Lindstrom criticized the seeming fact
that U.S. officials were more prone to buy domestic-built cutters at
much higher prices rather than Finnish-built ones at around one-fifth of
domestic prices.]{.underline} Finland's most capable polar icebreaker,
the **[LNG-powered Polaris]{.underline}**, cost **[around \$150
million]{.underline}**, and it [**took less than two years** to build
from when its first steel was cut to when it was handed over to the
Finnish Transport Agency.]{.underline}

On the contrary, [U**.S. designers and shipbuilders** **lack** the
**experience** with **designing** and **construction** held by their
Finnish counterparts]{.underline}. As a result, the [U.S. Polar Security
Cutter]{.underline} program has [experienced]{.underline} an
"**[extended design phase"]{.underline}** which will result in [a
three-year schedule delay and is **expected** to **cost** "at least
\$**11.6 billion for acquisition, operations and
maintenance**]{.underline}", according to latest reports[. For half
**that price**, Finnish **shipyards** could **build an entire fleet of

thirds]{.underline}** of the total [number of active
icebreakers]{.underline} today have been [**built or designed** by
the]{.underline} [Nordic "**icebreaker superpower**" should make a
compelling case in and of itself]{.underline}. [Finland]{.underline}
[could help the U.S. build a fleet of decent numbers in less time and at

Throughout previous decades, numerous incidents have highlighted the
dangers ice poses for ships transiting polar waters, especially cruise
ships, cargo ships, and warships. [When a vessel is not designed to
operate in an environment as challenging as the Arctic, misfortunes will
occur.]{.underline} In 2021 and 2022, several [ships]{.underline} were
[stranded]{.underline} [along the **N**]{.underline}orthern
**[S]{.underline}**ea **[R]{.underline}**oute [due to the lack of
icebreakers escorting them]{.underline}. Such situations could keep
worsening during the following years, as activity in the region keeps
growing.

Icebreakers are specially designed ships prepared to operate and
navigate across polar regions where other ships cannot, and they remain
an essential geopolitical instrument to clear trade routes of ice and
provide year-round access to the region (both for commercial and
security purposes). [Russia, with the biggest fleet in the world, is
well aware of this. Among the more than 40 vessels it currently
operates, a dozen of them are nuclear-powered (the only ones in the
world). And more are on their way.]{.underline}

The [third unit of the newest Arktika-class icebreaker, the Ural,
entered service in late 2022]{.underline}, with four more units to
follow by 2028. Additionally, [construction is currently underway for
the first and only unit of the Leader-class icebreake]{.underline}r, the
Rossiya, which will be 209 meters long and weigh close to 70,000 tons.
Until the cancellation of the remaining units due to budgetary
constraints, it was set to become the largest and most capable class
ever built. [This impressive **quest** to **build** the biggest
icebreaker **fleet** in the world by far, which has been **decades in
the making**]{.underline}, is a [massive statement of the importance
Moscow attaches to holding control of its Arctic backyard.]{.underline}

[China has also increased its regional involvement]{.underline}, with
[strong aspirations to develop its own Polar Silk Route along the
Russian Arctic littorals.]{.underline} Beijing currently has **[two
operational icebreakers]{.underline}** [--- Xue Long 1 and Xue Long
2]{.underline} --- and began construction of a **[third unit in June
2023]{.underline}** which is said to allow China to send researchers to
explore the Arctic seabed. Chinese cutters will help fulfill its
regional economic ambitions, supporting mining and energy projects and
other infrastructure currently being built. [Just as its Russian
partner, Beijing is committed to securing its position in the future of
Arctic affairs, recently proven by a combined patrol of Chinese and
Russian warships close to Alaska in August 2023.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, the [world's top maritime power is struggling to build a
fleet of cutters that can satisfy its current operational needs in the
High North.]{.underline} The U.S. Coast Guard currently operates the
heavy polar icebreaker Polar Star and the medium polar icebreaker Healy,
plus an additional heavy polar cutter which has been out of service
since 2010. Yet the [**U.S. Coast Guard's** latest **report** to
Congress stresses the U.S. will "**likely need eight to nine new
icebreakers**" to perform its different, future missions.]{.underline}

**[Reaching that number of vessels will likely take
decades]{.underline}**. [Plans to build three additional heavy polar
cutters with the Polar Security Cutter program will raise the total
number to five units]{.underline}. Unfortunately, [**delivery of the
first unit** "may **now occur no earlier than 2028**," and the
47-year-old Polar Star]{.underline} "is on borrowed time." [Considering
this, **Washington should seriously consider looking elsewhere to find
an alternative.**]{.underline}

[Polar icebreakers are expensive and complex]{.underline}, and the [U.S.
hasn't built one since the Polar Star]{.underline}. The U.S. awarded a
[contract to build a new heavy icebreaker]{.underline}, the Polar
Sentinel, in 2019. The first of three new planned ice breakers, [it
isn't expected to be finished until after 2030.]{.underline} The
Congressional Budget Office estimates that the cost for the three ships
will reach \$5.1 billion, 60% higher than original projections.

The U.S. [icebreaker program has fallen so far behind Russia partly
because the Arctic faded as a U.S. priority after the Cold
War]{.underline}. That began to change around a decade ago, said Rebecca
Pincus , director of the Polar Institute at the Wilson Center, a
Washington-based think tank.

But [momentum on building icebreakers has been hampered by the Coast
Guard's **small budgets**]{.underline} and lack of political power, said
Pincus, who has worked on Arctic policy at the Coast Guard and the
Defense Department. The Coast Guard has moved from department to
department before most recently becoming a part of Homeland Security.

"[Ice breaking was very far away from the Homeland Security focus after
9/11]{.underline}," she said.

[Russia has maintained greater focus on the region in recent
decades]{.underline}, in large part because the [country's economy
depends on it.]{.underline} The Arctic accounts for over 80% of Russia's
natural-gas production and around 20% of its crude-oil production,
according to the International Energy Agency. The world's largest nickel
producer is based in a former Russian Arctic gulag. [Russia has been
opening the Northern Sea Route , which connects Asia to Europe, to move
these raw materials to markets and develop offshore energy
fields]{.underline}.

[America's ability to catch up is **hampered by a domestic shipbuilding
crisis**.]{.underline} In the past three years, China has built 47% of
all the world's ships , and the U.S. just 0.1%, according to United
Nations data. [The lack of commercial shipbuilding means there are few
established domestic supply chains for naval vessels]{.underline}, which
are routinely built late and over budget in [shipyards suffering from
recruitment shortages, high costs, a lack of investment]{.underline} and
other issues.

Mika Nieminen , the chief executive of Rauma Marine Constructions, a
Finnish shipyard that makes icebreakers, said there [is a lot of
interest in icebreakers but not many shipyards that can make
them]{.underline}.

"The capacity will be the question---where are they going to be made,"
he said.

[Few shipyards have expertise on how ships react in winter conditions
and behave on the ice]{.underline}, he said. [Many don't have experience
working with the **thickness of the steel**]{.underline} required for
icebreakers, which has to be able to resist fractures in extremely low
temperatures.

The company that is building the Coast Guard's new Polar
icebreaker---Bollinger Shipyards, based in Lockport, La.---had to invest
\$20 million in facilities and infrastructure to make the vessel after
taking over construction from another company it had bought. That
company---VT Halter Marine, based in Pascagoula, Miss.---had racked up
more than a quarter billion dollars in losses on the project without
starting construction.

[A number of shipyards in the U.S. have closed since 1976, when the
Polar Star was built]{.underline}, including the ones that built that
icebreaker and the Healy. Many senior shipyard workers from that era
have retired.

"If we're [building icebreakers every 30 years, all the know-how goes
away]{.underline}," said Åke Rohlén , who ran the icebreaking divisions
of several commercial shippers and is now at Arctic Marine Solutions.

Ice is extremely dangerous to ships. In northern climates, especially in
the Baltic and North Seas, history is replete with accidents and even
total loss incidents due to ice.

Ice hazards can take many forms, from ships hitting ice to ice hitting
ships (i.e. due to waves driving ice into the hulls). At other times,
ships can become trapped in ice fields and become subject to friction
and pressure from ever increasing ice loads which will challenge the
endurance of even the toughest-built hulls. In extreme situations of
this kind, even icebreakers can be brought to a stand-still.

Finland\'s state-owned icebreaking company, Arctia, must contend with
demanding and challenging conditions like this. Will Arctia\'s new
icebreaker, the Polaris, be the next generation icebreaker that
commercial navigation needs in the Baltic Sea to ensure that the
shipping lanes are free?

I was given a thorough look at Polaris\' capabilities at the CIMAC World
Congress on June 6, 2016, in Helsinki. Arctech Helsinki Shipyard,
Arctia, the Finnish Transport Agency, ILS, Lamor and the Finnish Marine
Industries are working together to build the icebreaker which is fitted
with the latest technology and which will offer performance superior to
existing Urho-class icebreakers.

One of the [[most important]{.mark} [features]{.mark} of the
[Polaris]{.mark} is the use of [dual-fuel engines]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Deploying an [LNG]{.mark} [engine]{.mark} in an icebreaker of this kind
is a [world first]{.mark}, and through the use of LNG fuel, the
[Polaris]{.mark} is claimed to be the **[most environmentally friendly
icebreaker ever built]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The [dual fuel setup is
intended to reduce both fuel costs and [**minimize exhaust
emissions**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

and operated by Arctia Ltd, a Finnish state-owned company[. Polaris is
built primarily for assistance services in the Baltic Sea, in addition
to oil spill response operations.]{.underline}

The [vessel is [equipped]{.mark} with **[four Low Pressure Dual

#### LNG meets every internationally regulated climate requirement. 

**Flex LNG** **ND**. FLEX LNG is a shipping company focused on
transporting liquefied natural gas (LNG) across the globe. They own and

designed to move LNG safely and efficiently. \"2-Stroke Propulsion --
FLEX LNG,\" FLEX LNG, https://www.flexlng.com/2-stroke-propulsion/.

The [LNG carrier Fleet and introduction of the Two-Stroke Propulsion for
LNG Carriers]{.underline}

[LNG carriers have been built since 1964]{.underline}. Up to 2010, [LNG
carriers were generally constructed with steam turbines for
propulsion.]{.underline} While these [vessels still make up a large part
of the flee]{.underline}t, they have [a cost disadvantage to modern
vessels due to higher fuel consumption.]{.underline} Starting around
2002, [owners started building LNG carriers with dual fuel diesel
engines or tri fuel diesel engines,]{.underline} making up the bulk of
the current modern tonnage. Starting around 2012, engine makers started
offering engines with slow speed two stroke engines referred to as MEGI
(high pressure) or X-DF (low pressure), being specifically made for
ships propelled by gas.

Owners currently have the choice of two different engine solutions for
two-stroke, low speed propulsion for LNGC vessels: MEGI, by MAN Diesel
and Turbo, and X-DF, by WinGD (previously Wärtsilä).

The MEGI Engine -- High Pressure Gas Injection

The MEGI diesel engine, developed and marketed by MAN Marine Engines and
Systems, applies the principle of non-premixed combustion (the Diesel
principle). The first LNG MEGI vessel was delivered in 2016.

The dual-fuel two-stroke engine is based on the combustion principle of
operating on Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) or Marine Diesel Oil (MDO) together
with high-pressure natural gas, where the fuel is injected and burned
directly as opposed to the premixed or Otto-cycle combustion. In brief,
two or three gas fuel valves inject high-pressure natural gas to the
combustion chamber and to ensure an optimally controlled combustion, a
small amount of pilot oil is injected simultaneous with the natural gas
via two or three conventional fuel oil injectors.

The MEGI engine is equipped with additional safety systems that ensure a
safe operation on gas without requiring rupture discs in the scavenge
air receiver, the exhaust gas receiver, and in the exhaust gas piping.

Owners and operators are provided with maximum fuel flexibility and,
depending on the relative price and availability of gas and fuel oil,
are free to choose the most competitive fuel as the engine operates with
the same efficiency on both gas and fuel. The Diesel-cycle ensures
stable gas combustion under all weather conditions, such as heavy
weather and high ambient temperatures, without any risk of misfiring or
knocking.

All qualities of LNG can be burned with the same high efficiency, and
the engine has no specific requirement to the methane number. The dual
fuel engine can operate on natural gas in the load range from 10% to
100% load. Furthermore, depending on the fuel availability on board, the
engine can combust any ratio of natural gas and HFO/MDO. The MEGI engine
is ignited on diesel, and changeover to gas operation can take place at
10% engine load. Both HFO and MDO can be used as pilot fuel.

Another advantage of gas-fuelled tonnage is the ability to adjust
operation according to the changing fuel prices and exhaust-emission
limits. Service experience shows that the MEGI engine delivers
significant reductions in CO2, NOx and SOx emissions.

MEGI vessels generate negligible methane slip during gas operation
making it the most environmentally-friendly technology available. The
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, including methane slip, has been
found to be 22% lower compared to fuel oil.

[The X-DF Technology: Low Pressure Gas Injection]{.underline}

Inview of the increasing demand for low-speed, [dual-fuel engines, WinGD
developed the lean burn Otto combustion process with low-pressure gas
admission and micro-pilot ignition for its two-stroke engine
portfolio.]{.underline} The first LNG X-DF vessel was delivered in 2017.

[The [low-pressure dual-fuel technology,]{.mark} known as the X engine
series, is a further development of the Wärtsilä's well-proven
medium-speed dual-fuel engines.]{.underline} In contrast to
high-pressure gas injection engines, which operate on the Diesel cycle,
[WinGD's low pressure X-DF engines [work on]{.mark} the Otto cycle when
operated in [gas]{.mark} mode -- i.e. ignition of a compressed lean
air/gas mixture by injection of a very small amount of liquid pilot
fuel.]{.underline}

The [gas distribution and admission system have been specifically
designed for the requirements of the two-stroke engine]{.underline}. The
gas is supplied and [distributed in gas manifolds, along both sides of
the engine, to feed gas to each cylinder]{.underline}. Two hydraulically
actuated Gas Admission Valves ([GAV]{.underline}) inject gas directly
into each cylinder through the cylinder's liner wall. Since the gas is
injected at the beginning of compression, depending on the selected
rating point, a low gas pressure feed of 10-13 barg is sufficient to
achieve a homogenous air/gas mixture, even at full engine load.

In the latest generation of X-DF engines, [the [gas feed]{.mark} is
[regulated]{.mark} by the built-on engine integrated gas pressure
regulating unit (iGPR) which gives greater freedom to optimise the
engine room design, enabling significant savings on space, steel
construction, ventilation, cabling]{.underline} -- effectively driving
down the vessel price further. This is achievable thanks to the
introduction of the iGPR which replaces the need for a dedicated
compartment for an open type gas valve unit (GVU) or enclosed type GVU.

The [WinGD X-DF engines [meets the regulations of IMO's Tier III NOx
limits]{.mark} in gas mode in ECA by considerable margins without any
additional exhaust gas abatement measures such as EGR or
SCR]{.underline}.

With [[liquid fuel consumption]{.mark} for pilot ignition [below 1% of

0.5% global cap]{.mark} [on]{.mark} [sulphur]{.mark} in marine
fuels]{.underline} proposed to become effective January 2020.

The [[particulate matter emissions on X-DF engines]{.mark} is reduced to
almost [zero]{.mark}, and the [CO2 emissions]{.mark}, inherent to
burning natural gas, are **[further reduced]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The

container ship sailing on the Arctic Sea: Economic and emission
assessment" Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361920920307434

This study discusses the [economic feasibility and potential CO2
emission reduction for a container service using LNG-fuelled ships on
the NSR]{.underline} (named "LN"), benchmarking oil-fuelled shipping on
the SCR (named "OS"), or on the NSR (named "ON"). We assume that
Sabetta, the gate-port of Yamal LNG, can be developed into an LNG
refuelling centre. The option LN is economically feasible only if it has
the highest AVSP among the three options.

We establish a [profit model for estimating the shipping profit of a
container service, and an emission model for calculating CO2
emission]{.underline}. The real data of the ships, route information,
and bunker prices are collected and applied to the models. To address
the complexities in reality, [multiple scenarios are proposed and
analysed by considering variations in the factors]{.underline},
including seven levels of ship sizes deployed on the NSR, and three
levels of the length of round-trip times. The results of this empirical
study reveal the following findings:

\(1\)

[Smaller ships make LN more advantageous over ON by curbing the capital
and operating costs]{.underline} but make it more disadvantageous
against OS, in which economies of scale in ship size are achieved by
larger ships. Given round-trip transit time and bunker prices, an
[optimal ship size for the option LN exists.]{.underline}

\(2\)

[A shorter round-trip transit time can make the option LN more
economically feasible because a shorter round-trip transit time is in
line with a faster ship speed]{.underline} that substantially increases
the fuel consumption. In addition, it leads to lower capital and
operating costs because of shorter voyage times. For LN, its advantage
in fuel cost offsets its loss in capital and operating cost.

\(3\)

In the current circumstance, the option LN is hardly economically
feasible, unless the round-trip transit time is 70 days. The additional
cost of an LNG-fuelled ship and the detour to the proposed Sabetta LNG
refuelling centre make this option less competitive.

\(4\)

[LN can reduce CO2 emission significantly]{.underline} against OS.
Practically, [the option LN can reduce CO2 emission by 0.174 to 0.358
tonne per TEU]{.underline} (or 45.5%--63%) [against OS when it is
economically feasible.]{.underline}

Icebreakers on Northern Sea Route" High North News
https://www.highnorthnews.com/en/new-powerful-arc7-lng-carriers-could-eliminate-need-icebreakers-northern-sea-route

[Finnish icebreaker designer Aker Arctic]{.underline}, the company
behind many historic and recent icebreaking ship designs,
[announced]{.underline} today that together with Daewoo Shipbuilding &
Marine Engineering (DSME) of South Korea, the leading shipyard for
constructing ice-capable LNG tankers, it has developed a more [powerful
second generation ice-breaking Arc7 LNG carrier]{.underline}.

The vessels will transport LNG for Novatek's Arctic LNG 2 project.

DSME will build six new second generation Arc7 carriers, three each for
Russian shipping operator Sovcomflot and Japan's Mitsui O.S.K. Before
construction begins Aker will confirm "improved operational capability"
during ice model tests in its ice laboratory in Helsinki.

New hull shape and more power

In contrast to the first 15 Arc7 carriers in service since 2017, the new
[version will feature a new hull form and more power
engines]{.underline}. These new features will reduce or [potentially
**eliminate the need for icebreaker escort** along Russia's Northern Sea
Route]{.underline} and may allow these LNG carriers to navigate along
the route independently for much of the year.

Compared to the first generation Arc7 carriers the [new type will have
**increased power output** of 6MW for a total of 51MW almost in line
with the 60MW]{.underline} of Russia's latest generation of
nuclear-powered icebreakers of the Arktika class.

"The new [icebreaking LNG carriers are tailored to the transportation
needs of Novatek's new Arctic LNG 2 project, with special **emphasis on
year-round operation**]{.underline} in the eastern sector of the
Northern Sea Route," explains Reko-Antti Suojanen, Managing Director at
Aker Arctic Arctic Technology in a press release.

The eastern part of the NSR, specifically the East Siberian Sea is where
ice conditions are most challenging during the winter months.

"This [propulsion system is expected to provide new vessels with
increased speed and manoeuvrability]{.underline} when sailing in ice
conditions, compared with icebreaking LNG carriers of the previous
generation," also confirms Sovcomflot's President and CEO Igor
Tonkovidov.

The [Arctic LNG 2 plant, currently under construction on Russia's Gydan
peninsula, will be Novatek's second LNG project in the
Arctic]{.underline}. Its first, Yamal LNG, opened in 2017. Both projects
rely on a fleet of Arc7 LNG carriers to transport LNG to the markets in
Europe and Asia.

New Arc7 for winter operations to Asia

[Novatek's logistic operation consists of icebreaking LNG
carriers,]{.underline} future transshipment hubs at each terminus of the
Northern Sea Route, and conventional LNG carriers to transport the LNG
onwards to Asia and Europe.

Travel in an eastward direction to Asia is more challenging during the
winter months when thicker ice blocks the shipping lanes.

Earlier this year, Novatek and its shipping partners conducted a test
voyage at the end of May to test the first-generation Arc7 vessels'
capabilities during thick winter ice. The voyage came almost two months
earlier than similar voyages during previous years.

And while the [Arc7 carriers had **nuclear icebreaker escorts** for part
of the voyage, the tankers proved so capable that **independent
navigation without icebreaker assistance appeared
feasible**]{.underline} according to experts.

One would think that the days of icebreakers escorting ships in convoy
would be over.

Lawson Brigham, Professor of Geography & Arctic Policy at the University
of Alaska Fairbanks

[Officially the goal of the new vessels is to increase transit speeds
and improve the overall efficiency of the transportation
system]{.underline}, according to Aker. However, unofficially industry
experts confirm to High North News that the additional power and the
improved hull shape of the new Arc7 carriers, may enable year-round
travel to markets in Asia, even without icebreaker escorts.

Less need for icebreakers?

This development also raises questions about the long-term need for the
new nuclear icebreakers currently under construction in Russia and
designed for a lifespan of 30-40 years.

[In addition to five nuclear icebreakers of the Arktika class also known
as the LK60 type]{.underline}, the most powerful icebreaker ever built,
the country recently began construction of the first of three planned
LK100 nuclear icebreakers -- a super icebreaker nearly twice as powerful
as the LK60.

Originally the planned role for the LK100s was to keep open the East
Siberian Sea during winter and escort the LNG carriers along this
section en route to Asia. [According to shipping experts familiar with
the second generation Arc7 carrier, there may no longer be a need for
LK100 icebreakers if the new Arc7 carriers prove as capable as
envisioned]{.underline}.

"With these new technologically advanced LNG carriers one would think
that the [days of icebreakers escorting ships in convoy would be
over,]{.underline}" confirms Lawson Brigham, Professor of Geography &
Arctic Policy at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.

[Finland is **optimistic** that it will be able to get around
long-standing regulatory barriers to **build** **icebreakers for the
US**]{.underline} as part of President Donald Trump's [efforts to **beef
up its Arctic security presence.**]{.underline}

[Reko-Antti Suojanen]{.underline}, a former [shipbuilding executive who
leads Finland's co-operation with the US on icebreakers,]{.underline}
told the Financial Times that after many years of fruitless talks, [he
was **hopeful** of a **breakthrough** **thanks to Trump's
interest.**]{.underline}

[**Trump** has **bemoaned** his country's **lack of icebreakers** as
geopolitical competition heats up in the frozen north: the US has just
two, while Russia boasts about 40.]{.underline}

[The US coastguard currently has three large icebreakers on order but
they are delayed by at least five years and have run heavily over
budget]{.underline}. Under American law, [all ships for the navy and
coastguard are required to be built domestically.]{.underline}

The previous icebreaker made in the US was built in the 1970s.

["While the President is prioritising shipbuilding in America,
**immediate presence** in the **Arctic** is in the **best interest of
our national security**. We are **working with our ally Finland to
expedite this process**," a White House official said.]{.underline}

[Finland is the world's leading manufacturer of icebreakers and signed a
deal in March to produce one such vessel for Canada.]{.underline}

["Our industry would be **very keen** to **sell** new **icebreakers to
the United States**]{.underline}, as to any other buyer. It's a special
knowhow that we have[ . . . We are trying to open the gap in a way that
exceptions could be made and Finnish shipyards could build icebreakers
for the United States]{.underline}," said Suojanen.

Maritime experts say the US president could issue a waiver to the ban on
constructing navy or coastguard vessels in foreign shipyards to secure
the ships, which would be used to patrol the Arctic.

[Trump himself alluded to the ban this week when he discussed buying
icebreakers from Finland and added: "I didn't go to Congress --- they'll
try and impeach me".]{.underline}

The US president said that as well as new icebreakers, he was also
discussing buying one currently in service for Finland. He added that it
was "old, like five, six years' old" and that he had offered a third of
what Helsinki wanted. "They make them really good, and they know what
they're doing," he added.

[Suojanen confirmed there were discussions about selling a used
icebreaker, but said Finland was not selling Polaris, its newest vessel,
built in 2016.]{.underline}

"It's the fastest way to get one. The problem is that Finland does not
have additional icebreakers," he said, adding that Finland had its own
programme for building new icebreakers to replace its existing fleet,
but that this was moving slowly.

Discussions on purchasing icebreakers from Finland started in Trump's
first presidency from 2017 until 2021 but did not come to fruition.

[However, **Trump's interest in strengthening** America's **Arctic
security** appears **stronger** in his second term, including his
persistent desire to take control over Greenland from Nato ally
Denmark.]{.underline}

The [US coastguard intends to order three medium-sized icebreakers in
the near term]{.underline}. On that, Suojanen said[**: "**If the
icebreakers are needed fast, they have to be built in Finland. I don't
think there's a yard in the US at the moment that's able to build
icebreakers quickly."]{.underline}

\"U.S. Coast Guard Sees Interest from Finnish, Canadian Yards for Arctic
Security Cutter,\" USNI News,
https://news.usni.org/2025/04/22/u-s-coast-guard-sees-interest-from-finnish-canadian-yards-for-arctic-security-cutter.
苗

The U.S[. Coast Guard's quest to buy a new fleet of icebreakers has
drawn interest from both domestic and international
shipyards]{.underline} as the service collects responses to a request
for proposal due this week.

Earlier this month, the [Coast Guard put out a request for information
from a wide group of shipbuilders seeking designs for the proposed
Arctic Security Cutter program.]{.underline}

The [new cutters need to break through three feet of ice and have a
range of 6,500 nautical miles with an endurance of 60 days]{.underline},
according to the RFI. The medium icebreaker will work in parallel with
the larger Polar Security Cutter program currently underway at Bollinger
Mississippi Shipbuilding.

"The Coast Guard is conducting the widest survey of the market to inform
future acquisition activities. The Coast Guard is committed to
delivering critical assets to meet the needs in the U.S. Arctic as
expeditiously as possible in compliance with federal law and direction
from the legislative branch," a service spokesperson told USNI News this
week.

USNI News reported earlier that funding for the first three Arctic
Security Cutters was included the budget reconciliation bill that
cleared Congress in March.

Since the call for information went out, Finnish and Canadian shipyards
have expressed interest for the work,

Rauma Marine Constructions is a possible shipyard to build the new
cutters, according to local press reports. Likewise, Finland's Helsinki
Shipyard --- owned by Canadian shipbuilder Davie --- is also a candidate
for the work, USNI News understands.

Finland is a world leader in icebreaking design, as well as
construction, the Wilson Center said in a report.

"With an often-cited fact that 80% of the world's icebreakers are
designed by Finnish firms and more than 60% of icebreakers are built in
Finnish shipyards. This hard-earned knowledge has made Finland a global
authority in the icebreaker industry and it now seeks to share its
know-how via the ICE Pact--a trilateral partnership between the United
States, Canada, and Finland," according to the report.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio met with Foreign Minister Elina Valtonen
to discuss Finland's icebreaker-building capacity and other
international security topics the day before the request from the Coast
Guard went out.

Late last month, following a daylong meeting with the Finnish president,
President Donald Trump posted on his social media platform the talks
also included "the purchase and development of a large number of badly
needed Icebreakers for the U.S., delivering Peace and International
Security for our Countries, and the World."

In November, the U.S., Canada and Finland signed a memorandum of
understanding "to begin working together to develop world-class Arctic
and polar icebreakers through the exchange of knowledge, information,
and resources" in the three nations.

Helsinki Shipyard's parent, Québec-based Davie, also could be in the
running for the proposed Arctic Security Cutters. Davie announced last
summer that it was looking to partner with U.S. firms to gain a foothold
in the American market for shipbuilding and repair. The company also
signed two contracts to expand its Québec yard to attract more orders
for the specialized construction of ships such as icebreakers and
ferries and upgrading Canada's surface fleet.

The company is already one of several contractors building seven
Canadian icebreakers to meet the requirements of Ottawa's latest Arctic
strategy.

Canada or Finland would need a presidential waiver for the U.S. Coast
Guard to buy ships from a foreign yard, according to Title 14 of the
U.S. Code.

[For the Bering Sea region and the North, [the Port of Nome]{.mark}
represents potential infrastructure that can host significant deterrence
capabilities.]{.underline} [In an extreme sense, [the primary purpose of
the US military is the deterrence of conflict]{.mark}, but if and when
confronted, [to engage and win]{.mark} under terms acceptable to the
United States and its allies]{.underline}.29 For more common purposes,
deterrence can also impact the potential of criminal activity, such as
illegal, unregulated, and unreported (IUU) fishing, which represents a
persistent security threat in the Arctic maritime region.

[Militarily, one [definition of deterrence is \"to reduce the
probability of enemy military attack]{.mark} by posing a sufficient
prospect of suffering a net loss as a result, or at least a higher net
loss / lower net gain resulting from no attack.\"30]{.underline} While
not all experts accept any particular definition, most agree on similar
aspects of the well-grounded logic involving a distinction between
deterrence by denial (defense) and deterrence by punishment
(retaliation). [Regardless, the goal of deterrence is to stop an adverse
action before it occurs. One of the strongest, most enduring forms of
deterrence in history (aside from mutually assured destruction) involves
the principle of collective defense, enshrined in Article 5 of the
Washington Treaty, which established NATO]{.underline}. In the Arctic,
four out of the five littoral nations are founding members of NATO, with
the other being the Russian Federation -- and Russia largely detests the
Euro-Atlantic alliance.

[Elliott explains that deterrence refers to how \"knowledge of the
sanction affects perception of the cost of offending so that compliance
is seen as more attractive than offending \... the most important
considerations of deterrence-related punishment involve severity,
swiftness, and certainty of punishment,\" and unlike other mechanisms,
[the threat of punishment must always be present]{.mark}]{.underline}.31
Much like the European Deterrence Initiative,32 established in 2014 as a
result of Russian aggression, [[an established Arctic presence]{.mark}
provides further justification and rationale [for the continued
development of the Pacific Deterrence Initiative]{.mark} -- especially
the role of port infrastructure.]{.underline}

Nome is a regional transportation, logistical, and economic hub for
Northwest Alaska, and is strategically positioned to provide sustained
services and access to the Arctic on both local and national levels, to
include defense infrastructure such as the North Warning System. The
Port of Nome is only 125 nautical miles from the Bering Strait and the
convergence of the Arctic shipping lanes, most notably, the Northern Sea
Route along Russia's north coast and Canada's Northwest Passage.
[[As]{.mark} the [sea ice continues to recede]{.mark}, [increased
maritime traffic through the Bering Strait will drive responses to
security concerns]{.mark} and requirements for a deep-draft Arctic port
system. Security concerns rather than economic factors will drive the
analysis from a regional economic view to one in favour of national
security]{.underline}. In either case, the Port of Nome is constrained
by its draft and the onshore infrastructure required to sustainably host
large commercial resupply vessels and security response vessels such as
USCG icebreakers and naval ships. Icebreaking capability is critical to
extending the seasonal use of the port and the region in general, with
the Port of Nome currently iced in for up to six months annually[. [A
meaningful defense posture in the region]{.mark}, as called for in
strategy and the NDAA, [requires a deep-draft Arctic port system]{.mark}
to forward-base the agile response capabilities and logistical support
systems needed to sustain operatio]{.underline}ns. [[The Navy's Strategy
for the Arctic calls for an integrated approach]{.mark} to security
operations that includes Naval and US Coast Guard deepwater and
littoral-capable forces]{.underline}. The strategy calls for an enhanced
presence and access to infrastructure capacity to meet this approach.
[[A deep-draft port]{.mark} in Nome [would]{.mark} logistically
[enable]{.mark} sustained [logistical support to]{.mark} the
[deepwater]{.mark} Naval and Coast Guard [vessels]{.mark}, and bring -
albeit to a limited degree - the shore-based maintenance, logistics, and
training required for the littoral operational strategy]{.underline}.
With the multi-year sea ice interface projected to move northward in the
future, a deepwater port at Nome, sustaining operations, surveillance,
and monitoring given its proximity to the Bering Strait, would enhance
timely response to national security issues as the Arctic's maritime
traffic increases. Improvements to the Port of Nome would reduce
reach-back logistics and increase the operational sustainability
required for all-season security and defense operations

[[The forward presence of forces provides a means]{.mark} by which [to
instill]{.mark} and support [regional stability, as well as impose
deterrence via]{.mark} punishment or [denial]{.mark}]{.underline}.24
[[Traditionally, sea ice has kept]{.mark} presence [concerns]{.mark}
relatively [negligible]{.mark}. [However, recent changes]{.mark}
throughout the Arctic region and maritime surface [represent new
challenges and opportunities]{.mark}, some of [which drive the need for
the forward presence]{.mark} of military forces]{.underline}. A key
component that not only helps to support sustained freedom of navigation
capabilities, but that also enables forward presence and force
protection, [[often involves sea basing]{.underline}]{.mark}. According
to the DoD joint concept, \'sea basing\' is defined as:

\...[[the rapid deployment]{.mark}, assembly, command, projection,
reconstitution, and re-employment [of joint combat power from the
sea]{.mark}]{.underline}, while providing continuous support,
sustainment, and force protection to select expeditionary joint forces
without reliance on land bases within the Joint Operations Area (JOA).
These capabilities expand operational maneuver options, and facilitate
assured access and entry from the sea.25

Alternatively, Tangredi offers a broader definition, stating that \"sea
basing refers to the capability to use the sea in the same way that U.S.
forces use overseas regional bases, for deterrence, alliance support,
cooperative security, power projection, and other forward
operations.\"26 [[Traditionally, forward presence provides a critical
role throughout the globe]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Shunk et al. explain
that while deterrence requires capacity, communication, capability, and
will, [physical presence conveys both commitment and
intentionality]{.mark}]{.underline}.27 An improved deepwater Port of
Nome would represent the foundational infrastructure from which numerous
Arctic operational capabilities could be realized, in direct support of
national defense and security requirements. Without it, maritime
presence generally remains limited to (over)extended forward
deployments. Perhaps most telling, the recent US Tri-Service Maritime
Strategy provides an even stronger rationale, stating that:

[We cannot cede influence in areas of emerging day-to-day competition,
including U.S. regional waters and the Arctic]{.underline}. [The coming
decades will bring changes to the Arctic region that will have a
significant impact on the global economy, given its abundance of natural
resources and strategic location. [China views this region as a critical
link in their One Belt One Road initiative]{.mark}. [Arctic nations are
reopening old]{.mark} [bases]{.mark}, moving forces, and reinvigorating
regional exercises. [These trends will persist in the decades
ahead]{.mark}. We must continue to operate forward and posture our
forces appropriately]{.underline}

[[Arctic operations suffer from the tyranny of distance and
time]{.mark}, with the nearest deepwater port of Dutch Harbor being over
600 nautical miles to the south of Nome, and the Departments of Defense
and Homeland Security installations of Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson,
Eielson Air Force Base (AFB), and United States Coast Guard (USCG) Air
Station Kodiak being 450-550 nautical miles to the west]{.underline} and
southwest. Congress and the Department of Defense (DoD) recognized the
logistical impacts of not having forward-based capabilities as a 2020
NDAA "Item of Special Interest," with Arctic search and rescue (SAR)
calling for "forward-deployed/based assets in a sustainable location."
The [2021 NDAA further states the [need for maritime power projection
and presence]{.mark}, emphasizing search and rescue and infrastructure
development for maritime defense. [The lack of a deepwater port]{.mark}
and coastal infrastructure in the region [limits sustainable US power
projection]{.mark} above the Arctic Circle [and the ability to host or
sustain USCG]{.mark} icebreakers, naval vessels, and other forward-based
sea and air [assets]{.mark}. [Having forward-deployed and]{.mark}
logistically [sustained forces]{.mark} at Nome [will substantially
decrease response time]{.mark} in the northern Bering, Chukchi, and
Beaufort Seas. For USCG vessels sailing from Kodiak, transit time alone
is seven days, preventing timely all-season response to emergency and
security incidents.]{.underline} Seasonal logistical constraints
impacting maritime resupply due to sea ice formation and winter storms
currently impose a limiting factor on sustained forward-based maritime
power projection in the Bering Sea/Bering Strait and the North Slope of
Alaska's Arctic region.  

[[In the Arctic "logistics]{.mark} - the procurement, maintenance and

"effective sustainment \... and means to enable \[the\] freedom of

power into the Arctic through the various domains. [[Currently]{.mark},
[physical constraints and the seasonal sea ice build-up limit the
Port]{.mark} of Nome in terms of the size and draft of the marine
vessels able to utilize it economically and sustainably. USCG
icebreakers, critical to sustained operations in the Arctic, cannot use
the Port of Nome in its current state. [The ability to conduct]{.mark}

[[The United States has no]{.mark} major [deep-water port]{.mark} from
Dutch Harbor in the Aleutian Islands to the U.S.-Canada border in the
Beaufort Sea, a region defined [in]{.mark} federal law as the U.S.
maritime [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. [**[This presents a major
strategic challenge for the nation]{.mark}**. The distance by sea from
Dutch Harbor to Prudhoe Bay, located on Alaska's North Slope, is 1,535
nautical miles---along a remote and shallow coastline with few
deep-water areas.]{.underline} There is no safe harbor along the entire
western and northern coasts of Alaska where a major combatant, Coast
Guard icebreaker (or large cutter), NOAA survey ship, or any other
deep-draft government or commercial ship can moor alongside a wharf.

[[The absence of a deep-draft Arctic port]{.mark} and associated marine
infrastructure [is a glaring gap]{.mark} in the United States' ability
to respond to greater marine access and activity at the top of the
world]{.underline}. [[Every other Arctic coastal
state]{.underline}]{.mark}, including Canada, Iceland, Denmark
(Greenland), Norway, and Russia, [[has at least one
port]{.underline}]{.mark} where a large, deep-draft ship, such as a
commercial resupply carrier or naval vessel, can safely moor during
Arctic operations.

Conferences and stakeholder meetings have been held since 2008 on the
need for developing a set of U.S. ports in the Alaskan Arctic. The focus
of these efforts and a major assessment released in 2013---the Alaska
Deep-Draft Arctic Port System Study, led by the U.S. Army Corp of
Engineers and Alaska state transportation department---has been on
future regional and state economic benefits from the global export of
Alaska's natural resources.

One of the limitations for potential deep-water ports in Arctic Alaska
is the lack of road and rail connections from the coast to the interior
and major cities such as Fairbanks and Anchorage. Another constraint is
the December-to-May sea ice cover in the northern reaches of the U.S.
maritime Arctic.

The Port System Study identified 11 potential coastal sites for a
deep-water port, with four locations selected for further study: Nome,
Port Clarence (a deep-water site north of Nome), Cape Darby (a
deep-water site south of Nome), and Utqiagvik (Barrow, the northernmost
U.S. city). Nome and Port Clarence were selected for feasibility
analyses.

[The City and Port of Nome are located on the southern coast of the
Seward Peninsula facing the Bering Sea, within the Bering Strait region.
[The Bering Strait is the key international waterway linking the Pacific
and Arctic oceans, and]{.mark} Nome's [central location]{.mark} in
western Alaska [near the Strait is a critical factor]{.mark} in
assessing its future role as an Arctic port.]{.underline} The port, with
a modest 22-foot basin depth, lies 102 miles south of the Arctic Circle
and 160 miles from the Russian coast. The City of Nome is a vibrant
community of 3,600 people, has a modern hospital and major airport, is a
commercial fishing port, and serves as a regional economic and supply
hub for some 50 coastal communities in western and northern Alaska.

[[The Army Corps of Engineers]{.mark} and the City of Nome recently have
been engaged in a cost-sharing, collaborative port-modification
feasibility study and environmental assessment for expanding the port.
The draft report released in May 2019 indicated that 14 options were
evaluated, [including a no-action or change
alternative]{.mark}]{.underline}. One option comes close to addressing
U.S. Arctic national security requirements: creation of a deep-water
basin with 30- and 40-foot depths and docks along an extended breakwater
and causeway. This plan may not be robust enough, and a 45-foot depth
could be necessary to provide more flexibility and safety for deeper
draft ships. Whatever expansion is chosen, Congress will need to fund
these port modifications as key strategic maritime assets to enhance
U.S. Arctic presence.

Recently, Congress has taken a keen interest in Arctic port issues. The
National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for 2020 has a provision for
designating sites for a strategic Arctic port. A report is to be
submitted by the Secretary of Defense to Congress (180 days after the
NDAA is enacted) evaluating potential sites for one or more strategic
Arctic ports.

[[The Port]{.mark} of Nome [is]{.mark} the [logical and
cost-effective]{.mark} location to begin developing an Alaskan Arctic
port system and providing an initial place for mooring deep-draft
ships.]{.underline} Expanding Nome is a strategic first step in
providing the United States with a timely and visible port presence in
its maritime Arctic to support national security and economic interests.

project secured federal and state funding earlier this year and led to
the signing of a project partnership agreement between the city of Nome

will be carried by the Army Corps, with the City of Nome covering the
remaining 10%.

Implications

The CSIS report warns that the [[export controls]{.mark} pose direct

country is already lagging behind in its defense
manufacturing.]{.underline}

"Even before the latest restrictions, the U.S. defense industrial base
struggled with limited capacity and lacked the ability to scale up
production to meet defense technology demands," its authors said.

They cite an estimate that [China is acquiring advanced weapons systems
and equipment five to six times faster than the U.S., originating from a
U.S. Air Force official in 2022]{.underline}.

"[Further [bans on]{.mark} critical [minerals]{.mark} inputs will only
[widen]{.mark} the [gap, enabling China to strengthen]{.mark} its
[military capabilities]{.mark} more quickly than the United States," the
report concludes.]{.underline}

The U.S. is not alone in its concerns about China's monopoly on rare
earths, with countries like Australia and Brazil also investing in
strengthening domestic rare earth elements supply chains.

[CSIS recommends that the U.S. provide financial and diplomatic support
to ensure the success of these initiatives.]{.underline}

[However, [China's]{.mark} new [export licensing system]{.mark} for the
rare earths could also [incentivize countries across]{.mark} the [world
to cooperate with China to prevent disruptions to]{.mark} their own
[supply of]{.mark} the [elements]{.mark}, CSIS said.]{.underline}

[A research report from Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital
Economics, on Monday also noted how [controls on rare earths]{.mark} and
critical minerals have become [part of Beijing's playbook]{.mark} in
pushing back against Washington.]{.underline}

[Shearing notes that in addition to China's hold on some rare earths,
the supply of many [other critical minerals]{.mark}, including cobalt
and palladium, is [concentrated in countries]{.mark} that [align with
Beijing]{.mark}.]{.underline}

"[The [weaponising of]{.mark} this control over [critical
minerals]{.mark} --- and the race by other countries to secure
alternative supplies --- will be a [central feature of]{.mark} a

The ASDF is the modern successor to the Alaska Territorial Guard which
was established as the first line of the territory's defense in 1942,
during World War II. During the war, the ATG served as scouts -- the

All of the members are Alaskan residents, and all are volunteers but not
everyone has a background in the United States military.

Chief Warrant Officer 2 (AK) Hillary Palmer worked for the
Matanuska-Susitna Borough during the cyber attack in 2018 and said the
incident motivated her to take a more active role in her state's
defense. Palmer has no history [wearing the military uniform but now
spends one weekend a month wearing green camouflage [in]{.mark} the
ASDF's [**cyber security** detachment]{.mark}.]{.underline}

To join you do not have prior military experience," said Palmer.
"There's a lot of really important technical expertise that exists
outside the military, and it [[would be a shame not]{.mark}
[**capitalize** on]{.mark} that **[expertise]{.mark}**."]{.underline}

The all-volunteer organization capitalizes on that expertise by
assigning personnel to its detachments according to their knowledge and
qualifications. Members [can serve in cyber security,]{.underline}
engineering, communications or logistics and supply. [Notably, the ASDF
[maintains]{.mark} a large and **[professionally]{.mark}** diverse
[medical unit]{.mark} with surgeons, nurses, psychiatrists and
chiropractors.]{.underline}

In Palmer's experience, [the [ASDF has]{.mark} the [**flexibility** to

**[accommodating]{.mark}** different [schedules]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[We are actively working on **[modernizing]{.mark}** and

training plan and goals I'm working towards. If I wasn't available today
I could put in eight hours of training on my own time."

Under the 49th Brigade, the 2nd Signal Detachmen[t will [provide

Center]{.underline} on Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson.

The Walker-Mallott administration has done a great thing by opening up
rural Alaska to the Alaska State Defense Force," explained Brig. Gen.

Guard in their missio[n and [provide]{.mark} education, training and
personal [**fulfillment** through **military** service]{.mark} for the
local residents."]{.underline}

Since 1984, the primary role of the all-volunteer state defense force
has been to augment and support the Alaska National Guard.

Even if the National Guard is mobilized, there would be someone here,
always," said Holl.

Holl explained that this new unit [will [enlarge]{.mark} the footprint
of [**military** service]{.mark} in the region [and afford]{.mark} the
**[opportunity]{.mark}** for its people to serve and protect their
home.]{.underline}

The National Guard armory is home to the Bethel-based unit, Bravo

We are opening our doors and welcoming another unit to share this
facility with us," said Capt. Walter Hotch-Hill, commander of B Co.,

At the conclusion of the event, applications to join the ASDF were taken
by former Guardsmen, veterans and even community members with no
military affiliation.

[The [agency provides]{.mark} a wide array of real estate [services

Air National Guard [in]{.mark} the [state]{.mark}. Much of the

[fences, but **integrated** into]{.mark} the local
[community]{.mark}.]{.underline} For most of this military real estate,
the Alaska District serves as the public face and community liaison.

Tricia Lemay, real estate specialist, manages the divestiture program on
behalf of the Alaska District. Lemay, a former paralegal with
wide-ranging experience in real estate, bankruptcy and family law,
[enjoys the detailed work and research involved in preparing the
divestitures. However, what she finds most [rewarding]{.mark} is
**[coordinating]{.mark}** with the communities who receive the
buildings.]{.underline}

"It takes a collective effort to accomplish these actions," she said.
"It's extremely satisfying to assist the villages in acquiring these
excess facilities that are valued so much and will be put to good use
for a long time."

In 2021, the agency supported the divestiture of 11 National Guard
buildings to the communities in which they reside, including two in
Kongiganak. Located in the southwestern part of the state, the
unincorporated village has a population of about 439 people within a
census area of 1.9 square miles.

The buildings in Kongiganak were transferred to the Qemirtalek Coast
Corp., which plans to hand over the former armories to the tribal
government. The facilities will be renovated and repurposed to support
the delivery of healthcare services in the community.

"Through collaborative efforts with National Guard Bureau and U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, we are pleased to be repurposing excess rural
facilities for continued use in public service," said Kevin Vakalis,
realty officer for the Alaska Army National Guard. "The logistics of
rural Alaska are a driving factor in the higher costs of construction in
[these communities and these buildings [provide **critical**]{.mark}
additional [infrastructure]{.mark}."]{.underline}

Available buildings are rare in rural parts of the state, so repurposing
these facilities reduces the need for new development.  

"Everything is more expensive up here," said Mark DeRocchi, chief of the
district's Engineering, Construction and Operations Division. "When you
factor in the cost of the raw materials, transportation to the state and
then shipping everything from the Port of Alaska to the communities --
along with a short construction season -- even the cheapest build can
become too expensive for small villages. Access to an existing building
saves the communities the time and expense of new construction."

[[**Alaska** was **critical** to]{.mark} the United States'
**[defense]{.mark}** efforts [due to]{.mark} its close [**proximity** to
**Russia**]{.mark} throughout the Cold War.]{.underline} During this
period, the National Guard established armories and Federal Scout
Readiness Centers in rural communities across the state.

"While the Cold War is in the distant past for many Americans, the
state's unique history means that many Alaskans interact with remnants
from the war every day," said Kelly Eldridge, archeologist at the Alaska
District.

And, in a [[**major** decision proving **unpopular**]{.mark} with at
least some of the force\'s roughly 280 members, the [state is **taking**
away the **brigade\'s guns.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Westall, a Wasilla resident and Wasilla\'s former airport manager, had
led the Defense Force since 1996.

The force \-- or 49th Military Police Brigade as it\'s been called since
2004 \-- operates under the auspices of the state Department of Military
and Veterans Affairs and is a volunteer, armed militia that meets once a
month and responds to emergencies around the state, often natural
disasters. Created to support military and civil agencies, members took
on additional homeland security duties after Sept. 11, 2001.

Westall said his departure was motivated by the state\'s decision to
remove the brigade\'s military policing powers \-- a decision triggered
in part by the investigation.

Westall, 71, submitted a request to retire after serving 25 years with
the force, mostly as a peace officer or a military police officer.

Given a national trend toward civil affairs for defense forces around
the country, Westall said he figured it was time for him to go.

\"It\'s just an opportunity for me to retire. Can\'t I do that
gracefully?\" he said, laughing.

Lt. Gen. Craig Campbell, the state\'s military and veterans affairs
commissioner, however, said Westall\'s resignation came as a surprise.

Campbell said he and Westfall met Oct. 7 to talk about a report on the
investigation, and talked about meeting again at the end of this month.
Westall sent in his request to retire the next day.

\"I was surprised,\" Campbell said. \"I really was expecting he\'d spend
a couple weeks thinking about it and come back and give me some
guidance.\"

Deputy brigade commander Col. Joe Williams is serving as Westall\'s
temporary replacement.

BRIGADE NO LONGER ARMED

Campbell initiated the investigation after a former brigade member
discharged by Westall filed a complaint with the governor\'s office last
year.

This summer, state military officials received the results: a 12-page
report by an investigator with the Washington National Guard. The report
doesn\'t specifically take Westall to task but does question brigade
practices during his time at the top.

The report critiqued the brigade\'s lack of specific policies,
[especially [regarding **termination**]{.mark} of soldiers,]{.underline}
said Campbell, adjutant general for the Alaska National Guard.

It also [found that administering a part-time civilian force [brings a
high **liability** risk to the state]{.mark}]{.underline}, he said.

\"The report does not say Westall was a bad commander,\" Campbell said.
[\"The report says the state defense force, it\'s a voluntary
organization, it\'s part time]{.underline}, it\'s dedicated volunteers
serving their state, [but they [don\'t have]{.mark} the [**intensity**
of training]{.mark}, the skill sets the National Guard
has.\"]{.underline}

As a result, Campbell recommended to Gov. Sarah Palin that brigade
members should no longer be armed.

In a still-evolving mission shift, most force members will instead serve
civil roles in support of the Alaska National Guard, Campbell said. The
Guard is taking on MP duties under a new national mission, [another
major factor in the decision to disarm the brigade.]{.underline}

Force members will likely provide support in engineering or security
areas[, but \"[not **necessarily** armed security]{.mark}\" except for
maybe a platoon in Valdez, Campbell said.]{.underline}

#### It's key -- ensures cooperation in the Arctic and with NATO.

**Nordic Council**, 10-31-**24** \[The Nordic Council is a political

For some time now, **[[the Nordic Council]{.mark} has been [working
towards closer co-operation between the Nordic countries on]{.mark}
foreign affairs[, defence]{.mark} and security policy]{.underline}**. At
the annual Session of the Council in Reykjavík, [the Presidium submitted
a new proposal to the national governments to set up a Nordic defence
and security commission, which would provide a further boost to the
region's security and stability.]{.underline}

**[Closer Nordic co-operation]{.underline}** does not pose a threat to
anybody. It **[[will enhance stability and the ability to anticipate
events in the region]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Finland and Sweden joining
NATO has also opened up significant new opportunities

Bryndís Haraldsdóttir, President of the Nordic Council.

[Security in the Nordic Region and surrounding countries is one of the
main priorities in the international strategy adopted by the Nordic
Council in March 2023]{.underline}. It is also key to the Council's
societal security strategy. The **[two strategies]{.underline}**,
devised jointly by all of the party groups, **[were adopted by large
majorities,]{.underline}** demonstrating a strong consensus that
**[security [plays a central role]{.mark} in Nordic
co-operation.]{.underline}**

Lack of a joint commission with a Nordic mandate

[[The Nordic Council sees the proposal for a commission as]{.mark} an
[important]{.mark} milestone for co-operation on security
policy]{.underline} and for joint efforts to promote stability and
security.

Defence and security policy is often a main theme at sessions of the
Nordic Council. The Secretary General of NATO, Jens Stoltenberg, was a
keynote speaker in Copenhagen in 2021 and Oslo in 2023.

Every year, the Presidium invites Nordefco, the country holding the
Presidency and the chairs of the national defence committees to a
roundtable discussion on security in the region. Nordefco is the Nordic
defence ministers' co-operation body.

**[Despite the existence of national committees and various reports on
the subject, the Presidium believes [there is]{.mark} still [a need for
a forum where defence and security policy issues can be raised]{.mark}
at a Nordic level, hence the proposal for a defence and security
commission [with a Nordic mandate.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

**[Now that all of the Nordic countries are in NATO, [we have a unique
opportunity to]{.mark} work even more closely together and [protect our
democracies and shared values]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Oddný Harðardóttir, Vice-President of the Nordic Council

**[[Now that all of the Nordic countries are members of NATO and
Nordefco has drawn up a]{.mark} new [vision for co-operation]{.mark},
the Nordic Council believes [everything is in place for]{.mark} setting
up [a Nordic defence and security commission]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Under the proposal, **[the committee [would have a broad mandate]{.mark}
and [involve representatives from the defence sector and
politicians]{.mark} from across the Nordic countries.]{.underline}**

The proposal stresses that [the [committee's work could include analyses
of security in the Arctic]{.mark}, North Atlantic and Baltic Sea, as
well as the [development of a total defence system]{.mark} with a focus
on cyber security and hybrid threats. [The main focus should be on
collective security, better coordination of]{.mark} national decisions
on [defence and closer co-operation on security.]{.mark}]{.underline}

It is important to focus even more closely on co-operation around the
Arctic, North Atlantic and Baltic Sea to ensure a secure future for all
of us

Kristina Háfoss, Secretary General of the Nordic Council

The Nordic Council's proposal also stresses that the work should be
headed up by the governments and defence ministers but **[[it is also
important that parliamentarians are involved to ensure]{.mark} a broad
Nordic perspective and [political support]{.mark} for its
work.]{.underline}**

**[The [security situation in the Nordics]{.mark} has [underscored
the]{.mark} growing [need for deeper cooperation between the Nordic
countries]{.mark},]{.underline}** especially **[[in light of
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**'s increasingly aggressive actions. [While
Finland and Sweden's recent NATO membership has strengthened the
region's defense,]{.underline} **[experts believe that [further
integration]{.mark} and collaboration among Nordic nations [is essential
for ensuring long-term security]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The topic is one
of many key issues to be discussed at the upcoming Arctic Security
Conference -- "Linking the North American and European Arctics," which
will take place in Oslo, Norway on September 12 -- 13. [According to
Andreas Østhagen, a senior researcher at the Fridtjof Nansen Institute
and Iselin Németh Winther, a junior researcher]{.underline} at the same
institute, who are the among the conference's organizers, **[[the real
change in the region's security landscape started with Russia's growing
unpredictability.]{.mark}]{.underline}** "The security situation didn't
change with Finland and Sweden joining NATO. It changed with Russia
increasingly being an untrustworthy and aggressive actor in the Arctic
and in a Nordic context," Østhagen explained. [Finland and Sweden's
decision to join NATO]{.underline} in 2023, was [in response to this
evolving threat environment.]{.underline} However, their membership
hasn't dramatically altered the overall security landscape, which had
already been shaped by Russia's behavior. "**[[Russia is the actor that
we are all trying to manage]{.mark}, that we're all
fearing]{.underline}**," Østhagen said, noting that the region's defense
strategies have long been focused on containing the Russian threat.
**[In response to this, [the Nordics are expected to deepen their
defense cooperation,]{.mark} both [within NATO and]{.mark} through
regional frameworks like [NORDEFCO]{.mark}]{.underline}**. While full
military integration may not happen soon, Østhagen believes that [closer
collaboration is likely.]{.underline}

"The Nordic countries really should sit down and figure out where do we
want to go from here," Østhagen emphasized. He highlighted that [joint
planning and shared operational frameworks between Finland, Sweden, and
Norway are already being developed]{.underline}, but the potential for
even deeper political and military collaboration remains an open
question. At the same time, **[[concerns about hybrid threats,
particularly in the Arctic, are growing]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Iselin
Németh Winther pointed out that the risk of unintended escalations in
the region is very real, especially given recent incidents involving
Russian provocations. **["[You need to have the tools to de-escalate
situations]{.mark}]{.underline}** like that," Winther said,
[[referencing incidents like a recent shadowing of Norwegian research
vessels by Russian ships]{.mark} and Russia's ghost fleet of ships that
operate without .]{.underline} While an all-out conflict with [Russia
i]{.underline}s seen as unlikely, [hybrid warfare]{.underline}---such as
cyberattacks or sabotage of critical infrastructure---[poses a more
significant risk to the region.]{.underline} "I think hybrid warfare or
escalations and provocations are more likely because it's harder to
point the finger at Russia for that kind of activity," Winther added.
NATO's renewed focus on the Arctic region, following Russia's invasion
of Ukraine, has been beneficial to the Nordic countries, though it comes
in response to a deteriorating security environment. "It's what we have
been pushing for for a long time: to get more NATO attention, to get
more U.S., British, French, and German attention to the Arctic or to the
high north," Østhagen said. However, he cautioned that balancing the
interests of larger NATO powers with those of smaller members, such as
the Nordic countries, will be critical in maintaining a cautious and
measured approach to Arctic security. "**[The approach has always been
cautious. It's about finding the right balance between all these
states]{.underline}**," Østhagen concluded. As the region adapts to
these new challenges, **[[Nordic defense integration is expected to
grow]{.mark}, with the two hoping that [closer collaboration will
provide an alternative to reliance solely on NATO or]{.mark} larger
global powers like [the U.S. and EU.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

CH

[[Where Russia's policy **distances itself**]{.underline}]{.mark} even
further [[from status-quo preservation is]{.underline}]{.mark} the
much-politicized issue of [expanding "[**ownership"** of the continental
shelf]{.mark}]{.underline}---which makes no difference for navigation or
for fisheries, but is nevertheless presented as a matter of major
importance. [[Russia]{.mark} was the first Arctic state to [file a
claim]{.mark} with the]{.underline} UN Commission on the Limits of the
Continental Shelf ([UN CLCS]{.underline}) in accordance with the Law of
the Sea Convention (UNCLOS): in 2001, [it presented a claim [for some
**1.2 million square kilometers**]{.mark}]{.underline} between the
Lomonosov and Mendeleev underwater ridges[, territory stretching [all
the way up to the North Pole]{.mark}]{.underline}---only to see the
claim returned for further substantiation. It took 13 years to collect
scientific data to back Russia's claim concerning where to draw the
outer limits of the continental shelf, and in August 2015 the claim was
re-submitted. In Moscow, considerable anxiety now attends the CLCS
deliberations on a verdict.38 In fact, the only recommendation the
Commission can issue is to sort out the conflict between the Russian and
the Danish claims, as well as with a Canadian claim, which might be
submitted by the end of 2018.39 [This uncertainty does not sit well with
Russia's inordinate assertiveness. Although [Moscow]{.mark} is currently
well served by the UNCLOS, it [might]{.mark} in the future [resort to
**unilateral steps**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In seeking to justify such a
departure from international law, Russia might argue that the CLCS has
been deliberately procrastinating]{.underline}, or by referring to the
US failure to ratify the UNCLOS.

Overall, [[Russia has been preparing for]{.mark} a spike in
[**geopolitical confrontation** in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. Its
position of military dominance in the Barents region constitutes a
threat to the Nordic neighbors, who feel compelled to step up their own
defense preparations. These [dynamics,]{.underline} resembling the
[[classical security dilemma]{.underline}]{.mark} model, might [[prompt
Moscow to **shift** from]{.mark} the [status-quo policy]{.mark} of
maintaining its position of strength, [to]{.mark} a **[revisionist
policy]{.mark}** of actually using that]{.underline}

[[Implications for domain awareness]{.mark}]{.underline} The
**[[transatlantic community should be concerned]{.mark} about several
troubling scenarios that could escalate into armed conflict in the
Arctic]{.underline}**. The [first and most obvious scenario]{.underline}
is of a **[Russia-NATO [conflict in the Baltic]{.mark} Sea [or Black
Sea]{.mark} regions [spilling into the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} Russian military aggression
against the Baltic states or against NATO forces near Ukraine would
involve or could potentially [involve elements of the Russian Northern
Fleet]{.underline}, based in Severomorsk, **[which would immediately
expand the conflict into the Arctic]{.underline}**. Even if Russian
naval assets did not immediately attack, NATO forces would have to act
as if Northern Fleet elements were potentially hostile forces, meaning
that NATO might launch precautionary attacks against them following a
Russian incursion. I**[n either instance, there would be [significant
risk of horizontal escalation]{.mark} into the Arctic]{.underline}**.
[**Having a [detailed picture of Russian actions and movements would be
crucial]{.mark} in this scenario.** A second scenario involves a
misunderstanding or accident during military exercises or
training.]{.underline} **[[Russian forces]{.mark}]{.underline}** are
famous for launching mock attacks against Western military assets and
for operating without activating their location transponders. They have
**[[launched mock attacks against]{.mark} the Vardo [radar facility in
Norway]{.mark}, Gotland [Island in Sweden]{.mark}, Bornholm [Island in
Denmark]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and against NATO ships and aircraft in
other locales. Any one of these incidents could have escalated out of
control had Western forces reacted differently or had Russian forces
attacked without orders. **[Having better [domain awareness would give
West]{.mark}ern forces [better warning of Russian military movements and
insight]{.mark} as to whether specific incidents were part of a larger
military campaign.]{.underline}** [**[A third scenario involves a
dispute over mineral extraction or commercial fishing in Arctic waters
escalating]{.mark} out of control.** Russia and Norway disagree on
whether Norway has sole jurisdiction over]{.underline} the waters and
seabed around the [Svalbard]{.underline} archipelago. Conflict could
arise should Russia back up its claims with force. Or consider that nine
countries plus the EU have agreed to a fishing moratorium for the
central Arctic ocean. Conflict could erupt should a large
state-authorized fishing operation be caught harvesting in those waters.
**[Ap[propriate domain awareness could give Western Arctic states
warning of initial violations]{.mark} and [potentially escalatory
behavi]{.mark}or in either maritime crisis.]{.underline}** Each scenario
points to the need for robust air and maritime domain awareness in the
Arctic. The most likely attack vectors are via air or sea. [Scenarios
involving [overland aggression]{.mark}]{.underline} are much less
plausible (though **[[still of concern to the Finnish and Norwegian
armies]{.underline}]{.mark}**). That begs the question of the degree to
which Arctic states possess the domain awareness capabilities needed to
anticipate each scenario.

Shipping [announced]{.underline} in 2024 that [they would cooperate on
operating an all-year-round container shipping route through the
Arctic]{.underline}. Since then, shipping interruptions at flashpoints
from the Panama Canal to the Red Sea have thrown the global economy into
turmoil. Worse, [[increasing military]{.mark} and technological
[collaboration between Beijing and Moscow has escalated]{.mark} the
[security threats]{.mark} facing the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates and its allies.

[To counter this cooperation, [the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[should consider]{.underline}]{.mark}
working with its Canadian allies to open and maintain an equivalent
shipping route --- [[an]{.underline} "[Ice Canal]{.underline}" [across
the Northwest Passage]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [to bolster their
commercial and strategic presence in the region.]{.underline}

All-[[year-round shipping]{.underline}]{.mark} through the Arctic [would
require]{.underline} [significant infrastructure]{.underline} and
promises high costs for fuel, equipment, and manpower. But these
investments would generate considerable economic returns. The Northwest
Passage can reduce shipping distance between London and Tokyo by about
3,780 nautical miles, or approximately 7,000 kilometers. And
[[the]{.mark} priceless [strategic benefits]{.mark} of bolstering U.S.
and allied nuclear security should [incentivize public cooperation with
the private sector]{.mark}]{.underline}, defraying costs further.

Moscow and Beijing recognize the region's significance. Their agreement
involves building five ice-class container ships and investing in
infrastructure such as deep-water ports and refueling and repair
facilities along the Northern Sea Route along Russia's Arctic coastline.
These [container ships are dual-use]{.underline}, meaning they can be
used for commercial purposes and military sealift operations such as
weapons systems and troop transport. [The initiative signals that Russia
and China prioritize regional mobility, allowing them to cooperate on
increasing the profitability of Russia's Arctic coastline and on
strategic interoperability across the region.]{.underline}

[[A competing dual-use project]{.underline}, [led by the
U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} [and Canada, [would help engage Japan,
South]{.mark} Korea, and other Arctic NATO allies [in strategic and
economic cooperation across the region]{.mark}]{.underline}.

**[[The first step to opening this route is to find out what we do not
know]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Because very few people have been to the
Northwest Passage in winter, [[assessments are largely based on
theoretical models]{.mark} and historical and satellite
data]{.underline}. [These means of data collection are insufficient to
create a reliable and detailed map of the geographical and seasonal
shipping challenges]{.underline}. [[Shipping along the Northwest Passage
will require initial efforts to]{.underline} **[map sea ice
movements]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[wind
patterns]{.underline}**]{.mark} throughout the year.

Canada has 20 vessels in its icebreaker fleet, two of which are heavy
icebreakers. These are expected to be replaced with two new polar
vessels capable of operating in moderate multiyear ice conditions in
2030. To complement research, approximately five years of all-year-round
icebreaker presence is needed to map the geographical locations and
timing of choke points created by multiyear ice and wind patterns.

The data collected by the icebreaker presence will be used to identify
locations for deploying unmanned aerial vehicles or helicopters
supplying ice and weather data to vessels and aircraft transiting the
Northwest Passage. Icebreakers will be on call all year round to assist
vessels transiting ice choke points. This would allow for safe
all-year-round passage of container ships and give U.S. and Canadian
forces invaluable real-world experience operating jointly and across
domains in Arctic conditions.

Additionally, a permanent Western presence along the Northwest Passage
would give U.S. and allied militaries invaluable situational awareness
and the ability to respond swiftly to the outbreak of conflict in
critical strategic areas. This is particularly important because the
shortest routes for Russian intercontinental ballistic missiles are
through the poorly surveilled airspace north of the Arctic Circle.

In the Atlantic, [[the
G]{.mark}reenland[--I]{.mark}celand--[U]{.mark}nited [K]{.mark}ingdom
[gap and the Barents Sea are the primary strategic locations for Russian
nuclear-armed ballistic missile
sub]{.mark}marine[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[Insufficient underwater
surveillance]{.mark}]{.underline}** in these areas, [[as well as the
Bear Gap between]{.mark} Norwegian [Svalbard and Scandinavia and along
Greenland's east coast]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[allows Russian
SSBNs]{.underline} [more freedom to operate undetected]{.underline},
[strengthening Russia's second-strike capability toward North America
and]{.underline} ]{.mark}[therefore [weakening U.S.
deterrence.]{.mark}]{.underline}

On the eastern end of the supercontinent, [the Bering
Strait]{.underline} --- the entrance to the Pacific between Russia and
Alaska --- [has become a critical chokepoint]{.underline}. [Russia has
fitted submarine bases near its eastern port]{.underline} city of
Vladivostok [with hardened shelter pens]{.underline} and additional
repair and maintenance facilities to avoid dependency on Barents Sea
facilities. [Russian-Chinese base-sharing arrangements]{.underline} at
the entrance to the North Pacific [strengthen
interoperability]{.underline}. [And Beijing and Moscow have signaled
their willingness to extend cooperation to their strategic nuclear
forces with a joint air patrol with four nuclear-capable bombers in
Alaska's air defense identification zone.]{.underline}

CHINA ANGLING FOR 'INCREASED ENGAGEMENT WITH GREENLAND,' INTEL COMMUNITY
SAYS

A container route along the Northwest Passage would do much to establish
presence, connectivity, and interoperability between Canada, the U.S.,
and other allies with Arctic interests and represent an important
countermove to Russia-China collaboration. Canadian leadership in
establishing and operating the new container route is advisable to avoid
ramping up international tensions, thanks to its rights and
responsibilities as a coastal state.

[[As Moscow and Beijing prepare for dual-use
operations]{.underline}]{.mark} from the Barents Sea to the Bering
Strait, [[it is imperative for purposes of deterrence and situational
awareness to establish an all-year-round North American strategic
presence]{.underline}]{.mark} from the North Atlantic to the North
Pacific. [[The Northwest Passage offers an opportunity to

allies]{.mark}, commercial actors, and local communities to promote a

**Singh Associates '17** \[Singh Associates; September 1; Indian law
firm; Mondaq, "India: Liability Of The Promoter With Regards To The
Personal Property Given As Security When The Moratorium Has Been Issued"
Mondaq Business Briefing, Nexis Uni\]

Recently in the case of Schweitzer Systemtek vs. Phoenix ARC Limited3,
the Mumbai bench of the NCLT was asked to adjudicate on the issue that
whether the personal properties of the promoters which have been given
as security to the bank/creditor come under the purview of the
moratorium as envisaged under Section 14 of the Code or not. In this
case, Dhanlaxmi Bank had lent Rs 4.5 crore to the company wherein the
promoter had pledged personal properties. The bank sold the loan along
with security to Phoenix ARC. M/s Schweitzer Systemtek had filed for the
initiation of CIRP under Section 10 (3) which was opposed by Phoenix ARC
fearing that if the case is admitted, a moratorium under Section 14 of
the Code will be issued, which could thwart the action taken so far for
recovery of the outstanding loans which included selling personal
properties of the promoters which were in an advanced stage.

The Tribunal perused the facts and came to the conclusion that the
admitted position of the debtor is that the personal properties have
been given as a \"Security\" to the banks which clearly implies that the
properties are currently not under the ownership of the Corporate
Debtor. In that regard, to ascertain that whether the properties which
are not owned by a Corporate Debtor will come within the ambits of the
Moratorium or not, the Tribunal examined Section 14 (c) of the Code and
observed that the canon of interpretation is a very important tool for
gauging the intention of the legislature and language of the Statute is
such that no word can be added, or substituted or deleted from the
enacted Code, thereby [the term \"its\"]{.underline} in the
aforementioned section becomes very important because on a plain reading
of the section it is understood that on the commencement of the
Insolvency Process, the Moratorium shall be declared for prohibiting any
action to recover or enforce any security interest created by the
Corporate Debtor in respect of its property, the [usage of the word
[\"its\"]{.mark} clearly [makes a distinction between the property owned
by the]{.mark} Corporate [Debtor and **other** properties]{.mark},
[which means that the Moratorium will have **no application on the
properties beyond the ownership** of the]{.mark} Corporate
[Debtor]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this case, since the property in
question was given as security to the bank, the moratorium would not
apply on the personal properties.

Crushing criticism \"**[[The relationship with Russia]{.mark} is
[forever changed]{.mark}]{.underline}** and [that has
consequences]{.underline} for Norway. We are in the middle of a new
security policy situation in which Norway\'s defense capability does not
coincide, and even less so with regard to the constantly advancing
challenges. **[A greater [long-term perspective]{.mark}, predictability,
and uniting political solutions are [essential]{.mark} [for
investing]{.mark} in what is most important:]{.underline}** [Our peace
and freedom,\"]{.underline} said the leader of the Defense Commission,
Knut Storberget, as he handed over the commission\'s report to MoD Bjørn
Arild Gram (Center). The report can not be described as anything but a
crushing description of the Norwegian defense capability, in which
Norway is left without the ability to defend itself against the growing
security threat, particularly in the High North. \"Despite a serious
situation, Norway has not recognized the gravity of it. Preparing for a
war when it has already arrived is costly,\" says Storberget. **[The
threat of nuclear power]{.underline}** The report describes [a
belligerent neighbor in the East which in no way poses a lesser threat
after over a year of war]{.underline}. If anything**[[, a weakened
Russia is a larger threat]{.underline}]{.mark}** than before and the
commission believes that **[Russia [will go to great lengths to
rebuild]{.mark}]{.underline}** what has been lost. **[That applies to
[the Northern Fleet close to the Norwegian border]{.mark}, among other
things]{.underline}**. The commission also believes that, in a
transitional period, there are many indications that [Russia will
increasingly rely on nuclear weapons as a more central part of the
Russian security strategy]{.underline}, something that **[[increases the
strategic significance of the High North]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The
Defense Commission recommends an extensive and three-part economic
expansion plan: 1. The defense budget should be increased as soon as
possible by NOK 30 billion over the current budget trajectory. 2. An
additional NOK 40 billion should be added per year in extra allocations
for a ten-year period. 3. A permanent budget increase of NOK 10 billion
when the period of extra allocations is over to ensure the balance
between investments and operations. It is also to be expected that
**[[Russia will consider]{.mark} the [NATO expansion of Sweden and
Finland]{.mark} as [an increased threat]{.mark} from NATO in the
north]{.underline}**. Therefore, **[[access to the Atlantic Ocean will
become even more important to Russi]{.mark}a since the Baltic Sea will
become NATO territory for all practical purposes]{.underline}**, states
the report. The report describes the Russian Northern Fleet\'s ability
to carry out military operations and to organize combat operations in
Arctic conditions in particular, which has been significantly
strengthened in recent years. \"**[[The Russian military in the north
remains a threat]{.underline}]{.mark}** and directly affects Norwegian
security,\" said Storberget during the handover.

[[Russia]{.mark}n forces have been [beefing up bases and building
military infrastructure near the Finnish border]{.mark}]{.underline},
according to recent satellite imagery, in moves that could **[[reveal
their strategy]{.mark} [for what happens after]{.mark} the
[Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}** war. The imagery, confirmed by NATO
officials, shows row after row of new tents; new warehouses that can
store military vehicles; renovations to fighter jet shelters; and steady
construction activity on a helicopter base that had been mostly unused
and overgrown. So far the moves seem to be the **[early stages of a
larger, [longer-term expansion]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and [NATO
officials say this is nothing like the buildup along the Ukraine border
before Russia's full-scale invasion]{.underline} in 2022. For now,
Russia, preoccupied with its war in Ukraine, has very few troops along
the frontier, and the Finns insist that [none of this is much of a
threat --- yet.]{.underline} But **[[Finland]{.mark}]{.underline}** is
one of NATO's newest members, joining two years ago, and the moves no
doubt reflect Moscow's own perception of a threat: This 830-mile
frontier is **[[now]{.mark}]{.underline}** the Western alliance's
**[[longest line of contact with Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Military
analysts predict **[it could [become a hot spot]{.mark}, especially with
much of it lying in the increasingly contested Arctic
Circle.]{.underline}** American and Finnish troops recently held an
elaborate Arctic war game in this region, with hundreds of troops
running around the woods and the Finns zipping through the trees on
cross-country skis. The presumed enemy? Russia. Finnish defense
officials predict that [if the high-intensity phase of the Ukraine war
ends]{.underline} --- one of the goals of the struggling peace efforts
unfolding in Turkey --- **[[Russia will redeploy thousands]{.mark} of
troops [to the Finnish frontier]{.mark}. [The Finns]{.mark} think they
[have five years or so before Russia can build up its forces to
threatening levels]{.mark}.]{.underline}** But **[they are confident it
will happen]{.underline}** and that the number of Russian troops facing
them will triple. "We'll be talking about so much higher troop levels,"
said Brig. Gen. Pekka Turunen, the director of Finnish defense
intelligence. From Moscow's perspective, the Russians need to bolster
their defenses to protect themselves from NATO expansion, which has
always been a sore subject. The Baltic nations were the first members of
the former Soviet Union to join NATO, bringing large stretches of
Russia's border up against NATO's. The prospect of Ukraine, an even
bigger former Soviet republic, following suit was so threatening to
Moscow that it became one of the causes of the most devastating land war
in generations. "The Russian military has undergone a significant force
expansion," said Michael Kofman, a senior fellow at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace in Washington. "After the war, the
ground force will probably end up larger than before 2022. Looking at
the planned restructuring of military districts, it seems clear that
they're going to prioritize areas facing NATO." NATO officials agree.
Whenever the Ukraine war ends, one senior NATO official said, Russia
would redeploy troops further and further to the north. **[[Russia
believes that the Arctic and access in the Arctic is a key to great
power status]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the official said, speaking on
condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic. As Ukrainian drones
target airfields across Russia, Russian command has moved assets north,
to get out of range. This has put them much closer to NATO territory.
Dozens of Russian warplanes were recently spotted at the Olenya air
base, also in the Arctic and fewer than 100 miles from the Finnish
border, according to the satellite imagery. Other recent activity
includes more than a hundred new tents that appeared about a year ago at
Kamenka, a Russian base fewer than 40 miles from Finland. ["They are
expanding their brigades into divisions, which means that the units near
our borders will grow significantly]{.underline} --- by thousands," said
Emil Kastehelmi, an analyst with the Black Bird Group, a Finnish
organization that analyses the military developments in the north and in
Ukraine. Mr. Kastehelmi, who analyzed dozens of recent images for The
New York Times, said that the next few years could bring massive changes
to the Finnish frontier, depending on how and when the war in Ukraine
ends.

[The like-minded Nordics will agree on some policy topics]{.underline}
in NATO, but it is **[unlikely that they will become a
bloc]{.underline}** (which is also frowned upon in NATO). In reality,
the **[five Nordic countries]{.underline}**, in spite of their shared
heritage, **[have divergent interests]{.underline}**, which in itself
will lead them to emphasize different policy dimensions, even of the
overall "High North" agenda in NATO. Discounting Iceland, which is
technically a microstate without armed forces, the **[big four Nordics
each have geographical agendas that set them apart,]{.underline}** also
in a NATO context. The Kingdom of [Denmark includes Greenland and the
Faroe Islands]{.underline}, a source of both pride and practical
concern. [Norway has Svalbard and Jan Mayen,]{.underline} including the
tricky legacy of cooperation with Russia. [Sweden has the military
challenge of Gotland and its eyes on the Baltic Sea and the Baltics
beyond it.]{.underline} [Finland,]{.underline} the best prepared of all
of these states with regard to conventional national defense, is
[fixated both on Russia]{.underline} and the new sensitive logic of the
U.S. defense cooperation agreement that grants U.S. presence on bases on
its territory not far from Russia's strategic heartland in the Kola
Peninsula. To paraphrase the [former Norwegian minister of
defense]{.underline}, [Johan Jørgen Holst]{.underline}, geopolitically
speaking **[the Nordics are like a family standing shoulder to shoulder,
but each of them look in different directions.]{.underline}** Each
[Nordic state brings different perspectives]{.underline} to NATO, and in
the coming years the alliance will have to more clearly define what its
role is in the High North and how far that geography extends. NATO's
completion of its northern puzzle is furthermore significant in broad
geopolitical terms. More than a mere incremental addition to NATO, the
new Nordic defense situation is a historic achievement that is likely to
influence the Nordic countries' strategic cultures. The unification of
the Nordic countries inside NATO spells the end of the greater Nordic
space as a centuries-old geopolitical buffer zone. From the end of the
Napoleonic wars and for more than 200 years, this space was defined
outside-in in geopolitical terms. Boxed in by Russia from the east, by
the United Kingdom from the west, and, increasingly, by Germany from the
south, the greater Nordic space, including the Baltic states, was
subject to great power interests and a balance of power which varied
over time. After World War II, the Cold War divisions repeated the
buffer zone's logic: Denmark and Norway in NATO (but not without initial
quibbles and talk of a Scandinavian defense union, which for the same
reason had no legs). After the end of the Cold War, Finland and Sweden
dropped their formal neutrality but stayed "alliance free." All four
states in various ways had special relationships with Russia: Finland's
dual approach of conventional military strength and political expediency
gave name to "Finlandization"; Sweden fostered a double reality of deep
military connections to the West and a public political discourse closer
to the Non-Aligned Movement; Norway cultivated a pragmatic cooperation
with Russia, especially on Svalbard; and Denmark finally, on its own
behalf, regarded its sovereignty of the Island of Bornholm with some
reticence. A geopolitics of the mind played out in all four countries.
[While de facto on the Western side in the great global struggle between
capitalist democracy and communism]{.underline}, their [political
discourses]{.underline}, in various ways and to different degrees, often
[equated the Nordic experience with a way apart from the rest of the
world, somehow elevated above the fray, outside of the logic of great
power tensions]{.underline}. As Johan Jørgen Holst noted in 1984: \"[The
Nordic area constitutes a geostrategic unity shaped by . . . the
prevailing constellation of contending power]{.underline}s. It **[forms
in addition a psychostrategic unity shaped by a feeling of community and
a recurrent nostalgia for Nordic separateness and
autarky]{.underline}**. Since the former constrains the manifestation of
the latter, **[the two are in constant tension]{.underline}**.\"

the Faroese PM V. Johannesen begins his speech at the Nordic Council
session 2024 in Reykjavík last week. \"**[The theory says that the

countries. In practice, [we are sadly kept out by some
states]{.underline}. [We have experienced that more than
once]{.underline} by the chairship in the past year,\" he continues.
[Sweden, this year\'s chairship]{.underline} of the Nordic Council of
Ministers and the coordinator of the N5 format, has **[not invited the
Faroe Islands and Greenland]{.underline}** to several Nordic ministerial
meetings -- such as the Nordic-Ukrainian summit on the sidelines of the
Nordic Council Session last Monday. \"We wish that we jointly break the
pattern in which smaller countries are left out when big decisions are
made. There is a concrete proposal to change the Helsinki Treaty on the
table so that we can obtain equal participation in this valuable
cooperation in the long term.\" \"It is time we stop the leak between
theory and practice. For our standpoint is completely clear: **[We are
either all in or not at all]{.underline}**,\" says Johannesen. [The
Faroe Islands and Greenland did not receive an invitation
to:]{.underline} • The Nordic Heads of Government [meeting with the
German chancellor about security]{.underline} and competitiveness in

Nordic Council session.]{.underline}** PM Múte B. Egede and Vivian
Motzfeldt, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Independence, were thus not
present in Reykjavík last week. The rationale is straightforward:
\"**[The lack of equality in the cooperation between the Nordic
countries]{.underline}**, where Gr[eenland, the Faroe Islands, and Åland
are excluded]{.underline} from essential debates and conversations in
Nordic ministerial meetings, constitutes an increasingly significant
problem. **[Greenland can no longer accept this, especially when the
central theme for this year\'s session of the Nordic Council is peace
and security in the Arctic.\"]{.underline}** The statement came from
Greenland\'s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Independence last Tuesday.
\"It is regrettable that we have to come to the point that we in
Naalakkersuisut have to cancel our participation. Nordic cooperation
should stand for equality, democracy, and inclusion. **[Especially when
peace and security in the Arctic are to be discussed, the Nordic
countries should involve and listen to all the Arctic
peoples]{.underline}**,\" underlines Motzfeldt and continues: \"It is
time for the Nordic Council and the Nordic Council of Ministers to
become more inclusive.\"
