### AT: Negative Utilitarianism

#### Negative util's a [total collapse]{.underline}\-\--prefer [positive]{.underline} util.

Hence these counter-examples could (arguably) be resisted with at least
some plausibility. Nevertheless, by combining different elements from
these counter-examples, we can construct a more challenging
counter-example. [The point of this new counter-example to
[Neg]{.mark}ative [Util]{.mark}itarianism]{.underline} [is that (i) it
is compelling, (ii) it cannot, plausibly, be blocked by clinging to the
intuition that evil and suffering have greater moral import than
goodness and happiness, (iii) it cannot plausibly be blocked by a
lexical tie-breaker rule, (iv) it **[has no analogue for
Classical]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[]{.mark}**[Utilitarianism]{.underline}**, [and (v) it is applicable to
fixed populations]{.underline}. Earlier counter-examples have, as I have
argued, failed on at least one of these scores.11 The following is a
better counter-example.

Consider

[[Bliss v]{.underline}]{.mark}ersus [[Torture]{.mark} You have a choice
between the following outcomes, where the same people live for the same
duration]{.underline}:

[𝐴 [Everyone]{.mark} gets a [century]{.mark} of pure [bliss followed
by]{.mark} a [**pinprick**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[𝐵 [Someone gets]{.mark} a century of **[torture]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[and [everyone else]{.mark} gets a century of **[no pleasure]{.mark}**
and **[no pain]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Given a large enough population, [you ought to [choose **𝐵**]{.mark}
over **𝐴** [according to N]{.mark}egative
[U]{.mark}tilitarianism.]{.underline} [[Yet 𝐴]{.mark} seems more
choice-worthy than 𝐵 [on]{.mark}, basically, [any]{.mark} plausible
**[moral metric]{.mark}**]{.underline}: [𝐴 is overwhelmingly in
everyone's subjective interest]{.underline} (given, as seems plausible,
that everyone strongly prefers ending up in 𝐴 to ending up in 𝐵).12, [13
[𝐴]{.mark} is [more eq]{.mark}ual than 𝐵. The [**worse-off** are
better]{.mark} off in 𝐴 than in 𝐵. There is **[less torture]{.mark}** in
𝐴 than in 𝐵. And so on.]{.underline}

Furthermore, [it seems that Bliss versus Torture lacks a clear analogue
for Classical Utilitarianism]{.underline}.14 (But it is, admittedly,
somewhat slippery what counts as analogous to what.) Furthermore[, the
[suffering in 𝐵]{.mark} seems morally worse, and a **[greater
evil]{.mark}**, than the suffering in 𝐴]{.underline}. Finally, [this
counter-example [cannot]{.mark} be [blocked]{.mark} by [letting]{.mark}
the sum total of [pleasure break ties]{.mark} between outcomes with the
same sum total of pain]{.underline}. Hence this counter-example to
Negative Utilitarianism should be more challenging than the earlier
counter-examples.

It may be objected that we could deny the possibility of any disanalogy
between Classical and [Negative Utilitarianism by claiming that there is
**no** such thing as **positive well-being**]{.underline}.15 If there is
no such thing as positive well-being, the bliss in 𝐴 would count for
nothing. And, if so, even Classical Utilitarianism would prescribe 𝐵.
But note that the claim that bliss does not provide positive well-being
(that is, that bliss is not good for the person) is a substantive
evaluative claim. This claim, which Classical Utilitarianism rules out,
is part of the package of normative and evaluative ideas that the
counter-example targets. Bliss versus Torture does not refer to positive
and negative well-being; it only refers to bliss, pinpricks, and
torture. [[Bliss]{.mark}, **[pinpricks]{.mark}**, and
**[torture]{.mark}** do **[exist]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Still, [one may defend the rejection of positive well-being with the
[claim]{.mark} that there are [no experiences with]{.mark} a
[positive]{.mark} hedonic [tone]{.mark}]{.underline}.16 [But this
[conflicts]{.mark} [with]{.mark} what I suspect is most people's
[introspective]{.mark} [judgement]{.mark}]{.underline} that pleasurable
experiences from the best things in life have a positive hedonic tone.17

Furthermore, [it seems that our [reasons for]{.mark} thinking that there
is [negative well-being]{.mark} are [analogous]{.mark} to our reasons
for thinking that there is **[positive]{.mark}
well-being**]{.underline}. If we are wrong about the existence of
positive well-being, we should also be sceptical about the existence of
negative well-being.

Schopenhauer's dogged insistence that it would be better if the world
had never existed surely means that he would embrace a simple and
painless way to put humanity out of its misery. Once again, it is
Schopenhauer's philosophy that contains the tools necessary to defend
negative utilitarianism and render it plausible.

Conclusion

**[[N]{.underline}]{.mark}**egative
**[[u]{.underline}]{.mark}**tilitarianism [will almost certainly [remain
**extremely** unattractive]{.mark} to vast majority]{.underline}. It is
most reasonable as a rule of thumb for 'positive' utilitarians concerned
by the difficulties of making people happy. [For it [to be]{.mark} a
[strong]{.mark}]{.underline}er [philosophical commitment, it is
necessary to [accept]{.mark} either that **[no]{.mark}** amount of
[**pleasure** can make up for]{.mark} the [**merest suffering**]{.mark}
or that happiness is an illusion, beyond our grasp. [Neither]{.mark} of
these [are]{.mark} likely to become [widely held]{.mark}
beliefs.]{.underline} However, enough people have been convinced of
these ideas that negative utilitarianism is far from as absurd as has
often been made out.

Notice the varying 'purity' of these different versions of negative
utilitarianism. Pragmatic negative utilitarianism, as a subordinate rule
of thumb to 'positive' utilitarianism, would cease to exist if we knew
how to make people happy as easily as we know how to ease their
suffering. Lexical negative utilitarianism would cease to be equivalent
to classical negative utilitarianism if all the suffering in the world
were to end. Pessimistic **[[n]{.underline}]{.mark}**egative
**[[u]{.underline}]{.mark}**tilitarianism [would **[collapse]{.mark}**
into positive utilitarianism [in a world where happiness
existed.]{.mark}]{.underline} Given the diminishing probability of these
conditions being met (from the perspective of the advocates of these
positions), it seems the pessimism produces a 'purer' version of
negative utilitarianism than the lexical version. Both, in turn, are
'purer' than pragmatic negative utilitarianism. However, none of these
doctrines actually go as far as to say that happiness, were it to exist,
is of no moral significance. Consequently, the search for 'pure'
negative utilitarianism goes on.

### AT: Iglesias\-\--1AR

#### Iglesias thinks we should [change]{.underline} our practices\-\--not die.

**Iglesias '18** \[Alejandro; October 24; Revista de Bioética y Derecho,
"The overwhelming prevalence of suffering in Nature," no. 42, pp.
181-195, https://www.redalyc.org/journal/783/78355381012/html/\]

Insofar as they are morally relevant properties, we should promote
pleasure and reduce pain with our acts. However, the question arises
whether both pleasure and pain can be symmetrically considered
(see Tomasik, 2016b, 2015). If this were so, then we would have to admit
that the fact of increasing the quantity of pleasure in 6 points on a
scale out of 10 in someone has the same moral relevance as reducing
suffering also in 6 points. Nevertheless, it [does not seem
**intuitive** to believe that making]{.underline} [someone **happy** has
the same **moral weight** as not making them **unhappy**]{.underline}
(Griffin, 1979). Rather, it seems to be the case that the [prevention of
suffering has **moral priority** over the increase of
**wellbeing**]{.underline}, as negative consequentialism holds.

[Even if we]{.underline} were to [**defend** the symmetry between
pleasure and pain we would find a huge **prevalence** of]{.underline}
[the last one]{.underline}. There is such a [**predominance** of
suffering]{.underline} in the world that almost the [same
conclusions]{.underline} [would **follow**]{.underline} if we maintained
a consequential negative theory, especially bearing in mind that the
vast majority of sentient individuals in nature are invertebrate animals
which follow the r-selection. Therefore, the conclusion that can be
drawn here is that, [in order to **prioritize** the maximization
of]{.underline} **[happiness]{.underline}**, existing amount of
[suffering should be **minimized**]{.underline}.

3.2. Measures to be implemented

[When it comes to discussing]{.underline} the [measures that could be
implemented to reduce the harm suffered by animals in the wild, it is
important to keep in mind the impact that human action has already had
on the number of invertebrate animals]{.underline}. It has been claimed
that during the anthropocene the population of invertebrates decreased
dramatically (Dirzo, et al., 2014). However, it has been also argued
that the population of the already most numerous type of invertebrate,
insects, is likely to increase due to global warming (Stange & Ayres,
2010; Tomasik, 2016c, 2008). In the light of this, [in order [to
reduce]{.mark} the [harm]{.mark} that animals suffer, it is necessary to
find a balance between the need to control the number of invertebrates
being born ―for example, through urbanization and the eradication of the
biggest focus of suffering (rainforests)― and global
warming]{.underline} (Tomasik, 2016d, 2015). The conclusion that Tomasik
(2016d, 2015) draws in this respect is that [it is necessary to
[promote]{.mark} research to determine the [ways]{.mark} in which we can
[reduce]{.mark} the [suffering of insects **without**]{.mark} this
having significant direct or indirect [effects on]{.mark} the **[rest of
sentient beings.]{.mark}**]{.underline}3

Section 2 pointed out that [[suffering prevails]{.mark} in nature mainly
[due to]{.mark} the **[early death]{.mark}** of sentient beings that
have not had many positive experiences. Thus, **[it is not]{.mark}**
even [necessary to accept]{.mark} an [**anti-frustrationist** or]{.mark}
a **[suffering-]{.mark}focused** [approach]{.mark}. Such an approach
[concludes]{.mark} that **[any neg]{.mark}ative [experience
means]{.mark} that [life]{.mark} is [not
worthwhile]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Benatar, 2006; Longueira, 2011), [and
[maintains]{.mark} that it [would have been]{.mark} more [positive
for]{.mark} most [invertebrates]{.mark} (especially arthropods) to
[not]{.mark} have been [born]{.mark}.]{.underline} This conclusion would
remain the same from an axiology not giving priority to avoiding
negative things over promoting positive things. For this reason, the
best way to minimize the amount of suffering on the planet may be
preventing sentient beings from reproducing, particularly those which
have enormous numbers of offspring.

Regarding invertebrate suffering, the important effect of human action
in a direct sense should not be underestimated. If the successive
conclusions we have reached are right, [we have a duty to
**[modify]{.mark}** some of our current [practices]{.mark}.]{.underline}
For example, we should [[refrain from]{.underline}]{.mark} feeding on
invertebrates such as snails (Tomasik, 2016e),
[[wearing]{.underline}]{.mark} animal materials such as
[[silk]{.underline}]{.mark} (Tomasik, 2016f), [[or
using]{.underline}]{.mark} prima facie
[[insecticides]{.underline}]{.mark} (Tomasik, 2016g, 2007), as all these
practices harm invertebrates. The duty to use anesthetics in research
with invertebrates ensues from our conclusions (Lockwood, 1987, 1988),
which rather suggest the eradication of this practice in favor of
alternatives that do not use beings which are sentient to some degree.

Conclusion

In this thesis I have argued for a version of NU. It is based on the
claims that negative experiences such as pain act as a trigger to
suffering while suffering magnifies these experiences and hinders one's
ability to function. This paper has shown that suffering is an
undesirable state of existence and [[while **some suffering**]{.mark} is
**[inevitable]{.mark}**, a moral philosophy focused on the minimization
and [alleviation]{.mark} of suffering [is possible.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Any philosophy focusing on the promotion of utility conceived in terms
of happiness ultimately fails in the task of addressing suffering, as
well as promoting its own end goal. [I have also shown that our existing
[economic]{.mark} [structure]{.mark} allows for suffering by [failing to
address]{.mark} underemployment and income
[inequality]{.mark}]{.underline}, both of which [act as]{.underline}
potential [sources of suffering. Government [policy]{.mark} has tools
that [can]{.mark} affect a redistribution of assets in order to
[create]{.mark} both [a more just society]{.mark} but one where overall
well-being of citizens is placed in the fore front of decision
making]{.underline}.

Could gravity be recreated on the Mars spacecraft? It is known that in a
rotating system, the [**centrifugal force** produces]{.underline} an
[acceleration]{.underline} that can be [used to recreate]{.underline} an
[equivalent of gravity]{.underline}. Unfortunately, there is [**[not
enough room]{.mark}** on]{.underline} a [spacecraft [to]{.mark}
**[incorporate]{.mark}** a [centrifuge]{.mark} in which cosmonauts could
spend]{.underline} a [**few hours a week**,]{.underline} which would be
[[sufficient to reduce]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**[physiological
damage]{.mark}** of microgravity]{.underline}.

Could the spacecraft itself be rotated? In Hollywood, yes, it\'s easy!
But [in real life, it\'s a **different story**]{.underline}. Given that
a spinning spacecraft would solve all the problems associated with
weightlessness, the [fact that **[no space agency]{.mark}** is [banking
on]{.mark}]{.underline} such a [[development]{.mark} shows]{.underline}
that [it is totally out of our reach **conceptually**, **technically**
and **financially**.]{.underline}

The [second major problem]{.underline} faced by potential future
Mars-bound astronauts [is]{.underline} that of [[radiation]{.mark} in
space]{.underline}. The **[Earth\'s double protection]{.underline}**
(atmosphere and magnetosphere) [partially blocks]{.underline} or
deflects [[UV]{.mark} rays and totally blocks **[X]{.mark}-rays** and
**[gamma]{.mark}** [rays]{.mark} as]{.underline} well as solar wind
particles and cosmic rays. This [protection has been **compared** to the
equivalent of]{.underline} a **[30-metre-thick concrete
wall]{.underline}**, or one made of 80 centimetres of lead. Once they
leave this natural barrier, it is essential that the astronauts be
protected in other ways, by means of the spaceship\'s insulation and/or
individual shields. [[Despite]{.underline}]{.mark} these
[[protections]{.underline}]{.mark}, [it is estimated]{.underline} that
[Martian [astronauts]{.mark} would [receive]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[**[maximum]{.mark} accepted [radiation]{.mark}** for]{.underline} an
[astronaut\'s entire career [over]{.mark}]{.underline} the [course of
**their [mission]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with just [over
**half**]{.underline} of this [[occurring during]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [**[outward]{.mark}** and **return [journeys]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

A [third major problem]{.underline} identified by the space agencies [is
**[human psychology]{.mark}**]{.underline}. French astronaut Thomas
Pesquet cites a good example of the [psychological pressure]{.underline}
[astronauts face on the ISS]{.underline}: you know [there will
inevitably be problems]{.underline} during your stay, [but you don\'t
want to be the one to cause them]{.underline}. The
[**[pressure]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} a **Mars**-bound [crew]{.mark} would
be **[infinitely greater]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [as there would be **no
help** available]{.underline} to them in the event of a major problem.
On the ISS, astronauts can be returned to Earth within three hours. The
[Martian astronauts]{.underline} would be [left to their own devices
for]{.underline} the **[two-and-a-half years]{.underline}** of their
mission, [knowing]{.underline} that the [[slightest
error]{.underline}]{.mark} or failure, whether technical or human, could
[[result in]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[death]{.mark} of the entire
crew]{.underline}**. It is impossible to test such a psychological
situation on Earth. The Mars 500 psychological isolation experiment
conducted by the European Space Agency developed [methods of **[conflict
resolution]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but it [is [in no way representative
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**[real conditions]{.mark}** of a

### AT: Animal Suffering\-\--2AC

#### The [intrinsic value of nature]{.underline} outweighs [the suffering animals]{.underline}\-\--subjective [human valuation]{.underline} of [naturalness]{.underline} overcomes [duties of beneficence]{.underline}. 

**Palmer '21** \[Clare; September 27; Professor of Philosophy and the
George T. and Gladys H. Abell Professor of Liberal Arts at Texas AM;
Philosophia, "The Value of Wild Nature: Comments on Kyle Johannsen's
Wild Animal Ethics," Volume 50, pages 853-863\]

3 [Is ["naturalness"]{.mark} a Source of **[Intrinsic
Value]{.mark}**]{.underline}?

Johannsen's second claim in Chapter 2 is that naturalness is not a
source of intrinsic value. This claim, however, is open to many
interpretations, given the multiple possible meanings of both
"naturalness" and "intrinsic value". Johannsen defines "naturalness" as
"that which exists or occurs independently of human agency" (p.18). This
definition of naturalness is broadly in line those frequently used in
environmental philosophy, for instance Mathews (2005: 27) who sees
naturalness as the distinction between: "what happens when things are
allowed to unfold in their own way, or run their own course, and what
happens when, under the direction of abstract thought, agents
intentionally intervene in a course of events to superimpose on it a set
of abstractly conceived ends of their own." However, Mathews' definition
is more precise than Johannsen's, inasmuch as [the relevant [human
agency]{.mark} that [disrupts]{.mark} naturalness is clearly intentional
and rational, about a set of "abstractly conceived" [human
ends]{.mark}]{.underline}. This will be of importance, as I'll suggest
later, in terms of thinking about Johannsen's interventionist proposals.

Let's move to the second part of Johanssen's claim. What does he mean by
saying that naturalness is "not a source of intrinsic value"?

As Sandler (2012) points out, intrinsic value can be "sourced" in
different ways; most prominently it can (a) be created subjectively by
valuers through their evaluative attitudes or judgments, or (b) be
understood as a valuable property that exists independently of anyone's
evaluative attitudes or judgments. Johannsen doesn't explicitly comment
on this issue, and it turns out to matter here; my comments are based on
what I think is the most plausible interpretation of his text.

Johannsen appears to interpret intrinsic value in the second sense
above, as what Sandler (2012) calls the "natural historical"
interpretation of naturalness. Here, [naturalness is understood as
something objectively valuable, which we discover rather than create
through evaluative attitudes and judgments, and which is a property of
things and processes that are independent of human design and
control]{.underline}. Naturalness in this sense, Johannsen maintains, is
not a source of intrinsic value. And while on some metaethical views, of
course, the "natural historical" idea of the intrinsic value of
naturalness can be defended, I'll just accept Johannsen's position here.

However, this still leaves us with naturalness as intrinsic value in
Sandler's first sense, as being created subjectively by valuers through
their evaluative attitudes and judgments. And here Johannsen's denial
that naturalness is a source of intrinsic value appears to run into
difficulties. [**Naturalness** -- at least, in the form of [wildness
in]{.mark} places[, landscapes and animals]{.mark} -- does seem to be
[widely]{.mark} **subjectively [valued]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For sure,
some of this value is instrumental. Johannsen notes, for instance, that
some people value natural environments instrumentally because they
(erroneously, on his view) believe that these environments are good for
the welfare of the wild animals in them. But a [significant amount of
this valuation of naturalness or wildness in places, landscapes
[and]{.mark} animals **[doesn't]{.mark}** obviously [seem
**instrumental**]{.mark} at all.]{.underline}

[The value of wildness]{.underline}, for instance, [is deeply embedded
in the US wilderness tradition; the US Wilderness Act (1964) protects
areas: "where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by
man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain" and land that
retains "its primeval character and influence, without permanent
improvements or human habitation."]{.underline} In 2001, the US National
Survey on Recreation and the Environment found that 89% of those
surveyed agreed with the statement "I support protecting wilderness
areas just so they will always exist in their natural condition, even if
no one were to ever visit or otherwise benefit from them" (emphasis
mine).2

[The value of wildness also has international uptake in rapidly growing
**rewilding movements**, wherever in the world they are
located]{.underline}. The Rewilding Institute's basic conviction is that
"most of the world ought to be wild, that extinction is the overarching
crisis of our time, and that we modern humans have an ethical obligation
to protect and restore wild Nature."3 [While rewilding projects may
initially include human activities that aim to undo past human
interventions]{.underline} (by, for instance, removing dams or
reintroducing species) [the goal is to "step back and let nature manage
itself"]{.underline}.4 Whether one agrees with these claims or not, it
seems hard to deny that many people actually do subjectively
intrinsically value wildness or naturalness.

Does Johannsen have anything to say about subjectively valuing wildness
or naturalness? He gets closest to discussing the subjective intrinsic
value of nature in his response to Robert Elliot's paper, "Faking
Nature" (Johannsen, 2020: 23). In this paper, Elliot famously argues
that in the case of a planned ecological destruction and restoration,
the restoration, however perfect it may appear, has less value (and here
Elliot means less subjective intrinsic value) than the original. This is
because, Elliot claims, a restoration has the wrong origin; it is a
product of human artifice, not of wild nature; and one of the things we
value about wild places is just that they are not products of human
artifice. (Interestingly, Elliot's account may suggest that rewilding
can't create the naturalness value rewilders claim, since rewilding at
least kicks of with a deliberate human intervention, even if the
ultimate goal is to step back and let "Nature" manage itself. However,
all I need to defend here is the claim that people intrinsically value
wildness or naturalness; they may disagree over when exactly such wild
states exist.)

Johannsen's response to Elliot doesn't convincingly show that Elliot's
claims are mistaken. First, Johannsen seems to take it that Elliot is
defending the aesthetic value of wild places. Although Elliot does
compare faking nature to faking art, [his [worry about the loss of
naturalness]{.mark} is not aesthetic; the framework [is]{.mark} very
[clearly]{.mark} an **[ethical]{.mark} one**]{.underline}.5

Second, Johannsen claims that what's really being valued in Elliot's
worry that restorations are faked nature is originality, not
naturalness. I don't really understand his argument here.
[[What's]{.mark} [valued]{.mark} about an art original over a fake
[is]{.mark} that it has [a particular kind of origin]{.mark} -- that of
the original artist]{.underline}. And surely what's being said in
Elliot's argument is that we value a particular kind of origin for
certain places, systems and beings: [ones [that are not products of
human agency]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It is **natural origin** that's
being **valued**.]{.underline}

Third, Johannsen suggests that Elliot's discussion confounds our
judgment by providing a context of imitations and replacements for us to
contemplate natural values. If, on the other hand, we were confronted by
two barren islands, one that was seeded naturally, and the other by
people, then it's not obvious at all that we'd especially value the
naturally seeded island. Indeed, Johannsen says, we might value the
skills of the gardeners in the second case (ie, we might value the
excellence of the human origin, not the natural one).

Johannsen may be correct up to a point here; we might indeed value the
ingenuity of human gardeners and the beauty they produce; but then, this
isn't something that Elliot denies. He doesn't claim that only
naturalness value matters. However, key to Elliot's argument is that in
a [world in which so much is now anthropogenic, [people]{.mark} also
[value that which has **not** been produced by **human beings**]{.mark},
but by the spontaneity [and creativity of natural
processes]{.mark}]{.underline} (Rolston, 1986); [what happens "when
things are allowed to unfold in their own way, or run their own
course]{.underline}," to return to Mathews' earlier definition.

4 Why Naturalness Value Matters

This brings me to try to respond to what I think is Johannsen's real
challenge. I don't think he really wants to deny that many people
subjectively intrinsically value wild nature. Rather, I think his real
claim is either that people lack any justification for intrinsically
valuing wild nature, or that if there is any such justification,
"wildness" value is fundamentally trivial. This comes out especially
prominently when he discusses (p.24) the destruction of beautiful things
(again based on the view that naturalness value is primarily aesthetic).
[We should]{.underline}, he says, [normally avoid destroying beautiful
things, because doing so deprives others of the chance to see
them.]{.underline} But in the situation where one was given the choice
between assaulting a person and a painting, "one should obviously
assault the painting." On this analogy, it would always be better to
destroy an artwork than to harm a person.

And yet, there have been many occasions when human lives were risked --
and lost -- to protect great works of art. Jamieson (1998) notes:
"During the second world war Churchill evacuated art from London to the
countryside in order to protect it from the blitz. Resources devoted to
this evacuation could have been allocated to life-saving. Although he
may not have represented the decision in this way, Churchill made the
judgment that evacuating the art was more important than saving some
number of humans." Equally, the life-risking activities of the so-called
Monuments Men---two of whom were killed---in attempting to protect and
retrieve artworks from the Nazis during the Second World War provides
further evidence that certain works of art can be valued so highly that
people are willing to risk their lives to protect them.

There is, of course, an ethical debate to be had about whether any
artwork, singly or in combination with other artworks, is worth risking
or losing a life for. But my point here is just that it's worth debating
rather than dismissing; that [the intrinsic value of certain artworks
could be so significant that the loss of such art could be weighed
against the loss of human lives]{.underline}.

I want to make a similar claim about the way people intrinsically value
wild nature (where many people have also been willing to put their lives
on the line): [[the intrinsic value of]{.mark} certain [**wild places**
or processes]{.mark} could be [so significant]{.mark} that [they could
be weighed against]{.mark} **wild [animal
suffering]{.mark}**]{.underline} ([[even assuming]{.mark} one accepted
[strong duties of beneficence to relieve]{.mark} such
[suffering]{.mark}, which as I noted earlier, I don't accept that there
are).]{.underline}

My claim isn't [that [if many people intrinsically value
something]{.mark}, then [we necessarily have **reason to protect
it**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Obviously, people can value things that are
not worth valuing (such as their own race). Rather, my claim is this:
Suppose, as seems plausible, that [many people have at least as good a
justification for intrinsically valuing certain wild places or processes
as they have to value certain artworks]{.underline}. Then the
destruction of this value should carry weight in moral -- and
political---decision making, even if the value doesn't always, or often,
trump other values at stake. But then: what would count as a good
justification for intrinsically valuing wildness?

Philosophia, "The Value of Wild Nature: Comments on Kyle Johannsen's
Wild Animal Ethics," Volume 50, pages 853-863\]

My point here, however, is not to follow Mikkelson by arguing that views
like Johannsen's are mistaken, and that (whether for particular
r-selected species-populations, or more generally) positive experiences
in fact outweigh negative experiences among wild animals. My point is
rather that I don't believe we know. After all, [[making]{.mark}
external [judgments about]{.mark} other people's inner [experiences
is]{.mark} highly [unreliable]{.mark} even in the human
case]{.underline}. We see people with desperately difficult lives who
don't appear to think that, from the inside, their lives are not worth
living; [studies indicate that most individuals who have had [major
health setbacks]{.mark}, for instance becoming paraplegic, [still
report]{.mark} that their [**lives are more happy**]{.mark} than
unhappy]{.underline} (eg Brickman, Coates and Janof-Bulman, 1978). So[,
we have reason to be cautious about making claims that, based on our
perception of external circumstances, human lives are terrible or not
worth living]{.underline}. [And the idea [that we can]{.mark} currently
[make general judgments about]{.mark} the welfare of members of [**whole
species** without]{.mark} doing a significant amount of
[research]{.mark} into their lives seems [even **less
secure**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [To **know more** about those wall lizard
lives would mean carrying out **empirical studies** of [how]{.mark}
particular [populations live]{.mark} on a [day-to-day]{.mark} basis,
whether states such as malnutrition or injury are generally common,
levels of stress hormones such as cortisol, how these wall lizards
usually die, how long the dying process usually takes, [and]{.mark} so
on. It's **not** even **obvious** [that we could **extrapolate**]{.mark}
from one population to other populations.]{.underline} [And this
empirical research [would]{.mark} also [need to be combined with]{.mark}
an [account of what good and bad]{.mark} wall lizard [welfare should be
understood to be]{.mark}.]{.underline} This might be based on something
like the 5-Domains model, where welfare is understood in terms of
subjective positive or negative experiences or "affects" that are
brought about by a combination of various physical/functional states
(such as nutrition and health) and external circumstances (Mellor,
2017). The 5-Domains model of animal welfare (like most dominant models)
understands welfare in terms of subjective experiences, rather than
factors that can be directly measured, such as cortisol levels. [But
[getting a secure understanding of]{.mark} the [subjective
experiences]{.mark} of a species like wall lizards seems to be a
challenging task; making such assessments even for much more familiar,
well studied species such as domestic cattle has been both **[difficult
and controversial]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This [all makes me doubtful
that, at present at least, we could justify confidence one way or the
other about the welfare of individuals of any particular **r-selected
population**]{.underline}. I am certainly skeptical of making such
extrapolations about all populations of all r-selected species,
[[especially **independently** of]{.mark} their [interactions with
**human beings**]{.mark}.1]{.underline}

Welfare with a Human-Centric Approach," Volume 4, pages 77--92\]

The ever-increasing global demand for animal products necessitates
innovative solutions to improve animal welfare while maintaining
economic viability for farmers. [[Animal welfare]{.mark}, once
considered merely a moral imperative, has now come to be [recognized
as]{.mark} an [**essential**]{.mark} element in sustainable
**[agriculture]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Its multidimensional nature
encompasses the physical health, mental well-being, and natural behavior
of livestock \[1\]. [The welfare of animals has profound implications
not only [for ethical]{.mark} and social [reasons but also for **product
quality**]{.mark}, **disease control**, [and environmental]{.mark}
impact.]{.underline} Thus, [improving **animal welfare** is a **shared
responsibility** of farmers, technologists, policymakers, and
consumers]{.underline} \[2\].

In the pursuit of superior animal welfare practices, objective
indicators have emerged as indispensable tools for informed
decision-making \[3\]. They provide a means to quantify and monitor
welfare status, enabling early detection of potential issues, measuring
the impact of interventions, and facilitating continuous improvement.
Traditional assessment methods, relying on subjective evaluations or
periodic physical examinations, can be labor-intensive, time-consuming,
and prone to inconsistency \[4\]. The complexity of animal welfare, with
its intricate interplay of physical, physiological, and behavioral
factors, calls for more comprehensive and objective assessment methods.

[This is where the role of [sensor technology and]{.mark} artificial
intelligence (**[AI]{.mark}**) becomes **paramount**]{.underline}. In
the age of digital transformation, [these technologies offer compelling
solutions to [**revolutionize**]{.mark} livestock
[farming]{.mark}]{.underline} \[5\]. [Sensor technologies, including
[wearable devices]{.mark} and environmental monitoring systems, can
continuously [capture]{.mark} a vast array of **[data]{.mark} points**,
such as body temperature, heart rate, movement patterns, feeding
behavior, and environmental conditions. When coupled [with AI]{.mark}
algorithms, these data can [provide]{.mark} real-time,
[objective,]{.mark} and holistic [insights into]{.mark} animal
[welfare]{.mark}]{.underline} \[6\]. AI's prowess in handling large data
sets allows for precise and predictive analysis, [[making it possible to
preempt health issues]{.mark}, **[optimize living conditions]{.mark}**,
and promote natural behaviors.]{.underline}

However, the successful deployment of these advanced technologies
fundamentally depends on one crucial factor--- the farmer. A
farmer-centric approach is vital to ensure that technologies truly serve
the needs of farmers and the welfare of animals \[7, 8[\]. [Farmers'
**deep-rooted understanding** of their animals]{.mark} and their
environments must be [the guiding force]{.mark} behind technological
advancements. Technology should be a tool to enhance farmers'
capabilities, not to override them]{.underline}. A farmer-centric
approach facilitates the design of intuitive, practical, and affordable
solutions \[9\]. Moreover, it promotes technology acceptance and proper
usage, ultimately leading to sustainable and effective animal welfare
management.

To enhance the synergy between human expertise and AI, the farmer's
deep-rooted understanding of their livestock and surroundings must guide
technological advancements. The transformative power of AI and sensor
technologies in elevating animal welfare within livestock farming is
evident. This paper delves into the nuances of objective animal welfare
metrics, the importance of a farmer-centric approach, and the broader
ethical and societal ramifications. By doing so, it bridges the gap
between cutting-edge technological progress and its human stakeholders,
offering a fresh and innovative viewpoint.

Th[e [integration of AI]{.mark} and sensor technologies [in]{.mark}to
the [ag]{.mark}ricultural sector is not just about the introduction of
new tools but about [a **paradigm shift**]{.mark} in how we approach
farm]{.underline}ing. It\'s about merging the age-old wisdom of farmers
with the cutting-edge advancements of the modern age. [This
[synergy]{.mark} can [lead to a]{.mark} more [harmonious
relationship]{.mark} between humans and animals, [where
tech]{.mark}nology [aids in]{.mark} understanding and [**catering**
to]{.mark} the [needs]{.mark} of **livestock**, [rather than]{.mark}
merely **[exploiting]{.mark}** them for maximum yield.]{.underline}

Furthermore, the ethical considerations surrounding the use of AI in
farming are paramount. As we move towards a more digitized world,
questions about data privacy, security, and the ethical treatment of
animals become more pressing. The data generated from these technologies
is vast and can be used in various ways, both beneficial and potentially
harmful. It\'s crucial to have robust guidelines and regulations in
place to ensure that this data is used responsibly and ethically.

The exploration of sensor technologies and AI in livestock farming marks
a critical juncture in the evolution of agriculture. As we stand on the
brink of this exciting frontier, we must ensure that our journey is
guided by a holistic vision, integrating scientific innovation, ethical
responsibility, and social equity. This is the pathway to a future of
livestock farming where technology, animals, and humans harmoniously
coexist, fostering a symbiotic relationship that nurtures the welfare of
all.

The digital transformation of the agricultural sector is not without its
challenges. The rapid pace of technological advancement can sometimes
outstrip the ability of regulatory bodies and ethical frameworks to keep
up. This can lead to situations where technology is deployed without
fully understanding its long-term implications. It's essential to
approach this transformation with a sense of caution and responsibility,
ensuring that we do not lose sight of the fundamental principles of
animal welfare and sustainable farming.

Moreover, the role of the farmer in this digital age cannot be
overstated. While technology can provide tools and insights, it is the
farmer who must make the fnal decisions about how to care for their
livestock. [The farmer's deep understanding of their animals, honed over
years of experience, cannot be replicated by any algorithm or
sensor]{.underline}. It\'s essential to ensure that as we move forward,
we do not lose this invaluable human touch.

In [the end, the goal is to create a future where technology and
humanity work hand in hand to create a more sustainable, ethical, and
prosperous **agricultural** **sector**]{.underline}. A future where we
harness the power of AI and sensors to enhance the welfare of animals,
while also respecting the rights and needs of farmers and consumers.
This is the vision that drives our research and the message we hope to
convey through this review.
