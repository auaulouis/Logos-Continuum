What are China's ambitions, and does it have a grand strategy to achieve
them? If it does, what is that strategy, what shapes it, and what should
the United States do about it?

As we enter this new stretch of acute competition, we lack answers to
critical foundational questions. [What are China's
ambitions]{.underline}, and does it have a grand strategy to achieve
them? If it does, what is that strategy, what shapes it, and what should
the United States do about it? These are [basic questions for American
**policymakers** grappling with this century's greatest **geopolitical
challenge**]{.underline}, not least because knowing an opponent's
strategy is the first step to countering it. And yet, as great power
tensions flare, there is no consensus on the answers.

This book attempts to provide an answer. In its argument and structure,
the book takes its inspiration in part from Cold War studies of US grand
strategy.5 Where those works analyzed the theory and practice of US
"strategies of containment" toward the Soviet Union during the Cold War,
this book seeks to analyze the theory and practice of China's
"strategies of displacement" toward the United States after the Cold
War.

To do so, the book makes use of [an original [database of
**C**]{.mark}hinese **[C]{.mark}**ommunist **[P]{.mark}**arty
**[documents]{.mark}**]{.underline}---memoirs, biographies, and daily
records of senior officials---painstakingly [gathered and then
**[digitized]{.mark}**]{.underline} over the last several years from
libraries, bookstores in Taiwan and Hong Kong, and Chinese e-commerce
sites (see Appendix). Many of the documents [take readers
behind]{.underline} the [closed doors of the **C**hinese **C**ommunist
**P**arty]{.underline}, bring them into its high-level foreign policy
institutions and meetings, and introduce readers to a wide cast of
Chinese political leaders, generals, and diplomats charged with devising
and implementing China's grand strategy. While no one master document
contains all of Chinese grand strategy, its outline can be found across
a wide corpus of texts. Within them, the Party uses hierarchical
statements that represent internal consensus on key issues to guide the
ship of state, and these statements can be traced across time. The most
important of these is the Party line (路线), then the guideline (方针),
and finally the policy (政策), among other terms. Understanding them
sometimes requires proficiency not only in Chinese, but also in
seemingly impenetrable and archaic ideological concepts like
"dialectical unities" and "historical materialism."

Argument in Brief

The book argues that [the [core of]{.mark} **US-China
[competition]{.mark}**]{.underline} since the Cold War [has [been
over]{.mark} **regional** and now **[global
order]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [It focuses on]{.underline} the
[strategies]{.underline} that [**rising powers** like **[China]{.mark}**
use to [displace]{.mark} an established **hegemon** like [the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline} short of war. A
[**[hegemon]{.mark}**'s position in]{.underline} regional and global
[order [emerges from]{.mark} three]{.underline} broad "[forms of
**[control]{.mark}**]{.underline}" [that are used to
regulate]{.underline} the [behavior of other states]{.underline}:
[coercive **[capability]{.mark}**]{.underline} (to force compliance),
[consensual **inducements**]{.underline} (to incentivize it), [[and
**legitimacy**]{.underline}]{.mark} (to rightfully command it). For
rising states, the act of peacefully displacing the hegemon consists of
two broad strategies generally pursued in sequence. The first strategy
is to blunt the hegemon's exercise of those forms of control,
particularly those extended over the rising state; after all, no rising
state can displace the hegemon if it remains at the hegemon's mercy. The
second is to build forms of control over others; indeed, no rising state
can become a hegemon if it cannot secure the deference of other states
through coercive threats, consensual inducements, or rightful
legitimacy. Unless a rising power has first blunted the hegemon, efforts
to build order are likely to be futile and easily opposed. And until a
rising power has successfully conducted a good degree of blunting and
building in its home region, it remains too vulnerable to the hegemon's
influence to confidently turn to a third strategy, global expansion,
which pursues both blunting and building at the global level to displace
the hegemon from international leadership. Together, these strategies at
the regional and then global levels provide a rough means of ascent for
the Chinese Communist Party's nationalist elites, who seek to restore
China to its due place and roll back the historical aberration of the
West's overwhelming global influence.

[This is [a template **China**]{.mark} has
**[followed]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and in its review of China's
strategies of displacement, the book argues that shifts from one
strategy to the next have been triggered by sharp discontinuities in the
most important variable shaping Chinese grand strategy: its perception
of US power and threat. China's first strategy of displacement
(1989--2008) was to quietly blunt American power over China,
particularly in Asia, and it emerged after the traumatic trifecta of
Tiananmen Square, the Gulf War, and the Soviet collapse led Beijing to
sharply increase its perception of US threat. China's second strategy of
displacement (2008--2016) sought to build the foundation for regional
hegemony in Asia, and it was launched after the Global Financial Crisis
led Beijing to see US power as diminished and emboldened it to take a
more confident approach. Now, with the invocation of "great changes
unseen in a century" following Brexit, President Trump's election, and
the coronavirus pandemic, [[China is launching a]{.mark} **third
[strategy]{.mark}** of **displacement**]{.underline}, [one that expands
its **blunting** and **building** efforts]{.underline} worldwide [[to
**displace** the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [as the **global
leader**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In its final chapters, this book uses
insights about China's strategy to formulate an asymmetric US grand
strategy in response---one that takes a page from China's own book---and
would seek to contest China's regional and global ambitions without
competing dollar-for-dollar, ship-for-ship, or loan-for-loan.

Order abroad is often a reflection of order at home, and [[**China**'s
order]{.mark}-**building** [would be]{.mark} distinctly
**[illiberal]{.mark}** relative to US]{.underline}
order-**[building]{.underline}**.

The book also illustrates what Chinese order might look like if China is
able to achieve its goal of "national rejuvenation" by the centennial of
the founding of the People's Republic of China in 2049. At the regional
level, [China]{.underline} already [accounts for]{.underline} more than
[half of **Asian GDP**]{.underline} and half of all Asian military
spending, [which is pushing the region **out of balance** and [toward a
Chinese **s**]{.mark}phere **[o]{.mark}**f
**[i]{.mark}**nfluence]{.underline}. A fully realized [Chinese order
might]{.underline} eventually [involve]{.underline} the [withdrawal of
US forces from **Japan** and **Korea**]{.underline}, the end of American
regional alliances, the effective removal of the US Navy from the
Western Pacific, [deference from China's regional
neighbors]{.underline}, [unification with **Taiwan**]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} the [resolution of]{.underline} territorial [disputes
in the **E**ast and **S**outh **C**hina **S**eas]{.underline}. Chinese
order would likely be more coercive than the present order, consensual
in ways that primarily benefit connected elites even at the expense of
voting publics, and considered legitimate mostly to those few who it
directly rewards. [[China would deploy]{.mark} this order]{.underline}
in ways that damage liberal values, [with [**authoritarian**
winds]{.mark}]{.underline} blowing stronger [across the
**region**]{.underline}. Order abroad is often a reflection of order at
home, and [China's order-building would be]{.underline} distinctly
**[illiberal]{.underline}** relative [to US]{.underline}
order-[building]{.underline}.

At the global level, [Chinese order would involve]{.underline} seizing
the opportunities of the "great changes unseen in a century" and
[**displacing** the **U**nited **S**tates as the world's leading
state]{.underline}. [This would require]{.underline} successfully
[managing the]{.underline} principal [risk flowing from the]{.underline}
"great [changes]{.underline}"---Washington's unwillingness to gracefully
accept decline---by weakening the forms of control supporting American
global order while strengthening those forms of control supporting a
Chinese alternative. That order would span a "zone of super-ordinate
influence" in Asia as well as "partial hegemony" in swaths of the
developing world that might gradually expand to encompass the world's
industrialized centers---a vision some Chinese popular writers describe
using Mao's revolutionary guidance to "surround the cities from the
countryside" \[农村包围城市\].6 More authoritative sources put this
approach in less sweeping terms, suggesting [[Chinese **order** would be
**anchored** in]{.mark} China's **[B]{.mark}**elt and **[R]{.mark}**oad
**[I]{.mark}**nitiative]{.underline} and its Community of Common
Destiny, [with the former]{.underline} in particular [[creating networks
of **coercive capability**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [consensual
**inducement**]{.underline}, [[and **legitimacy**]{.underline}]{.mark}.7

1, "China\'s Threat to Global Democracy," 65-79.

Second, China's illiberal campaign capitalizes on a disturbing global
trend: As Freedom House reports, authoritarianism has spread during
every year since 2006, while democracy has retreated. This "democratic
recession" has given China a window of ideological opportunity to
promote a vision of a hierarchical and harmonious society and a critique
of a disorderly and decadent West. Around the world, public faith in
democratic institutions has sunk to lows not seen since the 1930s. The
[[**political soil** has grown **ripe** for **authoritarianism**]{.mark}
to take root, and **China**, **Russia**, and other authoritarian states
are **fertilizing** this antidemocratic plant with **digital
disinformation**]{.underline} that their propagandists pump into the
social-media feeds of billions worldwide.21

[The]{.underline} third and **[most important]{.underline}** [factor
**supercharging** China's efforts is the ongoing **digital
revolution**]{.underline}.22 The CCP possesses data-collection and
messaging power to rival that of Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Google, and
Twitter.23 [By combining]{.underline} artificial intelligence ([**AI**)
and "**big data**" with **cyber**, **biometric**, and speech- and
facial-recognition **tech**nologies, [Beijing]{.mark} is pioneering a
system that [will allow **dictators** to know **everything**]{.mark}
about their subjects]{.underline}---what people are saying and viewing,
whom they hang out with, what they like and dislike, and where they are
located at any given time---and to discipline citizens instantly by
restricting their access to credit, education, employment, medical care,
telecommunications, and travel if not to hunt them down for more
medieval forms of punishment.

[[This **tech**]{.mark}**nological [revolution]{.mark}** [threatens
to]{.mark} **upend** the **global balance** between democracy and
authoritarianism by [mak]{.mark}ing [**repression** more **affordable
and effective**]{.mark}]{.underline} than ever.24 Instead of relying on
expensive and potentially rebellious armies to brutalize a resentful
population, an autocrat will now have more insidious means of control.
Millions of spies can be replaced with hundreds of millions of
unblinking cameras. Facial-recognition technologies can rapidly sort
through video feeds and identify troublemakers. Bots can deliver
propaganda tailored to specific groups. Malware can be installed on
computers through seemingly innocuous apps or links, and then government
hackers can crash the computer networks of dissidents or gather
information on their operations. That information, in turn, can be used
to coopt resistance movements by bribing their leaders or meeting their
more innocuous demands. Alternatively, [[authorities]{.mark} can [print
out an AI-assembled list of]{.mark} **alleged [activists]{.mark}** [and
**kill everyone**]{.mark} on it]{.underline}.

The evil genius of this "digital authoritarianism" is that most people
will be seemingly free to go about their daily lives. In truth, however,
the state will be constantly censoring everything they see and tracking
everything they do. With old-school authoritarianism, one at least knew
where the oppression was coming from. But now people can be nudged and
cajoled by invisible algorithms delivering personalized content to their
phones. In past eras, autocrats had to make tough choices between
funding death squads or economic development. Today, however, repression
is not only affordable, but also profitable, because "smart-city"
technologies that enable tight social control can also be used to fight
crime, diagnose diseases, and make the trains run on time.

These technologies are a tyrant's dream. Recognizing this demand,
Chinese companies were already selling and operating surveillance
systems in more than eighty countries as of 2020.25 As the CCP feels
increasingly threatened at home and abroad, there is every reason to
expect Beijing to export digital authoritarianism farther and wider.
Many countries already want it, and China has powerful tools to compel
those that do not. Want access to the vast PRC market? Let Huawei
install the core components of your 5G network. Want a Chinese loan?
Accept PRC surveillance technology in your capital city.

[As more governments **partner** with Beijing, the reach of **[China's
surveillance]{.mark} state** [will grow]{.mark}]{.underline}.26
[**Existing** [autocracies]{.mark} will [become]{.mark} **more
[totalitarian]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and some [democracies]{.mark}
will **drift** into the [authoritarian]{.mark} camp]{.underline}.
[International **[conflicts]{.mark}** will likely
**[proliferate]{.mark}**]{.underline}---not merely those of ideas but
those of arms, for as Putin's invasion of Ukraine illustrates,
[dictatorship often turns to **blood-and-soil nationalism** and
**violent revanchism**]{.underline}. The liberal belief that democracy
and peace are destined to spread around the world will be upended. So
will the comforting myth that humanity has evolved past the point of
mass atrocities, because [digital authoritarianism does not **displace**
gulags and genocide; it **enables** them]{.underline}. When
dictatorships ramp up digital repression, they also engage in more
torture and murder.27 [Computers and cameras handling **everyday
surveillance** free the regime's foot soldiers for tasks such as
**ethnic cleansing** and **beating dissidents** into
submission]{.underline}. Xinjiang, with its smart cities and
concentration camps, offers a glimpse of this dire future.28

### Impact\-\--Authoritarianism

#### Global authoritarianism causes [extinction]{.underline} from [tech risks]{.underline}, [miscalculation]{.underline}, and [pandemics]{.underline}.

**Belfield '23** \[Haydn; March 29; Research Associate and Academic
Project Manager at the University of Cambridge\'s Centre for the Study
of Existential Risk; How Worlds Collapse, "Collapse, Recovery, and
Existential Risk," pp. 74-76\]

[A world **dominated** by **[totalitarian states]{.mark}**
would]{.underline} be more incompetent, more war-prone, less
cooperative, and more inhibitive of progress than one dominated by
democratic states. Our current world is not particularly competent,
peaceful, cooperative, or progressive---a totalitarian-dominated world
would be worse. It would increase the [[risk]{.underline}]{.mark} of
another collapse and **[[extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}** and could
shape the future toward less desirable trajectories (Beckstead, 2013).

[Totalitarian states are]{.underline} incompetent. They are [[bad
at]{.mark} **forecasting** and [**dealing with**
disasters]{.mark}]{.underline} (Caplan, 2008).16 This can be seen most
clearly in the great famines of Communist China and the USSR, in which
millions died (Applebaum, 2017; Becker, 1996; Dikotter, 2010; Snyder,
2010). In comparison, functioning multiparty democracies rarely, if
ever, experience famines (Sen, 2010). "Established autocracies" (or
"personal"/"sultanist") are particularly bad, as there are few checks or
restraints on arbitrary rule and the whims and ideology of the single
individual, even from other elites (Svolik, 2012). From the inside, the
"inner circle" around Mao, Stalin, and Hitler seems incredibly chaotic,
with elites strongly incentivized to conceal information and encouraged
by the autocrat to squabble and feud---so they are divided (Conquest,
1992; Kershaw, 2008; Zhang & Halliday, 2006). If totalitarian states are
worse at addressing social, environmental, and technological problems,
then [a world dominated by them would]{.underline} likely [be **worse**
at responding to risks of **collapse** and **extinction**]{.underline}.

A world dominated by totalitarian states is [more likely to have **major
wars**]{.underline}. States with near-universal adult suffrage rarely
(if ever) go to war with one another (Barnhart et al., 2020), so a world
dominated by democracies has fewer wars. [**[Miscalc]{.mark}**ulation
might be [a]{.mark} particular [problem]{.mark}]{.underline} for
totalitarian states [[due to]{.mark} **personalization** and
[**disincentives** for **accurate
info**]{.mark}**rmation**]{.underline}, leading to well-known strategic
disasters such as Hitler and Stalin's blunders in World War II (Bialer,
1970; Noakes & Pridham, 2001), or at a smaller level, Saddam Hussein's
rejection of diplomacy (Atkinson, 1993). [[War
makes]{.underline}]{.mark} collapse and [[extinction]{.mark} more
[likely]{.mark}, by [raising the chance of
**w**]{.mark}]{.underline}eapons of **[[m]{.underline}]{.mark}**ass
**[[d]{.underline}]{.mark}**e**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}**truction being
used.

Linked to this, [[totalitarian states are **less
cooperative**]{.underline}]{.mark} than democratic states. While
cooperation is possible (Ginsburg, 2020), their internal norms are
characterized by paranoia and treachery, and [their [**lack of
transparency** limits]{.mark} their [ability to **credibly
commit**]{.mark} to **agreements**]{.underline}. This is [[bad
for]{.underline}]{.mark} all risks that require cooperation such as
[[**pandemics** or **climate change**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Tomasik,
2015).

Finally, [continued **social** and **[scientific
progress]{.mark}**]{.underline} is likely to [[reduce risks
of]{.underline}]{.mark} collapse and
**[[extinction]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Social progress could [reduce
**global inequality**]{.underline} and other risk factors. Scientific
progress could help address natural risks and [climate
change]{.underline} (Sandberg, 2018), differentially increase defensive
rather than [offensive power]{.underline} (Garfinkel & Dafoe, 2019),
[[and solve]{.mark} **safety challenges** in [**AI**]{.mark} or
**biotech**nology]{.underline} (Russell, 2019). However, as we will now
discuss totalitarian states would likely inhibit social progress.

A central question from a longtermist perspective is: Which values
should shape the future? I would argue that we should prefer it to be
shaped by liberal democratic values. This is not to say that the current
democracy-dominated world is perfect---far from it. The fate of billions
of factory-farmed animals or hundreds of millions of people in extreme
poverty makes that abundantly clear. However, democracies have two
advantages. First, democracies have space for cosmopolitan values such
as human rights, plurality, freedom, and equality. These are better than
those that characterize life under totalitarianism: Fear, terror,
subjection, and secrecy. Second, they have within themselves the
mechanism to allow progress. In the last 100 (or even 50) years, the
lives of women, LGBT people, religious minorities, and non-white people
have dramatically improved. Our "moral circle" has expanded, and could
continue to expand (Singer, 1981). The arc of the moral universe is
long, but given the right conditions, it might just bend toward justice
(King, 1968). A global society dominated by these values, and with the
possibility of improving more, has a better longterm potential. A
totalitarian-dominated world, on the other hand, would reduce the space
for resistance and progress---distorting the human trajectory.

[[We should be]{.mark} **particularly [concerned]{.mark}**
[about]{.mark} **"bottlenecks"**]{.underline} at which values are
particularly important---where there is a risk of
"**[[locking-in]{.underline}]{.mark}**" some particular set of (possibly
far from optimal) values. While they are currently far-off, [future
tech]{.underline}nologies [such as **[a]{.mark}**]{.underline}rtificial
**[[g]{.underline}]{.mark}**eneral
**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**ntelligence, [**[space settlement]{.mark}**,
**life extension**]{.underline} (of autocrats),
[[or]{.underline}]{.mark} much better
**[[surveillance]{.underline}]{.mark}** could enable lock-in (Caplan,
2008).17

Conditional on them avoiding new catastrophes, world orders dominated by
totalitarians could be quite long-lasting (Caplan, 2008). Democracies
can undermine authoritarian and totalitarian regimes through the
following ways: Control, including conquest; contagion through
proximity; and consent, promoting receptivity toward democratization
(Whitehead, 2001). Democracies can actively undermine these regimes
through war, sanctions, hosting rebellious exiles, or sponsoring
internal movements. Passively, through contagion, they offer a
demonstration that a better, more prosperous life is possible. For
example, in the final years of the USSR, ordinary Soviet citizens were
able to see that the West had a higher standard of living---more
innovation, more choice, and more consumer goods. The elites were able
to read books from the outside, and travel---Gorbachev's contacts and
friendships with European politicians may have made him more favorable
to social democracy (Brown, 1996). Democracies can undermine the will
and capacity of the coercive apparatus (Bellin, 2004). However, in a
world not dominated by democracies, all these pressures would be far
less.

A world in which, say, totalitarian regimes emerged as dominant after
World War II (for example if the USA was defeated) could be
self-reinforcing and long-lasting, like the self-reinforcing
relationship of Oceania, Eurasia, and Eastasia (Orwell, 1949). Orwell's
fictional world is characterized by constant low-grade warfare to
justify **[emergency powers]{.underline}** and secure elites, and with
shifting alliances of convenience as states bandwagon and balance,
thereby preventing any resolution. A totalitarian-dominated world order
could be rather robust, perhaps for decades or even centuries.

A long-lasting [[totalitarian]{.mark}-dominated [world would]{.mark}
extend]{.underline} the period of time humanity would spend with a
heightened [[risk]{.mark} of **collapse** or **[extinction]{.mark}**, as
well as]{.underline} increased potential for [**distortion** of the
**human trajectory** and]{.underline} the possibility that a
"**[lock-in]{.underline}**" event may occur. This example illustrates
the possibility of a "negative recovery," resulting in a trajectory with
less or no scientific and social progress and a less favorable
geopolitical situation, [which would threaten the **destruction** of
humanity's **longterm potential**]{.underline}.

### AT: Democracy

#### TURN\-\--The CCP is the [most]{.underline} democratic.

**CGTN 'ND** \[China Global Television Network; The CGTN is an
international media organization, "Why China\'s socialist democracy is
the most effective democracy,"
https://www.cgtn.com/how-china-works/feature/Why-China-s-socialist-democracy-is-the-most-effective-democracy.html\]

Many [people in the West think that there\'s no democracy]{.underline}
in China as the country is under the rule of one Party, the Communist
Party of China (CPC). The conclusion is based on the belief that
democracy can only be possible under a two-party or multi-party system.

But the fact is that [[China\'s socialist democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}
has been [developed [based on]{.mark} its **[national
context]{.mark}**]{.underline} after numerous trials, just like the
country\'s political system. As Chinese President Xi Jinping puts it,
the [[Chinese democracy]{.underline}]{.mark} is \"the [**broadest**,
[most **genuine**, and]{.mark} most [**effective**
democracy]{.mark}]{.underline} to safeguard the [**fundamental
interests** of the people]{.underline}.\"

According to Xi, the reasons can be summarized into three parts, namely
the unity of Party leadership, the people running the country, and
law-based governance.

Unity of Party leadership

The CPC leadership is believed to be essential for safeguarding China\'s
unification and keeping Chinese society harmonious and stable since the
Party is recognized as the faithful representative of the fundamental
interests of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups.

China [adopts [a system of multi-party cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}
and [political consultation [under]{.mark} the [**leadership**
of]{.mark} the [CPC.]{.mark}]{.underline} The system stresses the CPC
leadership while [[allowing **broad participation** of non-CPC
parties]{.underline}]{.mark} and personages without party affiliation in
the deliberation of state affairs and exercise of supervision.

Unlike the two-party system boasted by some Western countries,
[[China\'s political system **avoids**]{.mark} the common scenario where
[parties prioritize their **own interests**]{.mark}]{.underline} rather
than the people\'s and putting [emphasis on beating the
oppositions]{.underline} rather than working jointly for the well-being
of people.

On the other hand, following the principle of \"serving the people
wholeheartedly,\" the CPC has been striving to fulfil the solemn promise
by integrating the principle into the country\'s rule of law since
reform and opening-up in late 1978. It is through this way that the
interests of people can be fundamentally guaranteed.

Moreover, [China\'s socialist democracy]{.underline}, with the [feature
of [Party\'s leadership, ensures]{.mark} the [consistency of
policymaking]{.mark}]{.underline} as well as the [sustainability of
**development goals.**]{.underline}

Therefore, just as Xi said, the Party\'s leadership is a fundamental
guarantee for ensuring that the people run the country and government
policies are broadly consulted with democrats from all walks of life.

People running the country

The [people\'s [participation in politics is]{.mark} regarded as [the
\"**essence**\" of]{.mark}]{.underline} China\'s socialist
[[democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}.

As written in the Constitution, \"[[state power belongs to
people]{.underline}]{.mark}.\" This idea, constitutes the core value of
China\'s political system and is well embodied in the people\'s congress
system as well as in the political consultative system.

#### No impact to loss of leadership. 

**Swaine '21** \[Michael; April 21; PhD in Government from Harvard
University, director of the East Asia program at the Quincy Institute;
\"China Doesn't Pose an Existential Threat for America,\"
https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/04/21/china-existential-threat-america/\]

Finally, [the latter set of [supposed]{.mark}ly existential]{.underline}
normative or ideological [[threats consists of]{.mark} many elements,
including [Beijing's]{.mark} possible **[overturning]{.mark}** of
[the]{.mark} so-called global [**l**iberal]{.mark} **i**nternational
[**o**rder]{.mark}, Chinese **influence operations** aimed at U.S.
society, the **export** of China's **political values**]{.underline} and
state-directed economic approach, [and its sale of **surveillance
technologies**]{.underline} and other items [that
facilitate]{.underline} the rise or strengthening of [**authoritarian
states**. These threats]{.underline} all seem hair-raising at first
glance. But while significant, they [are greatly
exaggerated]{.underline} and do not rise to the level of constituting an
existential threat.

[[Beijing has **little interest** in **exporting**]{.mark} its
**[governance]{.mark} system**, and where it does, it is almost entirely
directed at **developing countries**, not industrial
democracies]{.underline} such as the United States. In addition, [there
is **no evidence** to indicate that the Chinese are **actually engaged**
in **compelling** or actively **persuading** countries to follow their
experience]{.underline}. Rather, [[they want]{.mark} developing [nations
to]{.mark} study from and [copy]{.mark}]{.underline} China's approach
because doing so would help [[to legitimize the]{.mark} Chinese
[system]{.mark}]{.underline} both internationally and more importantly
[[to]{.mark} Beijing's **[domestic audience]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

In addition, [the notion that Beijing is deliberately attempting to
control other countries]{.underline} and make them more authoritarian
[by entrapping them in **debt** [and]{.mark} selling them "Big Brother"
hardware such as **surveillance systems** is **unsupported** by the
**facts**. Chinese [banks show **little desire** to extend **loans that
will fail**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the failures that do occur are
mostly [due to **poor feasibility studies** and the **incompetence** and
excessive zeal of lenders and/or borrowers]{.underline}. Moreover, [in
both loan-giving and surveillance equipment sales, China has shown no
**specific preference** for nondemocratic over democratic
states]{.underline}.

[Even if Beijing were to **attempt** to export its development
approach]{.underline} to other states, [the [actual
**attractiveness**]{.mark} of that approach [would prove]{.mark} to be
**highly [limited]{.mark}**. The [**features undergirding**
China]{.mark}'s developmental success [are **not
replicable**]{.mark}]{.underline} for most (if any) countries. [These
include a **high savings rate**; a highly acquisitive and
**entrepreneurial cultural environment**; a **state-owned banking**
system and **nonconvertible currency**; many massive **state-owned
industries**]{.underline} that exist to provide employment, facilitate
party control over key sectors, and drive huge infrastructure
construction; [[and]{.mark} **strong controls** over virtually all
information flows]{.underline}. Moreover, [such a model]{.underline} (if
you can call it that) [is almost certainly **[not
sustainable]{.mark}**]{.underline} in its present form, [[given]{.mark}
China's **[aging population]{.mark}**, extensive
**[corruption]{.mark}**, very large levels of **[income
inequality]{.mark}**, inadequate social **safety net**, [and]{.mark} the
fact [that **free info**]{.mark}**rmation [flows]{.mark}** are required
to [drive]{.mark} **global [innovation]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Although [China's]{.underline} combination of economic reform policies
and authoritarian [political system has been around [since the]{.mark}
early 19[80s, **not a single nation** has adopted that system]{.mark}
either **willingly** or under **Chinese compulsion**. There
are]{.underline} certainly many [authoritarian states and fragile
democracies]{.underline} on China's periphery, [but none of them were
made that way by China]{.underline}.

[China's challenge to the so-called global **l**iberal **i**nternational
**o**rder is also **exaggerated**]{.underline}. In the first place, [[it
is **highly debatable**]{.mark} whether in fact [a single]{.mark}
**coherent** [global order **even exists**]{.mark}. What observers
usually refer to]{.underline} as the "liberal international order" (a
relatively recent term) actually [consists of an **amalgam** of
**disparate regimes** with different origins, including]{.underline}
international [**human rights** pacts, multilateral **economic
arrangements**, and an **international court**]{.underline}.

The United States certainly plays an important or leading role in many
of these regimes. But it did not create and does not drive all global
regimes---and in fact does not support some of them, such as the
International Court of Justice, and has not ratified some critical pacts
such as the United National Convention on the Law of the Sea. And many
very important global regimes (e.g., regarding the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction, trade and investment, climate change, and
pandemics) have no deep connection to liberal democratic values per se
and are supported by Beijing, albeit sometimes more in letter than in
spirit.

[[The challenge]{.mark} for the **U**nited **S**tates [is not]{.mark}
how to fend off the **[imagined]{.mark} existential [threats]{.mark}**
posed by China. Rather, it lies in developing a]{.underline} much
clearer and [factually based overall understanding of the **limited
challenges**]{.underline}, threats, and indeed opportunities [China
poses]{.underline} to the United States [and the policies needed to
address them. [Reject]{.mark}ing [the **specious notion**]{.mark} that
[China is threatening to **destroy** a]{.mark}n **entire [way of
life]{.mark}** will make this]{.underline} task [much
easier]{.underline}.

virtually [since the founding of the **[PRC]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [It

GoF, [**[synthetic virus]{.mark}** creation]{.underline},
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} other [high-risk [**pathogen**

to the former Soviet Union's biological weapons program, which was much
more limited in its range of pathogens, was highly fragmented and
clandestine, and did not benefit from knowledge transfer from the West.
Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, [the **CCP**]{.underline} has
[demonstrated]{.underline} that [it is willing to sacrifice]{.underline}
the lives of [millions of]{.underline} innocent [people to

**Walsh 20** -- Bryan Walsh covers emerging technology and geopolitics
for Axios, internally citing a 2018 pandemic simulation put on by the
Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, Richard Pilch of the

biologist at the MIT Media Lab and a member of the CDC\'s Biological
Agent Containment Working Group. \[The coronavirus pandemic reawakens

The immense human and economic toll of the [COVID-19]{.underline}
pandemic [**only underscores** the threat posed by
pathogens]{.underline} that could be **[deliberately engineered and
released]{.underline}**. Why it matters: New technology like [gene
editing and DNA synthesis]{.underline} has [made the creation of **more
virulent pathogens easier**]{.underline}. Yet security and regulation
efforts haven\'t kept pace with the science. What\'s happening: Despite
some claims by the White House, [**overwhelming scientific
[evidence]{.mark}** [indicates]{.mark}]{.underline} that [the novel
[coronavirus was not]{.mark}]{.underline} accidentally released from a
lab or [deliberately [engineered]{.mark}]{.underline}, but naturally
spilled over from an animal source. That doesn\'t mean the threat from
bioweapons isn\'t dire. Along with AI, [[**engineered pandemics**
are]{.mark} **widely considered [the biggest existential risk]{.mark}**
[facing humanity]{.mark}]{.underline}. That\'s in part because a
pathogen could be engineered in a lab for maximum contagiousness and
virulence, well beyond what would arise through natural selection. Case
in point: [a 2018 pandemic [simulation]{.mark}]{.underline} put on
[by]{.underline} the [Johns Hopkins]{.underline} Center for Health
Security [[featured]{.mark} a]{.underline} fictional engineered
[[virus]{.underline}]{.mark} called Clade X [[that combined]{.mark}
**the contagiousness of the [common cold]{.mark}**
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} the virulence of the real-life Nipah virus,
which has [a [mortality]{.mark} rate [of]{.mark}
**40-[75%]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The resulting simulated global
outbreak killed 150 million people. COVID-19 isn\'t anywhere near that
fatal, but the pandemic has shown the vulnerability of the U.S. and the
world to biological threats both natural and manmade. [\"**Potential
adversaries** are]{.underline} of course [seeing the]{.underline} same
[things we're seeing,\" says]{.underline} Richard [Pilch]{.underline} of
the Middlebury Institute of International Studies. [\"Anyone looking
**for a radical leveling approach** --- whether **[a state]{.mark}
actor** [like]{.mark} North [Korea or]{.mark} a **motivated
[terrorist]{.mark} organization** --- [may be influenced by
COVID]{.mark}-19 [to consider]{.mark} pursuing a [biological
weapons]{.mark} capability.\"]{.underline} Background: Bioweapons were
officially banned by the Biological Weapons Convention in 1975, though
North Korea is suspected of maintaining an offensive bioweapons program.
A particular concern about biowarfare and bioterror, though, is that
many of the [tools]{.underline} and methods that could be used to create
a weaponized virus [are]{.underline} largely [**indistinguishable**
from]{.underline} those used in the course of [legitimate scientific
research. This makes biotechnology \"**dual-use**\"]{.underline} --- and
that [much more difficult to]{.underline} safely [regulate]{.underline}
without cutting off research that could be vitally important. While
earlier bioweapons fears focused on the possibility that a state or
terror group could try to weaponize a known dangerous agent like
smallpox --- which would require somehow obtaining restricted pathogens
--- new technology means that someone could obtain the genetic sequence
of a germ online and synthesize it in the lab. [[\"If you\'ve been
trained]{.underline}]{.mark} in a relevant technical discipline, that
means [[you can make]{.underline}]{.mark} almost
**[[any]{.underline}]{.mark}** potentially harmful
[[agent]{.underline}]{.mark} that [you\'re aware of,\" says]{.underline}
Kevin [Esvelt]{.underline}, a biologist at the MIT Media Lab and a
member of the CDC\'s Biological Agent Containment Working Group. That
would include the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, which was
recently synthesized from its genetic sequence in a study published in
Nature. How it works: Currently, synthetic DNA is ordered through
commercial suppliers. But [while most suppliers screen]{.underline} DNA
[orders]{.underline} for the sequences of dangerous pathogens, [they\'re
not required to]{.underline} --- and not all do, which means safety
efforts are \"incomplete, inaccurate, and insecure,\" says Esvelt.
[Screening efforts]{.underline} that look for the genetic sequences of
known pathogens also [wouldn\'t]{.underline} necessarily be able to
[detect when]{.underline} synthetic [DNA was being used to make
something **entirely novel and dangerous**]{.underline}. In the near
future, [[desktop]{.mark} DNA [synthesizers]{.mark} may]{.underline} be
able to [generate]{.underline} synthetic [DNA in the lab,
[cut]{.mark}ting [out]{.mark} the need for commercial
[suppliers]{.mark}]{.underline} --- and potential security screenings.
The [democratization of biotechnology]{.underline} could unleash a wave
of creativity and innovation, just as the democratization of personal
computing did. But it also [increases the number of people
who]{.underline} could potentially [make a dangerous engineered
virus]{.underline}, whether deliberately or by accident.

Watch as one of the more aggressive---brighter red --- strains rapidly
expands. After a time it goes extinct leaving a black region. Why does
it go extinct? The answer is that it spreads so rapidly that it kills
the hosts around it. Without new hosts to infect it then dies out
itself. That the rapidly spreading pathogens die out has important
implications for evolutionary research which we have talked about
elsewhere \[1--7\].¶ In the research I want to discuss here, [what we
were interested in is the effect of adding long range
transportation]{.underline} \[8\]. [This includes natural means of
dispersal as well as **unintentional dispersal by humans**]{.underline},
[like adding airplane routes]{.underline}, which is being done by real
world airlines (Figure 2).¶ [When we introduce long range transportation
into the model, the success of more [aggressive strains]{.mark} changes.
They can [use]{.mark} the **long range [transportation]{.mark}** [to
find new hosts and **escape local extinction**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Figure 3 shows that [[the more]{.mark} transportation [routes]{.mark}
introduced into the model, [the **more**]{.mark} **higher aggressive
[pathogens]{.mark} are able to [survive and
spread]{.mark}**]{.underline}.¶ [As we add more long range
transportation, [there is a]{.mark} critical [point at which]{.mark}
pathogens become so aggressive that **[the entire]{.mark} host
[population dies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The pathogens die at the same
time, but that is not exactly a consolation to the hosts. We call
this]{.underline} the phase [transition to **extinction**]{.underline}
(Figure 4). [[With increasing]{.mark} levels of [global transportation,
**human civilization** may]{.mark} be [approach]{.mark}ing **such [a
critical threshold]{.mark}**.]{.underline}¶ In the paper we wrote in
2006 about the dangers of global transportation for pathogen evolution
and pandemics \[8\], we mentioned the risk from Ebola. Ebola is a
horrendous disease that was present only in isolated villages in Africa.
It was far away from the rest of the world only because of that
isolation. Since Africa was developing, it was only a matter of time
before it reached population centers and airports. While the model is
about evolution, it is really about which pathogens will be found in a
system that is highly connected, and Ebola can spread in a highly
connected world.¶ The traditional approach to public health uses
historical evidence analyzed statistically to assess the potential
impacts of a disease. As a result, many were surprised by the spread of
Ebola through West Africa in 2014. [As the connectivity of the world
increases, past experience is not a good guide to future
events.]{.underline}¶ [[A key point about]{.mark} the phase transition
to [extinction is its **suddenness**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Even a
system]{.mark} that seems stable, [can be destabilized]{.mark} by a few
more long-range connections, and connectivity is continuing to
increase.]{.underline}¶ So how close are we to the tipping point? We
don't know but it would be good to find out before it happens.¶ While
Ebola ravaged three countries in West Africa, it only resulted in a
handful of cases outside that region. One possible reason is that many
of the airlines that fly to west Africa stopped or reduced flights
during the epidemic \[9\]. In the absence of a clear connection, public
health authorities who downplayed the dangers of the epidemic spreading
to the West might seem to be vindicated.¶ As with the choice of airlines
to stop flying to west Africa, our analysis didn't take into
consideration how people respond to epidemics. It does tell us what the
outcome will be unless we respond fast enough and well enough to stop
the spread of future diseases, which may not be the same as the ones we
saw in the past. [As the world becomes more connected, the dangers
increase.]{.underline}¶ Are people in western countries safe because of
higher quality health systems? [[Countries like **the U.S.**
have]{.mark} highly [skewed networks of social interactions with]{.mark}
some very highly connected individuals that can be
**["superspreaders."]{.mark}**]{.underline} The chances of such an
individual becoming infected may be low but [events like [a mass
outbreak pose a]{.mark} much **[greater risk]{.mark}**]{.underline} if
they do happen. [[If a sick food service worker]{.mark} in an airport
[infects 100 passengers, or a contagion]{.mark} event [happens in mass
transportation, **an outbreak could**]{.mark} **very well [prove
unstoppable]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Could vs. Would

In today's world, [virtually [**every country** has access
to]{.mark}]{.underline} the building blocks necessary to make [a
**[bio]{.mark}l**ogical **[weapon]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\[5\] The
question is whether a country would attempt to do so. [**Moral** and
**ethical arguments**]{.underline} aside, [biological weapons are
prohibited by the Biological Weapons Convention
(**[BWC]{.mark}**]{.underline}), a multilateral disarmament treaty of
183 states parties that [[bans bio]{.mark}logical [weapons]{.mark}
development and related activities.]{.underline} While countries such as
Iraq and the Soviet Union have breached the BWC in the past, an argument
can be made that each country's breach was strategic: Iraq to counter
superior military manpower and perceived WMD threats in the region
(e.g., on the part of Iran),\[6\] and the Soviet Union to gain an
asymmetric advantage over the US in the great power competition that
characterized the Cold War. Would pursuing an offensive biological
weapons capability similarly fit the prevailing strategy of the People's
Republic of China (PRC)?

China's grand strategy is founded upon technological superiority and
economic expansion in the Global South. That strategy has enjoyed
remarkable success: China's corresponding Belt and Road Initiative has
engaged more than 60 countries and invested over \$200B to corresponding
infrastructure development of to date.\[7\] However, one enduring risk
to the strategy's ultimate success is China's perception on the global
stage. A negative perception would undermine [China's ongoing **soft
power** investment]{.underline}, which might [explain]{.underline} the
PRC's concerted [efforts]{.underline} during the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic not only [to project strength]{.underline} but to [emerge as a
global leader in the area of global health security]{.underline}.

The [discovery of a]{.underline} covert [[offensive BW program in China
would]{.mark} threaten]{.underline} not only [China's **[external
relationships]{.mark}**]{.underline} with both partner nations and key
international organizations like the World Health Organization
([WHO]{.underline}), World Trade Organization ([WTO]{.underline}), and
[World Bank, [but also]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}China's
[**[internal stability]{.mark}**. [Bio]{.mark}logical [weapons
are]{.mark} widely **[abhorred]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} perhaps
nowhere more so than [[in China]{.underline}]{.mark}, where the Chinese
people suffered BW attacks at the hands of the Japanese during the
Second Sino-Japanese War that coincided with World War
II.\[8\] [[COVID-19]{.underline}]{.mark} can only be expected to
[[**exacerbate** those sentiments]{.underline}]{.mark}, placing long
[overdue emphasis on China's central role in preventing future
outbreaks]{.underline} with pandemic potential.\[9\] And [[China
has]{.mark} other, [more **predictable** military
options]{.mark}]{.underline} for area denial and deterrence, which form
the basis of its national military strategy.\[10\]

[Biological weapons development requires a conscious
decision]{.underline} to invest money, human and material resources, and
time in contravention to interventional law. [[There is no
indication]{.underline}]{.mark} in the open source domain -- including
statements [from Chinese leadership, state media reports, government
budgetary allocations]{.underline}, and scientific publications or lack
thereof -- [[that China has made any]{.mark} such
[decision]{.mark}]{.underline}, despite its access to the necessary
building blocks. Accordingly, the US State Department's 2019 report on
Adherence to and Compliance with Arms Control, Nonproliferation, and
Disarmament Agreements and Commitments assessed that "\[i\]nformation
indicates that the People's Republic of China (China) engaged during the
reporting period in biological activities with potential dual-use
applications, which raises concerns regarding its compliance with the
BWC."\[11\] However, the only way to know for sure is to engage China
collaboratively.

#### The only scenario for use is invasion\-\--and the public would hate it.

**Ehinger '23** \[February 27; Garrett; Master in public health at the
University of Utah, Oxford Biosecurity Researcher, "Taiwan's Defenses
Could Push China To Use Bioweapons,"
https://inkstickmedia.com/taiwans-defenses-could-push-china-to-use-bioweapons/\]

According to experts like Ian Easton at the 2049 Research
Institute or Piers Wood from the US Naval War College, a [[Chinese
**invasion** of Taiwan]{.mark} would likely [be a phased
assault]{.mark}]{.underline} of [neighboring islands]{.underline} like
the Penghus or Kinmen [[before a **final push** into
Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark} itself to avoid provoking an all-out US
response. As a result, Taiwanese defense investments have
become increasingly extensive as they've taken this into account,
especially in the aforementioned islands of the strait.

Yet, [Taiwan's [preparations]{.mark} could contribute to]{.underline}
its own [downfall]{.underline} by [[forcing]{.mark} President
[Xi]{.mark} Jinping [to]{.mark}]{.underline} make a critical choice:
face humiliation in defeat or [[employ **uniquely cruel**
tactics]{.mark} to achieve victory]{.underline}. As such, bioweapons
[must be considered a key factor in Taiwan's security
dilemma]{.underline}, especially in light of China's 2020 Biodefense
Law that gave relevant government branches the directive to "strengthen
research and development...in biodefense programs." The Department of
Defense, the Observer Research Foundation, and the Institute for Defence
Studies and Analysis have all published documents indicating that China
is still engaged in developing bioweapons such as ricin, anthrax, and
botulinum.

Since a [Chinese [deployment of **bioweapons**]{.mark} against Taiwan
[could trigger]{.mark} another [**global pandemic**
or]{.mark}]{.underline} at the very least, [**[shatter]{.mark}** the
[norms]{.mark} against the use]{.underline} of such cruel weapons, the
[[United States should take measures to ensure]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[China never reaches such a]{.mark} **critical decision
[juncture]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The Biden administration should
support verification measures for the Biological Weapons Convention and
invest in asymmetric defense technologies to defeat bioweapons, which
would deter their development in the first place.

A COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF SORTS

[[The benefits of bioweapons]{.mark} in an amphibious
warfare]{.underline} scenario [[are]{.mark} fairly
self-**[evident]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For starters, besieged [islands
are [naturally quarantined]{.mark} by oceans]{.underline} and wartime
international travel restrictions, thus mitigating (although not
eliminating) the concern of endangering your own forces or accidentally
triggering a global pandemic if used in the Taiwan Strait.

These weapons are also relatively cheap to make. They are impossible to
trace with any meaningful certainty, granting deniability to the
aggressors, as was done for decades by Biological Weapons Convention
signatories like the Soviet Union and Iraq, to name a couple. For
example, China could launch a bioweapon and then blame it on US
military dual-use research programs, saying that Washington wanted to
escalate the conflict or rally international support for Taiwan by
defaming Beijing.

Bioweapons can also be mixed into conventional missile strikes,
disguising their use. But this comes with its own risks. For
example, second and third lines of defense, such as trained civilian
resistance groups or medical bays and supply routes, could be indirectly
attacked as unknowingly infected troops travel back from the frontlines
spreading the disease among the islands, compounding the damage of just
one successful biological strike.

[[China]{.mark} also [faces]{.mark} some **[domestic risks]{.mark}** to
using bio]{.underline}logical [weapons]{.underline}. Over the past
several years, the [[Chinese people]{.mark} have been [**oppressed** by
stringent COVID regulations]{.mark}]{.underline}, leading to
widespread riots and dissent. If their government was caught using
bioweapons, even if the risk of infecting their own forces is lowered,
this [[**hypocrisy** could inflame tensions]{.mark} to unprecedented
proportions]{.underline} and have devastating domestic consequences.

-- Grounds for doubt),\" Reflective altruism,

In the meantime, I want to give some initial reasons for skepticism
about existential biorisk. That is not to say that the bulk of the case
against existential biorisk rests on these reasons for skepticism -- it
rests, instead, on the inability of effective altruists to provide
plausible arguments in support of their risk estimates. But it does seem
appropriate to begin by saying why [[**many are skeptical** of
existential biorisk]{.underline}]{.mark} claims.

3\. The difficulty of the problem

The main reason why scientists and policymakers are skeptical of
existential biorisk is that [it is terribly hard to engineer a pandemic
that kills **everyone**]{.underline}.

First, [[you would need to reach **everyone**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The
virus would have to be transmitted to the most **rural** and **isolated
corners**]{.underline} of the earth; to
**[[antarctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** research
**[[stations]{.underline}]{.mark}**; to [**[ships]{.mark}** at
sea]{.underline}, [including **[nuclear
sub]{.mark}**]{.underline}marine**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** on
uncharted, long-term and isolated paths; to [**doomsday
[preppers]{.mark}** in]{.underline} their **[bunkers]{.underline}**; to
hermits and **[[uncontacted tribes]{.underline}]{.mark}**; to
[**[astronauts]{.mark}** in space]{.underline}; to each new child born
every second; [to **island** nations]{.underline}; and so on. And you
would need a transmission mechanism that could spread the virus this far
without being detected: otherwise, [those with the means would be
**whisked away** to safety]{.underline} and might well survive.

Second, [[you would need a virus that was]{.mark} **virtually
[undetectable]{.mark}** until **all**]{.underline}, or [nearly all
humans had **been infected**]{.underline}. That conflicts in a stark way
with the goal of producing a virus that is 100% lethal, since lethal
viruses tend to leave a trace as they spread through a population.

Third, [you would need a virus that is **unprecedentedly
infectious**]{.underline}. [[The virus would need to be]{.mark} capable
of being **[transmitted]{.mark}**, **without fail**]{.underline}, [[to
**every human**]{.underline}]{.mark} being [[on the
**planet**]{.underline}]{.mark}, in sufficient quantities to actually
make them sick. [It would need to [avoid
**respirators**]{.mark}]{.underline} and other forms of protective
equipment. [[And]{.mark} it would have to [maintain]{.mark} its
[transmissibility through]{.mark}out many generations]{.underline} of
**[[mutation]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

Fourth, [you would need a virus that is **unprecedentedly
lethal**]{.underline}, [[killing not]{.underline}]{.mark} 90%,
**[[99%]{.underline}]{.mark}**, or 99.999% [[but]{.underline}]{.mark}
effectively **[[all]{.underline}]{.mark}** of those infected by it, [[no
matter their]{.mark} age, health, or **[genetic
makeup]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This lethality would need to be preserved
even against the best medical treatments, including quite possibly
vaccines or synthesized antibodies. And it would have to be maintained
throughout many generations of mutation despite selective pressures
towards less lethal variants.

Fifth, [[you would need to]{.underline}]{.mark} find a way to
[[evade]{.mark} **basic public health measures** such as masking and
**social [distancing]{.mark}**. This isn't as easy as it sounds. [How do
you transmit a virus to someone who **doesn't leave their
house**?]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Collapse Bad\-\--Lashout

#### CCP collapse causes [invasion of Taiwan]{.underline}.

Turning towards **[nationalism]{.underline}** in the longer term

[Economic **growth**]{.underline} has been a [**key pillar** of the
[CCP's **legitimacy**]{.mark}]{.underline} since Deng Xiaoping's time.
Robust growth is central to party legitimacy for the
CCP---[**[slowing]{.mark}** growth **[erodes]{.mark}** their hold on
**[power]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As early as 2016, analysts warned about
the PRC's [[employment of **nationalist**]{.mark}**ic foreign
[policies]{.mark}** []{.mark}to **protect** the CCP's **legitimacy**
against the effects of its **slowing economy**]{.underline}. CCP
rhetoric around the country's 'century of humiliation' in which its
**[[territorial disputes]{.underline}]{.mark}** with its neighbors and
the issue of **[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}** are seen as "[wounds from
this **humiliating past**]{.underline}" are [prime examples]{.underline}
of this behavior. This is complemented by President Xi's slogan of the
'**[great rejuvenation]{.underline}** of the Chinese nation', where the
party is [positioned as a force [to **restore**]{.mark} the PRC's
**rightful place** in the world]{.underline}. Such a turn towards
nationalism was in [full display in the late 2010s when the PRC reacted
to its perceptions of the increased international threat posed to the
country by [pursuing]{.mark} **wolf-warrior diplomacy**]{.underline},
embracing a more [[**confrontational** tone]{.underline}]{.mark} on the
**[international stage]{.underline}**.

Although the [PRC has [**toned down** on]{.mark} its [wolf-warrior
diplomacy]{.mark}]{.underline}, its statements on the reunification with
Taiwan, which it sees as a renegade province, [[**continue** to
embrace]{.mark} **antagonistic** and **[nationalistic
rhetoric]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Since 2022, the PRC has [increased the
frequency of **military exercises** around the island]{.underline}. In
his 2024 New Year's address, President Xi declared that reunification
was a "historical inevitability." Some have warned that the PRC's
elevated pressure on Taiwan indicates a [[**higher likelihood**
of]{.mark} a military **[confrontation]{.mark}** to reunify the
island]{.underline}.

To be sure, there has been [[**pushback** against]{.mark} the notion
that the **CCP** will resort to conflict as a **[diversion]{.mark}**ary
[tactic]{.mark}]{.underline} from the country's economic troubles.
President Biden posited that the PRC's economic troubles left President
Xi with "his hands full." Other experts argue that it is irrational for
the CCP to engage its military in a war that has an uncertain prospect
of success, as this could cost the party its vital support base. While
there are merits to these arguments, [**Indo-Pacific [experts]{.mark}**
[highlight]{.mark} that **public [opinion]{.mark}** [exerts]{.mark} a
**[great influence]{.mark}** over the CCP]{.underline}. Based on this,
they [expect the drumming up of **[nationalist sentiments]{.mark}** to
[drive]{.mark} the party into **adopt**ing [more **aggressive
responses**]{.mark} to **regional crises**, including the use of
military force]{.underline}. This is concerning. The CCP may be
compelled to act by forces that the party itself once deliberately
cultivated but now have escaped the CCP's control. This illustrates the
real risk that the PRC, along with the other powers involved, might
**[[stumble into a war]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

China? More Liley Than You Think".

"[Refolution]{.underline}" [is a **combination** of **reform** and
**[revolution]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Typically, [this]{.underline}
process [[starts with **limited reform**]{.underline}]{.mark} initiated
by the old regime, [but [ends with]{.mark} its **[involuntary
exit]{.mark}**]{.underline} from power. This phenomenon was first
observed by Alexis de Tocqueville, who famously observed that "the most
perilous moment for a bad government is one when it seeks to mend its
ways."22 [This]{.underline} Tocquevillean paradox [was]{.underline}
vividly [illustrated when]{.underline} Soviet leader Mikhail
[**[Gorbachev]{.mark}**'s]{.underline} mid-1980s program of [limited
**political reform**]{.underline}, known as perestroika,
[[sparked]{.mark} **nationalist** independence movements
and]{.underline} ultimately [[a **democratic
revolution**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Soviet empire.

Based on the instances of regime transition since the mid-1970s,
"refolution" (or "transplacement," to use Huntington's term) can be
divided into two categories. The first consists of those transitions
that begin with reform and end with the removal of the ruling elites
through "founding elections"---peaceful and competitive votes that are
negotiated between the old-regime elite and the opposition. The second
variant also starts with limited regime-initiated reform, but it ends
with the collapse of the old regime rather than its negotiated exit via
elections. The final phase of this type of "refolution" resembles a
classic revolution, but with one critical difference: The
[[demise]{.mark} of the old regime [comes with]{.mark}]{.underline}
relatively **[[little bloodshed]{.underline}]{.mark}**; [rather than
suffering defeat at the hands of an armed opposition]{.underline}, [[the
regime]{.underline}]{.mark} essentially
**[[disintegrates]{.underline}]{.mark}**---its [authority
**evaporates**]{.underline}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} its [key
[supporters **defect**]{.mark}]{.underline}. By Huntington's count,
between 1974 and 1990 eleven transitions qualified as
"transplacement."23 To this list we may now add Burma. Although the
country is not yet a full democracy, the democrats are now in charge of
the government after the military regime's humiliating and decisive loss
in Burma's first competitive elections, held in 2015.

The most critical variable in a "refolution" scenario is the shifting
balance of power between the old regime and the opposition.24 This
insight is crucial when considering the possible transition scenarios in
regimes with conditions that are inhospitable to revolution, such as
totalitarian or posttotalitarian regimes. For example, mass uprisings
have no chance of success in regimes with strong repressive capacity.
If, however, a regime becomes significantly weaker during the initial
phase of the transition process, there may be some possibility that it
could be overthrown at a later stage. [The [weakening]{.mark} of an
**old regime**]{.underline} typically [[begins with]{.mark} the [decay
of]{.mark} its [**key institutions** and]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[**deterioration** of its **[performance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This
process can lead to two outcomes: A near-certain outcome is increasing
opposition to the old regime and the erosion of its popular support.

A less certain outcome is the rise of reformers inside the regime. The
[deterioration]{.underline} of the old regime [could
undermine]{.underline} the [**hard-liners** and help
**reformers**]{.underline} to [emerge and take **control** of the **top
positions**]{.underline}. These [reformers]{.underline} could then
[undertake **limited changes** in the hope of reversing]{.underline} the
regime's [deterioration]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} would loosen up
the old system and [create]{.underline} initial [opportunities
for]{.underline} mass **[political mobilization]{.underline}**. Of
course, if the hard-liners manage to hold on to power in spite of the
worsening conditions, reform would not occur and decay would continue.
If, however, moderate reformers succeed in gaining power and launching
limited reforms, three subsequent developments are certain to occur.
First, [[the]{.mark} old [regime will suffer a]{.mark} **further
[split]{.mark}**]{.underline} into three groups: moderate reformers in
power, hard-liners opposed to even limited changes, and radical
reformers demanding fundamental changes. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark}
three-way rift [will]{.underline} often [produce a stalemate that
[creates]{.mark}]{.underline} highly [[**favorable** conditions
for]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**removal** of the **old
regime**]{.underline}]{.mark} (primarily because it paralyzes the old
regime's repressive apparatus). Second, even in a stalemated reform
process [societal forces will gain]{.underline} unprecedented [freedom
and lose]{.underline} their [**fear** of **repression**]{.underline}.
This [window of opportunity allows them to **mobilize** and
acquire]{.underline} new [capacities]{.underline}, thus
[shifting]{.underline} the [**balance of power** in their
favor]{.underline}. Third, the [erosion of the old regime's
**legitimacy** will continue]{.underline} at an accelerating pace.
Posttotalitarian regimes that attempt to reform must bear the heavy
burden of history---specifically, the responsibility for crimes
committed by their totalitarian predecessors against their own people.

Limited reform invariably brings greater press freedom, which in turn
exposes the old regime's crimes, laying bear the "Big Lie" that had
shored up the regime's legitimacy. A thoroughly delegitimized old regime
is highly vulnerable to revolutionary overthrow. In essence, this
describes the "refolution" dynamics that led to the collapse of the
USSR. [In the **Chinese**]{.underline} case, [the [likelihood
of]{.mark}]{.underline} "**[[refolution]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[will
increase in the next **ten years**]{.underline}]{.mark}. By then,
[[China will have]{.underline}]{.mark} experienced roughly [[an
**additional decade** of]{.underline}]{.mark} regime
**[[decay]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [The [**effects** of]{.mark} long-term
**economic [stagnation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [social
**frustration**s]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} deteriorating
**[performance]{.mark}** will have become]{.underline} plainly
[visible]{.underline}.

If Xi steps down at the end of his second term, his successor will be
under immense pressure to reverse the CCP's declining fortunes. Such
speculation, of course, assumes the likely failure of Xi's efforts to
revive the CCP through a mix of internal discipline, heightened
repression, appeals to nationalism, and partial economic reforms.
Moreover, by the dawn of the next decade, the CCP's two post--Mao-era
survival strategies---neoauthoritarian crony capitalism and strongman
rule---will have proved to be unviable. Xi's successor will therefore
have to find another way to regain legitimacy. It will be a supreme
irony of history if the CCP is ultimately brought down by refolution.

Since Tiananmen, no nightmare has obsessed the CCP leadership more than
the collapse of the Soviet Union, and no political leader has been more
reviled by the party than Gorbachev. It is possible that the CCP's
determination not to succumb to the same fate as the Soviet Union will
prevent the emergence of a Gorbachev-like figure, however dire the
circumstances. But again, authoritarian regimes adopt reform mostly out
of despair. Truly [desperate dictatorships]{.underline} may [have
**few** other options]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} dynamic
[compelled Mao's]{.underline} immediate [successors to embrace
**capitalism** in the]{.underline} late [19**70s**]{.underline}, and [we
**should not** rule out the possibility that]{.underline} the [**same
logic** will force future]{.underline} Chinese [leaders to take
another]{.underline} historic **[gamble]{.underline}**.

### Collapse Inevitable\-\--1NC

#### Regime collapse is [inevitable]{.underline} but collapse [now]{.underline} prevents Xi [lashout]{.underline}.

The ultimate end of a situation in which communists are in charge of a
capitalist economy is economic depression, with China's economic woes
the prime example. [The]{.underline} Chinese Communist Party
(**[[CCP]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [regime has
[suspended]{.mark}]{.underline} monthly [[reports]{.mark}
on]{.underline} youth [unemployment]{.underline}, [which]{.underline}
had previously been [at a **record high**]{.underline}, going [beyond
**20** percent and rising]{.underline}.

It is often joked about in academic circles that [when a]{.underline}
national [laboratory]{.underline} has [made a great
discovery]{.underline}, [the institution will]{.underline} quickly [call
a news conference]{.underline} to announce it to the world, [but when
the research has been a]{.underline} total **[failure]{.underline}**,
[the institution will keep it under **wraps**]{.underline}.

The [manifestation of [China's]{.mark}]{.underline} economic
[[**depression** would]{.underline}]{.mark} most likely [[cause]{.mark}
the [demise of the **CCP**]{.mark}]{.underline}, not dissimilar to the
collapse of the Soviet Union. Less scientific, more metaphysical
predictions came from the prophecies of ancient Chinese mystical books,
Iron Plate Diagrams (鐵板圖) and Tui Bei Tu (推背圖).

[Both [books]{.mark}]{.underline} appear to
[[predict]{.underline}]{.mark} that Chinese President
**[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark}** Jinping (習近平) [[will be the last
emperor of the **CCP**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [brought down by his
**subordinates**]{.underline}. Many of his subordinates have been
"forced to disappear," including his foreign minister, defense minister
and some high-ranking military officers. Some political observers think
Xi actually believes the prophecies of the two books.

[[A **military**]{.mark} **coup**]{.underline}, a [[**political coup**
and]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[**civil** revolt are]{.mark} the
three]{.underline} potential [[**major** crises]{.mark} Xi
faces]{.underline}.

It has been quipped that [[Chinese **military leaders** understand it is
easier to attack]{.mark} the **[Zhongnanhai]{.mark}**]{.underline} ---
the center of power in Beijing --- [[than to cross]{.mark} the
**[Taiwan]{.mark} Strait**]{.underline}, just as a Russian counterpart
found it easier to attack Moscow than invade Kyiv.

[In immature democracies]{.underline}, [[military **coups often
occur**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and they even happen in more mature
democracies. There are even some instances of political coups by
high-ranking officials.

However, these are the power games of ruling elites and would not grant
democracy to the people. Worse, coup leaders are, more often than not,
more interested in extending their power beyond the "status quo" at the
expense of constitutions and democracy.

The CCP has already gone through several coups, some of them successful,
such as Chairman Mao Zedong's (毛澤東) Cultural Revolution, the
overthrow of the gang of four by Deng Xiaoping (鄧小平), and the failed
coup of former Chinese minister of defense Lin Biao (林彪).

[[It would **not** be **surprising** to see **another**]{.mark} **coup**
[under **Xi**]{.mark}'s watch]{.underline}.

In a democratic system, power is already in the hands of the people, so
accommodating revolutionary ideas and implementing changes requires a
grassroots movement. Short of a popular uprising, China will not become
a democratic country anytime soon.

The fact that [[Xi is afraid of]{.underline}]{.mark} military personnel
having unnecessary social contact speaks volumes about how worried he is
about [[a **popular uprising** combining]{.mark} the **power of [the
military]{.mark}**]{.underline}, political [[**elites** and the
**people**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[Fate of **Xi Loyalists**]{.underline}

[While on the surface]{.underline} the [military reshuffles point
to]{.underline} even more **[centralized control]{.underline}**, some
[analysts]{.underline} have [noted]{.underline} that [[Xi **loyalists**
are among those who have been **removed**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Admiral Miao]{.mark} Hua [had been]{.mark}]{.underline} consistently
[[**promoted** by **Xi**]{.underline}]{.mark} and had served alongside
him in Fujian province [[for **years**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[Miao had been placed under investigation]{.underline} on suspicion of
\"serious disciplinary violations\" [last **November**]{.underline},
according to China\'s Ministry of Defense spokesperson Wu Qian. [Two
more [admirals]{.mark}]{.underline} close to Miao who had also been
[[promoted by **Xi**]{.underline}]{.mark}---Li Hanjun and Li
Pengcheng---[[were]{.mark} also **[purged]{.mark}**]{.underline}, Andrew
S. Erickson and Christopher H. Sharman of the China Maritime Studies
Institute of the U.S. Naval War College wrote on July 1.

Lim believed that the [changes could be about giving]{.underline}
greater [**autonomy** to the **military**]{.underline}, known as the
People\'s Liberation Army, to make it more effective.

\"The PLA welcomes his moves, his military reforms, because they just
want to focus on seeing their combat readiness rather than being
mobilized to do something else. One sort of message he wants to send to
the military is like, extreme autonomy to the military. So autonomy is
the key word here,\" Lim said.

[Others]{.underline}, however, [question whether [**Xi** could be facing
disaffection fro]{.mark}m]{.underline} other [[**elite** members]{.mark}
of the **Party** [and]{.mark}]{.underline} some [members of [the
**military**]{.mark}]{.underline}, Chinese and foreign observers say. Xi
is general secretary of the CCP, chairman of its Central Military
Commission that controls the military, the People\'s Liberation Army
(PLA), and state president.

Xi\'s consolidation of power became evident with his appointment to a
third term as CCP leader in 2022---breaking a custom of serving only two
terms. The term is scheduled to end in 2027 but no successor has been
identified.

Reliable signs of any shift in power would only emerge from a regular
meeting of the CCP Central Committee known as the Fourth Plenum that is
expected in August, said an analyst in China who requested anonymity for
fear of retribution. No date has been set for the meeting.

[Ideas that]{.underline} a serious [[**pushback** is
underway]{.underline}]{.mark}---a kind of \"slow-motion coup\" [[set in
motion by **party elites**]{.mark} including]{.underline} former
[**CCP** leaders]{.underline}---are being circulated by Chinese
political exiles, including one with the moniker \"Lao Deng,\" who has
posted dozens of videos that receive hundreds of thousands of views on
his channel, \"Lao Deng Starts Talking.\"

In the videos, the Canada-based farmer and dissident discusses
information about meetings that he says insiders in China are sending
him---party and security service members, including high-ranking
political secretaries. But in a telephone interview, he declined to
provide Newsweek with evidence to support his assertions.

In the complex world of CCP politics, [clues to power]{.underline} can
[lie in]{.underline} carefully chosen **[words]{.underline}**. The
analyst in China said that [the use of the word]{.underline}
\"**[coordination]{.underline}**\" to describe the work of the new
organization \"[can only mean]{.underline} that [[things can no longer
be decided]{.mark} just [by **one person**]{.mark}]{.underline},\" [and
thus was [a **crimp** on **Xi**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

\"If there are different opinions among the policymakers, this agency
will come forward to coordinate and listen to collective opinions. This
will be the new decision-making principle,\" the analyst said.

(FOB) system" (US Department of Defense 2023, 67). As of October 2023,
[China]{.underline} has [tested each of these systems at least

system equipped with a hypersonic glide vehicle, an [[event]{.mark}
described as an [**unprecedented achievement** for]{.mark} a
[nuclear-armed country]{.mark}]{.underline} (Sevastopulo 2021).
According to the Pentagon, the system [came close to striking its

longest flight time (\~100+ minutes) [of any \[Chinese\] land-attack

Per the Pentagon's most recent China Military Power Report, [[China
has]{.mark} equipped its [Jin-class SSBNs]{.mark} to carry either the
7,200-kilometer range]{.underline} JL-2 (CSS-N-14) SLBM or the
longer-range JL-3 (CSS-N-20) SLBMs, and China has likely [begun
replacing the JL-2s with JL-3s on a rotational basis as each submarine
returns to port for routine maintenance and overhaul]{.underline} (US
Department of Defense 2023, 55). The [[range]{.underline}]{.mark} of the
JL-2 was [sufficient to target Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, Russia, and
India]{.underline} from waters near China, [but [**not** the
**continental United States**]{.mark}]{.underline}---unless the
submarine sailed deep into the Pacific Ocean to launch its missiles.
With the JL-3's longer range of roughly 10,000 kilometers, a submarine
will be able to target the northwestern parts of the continental United
States from Chinese waters, but it would still not be able to target
Washington, DC without sailing past northeast Japan (National Air and
Space Intelligence Center 2020, 33). Unlike the JL-2, the JL-3 allegedly
can deliver "multiple" warheads per missile (National Air and Space
Intelligence Center 2020, 33). The People's Liberation Army Navy
reportedly conducted its first test of the JL-3 in November 2018 (Gertz
2018) and appears to have conducted at least two---possibly
three---additional tests since then (Chan 2020; Guo and Liu 2019).

Although the [Jin-class is more advanced]{.underline} than China's first
experimental SSBN---the single and now inoperable Xia (Type 092)---[it
is a **[noisy]{.mark} design** [compared with **current US and
Russian**]{.mark} **missile [submarines]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is
suspected that the Type [094]{.underline} remains [[**two orders of
magnitude** louder]{.mark} than the top Russian or American
SSBNs]{.underline} (Coates 2016). For that reason, [China]{.underline}
would [continue to [face **constraints** and **challenges**]{.mark} when
operating its SSBN force in a conflict]{.underline} (Kristensen 2009).
It therefore seemed likely that China would end production after its
now-completed six boats and turn its efforts to developing the quieter
third-generation (Type 096) SSBN, which was scheduled to begin
construction in the early 2020s. However, the Pentagon's 2023 report to
Congress stated that China has continued constructing additional
Jin-class SSBNs and speculates that this could be due to delays in

where the People's Liberation Army Navy's submarines are built,
[indicated that [work]{.mark} would [soon begin on the **Type
096**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which is [expected to be **larger** and
**heavier**]{.underline} than the Type 094 (Sutton 2020). [Satellite
images show wider hull sections]{.underline} at Huludao, suggesting that
production of a larger submarine may have started (Sutton 2021),
although it is not clear whether it corresponds to a new attack
submarine or the larger Type 096 SSBN. As with all new designs, the
[Type 096 is [expected to be **quieter**]{.mark} than its predecessor.
Some even believe it could be [as **quiet as Russia's new Borei-class
SSBNs**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Carlson and Wang 2023, 30), although that
would be a significant technological leap for China. Some anonymous
defense sources have speculated the Type 096 will carry 24 missiles
(Chan 2020), but there are no public official sources confirming this
information. Current and projected missile inventories seem to indicate
that the SSBN will more likely carry 12 to 16 missiles. The [Pentagon's
2023 report stated that the Type 096 SSBNs "will reportedly be [armed
with a]{.mark} follow-on **[longer range SLBM]{.mark}**," and that these
SLBMs [will probably be **MIRVed**]{.mark}]{.underline} (US Department

Future U.S.-China Crises,\" In Counterforce in Contemporary U.S. Nuclear

Our [[**quantitative analysis** mapped]{.underline}]{.mark} the [current
and [future U.S.-China **strategic force**]{.mark}
balance---[and]{.mark} the resulting expected nuclear **[weapons
exchanges]{.mark}**]{.underline} (using Riqiang's exchange model) [[to
**crisis bargaining**]{.mark}]{.underline} outcomes under differing
scenarios. This analysis evaluated both "symmetric stakes" crises where
the United States and China have similar political stakes, as well as
"asymmetric stakes" crises where perhaps the U.S.'s stakes are lower as
it is supporting an East Asian ally or partner. In the asymmetric cases,
China's stakes in the crisis are perhaps a few times that of the United
States's, rather than say an order of magnitude greater. These values
reflect the logic that the United States has more to lose if the status
quo of the international order is altered, so Washington's stakes in
defending an ally should still be significant even if lower than the
regional near-peer competitor.655 And secondly, they also reflect the
logic that if the United States does not back up a treaty ally in a
crisis, its other alliances could be called into question.656

The [analysis]{.underline} also [assumes that the United States will
continue to maintain only **1,550 deployed**]{.underline}
[weapons]{.underline} through 2035 and that [Washington only can afford
to threaten to **use half**]{.underline} of its arsenal (775 weapons)
against China [to maintain deterrence against Russia]{.underline}
post-conflict. We make this as a simplifying assumption, but also one
that is based upon historical precedent. In the late Cold War, U.S.
policymakers developed a strategy of withholding significant quantities
of weapons in planning for a conflict with the Soviet Union, as they
realized they would need to maintain deterrence against China
post-conflict.657 In this case we assume a 50/50 split only because
China and Russia are moving close to parity in terms of deployed
weapons. Of course, these assumptions could change if we become aware
that Russia plans to significantly upload significant numbers of its
stockpiled weapons into deployed units.

Readers should also fully grasp the assumptions our model makes about
player behaviors, and how we represent the way the players would
perceive a nuclear exchange to play out. First, our model assumes some
uncertainty around both the balance of stakes and the balance of power.
The players' beliefs around these quantities are modeled as probability
distributions, and it is assumed that the players know the distribution
of each other's stakes in crisis. Their actual stakes are drawn at
random from their respective probability distributions so that each
side's real stakes are held as private information. Second, our model
assumes some uncertainty around the efficacy of the players' damage
limitation capabilities, which we judge is likely reflective of reality.
We also adopt Wu Riqiang's exchange model assumptions, namely that the
United States will threaten a first strike against China's silos with a
single shot probability of kill of 99.95%, and that U.S. ground-based
interceptors (GBI) missile interceptors are only 25% effective per
shot.658 Riqiang's model also predated the deployment of Chinese
sea-based (and air-based) weapons, and we do not have a useful set of
assumptions to be able take them into account in the Riqiang exchange
model. So here we are forced to assume that the United States and its
regional allies can take out these weapons conventionally, with a
combination counter air or antisubmarine warfare capabilities. In
general, these assumptions are fairly favorable to the U.S. position, so
our findings should be taken as a best-case scenario for Washington.

Last, the analysis parameterized variables that will be important, but
which we cannot quantify with certainty. China's damage limitation
capabilities will evolve between now and 2035, but there are no good
estimates of how good they will be. So our analysis assumed varying
levels of Chinese damage limitation efficacy (namely, 10%, 50%, 30% ,and
70%). We ran cases with a perfectly effective Chinese LUA capability,
meaning detecting all U.S. missiles with no false alarms, and without
any LUA whatsoever. We also evaluated cases where the United States's
stakes are symmetric with China's, and cases where China's stakes were
four times that of the U.S.

The exchange [[analysis shows]{.mark} that]{.underline} indeed the
United [States's [bargaining position]{.mark} with China [will
**erode**]{.mark} as we **approach 2035** [due to China's
**growing**]{.mark} **nuclear [force]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But most
significant to bargaining outcomes is the [performance of China's LUA
capability]{.underline}. A [**perfectly [effective LUA]{.mark}**
capability [increases]{.mark} the [amount of force]{.mark} China can
deliver to the United States [by]{.mark} roughly
**[tenfold]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as it allows them to
[[launch]{.underline}]{.mark} their [silo-based [ICBMs
**before**]{.mark} incoming **[U.S. missiles
arrive]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The bargaining [balance of the future
also depends heavily on how much counterforce capability the Chinese can
field]{.underline}, with a 30% level of effectiveness becoming very
significant to bargaining outcomes. We also find that U.S. resolve is
critical to game outcomes, and keeping Washington's resolve fairly
symmetric is a key factor which dictates crisis outcomes. If the United
States can convince itself---and China's leaders---that East Asian
crises will be high stakes for Washington, this benefits the U.S. and
reduces requirements for strategic military capabilities.

### Future War Bad\-\--AI

#### Invasion collapses AI development.

**Cosgrove \'24** \[Emma; Business Insider reporter; July 1, 2024;
\"What Happens to AI If China Invades Taiwan? \'Chip War\' Expert
Explains,\" Business Insider,
https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-taiwan-china-chip-war-2024-6\]

What would happen to TSMC in that scenario?

[[The moment **conflict** starts in]{.mark} the [Taiwan]{.mark}
Strait]{.underline}, you have to assume that [**[TSMC shuts
down]{.mark}** very, very quickly]{.underline} regardless of what any of
the players decide to do --- [regardless of whether anyone decides to
disrupt the supply chain]{.underline} or destroy this or that or not.

[[Taiwan]{.mark} **imports**]{.underline} a big chunk of its [**energy**
and chip [factories need energy]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} And there
are a bunch of [**[critical]{.mark}** chemicals and
**[materials]{.mark}** that are [imported]{.mark} into
Taiwan]{.underline}, and those [[would stop]{.underline}]{.mark}.
What\'s more, [[you couldn\'t]{.mark} [get]{.mark} the [ships
out]{.mark} of Taiwan if there was a shooting war]{.underline} going on.
And so your [[incentive to produce]{.underline}]{.mark} a lot also
[[declines]{.mark} very [rapidly]{.mark}]{.underline} if you can\'t
actually sell chips or get them off-island.

People like to speculate who would blow up what. That\'s probably a lot
less relevant than it seems, because [[the **supply
chain**]{.underline}]{.mark} would end up being a lot [more
**[fragile]{.mark}** than]{.underline} a lot of [people
realize]{.underline}.

Can you say a little bit more about that?

[[Taiwan imports]{.underline}]{.mark} a lot of [**[l]{.mark}**iquid
**[n]{.mark}**atural **[g]{.mark}**as]{.underline}. Its power grid
depends on it. Their publicly reported data says they\'ve got 10 or so
days of LNG storage on-island, which means all you have to do is turn on
a couple of chip factories and suddenly Taiwan is in a power crisis. And
then what do you shut down first if there is a limited supply of power?
Even if there\'s no shooting --- [if there\'s just Chinese block tankers
entering the harbor --- that [alone]{.mark} could be [enough of a
**catalyst** to force]{.mark} some **really [tough]{.mark}
[decisions]{.mark}** about who gets energy]{.underline} or who doesn\'t
get it [in Taiwan]{.underline}. And [chipmakers are a major
user]{.underline} of power.

On the chipmaking material side, [there are a lot of **key
materials**]{.underline} used in making chips, photoresist for example,
and many others are produced by Japanese suppliers in particular. Having
a steady supply of those is critical for chipmaking and those aren\'t
going to be shipped if there\'s a war going on.

[When people understand]{.underline} the true significance of
[[TSMC]{.mark}, they\'re]{.underline} often pretty
[[shocked]{.underline}]{.mark} at [[how **precarious** the]{.mark}
[**chip situation** is]{.mark}]{.underline}. Do get that reaction a lot?

Yea. I mean this is why it\'s so problematic that we\'ve found ourselves
in this situation because [you can\'t really sugarcoat it]{.underline}.
The more you learn, the more worried you are. [The more you realize that
**[everything depends on peace]{.mark}** being preserved in the Taiwan
Strait --- it just illustrates the stakes]{.underline}. [This is a
dispute that [**implicates** every]{.mark} [aspect of the]{.mark}
American **[economy]{.mark}** in a potentially catastrophic way.
There\'s not a silver lining]{.underline} --- that\'s the reality.
[It\'s dark and it\'s high stakes]{.underline}.

#### Chinese AI causes existential accidents.

**Drexel 23** \[Bill; Associate Fellow at the Center for a New American
Security; Hannah Kelley, Research Assistant at the Center for a New
American Security; May 30, 2023; \"China Is Flirting With
AI Catastrophe,\" Foreign Affairs,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/china-flirting-ai-catastrophe\]

DISASTER AMNESIA

[[The **disparity** between Chinese and American perceptions of]{.mark}
the **[hazards of AI]{.mark}**---and]{.underline} their respective tech
sectors' [willingness to take risks---is no accident]{.underline}. It is
a result of [[Chinese policies]{.underline}]{.mark} that systematically
[**[suppress]{.mark} citizens'** experience of [disasters]{.mark} to
protect the government from public criticism]{.underline}.

In the United States, [disasters tend to prompt an elevated public
consciousness and enhanced safety measures]{.underline} as their
heart-rending consequences ripple through the media and society---in
machinery-intensive industries such as oil drilling, everyday food and
drug production, and the processing of dangerous chemicals. Even now,
legislators in Ohio are making progress on new safety regulations in the
wake of a fiery train derailment in February that shot a plume of toxic
chemicals above the town of East Palestine.

But [in China]{.underline}, these types of [[accidents rarely
reverberate]{.mark} through the media as the **state** maintains a
**chokehold** on information to promote a constant **atmosphere of
stability**. [The **C**]{.mark}]{.underline}hinese
**[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**ommunist **[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}**arty
[smothers information when disaster responses are mismanaged and
routinely **[falsifies death tolls]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
government sometimes refuses to acknowledge, let alone report on, vast
tragedies such as the mass radiation poisoning that resulted from at
least 40 nuclear tests conducted between 1964 and 1996, which led to the
premature deaths of nearly 200,000 citizens.

The danger of AI accidents is most severe in China.

[The [result is]{.mark} a culture of **[disaster
amnesia]{.mark}**]{.underline} in which it is often impossible for the
public to demand change or for the government to be forced to learn from
costly accidents. [[Little accountability]{.underline}]{.mark} for
mistakes [[means]{.mark} that [business owners]{.mark}]{.underline} tend
to [[play **fast and loose**]{.mark} with safety]{.underline}, as
evidenced by China's grisly history of industrial accidents. Even the
rare instances in which mishaps are publicly exposed lack the staying
power that might result in serious reform. For example, the public
outcry about mass-produced toxic toothpaste in 2007, poisoned infant
milk formula in 2008, and the collision of high-speed trains near
Wenzhou in 2011 prompted well-publicized displays of scapegoating and
loudly proclaimed government reform plans but had limited impacts on
public safety. The Chinese government often projects a facade of
responsiveness but then buries information about the events,
quite literally in the case of the now-underground remains of the
Wenzhou train wreckage. Given that China has a far more restrictive
media ecosystem under Xi Jinping than it did when these incidents
occurred, public exposure is even less likely today.

[With [the worst run-ins with **emerging technologies**]{.mark}
routinely [excised from]{.mark} public consciousness]{.underline},
[Chinese society exhibits a seemingly boundless sense of
**[techno-optimism]{.mark}**, especially [toward]{.mark}]{.underline}
new technologies such as [[AI]{.underline}]{.mark}. Given that [China's
historic ascent from poverty went hand in hand with high-speed
technological advancement]{.underline}, accelerated scientific research
is practically synonymous with national progress in the Chinese
zeitgeist---viewed as having few, if any, downsides.

To see this full-steam-ahead approach in action, look no further than He
Jiankui, the Chinese scientist who shocked the world in 2018 by
genetically modifying human embryos in secret to produce the world\'s
first gene-edited babies. The doctor expected, and initially received,
high praise in China for his feat, but the government clumsily pulled an
about-face in response to international outrage over his unilateral
decision to push humanity into uncharted territory. Unsurprisingly,
further examination showed that He irreversibly botched his experiment,
in what one geneticist called \"a graphic demonstration of attempted
gene editing gone awry." He not only likely failed to make the modified
babies (and their potential offspring) HIV-resistant as intended, but
also potentially increased their susceptibility to influenza, cancer,
and other diseases. After a stint in prison, He was released
and continues his research, alongside new Chinese legislation
providing loopholes for similar ethically fraught and potentially
lucrative genetic experimentation.

UNBRIDLED AMBITION

[Not only are experimental technologies seen as largely risk-free in
China, but [the country]{.mark}]{.underline} has also
[[committed]{.underline}]{.mark} itself [[to a **feverish sprint** to
become "the world's premier a]{.underline}]{.mark}rtificial
[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}ntelligence [[innovation]{.mark} [center" by
**2030**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[China's efforts to overtake the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [in AI have been a priority]{.underline} for the
Communist Party since at least 2015, when Xi announced his "Made in
China 2025" strategy. This emphasis on AI has since been reiterated in
various national documents and speeches. [[AI]{.mark} has [become
a **linchpin** of China's **military modernization**]{.mark} strategy
[and]{.mark} is increasingly integral to]{.underline} the country's
system of state [[**surveillance**, **repression**,
and **control**]{.underline}]{.mark}. With so much at stake, [it is no
surprise that China's government has been [investing **tens of billions
of dollars annually**]{.mark}]{.underline} into its AI sector and
leveraging its vast espionage network to try to steal foreign corporate
technology secrets.

China's AI frenzy is paying off. The country produces more top-tier AI
engineers than any other country---around 45 percent more than the
United States, its closest competitor. It has also overtaken the United
States in publishing high-quality AI research, accounting for nearly 30
percent of citations in AI journals globally in 2021, compared with 15
percent for the United States. This year, China is projected to overtake
the United States in its share of the top one percent of the world's
most-cited AI papers. As the U.S. National Security Commission on
Artificial Intelligence warned, "China possesses the might, talent, and
ambition to surpass the United States as the world's leader in AI in the
next decade if current trends do not change."

[[Theorists]{.mark} have long [worried]{.mark} that [AI
competition]{.mark} might [initiate a **race to the bottom**]{.mark} on
safety]{.underline}. But in competitions between major powers,
established [incumbents and ambitious challengers usually have vastly
different levels of risk aversion]{.underline}, with the latter often
demonstrating far more appetite for risk in a quest to rebalance
perceived asymmetries.

[Today's [AI]{.mark}]{.underline} sprint would [[not]{.mark} be [the
first time Beijing's]{.mark} desire to hasten **[progress invited
disaster]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} Chinese leader Mao
Zedong's attempt to collectivize farms, melt down agricultural tools to
feed industrial development, and turbocharge steel production in his
so-called [Great Leap Forward plunged China into the **worst famine in
human history**]{.underline}, with an estimated 30 million people
starving to death between 1959 and 1961. Later, [China's]{.underline}
attempt to slam the brakes on population growth through its 1979
[one-child policy]{.underline}---adjusted to a two-child policy only in
2015---[led to widespread forced abortions and infanticide]{.underline},
a population imbalance of roughly 33 million more males than females,
and a severe demographic aging crisis across the country. 

Less encompassing acceleration efforts, such as China's 1990s rush to
cash in on the commercial satellite launch industry, also
catalyzed tragedy when a rocket blasted into a Chinese town in 1996,
killing an unknown number of victims. Today, according to investigative
reporting by The Wall Street Journal, hydroelectric plants, social
housing complexes, and schools built around the world as part of China's
ambitious Belt and Road Initiative are literally falling apart, imposing
vast costs on already impoverished countries.

A TRAGIC TRACK RECORD

[China's drive]{.underline} to outdo the United States [in [AI]{.mark}
capabilities has not yet produced any crises. But history suggests that
if one occurred, Beijing's [response]{.mark} would be
[**calamitous**. Authoritarian]{.mark} state[s]{.mark} routinely
**[mismanage emergencies]{.mark}**, turning accidents into full-blown
**tragedies**]{.underline}. Averting the worst outcomes depends on
recognizing anomalies early on, especially those that might suggest bad
news. But autocracies struggle to do that. There is no reason to expect
anything different as the perils linked to AI take shape.

When worrisome developments arise in China, [party
officials]{.underline} are incentivized to [suppress troubling
information]{.underline} rather than risk their positions by reporting
bad news to their superiors, [beginning a **vicious cycle** that tends
toward catastrophe]{.underline}. The famine caused by Mao's Great Leap
Forward is a case in point. If farm collectivization and melting down
tools set the stage for a crisis, it was the official cover-up of the
early signs of danger that ultimately snowballed a bad harvest to mass
starvation.

The same pattern recurs in contemporary China with unnerving frequency.
Consider, for example, the layers of government obfuscation that led at
least one million Chinese men, women, and children to contract HIV by
selling blood or receiving transfusions of contaminated blood in the
1990s. Despite regular early reports of the budding disaster, local
officials aggressively suppressed evidence for years to protect their
careers. Many of them were promoted even after the suppression and its
effects were known.

The highly lethal 2002 SARS outbreak in China was likewise covered up by
the Chinese government for about four months, even as the deadly
virus infected more than 8,000 people around the world and killed 774.
And despite investing \$850 million in public health mechanisms
specifically designed to ensure that a SARS-like cover-up did not happen
again, the government followed a similar path in its response to the
COVID-19 pandemic. Critical weeks elapsed between the first recorded
COVID case in Wuhan in December 2019 and China's acknowledgment of the
risk of human-to-human transmission on January 20, 2020. By that time,
seven million individuals had freely traveled from Wuhan to other
locales, spreading the virus across the country and beyond.

During and after the COVID-19 outbreak, the Chinese government harassed
and detained doctors and journalists who tried to bring life-saving
information about the virus to light. At the same time, it lied to the
World Health Organization, causing the WHO to fatally misadvise the rest
of the world on the risks of COVID in the early weeks of the pandemic.
To this day, the Chinese government refuses to offer
the transparency needed to determine the origins of the virus, which may
well have been the result of yet another Chinese high-tech accident.

BE AWARE, TAKE CARE

Those skeptical of the risks of a Chinese AI catastrophe might point to
the government's comparative willingness to regulate AI, or the fact
that China still lags behind the United States in building the most
sophisticated and therefore risky capabilities. But as with the rules
governing the Chinese Internet, [much of Beijing's AI
legislation aims only to ensure that companies remain subservient to the
government]{.underline} and able to compete with their Western
counterparts. These laws are also designed to suppress any information
that threatens the regime.

And although it may be true that the United States leads in cutting-edge
AI technology, it is also clear
that [clever [tinkering]{.mark} with others' systems can [bring
out]{.mark} some of their most [**dangerous** and]{.mark}
**[unanticipated capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}, such as combining
models for enhanced capacity to plan and execute chemical experiments.
It is all too easy to steal, copy, or clone advanced AI models and tweak
them, potentially stripping them of safety features. And if
China's technology sector is good at anything, it is quickly adapting
others' creations for maximum impact, a strategy that has been the
engine of its growth for decades.

The potential for AI tragedy is hardly unique to China. As with any
powerful new technology, disasters could strike anywhere, and
smaller-scale incidents from accidents and misuse are
already occurring regularly around the world with self-driving car
crashes, AI voice-cloning scams, and the misidentification of people by
law enforcement agencies using facial recognition, to name a few. Given
its leading role in pioneering new AI capabilities, the United States in
particular confronts a high risk of costly failures. American companies
and the government would be wise to bolster their own AI safety efforts,
as many lawmakers are now realizing.

China ranks as the most optimistic country in the world when it comes to
AI.

But [from Chernobyl to COVID, history shows that the most **acute
risks** of catastrophe stem from **authoritarian** states, which are far
more prone to systemic missteps]{.underline} that exacerbate an initial
mistake or accident. China's blithe attitude toward technological risk,
the government's reckless ambition, and Beijing's crisis mismanagement
are all on a collision course with the escalating dangers of AI.

A variety of U.S. policy measures could help mitigate these risks.
[[Industry and government]{.mark} could [**double down** on]{.mark}
[restricting]{.mark} the commercial flow of easily **[weaponized AI
research]{.mark}**]{.underline} to China in recognition of the serious
threat it poses, including through technology transfer tactics that
leverage joint ventures and Chinese investments. American diplomacy
could champion the establishment of global AI safety standards. The
United States, in coordination with the international community, could
also monitor potential safety concerns in advanced AI labs around the
world with an eye toward crafting contingency plans in the case of
failures with spillover effects. There is precedent for doing so: the
United States has been known to monitor the risks of accidents from
dangerous behavior in Chinese biolabs, nuclear reactors, and space
operations.

General Secretary Xi Jinping has [set ambitious goals for the PLA to
"**basically complete**" its modernization by **2035** and transform
into a "**world-class**" military by the middle of the

refers to [fielding modern platforms and equipment]{.underline};
informatization refers to [linking those systems]{.underline} to
networks such as GPS; [and]{.underline} intelligentization refers to
[integrating **a**]{.underline}rtificial **[i]{.underline}**ntelligence,
[**quantum computing**, big data, and other **emerging
tech**nologies]{.underline} into the joint force.4 In 2020, China set a
new goal to "accelerate the integrated development of mechanization,
informatization, and intelligentization" by 2027.5 In other words,
[Beijing aims to make progress on all three stages
simultaneously]{.underline} rather than sequentially.

[Beijing sees progressing through these stages as necessary to keep pace
with changes in]{.underline} the technological character of [warfare in
the 21st century. Chinese scholars speak about the ongoing revolution in
military affairs as]{.underline} one of weapons "[**systems
confrontation**" requiring "**systems destruction
warfare**]{.underline}" to win.6 [To compete in this emerging era of
conflict, the PLA is developing]{.underline} an overarching concept it
calls "**[multidomain precision warfare]{.underline}**."7 In layman's
terms, this concept posits that the very networking that gives the U.S.
military its power creates interdependencies between its forces, which
are also vulnerabilities that can be exploited. Thus, rather than
needing to destroy U.S. enemy forces directly---ship-to-ship or
tank-to-tank---[China can attack the weak points linking U.S.
systems]{.underline} and domains together and thereby neutralize or
overwhelm U.S. advantages. Those weak points can include internet,
satellite, or electromagnetic communications links as well as logistical
supply systems.

[**AI** is a **critical** part of this strategy]{.underline} because, in
the dynamic environment of an actual conflict, [identifying and
targeting U.S. vulnerabilities will require sensing, relaying, and
processing vast amounts of information]{.underline} at a speed only
computers can match. [AI is also key for **u**]{.underline}ncrewed
**[a]{.underline}**utonomous **[s]{.underline}**ystems. In his speech to
the CCP's 20th National Congress in October 2022, [Xi called on China
to]{.underline} "[speed up the development of unmanned, intelligent
combat capabilities]{.underline}."8 In addition, China's program of
Military-Civil Fusion---although its scope remains ambiguous in
practice---seeks to appropriate select private technological
advancements, including some developed in cooperation with international
research partners, to augment the PLA's capabilities.9

III\. AI Implementation in the PLA

[China takes an **expansive** view of **military AI's potential** and is
engaged in extensive research, development, and
experimentation]{.underline}.10 But so far, open-source information
about the PLA fielding specific military AI systems remains sparse. [The
roles for AI within China's overall program of military modernization
are still]{.underline} generally [coming into focus]{.underline}.
Researchers at the Center for Security and Emerging Technology analyzed
343 PLA equipment contracts and found seven areas of interest for
current AI investments: (1) [intelligent and autonomous
vehicles]{.underline}; (2) [i]{.underline}ntelligence,
[s]{.underline}urveillance, and [r]{.underline}econnaissance; (3)
predictive [maintenance and logistics]{.underline}; (4) [information and
electronic warfare]{.underline}; (5) [simulation and
training]{.underline}; (6) [c]{.underline}ommand [and]{.underline}
[c]{.underline}ontrol; and (7) [automated target
recognition]{.underline}.11 Those categories are illustrative but not
necessarily exhaustive. Two areas of special focus are AI in the PLA's
weapons systems and AI in the PLA's battlefield functions and support:

[AI in the PLA's Weapons Systems]{.underline} (Uncrewed Systems,
LAWS). [Assessing China's progress in developing]{.underline} and
fielding uncrewed autonomous vehicles (i.e., [drones]{.underline}) [for
air, ground, sea surface, and subsea applications is
difficult]{.underline}. Beijing clearly has a large and sophisticated
drone industry and is the world's largest exporter of military
drones.12 But the fact that [those systems can operate without an
onboard crew indicates little about the degree to which they can act
autonomously]{.underline}; [autonomy would be enabled by AI and is
therefore highly dependent on]{.underline} the [quality]{.underline} of
the AI. [Uncrewed systems possess varying levels of
autonomy]{.underline}. These range from essentially no autonomy in fully
remote- controlled systems, to completely autonomous systems that can
navigate, choose targets, and even fire without human control, with
multiple levels in between.13 As DOD's 2023 China Military Power
Report states, the PLA is "pursuing greater autonomy for unmanned
aerial, surface, and underwater vehicles to enable manned and unmanned
teaming, swarm attacks, optimized logistic support, and distributed ISR
\[intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance\], among other
capabilities."14

China's commercial drone companies have exhibited a world-class ability
to operate in AI-dependent swarms, which is likely to be a key
capability for military applications.15 [Swarming is an area where
capabilities developed in the private sector could be applied to the
military sector]{.underline} [quickly]{.underline}. Additionally, China
is developing a system called the FH- 97A, which is similar to the U.S.
"loyal wingman" concept, where an autonomous aircraft flies in a team
alongside a crewed aircraft.

Separately, [China's drone capabilities link directly to]{.underline}
the global debate about lethal autonomous weapons systems
([LAWS]{.underline}) or, less formally, "[killer robots]{.underline}."
[The PLA possesses plenty of lethal military power, but right now
none]{.underline} of it appears to [have meaningful levels of
autonomy]{.underline} enabled by AI. Beijing's official policy on
regulating LAWS is ambiguous, leaving open the possibility that China
could develop and field such systems if the technology matures.

### Counterforcing now

#### China's arsenal is vulnerable now\-\--the US can counterforce Chinese capabilities and missile defenses take the rest out, but future modernization prevents that.

Misunderstood Nuclear Expansion,\" Foreign Affairs, 11-10-2023,

//TL

Since then, however, [[China]{.mark} has been [**rapidly expanding** and
**modernizing**]{.mark} its arsenal]{.underline}. In 2020, it began
[constructing]{.underline} three [silo fields to house more than
300]{.underline} intercontinental ballistic missiles
([ICBMs]{.underline}). A year later, it successfully [tested a
hypersonic glide vehicle]{.underline} that traveled 21,600 miles, a test
that likely [demonstrated]{.underline} China's [[ability]{.mark} [to
field]{.mark}]{.underline} weapons that can orbit the earth before
striking targets, known as a "**[[fractional orbital bombardment]{.mark}
system]{.underline}**." Simultaneously, the [Chinese government has
accelerated its [pursuit of a **complete**]{.mark} **nuclear
[triad]{.mark}**]{.underline}---encompassing land-, sea-, and
air-launched nuclear weapons---including [by developing new
**submarine**- and **air-launched ballistic missiles**]{.underline}. By
2030, according to U.S. Defense Department estimates, China will
probably have more than 1,000 operational nuclear warheads---a more than
fourfold increase from just a decade earlier.

China's nuclear expansion is unlikely to be a focus of U.S. President
Joe Biden's expected meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping at the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit next week, but it is too
important to be left entirely to defense strategists. Rather than
maintaining only enough forces to be able to retaliate if
attacked---China's policy for decades---many in the United States now
fear [China's nuclear buildout will give it **offensive
options**]{.underline} as well. In 2021, Charles Richard, then the
leader of U.S. Strategic Command, described [China's nuclear
expansion]{.underline} as a "[**strategic breakout**" that will provide
it "with the capability to execute any **plausible nuclear employment
strategy**]{.underline}."

To understand the rationale for this transformation, some in Washington
have looked to the specific nature of the buildup. For example,
Secretary of the Air Force Frank Kendall has suggested that,
[[regardless of]{.mark} China's [intentions]{.mark}]{.underline}, the
[[construction]{.mark} of hundreds of ICBM silos [amounts to
**developing**]{.mark} a **[first-strike
capability]{.mark}**]{.underline}: having enough weapons to destroy an
adversary's nuclear arsenal by attacking first. But seeking to infer
motivations from capabilities alone can produce misleading worst-case
assumptions, especially given the tendency to project U.S. strategy onto
potential adversaries, an analytical pitfall known as mirror-imaging.

In fact, China's own nuclear strategists and experts provide a different
view of Chinese thinking. Their writings and analysis since 2015 suggest
that China's nuclear expansion is less a shift in Chinese intentions
than a response to what Beijing perceives as threatening changes in U.S.
nuclear strategy, reflecting an acute security dilemma. Chinese analysts
are worried that the United States has lowered its threshold for nuclear
use---including allowing for limited first use in a Taiwan
conflict---and that the [U.S. military is acquiring **new
capabilities**]{.underline} that [could be used to **destroy** or
significantly **degrade** China's nuclear forces]{.underline}. Thus,
many Chinese experts have concluded that China needs a more robust
arsenal.

Given Chinese and U.S. fears about each other's nuclear programs,
increased communication may help to break the spiral. Based on Chinese
fears, the United States should understand how changes in its nuclear
capabilities and doctrine play a critical role in shaping China's threat
perceptions and perceived force requirements. Going forward, China will
continue to respond to U.S. advances that are viewed as weakening
China's nuclear deterrent. Similarly, Beijing should understand that the
lack of transparency surrounding its rapid nuclear expansion has fueled
worst-case assessments by the United States. Continued lack of
transparency will lead to even greater U.S. suspicion---and feed an
intensifying arms race between the two countries.

REACTIVE AGENTS

Since around 2018, Chinese experts have concluded that [Washington's
nuclear posture now poses increasing **challenges** to **China's
deterrent**]{.underline}. In particular, they have been concerned about
[shifts in U.S. strategy outlined]{.underline} in the Pentagon's 2018
Nuclear Posture Review. Many Chinese experts have noted that the review
highlighted China as a strategic competitor and that it argued for
[lowering the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons, including in
response to certain kinds of nonnuclear attacks]{.underline}. They also
[noted]{.underline} the report's [emphasis on low-yield nuclear
weapons]{.underline}, which could possibly be used to coerce China.
Citing the views of analysts such as Elbridge Colby, who served as
deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategy and force development
in the Trump administration, Chinese experts saw the new U.S. posture as
designed, in part, to compensate for the fact that East Asia's
conventional military balance was shifting in China's favor.

More specifically, the 2018 review increased Chinese fears that the
[[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} might [[engage in
**limited**]{.mark} nuclear [**first use** during]{.mark} a conventional
[conflict]{.mark} with China]{.underline}, most likely **[[over
Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}**. According to Chinese arms control expert
Li Bin, the document suggested that "the [United States would use its
nuclear weapons to respond to nonnuclear Chinese
aggressions]{.underline}." More pointed was the analysis of Luo Xi, an
expert from the Peoples Liberation Army's (PLA) Academy of Military
Science, which reports directly to the Chinese Communist Party's Central
Military Commission and helps to formulate its military strategy and
doctrine: "China cannot refrain from being concerned about the
possibility of US nuclear first use in a regional crisis," she wrote. A
retired Chinese general, Pan Zhenqiang, was even blunter: "China must
contemplate a war scenario in which the US may launch a nuclear attack,
perhaps in a conflict over the Taiwan Strait," he said in 2018. Another
expert from the Academy of Military Science emphasized that by lowering
the nuclear threshold, Washington could "promote the escalation of
low-intensity conflicts to nuclear war."

Beijing has also worried about the [U.S. development of both offensive
and defensive weapons]{.underline} systems that [could **negate**
China's **nuclear deterrent**]{.underline}. First was the possibility
that the United States was building [new **conventional weapons** that
could be used to attack China's nuclear forces]{.underline}, a strategy
known as conventional counterforce. In contrast to using nuclear weapons
to destroy an adversary's nuclear forces---a step that would almost
guarantee nuclear retaliation---these arms allow the attacker to degrade
or even destroy the adversary's nuclear arsenal without crossing the
nuclear threshold. [The threat of a conventional attack on China's
arsenal is further heightened by the range of systems that might be
deployed]{.underline}, especially [**long-range precision-strike**
weapons]{.underline} but [also]{.underline} forms of [**cyberwarfare**
and **electronic warfare**]{.underline}. As one researcher from the
PLA's National Defense University noted, the United States' [growing
**conventional counterforce capabilities**]{.underline} may "[encourage
the attacker to launch a first strike]{.underline} in situations where
nuclear weapons are not used, undermining strategic stability."

At the same time, Chinese experts are also concerned that [enhanced U.S.
missile defenses could **undermine** China's]{.underline} longtime
strategy of "assured **[retaliation]{.underline}**"---the ability to
launch a nuclear counterattack after an enemy's first strike. Although
Chinese experts regard current U.S. missile defense as limited, their
long-standing concerns about these systems intensified in the years
before Beijing began building the new silo fields. To assuage China (and
Russia), the United States has long justified missile defenses as aimed
at threats from rogue states such as North Korea or Iran. But the U.S.
Defense Department's 2019 Missile Defense Review called for a
[comprehensive approach to regional missile threats]{.underline},
including from China, and [stated that U.S. missile **defense systems**
would be used to **counter** any missile attack]{.underline} on the
United States, [including]{.underline} presumably any [Chinese
**counterstrike**]{.underline}. According to Luo Xi, the Academy of
Military Sciences scholar, the [United States could use missile defenses
to "**destroy China's second-strike capability**]{.underline}."

Taken together, these two developments suggested that the [United States
posed an elevated threat to China's nuclear deterrent]{.underline}. In
essence, [[the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [**could** use
conventional]{.mark} weapons [systems (or nuclear ones) to]{.mark}
**[destroy]{.mark} most of [China's]{.mark}** small nuclear
**[arsenal]{.mark}**]{.underline} and [**[then use]{.mark}** its
**missile [defenses to limit China's]{.mark}** [**ability to
retaliate**]{.mark} with any surviving missiles]{.underline}. As two PLA
Air Force scholars wrote in 2019, this "combined use of strategic
offensive and strategic defensive systems will give the United States a
monopolistic strategic advantage."

Meanwhile, Chinese concerns have been exacerbated by the collapse of the
1987 U.S.-Soviet Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, which
had prohibited the use of ground-launched short- to intermediate-range
nuclear and conventional missile systems. By removing range limits on
ground-launched missiles, the treaty's demise in 2019 led experts from
China's National University of Defense Technology to describe [U.S.
forward-deployed missiles]{.underline} as a "[huge threat" to China's
mobile missiles, which]{.underline} they claim [are vulnerable when in
fixed positions]{.underline} during the launch phase. For this reason,
an expert from the China Institutes of Contemporary International
Relations warned that same year that U.S. deployment of
intermediate-range missiles might cause great tension with China,
perhaps even spurring an "Asian Cuban missile crisis."

MORE WAYS TO RETALIATE

To be clear, China has not been transparent about the purpose and goals
of its nuclear buildup. For example, its last defense white paper was
published in 2019, before the construction of the new silo fields began.
Nevertheless, indications from China differ in significant ways from the
most alarmist U.S. interpretations. U.S. military leaders have argued
that [[China's **buildup provides**]{.mark} it with **[offensive
options]{.mark} that make it far more threatening** to the United
States]{.underline} and that raise new challenges for U.S. nuclear
strategy. But writings by Chinese analysts, as well as statements by
Communist Party officials including Xi Jinping, suggest that the Chinese
debate so far has revolved around how to better implement China's
existing strategy of assured retaliation---making sure it has sufficient
nuclear forces to respond to a nuclear attack. If these indications are
correct, they suggest that China's expansion is less immediately
threatening than it might appear and that a forceful U.S. response would
only exacerbate unnecessary arms-race dynamics.

Consider, for instance, Xi's remarks at the 20th National Party Congress
in October 2022. During a speech, the Chinese leader called for the PLA
to establish "a strong system of strategic deterrence." The following
month, the outgoing vice chair of the Central Military Commission, Xu
Qiliang, noted that the PLA's approach to strategic deterrence should be
based on "asymmetric balancing"---suggesting that China would not seek
nuclear parity with the United States or Russia.

Before China began building the new silo fields, Chinese strategists had
also underscored the need to improve the country's deterrent, noting
that the size of its force has always been a relative figure based on
what is required for a secure second strike. In 2018, for example, two
arms control scholars at Tsinghua University argued that the relatively
small size of China's existing arsenal had created new opportunities for
adversaries to "carry out nuclear threats." These concerns were echoed
by other Chinese experts, who argued that China's second-strike
capability was "far from assured." Also noteworthy is what available
Chinese writings omit: any discussion of moving toward a first-use
strategy, even limited first use.

[Many of the new capabilities]{.underline} China has been
[developing]{.underline} are [intended to enhance
survivability]{.underline}---the ability of its nuclear forces to
withstand a first strike and be able to launch a retaliatory one. The
U.S. Defense Department has acknowledged, for example, that a [key
purpose of China's fractional orbital bombardment system is to evade
U.S. missile defense]{.underline} radars, presumably [for]{.underline}
use in a [potential retaliatory strike.]{.underline}

Similarly, starting in 2018, scholars affiliated with the PLA Rocket
Force University of Engineering began publishing articles that examined
how to better protect the land-based missiles that form the backbone of
China's deterrent. As one article described, by enhancing the country's
readiness to use nuclear weapons, silo-based forces can help "to ensure
effective deterrence." The 2020 edition of the PLA National Defense
University's Science of Military Strategy also described how combining
missiles on mobile launchers, which can be widely dispersed, with
silo-based missiles can give China more ways to retaliate.

Chinese experts have also discussed other ways to strengthen China's
nuclear deterrent. These include reducing reaction time---the time it
would take for China's nuclear forces to respond to an attack. Chinese
strategists have debated the merits and drawbacks of a partial or
complete "launch on warning" system, under which Beijing would fire its
missiles after an opponent's missiles have been launched but before
impact and detonation. Another potential step includes deploying missile
defenses to protect Chinese nuclear infrastructure. [Chinese **experts**
have also debated whether to **contemplate strikes on systems** that
support the U.S. missile defense program, such as U.S. **early-warning
satellites**]{.underline}---[despite]{.underline} the
[potential]{.underline} that such a [move could be highly
**destabilizing**]{.underline}.

It is, of course, possible that the [purpose of China's nuclear
expansion and modernization is to create a "**[nuclear shield]{.mark}**"
that would [enable]{.mark}]{.underline} conventional [[offensive
operations]{.mark} against Taiwan]{.underline}. In this view, by
possessing a robust deterrent, [China can **[initiate or
escalate]{.mark}** a conventional **[conflict against Taiwan]{.mark}**
while deterring U.S. nuclear coercion]{.underline} or limited nuclear
strikes, thereby **[[increasing]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[odds of
victory]{.underline}]{.mark}** for Beijing. But available Chinese
sources written before the expansion began contain no direct discussion
of such a goal.

There have [[also]{.mark} been [calls]{.mark} in China [to develop
**tactical nuclear weapons**]{.mark}. Breaking]{.underline} with a [past
taboo]{.underline}, some prominent experts have publicly suggested that
[China may]{.underline} need to [add tactical nuclear weapons to its
arsenal to deter U.S]{.underline}. limited nuclear [first
use]{.underline}. If Chinese concerns about U.S. nuclear strategy
continue to increase, [Beijing could **embrace** this view, with the
highly precise DF-26 theater-range missile offering a **likely delivery
vehicle** for a lower-yield warhead]{.underline}. But most Chinese
nuclear experts appear to oppose these weapons, and no open-source
evidence has revealed any plans to field them.

almost [certainly **[degrade]{.mark} China's [nuclear force]{.mark}**

In response to this sub-optimal operational picture, the [**U**nited
**S**tates has sought to build and deploy capabilities]{.underline} and,
importantly, to develop strategies [that can actively **undermine**
China]{.underline}'s approach. The 2019 Missile Defense Review
highlighted the importance to the Pentagon of missile defense, not only
to protect the homeland, but also regionally (US Department of Defense
2019b).

Although the review stated that nuclear deterrence and not missile
defense was the cornerstone of the strategy to prevent China from
utilizing its ICBM capabilities, it was much less clear regarding
China's conventional capabilities (US Department of Defense 2019b, 8).
Indeed, the review explicitly highlights the strategic dangers that such
capabilities pose to the United States and its allies (US Department of
Defense 2019b, 19). Importantly, the [review also highlights the
Integrated Air and Missile Defense (**IAMD**) concept]{.underline} that
is [designed to **stop** an **enemy from using offensive weapons**
through a combination of **deterrent**, **defensive**, and **offensive**
operations]{.underline} (US Department of Defense 2019b, 33).

This [combination]{.underline} of capabilities [reflects]{.underline}
the weaknesses of existing missile defenses (although they are
improving) and the [need to **[target C4ISR]{.mark}** nodes and
[**launch facilities** before]{.mark} the [opposition]{.mark}
fires]{.underline} its missiles. By [raising]{.underline} the
[possibility of offensive operations]{.underline}, the
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates is [developing a [strategy
**linked** to **advances**]{.mark} **in technology** [to
**target**]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[**weak points** in China's missile
architecture]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is also vital to note that these
same capabilities could equally be used to target the missile
infrastructure of the DPRK.

The [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [possesses **superior
[targeting ]{.mark}**[and **intelligence** capabilities]{.mark}
that]{.underline}, if leveraged, will [[provide]{.underline}]{.mark} US
[[forces]{.mark} with the [ability to **find and destroy**
Chinese]{.mark}]{.underline} fixed and mobile
[[capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} with conventional weapons (Long and
Rittenhouse Green 2015, 60--64).

Ongoing investments in [**[stealth]{.mark}** capabilities]{.underline}
such as the B-21 Raider and upgrades to the B2 Spirit Bomber are
intended to [ensure that the United States can [**penetrate** high
density]{.mark} **enemy [defenses]{.mark}**]{.underline} like those
possessed by China. Additionally, improved and [future versions of the
**[Tomahawk]{.mark}** cruise missile]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
AGM-158 [**[JASSM]{.mark}** cruise missile [provide the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates with an [**increased ability** to attack targets]{.mark}
from **greater distances**]{.underline}.

Following the 2019 [US withdrawal from the **INF**]{.underline}
(Intermediate Range Nuclear Forces) treaty, the then US Defense
Secretary, Mark Esper, stated that he would like to [deploy
ground-launched intermediate-range missiles in Asia]{.underline} as soon
as possible (Ali 2019). Although, as some analysts have pointed out,
many countries in Asia may be reluctant to deploy missiles on their
territory for fear of Chinese economic and political reprisals, it
remains possible that [[Washington]{.mark} will]{.underline} attempt to
[deploy them in parts of the Asian theatre]{.underline}. Finally,
[the]{.underline} Prompt Global Strike Concept ([PGS]{.underline}) seeks
to [[use]{.mark} new technologies such as
**[hypersonic]{.mark}**]{.underline} glide vehicles [to [rapidly
**target and engage**]{.mark} enemy capabilities]{.underline} from areas
proximate to the United States. These [resources]{.underline} could very
well be [used in a China related scenario, [**destroying immediate
threats** and]{.mark} **related** military
**[infrastructure]{.mark}**]{.underline} such as C2 (command and
communication) nodes5

Away from the offensive capabilities, there has [also been a
[significant investment]{.mark} in and deployment of missile defense
systems. These include]{.underline} continuous upgrades of the
**[[Patriot]{.underline}]{.mark}** Missile Systems deployed in Japan and
Korea, the [deployment of **[THAAD]{.mark}**]{.underline} (the US
Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system for intercepting incoming
ballistic missiles) on the Korean Peninsula, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
the continued [[use of **naval vessels as**]{.mark} missile
**[defense]{.mark}** pickets]{.underline} in the waters around Japan.

[[The]{.mark} [US]{.mark} and its allies are [capable
of]{.mark}]{.underline} threatening and [**[destroying all]{.mark}**
of]{.underline} Russia and [**[China's nuclear launch]{.mark}
[sites]{.mark}**[ with conventional weapons,]{.mark}
creating]{.underline} what two experts describe as [a potentially
unstable geopolitical situation]{.underline}.

Prof Dan Plesch and Manuel Galileo, from Soas University of London,
describe [[a "**quiet revolution**]{.mark} in military affairs"
[reflecting increased US]{.mark} military [power]{.mark} relative to
Moscow and Beijing]{.underline}, particularly in missile technology.

They argue that [this could create the conditions for a fresh **arms
race** as China and Russia try to respond -- and even create a risk of
**miscalculation**]{.underline} in a major crisis as either country
could resort to launching nuclear weapons to get ahead of the US.

In a paper published on Thursday, Plesch and Galileo write that the US
has "[a plausible present day capacity with non-nuclear forces to
pre-empt]{.underline} Russian and [Chinese nuclear forces" -- giving it
a **military edge**]{.underline} over the two countries.

[There are]{.underline}, the authors estimate, [[150 Russian
remote]{.mark} nuclear [launch sites and **70
in China**]{.mark}]{.underline}, approximately 2,500km (1,550 miles)
from the nearest border, [[all]{.mark} of [which could be reached
by]{.mark} US air-launched JASSM and Tomahawk **[cruise
missiles]{.mark}**]{.underline} in a little more than two hours in an
initial attack designed to [prevent nuclear weapons being
launched]{.underline}.

"[The US and its allies can threaten even the most buried and mobile
strategic forces]{.underline} of Russia and China," the authors write,
with an estimated 3,500 of the JASSM and 4,000 Tomahawks available to
the US and its allies.

New developments also mean that [JASSMs]{.underline} (joint
air-to-surface standoff missiles) [can be launched on
pallets]{.underline}, using the Rapid Dragon system, from unmodified
standard military transport aircraft, such as the C-17 Globemaster or
C-130 Hercules.

"Our analysis predicts that [only]{.underline} Russian [mobile and
Chinese deeply buried strategic systems may be considered at all
survivable]{.underline} in the face of conventional missile attacks [and
are far more **vulnerable** than usually considered]{.underline}," they
add.

Plesch and Galileo argue there is insufficient public discussion about
the strategic capabilities of the US if there were to be a major
confrontation, arguing that debates about a conflict involving Russia
and China tend to be focused on regional dynamics, such as the war in
Ukraine or a possible invasion of Taiwan.

"[[US]{.mark} global conventional **[firepower is
underestimated]{.mark}**, which threatens]{.underline} both the
realities and the [**perceptions** of strategic stability]{.underline},"
they write, adding that [any **hybrid use** of nuclear weapons alongside
conventional missiles would complicate an already **fraught
picture**]{.underline}.

Though few believe a major confrontation between the US and either
Russia or China is possible, the invasion of Ukraine has dramatically
increased global uncertainty. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin,
warned in March that Moscow would be willing to use nuclear weapons if
its sovereignty or independence was threatened.

The two authors argue that a strategic concern is whether Russia or
China fear the US's military capabilities to the point where they
justify a new arms race. "The US 2024 Threat Assessment itself
highlighted Chinese fear of a US first strike as motive for Chinese
nuclear arms buildup," they said.

The strength of the US conventional missile capabilities is such that it
"pressures Russia and China to put their missiles on hair trigger",
ready to be launched immediately, the authors write. "The US would be on
the receiving end for any mistaken launch one of them makes," they add.

Last year, China began deploying a small number of nuclear weapons -- a
total of 24 -- with their launchers, according to research from the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute -- and the US warned it
may have to increase the size of its deployed warheads in response.

Plesch and Galileo warn that the changes in military power come at a
time when **[[arms control is declining]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In 2019,
the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces arms control treaty, which had
prohibited the US and Russia from having ground-launched missiles with
ranges of 500 to 5,500km, was allowed to lapse -- leaving both sides to
redeploy them.

### Counterforce\-\--Allies

US [[allies]{.underline}]{.mark} are also [[modelling]{.mark} their
[**missile defense** strategies on]{.mark} their [larger ally]{.mark}
with an **increased focus** on intermixing **offensive** and
**defensive** capabilities]{.underline}. Such [strategies]{.underline},
particularly when enacted in coordination with the United States, could
[[place]{.underline}]{.mark} the [assumptions behind [China's **nuclear
capability in jeopardy**]{.mark}. Japan]{.underline} is [investing
heavily in missile defenses]{.underline}, with a sophisticated array of
ground-based sensors across Japan, 28 Patriot PAC-3 missile units, and
investment in sea-based missile defense systems. The Japanese Maritime
Self Defense Force currently deploys eight AEGIS vessels capable of
conducting missile defense.

[[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark} is also gradually [[introducing]{.mark}
**more [standoff weapons]{.mark}** into its arsenal]{.underline}. In
offensive terms, [Japan]{.underline} is beginning to shrug off the
legacy of its self-imposed ban on offensive systems with [[R&D]{.mark}
occurring [on **precision strike** and **hypersonic**]{.mark}
capabilities]{.underline} (Japan Ministry of Defense 2019, 12).
[Japan]{.underline} consequently [improved]{.underline} its [[ability to
hold **Chinese**]{.mark} sea-based **[capabilities at
risk]{.mark}**]{.underline} from greater ranges, thereby
[increasing]{.underline} the potential [cost of any Chinese offensive
action]{.underline}. There is also an ongoing debate in
[[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark} about [[developing]{.mark} **longer range
[systems]{.mark}** [that could target]{.mark} adversary assets
in]{.underline} their **[[homeland]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This debate
is largely framed by the threats posed by the DPRK and China, but the
political, technical, and operational hurdles to successfully
operationalizing such an approach have not yet been resolved.

[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}, albeit on a smaller budget, is [similarly
**[upgrading]{.mark}** its existing **[nine Patriot batteries]{.mark}**
to the PAC3 variant]{.underline}. It is, however, still facing a large
deficit in terms of incoming missiles versus interceptors (Calvo 2018).
Consequently, it is also [[developing]{.mark} a series of
**[long-range]{.mark}** strike **[missiles]{.mark}**]{.underline},
including the still-in-development [Yun Feng supersonic cruise
missile]{.underline} with a range of between 1200 and 2000 km [and the
Hsuing Feng IIE subsonic cruise missile]{.underline} with a range
between 600 and 1250 km (Missile Defense Project 2018, 2019). It is
unknown how many of these missiles are or will be deployed, but they
will [provide **Taiwan** with the **[ability to target Chinese]{.mark}
defense [systems]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### Counterforce\-\--SSBNs

#### Weak now.

vis-à-vis China: long-term programs and effects,\" China International
Strategy Review, 2024, Vol. 6, pp. 9-21, Springer. //TL

The development of submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) is one
of the ways in which China can increase the survivability of its nuclear
weapons. If China's nuclear submarines are quiet enough, the United
States would not be able to detect them and, therefore, would not be
able to attack the missiles carried by those submarines in a first
nuclear strike. China could thus improve the credibility of its nuclear
retaliation capability. The problem is that the [U.S. has conducted
anti-submarine warfare (**ASW**) efforts against China for the **past**
couple **decades**]{.underline}. This [long-term U.S. damage limitation
program against China puts **pressure** on the **survivability** of
China's sea-based nuclear force]{.underline}.

[In]{.underline} the field of [[ASW]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [[U.S.
has]{.mark} an [advantage]{.mark} on [both **technical** and
**geographic**]{.mark} levels]{.underline}. First, the survivability of
a submarine depends on its quietness, and U.S. nuclear submarines have a
tremendous advantage over Chinese nuclear submarines. The [two
generations of [Chinese]{.mark} nuclear ballistic missile
[submarines]{.mark}]{.underline} (Type 092 and Type 094) [have large
missile compartment "humps" and food openings]{.underline}, which could
[result in **[higher noise levels]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A [graphic
comparing]{.underline} the [quietness]{.underline} of Chinese and
Russian submarines was included in a report released by the U.S. Office
of Naval Intelligence in 2009. It [shows]{.underline} that while the
[Type 094]{.underline} is quieter than the Type 092, it still [produces
[**more noise** than]{.mark} the [Soviet]{.mark} Delta III]{.underline}
ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) [and Victor III attack
[submarine]{.mark}]{.underline} (SSN) [[from the **Cold War
era**]{.underline}]{.mark} (U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence 2009, 22).
If this data is true, the [survivability of Chinese nuclear submarines
is **worrisome**.]{.underline}

Second, [Chinese submarines entering]{.underline} the [oceans must
[traverse]{.mark} several [**key chokepoints** in the **first**]{.mark}
**[island chain]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which are surrounded by land
under the control of the U.S. and its allies, [making it easy for the
U.S. to [deploy **sensors**]{.mark} to detect submarines
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} deploy **[[anti-submarine
forces]{.underline}]{.mark}**. During the Cold War, the [U.S.
developed]{.underline} the Sound Surveillance System ([**SOSUS**) with
passive acoustic technology to detect discrete]{.underline}, narrowband
[tonals generated by submarines]{.underline}. Previously, Soviet
submarines were very noisy, and the detection range of SOSUS could cover
the entire ocean. As Soviet submarines became quieter, the range of
SOSUS decreased dramatically. Later, the [United States began deploying
the Fixed Distributed System (**FDS**]{.underline}) in key chokepoints.
The FDS [consists of multiple passive sensors]{.underline} in an upward
looking array that have limited coverage but [can **[detect even
extremely quiet submarines]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

There is no doubt that China is working to improve the quiet level of
its submarines, which will decrease the likelihood of detecting and
tracking Chinese submarines by the U.S. The improved version of the 094
submarine, the 094A, was publicly unveiled during a maritime parade held
in the South China Sea in April 2018 (Zhang 2018, 5). China is also
developing a third-generation SSBN, Type 096. The level of submarine
silence will inevitably improve over time. In early 2023, China
reportedly launched a nuclear-powered attack submarine with a pump-jet
propulsion system instead of a propeller. The pump-jet propulsion system
can effectively reduce submarine noise, which is the first application
of this technology on Chinese submarines. The U.S. is concerned that
"the era of unchallenged dominance of the U.S. under the seas around
China is ending." (Gale 2023).

As Chinese submarines have become quieter, the [[U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}, mirroring its past efforts against Soviet
submarines, has begun to [work with allies to [build an
**underwater**]{.mark} **surveillance [network]{.mark}** against
China]{.underline} (Ball 2015, 51--54). [In addition to]{.underline} the
fixed [**[SOSUS]{.mark}** and **[FDS]{.mark}**]{.underline} arrays, this
[system includes]{.underline} the [**[S]{.mark}**urveillance
**[T]{.mark}**owed **[A]{.mark}**rray **[S]{.mark}**ensor
**[S]{.mark}**ystem]{.underline}, which can be carried by military or
civilian vessels [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the Transformational
Reliable Acoustic Path System ([**[TRAPS]{.mark}**), which can be placed
on the seafloor]{.underline} in hostile waters [and [used to **monitor
submarines**]{.mark}]{.underline} passing above them (Brock 2023). In
future, when Chinese submarines become quieter, the U.S. will lose the
ability to locate Chinese submarines from long distances, but FDS and
TRAPS will still be able to detect Chinese submarines that are
traversing over the sensors.

[China]{.underline} is also [developing a nuclear powered at-sea
deterrent]{.underline}. This is an extra leg to its second-strike
capability. China's [development]{.underline} of this capability is
[still in its **formative** stages]{.underline}, and faces [[several
**operational problems**]{.underline}]{.mark}. First, Chinese
[[SSBN's]{.underline}]{.mark} (nuclear-powered ballistic missile
submarines) are reportedly [still]{.underline} relatively
[**[noisy]{.mark}** and [**vulnerable** to
interception]{.mark}]{.underline}, although as the country's
technological prowess develops this weakness will be mitigated
(Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy 2018). Second, [China has
**[no natural bastion]{.mark}**]{.underline} for the operation of its
SSBN fleet. In particular, [access routes to the Pacific are difficult
to traverse]{.underline} without detection, as the [Chinese vessels
[must transit through]{.mark} **Japanese-and [US-controlled choke
points]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Instead, there is data that China's
emphasis on controlling the South China Sea is in part driven by the
need to create a protected patrol area where its SSBN fleet could
securely operate (Bowers and Kirchberger 2021, 628--629).

### Counterforce\-\--Mobile ICBMs

#### We can track them.

Bin **Li &** Riqiang **Wu 24**, PhD, Professor, Tsinghua University,
Board of Directors, China Arms Control and Disarmament Association; PhD,
Professor, Tsinghua University, Research Fellow, Belfer Center for

vis-à-vis China: long-term programs and effects,\" China International
Strategy Review, 2024, Vol. 6, pp. 9-21, Springer. //TL

[China]{.underline} has [spent]{.underline} a couple of [decades
developing and deploying its mobile ICBMs]{.underline}. The
[[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has]{.underline} spent about the same
amount of time trying to [[build]{.mark} a [**space-based capability**,
called]{.mark} the]{.underline} Ground Moving Target Indicator
([**[GMTI]{.mark}**), to **[track mobile targets]{.mark}**]{.underline}
on the ground. It launched its first space-based GMTI program, the
Discoverer II, in 1998 (GlobalSecurity 2011) and [recently [**committed
to renewing** this]{.mark} effort]{.underline} (Hudson and Trimble
2021). Unlike the space-based infrared and optical sensors, which could
be shielded by clouds, a U.S. space-based GMTI [system]{.underline}
could in principle [provide [**real-time tracking** of]{.mark} Chinese
[mobile missiles]{.mark}, thus **[reducing]{.mark}** their
**[survivability]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is [another form of
competition between U.S. damage limitation and Chinese nuclear
retaliation]{.underline} capability.

A GMTI system consists of elevated Doppler radars that send radar beams
to ground targets. The frequency of the radar beams reflected from
moving targets with non-zero radial speed changes, while the frequency
of radar beams reflected from stationary targets remain the same as
original. If the system screens out a radar beam with an unchanged
frequency from stationary ground targets, it can highlight moving
targets with non-zero radial targets. A radar system operated in this
way is called a GMTI or a surface moving target indicator (SMTI).

The Doppler radars operated in GMTI mode can be carried by airplanes and
satellites. Airborne GMTI radars are technically more mature but they
may have to invade the airspace of rival countries and would potentially
need to contend with their air defense. So, space-based GMTI radars are
more useful in peacetime and for strategic purposes. This paper only
discusses the GMTI that are related to space-based systems.

According to the designs proposed around 2000s, about twenty or so GMTI
satellites would be deployed on low earth orbit, for example, at an
altitude of 1000 km. Each satellite carries a GMTI radar. The maximum
detectable range of a GMTI radar is 2800 km for a moving target with a
radar cross-section (RCS) of 10 square meters. Apparently, this
requirement is aimed at tracking big vehicles, for example, the
Transporter-Erector-Launchers (TELs) that carry mobile missiles. If a
GMTI radar detects a moving mobile missile on the ground, it could track
the target for more than ten minutes until its hands over the monitoring
task to another GMTI radar. A GMTI system in this constellation could
cover most of the earth's surface, with the exception of two poles (Li
2007)

The space-based GMTI involves some very challenging technologies, for
example, a radar on low earth orbit may need a very large antenna. The
United States has not been successful in deploying a space-based GMTI so
it has to rely on air-based GMTI to track moving targets on the ground.
However, the [United States recently explored [**new ventures** to
build]{.mark} a space-based [system]{.mark}]{.underline}. Some [U.S.
[military and intelligent organizations]{.mark}]{.underline}, including
the Space Force, Indo-Pacific Command, Air Force, National
Reconnaissance Office, are **[[working on the
system]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A [prototype radar may be [launched in
**around a year**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Albon 2023; Hudson and Trimble
2021).

The U.S. [space-based **[GMTI system]{.mark}**]{.underline} aims to
[[provide **real-time tracking**]{.mark} of mobile
missiles]{.underline}. If successfully deployed, the [Chinese **[mobile
ICBMs]{.mark}** would be [at **risk of exposure**]{.mark} to the U.S.
GMTI system and their **[survivability]{.mark}** would be
**[threatened]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### War Inevitable?

#### Taiwan will go nuclear in the future.

//TL

This represents an important departure from China's traditional nuclear
thinking. [For decades, China seemed to believe that a conventional
conflict]{.underline} was extremely [unlikely to escalate to the nuclear
level,]{.underline} but once the nuclear threshold was crossed, it would
be extremely hard to control its further escalation and a low-level
nuclear conflict would quickly escalate all the way to an all-out
nuclear exchange.108 However, [Chinese [strategists]{.mark} appear to
have [developed **serious doubts**]{.mark} about both elements of its
traditional belief]{.underline} and have become [[**more interested** in
escalation]{.underline}]{.mark} management capabilities.

If Beijing seriously pursues escalation management capabilities, this
will have the most profound impact on China's nuclear strategy and
U.S.-China nuclear relations in decades. [The [specific]{.mark}
escalation management [capabilities]{.mark} required by China are
[influenced]{.mark} by how high it is willing to **climb** the
escalation **ladder**]{.underline}---and [hence [how much of a **risk of
an all out nuclear war** it is willing to
run]{.mark}]{.underline}---should the United States escalate by
increasing the intensity or range of its nuclear attacks. Arguably,
increasingly accurate Chinese theater-range nuclear missiles---such as
DF-21 and DF-26, which are also more maneuverable and effective at
penetrating U.S. missile defenses than their predecessors---could be
useful for escalation management. To advance further,
[China]{.underline} might want to [acquire **[longer-range]{.mark}
nuclear [systems]{.mark}** that are very accurate and effective at
defeating missile defenses so that it could **[credibly
threaten]{.mark}** limited retaliations against more [**distant
targets** such as]{.mark} Hawaii and [the **continental United
States**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

China was able to maintain a small arsenal for decades because a basic
second-strike capability against the U.S. homeland was relatively easy
to build and not particularly sensitive to the evolving size,
composition, or targeting strategy of U.S. nuclear forces.109 But if
[the new Chinese term of "**strategic** deterrent and **control**" for
nuclear weapons indicates a shift toward **acquiring escalation
management** capabilities, the planning of]{.underline} China's
[**nuclear development** and **employment strategy** will become
significantly **more complex**]{.underline}. In fact, it will become
much more difficult for Chinese strategists to assess how many nuclear
weapons China needs because this will depend on their assessment of the
precise details of Washington's nuclear strategy.

To further complicate the situation, [[Washington]{.underline}]{.mark}
is [likely to [suspect]{.mark} that China's development of escalation
management capabilities reflects Beijing's growing **[intent]{.mark}**
to **[use nuclear weapons first]{.mark}**]{.underline}---perhaps in a
limited manner---in a future conflict.110 The [United States may respond
by **[enhancing]{.mark}** its **[damage-limitation
capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline} with the goal of eliminating
remaining Chinese nuclear forces should China use nuclear weapons first.
However, [to Chinese nuclear strategists, enhanced U.S. damage
limitation capabilities could also be [**used** in]{.mark} a
**[preemptive]{.mark}** disarming **[strike]{.mark}**]{.underline}
against China and undermine the overall credibility of China's
deterrent. [In such circumstances, [China]{.mark} would be
[concerned]{.mark} that a [more confident U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
would be more likely to [initiate]{.mark} a **[limited]{.mark} nuclear
[attack]{.mark}**, thereby **[intensifying]{.mark}** China's
**[resolve]{.mark}** to further develop]{.underline} escalation
management [capabilities]{.underline}.

#### Buildup makes conflict inevitable.

Crucially, the [Chinese leadership expects]{.underline} that an
[expanded]{.underline} nuclear [arsenal will prompt Washington to adopt
a more conciliatory approach]{.underline} toward Beijing in nonmilitary
realms. However, the [logic]{.underline} underpinning this expectation
remains [ill-defined]{.underline} and is often seen by American
strategists as lacking empirical evidence. American experts are often
puzzled over how, either theoretically or practically, a larger Chinese
nuclear arsenal could compel Washington to dial down efforts to
economically contain China or to halt political warfare that might
jeopardize China's regime security.116 It could be argued that during
the Cold War, nuclear weapons helped deter direct military
confrontations between Washington and Moscow, yet they did not avert
proxy wars between the two, nor did they stop political confrontation or
economic sanctions, which over time contributed to stresses on the
Soviet system and ultimately hastened its collapse.

[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} still does [[not see a]{.mark} clear
[boundary between **military**]{.mark}]{.underline} conflicts [and
**nonmilitary**]{.underline} confrontations. To Beijing, a [rising risk
of **military conflict** can compel]{.underline} its
[adversary]{.underline} to [ramp down political
confrontations]{.underline}. On the issue of Taiwan, for example,
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} could [**[drive up]{.mark} military
[tensions]{.mark}** [over]{.mark} the [Taiwan]{.mark} Strait, which
could force the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [to]{.mark}
[moderate]{.mark} its political [positions and]{.mark} take measures
such as [reduc]{.mark}ing [visits]{.mark}]{.underline} by senior U.S.
officials to Taiwan or pressuring the Taiwanese government to avoid
causing political "troubles."117

There are [other ways for Beijing to **[forcibly link military]{.mark}**
confrontations [**with nonmilitary** issues]{.mark}]{.underline} and
[[leverage]{.underline}]{.mark} its military---or even
[[nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[capability]{.mark} to tame
nonmilitary behaviors]{.underline} of Washington. For instance,
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} could [[**retaliate** against]{.mark}
**perceived** [political **attacks**]{.mark}]{.underline} against its
regime [by [stepping up]{.mark}]{.underline} military
[[activities]{.underline}]{.mark} along its periphery. This could be
done by conducting aggressive interceptions of U.S. military aircraft
and ships in areas near China or pushing forward Chinese military
presence in areas disputed between China and U.S. regional allies.
[Beijing could]{.underline} also [demand]{.underline} that
[Washington]{.underline} [reduce]{.underline} perceived
[attacks]{.underline} against its political or economic system [before
it agrees to join arms control talks.]{.underline}

Seeing China as pursuing purely defensive objectives, the Science of
Military Strategy implies that it is just and legitimate for China to
use "strategic deterrence" capabilities to safeguard "development
interests" and maintain a stable internal environment, among other
things.118 Highlighting the importance of "the flexibility of the use of
deterrence," the document also asserts that "when national territorial
sovereignty is violated, national unity is challenged, and national
development interests are threatened, our country has the right to use
military means at any time, and it can carry out active and effective
strategic deterrence to obtain a military advantage."119 This
[broad]{.underline} [description of [circumstances under which
China]{.mark} can **[leverage]{.mark}**]{.underline} its strategic
[deterrence [capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} [leaves room]{.underline}
for China [to [**blur the line** between **military and nonmilitary**
confrontations]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In this light, [China views the **advancement** of its **nuclear
capabilities** as contributing to political stability]{.underline}---a
logic that underpins the PLA Rocket Force's strategic counterbalance
mission but that has not been explicitly elaborated. The [**absence of**
explicit articulation and **in-depth** internal **discussions** of this
rationale casts doubt on]{.underline} the [effectiveness]{.underline} of
achieving political stability by expanding China's strategic military
capabilities. Furthermore, the [goal of bolstering political stability
is inherently **nebulous**, complicating]{.underline} the establishment
of operational benchmarks for assessing nuclear sufficiency compared to
more tangible military aims like ensuring second strike capability. This
ambiguity complicates **[efforts]{.underline}** [to **curb** excessive
**nuclear investment**.]{.underline}

Conclusion

Graham Allison has coined [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} term
**["[Thucydides trap]{.mark}"]{.underline}** to [refer to]{.underline}
the well-known phenomenon in which [shifting power [promotes
**preventive war**]{.mark} between rising and declining
states]{.underline}. The conventional wisdom in IR holds that
[[when]{.mark} [the declining state is **uncertain** about]{.mark} the
[riser's **intentions**]{.mark}, power shifts can produce **preventive
war** even between rational rising and declining states with compatible
goals, due to rational-but-misplaced fear. This]{.underline}
characterization of the Thucydides trap [implies that [there are]{.mark}
strong [rational incentives]{.mark} for [war]{.mark} or]{.underline}
intense cold war-style [competition [between a declining
**U**]{.mark}]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} a rising [**[China]{.mark}**, even if China's
intentions]{.underline} regarding the international order [are actually
benign]{.underline} from a US perspective.

This paper has argued that in fact the Thucydides trap does not produce
rational preventive war or severe competition under high uncertainty.
Rather, even under very large power shifts, these outcomes only
rationally occurs when the declining state is confident that the rising
state's intentions are truly hostile. This is because benign rising
states can send cooperative signals that are sufficiently credible to
convince a rational decliner not to escalate to full-scale containment
or war. Rather, the declining state can adopt a hedging strategy of
limited containment, which reduces incentives for hostile rising states
to misrepresent their intentions. This, in turn, lends credibility to
rising states' cooperative behavior, and allows the decliner to at least
partially update its beliefs that the riser is truly benign. Thus,
although a limited degree of competition may be unavoidable under large
power shifts, such competition elicits information that allows rational
states with compatible goals to avoid escalation to full-scale
containment or preventive war.

Unfortunately, this argument does not preclude the possibility that
[[the Thucydides trap]{.mark} could [befall the US and
China]{.mark}]{.underline} in reality, when the assumptions of the
theory are relaxed. First, [it is possible]{.underline} that [[China's
**goals**]{.underline}]{.mark} really [[are **incompatible**]{.mark}
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} those of [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[it]{.mark} will [attempt extensive **revision**]{.mark}]{.underline}
of the international order in the future. [This could cause preventive
war due to the commitment problem]{.underline} under the combination of
shifting power and complete information that China's intentions are
hostile. Based on China's behavior to date, such information is not
available.

Secondly, however, [[even if China's intentions are]{.mark} truly
[benign, preventive]{.mark} war [could]{.mark} still [occur due
to]{.mark} irrationally **[pessimistic American beliefs]{.mark}**.
[American observers]{.mark} have [shown]{.mark} themselves [to be
**sub-rational**]{.mark}]{.underline} in their assessments of the
credibility of China's foreign policy signals and their belief formation
[about China's likely intentions]{.underline}. Most recently, [many
American scholars and policymakers have formed unjustifiably confident
beliefs that China's intentions are hostile]{.underline} to the US,
[[including]{.mark} most (if not all)]{.underline} officials [[within
the **Trump**]{.mark} [administration]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Consequently, [[the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates has now [begun to [implement]{.mark}
policies of **[economic]{.mark} [containment]{.mark}**]{.underline}
toward China in response to these beliefs. [This hedging strategy should
lend considerable credibility to China's cooperative
signals]{.underline} regarding the broader international economic and
institutional order, which it has continued to support. [Yet it seems
likely that the [Trump]{.mark} administration would **[fail to
update]{.mark} its [beliefs]{.mark}**]{.underline} even in the event
that China continues its general cooperation within the existing
international order. As Allison \[1\] points out, [given such
[**intractably pessimistic** beliefs]{.mark} about Chinese intentions,
it is not difficult to imagine **[escalating]{.mark}** economic and
[**military tensions** resulting in conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet
this would not be the rational and tragic result of the structural
incentives of the international system, as the conventional wisdom
holds, [but rather of errors on the part of national
policymakers]{.underline}.

#### War inevitable

is inevitable unless the U.S. changes course, Beijing's new foreign
minister warns,\" NBC News,
https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/conflict-china-us-inevitable-new-foreign-minister-warns-rcna73705\]

[[Chinese]{.mark} Foreign Minister]{.underline} Qin Gang's fiery
comments [[underlined]{.mark} the [**deepening tensions**
between]{.mark} the world's two **[largest economies]{.mark}** in the
wake of the surveillance balloon]{.underline} saga [and Russia's
war]{.underline} in Ukraine.

[They echoed]{.underline} similarly [[sharp remarks]{.underline}]{.mark}
Monday [[by]{.underline}]{.mark} China's
leader, [[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark} Jinping, [[blaming U.S.]{.mark}
efforts to contain China [for **deteriorating
relations**]{.mark}]{.underline} and suggesting Beijing would
increasingly seek to push back.

Qin spoke at a news conference in Beijing, his first since he took
office in December, on the sidelines of the annual meeting of China's
rubber-stamp legislature, where Xi is expected to complete the biggest
government reshuffle in a decade.

[In a wide-ranging **rebuke** of U.S. policies, Qin]{.underline} --- who
until recently was the Chinese ambassador to the U.S. ---
[[questioned]{.underline}]{.mark} President Joe Biden's [[assertion that
the U.S. seeks competition]{.underline}]{.mark} with China [[but not
**conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

"In fact, [the [U.S]{.mark}]{.underline}. side's so-called [[competition
is]{.mark} all-round **[containment]{.mark}** and [**suppression**, a
**zero-sum game**]{.mark}]{.underline}," he said, suggesting
**[[conflict may be unavoidable]{.underline}]{.mark}** unless Washington
stops trying to suppress Beijing.

"The U.S. side supposedly wants to put 'guardrails' on Sino-U.S.
relations and not to clash," Qin continued. "In fact, it wants China not
to respond in words or action when slandered or attacked. That is just
impossible.

"[[If the U.S]{.mark}. side does not put on the brakes and [continues
down the **wrong path**, no amount of]{.mark} [guardrails]{.mark} can
[stop]{.mark} the derailment]{.underline} and rollover [into
[**confrontation** and **conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline}," he said.

In a speech to political delegates Monday, Xi also accused the U.S. of
trying to fence China in.

"[[Western countries]{.underline}]{.mark} led by the United States [have
[implemented]{.mark}]{.underline} all-round [containment,
[**encirclement**]{.mark} and **suppression**]{.underline} of China,
which has [[brought]{.mark} unprecedented **[severe challenges]{.mark}**
to our country's development]{.underline}," he said, according to
Xinhua, China's state-run news agency.

Qin also [criticized Washington's decision]{.underline} early last month
[to shoot down a suspected Chinese spy balloon]{.underline} off South
Carolina, repeating Beijing's insistence that it appeared over U.S.
territory by accident.

"The U.S. side violated the spirit of international law and
international practice by making presumptions of guilt, overreacting,
abusing force and making use of the issue to create a diplomatic crisis
that could have been avoided," he said.

Of Taiwan, the self-ruling island that Beijing claims as its territory,
Qin said it was the first red line in China's relations with the U.S.,
which is Taiwan's most important international backer.

"[[The U.S. bears **unshirkable responsibility** for]{.mark} the
creation of the **[Taiwan]{.mark}** issue]{.underline}," he said.

Qin said [the U.S]{.underline}. had [disrespected China's sovereignty
and territorial integrity]{.underline} by providing defensive weapons to
the island, which Beijing has said it could take by force if necessary.

He also denied U.S. allegations that China is considering providing
Moscow with ammunition and artillery to aid its fight against Ukraine.

The U.S. has warned China not to supply arms to Russia for its war.
China and Russia declared a "no limits" partnership weeks before Russia
invaded Ukraine a year ago, and China has tried to appear neutral in the
conflict, refraining from condemning Russian aggression or even calling
it an invasion.

Qin said Tuesday that China-Russia relations "must move steadily
forward" as the world becomes more turbulent.

"China is neither the creator of the crisis nor a party to it, nor has
it provided weapons to any party to the conflict, so why should China be
blamed, sanctioned, pressured or even threatened?" Qin said.

He repeated calls for a negotiated solution to the Ukraine conflict.
Western officials quickly dismissed a 12-point peace proposal that
Beijing issued last month as too favorable to Russia.

"[[It is regrettable that]{.mark} efforts to persuade and promote
[**talks** have been **undermined**]{.mark}]{.underline}," Qin said,
"[as if [an]{.mark} [**invisible hand** is pushing]{.mark} the
[conflict]{.mark} to **escalate**]{.underline}, taking advantage of the
Ukrainian crisis to achieve certain geopolitical intentions."

#### China and Xi are primed for war\-\--it's inevitable.

one can stop China's 'reunification' with Taiwan,\" Reuters,
https://www.reuters.com/world/china/xi-says-no-one-can-stop-chinas-reunification-with-taiwan-2024-12-31/\]

BEIJING, Dec 31 (Reuters) - [**No one can stop** China\'s
\"reunification\" with Taiwan]{.underline}, Chinese President
[Xi]{.underline} Jinping said in his New Year\'s speech on Tuesday,
[laying down a **clear warning** to what Beijing regards as
pro-independence forces]{.underline} within and outside of the island of
23 million people.

In the past year, [Beijing has stepped up **military pressure** near
Taiwan, sending warships and planes almost daily]{.underline} into the
waters and air space around the island [in what Taiwanese officials view
as a creeping effort to \"normalise\" China\'s military
presence]{.underline}.

[China regards democratically-governed Taiwan as **its own territory**.
But Taiwan\'s government rejects Beijing\'s claims]{.underline} and says
only its people can decide their future and Beijing ought to respect the
choice of the Taiwanese people.

\"The people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are one family. No one
can sever our family bonds, and no one can stop the historical trend of
national reunification,\" Xi said in a speech televised on China\'s
state broadcaster CCTV.

In his New Year\'s speech last year, [Xi said China\'s
\"**reunification**\" with Taiwan is **inevitable**]{.underline}, and
that people on both sides \"should be bound by a common sense of purpose
and share in the glory of the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.\"

[**Tensions** have remained **high** throughout the year in the
sensitive Taiwan Strait]{.underline}, especially after Lai Ching-te,
deemed a \"separatist\" by Beijing, became the island\'s latest
president in May.

Earlier this month, [China staged a large **massing of naval
forces**]{.underline} around Taiwan and in the East and South China Seas
after Lai stopped over in Hawaii and the U.S. territory of Guam on a
Pacific trip criticised by Beijing.

[China]{.underline}, which [never renounced the use of
force]{.underline} to bring Taiwan under its control, [conducted two
rounds of **war games**]{.underline} around the island this year,
[saying they were warnings against \"separatist acts\"]{.underline} and
[**vowed** to take **further actions**]{.underline} if needed.

[The complete **reunification** of China is **inevitable**,
and]{.underline} seeking \"[**Taiwan independence**\" through foreign
support is doomed to failure]{.underline}, Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesperson Mao Ning said on Monday.

The spokesperson made the remarks at a daily press briefing when asked
to comment on Taiwan\'s Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities\'
plan to promote the establishment of new institutions in certain
countries and use \"Taiwan\" instead of \"Taipei\" to name these
institutions.

Mao said that [the **one-China** principle is a **universally
recognized** norm governing international relations and a consensus in
the international community]{.underline}, and it serves as China\'s
political foundation to establish and develop relations with other
countries.

\"[The]{.underline} government of the **[P]{.underline}**eople\'s
**[R]{.underline}**epublic of **[C]{.underline}**hina [is the only
legitimate government]{.underline} [representing the whole of China.
Taiwan has never been a country]{.underline}. It never was, and never
will be,\" the spokesperson said.

For some time, under the guise of exchange and cooperation in the fields
of economy, trade, science, technology, culture and education, [DPP
authorities have been trying to break the international community\'s
adherence to the one-China]{.underline} principle and expand the
so-called international space by attempting to establish new
institutions in certain countries or rename existing ones, she said.

[Mao warned the DPP authorities that the complete **reunification** of
the country is **inevitable**]{.underline} and that seeking \"[Taiwan
independence]{.underline}\" through foreign support [is **doomed to
failure**]{.underline}.

\"[China always firmly opposes any form of official exchange between
Taiwan authorities and any country]{.underline} that has diplomatic
relations with China,\" Mao said.

A Renegade Province Awaiting Reunification

[The]{.underline} People's Republic of China ([PRC]{.underline})
[regards Taiwan as a "renegade province **awaiting
reunification**]{.underline}". [It has increased diplomatic and military
pressure to stifle]{.underline} the latter's [efforts to seek
recognition as an independent state]{.underline}. Recently, Chinese
President [Xi]{.underline} Jinping resolutely [declared that "realising
China's complete reunification is]{.underline} \[...\] [a historic
mission and an **unshakable commitment**]{.underline}".\[1\] Despite the
PRC's increasingly dominant position in the regional security
architecture, the U.S.' continued engagement in the Indo-Pacific
impresses the idea that [**all-out war** may be
**avoidable**]{.underline}.

Fanning Flames of Conflict

[The PRC's **increasingly aggressive rhetoric** regarding reunification
with Taiwan could foreshadow an impending military
operation]{.underline}. It is commonly accepted that shared national
ideals, under a common historical narrative, unite a nation. Although
the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has never ruled Taiwan, [it
claims]{.underline} to have "**[historical and cultural
ties]{.underline}**" with the latter, dating back to 230 AD.\[2\] As
Hobsbawm (1996) observes, [nationalists tend to "**reinvent the
past**".\[]{.underline}3\] Though the CCP's narrative is somewhat
flawed, [it has been able to mobilise the masses for its
cause]{.underline} through effective propaganda.\[4\] This is
exemplified through national songs, where the defence of the homeland is
a recurring theme: territorial integrity and its salvation, or
maintenance, are crucial.

Although the Chinese Communist Party has never ruled Taiwan, it claims
to have "historical and cultural ties" with the latter, dating back to
230 AD.

Territory is "central to nationalism".\[6\] [The CCP views the
occupation of Taiwan]{.underline} (in parts or as a whole) [as a means
to maintain its credibility]{.underline}. However, the assertion of
nationalism requires suppressing other claims on the same
territory---the self-determination of the Taiwanese. Consequently,
[**conflict** seems **unavoidable**]{.underline}.

\<\<Text Condensed, None Omitted\>\>

China's "Trump Card"¶ While the CCP's narrative provides the
intellectual basis for invasion, the physical impetus lies in the PRC's
meteoric rise in the economic and political domains. PRC's
implementation of economic reforms in the 1970s paved the way for its
international recognition and admission into various supranational
bodies. Notably, the PRC was appointed a permanent member of the United
Nations Security Council (UNSC) in 1971.\[7\] Thus, it can veto legally
binding resolutions passed in the United Nations General Assembly.\[8\]
An onslaught on Taiwanese territory would be an infringement of the
United Nations Charter 2(4), which calls for swift and decisive action
by the UNSC. However, the PRC would be able to impede any
disadvantageous resolution. In doing so, it would buy itself time to
achieve its military objectives. In fact, the PRC could utilise UN
Resolution 2758, which advocates the "One China Policy", recognising it
as the "only legitimate government of China".\[9\] This throws a spanner
in the works should the international community attempt to utilise the
United Nations Charter 2(4), which prohibits the infringement of
"territorial integrity of a state" by force.\[10\]¶ The PRC's vast
diplomatic network is further augmented with its Belt and Road
Initiative---"investments" aimed at connecting the PRC with Europe,
Asia, and Africa through a labyrinth of overland infrastructure and
maritime routes.\[11\] The economic growth experienced by recipient
states reinforces positive sentiments towards the PRC. This quid pro quo
prevents the PRC from being sidelined by Western-led economic sanctions
during a conflict. Furthermore, Chinese loans are usually unsustainable
for recipient states,\[12\] embroiling them in debt traps. The PRC
impinges on their sovereignty to further its interests by compelling
recipient states to restructure debts. Amidst a likely global boycott of
Chinese goods during an invasion of Taiwan, the PRC's foothold in these
states will serve as an economic lifeline. The seizure of infrastructure
as collateral may even provide strategic military outposts for the PRC.¶
The PRC's vast diplomatic network is further augmented with its Belt and
Road Initiative---"investments" aimed at connecting the PRC with Europe,
Asia, and Africa.¶ Geoeconomic Strategy with Geopolitical Implications¶
Notably, the PRC's seizure of Hambantota Port (Sri Lanka),\[13\] as well
as the funding and usage of Ream Naval Base (Cambodia)\[14\] disrupts
the U.S.' Island Chain Strategy---a barrier of islands providing a
security buffer between China and the Western Pacific.¶ The PRC could
station warships and listening posts nearer to U.S. assets operating in
the Indo-Pacific region. During a possible Chinese amphibious assault on
Taiwan, it can respond faster and more robustly to any perceived U.S.
threat. Beyond strategic advantages, undermining the U.S.' Island Chain
Strategy demonstrates the PRC's willingness to compete with the U.S.
militarily and strategically. It lays the foundation for the PRC to
establish a multipolar region.¶ Controlling the aforementioned ports is
part of the PRC's plan to create "strings of pearl"---the seizure of
regional chokepoints in the Indo-Pacific region.\[16\] While the
strategy was meant to establish trade routes, the possibility that the
PRC could use them for geostrategic purposes remains.\[17\] It is
undeniable that the combined economic output of the U.S. and its allies
(Japan and the Republic of Korea), coupled with regionals "minilaterals"
(AUKUS, QUAD and I2U2), far exceeds the PRC. However, the above states
leverage maritime trade routes to keep their economies running. While
the PRC does not seek to compete economically, this provides a basis for
a U.S.-led alliance to engage the PRC, even in times of contingency. By
keeping communication channels open with its biggest competitor (and
possible adversary), the PRC can be kept in the loop of the U.S. posture
towards different types of military actions towards Taiwan. Hence, it is
likely that the PRC would make calculated moves in a bid to realise its
reunification aspirations.¶ The PRC's Achilles' Heel¶ However, the PRC's
military weaknesses heighten the risks of an amphibious assault on
Taiwan. As such, an all-out conflict is unlikely to occur in the short
term. The PRC needs to possess military superiority vis-a-vis the U.S, (
and possibly her allies) to impose its will on the latter's First Island
Chain\[18\]. However, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) adopts a rigid
top-down approach, undermining its flexibility when deploying ground
forces.\[19\] The PLA's Command and Control weaknesses are further
aggravated by rampant corruption within its ranks. Recently, President
Xi expelled nine military officials from parliament, including top
commanders from the Rocket Force and Air Force.\[20\] As the PLA is
preoccupied with its internal "clean-up", it is unlikely to be in a
combat posture. In terms of technology, the weapons and
intelligence-gathering capabilities employed by the U.S. Army and its
allies far supersede the PRC's.\[21\] Leveraging on its
intelligence-sharing agreements with Taiwan, the U.S. can tip off its
ally of an impending PRC attack. Such cooperation, if timely, will
likely thwart the PRC's plans and attrite its forces early in a
conflict.\[22\]¶ The PLA's Command and Control weaknesses are further
aggravated by rampant corruption within its ranks.¶ Should an amphibious
landing ensue, the PRC will likely be blunted by limited amphibious
transport capabilities, inefficient logistics and Command and Control
systems.\[23\] As the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is ostensibly the
armed apparatus of the CCP, not the state,\[24\] its political longevity
hinges on the perceived capabilities to deliver a decisive victory as
expounded in its national narratives. Due to the uncertain outcomes, the
PLA is unlikely to project its forces across the Taiwan Straits.¶ Taiwan
has also explored the potential of asymmetric warfare to exploit the
PRC's military weaknesses. Asymmetric measures refer to a spectrum of
overt and covert activities designed to support \[the accomplishment\]
of national political-military objectives".\[25\] Recently, Taiwan and
the US have discussed the possibility of establishing a "contingency
stockpile" of munitions in Taiwan.\[26\] Moreover, Civil Defence and
First Aid Training classes have been gaining popularity at the
grassroots level.\[27\] With robust Humanitarian Civil-Military
Cooperation (CIMIC), Taiwan will likely demonstrate robust resistance.
Even if the PLA were to overrun the island's defences, it would be a
Sisyphean challenge to win the hearts and minds of the populace.¶ A
Region's Conviction¶ The PRC's military weakness is contrasted with the
U.S.' robust military commitment in the Indo-Pacific region, preventing
an all-out conflict between Taiwan and the PRC. The U.S. has strategic
defence alliances with numerous Indo-Pacific littoral states,\[28\]
allowing its military assets to be stationed on foreign soil overlooking
the Taiwan Straits.¶ Notably, the U.S. access to foreign aerodromes and
wharves in Korea, Japan, and the Philippines has allowed it to deploy
strategic assets, including nuclear-powered submarines, aircraft
carriers, and strategic bombers, to the region periodically.\[30\] These
deployments can be seen as a political virtue signal to reaffirm the
U.S. commitment to the region's collective security. With the forward
deployment of military assets, the U.S. can project its forces quickly
during a contingency to safeguard its extrajudicial interests, which
ostensibly includes limiting the Chinese sphere of influence. Its robust
deployment includes leveraging multiple bases (sometimes within the same
state) surrounding the possible theatre of conflict---the Taiwan
Straits. As such, it is difficult for potential adversaries to preempt
the deployment or movement of its military assets. Coupled with the U.S.
stance of strategic ambiguity, its Indo-Pacific presence serves as a
credible deterrence against any Chinese onslaught, at least in the near
future.¶ Means Of Deterrence¶ To reinforce its position as a guarantor
of regional peace and security, the U.S. has spearheaded regional
security cooperations---much to the PRC's chagrin. The Australia, United
Kingdom and United States (AUKUS) strategic defence partnership paves
the way for the Australian Navy to acquire American nuclear-capable
submarines,\[31\] posing a significant deterrence to the PLA Navy. The
Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD) promotes maritime cooperation
between India, Japan, Australia and America. Recently, the scope of
cooperation was expanded to include "de-risking" supply chains.\[32\] ¶
These concepts create an "us versus them" dichotomy, where the U.S. and
its allies collectively face an increasingly assertive PRC and prevent
it from achieving its regional aims. Undermining the PRC's monopoly in
strategic goods shifts the economic balance of power away from the
Chinese. To compel the PRC to abandon its military adventurism, it will
likely be slapped with economic sanctions by the West. Therefore, it is
prudent for the West to reduce its reliance on the PRC to prevent the
latter from holding it hostage.¶ To compel the PRC to abandon its
military adventurism, it will likely be slapped with economic sanctions
by the West.¶ Preventing collateral social-economic damage due to a
Taiwan contingency is equally essential. As such, with a continued U.S.
Indo-Pacific presence, regional states are reassured that the region's
security architecture remains status quo.¶ A Double-Edged Sword¶ Due to
its comparative economic and military weaknesses vis-à-vis the U.S. and
its allies, the PRC has resorted to grey zone tactics. In this sense,
"grey zone" infers use of "all means, including armed force or non-armed
force, military and non-military, and lethal and non-lethal means to
compel the enemy to accept one's interests".\[33\] To wear out the
Taiwanese military, the PRC has resorted to almost daily incursions of
Taiwan's Air Defence Identification Zone (ADIZ) and the Median Line of
the Taiwan Straits to signal its displeasure towards the incumbent
Democratic Progressive Party's increasingly pro-independence
stance.\[34\] In August 2022, the PRC launched unprecedented military
drills during U.S. House Speaker Pelosi's visit to Taiwan, including the
launching of ballistic missiles over Taipei and a simulated blockade of
the island.\[35\]¶ While Chinese military manoeuvres are ostensibly a
rehearsal for a blockade of Taiwan, staging military drills in the South
China Sea is legal under the United Nations Convention of the Law of the
Sea (UNCLOS). China has not contravened the UNCLOS even when its
warships infringed upon Taiwan's EEZ. \[37\] However, the PRC seems to
be exploiting the fact that Taiwan is not an internationally recognised
state under the Montevideo Convention on the Rights and Duties of the
State.\[38\] With the legitimacy of Taiwan's ADIZ already in question,
it will be an uphill battle to lodge legal or diplomatic proceedings
against the PRC's hostile undertakings. Such incursions will eventually
be normalised when/if Taiwan's supposed diplomatic protests go unheard.
This may embolden the PRC to launch more intrusive military drills,
culminating in an invasion of Taiwan.¶ A Slippery Slope into Conflict¶
Taiwan's reaction has been decisive despite a rise in Chinese "grey
zone" tactics. This could be attributed to its inability to leverage
international conventions and supranational bodies to protect its
interests.¶ For the first time in six decades, Taiwan fired at a drone
infringing its sovereignty over the Kinmen islands.\[39\] While the
origin of this drone was unknown, it could ostensibly be flown by the
PLA, given the high tensions between the warring parties over Pelosi's
visit to Taiwan in August 2022 \[40\]. ¶ Given its military weaknesses,
it is plausible that the PRC is evaluating Taiwan's response to aerial
and coastal threats. Notably, the PRC infringed Taiwan's ADIZ near
Taiwan and Kaohsiung. These major cities will likely be heavily defended
during a crisis. Hence, the frequent military drills may be a means to
an end. The PRC's strategic texts teach the importance of deception
because it allows it to inhibit its opponents from "fully converting
latent into kinetic strength", diminishing an opponent's "power of
resistance".\[41\] Apart from wearing the Taiwanese military out, the
PRC's modus operandi could be a Trojan Horse for a surprise attack. ¶
Given its military weaknesses, it is plausible that the PRC is
evaluating Taiwan's response to aerial and coastal threats.¶ Epilogue

\<\<Paragraph Integrity Resumes\>\>

Given Chinese military weaknesses juxtaposed with the U.S.' robust
commitment to the region, an all-out war between the PRC and Taiwan may
not be foreseeable in the short term. However, the PRC remains cognisant
that as long as a hot war does not erupt, the raison d'etre for the U.S.
intervention is invalid. Therefore, [grey zone tactics---economic
imperialism, political rhetoric and military exercises---may be part of
the new paradigm for the PRC to convey its **desire for
reunification**]{.underline}. In doing so, [the PRC practically conveys
to the U.S. that supporting the regional status quo is no longer
cost-free]{.underline} while avoiding significant escalation and
simultaneously [generating regional doubt concerning U.S. commitments
and capabilities]{.underline}.\[42\] Moving forward, [the PRC aims to
**transform** the PLA into a **"modern fighting force"**]{.underline} by
2027 [such that it can pose a credible threat]{.underline} to the
U.S.\[43\] In light of its expansionist tendencies, it is paramount for
the international community to affirm its commitment to a rules-based
international system to govern state-to-state interactions.

International Peace; \"The Real Motives for China's Nuclear Expansion,\"

//TL

A [[key obstacle]{.mark} to nuclear dialogue is China's]{.underline}
growing **[[skepticism]{.underline}]{.mark}** that
[**[cooperative]{.mark}** security [**measures** could defend it
from]{.mark} the **existential [threat]{.mark}**]{.underline} that it
perceives is coming [from the United States]{.underline}. Xi, for
instance, has stressed the importance of "keeping the strategic
initiative to safeguard national security firmly in our own hands." This
[[distrust]{.underline}]{.mark} is [[driving Beijing]{.mark} further
[toward]{.mark} achieving a [more **advantageous balance**]{.mark} **of
power** and **[diminishes]{.mark}** its **[interest]{.mark}** in
**[nuclear restraint]{.mark}**]{.underline}, let alone arms control
talks.

Beijing's [pessimism]{.underline} partly [stems from **perceived** U.S.
**double standards**]{.underline} in the nuclear realm. Chinese experts
point to the fact that the [U.S. government does not accept that China
has the right to adopt the same nuclear strategies as those used by the
United States]{.underline}. Washington, for instance, maintains the
option for the first use of nuclear weapons but raises concerns over
China potentially deviating from its unconditional pledge to not use
nuclear weapons first---a commitment that China says it will not break.

U.S. decision-makers explain away these double standards by hinting that
American security objectives are more legitimate than China's. They
consider the U.S. goal of upholding the territorial status quo in the
Asia-Pacific, including in the Taiwan Strait and the East China and
South China Seas, as aligned with international laws and norms, and they
contrast their regional aims with Chinese efforts to change the
territorial status quo through coercive means. Therefore, U.S.
policymakers deem it both morally defensible and strategically necessary
to preserve a broad range of nuclear options for the United States and
its allies.

Beijing, however, attributes these double standards to what Chinese
officials describe as the United States' "hegemonic arrogance." In
particular, [[China sees]{.mark} the U.S. [claim of the right to defend
Taiwan]{.mark},]{.underline} a territory Beijing has identified as "the
core of its core interests," [[as **illegitimate**]{.underline}]{.mark},
especially when Washington frames it in terms of its own security needs.
American [strategists]{.underline} often [[**highlight** Taiwan's
**significance**]{.mark} and argue that **[keeping Taiwan
separate]{.mark}** from China is critically important to **U.S. national
security interests**]{.underline}, which include maintaining a favorable
military balance in the Asia-Pacific, defending U.S. allies in the
region, preserving U.S. global credibility, and advancing geoeconomic
competition with China. These announced [goals give further **credence**
to [Beijing's concern]{.mark} that [U.S. **geopolitical gains** will

[China believes it can rectify this unjust imbalance by]{.underline}

Chinese experts argue, for instance, that the Soviet Union succeeded in
altering U.S. nuclear strategy during the Cold War. By significantly
enhancing its nuclear capabilities during the 1960s and 1970s, Moscow
managed to pressure Washington into abandoning its policy of massive
retaliation, which threatened a large-scale nuclear strike in response
to any act of Soviet aggression, in favor of the more restrained
strategy of flexible response, which made the level and scale of U.S.
nuclear responses commensurate with the severity of the Soviet
aggression. [They are also quick to point out that Washington did not
correspondingly adjust its policies toward weaker adversaries, such as
China, but instead maintained expansive strike plans against
them]{.underline}. Now that China has significantly more resources than
it did during the Cold War, [Beijing seeks to redress what it perceives
as an ongoing injustice.]{.underline}

### AT: Counterforce

#### SILOS.

https://www.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/1212340/chinese-icbm-silos/.
//TL

The Department of Defense in 2020 estimated that [China]{.underline} is
[currently assessed to have an arsenal of around **100
ICBMs**]{.underline}. The [addition of **120 silos**]{.underline} under
construction near Yumen [represents a **significant expansion** of
China's nuclear forces]{.underline}. If the silos under construction at
other sites across China are added to the count, the total comes to 144
silos under construction. We believe [China]{.underline} is expanding
its [nuclear forces]{.underline} in part to [maintain a **deterrent**
that can survive a **US first strike** and **retaliate in sufficient
numbers** to defeat US missile defenses.]{.underline}

The [silos]{.underline} under construction were [identified by the
distinctive environmental shelters placed over the construction
sites]{.underline}. These shelters were previously identified at China's
Jilantai Missile Training Area where construction components of the silo
were visible outside the shelter. Images of some of the sites show
circular excavation for a silo prior to being covered by an
environmental shelter.

The [more than **100 shelters**]{.underline} are [spread across
approximately 700 square miles]{.underline} near Yumen, in Gansu
province. Each shelter is spaced approximately 3 km from its nearest
neighbor. Construction began in March 2020, although the vast majority
of construction occurred after February 2021, [suggesting]{.underline}
an [extremely rapid pace of construction]{.underline} over the past few
months. (In earlier conversations we stated that construction began
after February 2021, although a closer examination of historical imagery
shows that we simply overlooked some earlier construction.)

There are also a [number of cut-and-cover facilities under construction
that may be launch control facilities]{.underline}. Each possible launch
control facility is connected by trenches, presumably for communications
cables, to ten different silos under construction.

The silos are likely for China's DF-41 ICBM, which is believed to be
capable of carrying multiple warheads. (Although some reports suggest
the DF-41 could carry as many as ten warheads, the real number is likely
to be significantly lower. Previous DF-41 tests have reportedly only
carried two warheads.) The Department of Defense identified in its 2018,
2019, and 2020 China Military Power reports that China "appeared to be
considering... silo basing" options for the DF-41. See Note 1.

Silo-based ICBMs are extremely easy to identify with satellites and
vulnerable to attack with very accurate modern missiles. One possibility
is that [China is building a **larger number of silos** than missiles to
**complicate** the **ability** of the United States **to target China's
ICBM force**]{.underline}. One of, Jeffrey Lewis, leans strongly toward
this intepretation. The other, Decker Eveleth, is neutral on the
question. [This would mirror the approach called the "**shell
game**]{.underline}" pursued by the United States in the late 1970s for
basing the MX missile. [China]{.underline} is reported to have [studied
the multiple protective shelter concept in the 1980s before choosing
instead to construct **decoy missile silos**]{.underline}. See note 2.

In that scheme, the United States planned to build 23 launch shelters
for each MX missile -- in all, 4600 launch shelters for just 200
missiles. (The United States also considered a variant with "vertical
shelters" or silos.) The US [goal was to make it
**impossible**]{.underline} for the Soviet Union [to be **confident**
that it could **conduct a disarming first strike** against]{.underline}
US land-based [ICBMs]{.underline}, as the MX missile would be regularly
transported and moved between shelters. [China]{.underline} likely has
similar concerns about the survivability of silo-based ICBMs, and [may
**rotate** a smaller number of **ICBMs** among a **larger number of
operational silos**.]{.underline}

The [layout]{.underline} of the facility much [more closely
**resembles** the layout under the "**shell game"
approach**]{.underline} than it does the layout of other Chinese ICBM
facilities. The [silos]{.underline} near Yumen are [packed in
patters]{.underline} with 3 km [separating each shelter]{.underline}
from its nearest neighbors. The three images below show the silos at
Yumen, a schematic showing an MPS layout, and a declassified diagram of
an ICBM deployment area in China.

#### They can detect like [everything]{.underline}.

//TL

On Friday, an [end-of-year video sent to Xi]{.underline} by the People's
Liberation Army [featured a group of "**early warning and monitoring**"
troops standing before]{.underline} the [ground-based phased-array radar
station]{.underline}. This video included representatives from various
military divisions, including the army, navy, air force, and even the
aerospace force.

"[We will strictly monitor the battlefield situation]{.underline} to
ensure that if there is any situation, we will respond immediately." an
aerospace force representative, [Standing before the radar, was observed
firmly]{.underline} making this statement. As a part of this report, Xi
extended Lunar New Year greetings to the troops and insisted that they
"strengthen combat readiness duties" during the festival to face
emergencies.

Former PLA instructor Song told **[SCMP]{.underline}** it was "[at the
**forefront**" of the country's **anti-missile defense
system**]{.underline}. "It is [key to receiving warnings
early]{.underline} so that you have enough time to organize anti-missile
forces to react." He also indicated that [China will potentially use
this system to detect **hypersonic missiles**.]{.underline}

Phased-array radar systems have faster scanning speeds and better
accuracy than traditional radars. The radar does not move physically,
but instead, the array is controlled by computers to scan different
directions electronically. China has heavily invested in phased-array
radar systems since the 1970s as part of its military modernization
program.

[Alongside new anti-ballistic systems]{.underline} like the
surface-to-air HQ-19, which has been [compared to the US]{.underline}
Terminal High-Altitude Area Defence System, or [**THAAD**, China also
claims to have developed the world's **first 'seabed radar**' capable of
detecting **high-altitude aircraft**]{.underline} at a depth of 1,000
meters. While the HQ-19, capable of hitting targets at an altitude of
200 km, was publicly revealed at Zhuhai Airshow in 2024, the [Chinese
'**seabed radar'**]{.underline} is still a secret project that [could
dramatically change combat dynamics]{.underline} by [improving
**submarine offensive capabilities** substantially]{.underline}.

Pentagon's report from last year also mentions, "Several ground-based,
large-phase array radars, similar in appearance to US PAVE PAWS radars
-- that could support missile early warning role.

While the PLA has not disclosed the number or any details of its
long-range early warning radar systems, the [Pentagon estimates that it
has "**several** **ground-based**, **large-phase** array radars --
similar in appearance to US **PAVE PAWS**]{.underline} radars -- [that
could support a missile **early warning role**]{.underline}," according
to their report, last year on the development of the Chinese military.

Developed during the Cold War, the [PAVE PAWS]{.underline} (American
Precision Acquisition Vehicle Entry Phased Array Warning System) [can
**detect missiles** from as far away as **5,000km**]{.underline} (3,100
miles). It [**tracks moving projectiles** in great detail]{.underline}
from 2,000km (1,200 miles), [tracks **satellites**, surveils **space**,
and even **detects s**ubmarine-**l**aunched **b**allistic **m**issile

Stealth Submarine Is Undetectable,\" National Interest, 1-25-2022,

//TL

The [P]{.underline}eople's [L]{.underline}iberation [A]{.underline}rmy
Navy's **[newest submarine]{.underline}**, tentatively dubbed the
Type-039C, splashed across headlines earlier last month when social
media sleuthing [revealed the new submarine transitioning a body of
water]{.underline} with assistance from several tugboats.

Though a flurry of information about the new submarine surfaced --- some
definitive, some speculative --- there is [now more concrete information
about the new submarine]{.underline}. Here's what we know, a sort of
"deeper dive."

The Type-039 class and derivatives are also known as the Yuan-class. The
first of the class, the Type-039A, first made its appearance in a
Chinese shipyard in 2006 and caught many naval experts by surprise.
Since the class' introduction into PLAN service, several variants have
subsequently been introduced with the most significant external
difference between them being the sub's sails.

The first Yuan, the Type-039A, featured a sharply outlined and boxy sail
that drew comparisons to the Soviet Kilo-class which China purchased
from Russia after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The second Yuan
derivative provisionally called the Type-039B, featured a more refined,
more smoothly contoured sail that in all likelihood creates less
seawater "flow" noise, and would therefore be more difficult to track
while underwater and underway.

The [Type-039C Yuan has the most **complex sail design**]{.underline} of
the three. The [newest Yuan's sail is chined, potentially an indication
of the new platform's **emphasis** on **surface
operations**]{.underline}. Though speculative, the [chined sail is
reminiscent of the kind of **stealth contouring**]{.underline} used in
stealth aircraft and some ships to deflect incoming enemy radar and
remain undetected.

[One potential application for a submarine with a "**stealthy" sail**
could be special operation forces insertion and extraction when a
submarine on the surface would be **particularly
vulnerable**]{.underline}, though this remains somewhat speculative.

#### China has an [assured]{.underline} second-strike.

Hongjung **Shin &** Seong-Ho **Sheen 25**, Operational Assistant,
International Security Strategy Program, Seoul National University; PhD,
Professor, Former Dean, Seoul National University; \"The Evolution of
China\'s Assured Retaliation: An Analysis Focusing on the Development of
China\'s Strategic Nuclear Submarines,\" Korean Journal of International
Studies, 4-2025, Vol. 23, No. 1, pp. 61-98. //TL

In this regard, [we assess the **sufficiency** of China\'s assured
retaliation]{.underline} posture [in terms of
'**Survivability'**]{.underline} from a first-strike [and '**destructive
power'**]{.underline} for a second-strike. The first factor to assess is
survivability. The [PLAN]{.underline} is [designing]{.underline} the
next [submarine to be **quieter**]{.underline} to increase its
survivability. In 2017, PLAN Rear Admiral Ma Weiming, director of the
Power Electronics Research Institute at the PLAN Engineering University,
claimed that [China\'s]{.underline} future nuclear [**submarines** will
be equipped with **shaftless**, **rim-driven**, **pump-jet
technology**]{.underline}. These are [core technologies intended to
**reduce the noise** of submarines\' conceptional design]{.underline}.
In addition, [China]{.underline} is [improving its communication
system]{.underline} to maximize underwater duration during operations.
China\'s SSBNs will receive 3-30 Hz of Extremely Low Frequency (ELF)
signals from the command and control center. This allows the signals
from the CMC to be received even at depths of around 100 m, and allows
the communication connection with the command to be maintained only when
necessary while performing strategic patrol missions underwater (Zhao
2018).

Then, are [China\'s SSBNs **capable of blue water
patrols**]{.underline}? In fact, the region that provides the highest
survivability for submarine patrol missions is the ice-covered Arctic
Ocean. Countries adjacent to the Arctic, such as the US, Russia, the
United Kingdom, and France, are regularly carrying out strategic patrol
missions under the Arctic ice. However, [since China has geopolitical
limitations in the East China Sea and the South China Sea, the current
**promotion** of strategic]{.underline} nuclear [submarines needs to be
**supported by** the **maritime protection of friendly**]{.underline}
surface [**vessels** and anti-ship missiles]{.underline} on the ground.
As of 2015, the PLAN had surpassed the US Navy in the number of surface
platforms and was capable of qualitatively challenging the US. [The
**Chinese Navy** has been able to **keep the US Navy in check** by
operating aircraft carriers and Chinese-type Aegis
destroyers]{.underline} (such as the 055 type). In addition, [under the
control of the Rocket Force, anti-ship ballistic missiles]{.underline}
such as DF-21D ASBMs (anti-surface ballistic missile) have been able to
[efficiently attack high-value targets]{.underline} near China (Erickson
2017). As the PLAN continues to expand its naval assets, it ultimately
contributes to the advancement of its defensive indirect Anti-Submarine
Warfare.

The following is an assessment of China\'s assured retaliation posture
in terms of destructive power. The US [Department of Defense predicts
that China will have about **1,500 nuclear warheads**]{.underline} by
2035 (US DoD 2022). In a report arguing that China is emerging as a
"Second Nuclear Peer," the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory predicts
China\'s nuclear force deployment in 2026 as shown in Table 5.

\[TABLE OMITTED\]

China\'s 2019 Defense White Paper expressed that the US had first
provoked and intensified competition among major countries,
deteriorating strategic stability in nuclear, space, cyber, and missile
defense (Hiim, Fravel, Trøan 2023, 157). M. Taylor Fravel, Henrik
Stälane Hiim, and Magnus Langset Trøan further explained in Foreign
Affairs that this phenomenon was a response to the Pentagon\'s Nuclear
Posture Review in 2018, namely the US\' expression of a tougher stance
toward China and, in turn, [China\'s heightened threat perception toward
the US]{.underline}. Figure 2 below is a [graph showing the projected
increase in the number of Chinese nuclear warheads based on
forecasts]{.underline} from various US organizations.

\[FIGURE OMITTED\]

In addition to sea-based platforms, [China\'s **missile capabilities**
are also **rapidly advancing**]{.underline}. China has already [deployed
JL-2 SLBMs, **providing** limited **second-strike
capabilities**]{.underline} against major US military bases such as Guam
and Hawaii. As mentioned earlier, [China has been able to reduce the
burden of operations along its coast by continuously **increasing** its
**naval capabilities**]{.underline}. However, a lingering question has
been whether China can overcome the US Navy\'s Anti-Submarine
operations. If so, would major US cities such as LA and San Diego be
within the range of China\'s SSBNs? Furthermore, some analysts have
argued that it is unclear whether China\'s strategic nuclear submarines
can even provide reliable deterrence to China (Glaser and Fetter 2016).

In response, [China plans to acquire a **new type of
SLBM**]{.underline}, the JL-3, by [constructing additional **Tang-class
SSBNs**]{.underline}. The JL-3 is expected to have a range of about
10,000 km or more. [As it is known to be equipped with
MIRVs]{.underline}, it is [expected to be not only stronger than the
JL-2 but also able to **penetrate** the US led **Theater Missile Defense
system**]{.underline} (CSIS 2019).

In short, the [two main challenges]{.underline} that the Jin-class has
faced, ① limited survivability from underwater radiated noise technology
and ② its short missile range that could not compensate for its denied
access to blue water, [will, in many respects, **be resolved**. As the
PLAN SSBNs will be quieter, China will **overcome the first challenge**
by commissioning **Tang-class SSBNs**]{.underline}. Moreover, as [China
can even **target US territory** from coastal waters **with** the longer
range **MIRVed JL-3 missile**]{.underline}, which will ensure not just
retaliation but destruction, the second challenge will be resolved
(Hiim, Fravel, Trøan 2023, 174).

#### They have a triad already. Their data is also undercounting.

Mark B. **Schneider 24**, Senior Analyst, National Institute for Public
Policy, Former Office of Secretary of Defense for Policy; \" Current and
Projected Growth of China's Nuclear Arsenal,\" Occasional Paper,
10-2024, Vol. 4, No. 10. //TL

[China]{.underline} has [created a **nuclear Triad**]{.underline} and is
expanding it. Unfortunately, the DoD's China reports do not provide a
timely description of China's long-term nuclear modernization plan. They
mostly reference weapons that were previously discussed in open sources.

The 2023 DoD report states that "...sources indicate a 'long-range'
DF-27 ballistic missile is in development. Official [PRC military
writings indicate]{.underline} this range class spans 5,000-8,000 km,
which means the [**DF-27** could be a new **IRBM or
ICBM**]{.underline}."146 [The South China Morning Post says it can
**attack all major U.S. Pacific bases** and has been **operational for
four years**]{.underline}. 147 If correct, this is another instance of
the DoD report being years behind press reporting. Indeed, the 2024 FAS
China nuclear report states "...a US intelligence assessment of February
2023 notes that 'land attack and antiship variants \[of the DF-27\]
likely were fielded in limited numbers in 2022....'"148 It also noted a
Chinese exercise that may have featured the DF-27.149

If the DF-27 has a range of 8,000 km, it is probably a follow-on to the
DF-31, which was apparently designed against Russia but could reach
targets in Hawaii and Alaska. Reportedly, [the DF-27 is the **first
dual-capable ICBM**]{.underline} and [also **carries** a **hypersonic
vehicle** with an anticarrier role]{.underline}.150 Although these
characteristics are significant, it apparently is not a major driver of
Chinese nuclear weapons numbers.

[There is a reported **new Chinese ICBM program** not mentioned
in]{.underline} the [DoD and FAS China reports]{.underline} (although
there is a reference to a new ICBM in General Cotton's 2024
Congressional testimony) with a potential to expand the Chinese
strategic nuclear force well beyond the DoD's projected warhead
numbers.151 Fisher says Chinese sources indicate the development of a
new mobile ICBM, "\[[s\]ometimes called the DF-45 or DF-51]{.underline},
\[and\] it is [clearly intended to **outperform** the
**DF-41**."]{.underline}152 Bill Gertz reported, "The DF-45 would have a
takeoff weight of 112 tons and a payload weighing 3.6 tons and be armed
with seven 650- kiloton warheads. The new missile's estimated range
would be 7,456 to 9,320 miles."153 Presumably, it can carry the other
DF-41 warhead packages indicated in the PLARF briefing slide. One
Western press report credits the DF-51 with 14 warheads.154 In
traditional arms control terminology, this is a "heavy" ICBM. It is
unclear whether the DF-45/DF-51 is one or two systems.

China's mobile MIRVed ICBMs create the possibility that China has a much
larger force than the DoD knows about or is revealing publicly. The
Defense Department provides no numbers for the MIRVed DF-41. The 2024
FAS China report says there are 28 deployed missiles, which seems low,
since the report admits that China paraded 18 launchers in 2019.155 In
addition to the road mobile DF-41, Fisher projects [up to **100
rail-mobile DF-41s** by about 2030.156 China's **5,000-km of missile
tunnels**, the so-called **Underground Great Wall**, can **hide
thousands of mobile ICBMs**]{.underline}.157

The pattern of Chinese modernization suggests a successor to the JL-3
SLBM---either an improved version or a JL-4 SLBM for the new 096 missile
submarine. The DoD report mentions two 096 submarines, but Fisher
predicts they may build six with 14 missiles each. 158

[China also has a **large and growing bomber force**]{.underline}.
Fisher [credits Beijing with **150 H-6 bombers**]{.underline} in 2023,
[growing to 250 bombers]{.underline} in 2035, including the H-20 stealth
bomber.159 There is [**no real dispute about** the number of current
Chinese **bombers or** their ALCM **capability**]{.underline} (Fisher
says 950 in 2023, growing to 1,700 in 2035), 160 but the [DoD's low
overall warhead numbers must assume that China has only a handful of
air-launched nuclear weapons and no nuclear cruise missiles]{.underline}
(despite the fact that in 2021 then Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff General John Hyten said they were rapidly building them).161 This
is explicit in the 2024 FAS report, which indicates China has only 20
nuclear bombs and air-launched nuclear ballistic missiles.162 In July
2024, China released a photograph of the H-6K carrying four (possibly
nuclear capable) ballistic missiles.163 Thus, [the **potential** for
**warhead undercounting is very high**.]{.underline}

[China's non-strategic nuclear systems will be improved through
modernization, but its **arsenal is already so large** that the **key
issues** are the **types** that are **dual capable** and **what
percentage are nuclear**]{.underline}. Again, the [potential for
undercounting is quite high]{.underline}.

China has a [nuclear force sufficient to carry thousands of
warheads]{.underline}. The following chart from the October 2023 DoD
China military report provides estimates of the number of Chinese
land-based nuclear missile launchers and missiles.164 Military
journalist Bill Gertz writes that most of these missiles are dual
capable.165

#### Counter-forcing fails.

**Glaser \'23** \[Charles L.; Senior Fellow in Security Studies at MIT's
Security Studies Program; October 5, 2023; \"The U.S. Nuclear Arsenal
Can Deter Both China and Russia,\" Foreign Affairs,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/us-nuclear-arsenal-can-deter-both-china-and-russia\]

[The fundamental **problem** with a counterforce strategy is
**feasibility**: preemptive U.S. attacks]{.underline} on an adversary's
nuclear forces [would likely **not** be **effective** enough
to]{.underline} meaningfully [limit the damage]{.underline} that could
be inflicted by a nuclear peer. [An adversary that could detonate 50 to
**100 warheads** on U.S. cities and]{.underline} infrastructure could
[do more than enough damage to destroy the United States as a
functioning society]{.underline}. China's nuclear modernization,
including increases in the size and survivability of its forces and
advances in the sophistication of its nuclear command-and-control
system, will ensure that Beijing has this capability even following a
full-scale U.S. counterforce attack. Russia has long possessed such a
capability.

In recent years, various [analysts have disputed this]{.underline}
pessimistic [conclusion about]{.underline} the feasibility of [a
counterforce]{.underline} strategy, arguing that technological
developments are making nuclear arsenals around the world far more
vulnerable and holding that China's response will not be effective
enough to offset U.S. damage-limitation capabilities. [This critique is
**not persuasive**]{.underline}. It is true that certain technological
advances are improving the ability of highly capable states to find and
target opposing nuclear forces. For example, small satellites and
machine-learning algorithms are creating the possibility of using a
large network of space-based radars to detect and track mobile missiles.
[Adversaries]{.underline}, however, are likely to [respond
to]{.underline} such [developments]{.underline}. In this action-reaction
competition, those [adversaries will almost certainly **defeat
counterforce**-enabling technologies by fielding missile **decoys**,
**stealthy missiles**]{.underline} that can evade radar detection, [and
**counterspace** equipment such as satellite jammers and antisatellite
weapons]{.underline}. Such [innovations have a long history; when
the Soviet Union became concerned]{.underline} in the 1980s about the
possibility [that the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [could track its mobile missiles]{.underline}, for
instance, [it developed a missile launcher that was virtually
indistinguishable from a ubiquitous commercial truck]{.underline}.
Moreover, [a well-resourced state]{.underline} concerned for the
survivability of its nuclear arsenal [always has a simple option at its
disposal: build more nuclear weapons]{.underline}. Given China's
commitment to acquiring an assured destruction capability, the United
States should expect China to respond effectively. Russia may be poorer
than China, but precisely because its nuclear forces are likely to play
a greater role in compensating for its conventional weakness in the
future, Moscow, too, can and will ensure their survivability.

For the first time, the United States faces two nuclear peers, China and
Russia.

[Given the **infeasibility** of a counterforce]{.underline} approach,
[the logical alternative is a **deterrence** strategy]{.underline}
[designed to convince adversaries not to attack]{.underline} the United
States or its allies by threatening to damage or totally destroy an
adversary's society and infrastructure. Under this policy, Washington
would not plan to attack an adversary's nuclear forces because doing so
would not meaningfully protect the United States. Instead, Washington
would target its adversary's economic and industrial infrastructure,
including energy and communication systems, ports, and transportation
nodes. [This]{.underline} strategy need not and [should not be composed
of a **singular threat** of all-out attack]{.underline}. The United
States could threaten a spectrum of nuclear options, ranging from
demonstration explosions to small attacks against isolated
infrastructure targets that would result in limited civilian casualties
to large attacks that would result in societal destruction.

According to this alternative logic, the relative size of countries'
nuclear forces is irrelevant; all that matters for deterrence is the
absolute size of their retaliatory capabilities and their ability to
inflict damage. Parity---equal-size forces---is unnecessary. Once
adversaries each have an assured destruction capability, expanding their
nuclear forces or acquiring new capabilities will not lead to more
effective deterrence. Parity may play a political role by making arms
control agreements appear fair or implying the adequacy of a state's
forces, but there is no strategic or deterrent logic to it.

Proponents of counterforce strategies offer a host of responses to this
argument. Today, the most common critique is that infrastructure
targeting, in contrast to counterforce targeting, is immoral and
violates the law of armed conflict, which aims to minimize human
suffering and the loss of civilian life. This argument fails for two
reasons.

First, in practice, [counterforce strikes would likewise lead to massive
civilian casualties]{.underline}, not only because [the fallout from
nuclear attacks]{.underline} against missile silos and command bunkers
[would spread widely]{.underline} but also because some [**bases** for
nuclear forces sit **near** large **population centers**]{.underline}.
In fact, some [command-and-control and leadership facilities are in
large cities]{.underline}; Russia's National Defense Control Center, for
example, is located in the center of Moscow, not far from the Kremlin.
Indeed, when making the case for counterforce targeting, four former
U.S. government officials recently argued that the United States must be
able to deprive an adversary's leaders of "their military power,
political control and possibly their own lives"---a goal that could not
be achieved without launching nuclear weapons against numerous targets
located in and around cities. Moreover, as recently as 2009, U.S.
nuclear targets were known to include an adversary's so-called
war-supporting infrastructure, which presumably includes industrial
facilities such as power plants and ports. The United States probably
continues to target such infrastructure; current U.S. doctrine
allows for attacks on objects that are indirectly "war-supporting" or
"war-sustaining," and influential supporters of U.S. nuclear expansion
have argued for the need to threaten an adversary's "industrial
potential to sustain war."

In short, [the **societal damage** that would be inflicted by a
**comprehensive counterforce** strike would not be significantly less
destructive]{.underline} than that wrought by attacks aimed at
infrastructure. [The labels "counterforce" and
"countervalue"]{.underline}---which are the terms in which the nuclear
strategy debate has been carried out---may therefore [imply a far larger
difference]{.underline} in nuclear war outcomes [than would actually
occur]{.underline}.

Second, [allowing i]{.underline}nternational humanitarian [law to guide
U.S. nuclear strategy could]{.underline} in fact [make a nuclear war
more likely]{.underline}. Counterforce attacks intended to save the
lives of a state's own civilians are one of the few kinds of nuclear
operations potentially consistent with international humanitarian law.
Under such a strategy, however, [an adversary would be far more likely
to believe that the United States would **launch preemptive
strikes**]{.underline}. In anticipation, [the adversary might **use**
nuclear weapons **first**]{.underline}---perhaps, in the case of Russia,
as part of a large-scale strike intended to degrade U.S. nuclear forces
but more likely in a limited way to try to coerce the United States into
backing down. [Once a nuclear war was underway]{.underline}, however,
[there could be **no guarantee** that it would remain
**limited**]{.underline}. The most ethical and moral policy, therefore,
is not a counterforce strategy but one that minimizes the probability of
nuclear war, as well as the probability and extent of escalation if war
occurs.

#### Counter-forcing ensures arms racing and escalation.

The Costs of Counterforce: Escalation Risks

[The **dangers of counterforce** targeting do not end with an arms race.
Chinese]{.underline} or Russian [fears that their nuclear forces are
vulnerable]{.underline} to U.S. attacks (whether well-founded or
otherwise) [could spark otherwise **avoidable
escalation**]{.underline}.\[39\]

As proponents of counterforce emphasize, China and Russia value their
nuclear forces greatly and worry about their survivability. Especially
during a grave crisis or a conventional conflict, if an adversary
believed that the United States could significantly degrade its nuclear
force, it could resort to extreme measures---including using nuclear
weapons---to protect that force. The most extreme possibility is that
Russia could launch large-scale counterforce strikes against the United
States before the United States could do the same to Russia. (China
currently lacks the capabilities for such an operation.) More likely,
China or Russia could use nuclear weapons in a limited way, to terrify
the United States into ending a war rapidly or at least desisting from
whatever behavior Beijing or Moscow found threatening.

Less dramatic [actions could **catalyze escalation**, culminating in
nuclear use]{.underline}.\[40\] For example, **[China]{.underline}** or
Russia [could issue **nuclear threats** as a prelude to nuclear
use]{.underline}. Alternatively or additionally, either country could
take steps to make its retaliatory capability more survivable. For
example, [Chinese]{.underline} or Russian [leaders could pre-delegate
launch authority]{.underline} down the chain of command [so that, if
they were killed in a U.S. nuclear strike, their **subordinates could
retaliate**. They could also order an **increase** in the **alert
level** of their nuclear force]{.underline} by, for example, [dispersing
mobile delivery systems. Each]{.underline} of those steps would [risk
further escalation. Pre-delegating launch authority]{.underline}, for
example, [would increase the chance of **unauthorized nuclear use** by
Chinese]{.underline} or Russian officers entrusted with such authority.
[Nuclear threats or the dispersal of nuclear forces could **prompt
countervailing actions**]{.underline} by the United States, including
perhaps counterforce strikes if U.S. leaders believed that a nuclear war
had become imminent.

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates' [embrace of counterforce
targeting **exacerbates** all those **escalation
pressures**]{.underline}. In practice, [one]{.underline}
probable [element]{.underline} of its doctrine [could prove especially
**dangerous**]{.underline}. In 2023, a study group convened by Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory publicly endorsed "[limited counterforce
strikes]{.underline}"; although left undefined, such strikes could
presumably involve attacks against, for example, a handful of Russian
ICBM silos.\[41\] Because the study group included various former
officials with extensive knowledge of U.S. nuclear strategy, it seems
likely such attacks are part of U.S. nuclear plans. Yet [it is difficult
to imagine a better way to convince an adversary that its nuclear forces
are in jeopardy and that it has **no choice but to
escalate**]{.underline}. Indeed, even the study group had to acknowledge
that "[counterforce]{.underline}, either as first use or retaliation,
[can]{.underline} . . . [**muddle the message** sent through limited
use]{.underline}, potentially [communicating that the attacking side is
**attempting a disarming attack**]{.underline}."\[42\] In theory, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [could plan for large-scale
counterforce operations]{.underline} for the purpose of damage
limitation, [while abandoning the option of launching limited
counterforce strikes for coercion]{.underline}. But [the fact that the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [appears not to have done
so]{.underline} [suggests just how difficult it is to
manage]{.underline} the **[escalation]{.underline}** risks inherent in
counterforce targeting.

[The **case for U.S. nuclear superiority** made by several high-profile
**nuclear policy experts** in the United States has tacitly **increased
tensions** between **Washington** and **Beijing**]{.underline}. Any
[decision to pursue the **recommendations outlined in the U.S. Strategic
Posture Review** to respond to China's alleged efforts to achieve
nuclear parity with the United States will only create a more uncertain
and dangerous international threat environment]{.underline}. Hence, [it
has]{.underline} never **[been more [crucial to understand China's
approach to deterrence]{.mark}, in order to bring a much-needed sense of
perspective to Sino-American nuclear dynamics]{.underline}**. More
importantly, cultivating a sense of understanding is critical to
attaining and maintaining peace.

This article seeks to contextualize China's nuclear journey, and to
serve as a reminder to policymakers and the general public alike that
while China's nuclear journey has been far from straightforward, China's
nuclear intentions have historically been to prevent and not to provoke
nuclear conflict.

China has been a nuclear power since 1964. Up until the 1990s, China
only had roughly 20 strategic nuclear capable delivery systems. Its
approach to deterrence in that period, according to Nicola Leveringhaus,
was not strategic, but rather can be understood by analyzing
technological constraints, domestic politics, and its leadership
decision-making considerations on nuclear and national security issues.

During the Cold War, China's main strategic threats were posed by the
USSR and the United States. Then, nuclear weapons served as a deterrent
against any acts of aggression by the superpowers. In the 21st century,
China has undertaken massive nuclear modernization and expansion. Today,
China's nuclear forces are numbered at roughly 440 warheads, and
according to Pentagon estimates will number 1,500 warheads by 2035.

With the end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the USSR, and the
emergence of regional nuclear powers such as India and Pakistan as well
as a continued U.S. threat perception, China's nuclear deterrent is
positioned to prevent acts of aggression regionally and against the
United States. Indeed, according to Caitlin Talmadge and Joshua Rovner,
"The specific nature of China's improvements do seem oriented toward
bolstering the country's assured retaliation posture in response to
growing threats from ever more capable U.S. counterforce and missile
defense systems."

Yet, throughout China's nuclear history, it has consistently adopted a
deterrence by punishment posture, and has stressed the importance of
maintaining an effective second-strike retaliatory capability.

A deterrence by punishment posture enables [**[China]{.mark}** to
[threaten]{.mark} **nuclear [retaliation]{.mark}** [against]{.mark} a
**nuclear [strike on]{.mark} its vital [interest]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark}
a **secure [second-strike capability]{.mark}** refers to China's ability
to absorb a nuclear strike and to retaliate with a nuclear response.
Both require highly survivable nuclear capabilities, and a resilient
national security infrastructure, which China appears to have
continually pursued.]{.underline}

Since Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, [**[China]{.mark}** has
[**invested** **heavily** in]{.mark} **developing a [triad]{.mark}** of
land, air and sea-based nuclear **[capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
While the [[prolif]{.mark}eration [of **nuclear silos**]{.mark} from
which to launch its]{.underline} DF-5 intercontinental ballistic
missiles (**[[ICBM]{.underline}]{.mark}**) **[[constitutes]{.mark} the
[largest land-based nuclear build-up]{.mark} in China's
history]{.underline}**, they [[bolster]{.mark} China's **[strategic
deterrence capability]{.mark}** by **[signaling]{.mark}** to the United
States that [it is **investing in long-range**]{.mark} **delivery
[systems]{.mark}** [that can **reach**]{.mark} **targets in the
continental [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates**]{.underline}.
Nevertheless, as Vipin Narang observed, "[The types of
**[capabilities]{.mark}** that China developed are **[consistent
with]{.mark} a [retaliatory posture]{.mark}** [aimed at
**deterring**]{.mark} **nuclear coercion and nuclear
[use]{.mark}**]{.underline}." China has also always adhered to a "no
first use" (NFU) doctrine regarding its nuclear forces, precluding it
from adopting an asymmetric escalation posture. [That it is [entirely
reliant on]{.mark} its own strategic nuclear capabilities for
[deterrence]{.mark} also precludes it from adopting a catalytic posture,
as it does not need to, nor can it rely on, a nuclear patron to
intervene in crises on its behalf.]{.underline}

As Brandon Babin stated, "[China has defined its active defense national
military strategy as 'striking only after the enemy has
struck]{.underline}.'" Nevertheless, [[recent]{.mark} Chinese [efforts
to develop]{.mark} more nuclear options, such as [theater nuclear
weapons and longer-range ballistic missiles, indicate]{.mark} that
[China]{.mark} is potentially [reviewing]{.mark} its [deterrence
posture]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Current estimates]{.mark} of]{.underline} their [nuclear forces
[suggest]{.mark} that [China]{.mark} appears to [adopt]{.mark} a
[posture that includes countervalue targets, holding]{.mark} at
[risk]{.mark} their adversaries' [densely populated
centers]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [size of China's nuclear forces
logically orients it toward adopting countervalue
targeting]{.underline}, as a counterforce posture would require a
nuclear force size capable of successfully hitting an adversary's
nuclear forces.

A damage limitation approach, therefore, would simply not be feasible
with their force size. As it stands, counterforce would prove
ineffective for China if ever it is engaged in a nuclear conflagration
with the United States. Again, Narang here is salient: "Chinese posture
features...strong centralized controls, survivability through dispersed
and concealed stewardship procedures and numerical ambiguity, and
punitive retaliatory strikes against key countervalue targets."

Adopting countervalue targeting enables China to effectively deter
adversaries without requiring it to possess robust nuclear forces with
sophisticated delivery systems. Changes in force size, however, will
surely increase China's nuclear options and will afford China with a
breadth of maneuverability previously unattainable.

[**[China is expected to upgrade]{.mark}**]{.underline} its air, ground
and sea-based nuclear delivery systems -- or **[[nuclear
triad]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- **[[following]{.underline}]{.mark}**
President [**[Xi]{.mark}** Jinping**['s]{.mark}** [call for]{.mark} a
"**[strong]{.mark} system of [strategic
deterrence]{.mark}**".]{.underline} Xi made the call in his work report
to the 20th Communist Party congress earlier this month in comments
laying out the country's development path for the next five years and
beyond. Deterrence is the ability to wield military power to dissuade
adversaries from launching an attack. [Defence analysts said the
[**Ukraine war** and]{.mark} an increasingly **[uncertain global
order]{.mark}** had [**reminded** **Beijing that conventional
weapons**]{.mark} **were [not enough for]{.mark} real** "**[strategic
deterrence]{.mark}**". "**Deterrence with conventional weapons**
**[revealed]{.mark}** their [**weakness** on]{.mark} the **battlefield
of the [Ukraine]{.mark} war**, which has seen the Russian military and
Ukraine's Nato-aided forces locked in endless fights, as neither could
use aircraft and tanks to overwhelm each other,"]{.underline} said Zhou
Chenming, a researcher with the Yuan Wang military science and
technology think tank in Beijing. "[Even the world's most capable
military, the United States, still failed to wipe out the Taliban using
powerful conventional weapons such as satellites, aircraft, tanks and
others]{.underline}." But the [war in Ukraine had shown that Russia's
powerful nuclear triad had deterred the US and Nato from direct combat
with the Russian military]{.underline}, according to Song Zhongping, a
defence commentator and former instructor with the People's Liberation
Army's missile force. "To some extent, nuclear force is an effective
means to stop war from escalating," Song said. "[**[China needs to
upgrade]{.mark} its nuclear triad [capability]{.mark}**, not only by
**increasing the nuclear warheads** to a suitable size, but also
**modernising the performance of nuclear launch vehicles**." [Xi's
mention]{.mark} of 'strategic deterrence' [points to]{.mark} China's
[nuclear build-up]{.mark} Beijing has made establishing a powerful and
effective strategic deterrence system a priority since Xi]{.underline}
took over as chairman of the Central Military Commission in late 2012,
and nuclear modernisation has been part of his unprecedented overhaul of
the military over the past five years, according to analysts. Along with
the US and Russia, China is now one of three members of the five
permanent members of the UN Security Council to have a complete nuclear
triad. That capacity was revealed in October 2020 when the PLA Air Force
released footage of the Xian H-6N bomber carrying a ballistic missile.
The footage showed that China had all the components of a nuclear triad:
ground-based intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs),
submarine-launched missiles and air-launched weapons. [China's most
powerful nuclear deterrent]{.underline}, the Dongfeng [series of ICBMs
were on show during its National Day military parade in
2019]{.underline}. They included the land-based **[DF-41]{.underline}**,
the road-mobile **[DF-31AG]{.underline}** and the **[submarine-launched
JL-2]{.underline}**, all of which could reach the US mainland. [Zhou
said that capacity would be boosted with the development of the **Xian
H-20** supersonic stealth bomber]{.underline}. "Among the world's
nuclear states, only those possessing nuclear triad capabilities are
real superpowers. [China's strategic deterrence will be significantly
upgraded once the **H-20** is put into service," he said. Chinese
military magazines and social media suggested the H-20's maiden flight
could happen this year, but Beijing has been reluctant to announce any
progress on the bomber]{.underline}. The H-20 is expected to double
China's nuclear strike range. It has a maximum take-off weight of at
least 200 tonnes and the ability to fire four powerful hypersonic
stealth cruise missiles. It is one of the country's "20-series" of new
generation warplanes, which includes the **[J-20 stealth fighter
jet]{.underline}**, the **[Y-20 transport aircraft]{.underline}** and
the **[Z-20 medium-lift utility helicopter]{.underline}**. China has
been estimated to have around 200 to 300 deliverable nuclear warheads,
compared with the more than 5,000 each held by the US and Russia. But a
[[**Pentagon** **report**]{.mark} last November forecast [China could
have]{.mark} up to **[700 warheads by]{.mark} 20[27]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark} at **least [1,000 by]{.mark} 20[30]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Zhou Bo, a senior fellow at Tsinghua University's Centre for
International Security and Strategy, said China must modernise its
capabilities to ensure its "small but effective" nuclear arsenal could
create enough deterrence. "Compared with the US and Russia, China's
nuclear arsenal has always been small," he said, adding that China had
to modernise and increase the number of its warheads to make them more
effective. Stealth bomber 'will give China truly intercontinental strike
capacity' Zhou Chenming of the Yuan Wang think tank said that Beijing's
best option was to raise the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons,
rather than expand its nuclear arsenal and trigger an arms race. "Since
Beijing has promised to maintain its 'no first use' policy, [**[China
doesn't need to expand]{.mark} its [nuclear arsenal]{.mark}**, as its
nuclear technology is now on a par with the US and Russia, **meaning
[China's second-strike capability is]{.mark} also [powerful enough to
destroy the globe]{.mark}**]{.underline}," Zhou said. [[To raise]{.mark}
the nuclear [threshold, China]{.mark} had [tried to improve]{.mark} its
[missile launches]{.mark} by [establishing]{.mark} a comprehensive
[missile defence network]{.mark} and improving technologies [that make
it]{.mark} more [difficult to intercept]{.mark} Chinese
[missiles]{.mark}]{.underline}, he said. Defence experts said nuclear
modernisation was just part of the PLA's strategic deterrence system, as
Xi has also urged the military to speed up development of unmanned,
intelligent combat capabilities to support modern warfare and "win local
wars". Zhou Bo said the local wars Xi referred to included potential
military conflicts around China's periphery, including a possible Taiwan
contingency and territorial disputes in the South and East China seas.

**[[China continues]{.mark} the [long-term modernization of]{.mark} its
[land]{.mark}-based]{.underline}**, nuclear-capable **[[missile
force]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But the pace and scope of this effort have
increased significantly over the past few years with the construction
underway of [approximately [**350 new missile silos** and **several
new**]{.mark} **bases for [road-mobile missile
launchers]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Overall, we estimate that the PLARF
currently [operates [approximately **712**]{.mark} **launchers** for
**land-based missiles that can [deliver nuclear
warheads]{.mark}**.]{.underline} But not all of those are necessarily
assigned nuclear warheads. Of those launchers, 462 can be loaded with
missiles that can reach the continental United States. Many of China's
ballistic missile launchers are for short-, medium-, and
intermediate-range missiles intended for regional missions, and most of
those do not have nuclear strike missions. We estimate that China has
roughly 100 nuclear warheads assigned to regional missiles, although
this number comes with significant uncertainty.

The PLARF, which is headquartered in Beijing, has recently undergone
several management shakeups: In July 2023, the PLARF commander and
political commissar, along with several other senior officers, were
removed from their positions following an anti-corruption investigation.
Notably, the top two PLARF officials were replaced by generals from
outside the PLARF itself: the new commander and political commissar come
from the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) and the People's
Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF), respectively (Lendon, McCarthy, and
Chang Citation2023). In October 2023, China's Minister of National
Defense Li Shangfu, who would have been responsible for approving
nuclear weapons acquisitions, was also removed from his post (US
Department of Defense Citation2024, XII).

The PLARF controls nine individually numbered bases: six for missile
operations distributed across China (Bases 61 through 66), one for
overseeing the central nuclear stockpile (Base 67), one for maintaining
infrastructure (Base 68), and one that is assumed to be for training and
missile tests (Base 69) (Xiu Citation2022, 2). Each missile operating
base controls six to eight missile brigades, with the number of
launchers and missiles assigned to each brigade depending on the type of
missile (Xiu Citation2022, 5).

[**To accommodate the growing missile force**, the total number of
[**Chinese missile brigades has increased** too]{.mark}]{.underline}.
This [increase is predominantly [caused by]{.mark} the growing inventory
of conventional missiles]{.underline}, but it is also a [product of
China's [nuclear modernization program]{.mark}.]{.underline} We estimate
that the PLARF currently has [**[approximately 45 brigades]{.mark}**
**with ballistic or cruise missile launchers**]{.underline}.
Approximately [[30 of those]{.mark} brigades either [operate]{.mark}
ballistic missile launchers with [**nuclear capability** or are
**upgrading to do**]{.mark} **so soon**]{.underline} (see Table 2). This
is close to the 50 nuclear missile brigades that Russia operates---known
as regiments in the Russian military vocabulary (Kristensen, Korda, and
Reynolds Citation2023).

[[China]{.mark} currently **[fields]{.mark} a [sub]{.mark}marine
[force]{.mark} of [six second-generation Jin-class]{.mark}** (Type 094)
**[nuclear-powered]{.mark}** ballistic missile submarines
(**[SSBNs]{.mark}**), which are based at the Yalong naval base near
Longposan on Hainan Island]{.underline}. The [**[two newest]{.mark}
SSBNs** are [believed to be **improved**]{.mark} **variants** of the
original Type 094 design]{.underline}. Some Chinese journals refer to it
as the Type 094A but this has not been confirmed by either the Pentagon
or the Chinese government. [These SSBNs include a more prominent hump,
which initially triggered some speculation as to whether they could
carry up to 16 submarine-launched ballistic missiles (**SLBMs**),
instead of the usual 12]{.underline} (Suciu Citation2020; Sutton
Citation2016). [However, satellite images subsequently confirmed that
the **[new subs]{.mark} are [equipped with 12 launch tubes]{.mark}**
each]{.underline} (Kristensen and Korda Citation2020). [The
**[upgrades]{.mark} were later assessed to be [related to sound
silencing]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Carlson and Wang Citation2023, 18).

Per the Pentagon's most recent China Military Power Report,
[[China]{.mark} has [equipped]{.mark}]{.underline} its Jin-class
[[SSBNs]{.underline} [to carry]{.underline}]{.mark} [either the
**[7,200-k]{.mark}ilo[m]{.mark}eter [range]{.mark}**]{.underline} JL-2
(CSS-N-14) [[**SLBM** **or**]{.mark} the
**[longer]{.mark}**]{.underline}-range JL-3 (CSS-N-20) SLBMs, and China
has likely begun replacing the JL-2s with JL-3s on a rotational basis as
each submarine returns to port for routine maintenance and overhaul (US
Department of Defense Citation2023, 55). [The range of the JL-2 is
[**sufficient to target** **Alaska**, **Guam**, **Hawaii**, **Russia**,
and **India** **from waters near China**]{.mark}]{.underline}, but not
the continental United States---unless the **[[sub]{.mark}marine [sails
deep in]{.mark}to the [Pacific]{.mark} [Ocean to launch]{.mark} its
missiles]{.underline}**. With the JL-3's longer [[range]{.mark} of
[roughly **10,000 k**]{.mark}**ilo[m]{.mark}eters**]{.underline}, a
[submarine will be able to **[target]{.mark} the [northwestern]{.mark}
parts of the continental [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [from]{.mark}
northern [Chinese waters]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but not from the South
China Sea. And it would still not be able to target Washington, DC
without sailing past northeast Japan (National Air and Space
Intelligence Center Citation2020, 33). Unlike the JL-2, the JL-3
allegedly can deliver "multiple" warheads per missile (National Air and
Space Intelligence Center Citation2020, 33). It is unknown if the JL-3
is indeed equipped with multiple warheads; US intelligence has not
explicitly stated that it is. The People's Liberation Army Navy
reportedly conducted its first test of the JL-3 in November 2018 (Gertz
Citation2018) and appears to have conducted at least two---possibly
three---additional tests since then (M. Chan Citation2020; Guo and Liu
Citation2019).

Although the Jin-class is more advanced than China's first experimental
SSBN---the single and now inoperable Xia (Type 092)---it is a noisy
design compared with current US and Russian missile submarines. It is
estimated that the initial Type 094s was two orders of magnitude louder
than the stealthiest Russian or American SSBNs (Coates Citation2016).
However, the enhanced Type 094A SSBN is probably less noisy (Lin and
Singer Citation2017). This may explain why China has decided to continue
construction of additional Type 094A SSBNs, rather than transitioning
entirely to the next-generation Type 096. Another reason may be due to
production delays: The new Type 096 was scheduled to begin construction
in the early 2020s, but after apparent delays, the Pentagon's 2024 CMPR
states that China will likely begin construction of the Type 096 "soon"
(US Department of Defense Citation2024, 53).

In 2022, China completed a new construction hall at Huludao shipyard,
where the People's Liberation Army Navy's submarines are built, which
could be for the production of the Type 096 SSBN (Sutton Citation2020).
Satellite images show wider hull sections at Huludao, which would make
sense for the new SSBN that is expected to be larger and heavier than
the Type 094 (Sutton Citation2021). However, we could not confirm
whether the new facilities at Huludao correspond to the larger Type 096
SSBN or a new unknown attack submarine (see Figure 6).

As with all new designs, the Type 096 is expected to be quieter than its
predecessor. Some experts even believe it could be as quiet as Russia's
new Borei-class SSBNs (Carlson and Wang Citation2023, 30). Although that
would be a significant technological leap for China, The Financial Times
reported in September 2024 that, according to US naval researchers,
Russia was providing technological assistance to China to achieve a
quieter propulsion system for its Type 096 submarines (Foy et al.
Citation2024). Some anonymous defense sources have speculated the Type
096 will carry 24 missiles (M. Chan Citation2020), but no public
official sources have confirmed this. Current and projected missile
inventories seem to indicate that the new SSBN will more likely carry 12
to 16 missiles. The Pentagon's 2024 report stated that the Type 096
SSBNs "will reportedly be armed with a follow-on longer range SLBM," and
that these SLBMs can be MIRVed (US Department of Defense Citation2024,
53, 88).

Given that China's SSBNs are assumed to have a service life of
approximately 30 to 40 years, the US Department of Defense expects that
the Type 094 and Type 096 boats will operate concurrently (US Department
of Defense Citation2024, 56). If confirmed, this could potentially
result in a future fleet of eight to 10 SSBNs. All of China's six
SSBNs---and several attack submarines---are based at the Yalong naval
base on Hainan Island where China appears to have completed construction
of two additional piers to accommodate more submarines.

[The Pentagon's 2022 report indicated that China had begun
"near-continuous at-sea deterrence patrols with its six JIN class SSBNs"
in 2021]{.underline} (US Department of Defense Citation2022b, 96), and
the 2024 report asserted that China "probably continued to conduct"
these patrols (US Department of Defense Citation2024, 104). [The term
"near-continuous" implies that the SSBN fleet is not on patrol all the
time but that **at least one boat is deployed
intermittently**]{.underline}. The term "deterrence patrol" could imply
that the submarine at sea has nuclear weapons onboard, although US
officials have not explicitly stated so. [Giving custody of nuclear
warheads to deployed submarines during peacetime would constitute a
significant departure from Chinese declaratory policy and a significant
change for China's Central Military Commission, which has historically
been reluctant to hand out nuclear warheads to the armed
services.]{.underline}

[To fully develop a survivable sea-based nuclear deterrent posture,
**[China]{.mark} is [presumably improving]{.mark} its
[command-and-control]{.mark} system [to ensure reliable
communication]{.mark} with the SSBNs** when needed and prevent the crew
from launching nuclear weapons without authorization]{.underline}.
Moreover, **[the SSBN fleet will have to operate safely in patrol areas
from where its missiles can reach intended targets]{.underline}**.
Western military officials have privately stated that the United States,
Japan, Australia, and the United Kingdom "are already attempting to
track the movements of China's missile submarines as if they are fully
armed and on deterrence patrols" (Torode and Lague Citation2019).
Whenever they are in the South China Sea, [China's [SSBNs]{.mark}
typically appear to be **[accompanied by]{.mark} a [protection
detail]{.mark}**, including surface warships and aircraft]{.underline}
(and possibly attack submarines) **[[capable of tracking adversarial
sub]{.mark}marine[s]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Torode and Lague
Citation2019).

Given the noise level of the SSBNs, it seems likely that China during
conflict would keep the submarines inside a protected "bastion" in the
South China Sea or the Bohai Sea (US Department of Defense Citation2024,
104). Even with the JL-3 SLBM, the SSBNs would not be able to target the
continental United States from the South China Sea. To target the
northwestern parts of the continental United States, they would have to
sail far north, likely to the Bohai Sea.

[[**China** **developed** **several types of nuclear bombs** and]{.mark}
used [**aircraft** to deliver]{.mark} at **least [12]{.mark} of the
nuclear [weapons]{.mark}** that it **detonated in its nuclear testing
program**]{.underline} between 1965 and 1979. Later, however, the
People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) nuclear mission became
dormant as the rocket force improved and older intermediate-range
bombers were unlikely to be useful or effective in the event of a
nuclear conflict. While we previously estimated that China maintained a
small inventory of gravity bombs for potential contingency use by
aircraft, we assess that this mission no longer exists and that China no
longer retains gravity bombs in its nuclear arsenal.

The [[**PLAAF's** nuclear **mission**]{.mark} remained dormant until
approximately 201]{.underline}7--2018, when, **[[coincid]{.mark}ing
[with]{.mark} a renewed [emphasis on]{.mark} nuclear aircraft
[modernization]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the US Department of Defense
reported in 2018 that the PLAAF "has been newly re-assigned a nuclear
mission" (US Department of Defense Citation2018a, 75, 34). [This [new
mission]{.mark} appears to be currently [centered around]{.mark} China's
current **[H-6]{.mark} "Badger" [bomber]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [China
has **hundreds**]{.underline}]{.mark} [**of these aircraft** in more
than **eight distinct variants**; however, [only **one**]{.mark} of
these variants was **[assessed to be nuclear-capable: the
H-6N.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

The H-6N is distinct from other variants of the H-6 in that it
incorporates a nose-mounted in-flight refueling probe, allowing it to
travel much further (Rupprecht Citation2019). Notably, however, the H-6N
airframe modification includes the removal of the bomb bay, supporting
the conclusion that China's legacy gravity bomb mission has indeed
ended. In November 2024, [**[China and Russia conducted]{.mark} joint
air [drills]{.mark}** that, for the first time, **[included]{.mark} the
[participation]{.mark} of the H-6N**]{.underline} (Global Times
Citation2024).

[The modified fuselage of the H-6N [can
**accommodate**]{.mark}]{.underline} air-launched ballistic missiles
(**[[ALBMs]{.underline}]{.mark}**). China is developing at least two
types of ALBMs, **[[both]{.mark} of which appear to be [variants of
land- or sea-based]{.mark} ballistic [missiles]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
The 2PZD--21 (also sometimes called the KD-21) ALBM appears to be a
wing-mounted air-launched version of the YJ-21 sea-launched anti-ship
ballistic missile, indicating it likely has a conventional strike role
(Panda Citation2019; Rupprecht Citation2024).

**[China's other ALBM]{.underline}**, referred to by the US Department
of Defense [as "**[nuclear-capable]{.mark}**,"]{.underline} was
previously designated by the United States as CH-AS-X-13. (It is
possible, but unconfirmed, that the X has since been removed from the
designation, given the system is now deployed.) The missile was spotted
in video footage from 2020 and 2022, in which the aircraft appeared to
carry a hypersonic glide vehicle very similar to the one carried by the
DF-17 medium-range ballistic missile (OedoSoldier Citation2020;
Rupprecht Citation2022). However, the Pentagon's 2024 China Military
Power report specifically noted that the ALBM "appears to be armed with
a maneuvering reentry vehicle," suggesting that the two payloads are
distinct (US Department of Defense Citation2024, 105).

Following at least five developmental and user tests, the Defense
Intelligence Agency assessed in August 2024 that the CH-AS-X-13 has now
been deployed (Defense Intelligence Agency Citation2024, vi). [The
[Pentagon assessed that]{.mark} the deployment of the nuclear [ALBM
provides China "with]{.mark} a [viable nuclear 'triad' of delivery
systems]{.mark} dispersed across land, sea, and air forces"]{.underline}
(US Department of Defense Citation2019, 67). Yet the Chinese "triad" is
much less complete or capable than the U.S. and Russian triads.

Currently, only one PLAAF unit is publicly known to have a nuclear
mission: the 106th Brigade at Neixiang Air Base in the southwestern part
of Henan province. Over the past five years, the base has been modified
extensively, including the addition of large tunnel entrances into a
nearby mountain wide enough to comfortably accommodate the H-6N bomber
(see Figure 7). Civilian video footage from October 2020 appears to show
an H-6N bomber flying with the possible new ALBM just outside of
Neixiang Air Base, one of China's only airfields with an adjacent air
defense site (Lee Citation2020a, Citation2020b; Rupprecht and Dominguez
Citation2020). The numbers of H-6N bombers and their assigned nuclear
weapons are unknown, but we cautiously estimate that 20 aircraft are
assigned up to 20 missiles. It is unknown how many nuclear bomber
brigades China plans to establish, but satellite imagery shows
significant construction as well as some H-6 bomber operations at Lu'an
Air Base in the eastern part of the Anhui province.

To eventually replace the H-6, China is developing a stealth bomber with
a longer range and improved capabilities. [The [Pentagon
estimates]{.mark} that the [new bomber]{.mark}, known as H-20, will
[have both nuclear and conventional capability]{.mark} and a range
[of]{.mark} more than [10,000 k]{.mark}ilo[m]{.mark}eters. [If equipped
with]{.mark} an [aerial refueling capability]{.mark}, the [Pentagon
assesses]{.mark} that the [bomber could potentially]{.mark} have an
[intercontinental range]{.mark}]{.underline} (US Department of Defense
(Citation2023, 92). In early January 2025, a video surfaced on the
Chinese social media platform Weibo allegedly showing the maiden flight
of the H-20 stealth bomber; however, the video has not yet been
authenticated and may be AI-generated, nor has the flight been confirmed
by official sources (前HR本人 Citation2025; Tirpak Citation2025).

mahedhar

Sr. [Capt. Zhang]{.underline} and his coauthors [emphasize that while
the **U.S. system**]{.underline} is highly [effective]{.underline}, it
is **[not without certain vulnerabilities]{.underline}**. [In fact,
these weaknesses have **grown increasingly apparent**]{.underline}, in
part due to "[**proactive**" PRC measures]{.underline}. The [**U.S.
system suffers** from geographic constraints]{.underline}. The Near Seas
are right on [**China's** doorstep]{.underline}, [giving]{.underline}
the PLAN [a significant advantage]{.underline}. In [recent
years]{.underline}, they explain, it has become [**increasingly
difficult** for U.S]{.underline}. manned platforms [to conduct
**reconnaissance**]{.underline} close to the Chinese coast.
[Indeed]{.underline}, the "[survival space" for U.S]{.underline} mobile
and fixed unmanned systems within the First Island Chain [has been
shrinking]{.underline}. Additionally, the [authors describe a
"**stalemate**" between China and the U.S]{.underline}. in the ability
to "[**seal off**" the three main straits]{.underline} between Taiwan
and the Philippines (Bashi Channel, Balintang Channel, and Babuyan
Channel). Within the First Island Chain, [**China has the advantage** in
terms of force disposition]{.underline} and the "battlefield situation,"
and "to a certain degree, [it possesses the initiative."]{.underline}

The [authors assert that]{.underline} the U[.S. lacks **sufficient
forces** to achieve its]{.underline} assumed [objective]{.underline} [of
"unilateral transparency"]{.underline} [at]{.underline} all [times
and]{.underline} in all [places]{.underline}. The [**E**ast **C**hina
**S**ea and]{.underline} the [**S**outh **C**hina **S**ea]{.underline}
encompass vast areas with complex undersea [environments,
posing]{.underline} a particular [**challenge** for U.S. surface and
subsurface surveillance forces]{.underline}. Moreover,
[because]{.underline} the "[**battle lines**" are so
**extended**]{.underline}, the [**U.S. Navy simply lacks** the necessary
assets to cover it all]{.underline}. [Air- and space-based platforms
face their own problems with weather and **limited detection
range**]{.underline}. The authors further argue that the [location of
individual "nodes" in the U.S. undersea surveillance system can be
located and "**removed**]{.underline}." [U.S bases and ships in rear
areas suffer **weak defensive capabilities**]{.underline}; thus, as the
authors write, they [could be targeted at "key moments]{.underline},"
presumably at the start of a conflict. [Air, surface, and subsurface
nodes]{.underline} in waters near China are [being "**squeezed**" by
Chinese forces]{.underline}, resulting in a [**reduction** in the
**overall functionality** of the system]{.underline}. In recent years,
the authors point out, the U.S. Navy has had to step up investment in
equipment and manpower in important straits and waters, which they
describe as a costly and perhaps futile endeavor.

#### China [won't care]{.underline} because new improvements are [coming now]{.underline}

**Martinson '25** \[Ryan, June 29; Assistant Professor in the China
Maritime Studies Institute at the Naval War College; The Maritime
Executive, "China is Preparing to Counter U.S. Submarine Surveillance
System,"
https://maritime-executive.com/editorials/china-is-preparing-to-counter-u-s-submarine-surveillance-system\]mahedhar

Second, the [authors call for]{.underline} the [PLAN to **develop** the
technologies needed to **counter the U.S. system**]{.underline}. The
[first priority]{.underline} should be [capabilities for "**finding and
fixing**" key nodes]{.underline}, especially "small, quiet targets,"
presumably [referring to **UUVs**]{.underline}. They call for
[developing "**detection arrays** and reconnaissance and **surveillance
networks**]{.underline}" that [integrate acoustic, magnetic, optical,
and electronic sensors]{.underline}. In their view, [China]{.underline}
also needs to [**incorporate artificial intelligence** and
data]{.underline} to support efforts to find, identify, evaluate, and
counter and [destroy the components of the U.S. undersea surveillance
system]{.underline}. To be successful, [China]{.underline} will need to
rely on support from civilian scientists and engineers, [achieving
"**civil-military fusion**."]{.underline}

Third, the [PLAN]{.underline} must [focus on **training** and
**readiness**]{.underline}. Specifically, it should conduct [training
centered on "surveying, **paralyzing, and destroying**" U.S.
equipment.]{.underline} Before that can happen, it needs to develop a
clear [understanding of the U.S. **u**ndersea **s**urveillance
**s**ystem]{.underline}. The authors call for conducting surveys of
shipping channels and "special reconnaissance missions," and using
side-scan sonar and high-frequency imaging sonar to perform detailed
inspections of important straits, waterways, ports, and "suspicious
ocean areas" ---presumably to [**locate hidden nodes** in the U.S.
system]{.underline}. Civilian and military specialists should complete
studies of waters where U.S. ocean [surveillance ships frequently
operate to]{.underline} better [**grasp the types**, numbers, and
locations of the **equipment** they deploy]{.underline}.

The authors argue that the [PLAN]{.underline} needs to [conduct
**specialized training** to better enable it to **confront the U.S.**
undersea surveillance system]{.underline}. To that end, it must
[accelerate the **acquisition of equipment**]{.underline} and devices to
[destroy and disrupt enemy space]{.underline}-based,
[sea]{.underline}-based, and **[underwater surveillance
nodes]{.underline}**. In their view, China needs to [**develop UUVs**
that can locate enemy underwater arrays]{.underline} and interfere with
and damage them. Regarding training practices, the authors argue that
the PLAN should "use the enemy to train the troops," a practice that
favors simulated hostile engagements with actual foreign forces to hone
China's own warfighting skills.1

#### New Subs are [untraceable]{.underline}

**Griffin '23** \[Matthew, December 21; Founder and Futurist in Chief of

On its part, **[China]{.underline}** has been making [concerted efforts
to **bolster its submarine fleet** with a focus on]{.underline} lowering
-- or [essentially **eliminating -- detectability** by the **U**nited
**S**tates Navy and its regional **allies**]{.underline}, especially in
the Pacific. For instance, [the **Type-039C sub** is]{.underline}
believed to be [**totally undetectable** and has the kind of **stealth
contouring** used in stealth aircraft]{.underline}, as previously noted
by observers.

More pertinently, there were **[reports]{.underline}** in August 2022
[that the **PLA Navy**]{.underline} had [stationed this **latest attack
submarine** in its **E**ast **S**ea **F**leet]{.underline}. For
perspective, the [**E**ast **S**ea **F**leet submarine sites are located
**roughly 500 kilometers**]{.underline} (310 miles) south [of the main
Taiwanese Island]{.underline}. It also contends with the network of
islands that make up Japan, which [serves as a **natural barrier**
between the open Ocean]{.underline}.

Not just that, **[China's naval presence]{.underline}**, including its
conventional and nuclear submarine operations, has vastly [expanded in
the Indo-Pacific region]{.underline}. This has been a primary reason
behind the Australian decision to sign the AUKUS deal for purchasing
Virginia-class nuke submarines from the United States, with design
assistance from the United Kingdom.

### Economy

#### It would trigger global economic collapse.

**Freymann \'24** \[Eyck; Hoover fellow at Stanford University; Hugo
Bromley, research fellow at the Center for Geopolitics at the University
of Cambridge, December 31, 2024; \"China-Taiwan War: America\'s
Strategic Dilemma,\" The New York Times,
https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/31/opinion/china-taiwan-war-america.html\]

[[If China forces]{.mark} a [**confrontation** over
Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}, which Beijing claims as its own territory,
[the United States will need to respond decisively: [The implications
are enormous]{.mark}, potentially [including]{.mark} a global
**[economic crisis]{.mark}** far worse than]{.underline} the shock
caused by the [Covid]{.underline}-19 pandemic.

Right now, America isn't ready.

As a report from a House panel concluded last year: "[The United States
lacks a contingency plan for the economic and financial impacts of
conflict]{.underline}" with China.

Addressing this lack of preparation must be a bipartisan priority. The
incoming administration must work with Congress and allied governments
to develop a coherent plan that clearly outlines a vision for the global
economy during and after a crisis that is anchored in American economic
leadership.

[[The]{.mark} most obvious [economic implications relate to
**semiconductors**. T]{.mark}aiwan [S]{.mark}emiconductor
[M]{.mark}anufacturing [C]{.mark}ompany [produces]{.mark} about **[90
percent]{.mark}** of the world's most advanced computer
chips]{.underline}. Some are now made in Arizona, but T.S.M.C.'s most
cutting-edge chips are still produced in Taiwan. Industries from autos
to medical devices depend on these chips; [[if Taiwanese **chip
production** is disabled, the global economy]{.mark} could [be
plunged]{.mark} [into a **deep slump**]{.mark}]{.underline}. If
T.S.M.C.'s factories fall into China's hands --- it relies on T.S.M.C.'s
chips, too --- [[**Beijing** could seize a]{.mark} **[competitive
edge]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [including]{.underline}]{.mark} [in the
[development of **a**]{.mark}rtificial **[i]{.mark}**ntelligence
technology]{.underline}, and have American and European manufacturers
over a barrel.

But an invasion or quarantine of Taiwan matters economically for reasons
far beyond semiconductor production. Two commitments form the basis of
the economic order in the Indo-Pacific: The first is America's warning,
in the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, that [[any violent]{.mark}
[move]{.mark} to threaten Taiwan's political or economic autonomy [would
be]{.mark} a matter [of **"grave concern"**]{.mark} [to the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}. The second is
China's commitment, in 1982, to pursue unification with Taiwan through
peaceful means, which Mr. Xi himself describes as part of the political
foundation of U.S.-China relations.

[If the United States failed to act in response to an
invasion]{.underline} or quarantine, [[allies]{.mark} [including
**Japan**]{.mark}, **[So]{.mark}uth** **[Ko]{.mark}rea**, [**Australia**
and]{.mark} the **[Philippines]{.mark}** would become more
[vulnerable]{.mark}]{.underline} to economic coercion in turn. America's
relationships with its closest allies would be called into question.

The United States, then, needs economic contingency plans for any Taiwan
crisis.

Economic sanctions like those America has employed against Iran and
Russia might seem superficially attractive, but because of China's
central role in global supply chains, similar efforts that disrupt its
ability to trade would be self-defeating.

Indeed, [imposing **sweeping [sanctions]{.mark}** on China [would
**undermine** the]{.mark} international **[economic system]{.mark}**
that the United States is uniquely positioned to protect]{.underline}.
Allies and neutral countries alike might refuse to cooperate with an
American-led sanctions regime, given the huge costs of compliance for
their own economies. Many Americans would find the probable rise in
prices of consumer goods untenable.

Our leaders must face reality: [[China cannot be sidelined]{.mark} or
expelled from the global economy]{.underline}. Instead, [the United
States needs an **affirmative vision** for how it would respond in a
Taiwan crisis to defend the global economy]{.underline}. Such a plan
would involve three key elements.

During and after any Taiwan crisis, markets would be in a state of
panic. The Federal Reserve would need to coordinate with other
countries' central banks to provide liquidity to prevent global
financial collapse. And to sustain business confidence in the
international trading system, the United States and its allies should
establish and fund an Economic Security Cooperation Board, open to all
nations except rogue states. This board would combine financial support
for member countries with a framework for enforcing trade policies
rooted in American national security interests.

[Washington would]{.underline} also [have to work with allies on a crash
**reshoring** of **critical products** from China]{.underline} on which
America and other countries have become heavily dependent, including
active pharmaceutical ingredients and drones. (In September, the House
passed the Biosecure Act, legislation aimed at strategic decoupling from
China in the area of biotechnology, but that has stalled in the Senate.)

To reduce reliance on noncritical consumer goods from China --- think
toasters and toys --- the United States should adopt a gradual approach.
A system of predictable, incrementally increasing tariffs on Chinese
imports could guide manufacturers, importers and retailers to move
production out of China without causing sudden inflationary pressures
--- unlike Donald Trump's proposed approach of threatening immediate
high tariffs to bargain for concessions. Washington shouldn't try to
direct the production of noncritical goods. Instead, it should work to
create a level playing field, allowing countries to compete to attract
production that moves out of China.

Putting this vision into effect would not be easy. China would very
likely retaliate, including by punishing foreign companies in China.
Still, building an inclusive economic security framework would be the
best defense against the threat of disruption to trade and financial
markets. To maintain international solidarity, a U.S.-led coalition
would need to aid all countries that are the target of Chinese economic
coercion.

Gaining political support for the kind of spending this would require
wouldn't be easy. A reasonable first step would be congressional
hearings on the economic impact of a confrontation over Taiwan, with the
eventual goal of drafting legislation that can be pulled off the shelf
if a crisis arrives.

Whatever the answers, Washington needs to address these questions before
something happens. Remember: [[If China invades]{.underline}]{.mark} or
quarantines [Taiwan, [it wouldn't just be]{.mark} targeting [one
island]{.mark} nation]{.underline}. [[It would]{.underline}]{.mark} be
seeking to forcibly [reshape the Indo-Pacific regional order and
[undermine the]{.mark} rules-based **global
[economy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Without a plan, [a Taiwan crisis risks
**undermining** the foundations of American **prosperity** and
security]{.underline}.

### Laundry List

#### It would be catastrophic.

**Erickson \'24** \[Andrew S.; Professor of Strategy at the Naval War
College; February 16, 2024; \"The Taiwan Catastrophe: What America---and
the World---Would Lose If China Took the Island,\" Foreign Affairs,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/taiwan-catastrophe\]

[[Washington]{.underline}]{.mark} and its allies [[face]{.mark} many
potential **[geopolitical catastrophes]{.mark}**]{.underline} over the
next decade, [[but]{.mark} nearly all pale in comparison to]{.underline}
what would ensue if China annexed or invaded
**[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Such an outcome, one U.S. official
put [it, "would [be a **disaster**]{.mark} of utmost importance to the
United States,]{.underline} and I am convinced that time is of the
essence." That was General Douglas MacArthur in June 1950, then
overseeing occupied Japan and worrying in a top-secret memo to
Washington about the prospect that the Communists in China might seek to
vanquish their Nationalist enemies once and for all. More than 70 years
later, MacArthur's words ring truer than ever.

Then, as now, Taiwan's geography matters. A
self-governing Taiwan anchors Japan's defense and denies China a
springboard from which it could threaten U.S. allies in the western
Pacific. But unlike in the 1950s, when Taiwan was under the
authoritarian rule of Chiang Kai-Shek, today the island is a full-blown
liberal democracy---whose subjugation to Beijing's totalitarianism would
hinder democratic aspirations across the region, including in China
itself. And unlike in MacArthur's time, Taiwan today is economically
crucial to the rest of the world, by virtue of its role as the primary
producer of advanced microchips. A war over the island could easily
cause a global depression. Yet another key difference between
MacArthur's time and today is the flourishing of a wide network of U.S.
allies across the Indo-Pacific, countries that rely on U.S. support for
their security. A Chinese seizure of Taiwan could trigger a race among
nations to develop their own nuclear arsenals as U.S. security
guarantees lost credibility.

In recent years, Chinese leader Xi Jinping has shown an impatient
determination to resolve Taiwan's status in a way his predecessors never
did. He has ordered a meteoric military buildup, instructing Chinese
forces to give him by 2027 a full range of options for unifying Taiwan.
These signals are triggering debate in Washington and elsewhere about
whether Taiwan is strategically and economically important enough to
merit protection through the most challenging of contingencies. But make
no mistake: whether one cares about the future of democracy in Asia or
prefers to ponder only the cold math of realpolitik, Taiwan's fate
matters.

DEFENDING DEMOCRACY

When MacArthur wrote his memo in June 1950, Communist insurgencies were
convulsing Southeast Asia, and the Korean Peninsula was teetering on the
brink of war. The military utility of Taiwan---then called Formosa in
the West---beckoned. "Formosa in the hands of the Communists," he wrote,
"can be compared to an unsinkable aircraft carrier and submarine tender
\[a ship that supplies submarines\] ideally located to accomplish Soviet
offensive strategy and at the same time checkmate counteroffensive
operations by United States Forces based on Okinawa and the
Philippines." MacArthur explained how imperial Japan, which ruled Taiwan
from 1895 to 1945, had used the island as "a springboard for military
aggression" beyond East Asia and warned that Communist forces could do
the same.

But MacArthur was thinking about far more than basing, emphasizing that
Taiwan's people should be offered "an opportunity to develop their own
political future in an atmosphere unfettered by the dictates of a
Communist police state." He even highlighted Taiwan's importance as a
net exporter of food in postwar Asia and as a future "prosperous
economic unit."

The dynamics MacArthur highlighted remain relevant today, some more than
ever. Eventually, Taiwan's citizens did indeed seize the opportunity "to
develop their own political future" by building a full-fledged democracy
off China's coast. If that system were extinguished, Beijing would have
erased the world's first liberal democracy whose founders include many
people of Chinese heritage---and, with it, living proof that there is a
workable, appealing alternative to Beijing's totalitarianism. In 1996,
the Taiwanese voted for the first time to directly elect their
president, whose maximum tenure was newly shortened from two six-year
terms to two four-year terms. Four years later, they elected an
opposition-party president, ending the political monopoly of the
Kuomintang, the party that had ruled the island since 1945. Over the
past two-plus decades, democracy has only deepened its roots in Taiwan,
which enjoys an orderly transition of political power every four to
eight years.

Taiwan is ranked by the Economist Intelligence Unit as the world's
eighth most "fully democratic" polity, ahead of every country in Asia
and even the much older democracies of the United Kingdom and the United
States. Its people enjoy freedom of speech and freedom of association.
Taiwan also has one of the most economically equitable societies
anywhere, with a relatively low disparity in income distribution despite
having among the highest median incomes. Its per capita GDP overtook
Japan's in 2023.

Over the past two-plus decades, democracy has deepened its roots in
Taiwan.

Taiwan ranks sixth in the world for gender equality, according to a UN
Development Program index. Women hold more than 40 percent of seats in
Taiwan's national legislature, the highest percentage in Asia and well
ahead of the United States, where just 28 percent of members of Congress
are women. Taiwanese have twice elected a female president, several of
its leading cities are led by female mayors, and the incoming vice
president is female. Taiwan's respect for the rights of indigenous
peoples (with designated legislative seats) and minority groups stands
out, too. In 2019, Taiwan became the first society in Asia to legalize
same-sex marriage.

[[Taiwan is a **democratic standout**]{.mark} in]{.underline} another
important respect: its [faith in democracy]{.underline} is growing at a
time when many democracies are doubting their system of government. A
Taiwan Foundation for Democracy poll in 2023 found that three-quarters
of Taiwanese believe that although there are problems with democracy, it
remains the best system. And [in a refreshing contrast with the United
States, younger]{.underline} people were especially likely to hold that
view.

[It is [difficult to overstate]{.mark} the [significance of
Taiwan's]{.mark} **strong [democracy]{.mark}**, given the political
realities just across the Taiwan Strait, where more than 1.4 billion
people sharing]{.underline} many linguistic and cultural
[traditions]{.underline} are [[subject to **totalitarian rule**]{.mark}.
Numerous [Chinese citizens draw inspiration from]{.mark} Taiwan's
[political transition]{.mark} from martial law to democracy, [which
**offers a model**]{.mark} for what China could become]{.underline}.
Fearing precisely such a result, officials in Beijing have long tried to
caricature Taiwan as slavishly imitating Western forms of governance.
But it is actually the Chinese Communist Party that is doing so by
clinging to its Marxist-Leninist system, a discredited political model
imported from Europe. A Chinese street protester caught on video in late
2022 highlighted the absurdity of the accusation that he was manipulated
by foreign forces. "What 'foreign forces' are you referring to?" he
asked. "Is it Marx and Engels? Is it Stalin? Is it Lenin?"

[[The loss of Taiwan]{.mark} as a **democratic alternative** would end
the experiment with popular, multiparty self-governance]{.underline} by
a society with significant Chinese heritage, [with [**bad tidings**
for]{.mark} the possibility of [democracy]{.mark} in China and [far
beyond]{.mark}]{.underline}.

CHIP WARS

[[A Chinese takeover]{.mark} of Taiwan [would devastate
**semiconductor**]{.mark} manufacturing---the backbone of]{.underline}
almost every strategically important **[[industry]{.underline}]{.mark}**
today [and the lifeblood of]{.underline} our [big data]{.underline}
world. [The planet now produces approximately \$600 billion worth of
chips each year. Those chips end up in products]{.underline}---from
smartphones to cars to supercomputers---that are collectively
[worth]{.underline} multiple [trillions]{.underline} of dollars,
[and]{.underline} the services delivered by these [devices [amount to
**tens of trillions**]{.mark}]{.underline} annually. The very latest
generation chips (those with circuits five nanometers or smaller) are
produced in only two places: Taiwan (by Taiwan Semiconductor
Manufacturing Company, or TSMC) and, to a much lesser extent, South
Korea (by Samsung). Taiwan now accounts for roughly half the global
production capacity for all semiconductors and a much higher
proportion---perhaps 90 percent---for the most advanced chips. Put
differently, Taiwan's market share for advanced semiconductors is
roughly [twice the share of oil produced by OPEC]{.underline}.

Much as cheap Russian energy fueled German industry for decades, so,
too, have abundant Taiwanese semiconductors propelled global
technological progress, the artificial intelligence boom, and the rise
of trillion-dollar U.S. tech titans such as Apple, Google, Microsoft,
and Nvidia. Thanks largely to Taiwanese manufacturers' efficiency gains,
the unit costs of computing power have fallen exponentially in recent
decades. The cutting-edge chips that are (or will be) used in Apple's
latest generation smartphones, for instance, now cost less than \$100
apiece. Combining high-powered computing capabilities with low unit
costs generates a virtuous cycle of discovery and productivity. As Eric
Schmidt, the former CEO and chair of Google, put it in Foreign
Affairs last year, "Faster airplanes did not build faster airplanes, but
faster computers will help build faster computers."

The loss of Taiwanese chips would shatter that cycle. Unlike with oil
and gas, commodities whose source can be switched with relative ease, no
such fungibility exists for high-end semiconductors. It would take years
to build and activate high-end chip production facilities to replace
Taiwanese foundries. Each month of delay in resuming chip supplies at
pre-crisis levels would cause compounding global economic losses and
stall progress in critical fields, from medicine to materials science.
In a best-case scenario, inferior, far less energy-efficient substitutes
would require massively increased electricity use merely to keep society
functioning. In the more likely scenario, global computing power would
effectively be capped for a prolonged period, wreaking profound economic
and political damage.

Losing access to Taiwanese semiconductors would shave five to ten
percent off U.S. GDP.

Even if China captured Taiwanese foundries intact, they would probably
struggle mightily to reach prewar production levels. Disruptions to
electricity, software updates, and the supply of foreign equipment,
maintenance, and engineering---not to mention the likely flight overseas
by many of Taiwan's most knowledgeable semiconductor experts---would
throttle Taiwan's chip factories. For months or even years, occupied
production facilities would face grave difficulties, especially given
the postwar economic sanctions that the world's democracies would
impose.

The global economic convulsion that would follow an interruption of
Taiwanese chips could well exceed those caused by the global financial
crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. The hedge fund manager Ken Griffin has
estimated that losing access to Taiwanese semiconductors would shave
five to ten percent off U.S. GDP. "It's an immediate Great Depression,"
he assessed in 2022.

If Taiwan's chip factories somehow remained intact and operational,
Beijing would control virtually the entire world's supply of the most
advanced semiconductors. If, on the other hand, they struggled to resume
operations, as is more likely, the world would have to settle for much
inferior older-generation chips---of which China is on track to become
the largest producer.

Certainly, China's economy would suffer major setbacks if Taiwan's
high-end chips disappeared from global markets. But so would the
economies of the rest of the industrialized world. Beijing's
Marxist-Leninist rulers, who regard power as zero-sum, may consider this
a price worth paying---especially if China ultimately emerged as the
world's leading chip producer. Indeed, Xi and his advisers might
plausibly conclude that China could weather, and ultimately leverage,
such a Taiwanese production halt better than any other country.

FROM ORDER TO DISORDER

[Whether through outright war or intense coercion, [**Chinese
annexation** of Taiwan]{.mark} against the will of its 24 million people
would **[disrupt the global order]{.mark}**]{.underline} in ways unseen
since World War II. For starters, [[Beijing]{.mark} might [not stop
after]{.mark} annexing [Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Russian
President Vladimir Putin has demonstrated in Ukraine, [[the leaders
of]{.mark} [**revanchist powers** are not known for appetite
suppression. China]{.mark} is grabbing land in Bhutan and [engages in
**border skirmishes**]{.mark} with India. It pursues disputes with all
its maritime neighbors]{.underline}. It is actively challenging Japan's
claims over the islands that Tokyo administers and calls the Senkaku
(and which China calls the Diaoyu), as well as the territorial claims of
five other governments in the South China Sea. Ominously, official maps,
propaganda, and statements question the legitimacy of Japanese
sovereignty over the Ryukyu island chain---including Okinawa---and of
Russia's control over parts of its far east.

[[Japan would be]{.mark} in a **far [weaker]{.mark}** position to defend
its territory]{.underline} were Taiwan under Beijing's control. Japan's
defensive strategy relies on the ability to threaten People's Liberation
Army forces that approach, penetrate, or venture beyond the "first
island chain," the long string of Pacific archipelagoes that includes
Japan and Taiwan. To ensure Japan's security, the entire chain must
remain in friendly hands. If Taiwan hosted PLA bases---the "unsinkable
aircraft carrier and submarine tender" MacArthur warned of---Japan would
become acutely insecure. PLA doctrine stresses precisely this point. As
one air force textbook emphasizes, "As soon as Taiwan is reunified with
mainland China, Japan's maritime lines of communication will fall
completely within the striking ranges of China's fighters and bombers."
China made its capabilities clear during extensive PLA exercises in
August 2022, when one of several ballistic missiles it fired landed in
the water near Japan's Yonaguni Island, only 68 miles from Taiwan.

The fall of Taiwan would be even worse for the Philippines and other
Southeast Asian countries. Beijing would have the power to complicate
U.S. access to East Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Indian Ocean---the
littoral of the most populous, economically active part of the world.
The United States could begin to resemble, as the diplomat Henry
Kissinger once put it to one of us (Pottinger), "an island off the coast
of the world."

Worse, by establishing an indisputably dominant position in East Asia,
Xi could pursue preeminence globally. The military resources, planning,
and training that have long been concentrated on taking Taiwan could,
following a successful annexation, be used for projecting power
throughout continental Asia, the Pacific Ocean, and the Indian Ocean.
China could even attempt to make inroads in the Atlantic Ocean, where
the PLA already operates tracking, telemetry, and command stations in
Argentina and Namibia. Angola, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon are among
the 19-odd countries with which Beijing has been pursuing military
facilities beyond the ones it already has in Djibouti and Cambodia.
America's own history shows how achieving regional preeminence
facilitates global power projection. Only by dominating the Western
Hemisphere in the nineteenth century was the United States able to
become a global superpower in the twentieth.

[It is impossible to predict precisely how China might act as a global
power, but **[decades of data]{.mark}** [suggest]{.mark} it would take
[a]{.mark} far [less benign approach]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}than
the United States. At an Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit
in Vietnam in 2010, China's foreign minister, Yang Jiechi, foreshadowed
future bullying when he announced, "China is a big country and you are
small countries, and that is a fact." Beijing followed suit with the de
facto annexation and outright construction of territory throughout the
South China Sea and a massive military buildup. China has declared its
goal to become a "world-class" military and to use its armed forces to
defend its interests wherever it defines them around the world. And
those interests are set to expand, with Beijing having unveiled a
"global security initiative," a "global development initiative," and a
"global civilization initiative." These sprawling programs promote
Chinese-led alternatives to Western alliances and Western economic and
political models. As a 2023 State Council document explains, they
"showcase the global vision of the Communist Party of China."

Herein lies a danger similar to the one U.S. President Franklin
Roosevelt warned of in 1939: "So soon as one nation dominates Europe,
that nation will be able to turn to the world sphere." Today, Asia has
replaced Europe as the world's center of economic and technological
gravity. The region's domination by a hostile power today would be
equally dangerous to U.S. interests. Asian countries would not eagerly
accept Beijing's diktats, but absent Washington's intervention, their
options would be limited. China alone commands an economy meaningfully
larger than that of all its Asian neighbors combined, India included.
China's navy, meanwhile, boasts firepower second only to that of the
U.S. Navy. And it is relatively concentrated: imagine if the entire U.S.
naval fleet primarily operated in an arc from New York to New Orleans.

With a U.S. counterbalancer committed to freedom of navigation and
economic access, all Asian countries can prosper---including China, as
decades of economic growth demonstrate. But were China to annex Taiwan
and proceed to push the United States out of Asia, even the most
powerful countries would see their economic sovereignty and long-term
national autonomy compromised.

THE PROLIFERATION PROBLEM

At that point, another problem would arise: [[having lost faith]{.mark}
in the United States' security commitments]{.underline}, U.S.
[[allies]{.mark} would [face]{.mark}]{.underline} great [[**incentives**
to develop]{.mark} their own **[nuclear weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Ever since China's first nuclear test, in 1964, Washington has been able
to dissuade most East and Southeast Asian countries from going nuclear.
But [an Asia reeling from the **annexation** of [Taiwan]{.mark} would
present very different circumstances and might **[send leaders
scrambling]{.mark}** to acquire nuclear armaments]{.underline} to
protect themselves.

[[**Japan** has the shortest path]{.underline}]{.mark} to developing
nuclear weapons, [boasting both its own facilities for processing
nuclear fuel]{.underline} and what is likely the world's largest
plutonium stockpile. In February 2022, months before he was
assassinated, former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe raised the idea of Japan
engaging in "nuclear sharing," proposing something similar to the
arrangements Washington has with a number of NATO allies, whereby
nuclear weapons are stored on bases in the host country but under U.S.
control. But Japan could go further and develop its own independent
capability. In the words of Vipin Narang, a political scientist now
serving as an official in the Pentagon, [Japan has "a very real, and
potentially swift, pathway to a nuclear weapons]{.underline} arsenal in
the event of a rapid deterioration of Japan's security environment."

[**[So]{.mark}**uth **[Ko]{.mark}**rea]{.underline}, for its part, [[has
a world-class]{.mark} civilian [nuclear program]{.mark}]{.underline},
with 26 reactors in service. Although the country currently lacks the
domestic enrichment or reprocessing facilities required to build nuclear
weapons, its politicians openly debate the question of whether to
develop a nuclear arsenal. And given South Korea's world-class
scientific expertise and industrial base, Seoul could doubtless fashion
deployable fission devices within a handful of years if it so chose.

China's annexation of Taiwan might send leaders in Asia scrambling to
acquire nuclear armaments.

Were Japan or South Korea to go nuclear, [the effects might not stop
there]{.underline}. Leaders in Beijing might conclude that they needed
considerably more than the 1,500 warheads China is expected to have by
2035. Should China decide to expand its arsenal, both the United States
and Russia would likely seek to expand their arsenals, too. India would
probably follow suit; indeed, there are already signs that it is
considering doing so. In December 2022, India tested an updated version
of its Agni-5 ballistic missile, whose range exceeds 4,000
miles---sufficient to reach all of China. If India expanded its nuclear
stockpile, historical patterns suggest its archrival, Pakistan, would
likely seek parity.

[Asian nuclear **[prolif]{.mark}eration** [could even **spill over**
into the Middle East, where **Iran**]{.mark} continues to [edge closer
to **breakout capability**]{.mark}]{.underline}. If two of the United
States' closest Asian allies, Japan and South Korea, became nuclear
weapons states, it would be functionally impossible for Washington to
secure a multinational coalition to punish Iran for building a
bomb---something Iran might be more tempted to try in the chaos that
would follow a takeover of Taiwan. If Iran went nuclear, [[Saudi
Arabia]{.mark} would almost certainly [do so, too]{.mark}]{.underline},
perhaps first through a stopgap sharing agreement with Pakistan and
subsequently by developing a domestic production capability.

[A **nuclear cascade**]{.underline} following a Chinese annexation of
Taiwan [could add hundreds of nuclear warheads or more to stockpiles
globally]{.underline}. Decades of counterproliferation progress would be
lost. Far better that this Pandora's box were never opened in the first
place.

ECONOMIC EXCLUSION

[If China annexed Taiwan, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[could]{.mark} well [lose access to]{.mark} valuable [trade]{.mark} and
investment]{.underline} opportunities in Asia, [[**severely damaging**
the]{.mark} U.S. **[economy]{.mark}**. History shows that regional
hegemons regularly restrict rivals' economic prospects]{.underline}. In
a 2018 Foreign Affairs article about "life in China's Asia," the
political scientist Jennifer Lind noted that in their quest for regional
dominance, such [countries "develop and wield tremendous economic
power]{.underline}." They also "[build massive militaries, expel
external rivals, and use regional institutions]{.underline} and cultural
programs [to entrench their influence]{.underline}."

In case this sort of behavior sounds alien, consider the United States'
own efforts in the nineteenth century and early twentieth century to
enforce the 1823 Monroe Doctrine and extirpate European influence from
the Western Hemisphere. Motivated by a fear of European entry (or
reentry in some cases), Washington engaged in all manner of aggressive
behavior: buying out debts owed to European banks, deploying warships in
the Caribbean, toppling governments, and intervening militarily. Unlike
a fledgling United States, a China buoyed by possession of Taiwan would
have the economic and military means to immediately enforce its own
Monroe Doctrine. And unlike today's United States, China under Xi does
not accept the postwar rules and norms that safeguard the sovereignty of
a superpower's neighbor, no matter its size.

[Chinese attempts to hive off Asia]{.underline}, the world's largest,
most dynamic economic region, [would deal a **devastating blow** to U.S.
economic interests]{.underline}. East Asia and the Pacific account for
[one-third of global GDP]{.underline} in purchasing power parity terms,
a share roughly twice that of the United States. The region's vibrant,
open trading networks would likely degenerate into more of a
hub-and-spoke system, with China as the hub and subjugated countries at
the end of the spokes. In the worst-case scenario, the United States
could lose access to trade volumes with its nine largest Asian trade
partners other than China. This group's two-way goods trade with the
United States was nearly \$940 billion in 2023---about 60 percent larger
than the U.S. goods trade with China itself. U.S. investors might also
lose out. In Asian countries besides China, particularly in Southeast
Asia, the United States is one of the largest sources of invested
capital. Americans have plowed untold sums into factories, data centers,
and real estate properties throughout the region. Because these and
other brick-and-mortar infrastructure are physically immovable, they
would be vulnerable to forced changes of ownership under Chinese
coercion.

[A China that had annexed Taiwan might also accelerate efforts to have
other Asian [countries]{.mark} **[reduce]{.mark}** their [reliance on
the]{.mark} U.S. **[dollar]{.mark}**]{.underline} as a reserve currency.
Most governments in the region would prefer not to be forced to choose
between the dollar and the yuan, just as many of them have tried to
avoid taking sides on the broader competition between the United States
and China. But a less constrained Beijing could plausibly seek to
abolish such a middle course, [[pushing]{.underline}]{.mark} its
[trading partners [to]{.mark} more **widely [use yuan]{.mark}** in their
economies]{.underline} and kicking off a regionwide de-dollarization.

THE NEW WEST BERLIN

In his memoirs, U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower envisioned a dangerous
chain reaction that Taiwan's fall would trigger: "The future security of
Japan, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and even Okinawa would be
placed in jeopardy and the United States' vital interests would suffer
severely." [Consequences that already looked dangerous]{.underline} when
Ike was in the White House 65 years ago would be far more dire today.
Taiwan's annexation in the face of U.S. inaction or ineffective action
would present U.S. allies in Asia and Europe with a nightmare they have
never faced before: Washington proving unable to protect a polity that
is an ally in all but name.

[[**Autocracy** would **surge**]{.mark} ahead in the global
contest]{.underline} of systems. [[An **illiberal**,
China-centric]{.mark} world [order]{.mark} [could **supplant**]{.mark}
the]{.underline} liberal, [U.S.-led system]{.underline} that for 80
years has underpinned remarkable improvement in the human condition.
[[This]{.mark} shift would [**curtail trade**, **limit**]{.mark} India's
[**development**, and crimp middle powers]{.mark}]{.underline},
including important U.S. allies. Moreover, [[China]{.mark}'s quest for
domination abroad would [cement **autocracy at
home**]{.mark}]{.underline}, shrinking the prospects for its own
population. [[The stage for **future warfare**]{.mark} would be
set]{.underline}.

[Taiwan is]{.underline} in a sense [the West Berlin of the new cold
war]{.underline} unfolding between Beijing and the free world. [It is an
outpost of liberty, prosperity, and democracy living in the shadow of an
authoritarian superpower]{.underline}. Just as Stalin tested the free
world 76 years ago by blockading Berlin, [[Xi is]{.mark} now
[testing]{.mark} it with **rising pressure** on
[Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}. Back then, U.S. leadership and major
investment galvanized a four-decade multinational commitment to keep
West Berlin and West Germany free. [The stakes are equally stark today
with Taiwan]{.underline}---and there is no time left to waste.

### Russia Draw-In

#### China will pressure Russia to back their invasion

https://www.twz.com/news-features/how-russia-could-complicate-u-s-efforts-to-defend-taiwan\]

[As a [relationship of convenience between Beijing and Moscow
grows]{.mark} over a mutu[al desire to **change** the **world's power
balance**]{.mark}]{.underline}, there are questions about how much these
two nations would cooperate should China opt to invade Taiwan. [NATO
Secretary General Mark Rutte recently suggested that the [cooperation
could be **significant**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"There's an increasing realization, and let's not be naïve about this:
[If Xi Jinping would attack Taiwan, he would first make sure that he
makes a call to his very junior partner in all of this, Vladimir
Vladimirovich Putin,]{.underline} residing in Moscow, and telling him,
'Hey, I'm going to do this, and I need you to keep them busy in Europe
by attacking NATO territory,'" Rutte told The New York Times on July 5.
"That is most likely the way this will progress."

Rutte was responding to a question about the relationship between U.S.
President Donald Trump and NATO allies. The alliance leader did not
provide a timeline or any other details, other than to say that NATO has
to be "so strong that the Russians will never do this. And second,
working together with the Indo-Pacific --- something President Trump is
very much promoting."

[[Should China]{.mark} decide [to invade Taiwan]{.mark}, there are
[reasons to believe it could **pressure Russia** to assist.]{.mark}
Chief among them is [the **aid** China is providing to]{.mark} the
[Russia]{.mark}n war machine through components and other supplies for
its war on Ukraine. GUR recently claimed that a recovered
[Russian]{.mark} Geran-2 [drone]{.mark} [contained]{.mark} between
**60%** and [**65%** Chinese parts, making them **even more
dangerous.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Chinese invasion will be aided by Russia 

**Oien 24** \[Audrey Oien is a Research Analyst at RANE, primarily
focusing on the Asia-Pacific, "Would Russia Aid China in an Invasion of
Taiwan?" 06/24/2024,
https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2024/06/24/would_russia_aid_china_in_an_invasion_of_taiwan_1039899.html\]

[[If China were to invade]{.mark} Taiwan, [it is **likely**]{.mark} that
[Russia would provide Beijing with **military**, **economic**, or
**political** assistance.]{.mark}]{.underline} While some experts have
argued Ukraine and Taiwan are not the same situation, there are
nonetheless lessons that can be drawn from Russia's war in Ukraine, as
well as insight from U.S. officials that can be drawn upon to come to
this conclusion.

[Over the last several years, [Russia and China have grown
closer]{.mark} in many ways, including through [increased **military
cooperation**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Of the numerous joint exercises
that have been held, ones that stand out are **[joint naval
drills]{.mark}** and air force patrols [over the East China
Sea]{.mark}.]{.underline} The naval drills began in 2022 and are the
closest that joint drills have been held to the Taiwan Strait. Joint
exercises are not a smoking gun, but concern from American officials may
be a reliable indicator that this is worth paying attention to.

In early May, two American intelligence officials testified before the
Senate Armed Services Committee that increased Sino-Russian military
cooperation has prompted new planning in the Department of Defense.
[**[Director of National Intelligence]{.mark}** Avril Haines
[stated]{.mark} that [China and Russia are exercising]{.mark} [together
**in relation** to **Taiwan**]{.mark} for the first time, and that
"[China **definitely** wants Russia to be working with
them]{.mark}.]{.underline}" She then said, "we see no reason why they
wouldn't" work together. Answering a follow-up question from Senator
Mike Rounds, [Haines confirmed that [in the event of a conflict]{.mark}
with Russia or China, [a **second front opening**]{.mark} with the other
[is **possible**]{.mark},]{.underline} with the likelihood depending on
the scenario. U.S. Air Force Lieutenant General Jeffrey Kruse testified
that [Russian and Chinese [military forces "would]{.mark} **certainly
[be cooperative]{.mark}**[," if not
**interoperable**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

But on what grounds would Russia assist China? Why would it be willing
to aid Beijing in an invasion that would likely be met with a response
from the United States and its allies? The most simple answer is because
China did it for Russia. [Russian President Vladimir [Putin is]{.mark}
now [**indebted** to]{.mark} Chinese President [Xi]{.mark} Jinping,
whether he realizes it or not.]{.underline} And no, the debt is not
payable by monetary means. Putin will be able to pay his debts to Xi for
his assistance in a war that has turned Chinese public opinion toward
Ukraine, led to sanctions, and affected Xi's image by providing
assistance if, or when, China invades Taiwan.

To get a better idea of what this assistance could look like, one can
take a look at how China has aided Russia's war in Ukraine. According to
U.S. officials, C[hina has helped supply Russia with dual-use material
like optics, microelectronics, and drone engines to boost Moscow's arms
production, as well as provided Moscow with cruise missiles and machine
tools for ballistic missiles.]{.underline} U.S. intelligence claims that
Russian and Chinese groups have worked together to jointly produce
drones inside Russia. It was also reported that a Chinese government
agency established to promote trade with Russia has been attempting to
source drone detectors and jammers, likely to supply Moscow with. U.S.
officials further claimed that China helped Russia improve satellite and
other space-based capabilities, as well as provided satellite imagery.
Additionally, it was reported that China supplied Russia with 90% of the
chips it imported in 2023 which were used to make missiles, tanks, and
aircraft. The British Defense Minister has also accused China of
providing or preparing to provide Russia with lethal aid.

[Beyond providing this military equipment, [China has continued support
for Russia]{.mark} in its wartime by [working]{.mark} together [to
**avoid taxes** and **evade**]{.mark} Western **[sanctions]{.mark}** on
goods like coppe]{.underline}r. And, China has increased imports of
Russian gas and oil since the war began, as imports from the US, UK, and
EU have dropped due to sanctions. Politically, Ukrainian leader
Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused China of using its influence and diplomats
to help Russia disrupt the 15-16 June peace summit on Ukraine in
Switzerland by encouraging other countries not to attend.

[Russian support during a Chinese invasion of Taiwan could follow in a
similar vein. Or, [Xi]{.mark} may be able to [**pressure Putin** into
providing]{.mark} **something [more ]{.mark}**[than what Beijing has
done for Moscow]{.mark}.]{.underline} Analysts have maintained that
Beijing holds the upper hand in the Sino-Russian partnership. While the
relationship has been described as having no limits, it is not a
relationship between two equals. [[Russia's]{.mark} economic
[dependence]{.mark} on China [puts Putin in a **vulnerable position**,
with **little room** to **say "no."**]{.mark}]{.underline}

https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3315549/beijings-massive-build-raises-threat-taiwan-strait-conflict-nato-chief\]

[[Beijing's "**massive" military build-**]{.mark}**up** increases the
threat of conflict across the Taiwan Strait in a way that could [draw
Russia and]{.mark} thus [European forces **into the fray**]{.mark},
Nato's secretary general warned on Monday.]{.underline}

Speaking to reporters ahead of this week's Nato summit in The Hague,
Mark Rutte also said Nato enjoyed a close relationship with its
Indo-Pacific partners -- namely Japan, South Korea, Australia and New
Zealand -- as it ramped up the member states' defence industrial base.

On the question of whether Nato would follow the US and come to its aid
if Beijing tried to invade Taiwan, Rutte said the group's Indo-Pacific
partners were "very, very aware" of the People's Liberation Army's
"massive" military build-up now under way.

[The Nato chief pointed to several Chinese defence companies ranking
among the world's top arms makers in arguing that [Beijing's expansion
had reached levels]{.mark} that were "[**never" before
seen**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Taiwan holds first live-fire of US hi-tech rocket systems

Rutte said the associated defence industrial production capabilities
could have a "huge impact" on not just the Indo-Pacific region but also
European security.

"They don't do this only because they want to have nice parades in
Beijing. I guess it's there for a reason," he added.

Meanwhile, the Nato chief said, "We're all very worried, of course,
about the situation in Taiwan."

"We also know there is a risk that if the \[mainland\] Chinese will try
anything with Taiwan," he added, Beijing would call in \[Russian
President Vladimir\] "Putin and make sure that the junior partner ...
will keep us busy here \[in Europe\]".

"That is one of the reasons why we have to stand ready. We cannot be
naive. We have to be clear on this, and that is why extra defence is so
important."

[Beijing sees Taiwan as part of China to be reunited **by force** if
necessary.]{.underline}

Most countries, including the US, do not recognise Taiwan as an
independent state, but Washington is opposed to any attempt to take the
self-governed island by force and is committed to supplying it with
weapons.

Rutte on Monday said the Nato members were meeting at a "truly historic"
moment amid "significant and growing" challenges to European security
that were becoming increasingly dangerous.

He believed the summit would make the alliance "stronger, fairer and
more lethal". The members are to raise their defence spending baseline
to up to 5 per cent of their GDP compared to the previous 2 per cent
benchmark.

The investment plan includes a fivefold increase in air defence
capabilities, thousands more tanks and armoured vehicles as well as
millions of new rounds of ammunition, Rutte explained, reflecting the
toll of the three-year armed conflict in Ukraine.

The Nato chief called Russia the "most significant and direct threat" to
the group, owing to its invasion of Ukraine.

[He said [the **Kremlin** was receiving **support** from]{.mark} North
Korea, **[China]{.mark}**, Iran and Belarus, and he reiterated that Nato
would continue to support Kyiv in defending against **Moscow's military
threats.**]{.underline}

#### Even absent traditional draw-in -- Russia involvement in Taiwan poses a substantial threat 

**Rumer 24** \[Eugene Rumer is a Director and Senior Fellow, Russia and
Eurasia Program, "Taiwan and the Limits of the Russia-China Friendship,"
09/03/2024,
https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2024/08/taiwan-and-the-limits-of-the-russia-china-friendship?lang=en\]

The [[relationship between Russia and China rests on four
pillars]{.underline}:]{.mark}

[A **[common adversary]{.mark}**---the United States;]{.underline}

Complementary geopolitical priorities---Europe for Russia, Asia-Pacific
for China---that reinforce each other in competition with the United
States;

[**[Authoritarian domestic politics]{.mark}**; and]{.underline}

[Complementary [economic strengths]{.mark}]{.underline}---Russia's
natural resources and China's manufacturing power.

[[**China benefits** from]{.mark} the [war in Ukraine]{.mark}, as U.S.
[resources and attention are diverted from]{.mark} the
[Asia-Pacific.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[But [China has been careful to]{.mark} not become closely associated
with the war]{.underline}, to avoid being targeted by U.S. sanctions,
[and to [maintain a **façade of impartiality.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[**Russia benefits** from tensions in the Asia-Pacific]{.mark} because
they distract the United States from the European theater.]{.underline}

But a war between the United States and China over Taiwan would most
likely not be in Russia's interest.

A war over Taiwan would entail many risks for Russia:

The risk of a global catastrophe triggered by a confrontation between
two global superpowers;

Risks to Russia's military and economic assets along its Pacific coast;
and

The risk of a global economic disruption with adverse consequences for
Russia.

[[In]{.mark} the event of a [war between the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and China]{.mark}, Russia would probably]{.underline}
avoid becoming directly involved and ad[opt a policy broadly similar to
China's policy with respect to the war in Ukraine. [It would]{.mark}
probably **[help]{.mark} China** [with]{.mark}:]{.underline}

[**[Energy deliveries]{.mark}**---a **critical factor** stressed by
Russian and Chinese experts;]{.underline}

[[**Military** **equipment**, **technology**]{.mark}, and know-how based
on Russia's warfighting experience in Ukraine;]{.underline}

[[Early warning and **missile defense expertise**]{.mark};
and]{.underline}

[**[Intelligence-sharing]{.mark}** and cyber expertise.]{.underline}

[However, [even]{.mark} in the **[absence of direct
involvement]{.mark}** in the conflict by Russia, it [would be a **major
risk**]{.mark} factor for the United States to consider because
of:]{.underline}

[Its proximity to the theater of war, to the United States, and to U.S.
treaty allies Japan and the Republic of Korea;]{.underline}

[Its **[adversarial relations]{.mark}** with the United States;
and]{.underline}

[The [**mistrust** and **lack of transparency**]{.mark} between
Washington and Moscow.]{.underline}

#### China and Russia have been colluding and increasing joint war efforts

**Chang 25** \[Gordon G. Chang, Opinion Contributor for The Hill,
\"China is sending soldiers to Ukraine to prepare for a Taiwan
invasion," 4/17/2025,
https://thehill.com/opinion/international/5252196-china-soldiers-ukraine/\]

[A former Western intelligence official told Reuters that approximately
**2[00 Chinese soldiers]{.mark}** [are fighting for Russia in
Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}. Two current U.S. officials, speaking
anonymously, confirm that there are more than a hundred of them.

[Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky put the number at
155]{.underline}. His forces have recently captured two of them.

Reuters reports that the U.S. government believes these soldiers are
mercenaries and apparently have no "direct link" with the Chinese
government. Whether this view is correct or not, Washington and other
governments should impose severe costs upon China for permitting its
nationals to enter the battle against Ukraine.

[As an initial matter, [China's regime is]{.mark} in fact [sending
soldiers to]{.mark} that [Eastern Europe]{.mark}an country. Reuters
reports that "Chinese military officers have, **[with Beijing's
approval]{.mark}**, been touring close to Russia's frontlines [to draw
**lessons and tactics** from the war]{.mark}]{.underline}." The former
Western intelligence official told the news service that these officers
"are absolutely there under approval."

["The Communist Party craves **[first-hand experience]{.mark}** of the
battlefield in Ukraine [to inform its P]{.mark}eople's
[L]{.mark}iberation [A]{.mark}rmy [for]{.mark} its **[future
wars]{.mark}**]{.underline}," Richard Fisher of the Washington, D.C.
area-based International Assessment and Strategy Center told me late
last week. "For the PLA, the Ukraine battlefield offers the most livid
and brutal evolution of the revolutionary and see-saw battle between
unmanned weapons and electronic warfare defenses arrayed against them."

"[If the PLA can grasp and expand on the lessons of the Ukraine
battlefield, [it can **vastly increase** its chances of a rapid]{.mark}
blitzkrieg **[victory in Taiwan]{.mark}**]{.underline}," says Fisher.

It is also likely that the Chinese officers are doing more than
observing and reporting back to China. [[They]{.mark} may [also]{.mark}
be [giving advice to]{.mark} their [Russian counterparts]{.mark}.
[China]{.mark}, after all, has [been backing Russia's war effort **from
the beginning.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[China]{.mark} **almost certainly** [greenlighted the
invasion]{.mark}]{.underline} with its 5,300-word joint statement issued
by Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin in Beijing on Feb. 4, 2022, just 20
days before the Russian attack. Putin might have invaded earlier, but he
evidently acceded to Chinese wishes and waited until after the end of
the Beijing Winter Olympics to hit the former Soviet republic.

[China has during the war [supported Putin]{.mark} almost **[across the
board]{.mark}**.]{.underline} For instance, Beijing has purchased
Russian oil sanctioned by the United Kingdom, U.S. and the European
Union, [[opened]{.mark} its **[financial]{.mark}** and **[banking
systems]{.mark}** to Russia's institutions under sanction, [provided
**military intelligence**]{.mark} [and]{.mark} **diplomatic** and
**[propaganda support]{.mark}**]{.underline} and sold both dual-use
items and, according to some sources, weapons.

Given Beijing's support to both Moscow and Pyongyang, it is unlikely
that North Korea could have joined the war on Russia's side without
China's approval.

With regard to the mercenaries, [Beijing probably both **knew and
approved** of their participation in the war.]{.underline}

"[It is **[unlikely]{.mark}** that [these soldiers would have been
permitted to]{.mark} travel to Russia [without]{.mark} the [**full
consent** of]{.mark} the **[Xi]{.mark}** regime]{.underline}," Charles
Burton of the Sinopsis think tank told me.

"Xi runs a near-total surveillance state and pays special attention to
the interactions of its nationals with close partners such as Russia,"
Burton, also a former Canadian diplomat stationed in Beijing, said. "A
couple hundred military-age Chinese men leaving the country to fight in
a foreign war is certainly something Beijing would know about."

There are, for instance, bound to be Ministry of State Security agents
monitoring visa applications for Russia.

The presence of Chinese soldiers in Ukraine is reminiscent of the
"Chinese People's Volunteers" who went to fight United Nations troops in
North Korea beginning in 1950.

"China sending in an initial small cohort to join the Russians is
consistent with Chinese Communist strategy to initially create plausible
deniability and then a veneer of legitimacy for a gradual build-up of
those at the front lines," says Burton. "[This will **almost
[certainly]{.mark}** be [accompanied by]{.mark} the [gradual
introduction of sophisticated **Chinese offensive
weaponry**]{.mark}]{.underline}," he added.

[Burton is also concerned that [Russia, indebted to China]{.mark}
because of the support in Ukraine, [will **not be able** to **say
no**]{.mark} when China demands that Moscow send forces to help it
invade Taiwan]{.underline} or another neighbor.

[The [Chinese and Russian militaries]{.mark} regularly [hold joint
**drills in East Asia**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Therefore, the Pentagon
should assume that these two powers, along with North Korea, will fight
together during the next war.

So China probably sees great advantage in Chinese troops, even if just
mercenaries, fighting in Ukraine.

The U.S. and other countries have imposed almost no costs on China for
its extensive support for the Russian war effort. We should not be
surprised, therefore, that Beijing now thinks it can, with impunity,
send soldiers to fight in Europe.

### Russia

#### Draws in Russia and collapses NATO.

**Fornusek \'25** \[Martin; Senior News Editor at the Kyiv Independent;
June 2025; \"Would China invading Taiwan spark Russian attack on NATO?
Experts say it\'s 'plausible',\" Kyiv Independent,
https://kyivindependent.com/russia-striking-nato-while-china-invades-taiwan-plausible-scenario-experts-say-06-2025/\]

[[If Beijing moves against Taiwan]{.mark},
**[NATO]{.mark}**]{.underline} might soon [[find itself in]{.mark} a
**two-front [war]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} **China** and
**[Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- or so the alliance\'s secretary
general believes.

\"[If [Xi]{.mark}]{.underline} Jinping [would attack Taiwan, he would
first make]{.underline} sure that he makes [a [call]{.mark}
to]{.underline} his very junior partner in all of this, Vladimir
Vladimirovich **[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark}**... and [[telling
him]{.underline}]{.mark}, \'Hey, I'm going to do this, and [I need you
to [to]{.mark} keep them busy in Europe by **[attacki]{.mark}ng
[NATO]{.mark}** territory]{.underline},\'\" Secretary General Mark Rutte
said in a July 5 interview with the New York Times.

[Such a scenario would for all intents and purposes [amount to]{.mark} a
[global war]{.mark} [between **nuclear**]{.mark}
**[superpowers]{.mark}**]{.underline}, yet many experts agree that this
scenario is not too far from reality.

[[Beijing and Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[tightened their
**alliance**]{.mark} aimed at [**dethroning the
U.S**.]{.mark}]{.underline} as the global superpower, a cooperation
nowhere else more visible than in Chinese support for Russia\'s war
against Ukraine.

In the meantime, [[NATO]{.mark} continues to [grapple with]{.mark} the
war in Ukraine and **[internal divisions]{.mark}** wrought by the Trump
presidency]{.underline}. It would benefit China to fuel this turmoil,
making sure the alliance\'s attention remains split while Beijing
pursues its own territorial ambitions.

\"[If [China]{.mark} were to decide that incorporating
Taiwan]{.underline} into China by force [was their only option, they
will]{.underline} do all they can to [**[ensure]{.mark}** both Europe
and America have]{.underline} as many **[[dispersed
challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}** to deal with as possible,\" retired
Australian Army Major General Mick Ryan told the Kyiv Independent.

China and Russia eye a two-front war on the West

According to the South China Morning Post, China\'s Foreign Minister
Wang Yi recently told the EU\'s top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, that [his
[country cannot afford Russia to lose]{.mark} its war against
[Ukraine]{.mark}, as it would allow the U.S. to **[shift its]{.mark}
[focus]{.mark}** []{.mark}on Beijing.]{.underline}

[This admission underscored]{.underline} \"[China\'s strategic interest
in depleting Western resources]{.underline} on the European continent,\"
Nataliya Butyrska, an expert on East Asia at the New Europe Center in
Kyiv, told the Kyiv Independent.

This goal has also been evident in China\'s support of Russia\'s
aggression against Ukraine.

The Asian power has been the leading source of dual-use goods feeding
the Russian defense industry and has helped Moscow cushion the impact
of Western sanctions.

[[Kyiv]{.underline}]{.mark} has even [[**accused China** of]{.mark}
directly [providing arms to Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} -- an allegation
Beijing denied. Several Chinese nationals have also been captured
fighting in Ukraine within Russian ranks.

Experts have long warned that [China is]{.underline} closely [watching
Russia\'s invasion]{.underline} of Ukraine [to learn
lessons]{.underline} for a potential invasion of Taiwan. But the
interest is not limited to the military sphere.

\"China is closely observing the West's response to Russia's actions and
sees opportunities for itself amid a potential fracture of transatlantic
unity,\" Butyrska said.

Underscoring the symbiotic nature of the Russian-Chinese relationship,
[[a Chinese **invasion**]{.mark} of Taiwan could also [present a]{.mark}
**[boon to Moscow]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

\"[Russia wouldn't need a request]{.underline} from China to keep NATO
occupied; [it is]{.underline} more [likely to take advantage of a
Taiwan]{.underline} invasion [by undertaking]{.underline} some kind of
further [aggression]{.underline} in Europe,\" Dan Hamilton, a
non-resident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told the Kyiv
Independent.

[Ukrainian and [Western officials]{.mark} have been [**raising alarms**
that]{.mark} a Russian [**attack** against NATO]{.mark}
territory]{.underline} --- for example, [[in the
**Baltics**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- is an increasingly plausible
scenario.

Camille Grand, a security and NATO expert at the European Council on
Foreign Relations, concurred that in \"the event of a major crisis in
Asia, the Russian Federation might indeed try to take advantage of the
U.S. focused on a Taiwanese contingency to test NATO and further
challenge European security.\"

[Even the more cautious voices do not rule out a possible
coordination]{.underline} between China and Russia in the case of an
attack on Taiwan.

Jan Svec, a China researcher at the Prague-based Institute of
International Relations, notes that an ideal scenario for Beijing is
seizing the island by non-military means without sparking a broader
conflict with the West.

However \"[if the situation escalates]{.underline} and the Chinese
government decides [on a military invasion]{.underline} (which is a less
likely but also possible option), then [it would make]{.underline} some
[sense to coordinate with Russia]{.underline},\" he told the Kyiv
Independent.

NATO caught with \'pants down\'

[[Putin and]{.mark} Xi have [not]{.mark} been [shy about]{.mark}
the]{.underline} ultimate goal of their \"**[[no-limits
partnership]{.underline}]{.mark}**\" --- [challenging the
U.S.]{.underline} and Western dominance on the global stage.

Such clarity seems to be lacking in the NATO camp. U.S. President Donald
Trump\'s strategy to drive a wedge between Moscow and Beijing by making
overtures to Russia has been met with skepticism from experts.

The new U.S. president has also signaled plans to reduce the U.S.
military presence in Europe while urging European partners to take up
greater responsibility for their own security, allowing Washington to
shift focus to the Indo-Pacific region.

But as Hamilton notes, the \"North Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific
(regions) are strategically linked by the China-Russia entente.\"

\"NATO\'s best contribution to this challenge is for Europeans to do
more to defend Europe so that Americans can devote more resources to the
Indo-Pacific,\" he adds.

Allied leaders have rushed to allay Trump\'s concerns, agreeing to ramp
up the defense spending target from 2% to 5% of GDP during a recent
summit in The Hague. However, some experts say this is far from enough
to counter a united Russian-Chinese threat.

Edward Lucas, a non-resident Senior Fellow at the Center for European
Policy Analysis, agrees that a coordinated Chinese assault on Taiwan and
a Russian assault on NATO is \"all too plausible.\"

\"What is baffling to me is that NATO, having been on edge after Trump's
election victory... is slumping back into a posture of complacency,\" he
told the Kyiv Independent.

Calling the new defense spending target an \"aspiration\" rather than a
reality, Lucas says that \"NATO still has its pants down when it comes
to defense and deterrence.\"

The Russia, China, North Korea axis

Grand points to [[another piece of evidence]{.mark} of the intrinsic
links]{.underline} between North Atlantic and Indo-Pacific
security: [**[North]{.mark} [Korea\'s involvement]{.mark}** in the
Russia-Ukraine war]{.underline}.

[Pyongyang]{.underline}, traditionally a close partner of China, [has
shaped up as]{.underline} arguably [the most [active supporter
of]{.mark} Russian [aggression]{.mark}]{.underline} in Ukraine and a
direct participant in the war.

[While China\'s support has been mostly economic and material, North
Korea has deployed thousands of soldiers]{.underline} to help Russia
fight against Ukraine, [as well as ballistic missiles and]{.underline}
millions of [artillery]{.underline} shells.

\"[European countries]{.underline} and the United States [are
underestimating the threat]{.underline} posed by North Korea,\" Butyrska
says, adding that Pyongyang\'s support for Russian military ventures is
\"happening with China's tacit approval.\"

\"[[Beijing]{.mark} is interested in [leveraging]{.mark} this [potential
to **escalate**]{.mark} tensions on the **[Korean
Peninsula]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This could tie down U.S.
forces]{.underline} there at the moment of a possible invasion of Taiwan
[and draw North Korea]{.underline} into direct confrontation with the
United States,\" she says.

[[This united challenge]{.underline}]{.mark}, also [[linked to the
Middle East via]{.mark} the [**Russian-Iranian**
partnership]{.mark}]{.underline}, shows that [NATO faces the most **dire
security challenges**]{.underline} since the Cold War. Rutte\'s warnings
should, therefore, not be taken lightly, the experts say.

**[a]{.underline}**rtificial **[i]{.underline}**ntelligence.
**[China]{.underline}** [is at a]{.underline}
**[disadvantage]{.underline}** [in this]{.underline} regard. [The

**[counting patents]{.underline}** **[isn't a good way]{.underline}**

**[ten percent]{.underline}** [of patents account for
roughly]{.underline} **[90 percent]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}
[**total patent value**, meaning that the]{.underline} **[vast

Patent]{.underline} **[citations]{.underline}** [offer a]{.underline}

**[single one comes from China]{.underline}**. Moreover, China's leading
artificial intelligence companies, including Tencent, Alibaba, and
Baidu, are merely copies of Facebook, Amazon, and Google, tailored to
the Chinese market.

As the late economic historian Alexander Gerschenkron observed, [when a
country lags behind the technological frontier, imitation and the
adoption of foreign technology can take it a]{.underline} [**long
way**---and, in general, the further a country has fallen behind, the
greater the role the state must play in driving industrial catch-up.
Thanks to state investment in mass production technology,
the]{.underline} **[Soviet Union]{.underline}** [grew]{.underline}
**[rapidly]{.underline}** [during]{.underline} much of [the Cold War, as
did Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. Indeed, numerous scholars have
attributed the "Asian Miracle" to **state-driven industrial catch-up**.
But while they were successful in closing]{.underline}
**[some]{.underline}** [of the gap, these countries never managed to
**overtake**]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. [Unlike]{.underline} [**imitation**, which can
be]{.underline} **[planned]{.underline}** and coordinated,
**[innovation]{.underline}** [is a voyage of]{.underline}
**[exploration]{.underline}** [into the]{.underline}
**[unknown]{.underline}**, to paraphrase the economist and philosopher
Friedrich von Hayek. And **[switching]{.underline}** [from imitation to
innovation is]{.underline} **[hard]{.underline}**: if it were easy, most
countries would be innovating at the technological frontier.

[By observing that China is unlikely to **overtake** the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [in technological
innovation, we mean in no way to downplay China's tremendous economic
**achievements**]{.underline} since Deng Xiaoping came to power in 1978.
[China has plenty of talent, but the fact remains that, so far, Chinese
innovation has mainly focused on **incrementally**]{.underline}
[improving technologies that were]{.underline} **[conceived
elsewhere]{.underline}**. Chinese companies currently lead the world in
the development of 5G, for example, but their work builds on several

#### Modernization doesn't cause war\-\--it's solely for upholding CCP rule.

Readiness: The People's Liberation Army Remains Focused on Upholding
Chinese Communist Party Rule, Not Preparing for War," RAND, 1-26-2025,

Rule]{.underline}]{.mark}: [[The **Real Driver** of]{.mark}
**[P]{.mark}**eople's **[L]{.mark}**iberation **[A]{.mark}**rmy
**[Modernization]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[The **primary mission** of upholding CCP rule remains
**consistent**]{.underline}, but the ways in which the military is
expected to fulfill that mission have changed. Military modernization
has become essential to the PLA's function of upholding CCP rule because
the CCP's own methods of staying in power have experienced
modernization. In the 1950s and 1960s, for example, Chinese officials
relied on totalitarian control, political campaigns, and mass violence
to stay in power.69 During that time, [the PLA **dutifully** carried out
its **mission** of upholding CCP rule]{.underline} by participating in
political campaigns, suppressing unrest, and intervening in politics to
eliminate threats to the supreme leader.

Deng overhauled the CCP's governance strategy and thereby eliminated the
old dangers of ideologically infused factional fights. However, the
improved stability came at the cost of new challenges to CCP rule. The
[**new challenges** stemmed from the party's success in overseeing
**decades** of rapid economic **growth**]{.underline}. Popular
satisfaction with the pragmatic growth strategy initiated by Deng
[**heightened** expectations]{.underline} that [the CCP could deliver
jobs, higher living standards, social welfare benefits, fair treatment
by courts, a cleaner environment, and less corruption]{.underline}. But
the state's resources have proven inadequate to meet these demands. [As
Xi explained, the [**central problem** for CCP rule]{.mark} is the
"contradiction" between [the "**ever growing needs**]{.mark} of the
people for a **better life**" and the country's "**unbalanced** and
**inadequate development**]{.underline}."70 Because popular expectations
often [**[exceed]{.mark}**ed [what the party could **deliver**]{.mark},
instability has **surged**]{.underline}. Since 2011, the budget for
internal security has exceeded the defense budget, and authorities have
increased repression to maintain order.71

Chinese leaders have recognized this new challenge to CCP rule since the
2000s, when they defined the public's expectations, or demands, in both
material and spiritual terms.72 Popular material demands included
resources that can improve the [**[standard of
living]{.mark}**,]{.underline} whereas spiritual demands included
[**[national dignity]{.mark}** and the **maintenance** of China's
political system]{.underline}. These demands [**[form]{.mark}**ed the
**essence** of the nation's "**[core interests]{.mark}**," which
authorities deemed [**necessary** for]{.mark} the
state]{.underline}'s---and CCP's---[**[survival]{.mark}** and
**development**]{.underline}.73

[Since 2004, the [PLA's role in]{.mark} national strategy has focused
accordingly on aiding the CCP's [**delivery** of]{.mark} these
[material]{.mark} and [s]{.mark}piritual goods. To meet the people's
material demands, the PLA has been [tasked with **aiding**]{.mark}
**economic** [**development** through]{.mark} the [protection of]{.mark}
workers and [assets]{.mark} abroad, the promotion of **international
[stability]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark} the protection of **key**
[**shipping** **lanes**]{.mark}.74 Relevant missions include
noncombatant evacuation operations, United Nations peacekeeping
operations, and counterpiracy patrols. Through the 2000s, China's
military increased its involvement in these types of nonwar missions.

**interventions**]{.mark} abroad [since]{.mark} its [1979]{.mark} war
with Vietnam [have]{.mark} [consisted of **nonwar
operations**]{.mark}.75]{.underline}

To meet the people's spiritual demands for national dignity, the PLA
helps burnish patriotic fervor, national pride, and the nonwar defense
of the country's interests through deterrence, parades, drills, and
exercises, which frequently receive lavish coverage in Chinese media.76
[[**Showcasing** modernization]{.mark} achievements in China's
technological prowess, such as the fielding of aircraft carriers,
stealth aircraft, and other technological wonders, also helps [instill
**patriotic enthusiasm**]{.mark}. The [military]{.mark} helps
**[bolster]{.mark}** popular [trust]{.mark} in authorities by saving
lives]{.underline}. Despite the ostensible divorce from domestic
security missions, [the PLA has [frequently]{.mark} intervened to [help

[Muscle-flexing [demonstrations]{.mark} that **[do not]{.mark}**

uncompromising position and coercive actions on disputes, such as the

in the leadership as a defender of the nation's interest in a manner
that costs China (and the Chinese public) little. [[Military

#### Inevitability is literally just a rhetorical trick.

of International Affairs; \"'INEVITABILITY': Capturing Strategic
Ambiguity in Xi Jinping\'s China,\" World Affairs, 5-14-2025, Vol. 188,
Issue 2. //TL

[Following **repeated messages** uttered by the Minister of Foreign
Affairs]{.underline} and foreign policy [communicators]{.underline}
during meetings with foreign dignitaries and press conferences,
[China\'s formulation of Taiwan\'s "reunification" with the mainland has
entered Western media as a successful outcome in the PRC\'s **strategic
communications**]{.underline} (see e.g., Kuo 2020). Interestingly,
[unlike many other formulations]{.underline} of Chinese leaders, [the
message of "inevitability"]{.underline} for Taiwan\'s "return" [contains
an intrinsic ambiguity]{.underline}. Namely, it is communicated through
different articulations, including the aforementioned "irreversible
historic process" \[不可逆转的历史进程 bùkě nìzhuǎn de lìshǐ jìnchéng\],
as well as through "historical conclusion" \[历史定论 lìshǐ dìnglùn\]
and the "inevitability of history" \[历史必然 lìshǐ bìrán\]. "Our
country must be reunified and will surely be reunified. This is a
historical conclusion drawn from the evolution of cross-Straits
relations over the past seven decades; it is also critical to the
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation in the new era" (Xi 2019a, 2019b).

But [the detail of the precise wording seems of secondary
concern]{.underline} as the central message of inevitability is finding
traction with the international media. "Xi Jinping Says Taiwan\'s
Unification with China is 'Inevitable'," reported TIME magazine\'s
online edition (Haynes 2019), referring to Xi Jinping\'s Speech at the
Meeting Marking the 40th Anniversary of the Issuance of the Message to
Compatriots in Taiwan quoted above.

It is probable that one of [the reasons behind the **popularity** of
emphasizing this message is its firmness---China\'s absolute certitude
that "reunification" will happen]{.underline}. China is so sure, in
fact, that it guarantees the futility of any action opposing powers
might offer or "dream" up. Chinese State Councilor and then-Foreign
Minister Wang Yi commented on US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\'s visit to
Taiwan in August 2022, but this time used the words "inevitability of
history" \[历史必然 lìshǐ bìrán\] in the original text: "The United
States should not dream of obstructing China\'s reunification. Taiwan is
a part of China. The complete reunification of China is the trend of the
times and an inevitability of history" (Ministry of Foreign Affairs of
the People\'s Republic of China 2022a). The firmness delivers on its
international effects, especially in China\'s immediate vicinity. As a
Japanese participant noted during a closed-for-public discussion on the
topic: "In the East, including Japan, the China\'s argument \[of
"reunification" as inevitability\] is strong. We do not hear ambiguity,
what we do hear is a threat." Yet, upon examination, this discursively
constructed certitude becomes an illusion, a smokescreen for an
ambiguous response. It offers neither detail nor reference to other
discursive or social practices surrounding the Taiwan question.

Furthermore, ambiguity is often enhanced by intertextual means. Observe
one section of the statement by then-Minister of Foreign Affairs, Wang
Yi in a virtual meeting with the Government Delegation of Nicaragua:

Although the two sides of the Taiwan Strait have yet to be reunified,
the sovereignty and territory of China has never been severed and the
fact that the mainland and Taiwan belong to one and the same China has
never changed. China must be united and reunification is inevitable.
Complete reunification is the shared aspiration of all sons and
daughters of the Chinese nation.

(Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People\'s Republic of China 2021a)

In the official English translation above, Wang Yi uses the modal verb
"must," with its associations regarding, according to the Cambridge
Dictionary, containing obligation, necessity, invitation, and
encouragement---calling for action and activity. But in the same
sentence he claims that "reunification is inevitable." Consequently, no
action or activity could influence the outcome. This contradiction of
textual logic projects ambiguity. The Chinese original (Ministry of
Foreign Affairs of the People\'s Republic of China 2021b), curiously,
adds another layer, as the wording (中国必须统一, 也必然统一 Zhōngguó
bìxū tǒngyī, yě bìrán tǒngyī) is slogan-like, rhythmical, repetitive,
and introduces word play due to the proximity of the words "must" and
"inevitable/certain" (bìxū - bìrán). [**Repetition**, **rhythm**, and
**word play** are often used in Chinese official discourse to
**obscure** the exact meaning of the **message**]{.underline}, and the
Chinese tradition of laconic official writing is well suited to this.

The [central document]{.underline} on the PRC\'s stance regarding
Taiwan, however, [presents a different message. It speaks of active
action, not of passive expectation]{.underline} for history to take its
course, of reunification-as-mission, not reunification-as-inevitability:
"[Resolving the Taiwan]{.underline} question and realizing China\'s
complete reunification is a shared aspiration of all the sons and
daughters of the Chinese nation. It is indispensable for the realization
of China\'s rejuvenation. It is also a historic mission of the Communist
Party of China (CPC)" (The Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council
and the State Council Information Office of the People\'s Republic of
China 2022).

[There are many layers to the inevitability discourse]{.underline} in Xi
Jinping\'s China, as it presents simultaneously and contradictorily both
a "mission" and an "inevitability" [and employs different wording for
the message of "inevitability"]{.underline} in Chinese and English
translations. Ambiguity, then, is not just an inner feature of Xi
Jinping\'s claim of inevitability, but also of a wider discourse
surrounding reunification with Taiwan. The PRC signals domination
without projecting urgency or revealing any additional details
pertaining to its "unification" plans. The audiences for such ambiguity
are at least threefold:

4.1 Policy Makers and Society in Taiwan

[China engages in **public opinion** warfare and **psychological
warfare** with the aim to weaken Taiwanese resistance]{.underline} by
signaling to Taiwan that there is no other long-term solution than to be
integrated into the PRC: the ambiguity of "inevitability" contains a
threat. [The CCP has]{.underline} long [insisted on Taiwan\'s
reunification with China, perhaps calculating that simply **repeating
this claim** can eventually make it true]{.underline}. As opinion polls
in Taiwan point to a decrease in support for unification (Election Study
Center, National Chengchi University 2024), it is evident that [the PRC
**calculations** have been **inaccurate**, and]{.underline} Taiwan\'s
political and social [responses to the CCP\'s]{.underline} repeated
[assertions of "inevitability" prevail among the
population]{.underline}. Perhaps, [Beijing will increase its pressure on
Taiwan]{.underline} on the "action" side [to reinforce the "speech"
side, or introduce a]{.underline} readjustment in this [rhetorical
maneuver]{.underline}, with more explicit wordings in the future.

Policy makers in Taiwan\'s primary security backer---the United States,
as well as other regional powers, including Japan, the Philippines,
Republic of Korea, India, and Australia

[The **rhetorical maneuver** of]{.underline} the ambiguous
["inevitability" is meant to reassure the nations by hinting that the
PRC is not rushing into a kinetic scenario]{.underline}, perhaps to
minimize the security dilemma caused by a steady rise in military
expenditures in regional countries.3 Lyle Morris (2022) remarks that
[the message signals China\'s unwillingness to engage in cross-Strait
conflict]{.underline}: "While some may interpret a coercive undertone of
'inevitability' in unifying Taiwan with China, [it is nonetheless a
**softer pitch** for cross-Strait reproachment]{.underline} than
previous formulations." Such a reading---ambiguity as reassurance---is
not a mere side effect to "inevitability," but clearly a central and
intended one.

4.2 The Domestic Audiences in PRC Proper

In a testament to the link between domestic and international discourse,
when the PRC leadership talks about Taiwan\'s "return" as an
inevitability, it creates ambiguity in China too. The message is a magic
pill because it is equally successful in bringing two domestic groups
into the fold. First, [the promise of inevitable eventual unification
helps to **dissuade**]{.underline} the most [red-blooded
**nationalists**]{.underline} against requesting an immediate solution
to the Taiwan question. Second, [ambiguity cloaked in rhetorical
firmness legitimizes the Communist Party of China]{.underline} in the
eyes of the more skeptical-minded citizenry by promising an eventual
triumph of the Party in achieving national rejuvenation.
[Unification]{.underline} with Taiwan [is positioned as an indispensable
part of China\'s **rejuvenation narrative**]{.underline}, and failure to
achieve this would likely weaken the Party\'s claims to historical
continuity and ideological success, as well as Xi Jinping\'s personal
grip on power. For Xi, the unification of Taiwan is not merely a
geopolitical goal, but also a professional one: it is a deeply ingrained
element of Xi\'s vision of China\'s rise and a path for him to remain in
the leadership position.

#### China would [use first]{.underline} in a conflict.

One additional potential [**redline** for Chinese nuclear first use
is]{.underline} U.S. conventional [**counterforce attacks** on China's
nuclear forces]{.underline}. Some Chinese military researchers have
contended that [significantly **degrading China's nuclear
forces**]{.underline}---and subsequently China's nuclear
deterrence---[with conventional strikes could also be a redline that
could lead to Chinese nuclear first use]{.underline}. Although PLA
concerns may date to as early as the 1990s, it appears DoD interest in
Prompt Global Strike since the 2000s, and especially in the early 2010s,
drove Beijing's concerns to new heights.10 These concerns were further
raised by high-profile Western research in the mid-2010s, including a
2015 RAND report and a 2017 International Security article by Lieber and
Press.11 For example, two researchers at the PLA's Nanjing Army Command
College argued in 2016 that both the [United States and China must
"strictly forbid the use of conventional weapons]{.underline} to attack
\[targets\] that would cross the bottom line of no first use."12 Other
[Chinese military authors]{.underline} seem to agree [with]{.underline}
the 2017 International Security article, which argued
[that]{.underline}, with enhanced ISR and conventional precision strike,
the United States can conduct better counterforce operations to limit
damage from China, with an emphasis on "conventional punitive
capabilities such as massive numbers of long-range strike weapons."13
Despite not being official policy, these [Chinese military experts'
concern about and **anxiety** over perceived U.S. **hostility** and
**superior capabilities**]{.underline} might [reflect a specific current
of Chinese strategic thinking]{.underline} that could [motivate Chinese
nuclear first use during conflict]{.underline}. Indeed, Chinese scholars
also reacted negatively to the language change in the 2017 National
Defense Authorization Act and the 2019 Missile Defense Review that
indicated a more aggressive, absolute security--seeking stance on the
U.S. side.14

Lastly, [U.S. **decapitation**]{.underline} (斩首) strikes against the
Chinese leadership---[or]{.underline} simply [**PRC perceptions** of
U.S. actions]{.underline} as such---could [drive Chinese nuclear first
use.]{.underline} As detailed in Volume 4 of this series, the [Chinese
military has long recognized that the U.S. way of war prominently
features attempts to **kill adversary leadership**]{.underline} early in
a conflict.15 As the PLA NDU 2020 version of Science of Military
Strategy specifically explains, "The U.S. military, at the start of
several recent local \[limited\] wars, always selected the enemy's
military and government heads, command organs, and TV and radio stations
as important strike objectives."16 [Beijing is also acutely aware that
the United States continues this trend:]{.underline} Chinese officials
have criticized the United States for killing Iranian military official
Qassem Soleimani with a drone strike in January 2020.17 This [dovetails
with]{.underline} the Science of Second Artillery Campaigns' third
[condition of adversary **medium-or-high-intensity
strikes**]{.underline} against Beijing or other major [cities but is
likely to be a separate and more specific trigger for Chinese nuclear
first use]{.underline}. Emerging technologies, especially long-range
precision strike and hypersonic weapons, have likely increased PRC
concerns; for example, at least some PLA researchers have specifically
linked hypersonic weapons to concerns over decapitation.18

#### Deterrence allows for diplomacy which solves inevitable conflict.

For a half-century, [despite differences of interpretation, the "one
China" formula and the US doctrine of strategic ambiguity kept the
peace]{.underline}. But now, some [analysts are calling for greater
strategic clarity about]{.underline} the defense of
**[Taiwan]{.underline}**. They note that China has become much stronger
than it was in 1971 or 1995, and that it is objecting more vociferously
to episodes like then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi's visit to
Taiwan in 2022. Adding further to the potential for instability,
Taiwan's two most recent presidents are from the Democratic Progressive
Party, which officially favors independence, and polls show that most
Taiwanese do not consider themselves Chinese. Can double deterrence
still work?

For his part, US President Joe [Biden]{.underline} has [made four
statements suggesting that he would defend Taiwan if China were to use
force]{.underline}. But each time, [the White House has "clarified" that
America has not changed its policy. The administration]{.underline} thus
has tried to [**bolster** its military **deterrence** against a Chinese
attack, while **not provoking** China into riskier behavior]{.underline}
by questioning the "one China" policy. The goal is to extend the status
quo indefinitely.

Will it work? According to Henry Kissinger, who brokered normalization
in the 1970s, Mao Zedong told Richard Nixon that China could wait a
century for the return of Taiwan. But China's current leader, Xi
Jinping, has sounded much more impatient. His primary concern is control
of the Communist Party of China and ensuring the CPC's continued control
of China. Though a failed invasion of Taiwan could jeopardize both, a
declaration of Taiwanese independence also could make him feel
threatened at home and more willing to take big risks.

Public officials' words can affect this delicate balance. But [in
diplomacy, actions speak loudest, and there are several moves that the
US could make to **increase deterrence**]{.underline}. Since an island
of 24 million people can never militarily defeat a country of more than
one billion, [Taiwan must be able to **mount resistance** that is strong
enough to **change Xi's calculation**. He must be made to understand
that he cannot possibly pull off a quick **fait accompli**]{.underline}.
To that end, Taiwan needs not only advanced aircraft and submarines, but
also shore-to-ship missiles that can be hidden in caves to outlast a
Chinese first strike. It must become a porcupine that no power can
swallow quickly.

As an island 100 miles (161 kilometers) off the Chinese coast, [Taiwan
does benefit from a **vast moat** that makes an **invasion
difficult**]{.underline}. But the sea also means that China could
enforce a naval blockade to squeeze Taiwanese into submission.
[**Taiwan** therefore needs to **boost its stockpiles** of food and
fuel]{.underline}, and the US and its allies must make clear that they
would not respect a Chinese blockade. [That means positioning American
military systems]{.underline} in Japan, Australia, and the Philippines
that can reach Taiwan within a week. [This would **reduce** the
**ambiguity** in US deterrence]{.underline}.

At the same time, [the US should not give up the basic features of
**double deterrence**. Preventing a war requires showing China that the
US and its allies have the capacity to defend Taiwan, and reminding the
island's leaders]{.underline} that a de jure declaration of
[independence would be provocative]{.underline} and is unacceptable.
Much has changed since Nixon and Mao invented [the "**one China**"
formula]{.underline}. But that formula, if combined with the other steps
outlined above, [can still help **avert a war** over
Taiwan]{.underline}.

#### China would second-strike [the moment]{.underline} the threat is issued.

Threshold, 9-15-2024, Vol. 3,
https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA2312-3.html.

The text instructs the [**PLA** missile forces]{.underline} to
[**lower** the **nuclear threshold** when "a militarily powerful country
armed with nuclear missiles]{.underline} and [depending on its absolute
superiority]{.underline} in high tech conventional weapons \[[the United
States\] carries out medium or **high intensity**]{.underline}
continuous air **[raids]{.underline}** against our major strategic
targets, and when our side lacks a brilliant plan for resisting the
enemy."3 When the conditions of lowering the nuclear threshold are met,
there are [various "opportune moments" that the nuclear forces should
conduct **deterrence signaling**]{.underline}:

First, [when an enemy **threatens** to carry out **conventional
strikes**]{.underline} against our nuclear facilities (or nuclear power
stations). In order to prevent the large-scale disaster of nuclear
leakage, [one's own nuclear missile units must sharply oppose the enemy
and use nuclear missiles]{.underline} to carry out effective deterrence.
This will restrain the enemy from carrying out its scheme of using
conventional air raids against our nuclear facilities.

Second, [when an enemy threatens to carry out conventional
strikes]{.underline} against our major strategic targets related to the
safety of the people, like large-scale hydroelectric plants, [one
should]{.underline} adhere to the deterrence orders of command and
[**threaten** to use **nuclear missiles** against the enemy]{.underline}
in order to ensure the absolute security of our major strategic targets.

Third, [when an enemy threatens to carry out medium or high intensity
conventional strikes]{.underline} against our capital, important major
cities, and other political and economic centers, the [nuclear missile
units should follow the orders of the supreme command and **resolutely
issue threats** to the enemy of the use of nuclear weapons]{.underline}.
This should be done in order to achieve the goal of reducing the
intensity of the enemy's air raids or the goal of deterring the enemy
from carrying out air raid activities.

Fourth, [when conventional warfare continues to
**escalate**]{.underline} and the overall strategic situation changes
from positive to disadvantageous for us, and when the nation's existence
is seriously threatened, [in order to force the enemy to stop its
invasion and in order to save the country from danger, the nuclear
missile units should follow the orders of headquarters and **carry out**
effective **deterrence**]{.underline} against the enemy.4

An intense focus on the CCP regime's political survival underpins all
four of these logics. The PLA, as the armed wing of the CCP with the top
responsibility of ensuring the CCP's regime survival, is acutely aware
that even conventional strikes can cause massive civilian casualties
comparable to nuclear strikes and deal fatal blows to the economic and
political foundations on which the CCP regime rests. Attacks on
hydroelectric plants---such as the Three Gorges dam, nuclear power
plants, and megacities---may cause large-scale and long-lasting damage
that could greatly harm the public's opinion of the regime, as well as
decrease the quality of life, even causing civilian casualties,
undermining the regime's legitimacy. All these effects could cause the
CCP to perceive that it is in a precarious position and look to nuclear
weapons as a way to "even" the perceived playing field. This aligns with
DoD's 2023 report to Congress, which states, "China's nuclear strategy
probably includes consideration of a nuclear strike in response to a
nonnuclear attack threatening the viability of China's nuclear forces or
C2 \[command and control\], or that approximates the strategic effects
of a nuclear strike."5

Lastly, the [fourth condition]{.underline} reflects a [virtual **blank
check** to CCP leadership]{.underline} whenever it feels threatened
because, [in a conflict, the "overall strategic situation]{.underline}"
and "nation's existence" is [likely to be reduced to CCP
regime]{.underline}---and even leadership---**[personal
security]{.underline}**. It is difficult to pinpoint with confidence
when the CCP leadership might make such a judgement, but in the context
of a Taiwan scenario, [one example might be when the CCP leadership
begins to feel that the **stakes of the conflict expand** from simply
whether the CCP can claim success]{.underline} for the unification of
Taiwan [to instead the CCP leadership fearing that its fate rests on the
success of its military campaign]{.underline}. As noted in a recent RAND
report, one concern of Western analysts is that "once they start the
war, the [PRC's leaders may then view success as critical to the
regime's survival]{.underline}."6 This is also an apparent concern of
DoD; its 2023 report to Congress stated, "**[Beijing]{.underline}**
probably would also [**consider nuclear use** to restore deterrence if a
conventional military defeat in Taiwan gravely threatened CCP regime
survival]{.underline}."7 However, the RAND report argues that "it is at
least plausible that the PRC will not view the outcome of the war as
existential and instead look for exit ramps, such as claiming it
successfully taught Taiwan a lesson, as it did with Vietnam in 1979."8
Thus, it is important for the United States and its allies to not adopt
a fatalist interpretation of this last condition that self-deters from
any intervention against a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.

### AT: Thucydides

#### It's wrong. War is not inevitable

Han **Dongping 24**, PhD, Professor, Warren Wilson College, Former Guest
Professor, Hebei University, Wenzhou University, Nanchang University;
\"Why China and the US will not go to war,\" ThinkChina, 11-13-2024,
https://www.thinkchina.sg/politics/why-china-and-us-will-not-go-war.
//TL

Will war break out between China and the US? A significant group of
American academics studying China-US relations believe that a war
between the two countries is inevitable.

In his 2017 book Destined for War: Can America and China Escape
Thucydides's Trap?, Harvard Professor Graham Allison analysed 500 years
of world history, and identified 16 cases where a rising power has
threatened to displace a major ruling power. He found that 12 of these
16 potential conflicts ultimately resulted in war.

Based on various international relations theories, Allison argues that a
war between China and the US is inevitable unless China slows its
challenge to American hegemony or the US humbles itself and is willing
to become world number two.

Theories and realities

Many Chinese academics also seem to share the concern that a war between
China and the US is inevitable. During my studies of international
politics in the US, one of the few insights I gained was that the
various theories and models found in textbooks hold limited practical
significance in real life.

I remember when the teacher was discussing these theories and models in
class, such as the prisoner's dilemma, I spoke up and said that they are
inaccurate and do not truly reflect social realities. The professor
retorted, "Who said these theories and models are accurate? Political
science is the study of these theories and models. If you're not
interested in them, perhaps you should reconsider your major." I was
taken aback by my professor's response.

To keep my scholarship, I wrote an essay arguing that the value of these
theories and models lies not in their accuracy, but in their ability to
simplify complex social phenomena, allowing us to understand them
better, just as we use maps not because they are accurate but because
they reduce the massive size of planet Earth to a scale we can study in
a classroom. The professor was very pleased with my essay and even
commended me in class.

US-China confrontation in history

The Thucydides's Trap that Allison used does not apply to the China-US
confrontation; his assertion that the leaders of China and the US both
want to avoid war is also inaccurate.

Over the past 70 years, the US has been encircling China by establishing
hundreds of military bases around its periphery. Dai Xu, a senior
colonel in the People's Liberation Army Air Force, whom Americans
consider one of the six major hawks in the Chinese military, has also
repeatedly highlighted the US's "C-shaped" encirclement of China. In his
2016 documentary The Coming War on China, renowned Australian
journalist, academic and documentary filmmaker John Pilger also pointed
out the US's encirclement of China.

The China-US confrontation began 70 years ago. The Korean War in the
1950s and the Vietnam War from the 1960s to the 1970s were clearly
understood by Chinese leaders as indirect wars against China. It is just
that these wars were skillfully navigated by People's Republic of China
(PRC) founder Mao Zedong and his generation of leaders. A famous saying
Mao left the Chinese people is: "\[W\]e mean that its nature will never
change, that the imperialists will never lay down their butcher knives,
that they will never become Buddhas, till their doom."

And this is why the PRC has been preparing for a potential invasion by
the US since they were founded. To gain the Soviet Union's support, Mao,
who had always advocated for self-reliance, reluctantly signed a
"leaning to one side" Treaty of Friendship, Alliance and Mutual
Assistance with the USSR. In 1959 when Nikita Khrushchev tore up the
agreement, recalled Soviet specialists from China and took away the
blueprints, Marshal Chen Yi, the Chinese foreign minister, angrily
declared that China will develop its own nuclear arsenal even if it
means losing everything else.

'No First Use' for China

[The Chinese people]{.underline} have [never sought to
compete]{.underline} with the US [for world supremacy]{.underline}. Back
when the country wanted to make everyone a soldier, [it was always about
preparing to defeat enemies on Chinese soil]{.underline} should they
invade.

Today, China possesses atomic bombs, hydrogen bombs, a variety of
rockets, and an array of radars and satellites. [China has]{.underline}
all sorts of [advanced weaponry]{.underline}, including some that the US
does not have. The advanced aircraft [and]{.underline} anti-aircraft
weapons showcased at the Zhuhai Airshow clearly illustrate that China's
[military technology is **not inferior** to that of the US]{.underline}.

However, China is the only nuclear-armed country in the world that
maintains an unconditional No First Use of nuclear weapons policy. Many
Chinese believe that China should back out of this commitment. But I
think that this pledge is wise because it shows that China does not want
war and will not strike first.

[The US need not misjudge China --- China's commitment to this policy
underscores its **confidence** in its **nuclear deterrent**. Any
potential aggression]{.underline} against China [would have serious
consequences]{.underline}.

High cost of war

[Many academics think that war will break out]{.underline} between China
and the US over Taiwan or the South China Sea. But [I beg to differ,
because the **cost is too high** and the **returns too
little**]{.underline}.

[The **US** is already **deep in debt** and will not readily initiate
wars. It is not worthwhile to engage in a fate-altering war]{.underline}
with China [over Taiwan. The US will not undertake an **unprofitable
venture**]{.underline}. At the same time, [the US will not engage in a
showdown with China over the **S**]{.underline}outh
**[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea, effectively in China's
backyard. [The US simply cannot afford to lose]{.underline}.

[The US seeks to challenge and **create trouble for
China**]{.underline}, but it will not engage in unprofitable ventures.
It has never waged an all-out war against a comparable adversary and
will not enter conflicts without a high probability of victory.

Today, China's military capabilities are comparable to that of the US.
With a population of 1.4 billion, China can mobilise a wartime force of
nearly 300 million. Its steelmaking capacity is about ten times that of
the US, while its manufacturing output surpasses that of the US, Japan,
Germany and France combined.

This level of military power is unprecedented. The cost of challenging
such a colossal adversary is self-evident. Thus, the so-called
Thucydides's Trap simply does not exist between China and the US. Both
China and the US are aware that a war between them would have no winner,
only mutual destruction --- a catastrophe that neither country, nor the
world, can bear. In the face of such devastation, fighting for global
dominance becomes utterly meaningless.

[**Autocrats** start **risky wars**]{.underline}

[Three **historically consistent** patterns]{.underline} have
[emerged]{.underline} in the war in Ukraine. First, [[**autocracies**
are **more likely**]{.mark} than democracies [to start **risky
wars**]{.mark} they]{.underline} go on to **[lose]{.underline}**.
[[Dictators]{.mark} are]{.underline} more [willing to [initiate
**high-risk wars** because they know they can **crack down** on]{.mark}
political **[opposition]{.mark}** and remain in **power**]{.underline}
if the fight goes badly.

[[Iraq]{.underline}]{.mark}, for instance,
[[launched]{.underline}]{.mark} two [[**disastrous** invasions of
**Iran** and **Kuwait**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Even so, Saddam [Hussein
**crushed** internal uprisings]{.underline} to stay in power.
[[Democratic leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} often, but not always,
[avoid]{.underline} these kinds of **[military failures]{.underline}**,
[**[fear]{.mark}**ing]{.underline} the [[domestic]{.mark} **electoral
[backlash]{.mark}**]{.underline} of wars gone wrong. This is why
[democracies tend to **win** their **wars**]{.underline} ---
[and]{.underline} why they [wage **shorter wars**]{.underline} with
fewer casualties.

Like past authoritarians in Russia and elsewhere, Russian President
Vladimir [[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} has positioned himself
domestically. He has [steadily **[consolidated]{.mark}**]{.underline}
his hold on [[power]{.mark} over two decades]{.underline}, neutering the
Russian parliament and political opponents, and destroying Russia's
independent media.

[[Putin is]{.underline}]{.mark} now [[using that]{.mark} **unchecked
[power]{.mark}** [to crush]{.mark}]{.underline} minor outbreaks of
[[opposition]{.underline}]{.mark}, even from 7-year-old children. By
eradicating the last vestiges of free speech and press in Russia,
[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} may have [[felt
comfortable]{.underline}]{.mark} taking on the risk of [[invading
**Ukraine**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Few **hypotheses**]{.mark} in **i**]{.underline}nternational
**[r]{.underline}**elations [[are more **influential** than
**d**]{.underline}]{.mark}emocratic **[[p]{.underline}]{.mark}**eace
**[[t]{.underline}]{.mark}**heory---the idea that [[**democracies** do
not go to **war**]{.mark} with one another]{.underline}. [[The
idea]{.underline}]{.mark}, the political scientist Jack Levy wrote,
"[[comes]{.underline}]{.mark} as [[close]{.underline}]{.mark} as
anything we have [[to an **empirical law**]{.underline}]{.mark} in
international relations." [It has motivated]{.underline} U.S. **[foreign
policy]{.underline}** for nearly a century. In the early 1900s, U.S.
President Woodrow Wilson embraced democracy promotion as a means to
peace. During the Cold War, successive administrations spoke of the
standoff with the Soviet bloc using grand ideological terminology. No
distillation was grander than President Ronald Reagan's address before
the British Parliament in 1982, in which he claimed that the West
exercised "consistent restraint and peaceful intentions" and then
proceeded (seemingly without irony) to call for a "campaign for
democracy" and a "crusade for freedom" around the world.

**[D]{.underline}**emocratic **[p]{.underline}**eace
**[t]{.underline}**heory [became]{.underline} especially
[**influential** once the Cold War ended]{.underline}, leaving the
United States truly ascendant. In his 1994 State of the Union address,
President Bill [Clinton claimed]{.underline} that "[the best strategy to
ensure]{.underline} our [security]{.underline} and to build a durable
peace [is to support]{.underline} the [**advance of democracy**
elsewhere]{.underline}." His administration then surged aid to nascent
post-Soviet democracies. Clinton's successor, George W.
[Bush]{.underline}, [was **equally vocal**]{.underline} about the need
to advance liberalism in order to promote peace, telling the 2004
Republican National Convention, "As freedom advances, heart by heart,
and nation by nation, America will be more secure and the world more
peaceful." As president, Bush even used democratic peace theory as one
of the justifications for invading Iraq. In a speech on the war in
November 2003, he declared, "The advance of freedom leads to peace."

The idea that democracy breeds peace, however, is at best half true. The
United States has repeatedly attacked other countries. Europe's major
democracies also have a long history of intervening in other regions,
such as the Sahel. And rather than marking the permanent triumph of
liberal democracy, the post--Cold War period is now defined by growing
divisions and conflict. As is now plain, the spread of liberalism does
not by itself curtail fighting.

Yet [the]{.underline} proliferation of [**[wars]{.mark}** carried out by
**democracies** [does not **disprove**
**d**]{.mark}]{.underline}emocratic **[[p]{.underline}]{.mark}**eace
**[[t]{.underline}]{.mark}**heory wholesale. Liberal
[states]{.underline} may not act peaceably toward everyone, but they
[act **peaceably** toward one another]{.underline}. [[There are
**no**]{.underline}]{.mark} clear-cut [[cases of]{.underline}]{.mark}
one [[democracy going to war against **another**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[nor do any seem **forthcoming**]{.underline}. In fact, the [global
[divisions]{.mark}]{.underline} emerging [today [confirm
**d**]{.mark}]{.underline}emocratic **[[p]{.underline}]{.mark}**eace
**[[t]{.underline}]{.mark}**heory: once again, [the [line runs between
**liberal**]{.mark} **states** [and **authoritarian**
ones]{.mark}]{.underline}, with the **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} its mostly
**[democratic [allies]{.mark}]{.underline}** on one side [[and
**autocracies**]{.underline}]{.mark}, most notably China and Russia, [on
the other]{.underline}. The world, then, could be peaceful if all states
became liberal democracies. But until that happens, the world will
likely remain mired in a dangerous ideological standoff.

#### Liberal states are more [cooperative]{.underline} than autocracies. AND [economic interdependence]{.underline} means war is [zero sum]{.underline} for democracies.

[As **liberalism**]{.underline} endured and [spread]{.underline},
[intellectuals began]{.underline} empirically [testing whether
**d**emocratic **p**eace **t**heory]{.underline} actually
[held]{.underline} true. In 1939, the American journalist Clarence
Streit published a qualitative historical analysis to see whether
liberal democracies tended to maintain peace among themselves.
Discerning that [the answer was **yes**]{.underline}, he proposed that
the decade's [leading [**democracies** form a]{.mark} federal
**[union]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which would help protect them from
fascist powers. In 1972, Dean Babst, building on Quincy Wright's
magisterial A Study of War from 30 years earlier, carried out a
[[statistical analysis]{.underline}]{.mark} that also
[[suggested]{.underline}]{.mark} a [[correlation between **democracy**
and **peace**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In 1976, Melvin Small and J. David
Singer confirmed this finding but demonstrated that democratic peace was
limited to relations between democracies. Republics, they showed, were
still prone to fight autocratic regimes.

In the decades since, international relations scholars have continued to
study the democratic peace paradigm. They have shown that [the
**[relationship]{.mark}** between **democracy** and **peace** [is
**statistically significant**]{.mark} even when controlling for
**proximity**]{.underline}, **[wealth]{.underline}**, [and
**trade**]{.underline}. They have determined that [the theory holds even
when states]{.underline} attempt to [**constrain** each
other]{.underline}.

Academics have advanced a wide variety of explanations for why the
concept is so sturdy. Some have argued that [part of [the reason lies
in]{.mark}]{.underline} the disproportionate
[[influence]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[international **institutions**
have with **liberal countries**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Research shows
that [[democracies]{.underline}]{.mark} tend to
[[delegate]{.underline}]{.mark} a lot of [policymaking
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} complex **[[multilateral
bodies]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[such as the]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[E]{.underline}**uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion and the
**[[W]{.underline}]{.mark}**orld **[[T]{.underline}]{.mark}**rade
**[[O]{.underline}]{.mark}**rganization, in part because their
[[leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} can [use]{.underline} these [groups to
**[entrench]{.mark} policies**]{.underline} before cycling out of
office. Other scholars have argued that [[liberal **norms**]{.mark}
favoring]{.underline} **[peace]{.underline}**, human rights, [and
respect for]{.underline} fellow [**democracies** hold sway over
**policymakers**]{.underline} and publics. And still others have pointed
to the [benefits of **trade** and economic **interdependence**
associated with]{.underline} relations among capitalist
**[democracies]{.underline}**. [[States that]{.underline}]{.mark}
frequently **[[trade]{.underline}]{.mark}**, after all, [will [lose
**wealth** if they **fight**]{.mark}]{.underline} one another.

Still, democratic peace theory has attracted plenty of critics. Henry
Farber and Joanne Gowa have pointed out that there are other forces at
work in stopping wars between democracies. During the Cold War, for
example, NATO's need to protect itself from the Soviet bloc ensured that
Western Europe cooperated---although the region's post--Cold War peace
suggests more than collaborative containment is at work. Other scholars
have pointed out that none of the factors used to explain democratic
peace theory can stop war on its own. States that are deeply involved in
international institutions, after all, do launch invasions. Peaceful
norms and ideas work only if democracies heed them in the policymaking
process, yet they are often ignored. The shared decision-making powers
of republics should encourage deliberation, but the division of powers
and rotation of elites can also lead democracies to send mixed signals,
putting other states on edge.

And economic benefits can be achieved through plunder, not just through
trade. Powerful democratic states can have rational incentives to
exploit wealthy, weak democracies, especially if the latter are endowed
with natural resources or strategic assets such as shipping lanes.
Rational material interest is not enough to explain why xenophobic
democracies have not tried to conquer democracies of other ethnic
groups.

But [[put all the **explanatory factors** together]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[and **d**]{.underline}]{.mark}emocratic
**[[p]{.underline}]{.mark}**eace **[[t]{.underline}]{.mark}**heory
[[coheres]{.underline}]{.mark}. When [[governments are constrained
by]{.mark} international [institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}, when
political [[elites]{.underline}]{.mark} or the electorate [are
[committed to]{.mark}]{.underline} norms of
**[[liberty]{.underline}]{.mark}**, when [the **public**'s views are
reflected through]{.underline} representative
**[institutions]{.underline}**, [[and]{.mark} when [democracies
**trade**]{.mark} and **invest** in one another]{.underline},
[[conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark} among republics [[are **peacefully

### Disease

#### The [largest dataset]{.underline} shows democracies are [more]{.underline} effective at preventing [outbreaks]{.underline}\-\--democracies [cooperate]{.underline}, learn from [failures]{.underline}, and are held [accountable]{.underline} by [citizens]{.underline}.

With the world at a standstill due to coronavirus, authoritarian
approaches to rein in COVID-19 are increasingly seen by some as a
possible model for the United States.

Not so fast, says one University of Nevada, Reno social psychologist.

"Recently in the news, we've seen China having really great short-term
gains with regards to its strategy," said Markus Kemmelmeier, social
psychology professor and program director.

The authoritarian actions, which reportedly include lockdowns and mobile
tracking of citizens, are apparently leading to improving numbers. "Even
if the numbers are not completely accurate, it's really remarkable how
well that has worked in the short term," Kemmelmeier said. "In the long
term, however, that's not going to work well."

According to Kemmelmeier, the **[[virus]{.underline}]{.mark}**' [rapid
spread [occurred]{.mark}]{.underline} very [early]{.underline} on [[due
to]{.underline}]{.mark} two key ingredients: [high **mobility** and [an
**authoritarian government**]{.mark}]{.underline}. "In a highly mobile
society with a modern transportation system, people can come and go very
quickly," he said. "[An outbreak in]{.underline} such a society coupled
with [a [government]{.mark}]{.underline} that is mainly [[interested in
**suppressing**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[rather than
**addressing**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[the problem]{.mark} is a recipe
for **disaster**]{.underline}."

Meanwhile, back in the United States, the government's handling of
COVID-19 has been uneven -- prompting some unfavorable comparisons with
other governments' approaches. Yet, [over time]{.underline},
[[**democratic** societies appear to be **more effective**]{.mark} than
**authoritarian** cultures [in dealing with]{.mark}]{.underline} major
threats that include [**[disease]{.mark}** epidemics]{.underline}. [The
finding is from a]{.underline} recent **[study]{.underline}** by
Kemmelmeier and social psychology doctoral student Kodai Kusano,
completed prior to the pandemic. It was recently published in the
journal Royal Society Open Science.

"I want to give some hope," Kemmelmeier said. " Whatever we think about
America at this moment, as a species, the 'killer app' (key attribute)
for humans is cooperation. [In times of **crisis**]{.underline},
[[**cooperation** increases]{.underline}]{.mark}. Freedoms are always
related to our ability to cooperate. It turns out [when people
**cooperate**]{.underline} on a voluntary basis, [they're]{.underline}
actually really, [really **good** at [reducing]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[threat from]{.mark} **pandemics** and]{.underline} from
**[[pathogens]{.underline}]{.mark}** more generally."

Kemmelmeier sees light at the end of the tunnel. "It's something hopeful
-- in the long term, this is good news for us," he said. "We're in the
middle of it, and it's messy. That's part of democracy.
[Democracies]{.underline} over the long haul -- even with politics and
division -- to the extent they can [foster **trust** in
**institutions**]{.underline}, [can be]{.underline} highly [successful
at addressing **outbreaks**]{.underline}."

[Kusano and Kemmelmeier analyzed the relationship between **democracy**
and **environment**]{.underline}, and how societies adapt to a variety
of ecological threats, including viruses and other disease agents known
collectively as pathogens. To examine these dynamics, [they
created]{.underline} arguably [[the **largest data set ever**]{.mark}
assembled]{.underline}, analyzing data from 1949-2016. They found that
democracies both shape and are shaped by ecological factors in ways not
previously understood.

The researchers looked at three factors in measuring democracy, in
essence a society's level of self-determination. [They used]{.underline}
these [**three** components]{.underline} to represent a range of many
relevant indicators of democracy:

1.  [The **electoral** component]{.underline} -- the extent to which
    citizens achieve democratic election free from irregularities such
    as bribery

2.  [The **liberal** component]{.underline} -- the extent to which
    citizens' political activities are protected by civil liberties

3.  [The **participatory** component]{.underline} -- the extent to which
    citizens actively participate in all parts of the political
    processes.

Kusano and Kemmelmeier's [findings are [reflected]{.mark} in this
**overview**]{.underline} of pathogen prevalence as an influencing
factor on democracy, and vice versa:

- High Pathogen → Low Democracy: The study's findings suggest that
  pathogen prevalence impedes the development of a liberal democracy.
  During an outbreak, survival depends on people banding together --
  even if that means being unified separately while practicing today's
  social distancing. Those with common bonds or interests stick
  together, while others may feel like or be seen as outsiders. Personal
  freedoms may be restricted.

- Low Pathogen → High Democracy: A low prevalence of pathogens
  facilitates higher levels of democracy. A greater mix between groups
  across the social landscape is the norm because survival isn't in the
  balance. When ecological pressures (including from pathogens) are low,
  there is much less of a need for social conformity. Individual
  freedoms can be high, as people decide by themselves what they want.

- [**High Democracy** → **Low Pathogen**]{.underline}: [The **data**
  clearly show]{.underline} that [functioning]{.underline}
  (**[[high]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [[**democracies** are better at
  reducing **pathogen prevalence**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In other words,
  [high level democracies]{.underline} precede and [lead to **low**
  pathogen **prevalence**]{.underline}. [Democracies are
  **accountable**]{.underline}, as people are rewarded for identifying
  problems (a pat on the back, public recognition, a Pulitzer, for
  example).

- [**Low Democracy** → **High Pathogen**]{.underline}: Low ([[less
  functioning]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[democracies are **less
  effective**]{.mark} at reducing pathogen prevalence]{.underline}. The
  [[findings are]{.underline}]{.mark} very
  **[[clear]{.underline}]{.mark}** in this regard: [Countries with a
  high level of **democratization** are likely to see]{.underline} a
  greater [**reduction** of **pathogens** in the future]{.underline},
  compared to countries with a lower level of democratization.
  [[Those]{.underline}]{.mark} living [[under **authoritarian** rule
  are]{.underline}]{.mark} generally [[powerless]{.mark} to
  hold]{.underline} the [government **accountable**]{.underline}.
  Pointing out problems is not rewarded, while societal ills are
  suppressed.

[[**Accountability** is]{.underline}]{.mark} a
**[[key]{.underline}]{.mark}** factor. "Essentially, [[democratic
societies]{.underline}]{.mark}, which tend to [[emphasize]{.mark}
individual **[rights]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [are]{.underline} actually
[**better** over the **long haul** at dealing with]{.underline} these
kinds of **[threats]{.underline}**," Kemmelmeier said. "Democratically
elected [governments are **accountable**]{.underline} to the people.
[That is]{.underline} always going to be [the vulnerability
of]{.underline} every [[**authoritarian** regime]{.underline}]{.mark},
because they're not accountable. They're not necessarily doing the
prevention; [they [are **not**]{.mark}]{.underline} necessarily
[[building]{.mark} **national [capacity]{.mark}**]{.underline} to
respond to disasters. And they don't reward people for sniffing out the
problems."

[[In]{.mark} the wake of a]{.underline} major
**[[crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}**, public [[officials are more
**accountable** through]{.underline}]{.mark} elections and other facets
of **[[democracies]{.underline}]{.mark}**. "I don't think there's any
politician who, in future pandemics, can say, 'This is not a problem;
there are just a few cases, and they're going to go away by
themselves,'" Kemmelmeier said. "Those days are gone because now it's
part of the political agenda and in everybody's thinking, at least in
our generation. Now, our kids' generation will have to prove that they
at least thought about the gravity of the situation."

While there's no predicting when the next disaster or pathogen event
will occur, Kusano and Kemmelmeier's research found that
[[**democratic** cultures]{.underline}]{.mark} over time [[learn from
one **disaster** and are]{.mark} better [prepared for the **next
one**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- with casualties for future events
dramatically reduced.

"[[In]{.mark} a]{.underline} more [[**authoritarian**
society]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, in which the idea is 'OK, get
over this,' [[nothing **changes**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and you suffer
from this," Kemmelmeier said. "The next time \[in an authoritarian
culture\], you may have a higher level of casualties. This means you
will have a lower workforce, lower productivity. It's not only people
and lives for the humanitarian reasons that these societies suffer, but
also for economic reasons."

In the long term, the study suggests that democracies' effectiveness in
mitigating major threats reduces stresses on their citizens, which can
strengthen democracy. "Democracies continuously build the basis of their
existence," he said. "They need to prove that they can deal with the
problems that people face. This means that democracy, when effective,
can spread. But even democracies can fail if they're corrupt or
ineffective."

According to Kemmelmeier, [[**trust** is **an**]{.mark}other [attribute
of **democracies**]{.mark}]{.underline}, one that translates a dangerous
situation into a response. "In a democracy, there is actually a fairly
high level of trust," he said. "[People]{.underline} who are [under
siege]{.underline} tend to [trust the **institution**]{.underline}, for
things that institutions do for them that people can't do for
themselves. [[During]{.underline}]{.mark} a
**[[crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[people trust]{.mark} **democratic
[institutions]{.mark}** to keep their]{.underline} best [interests in
mind]{.underline}, so [when the order comes]{.underline} out from the
government, [everybody falls in line]{.underline}."

### Warming

[**Empirical** Evidence]{.underline}

If theoretic expectations for climate-fixing democracy should be low, in
principle, [[what does]{.mark} the [**evidence**
indicate]{.mark}]{.underline}? This section reviews
[**[cross-national]{.mark}** statistical
**[analyses]{.mark}**]{.underline} published in the past two decades,
with a focus on physical outcomes related to climate-change mitigation
since 1990. This body of evidence [[yields **ambiguous**
results]{.underline}]{.mark} that are [consistent with a
**regime-agnostic** position]{.underline}.

Several [previous reviews]{.underline} of empirical literature on
environmental policy have [shed]{.underline} some [light on the theory
of **clean democracy**]{.underline}. [[Fiorino]{.underline}]{.mark}
reviewed about a dozen studies and [[found]{.underline}]{.mark}
generally [[**pro-democratic** results]{.mark} on environmental
protection]{.underline} but with reservations about climate change in
particular.38 Similarly, [Dasgupta and [De Cian found in favor of
**democracies**]{.mark}]{.underline}' general **[green
credentials]{.underline}** but, in a sub-sample of eleven analyses of
carbo n emissions, a mixture of four pro-democratic results, five null
or ambiguous results, and two anti-democratic results.39 [Bernauer
reviewed]{.underline} climate-change [**studies** in relation
to]{.underline} a wide variety of [domestic]{.underline} and
international [factors]{.underline}, [finding]{.underline} among
[**[thirty-four]{.mark}** sources]{.underline} cited on the effects of
national-level institutions [that regime type had]{.underline} "[[no
**robust**]{.underline}]{.mark} significant
[[effect]{.underline}]{.mark}" [[on]{.mark}
**g**]{.underline}reen**[h]{.underline}**ouse-**[g]{.underline}**as
**[[emissions]{.underline}]{.mark}**.40 In a recent and more focused
review of "the democracy-climate nexus," the seventy-two sources
consulted found either an ambiguous or a negative association between
liberal democracies and policy outcomes that mitigated climate change
more than twice as often as they found a positive association, though
much [[stronger **links**]{.mark} were [identified between **democracy**
and]{.mark}]{.underline} the [adoption of]{.underline} new **[[climate
policies]{.underline}]{.mark}**.41

Here, [I offer the most **thorough review**]{.underline} to date on
three areas of policy related to climate-change mitigation:
greenhouse-gas emissions, deforestation, and energy use.42 My procedure
was to search peer-reviewed, English-language venues from 2003 to 2023,
including disciplinary journals in economics, sociology, and political
science, as well as topical journals on environment, energy, and natural
resources.

The [focus here is]{.underline} on cross-national (**[large
N]{.underline}**) [analyses using **quantitative** methods]{.underline},
which have particular virtues and limitations for empirical analysis.
Statistical associations in global datasets can neither confirm nor
reject a causal theory on their own. Instead, they offer tools for
comparing the relative strengths of multiple factors---political
institutions, economic structures, demographic characteristics, and so
on---in relation to observable features of climate-change policy. The
question to ask is whether a given pattern of statistical results looks
consistent with a relevant causal theory. If the answer is yes, further
analysis with different methods may establish causality; if the answer
is no, the causal theory itself may be reasonably doubted.

I initially identified eighty-one peer-reviewed sources from the past
two decades in which the authors conducted at least one analysis of the
relationship between national regime type (the independent variable) and
climate-change mitigation (the dependent variable). I then narrowed this
sample according to criteria of chronology, geography, and economics.
Chronologically, global warming through the accumulation of greenhouse
gases in the atmosphere was not a major item on the agendas of national
policymakers before the later 1980s,43 and the first international
treaty on climate change was negotiated in 1992. Before about 1990,
therefore, political institutions were generally not in a position to
affect greenhouse-gas sources or sinks in intentional rather than
incidental ways. Geographically and economically, it is important to
consider analyses that cover diverse regions of the world and that
include poor, middle-income, and rich nations alike. These three
criteria of restriction leave seventy-four distinct analyses from
thirty-three peer-reviewed articles.44

Of these seventy-four analyses, 46 percent produced a normatively
positive result for democracy, 34 percent yielded a null result, and 20
percent found democracy to have made matters worse for climate change.
These slightly positive results require further interpretation in light
of the distinction between policy outputs and policy outcomes.45 Whereas
an output is a promulgation of a new policy related to climate change,
an outcome is an observable change in the relevant physical processes.
The passage of a law and the signing of a treaty count as policy
outputs, whereas the physical states of carbon sources (e.g., tailpipes)
and sinks (e.g., trees) count as policy outcomes. Of the seventy-four
analyses under review, twenty-three involve outputs and fifty-one
involve outcomes. The difference in results between these two types of
analysis is notable: for outputs, 74 percent of findings (n = 17 of 23)
were positive on democracy, compared with 17 percent null and 9 percent
negative; for outcomes, 33 percent (n = 17 of 51) were positive,
compared with 41 percent null and 25 percent negative. In other words,
nearly [[**three** out of **four**]{.mark} **analyses**]{.underline} of
climate-change outputs [found [in **favor** of
**democracy**]{.mark}]{.underline}, whereas one out of three analyses of
climate-change outcomes did the same.

These [[results confirm]{.underline}]{.mark} a point that is familiar to
experts on climate-change policy: [[democracies'
superiority]{.underline}]{.mark} lies [in enacting
**policies**]{.underline} more than achieving results.46 This
distinction appears to support a "signing ceremony" theory of the
democracy-climate nexus: [democratic
**[institutions]{.mark}**]{.underline} systematically
[[cause]{.underline}]{.mark} political [[leaders to make]{.mark}
**formal [efforts]{.mark}** [or]{.mark} public [**commitments** to
mitigate **climate change**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[to an
extent]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[**autocratic** regimes **cannot
rival**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The problem is that democracies' weakness
at realizing their climate-policy objectives seems to defeat the
presumed normative goal behind efforts at climate-change mitigation,
which is to alter the reality of atmospheric carbonization and
destabilization.

## Democracy Bad

### War

#### Backsliding [creates]{.underline} autocratic peace.

Theory

The scholarly discussion of how regime type affects the likelihood of
war has produced a myriad of research. The most prominent approach to
this issue, the [Democratic Peace]{.underline}, is based on the logic
initially introduced by Kant (2008) and reinforced by the empirical
phenomenon that democracies rarely fight each other (Mesquita, 2006,
p.637). According to proponents this is due to a set of unique normative
and institutional characteristics associated with democracy (Rosato,
2003, p.586). However, these [findings]{.underline} have been
**[challenged]{.underline}**.2 Gartzke (2007) argued that the findings
of the democratic peace theory are spurious and that liberal capitalism
is the driving factor behind this phenomenon.3 Cederman (2001) on the
other hand, attributes the empirical findings to a historic learning
process between democracies. However, he also finds that, "some learning
appears to spill over" into non-democratic dyads. Another attempt was
made by Rosato (2003), he challenged the very foundation of the
assumptions underlying the democratic peace. He argues that both the
**[normative]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[institutional]{.underline}** [logic presented]{.underline} by
democratic peace theorists [is **flawed**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[cannot be supported by]{.underline} the [**empirical**
evidence]{.underline}.

These findings suggest that the [causal mechanism between democracy and
peace]{.underline} [is not]{.underline} as [straightforward]{.underline}
as sometimes purported by the proponents of the democratic peace.
Therefore, a more nuanced understanding of the phenomenon is needed. An
appealing approach to this issue is to examine if the characteristics
linked to the democratic peace are unique for democracies. Under the
slogan of "**[autocratic peace]{.underline}**" [several
**studies**]{.underline} have been [published]{.underline} trying to
take on this issue. It was argued that similar to democratic constraints
there are autocratic [**constraints** reducing]{.underline} the
likelihood of [conflict]{.underline} (Rosato, 2003). Some pointed out
that [political **similarities**]{.underline} [decrease]{.underline} the
**[likelihood of conflict]{.underline}** and that this link not only
exists between democracies but between autocratic regimes as well
(Bennett, 2006; Oren and Hays, 1997; Peceny et al., 2002). [**Systemic**
level **factors**]{.underline}, particularly the global distribution of
regime types, was [also identified]{.underline} as having an effect on
the relationship between regime type and conflict (Gartzke and Weisiger,
2013; Weisiger and Gartzke, 2016). However, this essay will focus on the
link between audience costs and peace and how regime type affects this
relationship.4 An important contribution in this regard was made by
Weeks (2008a). She argues that [some characteristics linked to the
democratic peace are **not**]{.underline} as [**unique** for
democracies]{.underline} as usually expected. In doing so she builds on
the concept of **[audience costs]{.underline}** introduced by Fearon
(1994) and **[extend]{.underline}**s this logic [to]{.underline}
specific kinds of [autocracies]{.underline}.

#### **Audience Costs.**

**Velasco '18** \[Emily; July 18; Caltech, "Democracies More Prone to
Start Wars -- Except When They\'re Not,"

[What]{.underline} kind of political [leader is]{.underline} most
[likely to start a war]{.underline}---an invective-spewing dictator or
the elected head of a democratic nation? Surprisingly,
**[science]{.underline}** [says it\'s]{.underline} probably [**not** the
**autocrat**]{.underline}.

Leaders of [democratic nations]{.underline} actually [have
**Stronger**]{.underline} [incentives to start]{.underline} and
exacerbate [conflicts with other countries]{.underline} than their
autocratic counterparts, suggests a new study published by the American
Journal of Political Science.

[The difference]{.underline} [boils down to]{.underline} **[public
pressure]{.underline}**, [say the study]{.underline}\'s authors, Michael
Gibilisco of Caltech and Casey Crisman-Cox of Texas A&M University.
[Because of]{.underline} **[pressure]{.underline}** [from]{.underline}
**[voters]{.underline}** [to not **back down**]{.underline} [and
**appear weak**]{.underline}, [**democratic** leaders]{.underline} tend
to [act more **aggressively**]{.underline} [in]{.underline}
international [conflicts]{.underline}. [An autocrat]{.underline}, on the
other hand, [is answerable to]{.underline} **[no one]{.underline}** [and
can]{.underline} **[back down]{.underline}** from a conflict
[without]{.underline} facing personal [consequences]{.underline}.

\"[If an elected leader]{.underline} [makes a threat]{.underline} during
a conflict with another country [and]{.underline} [the threat isn\'t
**followed through**]{.underline}, [they]{.underline} may [face a
decrease in **approval ratings**]{.underline}, [or they may **lose an
election**]{.underline},\" says Gibilisco, assistant professor of
political science. [In democracies]{.underline}, he notes,
[voters]{.underline} can [punish their leaders]{.underline} for
appearing weak---[these]{.underline} punishments or consequences [are
known as]{.underline} \"**[audience costs]{.underline}**\" in political
science parlance. [To avoid those]{.underline} costs, [leaders in
**representative governments** become]{.underline} **[more
aggressive]{.underline}** during disputes.

In their study, Gibilisco and Crisman-Cox, who is also an assistant
professor of political science, first developed a [**mathematical
model** of dispute initiation]{.underline} between countries and then
[fit the **model** to]{.underline} data of **[actual
conflicts]{.underline}** that occurred among 125 countries [between
1993--2007]{.underline}.

T[hey]{.underline} also [estimated **audience costs**]{.underline} for
the countries in their sample using existing databases containing
country-by-country information on levels of democracy and press freedom.
In general, they found that audience costs are [**highest** in
democracies]{.underline} [with]{.underline} [strong **protections** for
a **free press.**]{.underline}

However, they also found that audience costs are much lower in
democracies that have a rival that threatens their existence. (For
example, South Korea\'s existential rival is North Korea.) One reason,
the researchers say, is that a nation\'s voters will give their leader
more leeway in deciding how to resolve a conflict with an existential
rival, because survival is more of a concern than saving face.

In contrast to democracies, [dictatorships tend to have low audience
costs]{.underline}, but here, too, Gibilisco and Crisman-Cox found an
exception. Dictatorships that provide a legal mechanism for removing a
leader---as was the case in China before it abolished term limits this
past March---have higher audience costs.

Once the researchers produced an audience-cost estimate for each
country, they considered how changing a country\'s audience costs
affects its willingness to engage in conflict. Overall, they found,
[**increasing** a country\'s **audience costs**]{.underline}, perhaps
[by strengthening **democratic institutions**]{.underline}, [makes it
**more likely** to start a conflict]{.underline}.

Because we view democratization as a gradual process, rather than a
sudden change, [we test]{.underline} whether a [transition toward
democracy]{.underline} occurring over one, five, and ten years [is
associated with]{.underline} the subsequent onset of war. To assess the
strength of the relationship between democratization and war, we
construct a series **[of]{.underline}** contingency tables. Based on
those tables, we compare the probability that a democratizing state
subsequently goes to war with the probabilities of war for states in
transition toward autocracy and for states undergoing no regime change.
The [results]{.underline} of all of these tests [show that
democratizing]{.underline} [states were]{.underline} **[more
likely]{.underline}** [to **fight**]{.underline} wars [than were states
that had undergone **no change**]{.underline} in regime. This
relationship is weakest one year into democratization and strongest at
ten years. During any given ten-year period, [a state experiencing no
regime change had about]{.underline} **[one]{.underline}** chance **[in
six]{.underline}** [of fighting a]{.underline} [war]{.underline} in the
following decade. In the decade [following democratization]{.underline},
[a state's chance]{.underline} of fighting a war w[as]{.underline} about
**[one in four]{.underline}**. [When we analyze the
components]{.underline} of our measure of democratization
[separately]{.underline}, [the results are similar]{.underline}. On
average, [an increase in the openness of]{.underline} the
[selection]{.underline} process [for the chief executive doubled the
likelihood of war]{.underline}. Increasing the competitiveness of
political participation or increasing the constraints on a country's
chief executive (both aspects of democratization) also made war more
likely. On average, these changes increased the likelihood of war by
about 90 percent and 35 percent respectively.

The [statistical results]{.underline} are even [more dramatic when we
analyze cases in which the process]{.underline} of democratization
[culminated in]{.underline} very **[high levels]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} mass [participation in politics]{.underline}. States
changing from a [mixed regime to democracy were]{.underline} on average
about [**50 percent** more likely to become engaged in
**war**]{.underline} (and about two-thirds more likely to go to war with
another nation-state) than states that remained mixed regimes.

[The effect was greater still for]{.underline} those [states making the
largest leap]{.underline}, from **[full autocracy]{.underline}** [to
high levels]{.underline} [of]{.underline} **[democracy]{.underline}**.
Such states were on average about **[two-thirds]{.underline}** [more
likely to]{.underline} become [involved]{.underline} [in
any]{.underline} type of **[war]{.underline}** (and about twice as
likely to become involved in an interstate war) than states that
remained autocracies. Though this evidence shows that democratization is
dangerous, its reversal offers no easy solutions. On average, [changes
toward autocracy]{.underline} also yielded an increase in the
probability of war, though a [smaller]{.underline} one than changes
toward democracy, compared to states experiencing no regime change.

In contrast to these existing explanations, I argue that the [rationale
for war]{.underline} is often [grounded in domestic
politics]{.underline}. Across a wide range of cases and
circumstances---ranging from the failed defense of Europe in 1940 to the
escalation of American involvement in Vietnam two and a half decades
later---[leaders]{.underline} sometimes [choose to participate in
aggressive **military** behavior for fear that doing
otherwise]{.underline} [will permanently **jeopardize** their **domestic
reputation**]{.underline} [or]{.underline} **[political
standing]{.underline}** [at home]{.underline}. Put simply, my central
finding is that [leaders]{.underline} often engage in or [escalate
military operations in order to **satisfy**]{.underline} the demands of
their political **[constituents]{.underline}**. Indeed, even in Denmark,
the only country that accepted the Reich's offer, officials considered
mounting a symbolic defense to safeguard public opinion even as German
troops swarmed the capital.⁴ I develop the theory using an analytic
stylization of a military crisis in which [government leaders possess
**private information**]{.underline} [about]{.underline} the [costs and
risks of escalation]{.underline}. [Because this]{.underline} information
[is]{.underline} not [publicly available]{.underline}, the leader's
[constituents may]{.underline} under some circumstances
[harbor]{.underline} naïvely [optimistic beliefs about]{.underline} the
desirability of [using force]{.underline}. Indeed,
[citizens]{.underline} [may]{.underline} even [threaten to **penalize**
leaders who pursue]{.underline} **[peace]{.underline}**ful settlements.
In these situations, [leaders who seek to avoid violence]{.underline}
[face a **dilemma**]{.underline}: although [they could attempt to
**dispel** their constituents']{.underline} martial [enthusiasm by
sharing **sobering** information]{.underline} about the true costs of
war, [in doing so they would]{.underline} [run two risks]{.underline}.
First, [a signal may not fully attenuate their
constituents']{.underline} [support]{.underline} for war. [If
voters]{.underline} **[misinterpret]{.underline}** the message [as
evidence]{.underline} that [the leader is **unskilled**]{.underline} in
military affairs or dovish, [citizens]{.underline} may [react by
penalizing the leader]{.underline} or installing an alternative who
would escalate with greater intensity, thereby negating the
predecessor's effort to avoid conflict. On the other hand, [a leader who
successfully **reveals**]{.underline} the country's
**[weakness]{.underline}** to a domestic audience [may inadvertently
also share the]{.underline} [information with **international
observers**]{.underline}. Such disclosures could jeopardize the nation's
bargaining position by emboldening the opponent to demand costlier
concessions than they might otherwise attempt to extract or,
alternatively, by dissuading potential allies from offering support.
These [risks]{.underline} [motivate leaders to conceal]{.underline}
their true **[pessimism]{.underline}** about war. Instead, [leaders will
sometimes **pursue escalation**]{.underline} [despite]{.underline}
private **[knowledge]{.underline}** [that accepting a settlement would
leave the country better off]{.underline}.

Power Change?" Ch. 4\] Ananth

My own proposal for solving the problem, developed together with my
colleague Jonas Wolff (Müller 2004. Muller/Wolff 2006). turns the issue
upside down: We do not start with explaining mutual democratic
peacefulness, but its opposite: the [proven capability]{.underline} [of
**democracies** to act]{.underline} **[aggressively]{.underline}**
[against **non-democracies**]{.underline}. We note that---apart from
self-defense where there is no difference between democracies and
non-democracies---[democratic states go to war]{.underline}---in
contrast to non-democracies---[to uphold **international
law**]{.underline} (or their own interpretation thereof), [to
prevent]{.underline} **[anarchy]{.underline}** [through state
failure]{.underline}, to "save strangers" when dictatorships massacre
their own people, [and to]{.underline} **[promote
democracy]{.underline}**. None of these acts is likely to find its
target in a democracy. Since the use of force by democracies is hardly
possible without public justification, even the rhetorical use of the
said reasons will not stand public scrutiny when uttered against a
democracy---people will not believe it, War other than for self-defense
thus can only be fought by democracies against non-democracies because
against a fellow democracy justification would fail.

Wolff s and my hypothesis was developed in the context of the
"antinomies of democratic peace/\' This theory elaborates the
fundamental ambivalence of the central normative elements of liberal
thought which is at the heart of democracy. The same [norms that force
democracies to prefer non- violence]{.underline}---human life, human
dignity, habeas corpus, bodily integrity, **[freedom]{.underline}** from
torture, and so forth---can [motivate democracies to take up
**arms**]{.underline} in order [to prevent **others** from
**violating**]{.underline} these norms or to terminate such violation.
This approach focusing on normative ambivalence was at the [heart of
PRIF\'s]{.underline} (Peace Research Institute Frankfurt) multi-year
[research program]{.underline} "antinomies of the democratic peace\"
(Geis et al. 2006; Geis et al. 2013). It has also been picked up by
other scholars, notably Georg Sorensen (2007). Beate Jahn has argued
that the potential of militancy is not inherent in enlightenment
humanism like Kant\'s, but was inserted later into liberal thought by
justifiers of imperialism such as John S. Mill (Jahn 2005). Jahn's
position is undermined by Kant\'s license to use force against an
"unjust enemy" and, after victory, impose a "regime change" in order to
install a less aggressive system of rule. Michael Dcsch, in contrast,
ascribes militancy to the whole liberal edifice. Kant included, but
ignored the exceptional, non-routine, noncvcryday position which the
"unjust enemy" assumes in his moral theory (Desch 2007). From this
discussion of alternative readings of Kant, the main elements of the
"antinomy"-approach hold: liberal-democratic thought has been ambivalent
from its early formation days on. and this characteristic is an inherent
and not an externally added artefact, but it also means that this
ambivalence does not make every version on liberal thinking and every
liber- al actor militant.

Because whether this is the case or not to a degree that justifies war
as the 'ultimate means" must rely on practical judgments. and practical
judgments can differ among even reasonable people. democracies might
disagree whether or not the judgment applies in specific cases.
Democracies also show variance in that regard due (o a systematic.
political-culturally rooted different propensity to judge situations as
justifing war or not, and to participate in such wars (Gels et al,
2013). It should also be noted that, given the continuum between
autocracy, anocracy and democracy, whether a given state is a democracy
or not can be subject to interpretation. and this interpretation may
even change over time (Oren 1995, Hayes 2013).

The fact is that [there are]{.underline} a couple of **[fairly
warlike]{.underline}** democracies, and that the
[Democracies]{.underline} [participating most
**frequently**]{.underline} in military disputes (apart from the special
case of Israel) [are]{.underline}, by and [large **major
powers**]{.underline} [such as the **United States**]{.underline}, the
United Kingdom. France. or India. This pattern is important to keep in
mind when the question of the utility of democratic peace for today 's
world problems is to be answered.

[Transnational **terrorism**]{.underline}, [failed states]{.underline},
[civil]{.underline} **[wars]{.underline}** and the like dominate the
international agenda on war and peace. At the classical level of
international relations, in the relationships among major powers.
developments arc undcr way which potentially pose an even greater threat
than this diverse collection of non-interstate problems presently does.
[We are living in an era of rather rapid and disturbing power
change]{.underline} (Tammcn et al. 2000). The United States are still
the leading power of the world with unprecedented militant and economic
poer. But others are coming closer: China. India. Braiil and Indonesia,
China is at the top of this cohort, [All major power changes challenge
existing structures]{.underline} and thus contain the potential for
great disturbance. The leading power may start to fear for its dominant
position and take measures to ensure its position at the lop. These
[actions]{.underline} may [frustrate emerging powers and]{.underline}
even [lead to the perception that]{.underline} their [security is
endangered]{.underline} [which would motivate
**countermeasures**]{.underline} that further propel a political
escalation spiral. An increasingly focused competition in which a true
power change appears increasingly possible. that is. a change of
position at the top of the international hierarchy, has an even greater
risk potential. If the inherent dangers are not contained---which
remains always a possibility major power war may ensue defying all
propositions that major war has become obsolete or that nuclear
deterrence will prevent this calamity once and for all.

Introduction

Whether [liberal **democracy** contributed to]{.underline} the
**[COVID]{.underline}**-19 [governance]{.underline} was a hot topic in
2020 ("Democracy and Rise of Authoritarianism in COVID-19 World", 2020).
At the end of January, 2020, [when **COVID**-19]{.underline} [witnessed
the lockdown]{.underline} of Wuhan City, [the West generally agreed that
China lacked **freedom**]{.underline} of speech and the inertia of a
rigid bureaucratic structure, and the national censorship system kept
the whistle blower Dr. Wenliang Li silent, which led to the disease out
of control (Mérieau, 2020). Democracies' confidence mainly came from
Amartya Sen's research on the famine. Sen (1999) has claimed that no
substantial famine has ever occurred in any independent and democratic
country with a relatively free press and there is no exception to this
rule. Citizens in democracies can expect governments to be more candid,
transparent, and responsible in dealing with all kinds of crises, which
authoritarian countries usually cannot (Berengaut, 2020; Bollyky &
Kickbusch, 2020). So Steve Bloomfield (2020) has regarded that if China
had a free press and transparent government, the pandemic could be
brought under control before the outbreak. In conclusion, freedom plus
democracy equals the COVID-19 antidote according to Western standards,
although Wilson and Wisongye have found that social media rumors can
exploit the right to freedom of speech and erode people's health
benefits (New York Times, 2021; Bollyky & Kickbusch, 2020).
[However]{.underline}, since March, 2020, [with Western democracies
seriously affected by **COVID**-19, their superiority of the **political
system** has begun to **expose** its untrue and **fatal
defects**]{.underline}. Especially when Wuhan began to lift its blockade
on April 8, 2020 (People.cn, 2020), [scholars]{.underline} and
journalists [began to question whether democracies had the **ability**
to **deal with the crisis**]{.underline} better than China (Mérieau,
2020). [Liberal democracy]{.underline} in the United States [has not
proved]{.underline} that it is [more conducive]{.underline} to the
COVID-19 governance [than authoritarianism]{.underline} since 2020.
[From a global perspective, not only do most democracies **fail to
contain**]{.underline} the **[spread]{.underline}** of COVID-19,
[but]{.underline} almost [**all of the 10 most affected** countries are
**liberal democracies**]{.underline} (Coronavirus Resource Center,
2021). [Their **policy responses** have a **poor effect** in reducing
the **death toll** in **early stages** of the crisis, as shown that
democratic political institutions may be at a **disad**vantage in
**respond**ing **quickly**]{.underline} to COVID-19 (Cepaluni, Dorsch, &
Branyiczki, 2020). More surprising is that the COVID-19 pandemic is so
serious in the United States, yet no government officials have been
removed from office because of their inactivity in fighting against the
corona-virus. People doubt whether American accountability mechanism is
still working. However, two impeachments against President Trump
indicate that it seems to function quite well (Valenta & Valenta, 2017;
Herb, Raju, Fox, & Mattingly, 2021). The direct loss to the United
States caused by Russiagate and incitement of insurrection is far less
than the pain caused by the failure of the COVID-19 governance, but no
any official in the United States is responsible for it. [If it
**again** faces infectious diseases **similar** to
**COVID**]{.underline}-19, [will it **repeat** this **unprecedented
tragedy**]{.underline}? Can liberal democracy and the separation and
balance of powers push American president to act more aggressively?
[Error-tolerantism explains that the fundamental reason for the failure
of]{.underline} American [COVID]{.underline}-19 [governance is a
**serious misunderstanding** of the concept of **freedom**]{.underline}
(Zhou, 2018; 2019; Zhou, Tan, & Liu, 2020). Liberalism has witnessed a
rare scene: In the context of COVID-19, the president, governors,
magistrates, and the public (Emery, Schwebke, & Park, 2020; Sullum,
2020; Behrmann, 2020; Kenton, 2020; Strano, 2020) have severe
misunderstanding of freedom [that cost **more than**]{.underline}
American **[600,000 lives]{.underline}** (Coronavirus Resource Center,
2021).

In response to the above phenomenon, error-tolerantism as the
development of liberalism defines liberty from a new perspective and
shows a stronger explanatory power than liberalism (Zhou et al., 2020).
The right paradigm of error-tolerantism, the right to be wrong (right to
trial and error) as an original right and mutual empowerment theory,
instead of natural rights theory and social contract theory, divides
liberty into the right to liberty in innovative fields, right to be
wrong as an original right, and the right to be right in non-innovative
fields as sub-rights. The lockdown of Wuhan means that Chinese
government has excised the power to be wrong as an original power, but
the West criticized it with the right to liberty at the level of
sub-rights, which is the first error in understanding liberty during
American COVID-19 governance; after Wuhan effectively controlled
COVID-19, its governance has transformed from an innovative field to a
non-innovative one. Then, liberties in non-innovative fields as the
sub-rights level, such as wearing face masks, keeping social distancing,
showing health codes, are formed definitely (Zhou et al., 2020).
However, [wearing **masks** has been regarded as a sign of **political
oppression** rather than a simple hygienic measure by the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates (Kahanel, 2021). Since
liberalism has a major misunderstanding of the concept of liberty,
[liberal democracy]{.underline} based on the philosophy of liberalism
[should be]{.underline} deeply reflected or even
**[reconstructed]{.underline}**, and it is very reasonable for
error-tolerant democracy constructed based on error-tolerantism [to
explore the defects]{.underline} of liberal democracy [in]{.underline}
American [COVID]{.underline}-19 [governance]{.underline}. Therefore, we
first review scholars' relevant research on American democracy and the
COVID-19 governance, and then based on the theory of error-tolerant
democracy, discuss [the **defects** of]{.underline} liberal
**[democracy]{.underline}** and American political system that [are
**unable to cope** with the **crisis of the century**]{.underline}.

#### Democracies are [unable]{.underline} to implement [wide-ranging]{.underline} and [intense]{.underline} control measures\-\--that endangers [global]{.underline} health.

While noting these technical challenges, Narita and Sudo's conclusions
are powerful. They find that, averaged across all countries, Covid19
caused an extra 292 deaths per million people in 2020. But more striking
still, we learn that **[democracy]{.underline}** itself [resulted in
**more people dying** from **Covid-19**]{.underline}. This seems not to
be the result of a slow government response to the pandemic. Rather it
[appears to be because]{.underline} the **[control
measures]{.underline}** that were implemented [were **less
wide-ranging**]{.underline} [and not]{.underline} so
**[intense]{.underline}** [as in other types of regime]{.underline}. The
modelling suggests that the [USA]{.underline} incurred 1,050 [more
deaths]{.underline} per million population [than China]{.underline}
simply [because of the nature of its democratic system]{.underline} and
the way this influenced the pandemic control policies that were adopted.

Narita and Sudo also investigate whether systems of government affect
rates of economic growth and conclude that, since the turn of the
millennium, they have done so. Again, taking the USA and China as
examples, their analysis indicates that China's annual increase in GDP
(gross domestic product) was between 3.6 and 5.4 percentage points
higher than that of the USA purely on account of its system of
governance. They find that democracies had lower levels of investment,
traded less internationally, and added less value in both manufacturing
and services. These factors, they opine, might help to explain the
slower rates of growth.

The authors can only speculate, from their analysis, on why democracy
should have these detrimental effects. Possibly influenced by President
Trump's "American First" policy, they suggest that electorates might be
swayed by political rhetoric to "protect our jobs" and therefore be
supportive of trade tariffs. Lack of investment might reflect reliance
on the decisions of fund managers and the profit motive rather than the
strategic investment intended to directly benefit society that a strong
government can achieve.

The negative effect of democracy on economic growth is something new and
did not exist in the 1980s or 1990s. Possibly the governance in
countries like China has improved over the last 40 years. That said,
Narita and Sudo repeated their analysis with China removed found no
change in their results. Possibly, it is the democracies that have
changed. The legacy of the neoliberal ascendancy is clear. It
successfully demanded that governments should leave the economy to the
market, reduce welfare expenditure, and enshrine an economic doctrine
based on the survival of the fittest. There has also been a growth in
individualism, popularism and nationalism that all prioritise the self
above the other and the common good. Standards of public life have
fallen too, with leaders openly lying to their publics, thereby denying
democracy its lifeblood, the ability of electorates to make informed
choices.

Given these developments, the failure of America successfully to foster
democracy in Afghanistan may be a blessing in disguise. However, if the
reason for America's failure stems from democracy itself, and the demand
to place national self-interest above the rights of others, then that
would suggest that democracy could endanger the collective well-being of
the global community.

POLICY OUTPUTS

[Authoritarian regimes]{.underline} often are perceived---not without
justification---as **[more efficient]{.underline}** than democracies [in
generating policy outputs]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} efficacy [is
attributed to the]{.underline} **[concentration]{.underline}** [of
policy-making]{.underline} **[powers]{.underline}** [within a few key
agencies]{.underline}, [which often rely on]{.underline} [**expert
scientific** advice]{.underline}. Unlike in democracies,
[the]{.underline} policy-making [process in authoritarian regimes tends
to be more **insulated**]{.underline} [from]{.underline} those
**[societal interests]{.underline}** [that might oppose climate
policies]{.underline}. These include **[businesses]{.underline}**
[concerned about]{.underline} **[economic repercussions]{.underline}**,
[citizens apprehensive about]{.underline} **[personal
costs]{.underline}**, [and politicians]{.underline} who may resist
policies [based on **partisan** and ideological grounds]{.underline} [or
**electoral** considerations]{.underline} (Cain Reference Cain2023).
Such [resistance]{.underline} also [includes skepticism
about]{.underline} the government's [ability to effectively manage
a]{.underline} profitable energy [transition]{.underline} (Gazmararian
and Tingley Reference Gazmararian and Tingley2023). In contrast,
[democracies are criticized for]{.underline} their **[structural
inefficiencies]{.underline}** [in addressing climate]{.underline}
challenges. Critics highlight that [democratic
policy-making]{.underline} processes often [are]{.underline}
**[cumbersome]{.underline}** [and susceptible to]{.underline}
**[influence]{.underline}** [by special interests]{.underline}, which
can impede swift and effective action (Mildenberger Reference
Mildenberger2020).

#### Mobilization.

Second, [authoritarian regimes can swiftly **mobilize** people and
resources]{.underline}, [leveraging coercive capabilities to
restrict]{.underline} individual **[freedoms]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} [focus attention]{.underline},
**[efforts]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[resources]{.underline}**
on their priority issues without hindrance. Consequently,
climate-conscious [autocracies effectively]{.underline} may [curb
individual, group, and organizational carbon emissions]{.underline}.
This form of governance has been termed "**[authoritarian
environmentalism]{.underline}**" and is [characterized by authority
concentrated in]{.underline} a [few executive agencies]{.underline},
[limited public participation in policy making or
implementation]{.underline} beyond state-led mobilization, [rapid policy
outputs]{.underline}, [and **constraints** on individual
**freedom**]{.underline} (Beeson Reference Beeson2010; Gilley Reference
Gilley2012). Some scholars argue that as [current democracies struggle
to address climate]{.underline} change promptly and effectively,
**[authoritarian approaches]{.underline}** to climate governance [may
become]{.underline} more [commonplace and **necessary**]{.underline}
(Beeson Reference Beeson2010; Fiorino Reference Fiorino2018; Shearman
and Smith Reference Shearman and Smith2007). In the face of climate
change, influential scientist James Lovelock once remarked, "It may be
necessary to put democracy on hold for a while" in favor of allowing a
few uncorrupt authorities to make science-based decisions that impose
restrictions on personal freedom (Hickman Reference
Hickman2010).Footnote 5 Such an exercise of authoritarian power is
deemed legitimate in democracies during crises, serving to fulfill
citizens' essential safety needs (Barry and Smith Reference Barry,
Smith, Leighton and White2008; Mittiga Reference Mittiga2022).

[To tackle]{.underline} the [climate]{.underline} crisis, [it is
necessary for]{.underline} **[China]{.underline}**, the world's largest
emitter of greenhouse gases, [to take decisive actions]{.underline} to
cut emissions. Almost paradoxically, [China]{.underline} at the same
time **[dominates]{.underline}** the [supply chains of]{.underline}
**[technologies]{.underline}** that are [needed for]{.underline} the
world to transition to **[renewable energy]{.underline}**.

Meanwhile, [in democracies]{.underline}, the [inaction and]{.underline}
the [messy fights]{.underline} among government bodies and interest
groups have [left many]{.underline} people **[frustrated]{.underline}**
[with]{.underline} the [democratic process's ability to address
climate]{.underline} change. This and the fact that the climate fight
hinges so much on China have created a willingness by some governments
to overlook the problematic ways China approaches climate change.

# Impact\-\--Disease

## Disease Good

### 1NC\-\--War

#### Pandemics prevent conflict.

**Posen '20**. \[Barry Posen, Ford International Professor of Political
Science at MIT and Director Emeritus of the MIT Security Studies
Program. "Do Pandemics Promote Peace?". Foreign Affairs. April 23, 2020.
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2020-04-23/do-pandemics-promote-peace\]

A cursory survey of the scholarly literature on war and disease appears
to confirm Blainey's observation that pessimism is conducive to peace.
Scholars have documented again and again how war creates permissive
conditions for disease---in armies as well as civilians in the
fought-over territories. But [one **seldom** finds any discussion of
**epidemics** causing **wars** or of wars]{.underline} deliberately
started in the middle of widespread outbreaks of infectious
disease. ([The diseases that European colonists carried]{.underline} to
the New World did weaken indigenous populations to the point that they
were more vulnerable to conquest; in addition, [some **localized
conflicts** were fought during the influenza pandemic]{.underline} of
1919--21, [but these were **occasioned** by major shifts in **regional
balances** of power following the destruction of four empires in World
War I]{.underline}.)

[That sickness slows the march to war is partly due to the fact that
**war** depends on **people**]{.underline}. [When people
fall ill, they can't be counted on to **perform** well
in **combat**]{.underline}. Military medicine made enormous strides in
the years leading up to World War I, prior to which armies suffered
higher numbers of casualties from disease than from combat.
[But **pandemics** still **threaten** military units]{.underline}, as
those onboard U.S. and French aircraft carriers, hundreds of whom tested
positive for COVID-19, know well. [Sailors and **soldiers** in the field
are among the most **vulnerable** because they are packed
together]{.underline}. But even airmen are at risk, since they must take
refuge from air attacks in bunkers, where the virus could also spread
rapidly.

Ground campaigns in urban areas pose still greater dangers in pandemic
times. Much recent ground combat has been in cities in poor countries
with few or no public health resources, environments highly favorable to
illness. Ground combat also usually produces prisoners, any of whom can
be infected. A vaccine may eventually solve these problems, but an
abundance of caution is likely to persist for some time after it comes
into use.

[The most important reason **disease inhibits war** is
**economic**]{.underline}. [Major outbreaks
**damage** national **economies**, which are the **source** of
**military power**]{.underline}. COVID-19 is a pandemic---by definition
a worldwide phenomenon. [All great and middle powers appear to
be **adversely affected**]{.underline}, and all have reason to be
pessimistic about their military
prospects. [Their **economies** are shrinking fast, and there is great
**uncertainty** about when and how **quickly** they will start growing
again]{.underline}.

[Even **China**]{.underline}, which has slowed the spread of the disease
and begun to reopen its economy, [will be **hurting** for years to
come]{.underline}. [It took an enormous **hit to GDP** in the first
quarter of 2020]{.underline}, ending 40 years of steady growth. And [its
**trading partners**, burned by their dependence on China for much of
the equipment needed to fight **COVID-19**, will surely **scale back**
their imports]{.underline}. An export-dependent China will have to rely
more on its domestic market, something it has been attempting for years
with only limited success. It is little wonder, then, that the
International Monetary Fund forecasts slower growth in China this year
than at any time since the 1970s.

[Even after a **vaccine** is developed]{.underline} and made widely
available, [economic **troubles** may linger for
**years**]{.underline}. [States will emerge from this
crisis with **enormous debts**]{.underline}. They will spend years
paying for the bailout and stimulus packages they used to protect
citizens and businesses from the economic consequences of social
distancing. [Drained treasuries will give them one more reason to be
**pessimistic** about their **military might**]{.underline}.

LESS TRADE, LESS FRICTION

How long is the pacifying effect of pessimism likely to last? If a
vaccine is developed quickly, enabling a relatively swift economic
recovery, the mood may prove short-lived. But [it is equally likely that
the corona**virus** crisis will last]{.underline} long enough [to change
the world]{.underline} in important ways, [some of which will likely
**dampen** the appetite for **conflict**]{.underline} for some
time---perhaps up to five or ten years. After all, [the world is
experiencing both the biggest **pandemic** and the biggest **economic
downturn** in a century]{.underline}.

[Most governments have not covered themselves with glory managing the
**pandemic**]{.underline}, and even the most autocratic worry about
popular support. Over the next few years, people will want evidence that
their governments are working to protect them from disease and economic
dislocation. [**Citizens** will see themselves as **dependent** on the
state, and they will be **less inclined** to **support** adventures
**abroad**]{.underline}.

At the same time, [**governments** and businesses will likely try to
**reduce** their reliance on **imports** of critical
**materials**]{.underline}, having watched global supply chains break
down during the pandemic. [The result will probably be **diminished
trade**]{.underline}, something liberal internationalists see as a bad
thing. But for the last five years or so, trade has not helped improve
relations between states but rather fueled resentment. [**Less trade**
could mean **less friction** between major powers, thereby **reducing**
the intensity of their **rivalries**]{.underline}.

In the Chinese context, [**less** international **trade** could have
**positive** knock-on **effects**]{.underline}. [**Focus**ed on growing
the **domestic economy**]{.underline}, and burdened by hefty bills from
fighting the virus, [**Beijing** could be forced to table the **B**elt
and **R**oad **I**nitiative]{.underline}, an ambitious trade and
investment project that has unnerved the foreign policy establishments
of great and middle powers. [The suspension of the BRI would soothe the
fears of those who see it as an instrument of **Chinese** world
**domination**]{.underline}.

#### Absent Pandemics war is inevitable

**Walt '20** -- \[Stephen M, May 13; columnist at Foreign Policy and the
Robert and Renée Belfer professor of international relations at Harvard
University; Foreign Policy, "Will a Global Depression Trigger Another
World War?,"

But [war]{.underline} could still be **[much less likely]{.underline}**.
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Barry Posen has already
considered the likely [impact of]{.underline} the current [pandemic on
the probability of **war**]{.underline}, and he [believes]{.underline}
COVID-19 is [**more likely** to **promote peace** instead]{.underline}.
He argues that the current [pandemic is affecting all the **major powers
adversely**]{.underline}, which means it [**isn't creating** tempting
windows of opportunity for]{.underline} [unaffected states while leaving
others weaker]{.underline} [and **therefore vulnerable**]{.underline}.
Instead, it is [making]{.underline} all [governments more
**pessimistic**]{.underline} about their short- to medium-term
prospects. [Because states often go to war out of sense of
overconfidence]{.underline} (however misplaced it sometimes turns out to
be), **[pandemic-induced pessimism]{.underline}** should be [**conducive
to peace**.]{.underline}

Moreover, [by its very nature war requires states to assemble lots of
people in **close proximity**]{.underline}---at [**training camps**,
military bases, mobilization areas, ships at sea]{.underline},
etc.---and that's [**not something** you want to do in the **middle of a
pandemic**]{.underline}. For the moment at least, beleaguered
[governments]{.underline} of all types are [focusing on]{.underline}
convincing their citizens they are [doing everything]{.underline} in
their power [to **protect the public** from the disease.]{.underline}
Taken together, these considerations might explain why even an impulsive
and headstrong warmaker like Saudi Arabia's Mohammed bin Salman has
gotten more interested in winding down his brutal and unsuccessful
military campaign in Yemen.

Posen adds that COVID-19 is also likely to reduce international trade in
the short to medium term. [Those who believe **economic
interdependence** is a powerful barrier to war might be alarmed by this
development, but he points out that trade issues have been a source of
**considerable friction** in recent years]{.underline}---especially
between the United States and China---and a degree of decoupling might
[**reduce tensions** somewhat and cause the **odds of war** to
**recede**.]{.underline}

For these reasons, the [pandemic itself]{.underline} may be **[conducive
to peace]{.underline}**. But what about the relationship between broader
economic conditions and the likelihood of war? Might a few leaders still
convince themselves that provoking a crisis and going to war could still
advance either long-term national interests or their own political
fortunes? Are the other paths by which a deep and sustained economic
downturn might make serious global conflict more likely?

### EXT

#### Any 'insecurity leading to war' claim is 0\-\--pandemics divert that.

**Walt '20** -- \[Stephen M, May 13; columnist at Foreign Policy and the
Robert and Renée Belfer professor of international relations at Harvard

World War?,"
https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/05/13/coronavirus-pandemic-depression-economy-world-war/#cookie_message_anchor\]

[One familiar argument is]{.underline} the so-called [**diversionary**
(or "scapegoat") **theory of war**]{.underline}. It
[suggests]{.underline} that [leaders who are worried about
their]{.underline} popularity at [home will try to **divert attention**
from their failures by provoking a crisis with a foreign power and maybe
even using force against it.]{.underline} Drawing on this logic, some
Americans now worry that President Donald Trump will decide to attack a
country like Iran or Venezuela in the run-up to the presidential
election and especially if he thinks he's likely to lose.

This [**outcome** strikes]{.underline} me as [**unlikely**, even if one
ignores the logical and empirical flaws in the theory
itself]{.underline}. [War is]{.underline} always [a **gamble**, and
should things go badly]{.underline}---[even a little]{.underline}
bit---it would [**hammer** the **last nail** in the
coffin of **Trump's declining fortunes**]{.underline}.
[Moreover]{.underline}, [**none** of the countries]{.underline} Trump
might consider going after [pose an **imminent threat** to]{.underline}
U.S. [security]{.underline}, and [even his staunchest
supporters]{.underline} may [wonder why he is **wasting time and money**
going after Iran or Venezuela at a moment when thousands of Americans
are dying **preventable deaths** at home]{.underline}.
[Even]{.underline} a [successful military]{.underline} action [won't put
Americans back to work]{.underline}, create the sort of
testing-and-tracing regime that competent governments around the world
have been able to implement already, or hasten the development of a
vaccine. The [same logic is likely to guide the decisions of other world
leaders]{.underline} too.

Another familiar folk theory
is "**[military Keynesianism]{.underline}**." War generates a lot of
economic demand, and it can sometimes lift depressed economies out of
the doldrums and back toward prosperity and full employment. The obvious
case in point here is World War II, which did help the U.S economy
finally escape the quicksand of the Great Depression. Those who are
convinced that great powers go to war primarily to keep Big Business (or
the arms industry) happy are naturally drawn to this sort of argument,
and they might worry that governments looking at bleak economic
forecasts will try to restart their economies through some sort of
military adventure.

[I **doubt it**. It takes a **really big war **to generate a
**significant stimulus**]{.underline}, and it is [**hard to imagine**
any country launching a large-scale war]{.underline}---with all its
attendant risks---[at a moment when **debt levels** are **already
soaring**]{.underline}. More importantly, there are [lots of easier and
more direct ways to
**stimulate the economy**]{.underline}---infrastructure spending,
unemployment insurance, even "helicopter payments"---and launching a war
has to be one of the least efficient methods available. [The threat of
war usually **spooks investors** too,]{.underline} which any politician
with their eye on the stock market would be loath to do.

#### Disease [stops]{.underline} world wars. 

**Mohebbi 20** \[Payam, March 17; Professor of History at the University

Over the past centuries, [**countries** have been proud of their high
incomes and **wealth**]{.underline}, and have always sought to rule over
other countries, a move which ultimately has led to war. It has also
been considered as one of the main causes of World War I and World
War II. On the other hand, [**[epidemics]{.mark}** that had spread in
the **past**]{.underline} resulted in huge casualties due to the lack of
vaccines and antibiotics and [[acted as **controlling**]{.mark}
**[factors]{.mark}** of the world's
natural **population**]{.underline}. By taking a look at the outcome of
these events, one will find out that [[the **First World
War**]{.underline}]{.mark}, which had been waged due to the
same territorial expansions, [**[ended]{.mark}** [with
the]{.mark} outbreak of **[Spanish
flu]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [as [it inflicted **financial
burden**]{.mark} and living costs on
countries [and **made**]{.mark} political [leaders **make
peace**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is noteworthy that [rich **countries**
in the past]{.underline}, [because of their **high
income**]{.underline}, [used to turn to make **arms** and **inciting**
the world to **war**]{.underline}. Therefore, the world's leaders talked
with each other through the power of the weapon. But, at the present
time, [[when the **world** is **struggling** with]{.mark}
a global **[pandemic]{.mark}**]{.underline} (the coronavirus), [instead
of thinking about the
former ideals]{.underline}, [[all **states**]{.mark} and
**leaders**]{.underline} around the world should [[find a]{.mark} [way
to **protect** people from]{.mark} a **[hostility]{.mark}** that is not
even seen]{.underline}. This global pandemic has proven to the whole
world that the rich and the poor are all equally vulnerable to disease
and the class gap does not have anything to do with it. In fact, the
possibility for a rich country to be infected is the same as a poor
country, and the casualties will be the same at the end. It is true that
the coronavirus has resulted in many difficulties and deaths, but, by
creating the sense of sympathy and weakness, it could make
us all realize that it does not matter whether we are Iranian, American,
rich, poor, black or white, as we are vulnerable to the virus to the
same degree.

### Impact D

#### 'Extinction worry' is an impulse related fantasy

**Adalija '16** -- \[Amesh, June 17; infectious-disease physician at the
University of Pittsburgh. Writes regularly about disease; The Atlantic,
"Why Hasn\'t Disease Wiped out the Human Race?,"
https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/06/infectious-diseases-extinction/487514/\]
mahedhar

That was the question posed to me countless times at the height of the
[2014 West African Ebola outbreak]{.underline}. As an **[infectious
disease physician]{.underline}**, I was interviewed on outlets such as
CNN, NPR, and Fox News about the dangers of the virus, and the answer I
gave was always the same: "[Ebola is a deadly, scary disease, but it is
**not that contagious**. It will not find the U.S. or other
industrialized nations hospitable."]{.underline}

In other words, no, I wasn't worried---and not because I have a rosy
outlook on infectious diseases. I'm [**well-aware** of the **damage**
these diseases are causing around the world: HIV, malaria,
tuberculosis]{.underline}; the **[influenza pandemic]{.underline}** that
took the world by surprise in 2009; the anti-vaccine movement bumping
cases of measles to an all-time post-vaccine-era high;
antibiotic-resistant bacteria threatening to collapse the entire
structure of modern medicine---[all these, like Ebola, are continuously
**placing an enormous number of lives at risk**.]{.underline}

But when people ask me [if I'm worried about infectious
diseases]{.underline}, they're often not asking about the threat to
human lives; [they're asking about the **threat to human
life**]{.underline}. With each outbreak of a headline-grabbing emerging
[infectious disease comes a **fear of extinction** itself]{.underline}.
[The fear envisions]{.underline} a large proportion of humans succumbing
to infection, leaving [no survivors or so few that the species can't be
sustained.]{.underline}

I'm [**not afraid** of this **apocalyptic scenario**]{.underline}, but I
do understand the impulse. [Worry about the end is a **quintessentially
human trait.**]{.underline} [Thankfully, so is our
**resilience**]{.underline}.

For [most of **mankind's history**]{.underline}, infectious
[diseases]{.underline} were the [**existential threat**]{.underline} to
humanity---and for good reason. They were quite successful at killing
people: The **[6th century's]{.underline}** Plague of Justinian knocked
out an estimated 17 percent of the world's population; the [**14th
century** Black Death]{.underline} decimated a third of Europe; the
[**1918** influenza pandemic]{.underline} killed 5 percent of the world;
[malaria]{.underline} is estimated to have [**killed half of all
humans** who have ever lived.]{.underline}

[Any **yet**, of course, **humanity continued to
flourish**]{.underline}. Our species' recent explosion in lifespan is
almost exclusively the result of the control of infectious diseases
through sanitation, vaccination, and antimicrobial therapies. Only in
the modern era, in which many [**infectious diseases** have been **tamed
in the industrial world**]{.underline}, do people have the luxury of
death from cancer, heart disease, or stroke in the 8th decade of life.
Childhoods are free from watching siblings and friends die from
outbreaks of typhoid, scarlet fever, **[smallox]{.underline}**, measles,
and the like.

So what would it take for a disease to wipe out humanity now?

In Michael Crichton's The Andromeda Strain, the canonical book in the
disease-outbreak genre, an alien microbe threatens the human race with
extinction, and humanity's best minds are marshaled to combat the enemy
organism. [Fortunately]{.underline}, outside of fiction, [there's **no
reason** to expect alien pathogens to wage war on the human race any
time]{.underline} soon, and my analysis suggests that any [**real-life**
domestic microbe reaching an extinction level of threat]{.underline}
probably [is just as **unlikely**.]{.underline}

When humans began to focus their minds on the problems posed by
infectious disease, human life ceased being nasty, brutish, and short.

Any apocalyptic pathogen would need to possess a very special
combination of two attributes. [**First**, it would have to be **so
unfamiliar** that no existing therapy or vaccine could be **applied** to
it.]{.underline} Second, it would [need to have a **high and
surreptitious** transmissibility before symptoms occur]{.underline}. The
first is essential because any microbe from a known class of pathogens
would, by definition, have family members that could serve as models for
containment and countermeasures. The second would allow the hypothetical
disease to spread without being detected by even the most astute
clinicians.

#### Lockdowns from Diseases enable more accurate seismic monitoring key for assessing volcanic activity

**Lecocq et al. '20** (Thomas Lecocq currently works at the Seismology &
Gravimetry department (OD2) of the Royal Observatory of Belgium. Thomas
does research in Seismology, Data Mining, Computing in Mathematics,
Natural Science, Engineering and Volcanology, "Global quieting of
high-frequency seismic noise due to COVID-19 pandemic lockdown
measures", 10.1126/science.abd2438, DOA: 7/23/2025, KAoki)

In China (Fig. 3A), [the [**COVID-19 outbreak** and **subsequent
emergency measures**]{.mark}]{.underline} occurred during Chinese New
Year (CNY). In Enshi city, Hubei province, where the outbreak began
(26), hiFSAN in 2020 clearly diverges from the normal annual reduction
during CNY. The [**[hiFSAN level]{.mark}** remained at a minimum for
several weeks after CNY]{.underline}. This **[minimum [was demarcated
by]{.mark} the [start and end of quarantine]{.mark}]{.underline}** in
Hubei. While such strict quarantine measures were not enforced in
Beijing, local hiFSAN reductions are stronger and longer than recent
years. As of the end date of our analysis, Beijing has still not reached
the average hiFSAN level of previous years, suggesting the impact of
COVID-19 is still restricting anthropogenic noise there. We noticed a
later hiFSAN lockdown reduction in Apr 2020 in Heilongjiang, in NE
China, near the Russian border. [While we see seismic effects of
lockdown in areas with low population density estimates (the city center
on the uninhabited Motutapu island (Fig. 3D). The hiFSAN level at both
stations varies between weekdays and weekends before the lockdown,
suggesting that both are sensitive to anthropogenic activity. While the
island station is quieter overall, the lockdown instigated a reduction
in hiFSAN by a factor of two for both stations.]{.underline} We
attribute the remaining hiFSAN maxima on the island (mid Apr 2020; early
May 2020) to strong winds and high waves. On 27 April 2020, New Zealand
lifted restrictions, with hiFSAN increasing to the pre-lockdown levels.
The reduction of hiFSAN is weaker in less populated areas, such as at
Rundu which is located along the Namibia-Angola border (Fig. 3E). After
COVID-19 was confirmed in Namibia, an emergency was declared on 17 Mar
2020 to restrict mobility, followed by full lockdown on 27 Mar 2020.
These measures are reflected in \>25% hiFSAN reduction compared to
pre-lockdown. Despite Rundu having a population roughly eight and five
times less dense than Brussels and Auckland, respectively (28), we
observed a similarly high correlation between seismic and mobility data.
The Black Forest Observatory in Germany is an even more remote station,
located 150--170 m below the surface in crystalline bedrock. Considered
a reference low-noise laboratory (29), even there we found a small
hiFSAN reduction during lockdown nights (Fig. S6), corresponding to the
lowest hiFSAN since at least 25 Dec 2015. [We have provided a
global-scale analysis of high-frequency anthropogenic seismic
noise]{.underline}. **[[Global median]{.mark} hiFSAN [dropped by]{.mark}
as much as [50%]{.mark}]{.underline}** during March to May 2020 (Fig.
4). [The length and quiescence of this [period represents]{.mark} the
[**longest** and **most coherent** global seismic noise **reduction
in**]{.mark} **recorded [history]{.mark}**, highlighting how **human
activities impact the solid Earth**]{.underline}. A globally high
correlation exists between changes in hiFSAN and population mobility
(24), with correlations exceeding 0.9 for many categories. [This
**distinct [low-noise period]{.mark}** will help to **[optimize seismic
monitoring]{.mark}**]{.underline} (4). [[Analyzing]{.mark} the **full
spectrum of [seismogenic behavior]{.mark}**, including the **smallest
earthquakes**, is **[essential for]{.mark} monitoring [fault
dynamics]{.mark}** over seismic cycles, [and]{.mark} for **[earthquake
forecasting]{.mark}** and **seismic hazard assessment**]{.underline}.
[Small earthquakes should dominate datasets]{.underline} (30), [but
typical operational catalogues using amplitude-based detection lack many
of the swmallest earthquakes]{.underline} (31). This [**[detection issue
is]{.mark} especially [problematic in populated
areas]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} where anthropogenic [noise]{.mark} energy
**[interferes with]{.mark} earthquake [signals]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
This problem is exemplified by recordings of a M5.0 earthquake at 15 km
depth SW of Petatlan, Mexico during lockdown (Fig. S7). [An
[earthquake]{.mark}]{.underline} with this magnitude and source
mechanism [[occurring]{.mark} during daytime could typically
[only]{.mark} be [observed]{.mark} at stations in urban environments [by
**filtering the signal**]{.mark}. However, the **[reduction]{.mark} of
seismic noise [by]{.mark} ∼[40% during lockdown made]{.mark}** this
[**event visible** **without**]{.mark} **any [filtering]{.mark}
required** at a RS station]{.underline} in Querétaro city, 380 km away.
[**[Low noise levels]{.mark} during** COVID-19 **lockdowns** could thus
**[allow detection of signals]{.mark}** from new sources in areas with
**incomplete seismic catalogues**]{.underline}. Such [newly identified
signals could be used as **distinct templates**]{.underline} (30) [for
finding similar waveforms in noisier data pre- and
post-lockdown]{.underline}. This approach also [works for tremor signals
masked by anthropogenic noise, yet **[vital for monitoring potential
volcanic unrest]{.mark}**]{.underline} (6). Although broadband sensors
in rural environments are impacted less by anthropogenic noise, any
densification of and reliance on lowcost sensors in urban areas, such as
RS and low-cost accelerometers (32), will require a better understanding
of anthropogenic noise sources to suppress false detections[. As
populations increase globally, more people become exposed to potential
natural and induced geohazards]{.underline} (33). [Urbanization will
increase anthropogenic noise in exposed areas, further complicating
seismic monitoring. Characterizing and minimizing anthropogenic noise is
increasingly important for accurately detecting and imaging the seismic
signatures of potentially harmful subsurface hazards. Anthropogenic
seismic noise is thought to be dominated by noise sources less than 1 km
away]{.underline} (34,5,6,7,11). Because population mobility generates
time-varying loads that radiate energy through the shallow subsurface as
Rayleigh waves (11), local effects, such as construction sites, heavy
machinery, can impact individual stations.

[The [**massive eruption** of]{.mark} the Hunga
**[Tonga]{.mark}**--Hunga Ha'apai volcano **this January** in Tonga, in
the south Pacific Ocean, **[was]{.mark} the [volcanic equivalent
of]{.mark} a 'near miss' [asteroid whizzing by]{.mark} the
[Earth]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The **[[eruption was the
largest]{.underline}]{.mark}** since Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines
blew in 1991, [and the biggest explosion **[ever recorded]{.mark} by
instruments**]{.underline}.

[**[Ash fell]{.mark} over hundreds of kilometres**, **[affecting
infrastructure]{.mark}**, [**agriculture** and **fish**]{.mark}
**stocks**]{.underline}. The damage caused amounted to 18.5% of Tonga's
gross domestic product. [**Submarine [cables were severed]{.mark}**,
cutting off]{.underline} Tonga's [communications]{.underline} with the
outside world [for several days]{.underline}; farther afield, the
[[blast created]{.mark} a [**worldwide shockwave** and **tsunamis** that
reached Japanese and]{.mark} North and South [American
coastlines]{.mark}]{.underline}. Mercifully, the [eruption lasted only
about 11 hours]{.underline}. [Had it gone on for longer, **released more
ash and gas** or occurred in more densely populated areas of southeast
Asia, or near a high concentration of vital **[shipping lanes]{.mark}**,
**electricity [grids]{.mark}** []{.mark}or other crucial global
infrastructure, it would [have]{.mark} had [repercussions for **supply
chains**, **climate** and **food**]{.mark} resources
worldwide1.]{.underline}

The world is woefully unprepared for such an event. [[The Tongan
eruption should be a **wake-up call**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Recent data
from ice cores suggest that the probability of an eruption with a
magnitude of 7 (10 or 100 times larger than Tonga) or greater this
century is 1 in 62. [[Eruptions]{.mark} of [this size]{.mark}
have]{.underline}, in the past, [[caused]{.mark} abrupt [**climate
change** and]{.mark} the **[collapse of
civilizations]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and have been [associated with the
rise of **[pandemics3]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

And yet, [little investment has gone into limiting what an eruption of
this magnitude could do]{.underline}. [[Impacts]{.underline}]{.mark}
would [[cascade across]{.mark} **transport**, **food**, **water**,
**trade**, **energy**, **finance**, and **communication** in
[our]{.mark} globally connected [world]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Over the next century, **[[large-scale volcanic eruptions are hundreds
of times more likely to occur than]{.mark} are [asteroid]{.mark} and
comet [impacts]{.mark}]{.underline}**, put together4. The climatic
impact of these events is comparable, [yet the **response is vastly
different**]{.underline}. '[Planetary defence' receives hundreds of
millions of dollars in funding each year]{.underline}, and has several
global agencies devoted to it. In September, NASA's Double Asteroid
Redirection Test (DART) mission will try to nudge an asteroid's
trajectory, testing capabilities for future asteroid deflection. That
advance-preparation project will cost over US\$300 million. [By
contrast, **[there is no coordinated action, nor large-scale investment,
to mitigate]{.mark} the global [effects]{.mark} of large-magnitude
eruptions**. [This needs to change]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### 2NC\-\--Volcano

#### 1. [PYROCLASTIC FLOWS]{.underline}.

**Bindeman '06** (Ilya N. Bindeman, Academic expert in Earth Sciences,

tiny crystals and their isotopic signatures have also revealed
surprises--- good and bad---about the **[[aftermath of
supereruptions]{.underline}]{.mark}**. One of the best-studied examples
of supervolcano aftermath [[is]{.mark} the **[Bishop
tuff]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a [volcanic layer **tens to hundreds of
meters thick** that is exposed at the earth's surface]{.underline} as
the Volcanic Tablelands in eastern California. This [massive deposit
represents]{.underline} what is left of the estimated **[[750 cubic
kilometers of magma ejected]{.underline}]{.mark}** during the formation
of the Long Valley supervolcano caldera some 760,000 years ago. For
decades, many geologists assumed that a series of distinct eruptions
over millions of years must have occurred to produce the extensive
Bishop tuff. But careful studies of microscopic, magma-filled bubbles
trapped inside tiny crystals of quartz tell a different story. [The
**rate at which magma leaves a chamber depends primarily on two factors:
the magma's viscosity, or ability to flow, and the pressure difference
between the chamber and the earth's surface**]{.underline}. Because the
[pressure inside a bubble matches that of the chamber where the magma
formed]{.underline}, the bubble acts like a mini version of the chamber
itself. Aware of this correspondence, Alfred Anderson of the University
of Chicago and his colleagues studied the size of the bubbles under a
microscope to estimate how long it took the magma to leak out. [Based on
these and other experiments and field]{.underline} observations from the
1990s, geologists now think that the **[Bishop tuff]{.underline}**---and
probably most other supererupted debris---was **[[expelled in a single
event lasting]{.mark} a mere [10 to 100 hours]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Since that discovery, [investigators have had to modify their
reconstructions of supervolcano eruptions]{.underline}. Here is what
they now generally expect from an event the scale of those that struck
Long Valley and Yellowstone: [[Instead of a **slow leak of**
]{.mark}**red-hot [lava]{.mark}** as is seen creeping down]{.underline}
the sides of Kilauea Volcano in Hawaii, these [[eruptions feature
**supersonic blasts of**]{.mark} **superheated**, **foamlike gas** and
**[ash]{.mark}** that rise buoyantly all the way into the earth's
stratosphere, **[50 kilometers high]{.mark}**. As the land above the
magma chamber collapses, **immense gray clouds called [pyroclastic
flows]{.mark} burst out horizontally all around the caldera**. These
flows are an intermediate stage between lava and ash, so they move
extremely rapidly---**[up to 400 kilometers an hour]{.mark}**, some
sources say; **[cars and even]{.mark} small [airplanes]{.mark} would
[have no chance]{.mark} of [outrunning them]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
These [flows are also intensely hot---600 to 700 degrees Celsius---so
[they **burn**]{.mark} **and bury [everything]{.mark} for tens of
kilometers [in every direction]{.mark}**]{.underline}**.**

#### 2. [ASH]{.underline}.

**Bindeman '06** (Ilya N. Bindeman, Academic expert in Earth Sciences,

As bad as the pyroclastic flows are, [the **[ash injected in]{.mark}to
the [atmosphere]{.mark}** can [have]{.mark} even more **[far-reaching
consequences]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For [[**hundreds of kilometers**
around]{.mark} the **eruption and for perhaps days or weeks, [pale-gray
ash]{.mark} would [fall]{.mark} like clumps of snow**.]{.underline}
Within [**200 kilometers** of the caldera, **[most sunlight]{.mark}
would be [blocked out]{.mark}**]{.underline}, so the sky at noon would
look like that at dusk. **[Homes, [people]{.mark} and animals would be
buried, sometimes [crushed]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Even [**300
kilometers away**, the **[ash]{.mark} could [be half]{.mark} a [meter
thick]{.mark}; mixed with rain**, the weight would be plenty
**sufficient to collapse roofs**. **Less ash than that would [knock
out]{.mark} electrical [power and relay stations]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[As **[little as a millimeter]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which could well
dust the ground halfway around the globe, [would **[shut down airports
and]{.mark} dramatically [reduce ag]{.mark}ricultural
[production]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Only gradually would
**[rain (made acidic by]{.mark} volcanic [gases]{.mark}**) **[wash
away]{.mark} the thick blanket of [ash]{.mark}**. And because volcanic
rock and ash float, it **would [clog major waterways.
Transportation]{.mark} along big rivers could [grind to a
halt]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Indeed, recent oil drilling in the Gulf of
Mexico struck a surprisingly thick layer of supervolcanic debris near
the Mississippi Delta---more than 1,000 miles from its source in
Yellowstone. Only by floating downriver and then sticking to sediment
that sank to the ocean bottom could that amount of debris have
accumulated from a volcano so far away.

#### 3. [OZONE DESTRUCTION]{.underline}.

**Bindeman '06** (Ilya N. Bindeman, Academic expert in Earth Sciences,

https://pages.uoregon.edu/bindeman/SciAmSuper-web.pdf, DOA: 7/23/2025,

We began our analyses with a focus on a particularly efficient oxidant,
ozone. **[[Ozone]{.underline}]{.mark}** is a gas molecule made up of
three oxygen atoms [best [known for **shielding**]{.mark} **the
[earth]{.mark}** [from]{.mark} the **sun's dangerous** **[ultraviolet
rays]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Because of rare chemical transformations
that certain gases undergo in the presence of that intense solar
radiation, ozone is characterized by an anomaly in its so-called
mass-independent oxygen isotope signature, which in simple terms can be
thought of as an excess of oxygen 17. [When ozone or any other
oxygenrich molecule in the stratosphere interacts with SO2, it transfers
its oxygen isotope signature to the resulting acid]{.underline}---that
is, the oxygen 17 anomaly persists in the new acid. In 2003 geochemists
at the University of California, San Diego, found the first evidence
that this signature is also preserved in the oxygen atoms of the acid
that later falls as rain and in the sulfate compounds that form as the
acid rain reacts with ash on the ground. The oxygen 17 excess and other
chemical patterns that we found in sulfate from the Yellowstone and Long
Valley ash samples thus implied that significant amounts of
stratospheric ozone were used up in reactions with gas from the
supereruptions in those regions. Other researchers studying the acid
layers in Antarctica have demonstrated that those events, too, probably
eroded stratospheric ozone. It begins to [look as if
**[supervolcano]{.mark} emissions [eat holes in]{.mark} the [ozone
layer]{.mark}** for an even longer period than they take to cool the
climate]{.underline}. [**[This loss]{.mark} of protective ozone** would
be expected to **[result in]{.mark} an [increased]{.mark} amount of
dangerous [ultraviolet radiation]{.mark} reaching the earth's surface
and thus in a [rise in genetic damage]{.mark} caused by
rays**]{.underline}. The magnitude and length of the potential ozone
destruction are still being debated. [Space [observations]{.mark} have
[revealed]{.mark} a [**3 to 8 percent** depletion]{.mark} of the ozone
layer **[following]{.mark} the 1991 eruption of Mount
[Pinatubo]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the Philippines. But [**[what would
happen after]{.mark} an [event]{.mark} [100 times larger?]{.mark}**
Simple arithmetic does not solve the problem, because the details of
atmospheric oxidation reactions are extremely complex and not fully
understood.]{.underline}

### AT: Defense

#### Risk for Volcano Eruptions are extremely high, it's a question of whether we can accurately predict them

DOA: 7/25/2025, KAoki)

Experts Say That [the **[Risk of]{.mark} a [Catastrophic
Eruption]{.mark}** [Is]{.mark} "**[A Roll of the
Dice]{.mark}**"]{.underline} [According to experts from]{.underline} the
University of Birmingham and the Centre for the Study of Existential
Risk (**[CSER]{.underline}**) at the University of Cambridge, [[the
world is "**woefully underprepared**]{.mark}" **for a catastrophic
volcanic eruption**]{.underline} and [its [expected effects on **global
supply networks**, the **climate**, and **food**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
They claim that [there is a "**broad misconception" that** the
**likelihood of massive eruptions is low and call the government's
current lack of investment** in monitoring and mitigating possible
volcanic catastrophes "reckless"]{.underline} in an article that was
recently published in the journal Nature. However, the [researchers
contend that protective measures against volcanic destruction can be
adopted, including better monitoring]{.underline}, enhanced public
education, and magma manipulation, and the resources required to do so
are long overdue. The Likelihood of a Massive Eruption "[**[Data
gathered from ice cores]{.mark}** on the frequency of eruptions
**[over]{.mark} deep [time suggests there is a one-in-six chance]{.mark}
of a magnitude seven explosion** in the next one hundred years. **That's
a roll of the dice**,]{.underline}" said article co-author and CSER
researcher Dr. Lara Mani, an expert in global risk." [[Such]{.mark}
gigantic [eruptions]{.mark} have **[caused]{.mark} abrupt [climate
change]{.mark}** [and **collapse of civilizations**]{.mark} in the
distant past.]{.underline}" Mani likens [the **[threat of]{.mark} a
[massive eruption to that of]{.mark} a
[1-k]{.mark}ilo[m]{.mark}eter-[wide]{.mark} [asteroid]{.mark} hitting
Earth**]{.underline}. Similar climatic consequences would result from
such disasters, but [**[the probability]{.mark}** of a volcanic
catastrophe **[is hundreds of times greater]{.mark}** than the
probability of an asteroid or comet collision]{.underline}. "Hundreds of
millions of dollars are pumped into asteroid threats every year, yet
there is a severe lack of global financing and coordination for volcano
preparedness," Mani said. "This urgently needs to change. We are
completely underestimating the risk to our societies that volcanoes
pose." The largest instrumentally recorded eruption ever occurred in
Tonga in January. According to the experts, if the eruption had lasted
longer, emitted more ash and gas, or happened in a location with
essential infrastructure, such as the Mediterranean, global shock waves
could have been catastrophic. "The Tonga eruption was the volcanic
equivalent of an asteroid just missing the Earth, and needs to be
treated as a wake-up call," said Mani. Eruption Frequency and Historical
Impact The CSER experts cite recent research detecting the regularity of
major eruptions by analyzing traces of sulfur spikes in ancient ice
samples. An eruption ten to a hundred times larger than the Tonga blast
occurs once every 625 years -- twice as often as had been previously
thought. "[The **[last magnitude seven eruption]{.mark} was in 1815** in
Indonesia]{.underline}," said co-author Dr. Mike Cassidy, a volcano
expert and visiting CSER researcher, now based at the University of
Birmingham. "[An **estimated 100,000 people died locally**, and **global
temperatures dropped** by a degree on average, [caus]{.mark}ing **mass
[crop failures]{.mark}** that led to **[famine]{.mark}**, **[violent
uprisings]{.mark}**, and **[epidemics]{.mark}** in what was known as the
year without summer]{.underline}," he said. "[We now live in a world
with **eight times the population** and **over forty times the level of
trade**. [Our **complex global networks**]{.mark} could [make us]{.mark}
even [**more vulnerable** to]{.mark} the shocks of a **[major
eruption]{.mark}**]{.underline}." [Financial losses from a large
magnitude eruption would be in the multi-trillions, and on a comparable
scale to the pandemic]{.underline}, say the experts. Steps to Improve
Volcano Preparedness Mani and Cassidy outline steps they say [[need
to]{.mark} be taken to [**help forecast** and **manage**]{.mark} the
**[possibility of]{.mark} a planet-altering [eruption]{.mark}** and
**help [mitigate damage]{.mark} from smaller, more frequent eruptions**.
These **[include a more accurate pinpointing of
risks]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We only know the locations of a handful of
the 97 eruptions classed as large magnitude on the "Volcano Explosivity
Index" over the last 60,000 years. This means there could be dozens of
dangerous volcanoes dotted the world over with the potential for extreme
destruction, about which humanity has no clue. "We may not know about
even relatively recent eruptions due to a lack of research into marine
and lake cores, particularly in neglected regions such as Southeast
Asia," said Cassidy. "Volcanoes can lie dormant for a long time, but
still be capable of sudden and extraordinary destruction." [Monitoring
must be improved]{.underline}, say the CSER experts. Only 27% of
eruptions since 1950 have had a seismometer anywhere near them, and only
a third of that data again has been fed into the global database for
"volcanic unrest". "Volcanologists have been calling for a dedicated
volcano-monitoring satellite for over twenty years," said Mani.
"Sometimes we have to rely on the generosity of private satellite
companies for rapid imagery." The experts also call for increased
research into volcano "geoengineering". This includes the need to study
means of countering aerosols released by a massive eruption, which could
lead to a "volcanic winter". They also say that work to investigate
manipulating pockets of magma beneath active volcanoes should be
undertaken. Added Mani: "Directly affecting volcanic behavior may seem
inconceivable, but so did the deflection of asteroids until the
formation of the NASA Planetary Defense Coordination Office in 2016. The
risks of a massive eruption that devastates global society are
significant. The current underinvestment in responding to this risk is
simply reckless."

therefore vast and **[cascading agricultural]{.mark}**,
**[ecological]{.mark}**, **[environmental]{.mark}**, and other
[implications]{.mark}]{.underline} (Robock 2000). Furthermore,
[associated cooling of the oceans can lead to the **weakening of ocean
circulation** and **[produce]{.mark} further [weather
anomalies]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Rampino 2008). The [[resulting
disruption]{.mark} to agriculture, crop yields and global food
production will be quite sudden, and is therefore considered to be the
most consequential effect of large volcanic eruptions]{.underline}.
Severe agricultural impacts were shown to have followed the 1815 Tambora
eruption. The evidence suggests that the [climatic effects of a
temperature drop and decreased precipitation in monsoon regions led to
agricultural productivity decline and crop failures on multiple
continents]{.underline} (Raible et al. 2016; Brönnimann and Krämer 2016;
Oppenheimer 2003). [**This resulted in an [increase]{.mark} in [food
prices]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} in combination with [**political turmoil**
led to **famine**]{.mark} and [**food scarcity** along with]{.mark}
**epidemic [disease]{.mark}** spread in Europe, the US and
China]{.underline} (Brönnimann and Krämer 2016; Oppenheimer 2003). Some
observers suggest that the famine crisis led to modernizations of the
agricultural sector that consequently increased long-term agricultural
productivity (Brönnimann and Krämer 2016). The same observers suggest
that, in China, these effects may have also led to a shift from
subsistence crops to opium poppy farming because of its higher tolerance
for dryer conditions and its higher cash value (Brönnimann and Krämer
2016). Others suggest that the disruptions caused by the Tambora
eruption possibly contributed to societal and economic changes
characterized by social unrest, the Cholera pandemic, and the economic
crisis in the US, and finally led to the emergence of the early welfare
state (Wood 2014). In contrast, other researchers propose that the
social and economic upheavals caused a political shift to the right
instead (e.g., Post 1977). Nevertheless, these conflicting accounts
suggest that the eruption was not the primary driver, but a contributing
factor to social change. For the 1257 Rinjani eruption, the evidence is
obviously more tentative. Some, however, do suggest that the eruption's
climatic effects and the associated agricultural decline contributed to
famine and high mortality in England and Japan and to disease spread in
Europe and the Middle East (Stothers 2000; Guilett et  al. 2017;
Campbell 2017). Furthermore, it has been argued that this event may have
contributed to the decline of the Mongol and Byzantine empires
(Oppenheimer 2011; and Xoplaki et al. 2016; respectively). Today, in
contrast with the 19th or thirteenth centuries, society is more exposed
to a major eruption since the world is more densely populated. We are
also more vulnerable because we increasingly rely more on technology,
and because of the interconnectedness of the global economy (Newhall
et al. 2018). [A **[super-volcanic eruption]{.mark}** would likely
**[cause global food supply disruptions]{.mark} due to a loss** of one
or more growing seasons]{.underline} (Puma et al. 2015; Toon et al.
1997). [Such a decline in food production could easily surpass the
amount of stored food worldwide and lead to large-scale famine, unlike
local food system shortages due to a hazard event, that could almost
always be mitigated by imports from elsewhere, when such trade is
permitted.]{.underline}5 Rampino (2002) notes that the Asian rice crop
could be destroyed by a single night of freezing temperatures during the
growing season and a 3--4  °C temperature drop would destroy the
Canadian grain production. A similar destruction can also be wrought on
coldsensitive tropical vegetation (Williams 2012). In any case, the
overall effect on plant life would definitely create a major ecological
and environmental crisis (Self 2015). [Besides famines, these
**[dynamics]{.mark} can [also lead to]{.mark} the spread of specific
infectious [diseases]{.mark}**[, **social unrest**, and **violent
conflict over resources**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Rampino 2008; Stothers
2000). The [[deposited ash layer]{.mark}, potentially covering a
continent-sized landmass, would also [**negatively affect**
**infrastructure**, **transportation**, **electricity transmission**,
and]{.mark} leave large areas with **[contaminated water]{.mark}
sources**]{.underline} (Donovan and Oppenheimer 2014; Self 2015).
[Atmospheric [ash would severely **disrupt aviation**, **GPS systems**
and]{.mark} other **[satellite]{.mark} service[s]{.mark} and
telecommunication**]{.underline} (Newhall et  al. 2018; Self 2015).
Furthermore, the disruptions to telecommunications and aviation would
hinder the emergency response (Rymer et al. 2005).

### Seismic Sensing fails

#### Seismic sensing is cooked

**Cassidy '24** -- \[John, Taimi Mulder, January 10; Conceptualization
and writing focusing on ecological studies; Canadian Science Publishing,
"Seismicity and seismic monitoring of Canada's volcanic zones,"
https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/cjes-2023-0078\]mahedhar

[There are **difficulties** with **seismic volcanic
monitoring**]{.underline}. Earthquake detection is [dependent on
**instrumentation**, distribution of seismic **stations**, and
**proximity** to source]{.underline}. The early instrumentation commonly
had free periods of ∼15--20 s, which is good for detecting large distant
earthquakes but is [**very poor** at **picking up** the high frequency
signals of small, local]{.underline} (nearby) [earthquakes.]{.underline}

The seismic network in Canada was primarily designed to, first, detect
distant earthquakes and nuclear explosions and, second, in later years
(after the 1946 earthquake in Courtenay, BC, M7.3), to provide a
backbone network so that earthquakes in Canada greater than magnitude
three could be located throughout the country. Station density was
increased to lower the detection threshold in areas of greater risk
(more earthquakes and more population[). This provides **minimal
monitoring capability** of volcanic activity in any of the volcanic
regions; however, it **does not support** detailed study of volcanic
activity **at any** of the **recently active volcanoes**]{.underline}
(those less than 10 000 years old) [or provide **reliable depth
estimates** of **seismicity** at these volcanoes.]{.underline}

There are also [**many practical challenges** to monitoring seismicity
in volcanic zones]{.underline}. In Canada, these [**areas are remote**
with steep terrain and **complicated areas** to work in]{.underline}.
They are **[high-noise environments]{.underline}**, often wi[th **thick
layers** of tephra and other loose material that contribute to high
levels of seismic "**noise**]{.underline}". In addition, volcanic belts
in Canada commonly have both hot springs and glaciers that often have
microseismicity associated with the circulation of fluids (and not
related to magma), as documented by Rogers (1976).

A [volcano typically]{.underline} has one or more [magma
conduits]{.underline} from the mantle [to a magma storage chamber at
shallower depth]{.underline} (possibly topping out around 10 km depth)
and another one or more feeding conduits to the summit crater or a flank
cone (Zobin 2003). There are [**several different types** of seismicity
associated with volcanoes]{.underline} (e.g., Matoza and Roman 2022).
Generally volcanic earthquakes can be classified into four types
(Minakami 1960, 1974). [There are volcano-tectonic (VT) earthquakes,
which are those **generated by stresses** that arise during **magma
migration**]{.underline}, caused by shear or tensile failure through
conduits, dikes, and sills, producing rupture at the tip of the magma
body and within [adjacent fault systems]{.underline}. These are
high-frequency "tectonic-looking" events with sharp P- and S-wave
arrivals. Distal VT events are often observed; these are events that are
distant (e.g., 10--20 km) from a volcanic vent. VT earthquakes are
further classified into A and B types. A-type volcanic earthquakes
generally occur at depth of 1--20 km and take place before and during
eruptive activity. [They **cannot be distinguished** from those of
general (tectonic) earthquakes]{.underline}. B-type volcanic earthquakes
are generally limited to within a kilometer radius of an active crater,
are very small magnitude, and occur in swarms[. This type of earthquake
is **very important** for the forecasting of volcanic
eruptions]{.underline}. There are explosion earthquakes that accompany
individual explosive eruptions. Another common seismic signal associated
with volcanic activity is volcanic tremors. These are lower frequency
signals that lack clear P and S waves, have an emergent onset, and long
duration (e.g., minutes to hours). [These types of events are considered
to be **directly or indirectly** generated by magmatic activity within
the volcanic conduit,]{.underline} volcanic explosions, or associated
with lava dome growth and the migration of volcanic fluids underground
(Zobin 2003).

In Canada, at the present time, we are primarily concerned with VT
earthquakes, although there are a handful of sites that have the
potential to support the study of volcanic eruptions. [**All types** of
volcanic earthquakes **require a tight control** on earthquake location
and depth within the vicinity of the volcano]{.underline}, as well as a
history (a decade or more) of [**tightly controlled** event locations to
provide a background of activity on which to **observe
changes**]{.underline}. At a minimum, it requires one seismic station
within ∼10 km of the volcano to provide some level of depth control. To
provide tightly controlled event locations and depth, an array of a
minimum of five seismometers within a 20 km radius of the volcano would
be required. [**At the present**, **neither** of these situations
**exist** at any recent volcanic edifice]{.underline} in Canada, so
[**only general observations** can be made in each of the defined
volcanic regions]{.underline}.

#### No internal\-\--Alt causes mean disease won't solve seismic capabilities

**Smith et al '24** -- \[James, August 7; Researcher specialized in
seismic activity; National Park Service, "Monitoring Volcanoes,"
https://www.nps.gov/articles/volcano-monitoring.htm\]mahedhar

[**Movement** of magma and associated fluids within
**volcanoes**]{.underline} often [occurs with
**concurrent**]{.underline}, measurable **[earthquake
activity]{.underline}** ([seismicity]{.underline}). [At]{.underline}
restless [volcanoes]{.underline}, evolving [seismic
activity]{.underline} commonly, but not always, [precedes
eruptions]{.underline}. The most common [**seismic disturbances** are
earthquakes]{.underline} in response to stress changes [caused by
**magma movement** beneath a volcano]{.underline}.

[When]{.underline} magma rapidly [intrudes]{.underline} into surrounding
rock, the [rock breaks abruptly]{.underline}, [causing an]{.underline}
earthquake whose signal is similar to that of an earthquake along a
tectonic fault (Fig. 6A). This type of earthquake is called a
**[volcano-tectonic]{.underline}** (VT) earthquake. VT earthquake
[signatures are characterized]{.underline} by clear and often
[**impulsive**, or **abrupt**, wave onsets and contain energy across a
**broad range** of seismic frequencies.]{.underline}

### No Supervolcano impact

#### No terminal to eruptions\-\--empirics

**Cox '17** -- \[David, July 24; Freelance health journalist; BBC,
"Would a supervolcano eruption wipe us out?,"
https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20170724-would-a-supervolcano-eruption-wipe-us-out\]mahedhar

\"Over the last 10 or so years, [people have become **more sceptical**
that Toba almost killed off Homo sapiens]{.underline},\" Oppenheimer
says. \"[**Magmas can dissolve** and hold things like carbon dioxide and
water and sulphur in **different amounts**]{.underline}, depending on
the volcano. And **[chemical analysis]{.underline}** of ash from Toba
has [found that]{.underline} its **[magma can\'t actually
hold]{.underline}** very [much sulphur]{.underline}.\"

There is also [something **suspicious** in the **archaeological
record**]{.underline}. Indonesia, Malaysia and India are thought to have
been blanketed in at least 5cm of ash from Toba, which undoubtedly
affected vegetation and caused mass floods. Yet [archaeological
**studies** of ash deposits appear to show that humans were **remarkably
resilient**]{.underline} to the environmental changes.

\"The [**main signs** of human activity]{.underline} around this time
are stone tools of the Middle Palaeolithic period, such as points and
scrapers,\" says Jones, who has excavated sites in the Jurreru Valley in
Andhra Pradesh, India. \"[When we excavated deposits above, through and
below the Toba ash layer, we **didn\'t** really see **much change** at
all]{.underline} in these Stone Age technologies before and after the
eruption, which suggests that [it **didn\'t really cause** any **mass
extinction**]{.underline}.\"

The key factor may be that [most of the ash]{.underline} from Toba is
believed to have [fallen in the **ocean**]{.underline}, where it would
have had only [**minimal effects** on land-dwelling species like
humans]{.underline}. However, Jones believes that the impact was still
extremely severe for some communities.

"[Toba was an **incredibly large eruption**]{.underline}, so it would
have devastated certain areas, particularly in the immediate vicinity in
Sumatra and elsewhere in Southeast Asia," she says. "[Yet in areas like
India]{.underline}, which is further afield but was still blanketed in
ash-fall, [people were inhabiting a **diverse range** of **habitats**
and **microclimates**, in forests, desert fringes, plains and hill
ranges]{.underline}. This means that populations would have coped
differently following Toba's aftermath, suffering in some areas more
than others.\"

#### [No]{.underline} impact\-\--[new NASA]{.underline} research [proves]{.underline}.

**Kaufman '24** -- \[Mark, March 23; Science editor at Mashable
reporting seeing the extraordinary value in educating people about the
happenings on Earth; Mashable, "Scientists find clear proof that a
supervolcano won\'t wipe humans out,"
https://mashable.com/article/supervolcano-human-survival\]mahedhar

Thankfully, it\'s [**rare** for **supervolcanoes to erupt**]{.underline}
--- the [last one exploded 26,500 years ago.]{.underline}

Yet [**even when** such a]{.underline} potent geologic [event happens
again (there\'s **no sign** of any supervolcanoes]{.underline} like
Yellowstone stirring, and we\'d have at least many years of volcanic
notice), [different lines of **evidence** suggest global **catastrophe
wouldn\'t ensue**. Humanity **wouldn\'t be imperiled**]{.underline},
though you\'d certainly want to avoid being anywhere near the blast.

[**Recent NASA research** concluded that a
**super-eruption**]{.underline}, which erupts over 240 cubic miles
(1,000 cubic kilometers) of magma and injects sun-blocking gases into
the atmosphere, [would have a **temporary**]{.underline} and moderate
cooling [effect on Earth]{.underline} --- [**not a deep**, cold
**volcanic winter** that would devastate the global food
chain]{.underline}. And now, a [new study shows that after]{.underline}
an especially [powerful supervolcano eruption]{.underline} some 74,000
years ago (the largest in the last 2 million years), foraging
[**humans** in modern-day]{.underline} Ethiopia
[**survived**.]{.underline}

Scientists discover unknown prehistoric world --- on Earth

A group of scientists ventured to a pre-historic site along Ethiopia\'s
Shinfa River, a place teeming with ancient arrowheads, mammal bones,
fish remains, and evidence of past fires. Crucially, tiny shards of
volcanic glass are sprinkled around the site, which chemically-match
output from the Toba volcano, which erupted in modern-day Sumatra,
Indonesia, 74,000 years ago.

The **[mighty eruption]{.underline}**, thousands of miles away, did
appear to alter the environment in this region of Africa, as the site
(called Shinfa-Metema 1), shows [evidence]{.underline} of prolonged dry
seasons [after the volcanic blast.]{.underline} But as water holes dried
up, [early **humans adapted**]{.underline}. The [researchers argue that
these people]{.underline} didn\'t simply survive, but their need to
[**seek out new water** for hunting and fishing
opportunities]{.underline} could have [**helped propel** one of the
human movements, or dispersals]{.underline}, out of Africa.

\"[As **people depleted food**]{.underline} in and around a given dry
season waterhole, they were likely [**forced to move** to new
waterholes]{.underline},\" John Kappelman, an anthropologist and earth
scientist at The University of Texas at Austin who led the research,
said in a statement. \"[Seasonal rivers]{.underline} thus functioned as
\'pumps\' that siphoned populations out along the channels from one
waterhole to another, [potentially **driving the most
recent**]{.underline} out-of-Africa [dispersal]{.underline}.\"

The research was published in the science journal Nature.

Some 74,000 years ago, these [people were **able to adapt** to fish when
necessary]{.underline}, or use expertly carved projectile points to hunt
antelope and other critters with bows and arrows. [**Post-eruption**,
the **natural environment** certainly]{.underline} posed challenges, but
**[didn\'t nearly collapse.]{.underline}**

evidence that even [**worse pandemics** could strike us in the **near
future** and **threaten the existence** of the human race]{.underline}?
[The answer is **unequivocally yes**]{.underline}. It is [not necessary
to get infected by viruses found in]{.underline} bats, pangolins, and
other **[exotic animals]{.underline}** that live in remote forests to be
in danger. [**Creditable scientific evidence** indicates
that]{.underline} the [**human gut microbiota** harbor **billions of
viruses**]{.underline} that are [capable of affecting the function of
**vital human organs**]{.underline} such as [the immune system, lung,
brain, liver, kidney, or heart]{.underline}. It is remotely possible
that the [**development** of pathogenic variants in the gut can **lead
to contagious viruses**]{.underline}, which can [**cause pandemics**,
leading to the **destruction of vital**]{.underline} organs, causing
death or various debilitating diseases such as blindness, respiratory,
liver, heart, and kidney failures. These [diseases]{.underline} could
[result in the **complete shutdown** of our **civilization**
and]{.underline} probably the gradual **[extinction of the human
race]{.underline}**. This essay will comment on a few independent pieces
of scientific facts, and then combine this information to come up with
some (but certainly **[not]{.underline}** all) [**hypothetical**
scenarios]{.underline} that could cause [**human race misery**, even
extinction,]{.underline} in the hope that these hypothetical scenarios
will trigger [preventative measures]{.underline} that [could reverse or
delay the projected **adverse outcomes**.]{.underline}

#### Pandemics cause [threatens]{.underline} the [collapse]{.underline} of [civilizations]{.underline}. The risk is [higher]{.underline} than [ever]{.underline} right now due to increased population density and antibiotic resistance.

Pandemics should instead be understood as falling between a natural and
an anthropogenic risk. Non-engineered pathogens that emerge from nature
do not represent the same type of direct natural risk as an event such
as an asteroid strike. [Understanding a [pandemic]{.mark} in terms of a
**global catastrophic risk** is]{.underline} more
[practical]{.underline}, [meaning that it could [threaten
**permanent**]{.mark} **civilizational [collapse]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Bostrom and Ćirković 2011). The John Hopkins Center for Health Security
has followed this idea in defining [pandemics]{.underline} as possible
"Global Catastrophic Biological Risks" (GCBRs). Which they define as
biological events---deliberate, accidental, or emerging---that [could
lead to sudden]{.underline}, [extraordinary]{.underline}, [**widespread
disaster** beyond the **collective capability** of]{.underline} national
and international [governments and the private sector to
control]{.underline} \[[that]{.underline}\] [if unchecked]{.underline}
\[...\] [would [lead to]{.mark} **great
[suffering]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[loss of life]{.underline}**,
[[and]{.mark} **sustained [damage]{.mark}** to national
governments]{.underline}, [international relationships]{.underline},
economies, **[societal stability]{.underline}**, [or **[global
security]{.mark}**]{.underline}. (Schoch-Spana et al. 2017, 323) [Though
humanity has lived with diseases]{.underline} since its earliest
history, [the **contemporary [possibility]{.mark}** of such a risk has
**[increased]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The global [[pop]{.mark}ulation
recently [climbed to]{.mark} over **[8 billion]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[and the overall **[population density]{.mark}** continues to
**[increase]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Roser et al. 2013). [With more
individuals]{.underline}, [there are **more possible origins** of new
pandemic diseases]{.underline}. As of 2018, [55% of the world's
population lived in urban areas]{.underline} (UN DESA 2018), and an
estimated 65% by 2050 (UN DESA 2019). [People living closer to one
another will likely **increase** the **transmission
rates**]{.underline}. [Many facets of **[modern life]{.mark}** further
**[increase]{.mark}** a pandemic's **possible
[severity]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[scope]{.underline}**, [and
**scale**]{.underline} (Jones et al. 2008; Morse 1995).
[[Deforestation]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[industrial]{.mark}
[farming]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} meat production practices
combined with **[climate]{.mark} change** [increase]{.mark} the
likelihood of **[zoonotic]{.mark} [transmission]{.mark}** of pathogens
from animals to humans]{.underline}. The **[[melting
permafrost]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [increased **u**ltra**v**iolet
**immunosuppression**]{.underline}, [changing **weather
patterns**]{.underline}, [and **arctic thawing**]{.underline} that comes
with global warming [may **[unleash pathogens]{.mark}** frozen long
ago]{.underline} (Hofmeister et al. 2021). [Alternatively]{.underline},
[trigger **pathogenic mutations** in previously non-pathogenic
organisms]{.underline}. [The **ease** of **global transportation** also
**dramatically increases** the risk of future pandemics]{.underline}
(Ord 2020). In addition to these variables, war is a significant factor
that results in the spread of pandemic disease, both unintentionally as
troops move into foreign lands and intentionally and potentially when
used as a weapon (A. T. Price-Smith 2009). Another often singled but
under-recognized future pandemic risk is so-called super bugs,
antimicrobial resistant bacteria. Superbugs fall into three categories
defined by their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.
Multidrug-resistant pathogens are not susceptible to at least one agent
in three or more categories, extensively drug-resistant are not
susceptible to at least one agent in all but two or fewer categories,
and the most concerning the pandrug-resistant which have no known
susceptibility to any antimicrobial agents (Magiorakos et al. 2012). The
[potential risk from [superbugs]{.mark} is **grave**]{.underline}. The
general director of the WHO described it as being a "[**fundamental
[threat]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} human [health]{.mark}]{.underline},
[development [and security]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Fox 2016). [In the USA
alone]{.underline}, in 2019 the rate of superbug infections was 2.8
million each year with more than 35,000 deaths (CDC 2019). [This
[rate]{.mark} has likely [risen by **15%**]{.mark} between 2019 and
2020]{.underline} (Mishra 2022). [**Globally** the situation is
**worse**]{.underline}. [In 2019 an estimated **1.27 million deaths**
were **directly tied** to these superbugs]{.underline}, with another
4.95 million associated with such infections. The [global burden of
these infections is likely **higher than HIV** or
**Malaria**]{.underline}. Like many other pandemic-related topics, the
global burden of these diseases unequally spread with much higher
concentrations in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia (Antimicrobial
Resistance Collaborators 2022). Biomedical researcher Dr. Brian K.
Coombes described the severity of the situation, "[[antibiotics]{.mark}
[are the **foundation** on]{.mark} which **[all modern]{.mark}
[medicine]{.mark}** rests]{.underline}. [Cancer
**chemo**]{.underline}therapy, **[organ transplants]{.underline}**,
**[surgeries]{.underline}**, [and childbirth all **rely on antibiotics**
to **prevent infections**]{.underline}. [If you can't treat
those]{.underline}, [then we **lose the medical advances** we have made
in the last **50 years**]{.underline}" (Miller 2015). Even if bio risks,
such as [[pandemics]{.underline}]{.mark}, are not technically defined as
a genuine existential threat and are instead understood as a global
catastrophic risk, [there is a consensus that they [should be a]{.mark}n
issue of **[global priority]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Connell 2017; Palmer
et al. 2017). These evaluations of the destructive potential of
pandemics focus on it being the direct cause of an existential or global
catastrophic threat. [The [possibility of]{.mark} pandemics
following]{.underline} similar [pathways]{.underline} as discussed
[regarding **[Great Power Conflicts]{.mark}** [makes]{.mark} a
pandemic's **indirect** or **compounding [risk]{.mark}** [a]{.mark}
topic of **[concern]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Global cooperation is needed
to address another existential risk a pandemic could hinder. A pandemic
could occur alongside another existential threat, such as a Great Power
Conflict or runaway global warming overtaxing the systems that might
otherwise make us resilient to such a risk.

#### Disease increases internal conflict

**Cordell '23** \[Rebecca, Reed M. Wood, Thorin M. Wright, June 24;
Professor of Political Science focusing on international relations,
human rights, and state repression; Oxford Academic, "Disease and
Dissent: Epidemics as a Catalyst for Social Unrest,"
https://academic.oup.com/isagsq/article/3/2/ksad031/7206859\] mahedhar

Social [**unrest manifests** in]{.underline} a [variety of
ways]{.underline}, ranging from organized acts of civil disobedience and
non-violent demonstrations to **[violent]{.underline}**, sometimes
[deadly **intra-communal riots** and insurrections]{.underline}. While
different forms of unrest possess distinctive qualities, [all types of
collective dissent reflect situations in which]{.underline} groups of
individuals coordinate (to some degree) their [actions in order to
express **collective grievances** and **seek redress**]{.underline} for
those for grievances by attempting to impose costs on their perceived
source (e.g., the government, other societal groups, etc.).2

Theories of [**social unrest** often explain]{.underline} its onset and
[expansion by focusing on]{.underline} either the [collective
grievances]{.underline} that **[motivate dissent and
violence]{.underline}** (e.g., Gurr 1970) or structural and
organizational changes within groups and polities that create new
opportunities for mobilization (e.g., McAdam, Tarrow, and Tilly 2004).
While these theoretical frameworks privilege different explanatory
factors and identify different mechanisms responsible for dissent, they
are rarely mutually exclusive. However, the ubiquitous nature of
grievances implies that expanding opportunities are often required for
the transformation of public dissatisfaction into popular mobilization
(Oberschall 1978; Jenkins 1983). As such, the presence of political
opportunities likely conditions the role of grievances in motivating
collective dissent (Grasso and Giugni 2016). As we discuss in greater
detail below, [**epidemics** often **produce grievances** as well as
**create opportunities** for mobilization, **increasing** the likelihood
of **social unrest** in affected locales.]{.underline}

[Grievance-oriented mobilization theories highlight **material factors**
such as relative **economic deprivation**, **income inequality**, and
**worsening macroeconomic conditions**]{.underline}. Despite ambiguous
[empirical support]{.underline} in earlier studies regarding the role of
deprivation and structural inequality in driving protest and rebellion,
several recent studies indicate that [material grievances are
**important** motivators of **social unrest**]{.underline}. For example,
Mueller (2013) finds that contemporary protests in Africa are often
driven by economic grievances. Similarly, Kawalerowicz and Biggs (2015)
demonstrate that economic [deprivation and **material
grievances**]{.underline} were [strongly associated with]{.underline}
participation in the 2011 London [Riots]{.underline}. Other studies
likewise suggest that acute financial losses, unexpected labor market
contractions, and rising inter-group competition over resources are
associated with social unrest (Olzak and Shanahan 1996; della Porta
2008; Grasso and Giugni 2016), while economic growth appears to inhibit
some forms of unrest (Bohlken and Sergenti 2010). A related body of
research identifies food insecurity and food price volatility, which
often generate grievances and exacerbate resource competition, as
important catalysts for social unrest and violent conflict (e.g.,
Bellemare 2014; Hendrix and Haggard 2015). Patterns of civil unrest are
also heavily influenced by how authorities respond to public grievances,
dissident demands, and prior patterns of dissent (Wilkinson 2009). In
particular, state repression is often viewed as a source of collective
grievances that motivates dissent (Opp and Roehl 1990; Rasler 1996).

In contrast to grievance-based arguments, political opportunity
arguments stress the central role of structural or organizational
changes that raise or lower the costs of mobilization or influence the
perceived odds of its success. Conceptualizations of political
opportunity vary substantially and often include changes in activists'
perception of threat, [weakened **state repressive** capacity,
**diminished state** bureaucratic capabilities, and **declining
government legitimacy**]{.underline} (e.g., Brocket 1991; Boudreau 1996;
Meyer 2004). The presence or proliferation of these factors encourages
dissent among aggrieved members of the community, thus [**increasing**
the odds of unrest.]{.underline}

[Insights from these]{.underline} broad theoretical [traditions inform
our argument regarding the expected relationship between **epidemics and
unrest**.]{.underline} The brief [review of the literature]{.underline}
above [highlights]{.underline} a set of [intermediary factors that we
argue link large-scale **disease outbreaks** and patterns of social
unrest]{.underline}. More specifically, we contend that [**protests**,
**riots**, and other forms of **unrest emerge** as collective responses
to the conditions **epidemics create**]{.underline} in affected
communities and the policies governments adopt as they attempt to manage
the disease outbreak. In this sense, we view the relationship between
**[epidemics and unrest]{.underline}** as [**similar** to]{.underline}
the links scholars now commonly draw between exogenous environmental
factors such as climate change or natural **[disasters and
sociopolitical conflict]{.underline}**. For example, climate change
itself has little direct influence on the location or timing of [social
conflict and dissent]{.underline}. Rather, the droughts, floods, or
shorter growing seasons associated with climate change influence
resource availability, food prices and supply, migration, and economic
growth, which in turn influence the timing and locations of social
conflict (e.g., Nördas and Gleditsch 2007; Raleigh 2010; Hendrix and
Salehyan 2012; Jones, Mattiacci, and Braumoeller 2017). Similarly,
natural disasters are linked to political violence, instability,
dissent, and repression through largely indirect mechanisms. These
include the adverse impact of disasters on resource scarcity, inequality
and deprivation, pre-existing social cleavages, and state capacity
(Drury and Olson 1998; Quiroz Flores and Smith 2013; Wood and Wright
2016).

As with climate change and natural disasters, epidemics are not the
proximate cause of unrest. Instead, large-scale [outbreaks of infectious
**disease**]{.underline} often [create conditions]{.underline} that are
conducive [to collective **dissent**, **unrest**, and]{.underline}
popular [**resistance** to authority]{.underline}. [**Epidemics induce
fear** and **heighten uncertainty**, **diminish state
capacity**,]{.underline} generate acute [economic losses]{.underline},
[create resource shortages and competition, **undermine** leaders'
legitimacy, and **intensify**]{.underline} existing [iniquities in
societies.]{.underline} These factors in turn create opportunities and
incentives for members of the public to mobilize---sometimes
**[violently]{.underline}**---[against]{.underline} the
[government]{.underline} or against [other social groups]{.underline}
that participants hold responsible for collective grievances.

#### Social unrest causes war

**Stewart '2** -- \[Frances, February 9; Writer specialized in
development and social studies; National Library of Medicine, "Root
causes of violent conflict in developing countries,"
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1122271/\]mahedhar

[Many groups of people who fight together perceive themselves as
belonging to a common culture]{.underline} (ethnic or religious), and
part of the reason that [they are fighting]{.underline} may be [to
maintain their cultural autonomy]{.underline}. For this reason, there is
a tendency to attribute wars to "primordial" ethnic passions, which
makes them seem intractable. This view is not correct, however, and
[diverts attention from important underlying]{.underline} economic and
[political factors]{.underline}.

Although a person\'s culture is partly inherited it is also constructed
and chosen, and [many people have multiple identities]{.underline}.2
Many of the ethnic identities in Africa that today seem to be so strong
were "invented" by the colonial powers for administrative purposes and
have only weak origins in precolonial Africa.3 [Their boundaries are
generally fluid, and they have rightly been described as "fuzzy
sets]{.underline}."4

In wars [political leaders may deliberately "rework historical
memories"]{.underline} to engender or strengthen this identity in the
competition for power and resources. [For example, in the conflict in
Matebeland in post-independence Zimbabwe]{.underline}, Ndebele identity
was used to advance political objectives.5 Other well known examples
include the Nazis in Germany, the Hutus in Rwanda (fig 2), and, today,
the emphasis on Muslim consciousness by the Taliban and others.

Economic factors which predispose to war

Four economic hypotheses have been put forward to explain [intra-state
wars, based on factors related to group motivation, private motivation,
failure of the social contract, and environmental
degradation.]{.underline}

[Group motivation hypothesis]{.underline}---Since intra-state wars
mainly consist of fighting between groups, group motives, resentments,
and ambitions provide motivation for war.4,6,7 [Groups may be divided
along cultural or religious lines, by geography, or by class. Group
differences only become worth fighting for]{.underline}, however, if
there are other important differences between groups, particularly in
the distribution and exercise of political and economic power.8 In this
situation [relatively deprived groups]{.underline} are likely to
[seek]{.underline} (or be persuaded by their leaders to seek)
[redress]{.underline}. Where political redress is not possible they [may
resort to war]{.underline}. Resentments inspired by group differences,
termed [horizontal inequalities, are a major cause of war]{.underline}.
[These group differences have many dimension]{.underline}s---economic,
political, and social (see table ). Relatively [privileged groups may
also be motivated to fight]{.underline} to [protect their
privileges]{.underline} against attack from relatively deprived groups.6

Private motivation hypothesis---[War confers benefits on individuals as
well as costs which can motivate people to fight]{.underline}.9,10 Young
uneducated men, in particular, may gain employment as soldiers. War also
generates opportunities to loot, profiteer from shortages and from aid,
trade arms, and carry out illicit production and trade in drugs,
diamonds, timber, and other commodities. Where alternative opportunities
are few, because of low incomes and poor employment, and the
possibilities of enrichment by war are considerable, the [incidence and
duration of wars are likely to be greater.]{.underline} This "greed
hypothesis" has its base in rational choice economics.10,11

[Failure of the social contract]{.underline}---This [derives from the
view that social stability is based on]{.underline} a hypothetical
social contract between [the people and the government]{.underline}.
People accept state authority so long as the state delivers services and
[provides reasonable]{.underline} economic [conditions]{.underline}
(employment and incomes). With economic stagnation or decline, and
worsening state services, the [social contract breaks down, and violence
results]{.underline}. Hence high and rising levels of poverty and a
decline in [state services would be expected to cause
conflict]{.underline}.12

Green war hypothesis---This points to [environmental degradation as a
source of poverty and cause of conflict]{.underline}.13,14 For example,
rising population pressure and falling agricultural productivity may
lead to land disputes. Growing scarcity of water may provoke conflict.15
This hypothesis contradicts the view that people fight to secure control
over environmental riches.10,16

The four [hypotheses are not mutually exclusive]{.underline}. For
example, the [conflict in the Sudan is an example of both horizontal
inequality]{.underline} (with people in the south being heavily
deprived) and powerful private gains that perpetuate the struggle.9
While environmental poverty has plausibly been an important factor in
the conflict in Rwanda, it does not seem to have been in the former
Yugoslavia.

The evidence underpinning the hypotheses

Evidence from case studies and statistical analyses suggest that each
hypothesis has something to contribute to explaining conflict.

[Group inequality]{.underline}---There is [consistent evidence of sharp
horizontal inequalities between groups in conflict]{.underline}.17 Group
inequalities in political access are invariably observed---hence the
resort to violence rather than seeking to resolve differences through
political negotiation. Group inequalities in economic dimensions are
common, although not invariably large (such as in Bosnia18). Horizontal
inequalities are most [likely to lead to conflict where they are
substantial, consistent, and increasing over time]{.underline}. Although
systematic cross country evidence is rare, one study classified 233
politicised communal groups in 93 countries according to political,
economic, and ecological differences and found that most groups
suffering horizontal inequalities had taken some action to assert group
interests, ranging from non-violent protest to rebellion.4

Private motivation---The view that private motivation plays an important
role in prolonging, if not causing, conflict in some countries is well
supported by work in the Sudan, Sierra Leone, and Liberia.9,19,20
Collier and Hoeffler tested the greed hypothesis (albeit with a rather
crude measure of resource riches) and found a significant association
with conflict, although this has been challenged.21 They also found that
greater male education to higher secondary level reduced the risk of
war. They concluded that "greed" outperforms grievance in explaining
conflict.

[Failure of the social contract---Econometric studies show
that]{.underline} the incidence of [conflict is higher among
countries]{.underline} with low per capita incomes, life expectancy, and
economic growth.10,12,22 However, many statistical investigations of the
association between vertical income distribution and conflict produce
differing results.10,12,23 It has been suggested that funding programmes
from the International Monetary Fund---usually associated with cuts in
[government services---cause conflicts]{.underline}, but neither
statistical nor case study evidence supports this, perhaps because
[countries on the verge of conflict do not generally qualify for such
programmes]{.underline}.12,24

Russian President Vladimir [[Putin\'s invasion of Ukraine]{.mark} in
February 2022 [highlighted NATO\'s importance]{.mark}.]{.underline}
\"Almost [two years after Putin\'s [unprovoked invasion of
Ukraine](https://www.defense.gov/Spotlights/Support-for-Ukraine/) ---
the most serious threat to transatlantic security in decades --- NATO
has grown [stronger and more united]{.mark} than ever,]{.underline}\"
Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III said following a meeting of
defense ministers at NATO headquarters in Brussels this February.

If Putin is successful and Russia is able to conquer a neighboring
nation --- forcefully deposing a freely elected government --- then
other neighboring nations may be endangered. [\"[Putin is not going to
stop at Ukraine]{.mark},\"]{.underline} President [Biden
said]{.underline} alongside French President Emmanuel Macron after talks
in Paris, June 8. [\"[All of Europe will be threatened]{.mark}, we are
[not going]{.mark} to let that [happen]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}

The European NATO allies are aware of the dangers posed by Putin\'s
expansionist tendencies. [In 2014, when Russia first invaded Ukraine and
occupied Crimea, only three NATO member states had achieved the
alliance\'s goal of 2% of gross domestic product devoted to defense.
This year, [24 nations are expected to]{.mark} at least [make]{.mark}
the [2%]{.mark} level and many nations are taking that percentage of
expenditures as the floor, not the ceiling for defense appropriations.
Last year saw the ninth consecutive rise in European and Canadian
defense spending. And in 2024, NATO members in Europe will invest a
total of \$470 billion in defense.]{.underline}

So, what makes NATO worthwhile to the United States? After all, at 1.3
million active-duty service members, almost 770,000 reservists and a
\$800 billion budget, [the [U.S. has the largest, best-funded military
in NATO.]{.mark}]{.underline}

On the other hand[, [Russia]{.mark} has roughly [1.15 million
active-duty personnel and another 800,000
reservists]{.mark}.]{.underline}

But the alliance is about more than how many troops any one nation can
bring to the fight.

[[NATO\'s]{.mark} members have a collective [defense budget]{.mark}
that\'s north of [\$1.2 trillion]{.mark}. NATO nations share advanced
training, tactics, equipment and often, weapons platforms. There are
also NATO\'s overflight agreements, basing arrangements,
intelligence-sharing protocols, common command structures and day-to-day
familiarity with each other. Critically, NATO can maintain and sustain
its forces.]{.underline}

And about those troop numbers[: The [32 NATO nations]{.mark} together
have about 3[,368,000 active-duty personnel]{.mark}, and each NATO
nation has its own reserve forces, along with some paramilitary
formations. This is **[deterrence in the flesh]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

NATO Around the World

The alliance is addressing more than just threats from Russia.
[[NATO]{.mark} has reached out to nations such as Australia, New Zealand
and Japan as it watches moves by China in the Asia-Pacific, as well as
in Africa and, [increasingly, the **Arctic**]{.mark}. NATO has a program
to work with Mediterranean nations. The [alliance]{.mark} is [addressing
cyber threats and the moral use of a]{.mark}rtificial
[i]{.mark}ntelligence.]{.underline}

The Cold War wasn\'t won by political parties, but by all Americans and
all citizens of NATO countries. [The [unity of the alliance]{.mark} was
[important to ending]{.mark} the [Cold War]{.mark},]{.underline} but so
was American leadership and will, as U.S. presidents from Bill Clinton
to George W. Bush to Joe Biden said

The alliance has had widespread U.S. support since its founding in 1949.
But there are calls for [[isolationism]{.underline}]{.mark} --- of
America going it alone[. In an interconnected world,]{.underline} this
[[isn\'t possible.]{.underline}]{.mark}

The only time NATO invoked Article 5 of the Washington Treaty was when
terrorists attacked the U.S. on Sept. 11, 2001. NATO personnel fought
and died alongside American forces in Afghanistan.

Secretary Austin has noted that America\'s greatest asymmetric advantage
over any competitor is its network of allies and partners. **[[NATO is
the jewel in the crown]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[\"Our allies magnify our strength and expand our
security,\"]{.underline} Austin said in Brussels. [\"[America\'s network
of allies and partners worldwide]{.mark} --- built and sustained by wise
administrations of both parties in the decades since the nightmare of
World War II --- remains a [core strategic strength that no rival can
match]{.mark} --- and that none should doubt.\"]{.underline}

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance will celebrate
its 75^th^ anniversary at its summit in Washington, D.C. in July. Since
1949 it has been the beating heart of the transatlantic partnership, and
a vital force uniting the United States, Canada, and our allies across
the Atlantic. With the recent accession of Finland, the alliance today
has 31 members, which will increase to 32 with Sweden expected to
formally join soon.

Now, NATO must also evolve to be increasingly prepared to stand up to
the immensely growing threat posed by China and the genocidal regime in
Iran. While NATO's focus in its first 75 years has overwhelmingly been
on the threat posed by Moscow, the specter of Communist China and a
nuclear-armed Iran loom large on the horizon.

militia group which claimed the lives of three U.S. servicemen is a
stark reminder of the deadly threat that Tehran poses. And NATO's
critical role in Afghanistan in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks on the
United States demonstrated that the alliance must also be ready to
combat the wide array of Islamist terrorist movements that seek to
threaten the West, from al-Qaeda to ISIS.

[The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has a [significant national
interest in supporting and strengthening the NATO alliance]{.mark},
which has been the beneficiary of a significant investment by U.S.
taxpayers.]{.underline} A secure Europe and a robust transatlantic
alliance, including the U.S./U.K. Special Relationship, advances the
security of the American people. As former British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher noted in a speech in 1991 to the Foreign Relations
Council of Chicago, "the United States needs friends in the lonely task
of world leadership."

However, [to sustain the alliance, America's [NATO allies must be
prepared]{.mark} to step up to the plate, and [**fully participate** in
burden sharing]{.mark} with the U.S.]{.underline} The Russians clearly
view NATO as weak and divided and are increasingly willing to test its
resolve. President Biden claims the alliance is "more united than ever,"
but we need to see real material unity and not just rhetoric. The next
U.S. presidency must apply concerted pressure on America's allies to do
far more to foster partnership rather than dependency.

[[This **cannot be a two-tier alliance**]{.mark}, [where]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [carries]{.mark} the overwhelming
[military load for the defense of the free world.]{.mark} Last year,
only 11 NATO members spent the 2 per cent of GDP on defense]{.underline}
(Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania,
the Slovak Republic, the United Kingdom, and the United States) [agreed
to almost a decade ago---[and almost two years after Putin invaded
Ukraine](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/01/20/lord-george-robertson-ukraine-nato-putin-russia-war-china/).]{.underline}
This is unacceptable. [It leaves the [alliance **dangerously
vulnerable**]{.mark} when it should be projecting strength and
resolve.]{.underline}

[Not only should [every NATO member]{.mark} invest the minimum agreed
level of spending on their own defense, but they [should also aspire to
match the current U.S. level of 3.5 per cent of
GDP]{.mark}.]{.underline} Justin Trudeau's Canada, for example, spent
only 1.29 per cent of its GDP on defense in 2023, a shockingly low
figure for a nation with the 10^th^ largest GDP in the world. Germany
has pledged to increase defense spending to 2 per cent of GDP in 2024,
but after decades of reckless underinvestment, the world's fourth
largest economy should be doubling that investment [[if it is serious
about defending its own borders from a potential future attack by
Russia.]{.underline}]{.mark}

At the same time [the [U.S. cannot allow NATO to be undercut by
grandiose Parisian visions of a European Union army that]{.mark} would
[split]{.mark} the [alliance and divert vital resources away from NATO

States. [[Macron]{.underline}]{.mark}, who has [dismissed [NATO]{.mark}

Joe Biden has done nothing to reject this approach. His successor in the

Eurfederalists and declare that NATO and the transatlantic alliance is
the only vehicle for the security of Europe.

### NATO Good \-\-- Econ

#### NATO strengthens the U.S. economy by boosting trade, investment, and global market stability through security.

For the best part of the post-World War II era the value of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance was unchallenged. Binding
together Western Europe with Canada and the US as a bulwark against
Soviet aggression, it was one of the twentieth century's most readily
accepted geopolitical structures.

As a military deterrent the alliance was to prove unassailable. While
the Cold War was certainly a period of great tension -- Budapest,
Prague, Berlin and the Cuban Missile Crisis were obvious flashpoints --
the threat of Soviet invasion of Western Europe, let alone North
America, never seemed as imminent. 

[Very early on, [NATO leaders realized]{.mark} that the
[benefits]{.mark} of the alliance extended [beyond military security and
included economic stability]{.mark} as well]{.underline}.  In 1957, the
NATO Council created an Economics Committee where the economic
relationship between NATO and the East is analyzed. 

[As the ultimate security blanket, [NATO]{.mark} also [provided]{.mark}
its [member]{.mark} nations [with]{.mark} a [status as safe
havens]{.mark} in which [to invest and]{.mark} with which to
[trade]{.mark}. This brought broad and [deep benefits]{.mark} to [member
nations, including the US.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[In a November 2022 paper, University of Oklahoma economist Anthony A.
Mayberry [found](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4281186) that
virtually [all Eastern and Central European countries that joined NATO
experienced major gains in GDP per capita as a result of their
membership]{.mark}. Examining the three NATO enlargements that brought
former Eastern Bloc countries into NATO \-- 1999 (Czech Republic,
Hungary, and Poland); 2004 (Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania,
Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia); and 2009 (Albania and Croatia) -- Mr.
Mayberry found that in every case, save for that of the Czech Republic[,
GDP growth per capita surged after these countries joined the
alliance.]{.mark} ]{.underline}

[He estimated that [joining NATO led to average income gains per capita
of roughly 15% during the first 10 years of membership.]{.mark} For
Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Slovakia, and Albania the
gains were between 16% \-- 51% higher than would have been the case
without membership. The gains for Hungary, Bulgaria, and Croatia were
smaller but still significant with GDP per capita rising between
6%-9%. ]{.underline}

In a single year, the economies of Estonia and Latvia, which both joined
NATO in
2004, [posted](https://www.quora.com/Is-there-a-correlation-between-a-countrys-membership-in-NATO-and-its-economic-status) substantial
increases in economic output. One year after joining the alliance,
Estonia's GDP growth leapt from 6.5% to 9.5%, while Latvian economic
expansion accelerated from 8.7% to 10.6%. In Estonia, foreign investment
more than tripled from \$965.8 million to \$3.1 billion after NATO
accession. 

Even before joining they join alliance, candidate countries saw huge
improvements in investor confidence that led to
significant [gains](https://iges.ba/en/security/nato-membership-brings-stability-and-economic-growth/#:~:text=The%20increase%20in%20investment%20in,90%25%20increase%20in%20foreign%20investment) in
foreign direct investment. The stability and security of membership
proved to be a major attraction for investors. Once Slovakia's
membership ticket was punched foreign investment soared by 318%, while
in Slovenia investment rose 148.7%, in Romania 166.29%, Bulgaria 47.5%,
Lithuania 290% and Latvia 90%. 

[The [US]{.mark} has also [benefitted **economically** from NATO
expansion]{.mark}]{.underline}. Excluding East Germany, which reunified
with West Germany in 1991, [[US exports to new NATO member
countries [rose](https://forbes.ge/the-economic-effect-of-nato/) from
\$900 million in 1989 to \$9.4 billion in 2016.]{.mark} ]{.underline}

[A 2014 report from the Rand
Corporation [argues](https://users/keithrockwell/Downloads/RAND_RR518.pdf) [persuasively](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR518.html) that
"[US security commitments have significantly positive effects on US
bilateral trade]{.mark}."  By the same token, a reduced security
presence would adversely impact US trading relationships. The study
suggests that [trade would fall by \$450 billion were security
commitments to be cut by 50%.]{.mark} [Such a cut would in turn
lead]{.mark}, says Rand, [to a decline in GDP of "as much as \$490
billion."]{.mark}]{.underline}

The collapse of the Soviet Union and the reunification of Germany may
have led some countries -- including the US -- to take NATO for granted.
But in Europe, Russia's invasion of Ukraine has given the alliance a
prominence and importance it has not seen in decades. Moscow's actions
have sparked long neutral states Finland and Stockholm to join the NATO
fold while bolstering the military commitment of those members which had
been either Soviet republics or members of the Warsaw Pact. 

Still, some leaders have questioned the utility of the Atlantic
alliance. In 2019, French President Emmanuel Macron said NATO was poised
to become
"[brain-dead](https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/11/07/emmanuel-macron-warns-europe-nato-is-becoming-brain-dead)."
As a candidate for president in 2016, Donald Trump regularly referred to
NATO as
"[obsolete](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-nato-past-comments/)." 

Now, Mr. Macron, sings a different tune. In February he said the
presence of NATO troops fighting Russians in Ukraine could not be
excluded. Mr. Trump's position, on the other hand, seems little changed.

In fact, Washington has grumbled for decades about European Allies
failing to shoulder an appropriate financial and military burden to
support an alliance which after all is designed to protect its very
borders. 

Following Russia's occupation of Crimea in 2014, the heads of State and
government of NATO's 32 members pledged to spend at least 2% of their
GDP on defense, or a total of roughly \$380 billion. Such outlays would
boost the alliance's capacity to respond to any further Russian
aggression and provide a stabilizing counterpoint to volatility in the
Middle East.

But many NATO members have fared poorly in reaching this target. In
2023, for example, defense contributions from a majority of NATO members
(18) fell short of the threshold. It is interesting but perhaps not
surprising that the NATO members physically nearest to Russia
consistently meet their obligations. Poland spends the highest
percentage of its GDP on defense (3.9%), more even than the US (3.49%).
Britain and Greece exceed the threshold as well. Countries in Eastern
Europe reliably hit their targets \-- Estonia (2.73%), Lithuania
(2.54%), Finland (2.45%), Romania (2.44%), Hungary (2.43%) and Latvia
(2.07%) 

US grumbling became more ominous when Donald Trump was elected president
in 2016. As president he made noises about leaving NATO but never really
pushed the issue too much. But in February
he [told](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/02/10/politics/trump-russia-nato/index.html) a
rally in Conway, South Carolina that he would not defend those that do
not meet the 2% target. "No, I would not protect you. In fact, I would
encourage them (the Russians) to do whatever the hell they want. You got
to pay. You got to pay your bills." To suggest that Mr. Trump has the
attention of the Europeans is to understate the case. NATO Secretary
General Jens
Stoltenberg [said](https://www.forces.net/news/world/nato-which-countries-pay-their-share-defence) last
year that in 2024 18 nations would spend 2% of GDP on defense - up from
11 in 2023 and only three in 2014. 

The very real prospect of Donald Trump's return to the White House is
forcing Europe to think long and hard about its future security and how
it would respond to Russian aggression. Germany has long been regarded
as France's most important European ally and its economic might is
formidable. But militarily Germany is considered weak. A weakened NATO
may lead France to reconsider its alliances. French officials say that
should Mr. Trump win and NATO be undermined, Britain and its more
formidable military prowess, would assume a more important role in
French foreign policy. The importance of Britain's military might would
necessitate it having a much closer relationship between the countries
with Western Europe's strongest militaries. German
officials [pondered](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/16/trump-rhetoric-ukraine-europe-us-relations) earlier
this year whether they may need to obtain an independent nuclear
deterrent. 

[A [nuclear armed Germany. Soaring anxiety in Eastern and Central
Europe]{.mark}. An emboldened [Russia]{.mark} looking to further [expand
it zone of influence.]{.mark} [Diminished confidence in the US as a
dependable, reliable partner and ally]{.mark}]{.underline}. All of these
scenarios are not only possible, but they are also likely should NATO
weaken and fracture[. Such outcomes would obviously [be **very bad for

President Donald Trump will attend the first NATO summit of his second
term on Tuesday, at a time when the alliance's 21st-century relevance
has never been clearer --- but [when its sustainability is also in
question, with a NATO-skeptical American president back in the Oval
Office. Given these realities, [Europe needs to show it will contribute
its share to ensure the alliance is stable and
strong]{.mark}.]{.underline}

But, days before the summit[, [Spain rejected]{.mark} a [proposal from
NATO Secretary]{.mark} General Mark Rutte for [alliance members to
commit to]{.mark} eventually [investing 5 percent of their gross
domestic product in defense-related spending]{.mark}.]{.underline} To
avoid derailing the summit, Rutte agreed on Sunday to exempt Spain.

[Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez, a socialist, [said that [5
percen]{.mark}t](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/06/19/spain-nato-spending-increase/41bf7fd4-4d0c-11f0-8fff-262d6ec54ab9_story.html) "would
be [incompatible]{.mark} with our welfare state and our world vision."
Then he added that [his country remains **"fully committed to
NATO."**]{.mark}]{.underline}

No doubt, Sánchez is fully committed to the benefits of
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} membership. It's the [[most effective,
powerful and vital military alliance in the history of the world,
providing the protection of the American nuclear umbrella and much
more]{.underline}]{.mark}. But that comes at a cost, and [the United
States cannot bear a disproportionate share. ([U.S. defense spending
accounts]{.mark} for about [half]{.mark} of all NATO
spending.)]{.underline} The Ukraine war demands that alliance members
deter a revanchist Russia, which will require broad investment in
European self-defense.

Sánchez complains that increasing defense spending might require
trimming some public benefits, scaling back green energy projects or
taking on debt. His reluctance reflects the attitude, explicit or
implied, among many European NATO members for many years.

Trump helped force European allies to take their own defense more
seriously --- especially Germany. But Spain's position threatened the
Pan-European rearmament effort, because NATO bylaws require consensus
among all 32 member states. A joint statement, to be signed at the end
of the abbreviated summit in the Netherlands on Wednesday, will now call
on "allies" --- instead of "we" --- to reach 5 percent.

Rutte's plan already offered NATO members lots of wiggle
room.** **The [5 percent
topline](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/06/20/nato-defense-spending-budgets-trump-summit/31ef0fbc-4dc9-11f0-8fff-262d6ec54ab9_story.html) includes
3.5 percent for core defense spending --- tanks, planes, missiles,
troops --- and allows for 1.5 percent to go toward "military-adjacent"
initiatives. This could mean investing in infrastructure, such as roads
and bridges --- or even cybersecurity resilience. [The NATO
[proposal]{.mark} would [allow]{.mark} a [country's aid to Ukraine to
count toward its core defense spending target.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Last year, Spain spent less on defense than any other NATO member
despite being the euro zone's fourth-largest economy. This spring,
Sánchez announced that his government would [raise defense
spending](https://breakingdefense.com/2025/04/spain-launches-12-billion-defense-plan-to-meet-natos-2-percent-gdp-spending-target/) by
\$12 billion in 2025 to reach a preexisting target of 2 percent of GDP.
Alas, even that modest improvement prompted blowback from the left flank
of his coalition. With Sánchez's inner circle and even members of his
family ensnared by corruption scandals, some of his allies have publicly
pressed him to call early elections. Last week's announcement was aimed
at placating these people.

But politics does not end at the Pyrenees. [[Spain's obstinance]{.mark}
gives Trump fodder to [call into question]{.mark} the [U.S.
commitment]{.mark} to the broader alliance. And it [gives]{.mark} other
[European countries an excuse to drag their feet down the
road]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Also in question is the time by which countries need to reach any new
spending target. Rutte initially floated 2032, but the final document
might now wind up saying 2035 --- or not setting a date at all. The
former Dutch prime minister has said that Russia could be ready to
launch an attack on NATO territory by 2030 --- a reason to be more
aggressive.

Spain isn't the only country that needs to boost security spending.
Canada [spent ](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2024/6/pdf/240617-def-exp-2024-en.pdf)1.3
percent of GDP on defense last year, though Prime Minister Mark Carney
has [pledged](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/canada-promises-ramp-up-defense-spending-met-nato-target-much-earlier-2025-06-09/) to
hit 2 percent this year. Italy and Belgium are still not on track to
meet the 2 percent target that NATO agreed to in 2014. Britain has, so
far, committed to spending just 3 percent on defense by 2034.

[Trump is right that **[Europe needs to become more
self-sufficient]{.mark}**. Though the U.S. commitment to NATO should
remain ironclad, Washington must also make major investments in other
theaters. The strike on Iranian nuclear facilities over the weekend
shows the U.S. will be unable to avoid the Middle East. And, most
urgently, [America needs to counter a rising
China]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

From London and Brussels to Ottawa, NATO is worth fighting, and
spending, to preserve. That truth should be visible in Madrid, too.

[Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that [if the U.S. decides
to leave NATO]{.mark}, "[The risk that Russia will occupy Europe is
**100 percent**]{.mark}]{.underline}." President Donald Trump has
frequently threatened to leave the alliance.

In an interview that aired Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press, Zelensky told
moderator Kristen Welker that Russian President [Vladimir [Putin would
send troops to former Soviet nations]{.mark}. "They will begin" by
occupying "small countries who've been in the U.S.S.R., in the Soviet
Union]{.underline}."

"We will see what will be the answer," he said of the scenario where the
U.S. leaves NATO. "[But [Europe]{.mark} will not answer because they
don't have --- they [will begin to defend itself. Each country defend
itself]{.mark}... [So Russia will get all the]{.mark} successes with
**all the [territory]{.mark}** [they will want]{.mark}."]{.underline}

Trump's presence in the White House and close relationship with Putin
poses an existential threat to NATO. ["We've now got an alliance between
a Russian president who wants to destroy Europe and an American
president who also wants to destroy Europe,"]{.underline} one diplomat
told Politico.

Zelensky's comments come as the U.S. and Europe wrap up the Munich
Security Conference, where [[the]{.mark} [Trump administration has left
Europe]{.mark}an leaders **[shaken]{.mark}**, concerned the its plans to
withdraw tens of thousands of its armed forces from Europe,]{.underline}
The New York Times reported.

"What I worry about is the threat from within, the retreat of Europe
from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United
States of America," Vice President J.D. Vance said Friday to NATO
leaders, accusing them of "censorship" and not maintaining security.

#### Russia's motive has always been to end democracy \-\-- not just NATO

**Person and McFaul 22** \[Robert Person is a professor of international

University, "What Putin Fears Most," 04/2022,

Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine has ignited the largest war in
Europe since the Second World War, indiscriminately spilling the blood
of thousands of Ukrainian soldiers and innocent civilians. [Russian
president Vladimir [Putin wants you to believe]{.mark} that [NATO is to
blame]{.mark}.]{.underline} He has frequently claimed that NATO
expansion---not the 200,000 Russian soldiers and sailors attacking
Ukraine's ports, airfields, roads, railways, and cities---is the central
driver of this crisis. Following John Mearsheimer's provocative 2014
Foreign Affairs article arguing that "the Ukraine crisis is the West's
fault," [[the narrative of]{.mark} Russian [backlash against
NATO]{.mark} expansion [has become]{.mark} a dominant [framework]{.mark}
for explaining---if not [justifying]{.mark}---Moscow's ongoing [war
against Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}.1 This notion has been repeated not
only in Moscow but in the United States, Europe, and elsewhere by
politicians, analysts, and writers. Multiple rounds of enlargement, they
argue, exacerbated Russia's sense of insecurity as NATO forces crept
closer to Russia's borders, finally provoking Putin to lash out
violently, first by invading Georgia in 2008, then Ukraine in 2014, and
now a second, likely far larger, invasion of Ukraine today. By this
telling, the specter of Ukraine's NATO membership points both to the
cause of the conflict and its solution: Take membership off the table
for Ukraine, so the argument goes, and future wars will be prevented.

[[This argument has two flaws]{.underline}]{.mark}, one about history
and one about Putin's thinking[. First, [NATO]{.mark} [expansion has not
been a **constant source** of tension]{.mark} between Russia and the
West, [but a **variable**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Over the last
thirty years, [the salience of the issue has risen and fallen not
primarily due to waves of NATO expansion, but instead as a result of
waves of democratic expansion in Eurasia]{.underline}. In a very clear
pattern, [[Moscow's complaints]{.mark} about the alliance [spike]{.mark}
**after democratic breakthroughs**]{.underline}. While the tragic
invasions and occupations of Georgia and Ukraine have secured Putin a de
facto veto over their NATO aspirations, since the alliance would never
admit a country under partial occupation by Russian forces, this fact
undermines Putin's claim that the current invasion is aimed at NATO
membership. [[He has already blocked NATO expansion]{.mark} for all
intents and purposes, thereby revealing that he wants something far more
significant [in Ukraine today]{.mark}: the end of democracy and the
return of subjugation.]{.underline} On February 24, [in an hour-long,
meandering rant explaining his decision to invade, he said so
directly.]{.underline}

This reality highlights the second flaw: [Because [the primary threat to
Putin]{.mark} and his autocratic regime [**is democracy**, not
NATO]{.mark}, that [perceived threat would **not magically disappear**
with a moratorium on NATO expansion]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Putin
would not stop seeking to undermine democracy and sovereignty in
Ukraine, Georgia, or the region as a whole if NATO stopped expanding. As
long as citizens in free countries exercise their democratic rights to
elect their own leaders and set their own course in domestic and foreign
politics, Putin will continue to try to undermine them. [Putin's
declared goal of "denazification" in Ukraine is a code word for regime
change---antidemocratic regime change.]{.underline}

### NATO Good\-\--U.S. Heg

#### NATO is better for U.S. hegemony \-\-- directly indicts Coward

No institution lasts forever, and NATO is no exception. If the
"transatlantic bargain" no longer makes sense for any of the partners,
they will split. But chances are that this transatlantic divorce will be
postponed once again, as it has been postponed for decades. Why?
[Because the juggling with numbers and a generous helping of game
theory, as exemplified by [**Alexander Coward's** piece]{.mark}, "It's
Time for the US To Bid Farewell to NATO," [**does not express** what is
really at stake: that the Allies are better off together]{.mark} than
apart.]{.underline}

Yes, Europe's population is bigger than that of the United States. Yes,
Europe's economic power is roughly on par with the US. Yes, Europeans
have been living quite comfortably with the US paying for a large part
of the common defense burden. However, [[the conclusion]{.mark} from
this [is not for the US to exit NATO, but to reform the Alliance]{.mark}
in order to better reflect the imperative of a fairer sharing of the
defense burden.]{.underline} If President-elect Donald Trump is now
boasting that he has made the Allies increase their defense budgets, he
is right: [[The US's allies can step up to the plate]{.mark}, even if to
some observers that process may look unnervingly slow.]{.underline}

Clearly, NATO cannot thrive on Cold War nostalgia. But those who adhere
to the caricature of the alliance as a mere burden-shedding exercise for
wily Europeans risk missing the forest for the trees. Unsurprisingly, as
a superpower with global security interests and commitments, the US
considerably outspends its NATO allies. But it gets more in return than
meets the eye. Here are five primary benefits NATO provides the US.

European stability and US influence

First, [[NATO upholds stability in Europe]{.mark}. Ensuring that a
conflict in Europe does not lead once again to global war has been a
major goal of US foreign policy since 1945]{.underline}. NATO has served
this goal well: It prevented the Cold War from getting hot and, at the
Cold War's end, provided a security home for the new democracies in
Central and Eastern Europe. NATO also played an indispensable role in
bringing peace to the Balkans after the violent collapse of Yugoslavia
in the early 1990s.

[Today, [with Russia waging a major war against Ukraine using political
support from China]{.mark}, soldiers from North Korea and drones from
Iran, [the US would shoot itself in the foot by
disengaging]{.mark}]{.underline}. Europeans understand that the
Asia-Pacific region is gaining in importance. However, this does not
require kissing NATO goodbye, but to have Europe take a greater share of
the dense burden on their own continent. This is exactly what is
happening, with most allies agreeing that NATO's initial goal of
spending 2% of GDP on defense is no longer the ceiling, but only the
floor.

Second, [[the current arrangement gives the US influence over
Europea]{.mark}n security developments]{.underline}. The US and Europe
form the world's largest trade and investment relationship. [Considering
that in addition to the US's security interests, its need to maintain
influence on European issues should be a no-brainer.]{.underline}

[[NATO]{.mark} is the major institutional framework that
[legitimizes]{.mark} such a role for [the U]{.mark}S]{.underline}.
Through the organization, [[the US has]{.mark} effectively [become a
"European power]{.mark}," with a unique voice in European affairs well
beyond defense]{.underline}. Without US membership in NATO, a major
political and military "transmission belt" would be lost, and US weight
in Europe would be much reduced. Washington knows that, even if academic
observers often don't.

NATO contains Russia, and its members are reliable allies

Third[, [NATO helps contain Russi]{.mark}]{.underline}a. Russia's
current military assertiveness demonstrates that geopolitics did not end
with the Cold War. Ukraine was outside the defense perimeter of NATO and
the US, so Moscow concluded that attacking that country would carry
little risk. However, Moscow knows that attacking countries within NATO
would be an entirely different ballgame.

In terms of sheer numbers[, Europe can match Russia in many categories
of military equipment as well as in manpower. However, it is [the US
military and political leadership]{.mark} that [makes the crucial
difference]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} This is why Moscow has always
sought to push the US out of Europe, and why it is now seeking to keep
its war against Ukraine a regional affair, thus avoiding any direct
involvement of NATO.

Today, a credible deterrence posture comes with a smaller price tag than
the massive military presence that the US maintained in Europe during
the Cold War. [But a complete bailing out of European security would
lead the US's challengers to conclude that Washington no longer has the
guts to uphold the liberal order. As a result, Washington's red lines
would be tested around the world. [If the US wants to remain a global
power, it will have to remain a "European power]{.mark}" as]{.underline}
well.

### NATO Good\-\--Prolif/China

#### U.S. exit from Europe increases economic dependence on China for European countries

**Schmitt 24** \[Olivier Schmitt is a Professor at the Center for War
Studies at the University of Southern Denmark, "Why a Rapid U.S.
Withdrawal From Europe Will Reinforce China," 12/17/2024,
https://carnegieendowment.org/europe/strategic-europe/2024/12/why-a-rapid-us-withdrawal-from-europe-will-reinforce-china?lang=en\]

Those around U.S. President-Elect Donald Trump who advocate for a rapid
U.S. drawdown in Europe to better counter China would be wise to heed
the law of unintended consequences.

Broadly speaking, [the elevator pitch for such a rapid withdrawal goes
something like this: The United States' main threat is China, European
countries are wealthy­---with a combined GDP five times larger than
Russia's---therefore, Europe can take care of itself]{.underline}. The
specifics and the timelines may vary, but overall, the U.S. withdrawal
from Europe should be welcomed and will certainly not benefit U.S.
adversaries since Europe can and should spend more on its own defense.

But [the most fervent proponents of this approach seem to be
hyper-compartmentalizing a hyper-interconnected world. In doing so, they
run the risk of scoring an own goal: the strengthening of China's
economy.]{.underline}

The rapid withdrawal argument is divorced from empirical reality for a
simple reason: It overlooks the European economic base of power that
would make such a quick uptick in defense spending possible, especially
when coupled with potential Trump trade tariffs.

In such a scenario, [Europeans would probably double down on their trade
relations with Beijing, since they would need it to maintain a modicum
of prosperity to fund their increased defense effort]{.underline}. Far
from reinforcing Washington, [the proposed policies would only
strengthen China's role in the international system by forcing Europeans
to align more closely with Beijing.]{.underline}

At the same time, [Beijing would be very happy to redirect its own trade
flows from the United States to Europe in order to counter the massive
tariffs that it would suffer. In short, the United States would simply
make China even more central to the world economy while cutting itself
off from the allies most likely to support its policies.]{.underline}

Yes, for the Europeans this would be a short-term fix to alleviate the
economic costs of the U.S. policies that would create more long-term
dependency problems. [But it is a risk that many European leaders would
be willing to take if forced to choose between the immediate fiscal need
to drastically invest in their defense and the long-term dependency on
an authoritarian state like China.]{.underline}

To understand the importance of the economic dimension in security
considerations, it is useful to draw a quick comparison between the
United States and Europe in the past fifteen years. Since early 2020,
America's real growth has reached 10 percent---triple the average of
other G7 nations. Among G20 countries, including major emerging markets,
the United States stands alone in exceeding pre-pandemic projections for
output and employment, as reported by the International Monetary Fund.
Per capita, American economic output is now approximately 40 percent
higher than that of Western Europe and Canada, and 60 percent higher
than Japan's---about double the gaps observed in 1990. In short, the
United States is a large country blessed with natural resources. The
size of its consumer and capital markets means that attractive products
can be distributed at scale across the country, while the shale
revolution has contributed to 10 percent of the U.S. GDP growth since
2010.

Europe, on the other hand, is a politically fragmented, aging continent
without any independent energy source, which limits its current economic
potential.

The EU's so-called single market suffers from continuous fragmentation,
with twenty-four different languages stifling cross-border trade and
there are numerous intra-EU barriers to trade along national lines, such
as different taxation systems, regulated professions, or national
legislations. The capital markets are also fragmented, which limits
investment opportunities. Furthermore, Europe has an aging population,
and ever-tightening immigration policies exacerbate the existing labor
shortages. Perhaps most crucially, Europe's energy dependence make it
vulnerable to price fluctuations, which contribute significantly to its
competitiveness gap with the United States: Gas retail and wholesale
prices are currently three to five times higher than in the United
States, while electricity retail prices are two to three times higher.

[Instead of pushing Europeans into Beijing's arms out of economic
necessity, the United States should further incentivize smart derisking
from China. This is in Washington's interests, as in the event of a
crisis over Taiwan, the EU's ability to exercise economic statecraft
will be a critical factor in upholding deterrence.]{.underline} In fact,
as the European Council on Foreign Relations argues, "EU sanctions
threats could be game-changing, as Beijing has probably not priced in
such measures."

#### Withdrawal bad causes prolif and emboldens adversaries 

**Bengs 25** \[Brian Bengs of Aberdeen served in the Air Force and the
Navy. Bengs is a retired U.S. Air Force JAG officer, and former Northern
State University professor, "Understanding NATO: American departure from
organization would create very dangerous world. Part 2," 02/03/2025,
https://www.sdstandardnow.com/home/understanding-nato-american-departure-from-organization-would-create-very-dangerous-world\]

[Leaving NATO, however, will have significant national and global
security implications primarily benefiting China, Russia, Iran and North
Korea.]{.underline} As regional powers they oppose the constraints of
the existing rules-based system and U.S. influence in their regions. If
the U.S. steps back from the global community they are the states who
will immediately step forward.

The U.S./European Union (EU) trade and investment relationship is the
largest in the world with over \$1 trillion of annual business and
roughly \$3 trillion of direct U.S. investment while over half of
foreign direct investment in the U.S. comes from Europe. [Leaving NATO
will quickly reduce or eliminate American military capacity in Europe
and by extension our political influence there.]{.underline}

[The economic value of our EU trade/investments may decline
substantially due to increased security risks.]{.underline} NATO was
founded to deter Russian aggression so it is the most obvious concern.
Without U.S.-backed deterrence, history indicates the existential
concerns of EU states, particularly those bordering Russia, are quite
legitimate. Precedents for Russian aggression include Moldova in 1992,
Georgia in 2008, and Ukraine in 2014/2022.

Elon Musk's recent support for the German nationalist party (AfD)
highlights the growing risk of something NATO minimizes --- nationalist
divisions and rivalries among EU states. With nationalist parties
gaining influence in more EU states, the risk of future European armed
conflict increases. To avoid NATO duplication, the EU has little
military structure and no superpower leadership. It is simply less
capable of suppressing the type of militant nationalism that culminated
in World Wars I and II.

In our alliances, deterrence depends upon a credible expectation of a
strong American defense. The U.S. has other defense alliances beyond
NATO to consider such as Japan, South Korea and the Organization of
American States to name a few. [Abandoning NATO will make our non-EU
allies less certain about their own security. A lack of faith will
entice them to consider other more reliable security partners closer to
home. China and Russia will recognize and act upon such
opportunities.]{.underline}

Nuclear weapons are another way to increase security and maximize
deterrence. [The most worrisome consequence of the U.S. leaving NATO is
the increased risk of nuclear weapons proliferation.]{.underline}

With the 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), the nuclear-weapon
states (China, Russia, France, Great Britain, and U.S.) sought to
prevent the spread of nuclear weapons by offering general security
guarantees to non-nuclear-weapon states. NATO is the practical framework
implementing our security guarantees with a "nuclear umbrella" over all
non-nuclear-weapon members to preclude the need for each to have its own
weapons. A similar umbrella extends over our non-NATO allies.

[Russian aggression in Ukraine actively undermines the NPT structure.
Ukraine inherited the third-largest nuclear arsenal in the world when
the Soviet Union dissolved]{.underline}. In a 1994 deal with Russia,
Great Britain, and the U.S. that it now deeply regrets, Ukraine agreed
to renounce nuclear weapons and transfer them to Russia in exchange for
explicit security assurances that Russia is violating. In the face of a
military fiasco, Russian President Vladimir Putin is also making
recurring nuclear threats.

If nuclear-weapon states adopt a purely "might makes right" approach by
invading non-nuclear-weapon neighbors without consequences or
threatening to invade Greenland and Panama[, the NPT system is
worthless.]{.underline} Non-nuclear-weapon states lacking a trustworthy
nuclear-weapon state ally will quickly realize nuclear weapons are a
highly effective deterrent to both nuclear and conventional attack.

[In sum, American withdrawal from NATO will cost taxpayers more unless
withdrawal coincides with a significantly reduced defense budget. NATO
withdrawal coupled with increased military spending will result in more
taxpayer debt for a less-stable world with diminished U.S. political
influence from fewer friends but a much greater risk of nuclear
conflict.]{.underline}

## NATO bad 

### NATO Bad\-\--Russia

#### U.S./NATO involvement in the Baltics emboldens russia 

**Carpenter 22** \[Ted Galen Carpenter was a senior fellow for defense
and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, "NATO Security
Dependents Are Not Useful Allies," 01/08/2022,
https://www.cato.org/commentary/nato-security-dependents-are-not-useful-allies\]

The addition of the Baltic republics in 2004 was the most dangerous step
in that process. As in the case of the subsequent addition of the small
Balkan nations to NATO, the three Baltic countries have little to offer
in terms of military capabilities. Estonia's 6,700 troops, Latvia's
5,500, and even Lithuania's 20,500 wouldn't be much of a factor if war
broke out between NATO and Russia.

[However, [the drawbacks of making]{.mark} the [Baltic republics U.S.
security dependents]{.mark} go far beyond their irrelevance as military
players]{.underline}. Those three countries were once part of both
Tsarist Russia and the Soviet Union, and substantial ethnic Russian
minorities still live in both Estonia and Latvia. [T[he Kremlin
has]{.underline}]{.mark} [[complained on **numerous occasions**]{.mark}
since the Baltic republics became independent at the end of 1991 that
the Russian population suffers discrimination and other
mistreatment]{.underline}. Indeed, that allegation emerged long before
Russian president Vladimir Putin became Russia's leader. [[Relations
between the Kremlin and]{.mark} its [former territories **remain
tense**]{.mark} because of that issue.]{.underline}

Perhaps even more troubling, [Washington's [Baltic allies]{.mark} now
are [feudi]{.mark}ng [with]{.mark} Moscow's principal client in the
region, [Belarus]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the summer and autumn of 2021,
Latvia and Lithuania (along with the European Union) accused Belarus of
trying to use a flood of Middle East refugees as a form of "hybrid
warfare." The Lithuanian government even told its border guards to use
force if necessary to prevent the continued entry of the migrants. A
short time later, Latvia imposed a state of emergency to deal with the
same issue. A few weeks earlier, Lithuania had augmented its border
barrier by erecting a fence with razor wire. Latvia soon followed suit.
A new round of large-scale, Russia-Belarus military exercises (held
every four years) in September made tensions even more acute.

By virtue of both size and location, [[the]{.mark} Baltic [republics are
**not credible strategic assets** for the U]{.mark}nited
[St]{.mark}ates. Indeed, [they would be]{.mark} **virtually
[helpless]{.mark}** [if Russia made a military move against
them]{.mark}]{.underline}. A 2016 RAND Corporation study concluded that
[a Russian offensive would overrun their defenses in approximately three
days. [Such countries]{.mark} [are not U.S. "allies" in any]{.mark}
meaningful [sense]{.mark}; [they are **vulnerable dependents**]{.mark}
[that could]{.mark} **trigger a war** [between]{.mark} NATO (primarily
[the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates) [and
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Washington's patron-client relationship with the Baltic republics is
risky, and U.S. leaders were unwise to push for their inclusion in NATO.
However, beginning with George W. Bush's administration, officials have
engaged in even more reckless conduct regarding possible alliance
membership for two other countries, Georgia and Ukraine. They have done
so despite repeated warnings from the Kremlin that making either country
(especially Ukraine) a NATO member would cross a red line that Moscow
cannot tolerate.

#### U.S. backed NATO expansion triggered Russian aggression in Ukraine \-\-- makes future conflict inevitable absent withdrawal 

**Switzer 24** \[Tom Switzer is executive director of the Centre for
Independent Studies, "Why NATO Expansion Explains Russia's Actions in
Ukraine,"07/26/2024,
https://www.internationalaffairs.org.au/australianoutlook/why-nato-expansion-explains-russias-actions-in-ukraine/\]

[[The]{.mark} Kremlin's [decision]{.mark} [to invade Ukraine]{.mark} has
been [primarily driven by the threat of NATO's expansion]{.mark} along
Russia's border]{.underline}. Its strategic objective is to annex some
Ukrainian territory and badly weaken the country so it cannot join NATO.

Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, a chorus of government officials,
academics, commentators, and retired bureaucrats and diplomats has
dismissed all links between the crisis and the decades-long NATO
expansion. Moscow's aggression, we are told, is all about Vladimir
Putin's imperial impulse---his desire to recreate the Russian empire.

[In reality, [the Kremlin's conduct has been]{.mark} primarily [driven
by the **threat of NATO's expansion**]{.mark} along Russia's
border.]{.underline} We had some warning of Russia's strategic
sensibilities three decades ago.

During the 1990's debate over whether Hungary, Poland, and the Czech
Republic should become alliance members, many military and
foreign-policy experts argued that NATO expansion would lead to big
trouble with Russia. It would create the very danger it was supposed to
prevent: Russian aggression in reaction to what Moscow would deem a
provocative and threatening Western policy.

The list of opponents to NATO enlargement from three decades ago reads
like a who's who of that generation's wise men. It included architects
of the Cold War containment doctrine, senior defence and intelligence
officials from the Nixon-Carter-Reagan eras, former ambassadors and
senior diplomats to Moscow (Arthur Hartman, Jack F. Matlock, and Robert
Bowie) former Australian prime ministers Malcolm Fraser and Paul
Keating, leading political scientists such as a Ronald Steel, prominent
magazine editors (Owen Harries, Charles Maynes) and, not least,
distinguished historians such as Robert Conquest, Richard Pipes, John
Lewis Gaddis, and Britain's foremost military intellectual Sir Michael
Howard.

Officials in the state and defence departments also rejected NATO plans
to expand eastwards, including the Polish-born chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff General John Shalikashvili and US Defense Secretary Les
Aspin, as well as his successor William Perry, who considered
resignation in late 1994 when the policy proposal moved forward. Former
defense secretaries Robert McNamara and James Schlesinger aired their
concerns that NATO enlargement would decrease allied security and
unsettle European stability.

In the lead up to the Senate's ratification in 1998, the New York Times
editorial board warned: "The most important foreign policy decision
America has faced since the end of the Cold War... could prove to be a
mistake of historic proportions." And this: "[It is [**delusional** to
believe]{.mark} that [NATO expansion is not]{.mark} at its core [an
act]{.mark} that [Russia will regard as hostile]{.mark}.]{.underline}"

George Kennan---intellectual architect of the Cold War containment
doctrine, a former ambassador to the USSR, and one of America's wisest
students of Russian affairs---spoke for the many dissenters in 1997 when
he warned that NATO expansion "would be the most fateful error of
American policy in the entire post-Cold War era."

It would weaken Russian reformers, embolden hard-liners, undermine
strategic arms agreements, and escalate East-West tensions when Russia
got back on its feet and began acting like a great power.

In the 1990s, Russia was no threat to the West and incapable of serious
military action. But "if humiliated further and made desperate," as then
National Interest editor Owen Harries warned in 1996, "it could be
dangerous in a way that a wounded animal can be dangerous." In such
circumstances, providing "extreme chauvinistic elements in Russia to
exploit frustrations, resentments and wounded national pride... would
have unpleasant consequences both internally and internationally."

Harries---a conservative academic at the universities of Sydney
(1956-66) and New South Wales (1966-74), and an Australian
diplomat-policymaker with impressive credentials as a Cold
Warrior---argued: "Expanding NATO violates the wise principle enunciated
by Winston Churchill: 'In victory, magnanimity.' Churchill was no softy,
but he recognized the stupidity of grinding the face of a defeated foe
in the dirt."

In a widely quoted essay in the US Foreign Affairs magazine as early as
1993, Harries [warned of the perils of [any proposal to intrude US
military power into Russia's sphere]{.mark} of influence. It would not
just greatly annoy the Russians, but it [would have little credibility,
create splits]{.mark} within the alliance, [and require **much in
blood**]{.mark} and treasure.]{.underline}

Other prominent Australians, most notably Harries' former boss Malcolm
Fraser as well as another prime minister, Paul Keating, also warned that
extending western security commitments eastwards would provoke the bear.

In 1997, Keating delivered a lecture at UNSW warning: "To move Europe's
military demarcation point to the very borders of the former Soviet
Union is, I believe, an error which may rank in the end with the
strategic miscalculations which prevented Germany from taking its full
place in the international system at the beginning of this century."

Opponents also drew attention to the US and German assurances given
Moscow during the early 1990s that if Russia withdrew from their Warsaw
Pact and accepted German unification, NATO would not move "one inch
eastwards." According to Kennan in 1998: "We did not, I am sure, intend
to trick the Russians, but the actual determinants of our later
behavior... would scarcely have been more creditable on our part than a
real intention to deceive."

Shortly after the Senate ratified the first tranche of enlargement
(Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland) in April 1998, Kennan told Thomas
Friedman: "I think it is the beginning of new Cold War... Of course,
there is going to be a bad reaction from Russia, and then \[the NATO
expanders\] will say we always told you that is how the Russians are --
but this is just wrong."

This history serves to highlight the extent to which many distinguished
military and foreign-policy experts raised strong objections to moving
NATO into Russia's backyard. Their warnings about poking at the bear
proved prescient. And yet, as they consistently warned about a
near-certain confrontation with post-Yeltsin Russia, it's important to
note that the opponents of NATO expansion in the 1990s were never
dismissed as Kremlin apologists or Russia's "useful idiots." Nor were
they treated as if their views were outside the boundaries of serious
public discourse.

However, the intellectual climate is very different today. If
anyone---including prominent scholars like John Mearsheimer and Jeffrey
Sachs---blames NATO expansion for the Ukraine crisis, they instantly
arouse anger and suspicion about their motives. Although they are
popular on social media, today's critics of NATO enlargement are
virtually ignored across mainstream media outlets and their intentions
are all too often impugned. Never mind that they are effectively
reaffirming the entirely legitimate criticisms that Kennan, Harries, the
New York Times, and others raised a generation earlier.

What's changed in three decades? Why are today's opponents of NATO
expansion treated with contempt and derision?

The answer lies in understanding the power of groupthink. People,
including politicians and policymakers, increasingly indulge in what
Harries called the "parochialism of the present"---a tendency to believe
that what is happening to us now must be of unprecedented significance.

After all, Ukraine is the first major war in Europe since World War Two
and Russia was clearly the aggressor. Moreover, there is a history of
revanchist attitudes in Moscow and Putin's thuggish and autocratic
persona helps confirm the widespread view in the West that Russia took
up arms exclusively because of its imperialistic ambitions, not because
of anything the United States and its allies did, including NATO
expansion.

[Although the Western conventional wisdom insists that Russia is
inherently and incorrigibly expansionist, the Russian armed forces lack
the military power to conquer Ukraine, much less countries in the
erstwhile Warsaw Pact]{.underline}. A Russia having its work cut out for
itself in Donbas is no threat to Europe. Nor has Putin ever expressed
interest in making all of Ukraine part of Russia, much less
reconstituting the Russian empire. His strategic objectives appear more
limited: he wants to annex some Ukrainian territory and badly weaken
that country, so it is in no position to join NATO.

[Moreover, as the critics warned in the 1990s, [it was **inevitable**
that Russia]{.mark}, with an improving economy thanks to its oil and gas
resources, [would eventually push back at a US-dominated military
alliance]{.mark} encroaching on its border]{.underline}s. That is
precisely what happened in Georgia (2008), Crimea (2014), and Ukraine
(2022).

The cold reality is that we are facing the prospect of a frozen conflict
coupled with Russia annexing even more Ukrainian territory, leaving
Ukraine as a broken rump state. [This is a tragedy for sure, but it
almost certainly could have been avoided if US leaders had heeded the
warnings of the many wise opponents of [NATO]{.mark}
expansion]{.underline} during the 1990s.

### NATO Bad\-\--RCA 

\*this could potentially be an RCA scenario\*

#### NATO prolongs conflict and turns China towards cooperation with Russia

**Prashad 24** \[Vijay Prashad is a writing fellow and chief
correspondent at Globetrotter, "NATO accelerates its conflict with
China," 07/19/2024,
https://peoplesdispatch.org/2024/07/19/nato-accelerates-its-conflict-with-china/\]

At the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) summit in Washington,
the focus was on Ukraine. In the Washington Declaration, the NATO
leaders wrote, "Ukraine's future is in NATO." Ukraine formally applied
to join NATO in September 2022, but soon found that despite widespread
NATO support, several member states (such as Hungary) were uneasy with
escalating a conflict with Russia. As early as NATO's 2008 Bucharest
Summit, the members welcomed "Ukraine's and Georgia's Euro-Atlantic
aspirations for membership in NATO. We agreed today that these countries
will become members of NATO." However, the NATO council hesitated
because of the border dispute with Russia; if Ukraine had been hastily
brought into NATO and if the border dispute escalated (as it did), then
NATO would be dragged into a direct war against Russia.

[Over the last decade, [NATO has expanded]{.mark} its military presence
[along Russia's borders]{.mark}.]{.underline} At the NATO summit in
Wales (September 2014), NATO implemented its Readiness Action Plan
(RAP). This RAP was designed to increase NATO's military forces in
Eastern Europe "from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Black Sea in the
south." Two years later, in Warsaw, NATO decided to develop an enhanced
Forward Presence (eFP) in the Baltic Sea area with "battlegroups
stationed in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland." The distance
between Moscow and the border regions of Estonia and Latvia is a mere
780 kilometers, which is well within the range of a short-range
ballistic missile (1,000 kilometers). In response to the NATO build-up,
Belarus and Russia conducted Zapad 2017, the largest military exercise
by these countries since 1991. Reasonable people at that time would have
thought that de-escalation should have become the priority on all sides.
But it was not.

Provocations from the NATO member states continued. [[After Russia
invaded Ukraine]{.mark} in 2022, the [NATO]{.mark} [countries]{.mark}
settled on a course of fully [backing Ukraine]{.mark} and
[prevent]{.mark}ing **any [negotiations]{.mark}** [toward a peaceful
settlement]{.mark} of the dispute. The United States and its
[NATO]{.mark} allies [sent arms and equipment to Ukraine]{.mark},
[with]{.mark} US high [military officials making **provocative
statements** about their war aims]{.mark}]{.underline} (to "weaken
Russia," for instance). [[Ukrainian discussions]{.mark} with Russian
officials in Belarus and Turkey [were set aside by NATO,]{.mark} [and
**Ukraine's**]{.mark} **own [war aim]{.mark}**]{.underline} (merely for
Russian forces to withdraw) [[was **ignored**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Instead, NATO countries spent billions of dollars on weapons and watched
on the sidelines as Ukrainian soldiers died in a futile war. On the
sidelines of the NATO summit in Washington, Royal Netherlands Navy
Admiral Rob Bauer, who is the chair of NATO's Military Committee, told
Foreign Policy, "The Ukrainians need more to win than just what we have
set up." [In other words, [the NATO states provide Ukraine with]{.mark}
just [enough]{.mark} weapons [to continue the conflict, but not to
**change the situation**]{.mark} on the ground (either by a victory or a
defeat).]{.underline} The NATO states, it seems, want to use Ukraine to
bleed Russia.

Blame China

[[NATO's]{.mark} Washington [Declaration]{.mark}]{.underline} contains a
section that is puzzling. [It [says that China "has become a]{.mark}
**decisive [enabler of]{.mark}** [Russia's war against
Ukraine]{.mark}."]{.underline} The term "decisive enabler" has attracted
significant attention within China, where the government immediately
condemned NATO's characterization of the war in Ukraine. China's Foreign
Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said that [NATO's [statement "is
ill-motivated and makes no sense]{.mark}]{.underline}." Shortly after
Russian troops entered Ukraine, China's Wang Wenbin of the Foreign
Ministry said that "all countries' sovereignty and territorial integrity
should be respected and upheld." This is precisely the opposite of
cheerleading for the war, and since then China has put forward peace
proposals to end the war[. [Accusations that China has supplied Russia
with]{.mark} "lethal [aid]{.mark}" **[have not been
substantiated]{.mark}** by the NATO countries, and have been denied by
China.]{.underline}

Lin Jian asked two key questions at the July 11, 2024, press conference
in Beijing: "Who exactly is fueling the flames? Who exactly is
'enabling' the conflict?". The answer is clear since it is
[[NATO]{.mark} that **[rejects any peace negotiations]{.mark}**, NATO
countries that are arming Ukraine to prolong the war, [and]{.mark} NATO
[leaders]{.mark} who [want to expan]{.mark}d NATO [eastwards and
deny]{.mark} Russia's plea for [a new security
architecture]{.mark}]{.underline} (all of this is demonstrated by German
parliamentarian Sevim Dağdelen in her new book on NATO's 75-year
history). When Hungary's Viktor Orban---whose country holds the
six-month presidency of the European Union---went to both Russia and
Ukraine to talk about a peace process, it was the European states that
condemned this mission. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European
Commission, responded with a harsh rebuke of Orban, writing that
"Appeasement will not stop Putin." Alongside such comments come further
promises by the Europeans and the North Americans to provide Ukraine
with funds and weapons for the war. Strikingly, the new NATO Secretary
General Mark Rutte even allowed Ukraine to use an F-16 jet from the
Netherlands given to Ukraine when Rutte was the prime minister of that
country to strike Russian soil. That would mean that weapons from a NATO
country would be used directly to attack Russia, which would allow
Russia to strike back at a NATO state.

[[NATO's statement]{.mark} that [characterizes China as a]{.mark}

Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said in a press conference, that NATO
must "continue to strengthen our partnerships, especially in the
Indo-Pacific." These Indo-Pacific Partners are Australia, Japan, New
Zealand, and South Korea. Interestingly, the largest trading partner of
three of these countries is not the United States, but China (Japan is
the outlier). Even the analysts of the US Federal Reserve Bank have
concluded that "a delinking of global production processes and
consumption from China is not in sight." Despite this, these countries
have recklessly increased the pressure against China (including New
Zealand, which is now eager to join Pillar II of the AUKUS Treaty among
Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom). [NATO has said
that it remains open to "constructive engagement" with China, but there
is no sign of such a development.]{.underline}

#### NATO expansion provokes global conflict -- it extends U.S. dominance while increasingly antagonizing Russia and China.

The previous summit held in 1997 was the culmination of a long debate
among NATO member governments about the alliance's eastward enlargement.
The debate became public and heated in the United States, involving
almost all the country's foreign policy establishment. It pitted those
who warned against ostracizing Russia---which in their view was how any
expansion of NATO to countries that were previously subordinate to
Moscow would inevitably be perceived by the Russians---against those who
were eager to seize the opportunity offered by what *Washington
Post* columnist Charles Krauthammer had called in 1990 "the unipolar
moment," in order to extend US hegemony to areas that were formerly part
of the Soviet sphere.

The latter position was shared by most of the Clinton administration,
inspired from behind the scenes by Zbigniew Brzezinski. The opposite
stance was represented within the administration by Defense Secretary
William Perry during Bill Clinton's first mandate. Perry was ousted from
the administration and very tellingly replaced by the Republican William
Cohen for Clinton's second term, the year when the Madrid summit was
held.

Supporters of NATO's eastward expansion wanted the US empire to
encompass a large chunk of the former Soviet empire in the belief that,
sooner or later, post-communist Russia would seek to revive its long
imperial tradition. It was therefore necessary to preempt this
inevitable development by securing US control of as much of the former
Soviet empire as possible. Since Putin's regime has indeed engaged in
predatory behavior since 2008 in what has traditionally been regarded by
Russia as its imperial "near abroad"---intervention in Georgia in 2008,
annexation of Crimea and intervention in Donbas in 2014, attempted
invasion for "regime change" in Ukraine in 2022, and ongoing efforts to
occupy the whole of Donbas and adjacent areas---one would be tempted to
believe that those who advocated NATO's enlargement have been proven
right.

The truth is, however, that this outcome is precisely what those who
opposed the enlargement had cautioned against. [They rightly predicted
that the [Russians]{.mark} would [see NATO's eastward expansion
as]{.mark} a **[hostile]{.mark}** gesture and that it would therefore
[breed revanchist attitudes among them]{.mark}.]{.underline} In other
words, they warned that [[enlarging NATO]{.mark} in preemption of
Russia's return to imperial behavior would actually act as a
[self-fulfilling prophecy]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The 1997 summit officially invited Hungary, Poland, and the Czech
Republic to join the alliance. The three Eastern European countries'
accession was completed two years later at the Washington summit that
celebrated NATO's 50th anniversary. It happened at a time when the
alliance was bombing Yugoslavia in contravention of international law,
in the first post-1990 US-led war not authorized by the United Nations
Security Council.

[Along with the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 that circumvented yet
again the UNSC, and [NATO's]{.mark} subsequent enlargement in 2004 to
seven more East European countries, including the three Baltic states,
which were formerly part of the USSR, this sequence of events was
decisive in [creat]{.mark}ing the [animosity between Russia and the West
that was a prelude to the invasion of Ukraine.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The forthcoming summit in Madrid will be the occasion of a major
qualitative leap in the definition of NATO's raison d'être, no less
consequential than the 1997 summit. [This is not an allusion to the
formal invitation of [Finland and Sweden]{.mark} to [join]{.mark} the
[alliance]{.mark}, although this development is certainly very
significant, more so perhaps than all previous rounds of enlargement,
because it will [considerably lengthen NATO's direct border with
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} (Finland's border with Russia is 1,340
kilometers long). On this issue, the only question mark is Turkey's
position, since any new membership offer must be unanimously approved by
all existing NATO members, a principle that grants each one of them an
actual veto right. Ankara wants the two Nordic states to take measures
against the Kurdish movement, strongly represented among refugees in
both countries.

But the most dangerous novelty at the Madrid summit consists of a major
qualitative extension of NATO's purpose. Originally founded as a
defensive alliance against the Soviet Union and its subordinate states,
NATO has mutated after 1991 into a "security organization"---meaning
that it has been involved in military actions (NATO as such did not
formally engage in any war in the USSR's days)---and redefined its
purpose in ostracizing post-Soviet Russia by expanding toward its
borders. The NATO-Russia Council created in 1997 was a meager
consolation given to Moscow in lieu of inviting it to join the alliance.
Nobody was fooled. [From tacit, [NATO's hostility to Russia became
explicit after the annexation of Crimea in 2014.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The forthcoming [Madrid summit]{.mark} is going to directly [involve
NATO in open hostility to China]{.mark}, far beyond the alliance's
original area of relevance.]{.underline} This area is defined in the
1949 treaty constitutive of NATO as comprising "the territory of any of
the Parties in Europe or North America, on the Algerian Departments of
France, on the territory of or on the Islands under the jurisdiction of
any of the Parties in the North Atlantic area north of the Tropic of
Cancer." NATO's post-1991 mutation led it to intervene beyond its
members' territory---first in the Balkans, then much further from its
original area, in Afghanistan, in the wake of the September 11, 2001,
attacks.

Participation in the organization's meetings has nevertheless remained
restricted to Europe and North America. No longer. Japan, along with
Australia, New Zealand and South Korea have been invited to attend the
Madrid summit as NATO "partners" in the Asia-Pacific region---a very
serious provocation to Beijing. It can only interpret this invitation as
a step toward the consolidation of US-led alliances in a single global
network opposed to both Russia and China. After the preliminary meeting
of NATO's defense ministers held on June 16, the organization's
secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, declared that the new NATO
Strategic Concept that will be adopted at the Madrid summit will set out
the alliance's position "on Russia, on emerging challenges, and for the
first time, on China."

[From the perspective of Washington's drive to perpetuate its hegemony
over most of Europe and the Asia Pacific by portraying Russia and China
as enemies---a grand strategy that has been followed by all successive
post-1991 US administrations---the [new escalation]{.mark} to be
confirmed [in Madrid **makes full sense**]{.mark}.]{.underline} While
resolutely supporting Ukraine's resistance to the Russian invasion,
President Biden has multiplied provocative gestures toward Beijing,
including his statement, prior to a summit meeting in May of the
anti-China alliance known as the Quad (Japan, Australia, and India along
with the United States), that the United States would defend Taiwan
militarily. The statement was quickly watered down by the State
Department, which had in May removed from a Taiwan Fact Sheet on its
website the statement "we do not support Taiwan independence" and
reinstated it in June.

[[From the perspective of Europe and the Asia Pacific]{.mark},
[acquiescing]{.mark} [to]{.mark} this de facto [extension of NATO's
role]{.mark} is [equivalent to being herded]{.mark} like Panurge's sheep
toward throwing themselves into the sea. [Antagonizing China]{.mark} is
[not in Europe's interest]{.mark}, nor is it in the interest of any of
the states invited to the Madrid summit. Even if the European
governments believed that Russia has now irreversibly become a threat to
their security, it would be [utterly counterproductive for them to push
Beijing toward consolidating an alliance with
Moscow.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[These [developments]{.mark} bring the world closer to a conflagration
that could dwarf the ongoing war in Ukraine and **[endanger the future
of humankind]{.mark}**.]{.underline} It is urgent to rebuild a global
peace movement opposed to all military alliances, demanding their
dissolution, a movement opposed as well to the ongoing massive increases
in military budgets. It is high time to return to global disarmament
under the aegis of the UN, as foreseen in the UN Charter. This charter
is the cornerstone of international law whose role must be renewed
against the ongoing drift toward the law of the jungle. The huge and
ever-growing amounts that are spent on armament and destruction would be
wisely reallocated to the only wars that are truly in humanity's
interest: the wars against poverty and climate change.

#### NATO enlargement worsens relations with Russia by provoking its security fears, empowering hardliners, and prioritizing military expansion over diplomatic engagement.

Unit of Analysis in the Assessment of NATO Enlargement, Qualitative
Analysis

[In 1997, 50 [security experts expressed]{.mark} a [negative view on
enlargement]{.mark} by [referring to its impact on Russia]{.mark}'s
domestic development, relations between Russia and the West,
[and]{.mark} the [risk of U.S. entrapment]{.mark} when countries with
existing disputes are emboldened by U.S. security
guarantees]{.underline} (Arms Control Association 1997). Although
restraining NATO from further expansion would limit the power and
ability of the organization to deter Russia, the 50 experts felt that
the benefits of restraint would outweigh these limitations. Behind the
concerns lie premises according to which our focus should be on Russia's
relationship with the West rather than its characteristics (Arms Control
Association 1997, 1).514 T. KIVIMÄKI

These concerns presented in 1997 are still central in the arguments in
the Foreign Affairs 2022 depository of arguments against NATO expansion,
and they often clearly represent a relational premise in the analysis of
international relations: [Russia's interests can only be understood in
the context of its relations with other countries, in particular member
countries of NATO.]{.underline} The focus on Russian defensive interests
in a broader structural context is clear in Arbatova's analysis of the
effects of what Russia has interpreted as the failure of the West to
keep its promises not to expand the defensive alliance: '[[Western
neglect of Russia's security concerns]{.mark} has [convinced the Kremlin
that words]{.mark} -- be it Putin's Munich speech (2007) or Medvedev's
draft of a European security treaty (2010) --will [never]{.mark} have
any [impact]{.mark} on [Western strategy]{.mark}. It is [only **hard
power**]{.mark} that matters']{.underline} (Arbatova 2022, 1).
Consequently, Russian aggression isa function of relational problems to
which Western actions also contributed: '[[NATO]{.mark} expansion helped
[increase tensions with Russia]{.mark} and perpetuate a zero-sum
approach to European security that has [worsened the alliance's
immediate security environment]{.mark} and [contributed to today's
conflict in Ukraine']{.mark}]{.underline} (Ashford 2022, 1).

These premises are strongly challenged by some of the historians and
specialists in Russian international policies, who refer to relatively
stable Russian geopolitical interests (Götz 2015), the historical
patterns of Russian action (Braun 2008), and the nature of the Russian
political system and its leaders (Kuzio 2016). According to Sarotte,
Russia had assumed that it had the right to rule Eastern Europe because
it considered itself the winner of the Second World War (Sarotte 2021,
Chapter 1). NATO deterrence has affected this calculus by
disincentivizing Russian willingness to rule Eastern Europe.
Consequently, Russia has not occupied any Eastern European NATO
country(Sarotte 2014, 2021)

Agent-centric analysis assumes that the drivers of action relate to the
identity of the agent: 'Putin's threats against Sweden and Finland, coup
attempt against Montenegro, attack on Georgia, and two invasions of
Ukraine show that he feels entitled to dominate and use violence against
other countries. Each of the countries that joined NATO after the Cold
War feels safer and protected from Russia's aggression' (Benitez 2022,
1).

It is easy to see how these different ideas of the unit of analysis push
policy conclusions in two different directions. If Russia is a
permanently geopolitically oriented and expansive actor, it needs to be
contained, not appeased. Hostility is inherent in Russian identity.
Domestic polity may also be the agent-centric driver of behavior. Russia
might become hostile if it becomes more autocratic, nationalistic, or
again communist, and thus NATO needs to have the ability to contain the
country.3

However[, if Russian action is a function of the relationship, we can
expect aggressive policies only if NATO member countries give Russia a
security GEOPOLITICS 515reason for such aggression]{.underline}. Thus,
as Kuchan claims: 'It was a cardinal error to expand NATO and proceed
with the construction of a post -- Cold War security order that amassed
Western power against Russia. Strategic prudence mandated that Russia
engage in balancing behavior\[u\]r' (Kupchan 2022, 1).Therefore[, [to
avoid an aggressive Russia, NATO must find ways of engaging Russia in
positive interaction.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Analysis that focuses on the identities of agents rather than focusing
on the nature of the relationship, sometimes separates victims and
perpetrators and assumes the need to contain the latter for the
protection of the former. For a relational analysis such is not possible
given that violence is seen as a relational issue, not something that is
caused by the agency of perpetrators. Cosmopolitan morality, which is
clearly agent-centric, has often posited non-partisan neutrality as
immoral; an idea that was most clearly articulated by Mary Kaldor, who
stated that 'cosmopolitan law enforcement has to be done impartially, in
the sense that no nation or group is being favored, but not neutrally'
since security requires only the weakening and stopping of the
perpetrator of violence, not the victim of perpetrators atrocities
(Kaldor 2012, 128). The argument in favor of NATO enlargement is thus no
longer power political or geopolitical, made by militarists or
strategists; it is instead an argument for cosmopolitan, liberal
interventionism. Actors like Russia need to be opposed by overwhelming
force to secure Europe, something that Russia's defiance challenges.
This theoretical position tends to demonize Russia. Goldgeier,for
example, claims that Putin simply wants to kill civilians
indiscriminately: '\[D\]on't blame NATO enlargement for Putin's desires
to destroy Ukraine's existence as an independent country and his
willingness to kill civilians indiscriminately, as he did previously in
Grozny and Aleppo, two cities that had nothing to do with NATO or its
enlargement' (Goldgeier2022, 1). In contemporary debates about NATO,
demonization and a reliance on overwhelming force are viewed as a
liberal, not a realist, argument. Order and peace need to be fought for,
and the challenges that they face are defiant actors like Russia, not
poor relations between equally violent actors. Force is no longer a
morally neutral means in world politics; rather, it is needed for moral
objectives and the enforcement of moral cosmopolitan norms.

Relationists, however, opine that, in politics and conflict, poor
relations, not predatory agents, are the core problem. There are no
clear perpetrators and victims in a conflict; rather, both sides suffer
at the same time as they behave in hostile and violent ways. Instead of
demonizing Russia, this theoretical position commonly emphasizes the
need to avoid humiliation. Empowering Russian positive contexts would
work for peace and European unity and cooperation. According to Duss:
['Expanding NATO was not necessarily a mistake, but it does seem clear,
as a number of U.S. and Russian security officials warned]{.underline}
at516 T. KIVIMÄKIthe time, that it was done in such a way that was
perceived as provocative by Russia. Much more should have been done
sooner to address those negative perceptions' (Duss 2022, 1). While this
position is often rejected as soft and naive by agent-centric analysts[,
[many relationists view the demonizing dis-course as **militaristic and
unrealistic**]{.mark}]{.underline} (H. A. Kissinger 2014a;
Mearsheimer2015, 2019)".

[[Officials]{.mark} in the state and defence departments also [rejected
NATO plans to expand eastwards]{.mark},]{.underline} including the
Polish-born chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General John
Shalikashvili and US Defense Secretary Les Aspin, as well as his
successor William Perry,
who [considered](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/09/russian-hostility-to-west-partly-caused-by-west) resignation
in late 1994 when the policy proposal moved forward. Former defense
secretaries Robert McNamara and James Schlesinger aired their concerns
that NATO enlargement would decrease allied security and unsettle
European stability.

In the lead up to the Senate's ratification in 1998, the *New York
Times* editorial
board [warned](https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/24/opinion/the-senate-s-duty-on-nato.html):
["The most important foreign policy decision America has faced since the
end of the Cold War...  could prove to be a mistake of historic
proportions."
And [this](https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/29/opinion/nato-and-the-lessons-of-history.html):
"It is delusional to believe that [NATO expansion]{.mark} is not at its
core [an act that Russia will regard as hostile."]{.mark}]{.underline}

[George Kennan]{.underline}---intellectual architect of the Cold War
containment doctrine, a former ambassador to the USSR, and one of
America's wisest students of Russian affairs---spoke for the many
dissenters in 1997 when
he [[warned](https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/05/opinion/a-fateful-error.html) that
[NATO expansion]{.mark} "would be the most [fateful error of American
policy]{.mark} in the entire post-Cold War era."]{.underline}

[It would [weaken Russian reformers, embolden hard-liners, undermine
strategic arms agreements, and escalate East-West tensions]{.mark} when
Russia got back on its feet and began acting like a great
power.]{.underline}

In the 1990s, Russia was no threat to the West and incapable of serious
military action. But ["if humiliated further and made
desperate,"]{.underline} as then *National Interest* editor Owen Harries
warned in 1996, ["it could be dangerous in a way that a wounded animal
can be dangerous."]{.underline} In such circumstances, [providing
"extreme chauvinistic elements in Russia to exploit frustrations,
resentments and wounded national pride... would have unpleasant
consequences both internally and internationally."]{.underline}

Harries---a conservative academic at the universities of Sydney
(1956-66) and New South Wales (1966-74), and an Australian
diplomat-policymaker with impressive credentials as a Cold
Warrior---argued: "Expanding NATO violates the wise principle enunciated
by Winston Churchill: 'In victory, magnanimity.' Churchill was no softy,
but he recognized the stupidity of grinding the face of a defeated foe
in the dirt."

In a widely
quoted [essay](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/southeastern-europe/1993-09-01/collapse-west) in
the US *Foreign Affairs* magazine as early as 1993, [Harries warned of
the perils of any proposal to intrude US military power into Russia's
sphere of influence. It would not just greatly [annoy]{.mark} the
[Russians]{.mark}, but it would have [little]{.mark}
[credibility]{.mark}, create [splits within]{.mark} the
[alliance]{.mark}, and [require much in blood and
treasure.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Other prominent Australians, most notably Harries' former boss Malcolm
Fraser as well as another prime minister, Paul Keating, also warned that
extending western security commitments eastwards would provoke the bear.

In 1997, Keating delivered a lecture at
UNSW [warning](http://www.paulkeating.net.au/shop/item/a-prospect-of-europe---4-september-1997):
["To [move Europe's military demarcation point]{.mark} to the very
[borders of]{.mark} the [former Soviet Union is]{.mark}, I believe, an
[error]{.mark} which may rank in the [end with]{.mark} the strategic
[miscalculations]{.mark} which prevented Germany from taking its full
place in the international system at the beginning of this
century."]{.underline}

Opponents also drew attention to the US and
German [assurances](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/russia-programs/2017-12-12/nato-expansion-what-gorbachev-heard-western-leaders-early) given
Moscow during the early 1990s that if Russia withdrew from their Warsaw
Pact and accepted German unification, NATO would not move "one inch
eastwards." [[According to
Kennan](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CREC-1998-03-03/html/CREC-1998-03-03-pt1-PgS1283-3.htm) in
1998: "We did not, I am sure, intend to trick the Russians, but the
actual determinants of our later behavior... would scarcely have been
more creditable on our part than a real intention to
deceive."]{.underline}

Shortly after the Senate ratified the first tranche of enlargement
(Czech Republic, Hungary, and Poland) in April 1998,
Kennan [told](https://www.nytimes.com/1998/05/02/opinion/foreign-affairs-now-a-word-from-x.html) Thomas
Friedman: ["I think it is the [beginning of new **Cold War**]{.mark}...
Of course, there is going to be a bad reaction from Russia, and then
\[the NATO expanders\] will say we always told you that is how the
Russians are -- but this is just wrong."]{.underline}

This history serves to highlight the extent to which many distinguished
military and foreign-policy experts raised strong objections to moving
NATO into Russia's backyard. [Their warnings about poking at the bear
proved prescient.]{.underline} And yet, as they consistently warned
about a near-certain confrontation with post-Yeltsin Russia, it's
important to note that the opponents of NATO expansion in the 1990s were
never dismissed as Kremlin apologists or Russia's "useful idiots." Nor
were they treated as if their views were outside the boundaries of
serious public discourse.

However, the intellectual climate is very different today. If
anyone---including prominent scholars like John Mearsheimer and Jeffrey
Sachs---blames NATO expansion for the Ukraine crisis, they instantly
arouse anger and suspicion about their motives. Although they are
popular on social media, [today's [critics of NATO enlargement]{.mark}
are [virtually ignored across mainstream media outlets and their
intentions are all too often impugne]{.mark}d.]{.underline} Never mind
that they are effectively reaffirming the entirely legitimate criticisms
that Kennan, Harries, *the New York Times*, and others raised a
generation earlier.

Finally, [[enlargement]{.mark} contributed to [worsened relations with
Moscow]{.mark}.]{.underline} There are many reasons that US relations
with Moscow soured over the last three decades, just as there are
multiple drivers of Russia's ongoing aggression in Ukraine that has put
US-Russian relations in a deep freeze. NATO enlargement, however, played
an outsized role. [When enlargement was first entertained in the 1990s,
no less a figure than Russian President Boris Yeltsin warned that
[moving NATO eastward]{.mark} would [violate assurances given against
enlargement]{.mark} made during the 1990 negotiations over German
reunification, empower Russian nationalists, and ultimately
**[reduce]{.mark}** the [prospects for]{.mark} **a [stable post-Cold
War]{.mark}** [peace]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Then-President Clinton believed that Russian opposition could be
variously ignored due to Russian weakness, overcome through engagement,
or transformed through Russian democratization. Still, Russian
opposition was real and pronounced: [in the 1996 Russian election,
Yeltsin's opponents made the then-possibility of NATO enlargement a
centerpiece of their campaigns, and [Yeltsin]{.mark} himself [resisted
enlargement]{.mark} within the limited options available to Moscow at
the time.]{.underline}

[After enlargement began]{.underline}, meanwhile, [both Yeltsin
[and]{.mark} [Putin]{.mark} [underscored]{.mark} that the
[policy]{.mark} challenged Russian interests by [limiti]{.mark}ng
[Russian influence in European security affairs]{.mark}.]{.underline} As
Putin put it in 2007, [enlargement represented "a [serious provocation
that reduces the level of mutual trust]{.mark}."]{.underline} Despite
these concerns, however, enlargement continued -- indeed, with the
Bucharest Summit's decision to promise NATO membership for Ukraine and
Georgia[, it began to [involve]{.mark} areas that,]{.underline} as US
ambassador to Russia Bill Burns warned at the time, [were **"[the

### NATO Bad \-\-- Europe

#### The NATO alliance is making European countries too dependent on the United States, enabling military dependence and distraction.

[Europe is rich and strong enough to defend itself. But the Europeans
won't do so unless the United States stops doing it for
them.]{.underline}

Some of us might argue that lubricating U.S. operations in the greater
Middle East after 9/11 was a bad thing---given that the missions
themselves were mostly bad. The United States squandered [\$8
trillion](https://www.brown.edu/news/2021-09-01/costsofwar), thousands
of lives, and almost two decades of attention in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Anything that made that easier should be tallied as a debit, not a
credit.

But there's a bigger problem. [[NATO]{.mark} isn't about pandemic
response or anti-piracy. It [has no capabilities, no authority, and no
fitne]{.mark}ss for these purposes. NATO is an [old-fashioned military
alliance]{.mark}. However big a problem [migration or
disinformation]{.mark} may be, the [alliance]{.mark} wasn't designed and
still [isn't]{.mark} tailored [for dealing with
them.]{.mark}]{.underline}

These problems aren't just missing from the [North Atlantic
Treaty](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_17120.htm);
they appear only as marketing in more recent official documents,
including NATO's just-issued [Strategic
Concept](https://www.nato.int/strategic-concept/). [NATO is sold---and
sells itself---as many things, but it is, by treaty and by the structure
of its bureaucracy, a military alliance dedicated to the security of its
members.]{.underline}

Given NATO's origins as a military alliance aimed at deterring Soviet
aggression, we should ask ourselves: With [the Soviets out and the
Germans
down](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/declassified_137930.htm), why
did the United States struggle so mightily to stay in after the Cold
War? The answer is simple: [NATO is, and always has been, a vehicle for
maintaining the United States as the dominant security player in
Europe.]{.underline} That there were [sharper
disagreements](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09636419908429385) about
this idea in the 1950s than there are today speaks volumes about
the [lack of
debate](https://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/articles/ssq_1216_friedman.pdf) in
today's Washington.

[Even the [Rand Corp.
report](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monographs/2012/RAND_MG1244.pdf) that
McInnis cites in support of the idea of "defense in depth" in Europe
remarks that U.S. leaders only adopted the concept grudgingly out of
fear that "U.S. allies were too weak to contain the Soviet Union on
their own." As that report observes, the four divisions Congress agreed
to send to Germany in 1950 "were not intended to remain there
indefinitely; instead, the U.S. troops were to be withdrawn when Western
Europe had recovered sufficiently to field its own conventional
deterrent."]{.underline}

Western Europe had recovered sufficiently to field its own conventional
deterrent less than a decade later. By 1959, a memo described U.S.
President Dwight D. Eisenhower
as [lamenting](https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1958-60v07p1/d226):
"The Europeans now attempt to consider this deployment as a permanent
and definite commitment. [We are [carrying]{.mark} practically the
[whole weight of the strategic deterrent force]{.mark}, also [conducting
space activities, and atomic programs]{.mark}. We [paid]{.mark} for most
of the [infrastructure]{.mark}, and maintain [large air and naval
forces]{.mark} as well as six divisions. He thinks the
[Europeans]{.mark} are close to '[making a sucker out of Uncle
Sam]{.mark}'; so long as they could prove a need for emergency help,
that was one thing. But that time has passed."]{.underline}

[Does the United States need to remain the main provider of security in
Europe forever? Recent developments in Europe, spurred by Russia's
invasion of Ukraine, suggest it doesn't]{.underline}.
Germany's [*Zeitenwende*](https://www.aicgs.org/publication/the-zeitenwende-germanys-reluctant-revolution/)---officially
translated as "watershed" but something more like "new era"---was almost
unthinkable six months ago. Berlin didn't just cancel the Nord Stream 2
pipeline (analysts had worried it might not) but also established a 100
billion euro (\$107 billion) fund to bolster its defense and committed
itself thereafter to spending 2 percent of its GDP on defense. Poland
and several other states made similar pledges to increase spending.

But as political scientist Barry Posen remarked at a [recent Cato
Institute
panel](https://www.cato.org/events/what-will-be-impact-war-ukraine-future-european-security),
there is reason to worry these pledges won't materialize. [The United
States has rushed into the breach, sending 20,000 additional U.S. troops
to Europe to reassure NATO allies. The downside of reassurance is that
when you reassure enough, your allies are likely to believe you and may
not step up and do more for their own defense. It seems likely that the
Europeans, confident behind Captain America's shield, will go back to
business as usual in Europe.]{.underline} For example, as [Jennifer
Lind's work on Japan shows](https://www.jstor.org/stable/4137548), Japan
did relatively more for its own defense only when it feared the United
States might do less. In this case, the Russian invasion of Ukraine
provided shock therapy for European threat assessments.
[[Restoring]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [as [Europe's
pacifier](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1148355)]{.mark} may [restore
**indifference and inaction**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

[In 2022, U.S. [allies]{.mark} are [not too weak]{.mark} to contain
Russia on their own. They simply refuse to do so out of the well-founded
[belief]{.mark} that the [United States will do so for them]{.mark}, and
accordingly their people would benefit from spending their own tax
dollars on domestic priorities.]{.underline}

The United States cannot maintain its role as the cornerstone of
European security while successfully competing with a growing China
forever. And the cheap-riding that afflicts the U.S. alliance in Europe
also [addles its alliances in
Asia](https://thediplomat.com/2021/08/rhetoric-aside-americas-asian-partners-are-giving-up-on-their-own-defense/).

Panegyrics to the trans-Atlantic community are still in vogue in
Washington because they are seen as cheap. [They
aren't](https://thebulletin.org/premium/2021-09/a-new-transatlantic-division-of-labor-could-save-billions-every-year/).
[[Resource constraints are beginning to bite.]{.mark} The defense
budget, already bloated at [\$847
billion](https://breakingdefense.com/2022/07/senate-armed-services-releases-full-847-billion-defense-bill/),
is not [headed to \$1
trillion](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2022-04-05/america-must-spend-more-defense) and
above anytime soon. Maintaining U.S. domination of the European security
scene is a luxury good the United States doesn't need in 2022. The
United States fought two wars to prevent a European hegemon from
emerging in the 20th century. There is no potential European hegemon on
or even over the horizon at the present. For all [Russia's]{.mark}
bluster, it's [struggling to take even part of a much smaller, poorer
neighbor]{.mark}---let alone hold it[. It's time to take the
win.]{.mark}]{.underline}

For those reasons, [[advocates of NATO]{.mark} as a permanent alliance
should probably [start thinking about Plan]{.mark} B, not advertising
the alliance as a cure-all for problems including climate change,
piracy, and disinformation. Europe is rich and strong enough to defend
itself. But the [Europeans won't do so unless **the United States
stops** doing it for them.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### NATO expansion forces the U.S. to defend weak Eastern European states, raising costs, limiting flexibility, and entangling it in local conflicts with little strategic benefit.

gmemb

First, [NATO expansion has tied the United States to a host of
[states]{.mark} which [add little to US security yet leave US policy
flexibility hostage to local dynamics]{.mark} with few exit
options]{.underline}. Strategically, regardless of whether one believes
the United States ought to try to dominate European politics itself or
more narrowly block the rise of a European hegemon, [it is difficult to
argue that states such as Poland, Hungary, Romania, and Latvia are
central to such an effort. [In terms of population, economics, military
potential, and diplomatic heft, these countries do little to bolster US
power and influence in Europe]{.mark}.]{.underline} Politically, [their
[liberalization]{.mark} [and commitment to free-market
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}---though good for those states---[is
[irrelevant]{.mark} to US national security.]{.underline} Even in the
context of European liberalism, one should recall that liberalism
flourished throughout much of the continent during the Cold War despite
the presence of communist autocracies. [And while it might be
detrimental to US national security should another state dominate
Central and Eastern Europe, the likelihood of such a [challenger
emerging]{.mark} is [virtually nil]{.mark} [given Russian
weakness]{.mark}]{.underline} (clearly demonstrated in its poor showing
in the Russia-Ukraine War), [regional actors' desire to protect their
own independence, and the presence of capable states in Western
Europe.]{.underline}

[By enlarging NATO to these states, however, the United States has been
pushed to treat their concerns as central to US interests --
[enlargement acted as a transmission belt that links allied concerns to
US policy]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the 1990s, concerns with regional
instability due to the Balkan Wars at a time when NATO was preparing to
enlarge helped pull the US into those conflicts. In the 2000s-2010s,
concerns from new NATO members and aspirant NATO members that Russia
might one day aggress again provided momentum for continued enlargement
and moving the alliance further into CEE. Since Russian-Ukrainian
tensions spiked after 2014, calls by vulnerable allies such as Latvia
and Estonia for protection have compelled the United States to consider
a range of costly schemes to defend states whose security is difficult
to ensure due to geography[. [If confrontation with Moscow
continues]{.mark}, these [demands]{.mark} are likely to
[increase]{.mark} even as the solutions may grow in cost and escalatory
potential.]{.underline} Meanwhile, because US leaders often put a
premium on ensuring the credibility of NATO's security guarantees -- in
part to keep enlargement itself a credible policy -- [there are [few
options for ignoring allied pressure]{.mark}. Had NATO not enlarged,
[security concerns]{.mark} in Eastern Europe [would have had more
limited impact on US defense planning and cost]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### NATO enlargement encourages allies to under-invest in defense and take risky actions, increasing U.S. costs and the risk of unwanted entanglement.

**Shifrinson 24** (Joshua Shifrinson is an associate professor with the
School of Public Policy. An expert on contemporary international

gmemb

Second, [[enlargement]{.mark} has likely [encouraged allied cheap-riding
and reckless-driving in ways that harm US security]{.mark}.]{.underline}
On the one hand, with NATO having gone from 16 to 32 members, it becomes
easier for any one country to under-invest in its defenses in hopes that
some other state will pick up the slack. [Enlargement]{.underline}
transformed the alliance from a primarily Western European enterprise to
a continent-wide grouping, which only [reinforced this problem by
[limiting]{.mark} the [extent]{.mark} to which [NATO members share
similar threat perceptions]{.mark}]{.underline}; it is not hard to
understand why, for example, Spain or Italy might perceive Russia as
less threatening than Poland and so prepare for different security
missions. [With the US as the primary booster of
enlargement,]{.underline} however[, and having staked much of its
foreign policy on the alliance, it often [falls to Washington to make
up]{.mark} the [difference in allied investments]{.mark} and
[ensure]{.mark} the [alliance is strategically
viable]{.mark}.]{.underline} Thus, not only has [US defense spending
been higher than other allies,]{.underline} but [the [US]{.mark} has
been [called upon]{.mark} both [in]{.mark} **[peacetime]{.mark}** -- for
instance, to reinforce Eastern Europe following the 2022 Russian
invasion of Ukraine -- [and]{.mark} in **[wartime]{.mark}** -- for
example, during the 2011 Libyan intervention -- [to compensate for
**European shortfalls**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

Some of the alliance's post-Cold War members have also likely engaged in
reckless driving due to the extra margin of security provided by NATO
membership. [The Baltic states, for example, have often taken the lead
in challenging Russian foreign policy despite their evident concern with
possible Russian aggression.]{.underline} It is difficult to explain
these contradictory trends without NATO security guarantees: [[absent
NATO membership, one expects]{.mark} these [states to look to their
defenses without]{.mark} otherwise [risking]{.mark} the very
[confrontation]{.mark} they fear.]{.underline} Polish policy during the
Russia-Ukraine War provides another example: [without NATO membership,
one would not expect Warsaw to be so forward-leaning in calling for
intervention in a conflict with a conventionally superior nuclear power,
nor to take steps on its own]{.underline} (e.g., offering Ukraine
bilateral security guarantees[) that increase the risk of
involvement.]{.underline} Because such reckless driving can lead to
conflicts and confrontations involving NATO allies, [they provide an
[ongoing risk of **US entanglement** in situations where the US, left to
its own devices, would not be involved.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### NATO Bad\-\--Useless

#### NATOs internal weaknesses make it ineffective

**Dempsey 18** \[Judy Dempsey; Nonresident Senior Fellow, Carnegie
Europe, "NATO's Bad Apples," 04/03/2018,
https://carnegieendowment.org/europe/strategic-europe/2018/04/natos-bad-apples?lang=en\]

[[When a]{.mark} leading [NATO member makes public]{.mark} the [military
positions]{.mark} of another ally deep inside a war zone, possibly
[endangering]{.mark} those [forces, NATO remains
silent.]{.mark}]{.underline}

When NATO members undermine democratic values and the basic tenets of
the rule of law, including an independent media and judiciary, they are
not taken to task.

Over the past few years---and in particular, over the past nine
months---[several [members]{.mark} of the U.S.-led military alliance
[have run roughshod over NATO solidarity]{.mark} and the basic
principles upon which the alliance was founded in April
1949.]{.underline}

Turkey, for example, actually revealed the positions of French troops in
northeast Syria. Since 2016, according to the AFP, these forces have
been based in areas controlled by the YPG/PKK. The Kurdish YPG dominates
the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).

President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan recently sharply criticized his French
counterpart, Emmanuel Macron, for meeting SDF leaders in Paris and for
offering to mediate between the SDF and Turkey. For Erdoğan, that was
tantamount to negotiating with the Syrian branch of the PKK, which
Ankara insists is a terrorist organization.

Yet Erdoğan went further. A Turkish news agency revealed the positions
of the French forces. What sort of solidarity and discretion does that
amount to, when one ally could endanger another?

Closer to home, [[NATO]{.mark} has to [contend]{.mark} with [Poland and
Hungary undermining]{.mark} the [independence of the judiciary
and]{.mark} an [independent media]{.mark}, not to mention that way in
which nongovernmental organizations in Hungary have been vilified and
refugees refused shelter.]{.underline}

Then there is the corruption in the alliance's newest member,
Montenegro, and the persistent attacks on the judiciary and
anticorruption watchdogs in Romania.

Altogether, [[these examples]{.mark} do much to [**undermine** NATO as
an alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}, whose members pledge "to safeguard the
freedom, common heritage and civilization of their peoples, founded on
the principles of democracy, individual liberty, and the rule of law.
They seek to promote stability and well-being in the North Atlantic
area."

Back in the last 1940s, the rule of law and democracy didn't matter that
much for NATO. The alliance's priorities focused on the security,
safety, and protection of its members (in short, the West). When Greece
and Turkey joined NATO in 1952, their membership was about bolstering
the defenses of this part of Europe against the Soviet threat.
Geostrategic interests and strengthening the anti-Communist bulwark took
precedence over the rule of law and strong, democratic, accountable
institutions.

In recent years, when it's come to countries wanting to join NATO, there
has been more emphasis on values and democracy. [But in its own home,
[NATO's record for upholding]{.mark} basic [principles]{.mark} [is **far
from stellar**]{.mark}. And its [reluctance to criticize]{.mark} its
[allies exposes]{.mark} some of its **[intrinsic
weaknesses.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[The first is that NATO countries are loathed to criticize each
other,]{.underline} either publicly or even behind closed doors in the
North Atlantic Council (NAC)---the forum in which alliance ambassadors
meet. The NAC got its fingers badly burned during the U.S-led war
against Iraq in 2002. Apart from NATO countries being so bitterly
divided over the invasion, NAC sessions often ended up in shouting
matches between the American and French ambassadors. NATO's fragility
was exposed for all to see.

Yet, wasn't it necessary for ambassadors to speak out? Yes, they are
constrained by their own governments[. But [if NATO]{.mark} could
not---and **[did not]{.mark}**---[speak out against torture]{.mark}, or
[renditions, or]{.mark} the [illegality]{.mark} of the U.S. invasion of
Iraq, or what is now happening to Turkey's democratic institutions, then
[what does that say about the alliance's
principles]{.mark}?]{.underline}

[The second weakness is that [NATO doesn't have formal mechanisms to
suspend an ally]{.mark}]{.underline}. And even if it wanted to
discipline a member, that would require consensus.

Russia, for one, would be delighted if NATO washed its dirty linen in
public. Ever since its establishment, the Kremlin's goal has been to
divide and weaken NATO with the eventual aim of getting rid of it. But
the fact that countries still want to join NATO show their need for
security and reassurance. Russia's annexation of Crimea and its proxy
invasion of eastern Ukraine confirmed why countries want to sign up to
the alliance.

NATO, however, does have an informal mechanism at its disposal. It is
intelligence sharing---or the lack of it. [One of the reasons why the
big [member states of NATO do not share intelligence across the board is
because of the **lack of trust**]{.mark}]{.underline}, the feeling that
the information will be passed on to non-NATO members (meaning Russia
and China and other countries).

Yet none of the above legitimates a silence over the rule of law, over
the erosion of basic democratic principles, and over how some allies are
endangering others. NATO, it's time to move on. What about scrapping
some of the many talking-shop committees and instead creating a special
ombudsperson responsible for NATO's core principles?

#### Trump will continue to destroy NATO credibility 

**Daalder 25** \[IVO H. DAALDER is Chief Executive Officer of the
Chicago Council on Global Affairs and served as U.S. Ambassador to NATO
from 2009 to 2013, "NATO Without America: How Europe Can Run an Alliance
Designed for U.S. Control," 03/28/2025,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/nato-without-america\]

During its 76-year history, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization has
faced its share of crises, but none have been as grave as what it
confronts today. [Since returning to office, U.S. President Donald
[Trump has questioned]{.mark} the two [core principles of]{.mark} the
alliance's [collective defense commitment]{.mark}: that there is a
shared understanding of the threats to NATO members and that security
among all those members is indivisible.]{.underline} The United States
sided with Russia and against every other NATO member in February when
it opposed a United Nations resolution condemning Russia's invasion of
Ukraine. Moreover[, Trump has repeatedly [called into question NATO's
collective-defense provision]{.mark} by [declaring]{.mark} that [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [**will not defend** allies who "don't
pay]{.mark}"---despite the fact that [**nearly all** NATO members
have]{.mark} **dramatically [increased]{.mark}** their defense
[spending]{.mark} since 2014.]{.underline}

[Given Trump's low regard for the alliance and its collective defense
commitment, [it would be **no**]{.mark} [**surprise** if]{.mark} his
[administration decided to withdraw from NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
late 2023, Congress passed a law prohibiting the president from doing
this without congressional assent---a bill that, ironically, was
cosponsored by then Senator Marco Rubio, who is now Trump's secretary of
state. But if the administration were to decide to flout the law, it is
unlikely that the Supreme Court would do anything to stop it. The court
has historically deferred matters of foreign affairs to the executive
branch and could find that the law itself is unconstitutional.

[Even if he doesn't withdraw from the alliance, [Trump has
already]{.mark} **seriously undermined** it. [NATO]{.mark}'s Article 5
collective-defense provision]{.underline}---which says that an attack on
any alliance member will be considered an attack on all---derives its
credibility less from the formal treaty than from a belief among the
members that they are all prepared to come to one another's defense. In
practice, this has meant that the United States, with its vast military,
would step up to protect any NATO ally that is attacked. [Trump's words
and actions since retaking office---[including]{.mark} his [direct
threats against Canada and Greenland]{.mark}, both of which are part of
NATO---have eroded these assumptions.]{.underline} As incoming German
Chancellor Friedrich Merz stated in February, it is uncertain whether,
in a few months, "we will still be talking about NATO in its current
form."

Can NATO survive without the United States, which throughout the
alliance's history has been both its leading member and principal
security provider? Theoretically, yes: if the Trump administration
withdraws from NATO, the treaty will remain in effect for the other 31
members. Practically, however, the U.S. role in the alliance would be
difficult to replace, especially in a short period of time. [Given the
fundamental changes to U.S. foreign policy under Trump, the most
pressing next step for the rest of NATO is to envision a future without
the United States and to position the alliance to succeed
regardless.]{.underline}

### NATO Bad\-\--Collapse Inevitable

#### Trump threats are fragmenting NATO \-\-- Only withdrawal can solve 

**Little 25** \[Allan Little is a Senior correspondent for BBC, "Trump
has blown up the world order - and left Europe\'s leaders scrabbling,"

[The United States\' [foreign policy is]{.mark} now [driven]{.mark}, in
part at least, [by]{.mark} the imperatives of its [culture
wars]{.mark}.]{.underline} The security of Europe has become entangled
in the battle between two polarised and mutually antagonistic visions of
what the United States stands for.

Some think the division is about more than Trump\'s particular views and
that Europe can not just sit tight waiting for his term in office to
end.

\"[The US is becoming divorced from European values]{.underline},\"
argues Ed Arnold, senior research fellow at the Royal United Services
Institute (RUSI) in London. \"That\'s difficult \[for Europeans\] to
swallow because it means that it\'s structural, cultural and potentially
long-term. \"

\"[I think [the current trajectory of the US will **outlast
Trump**]{.mark}, as a person. I think [Trumpism will outlast]{.mark}
[his presidency]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"

Nato Article 5 \'is on life support\'

[The Trump [White House has said it will no longer be]{.mark} the
[primary guarantor of]{.mark} European [security]{.mark}, and that
European [nations should be responsible for their own
defence]{.mark}]{.underline} and pay for it.

\"If \[Nato countries\] don\'t pay, I\'m not going to defend them. No,
I\'m not going to defend them,\" the president said earlier this month.

For almost 80 years, the cornerstone of European security has been
embedded in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, which states that an
attack on one member state of the alliance is an attack on all.

In Downing Street last month, just before his visit to the White House,
the Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer told me during an interview that he
was satisfied that the United States remained the leading member of Nato
and that Trump personally remained committed to Article 5.

Others are less sure.

Ben Wallace, who was defence secretary in the last Conservative
government, told me earlier this month: \"I think Article 5 is on life
support.

\"If Europe, including the United Kingdom, doesn\'t step up to the
plate, invest a lot on defence and take it seriously, [[it\'s]{.mark}
potentially [the **end of the Nato**]{.mark} that we know [and]{.mark}
it\'ll be [the end of Article 5]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

\"Right now, I wouldn\'t bet my house that Article 5 would be able to be
triggered in the event of a Russian attack... I certainly wouldn\'t take
for granted that the United States would ride to the rescue.\"

According to polling by the French company Institut Elabe, nearly [three
quarters of French people now think that the United States is not an
ally of France]{.underline}. A majority in Britain and a very large
majority in Denmark, both [historically pro-American countries, now have
unfavourable views of the United States as well.]{.underline}

\"[[The damage Trump has done to Nato is]{.mark} probably
**[irreparable]{.mark}**]{.underline},\" argues Robert Kagan, a
conservative commentator, author and senior fellow at the Brookings
Institute in Washington DC who has been a long time critic of Trump.

\"[[The alliance]{.mark} relied on an American guarantee that **is no
longer reliable**, to say the least]{.underline}\".

And yet Trump is by no means the first US president to tell Europe to
get its defence spending in order. In 2016 Barack Obama urged Nato
allies to increase theirs, saying: \"Europe has sometimes been
complacent about its own defence.\"

#### Trumps spending goals are unclear and unsustainable for NATO countries

The current economic context is sobering. [[Debt levels among]{.mark}
many [NATO]{.mark} member [states are]{.mark} relatively [high
and]{.mark} the [fiscal sustainability]{.mark} of several [of them is
**questionable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Among the allies, only Germany
has historically had a rigorous fiscal policy, with a debt-to-GDP ratio
below 100 (62.5 per cent). However, in 2025 the German Parliament
amended the country's constitution to lift the debt brake and thus
enable an increase in military expenditure.

[Other major [NATO economies face fiscal sustainability challenges due
**to high levels** of]{.mark} public [debt]{.mark}]{.underline}. In May
2025, the ratings firm Moody's downgraded the USA's credit rating due to
concerns over its debt. Two out of three of the [main ratings agencies
assessed the outlook for [France's credit ratings as
**negative**,]{.mark}]{.underline} after downgrading their ratings in
2024. In the last quarter of 2024, French debt was 112 per cent of GDP[.
The International Monetary Fund ([IMF]{.mark}) [has warned Italy about
its debt]{.mark} and urged fiscal reform]{.underline}. In 2023, Italy's
debt reached 135 per cent of GDP.

[The new [NATO spending target]{.mark} is divided into two
categories.]{.underline} States are to allocate at least 3.5 per cent of
GDP 'based on the agreed definition of NATO defence expenditure' to
'core defence requirements'. They should also 'account for' up to 1.5
per cent of GDP being spent on other 'defence- and security-related
spending', including to 'inter alia protect our critical infrastructure,
defend our networks, ensure our civil preparedness and resilience,
unleash innovation, and strengthen our defence industrial base.'

[It [remains **unclear**]{.mark} what qualifies under this additional
1.5 per cent]{.underline}. For example, spending on 'developing the
defence industrial base' and defence-related infrastructure would
typically already fall under core defence. On the one hand, if the 1.5
per cent were to be clearly defined as investments in civil resilience,
such as transportation or communication infrastructure, it could bring
tangible benefits to the wider population. Military spending per se
would then account for 3.5 per cent of GDP. On the other hand, if the
1.5 per cent is primarily used to boost production capacities in the
arms industry or build military-related infrastructure, the broader
societal benefits may be limited, reinforcing the defence-centric
approach and pushing up states' military burden to the headline 5 per
cent of GDP.

However the money is spent, it is important to illustrate the scale of
adjustment required to reach the new target. The average military burden
for all NATO members in 2024 stands at 2.2 per cent of GDP, equivalent
to approximately US\$1.5 trillion. [At 3.5 per cent of GDP, [expenditure
on core defence]{.mark} for many NATO allies [would]{.mark} still
[constitute a]{.mark} **doubling or tripling** [of their current]{.mark}
[expenditures]{.mark}]{.underline}. Only Poland, with a military burden
of 4.2 per cent of GDP (see figure 1) would as of 2024 be considered to
have reached the target.

### NATO Bad\-\--Withdrawal Better

#### Withdrawal from NATO provides strategic capabilities and deterrence

**Coward 24** \[Alexander Coward is a mathematician and educator at
universities including Oxford, UC Davis, and UC Berkeley, "It's Time for
the US To Bid Farewell to NATO," 11/25/2024,
https://www.fairobserver.com/politics/its-time-for-the-us-to-bid-farewell-to-nato/\]

Some will argue that leaving NATO is too risky, that it could
destabilize Europe and embolden Russia. But this view underestimates
Europe's capabilities and overestimates Russia's. [By
[continuing]{.mark} its [outdated commitment to NATO]{.mark}, [the US is
fostering **dependency and resentment**]{.mark}, preventing Europe from
developing the military self-reliance it needs.]{.underline}

Proponents of NATO often point to its invocation of Article 5 after the
September 11 attacks as proof of the alliance's value. However, this
argument ignores a crucial reality: The response to the attacks would
have happened with or without NATO. When faced with acts of aggression
that demand a response, the United States has repeatedly demonstrated
its ability to rapidly form and provide leadership to coalitions outside
of formal alliance structures.

The First Gulf War in 1991 serves as a prime example. In response to
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the US quickly assembled a coalition of 42
nations, many of whom were not NATO members. This "coalition of the
willing" included fighters from countries as diverse as Japan, New
Zealand and Afghanistan. The swift and effective formation of this
coalition underscores a fundamental truth[: [When genuine threats
arise]{.mark}, [nations]{.mark} band together to [address them, which
can be **easier without**]{.mark} the cumbersome framework of **an
organization like [NATO]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

[[Game theory offers]{.mark} [a]{.mark}nother compelling [reason for the
US to leave]{.mark}: the [strategic value of
**unpredictability**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In a world of mass
surveillance where concealing actions is increasingly difficult, being
predictable can be a significant disadvantage. Consider a poker game
where one player always has a pair of kings, while the other has queens
or aces with equal probability. Despite each player having the stronger
hand half the time, the unpredictable player will on average win more.

This principle applies similarly to military strategy. [[NATO's]{.mark}
rigid [structure]{.mark} and well-defined protocols [make its responses
predictable]{.mark}.]{.underline} By leaving NATO, the US introduces an
element of uncertainty that can serve as a more effective deterrent.
[Potential [adversaries would no longer be able to rely on a]{.mark}
[known]{.mark} command and control [structure]{.mark} or anticipate
specific responses. This [unpredictability]{.mark} can in turn [force
adversaries to be more cautious, preventing conflicts]{.mark} **before
they begin.**]{.underline}

Moreover, while it is true that P implies Q does not mean the same as
not P implies not Q, there is often an implicit assumption that it does.
By the United States declaring "If there is an attack on a NATO country,
there will be an overwhelming response from the United States" it
suggests to potential enemies that "If there is an attack on a non-NATO
country, the United States will not respond with overwhelming force."
This is clearly seen in Ukraine, where Putin is in plain sight employing
the principle: "Ukraine not NATO, therefore Ukraine fair game."

The reality on the ground is that the Iron curtain no longer exists and
we live in a world with fuzzy borders and hybrid warfare. The correct
response to this is illustrated regarding Taiwan. Will America go to war
to defend Taiwan? It might. That should be the answer to every question
of that form. Will America go to war over a sabotaged undersea cable or
gas pipeline? It might. Will it go to war over an act of terrorism? It
might. Will America go to war to defend Europe? It might. America should
go to war when the American President and Congress decide that it
should, not because of a treaty from three quarters of a century ago
born of a different age. [By [withdrawing from NATO, the]{.mark}
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [would put Ukraine on **equal footing**
with]{.mark} not just Poland but also [France and Germany]{.mark}, and
be a masterstroke of expanding not contracting American
influence.]{.underline}

[In essence, [by stepping away from NATO, the US would]{.mark}
paradoxically **enhance global security** by keeping potential
aggressors guessing about the nature and extent of possible responses to
their actions.]{.underline}

#### Post U.S. withdrawal policies are less likely to threaten Russia 

**Trachtenberg 24** \[Marc Trachtenberg is a professor of political
science at the University of California, Los Angeles, "Is There Life
After NATO?" 10/22/2024,
https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/there-life-after-nato\]

Would an American withdrawal from Europe, even if it were well
managed---and that is a very big "if"---lead to a better world? The
international political system is extraordinarily complex. All kinds of
effects are therefore possible, and no one can tell in advance how
things will sort themselves out. But one point is worth stressing. The
United States---the world's one remaining superpower, the "indispensable
nation" (to use Madeleine Albright's famous term112)---can pursue very
ambitious policies. [But [a]{.mark} European [system in which the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [would play]{.mark} at most [a peripheral
role]{.mark} [would work differently]{.mark}]{.underline}. European
ambitions would be limited to what all the major countries would
support. [Their [policy would]{.mark} almost certainly [be more
moderate]{.mark}, more status quo--oriented, [and]{.mark} more **[purely
defensive]{.mark}** than the policy the United States has been pursuing
since 1991 [and would]{.mark} thus [be less likely to be perceived as a
threat by Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline}113 [So, there is a good chance
that [a European system would be **more stable** than the one]{.mark} we
are [now]{.mark} living with.]{.underline} The issue, at any rate, is
certainly worth thinking about. "There are few things so bad," as two
RAND analysts remarked many years ago, "that not thinking about them
won't make them worse."114 Indeed, the mere fact of this sort of
thinking might have a positive impact on everyone's policies.

This brings me to my final point, about the role that historical
analysis should play as we grapple with these issues. My claim here---in
fact, my basic claim in this paper as a whole---is that it has a
fundamental role to play, and that one of the main reasons why we have
to deal with the mess we now find ourselves in is that such an analysis
hasn't played anything like the role it should have. The case of
America's treatment of Germany at the end of and immediately after World
War I springs to mind. The Germans did not surrender unconditionally;
they laid down their arms after they had been given certain promises and
assurances---some explicit, some tacit---about how they would be treated
after the war. But the victor powers, and especially the Americans,
reneged on those promises---with devastating consequences, both in
Germany and eventually in the Western countries themselves.115

The full story here is not well known. When people think of the failure
of the peace of 1919, they tend to blame the British and the French;
Woodrow Wilson is rarely held responsible for what happened. But his
policies, and especially his refusal to honor the pre-armistice
agreement, played a crucial role in the story. It might have been a good
idea to keep that story in mind as US policy toward Russia was being
worked out after 1991. To be sure, the argument was often made that the
Western powers should have pursued a more generous policy toward their
former Cold War rival in the 1990s; Winston Churchill's famous saying,
"In Victory: Magnanimity," is often cited in those discussions. But a
deeper historical understanding might have given the point greater
force---and thus greater emotional and therefore political salience.
Historical study more generally can be of real value in this context.
Trying to understand, for example, why the peacemakers in 1815 were able
to lay the basis for a relatively stable international system, while
their successors a century later failed to do so, can yield important
lessons about how we should deal with international politics today. That
includes the question of how, if at all, we should move to a post-NATO
world.

So, is there life after NATO? Of course there is. [[The world **will not
end** if the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [withdraws from the
alliance]{.mark}. The [Europeans]{.mark}, with a combined GDP (by some
estimates) roughly five times as large as Russia's, [are]{.mark}
[**certainly capable** of defending themselves]{.mark}, and if America
withdrew, [they]{.mark} [would]{.mark} have little choice but to [work
out some system for doing so.]{.mark}]{.underline} But how well the
transition to a European defense system would be managed---assuming
there will be a transition---is very much an open question. The time to
start thinking about it is now.

#### NATO will be fine without the U.S. \-\-- Europe can stave off Russian aggression

**Lendon 25** \[Brad Lendon is the Senior News Desk Reporter, Global
Military Affairs, for CNN International, based in Seoul, South Korea,
"Can NATO survive without the United States?" 03/07/2025,
https://www.cnn.com/2025/03/07/europe/nato-ukraine-survive-without-united-states-analysis-intl-hnk-ml\]

Europe is staring down the barrel of a stark new reality where the
United States being the backbone of NATO -- the alliance that has
guaranteed the continent's security for almost 80 years -- is no longer
a given.

President Donald Trump's public animosity towards Ukraine's Volodymyr
Zelensky, his willingness to embrace Russia's Vladimir Putin and recent
comments casting doubt over whether he would defend NATO allies "if they
don't pay" have all forced European leaders to start thinking the
previously unthinkable - is the US a reliable security partner at a time
when the continent is being rocked by its biggest war since the 1940s?

[But [NATO]{.mark} without the US [is far from impotent]{.mark}, with
more than a million troops and modern weaponry at its disposal from the
31 other countries in the alliance. [It]{.mark} also [has the wealth
and]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nological knowhow [to defend itself without the
US]{.mark}]{.underline}, analysts say.

The US and Germany are the biggest contributors to NATO's military
budget, civil budget and security investment program, at almost 16%
each, followed by the UK at 11% and France at 10%, a NATO fact sheet
says. Analysts say [[it **wouldn't take much** for Europe to make up for
the loss]{.mark} of Washington's contribution.]{.underline}

If European countries unite and buy the right equipment,
[[Europe]{.mark} "could [pose a **serious**]{.mark} conventional and ...
nuclear [deterrent" to Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}, Ben Schreer, Europe
executive director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies
(IISS), said in a Zoom call with CNN and other journalists in late
February.

["[Europe alone]{.mark} (still [has]{.mark}) [a capacity to muster the
resources]{.mark} it would need [to defend itself]{.mark}, it's just a
question of whether (it is) willing to]{.underline}," Schreer said.

And that's the key question. Over more than 75 years and the
administrations of 14 different US presidents, including the first Trump
administration, the US has been the sinew that has kept the alliance
together.

During the Cold War, US troops on the continent were there as a
deterrent to any Soviet ambitions to expand the Warsaw Pact alliance and
eventually saw out its end when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989. NATO
campaigns in the Balkans in the 1990s were conducted with US troops and
airpower. And, until the second Trump administration took office on
January 20, Washington spearheaded aid for Ukraine.

Those decades of trans-Atlantic solidarity may have come to an end in
recent days, analysts say.

Trump's Oval Office blow-up with Zelensky - after which he halted US aid
to Kyiv - "felt like a deeper rupture, not just with Ukraine, but with
the US 'free world' strategy from Truman through Reagan," Dan Fried, a
senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and former US assistant secretary
of state for Europe, said on the council's website.

John Lough, a former NATO official who is now an associate fellow at the
Chatham House think tank in London, sees an even more profound split in
the alliance.

"It simply feels that the United States sees Europe more as a
competitor, a rival, than an ally," Lough told CNN, adding that because
of that the commitment for Washington to defend NATO allies is somewhat
in doubt.

It's a fracture that Lough sees as unrepairable.

"Once you start to lose part of that commitment, you effectively lose it
all," Lough said.

Some people in European circles are starting to ask whether Washington
should be described "in some ways as an enemy," he said.

[But some analysts say a [NATO without the US is **not a bad
idea**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

"[As soon as US [allies]{.mark} become convinced that they can no longer
trust in US capabilities to defend them when push comes to shove, they
[will]{.mark} rush to [pick up the slack and work towards growing their
own capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}," Moritz Graefrath, a postdoctoral
fellow in security and foreign policy at William & Mary's Global
Research Institute, wrote in War on the Rocks last year.

"[It is in this sense that --- perhaps counterintuitively --- [a
withdrawal of US forces will create a]{.mark}n **even
[stronger]{.mark},** not weaker, [Europe]{.mark}]{.underline},"
Graefrath wrote.

Prime Minister of NATO member Poland, Donald Tusk, thinks this process
has started already.

"[Europe as a whole is truly capable of winning any military, financial,
economic confrontation with Russia - we are simply
stronger]{.underline}," he said ahead of a European Union summit this
week. "We just had to start believing in it. And today it seems to be
happening."

### NATO Bad\-\--Environment 

\*this should be read with prolif defense on the neg but could also be
an aff card that says U.S. withdrawal triggers prolif and is bad for the
environment\*

#### U.S. pressure for increased military spending fuels climate crises that trigger conflict 

**Gayle 25** \[Damien Gayle is an environment correspondent for the
Guardian, "Revealed: Nato rearmament could increase emissions by 200m
tonnes a year," 05/29/2025,
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/may/29/nato-military-spending-could-increase-emissions-study-finds\]

A global military buildup poses an existential threat to climate goals,
according to researchers who say [[the]{.mark} [rearmament
plan]{.mark}ned [by Nato]{.mark} alone could [increase greenhouse gas
emissions by]{.mark} almost **[200m tonnes]{.mark} a
year.**]{.underline}

With the world embroiled in the highest number of armed conflicts since
the second world war, countries have embarked on military spending
sprees, collectively totalling a record \$2.46tn in 2023.

For every dollar invested in new hardware, there is not only a
corresponding carbon cost but also an opportunity cost to potential
climate action, critics say. This is on top of the huge death toll
resulting from armed conflicts.

"There is a real concern around the way that we are prioritising
short-term security and sacrificing long-term security," said Ellie
Kinney, a researcher with the Conflict and Environment Observatory and a
co-author of the study, shared exclusively with the Guardian.

["Because of this kind of lack-of-informed approach that we're taking,
you're [investing in]{.mark} hard [military]{.mark} [security now,
increasing global emissions]{.mark} for that reason, [and worsening the
climate crisis]{.mark} further down the line."]{.underline}

[[That]{.mark} in turn [is only likely to lead to **further
violence**]{.mark}, with [climate change]{.mark} itself now increasingly
[seen as a **driver of conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline}, albeit
indirectly. In Sudan's Darfur region, conflict was linked to competition
over scarce resources after prolonged droughts and desertification. In
the Arctic, receding sea ice is leading to tensions over who should
control newly accessible oil, gas and critical mineral resources.

Few militaries are transparent about the scale of their fossil fuel use,
but researchers have estimated that collectively they are already
responsible for 5.5% of [global greenhouse gas
[emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[That figure is [expected to rise as]{.mark} tensions escalate in a
number of regions and as [the U]{.mark}S[,]{.mark} for decades the
world's biggest military spender, [indicates]{.mark} that [it
expects]{.mark} its [Nato]{.mark} allies [to devote]{.mark}
significantly [more resources to their armed
forces.]{.mark}]{.underline}

According to the Global Peace Index, militarisation increased in 108
countries in 2023. With 92 countries involved in armed conflict, in
places ranging from Ukraine and Gaza to South Sudan and DRC, with
tensions seething between China and the US over Taiwan, and with the
frozen conflict between India and Pakistan flaring, governments fearful
of war are investing heavily in their militaries.

In Europe, the increase has been particularly dramatic: between 2021 and
2024, EU states' weapons spending rose by more than 30%, according to
the International Institute for Strategic Studies.

In March, the EU, disconcerted by Donald Trump's cutting of military aid
and diplomatic support for Ukraine, indicated this would go further,
with proposals for a further €800bn spend across the bloc outlined in a
plan called "ReArm Europe".

In analysis for the UN Office for Disarmament Affairs, Kinney and
colleagues looked at the potential impact of increased militarisation on
meeting climate goals. What they found was sobering: [[the]{.mark}
likely [increase in emissions from Nato's remilitarisation]{.mark} alone
[would be]{.mark} the [equivalent]{.mark} of [adding]{.mark} the cost of
[a country **as large and populous as Pakistan** to the world]{.mark}'s
remaining carbon budget.]{.underline}

"Our analysis specifically looks at the impact on sustainable
development goal 13, which is climate action -- to take urgent action to
combat climate change and its impacts," Kinney said. "And what our
analysis finds, looking at the various sub-targets of that ... \[is\]
that there is a real threat to global climate action caused by global
increase in military spending."

Of all functions of states, militaries are almost uniquely
carbon-intensive. "First of all, with the equipment that they purchase,
which is mainly a lot of steel and aluminium, which is very
carbon-intensive to produce," said Lennard de Klerk, of the Initiative
on the GHG Accounting of War, another co-author of th study.

"Secondly is during operations, armies are very mobile. And in order to
move around they use fossil fuels -- that's diesel for ground operations
and kerosene for air operations. Or for maritime operations it's mainly
diesel as well, if they're not nuclear-driven."

Given the secrecy that usually surrounds militaries and their
operations, it is difficult to know just how much greenhouse gases they
are emitting. Only Nato countries report enough of their emissions for
scientists to attempt an estimate.

"We took Nato because they are the most transparent in terms of
spending. So it's not that we particularly want to focus on Nato, but
simply because they have more data available," De Klerk said.

[The researchers calculated by how much greenhouse gas emissions would
increase if Nato countries excluding the US -- since it already spends
far more than the others -- made a two percentage point increase in the
share of GDP they devoted to their militaries.]{.underline}

Such an increase is already under way, with many countries in Europe
significantly increasing military spending in response to the crisis in
Ukraine. Although Nato countries have publicly committed to increasing
spending to 2% of GDP, the researchers say the ReArm Europe plan could
lead to an eventual rise to 3.5%, from about 1.5% in 2020. The
researchers assumed a similar eventual increase in Nato members that are
not members of the EU, such as the UK.

Borrowing methodology from a recent paper that argued each percentage
point increase in the share of GDP devoted to military spending would
lead to an increase in national emissions of between 0.9% and 2%, they
estimated that a two percentage point spending shock would lead to an
increase across the bloc of between 87 and 194 megatonnes of carbon
dioxide equivalent (CO2e) a year.

[The researchers say that not only would [such a huge increase in
emissions supercharge climate breakdown]{.mark} [but the increase in
global temperatures would]{.mark} **hurt the economy**]{.underline}.
Recent estimates of the social cost of carbon -- a monetary indicator of
the damage of CO2 emitted -- put it at \$1,347/tCO2e, suggesting the
annual cost of Nato's military buildup could be as much as \$264bn a
year.

And that is only a fraction of the true carbon cost of militarisation,
Kinney points out. "The calculation in the paper, it's 31 countries --
that only represents 9% of total world emissions. If you consider ...
the impact of that, there's a lot of the world that we haven't taken
into consideration of this specific calculation."

[The analysis notes that spending more money on militaries also reduces
resources available for policies aimed at mitigating climate
change]{.underline}. This already seems to be the case, with the UK, for
example, funding its increase in spending by reducing its overseas aid
budget -- a move mirrored in Belgium, France and the Netherlands.

"This increase in military spending is impacting the kind of core trust
that is necessary for multilateralism," Kinney said. "At Cop29, global
south countries like Cuba in particular pointed out the hypocrisy in the
room of states being willing to spend increasing amounts on their
military spending, but offering ... completely, unacceptably low climate
finance commitments."

The Guardian has contacted Nato for comment.

### NATO Bad\-\--Prolif Defense

#### Withdrawal will not cause prolif

**Kamp 25** \[Dr. Karl-Heinz Kamp has been an associate fellow in DGAP's
Center for Order and Governance in Eastern Europe, Russia, and Central
Asia, "What If the USA Closes Its Nuclear Umbrella Over Europe?"
03/17/2025,
https://dgap.org/en/research/publications/what-if-usa-closes-its-nuclear-umbrella-over-europe\]

Regardless of the factors mentioned above, it cannot be ruled out that
Donald Trump, despite all his own interests, will cancel the American
commitment to NATO and thus also the nuclear protection for Europe. How
could Europe act in such an extreme situation?

[Two options that have occasionally been raised in Germany are likely to
be ruled out]{.underline}. Contrary to the suggestion of a few eccentric
academics and far-right politicians, [[Germany will **not develop** its
own]{.mark} [nuclear weapons]{.mark}.]{.underline} In both [[the]{.mark}
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (**[NPT]{.mark}**) [and the
**Two-Plus-Four Treaty**]{.mark} on German Unity, the Federal Republic
of [Germany]{.mark} has [committed]{.mark} itself [to not seek its own
nuclear weapons.]{.mark}]{.underline} There is no democratic political
force in Germany that would seriously undermine this commitment.
Furthermore, [the [development of a nuclear weapons]{.mark} capability,
including delivery systems, [would swallow up]{.mark} huge [sums of
money that are]{.mark} completely [disproportionate]{.mark} to any
possible benefit]{.underline} -- not to mention the political signals
that would be sent out by a German grab for the bomb.

[[The idea of a]{.mark} European [nuclear capability within the]{.mark}
framework of the [E]{.mark}uropean [U]{.mark}nion i[s also
**unrealistic**]{.mark}. [The EU does not have]{.mark} a [common
government who]{.mark}se president or prime minister [could]{.mark}
[decide on]{.mark} the [use]{.mark} of nuclear weapons]{.underline}.
Having to agree on a nuclear response to a vital threat after hours of
late-night meetings in Brussels -- possibly even as a majority decision
-- is illusory and would have no deterrent effect whatsoever.

In the same breath, [[the idea has]{.mark} often [been formulated that
France could act as a nuclear guarantor]{.mark} for the EU]{.underline}
now that the UK is no longer available due to its withdrawal from the
Union. [What speaks against this, [however]{.mark}, is the fact that
[Paris has]{.mark} always [rejected the idea of "extended
deterrence]{.mark},"]{.underline} i.e., that a nuclear state could
provide nuclear security guarantees for a non-nuclear ally. For France,
nuclear weapons were always national weapons that could only protect its
own territory. This is why France developed its own nuclear potential
instead of relying on the US umbrella.

If alternatives to the worst-case scenario of an end to American nuclear
protection are to be discussed, this cannot take place at either the
national level or within the European Union itself. Such
[[discussions]{.mark} [must include]{.mark} the second European nuclear
power, [Great Britain]{.mark}, as well as militarily [and]{.mark}
geopolitically significant states such as [Norway]{.mark}. Thus, a
[nuclear deterrent without the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
--]{.underline} albeit limited [-- [can]{.mark} only [be **considered
within the framework of**]{.mark} the European pillar of
**NATO**.]{.underline}

[Trump said he had been of this view for years and shared it
with [Nato](https://www.theguardian.com/world/nato) allies during his

our alliance. President Trump has made clear the commitment of the US
and his commitment personally to Nato, and it has also made clear the
expectation that we in Europe must do more in terms of defense
spending."

[In the Oval Office, [Trump said Nato members were friends of his but
questioned whether France or a "couple of others" would protect the US
in a moment of crisis.]{.mark}]{.underline}

["You know the biggest problem I have with Nato? I really, I mean, I
know the guys very well. They're friends of mine. [But if the United
States was in trouble]{.mark}, and we called them, we said, 'We got a
problem, France. We got a problem, couple of others I won't mention. [Do
you think they're going to]{.mark} come and [protect us?]{.mark}'
They're supposed to. I'm not so sure."]{.underline}

The alliance came to the aid of the US after September 11, the only time
in its history that the defense guarantee has been invoked. Article 5
was invoked after the attacks on the twin towers in 2001, leading
to [Nato's largest operation in
Afghanistan](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/28/nato-ends-afghanistan-combat-operations-after-13-years).
France's military participated in the operation.

Trump on Thursday said he viewed Nato as "potentially good" if what he
saw as the spending issue could be fixed. ["[They're screwing us on
trade]{.mark}," he said of the security alliance.]{.underline}

[Trump's comments denigrating Nato are largely in line with
his [years-long criticism of the
alliance](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/oct/29/if-trump-wins-the-election-nato-can-expect-more-turbulence-ahead),
but they come at a time of heightened concern in the western world over
Trump's cozy relationship with Russian president Vladimir
[Putin]{.mark}, who has [long seen Nato as a
threat]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Trump's aggressive demands, ultimatums, and conditional approach to collective defense are actively undermining NATO's unity and weakening the alliance.

Trump's Policy Toward NATO

Donald [Trump's second presidential term]{.underline} has [posed
fundamental challenges for NATO, raising questions about the alliance's
future role and function]{.underline}. Rather than following a
traditional US-led approach, [the Trump administration has sharply
increased pressure on European allies through specific financial
demands, ultimatums, and political leverage. President Trump has
publicly stated that European countries are not contributing enough to
collective security, forcing the US to bear a disproportionate burden.
This stance reflects Trump's firm belief that NATO's European members
have unfairly benefited from the US security umbrella for
years.]{.underline}

[Trump's critical stance]{.underline} toward NATO is [not
new]{.underline}. [[During the 2016 presidential campaign, he called the
alliance "obsolete," and urged member states to increase their defense
spending]{.underline}](https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN14Z0YO/).
Reports from 2018 indicate that [the [president even privately discussed
the possibility of the US withdrawing from
NATO](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/01/15/politics/trump-nato-us-withdraw/index.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com\),]{.underline}
which was met by a sharp reaction from Washington's political circles.
In response, Congress introduced the ["NATO Support
Act"](https://www.kaine.senate.gov/in-the-news/congress-approves-bill-barring-presidents-from-unilaterally-exiting-nato)
in 2019, which was officially adopted in 2023, stripping the president
of the authority to unilaterally withdraw from the alliance. Yet,
[despite these legislative restrictions, the Trump administration has
persistently continued to pressure its allies.]{.underline}

[Trump's primary objective regarding NATO is to implement his "America
First" doctrine, which seeks to reduce US foreign commitments and
redirect resources toward domestic priorities. [His demand that NATO
members increase defense spending to 5% of GDP far exceeds the
alliance's established 2%
benchmark](http://www.euractiv.com/section/politics/news/trump-says-nato-members-should-spend-5-of-gdp-on-defence),
and is tied to the concept of a ["two-tier
NATO."](http://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2024/07/02/nato-second-trump-term-00164517)
Under this model,]{.underline} US defense guarantees -- particularly
[Article 5]{.underline} of the NATO Charter -- [would apply fully only
to those members that meet Trump's 5% financial requirement. Such an
approach would significantly undermine the alliance's core principle:
collective defense and solidarity among member states.]{.underline}

To increase pressure, [Trump has employed public statements, ultimatums,
and diplomatic leverage. He has repeatedly and explicitly stated that US
support for NATO allies depends on their financial contributions: ["If
they don't pay, I'm not going to defend
them."](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/07/donald-trump-nato-alliance-us-security-support)]{.underline}
Such [rhetoric]{.underline} from the Trump administration [is intended
to immediately compel member states to increase their defense budgets.
The president also frequently refers to "past debts," alluding to the
years when some countries failed to meet NATO's 2% defense spending
target.]{.underline}

Although Trump's policy within NATO has been controversial, his
supporters argue that historically low defense spending by European
countries has placed a disproportionate burden on the United States.
They contend that a fairer distribution of financial responsibilities
will ultimately strengthen the alliance.

However, [the implications of Trump's policies extend beyond financial
debates.]{.underline} [His stance]{.underline} not only [undermines
NATO's unity, but also calls into question its fundamental principles,
particularly the principle of collective defense.]{.underline} The
current [situation compels NATO member states, particularly in Europe,
to reconsider their role in safeguarding Euro-Atlantic
security]{.underline}. Nevertheless, Trump's demand for increased
defense spending is not entirely unfounded, particularly in the context
of the Russia-Ukraine war, which has sharply highlighted vulnerabilities
in Europe's defense infrastructure, underscoring the need for NATO to
strengthen its collective security capabilities. A more balanced
contribution from all member states, both financially and militarily, is
crucial for maintaining transatlantic security. Moreover, increased
defense budgets will enable European nations to strengthen their own
capabilities and assume a more influential role within NATO.

NATO Member States' Reactions and Response Strategies

The Trump administration's tough policy, which demands that NATO member
states significantly increase their defense spending, has elicited a
mixed reaction within the alliance. [By 2024, according to NATO data, 23
countries had met the alliance's 2% GDP
requirement](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_49198.htm),
accounting for about 75% of its members. However, [eight countries --
Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Italy, Luxembourg, Portugal, Slovenia, and
Spain -- still fall short of this benchmark.]{.underline} At the same
time, [the Trump administration continues to pressure members to
allocate 5% of their GDP to defense -- a target that many experts
consider unrealistic. This requirement poses significant challenges not
only due to the economic burden, which would be particularly difficult
for countries with extensive social programs, but also because the
[European defense industry lacks the capacity to rapidly absorb such a
large influx of financial
resources](https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/03/06/nato-5-percent-defense-spending-trump-russia-ukraine/).
Insufficient production capabilities and a shortage of skilled personnel
make it hard to efficiently convert such high levels of spending into
tangible military capabilities within a short timeframe.]{.underline}
Despite these challenges, European NATO members are pursuing various
strategic measures to enhance their security.

[Eastern European states, such as Poland and the Baltic countries
(Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania), have traditionally relied on NATO and
the United States as primary defense guarantors, largely due to the
security threat posed by Russia.]{.underline} This reliance is reflected
in a significant increase in defense spending. For instance[, Poland had
raised its defense budget to 4.12% of GDP by 2024, and plans to increase
it further to
4.7%](https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-backs-trump-calls-to-ramp-up-nato-defense-spending/),
making it one of the highest among NATO members. [Lithuania and Estonia
have announced plans to allocate more than 5% of GDP to defense spending
starting in
2025](https://kyivindependent.com/lithuania-estonia-pledge-5-defense-spending-following-trumps-call-ft-reports/).
[Latvia maintained its defense budget at 3.2% of GDP in
2024.](https://www.mod.gov.lv/en/about-us/defence-budget) Beyond
financial contributions, Eastern European countries actively cooperate
with the US through bilateral military agreements, which include joint
military exercises and, in some cases, an increased US military presence
on their territory.

Western European countries take a more complex approach. France is a
leading advocate for strengthening the European Union's defense
autonomy. The Macron administration actively supports EU-led initiatives
such as [Permanent Structured
Cooperation](https://www.pesco.europa.eu/about/) (PESCO) and the
[European Defense
Fund](https://defence-industry-space.ec.europa.eu/eu-defence-industry/european-defence-fund-edf-official-webpage-european-commission_en~)
(EDF), which aim to enhance Europe's military capabilities. Although
these initiatives operate outside the NATO framework, France remains
committed to the alliance and acknowledges its crucial role in
collective security. The ["ReArm
Europe"](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/sv/statement_25_673)
initiative, backed by European Commission President Ursula von der
Leyen, also serves this purpose, focusing on joint arms procurement and
the development of military technologies.

[Germany]{.underline}, while agreeing to increase its defense budget,
[has adopted a more cautious approach.]{.underline} The country is still
working toward meeting the 2% target, but Defense Minister Boris
Pistorius has emphasized that [[increasing spending should not be an end
in itself: the key priority is ensuring that funds are used
effectively.]{.underline}](https://www.rferl.org/a/nato-defense-spending-trump-pistorius-spruds-pevkur/33270627.html) Discussions
on additional mechanisms for defense financing are ongoing, including a
proposal by Friedrich Merz to mobilize an additional one trillion
euros [through domestic debt to strengthen the country's defense
capabilities](https://www.euronews.com/business/2025/03/05/germany-to-ease-government-debt-limits-to-boost-economy-and-defence-spending).
Like France, Germany is actively participating in the EU's "ReArm
Europe" initiative, which [requires member states to allocate an
additional €800 billion for defense
needs.](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/sv/statement_25_673) Beyond
financial commitments, Berlin is also prioritizing cooperation. This
includes [deepening military integration with the Netherlands under
structured cooperation agreements, and contributing to the development
of a European drone
project.](https://eda.europa.eu/news-and-events/news/2025/02/05/eda-promotes-military-drone-use-in-shared-airspace-with-german-dutch-flight)

Hungary and Turkey are pursuing distinct strategies. [Hungary, with [its
military budget projected to reach 2.11% of GDP by
2024,](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2024/6/pdf/240617-def-exp-2024-en.pdf)
places little faith in EU defense initiatives,]{.underline} and instead
prioritizes cooperation with the United States. [Turkey, while
[maintaining defense spending at 2.09% of
GDP](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2024/6/pdf/240617-def-exp-2024-en.pdf),
remains a committed NATO member, but is also striving to assert itself
as an independent regional power- an ambition that has occasionally led
to tensions within the alliance.]{.underline}

[NATO-EU cooperation remains fraught with challenges]{.underline}. While
both organizations strive to strengthen security collaboration, certain
[contradictions complicate their coordination. A key issue is the
duplication of defense projects, which leads to inefficient resource use
and overlap. Additionally, differing policies among member states often
lead to conflicting priorities.]{.underline}

Russia plays a significant role in shaping Europe's defense policy. [The
Russia-Ukraine war has reaffirmed the critical importance of unity among
NATO members.]{.underline} [Meanwhile, statements from the Trump
administration questioning NATO's reliability have **deepened concerns**
among European allies. The potential revision of the principle of
collective defense and the administration's tough rhetoric on defense
spending have forced EU member states to reconsider their security
policies. As a result, Europe is increasingly striving for military
independence, as seen in the strengthening of PESCO and the EDF.
However, these initiatives fall short of replacing the security
guarantees provided by NATO, leaving member states with a difficult
dilemma: how to maintain strategic ties with the alliance while
simultaneously ensuring greater defense autonomy.]{.underline}

Conclusion

Donald [Trump's second presidential term]{.underline} is shaping up to
be a [critical phase for NATO, bringing new challenges to the alliance's
unity and operations.]{.underline} The US administration's demands for a
sharp increase in defense spending, pressure in the form of ultimatums,
and the conditionality of collective defense are significantly reshaping
transatlantic relations.

European allies are responding in different ways: Eastern European
states remain reliant on US security guarantees, while Western Europe is
increasingly focused on strategic autonomy. Meanwhile, internal
disagreements within NATO raise fundamental questions about the
alliance's future: Can NATO adapt to the evolving security landscape,
and how will US-European relations unfold in this new reality?

In this context, NATO's future prospects involve several possible
scenarios. One option remains the increase of defense spending by
European allies, which would help maintain stability within the alliance
by meeting the demands of the US. Another potential direction is the
differentiation of security obligations between NATO member countries,
where the US would offer firm support only to those allies who meet
specific financial criteria. Ultimately, [the parallel strengthening of
the European security system, such as the development of PESCO and other
initiatives, may emerge as an alternative security model for
NATO.]{.underline}

Regardless of the path NATO takes, [pressure from the Trump
administration has already forced European members to reassess their
security policies and consider strengthening their independent defense
capabilities. This suggests that NATO's future will be shaped not only
by US political decisions, but also by Europe's collective response and
strategic actions.]{.underline}

#### U.S. threats of withdrawal weaken NATO unity, eroding trust in American commitments and inviting adversarial escalation.

On July 29, 2020, [Secretary of Defense Mark
Esper](https://www.c-span.org/video/?474327-1/defense-secretary-esper-announces-11900-troops-withdraw-germany) announced
the withdrawal of 11,900 US military personnel from Germany. This plan
proposed to send roughly half of those troops back to the United States,
while the rest would be redistributed around Europe. Secretary Esper
explained that the troop movements were part of a broader military
reorganization, but [President
Trump](https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/07/29/pentagon-trump-troop-withdrawal-germany-punishment/) countered
that claim by linking the reason for the withdrawal of troops to
Germany's ["delinquent"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ytK7I52Lag) payments
to NATO. He noted that Germany had yet to meet the [2014 Wales
Pledge](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_112964.htm) to
spend two percent of its GDP on defense. [The Trump administration has
used this troop withdrawal to pressure US allies to contribute more to
the alliance or face the prospect of declining US commitments to Europe.
While the Trump administration's pressure will increase defense spending
among European allies who fear a complete US withdrawal, it will also
degrade the deterrence offered by the United States' security
obligations to the alliance.]{.underline}

The Trump administration has threatened NATO allies to the point that
they fear the United States may withdraw from the organization or not
fulfill its obligations to Article V unless the allies meet the
objective of spending two percent of their GDP on defense. [Past
administrations](https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/04/politics/trump-us-presidents-nato-defense-spending/index.html) have
called for NATO allies to contribute more to the alliance for decades.
However, they have never called into question the US commitment to
Europe. Yet, this pressure has forced the European allies to start
taking greater ownership of their security at the cost of warm relations
with the United States as seen through [allied leader's
statements](https://www.rferl.org/a/france-says-eu-should-not-rely-us-military-defense-reach-out-russia/29456958.html).

[In order to pressure allies, the United States has to send costly
signals, such as withdrawing troops from Europe, to demonstrate that
their security interests have diverged. This political pressure acts as
a forceful method to motivate NATO allies to do more because it provides
a credible threat of exclusion from the benefits of US
protection]{.underline}. Within NATO, only the United States maintains
and controls the conventional and nuclear capacity to deter and defend
against existential threats to the alliance. No other ally has the
expeditionary military capacity to do so. For example, Estonia is not
worried about being abandoned by Romania, Portugal, or
even [Germany](https://www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2018/08/09/why-germanys-army-is-in-a-bad-state),
knowing none of them could bring a sizable military force to bear in
response to a Russian invasion or *fait accompli*. In this case,
Estonia's chief concern revolves around the United States' guarantee of
their sovereignty through NATO. Suppose the United States can make
credible claims that it is willing to abandon an ally and not fulfill
its treaty obligations. In that case, the ally will experience a drastic
incentive to increase its military capabilities to defend itself.

[It may seem that these tensions and fears will only lead to negative
outcomes, but some disunity within an alliance can yield positive
results.]{.underline} [Several
articles](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10242690302924?needAccess=true) researching
the implications of free-riding and burdening-sharing in alliances have
supported this notion. In [Olson and
Zeckhauser](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1927082?casa_token=LNnMkX9AICMAAAAA%2525253AeEvi83ZoGnUTlEYpdVE2BFCN6VcWckfyrA7bsKjl5t6nLMRrj5pID97p13-d-Anh4WwfqtbRkXF4EiNREDpdbEa5qdzHThxqJR8mvSvvWe0vdGHclzXA&seq=1%23metadata_info_tab_contents)'s seminal
article on burden-sharing, they wrote, "This fact leads to the
paradoxical conclusion that a decline in the amity, unity, and community
of interest among allies need not necessarily reduce the effectiveness
of an alliance..." and "The United States, at least, should perhaps not
hope for too much unity in common ventures with other nations. It might
prove extremely expensive." Similarly, [Plumper and
Neumayer](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0738894214522916) note
in reference to the smaller allies (non-US allies), "Unless the
interests of alliance members are independent, the existence of NATO
allows the smaller allies to free-ride to some extent."

Moreover, the breakdown of unity in the alliance caused by the Trump
administration demands has compelled European allies to take a larger
role in their defense. The former [German Ambassador to the United
States, Peter Wittig](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTkLcV334pU),
described the Trump administration's approach as a "healthy wakeup call
for the Europeans...to not free-ride." [Currently, the leaders of NATO
member-states feel they cannot rely on the United States as the sole
guarantor of Europe's security.]{.underline} Back in 2017, [[German
Chancellor Angela
Merkel](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/28/merkel-says-eu-cannot-completely-rely-on-us-and-britain-any-more-g7-talks) stated,
"We Europeans truly have to take our fate into our own hands" and, "We
can't rely on the [superpower of the United
States](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-Merkel-usa/Merkel-says-europe-cant-rely-on-u-s-to-impose-world-order-idUSKBN1KA1F9)."]{.underline} A
year later, [French President Emmanuel
Macron](https://www.cnn.com/2018/08/27/europe/macron-eu-security-intl/index.html) reinforced
this sentiment declaring, "It is up to us today to take our
responsibilities and guarantee our own security, and thus have European
sovereignty." More recently, in response to the planned troop withdrawal
announced this past summer, the [German Defense Minister Annegret
Kramp-Karrenbauer](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2020/08/02/german-defense-minister-planned-us-troop-withdrawal-regrettable/) called
the move "regrettable" and noted, "The truth is that a good life in
Germany and Europe depends more and more on how we ensure our security
ourselves."

[These responses from European leaders show that startling allies into
thinking the United States will abandon them has influenced allies to
increase defense spending in line with the [2014 Wales
Pledge](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_112964.htm).
However, in the long term, NATO policymaking should employ a balanced
approach. If the United States brings its security guarantee of the
alliance too much into question, Russia or other states may take action
to test the United States' resolve.]{.underline} During the Cold War, US
leaders continually reaffirmed their commitment to allies, effectively
deterring a Soviet invasion. Deterrence works best when allies clearly
express their mutual obligations to all actors on the international
stage.

The experience of the United Kingdom and Germany leading up to World War
I provides an example of how the United Kingdom's lack of a solid
commitment to its allies allowed German leaders to think the British
would stand aside in the war. [Barbara
Tuchman](https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=92J9wTgKBOMC&oi=fnd&pg=PR7&dq=Guns+of+August&ots=mOLWViY-lK&sig=TOaFasP065_hkRLQIjryq6MJ6PI%23v=onepage&q=Guns%25252520of%25252520August&f=false) details
this situation in her book *The Guns of August*. The failure of King
George V and the UK Foreign Secretary to give a definite guarantee of
joining the war should Germany invade allowed the Kaiser to think that
he could attack without a British intervention. If the British had made
a direct declaration of support for its allies, German leadership might
have decided against escalating the war. This case gives policymakers an
idea of what could happen if the United States does not maintain a firm
commitment to its NATO allies. US leaders must watch how far they allow
the US commitment to NATO wane in competitors' eyes or risk possible
adventurism on the eastern flank of NATO.

What do these two conflicting options mean for US policymakers? If the
United States wants allies to meet the defense spending requirements, it
needs them to fear the possibility that the United States may abandon
them because their interests no longer align. [The allies will only fear
abandonment if the United States sends costly signals to them, such as
troop withdrawals.]{.underline} As of 2020, the [majority of
allies](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2020/10/pdf/pr-2020-104-en.pdf) that
meet the elusive two percent spending goal sit on NATO's eastern flank,
fearing Russia and desiring US protection. Nevertheless, [spending
across the
alliance](https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/2020/10/pdf/pr-2020-104-en.pdf) has
increased since 2014, in part, due to the Trump administration's
application of political pressure calling into doubt US interests in
Europe. However, in the medium- and long-term, threatening to abandon
allies will decrease the appearance of US security guarantees and invite
competitors to push boundaries.

[Policymakers must balance the coercion needed to increase contributions
of European allies by making them question US intentions, but not
distance the United States to the point that it jeopardizes the alliance
or the deterrence that the US military power provides.]{.underline} A
snapshot of one such policy could involve pulling a significant number
of permanently stationed US forces from Europe, while reassuring US
commitments to its allies through rotational deployments (not of equal
number to the withdrawal) in support of NATO's Enhanced Forward Presence
and other operations. [This concept aims to incentivize allies to build
up military strength for initial deterrence and defense on the continent
with the backing of US security guarantees, but lacking the tangible
comfort drawn from a large permanent US force presence.]{.underline}
With the probability that the incoming [Biden
administration](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-nato-amity-sparks-debate-among-european-allies-11606559627) will
quickly mend relations in Europe, it runs the risk of reversing the
current trend of increasing defense spending across the alliance and
fostering free-riding. [The United States should not go running back
into the arms of the Europeans. Rather, it should maintain blunt
political pressure on the Europeans to do more while ensuring its
commitment to its allies remains clear to NATO's potential
adversaries.]{.underline}

As the NATO summit approaches on June 24 25, 2025, European and Canadian
leaders are being pressured by US President Donald Trump and, more
recently, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, to spend at least 5 percent
of gross domestic product (GDP) on defense to boost their contributions
to the alliance. At this point, the bulk of the 32 alliance members have
met the 2023 agreement that member countries spend at least 2 percent of
GDP on national defense budgets, and they seem to be nearing agreement
to approve the higher levels this year. According to Rutte, this
increase is important because, [[We all benefit from the protection
our]{.mark} transatlantic [alliance provides]{.mark}]{.underline}. And
it is vital that every member of NATO pulls their weight. Because
America has carried too much of the burden for too long.

[While [Americans]{.mark} would likely [welcome increased burden sharing
from allies]{.mark}]{.underline}, Chicago Council on Global Affairs
polling over the past 50 years has found consistent support for NATO. A
more recent joint Chicago Council-Ipsos poll, fielded May 30 June 1,
2025, finds Americans widely acknowledge the benefits US alliances bring
to the United States and its allies. [O[n NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}
[specifically, [bipartisan majorities continue to support the
alliance]{.mark},]{.underline} though there is a considerable enthusiasm
gap between Democrats and Republicans.

Key Findings

• [[A]{.mark} solid [majority of Americans think US alliances are
beneficial to the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} and its
allies (61%, up from 51% in 2024) or mostly benefit the United States
alone (11% compared to 13% in 2024).

• Three in four (74%) favor maintaining or increasing the US commitment
to NATO. While majorities across political affiliations express support,
2 the difference between Democrats (91%) and Republicans (59%) on the
question has reached an all-time high in Council polling dating back to
1974.

• [Nearly [six in 10]{.mark} overall [say NATO makes the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [safer]{.mark}]{.underline} (57%) compared to just 8
percent who say less safe (33% say it makes no difference).

• Republican hesitation toward alliances could be linked to perceptions
of limited freedom to maneuver. Only 38 percent of Republicans believe
the United States should make international decisions collectively with
its allies if this means Washington might have to compromise. A majority
of the overall public, however, agrees with this tradeoff (60%).

Increased Majorities Say Alliances Are Beneficial to the United States

June is an - month for President Trump. He recently met with new German
Chancellor Friedrich Merz, attended the G7 summit at a Canadian ski
resort, and is scheduled to attend the NATO summit in the Netherlands in
close succession. The dialogues come as the Trump administration has
imposed tariffs on many friendly countries and as Trump himself
continues to make efforts to build ties with the Kremlin resulting in
new strains for transatlantic relations.

For their part, everyday [Americans believe US alliances are beneficial
not just to allies but also to the United States.]{.underline} Of the
overall public, seven in 10 combined (72%) think security alliances
benefit the United States and allies (61%) or mostly benefit the United
States (11%). This majority represents an increase over the past year,
when 64 percent perceived mutual or US benefit. Additionally, the sense
that alliances are beneficial has increased across all partisan
groupings. Eight in 10 Democrats (83%, up from 74% in 2024), seven in 10
Independents (69%, up from 62%) and six in 10 Republicans (63%, up from
55%) believe alliances provide mutual benefits or mostly benefit the
United States)

[[Bipartisan Majorities Support Continuing Commitment to
NATO]{.mark}]{.underline}

While alliances in general are now viewed as even more beneficial than
before, Trumps skepticism about NATO may have influenced GOP attitudes
toward that alliance specifically.

Overall, a combined three in four Americans (74%) favor maintaining
(48%) or increasing (25%) US support for NATO, similar to readings going
back to 2002. As has been true in Council polls since 1998, Democrats
appear to be the most enthusiastic backers of the NATO alliance, with
nine in 10 supporting 4 maintaining or increasing the US commitment
(91%). Seven in 10 Independents (70%) feel the same way, similar to
their views over the past two decades.

[While [a majority of Republicans also endorse the US commitment to
NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} (59%), this share has dropped 9 percentage
points since last year to its lowest level yet on record for Chicago
Council surveys. The combination of declining Republican support and
growing Democratic support has led to an ever widening partisan gap on
America's NATO commitment, which today stands at a record 32 percentage
points.

This week NATO will mark its first 76 years at its summit in The Hague.
All eyes will be on [Donald [Trump]{.mark} and his robust "[America
First" approach]{.mark} on the world stage, which has already involved
the use of decisive military force against Iran's nuclear facilities.
The U.S. president has been a firm critic of NATO, but has also been
[responsible for a dramatic revival of the
alliance.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Trump]{.underline} has [made it clear that [NATO's survival depends
on]{.mark} America's fellow [members]{.mark} stepping up to fully
participate in [burden sharing with the U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline} The
[Russians]{.underline} have clearly [viewed NATO as weak and divided and
are increasingly willing to test its resolve. The U.S. presidency must
apply concerted pressure on America's allies to do far more to foster
partnership rather than dependency, especially as the United States must
[increasingly focus on]{.mark} the immense [threat in]{.mark} the
[Indo-Pacific]{.mark} presented [by Communist
China.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In 2024, only [22 NATO members spent the 2 per cent of GDP on defense
agreed to by the alliance in 2014.]{.underline} This is unacceptable. It
[leaves the [alliance dangerously vulnerable]{.mark} when it should be
projecting strength and resolve.]{.underline} Countries that spent less
than 2 per cent of real GDP on defense last
year [included](https://www.statista.com/chart/14636/defense-expenditures-of-nato-countries/) Italy
(1.5 per cent), Canada (1.4 per cent), Spain (1.3 per cent), and Belgium
(1.3 per cent). In contrast, Poland (4.1 per cent), Estonia (3.4 per
cent), Latvia (3.2 per cent), and Greece (3.1 per cent) all spent above
3 per cent of GDP.

Burden
Sharing](https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/natos-underspending-problem-americas-allies-must-embrace-fair-burden-sharing)

Justin Trudeau's now departed [[Canadian government]{.underline}]{.mark}
was among the very worst NATO slackers, consistently underinvesting in
Canada's military with shockingly low figures for a nation with the
10^th^ largest GDP in the world. His successor as prime minister, Mark
Carney, has vowed to raise Canadian defense spending to 2 per cent, but
this is simply [[not enough]{.mark}. Ottawa needs to be serious about
NATO's mission, and playing a full part in the alliance in the coming
decades.]{.underline}

As Heritage Foundation research [has
shown](https://www.heritage.org/defense/report/natos-underspending-problem-americas-allies-must-embrace-fair-burden-sharing)[,
"[European NATO members]{.mark} have collectively [underfunded]{.mark}
their own [defense]{.mark} by [\$827.91 billion]{.mark} since
2014---nearly equal to the entire annual U.S. defense
budget."]{.underline} This is a staggering figure---a damning indictment
of a culture of complacency and dependency in many NATO allies over the
past decade.

Not only should every NATO member immediately invest the minimum agreed
level of spending on their own defense, they should also commit to
matching the current U.S. level of 3.5 per cent of GDP, and pledge to
reach 5 per cent of GDP, which is expected to be the new benchmark set
at the forthcoming NATO summit according to NATO Secretary General Mark
Rutte.

President [Trump's pressure on NATO partners to spend more on defense is
already having a major impact.]{.underline} After decades of reckless
underinvestment, [[Germany]{.underline}]{.mark}, the world's
fourth-largest economy and the biggest in Europe, [has announced [plans
for]{.mark} a dramatic [increase in defense spending]{.mark}, and has
accepted in principle that German spending must eventually [rise to 5
per cent of GDP if it is serious about defending its own borders
from]{.mark} a potential attack by [Russia.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[France]{.underline}]{.mark}, which has barely reached the agreed
minimum 2 per cent of GDP on defense in recent years, [has announced
that it will [push European defense spending levels to 3-3.5 per
cent]{.mark} of GDP ahead of the Hague summit]{.underline}. Even
[[Belgium]{.underline}]{.mark}, one of NATO's most lackluster members,
has [declared it will [boost defense spending to 3.5 per cent of
GDP.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The [[UK]{.underline}]{.mark} has just [[announced]{.underline}]{.mark}
a \$[[20 billion investment in its nuclear warhead program, and]{.mark}
the construction of [12 nuclear-powered attack
submarines]{.mark},]{.underline} as part of its new Strategic Defense
Review, released this month.

The [[Baltic States and Poland]{.underline}]{.mark} are already
[building]{.underline} on their robust [records by [pledging significant
further increases]{.mark} in the years ahead]{.underline}. Poland will
spend 4.7 per cent of GDP on defense this year, while Estonia has
committed to spending 5.4 per cent through until 2029. Lithuania will
spend 5-6 per cent on defense from 2026 to 2030, and Latvia will spend 5
per cent by 2026.

[With bold U.S. leadership at the helm, [NATO]{.mark} still has the

5]{.mark} of the alliance's treaty.]{.underline}

["If I didn't stand with it, I wouldn't be here,"]{.underline} Trump

Article 5 of NATO's founding treaty states that an attack on one member
of the alliance is considered an attack on all members. The only time
Article 5 has been invoked was in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001,
attacks on U.S. soil.

[The defense pact has been back in the spotlight after Russia's 2022
invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}, with NATO members arguing Article 5
could serve as a deterrent against further Russian aggression.

gradual [reduction of nuclear arsenals]{.mark} that began after the Cold
War [is]{.mark} now [over]{.mark}.]{.underline} In contrast[, all
[nuclear]{.mark}-armed [states pursued]{.mark} in 2024 a [strategy of
**modernization**, **expansion**, or **innovation**]{.mark} in their
nuclear capabilities. This [return to nuclear competition]{.mark}
coincides with the [weakening]{.mark} of [arms control]{.mark}
frameworks, with no immediate prospects for replacement.]{.underline}

The report records an estimated total of 12,241 nuclear warheads as of 1
January 2025, of which 9,614 are in military stockpiles and 3,912 are
deployed on operational delivery systems. Around 2,100 warheads are
maintained at high operational alert, mainly by the United States and
Russia. SIPRI also notes that China may now keep some warheads mounted
on missiles during peacetime.

Modernization covers all components of the nuclear triads. In the United
States, programs to replace the [Minuteman

intercontinental ballistic missile experienced another failure in 2024,
and several other systems are delayed. Still, [plans to reload
silos]{.mark} and increase warhead counts per missile remain
intact.]{.underline}

[[China]{.mark} is [undergoing]{.mark} the **[fastest
expansion]{.mark}**. Its arsenal increased from 500 to around 600
warheads within a year, and it has completed or nearly completed
construction of more than 300 new ICBM silos across desert and
mountainous regions]{.underline}. At this pace, [China [could possess
**1,500** warheads by **2035**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The country is
actively developing multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle
(MIRV) capabilities and continues to enhance its dual-capable naval and
airborne systems.

The United Kingdom did not expand its stockpile in 2024 but remains on a
growth trajectory laid out in the 2023 Integrated Review Refresh. London
is moving forward with the construction of four new SSBNs. France
continues to develop its third-generation SSBN and a new air-launched
cruise missile, while upgrading the payload of its M51 ballistic
missile.

India has continued the development of MIRV-capable canisterized
missiles, which can be transported with mated warheads and may remain on
alert. Pakistan is expanding fissile material production and delivery
systems, suggesting continued growth[. [North Korea]{.mark} now
[holds]{.mark} an estimated [50]{.mark} assembled [warheads]{.mark} and
the fissile material for **40 more**.]{.underline} It is advancing its
doctrine of tactical deterrence and preparing to introduce theater
nuclear weapons, according to South Korean sources.

Israel, while maintaining its policy of deliberate ambiguity, tested a
propulsion system in 2024 that may be related to the Jericho missile
series. Upgrades were also reported at the Dimona plutonium production
site.

SIPRI highlights a concerning doctrinal shift. In November 2024, Russia
revised its nuclear posture to broaden the scenarios in which it might
use nuclear weapons. The United States replaced its forward-deployed B61
bombs in Europe with modernized versions. The report also notes that
[[MIRV]{.mark}-capable [systems]{.mark}, once limited to the five
NPT-recognized nuclear weapon states, are now [being]{.mark} [developed
or deployed by China, India, Pakistan, and North
Korea.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Emerging [technologies]{.mark} are [introducing]{.mark} new
**[uncertainties]{.mark}**. Warhead miniaturization, developments in
artificial intelligence, automated command and control, cyber defense,
and space warfare are reshaping deterrence architectures]{.underline}.
Several states are investing in long-range maneuverable missiles,
antisatellite weapons, and hypersonic glide vehicles. These advancements
may shorten decision-making timelines and increase the risk of
miscalculation or accidental use.

The SIPRI Yearbook 2025 concludes that [the [global nuclear
order]{.mark} is [entering]{.mark} a [phase of **increased strategic**
**instability**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The anticipated expiration of the
New START treaty in 2026, with no replacement in sight, could trigger an
unregulated cycle of warhead deployments, including rapid silo
reactivation and submarine reloads. For armed forces and defense
industries, these developments imply renewed attention to second-strike
capabilities, the resilience of command-and-control systems, and the
flexibility permitted under evolving nuclear doctrines.

A second set of security arguments focuses on the number of great powers
and the intensity of competition among them. While the nuclear
nonproliferation regime was born under bipolarity, it was strengthened
and has, in many respects, thrived under unipolarity after the end of
the Cold War. North Korea is the only country to have acquired nuclear
weapons in the post-Cold War era,16 a much slower pace of proliferation
than experienced during the Cold War. According to Monteiro and Debs,
[unipolarity facilitated nonproliferation by improving the security
environment and making it easier for the US to prevent the spread of
nuclear weapons through coercive means]{.underline}.17 Even within
bipolarity, nonproliferation was more successful in the second half of
the Cold War when the intensity of great power competition was lower,
thus facilitating superpower cooperation in preventing the spread of
nuclear weapons.18

These arguments suggest [[proliferation]{.mark} is [likely to be on the
rise]{.mark}, as [unipolarity]{.mark} appears to be **[on the way
out]{.mark}**---if it is not over already---and [competition between the
US]{.mark} on the one hand and [Russia and China]{.mark} on the other
has **markedly [intensified]{.mark}**]{.underline}.19 According to
Gibbons and Herzog[, "As tensions among the US, Russia, and China **run
high**, it will be **[difficult]{.mark}** for them [to cooperate
on]{.mark} expanding membership and [enforcing]{.mark} the
\[[nonproliferation]{.mark}\] regime's constituent
agreements."]{.underline}20 Brewer et al. likewise argue that enhanced
great power competition could result in "widening gaps in \[great
power\] perceptions of what is 'good' for international security" and
note that [the US, Russia, and/or China might be tempted to **[look the
other way]{.mark}** in particular cases of proliferation in order to
protect alliance relationships,21 much like the US did with Pakistan in
the 1980s.]{.underline} For instance, would Russia or China really be
willing to turn the screws on Iran if they decided to cross the nuclear
threshold in this geopolitical environment? The same question could be
asked about the US vis-à-vis Saudi Arabia or South Korea if they started
their own bomb program, a point this paper will return to later.

The total number of nuclear weapons around the world has decreased
considerably in comparison with the global arsenals after the end of the
Cold War. But scientists say there are still enough nukes to cause
devastating destruction to the planet if they are used.

released on March 4, revealed that there is a total of 12,331 nuke
warheads in the inventory of the nine nuclear weapon states. The yield
of all these payloads combined would be equivalent to 146,605 times the
destructive impact of the 15-kiloton bomb, Little Boy, that the United
States dropped on Hiroshima in 1945.

The monitor is published by Norwegian People's Aid with the Federation
of American Scientists. It gives the annual update on the number of
nuclear warheads worldwide and the size of the nuclear arsenals of each
of the nine nuclear-armed states. It also monitors compliance with the

beginning to [argue]{.mark} that [you need **more**]{.mark}. So we have
to be careful here."]{.underline}

Kristensen was speaking at a press briefing during the [third meeting of
the states parties to the
TPNW](https://passblue.com/2025/03/05/activists-seize-the-momentum-to-finally-eliminate-nukes/),
held March 3 to 10 at the United Nations headquarters in New York City.

Russia and the US have the largest stockpiles of nuclear warheads in the
world, with 4,299 and 3,700 missiles ready for use, respectively. This
is the aggregate number of  nuclear warheads already mounted on
ballistic missiles or co-located with their respective launch platforms
and those in reserves.

The monitor said that [[although]{.mark} the [overall number]{.mark} of
nuclear weapons globally [has been reduced]{.mark}, the
[available]{.mark} [stockpile]{.mark} of nuclear warheads [has been
steadily rising]{.mark} since 2017. There are now [9,604]{.mark}
ready-to-use [warheads]{.mark} in the world. The total increase in the
last eight years is 332.]{.underline}

As of January, China's total warheads has increased to 600, followed by
France with 290; Britain with 225; India, 180; Pakistan, 170; Israel,
90; and North Korea, 50.

["The [era of nuclear reductions]{.mark} is now
[over]{.mark},"]{.underline} Kristensen said. The uptick is related to
the increase of land-based intercontinental launcher silos for nuclear
weapon systems by China, India, North Korea, Pakistan and Russia. [China
had at least 350 silo-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, or
ICBMs, under construction in 2024, according to the B[ulletin of Atomic
Scientists](https://thebulletin.org/premium/2024-01/chinese-nuclear-weapons-2024/#:~:text=The%20350%20new%20Chinese%20silos%20under%20construction,about%20how%20many%20ICBMs%20China%20currently%20operates.).]{.underline}
An ICBM enables a country to launch nuclear warheads or conventional
weapons exceeding a 3,418-mile range.

For context, Russia has an ICBM with a range of approximately 6,835 to
7,456 miles, which could reach as far as South Africa in the continent,
Australia in the Pacific and Argentina in South America. China, on the
other hand, can launch a nuclear warhead or other bombs able to reach
Japan, Türkiye, Saudi Arabia and numerous other countries within its
3,418 mile radius --- and more.

Meanwhile, the recent political tensions between the US and Ukraine are
sowing doubts about Washington being a reliable ally to Europe under the
administration of President Donald Trump. On March, 3, he temporarily
suspended all US military aid to Ukraine, after a media blow-up in the
White House between him and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine as
well as Vice President JD Vance. Although Ukraine is not a member of
NATO, many European countries consider Russia's illegal invasion of
Ukraine in February 2022 a serious potential threat to regional
security.

Trump has openly suggested that the US might not honor [Article
5](https://www.nato.int/cps/bu/natohq/topics_110496.htm) of the NATO
alliance as a member if other allies do not meet their defense spending
obligations. Under the collective defense article, if an ally is
attacked, each and every other member of NATO must take the actions it
deems necessary to assist the ally assaulted.

Trump's rhetoric on the matter began during his first presidency, and he
has since intensified his demand in the initial months of his current
term. His stance, reiterated amid recent talks of Ukraine agreeing to a
possible peace deal with Russia, has sent shockwaves across European
capitals, raising concerns about whether the US remains a reliable
security partner.

[Grethe Lauglo Ostern](https://vienna.icanw.org/grethe_lauglo_ostern),
the editor of the Nuclear Weapons Ban Monitor, said in an email that
[the notion of [nuclear deterrence]{.mark} used by the US [has been only
a **promise**]{.mark}, and the same goes with France and Britain, the
two European nuclear powers.]{.underline} If that is the case, the
deterrence rationale does not solve the security problem in the region
posed by Russia's war in Ukraine. (In the latest news, Italy has
proposed that Article 5 protection be granted to Ukraine without it
becoming a NATO member.)

[Susi Snyder](https://www.icanw.org/susi_snyder_media), the program
coordinator at the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons
([ICAN](https://www.icanw.org/)), said in an email to PassBlue that
[Europe should engage in diplomacy instead of discussing the possibility
of using French and British nuclear weapons to replace the US nuclear
umbrella. Historically, France has maintained an independent nuclear
deterrent and resisted integrating its arsenal into NATO's
umbrella.]{.underline}

Similarly, in Britain, a debate is emerging over whether to expand its
nuclear abilities. The country relies solely on its Trident
submarine-based nuclear deterrent, having phased out air-delivered and
tactical nuclear weapons in past decades.

Nuclear weapons programs require significant time and resources,
however. Kristensen said that even if European countries decide to
enhance their nuclear abilities, developing weapons and delivery systems
could take a decade or more. [The [debate]{.mark} itself [signals
a]{.mark} major [shift away from]{.mark} the global movement for
[**disarmament** and **nonproliferation**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Ostern, on her part, said the lack of discussion about the grave
consequences of nuclear escalation --- both in human loss and
environmental devastation --- is even more troubling. Europe risks
undermining the TPNW and increasing the likelihood of nuclear
confrontation with its renewed push for nuclear deterrence. The region,
she said, should focus on smarter defense with weapons that are not
capable of mass destruction and that can be used in accordance with the
laws of war.

["The European leaders talking about the need for France and Britain to
use nuclear weapons in Europe on their behalf . . . are failing their
citizens because the true security interest of Europeans lies in nuclear
**disarmament**,"]{.underline} Snyder said.

These acts [have [undermined nuclear diplomacy]{.mark} and risk
[fuelling]{.mark} a new wave of **[proliferation]{.mark}** of nuclear
weapons [in the Middle East and globally.
]{.mark}]{.underline}[The]{.mark} ceasefire announced overnight must be
respected in full to restore stability and space for diplomacy.

[We are [**extremely concerned** about]{.mark} the [loss of
oversight]{.mark} over Iran's stockpiles of enriched uranium in light of
the US strikes.]{.underline} We reaffirm the critical role of the
International Atomic Energy Agency, and that nuclear facilities should
never be targeted under any circumstances.

[All [parties should commit to upholding]{.mark} a full [ceasefire and
refrain from]{.mark} any further unilateral [military]{.mark}
[action]{.mark} or retaliatory attacks. Over the past week, we have been
confronted by the alarming risk that the collapse of the Iranian state
could result in fissile material ending up in the hands of terrorists
and other non-state actors, with potentially disastrous
consequences.]{.underline}

**[Diplomacy]{.underline}** has always presented the most
[effective]{.underline} path [towards ensuring that Iran does not become
a nuclear state.]{.underline} This was exemplified by the JCPOA (Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action), which was effectively constraining Iran's
nuclear programme prior to President Trump's unilateral withdrawal in
2018[. Immediately prior to Israel's attack, Iran and the USA were
engaged in negotiations to exchange long-term restrictions on Iran's
nuclear programme for sanctions relief.]{.underline}

The [recent military strikes are unlikely to significantly set back
Iran's nuclear capabilities in the long-term.]{.underline} On the
contrary, they may push the Iranian leadership into a decision to
actively pursue nuclear weapons that it has not yet taken. We urge Iran
not to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and to
continue to allow IAEA access.

[All sides should seize the opportunity presented by the fragile
ceasefire agreement to return to dialogue, underpinned by international
law, to find a sustainable way out of the current crisis. It is equally
vital that this crisis does not distract political leaders from working
to end the Gaza war, Russia's ongoing war on Ukraine, and other
conflicts around the world.]{.underline}

#### Israeli and U.S. attacks on Iran could either spur or stop nuclear proliferation, depending on whether Iran fully abandons its program or doubles down after the strikes.

Will the Israeli and U.S. attacks spur or impede proliferation?

Many commentators have asserted that the [Israeli and U.S. [attacks
against Iranian]{.mark} nuclear [facilities]{.mark} will [have]{.mark}
[profound implications]{.mark} for future efforts to prevent additional
states from acquiring nuclear weapons. But they differ on whether the
[attacks]{.mark} will [spur]{.mark} or impede
[proliferation]{.mark}.]{.underline}

According to some analysts, [the attacks will [trigger a
decision]{.mark} by the Iranians [to produce nuclear weapons]{.mark} as
the only way [to ensure]{.mark} their security and their [regime's
survival]{.mark}; Saudi Arabia and perhaps other regional states will
seek to follow suit; and [non-nuclear states]{.mark} worldwide that
[feel threatened]{.mark} by nuclear-armed adversaries will
[pursue]{.mark} their own [nuclear deterrents.]{.mark}]{.underline}

According to some others[, the attacks will block Iran's pathways to
nuclear weapons and convince it to abandon the quest; Middle Eastern
states will have reduced incentives to seek their own capabilities; U.S.
allies will be more confident of Washington's willingness to use force
on their behalf and less inclined to go nuclear themselves; and
countries contemplating a nuclear program will be discouraged by the
risk of becoming the target of preventive military attack.]{.underline}

Of course, much will [depend on the outcome of the Iran nuclear issue.
If Iran abandons its nuclear ambitions convincingly, the global
nonproliferation regime will be reinforced. But [if Iran's]{.mark}
nuclear [program survives]{.mark} the attacks [and]{.mark} Iran
[proceeds to build nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}---or if the
result of the attacks is an uncertain, open-ended cat-and-mouse game,
with Iran's program no longer monitored by the International Atomic
Energy Agency and the United States or Israel ready to use force
whenever it sees evidence of a revitalized nuclear weapons effort---[the
[implications for nonproliferation will be]{.mark} very
[damaging]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Military]{.mark} means alone [cannot **ensure** a positive
outcome]{.mark}. A highly restrictive, rigorously verifiable, and
permanent agreement offers the best hope for an outcome that can reduce
the likelihood of **further nuclear proliferation.**]{.underline}

"The Future of Nuclear Proliferation after the War in Ukraine"
<https://www.ifri.org/en/studies/future-nuclear-proliferation-after-war-ukraine>)
// gmemb

[The current war in [Ukraine]{.mark} may be [the **most blatant
example** of nuclear weapons]{.mark} being used to backstop coercion and
territorial conquest, but it is certainly not without historical
precedent.]{.underline} [[Prior cases]{.mark} where nuclear weapons were
used in a similar fashion sometimes **[stimulated proliferation
pressures]{.mark}** but rarely led to the actual acquisition of nuclear
weapons by new states.]{.underline}

During the Korean War, for instance, the Eisenhower administration
issued nuclear threats to try to compel China and North Korea to agree
to an armistice on American terms. While there is a debate over the
efficacy of these threats,77 and although the US did not start the
Korean War, it is nonetheless a clear example of an attempt to use
nuclear threats to compel concessions. Indeed, [China's decision to
start a nuclear weapons program was driven in large part by the
perception that Washington had used its nuclear arsenal to coerce
Beijing,]{.underline} both in Korea and during the Taiwan Straits
Crises.78 China did go on to acquire nuclear weapons, testing its first
nuclear device in October 1964, but two caveats are in order about the
limited relevance of this case for the contemporary environment. First,
[China's nuclear weapons program was started and completed prior to the
existence of the NPT and a strong nonproliferation regime---a very
different sort of environment from what faces potential proliferators
today.]{.underline} Second, and relatedly, China made these decisions
when the nuclear age was in its infancy, and there was limited
understanding (and evidence) about how nuclear weapons would influence
international politics. China's experience of nuclear coercion at the
hands of the US was, therefore, likely to be more important in shaping
views in the 1950s than Russian actions are today since we have more
than 70 years of nuclear history to draw from. Russia's use of nuclear
weapons for offensive purposes just adds one to several prior instances.

[Subsequent cases where nuclear weapons have been utilized to facilitate
compellent or territorial aims have not led to successful
proliferation.]{.underline} Israel secretly acquired nuclear weapons in
1967 and subsequently conquered the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Golan
Heights, and the Sinai Peninsula in the ArabIsraeli Wars of 1967 and
1973.79 In these conflicts, Israeli officials viewed their nuclear
arsenal as a useful insurance policy that could be used to compel the US
to intervene diplomatically on their behalf, deter their Arab rivals
from pushing their advantage, or preserve Israeli survival in extreme
circumstances.80 Many of Israel's Arab rivals subsequently did pursue
nuclear weapons, at least in part to counter Israel, including Libya,
Iraq, Iran, and Syria. [Despite decades of effort, none of these
countries have acquired nuclear weapons (at least so far), and each has
faced significant sanctions and/or military force as a result of their
nuclear ambitions]{.underline}, reflecting the stronger nonproliferation
regime that exists post-NPT[.]{.underline}81 The Iraq case is
particularly instructive: Saddam Hussein pursued nuclear weapons with
the specific idea that it would neutralize Israeli nuclear threats and
thereby "allow Iraq and its Arab allies to prosecute a prolonged war
that would displace Israel from the territories occupied in 1967."82
Nevertheless, due to sanctions, mismanagement, and military force, Iraq
was forced to abandon its nuclear program after the first Gulf War.83

[Since the 1990s, [Pakistan]{.mark} has consistently [used]{.mark} its
[nuclear arsenal to]{.mark} help [pursue **revisionist aims**]{.mark}
vis-à-vis India, launching the Kargil War in 1999 and [backing
**insurgent** and **terrorist attacks**]{.mark} against India while
threatening the first use of nuclear weapons to deter India from
responding in a significant way.84 Despite this pattern of behavior,
there is no evidence any country began pursuing nuclear weapons based on
lessons learned from Pakistan.]{.underline}

Likewise, while many analysts warn of grave proliferation consequences
from the ongoing Russian war in Ukraine, they often fail to consider
that [Russia has attacked Ukraine before---namely when it took Crimea
and occupied parts of eastern Ukraine in 2014---and this did not have
any discernible proliferation consequences.]{.underline} No new
countries---Ukraine or otherwise---initiated nuclear weapons programs
after 2014, and Iran agreed to roll back its nuclear program just one
year later. While it is true that the nuclear dimension was much less
salient in 2014, Putin admitted in 2015 that he mulled placing Russian
nuclear forces on alert to deter Western intervention, but ultimately,
his aims were achieved without this being necessary.[85 In short,
nuclear powers using their arsenals to support compellence or aggression
is nothing new, and history suggests that it very rarely leads to the
emergence of new nuclear powers---especially in the post-NPT
era.]{.underline}

One important caveat to the preceding discussion is [that different
[lessons might be drawn if Russia use]{.mark}d [nuclear]{.mark}
[weapons]{.mark} in the war, [and]{.mark} this [caused Ukraine to
surrender or the West]{.mark} to [pull **back support**]{.mark} for
Kyiv. This could [cause **serious damage**]{.mark} to the nuclear taboo
[and increase]{.mark} the perceived **[value of nuclear
weapons]{.mark}** in a way **unseen for decades.**]{.underline}

### Prolif High\-\--Trump

#### NEW START expiration and a lack of U.S. assurances will lead to nuclear prolif (also prolif bad)

**Daalder 25** \[Ivo Daalder is a former U.S. ambassador to NATO and CEO
of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, "There is no such thing as
good nuclear proliferation," 01/08/2025,
https://www.politico.eu/article/there-is-no-such-thing-as-good-nuclear-proliferation/\]

[Indeed, back in 2016, then-candidate [Trump argued]{.mark} that [Korea
and Japan]{.mark} might [want to get nuclear]{.mark} [weapons]{.mark} to
deal with North Korea's arsenal. He then [offered]{.mark} them [**little
reassurance** that the U.S. had their backs.]{.mark}]{.underline} And
later, as president, he was more concerned with getting allies to "pay
up" than defending them in the event of an attack.

[Of course, [worries about]{.mark} nuclear [proliferation are **nothing
new**]{.mark}.]{.underline} In 1963, then-U.S. President John F. Kennedy
warned of a "world in which 15 or 20 or 25 nations may have these
weapons." But while Washington did help some allies with their nuclear
programs, its longer-term effort was to stem the desire for acquiring
nuclear weapons through a combination of arms control and alliance
building.

[Together with the Soviet Union, the U.S. negotiated the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT),]{.underline} which committed
nonnuclear states to remain so, and nuclear states to work toward
nuclear disarmament. Washington also bolstered its nuclear commitments
to allies in Europe and Asia, sharing nuclear information and inviting
some allies to participate in nuclear missions.

These efforts have been extraordinarily successful. Since the NPT was
signed in 1968, only five other countries developed nuclear weapons ---
and one of those, South Africa, dismantled its small arsenal in the
1990s. Over the past few decades, arms control agreements--- as well as
stronger alliances --- reduced nuclear inventories by nearly 90 percent.

[But now, this strategy is under **severe stress**. [New START,]{.mark}
the [last remaining U.S.-Russia]{.mark} strategic [arms]{.mark} [control
agreement]{.mark}, will [expire in **little over a
year**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Moscow]{.mark} has already made clear it
**[doesn't seek]{.mark}** another [extension]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
Washington is now concerned that [[Beijing's rapidly expanding]{.mark}
nuclear [arsenal]{.mark} [means]{.mark} future [negotiations]{.mark}
will mean trying to pull off a more **[complicated and
difficult]{.mark}** tripartite agreement.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, [[Russia's]{.mark} military [aggression]{.mark} in Ukraine
and its shadow war against Europe have [created]{.mark} the most
[threatening security environment]{.mark} the continent has seen in
decades, putting alliances under **increasing strain**.]{.underline}
Plus, China's rapid expansion of its armed forces, coupled with its
growing willingness to use military muscle across its borders and in the
waters of the Pacific, now challenge America's longstanding predominance
in the region.

All this, at a time when the U.S. is sowing doubts about its own global
staying power. Lest we forget, during his first term, [[Trump's]{.mark}
"America First [policy]{.mark}" had a tendency to [put allies
last]{.mark} --- [weakening]{.mark} alliances long vital to
[combatting]{.mark} the [desire for proliferation.]{.mark}]{.underline}

But it's not just Trump --- [[America's actions]{.mark} have been
running [counter]{.mark} to Washington's [nonproliferation]{.mark}
[interests]{.mark} for longer than that.]{.underline}

When Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, for example, the U.S., Britain and
France did little to counter the effort, even though all three nuclear
powers, along with Russia, had signed the 1994 Budapest Memorandum. That
agreement was meant to guarantee Ukraine's territorial integrity and
sovereignty in return for its transfer of the nuclear weapons and
missiles deployed on its territory when still part of the Soviet Union.

The same can be said of America's more recent actions in Ukraine and the
Middle East too. When Iran fired hundreds of missiles and drones against
Israel in April and October last year, a beefed-up U.S. military in the
region was critical to Israel's defense. But when Russia shoots hundreds
of missiles and drones against civilian targets in Ukraine almost every
day of the week, all Washington does is promise more air defense
missiles.

The difference is clear: As a nuclear power, Russia deters the U.S. and
its allies from directly defending Ukraine, but as a nonnuclear power,
Iran can do little to prevent the U.S. and its allies from directly
defending Israel. No surprise, then, that the International Atomic
Energy Agency recently announced Tehran had "dramatically" accelerated
its uranium enrichment efforts.

[In a world less constrained by international norms and rules, and
increasingly governed by sheer power, the [strictures that]{.mark} long
[constrained nuclear proliferation are]{.mark} now **in danger** of
[loosening]{.mark} --- if not **[untangling altogether]{.mark}**. And in
such a world, [even "good" proliferation]{.mark} can soon [lead to
**very bad** results.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Trump isolationism gives allies incentive to proliferate 

**Panda 25** \[Ankit Panda is a Stanton Senior Fellow, Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace, "Why America may be triggering a new
era of nuclear proliferation," 06/09/2025,
https://www.chathamhouse.org/publications/the-world-today/2025-06/why-america-may-be-triggering-new-era-nuclear-proliferation\]

In this third nuclear age, new and complex dynamics are emerging. [North
Korea is no longer a nonproliferation challenge, but a **nuclear
deterrence** problem for the US]{.underline}. In April and May, India
and Pakistan engaged in the most serious military exchange since their
arrival as nuclear powers in 1998. [Moreover, [novel
technologies]{.mark}, from **[cyber-weapons]{.mark}** to
**[a]{.mark}rtificial [i]{.mark}ntelligence**, have [increased
anxieties]{.mark} [about]{.mark} new [pathways to nuclear
war]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[For American allies in Europe and East Asia, these
[developments]{.mark} are lead[ing to greater insecurity and
anxiety]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The world is more dangerous and,
with it, the threat of conventional war between states and an ensuing
nuclear conflict is higher than it has been in decades. An America that
was faithful to the essential insight of the Gilpatric committee would
respond to this with reassurance. Instead, at the Munich Security
Conference in February, US Vice President JD Vance excoriated European
values, suggesting a US administration that is uninterested in Europe's
sovereignty -- perhaps even its survival. His speech echoed what Trump
has long stated: that America's allies have been taking Washington for a
ride for decades, were undeserving of its protection and must 'pay their
fair share'.

[At question now is America's commitment to NATO and the Article 5
collective defence clause,]{.underline} including its willingness to
maintain the US nuclear umbrella under which member states have
sheltered. [The ambivalence is underscored by Trump's inconsistent
pronouncements]{.underline}. Campaigning in the run-up to his first
presidency, [[Trump suggested **South**]{.mark} **[Korea and
Japan]{.mark}** might need to [acquire nuclear weapons]{.mark}, for
instance]{.underline}. At other times he has termed the spread of
nuclear weapons the 'single biggest threat' to the world.

Like his predecessors, Trump appears to believe that American
adversaries such as Iran should remain non-nuclear. Yet in 2018 during
his first presidential term, [[Trump]{.mark} chose to [withdraw]{.mark}
the US [from]{.mark} the 2015 [J]{.mark}oint [C]{.mark}omprehensive
[P]{.mark}lan of [A]{.mark}ction [which limited Iran's nuclear]{.mark}
weapons [programme]{.mark} in exchange for sanctions
relief]{.underline}. Iran is now believed to be closer than ever to
developing its first nuclear weapon.

Trump contradictions

At the same time, Trump has shown an interest in deep arms reductions
with Russia and China, an objective that would become far more difficult
should American ambivalence towards its allies push them to acquire
nuclear weapons. The prospect of a nuclear-armed Germany, Poland, South
Korea and Japan may be unlikely -- but should it take shape and impinge
upon the security interests of Moscow and Beijing, arms control and
reduction among the major powers would be nigh-on impossible.

For America's allies, these contradictions may be beside the point.
America can no longer be treated as the cornerstone of their national
defence, and relying on Washington for deterrence may be more of a
liability than an asset. Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden, failed to
persuade allies that their experience in Trump's first term was an
aberration and that the US was fundamentally ready to 'repair our
alliances and engage with the world once again'.

[With Trump's re-election, [allies]{.mark} are starting to **[take
matters into their own hands]{.mark}**. [European]{.mark} spending on
national [defence has spiked]{.mark} in the first months of
2025]{.underline} and the continent's two nuclear powers, Britain and
France, are exploring ways to reassure European allies in order to
prevent uncontrolled proliferation.

[It is clear that the world can no longer take for granted longstanding
principles of US grand strategy when it comes to nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. The load-bearing pillar of American leadership in
the global nuclear order is crumbling. But there are still options to
avert the worst outcomes. First, Paris and London should, as a matter of
urgency, seek to study the feasibility of erecting a new security
architecture for Europe, built on the establishment of a new extended
deterrence that incorporates their own nuclear capabilities. This is
easier said than done. [Neither has seriously contemplated operating in
a world **without US support**.]{.underline} Also, France's deterrent is
more independent than Britain's which relies on cooperation with the US.

Since Russia's last race to take over Eastern Europe, when World War II
bullets and Soviet tanks were still whizzing across the region, the
United States has extended its nuclear umbrella to cover most of the

These "Free World" powers cofounded the NATO military alliance
specifically to protect each other against Russian expansionism.

[[Russia's]{.mark} renewed [marches]{.mark} [beyond its borders]{.mark},

Alexander Bollfrass, a globally acclaimed scholar on nuclear weaponry at
the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies.

The rising dangers posed by Russia's military build-up and
empire-building incursions were recently highlighted by NATO Secretary
General Mark Rutte, who said during the group's June summit that he is
pushing every ally to invest five percent of GNP in defense in part to
prepare for a Kremlin attack on a NATO nation.

that between 3, 5, 7 years from now, [Russia will be able to]{.mark}
successfully [attack us, if we do not start investing]{.mark} more
**today**]{.underline}," Rutte told reporters gathered at The Hague.

[To prevent that attack, could a [new coalition]{.mark} of European
confederates actually [produce a **nuclear stockpile**]{.mark} capable
of containing Russia, which holds the planet's most colossal atomic
armory]{.underline}?

Could they race to perfect the warheads, jet fighters and long-range
missiles essential to creating a credible defense to President Vladimir
Putin's ambitions to reconstruct the Soviet Union?

Dr. Bollfrass, head of strategy, technology and arms control at IISS,
tells me in an interview that he war-gamed the potential to create a
"Eurodeterrent" while drawing on EU states' real-life access to
uranium-235, and their combined expertise in missile technology, and in
designing defense aircraft that could be adapted to carry nuclear
payloads.

[A new European [defense confederation]{.mark} that [stretches from
**Scandinavia** to the **Mediterranean**]{.mark}, he predicts, might
[produce]{.mark} a stockpile of nuclear [warheads within **three
years**]{.mark}]{.underline}---rivaling the speed of the U.S. Manhattan
Project---and assemble an atomic cache perhaps one-tenth the size of the
current American arsenal.

[[Scattered **across Europe**]{.mark}, Bollfrass says, [are]{.mark}
nearly [all the advanced-tech components]{.mark} and know-how, the
scientists and weapons designers]{.underline}, that could collectively
give rise to a rising world nuclear power.

[[**Germany** and the **Netherlands**]{.mark} both [conduct uranium
enrichment]{.mark} operations, and could in theory refine weapons-grade
fissile material for future devices]{.underline}.

[**[Sweden]{.mark}** might [revive]{.mark} its [plutonium
extraction]{.mark} program]{.underline}, Bollfrass adds, and turns out
leading-edge Gripen combat jets that could join up with Eurofighter
aircraft co-developed by Germany in an expanding nuclear delivery
system.

Creator of the first ballistic missile---the V-2
rocket---[[Germany]{.mark} might also [collaborate with]{.mark} missile
[designers in Sweden or **Italy**]{.mark} to perfect another weapons
platform.]{.underline}

And with Italy's crafting a series of Vega rockets, Bollfrass says, "the
expertise from developing it would be rather valuable in developing an
ICBM," or a nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile that
could target Moscow from any part of Europe.

Yet which partner in this new nuclear confederation could design the
sophisticated warheads to arm the jet-bombers and missiles aimed at
defending against the Kremlin's escalating aggression?

The United Kingdom and France have already developed nuclear warheads,
yet neither is likely to lead the project to build a Eurodeterrent, Dr.
Bollfrass says.

Both London and Paris "remain signatories to the NPT \[the nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty\], whose first article says: 'Each
nuclear-weapon State Party to the Treaty undertakes not to transfer to
any recipient whatsoever nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive
devices.'"

Parties to the treaty likewise pledge, he adds, "not in any way to
assist, encourage, or induce any non-nuclear-weapon State to manufacture
or otherwise acquire nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive
devices."

"[This limits how much [the British and French]{.mark} would be able to
share]{.underline}," he points out.

"[Of course, they [can assign **broader deterrence missions**]{.mark}
for their own arsenals that would cover the territory of their
allies]{.underline}," Bollfrass says.

Yet despite requests from the leaders of Germany and of Poland to be
granted shelter under the French and British shields, neither nuclear
power has so far formally approved extending its atomic dome.

[[Physicists]{.mark} outside of Britain and France [are **likely to
head** any]{.mark} Euro-[project]{.mark} to build a bomb]{.underline},
and would likely rely on sophisticated next-generation simulation
software---run on supercomputers---to test each advance made in this
quest.

Any nation joining this campaign that is also a signatory to the NPT
would have to withdraw from that treaty, Bollfrass says.

[As a series of European nations begins quitting the NPT, he adds,
[Europe]{.mark} as a whole [would be]{.mark} **[rapidly
transformed]{.mark}** from one of the world's strongest proponents of
nuclear disarmament into a new symbol of hard nuclear
power]{.underline}.

As they progress in the building of an atomic stockpile, allies in this
nuclear confederation would also have to agree on a collective nuclear
doctrine spelling out the essential preconditions for the use of these
weapons, and form a command-and-control center that could issue
lightning-speed decisions on launching a retaliatory strike on a
first-use attacker.

The emergence of an ascendant atomic power, and the mass abandonment of
the Non-Proliferation Treaty, he predicts, might spark a new nuclear ams
race that ricochets around the world.

Yet how likely is it that Bollfrass's war game---on creating a
Euro-bomb---could actually be played out in today's Europe?

Would the ultimate decision depend in part on any American moves to pull
back from NATO, and from extending its nuclear defenses to cover its
allies across Europe?

Bollfrass, who as a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard University designed
war games involving Russia, predicts:"The possibility of a new nuclear
arsenal in Europe is remote at the moment."

"For all of its criticism of Europe," he adds, so far "the Trump
administration has not called its nuclear guarantee to its allies into
question."

[Yet [the spark for]{.mark} galvanizing [a nuclear Eurodeterrent]{.mark}
project could [appear in a **fleeting
moment**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

"If Europe found itself without that \[American nuclear\] protection in
the future, a new independent arsenal might become an option."

And if the founders of a European atomic alliance did amass a weapons
stockpile aimed at containing Russia inside its own borders, Bollfrass
muses, they might one day extend this nuclear dome to cover Ukraine---in
an against-all-odds attempt to swiftly halt Moscow's invasion.

### Prolif High\-\--Sanctions

The US does not just use civilian nuclear assistance as nonproliferation
leverage. [Increasingly since the 1970s, [the US has used]{.mark} its
broader **[economic]{.mark} and financial [power]{.mark}** [to further
nonproliferation aims]{.mark}, threatening and imposing economic
sanctions in an effort to coerce states into remaining
non-nuclear.]{.underline} Evidence suggests [that the threat of
sanctions has deterred countries dependent on the US from seeking
nuclear weapons since the late 1970s,]{.underline} while [multilateral
sanctions coalitions have helped convince South Africa, Libya, Iraq, and
Iran to roll back or otherwise restrain their nuclear
programs.]{.underline}34 In recent years, the US has increasingly
utilized secondary sanctions---imposing costs not just on the primary
target but on countries that do business with them---to notable effect.

35 However, [the success of [US sanctions]{.mark} has the potential to

increasingly learn how to **[circumvent]{.mark}** them [and **reduce

[reduce]{.mark} one of [the]{.mark} main [disincentives]{.mark} [to
seek]{.mark}ing [nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline},37 [possibly

// gmemb

[[Concerns about US reliability]{.mark} as an ally [go back to
the]{.mark} beginning of the **[Cold War]{.mark}**.]{.underline} They
were particularly acute in the late 1950s and early 1960s---when the US
homeland became increasingly vulnerable to Soviet nuclear attack---and
the late 1960s through early 1970s, when US efforts at détente and
retrenchment called its reliability into question, particularly in
Asia.60 In both cases, [some US [allies]{.mark} **did
[consider]{.mark}** [acquiring]{.mark} their own [nuclear
weapons]{.mark} in response. However, the US effectively managed these
concerns and prevented proliferation, with the partial exception of
France]{.underline} (as discussed below).

The Soviet launch of the Sputnik satellite in October 1957 and
subsequent Soviet development of an ICBM capability roused significant
concerns among NATO allies, who wondered whether Washington would be
willing to fight a war to protect them if it exposed the US homeland to
Soviet nuclear attack. Shortly after the launch, for instance, France,
West Germany, and Italy began discussing the joint production of nuclear
weapons, which would give Europe an independent deterrent outside US
control.61 While this arrangement broke down under De Gaulle, West
Germany and France maintained nuclear ambitions, with Paris racing
forward on an independent nuclear weapons program and Bonn keeping its
nuclear options open.62 Ultimately, [the US succeeded at convincing West
Germany to renounce nuclear weapons through a combination of
coercion---making clear an alliance with the US was incompatible with an
independent German nuclear arsenal---and reassurance, including the
creation of the Nuclear Planning Group]{.underline}, which involved West
Germany in NATO nuclear strategy discussions.63 [Italy likewise accepted
the forward deployment of US nuclear weapons, which would be launched
under a dual-key arrangement, as an alternative to an independent or
joint European deterrent.64]{.underline}

[France, of course, ultimately did acquire its own nuclear weapons,
rejecting the Eisenhower administration's offer of forward-deployed US
nuclear weapons as an alternative]{.underline}.65 While this is often
attributed to the sort of alliance concerns described above, with French
leaders not willing to trust the US to protect them, France's nuclear
weapons program pre-dated Sputnik (and the prior Suez Crisis) by several
years. Further, there is significant evidence suggesting French
decision-makers were largely driven by status concerns---in particular,
cementing France's position as a great power---in seeking their own
nuclear arsenal.

66 A second round of concerns about US reliability emerged a decade
later. In the context of pressures for retrenchment due to the Vietnam
War[, the Nixon administration pushed its Asian allies to do more to
provide for their own defense---the so-called "Nixon doctrine"---and
sought improved relations with Communist China.]{.underline}67 These
policy changes led South Korea to initiate a secret nuclear weapons
program, led Taiwan to accelerate a nascent program, and caused Japan to
revive consideration of an independent nuclear arsenal.68 Through a mix
of carrots and sticks, [the US succeeded in convincing South Korea and
Taiwan to end their nuclear weapons programs,69 while reassurance was
utilized to help reinforce Japan's decision to keep its nuclear
capabilities latent.]{.underline}70

[The US track record of preventing allied proliferation despite alliance
credibility concerns is thus quite strong, even in periods where the US
was perceived to be in relative decline, as it was in the early 1960s
and early 1970s.]{.underline} While France's acquisition of nuclear
weapons is an important counterexample, as noted above, concerns about
US reliability were probably not the decisive factor in leading it to
acquire nuclear weapons. The type of status concerns that motivated
French leaders are unlikely to lead to proliferation amongst US allies
today; while nuclear weapons were markers of prestige in the 1950s and
early 1960s, [the emergence of the NPT has, for the most part, flipped
the script, meaning new proliferators can expect to lose status and be
branded as "rogue" states for seeking nuclear weapons.]{.underline}71
Nevertheless, for certain types of leaders, for example, highly
nationalist ones like Turkey's Erdogan, nuclear weapons may retain
appeal.

72 While the historical record is a cause for guarded optimism in terms
of America's ability to do the same in the coming years, [the
**[crucial]{.mark} [caveat]{.mark}** is that [it depends on]{.mark} an
[American willingness to provide]{.mark} meaningful [reassurance]{.mark}
to its allies [and to prioritize nonproliferation]{.mark}. This is an
[objective]{.mark} that [has]{.mark} often [been **taken for
granted**]{.mark} in the past but [may **not apply** in]{.mark} a
prospective [second Trump term]{.mark}, given his stated views on
alliances and proliferation.73]{.underline}

### Prolif Low\-\--NATO

#### NATO prevents European proliferation

**NATO 25** \[The North Atlantic Treaty Organization's purpose is to
guarantee the freedom and security of its members through political and
military mean, "NATO's nuclear deterrence policy and forces,"
06/24/2025, https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_50068.htm\]

The fundamental purpose of NATO's nuclear capability is to preserve
peace, prevent coercion and deter aggression. [As long as nuclear
weapons exist, [NATO]{.mark} will [remain a **nuclear
alliance**]{.mark}. NATO's goal is a safer world for all; the Alliance
seeks [to create]{.mark} the security environment for [a world **without
nuclear weapons.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

NATO's current nuclear policy is based on two public documents agreed by
all Allies:

The 2022 Strategic Concept

The 2012 Deterrence and Defence Posture Review

NATO continues to affirm the importance of nuclear deterrence in light
of evolving challenges. Allies have reiterated this principle at
successive summit meetings since 2014, including the 2022 Madrid Summit,
where Heads of State and Government agreed the 2022 Strategic Concept --
the Alliance's guiding document and blueprint for adaptation. [The 2022
[Strategic Concept sets]{.mark} out **[deterrence]{.mark}** and
**defence** [as]{.mark} one of [the]{.mark} Alliance's **[core
tasks]{.mark}**. It states that NATO's deterrence and [defence posture
is]{.mark} [based on]{.mark} an appropriate mix of [nuclear]{.mark},
conventional and missile defence capabilities, complemented by space and
cyber [capabilities]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Furthermore, the Strategic Concept states that: "NATO will take all
necessary steps to ensure the credibility, effectiveness, safety and
security of the nuclear deterrent mission. The Alliance is committed to
ensuring greater integration and coherence of capabilities and
activities across all domains and the spectrum of conflict, while
reaffirming the unique and distinct role of nuclear deterrence. NATO
will continue to maintain credible deterrence, strengthen its strategic
communications, enhance the effectiveness of its exercises and reduce
strategic risks."

[The [Alliance reaffirms]{.mark} the **[imperative to ensure]{.mark}**
the broadest possible [participation]{.mark} by Allies concerned in the
[agreed **nuclear burden-sharing**]{.mark} arrangements to demonstrate
Alliance unity and resolve.]{.underline}

The Deterrence and Defence Posture Review (DDPR) was endorsed by Allied
Heads of State and Government at the 2012 Chicago Summit. [The DDPR
stressed that [the **fundamental purpose** of Alliance nuclear forces is
deterrence]{.mark}, which is essentially a political function. While the
Alliance [focuses on]{.mark} the [maintenance of effective
deterrence,]{.mark} political control of nuclear weapons will be kept
under all circumstances and [nuclear planning and consultation]{.mark}
within the Alliance [will be in accordance with **political
guidance.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

## Prolif Good

### Prolif Good\-\--IR

#### Prominent theories of IR and deterrence support prolif

**Hossain 17** \[Md. Aslam Hossain is a senior editor of The
Geopolitics, "Is Nuclear Proliferation Good for the World?," 11/09/2017,
https://thegeopolitics.com/is-nuclear-proliferation-good-for-the-world/\]

There are two opposing theories regarding the question of proliferation
and non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. After the advent of the
nuclear age, nuclear weapons have been a central topic for debate within
academia, foreign-policy communities and think tanks. Kenneth Waltz and
Scott Sagan, two prominent scholars of International Relations have
proposed two different theories to address the problem.

Kenneth Waltz was an advocate of nuclear proliferation. He was a strong
supporter of "Rational Deterrence Theory". [He believed [the world would
be **safer** if more countries had nuclear weapons]{.mark}. According to
Waltz, [proliferation]{.mark} would [bring more peace]{.mark} for the
following reasons:]{.underline}

[[Nuclear weapons make war less likely]{.mark} because nuclear weapons
[encourage]{.mark} both [defense and deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[The possibility of total annihilation in a nuclear war [makes]{.mark}
states more careful and [miscalculation **more
difficult**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nuclear weapons dissuade attack both
on home territory and on vital strategic interests.

[[Weak]{.mark} and small [countries]{.mark} [will not use]{.mark}
nuclear weapons [irresponsibly]{.mark}]{.underline}. There is a good
chance that they will be defeated in a conventional war. [[Nukes
are]{.mark} their [last resort]{.mark}, so they will save their nukes
for final battles. They will only use those nukes if survival is at
stake, [**certainly not** for reckless invasion.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[It is **not possible** to **completely stop**]{.mark} the
[proliferation of nuclear weapons]{.mark} because [states will]{.mark}
continuously [attempt to improve their security
environment]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In a nuclear war both parties will be destroyed, so no one will be
tempted to use nuclear weapons in a war.

[[Nuclear weapons act as a deterrent force]{.underline}]{.mark};
meaning, if you have nuclear bombs [other countries will be discouraged
to initiate a war in the first place for the fear of nuclear
annihilation]{.underline}.

A state calculates the costs and benefits before going to war. [If costs
outweigh benefit then there will be no incentives to start a war. In a
nuclear war, there are no benefits; it will only increase your costs, so
[nuclear weapons can **prevent wars.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

The acquisition of nuclear weapons makes states "exceedingly cautious"
and they will not fight if they can't win much and stand to lose
everything. [Prominent realist thinker [**John Mearsheimer**
supports]{.mark} Kenneth Waltz by stating [that "nuclear weapons are a
**superb deterrent**]{.mark}]{.underline}" (New York Times 1998).

### Prolif Good\-\--Necessity 

#### Countries will only proliferate out of necessity \-\-- Checks against irrational use

**Freedman et Al 19** \[Steven E. Miller is Director of the
International Security Program at the Belfer Center for Science and
International Affairs at the Harvard Kennedy School, Robert Legvold is
Marshall D. Shulman Professor Emeritus in the Department of Political
Science at Columbia University, and Lawrence D. Freedman is an

London, "Meeting the Challenges of the New Nuclear Age: Nuclear Weapons
in a Changing Global Order," 01/2019,
https://www.amacad.org/publication/nuclear-weapons-changing-global-order/section/4\]

[Because of the [costs and risks of proliferation]{.mark} the [benefits
need to be **serious**]{.mark}.]{.underline} There were always three
sorts of benefits. The first was to break open the international
hierarchy. [One objection to the NPT was that it confirmed a hierarchy
in which the five designated nuclear powers were also the permanent
members of the UN Security Council]{.underline}. Many would argue that
there is a case for reform of the Security Council to include the major
nonnuclear powers in order to break that link. But since reform has
proven to be so elusive, the permanent membership has stayed the same.
[In practice, however, [**economic strength** is]{.mark} usually far
more [relevant]{.mark} to most international groups.]{.underline}

A second benefit was prestige. To be able to master the technology
demonstrated that a country was on the first rank in its science and
advanced industrial capabilities. This argument is still current. It
appears to have been important in the Iran case and was part of the
rationale for countries such as Brazil, which put considerable effort
into their nuclear programs. But nuclear energy is no longer seen to be
vital to wider industrial success.

[Whatever the prestige or civil energy arguments for developing an
advanced capability short of an actual weapon, the [strategic value lies
in hedging]{.mark} since the breakout time is reduced if a weapon is
desired]{.underline}. This was a major issue in discussions of the
quality of the Iran deal.

[[Enhancing security]{.mark} must be [the main potential benefit]{.mark}
of a nuclear capability. [Because of the costs]{.mark} and risks of a
nuclear program, [the **security gain** must be]{.mark}
high.]{.underline} It is evident that with many security challenges,
especially if they involve terrorism or insurgencies, nuclear weapons
are irrelevant, and even with interstate warfare they are very much in
the last resort category. [Those [countries that]{.mark} have [opted for
their own]{.mark} nuclear [capability]{.mark} do [have **serious
strategic rationales**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even then they still seek
to soften their dependence on nuclear deterrence by building up their
conventional capabilities, or looking for ways to ease tensions with
their neighbors, or strengthening their ties with friendly great powers.
One reason Israel refuses to brag about its nuclear options is that it
does not want to jeopardize the far more important alliance with the
United States, and its nuclear capability is less relevant to most of
the security challenges Israel currently faces.

Despite the logic that might warn against relying on the United States
to provide deterrence, given the risks to which that would expose the
United States, alliance continues to trump proliferation. France has
come back into the NATO fold. In the 1974 Ottawa Declaration, it allowed
the force de frappe to be presented, along with the UK's Polaris fleet,
as contributions to NATO's deterrent. No other U.S. ally has built a
nuclear weapon. [There have been regular reports that America's Asian
allies, and in particular Japan and South Korea, have kept the matter
under review, but as long as the United States appears ready to honor
its obligations in the face of Chinese and North Korean threats, the
Asian allies choose to stay with the status quo. [The **uncertainties**
resulting from]{.mark} the [policies of President Trump,]{.mark}
including on notionally unrelated areas such as trade, [have led]{.mark}
America's [allies to wonder about the **solidity of alliance
ties**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Allies are clinging to the fact
that they are supported by official policies even though this is rarely
reflected in the President's statements. [If he wins a second term, it
is **[hard to see]{.mark}** [how]{.mark} the current [alliances can
**survive**]{.mark} in their current form,]{.underline} although Trump
is not wholly consistent and future crises may change the context.

### Prolif Good\-\--Cooperation

#### Nuclear weapons deter conflict and incentivizes international cooperation

**Striker 21** \[Editor the Tufts Daily with a BA in International
Relations and Master\'s in Spatial Planning, "The Strike Zone: Why
nuclear weapons are good for peace," 02/24/2021,
https://www.tuftsdaily.com/article/2021/02/the-strike-zone-why-nuclear-weapons-are-good-for-peace\]

Since the election of President Biden, U.S.-Russia relations have
quickly worsened; the U.S. government fell victim to a cyber hack by
Russian hackers in December and Western-backed politician Alexei Navalny
has inspired pro-democracy protests across Russia in recent
weeks.However, in a rare display of Russian-American cooperation, the
United States and Russia recently agreed to extend the New START
treaty,an agreement that limits both nations' nuclear stockpiles.
Despite extreme tension, the United States and Russia have historically
found common ground on the issue of nuclear weaponry. Since the
implementation of nuclear technology, nuclear limitation treaties have
served as the backbone of cooperation between the two nations. For
example, after the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis --- the closest any two
nuclear nations have ever come to war --- Soviet-American relations were
restored through the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks of the late 1960s
and 70s, in which both countries agreed to reduce their production of
nuclear weapons. It may sound counterintuitive, but nuclear weaponry has
been crucial in preventing major warfare since World War II. [The
[threat of m]{.mark}utually [a]{.mark}ssured nuclear
[d]{.mark}estruction [**deters** countries from engaging]{.mark} in
total [interstate wars and gives]{.mark} countries [incentive to
**strengthen international institutions**]{.mark} through arms control
treaties and collective security measures.]{.underline}

[Since the end of World War II, **zero interstate wars** have been
fought between democratic countries, an unprecedented phenomenon in
recent history]{.underline} that has been debated by scholars for
decades. Cynical "realist" scholars, who believe that humans are
inherently selfish, argue peace exists because the strategic and
economic benefits of winning a war are now outweighed by the casualties
of modern war. In contrast, "liberal" scholars believe that democratic
values and political-economic interdependence between countries provide
the modern world with stability and order. [**[Nuclear peace
theory]{.mark}** combines thinking from both schools of thought, meshing
the realist fear of mutually assured destruction with liberal support
for international cooperation]{.underline}. Critics of nuclear peace
believe that it is fragile, as one irresponsible action by a rogue
leader could set off a chain of events that lead to nuclear Armageddon.
However, [we have [seen the effects of nuclear weaponry in the wrong
hands]{.mark}; [Kim Jong Un,]{.mark} arguably the most erratic,
autocratic leader in the world today]{.underline}, has access to
intercontinental ballistic nuclear missiles, [but even he [has **never
come close** to deploying them]{.mark}. Instead, rogue leaders tend to
use nuclear weapons as a bargaining chip, as credible possession of a
nuclear bomb represents a powerful trump card for
negotiations.]{.underline}

The arguments against nuclear proliferation are valid and logical;
nuclear weapons are more destructive than anything humans have ever
created and have become exponentially more powerful since World War II.
[However, the [invention of nuclear weaponry brought forth]{.mark} a
[period of **unprecedented peace**]{.mark} in modern history, so it is
safe to say that [nuclear weapons]{.mark} --- despite being horrific
weapons of mass destruction --- [have **prevented** millions of more
deaths than they have caused.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Prolif Good\-\--Europe

#### European proliferation is necessary to deter Russia 

**Meier 25** \[Anton Meier is a writer and editor for the Geopolitical
Monitor, "'Paris for Berlin' Is Better: A Case for Strengthening
Europe's Nuclear Deterrence," 07/03/2025,
https://www.geopoliticalmonitor.com/paris-for-berlin-is-better-a-case-for-strengthening-europes-nuclear-deterrence/\]

Nuclear weapons in Europe are, and will remain, the sovereign
responsibility of two individual states, France and the United Kingdom.
It is common knowledge that the United Kingdom contributes to NATO's
deterrence and defence as a member of the Nuclear Planning Group, while
France does not. Nevertheless, various European nuclear projects have
been proposed by France since the 1950s. The most prominent example is
President Macron's speech in January 2024 at the Swedish Defence
University, where he stated that "French vital interests have a European
dimension." However, as early as 1995, President Chirac put forward the
concept of "concerted deterrence." Similar to Macron, Chirac invited
European allies to cooperate on European deterrence.

It is true that France's absence from NATO's Nuclear Planning Group is
an institutional limitation, but it is hardly insurmountable.
[[France]{.mark} has already [demonstrated a willingness to adapt its
NATO]{.mark} [engagement]{.mark} in the past by [rejoining]{.mark}
NATO's [integrated military command structure]{.mark} in 2009. If the
need arises, it is a credible possibility that they will join the NPG,
especially if it is no longer under US leadership]{.underline}.
Furthermore, [the structure of a European deterrent does not need to be
identical to NATO's existing model or even within a NATO framework. It
is imaginable that [European allies develop a novel consultation
mechanism]{.mark} similar to NATO's Nuclear Planning Group either as its
own format or [under]{.mark} [the European Union's
umbrella]{.mark}.]{.underline} Nevertheless, NATO expertise, procedures,
and infrastructure would be invaluable for any future arrangement and
offer credibility based on path dependency.

It is often argued that American commitment is misjudged and that, in
reality, the bipartisan support for NATO and extended nuclear deterrence
is steadfast. This might be the case, or it might not. [But [certainty
is]{.mark} equally [**essential** for nuclear deterrence]{.mark} as
credibility and capabilities are. [Due to]{.mark} the [unpredictability
of the]{.mark} current [US]{.mark} administration, the resolve of the
United States is as ambiguous as French doctrine. Domestic [political
instability is a valid concern for extended deterrence]{.mark}, be it by
France or the United States. [Political will is **never
guaranteed**]{.mark}]{.underline}. But doctrines can evolve as well. The
point is not to build a flawless system, but a credible and adaptive
one.

[While there is no unified European nuclear arsenal, this **does not
preclude** the development of a more formalised collective nuclear
deterrence posture.]{.underline} Currently, France and the United
Kingdom do not offer extended deterrence like the United States does.
But this can change. [A framework in which [France and the UK]{.mark}
explicitly [extend their nuclear umbrellas to European allies]{.mark},
through doctrine, joint exercises, and nuclear sharing arrangements,
[would]{.mark} not only [strengthen deterrence]{.mark} itself but also
[provide an **urgently needed** political signal of European
resolve]{.mark}]{.underline}. Of course, the fundamental commitment
issue of extended deterrence remains: would a state really sacrifice one
of its own cities for the sake of an ally? The answer becomes less
abstract when the trade-off is "Paris-for-Berlin" or
"London-for-Warsaw," rather than "New York-for-Paris." The psychological
and political calculus shifts dramatically when nuclear escalation
unfolds on one's own continent. The proximity of European capitals
geographically, but also politically and socially, means that any
nuclear aggression would inevitably affect all of Europe, regardless of
initial targets. [Therefore, [extended deterrence]{.mark} offered by a
European state [will inherently be **more credible** than anything the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [can offer]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

The Curse of Geography

As President Macron rightly noted, it is unimaginable that a threat to
one European ally would not also be a threat to France, or the United
Kingdom. This is not a rhetorical figure but a geographic reality.
Unlike the United States, Europe is compact and densely interconnected.
A nuclear strike anywhere in Europe would have political, environmental,
and humanitarian consequences across borders. In this context, European
extended deterrence should be considered significantly more credible
than what the United States offers.

[Additionally, the [close proximity make]{.mark}s lower-yield or
"tactical" [nuclear war]{.mark} not merely undesirable, but
**[strategically suicidal]{.mark}**. Europe cannot afford to fight a
nuclear war on its own soil. [This makes]{.mark} the
[development]{.mark} of a distinctly European nuclear doctrine
[essential]{.mark}]{.underline}. While such a doctrine does not yet
exist, the debate must begin. It should be shaped by a clear rejection
of nuclear warfighting and guided by the need for credible deterrence
through the threat of unacceptable retaliation. The shared geography,
history, and increasing sense of political identity among Europeans,
despite all internal disagreements, provide a basis for this doctrine
that is stronger than outside observers often assume.

Capabilities and Credibility

The often-invoked distinction between tactical and strategic weapons
also obscures more than it reveals. A weapon's impact depends on its use
and context, not just its range or yield. It is questionable whether
Russia is likely to escalate less merely because a lower-yield device is
used to target a strategic vulnerability. Once a nuclear threshold is
crossed, the dynamics of escalation become dangerously unpredictable. In
such a scenario, a French "warning shot" could in fact be a more
credible tool for signalling resolve and managing escalation than the
existing US lower-yield nuclear weapons forward deployed in Europe.
Furthermore, even after the recent completion of their Life Extension
Program, systems such as the outdated B-61s have little to no real
utility today, especially in warfighting. As General Cartwright already
noted in 2012: "\[the B61 nuclear bombs\] military utility is
practically nil. They do not have assigned missions as part of any war
plan and remain deployed today only for political reasons within the
NATO alliance." For this reason, and the previously established argument
that Europe should have no interest in nuclear warfighting, the argument
that only the United States' lower-yield nuclear weapons can guarantee a
proportionate response should be rejected.

Sceptics rightly point to the UK's technical dependence on the United
States and the absence of a full nuclear triad in either British or
French forces. These are undoubtedly important limitations[. But nuclear
deterrence is not a numbers game. No one questions North Korea's resolve
because of its smaller arsenal.]{.underline} And China, despite
possessing far fewer warheads, raises serious strategic concerns in
Washington. [Credibility is not about symmetry; it is about the assured
ability and political will to impose unacceptable costs]{.underline}.
Whether hundreds or thousands of nuclear weapons are necessary to
achieve more ​​deterrent value is not really the central question. Russia
has relatively few population and military centres of strategic value,
and the combined existing European arsenals have more than sufficient
capabilities to ​​threaten them numerically. That said, modernisation and
expansion, particularly in the form of mobile land-based missiles and
nuclear submarines, would significantly bolster deterrence. In the face
of the limited number of European nuclear weapons, an assured
second-strike capability is crucial. Investments in survivability are
imperative. The United Kingdom's decision to procure F-35As capable of
carrying nuclear weapons is a step in the right direction. It improves
capabilities and shows resolve. [Most importantly, [it reflects]{.mark}
the [acknowledgement of a new threat]{.mark} environment [and
highlights]{.mark} that [European states are **willing to
adapt**]{.mark} their capabilities, policies, and
doctrines.]{.underline}

Conventional Deterrence Still Comes First

To be clear, nuclear deterrence is only part of the equation. Europe's
first and most immediate defence priority must be a stronger
conventional posture, particularly deep strike capabilities which can
have strategic effects comparable to nuclear weapons in degrading
adversary capabilities and deterrence. Conventional deterrence and
defence capability are crucial for preventing conflict reaching the
nuclear threshold. Furthermore, strong conventional deep strike
capabilities could be used for flexible and tailored response options as
an alternative to lower-yield nuclear weapons. The most likely Russian
strategy in a confrontation will be to achieve a fait accompli in the
Baltic, followed by nuclear blackmail to break NATO allies' resolve and
disunite the alliance, possibly accompanied by conventional long-range
strikes. In this scenario, the use of lower-yield nuclear weapons by a
NATO ally is highly unlikely.

Concluding Thoughts

The paradox of nuclear deterrence is that it aims to prevent the very
war it prepares for. [In Europe's case, the path to [preventing nuclear
war may lie in taking greater responsibility]{.mark} for its own nuclear
deterrence.]{.underline} This does not mean duplicating the United
States arsenal or decoupling from NATO. Every effort should be
undertaken to prevent nuclear war, and all Europeans should hope that
the United States remains a close partner. [Nevertheless, to take on
[greater responsibility means]{.mark} building [a]{.mark} more European
[framework that is **credible**, **connected**, and
**resilient**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The "New York-for-Paris Dilemma"
remains, but can be mitigated by a "Paris-for-Berlin" approach, which is
more credible due to geographic proximity and a shared European
identity. Deterrence, after all, is socially constructed both in the
mind of the deterring and the deterred. Its success depends as much on
political will and strategic signalling as on technical capabilities.
Europe must not talk itself out of deterring. [With the right vision and
cooperation, [a stronger European deterrent posture is **not only
necessary but also feasible.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

// gmemb

There is a longstanding debate in the academic literature over whether
nuclear weapons can serve offensive (or "compellent") purposes or
whether they are merely useful to preserve the status quo as
deterrents.52 Those who suggest they have more offensive potential often
argue they can be useful as a shield behind which nuclear power can
engage in conventional aggression. In particular, a nuclear power might
conventionally attack an adversary and then threaten nuclear retaliation
to deter or limit a forceful response. Pakistan is often pointed to as a
country that has used nuclear weapons in this fashion, for example,
during the 1999 Kargil War.53

[Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 is perhaps the most clear-cut case
of nuclear weapons being used in this offensive manner.]{.underline} As
a result, [many have suggested it could send a strong message to the
international community that nuclear weapons are useful tools of
aggression, thereby incentivizing revisionist states to acquire their
own arsenals]{.underline}. As Umland and Von Essen provocatively put it,
["[Russia's renewed aggression]{.mark} makes it [look as if the
\[NPT\]'s purpose is to keep weak countries **defenseless**]{.mark} and
[prey to]{.mark} the **[nuclear-weapon states.]{.mark}**]{.underline}
Russian President [Vladimir Putin said as much at the start of the war
when he announced that he had put his country's nuclear forces on alert
and issued ominous threats to anyone daring to get in Russia's
way]{.underline}."54 According to Budjeryn, it "seems fair to
assume...[that if Russia were not a nuclear power and therefore could
not use nuclear threats to deter any direct Western involvement, its
calculations about invading Ukraine would have been very
different]{.underline}."55 Timothy Snyder argues that "[[If Russian
**nuclear blackmail** succeeds]{.mark}, we can [expect]{.mark} not only
more Russian nuclear blackmail but also [nuclear blackmail from other
nuclear powers]{.mark}."56 **[Aggressive states]{.mark}**--- potentially
Iran, for example---that [**internalize**]{.mark} these
[messages]{.mark} may [have]{.mark} a stronger [incentive to seek
nuclear weapons]{.mark} since they believe they will allow them to
fulfill more **expansive geopolitical aims.**]{.underline}

### Prolif Bad\-\--East Asia

#### The US is likely to prevent proliferation in East Asia because it would worsen regional security, spark arms races, and undermine alliances.

// gmemb

The simultaneous rise of China and substantial advancements in North
Korea's nuclear capabilities have contributed to an increasingly tense
security environment in East Asia. In response, both Japan and South
Korea have increased their investments in defense, including in missile
and missiledefense capabilities.105 Compounding matters, South Korean
and Japanese officials have increasingly questioned the reliability of
the US as an ally, leading to a reevaluation of nuclear options.106
[Despite this, [it is **unlikely** that either South Korea or Japan
will]{.mark} move to [acquire their own nuclear weapons]{.mark} in the
next decade, as the US is likely to have the incentive and capacity to
reassure both countries while cautioning them against an independent
nuclear program.]{.underline}

As discussed above, [[the US has a **successful track record**]{.mark}
of [preventing proliferation in]{.mark} East [Asia]{.mark}, even in the
context of concerns about US reliability and perceptions of American
decline.]{.underline} Both [[for geopolitical]{.mark}
[reasons]{.mark}---to balance against China's rising power---and
nonproliferation reasons, the US has a stron**g incentive** to reassure
South Korea and Japan and strengthen the **American
commitment**.]{.underline} While a potential return of Trump to the
presidency could call this into question, a strong bipartisan consensus
has developed on the importance of competing with China,107 which is
likely to translate into bipartisan support for maintaining and/or
strengthening ties with Japan especially, but also South Korea. The
Biden administration recently made substantial efforts in this regard,
responding to comments by the South Korean president about a potential
nuclear program by strengthening the alliance. The so-called "Washington
Declaration" provides for enhanced consultation on matters of nuclear
deterrence, closer operational planning at the conventional level, and
visits to South Korea by nuclear-armed US submarines. As part of the
declaration, South Korea reaffirmed its intention to abide by its NPT
commitment to remain non-nuclear.108 The Biden administration likewise
strengthened its commitment to Japan, endorsing Tokyo's decision to
substantially expand its military capabilities.109 The US, South Korea,
and Japan also agreed to expand cooperation on missile defense.110

[Even if Japanese or South Korean leaders are not fully satisfied with
US efforts at reassurance, the alternative---[an independent nuclear
weapons program]{.mark}---is likely to [be perceived as too **costly**
or **risky**]{.mark}. Pursuing nuclear weapons would [expose either
country to **nuclear trade sanctions**]{.mark}, **seriously damaging**
their substantial nuclear energy programs, could cause the US to
downgrade or terminate alliance arrangements, and would likely [lead to
**substantial Chinese sanctions**.]{.mark}111]{.underline}

While some have argued the US would (or should) look the other way if
South Korea or Japan go nuclear,112 consistent with the argument above
that intense geopolitical competition outweighs nonproliferation
concerns, this is unlikely for several reasons. First, unlike prior
cases like Britain and France, [South Korea and Japan would be
proliferating in the context of a **robust nonproliferation regime**
Washington has a strong incentive to uphold.]{.underline} While the US
could still choose to prioritize great power competition, as it did with
Pakistan in the 1980s, the implications here would be different since
(unlike Pakistan) South Korea and Japan are parties to the NPT.
Legitimizing their withdrawal from the treaty could provide cover for
other countries, such as Iran or Saudi Arabia, to do the same.

Second, leaving aside the NPT, [a [nuclear-armed Japan or South Korea
would]{.mark} be **much [more dangerous f]{.mark}**[or the US]{.mark}
than a nuclear Pakistan because it could [spark **nuclear crises** and
**arms races**]{.mark} in a region where the US is deeply
involved.]{.underline} The US has always been unlikely to become
directly involved in an India-Pakistan war, but the same cannot be said
for a war involving South vs. North Korea or a war involving China vs.
Japan. It is, therefore, very much in the US interest to ensure there
are as few "nuclear buttons" at play as possible in any conflict
scenario and to avoid potentially dangerous crises that could occur if
China or North Korea sought to prevent their rivals from acquiring
nuclear weapons.

Third, while India and Pakistan's acquisition of nuclear weapons did do
damage to the nonproliferation regime, it did not fundamentally call
into question the value of US security commitments since neither country
had a firm alliance with the US.113 By contrast, [if South Korea or
Japan went nuclear, it could [send a message that US alliance guarantees
are **not sufficient**]{.mark} to ensure security, a message American
officials would be loath to send.]{.underline}

In short, [the US is **likely** to have the **will and capacity** to do
what it takes to persuade Japan and South Korea to remain non-nuclear,
even in the context of an increasingly tense security
environment.]{.underline}

// gmemb

[For more than three decades, the prospect of additional [proliferation
in the Middle East has]{.mark} [commanded **international
attention**]{.mark},]{.underline} as Iraq, Iran, Syria, and Libya all
made efforts to acquire nuclear weapons at various points. While Iraq,
Syria, and Libya's nuclear programs were all halted through sanctions,
diplomacy, and/or force, today, [[Iran]{.mark} stands [**closer**
to]{.mark} the [nuclear weapons]{.mark} threshold than at **any time**
in its history]{.underline}. While the US intelligence community
continues to assess that Iran has not made the decision to produce
nuclear weapons, its breakout time is currently a matter of days, as it
continues to stockpile more and more 60% enriched uranium.114 Meanwhile,
[[**Saudi** officials]{.mark} are working to build a nuclear energy
program while simultaneously [making clear]{.mark} that [if Iran
acquires nuclear weapons, they will **do the
same**]{.mark}.]{.underline}115 Compared to East Asia, [there is [**more
reason** to worry about proliferation in the Middle]{.mark} East since
two of the **[key risk]{.mark} [factors]{.mark}** identified above are
more salient in this region: namely, the [erosion of the efficacy of US
sanctions and dealmaking]{.mark} and the possibility that **[intensified
geopolitical competition]{.mark}** will [outweigh]{.mark} [proliferation
concerns]{.mark}.]{.underline}

For allies like Japan and South Korea, the US wields enormous leverage
through its role as a security provider. For adversaries like Iran, by
contrast, leverage depends much more on the ability to impose economic
pain, which means the erosion of the efficacy of US sanctions is more
salient. The trajectory of the Iranian nuclear program over the last
decade bears this out[. The combination of powerful US and multilateral
sanctions was crucial in bringing Iran to the negotiating table in 2013,
ultimately leading to the JCPOA.]{.underline}116 However, Trump's
withdrawal from the deal in 2018, despite Iranian compliance,
significantly undercut the credibility of US diplomacy. When the Biden
administration took office and commenced negotiations for the revival of
the JCPOA, Iran sought "guarantees" against the possibility of a future
US withdrawal, which proved to be a major obstacle in what were
ultimately unsuccessful negotiations.117 At the same time, Iran has
gotten better at weathering the impact of US sanctions, substantially
increasing its oil exports in part due to sanctions evasion
techniques.118

In combination, these two factors significantly diminish Washington's
ability to use sanctions to negotiate limits on Iran's nuclear program:
the costs of sanctions are declining, and Iran's belief that it can
avoid them by making concessions is declining as well. The fact [that
[Iran has]{.mark} **[steadily expanded]{.mark}** its nuclear program
[since Trump's]{.mark} 2018 [**withdrawal** from]{.mark} the
[JCPOA]{.mark}]{.underline} is reflective of this fact[.]{.underline} At
the same time as US leverage has declined and the Iranian nuclear
program has advanced, the security environment in the Middle East has
deteriorated, with an Israel-Iran shadow war now compounded by the
ongoing war between Israel and the Iran-backed Hamas, which has also
included skirmishes with the Iran-backed Houthis and Hezbollah---a war
that analysts worry could escalate to direct Iranian involvement.119

In this context, it is possible that Iranian leaders could decide to try
to cross the weapons threshold in the coming years, banking on the fact
that the US and Israel would not have the will or capacity to go to war
to prevent it. While one might hope [[Russia and]{.mark}/or
[China]{.mark} would pressure Iran not to take this step, the fact that
they did not play a particularly constructive role in the JCPOA revival
talks suggests they may be [putting nonproliferation on the **back
burner**]{.mark}, focusing instead on their competition with the US and
its allies.]{.underline} Neither Russia nor China would relish an Iran
with nuclear weapons, but they also derive strategic benefits from the
relationship that could make them reticent to turn the screws on Tehran,
whether in terms of discounted oil for China or the drones and missiles
Iran is providing to Russia to aid its war effort in Ukraine.120 [[If
Iran]{.mark} does [acquire nuclear weapons]{.mark} in the coming years,
[Saudi Arabia would feel **strong pressure** to]{.mark} respond in some
fashion, consistent with many prior statements by Saudi
officials.]{.underline} Before the war between Israel and Hamas broke
out in October 2023, the US and Saudi Arabia were engaged in
negotiations that would provide for Saudi normalization of relations
with Israel, some form of American assistance to a Saudi nuclear energy
program, and a formal US defense pact for Riyadh.121 If such an
agreement were reached and Saudi Arabia came under US protection in a
similar fashion to Japan and South Korea, this would likely be
sufficient to reassure Riyadh and sway them away from seeking their own
nuclear weapons.

[However, if such an agreement fails to materialize, and the US, China,
and Russia continue to compete for the allegiance of what they deem to
be a strategically crucial partner, this [geopolitical
environment]{.mark} could [provide]{.mark} a [**fertile environment**
for Saudi]{.mark} Arabia [to advance]{.mark} its nuclear
[capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}. As described above, this sort of
competition could lead to the provision of nuclear technology to Saudi
Arabia with laxer conditions than is typical in US nuclear cooperation
agreements. This competition could also result in a reluctance to impose
punishment on Saudi Arabia if they decided to develop a nuclear weapons
program for fear of "losing" Riyadh to a rival bloc in the context of a
"new Cold War." Indeed, Washington has already demonstrated a reluctance
to punish Saudi Arabia, for instance, when it was found to be building a
covert ballistic missile factory, orchestrated the murder of Jamal
Khashoggi, and cut production in order to increase oil prices,
undercutting the US effort to contain Russia after its invasion of
Ukraine.122 [In contrast to East Asia, where the US is likely to have
the will and capacity to prevent further proliferation, in the Middle
East, [it is]{.mark} much more [**questionable** whether]{.mark} the
g[reat powers could or would do the same.]{.mark}]{.underline}

// gmemb

March 5, 2020 marks the 50th anniversary of the entry into effect of
the [Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear
Weapons](https://www.un.org/disarmament/wmd/nuclear/npt/text/) (NPT).
Five decades on, is the treaty achieving what was originally envisioned?
Where is it succeeding in curbing the spread of nuclear weapons, and
where might it be falling short? Four Brookings experts on defense and
arms control weigh in to assess the NPT today.

Current arsenals are big, but they are only about one-fifth the size of
what they were a half-century ago. [While superpower arms control, and
the end of the Cold War, deserve most of the credit for the reductions
(along with restraint by China, in particular, in not build,ing up too
much), the NPT created some of the broader political context and moral
pressure that led to these reductions.]{.underline} While it sought to
prevent non-nuclear states from ever getting the bomb, its main bargain
also required the existing nuclear weapons states to reduce and
ultimately eliminate their arsenals to hold up their own ends of the
bargain.

[The arsenals of the United States and Russia still account for more
than 90% of the total number of warheads on Earth today. The United
Kingdom, France, China, India, and Pakistan each likely possesses
between 150 and 300, with Israel's unconfirmed arsenal totaling almost
100 bombs]{.underline}. North Korea probably has a couple dozen nuclear
weapons, with enough fissile material to make a few dozen more. That
said, the situation is not entirely grim[. [While nuclear proliferation
continues]{.mark}, and nine countries are known to possess nuclear
weapons, the fear once expressed by John F. Kennedy that at least a
couple dozen countries could have the bomb by the 21st century has not
panned out. And of course, [nuclear weapons have **not** been
used]{.mark} again [in **combat**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

An additional achievement, for which a few of my colleagues here deserve
some of the credit, is the tightening of inspection regimens under the
NPT. In particular, the so-called ["[Additional
Protocol](https://www.iaea.org/topics/additional-protocol)" has created
the right for inspectors to go to places where they suspect monkey
business, even if those sites are not officially declared by the country
in question.]{.underline} This arrangement tends to work only if
national intelligence capabilities, and/or whistleblowers, provide
information about suspicious activities. But at that point, inspectors
can be more effective than in the years before the Additional Protocol
concept was developed and legitimated. It has helped make the nuclear
inspections in the Iran nuclear deal much more effective (even if other
aspects of that deal have proven highly controversial). A similar
concept would almost surely be used in any nuclear deal with North Korea
in the years ahead.

[[Without]{.mark} the [treaty]{.mark}, the powerful [norm against
proliferation]{.mark} it created, its associated controls on exports of
sensitive technologies, the rigorous International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) monitoring system, [and the threat of sanctions]{.mark} for
violating nonproliferation obligations, we [would be living in the world
of many nuclear-armed states]{.mark} that President John F. Kennedy
predicted.]{.underline} As Mike points out, [today there are only nine
countries with nuclear weapons, the same number as 25 years ago --- a
remarkable indication of the NPT's durability and its contribution to
international stability.]{.underline}

[[Without the treaty]{.mark}, and the confidence provided by its IAEA
verification system that nuclear equipment and materials would not be
diverted to the production of nuclear weapons, the widespread [use of
nuclear energy for peaceful purposes would not have been
possible]{.mark} --- not just for electricity generation, but also for
the production of isotopes for use in medicine, agriculture, and
industry.]{.underline}

While the NPT's central goal was to prevent additional nuclear-armed
states, it sought [to assure non-nuclear weapon states]{.underline} (who
were required to renounce nuclear arms) [that the [asymmetry
between]{.mark} them and the five original nuc[lear
powers]{.mark}]{.underline} (who were allowed to keep their nuclear
weapons) [[would not last forever]{.underline}]{.mark}. It therefore
obligated the five --- China, France, Russia, the U.K., and the U.S. ---
to [make "good faith" efforts to reduce and ultimately eliminate their
nuclear arsenals.]{.underline}

In the last 50 years, the United States and the USSR/Russia have made
huge progress toward nuclear disarmament, reducing their nuclear weapons
inventories by close to 90% from Cold War levels. Mike is right that
they pursued nuclear arms limitations and reductions primarily because
they believed such arms agreements would serve their own security
interests, not because they were obliged to do so under the NPT. But
Mike is also right that the NPT helped create the stable strategic
framework in which such agreements were acceptable to the superpowers.
And [the desire of Washington and Moscow to ensure the success of the
treaty and its nonproliferation goal gave them additional incentive to
pursue nuclear disarmament.]{.underline}

So the NPT's first 50 years have been remarkably successful. But there
are warning signs that its continued success cannot be taken for
granted.

[The [international security environment has become increasingly
unsettled]{.mark}. U.S.-Russian and U.S.-Chinese bilateral relations
have sharply deteriorated. With the [growing strategic
capabilities]{.mark} of additional countries, especially China, the
bipolar model of stability has become outdated. [New technologies and
types of weapon]{.mark}s --- including offensive cyber, counter-space,
and hypersonic weapons --- [could further **destabilize**]{.mark}
the]{.underline} security environment.

### Prolif Bad\-\--Deterrence Theory False

#### Deterrence theory is false \-\-- empirics 

**Barash 18** \[David P. Barash is professor of psychology emeritus at
the University of Washington, "Nuclear deterrence is a myth. And a
lethal one at that," 01/14/2018,
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/14/nuclear-deterrence-myth-lethal-david-barash\]

[[Deterrence]{.mark}, in short, **[does not
deter.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

The pattern is deep and geographically widespread.
[[Nuclear]{.mark}-armed [**France** couldn't prevail over]{.mark} the
**[non-nuclear Algeria]{.mark}n** National Liberation
Front]{.underline}. The US nuclear arsenal didn't inhibit North Korea
from seizing a US intelligence-gathering vessel, the USS Pueblo, in
1968. Even today, this boat remains in North Korean hands.

[[US nukes didn't enable China to get Vietnam to end]{.mark} its
[invasion of Cambodia]{.mark}]{.underline} in 1979. [Nor did [US]{.mark}
nuclear [weapons stop **Iran**]{.mark}ian Revolutionary
Guards]{.underline} from capturing US diplomats and holding them hostage
(1979-81), just as fear of US nuclear weapons didn't empower the US and
its allies to force Iraq to retreat from Kuwait without a fight in 1990.

In Nuclear Weapons and Coercive Diplomacy (2017), the political
scientists Todd Sechser and Matthew Fuhrmann examined 348 territorial
disputes occurring between 1919 and 1995. [They used
[statistical]{.mark} [analysis to see whether nuclear-armed states were
more successful]{.mark} than conventional countries in coercing their
adversaries during territorial disputes. **[They
weren't.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[Not only that, but [nuclear weapons didn't embolden those who own them
to escalate demands]{.mark}; if anything, such [countries were]{.mark}
somewhat [**less successful** in getting their way]{.mark}]{.underline}.
In some cases, the analysis is almost comical. Thus, among the very few
cases in which threats from a nuclear-armed country were coded as having
compelled an opponent was the US insistence, in 1961, that the Dominican
Republic hold democratic elections following the assassination of the
dictator Rafael Trujillo, as well as the US demand, in 1994, following a
Haitian military coup, that the Haitian colonels restore Jean-Bertrand
Aristide to power. In 1974-75, nuclear China forced non-nuclear Portugal
to surrender its claim to Macau. These examples were included because
the authors honestly sought to consider all cases in which a
nuclear-armed country got its way vis-à-vis a non-nuclear one. But no
serious observer would attribute the capitulation of Portugal or the
Dominican Republic to the nuclear weapons of China or the US.

[All of this also suggests that the acquisition of nuclear weapons by
Iran or North Korea is **unlikely** to enable these countries to coerce
others, whether their 'targets' are armed with nuclear or conventional
weapons.]{.underline}

It is one thing to conclude that nuclear deterrence hasn't necessarily
deterred, and hasn't provided coercive power -- but its extraordinary
risks are even more discrediting.

#### Nuclear weapons are not credible methods for deterrence and increase risk of conflict

**Barash 18** \[David P. Barash is professor of psychology emeritus at
the University of Washington, "Nuclear deterrence is a myth. And a
lethal one at that," 01/14/2018,
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/14/nuclear-deterrence-myth-lethal-david-barash\]

[First, [deterrence via nuclear weapons **lacks
credibility.**]{.mark}]{.underline} A police officer armed with a
backpack nuclear weapon would be unlikely to deter a robber: 'Stop in
the name of the law, or I'll blow us all up!' Similarly, during the Cold
War, NATO generals lamented that towns in West Germany were less than
two kilotons apart -- which meant that defending Europe with nuclear
weapons would destroy it, and so the claim that the Red Army would be
deterred by nuclear means was literally incredible. The result was the
elaboration of smaller, more accurate tactical weapons that would be
more usable and, thus, whose employment in a crisis would be more
credible. [But [deployed weapons]{.mark} that are more usable, and thus
more credible as deterrents, [are more liable to be
used.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Second, [deterrence requires]{.mark} that [each side's arsenal remains
invulnerable to attack]{.mark}, or at least that such an attack would be
prevented insofar as a potential victim retained a 'second-strike'
retaliatory capability, sufficient to prevent such an attack in the
first place]{.underline}. Over time, however, nuclear missiles have
become increasingly accurate, raising concerns about the vulnerability
of these weapons to a 'counterforce' strike. In brief, nuclear states
are increasingly able to target their adversary's nuclear weapons for
destruction. In the perverse argot of deterrence theory, this is called
counterforce vulnerability, with 'vulnerability' referring to the
target's nuclear weapons, not its population. [[The]{.mark} [clearest
outcome of increasingly accurate nuclear weapons]{.mark} and the
'counterforce vulnerability' component of deterrence theory [is to
**increase the likelihood of a first strike**]{.mark},]{.underline}
while also increasing the danger that a potential victim, fearing such
an event, might be tempted to pre-empt with its own first strike. [[The
resulting situation]{.mark} -- in which each side perceives a possible
advantage in striking first -- [is **dangerously
unstable.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Third, [deterrence theory assumes **optimal rationality**]{.mark} on
the part of decision-makers]{.underline}. It presumes that those with
their fingers on the nuclear triggers are rational actors who will also
remain calm and cognitively unimpaired under extremely stressful
conditions. [It also [presumes]{.mark} that [leaders will always retain
control]{.mark} over their forces and that, moreover, they will always
retain control over their emotions as well, making decisions based
solely on a cool calculation of strategic costs and
benefits.]{.underline} Deterrence theory maintains, in short, that each
side will scare the pants off the other with the prospect of the most
hideous, unimaginable consequences, and will then conduct itself with
the utmost deliberate and precise rationality. [Virtually [everything
known about human psychology suggests]{.mark} that [this is
**absurd**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In Black Lamb and Grey Falcon: A Journey Through Yugoslavia (1941),
Rebecca West noted that: 'Only part of us is sane: only part of us loves
pleasure and the longer day of happiness, wants to live to our 90s and
die in peace ...' It requires no arcane wisdom to know that people often
act out of misperceptions, anger, despair, insanity, stubbornness,
revenge, pride and/or dogmatic conviction. Moreover, in certain
situations -- as when either side is convinced that war is inevitable,
or when the pressures to avoid losing face are especially intense -- an
irrational act, including a lethal one, can appear appropriate, even
unavoidable.

When he ordered the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese defence
minister observed that: 'Sometimes it is necessary to close one's eyes
and jump off the platform of the Kiyomizu Temple \[a renowned suicide
spot\].' During the First World War, Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany wrote
in the margin of a government document that: 'Even if we are destroyed,
England at least will lose India.'

While in his bunker, during the final days of the Second World War,
Adolf Hitler ordered what he hoped would be the total destruction of
Germany, because he felt that Germans had 'failed' him.

Consider, as well, a US president who shows signs of mental illness, and
whose statements and tweets are frighteningly consistent with dementia
or genuine psychosis. [National [leaders]{.mark} -- nuclear-armed or not
-- **[aren't immune to mental illness]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Yet,
deterrence theory presumes otherwise.

#### Nuclear buildup does not credibly deter conflict 

**Barash 18** \[David P. Barash is professor of psychology emeritus at
the University of Washington, "Nuclear deterrence is a myth. And a
lethal one at that," 01/14/2018,
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/14/nuclear-deterrence-myth-lethal-david-barash\]

In his classic The Evolution of Nuclear Strategy (1989), Lawrence
Freedman, the dean of British military historians and strategists,
concluded: 'The Emperor Deterrence may have no clothes, but he is still
Emperor.' Despite his nakedness, this emperor continues to strut about,
receiving deference he doesn't deserve, while endangering the entire
world. Nuclear deterrence is an idea that became a potentially lethal
ideology, one that remains influential despite having been increasingly
discredited.

After the United States' nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in
1945, war changed. Until then, the overriding purpose of military forces
had ostensibly been to win wars. But according to the influential US
strategist Bernard Brodie writing in 1978: 'From now on its chief
purpose must be to avert them. It can have almost no other useful
purpose.'

Thus, nuclear deterrence was born, a seemingly rational arrangement by
which peace and stability were to arise by the threat of mutually
assured destruction (MAD, appropriately enough).

Winston Churchill described it in 1955 with characteristic vigour:
'Safety will be the sturdy child of terror, and survival the twin
brother of annihilation.'

Importantly, deterrence became not only a purported strategy, but the
very grounds on which governments justified nuclear weapons themselves.
Every government that now possesses nuclear weapons claims that they
deter attacks by their threat of catastrophic retaliation.

[Even a brief examination, however, reveals that [deterrence is not
**remotely** ]{.mark}**as [compelling]{.mark}** a principle as its
reputation suggests.]{.underline} In his novel The Ambassadors (1903),
Henry James described a certain beauty as 'a jewel brilliant and hard',
at once twinkling and trembling, adding that 'what seemed all surface
one moment seemed all depth the next'. The public has been bamboozled by
the shiny surface appearance of deterrence, with its promise of
strength, security and safety. But what has been touted as profound
strategic depth crumbles with surprising ease when subjected to critical
scrutiny.

Let's start by considering the core of deterrence theory: that it has
worked.

[Advocates of nuclear deterrence insist that we should thank it for the
fact that a third world war has been avoided, even when tensions between
the two superpowers -- the US and the USSR -- ran high.]{.underline}

Some supporters even maintain that deterrence set the stage for the fall
of the Soviet Union and the defeat of Communism. In this telling, the
West's nuclear deterrent prevented the USSR from invading western
Europe, and delivered the world from the threat of Communist tyranny.

[There are, however, [compelling arguments suggest]{.mark}ing that [the
US and]{.mark} the former [Soviet Union avoided world war for
several]{.mark} possible [reasons]{.mark}, most [notably because neither
side wanted to go to war.]{.mark} Indeed, [the US and Russia never
fought a war prior to the nuclear age]{.mark}.]{.underline} Singling out
nuclear weapons as the reason why the Cold War never became hot is
somewhat like saying that a junkyard car, without an engine or wheels,
never sped off the lot only because no one turned the key. Logically
speaking, there is no way to demonstrate that nuclear weapons kept the
peace during the Cold War, or that they do so now.

[Perhaps [peace prevailed]{.mark} between the two superpowers simply
[because they had **no quarrel** that justified fighting a]{.mark}
terribly destructive [war]{.mark}, even a conventional one.]{.underline}

[[There is **no evidence**]{.mark}, for example, [that the Soviet
leadership]{.mark} **ever [contemplated]{.mark}** [trying to conquer
western Europe]{.mark}, much [less that it was restrained by the West's
nuclear arsenal]{.mark}. [Post facto arguments --]{.mark} especially
negative ones -- might be the currency of pundits, but [are **impossible
to prove**, and offer **no solid ground**]{.mark} for evaluating a
counterfactual claim, conjecturing why something has not
happened.]{.underline}

In colloquial terms, if a dog does not bark in the night, can we say
with certainty that no one walked by the house? Deterrence enthusiasts
are like the woman who sprayed perfume on her lawn every morning. When a
perplexed neighbour asked about this strange behaviour, she replied: 'I
do it to keep the elephants away.' The neighbour protested: 'But there
aren't any elephants within 10,000 miles of here,' whereupon the
perfume-sprayer replied: 'You see, it works!'

# Impact\-\--Putin Regime Collapse

## Uniqueness\-\--Regime Collapse Now

### Collapse Now\-\--Ukraine

#### Ukrainian resistance has fractured Russian confidence in the Kremlin 

**Savostianov 25** \[Savostianov worked as deputy head of the
administration of President Boris Yeltsin, "IS PUTIN'S COLLAPSE
POSSIBLE?" 01/2025,
https://www.afpc.org/uploads/documents/AFPC8176_Special_Report-Is_Putins_Collapse_Possible\_-web.pdf\]

[During the first eight years of his rule, President Putin enjoyed the
genuine and near-unanimous support of the Russian people.]{.underline}
This backing was fueled by an atmosphere of fear created by the 1999
bombings that took place in major Russian cities, and Putin's resolute
promise to defeat terrorism. The rapid economic growth of those years
likewise helped bolster Putin's standing, leading to tangible
improvements in the lives of tens of millions.

[The period from 2008 to 2014, however, brought [gradual
**disillusionment**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Economic growth slowed
significantly, and even declined, while living standards stagnated or
fell. Obvious machinations to retain power---such as the theatrical use
of Dmitry Medvedev as a placeholder president until 2012---as well as
the suppression of independent media and the growing sense of individual
powerlessness all contributed to an erosion of Putin's image.

[The [annexation of Crimea]{.mark} and the conflict in Eastern Ukraine
provided a potent shot in the arm for the president's
popularity]{.underline}. In a wave of pseudo-patriotic fervor,
orange-and-black "St. George's ribbons," the official symbol of
aggression and military triumph, appeared everywhere. Images of the
"polite people"---the special forces troops who seized Crimea---and the
"little green men," undesignated Russian soldiers who took over parts of
Eastern Ukraine, enjoyed widespread popularity. The battlefield triumph
even led some to entertain the idea of reclaiming Alaska as well.1

[However, like with any other artificial stimulant, the [effects
**quickly** wore off]{.mark}. The dire [state of the national
economy]{.mark} could only be partially offset by the Kremlin's effort
to hype the narrative of an unsullied Russia surrounded by the dark and
corrupt forces of the West]{.underline}. Putin's position, though, was
bolstered by the inexplicable blindness of European leaders,
who---despite being competent financial managers---proved shockingly
naïve in their assessment of Russia's strategic direction.

As always, though, objective circumstances prevailed over subjective
ones. [The [mounting **domestic crisis of confidence**]{.mark} in Putin
became increasingly apparent. His [regime]{.mark} sought to [suppress it
through the murders and repression of opponents]{.mark}, the rollback of
remaining civil rights, [and constitutional manipulations]{.mark} that
effectively cemented his lifetime rule as a dictator]{.underline}. The
culmination of this trend was Putin's decision to depend on a familiar
strategy, that of fomenting a "short, victorious war," and set his
sights on Ukraine anew.

[[Had]{.mark} the [Ukrain]{.mark}ian people [conformed]{.mark} to the
image crafted for Putin by his intelligence agencies and
propagandists]{.underline}, or had President Volodymyr Zelenskyy
accepted U.S. President Joe Biden's offer to flee instead of resisting,
events might have unfolded just as Putin planned. Ukraine would have
been conquered, and a frightened Europe---disarmed through the policies
of its own leaders---would have been ready to make significant
concessions. [And once again, [the Russian people would have
rallied]{.mark} around Vladimir the Victor.]{.underline}

[[That]{.mark}, however, **[did not happen]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A
thousand days on, [it is evident that [Putin's plan failed]{.mark} and
[Russia is embroiled in a prolonged war]{.mark} without a clear purpose,
entailing enormous human, material, and reputational losses. All of
[this]{.mark} has [created visible fractures in Russian
society]{.mark}---[fractures]{.mark} which **[continue to grow]{.mark}**
as the conflict drags on.]{.underline}

#### Putin's refusal to end conflict is creating widespread public disapproval & backlash

WARSAW, POLAND -- "[[Putin's refusal to compromise]{.mark} on Ukraine,
analysts say, [is a **colossal error**]{.mark} [costing Russia]{.mark}
regional [influence]{.mark}, lucrative [energy markets and its place in
the world]{.mark}]{.underline}," reads the opening line to a recent
article in the US newspaper, the Washington Post.

The subtext of the message being delivered by different analysts is that
the refusal of the Russian President, former KGB Lt. Col. Vladimir
Vladimirovich Putin, to change strategy or brook any compromise on the
future course of his war in Ukraine is causing irreparable damage to his
country.

This is not just the opinion of a single columnist of one American
newspaper. The list of those who see long-term disastrous consequences
for Russia -- individuals both well-known and known only to those of us
who have lived and worked in Russia in the past -- grows by the day.

After the February 2022 full-invasion of Ukraine, one of the first to
come out with dire predictions for the future of Putin's homeland was
retired US Army Lt. Gen. Ben Hodges. The retired three-star was the
former head of European Command EUCOM and was also the one-time Pershing
Chair for Strategic Studies at the Centre for European Policy Analysis
(CEPA).

Hodges's dire predictions for the disintegration of Moscow's sprawling
landmass began in the latter half of 2022, when he spoke on the subject
with the Australian Broadcasting Service (ABC OZ).

A Warning to Russia -- Predictions and What Leads to Collapse

[Putin's [failure to]{.mark} successfully [defeat Ukraine]{.mark} could
be [the **beginning of the end**]{.mark} for the Russian Federation,
summarizing his assessment.]{.underline}

"There are centrifugal forces at work that are going to pull it apart,"
he told Australia's ABC News Daily podcast. "[I believe [we need to be
prepared for]{.mark} the possibility of th[e break-up of the Russian
Federation.]{.mark}"]{.underline}

This sentiment is now one increasingly expressed among Russia-watchers
and those analysing the impact of the war in Ukraine.

It is also not the first time in Russian history that this has occurred
-- what seemed at the time to be a small-scale failure with cascading
effects ultimately led to the end of an empire.

Ukraine is a nation orders of magnitude smaller than Russia and with
none of its endless resources. But it is becoming another "David and
Goliath"-type confrontation in which Russia has come out on the losing
end.

In 1979, the USSR invades Afghanistan and is forced to withdraw a decade
later -- having lost 15,000 military personnel and achieved almost none
of the objectives that prompted the incursion in the first place.

In late 1981 and under pressure from the Soviet Union, the Communist
Party here in Poland instituted martial law to stamp out the Solidarity
labor movement that was agitating for political freedoms. This period of
repression ended in 1983, but instead of seeing the Solidarity movement
dismembered Poland experienced even greater labor unrest.

By the end of the decade, the Polish Communist authorities are forced to
bring the organization's leaders into a cohabitation government, which
eventually causes its dissolution and the creation of the modern,
democratic Polish state.

Both instances are today assessed as the watershed moments that were the
beginning of the end for the Soviet Union.

[[Moscow's efforts to hold onto the empire]{.mark} by force in response
to these initial [indicat]{.mark}ors that [the]{.mark} [system was
collapsing]{.mark} from within only accelerated that
decline.]{.underline}

Petulance Triumphing Over Common Sense Created Russia's Situation Today

Russian officials today explain Putin's determination to prosecute the
war as a necessary, strategic imperative and that this is the only way
to "save Russia from NATO aggression" and "Ukrainian Nazis."

However, most Western analysts view his continued petulance in
continuing the war without regard for its effects on the nation and his
refusal to compromise on any of his maximalist demands for a peace
agreement as fatal, strategic errors.

[The [ultimate price will be a **near-complete loss** of Russia's global
influence]{.mark}, its few allies deciding to decouple from Moscow, [and
a loss of the energy export markets keeping the economy alive]{.mark} is
the likely outcome.]{.underline}

Putin, writes the UK Independent correspondent Owen Matthews today, "is
living on borrowed time."

"Russia has begun running a fiscal deficit of some 1.5 per cent of GDP,"
he observes.

"And most seriously of all, global oil prices have fallen a precipitous
35 per cent this year. As a result, Russia's Central Bank is set to
print 15 trillion roubles (£142bn) in cash come October -- the largest
issuance since the hyperinflation of the 1990s."

"Putin, evidently, remains set on pursuing his obsession with
subjugating Ukraine, apparently at any cost," he continues. "[[Polls
suggest]{.mark} that the [number of]{.mark} ordinary [Russians who
agree]{.mark} with their leader's dogged obsession [is
dwindling]{.mark}]{.underline}[."]{.mark}

"According to a study by Levada, Russia's last independent pollster, in
June, 64 per cent of respondents favored peace talks, which is six
percentage points up since March. At the same time, the number of people
who wanted the war to continue fell to 28 per cent, down from 34 per
cent in March. "

There are no indicators that this downward trajectory of these economic
trends will alter. [Further [eroding]{.mark} the [population]{.mark}'s
[support]{.mark} for the war is the continued increase in both Ukrainian
drone attacks on Russian cities [and economic deterioration]{.mark}
across the nation will only further erode. The combination [is likely to
lead to]{.mark} the **[collapse of the Russian
state.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

One might expect Putin to have the foresight to understand the perils of
continuing to pursue a course of action that has led his country to the
brink of instability. But there is very little evidence to suggest that
he is willing to do so, [which could very well [be]{.mark} his -- as
well as **[Russia's -- undoing.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

isn't farfetched --- [[Russia's military]{.mark} has already [sustained
staggering losses]{.mark} of over [790,000 killed or wounded]{.mark} and
[lost]{.mark} more than [21,000 vehicles and equipment pieces]{.mark}.
Their [military capability]{.mark} is being [hollowed]{.mark} out while
their [economy]{.mark} [strains]{.mark} under the pressure.]{.underline}

Putin's Regime: The Initial Fracture Point

The clearest immediate threat would come from within Putin's regime
itself. As research from the Institute for the Study of War suggests,
["Putin has taken significant risks by choosing not to enact policies
that would boost Russia's war effort in a sustainable way, believing
that Russia will be able to win the war and force concessions out of
Ukraine and the West before Putin is forced to make such
decisions".]{.underline} A decisive Ukrainian surge would shatter this
calculation.

Ukraine's battlefield success would trigger what analysts call "Variant
3 --- Internal Destabilisation":

["The [threat of a military defeat in Ukraine]{.mark},]{.underline}
especially after a long and costly war, [may be a [signal]{.mark} to
Russian society that the [Russian authorities]{.mark} have [lost]{.mark}
their [mandate]{.mark}.]{.underline} It would also [[increase]{.mark}
the [risk of mutiny]{.mark} among military commanders, who would be
forced to [fight]{.mark} a war [with insufficiently trained soldiers and
without]{.mark} the [necessary equipment".]{.mark}]{.underline}

The critical factor is that [[Putin]{.mark} has deliberately [avoided
full mobilisation and war economy measures]{.mark} to [shield]{.mark}
the [general population from the war's effects.]{.mark} A [Ukrainian
breakthrough]{.mark} would [force]{.mark} impossible choices: another
hugely unpopular [mobilisation]{.mark}, [economic collapse]{.mark},
[or]{.mark} accepting [defeat]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Economic Implosion

[Russia's economy]{.underline} is already bifurcated into ["two parallel
ones: [the military economy]{.mark}, that runs on orders placed by the
government with the military industries and payments to soldiers, which
has [observed growth]{.mark}; and the [civilian sector]{.mark} that
heavily [suffers]{.mark} from high [inflation]{.mark}, [price]{.mark}
[increases]{.mark}, [underemployment]{.mark} and [high credit
rates]{.mark}".]{.underline}

A [[Ukrainian breakthrough]{.underline}]{.mark} would likely
[[trigger]{.underline}]{.mark}:

1.  [**[Capital flight]{.mark}** and market collapse]{.underline} as
    elites scramble to protect assets

2.  Further [**[isolation]{.mark}** from global markets]{.underline} as
    sanctions tighten

3.  [[Collapse]{.mark} of the civilian **[economy]{.mark}**]{.underline}
    as military spending becomes unsustainable

4.  [**[Currency crisis]{.mark}** and]{.underline} potential
    **[[hyperinflation]{.underline}]{.mark}**

The Russian state's annual war costs are estimated at \$500 million to
\$1 billion per day. These costs have been sustainable only because of
Putin's careful economic management, and of course enormous volumes of
fossil fuels purchases by European countries, amongst others. But a
military defeat would shatter confidence in this system.

The Fracturing of the Federation

While complete disintegration is less likely than some Western
commentators suggest, the Russian Federation could begin to fragment
along several predictable fault lines:

["[Internal disputes within]{.mark} the [power elite]{.mark} would also
be [reflected]{.mark} in [business and administrative groups]{.mark} at
the local level and in individual entities of the Russian
Federation".]{.underline}

However, this would not immediately lead to new independent states. As
Vladimir Milov argues: ["Even if Russia does indeed disintegrate into
separate countries, there will be a [powerful drive to bring]{.mark}
those [separate lands back together]{.mark}, essentially
[recreating]{.mark} a '[re-unified Russia']{.mark} after some
time".]{.underline}

### Collapse Now\-\--Elites

#### Disillusionment and mistrust within elite circles prove a brink \-\-- Elites will use any excuse to push Putin out

**Savostianov 25** \[Savostianov worked as deputy head of the
administration of President Boris Yeltsin, "IS PUTIN'S COLLAPSE
POSSIBLE?" 01/2025,
https://www.afpc.org/uploads/documents/AFPC8176_Special_Report-Is_Putins_Collapse_Possible\_-web.pdf\]

[Yet, within months of the start of [Putin's]{.mark} "Special [Military
Operation]{.mark}" in February of 2022, this elite lost much of what it
had amassed]{.underline}. While mansions outside Moscow and along the
Black Sea remain, villas in the Riviera and Alpine châteaux are now out
of reach. Most of the wealth of this elite is likewise inaccessible, and
the jet-setting lifestyles to which they and their families had become
accustomed have been drastically curtailed. [All of which [has bred
**significant resentment**]{.mark} toward their former benefactor on the
part of Russia's new rich. [Few]{.mark}, if any, [share Putin's
**delusions**]{.mark} [about global domination]{.mark}, nuclear war, or
the complete defeat and humiliation of the United States and the
West.]{.underline}

Still, Putin remains a central figure on a number of grounds. First,
because the delicate balance of relationships this elite has cultivated
will collapse the moment Russia's president exits the stage. Russian
history amply demonstrates that, once that happens, no arrangements
relating to harmonious coexistence will protect them. Following
Lavrentiy Beria's elimination in 1953, the group that orchestrated his
death fell apart within five years, leading to Khrushchev's rule and the
dismissal of many of his "co-conspirators." In turn, a similar purge
occurred following Khrushchev's removal, with key players instrumental
in his ouster quickly sidelined.

The second reason for their residual loyalty is a fear that any
resulting instability could bring entirely new forces to power. Those
newcomers, in turn, might hold each of the current crop of elites
accountable for crimes committed during their time close to the
dictator's inner circle.

Putin understands these dynamics well. [It is no coincidence that, even
at meetings with his closest associates, no one is allowed to sit near
him, and even closed-door sessions are held with doors ajar and guards
stand ready. This [distance]{.mark}, both literal and symbolic,
[underscores]{.mark} the [distrust]{.mark} that has come to define
Putin's relationship [with those who owe]{.mark} him
everything---[and]{.mark} who now **[secretly long for his
downfall.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

It's also why Putin has increasingly emphasized the importance of a "new
elite" drawn from the military personnel involved in the invasion of
Ukraine. Moreover, he has systematically prioritized these veterans for
state benefits, preferential economic treatment, and -- increasingly --
political favors.4 The idea is clear: those who profited under Putin's
patronage but have lost much in recent years are to be replaced by new
individuals who will now go on to profit from supporting Putin (and thus
will ostensibly be more loyal). This logic, incidentally, also governs
the promotion in recent years of members of Putin's personal security
team to senior federal and regional positions.5

[By contrast, the "old elites" are now preoccupied with defending their
positions against the looming threat of displacement. This [growing
tension represents]{.mark} one of the [central fault lines]{.mark}
within the country's [leadership]{.mark}. It is a [confrontation]{.mark}
that [will **inevitably intensify**]{.mark} unless -- or until -- the
resistance of the "old elites" is completely crushed.]{.underline}

#### Regime collapse is coming \-\-- don't stop it!

**Savostianov 25** \[Savostianov worked as deputy head of the
administration of President Boris Yeltsin, "IS PUTIN'S COLLAPSE
POSSIBLE?" 01/2025,
https://www.afpc.org/uploads/documents/AFPC8176_Special_Report-Is_Putins_Collapse_Possible\_-web.pdf\]

[As we can see, behind the imposing facade of the Russian regime lies a
web of serious internal conflicts, the severity of which may be vastly
underestimated. However, as noted earlier, [many]{.mark} of these
[conflicts could be **resolved** if Putin were to **leave
power.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Will that happen? [For the reasons outlined above, [the]{.mark} sudden
[collapse of Putin's regime]{.mark}, if it happens, [should **not come
as a surprise**]{.mark}]{.underline}. A solitary and increasingly
unsuccessful autocrat, Putin is separated from this outcome by only a
few weak and fragile barriers, among them the loyalty of his
thousands-strong corps of personal security, the court elite's fear of
personal losses (or loss of station), and the pervasive fear of the
Russian state's boundless repressive machinery.

[Yet, [this]{.mark} delicate [structure]{.mark} could [crumble
**overnight**]{.mark}. Mounting [military and economic
hardships]{.mark}, including a new mobilization, could well
[ignite]{.mark} widespread [public dissatisfaction]{.mark}. Or the old
[elites]{.mark}, recognizing the impending threat of their eradication,
may [overcome]{.mark} their mutual animosity and [distrust and]{.mark}
decide to **[act decisively.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

## Uniqueness\-\--No Regime Collapse

### No Collapse\-\--Revolt

#### People will not revolt -- Putin will just kill them 

**Kolesnikov 23** \[Andrei Kolesnikov is a Former Senior Fellow at the
Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, "Regime Change in Russia Won't Lead to
Chaos or Collapse," 09/25/2023,
https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2023/09/regime-change-in-russia-wont-lead-to-chaos-or-collapse?lang=en\]

When President Vladimir Putin leaves office---however that happens---we
will enter the post-Putin era. Much about this next period in Russian
history is uncertain, and many fear what it could bring: perhaps a more
brutal leader will emerge, perhaps Russia will disintegrate, or descend
into chaos.

[Such apocalyptic predictions appeared to find confirmation in the
events of this summer, when Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin launched his
short-lived rebellion. However, the resulting [military]{.mark}
[showdown]{.mark} was [not]{.mark}, actually, [evidence of
chaos]{.mark}; [instead]{.mark}, the r[ebellion]{.mark}'s
[leaders]{.mark} quickly [wound up dead]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} its
[supporters]{.mark} either [switched sides or disappeared]{.mark} into
Russia's vast expanses.]{.underline}

With suspicions running rife in the wake of the insurrection, the
Russian elite was obliged to redouble their efforts to demonstrate
loyalty to Putin. [At the same time, most [Russians
remain]{.mark}ed---as ever---[interested]{.mark} only [in being
left]{.mark} alone to get on with their lives.]{.underline} For those
who have not been swept up in mobilization, or who prefer not to
volunteer for the front, it seems sufficient to display imitation
loyalty to the regime.

It's odd to try and scare the world with the specter of a leader more
terrible than Putin. What could be worse than the biggest military
conflict in Europe of the twenty-first century, and greater repression
in Russia than the late Soviet Union? Thanks to the Kremlin and a
spineless elite, we're already living in an anti-utopia.

Who is this future monster who would take the reins from Putin? Perhaps
Security Council head and notorious hawk Nikolai Patrushev? But is he
worse than Putin? He's just one voice of the current regime; a
spokesperson for conspiracy theories and anti-Americanism.

Would a military commander like the deceased Prigozhin be worse?
Firstly, nobody would have heard of Prigozhin if he hadn't first been
nurtured by the Putin system, allocated billions in state money, and
become the Kremlin's most talented freelancer. Secondly, you need to
have his charisma, business resources, and ability to get access to
state money to be a serious threat to the authorities. There are simply
no more such people.

[Is [a coup]{.mark} possible? It's [not in the political
culture]{.mark}. To think that conspiracy is the most likely outcome is
like seriously predicting mass protests because of falling living
standards.]{.underline}

[It's important to remember in all this that [any]{.mark} major
[anti-Putin street protest would be quashed within seconds]{.mark} by
today's police state.]{.underline} It would likely be over even quicker
than the events of January 25, 1968, when police detained eight people
protesting on Red Square against the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia.
One of the police officers who wrote up dissident Pavel Litvinov that
day uttered a phrase that would go down in history: "You fool---if you'd
stayed at home, you'd have lived a peaceful life." That's exactly the
message the authorities today are sending people.

[And, even in an anti-utopia, [Russia's social fabric is not
unraveling]{.mark}. Despite all the problems, the country's economic
system has remained relatively stable. [Russian society's ability to
adapt was underestimated]{.mark}: [alongside]{.mark} the [indifference
of most people]{.mark} to political events, a [facility for
adaptation]{.mark} helps [ensure]{.mark} at least some [support for the
authorities.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### No Collapse\-\--Fear

#### Putin holds all the real power in the government -- threats of being overthrown are few and far between.

//gmemb

By the definition, elites are composed of the top decision-makers in the
political, economic, military spheres. [[While under Russia's
authoritarian regime]{.mark}, [elites]{.mark} might be seen as the
ruling class, their [power and decision-making capacity]{.mark} is
relatively [limited]{.mark}.]{.underline} They are allowed to compete
for various resources but have [to follow a set of evolving formal
and [informal
rules](https://www.cer.eu/sites/default/files/publications/attachments/pdf/2011/e246_unwritten_rules-2203.pdf), and
[recognize]{.mark} the [authority]{.mark} [of]{.mark} Vladimir
[Putin]{.mark}, who is positioned as the [ultimate arbiter and
power-holder]{.mark} in the political system. The scope of their
influence also depends on which elite group they belong to.]{.underline}

Political scientist Peter Rutland of the Wesleyan University identifies
four main elite groups that emerged in Russia in recent decades: Putin's
inner circle, oligarchs, *siloviki*, and state bureaucracy. 

[According](https://minchenko.ru/netcat_files/userfiles/Politbyuro_21_final_15.07.21.pdf) to
Minchenko Consulting, a Moscow-based communication firm that developed a
model of the Russian political elite called "Politburo 2.0" (after the
namesake executive committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet
Union), as of last year, Putin's inner circle included: the ead of
Russia's Security Council Nikolai Patrushev, his deputy and former
Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, head of Rostec Sergei Chemezov, head
of Rosneft Igor Sechin, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin, Defense Minister
Sergei Shoigu, and three businessmen with close personal ties to
Putin---chairman of the Rossiya Bank Yuri Kovalchuk, owner of the
private investment company Volga Group Gennady Timchenko, and Arkady
Rotenberg, co-owner of the Stroygazmontazh, the largest gas pipelines
construction company in Russia.

The group of oligarchs consists of two subgroups: the so-called "old"
oligarchs, who came to wealth and power in the 1990s under the
presidency of Boris Yeltsin, and the "new" oligarchs, who rose to
prominence under Putin. The first group includes Mikhail Fridman, Roman
Abramovich, and Oleg Deripaska, and is, to an extent, more Westernized
compared to its counterpart, having adopted the strategy of "two
pockets"---making money in Russia but parking it in the West. The
leading members of the second group are the aforementioned associates of
Putin---Kovalchuk, Timchenko, Rotenberg, and some
others. [According](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/why-russias-elites-went-war) to
political analyst Kirill Rogov, initially, [Putin's [oligarchs]{.mark}
had [found it difficult to legalize]{.mark} their [capital]{.mark} in
the West [following]{.mark} the [Crimea-related sanction]{.mark}s,
[boosting]{.mark} further their [anti-Western
stance]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} As a result, they have asserted
themselves as a more powerful, influential, and ideologically cohesive
group among the Russian oligarchs.  

The *siloviki* group includes leaders of all key security and military
agencies, such as director of the Federal Security Service (FSB)
Alexander Bortnikov, head of Foreign Intelligence Service Sergei
Naryshkin, the aforementioned Shoigu and Patrushev, as well as director
of the National Guard Viktor Zolotov and president of Chechnya Ramzan
Kadyrov. [Investigative journalists Andrei Soldatov and Irina
Borogan [described](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2018-05-31/putins-secret-services) the
[FSB]{.mark} as [Russia's]{.mark} ["new nobility]{.mark}" and the
country's [true elite]{.mark} in their [2010
book](https://www.publicaffairsbooks.com/titles/andrei-soldatov/the-new-nobility/9781610390552/).
But later, due to the agency's political blunders, [Putin
curtailed]{.mark} its [power]{.mark} and [reduced internal
competition]{.mark}, thus creating a fatal flaw---d[rying out of
critical information flow to political leadership.]{.mark}]{.underline}
The consequences of this decision, as
recently [reported](https://istories.media/opinions/2022/05/16/kak-putin-prinyal-reshenie-o-voine/) by
the investigative project *Important Stories*, are reflected in the poor
quality of FSB intelligence about Ukraine's domestic situation, which
could have been a factor in Putin's underestimating Ukraine's
capabilities.

[State bureaucracy constitutes the fourth elite group, which, to an
extent, has emerged on the basis of the Soviet nomenklatura---the ruling
bureaucracy. Among the key members of the federal level bureaucrats are
head of Presidential Administration Anton Vaino, his deputies Sergei
Kiriyenko and Dmitry Kozak, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, First
Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Beloussov, head of Central Bank Elvira
Nabiullina, and others. The regional bureaucracy includes heads of
regions that have political and economic significance for the federal
center---for example, [leaders of
Tatarstan](https://imrussia.org/en/analysis/3413-how-to-be-a-successful-region-in-russia-the-case-of-tatarstan) or [natives
of St. Petersburg](https://www.rferl.org/a/1075169.html), the
[largest]{.mark} and most [successful regional elite
transplants [led](https://ria.ru/20200219/1564946743.html) by
Putin]{.mark} himself.]{.underline}

#### Putin's regime stays intact not because elites believe in him, but because fear, rigged elections, and no real choices leave them too trapped or paralyzed to act.

Why Russian Elites Have Not Split

Following a few months of Putin's going into a full-blown war with
Ukraine, there have been no signs that Russian elites are ready to split
to challenge the regime. "Today, it seems to many within the power
vertical that Putin bit off more than he could chew, and then wasn't
resolute enough to see it through,"
[writes](https://carnegieendowment.org/eurasiainsight/87341) political
analyst Tatiana Stanovaya. "From the viewpoint of the hawks, Putin looks
weak. This strains any inter-elite solidarity with the president and
makes his support base increasingly fragile," she adds. However,
Stanovaya concludes that the ["[chances of]{.mark} the [coup]{.mark} are
[extremely low]{.mark}, and the [system]{.mark} remains [in]{.mark} the
state of ['political paralysis]{.mark}.'"]{.underline}

Discussing the idea of a coup by the Russian *siloviki*, journalist
Andrei Soldatov
[argues](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2022-04-11/could-siloviki-challenge-putin)
that, despite current tensions within the special service's ranks, the
chances for this scenario are slim. Historical and structural factors
that shaped the country's security and military elites, their lack of
broad based support, and pervasive internal culture of mistrust make a
coup unlikely.

Dmitry Muratov, editor-in-chief of the independent *Novaya Gazeta*
(which was forced to suspend publication over its coverage of the
Ukraine war) and this year's winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, [was
adamant](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYdjOBS2K_8) in a recent
interview that he sees no split within the elites and that the regime
change is impossible right now. Another veteran journalist Alexei
Venedictov, former editor-in-chief of *Ekho Moskvy* (which was shut down
for its reporting of the war, while Venedictov himself was declared a
"foreign agent"), concurred. Moreover, he
[reported](https://udf.name/news/main_news/240824-venediktov-istoricheskoe-prozrenie-nastupaet-potom-ne-srazu-a-sejchas-okruzhenie-putina-v-jejforii-raskola-tam-net.html)
that many top officials from Putin's inner circle, whom he knows
privately, were "euphoric" about the war ("we are so cool!"), and now
have grown more businesslike and determined to work hard for the sake of
their heavily-sanctioned country.

Moscow municipal deputy Elena Kotyonochkina called Russia fascist at a
work meeting and was consequently charged with discrediting the army
using an official position. She fled the country, while her colleague
Alexei Gorinov, decided to stay, and has been recently
[sentenced](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/07/russia-municipal-councillor-sentenced-to-seven-years-in-jail-for-opposing-the-ukraine-war/)
to seven years in prison. Kotyonochkina
[lamented,](https://republic.ru/posts/104170) "I had illusions at first
that the war would soon end and there would be no Putin. Split of the
elite and all that [... \[Now\] I think that [even if]{.mark} the
[Hague]{.mark} \[International Court of Justice\] [accuses Putin
personally of war crimes]{.mark}, this would [unlikely]{.mark}
[cause]{.mark} the [elites to split]{.mark}."]{.underline} She added
that this could happen only after Putin's resignation or death.

So why, despite clear signs of discontent with Putin's war against
Ukraine, do the Russian elites appear to stand united and refuse to
challenge the president, his system, or at least protest the war? One
obvious answer is that the Kremlin moved extremely fast to
[criminalize](https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/03/07/russia-criminalizes-independent-war-reporting-anti-war-protests)
the administrative offense of "discrediting Russian armed forces," with
a punishment of up to 15 years in prison. At least 70 people are
currently [being
prosecuted](https://graniru.org/Politics/Russia/Politzeki/m.285499.html)
for this offense.

But beyond this immediate factor, there are political and psychological
reasons for the conformity of those members of the Russian elites who
are not satisfied with the situation or unsure what to think about it.

First, [[Putin's Russia]{.mark} is a [highly centralized]{.mark} regime
where all [branches of power]{.mark} are essentially [subordinated
to]{.mark} the [president]{.mark}. [Elections]{.mark} are constantly
[rigged]{.mark} to prevent genuine political opposition to access the
political system[; media and civil society]{.mark} are [subjugated to
the state]{.mark}; [grassroots]{.mark} movements are [suppressed]{.mark}
or
[hijacked](https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2016/05/06/how-russian-authorities-hijacked-a-wwii-remembrance-movement-a52776);
and [public opinion]{.mark} is [manipulated]{.mark} [by]{.mark}
relentless and powerful **[propaganda]{.mark}**. Within this regime,
[people have few legitimate outlets to voice views]{.mark} that are
[different from]{.mark} the ["party line."]{.mark}]{.underline}

Second, until the Crimea-related sanctions, the benefits of supporting
the regime outweighed opposition and dissent. Since his third term in
the office, Putin has increasingly relied on
[repression](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2021-04-01/vladimir-putin-russias-weak-strongman)
to thwart dissent---a tendency that [has
reached](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/03/russia-kremlins-ruthless-crackdown-stifles-independent-journalism-and-anti-war-movement/)
even higher levels after the Ukraine war[. The [regime]{.mark} has been
[employing targeted repression]{.mark} that was effectively used not
only [against]{.mark} [non-elite political actors]{.mark}, such as
[Alexei Navalny](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60832310),
[or]{.mark} [average citizens]{.mark}, such as the defendants in the
[Bolotnaya
case](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/press-release/2014/02/russia-guilty-verdict-bolotnaya-case-injustice-its-most-obvious/)
or the [Moscow case](https://carnegiemoscow.org/commentary/80578), but
also against the elites.
[[Purges](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/00104140211047399)
of the elite ranks]{.mark} have become
[[routine]{.mark}](https://www.economist.com/europe/2019/03/28/russias-new-purges-rattle-the-elite),
and [jailing of such high profile figures]{.mark} as businessman
[Mikhail
Khodorkovsky](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/takeaway/segments/mikhail-khodorkovsky-case-defines-russian-justice),
former CEO of the Yukos oil company and once the richest man in Russia,
or Minister of Economic Development [Alexei
Ulyukaev](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/dec/15/russia-jails-former-economy-minister-alexei-ulyukayev-for-corruption),
has [sent clear signals that no one is untouchable.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Third, some of the distinct features of Putin's political leadership are
his secrecy and unpredictability, which collide with people's basic
psychological needs for certainty and security. [[His leadership
style]{.mark} taken against the backdrop of the vast repressive
apparatus and pervasive presence of the special services in public life
[generates constant fear]{.mark}.]{.underline} This was amply
demonstrated by the anxiety exuded by the members of Russia's Security
Council during a fateful February 21, 2022
[meeting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9A-u8EoWcI) where they were
forced to publicly agree with Putin's decision to recognize two
pro-Russian separatists territories in Ukraine (the self-proclaimed
Donetsk and Luhansk People's republics) as independent---a move that
precluded a full-scale invasion as well as implicated participants in
war crimes. Similarly, as
[reported](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/04/29/russia-oligarchs-ukraine-invasion-dissent/)
by the *Washington Post*, when 37 of Russia's wealthiest business
executives were called to the Kremlin for the meeting with Putin, [["no
one dared issue a whimper of protest."]{.mark}]{.underline}

In critical situations, three [typical
responses](http://web.mnstate.edu/robertsb/306/ANTH%20306/2004_C.N.S_Five_Fs_of_FEAR--Freeze_Flight_Fight_Fright_Faint.pdf)
to fear are fight, flight, or freeze. Given Russia's current political
realities, [[fighting comes at]{.mark} a premium
[cost]{.mark}---**[freedom or]{.mark} even [life]{.mark}**.
[Fleeing]{.mark} can be [costly]{.mark} too, especially [under]{.mark}
the [sanctions regime]{.mark}. The [remaining option is]{.mark} to
"[freeze]{.mark}"---to do nothing, go into paralysis, [which is]{.mark}
likely [what happened to many elite]{.mark} member[s]{.mark} as the
shockwaves of the war swept over the country.]{.underline} Still,
according to the
[analysis](https://www.ng.ru/ideas/2022-03-05/100_2203051550.html) by
the Strategic Communications Agency, a St.-Petersburg firm, the Kremlin
might have sensed a hidden risk in this paralysis and actively engaged
in damage control. Several techniques to address elites' confusion and
anxiety were reportedly employed: use of the wartime rhetoric to
mobilize elites and coordinate their resistance to the sanctions
pressure; pushing of the inter-elite conflicts further under the carpet;
offering economic support for their efforts in import substitution
(e.g., through nationalizing foreign assets of the companies that left
Russia); and threatening those who refuse to conform with ostracism and
isolation. These efforts may have worked for now, helping to mobilize
elites in the face of Russia's economic collapse, but they are unlikely
to help with their grudges and anger over incurred and future losses.

The Putin regime approaches its next challenge---the 2024 presidential
election and its [power transition
problem](https://newtimes.ru/articles/detail/215075/)---in an
increasingly hostile external and internal environment. More repressions
and purges of the elites are likely. It remains to be seen if the
accumulating damages could force the elite groups to defect or challenge
the Putin regime. As of now, it seems unlikely.

### No Collapse\-\--Propaganda

#### Putin maintains strong popular support by portraying himself as a stable, masculine leader who creates external enemies to unite Russians and promises to restore Russia's former global power.

// gmemb

A portion of the popular support that Putin enjoys is propped up by the
suppression and coercion of the Russian people. Nevertheless, [a great
deal of the population- around [60 percent of people]{.mark}- have
[genuine loyalty]{.mark} to the president. This [base]{.mark} has
remained **[constant]{.mark}** throughout the ebb and flow of Putin's
popularity, meaning that [they support Putin for reasons beyond a
superficial national fervor]{.mark}.]{.underline} The consistency of
such support despite Russia's stagnation ultimately stems from Putin's
persona as a "stable strongman," his ability to create outgroups, and
his revanchist ideals.

[[Putin]{.mark} has been able to [maintain power through]{.mark} his
[perception]{.mark} as a ["stable strongman."]{.mark}]{.underline} The
second part of this self-proclaimed moniker is common amongst leaders of
authoritarian regimes, and Putin is no different. Putin has built this
"tough-guy" character in several ways over the past couple of decades,
especially through the use of gender politics. As previously mentioned,
[[Putin]{.mark} has [utilized]{.mark} the **[media]{.mark}** to paint
himself [as]{.mark} a macho superhero of sorts- an übermensch who is
[capable of solving all of Russia's]{.mark}
[problems]{.mark}.]{.underline} Unfortunately, this characterization
comes at the expense of marginalized groups. Women have been a common
target for Putin in order to preserve his strongman persona, with Putin
remarking that "maybe weakness is not the worst quality for a woman,"
and calling a disgraced Israeli president who raped ten women a "mighty
man."16 This rhetoric, although abhorrent, reinforces Putin's image as
an ultra-masculine hero.

However, populations are not usually content with their leader just
being a strongmanthey also must confer a sense of stability. Putin
succeeds in this category as well. Though the bar for stability is low
for Russians considering the economic volatility of the 1990s, Russia
enjoyed a period of stark economic growth throughout the early 2000s
that coincided with his first two terms in office.17 Though Russia's
economy is now suffering due to international sanctions, Russians
associate this earlier period of economic prosperity with Putin himself
and are fearful about what may happen if he is deposed, lest the crises
of the 1990s suddenly return. Moreover, Putin's character has a
heightened perception of stability when compared to previous Russian
figureheads. For Russian citizens who experienced the collapse of the
Soviet Union and the turmoil thereafter, Putin's rule is inherently more
stable than the tenure of the reforming Mikhail Gorbachev or the erratic
and frail Boris Yeltsin.

18 Furthermore, [[Putin]{.mark} has been able to [cultivate organic
popular support through]{.mark} his [ability to create
"others."]{.mark}]{.underline} To preface, nationalism is a complex
concept within Russia that has no true widespread consensus. In fact, as
Gerber writes in his analysis of Russian nationalism, "the nationalist
and xenophobic attitudes purported to be beneath the recent surge in
Putin\'s popularity are far from universally held, and they correlate
inconsistently with attitudes on political issues."19 Despite this
truth, Russians, like any group, can still be susceptible to rhetoric
that alienates other factions.

Consequently, Putin has seized on this opportunity multiple times during
his presidency to maintain public support. During the onset of the
Second Russo-Chechen War, Putin framed the Chechens as "terrorists," and
the subsequent Russian invasion as a justifiable endeavor. 20 Likewise,
as his casus belli for invading Ukraine in 2022, Putin "othered"
pro-Western elites within the Ukrainian state by painting them as a
"Nazi junta" that was abusing ethnic Russians who lived in the eastern
part of the nation.21 Putin has progressively portrayed the West at
large as an enemy by equating Western liberalism with the degradation of
traditional values, especially playing on the poor public opinion of
LGBTQ+ groups by staging Western countries as overrun by homosexuals and
without moral decency. 22 Regardless of the target group, Putin's
efforts at "othering" shifts the attention from his own shortcomings and
creates a narrative where he can be the popular champion who defeats the
supposed evil.

Finally, [Putin has been able to keep popular support through his
[promises]{.mark} to [return Russia to its former
glory]{.mark}.]{.underline} Russians, disgruntled by their nation's loss
of influence since the collapse of the Soviet Union, have increasingly
pushed to see Russia reenter great power status on the international
stage. This is evident through public surveys, where a majority of
respondents expected that presidential candidates should "make Russia a
great, respected power again."23 Putin recognizes and has capitalized
upon this sentiment. In 2005, during his annual State of the Nation
address, [Putin [called]{.mark} the [collapse of the Soviet
Union]{.mark} the "[greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the
century]{.mark}.]{.underline}" Of course, Putin uses more than rhetoric
to draw support from this shared belief. [His [annexation of
Crimea]{.mark} in 2014 [and]{.mark} [invasion of Ukraine]{.mark} in 2022
were both [examples of Putin]{.mark} attempting to [restore]{.mark} the
**[might]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the **[Soviet Union]{.mark}** by
reincorporating Russia's Slavic brother. Embarking on a crusade to
return Russia to its prior standing in the world has helped
**[distract]{.mark}** the [Russian public from domestic issues]{.mark}
and provided [Putin]{.mark} with the **high levels of [public
approval]{.mark}** needed to continue his reign.]{.underline}

#### Putin holds Russia's fractured elites together through fear, corruption, and a need to survive in his system -- they wont overthrow him out of fear of what would happen if they fail.

What Holds Them Together

Elites are normally held together by [consensus or
ideology](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1057/978-1-137-51904-7).
[[Putin's early efforts to consolidate Russia's elites]{.mark}, which
had been feuding fiercely in the 1990s, [have been
[successful]{.mark}](http://socinst.ru/wp-content/uploads/base/journals/text/powerandelites/powerelites_2020_7-1-5-21.pdf) in
terms of [establishing]{.mark} a [consensus]{.mark} regarding the rules
of the game under his regime (e.g., [Putin]{.mark} as the
[ultimate]{.mark} [political arbiter]{.mark}), but it never translated
into true unity of common values and beliefs.]{.underline} [[Russian
elite groups]{.mark} are still engaged in overt and covert conflicts,
enjoy limited power and authority, disagree over political symbols and
historical figures---and [are a long way from
cohesion]{.mark}]{.underline}. Still, due to Putin's consolidation of
media control, the visibility of elite discord [has greatly
reduced](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10199682). 

Over the course of his 22 years in power, Putin himself
has [undergone](https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/52536839/Laruelle-Carnegie-Russian_ideological_market-with-cover-page-v2.pdf?Expires=1657901049&Signature=Cez~RKeeP3ij36VdnlyUxFhsS9ShX2mX3NmwQrvu2anHy~lnXYodYCZKy2GvIgpwBUpleDjtr86fh3gMiWBkPF2~Bn5Su6q8P3bE2iFbE7AuDxY74Ws4a20TFu8KlSILwTVkwlXxZSUAAxKpGIrYdRlQsp4ATrVw7a3p5eV1PAP~bPcdDWaF0-UC78gRhJ9-6jwWWUL-6ILSuynt-8H9pLl9HBkkxpioanjrSQl83XYvXzjuJL48~7oxnaiwI-LZ5TLK27HwyxPgtrWVvHfyEGljLXhqG-mjAp6rIZX4ObHMQP192Xhr7DJkdHmrBuKOojk0c1uilF5sq95tWxlXzw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA) a

he [denied](https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/52536839/Laruelle-Carnegie-Russian_ideological_market-with-cover-page-v2.pdf?Expires=1657901049&Signature=Cez~RKeeP3ij36VdnlyUxFhsS9ShX2mX3NmwQrvu2anHy~lnXYodYCZKy2GvIgpwBUpleDjtr86fh3gMiWBkPF2~Bn5Su6q8P3bE2iFbE7AuDxY74Ws4a20TFu8KlSILwTVkwlXxZSUAAxKpGIrYdRlQsp4ATrVw7a3p5eV1PAP~bPcdDWaF0-UC78gRhJ9-6jwWWUL-6ILSuynt-8H9pLl9HBkkxpioanjrSQl83XYvXzjuJL48~7oxnaiwI-LZ5TLK27HwyxPgtrWVvHfyEGljLXhqG-mjAp6rIZX4ObHMQP192Xhr7DJkdHmrBuKOojk0c1uilF5sq95tWxlXzw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA) the
need for state ideology. Later, he embraced conservatism and then a
bizarre mix of ideas borrowed from
ethnonationalism, [Eurasianism](https://www.dw.com/en/the-cocktail-of-ideologies-behind-vladimir-putin/a-61242466),
and [totalitarianism](https://www.nlobooks.ru/books/liberal_ru/24139/).
Prominent Russian political commentator Vladimir
Pastukhov [described](https://novayagazeta.ru/articles/2022/03/23/vladimir-pastukhov-operatsiia-russkaia-khromosoma) Putin's
current creed as based on the ideas of Orthodox fundamentalism,
Slavophilism, and Stalinism. These ideas tap into deeply seated elements
of Russian political, social, and cultural history, and have been
unearthed by the Russian president as part of his search for the
country's "[spiritual
bonds](https://eng.globalaffairs.ru/articles/spiritual-bonds-as-state-ideology/)." 

[Following Putin's [2007 Munich
speech](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/transcripts/copy/24034)---in
which he laid out his grievances with U.S. foreign
policy---[anti-Western narratives]{.mark} have become [increasingly
popular among the Russian elites, spurred by state-controlled
propaganda]{.mark}.]{.underline} A particular
emotion [driving](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10199682) the
anti-American attitudes
is [*ressentiment*](https://online.ucpress.edu/cpcs/article-abstract/47/3-4/291/508/Obsession-with-status-and-ressentiment-Historical?redirectedFrom=PDF),
rooted in Russia's loss of status on the international arena after the
Soviet Union's dissolution and subsequent failure to transition to a
Western democratic model. Putin's resentment over what
he [saw](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4480745.stm) as the "greatest
geopolitical catastrophe of the 20th^ ^century" and the subsequent NATO
expansion eastward, which
he [perceives](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/jan/12/russias-belief-in-nato-betrayal-and-why-it-matters-today) as
a "betrayal," fuels his acute desire for recognition and has become his
"obsession," as veteran U.S. diplomat Henri Kissinger recently [pointed
out](https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/interview-with-henry-kissinger-for-war-in-ukraine-there-is-no-good-historical-example-a-64b77d41-5b60-497e-8d2f-9041a73b1892).
[The [ressentiment]{.mark} is an [emotional bond that the Russian elites
share with the public]{.mark}. It was at full display [following]{.mark}
the 2014 [annexation of Crimea]{.mark}, which [created]{.mark} an
unprecedented [[consensus
effect](https://carnegieendowment.org/files/CP_Volkov_WEB_Eng.pdf) in
Russia allowing Putin to withstand Western sanctions]{.mark} and
successfully [manipulate public opinion]{.mark} to [present]{.mark} the
[country as a victim of Western hostility]{.mark}. ]{.underline}

The concocted ideological mix, while not presenting a coherent set of
beliefs and values, nevertheless offers opportunities for various elite
factions to link their ideological preferences to the specific ideas of
the mix and thus be able to demonstrate loyalty. Yet, despite this
public conformity, [[very few
ideas](https://par.nsf.gov/servlets/purl/10199692) truly unite Russian
elites. ]{.underline}

of a new, more powerful ["axis of evil."]{.mark}]{.underline} The "axis
of evil" was a term initially coined by President George W. Bush during
his 2002 State of the Union address. Then, Bush was speaking to a nation
-- and a world -- looking for moral leadership after the horrific
terrorist attacks on September 11. The axis members of Iran, Iraq, and
North Korea were the perceived bad state actors responsible for
collectively organizing attacks meant to "threaten the peace of the
world."

Hostile states have only expanded the use of terrorist proxies to
advance their end game. Those actors continue to coordinate behind
closed doors to expand their knowledge, resources, and capabilities, and
pose a greater threat as a result. Trump does not seem to appreciate, or
understand, these invaluable lessons from history.

[killed](https://www.foxnews.com/world/more-than-20-ukrainians-killed-russian-ballistics-palm-sunday-strike)
by Russian bombs on Palm Sunday.

As the talks begin, the international community, which will play an
integral role in brokering and potentially guaranteeing any agreement,
must have a clear understanding of who Putin truly is. [[Any peace
deal]{.mark} must [protect]{.mark} the core [rights of]{.mark} the
[Ukrainian]{.mark} people, [including]{.mark} and especially freedom of
[religion]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Unfortunately, there has been a concerted effort among a handful of
influential
[voices](https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-marjorie-taylor-greene-race-and-ethnicity-europe-mitch-mcconnell-6dd6985db085537fcb103c0d022ac775)
on the political right, including self-described Christians, that aims
to rehabilitate the image of Vladimir Putin as a pro-family,
conservative Christian.

At a Conservative Political Action Conference event, one speaker
[said](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/marjorie-taylor-greene-cpac-nick-fuentes-afpac-white-nationalist/),
"Russia is a Christian nationalist nation ... I identify more with
Putin's Christian values than I do with Joe Biden's." Days later, at the
America First Political Action Conference, Nick Fuentes, who had
previously tweeted that he wished "Putin was president of America,"
called for a round of applause for Putin with the crowd spontaneously
chanting "Putin!, Putin!"

[[Putin\'s]{.mark} [comments]{.mark} in interviews with Western
journalists]{.underline} may [[lead some to believe he is a Christian
leader]{.mark},]{.underline} but judging him by his actions, [he is
[nothing more]{.mark} [than]{.mark} a **[dictator]{.mark}** [committed
to **destroying**]{.mark} [anything]{.mark} in his path [to **recreate**
the **Russian empire**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

As history shows, there is typically one group of people that can break
the yoke of dictatorships --- people of faith. Knowing this, people of
faith --- Evangelicals, Catholics, Jews --- have been in his crosshairs.
Only the Russian Orthodox Church, which the Kremlin
[controls](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-orthodox-church-declares-%E2%80%9Choly-war%E2%80%9D-against-ukraine-and-articulates-tenets)
and supports Russia's brutal war, has been spared.

[Because of Putin, publicly preaching the Gospel is
[illegal](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2016/07/no-evangelizing-outside-of-church-russia-proposes/)
across Russia and occupied Ukraine. Because of Putin, the Catholic
church has been
[liquidated](https://www.ncronline.org/news/not-single-catholic-priest-left-russian-occupied-ukraine-reveals-major-archbishop)
in the occupied territories of Ukraine. Because of Putin, Jews [have
been](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/putin-faces-antisemitism-accusations-following-attack-on-ethnic-jews/)
scapegoated for "tearing apart" Russian churches.]{.underline} Those who
find themselves in lands controlled by Russia are certainly suffering,
but few have suffered more than Protestant and Catholic Christians. The
brutality is real and well-documented.

In the documentary "*[A Faith Under Siege: Russia's Hidden War on
Ukraine's Christians](http://www.faithundersiege.com/),"* viewers can
hear the story of Viktor, a Ukrainian Evangelical who was kept in a
basement for 25 days by Russian forces. He was beaten with fists, feet,
and baseball bats, and repeatedly shocked with a taser. During his
imprisonment, a Russian Orthodox Priest tried to "cast demons" from him
simply because he was a Protestant Christian. We've documented Viktor's
story [here](https://www.faithundersiege.com/torture).

[[During Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine]{.mark} that began in
2022, Russia [destroyed, shelled, or looted
[650](https://missioneurasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Mission-Eurasia-report-on-Ukraine-ENG.pdf)

[47](https://missioneurasia.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/2025-Mission-Eurasia-report-on-Ukraine-ENG.pdf)
priests and pastors.]{.mark}]{.underline} Late in 2023, Putin presided
over the plenary session of the "World Russian People's Congress," which
later proclaimed through Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill that the
invasion of Ukraine was a "[holy
war](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/russian-orthodox-church-declares-holy-war-against-ukraine-and-west/)"
not only on Ukraine but also on the collective West.

[[Putin]{.mark} has also [created an environment hostile to faith within
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 2016, preaching the Gospel was outlawed
in Russia under the "Yarovaya laws," which
[ban](https://missioneurasia.org/yarovaya-law-vs-religious-freedom/)
missionary activity outside of state-approved churches and religious
sites, including online or in one's own home, without a government
permit. Most of the
[prosecutions](https://www.christianitytoday.com/2019/05/russian-evangelicals-anti-missionary-fined-yarovaya-law/)
based on these laws impact Evangelical Christians. By 2021, the U.S.
State Department added Russia to the "[Worst
Violators](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-religious-freedom-washington-report/31566582.html)"
of religious freedom list, alongside North Korea and Iran. Currently,
only China has more people [jailed for their
faith](https://novayagazeta.eu/articles/2025/03/28/russia-second-only-to-china-in-number-of-people-imprisoned-for-religious-beliefs-en-news)
than Russia. With faith largely outlawed, the country seems to have
turned to the occult instead. Sixty percent of Russians have visited an
esoteric specialist in their life, like sorcerers and fortune tellers,
and Russia's annual spending on "[occult
services](https://www.rt.com/business/609951-russian-occult-services-spending/)"
exceeds \$24B USD, more than the country's annual spending on groceries.

[[Putin]{.mark} has [single-handedly subjugated]{.mark}
[millions]{.mark} of Ukrainians and Russians. As the Trump
administration and the international community continue their laudable
efforts to bring a just and enduring end to Russia's war in Ukraine,
they must remain clear-eyed on who is waging this war and focus on
Putin's actions, not his words. [Putin is not a defender of family
values. Putin does not seek peace.]{.mark} There are voices trying to
clean his reputation and ignore his atrocities, but the truth is clear:
Putin is many things, but a man of faith, he is not.]{.underline}

### Collapse Good\-\--Climate

#### Putin's war in Ukraine has triggered global shortages in oil, fertilizer, and wheat, fueling deforestation, land grabs, and environmental rollbacks that threaten Indigenous territories, biodiversity, and the planet's ability to fight climate change.

**Friedman 22 (**Thomas L. Friedman became the paper's foreign affairs
Opinion columnist in 1995. He joined the paper in 1981, after which he

2022, "Putin's War Is a Crime Against the Planet,"
<https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/27/opinion/ukraine-war-environment.html>)
// gmemb

These forests and their Indigenous people were already under pressure
from global economic forces, but [Putin's war set off a cascade of
negative effects: [Russia]{.mark} is one of the [largest fertilizer
producers in the world]{.mark}. The [[largest oil exporter to global
markets]{.mark}](https://www.crisisgroup.org/global/sb007-7-priorities-g7-managing-global-fallout-russias-war-ukraine).
And more than a quarter of the [world's
[wheat]{.mark}](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/24/business/ukraine-russia-wheat-prices.html) is
normally [exported]{.mark} [by Russia and Ukraine]{.mark}, providing
bread for billions of people, as well as barley, sunflower seed oil and
corn. Because of both the war and sanctions on Russia, [shortages and
prices on these commodities]{.mark} have [spiked]{.mark}, increasing
pressures all over the planet to strip more intact forest to drill for
oil, plant crops for agribusinesses and create land for cattle
grazing.]{.underline}

Last week [Nia Tero,](https://www.niatero.org/) a global nonprofit that
supports the Indigenous peoples who are guardians of these endangered
forests, invited me to moderate a public discussion by Indigenous
leaders visiting New York City for Climate Week. Nia Tero points to
statistics showing that Indigenous
territories [encompass](https://esajournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fee.2148) over
a third of Earth's intact forests and [similar
portions](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-018-0100-6) of other
vital ecosystems, safeguarding a significant share of the world's
biodiversity. Carbon stored in Indigenous forests in the Amazon, for
instance, is [far less
likely](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1913321117) to be lost to
the atmosphere than that on private and other unprotected lands.

Unfortunately, the more we destroy these forests, peat lands and
mangroves, it also becomes far less likely that we will get anywhere
near the goal of the Paris climate agreement of limiting global warming
to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.

Nemonte Nenquimo won the [Goldman Environmental
Prize](https://www.goldmanprize.org/recipient/nemonte-nenquimo/#:~:text=Meet%20Nemonte%20Nenquimo&text=Espa%C3%B1ol-,Nemonte%20Nenquimo%20led%20an%20indigenous%20campaign%20and%20legal%20action%20that,Waorani%20territory%20from%20oil%20extraction.) in
2020 for leading a legal fight on behalf of Indigenous communities in
Ecuador --- one of the 10 most biodiverse countries on Earth --- "that
resulted in a court ruling protecting 500,000 acres of Amazonian
rainforest and Waorani territory from oil extraction,"
the [citation](https://www.goldmanprize.org/recipient/nemonte-nenquimo/) said.
"Nenquimo's leadership and the lawsuit set a legal precedent for
Indigenous rights in Ecuador, and other tribes are following in her
footsteps to protect additional tracts of rainforest from oil
extraction."

A great honor. But she told me last week that despite her legal victory,
[[soaring oil prices]{.mark} emanating from the Ukraine war have
[put]{.mark} [renewed pressure on]{.mark} her [Indigenous]{.mark}
community's [forests]{.mark}.]{.underline} As she put it, ["The oil is
in the forest, and they think our home is the solution."]{.underline}

As John Reid, the senior economist for Nia Tero, explained[, "[Supply
shocks]{.mark} from Ukraine and Russia [become]{.mark} demand shocks
[across]{.mark} the **[world]{.mark}**, [including]{.mark} in the
[intact forests,]{.mark} because the intact forests are all [big
potential suppliers of agricultural commodities, gold, oil, gas and
wood]{.mark}."]{.underline} (Reid and Thomas E. Lovejoy wrote "[Ever
Green: Saving Big Forests to Save the
Planet,](https://evergreenforestbook.com/)" an outstanding primer on the
vital role intact forests play in sustaining the biosphere.)

Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim is a leader of the Mbororo pastoralist people in
Chad. It is bad enough, she told me, that Lake Chad has lost about 90
percent of its water and many of its species, but now people in her
community are asking her: "Why has the price of flour and fuel gone up
so high? Russia and Ukraine are very far away, so why are we hurt?" They
don't understand how the shocks of a war in Ukraine can radiate far
enough to hit even landlocked, sub-Saharan Chad.

["[When]{.mark} the [war started]{.mark},"]{.underline} added Ibrahim,
"[the [African countries]{.mark} were [asked to choose a side.]{.mark}
And [all]{.mark} we were [thinking]{.mark} [is]{.mark} that we
[need]{.mark} [food]{.mark}.]{.underline} This war has become a big
problem for all of us." Everywhere she turns now, she added, Chinese
companies are looking for land for industrial agriculture, which is a
huge problem for her pastoralist people.

["For [Indigenous peoples]{.mark}, the [land is
**everything**]{.mark},"]{.underline} Ibrahim wrote in [an
essay](https://mg.co.za/opinion/2022-09-22-role-of-indigenous-people-as-stewards-of-nature-under-threat/) last
week in The Mail & Guardian, which is based in South Africa. "It is the
source of our food, shelter and medicine, as well as the wellspring of
our culture and history. Over countless generations, we have learned to
live well on our land. We know how to protect it, how to restore it and
how to serve as its engineers and nurturers rather than its destroyers."

Unfortunately, some greedy leaders, like President Jair Bolsonaro of
Brazil, resent the fact that Indigenous peoples control precious
resources --- in the case of Brazil, over 13 percent of its territory,
much of it intact forest. Brazil bought \$3.5 billion worth of
fertilizer from Russia last year, a flow now constricted by Western
sanctions. So as soon as the war started creating fertilizer shortages,
Bolsonaro blurted out: "This crisis is a good opportunity for us," [The
Washington
Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/03/19/brazil-bolsonaro-mining-amazon-russia-ukraine/) reported.
"Where there's Indigenous land, there are riches beneath it."

He then moved to [pass
legislation](https://www.dw.com/en/brazil-bolsonaro-uses-ukraine-war-to-support-extraction-on-indigenous-land/a-60990812) that
would enable companies to mine potassium from Indigenous people's
forests so Brazil can make more of its own fertilizer.

[Then there is [Ukraine]{.mark} itself. Before the war, it [had]{.mark}
significant [ancient forests]{.mark}, "which have been [left]{.mark}
**[untouched]{.mark}** [by human
impact]{.mark},]{.underline}" [according to the World Wide Fund for
Nature](https://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/?358973/Ukraine-OGF-Natural-Monuments).
Since the invasion, [[Russian]{.mark} [military]{.mark} activity has
[damaged]{.mark} "[900 protected natural areas,"]{.mark}]{.underline}
according to an
O.E.C.D. [report](https://www.oecd.org/ukraine-hub/policy-responses/environmental-impacts-of-the-war-in-ukraine-and-prospects-for-a-green-reconstruction-9e86d691/) issued
in July, ["[and]{.mark} an estimated 1.2 million hectares, or about [30
percent of all protected areas of Ukraine]{.mark}."]{.underline}

On top of that, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine accounted for a quarter of
the worldwide timber trade last year. Because of the war and sanctions
on Russia, other timber-producing and -exporting nations are doubling
down to make up the shortfall by loosening environmental protections,
The Financial
Times [reported](https://www.ft.com/content/d6388b32-757b-4484-95ff-720b4b2319f3):
"[Soon after February's invasion, Kyiv lifted a regulation that
prohibits logging in protected forests during spring and early
summer"]{.underline} to help raise money for the war. ["Environmental
groups fear the decision could lead to large-scale losses in areas where
illegal logging and forest mismanagement are already rife."]{.underline}

Over the past half century, noted Reid, "countries have taken big
collaborative leaps in protecting the environment and its stewards ---
whether it is the Clean Air Act of 1970 in America or Brazil's 1988
Constitution recognizing the rights of its Indigenous peoples to control
the lands they have protected for millenniums. Protected land has more
than doubled worldwide since 1990." And now, out of nowhere, one man
launches a murderous war in the heart of the world's breadbasket, and
suddenly all the progress on norms and laws risks going up in smoke,
right along with the forests.

Which is why [[Putin's war is not just a crime against **Ukraine** and
**humanity**]{.mark}. [It's]{.mark} also a crime [against]{.mark} the
home we all share: **planet [Earth]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Geopolitical and Strategic Implications of the Iran-Russia Partnership

Economic Resilience and Sanctions Evasion

The necessity to mitigate the economic effects of Western sanctions is
the main driver behind the Iran-Russia strategic partnership. [[To
enable long-term economic collaboration]{.mark}, both [countries]{.mark}
aim to [create]{.mark} [alternative banking systems]{.mark}, such as the
MIR, that circumvent institutions under Western authority.]{.underline}
To maintain economic resilience, this entails increasing bilateral trade
in energy-related sectors, including nuclear power, gas, and oil as well
as barter trade and non-dollar transactions. [[Iran and Russia want to
strengthen]{.mark} their [economies against **external** economic
pressures by **reducing**]{.mark} their **[reliance]{.mark}**
[on]{.mark} [Western markets and financial
networks]{.mark}.]{.underline}[[\[12\]]{.underline}](https://trendsresearch.org/insight/the-russia-iran-strategic-partnership-pact-energy-geopolitics-and-shifting-global-alliances/#_ftn12)

Military Influence

The collaboration includes important geopolitical and military facets in
addition to economic cooperation, especially in the Middle East,
Transcaucasia, and Central Asia[. [Both countries hope to fight
Western-aligned forces]{.underline}]{.mark} [in these areas [by]{.mark}
[increasing]{.mark} their [diplomatic and security clout]{.mark}. This
strengthens their security collaboration and involves possible arms
exchange, intelligence sharing, and combined military training. Their
[cooperation]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the [high-tech and
cyber]{.mark}security sectors also [improves technological
self-sufficiency and fortifies national defense
capabilities]{.mark}.]{.underline}[\[13\]](https://trendsresearch.org/insight/the-russia-iran-strategic-partnership-pact-energy-geopolitics-and-shifting-global-alliances/#_ftn13)

Strategic Depth and Power Realignment

The Iran-Russia alliance, which is based on common political and
security goals and [specifically [challenges American power in the
Middle East and Central Asia, differs]{.mark} from [conventional energy
alliances that are motivated by market efficiency]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Their collaboration goes beyond energy markets to include the creation
of alternate commerce and financial avenues as well as military
coordination in war-ridden zones like Syria. By changing the balance of
power in the region, this strategic alignment positions their union as a
geopolitical tool as well as an economic
necessity.[\[14\]](https://trendsresearch.org/insight/the-russia-iran-strategic-partnership-pact-energy-geopolitics-and-shifting-global-alliances/#_ftn14)

Diversification of Energy Routes

[[Regional trade routes]{.mark} and energy flows are [expected to change
because]{.mark} of [Russia]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [Iran's]{.mark}
[cooperation]{.mark} on projects like the International North-South
Transport Corridor and new gas pipelines]{.underline}. These programs
strive to diversify energy transit routes, which have historically been
concentrated in a small number of vital pipelines, increasing countries'
susceptibility to geopolitical risks and disruptions. They also aim to
[[improve **bilateral**]{.mark} [energy
exchanges]{.mark}.]{.underline}[\[15\]](https://trendsresearch.org/insight/the-russia-iran-strategic-partnership-pact-energy-geopolitics-and-shifting-global-alliances/#_ftn15)
This collaboration reduces dependency on current transit routes that are
vulnerable to political unrest or sanctions by creating alternate routes
via Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan. By lowering chokepoints, fostering new
energy trade opportunities, and bolstering the stability of energy
supplies throughout the region---including Europe and Asia---such
diversification is essential for regional energy
security.[\[16\]](https://trendsresearch.org/insight/the-russia-iran-strategic-partnership-pact-energy-geopolitics-and-shifting-global-alliances/#_ftn16)

Trade Routes

[To improve connectivity throughout Eurasia, Russia, Iran, and other
regional allies are making significant investments in new trade
routes.]{.underline} The International North-South Transport Corridor
(INSTC), a cooperative project aimed at connecting Russian and Iranian
ports and [cutting transit times by as much as 40%, particularly between
Moscow and Mumbai, is a major undertaking in this
endeavor.]{.underline}[[\[17\]]{.underline}](https://trendsresearch.org/insight/the-russia-iran-strategic-partnership-pact-energy-geopolitics-and-shifting-global-alliances/#_ftn17)
Furthermore, a railway project is being built to provide [[direct access
to international markets via the Indian Ocean]{.underline}]{.mark} by
connecting St. Petersburg with Bandar Abbas, Iran's southern port.
Connecting Russia to nations in the Caspian basin, the Arabian Gulf, and
Central, South, and Southeast Asia is made possible by the larger INSTC.
It is anticipated that these initiatives will [[improve]{.mark}
**[economic]{.mark}** [integration]{.mark} and [boost]{.mark}
**[regional]{.mark}**
[trade]{.mark}.]{.underline}[[\[18\]]{.underline}](https://trendsresearch.org/insight/the-russia-iran-strategic-partnership-pact-energy-geopolitics-and-shifting-global-alliances/#_ftn18)

### Collapse Good\-\--Ukraine

#### Russia's upcoming offensive threatens to trigger one of the worst humanitarian crises of the war, with mass civilian displacement, overwhelmed aid systems, and deepening instability across Ukraine.

**Liakh and Haring 25 (**Viktor Liakh is president of the East Europe
Foundation. Melinda Haring is a nonresident senior fellow at the
Atlantic Council's Eurasia Center and a senior advisor at Razom for
Ukraine. 27 May 2025, "Russia's summer offensive could spark a new
humanitarian crisis in Ukraine,"
<https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/ukrainealert/russias-summer-offensive-could-spark-a-new-humanitarian-crisis-in-ukraine/>)
// gmemb

As the Russian army gears up for a major summer offensive[,
[Ukraine]{.mark} could soon be [facing]{.mark} its most **[serious
humanitarian crisis]{.mark}** since the initial phase of the full-scale
invasion more than three years ago.]{.underline} If the West does not
act swiftly by sending military aid, tightening sanctions, and
reaffirming its long-term commitment to Ukraine, the unfolding crisis
could overwhelm Kyiv and undermine the Ukrainian war effort.

Current Russian troop movements and battlefield dynamics indicate that
the coming summer offensive may be one of the largest and most ambitious
of the entire war. If successful, [this [campaign]{.mark} could [allow
Russian troops to push]{.mark} the [front line]{.mark} tens of
kilometers forward into Ukrainian-held territory and overrun parts of
Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia, and Dnipropetrovsk
provinces.]{.underline}

The cities of Kostyantynivka, Pokrovsk, and Kramatorsk are high on the
list of likely targets. They have all experienced significant damage and
large-scale displacement as a result of Russian bombardment. If these
cities and others in the surrounding area fall to the Russians in the
coming months, the wider region could become depopulated as large
numbers of people flee the fighting.

Based on current trends and previous displacement waves, [at least [two
hundred thousand Ukrainian civilians living close to the current front
lines]{.mark} of the war could be [forced to leave]{.mark} their [homes
by fall 2025]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is not speculation; it is
informed by experience gained during Russia's full-scale invasion.

Since the beginning of the invasion in February 2022, Ukrainian
organizations have been on the front lines of the [humanitarian
response](https://eef.org.ua/en/program/razom-my-shelter/). They have
provided essential aid, temporary housing, psychological support, and
ongoing reintegration counselling to help Ukrainians displaced by
Russia's invasion rebuild dignity and restart their lives.

[[Ukraine's civil society]{.mark} has [worked wonders over]{.mark} the
[past three years]{.mark} but [cannot]{.mark} realistically [hope to
absorb another 200,000 diplaced people **without international
support**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The situation is even more alarming due
to the recent closure of USAID, which was a major player in the
humanitarian response to Russia's invasion. With Putin's troops already
advancing, Ukraine's Western partners must not ignore the looming
danger.

According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs
(OCHA), more than 3.6 million people remained internally displaced
within Ukraine as of early 2025. Most are women, children, and elderly
individuals. Many have already been forced to flee multiple times. This
population of displaced people may soon become considerably larger.

Compounding the crisis, European governments are beginning to phase out
temporary support programs for Ukrainians. While the EU recently agreed
to extend temporary protection through 2026, enforcement is sometimes
patchy. Meanwhile, there are indications across Europe that resettlement
fatigue is growing.

In the UK and US, political rhetoric on the topic of Ukrainian refugees
has shifted ominously. Most
recently, [reports](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/05/20/trump-deporations-ukrainians-haitians/) emerged
that the Trump administration is exploring options to repatriate
Ukrainians who entered the United States following the start of the
full-scale Russian invasion.

If these trends continue, [[millions]{.mark} of [Ukrainians]{.mark}
could find themselves **[trapped]{.mark}** [between advancing Russian
forces and a closing window of international
asylum.]{.mark}]{.underline} While Ukrainians in the east of the country
flee Putin's invading army, many Ukrainian refugees may be forced to
return home with uncertain prospects.

If the overstretched Ukrainian military is unable to contain Russia's
summer offensive, the fallout will reverberate far beyond Ukraine's
borders[. The [displacement]{.mark} of at least 200,000 more civilians
would [severely strain humanitarian corridors]{.mark},
[destabilize]{.mark} [border regions]{.mark}, and [sow]{.mark}
[chaos]{.mark} in Ukrainian cities already struggling to absorb previous
waves of refugees.]{.underline}

Ukraine's Western partners still have time to prevent this, but they
must act with a sense of urgency. While the Trump administration has
been clear that it does not plan to provide Ukraine with further
military aid, it should continue sharing intelligence with the
Ukrainians while confirming its readiness to sell arms to Kyiv. Europe
must speed up the delivery of promised weapons and should expand
supplies significantly to improve Ukraine's position on the battlefield.

In parallel, European countries should take steps to provide reassurance
and protect the legal status of Ukrainian refugees. Donor organizations
can help by strengthening partnerships with Ukrainian civil society
groups that have demonstrated agility, transparency, and high levels of
local trust.

The next phase of Russia's invasion is not just being fought on the
front lines of the war. It is taking place across the country in bomb
shelters, train stations, and temporary accommodations. Russia is trying
to break Ukrainian resistance by making large parts of Ukraine unlivable
and destabilizing the country. [[Ukraine's partners]{.mark} can do much
to counter these efforts, but they [must]{.mark} **[act now]{.mark}**
[before]{.mark} the [military and humanitarian situation deteriorates
further.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Regime collapse will be peaceful and prevents large scale attacks on Ukraine

and director of the Transatlantic Security Program at the Center for a
New American Security (CNAS), Erica Frantz is an associate professor of
political science at Michigan State University, "Is Russia Better Off

https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/05/05/new-math-on-putin-00029966\]

[For years, [many]{.mark} within the Russia-watching community have
[argued]{.mark} that [Putin's departure would]{.mark} likely [unleash
instability]{.mark} inside Russia and exacerbate its foreign
aggression]{.underline}. For instance, a new leader who needed to
consolidate power could stoke nationalist or anti-Western undercurrents
already present in Russia to boost public support. Or, lacking Putin's
ability to balance Russia's competing factions, elite infighting could
spark political upheaval and violence that could destabilize the
country, which after all is a nuclear power. According to this line of
reasoning, Putin's critics should be careful what they wish for: a
Russia without Putin could be even worse for the West.

[[This]{.mark} view held some intellectual merit prior to Putin's
invasion of Ukraine, but now that [argument]{.mark} is [growing **weaker
by the day**]{.mark}]{.underline}. To justify the war, Putin has stoked
a dark and ugly nationalism inside Russia. His propaganda has convinced
many Russians of the legitimacy of his senseless "de-nazification"
campaign in Ukraine, so much so that some Russians have come to view the
killing of Ukrainian civilians as acceptable. Putin openly speaks of
"national traitors" and the need to "cleanse" them from society.
Repression has soared and Russians have taken to reporting on
"anti-patriotic" activities of their fellow citizens. [And it is
possible that even darker days lie ahead; [the worse Russia]{.mark}
[fares in Ukraine]{.mark}, the [greater]{.mark} the [prospect]{.mark}
that Putin will [turn to **cyberattacks**]{.mark} or **[chemical]{.mark}
[or nuclear weapons]{.mark}** to [avoid]{.mark} the [perception of
defeat.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[We have studied autocratic regimes for many years, and the [empirical
record]{.mark} increasingly [supports]{.mark} the conclusion
[that]{.mark} a [Russia with Putin is]{.mark} likely **to be [worse than
one without him.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

In our research, we have analyzed the leadership transitions of
autocrats who have been in power for 20 years or more, as Putin has
been, to gauge what is likely to happen once Putin leaves power.
Narrowing in on this subset of longtime leaders is important because
most authoritarian leaders govern for less than a decade, and the
political outcomes that follow longtime leaders' departures from office
differ considerably from their less durable authoritarian peers. [The
[historical track record]{.mark} of longtime autocrats [suggests]{.mark}
that [if Putin exited office as a result of domestic dynamics]{.mark}
--- that is, from coups, protests, or natural death in office ---
[Russia's political trajectory would]{.mark} be [unlikely]{.mark} to
[get worse]{.mark} in terms of repression and aggression than it is now
[and]{.mark} might **[even improve.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Take political stability. Russia's own Communist past could be seen as
supporting concerns about the potential for instability in Putin's wake.
After all, when Russia's longest serving leader, Joseph Stalin, died in
office after 29 years, a power struggle erupted over who would succeed
him. Nikita Khrushchev eventually emerged on top, but he was subject to
efforts by rivals in the Politburo to oust him and was eventually
removed in a palace coup after nine years. [Yet, despite this period of
leadership uncertainty, conditions in the Soviet Union improved markedly
after Stalin died]{.underline}. Moreover, Russia's post-Stalin
experience holds limited relevance for understanding Russian dynamics
today because political dynamics in autocracies have changed
significantly since the end of the Cold War, including in the ways that
autocrats come to and fall from power.

[When looking at [leadership transitions of]{.mark} longtime
[authoritarian leaders]{.mark} in the post-Cold War era, we see that
[coups and]{.mark} wide-scale [protests are **no more likely**
to]{.mark} erupt in the years [after]{.mark} such [leaders leave]{.mark}
[office]{.mark} then while they were in it]{.underline}. In those cases
where coups or mass protests did occur, the country was more likely to
have a level of wealth substantially lower than in today's Russia. In
Côte d'Ivoire, for example, former President Félix Houphouët-Boigny died
in office in 1993 after ruling for 33 years; his successor, Henri Konan
Bédié, was toppled in a coup in 1999. In Indonesia around the same time,
mass protests led to the ouster of longtime strongman Suharto in 1998
and continued the following year until his successor, B. J. Habibie, was
forced out too. Russia is significantly wealthier than both countries.

[The same pattern emerges when examining more significant forms of
instability such as state-based armed conflict, or domestic instability
involving at least 25 battlefield deaths]{.underline}. Looking at the
post-Cold War period, the chance of such conflict in any given year is
27 percent during longtime authoritarian leaders' tenures. The year
after these leaders leave office, it decreases to 11 percent and in the
10-year period that follows, the overall average is 16 percent. [Here
too, rates of [state-based armed conflict]{.mark} tend to be [lower
after]{.mark} longtime [authoritarian leaders **leave
power.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Collapse Good\-\--Transition Defense

#### Anyone is better than Putin -- even other authoritarian leaders

**Kendall-Taylor & Frantz 22** \[Andrea Kendall-Taylor is senior fellow
and director of the Transatlantic Security Program at the Center for a

Without Putin? The Answer is Changing," 05/05/2022,
https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/05/05/new-math-on-putin-00029966\]

[To be fair, in all likelihood, [authoritarianism in Russia will persist
beyond Putin]{.mark}]{.underline}. This has been true in 75 percent of
cases most like Putin's Russia. Sometimes, the same authoritarian regime
remains intact, as it did in Cuba following Fidel Castro's retirement in
2008 or Zimbabwe following the coup that ousted Robert Mugabe in 2017
after 30 years in power. In others, a new autocracy emerges, as in
Rwanda following the overthrow of Juvénal Habyarimana in 1994. In fact,
authoritarianism is so persistent in the wake of the departure of
longtime personalist leaders because the tactics they use to prolong
their rule --- quashing the opposition, silencing civil society and
hollowing out institutions --- create environments inhospitable to the
emergence of democracy.

[But even [a new autocrat]{.mark} at the helm could [**change the tone**
of]{.mark} Russian [politics]{.mark}, as the four-year term of Dmitry
Medvedev as Russia's president demonstrates]{.underline}. Although the
contours of Russian foreign policy remained intact from 2008 to 2012
(the years he served as president while Putin stepped into the prime
minister role), [the [switchover]{.mark} to Medvedev [created **new
opportunities for engagement**]{.mark} with Russia even as Putin
continued to hold the real power. It was [under Medvedev]{.mark}, for
example, that [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and Russia concluded
the New START]{.mark} nuclear [arms control treaty]{.mark} and [Russia
allowed Washington to expand]{.mark} a [logistics network]{.mark} in
Central Asia needed for transporting American equipment to
Afghanistan.]{.underline}

[But it's not just that [political conditions]{.mark} are [unlikely to
be worse]{.mark} in [post-Putin]{.mark} Russia; there is [also]{.mark}
**[substantial upside potential]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Here again,
Russia's comparatively higher level of wealth provides it some
advantages: [Although [economic riches]{.mark} help authoritarians
survive longer in office, they also [improve]{.mark} the [chance of
democracy]{.mark} should the leader exit power.]{.underline} Wealth
helps dictatorships withstand the "stresses of modernization," but it
also increases the likelihood they will succumb to pressures for popular
government upon the leader's departure.

[Chances for [liberalization would be even greater if Putin exits amid
street protests]{.mark}]{.underline} instead of a coup. In the five-year
period after protests unseated post-Cold War longtime autocrats, all
countries but one saw a new regime emerge --- and importantly, in half
of those cases the new regime was democratic. This is because when
protests unseat a leader, the transition is often accompanied by more
significant turnover among the ruling elite relative to other modes of
transition like coups. [And [even if democracy doesn't]{.mark} [emerge
immediately]{.mark}, the [historical record shows]{.mark} that [levels
of repression]{.mark} tend to [improve]{.mark} in the [years]{.mark}
[following]{.mark} a longtime [authoritarian]{.mark} leader's
[exit]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The United States has long had a Russia challenge, but in the last two
months it has become evident that it will be impossible to address that
broader challenge with Putin still in power. Of course, it would be
imprudent for the United States to adopt a formal policy of regime
change, but Washington need not pull any punches in fear that what
follows Putin would be worse[. The patterns of post-Cold War history
suggest that [political dynamics in Russia]{.mark} are unlikely to get
worse and might even **[get better once Putin
departs.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

#### Post-collapse political upheaval and disintegration is unlikely 

**Kolesnikov 23** \[Andrei Kolesnikov is a Former Senior Fellow at the
Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, "Regime Change in Russia Won't Lead to
Chaos or Collapse," 09/25/2023,
https://carnegieendowment.org/russia-eurasia/politika/2023/09/regime-change-in-russia-wont-lead-to-chaos-or-collapse?lang=en\]

[Widespread [indifference in Russia]{.mark} will [help]{.mark} an
[**orderly transition** to a new regime]{.mark}: ordinary people will
obey any ruler who appears to be legitimate]{.underline}. Beloved Putin
will no longer be beloved as soon as a power transition takes place.
[That's how it has always been.]{.underline}

Moreover, if we're talking historical precedents, [a [change of leader
in Russia]{.mark} has almost [always been]{.mark} [accompanied by
liberalization, not bloody chaos]{.mark} (Khrushchev's thaw after
Stalin, Gorbachev's perestroika after Brezhnev's gerontocracy, and
Yeltsin's reforms after the end of the Soviet Union). Even power
struggles at the top have not, historically speaking, tended to lead to
chaos.]{.underline}

Notably, the collapse of the Soviet Union did not lead to really serious
unrest in Russia. [Most [people]{.mark} were [focused on **survival,
adapting**]{.mark}, and---most importantly---taking advantage of the new
opportunities.]{.underline} It's true that the country witnessed a
battle between the president and parliament that ended in a brief moment
of civil war in October 1993. But most people were not involved, and
accepted the side that won. [In short, there is **[nothing to
indicate]{.mark}** that Ru[ssia's upcoming power]{.mark}
[transition]{.mark}, which will happen sooner or later, is [fated to
lead to a]{.mark} more [hawkish regime, or]{.mark} to
[chaos]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Another bogeyman promoted by some analysts is the
[disintegration]{.mark} of Russia. But this [is **even less likely**
than]{.mark} civil strife or the [emergence of a leader worse than
Putin]{.mark}]{.underline}. The rush for sovereignty in Russia in the
early 1990s was the result of regions trying to survive amid the trials
of constructing a new economy, and new state institutions. When we
remember the 1990s, we often forget the huge challenges facing the
government: from the lack of state agencies and a bureaucracy, to empty
coffers.

[There are compelling [**economic, budgetary, and political-management**
reasons why Russia will not]{.mark} [disintegrate]{.mark} in the
post-Putin era]{.underline}. Russia is not a particularly rich country,
and wealth inequality is compounded by regional inequality---making many
regions dependent on federal subsidies. [In short, [regional economies
cannot survive on their own]{.mark}, and leaving the Russian Federation
would cause serious problems.]{.underline}

If there is an appetite among regional leaders for independence, it
exists only in Russia's national republics---but, again, most of these
are net recipients of subsidies, and get political investment in
exchange for ensuring social calm (it's no coincidence that the amount
of money going into the budget of the occupied port city of Sevastopol
in Crimea rose 54 percent in the first half of 2023).

In addition, recent years have seen regional leaders transformed into
technocrats whose every move is closely controlled by the federal
center. They depend on Moscow for everything, and are accountable to the
Kremlin---not the local people. All such regional leaders aspire to get
a plum job in the federal government, not to become a powerful local
leader.

You have to give the Kremlin its due: it's been successful in creating a
system populated by loyal technocrats who see themselves as temporary
managers who can be hired or fired at will. This is an insurance policy
against regional separatism.

A relatively optimistic scenario for a power transition is one in which
Putin's successor is a technocrat. It's not a given that he will be
replaced by someone often tipped for the role (from Patrushev's son,
Agriculture Minister Dmitry Patrushev, to United Russia leader Andrei
Turchak, State Duma Speaker Vyacheslav Volodin, or Kremlin deputy chief
of staff Sergei Kiriyenko). It could just as easily be someone like
Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin (the second most trusted politician in
Russia, according to Levada Center polling) or Moscow Mayor Sergei
Sobyanin. Mishustin and Sobyanin have both striven to preserve their
reputations as pragmatic managers.

[Given the gradual, inevitable exhaustion of Putin's governance
model---financially, socially, economically, psychologically, and
politically---a technocratic or temporary leader will need to be able to
ensure a transition toward normalization. [There's **no way things can
be worse**]{.mark}...]{.underline}

#### Fears of a worse leader are Putin propaganda 

**Bugajski 18** \[Janusz Bugajski; Author at the Center for European
Policy Analysis, "Russia After Putin," 03/01/2018,
https://cepa.org/article/russia-after-putin/\]

[The [notion tha]{.mark}t the [removal of]{.mark} a Russian [leader
is]{.mark} a **[dangerous]{.mark} endeavor** [is]{.mark} deeply [rooted
in Soviet]{.mark} and Tsarist [tradition]{.mark}.]{.underline} Each of
Moscow's rulers is portrayed as the infallible representative of the
Russian state and the supreme defender of its people. ["Without Putin
there is no Russia" is a phrase heard among the most fawning officials.
It demonstrates how [tsars]{.mark}, secretary-[generals, and presidents
are depicted]{.mark} as quasi-[divine figures]{.mark}. To escape from
[this **autocratic straitjacket**]{.mark}**,** Russia's
[citizens]{.mark} periodically [rebel but]{.mark} are quickly [strapped
down]{.mark} again [through **repression and
propaganda.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

It is worth remembering the warnings of the early 1990s about the
regional and global conflagrations that would happen if communist rule
collapsed or if the Soviet Union disintegrated. [In reality,
**[neither]{.mark} episode** [triggered international conflict]{.mark}.
On the contrary, Russia's neighbors celebrated the dissolution of the
Soviet bloc and of the Soviet Union itself. Each country could finally
achieve independence, and most states sought membership in Western
institutions without fear of Moscow's violent reprisals.]{.underline}

As Putin is unlikely to voluntarily disappear into the sunset, his
ouster is likely to be sudden and possibly violent. He faces three
scenarios of abrupt replacement, other than a natural death or a fatal
accident: assassination, a power struggle, or a popular revolt.

[One [key element of]{.mark} Kremlin [**disinformation** is to
convince]{.mark} NATO capitals [that]{.mark} the [fall of]{.mark}
Vladimir [Putin]{.mark} will [spark]{.mark} a global
[Armageddon]{.mark}. Russian [officials, propagandists, trolls,]{.mark}
and gullible Westerners [recite]{.mark} the credo that [regime change in
Russia will precipitate **chaos, conflict, and** ]{.mark}**even
[a]{.mark} nuclear [war]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Instead of succumbing to
such hyperbole, it is valuable to consider Russia's "Fuehrer
Principle"\* while evaluating potential alternatives to Putin.

The Lukashenko regime in Belarus cannot exist without the economic and
power support from Moscow. [The [Belarusian democratic
revolution]{.mark} of 2020 was [suppressed by]{.mark} the
[Russia]{.mark}n Federation]{.underline}. Lukashenko possesses few
independent resources to defend his unpopular regime. His participation
in the Ukrainian war has left him completely dependent on the Kremlin,
effectively relinquishing his country's sovereignty. The moment a
political crisis arises in Moscow, the turmoil will immediately spread
to Belarus. [Currently [detained opposition leaders]{.mark}, including
Viktar Babaryka and Sergei Tikhonovskiy, [who]{.mark}se wife Svetlana
[**probably won** the]{.mark} 2020 [Presidential election]{.mark}, would
[likely come to power.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The [government]{.mark} of Kassym-Jomart Tokayev [sacrificed
Kazakhstan's national sovereignty]{.mark} by inviting Russian troops
[to]{.mark} help [suppress protests]{.mark} there last January,
alienating the Kazakh-speaking majority, and the Almaty elite, who
largely shape public opinion, and were already outraged by Tokayev's
orders to shoot peaceful protesters]{.underline}. The continuing turmoil
has helped produce and is exacerbated by the sharp decline of
Kazakhstan's economy, Central Asia's largest, a downturn compounded by
sanctions imposed on the Russian Federation, and by Kazakhstan's
membership in the Eurasian Economic Union.

[The [future leader]{.mark} of Kazakhstan [will be someone who
has]{.mark} the **sup[port of the Kazakh-speaking
majority]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} and isn't tainted by last January's
bloodshed.]{.underline} Imangali Tasmagambetov has the best shot.
Immensely popular, and not a Kremlin puppet, he might be the only
candidate who could consolidate support throughout Kazakh society, and
enact independent and pragmatic policies.

Russia's [former]{.mark} satellite [countries, and]{.mark} the
[restoration of]{.mark} their **[territorial
integrity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. With the support of Turkey, Azerbaijan
will take complete possession of Karabakh while ensuring its historic
autonomy within Azerbaijan. Georgia would be in a strong position to
recover South Ossetia and Abkhazia.

[In Moldova, despite Acting Russian Commander Rustam Minnikaev's recent
claim that Moscow's forces could extend control along the Black Sea
coast to Transnistria, should the Russian army falter, Transnistria
could be unified with Chisinău, [paving]{.mark} the [way for Moldova's

### Collapse Good\-\--Democracy

#### Putin will collapse democracy -- try or die for a regime change 

**Kozyrev 22** \[Andrei Kozyrev is an author and former politician who
was the Russian Federation's first foreign minister, "Why Putin Must Be
Defeated," 05/2022,
https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/why-putin-must-be-defeated/\]

The more determined democracies are to avoid war, the greater the risk
that autocracies will wage it. The claim of military success helps
autocrats to seize and hold power. [Thus, [the war in Ukraine
will]{.mark} likely [be]{.mark} a [defining]{.mark} moment [for]{.mark}
Russia that will also have repercussions all over the world. If the West
allows Putin to claim victory in Ukraine, [antidemocracy]{.mark}
[populists]{.mark} everywhere [will celebrate]{.mark}, believing that
they can do whatever they want, and Pu[tin will **cement his
dictatorship in Russia**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Not only his acolytes in
government but also a large part of the Russian populace will believe
the Kremlin propaganda telling them that Putin's leadership is amassing
victories. If Russia wins this war, his agents of influence and useful
idiots in the West will be singing his praises while police repression
in Russia is ratcheted up even more---just to be on the safe side.

[A few weeks after the beginning of the invasion, [Putin pushed]{.mark}
several [laws]{.mark} through his puppet parliament [and signed
ex]{.mark}ecutive [o]{.mark}rder[s]{.mark} basically
[criminalizing]{.mark} all forms of [dissent and]{.mark} the remnants of
[independent media]{.mark}.]{.underline} These moves, as Andrei
Kolesnikov, a senior fellow at the now-shuttered Carnegie Moscow Center,
wrote, resemble the Nazification of German society (a process known as
Gleichschaltung) after the Nazi's seized power in 1933. Hitler sought to
"coordinate" and control all political, social, cultural, and
educational institutions in the name of national unity.

But Russia does not need the example of Nazi Germany, however striking
the parallels may be, to serve as a roadmap. Russia has its own
totalitarian legacy---Josef Stalin's ruthless dictatorship, which
Putin's Russia is increasingly coming to resemble. For example, a new
law passed in March makes public statements that contradict the Kremlin
on the war in Ukraine punishable by up to fifteen years in prison. "The
history of mass execution and political imprisonment in the Soviet era,
and the denunciation of fellow citizens encouraged by the state . . .
now looms over Russia's deepening . . . repression," writes Anton
Troianovski. As in Soviet times, the more that ordinary people fear
being suspected of disloyalty to the Kremlin, the more likely they will
be to turn on each other. [[Repression]{.mark} and intimidation are key
pillars of a totalitarian state that reduces citizens to an obedient
population.]{.underline} In the words of Bertrand Russell, "collective
fear stimulates herd instinct and tends to produce ferocity towards
those who are not regarded as members of the herd."

[The collective fear of repression [is a **fierce enemy** of
democracy]{.mark}, but it is not the only driver of the herd mentality
so necessary to totalitarianism]{.underline}. Fear of changing social
dynamics---such as cultural pluralism, rapid technical development, and
globalization---which many find especially hard to keep up with, also
builds the herd. Putin's base resides predominantly outside of Moscow
and other major urban centers, is notably less educated, and comprises a
mass of angry, struggling people. The older ones are nostalgic for the
days when they were young and the grass was green, forgetting of course
that they had frequently suffered under the old order. The younger ones
are a mob of poorly educated malcontents looking for a strongman to
transform them from the losers of modern society into its winners.

People who are afraid of change seek solace in scapegoating an "enemy,"
simply defined as different, untraditional, or foreign. Putin's
propaganda succeeded in portraying Ukraine as an immediate enemy that
can and should be trampled for breaking away from Mother Russia and for
being the proxy of far greater and more distant adversaries---the United
States and NATO. Defeating those enemies would help to keep the Russian
herd under control and disprove the idea that Russia's cousins next door
could ever go it alone and choose democracy.

[[Putin's]{.mark} full-scale [aggression in Ukraine]{.mark} has
[galvanized]{.mark} the [Antidemocracy]{.mark} International---from the
Chinese Communist Party to the U.S. ultraright.]{.underline} Many
believed that Russia would win quickly and easily. As Washington was
warning of the massive Russian military buildup on the Ukrainian border,
Chinese president Xi Jinping and Putin met on 4 February 2022, ahead of
the Beijing Olympics. They signed a long communiqué outlining future
areas of cooperation and claimed there were "no limits" to their
commitments.

At about the same time, former U.S. president Donald Trump, still a
leader of the Republican Party, spoke admiringly of Putin to a crowd of
supporters, saying "they ask me, 'Is Putin smart?' Yes, Putin was smart.
And I thought he was going to be negotiating. I said, 'That's a hell of
a way to negotiate, put 200,000 soldiers on the border.'" In those
awkwardly worded remarks one can recognize the Putinesque leitmotifs of
mocking an elected leader for being weak and praising a dictator for
using or threatening armed force, regardless of its being in violation
of existing norms of civilized behavior. No wonder it came from a
politician who tried to hold on to power despite having lost an
election. In Russia, "smart Putin" has freed himself from such burdens
by simply doctoring electoral results in his and his supporters' favor.

Europe's far right has had its own romance with the Russian autocrat for
many years. Hungary's Orbán has long been viewed as a potential leader
of the new Antidemocracy International by right-wing advocates in the
United States. Orbán's coalition won almost 53 percent of the vote in
Hungary's April 2022 election versus the opposition's 34 percent. In
Serbia, the unapologetically pro-Putin Aleksandar Vučić was reelected
president in April 2022 by a sweeping margin. In France, Marine Le Pen,
leader of the far-right National Rally, is literally indebted to Putin.
Her party, denied financing from French banks, took out a US\$12.2
million loan from a Russian bank in 2014. In the first round of France's
April 2022 presidential election, Le Pen came in second to Emmanuel
Macron for a second time, but by a significantly narrower margin than in
2017. (She was, however, soundly beaten in the runoff.)

European and U.S. right-wing populism is similar to that of Russia in
the make-up of its political base and in its messaging. Trump, Orbán,
and Le Pen voters tend to be less urban, have less formal education, and
be more anxious about the rapidly changing cultural and economic
landscapes. The rhetoric of these aspiring autocrats, like Putin's,
signals to their followers that the dizzying complexity of the modern
world is actually nothing more than a battle between a good "us" and a
bad "them," whose ranks include foreigners and minorities as well as, in
the case of Russia, the decadent West and liberals, who represent all
the above. This is a sign that democracy is in danger.

The End of Ideology

Despite similarities, however, the leaders of the Antidemocracy
International have no unifying or consistent set of ideas. They simply
want power for themselves. It is only the rejection of democracy that
brings them together. But it cannot mobilize a mass movement to the
extent of self-destructive social engineering and world war in the way
that messianic ideologies have. The two most portentous examples of such
mass madness---Soviet communism and Nazi fascism---were defeated and
discredited in the twentieth century. In the twenty-first century,
Muslim fundamentalism, another potential stirrer of mass hyperdelirium,
has failed to produce anything more than terrorism, thereby securing its
worldwide rejection. There is an animated debate concerning the end of
history, but the history of ideologies is over, at least for now.

What has emerged in their place? The now-universal ideas of a market
economy and a publicly supported government. As it turns out, however,
implementing them takes a lot of work. Democracy is not an ideology. But
it is the best of all forms of government, all of which (including
democracy) are imperfect. Autocracy, in contrast, is a bad form of
government. Democracy---with its endless debates and elaborate
procedures, and seemingly dominated by a globalized, overeducated
elite---may appear too mundane and uninspiring to win over the doubters
who are overwhelmed by modern life. They instead take refuge in dreams
of reviving the past. Those dreams are what nurture and feed the
populists and autocrats.

Yet for many, nothing is more inspiring than freedom. Thus the fearless
Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelensky, was able to mobilize and unite
his people to fight the Russian invaders, and has called for building
Ukraine's democracy and for joining Europe. The international response
to Putin's aggression in Ukraine has also been encouraging. Both sides
of the political aisle in the United States have supported providing
assistance to Ukraine. A divided electorate in France banded together to
defeat Le Pen, and after Orbán's win at the polls, Hungary supported the
EU's decision to impose a fifth set of sanctions on Russia. Although
China and India abstained from condemning the Russian war, they have
also refrained from providing Moscow with any meaningful assistance,
especially military support. And even though they are clearly taking
advantage of Russia's self-imposed trading limits in the Western markets
by buying Russian oil at huge discounts, Moscow's old dream of creating
an anti-Western axis with the two Asian giants remains unrealized.
Putin's friendship with Xi has proved far from limitless. Both Beijing
and New Delhi understand the difference between words denouncing the
existing world order and deeds able to damage it. In contrast to a
declining Russia, China and India are rising and increasingly able to
compete with the United State and Europe for influence on the
international stage and a better place within the existing world order,
amended to their taste but not destroyed.

[Putin's [war on Ukraine has laid]{.mark} [bare the **critical need** to
defend]{.mark} and promote [democracy]{.mark} in Europe, the United
States, and elsewhere.]{.underline} But it has also demonstrated
democracy's amazing resilience. [The [brutality of]{.mark} the
[Russian]{.mark} [war]{.mark} has [reminded people]{.mark} everywhere
[of the **existential danger**]{.mark} that [autocracy poses]{.mark}
because it relies on violence at home and, in many cases,
abroad.]{.underline} Prodemocracy forces in the West and beyond have
mobilized once again. Democracy is still on the march, however
treacherous the path ahead may be.

Prabowo\'s trip came a month after Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar
Ibrahim\'s latest visit to Russia, his third in two years.

and leadership\'*Image: Picvario Media/picture alliance*

[Although [Indonesia](https://www.dw.com/en/indonesia/t-63713737) and
[Malaysia](https://www.dw.com/en/malaysia/t-66518613) did initially
condemn Russia\'s [invasion of
Ukraine](https://www.dw.com/en/russias-war-in-ukraine/t-60931789) in
early 2022, they have typically taken a neutral position on the ongoing
war. Beginning early 2024, their public statements have also become
noticeably more pro-Moscow.]{.underline}

During his trip to Vladivostok in September last year, [[Anwar praised
Putin for his \"vision and leadership\" and]{.mark} for his
\"[determination...to survive]{.mark},\" presumably referring to Western
sanctions.]{.underline}

He also championed Moscow for [its **[\"remarkable soft
power\"]{.mark}** that has [earned]{.mark} it \"[global]{.mark}
**[respect]{.mark}** and **[admiration]{.mark}**, [influencing]{.mark}
the [**hearts** and **minds**]{.mark} of people around the
world.\"]{.underline}

Indonesia and Malaysia balance interests

Prabowo and Anwar \"are keen to strengthen their countries\'
non-alignment by pursuing a more balanced foreign policy, including
closer ties with both Russia and China,\" Ian Storey, senior fellow at
Singapore\'s ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute and author of the
newly-released book, \'Putin\'s Russia and Southeast Asia,\' told DW.

\"A more balanced foreign policy includes strengthening economic
engagement with Moscow, even though the opportunities for growing trade
and investment ties with Russia are quite limited,\" he added.

Despite the limitations, [[Russia\'s bilateral trade]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} Association of Southeast Asian Nations ([ASEAN]{.mark})
countries [grew to a record high]{.mark} of \$22 billion in 2023,
according to Russian data cited by the Lowy Institute, an Australian
think tank. That represents more than 14% year-on-year growth. This
growth trend is [expected to continue]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta are exploring possible ways to expand trade,
including in arms imports. Energy is another important area of
cooperation, especially for Indonesia, which still heavily relies on
coal as a source of power.

Several Southeast Asian states have an interest in exporting electrical
goods and machinery to Russia, which has faced crippling Western
sanctions since 2022.

They are keen on utilizing Russian expertise to develop their civilian
nuclear energy sectors. [Last month, [Vietnam and Moscow agreed **to
fast-track agreements** that could see Russian firms help build
Vietnam\'s first nuclear power plants.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In February, ASEAN Secretary General Kao Kim Hourn opened an exhibition
on ASEAN-Russia Cooperation in Civilian Nuclear Energy and Technologies
at the regional bloc\'s headquarters in Jakarta.

In St. Petersburg last month[, [Indonesia\'s sovereign wealth
fund]{.mark}, Danatara, [and]{.mark} the [Russian Direct Investment Fund
signed an agreement to create an investment fund worth €2
billion.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Alternative international forums

While several Southeast Asian countries are looking to join multilateral
organizations, such as Thailand\'s successful bid to join the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), many have
looked to the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa)
grouping as an alternative arena for global politics.

Indonesia is now a formal member of
[BRICS](https://www.dw.com/en/what-is-brics-and-why-does-it-matter/a-73087358),
while Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam are partner countries.

What is BRICS and what does it want?

![](media/image1.png){width="8.333333333333333e-3in"
height="8.333333333333333e-3in"}

Although Malaysia and Indonesia\'s governments began their overtures
with Russia before Donald Trump\'s return to the White House in January,
Washington turning away from international institutions since then has
convinced many Asian leaders that they can no longer count on US support
and that the future of the Western-backed international order might soon
be over, analysts say.

\"The recent change in US administration and opportunities like BRICS
membership have provided both governments with more space to engage
Russia,\" Prashanth Parameswaran, founder of the weekly ASEAN Wonk
newsletter, told DW.

What do Malaysia and Indonesia want?

However, it remains unclear to what extent Malaysia and Indonesia are
merely engaging with Russia out of geopolitical necessity to diversify
their bilateral relations and [avoid entanglement in the US-China
rivalry](https://www.dw.com/en/southeast-asia-walks-tightrope-between-china-and-us/a-72275663),
or how much they have a deeper affinity with Moscow\'s vision for the
world.

When asked by reporters why he turned down a G7 invitation to instead
visit Russia, Prabowo replied, \"Don\'t read too much into it ...We want
to be friends with everybody.\"

However, attending the G7 event in Canada would have given him his first
opportunity to meet US President Donald Trump.

However, the speech in St. Petersburg \"did not come across as
convincing that Indonesia would remain neutral in the ongoing big power
rivalry, with veiled criticisms of the US on the one hand, and a
lavishing of praise for China and Russia on the other,\" according to a
*Jakarta Post* analysis piece published this week.

Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington,
said that [[Russia]{.mark} provides an \"interesting model\" for
Indonesia and Malaysia.]{.underline}

[It is a country \"that [can act independently, poke America and the
West in the eye, and try to establish a new international
order,\"]{.mark}]{.underline} he told DW.

Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar\'s several visits to
[Russia](https://www.dw.com/en/russia/t-19065060) over the past two
years have motivated the party by a desire to gain a more prominent
position on the world stage, Bridget Welsh, an honorary research
associate at the University of Nottingham\'s Asia Research Institute
Malaysia, told DW.

But it is also because Russia is \"popular at home due to
anti-westernism, with many Malaysians believing that the US provoked the
Ukraine War,\" she added.

This year\'s State of Southeast Asia Survey, a poll of \"elite\" opinion
in the region conducted by the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, found that
anti-Western feeling is riding high in Muslim-majority Indonesia and
Malaysia, in large measure due to the West\'s support for Israel in its
Middle Eastern wars.

### Collapse Bad\-\--Arctic

#### Putin is positioning himself as a global economic strategist by promoting Arctic development and courting investment from the Global South to boost Russia's trade with Asia.

// gmemb

MOSCOW, March 26 (Reuters) - Russia sees scope for international
investors, including from the Global South, to help develop its Arctic
region, a senior official said on Wednesday.

[President Vladimir [Putin]{.mark} is [keen to ramp up commerce
via]{.mark} the [Northern Sea Route]{.mark} through Arctic waters [as
Russia shifts trade towards Asia and away from Europe because of Western
sanctions.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Focus on the strategic importance of the Arctic for mining, shipping and
international security has increased sharply because of repeated
statements by U.S. President [Donald
Trump](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/donald-trump/)that he wants to
acquire [Greenland](https://www.reuters.com/world/greenland/).

[\"We believe that [concessions of the Northern Sea Route]{.mark} and
various infrastructure facilities, with our investment support, can
[attract]{.mark} [**significant financing**,]{.mark}\"]{.underline} said
Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) which
works with foreign investors.

[\"We see the [opportunity to attract]{.mark} our [partners]{.mark}
[from]{.mark} the countries of the [Global South]{.mark}, their
[investment opportunities]{.mark}, their
[companies]{.mark},\"]{.underline} he said in a speech by video link to
a conference on the Arctic, attended by Russian government officials and
regional authorities.

The event was taking place in Murmansk near Russia\'s border with
Norway. The northern port marks the start of the Northern Sea Route,
which runs eastward to the Bering Strait near Alaska.

[[The route]{.mark}, though significantly shorter than the Suez Canal
for Russia to deliver cargoes to Asia, is [challenging]{.mark} and
[requires]{.mark} the assistance of [icebreakers]{.mark} to help vessels
to pass along the northern coast of Russia.]{.underline}

[[But]{.mark} it has become [more viable because of global
warming]{.mark}, which Dmitriev said [brings]{.mark} [\"interesting\"
prospects for developing]{.mark} it.]{.underline}

Besides heading the RDIF, the U.S.-educated Dmitriev - who has worked at
McKinsey and Goldman Sachs - was named by Putin last month as
his [special
envoy](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-appoints-russia-sovereign-wealth-fund-chief-kirill-dmitriev-special-envoy-2025-02-23/) on
international economic and investment cooperation, and is an important
player in the [[rapid rapprochement]{.mark} that [Putin]{.mark} is
[pursuing with]{.mark} the **[Trump]{.mark}
administration**.]{.underline}

### Collapse Bad\-\--Economy

#### Russia's strong economic growth, low unemployment, and global cooperation through BRICS contribute to global stability and development beyond raw material exports.

<https://pluralia.com/en/news/putin-at-spief2025-russia-at-the-center-of-global-economic-change/>)
// gmemb

The central event of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum
(SPIEF'2025) was the plenary session on June 20, during which the
President of the Russian Federation delivered a keynote speech. Vladimir
Putin presented an organic and balanced vision of the ways of economic
and social development of mankind.

According to the Russian president, despite the rather "complicated"
political and economic background, Russia's gross domestic product (GDP)
has been adding more than four percent annually in recent years, "that
means," Putin emphasized, ["[Russian GDP]{.mark} has been
**[growing]{.mark}** at a rate **[above]{.mark}** the **[world
average]{.mark}."**]{.underline}

Speaking about the structure of GDP growth, Putin mentioned "a special
indicator -- the so-called non-oil and gas GDP, cleared of the influence
of industries related to hydrocarbon extraction."

[Russia's [economic performance]{.mark} is indeed [impressive]{.mark}:
Russian [GDP growth in 2023]{.mark}, excluding Russian oil and gas, was
[+7.2%]{.mark} (oil and gas up +3.6%), and GDP growth in 2024 was +4.9%
(+4.3%).]{.underline}

"At the same time," Putin stressed, "the overall growth of the Russian
economy was tied no just to the defense-industrial complex, as some
believe. [Over the past two years, [growth]{.mark} has [accelerated in
agriculture, industry in general, the construction complex, banking and
finance, and]{.mark} the [IT]{.mark} industry[.]{.mark}"]{.underline}

In Putin's opinion, it is time to abandon the idea of the Russian
economy as an exclusively raw materials economy: "The perception of the
Russian economy as an exclusively raw material economy dependent on
hydrocarbon exports is clearly outdated, it is a thing of the
past. Reality tells a different story[: [Russia]{.mark} already ranks
[fourth]{.mark} in the world [in]{.mark} terms of [gross domestic
product,]{.mark} and [first in Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}," the Russian
president said, adding that Russia's GDP grew again by 1.5 percent in
the first four months of 2025.

Speaking about the social situation in the Russian economy, Putin noted
that the country has reached a historic record in reducing poverty: "We
have already done much to outpace income growth for our nation's least
well-off citizens. I would like to speak about this separately and to
emphasize in particular that [we have achieved an [all-time record
reduction in the poverty rate]{.mark} in the Russian
Federation.]{.underline} At the end of last year, it amounted to 7.2
percent, and the positive trend here continues," the Russian president
said. Added to this is the record low unemployment rate: ["We have
achieved [historic lows in unemployment]{.mark}. What is important:
there are [positive dynamics]{.mark} in the subjects of the Russian
Federation, where the problem of employment has traditionally been
acute,"]{.underline} Putin said. The head of state specified that the
unemployment rate in the country had stabilized at 2.3 percent. ["Over
the past four years, the [number of employed people in Russia]{.mark}
has [grown by 2 million 400 thousand]{.mark} people. Since last October,
the unemployment rate has stabilized in the country as a whole and is
about 2.3 percent,"]{.underline} the president said.

In the coming years, the Kremlin and regional authorities will pay
special attention to further improving the investment climate in which
Russian and foreign investors work and will continue to work: ["We have
set ourselves a task: the volume of investment in fixed capital in
Russia should grow by at least 60 percent by 2030 compared to the level
of 2020,"]{.underline} the Russian President emphasized. The most
investor-friendly Russian regions are the city of Moscow, the Republic
of Tatarstan, and the Nizhny Novgorod Region.

As for the possibility of the return of foreign companies, Putin said
that the Russian government is working out the relevant principles, with
the key rule being the following: [we will accept anything that will
contribute to the development of the Russian economy.]{.underline}

Particular attention was paid to the need to continue the integration of
civil and defense industries, ensuring continuous and mutual transfer of
advanced technologies between civil production and the
military-industrial complex.

The global economy is undergoing a period of unprecedented
transformation. Against this background, the role and importance of
international organizations promoting the idea of a multipolar world is
rapidly increasing: "Whereas when the BRICS group was founded, its
countries made up one-fifth of the global economy, today it is already
40 percent of the global economy. [[Mutual trade turnover]{.mark}
between our countries has already exceeded [one trillion]{.mark}
dollars]{.underline}," emphasized Putin, according to whom all BRICS
member states are Russia-friendly countries "that are actively working
on the formation of a new model of global development, free from
political manipulation."

At the same time, the share of the G7 countries in the world economy is
steadily declining every year: "Look at recent years: how the so-called
G7's share of the world economy has shrunk. It continues to decline year
after year. At the same time, [the [share of BRICS countries]{.mark} is
**[growing]{.mark}**. This is an [objective]{.mark}
process,"]{.underline} Putin said.

["Only broader international cooperation within the framework of modern
international organizations such as [BRICS]{.mark} can [ensure]{.mark}
the **[progress of human civilization]{.mark}**,"]{.underline} Putin
added.

### Collapse Bad\-\--New Leader

#### 80% chance Putin will be replaced with someone just as bad or worse \-\-- Empirics prove

**Menon & DePetris 22** \[Rajan Menon is the director of the Grand
Strategy Program at Defense Priorities, a professor emeritus at the
Powell School, City College, and a senior research fellow at the
Saltzman Institute for War and Peace Studies, Columbia, Daniel R
DePetris is a fellow at Defense Priorities and a foreign affairs
columnist for the Chicago Tribune and Newsweek, "Those desiring regime
change in Russia should be careful what they wish for," 09/30/2022,
https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/sep/30/those-desiring-regime-change-in-russia-should-be-careful-what-they-wish-for\]

Vladimir Putin's 21 September mobilization order, which aims to deploy
300,000 reservists to Ukraine, and possibly as many as 1.2 million, is
an act of desperation aimed at saving a faltering war that he now owns.
But his military call-up is also a huge gamble. For 22 years Putin has
solidified his rule through an implicit pact with the Russian people:
don't make political waves and you will live comfortably. His
mobilization order has broken that pact, and many Russians are taking to
the streets or running to the border to flee the country.

[It's not hyperbole to suggest that Putin is facing his biggest
challenge since becoming president in 2000. A leader who once seemed
infallible and irreplaceable suddenly appears vulnerable, so much so
that the media is now speculating about whether Putin might lose
power.]{.underline}

The honest answer is that no one knows for sure. But what can be said
with reasonable certainty is that [the hypothetical [downfall of
Putin]{.mark}, as morally satisfying as it would be, [is **unlikely** to
be simple and straightforward]{.mark}. Nor should anyone assume that a
Russia without Putin would make the west more secure.]{.underline}

To be sure, cracks are appearing in the political edifice Putin has
built over past two decades. Approximately 2,300 protesters have been
arrested since the Russian military mobilization order was announced
last week. Many Russian men eligible for the draft are now trying to
leave for Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, even Mongolia -- in
short, any potential haven. At least 200,000 Russians have fled the
country since the mobilization order went into effect; the number of
Russians crossing into Finland increased by 80% from the week prior.

Military-age men in poor, remote Russian regions like Siberia and
Dagestan, which have suffered a disproportionate number of casualties in
the war, are especially outraged about being conscripted into a
faltering army. And the slipshod, uncoordinated implementation of
Putin's order has only fueled the anger.

Town councilors in St Peterburg recently petitioned the national
parliament to try Putin for treason. Another petition, signed by nearly
100 district-level elected leaders across Russia, called on him to
resign.

[[Could]{.mark} the growing [discord in Russia weaken Putin's]{.mark}
political [position]{.mark} to the point where his authority crumbles
[and]{.mark} a pro-western [democracy takes its
place]{.mark}?]{.underline} There is no doubt many analysts in the west
are hoping for such an outcome. David Kramer, a former official in the
George W Bush administration, spoke for many when he wrote last May that
Putin's downfall would be a huge defeat for global authoritarianism.

[Yet [such optimism assumes]{.mark} that [regime change]{.mark} in
Russia [will]{.mark} eventually [usher in a political system]{.mark}
marked by free and fair elections, pluralism, an unfettered media, an
independent judiciary and accountable leaders -- [in]{.mark} other
words, [the best-case scenario]{.mark}. This would not be the first time
American leaders have placed such a bet.]{.underline}

[Unfortunately, [those bets **haven't paid off**]{.mark}. Consider
[post-Saddam Iraq]{.mark},]{.underline} which, despite US attempts to
create a beacon of democracy in the Arab world, [has been [plagued
by]{.mark} sectarian [violence, civil war,]{.mark} [corruption]{.mark}
and a political elite more interested in preserving the privileges of
power than meeting the needs of their constituents.]{.underline}

[Likewise, [the US and Nato bombing]{.mark} campaign [to assist Libyan
rebels]{.mark} in ousting Muammar Gaddafi [was supposed to make
Libya]{.mark} blossom into [a democracy.]{.mark}]{.underline} "I am
proud to stand here on the soil of a free Libya," then-secretary of
state Hillary Clinton declared shortly before Gaddafi's execution.

The dream of a Libyan democracy, however, was just that: a dream. [In
reality, the [north Africa]{.mark}n country [has been]{.mark} mired
[in]{.mark} civil [war for **over a decade**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}
Its political landscape is fractured between a constellation of
militias, rival governments and terrorist groups. The country is also a
chief way station for tens of thousands of people crossing the
Mediterranean Sea to Europe. More than 3,000 died attempting that
crossing last year alone.

True, Russia isn't Iraq or Libya. Nor are US officials proposing
forcible regime change in Moscow, as they did in those two countries.
It's a sensible policy: unlike Saddam Hussein or Gaddafi, [Vladimir
Putin has more than 5,900 **nuclear warheads** at his disposal and an
army that, although weaker and less competent than western military
analysts expected, still possesses formidable firepower.]{.underline}

[But the fact remains that [the US has a terrible track record of
predicting events after a strongman is removed]{.mark}. [A post-Putin
Russia could]{.mark} turn out to be more than a disappointment. It could
[prove]{.mark} **[downright dangerous.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[To start, [another strongman could]{.mark} take over and [continue the
war in Ukraine]{.mark}.]{.underline} Studies suggest that [[**only 20%**
of]{.mark} personality-based [autocracies **become
democracies**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Putin could be replaced by someone
from his inner circle who is even more ruthless -- Nikolai Patrushev,
the secretary of Russia's security council, may be one candidate.

Putin has managed to keep the Russian elite together, but if he left
they could turn on one another. And Russia's security services, the
siloviki, could seize the opportunity to settle scores -- sometimes
violently.

[Or [Muslim regions]{.mark} in Russia, such as Chechnya or Dagestan,
[might use the]{.mark} post-Putin political [vacuum]{.mark} [to seek
greater autonomy]{.mark}, even outright independence, as they have in
the past. [Russia]{.mark} might [move]{.mark} [to crush]{.mark} what it
sees as [secessionism and precipitate a **prolonged civil war** in a
country with]{.mark} nearly [**6,000** nuclear
warheads]{.mark}.]{.underline}

These are just some possibilities; no one can foretell what will happen.
This much is clear, though: while a democratic future for Russia cannot
be ruled out, neither can one or more of these other outcomes, each
dangerous. Upheaval in Iraq and Libya is one thing, prolonged
instability and bloodletting in the world's only other nuclear
superpower quite another.

[[A Russia without Putin could undergo]{.mark} monumental
[change]{.mark} -- but **[not necessarily]{.mark}** of the sort that is
anticipated or **[desirable]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

### Collapse Bad\-\--Internal Conflict

#### Collapse is bad for civil relations

**Laruelle 22** \[Marlene Laruelle is Director and Research Professor at
the Institute for European, Russian, and Eurasian Studies at George
Washington University, "Putin's War and the Dangers of Russian
Disintegration," 12/09/2022,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/russian-federation/putins-war-and-dangers-russian-disintegration\]

But Western policymakers should not fall into the trap of conflating
political exiles' radical statements with the views of Russian citizens,
which are much more nuanced. [It would also be [wrong to assume]{.mark}
that empowered [minorities would]{.mark} automatically help cre[ate a
Russia more in sync with Western norms. Ethnic minorities are not more
inclined toward democracy]{.mark}, human rights, good governance, and
pro-Western liberalism than the Russian ethnic majority.]{.underline}

Russia's main cultural divide is not between ethnic Russians and
minorities but between big urban areas and the rest of the country:
industrially depressed regions, rural provinces, and ethnic republics.
Russia's big cities have shown growing signs of civil society engagement
and grassroots pluralism over the past decade---even if this trend has
been repressed, especially since the outbreak of the war in Ukraine.
Rural residents and minorities, in contrast, tend to be more
conservative in terms of cultural mores and more supportive of an
authoritarian and paternalistic regime. Muslim minorities are more
likely to oppose abortion rights, liberal divorce laws, equality in the
workplace, and LGBTQ rights. They are also more likely to condemn NATO
and the United States for their policies in the Middle East.

[[Advocating for Russia's collapse is an **erroneous strategy**]{.mark},
founded on a lack of knowledge of what ties together Russian society in
all its diversity. More important, [such]{.mark} a [strategy]{.mark}
also [fails to consider]{.mark} that [a Russian breakup would be
**disastrous** for international security]{.mark}.]{.underline} [A
[collapse]{.mark} would [generate]{.mark} **several [civil
wars.]{.mark}** New statelets would [fight]{.mark} with one another
[over borders and economic assets]{.mark}. Moscow [elites, who control a
huge nuclear arsenal]{.mark}, would [react with violence]{.mark} to any
secessionism. The security services [and]{.mark} law enforcement
agencies would [crush]{.mark} any [attempts at democratizing]{.mark} if
that meant repeating the Soviet Union's dismemberment. Although
[decolonization]{.mark} sounds like liberation, in practice it
[would]{.mark} likely [push]{.mark} the whole of [Russia and ethnic
minority]{.mark} regions even **[further]{.mark}
[backward]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[To be sure, [Russia's breakup is **unlikely**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
the aftermath of Putin's disastrous war, however, the regime will
nonetheless face growing pressures to decentralize. The best outcome
would be for local self-government---inscribed in the Russian
constitution but scrapped by Putin---to become a reality. This
refederalization of Russia would be possible only if accompanied by a
national reckoning on the legacy of Russia's colonialism. This
reappraisal would be important for ethnic Russians as well as for
minorities. But as in the United States and Europe, that societal
transformation will take decades. It is worth pursuing, however. Only a
Russia that decentralizes politically and culturally can reform itself
from the inside out.

#### All scenarios for internal collapse are bad (could also be recut as UQ for collapse now)

**Bohdanov 25** \[Yurii Bohdanov is a strategic communications

inevitable --- and what comes next," 01/17/2025,
https://euromaidanpress.com/2025/01/17/why-russias-collapse-is-inevitable-and-what-comes-next/\]

Anything can detonate this system at an unpredictable moment. [But [what
are]{.mark} the [possible scenarios]{.mark}? [There are]{.mark}
basically [three]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Power transition and]{.mark} gradual (or rather quick)
[democratization]{.mark}]{.underline}. [I [**don't see** prerequisites
for democratization]{.mark} and significant changes [in Russia]{.mark}
without implementing the second or third scenarios in some form. Because
the [democratization]{.mark} of even the Russian heartland **[requires a
serious elite reset.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

"Yugoslav scenario." Like the former Yugoslavia, [[Russia has]{.mark} a
critical mass of [factors that could cause]{.mark} its
[collapse]{.mark}: [economic collapse]{.mark}, [ethnic]{.mark} and
religious [conflicts]{.mark}, [weak]{.mark} power [legitimacy]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} regional [separatism]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, Russia
doesn't have regions capable of independent statehood like Slovenia or
Croatia. [Instead, [the country risks]{.mark} plunging into [chaos
with]{.mark} a [**prolonged political crisis and many
conflicts**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"Warlord Era" scenario[. What's happening [now in]{.mark} the
[Russia]{.mark}n army and society [resembles]{.mark} China at the
beginning of the 20th century---the [warlord era]{.mark}]{.underline}.
After the 1911 revolution, the country split into regional clans, each
controlling its territory. [Today, [Russia]{.mark} already [has]{.mark}
the ingredients for the last one: [private armies]{.mark} forming in
regions, [armed]{.mark} bitter [veterans]{.mark} in the rear, [and elite
struggle.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[This "warlord scenario" looks increasingly probable as Moscow's grip
loosens. [The result: **widespread violence and lasting
instability.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

History shows that systems like Russia's usually collapse from within,
especially during long wars. This has happened before -- look at the
USSR or Portugal. [[No]{.mark} temporary [fixes]{.mark}, like pausing
the war or lifting some sanctions, [can save a system that's **breaking
down.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

The basic problem is that Russia must choose: abandon imperial ambitions
or disintegrate. But the changes needed for survival appear beyond the
system's capacity for reform.

### Collapse Bad\-\--Syria 

#### Putin regime collapse cements Syrian instability and erupts conflict

#### Warming is inevitable.

**Trenberth '23** \[Kevin (Scholar at the National Center of Atmospheric
Research in Colorado, and an Honorary Academic in the Department of
Physics); March 21, 2023; "Time to plan for the climate change
inevitable,";https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en/news/2023/03/21/Time-to-plan-for-the-climate-change-inevitable.html\]//lol

We clearly need to plan for the consequences of other nations' actions.
The United States Senator from Utah, Mitt Romney, evidently sees no
chance we'll be able to curb global warming anytime soon. Romney, one of
the few Senate Republicans to consider climate change an urgent threat,
said that [policymakers should focus on adapting to hotter
conditions]{.underline} -- [because]{.underline}, he argued, [both
[temperatures and greenhouse gas]{.mark} emissions [will **continue to
rise** for **at least the next 20 years**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Many experts took exception to this but the United States alone is on
track to cut emissions by 32 to 42 percent below 2005 levels by
2030]{.underline}, according to Rhodium Group modelling. [Many
[forecasts predict emissions dropping in the coming years, but even if
that **slows warming**]{.mark}]{.underline} (unfortunately, that is a
big "if") [[it's **not going away**]{.underline}]{.mark}. "[[If]{.mark}
we get [all our CO2 emissions]{.mark} to [zero, the **world doesn't cool
down**]{.mark}]{.underline},\" [said]{.underline} my colleague Zeke
[Hausfather, of the Breakthrough Institute]{.underline}. "It just stops
warming, at least for three or four centuries." So we can determine how
much warmer it gets, based on how quickly we cut emissions." He went on
to say that Romney is right that, at a minimum, we're going to have to
deal with the situation we have today and take steps to adapt to that.
Roughly [one-quarter of the expected drop in US emissions is
attributable to its Inflation Reduction Act]{.underline}, which directed
about US\$370 billion to climate programmes. But as I have previously
argued, far too much is misdirected toward carbon capture and offsets
rather than the actual cutting of emissions.

### Warming Good\-\--Trade

#### [Thousands]{.underline} of ships can sail through the Arctic by [2050]{.underline} because of warming. That reduces [cost]{.underline}, [distance]{.underline}, and [avoids]{.underline} dangerous waters while boosting trade.

The **Economist '25** \[January 23, 2025; "The Arctic: climate change's
great economic opportunity An enormous prize is on offer. When might it
be grasped?" https://archive.ph/Prosb#selection-847.0-851.56\] //lol

Such benefits may pale in comparison to those offered by new shipping
routes. To grasp how climate change may transform them, see the map
below. [[Melting ice could open **three paths**]{.mark}. The first,
known as the Northern Sea Route ([NSR]{.mark}), hugs the Russian coast
to connect the Barents Sea with the Bering Strait. A second, dubbed the
North-West Passage ([NWP]{.mark}), runs along the North American Arctic
coastline, from the Beaufort Sea to Baffin Bay. Last comes the
Transpolar Sea Route ([TSR]{.mark}), which runs over the North
Pole.]{.underline}

![A map of the world AI-generated content may be
incorrect.](media/image2.png){width="3.317361111111111in"
height="2.563636264216973in"}

[[All three could **shorten trips**]{.mark} between Asia, North America
and Europe, [which account for]{.mark} most [shipping, **saving on fuel
and wages**]{.mark}. They could [also **avoid chokepoints** such]{.mark}
as the [Panama and Suez]{.mark} canals, [which are busy, charge fees
and]{.mark}, in the case of [Suez, link to dangerous
waters]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Exactly when these promises might be fulfilled depends on the route. The
NWP, which runs through Canada's Arctic Archipelago, consists of narrow,
winding channels. It is melting more slowly than the NSR. Although it
stretches 1,500km, it has only one deep-water port and lacks emergency
facilities. Canada claims the NWP is in its waters; America and Europe
deem it an international strait. The route is also shallow, limiting the
size of vessels.

[The [TSR]{.mark} dodges many of these problems. It traverses the
Central Arctic Ocean, which is much deeper. It [**avoids territorial
waters**, cooling]{.mark} the [political temp]{.mark}erature.
[And]{.mark} it provides [the **shortest route** from the North Atlantic
to the Pacific]{.mark}.]{.underline} Proponents foresee thousands of
vessels a year shuttling between North America and Asia, stopping en
route at Alaska's Dutch Harbour. Even when the ice is gone, though, the
route will be littered with icebergs, making it navigable only by
icebreakers. [The [vision of **thousands**]{.mark} **of ships** may
[have to wait until 2050]{.mark} or so.]{.underline}

#### Arctic warming and the result of sea-ice reductions is [materially beneficial]{.underline} for maritime interests.

and second lowest SIE were detected by space-borne measurements in 2012
and 2020 (NSIDC, 2020; Witze, 2020). In particular, [it is projected

(Liu & Kronbak, 2010; Schøyen & Bråthen, 2011); as a result, sailing

reduced (Browse et al., 2013; Melia et al., 2016; Schøyen &

routes**]{.mark} has [spurred]{.mark} great [interest]{.mark} from
policymakers and communities]{.underline} (Brigham, 2011; Stephenson
et al., 2011). In practice, the number of ships navigating in the Arctic
has increased since 2010, as has the navigational distance (Eguíluz
et al., 2016; Gunnarsson, 2021; PAME, 2020). Here we use the Chinese
research ships and commercial ships as an example to give an instanced
picture of the operational voyages in the Arctic. All the sailing paths
of research ships and merchant ships (2013--2020) are shown in Figure S1
in Supporting Information S1. In total, 42 merchant voyages operated via
the NSR from 2013 to 2020[. The research ship, Xuelong (red solid line),
has successfully sailed through the Transpolar Sea Route (TSR) with a

#### The Northern Sea Route is [key]{.underline} to [world trade]{.underline}.

[[The NSR provides Russia and China with what they have commonly
sought]{.mark} in the northeastern passage, [and both are
committed]{.mark} to pursuing its development. During the Second Belt
and Road Forum for International Cooperation held in Beijing on 25 April
2019, President Vladimir Putin expressed Russia's interest in evaluating
the possibility of joining the NSR with China\'s Silk Road to create a
global and competitive route connecting East Asia to
Europe.]{.underline}

[These developments indicate the future possibility of Russia and China
gaining collective influence over the NSR, bringing the majority of
world trade under their control. Considering the growing ties between
China and Russia, [their]{.mark} likely [influence over the NSR
raises]{.mark} bigger [concerns for the West]{.mark} about China's
growing global dominance and economic hegemony.]{.underline}

The NSR development plan is also perceived as one of
Russia's strategies to bolster its economic performance despite Western
sanctions. Coupled with de-dollarisation, controlling a significant
trade route would enable Russia to earn tax revenue since the route
passes through Moscow's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ).

The NSR is equally crucial for Japan and South Korea as it is for China
and Russia. Both countries are the leading industrial nations of the
East, increasingly using the northeastern passage. Despite the
scepticism of Western shipping companies, Denmark-based shipping firm,
A.P. Moller-Maersk, sent its first container ship along the passage in
August 2018.

[According to expert predictions, the NSR will be ready for use at full
capacity at around 2030, fetching much of the international trade
quantum. The Suez Canal will continue to be used for maritime transport,
especially between the Mediterranean basin, including Turkey and South
and Southeast Asia. The Western response to the growing Chinese and
Russian influence in the new route is yet to be seen. This [ongoing
strategic gameplay]{.mark} in a hitherto unexplored international trade
passageway [raises **uncertainty about the future of world
trade**]{.mark}. It [opens a new **theatre of contestation** between the

#### Trade [reduces]{.underline} conflicts. 

**Lee '11** (Jong-Wha and Ju Hyun, "Does Trade Integration Contribute to
Peace?", September 2011, Economics Department, Korea University, Review

//lol

Table 4 presents estimation results for the logit model for the
probability of conflict. Consider first the results in columns (1)--(3).
Column (1) includes bilateral trade interdependence variable. Column (2)
substitutes the global trade openness for the bilateral trade
interdependence. Column (3) includes both of these trade integration
variables.

Column (1) of Table 4 shows that the model fits the data well,
explaining a substantial part of the variation in the occurrence of
military conflict. Contiguity, bilateral distance, relative military
capabilities, major-powers, joint-democracy, UN voting, oil-exporters,
FTA/RTA and both GATT members dummy variables are individually
significant at the 1% critical level. The significantly negative
estimated coefficient for the bilateral distance and the significantly
positive one for contiguity explain that geographically proximate
countries are more likely to engage in military conflict. The negative
estimate for the relative military capability ratio supports the
contention that states unequally balanced in military capability are
less likely to engage in military conflict. On the other hand, the
positive estimated coefficient on major-power variable explains that
these countries tend to fight more. The negative estimate for joint
democracy confirms that the probability of military conflicts is
significantly lower for dyads composed of states that are more
democratic. The positive estimate for oil exporters means that oil
exporters are involved with military conflicts more frequently. The
estimated coefficient of FTA/RTA dummy is negative that countries in the
same FTA/RTA blocs are less prone to provoke military conflicts.

In column (1), the estimated coefficient on bilateral trade
interdependence is negative and statistically significant at the 5%
critical level (-8.968, s.e.=4.487), indicating that bilateral trade
dependence significantly decreases the probability of military
conflicts. Most importantly, this estimation result holds true with all
other important controlled variables. For instance, distance negatively
affects both bilateral trade and conflict probability.24

In column (2) of Table 4, the estimated coefficient on global trade
openness is negative and statistically significant at the 1% critical
level (-1.692, s.e.=0.427). Dyads of states more dependent on the world
economy tend to have fewer conflicts than those less dependent. Hence,
this result contrasts with that of MMT, in which countries more open to
global trade have a higher probability of war. [Our finding holds quite
[robust]{.mark}, whereas that of MMT does not, in [the larger sample or
more controlling variables]{.mark} as discussed later. As our
specification includes a time dummy variable separately, this
significant coefficient may not be caused by global factors such as the
end of Cold War or peace-promotion efforts of international
organizations that are common to all countries.]{.underline}

[In column (3) of Table 4, in which [both global]{.mark} trade openness
[and bilateral trade]{.mark} interdependence [are included, global
trade]{.mark} openness has individually [significantly negative]{.mark}
effects [at the 1%]{.mark} critical level (-1.661, s.e.=0.429). The
estimated coefficient on [bilateral]{.mark} trade interdependence is
negative, but turns out be [slightly insignificant]{.mark}. Broadly
speaking, the findings of columns (1), (2), and (3) suggest that both
bilateral and global trade dependence promote peace between bilateral
trade partners.]{.underline}

4.2. Quantification and methodological issues

In the logit model, the dependent variable is defined as the log-odds
ratio and the parameters do not correspond to the marginal effects of
independent variables. The marginal effects can be calculated at the
means of regressors by using the estimate. 25 Then, we can compute the
response of the probability of military conflict to a
one-standard-deviation change of each explanatory variable, gauging the
relative importance of each explanatory variable in influencing the
probability of military conflict.

For example, based on column (3) of Table 4, an increase in the
bilateral trade dependence by one standard deviation of 0.007 (starting
from the sample mean) decreases the probability of military conflict by
0.003 percentage point, with other variables held constant. This implies
that if bilateral trade volume increases 10% from the world mean value,
the mean probability of military conflict between the two trading
partners decreases by about 0.16% from its predicted mean probability of
conflict evaluated at the means of explanatory variables. On the other
hand, an increase in the global trade openness (by one standard
deviation, or 0.370) decreases the probability of military conflict by
0.037 percentage point, other variables remaining constant. [This
implies that an [increase in global trade openness by 10%]{.mark} from
the world mean value [decreases the probability of]{.mark} the dyad\'s
military [conflict by]{.mark} about [7.7 %]{.mark} from its predicted
mean of conflict evaluated at the means of explanatory variables.
[Hence, global trade openness]{.mark}, compared with bilateral trade
dependence, [has]{.mark} a relatively **[large impact on the probability
of conflict]{.mark}** with the bilateral trading partner.]{.underline}

### Warming Good\-\--Russian Economy

#### Russia's economy is fragile.

After three years of militarizing the country, Russia's economy is
cooling. According to official forecasts, [economic [growth]{.mark} is
expected [to slow]{.mark} this year [from **4.1% to
2.5%.**]{.mark}]{.underline} More conservative forecasts, such as those
of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Bank of Russia,
anticipate a pace of around half that.

So far, this has amounted to soft landing, rather than a crash. While
the [[economy is in]{.mark} orderly **[decline]{.mark}**]{.underline},
the war effort will remain fully financed. The Kremlin views the
military-industrial complex as the primary driver of the economy, and
its [[financing is a **top priority**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Lower
inflation would remove]{.mark} some of the [pressure on]{.mark} military
[expenses]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, a drop in labor demand and
subsequently a slower pace of salary growth would allow the army to
attract more contract soldiers for less money ---the Russian state
currently pays around \$22m a day in sign-up payments alone.

The economy is not demobilizing; it is just running out of steam.

That said, [[a **drop** can easily become a
**dive**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Bad decisions by policymakers, a further

The Kremlin has grown confident that its risk-taking usually achieves

with the West to achieve its strategic aims. That attitude of risk
tolerance rests on a perception that Russia and the current regime do

Ukraine's cooperation with Euro-Atlantic partners. In reality, the most

### AT: Birth Rates Add-On

#### There are alt causes to birth rates.

**Sasser '21** \[Jade S. (writer and educator whose work focuses on
gender, climate justice, and reproductive politics); June 7, 2021; LA
Times; "The complex link between population decline and a warming
planet,";
https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-06-07/population-growth-fertility-declining-climate-change\]//lol

[It's time to [stop blaming overpopulation for our environmental
woes]{.mark}]{.underline} and start looking at the factors that really
matter --- resource consumption and toxic exposure as population growth
and fertility rates show downward trends.

U.S. and global populations are both growing at slower rates. In the
period between July 2019 and July 2020 alone, the growth rate in the
U.S. had slowed to just 0.35%, the slowest recorded since at least 1900.
And this isn't just because of a COVID-19 baby bust. Rather, this is a
part of a long-term trend, decades in the making.

In 2010, births had fallen 3% from 2009, according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention. The total fertility rate (number of
births over the course of a woman's lifetime) was down 4%, and teen
birth rates fell 10%, the sharpest drop in more than 70 years.

Global population growth, which has stabilized, is also heading toward
decline. [According to the United Nations population division, the
[world's population is growing]{.mark} at a [slower]{.mark} rate than at
any time since 1950, and will level off around 2100.]{.underline} A 2020
study suggests that global population will probably reach its peak four
decades earlier than what the U.N. projected.

In any case, age structures are already shifting markedly. As of 2018,
people over 65 outnumbered children under 5 worldwide for the first time
in history. While the pace is uneven, the population story of the 21st
century will be one of global graying, rather than significant global
growth.

Yet despite slower growth, we are still speeding toward environmental
catastrophe. At the same time that human fertility rates were
decreasing, greenhouse emissions all over the planet were rising
steadily, hitting record levels in 2019. A U.N. report on global
greenhouse gas emissions found that the richest 1% of people on Earth
were responsible for more than double the number of greenhouse gas
emissions of the poorest 50%. To comply with the Paris agreement, the
ultra-rich would need to decrease their greenhouse gas emitting
behaviors by a factor of 30.

[**The [link between population and climate]{.mark} change [is
broken]{.mark}.** In both China and the U.S. --- the top two emitters of
greenhouse emissions --- the average woman gives birth to 1.6 children
in her lifetime, below the 2.1 children needed to replace herself and
her partner.]{.underline}

[There are [**several factors** behind the fertility slowdown]{.mark}.
Women's voluntary access to [contraceptives]{.mark} --- alongside other
reproductive [health services]{.mark} --- plays a major role, as well as
formal [education and opportunities to earn an income outside of the
house]{.mark}hold.]{.underline}

But researchers also point to another concern: [[Infertility may be on
the rise]{.mark}. The rate of [pregnancy loss due to miscarriage,
stillbirth and ectopic pregnancy]{.mark} among women of all ages in the
U.S. [has been rising]{.mark} at a rate of 1% per year between 1990 and
2011.]{.underline} Further, an analysis of 185 studies looking at close
to 43,000 men between 1973 and 2011 found that total sperm counts had
decreased by almost 60%. Researchers aren't entirely certain why --- and
some researchers question whether sperm count even impacts fertility
---but some evidence demonstrates that exposure to hormone-disrupting
chemicals, like phthalates (which make plastics flexible), play a role
in disrupting fertility.

There's something else to consider: [[Young people are simply having
less sex]{.mark}, with fewer partners, and are having sex for the first
time at later ages compared with earlier generations.]{.underline} Some
applaud this change for reducing teen pregnancy in the U.S. But it could
signal a waning desire to have children on a warming planet.

### AT: Disease

correlated]{.mark} with all climate variables.]{.underline} This is
despite the fact that these [[diseases share the same
vector]{.underline}]{.mark}, Ixodidae ticks, for which increased
[[annual temperature is reported to increase incidences of tick
bites]{.underline}]{.mark}21 and the geographic range of ticks, due to
the expanded geographic range of associated vegetation communities and
mammals caused by a prolonged vegetation period22. [[Some
researchers]{.mark} have also [argue]{.mark}d that the reporting of
[tick bites]{.mark} has [increased due to increased public
awareness]{.mark}]{.underline}23 [[and more time spent
outdoors]{.underline}]{.mark}24, along with the changes in climate, tick
bites, and tick range. The decreasing trend in TBE incidence, [in spite
of these tick increase drivers, [might therefore be explained by other,
counteracting societal factors]{.mark}, such as vaccination rate
co-increasing along with the climate and disease-report
factors.]{.underline}

### Impact\-\--Warming\-\--T/L

These [[crises are **interlinked** and **act in
synergy**]{.underline}]{.mark}, that is, [[they **reciprocally
strengthen** one another]{.underline}]{.mark}. And precisely because
they are interdependent and reciprocally strengthening each other, it is
senseless to deal with them separately. It makes no sense, for example,
to understand the current pandemic as simply a health emergency,
isolated from other ongoing crises. Most of all, we should not classify
these crises in an hierarchical order according to the greater or lesser
risk they represent for humanity, as proposed by the University of
Cambridge's Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, or by Toby Ord,
from the University of Oxford's Future of Humanity Institute, in his
recent book, The Precipice. Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity
(2020). The considerations proposed by these centers and researchers are
very momentous. But they start from the false premise of dividing the
risks to which humanity and other species are increasingly exposed into
existential and non-existential ones. That dividing line does not exist.
An existential risk is, frequently, made from a conjunction of crises
that, separately, do not existentially threaten humanity but that,
together, have the potential to do so. Will Steffen and colleagues
(2018), for example, explored [the **[possibility]{.mark}** that "a
[**2°C warming** could **activate**]{.mark} important **[tipping
elements]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, **[raising]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the
**[temp]{.mark}erature [further]{.mark}** to activate other tipping
elements [in a **domino-like cascade**]{.mark} that could take the Earth
System to even higher temperatures]{.underline}". That **[[domino
effect]{.underline}]{.mark}** can [[lead]{.mark} us [to]{.mark} what the
authors called a **[Hothouse Earth]{.mark}**]{.underline}, that is, [[a
**largely uninhabitable planet**]{.mark}.]{.underline} And, once again,
there is no clear dividing line between a planet that is largely
uninhabitable and one that is completely uninhabitable for humans and
innumerous other species. A chapter written for the English edition of
my book, Capitalism and Environmental Collapse (2020), titled "Climate
Feedbacks and Tipping Points", shows how devoid of meaning we find the
question, frequently debated in the scientific community and taken up
again by Toby Ord, of the probabilities of a warming capable of
generating what is called runaway climate change. Let us remember what
is truly at stake here for the destiny of humanity. [The **runaway
global warming [conjecture]{.mark}**]{.underline}, feared by a growing
number of scientists (but still rejected by the IPCC3 ), [would be able
to [lead]{.mark} the **[Earth toward conditions that prevail]{.mark}
today on [Venus]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This conjecture may be
interesting from a strictly scientific point of view, but [it is
[**totally useless** **from**]{.mark} the **[p]{.mark}oint [o]{.mark}f
[v]{.mark}iew [of]{.mark}** the fate of [**animals** and **forests**,
because both]{.mark} would [**cease to exist** under conditions]{.mark}
that are much [less extreme]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yangyang
[Xu]{.underline} and Veerabhadran [Ramanathan]{.underline} (2017)
[have]{.underline} thus [categorized the risks implicated at **[three
levels of global warming]{.mark}**: **"\>1.5°C** as dangerous;
**\>[3°C]{.mark}** [as catastrophic]{.mark}; and **\>[5°C]{.mark}** [as
**unknown, implying beyond catastrophic**]{.mark}, including existential
[threats]{.mark}]{.underline}". As established by a host of the
next-generation climate models, [a global [warming of
**5**]{.mark}**°C** **or even more** above the pre-industrial period
**[can be reached by 2100]{.mark}**, because "**[even if coal use
doesn't rise]{.mark}** in a catastrophic way, 5°C of **[warming]{.mark}
could [occur by]{.mark} other [means, includ]{.mark}ing thawing
[permafrost]{.mark}**]{.underline}" (TOLLEFSON, 2020, p. 446).
Understanding this, one can ask if the current pandemic represents an
existential or a non-existential risk for humanity. Having now, through
the month of June, infected more than eight x million people and reaped
more than 450 thousand officially confirmed fatalities (according to
preliminary estimates, the real numbers are much higher), the current
pandemic has not yet shown signs of cooling off. Nothing lets us state
that the worst is over. In fact, it continues accelerating in the
southern hemisphere, and can still affect a quarter billion people in
Africa alone, according to a recent model (McVEIGH, 2020).

[What is the]{.underline} plain, [literal]{.underline}, non-gilded
[meaning of the phrase 'climate change']{.underline} and [what is the
real face of climactic transformation]{.underline}? Of course, [the
original and authentic sources for what is happening to the planet's
climate and biosphere are climate scientists]{.underline}. Yet, at least
partly due to the above mentioned reasons, [the corporate war on truth
and the reputation management of climate scientists]{.underline}, the
vast **[[majority of]{.mark} the global general [public has no
clue]{.mark} on what is in store for mankind]{.underline}**. Although
there is a growing number of people who are aware of the threat,
[**[only a handful]{.mark}** is [**aware** **of**]{.mark} its
**[existential magnitude]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. **[Most climate
models]{.underline}**]{.mark} [have been **[project]{.mark}ing
hypothetical future scenarios as a [linear]{.mark} continuation of
past** and present **[trends]{.mark}** and thereby **[predicted
slow]{.mark}, gradual [changes]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For example, a
given amount of additional CO2 shall lead to a proportional amount of
heating and sea level rise. **[[Complex natural
systems]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, [**[do not]{.mark}** typically
**[behave like that]{.mark}** on the long run: changes might be
**exponential** and/or **non-linear**]{.underline} (i.e. **[sudden and
drastic]{.underline}**), with a number of qualitatively different
alternative outcome states. First of all, [**[modifying one
variable]{.mark}** could [**trigger** **positive feedback
loops**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, [increasing the amount of
CO2]{.underline} in the atmosphere [leads to **[heating]{.mark}**, which
**[leads to]{.mark} an increased [melting]{.mark} of polar
[ice]{.mark}**, and because **[less ice reflects back less
energy]{.mark} from the Sun, [heating is]{.mark} further
[increased]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Note that such a feedback is
independent of the amount of CO2, which serves merely as an initial
trigger. **[Heat itself can serve as a further trigger]{.underline}**,
for example [for the **release of [methane]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which
[is a **vastly more potent** greenhouse gas than CO2]{.underline} and
[**its emission [increases naturally]{.mark}** [with higher
temperatures]{.mark}]{.underline} (YvonDurocher et al., 2014).
[[In]{.mark} such a [complex system]{.mark} as the **biosphere [domino
effects and feedback loops create]{.mark}** a **highly complex
structural [interdependence across]{.mark}** various **[scales]{.mark}
and levels**]{.underline} (Rocha et al., 2018). [Subtle changes can
escalate exponentially and irreversibly]{.underline}. [When]{.underline}
a subsystem [reaches a **point of no return**, or a so called tipping
point, **reversing** **processes** that triggered the flip **will not
bring back** the **original state**]{.underline}. Intriguingly, [[the
**larger ecosystems** are, the **faster they
collapse**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Cooper et al., 2020), perhaps partly
because [[they]{.mark} can [take more stress]{.mark} than smaller ones,
[but]{.mark} at their **[tipping points]{.mark}** they **[burst
suddenly]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The [particularly alarming implications
is the **[robustness]{.mark}** and **resilience** [of Earth's
**biosphere**]{.mark} as the largest ecosystem **[might be
illusory]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Extremely concerning is the
possibility that **the Amazon rainforest could already have passed its
tipping point**]{.underline} (De Bolle, 2019). Tipping points for [**ice
sheets**, **rainforest**, **permafrost melting, or oceanic currents
could trigger each other**]{.underline}, in a tipping cascade that could
[[lead to a "Hothouse Earth]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Steffen et al.,
2018). Such a [chain reaction of local transformation]{.underline} of
subsystems necessarily [leads to a rapid and irreversible shift in the
system as a whole]{.underline} -- and it could be [triggered even by a
single major tipping point]{.underline}. [The system is not
linear]{.underline} in the sense that tipping points can trigger each
other, therefore '[climate change' might be a rapid sudden and
irreversible event instead of a gradual shift]{.underline}. [[Chaos
theory]{.underline}]{.mark} (Gleick, 2011), which is based on non-linear
equations, [[emerged]{.mark} partially [from]{.mark} [weather
science]{.mark} and provided elegant descriptions of a broad range of
natural phenomena. It has convincingly [shown]{.mark} that [complex
systems]{.mark} tend to [find]{.mark} and sustain equilibrium around
mathematical attractors]{.underline}. [They are able to tolerate quite
considerable changes to one variable or another]{.underline} and
maintain their stable state. [However, at a non-predictable but well
expectable moment, in an instant of deterministic chaos, a [minor
modification]{.mark} can [induce]{.mark} a state change, [where]{.mark}
the [system as a whole moves]{.mark} to another attractor
state]{.underline} (Figure 2). This is the reason why systems ecologists
are arguing for a kind of natural conservation that tracks and saves the
functioning of ecosystems as wholes instead of counting species (e.g.,
Ortiz & Jordán, 2021). Saving at least those systems that are possible
to do so, because the extinction of a plethora of species is already
irreversibly accelerating: extinction breeds extinction (Ceballos et
al., 2020). Earth's climate system, as a complex, natural, deterministic
yet chaotic system with variables perhaps in the tens of thousands, has
two main attractor states: the icehouse (glacial or Ice Age) and the
hothouse state. The shift between the two might be influenced by the
fluctuating position of Earth relative to the Sun -- the tilt of its
axis, its distance from the Sun, etc., i.e. the Milankovitch cycles --
but it is determined by atmospheric processes, since there is no direct
correspondence between Earth's position and the four Ice Ages or even
the glacialinterglacial shifts. By pumping CO2 in the atmosphere
continuously human kind will eventually shift Earth into its hothouse
state. If the climate of the planet finds its hothouse equilibrium, it
is likely to resist a shift back to the icehouse state just as
stubbornly as it has been keeping its balance in the past decades (e.g.,
oceans swallowing excess CO2 and heat). Not only mankind but the entire
homo lineage evolved during the current Ice Age (Mithen, 1996), which
started about 2.5 million years ago. [**[We]{.mark} simply [have not
evolved to cope]{.mark} with a hothouse Earth** and **might not be able
to adapt to or even survive such a shift** and its
aftermath.]{.underline} [**A non-linear shift into a different
equilibrium affects all systems**: sea level, winds, ocean currents,
precipitation, temperature patterns, etc]{.underline}. There are two
particularly worrying aspects of such a drastic and sudden
transformation. First, [we do not and cannot know how long it takes for
the system the settle on regular weather patterns in the novel
equilibrium]{.underline}. It might take "a blink of an eye" in
geological terms, which, nevertheless [could still mean **thousands of
years of erratic weather patterns, not suitable for agricultural
production**]{.underline}. Second, it's **[anthropogenic nature means
that the shift itself is extremely rapid]{.underline}**. There are
sudden shifts in the fossil record, even dramatic warming events, for
example the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) (Murphy et al.,
2010; Sluijs et al., 2011), when temperatures increased 56 million years
ago, but they did so over a period of 150-200 kya, not 150-200 years. A
few hundred thousand long blink of an eye could allow for animal and
plant life to adapt, but even the PETM lead to a mass extinction, even
in the tropics (Frieling et al., 2017). [A **150-200 year** transition
might **not leave time** even **for** the most ancient **species of our
planet to prepare** for and adopt to the hothouse state]{.underline}
(as, for example, bird and insect populations, including pollinators,
are already collapsing). Mass extinctions have not meant the collapse of
entire ecosystems in the past. [Now **[key ecosystems are driven
towards]{.mark}** a complete **[breakdown by human]{.mark} exploitation

**[collapse of the biosphere]{.mark}** as we know it, [**mass
extinction** of]{.mark} **most [plant and animal life]{.mark}**, but

might be called "alarmist**", but what is the adequate, reasonable risk
probability that is acceptable scientifically, societally, politically,
economically, and existentially, when it comes to the extinction of
mankind]{.underline}? [**[Current models suggest]{.mark}** that we are

(United Nations, 2019). [However, **[there is no guarantee]{.mark} that
[it does not arrive sooner]{.mark}**, which is especially worrying when

### Warming Bad\-\--Agriculture

#### Warming [destroys crop yields]{.underline} and [adaptation can't solve]{.underline}

**Garthwaite** **'25** (Josie Garthwaite, Director of Communications,
Stanford, Doerr School of Sustainability, "Climate change cuts global
crop yields, even when farmers adapt",
https://sustainability.stanford.edu/news/climate-change-cuts-global-crop-yields-even-when-farmers-adapt,
DOA: 7/20/2025, KAoki)

[**In contrast to** previous **studies suggesting that warming could
increase global food production**]{.underline}, the [**[researchers
estimate]{.mark}** that **[every additional
degree]{.mark}**]{.underline} Celsius [[of]{.mark} global
[warming]{.mark}]{.underline} on average will [**[drag down]{.mark} the
world's [ability to produce food by]{.mark}** **120 calories** **per
person** per day, **or [4.4% of current daily
consumption]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

"When global production falls, consumers are hurt because prices go up
and it gets harder to access food and feed our families," said Solomon
Hsiang, professor of environmental social sciences at the Stanford Doerr
School of Sustainability and a senior author of the study. "[If the
**climate warms** by **3 degrees**]{.underline}, [that's basically like
**everyone on the planet giving up breakfast**]{.underline}." That's a
high cost for a world where more than 800 million people at times go a
day or more without food because of inadequate access.

The [[**projected losses for U.S. agriculture** are **especially
steep**]{.underline}]{.mark}. "[Places in the Midwest that are really
well suited for present day corn and soybean production just get
hammered under a high warming future]{.underline}," said lead study
author Andrew Hultgren, an assistant professor of agricultural and
consumer economics at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. "You
do start to wonder if the Corn Belt is going to be the Corn Belt in the
future."

Hsiang and Hultgren worked on the analysis with more than a dozen
scholars over the past eight years as a project with Climate Impact Lab,
a research consortium that Hsiang co-directs with University of Chicago
economist Michael Greenstone, Rutgers University climate scientist
Robert Kopp, and climate policy expert Trevor Houser of the Rhodium
Group.

"This is basically like sending our agricultural profits overseas. We
will be sending benefits to producers in Canada, Russia, China. Those
are the winners, and we in the U.S. are the losers," said Hsiang.
"**[The longer we wait to reduce emissions, the more money we
lose]{.underline}**."

Limits to adaptation

The study draws on observations from more than 12,000 regions across 55
countries. The team analyzed adaptation costs and yields for crops that
provide two-thirds of humanity's calories: wheat, corn, rice, soybeans,
barley, and cassava.

[**[Previous studies failed to account for realistic
adaptation]{.mark}** by farmers]{.underline}, assuming either "perfect"
adaptation or none at all. The new study is the first to systematically
measure how much farmers adjust to changing conditions. [In **[many
regions]{.mark}**, for example, they [switch **crop varieties**]{.mark},
**[shift planting]{.mark} and harvesting [dates]{.mark}**[, or **alter
fertilizer**]{.mark} **use**.]{.underline}

The [team estimates **these [adjustments offset]{.mark} about [one-third
of]{.mark} climate-related [losses]{.mark}** in 2100 if emissions
continue to rise, but the rest remain]{.underline}. "[Any level of
warming, even when accounting for adaptation, results in global output
losses from agriculture,"]{.underline} said Hultgren.

[The **[steepest losses occur at]{.mark} the extremes of the
agricultural economy**: in [**modern breadbaskets** that now
enjoy]{.mark} some of the **world's [best growing
conditions]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and in subsistence farming
communities relying on small harvests of cassava. In terms of food
production capacity from staple crops, the **[analysis finds yield
losses]{.mark} may [average 41]{.mark}% [in]{.mark} the [wealthiest
regions]{.mark} and 28% in the lowest income regions** by
2100.]{.underline}

The modeling points to a 50% chance that global rice yields will
increase on a hotter planet, largely because rice benefits from warmer
nights, while the odds that yields will decline by century's end range
from roughly 70% to 90% for each of the other staple crops.

Higher emissions bring bigger losses

[With the planet already about 1.5 degrees Celsius hotter than
pre-industrial levels, [farmers]{.mark} in many areas [are experiencing
**longer dry spells**]{.mark}, **unseasonable [heat waves]{.mark}**[,
and **erratic weather**]{.mark} that [**undermines yields**, **even
when**]{.mark} **inputs like [fertilizer]{.mark} and water
[improve]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

The [study modeled future crop yields under a range of warming and
adaptation scenarios. By 2100,]{.underline} the [authors estimate
**global crop yields would be dragged down 11%**]{.underline} if
emissions rapidly plummet to net zero [**and 24% if emissions continue
to rise unchecked.**]{.underline}

In the shorter term, by 2050 the authors estimate climate change will
drag global crop yields down by 8% -- regardless of how much emissions
rise or fall in the coming decades. That's because carbon dioxide
emissions stay in the atmosphere, trapping heat and causing damage for
hundreds of years. "If we ignore those long-run damages, we assign an
economic value of zero to them, and that is clearly wrong," Hultgren
said.

Climate change is increasing risks for pregnant women, fetuses, and
newborns, threatening progress in MRH

[**Changing [climate patterns]{.mark}** [have]{.mark} been
**[exacerbating health problems]{.mark} worldwide**]{.underline},
increasing **[heat-related [deaths]{.mark}]{.underline}**, infectious
**[[diseases]{.underline}]{.mark}**, respiratory
**[[illnesses]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and more.150 Recently, there has
been [[rising concern over]{.mark} the growing [impacts of climate
change on **MRH**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} an important element in
tackling the **[existing gendered impacts of climate
change]{.underline}**.

While it has been shown that pregnant women can thermoregulate
effectively in situations of acute, short-term heat stress (typically
several hours or less from exercise in heat, for example),151 it is less
well known as to how effective thermoregulation is with prolonged excess
heat exposure (days to weeks), especially in light of the multi-system
adaptation taking place across pregnancy to accommodate the demands of a
growing fetus.152 Indeed, [**[excess heat exposure]{.mark}** and other
extreme weather events have been **[directly]{.mark} and indirectly
[linked to hypertensive complications]{.mark} of pregnancy**,
**[increased]{.mark} pregnancy [loss]{.mark}**, **preterm births**,
**[severe maternal morbidity]{.mark}**, and more]{.underline} (Figure
4).152,153 Impacts are [**[worse in climate-vulnerable regions]{.mark}**
where **pregnant populations** are [less **able to adapt to increasing
heat**]{.mark} **and other extreme weather events** due to their
[**prevailing socio-economic conditions** and **limited access to
resources**]{.mark}]{.underline}.154 Climate-change impacts to MRH may
also be intergenerational. Some studies associate pregnancy exposure to
extreme weather events with long-term behavioral and cognitive impacts
on offspring.155

However, there is still need for further research. For example, while it
is clear that excess heat exposure results in adverse pregnancy
outcomes, exact pathophysiological pathways have not yet been
determined. Hypotheses include overwhelmed physiological
thermoregulatory systems; decreased placental blood flow resulting in
fetal growth restriction and/or placental abruption; premature labor
resulting from direct heat-related uterine hypercontractility or
enhanced oxytocin and prostaglandin release as well as increased
uteroplacental inflammation and dehydration; and hypercoagulability.156
The exact size and scale of impacts on MRH also remain unclear,
particularly in the most climate-vulnerable regions, where there is a
gap in research. In addition, policies and practices in place to prepare
for these impacts remain insufficient157; for example, only 27 out of
119 NDCs make reference to maternal and newborn health and sexual
reproductive health.158

Recent global movements such as the "Protecting maternal, newborn and
child health from the impacts of climate change" call to action aim to
raise urgency over this matter.159 [**Without effectively addressing**
the direct and indirect impacts from climate change on MRH, **we risk
reversing progress made in the field over the recent
decades**.]{.underline}

To address some research gaps, **[[multiple studies]{.mark} were
[published]{.mark}]{.underline}** last year, such as [on the **impact of
extreme weather events** on MRH in low- and middle-income
nations]{.underline}. Rekha et al.154 explore the [impact of
occupational heat stress on 800 **pregnant [women in India]{.mark}**[.
Results show]{.mark} that **nearly [50% of the women reported excess
heat stress exposure]{.mark}**]{.underline} (beyond wet-bulb globe
temperatures of 27.5°C and 28°C for heavy and moderate workloads,
respectively), [with the **[risk of miscarriage]{.mark} was found to be
[doubled]{.mark} when compared to pregnant women not exposed to heat
stress**]{.underline}. These [results [have strong implications for
tropical nations]{.mark} where millions of working women risk facing
exposure to occupational heat stress]{.underline}.154 In their study of
over **[[400,000 pregnancies in]{.mark} southern
[California]{.mark}]{.underline}**, Jiao et al.,160 **[[showed]{.mark}
significant [associations between]{.mark} long-term [heat exposure and
increases in]{.mark} severe [maternal morbidity]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(unexpected conditions during birth). These health risks were identified
to be higher across patients with lower levels of education and
green-space exposure. Another recent [large cohort study from
Australia]{.underline} also found significant interactions between green
spaces, heat exposure, and odds of preterm births.161 Analyzing urban
green infrastructure combined with social determinants of health adds to
our understanding of prevention options. Bonell et al.157 link heat to
changes in epigenetics and gene imprinting; congenital abnormalities;
and alterations in placental circulation, growth, and function as
pathways of harm that can lead to increased stillbirth risk.

But it is not only heat stress that negatively affects MRH. A
large-scale study across 33 low- and middle-income countries covering
parts of Asia, Africa, and South and Central America found a significant
correlation between gestational flood exposure and increased pregnancy
loss risk, with this risk being more pronounced for women dependent on
surface water, with lower income or education levels. The study also
estimated that, between 2010 and 2020, over 107,500 excess pregnancy
losses annually could be attributed to maternal exposure to gestational
floods across the studied regions, with the highest losses in South
Asia.162

[Through indirect pathways, **[climate change]{.mark} can
[magnify]{.mark} these [direct impacts]{.mark}**]{.underline} (for
instance, **[by [affecting]{.mark} health [systems and
infrastructures]{.mark}]{.underline}**; see Insight 7: Critical
infrastructure under pressure) [and **exposing societal
weaknesses**]{.underline}.153 For example, [increased heat can reduce
**food** and **water availability**]{.underline}. New [mothers have to
travel long distances in the heat to secure water]{.underline}, which
**[delays]{.underline}** their **[recovery]{.underline}**. [Food
insecurity can result in **inadequate nutrition during
pregnancy**]{.underline}, which may [increase the risks of low birth
weight]{.underline} and reduce breast milk production.163 Research from
Kenya and Burkina Faso show that [extreme heat discourages important
behaviors to MRH]{.underline}. Examples include a decline in
breastfeeding frequency, mother-child bonding (e.g., "kangaroo mother
care), traveling for antenatal and postnatal care, and use of mosquito
nets, which is an additional factor increasing exposure to vector-borne
diseases.163,164,165 Impacts are further heightened in migrating
pregnant women as access to reproductive care services and health care
in general is disrupted and can remain absent. [Climate-related
displacement has been [linked to **inadequate**]{.mark} prenatal **care
[visits]{.mark}**[, **lack of**]{.mark} **proper [nutrition]{.mark}**[,
**insufficient rest**, **unsanitary conditions**, **loss of
social**]{.mark} **support [networks]{.mark}**]{.underline}, disrupted
breastfeeding, and insufficient neonatal support.166 Increasing
gender-based domestic violence is also another indirect impact of
climate change on MRH. A study by Zhu et al.167 in three South Asian
countries found that a 1°C increase in the annual mean temperature was
associated with a 4.5% increase in intimate partner violence. Women also
face increased risk of sexual violence during climate-related
migration.153,166

We found [**3,213 empirical case** examples in which **[climatic
hazards]{.mark} were [implicate]{.mark}d in [pathogenic
diseases]{.mark}**. All empirical case examples were **related to 286
unique pathogenic diseases**]{.underline} (Supplementary Table 1), of
[which 277 were aggravated]{.underline} (glossary in Text Box 1) [by at
least one climatic hazard]{.underline} (Fig. 3). Although 63 diseases
were diminished (glossary in Text Box 1) by some climatic hazards, 54 of
them were at times also aggravated by other climatic hazards; only nine
pathogenic diseases were exclusively diminished by climatic hazards
(Fig. 4a and Supplementary Table 1). Hereafter, [we report diseases that
were aggravated by climatic hazards, unless otherwise
indicated]{.underline}. [The **[compilation of pathogenic diseases
aggravated by climat]{.mark}ic hazards [represent 58% of all]{.mark}
infectious [diseases]{.mark} reported to have impacted humanity
worldwide**]{.underline} (that is, out of an authoritative list of 375
infectious diseases documented to have impacted humanity (Methods), 218
were found to be aggravated by climatic hazards; Fig. 4b and
Supplementary Table 1). [We found 1,006 unique pathways in which
climatic hazards, via different transmission types, resulted in cases of
pathogenic diseases]{.underline} (an interactive display of the diseases
is available at https://camilo-mora.github.io/Diseases/). Warming (160
unique diseases), **[precipitation]{.underline}** (122),
**[floods]{.underline}** (121), **[[drought]{.underline}]{.mark}** (81),
**[storms]{.underline}** (71), **[[land cover

**[fungi]{.underline}** (24), **[protozoans]{.underline}** (23),
**[plants]{.underline}** (12) [and **chromists**]{.underline} (9).
Pathogenic diseases were primarily transmitted by vectors (103 unique
diseases), although case examples were also found for transmission
pathways involving waterborne (78), airborne (60), direct contact (56)
and foodborne (50 unique diseases) (Fig. 3). Among all case examples of
pathogenic diseases impacted negatively by climatic hazards, there were
19 general disease names (for example, gastrointestinal infections) that
lacked information on the causal pathogen (Fig. 3 and Supplementary
Table 1); for 116 diseases, there was no information provided on the
transmission pathway (caveats in Supplementary Information 1).

Pathogenic diseases affected by climatic hazards

While [numerous biological, ecological, environmental and social factors
contribute to the successful emergence of a human pathogenic
disease]{.underline}23[, at the most basic level, it depends on a
pathogen and a person coming into contact]{.underline}, and the extent
to which peoples' resistance is diminished, [or the pathogen is
strengthened, by a climatic hazard]{.underline}. We outline [empirical
case examples to reveal how climatic hazards can affect these aspects in
the emergence of pathogenic diseases]{.underline}. Case examples were
grouped under given subheadings for the purpose of better presenting our
results and not as an attempt to outline a contextual model about the
emergence of diseases. We caution that while empirical cases indicate an
effect of climatic hazards on the emergence of pathogenic disease, their
relative contribution was not quantified in this study (caveats in
Supplementary Information 1). The complete list of cases, transmission
pathways and associated papers can be explored in detail at

[Climatic hazards bringing pathogens closer to people]{.underline}

[**[Shifts in the geographical range]{.mark} of species** are **one of
the [most common]{.mark} ecological [indications of climate
change]{.mark}**]{.underline}**24**.
**[[Warming]{.underline}]{.mark}**25 [**and precipitation**
changes]{.underline}25, for instance, were [**[associated with]{.mark}
range expansion of vectors** such as
**[mosquitoes]{.mark}25**]{.underline}, **[ticks]{.underline}**26,
**[fleas]{.underline}**27, **[birds]{.underline}**28 [[and **several
mammals**]{.underline}]{.mark}29 [implicated in [outbreaks]{.mark} by
viruses]{.underline}25, [bacteria]{.underline}25,
[animals]{.underline}25 [and protozoans]{.underline}25, including
dengue25, chikungunya25, **[[plague]{.underline}]{.mark}**29, **[[Lyme
disease]{.underline}]{.mark}**25, **[[West Nile]{.mark}
virus]{.underline}**28, Zika25, trypanosomiasis30, echinococcosis31 and
malaria25 to name a few. [Climate-driven expansions were also observed
in aquatic systems, including cases of Vibrio species]{.underline} (for
example, cholera32), anisakiasis33 and envenomizations by jellyfish34.
[Warming at higher latitudes allowed vectors and pathogens to survive
winter, aggravating outbreaks by several viruses]{.underline} (for
example, Zika, dengue)35. [[**Habitat disruptions** caused by
**warming**]{.mark}, **drought**, **heatwaves**, **wildfires**,
**[storms]{.mark}**, **floods** [and **land cover change**]{.mark} were
also **[associated with bringing pathogens closer to
people]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} **[Spillovers from
viruses]{.underline}** (for example, Nipah virus36 and Ebola37), for
instance, [were associated with **wildlife**]{.underline} (for example,
bats38, rodents39 and primates38) [moving over larger areas **foraging
for limited food resources caused by drought or finding new habitats
following wildfires**]{.underline}. Likewise, [reductions in snow cover
caused by warming forced voles to find shelter in human inhabitations,
triggering hantavirus outbreaks]{.underline}40. [Drought also caused the
congregation of mosquitoes and birds around remaining water sources
facilitating the transmission of West Nile virus]{.underline}41. [Floods
and storms were commonly associated with wastewater
overflow]{.underline}, [leading to the direct and foodborne transmission
of noroviruses]{.underline}16, hantavirus42, hepatitis43 and
Cryptosporidium44. [Warming was also related to melting ice and thawing
permafrost exposing once-frozen pathogens]{.underline}45. For instance,
genetic analyses of an anthrax outbreak in the Arctic circle suggest
that the bacterial strain may have been ancient and emerged from an
unearthed animal corpse as the frozen ground thawed46. [The [successful
emergence of pathogens frozen in time]{.mark} could [be]{.mark} regarded
as **a ['Pandora's box']{.mark},** given the potentially **large pool of
pathogens accumulated over time** and the extent to which these
**pathogens may be new to people**]{.underline}45.

Climatic hazards bringing people closer to pathogens

Climatic hazards also facilitated the contact between people and
pathogens by moving people closer to pathogens.
**[[Heatwaves]{.underline}]{.mark}**, for instance, [by
**[increas]{.mark}ing recreational [water-related activities]{.mark},
have been [associated with]{.mark} rising [cases of]{.mark} several
[waterborne diseases]{.mark} such as Vibrio-associated
infections**]{.underline}47, primary amoebic meningoencephalitis48 [and
gastroenteritis]{.underline}49. [**[Storms]{.mark}, floods [and sea
level rise caused human displacements]{.mark}** [implicated]{.mark} in
cases of [leptospirosis]{.mark}]{.underline}50, cryptosporidiosis51,
Lassa fever52, giardiasis53, gastroenteritis54, Legionnaires'
diseases53, [cholera]{.underline}55, [salmonellosis]{.underline}56,
shigellosis56, [pneumonia]{.underline}57, typhoid58,
[hepatitis]{.underline}58, respiratory disease50 [and skin
diseases]{.underline}50 among others. [Land use changes facilitated
human encroachment into wild areas and created new ecotones that brought
people into closer proximity to vectors and pathogens]{.underline}59,
leading to numerous disease outbreaks such as Ebola60, scrub typhus61,
Queensland tick typhus61, Lyme disease62, malaria63 and so on. [Drought
and heavy precipitation were involved in the movement of livestock to
suitable areas, which in turn led to pathogen exposure and disease
outbreaks]{.underline} (for example, anthrax64, haemorrhagic fever29).
**[[Changes in precipitation]{.mark} and temperature were also [noted to
affect human social gatherings and]{.mark} the [transmissibility of
viruses]{.mark} such as influenza]{.underline}**65 and COVID-1966.
Kappor et al66. suggested that heavy rainfall could exogenously induce
social isolation, helping to explain lower COVID-19 cases after heavy
rainfall; however, increased cases of COVID-19 were associated with
increases in precipitation in Indonesia67, perhaps reflecting different
behavioural responses to extreme rain. Higher temperatures have been
associated with increased COVID-19 cases in some instances67, and
although a mechanism was not outlined, [it is possible that extreme heat
forces people indoors, which can increase the risk of virus
transmission, especially when combined with poor or reduced ventilation;
in a related mechanism, increased transmission of coronaviruses during
cool spells may be related to increased social gatherings, among other
factors]{.underline}68.

Pathogens strengthened by climatic hazards

In addition to facilitating contacts between people and pathogens,
[climatic hazards also enhanced specific aspects of pathogens, including
improved climate suitability for reproduction, acceleration of the life
cycle, increasing seasons/length of likely exposure, enhancing pathogen
vector interactions]{.underline} (for example, by shortening
incubations) and increased virulence.
**[[Warming]{.underline}]{.mark}**, for instance, [[had positive effects
on **mosquito population development**, **survival, biting**]{.mark}
**rates** [and **viral replication**, increasing]{.mark} the
transm**ission [efficiency of West Nile]{.mark} virus**]{.underline}69.
[Ocean warming accelerated the growth of **harmful algal blooms and
diseases**]{.underline} caused by Pseudonitzschia sp70., blue--green
cyanobacteria70 and dinoflagellates70. [[Ocean warming]{.mark} and heavy
precipitation, which reduces coastal water salinity, appear to provide
fertile conditions for Vibrio vulnificus32 and Vibrio
cholerae71]{.underline}, this being a **[[lead]{.mark}ing [explanation
for Vibriosis outbreaks]{.mark} in areas where this disease is
rare]{.underline}**72. In other cases, [warming and intense
precipitation increased food and habitat resources, which caused surges
in rodent populations associated with cases of plague]{.underline}73 and
hantaviruses74. Storms, heavy rainfall and floods created stagnant
water, increasing breeding and growing grounds for mosquitoes and the
array of pathogens that they transmit (for example, leishmaniasis75,
malaria75, Rift Valley fever73, yellow fever15, St. Louis
encephalitis54, dengue75 and West Nile fever76). [Climatic hazards were
also implicated in the increasing capacity of pathogens to cause more
severe illness (that is, virulence). Heat, for instance, was related to
upregulated gene expression of proteins affecting transmission,
adhesion, penetration, survival and host injury by Vibrio spp77,78.
Heatwaves were also suggested as a natural selective pressure towards
'heat-resistant' viruses, whose spillover into human populations results
in increased virulence as viruses can better cope with the human body's
main defence (that is, fever)79,80. Food shortages due to drought were
implicated in reduced bat autoimmune defence, which increased virus
shedding, favouring outbreaks by Hendra virus81,82.]{.underline}

If we can send photos through the air and drive a rover around on Mars,
we can design new ways to live in hot places. You can see it happening
right now in Paris and Los Angeles and many other cities around the
world, where shade trees are being planted and streets painted white to
deflect sunlight. Plant geneticists are developing new strains of corn
and wheat and soybeans that can better tolerate high temperatures. Air
conditioning is becoming cheaper and more widely used. Communication
from public health officials about how to protect yourself during a heat
wave is improving. Clothing companies are developing new high-tech
fabrics to reflect away sunlight and dissipate heat more quickly.

From [**[flooding]{.mark}** in New Zealand and **[wildfires]{.mark}** in
Canada through to **drought** in the Middle East [and **extreme heat**
**across**]{.mark} **the [northern hemisphere]{.mark}**]{.underline},
last year provided a powerful [[demonstrat]{.mark}ion of the **impacts**
of **[climate change]{.mark}**]{.underline}. With [**global
[temperatures]{.mark}** over the **past decade around [1.2C
warmer]{.mark}** [than **pre-industrial levels**]{.mark}]{.underline},
the [impacts]{.underline} already urgently [demand adaptation
investments to avoid mounting losses]{.underline}. However, **[[research
suggests]{.mark} that existing limits and barriers to
[adaptation]{.mark} could [take decades to
overcome]{.mark}]{.underline}**, particularly **[[in]{.mark} vulnerable
[countries]{.mark}]{.underline}**. And while adaptation measures are
gradually being put in place, how might they be further affected by
continued warming? In our new study, published in One Earth, we
investigate how the effectiveness of well-established adaptation options
in relation to water changes as the world warms. Our findings show that
[the **effectiveness of water-related adaptation declines markedly once
warming passes 1.5C** above pre-industrial levels -- from a central
estimate (median) of 90% to 69%, 62% and 46% at 2C, 3C and 4C,
respectively. With the **[implementation]{.mark} of adaptation [already
lagging behind]{.mark}**]{.underline} what is needed, our [findings show
that **[warming beyond 1.5]{.mark}C [needs to be avoided for effective
adaptation]{.mark}** to be possible]{.underline}. Measuring the
effectiveness of adaptation The latest [assessment]{.underline} report
from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ([IPCC]{.underline})
[shows that current adaptation efforts are insufficient to cope with the
increasing severity of warming-related impacts across the
world]{.underline}. [This "adaptation gap]{.underline}" -- the
difference between what is needed to reduce impacts and what has been
implemented -- [is growing, despite increasing adaptation efforts across
all world regions]{.underline}. Where adaptation has been documented,
many benefits -- such as economic gains, better educational outcomes or
infrastructure improvements -- have been observed. However, [we still
have very limited evidence and knowledge about how effective adaptation
is in reducing climate risks]{.underline} -- [arguably the key purpose
of adaptation]{.underline}. This is, of course, an inherently difficult
thing to measure, as [[it is not possible to calculate impacts that have
been avoided because of adaptation]{.underline}]{.mark}. Different ideas
of how to measure adaptation effectiveness have been put forward. In a
very narrow sense, the IPCC defines adaptation effectiveness as the
extent to which an adaptation option is anticipated or observed to
reduce climate-related risk, an approach we use in our study. More
encompassing definitions of effectiveness include the multiple benefits
adaptation can have on a broader set of outcomes, such as human
well-being and equality. [A better understanding of the risk reduction
potential of adaptation is crucial, as climate impacts will become more
severe over the next decades. With limited resources to invest, it is
essential that informed decisions can be made]{.underline}. Adaptation
as the world warms In our study, we look at a set of frequently used
adaptation interventions in the water and agricultural sectors, which
are central in current modelling approaches of future impacts. We
collated a set of published case studies distributed across all world
regions. We grouped these options into nine different types of
adaptation interventions -- shown in the map below. For example,
adaptation measures under "changes in cropping patterns and crop
systems" include approaches such as shifting planting dates or
substituting different crops. Measures related to "water and soil
moisture conservation" include approaches such as reduced tilling
(turning of the soil) or introducing mulching (covering topsoil with
plant material). Each case study assesses in detail how a particular
option could be implemented according to specific local conditions and
provides results on its potential to reduce climate risks. In many
studies, different combinations of measures or different specifications
of one measure -- for example, shifting planting dates by 10, 20 or 30
days -- are tested. Where this leads to different levels of
effectiveness, we focus on those specifications that show to be most
effective in reducing risk. Declining effectiveness [To set these case
study results into a global context and align them with important levels
of warming, as in the [IPCC reports]{.mark}, we translate all results
into a representation of adaptation effectiveness at **1.5C, 2C, 3C and
4C**. To represent effectiveness, we assess the proportion of projected
risk that an adaptation option is able to avoid]{.underline}. Our
[findings [suggest]{.mark} a concerning picture: **[adaptation options
are effective]{.mark} in reducing risks in most assessed settings [up to
1.5]{.mark}C of warming, b[ut with increased warming, effectiveness
declines across all]{.mark} options and [regions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
The [central estimate]{.underline} (that is, the median) of [adaptation
effectiveness across all assessed measures at 1.5C is 90%.]{.underline}
[However, this declines to a median effectiveness of 69% at 2C and 62%
at 3C -- a level that current policies could still take warming close
to. At 4C, effectiveness declines even further to a median of
46%,]{.underline} [indicating that less than half of projected impacts
would be avoided under the adaptation measure]{.underline}. The decline
in effectiveness is most pronounced for adaptation options related to
agriculture. For example, changes in cropping patterns and crop systems
show high effectiveness at 1.5C, with more than 50% of data points in
this category, but the share of highly effective adaptation decreases to
14% at 4C. At the other end of the scale, we find that energy related
adaptation (85%), flood risk reduction measures (78%) and urban water
(78%) are the most likely categories to reduce 80% or more of projected
risk across all warming levels. As models do not account for adaptation
limits and barriers, effectiveness in practice is likely to be lower
than under idealised model conditions we assess in our study. In many
cases, adaptation in a 1.5C world comes with potential co-benefits,
where the adaptation option improves conditions more widely, relative to
the baseline of current conditions. For example, shifting from rain-fed
agriculture to irrigation systems produces co-benefits in multiple
cases. Our findings for [adaptation across [**Africa**
show]{.mark}]{.underline} that co-benefits could be substantial in
closing existing adaptation gaps: 54% of assessed studies indicate
potential co-benefits at 1.5C. However, this [[potential declines to
**12% at 4C**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Similarly, in
**[[Asia]{.underline}]{.mark}** the potential for co-benefits
[[declines]{.mark} from around **56% at 1.5C [to 16%]{.mark} at 4C**. In
**[Central and South America]{.mark}**]{.underline}, our [data also
[shows a **shift towards less effective adaptation
outcomes**]{.mark}]{.underline}**.** There is no apparent shift in the
level of co-benefits that could be achieved, though it must be noted
that much fewer studies were available for this region. In some
situations, adaptation becomes not just ineffective in reducing risk,
but it actually aggravates the situation, leading to "maladaptation".
[Africa shows the largest share of maladaptive outcomes at all levels of
warming. For example, intensifying the cultivation of maize and sorghum
in west Africa or earlier planting of maize in Uganda further decreases
yields -- in addition to climate impacts -- rather than reducing
projected risk, even at 1.5C warming.]{.underline}

**[[Models often overestimate]{.mark} the [potential for
adaptation]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Currently, [[**adaptation** is **not well represented** in
**quantitative models**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [**Integrated assessment
models** **provide** **information** on energy system]{.underline}
transition pathways [**to limit warming**, but they [**do not account
for climate impacts or costs** and]{.mark} potentials for
adaptation.]{.underline}

[**Climate impact models assess** the **sectoral effects** of
warming]{.underline} -- for example, on agriculture or the water system.
[Sectoral climate impact models implement selected adaptation
measures]{.underline}, such as irrigation in the agricultural sector,
for example, [but **do not account for [limitations such as water
availability]{.mark}**]{.underline}**.**

But, even more importantly, [**[models do not account for other
constraints]{.mark}** and limits to adaptation, [which have been
documented]{.mark} in practice]{.underline}.

Beside **[[financial barriers]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which are a
fundamental impediment to effective adaptation, there are also
[constraints and [limits related to **governance**]{.mark} **and
institutions**]{.underline}, [**[availability of info]{.mark}rmation**,
[**awareness**, **human capacity**]{.mark} and **[socio-cultural
constraints]{.mark}**. Similarly, adaptive capacity plays an important
role in the ability to implement effective adaptation.]{.underline}

Consequently, where models include adaptation, they likely overestimate
its potential. This is also true for our own assessment: we assess
adaptation in a modelled context, where ideal conditions for
implementing the respective option are assumed. [**[If]{.mark}
additional [adaptation constraints]{.mark}** and adaptive capacities
**[were considered]{.mark}**, the **[extent to which adaptation]{.mark}
can [effectively reduce]{.mark} climate [risks]{.mark} may be [further
reduced]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Infrastructural Maladaptation

The literature is rich with many cases of **[[maladaptation stemming
from coastal areas]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which are [**[faced with the
need to protect against]{.mark}** the effects of **[sea-level
rise]{.mark}**, **salt-water intrusion**, **coastal storms**, and
**other consequences of climate change**]{.underline}. Different [forms
of protection ranging from infrastructure, mangrove planting, managed
retreat, to adopting a discourse of "living with floods" have been
implemented around the world]{.underline}. But most of these choices
come with consequences. [A case from [Fiji]{.mark} [demonstrates]{.mark}
that **[seawalls built to protect people]{.mark}**]{.underline} from
rising sea-levels have actually [[**made** those living]{.mark} close to
them **[more exposed to hazards]{.mark}**]{.underline}, because they
[end up **[preventing]{.mark} stormwater
[drainage]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In part, [seawalls and other
[infrastructure give]{.mark} people a **[false sense of
security]{.mark}** and [**encourage** **them to remain in
places**]{.mark} or **continue with activities** that [make them
**vulnerable**]{.mark} **to climate change** if and [when]{.mark} the
**[infrastructure fails]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In the studied example,
[the [seawalls]{.mark} also [shifted]{.mark} vulnerability to people
elsewhere along the coast]{.underline}, because of changes in sediment
deposits, and [**[created negative environmental consequences]{.mark}**
by [threatening]{.mark} the **health of the [marine
ecosystem]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g., Piggott-McKellar et al, 2020).
Another study in Bangladesh examined these measures from a gendered
perspective, noting that flood control had numerous negative
consequences, including eliminating floodplains that had been an
important income and food source, and reducing the nutrients in the
soils that resulted from the flood water. But, for women, these measures
cut off even more opportunities than for men. Landless, poor women could
no longer find food and resources to sell when these flooded areas
disappeared, reducing their livelihood security (e.g., Sultana, 2010).

of]{.mark} the severity of the [existential threat human kind]{.mark}

language so soft, and [**why are metaphors not persuasive enough** for
the broader public and the political-economic decision makers, when the
collapse of eco-systems, a mass extinction, and the end of organized
human civilization are at stake]{.underline}? There are **[two
particularly [notable reasons]{.mark}]{.underline}**: 1) [**[fossil
fuel]{.mark} interests, [companies]{.mark}** and countries, [have
**engaged in**]{.mark} **one of the [greatest disinformation PR
campaign]{.mark} in history**]{.underline}; 2) [**[the reputation
management of climate scientists often]{.mark} prompts them to [sound
modest]{.mark} and reasonable**, and to [systematically underestimate
dire state of our planet]{.mark}. Fueled by the neoliberal political
infrastructure that favors short-term profit maximization above common
good, which has legalized corporate pressure on political, social, and
societal decision, these fossil interest groups encountered almost no
resistance in the destruction of the life support system of Earth and of
the living habitat of the human race for the next quarterly figures to
look good]{.underline}. The next section is going to show what kind of
[**[language was born out of]{.mark} the [polite]{.mark}, tamed, and
modest [attitudes]{.mark}** behind [which]{.mark} **climate [scientist
retreated]{.mark}**; the deception strategies the [fossil fuel

**politicizing science**]{.mark} by narrowing contexts and
[**constraining factual background**; and]{.mark} **destroying
researchers** and **[buying off politicians]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Then
strategies the scientific community could utilize to deliver a clear
warning to the general public about the consequences of climate
destruction are going to be discussed, followed by what 'climate change'
literally means, and how metaphors could be improved to better describe
it. 4.1. [**[Climate expressions]{.mark} that [create]{.mark} a [false
impression]{.mark}** There is quite a number of rather well-known
**buzzwords**, most of them metaphorical]{.underline}, at least to some
extent, [that are systematically used to describe climate
change]{.underline}. In recent years there have been [attempts to modify
some of these expressions]{.underline}, for example, progressive
journalistic reporting started to use '**[climate
catastrophe']{.underline}** or '**[climate breakdown']{.underline}**.
However, **[even these phrases use a passive voice with rather
problematic connotations]{.underline}**, such as [implying blind natural
forces, no human responsibility, or no chance to reverse the
process]{.underline}. There is some empirical evidence that some climate
metaphors work better than others (Russill, 2011; Volmert, 2014), from
educational contexts as well (Armstrong et al., 2019; Deignan et al.,
2019), [yet **[the real danger]{.mark} at this point [is not]{.mark}
that a [next generation but the current ones]{.mark} do not understand
the enormity of the problem**]{.underline}. Opinion [**[change is
notoriously difficult in adults]{.mark}**,]{.underline} especially for
those with high social status or in leadership positions. [Success is
often taken as justification of beliefs and lends an illusion of
expertise]{.underline} -- one telling example is the "Nobel disease".
Instead of providing a comprehensive collection and analysis of
metaphors in climate address communications, we are going the most
concerning issues of the current terminology via the evaluation of some
of the more popular expressions. 4.1.1. [Climate change vs. global
warming]{.underline} The **[[term 'climate change' and 'global
warming']{.underline}]{.mark}** both have been in use from the 1970s
onwards, but the former gained prominence over the latter (Figure 1),
not only because changes include more than warming but also because
climate denialists. Such a label preference became US government policy
because it sounds less frightening and less specific (Burkeman, 2003).
**[[Neither]{.mark} terms are [particularly suitable]{.mark} for public
communication of an existential threat]{.underline}**, however, [since
[**neither** have **particularly negative
connotations**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The word '[[**change'** **can be
positive** enough to win elections]{.underline}]{.mark} (Levine et al.,
2011), **[[while 'climate change' could mean]{.mark} change [in]{.mark}
many [directions (heating, cooling]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark}
etc.). Such a [**[framing]{.mark}** has **[allowed]{.mark}** **political
operatives to question if there is any change** at all **or to
[claim]{.mark} that [change is]{.mark} a [natural]{.mark} phenomenon**,
and no one should or could resist. However scientifically accurate
'climate change' may be, its vague, passive, and mild tone makes its
adaptation by both the UN and NASA a rather questionable choice. Even
though there is not much figurative in this expression, **its meaning is
loose enough to allow for a multitude of true and false
interpretations.**]{.underline}

In their deflationary account, Sperber and Wilson (2008) suggest that
**[[metaphorical language is not special]{.mark} in any
way]{.underline}**. It **[merely falls on the loose end of language
use]{.underline}**, where inferential mechanisms are not strongly
constrained. [There is a continuum for narrowing and broadening lexical
meaning]{.underline}, which is a means of adjusting word meaning to
local content. [**[Word meaning]{.mark}** by and large **[is
underdetermined]{.mark}**]{.underline}[: [each word **can refer to a
myriad of different things**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in various
contexts]{.underline} (Sperber & Wilson, 1998). **[When we [use words
narrowly, they correspond]{.mark} closely [to]{.mark} their
[encyclopedic]{.mark}]{.underline}** (or lexical)
**[[meaning]{.underline}]{.mark}** (e.g., a '[lake house' is a building
located near a body of water]{.underline} used, perhaps, for
recreational purposes). However, [when we [use
words]{.mark}]{.underline} in a broad sense, or
[**[loosely]{.underline}**, [we **leave**]{.underline}]{.mark} [**the
[inference]{.mark} of what was meant [to the hearer]{.mark}**, which
could be a strategy of making an understatement
purposefully]{.underline} (e.g., ['lake house' could refer to a storage
near a pond or a luxury castle on a cliff]{.underline}). [**Loose
language** use]{.underline}, that is, [constructing meaning by
**broadening**, includes all kind of meaning extensions, such as
**metonymy**]{.underline} ('the greens want regulation'), hyperbole
('the city is melting'), approximation ('it's freezing outside'), and
even metaphor ('hot topics') (Wilson & Sperber, 2002). [An **intriguing
phenomenon** with metaphor]{.underline}, which [[makes it]{.mark}
somewhat unique despite the [**deflationary claims**,]{.mark} is that it
[requires]{.mark} some sort of **[simultaneous
broadening]{.mark}**]{.underline} (including the figurative) **[[and
narrowing]{.underline}]{.mark}** (excluding the literal meaning).
Abstract Conceptual Substitution's solution for this tension is that
narrowing concerns concrete features and broadening abstract properties;
there by it also relieves itself from an encyclopedic and/or literal
ground of meaning. [[The]{.mark} crucial [aspect of meaning
broadening]{.mark} and loose language use that it can be [**employed

The [**[impact of climate change on international supply
chains]{.mark}** will **[cause economies to stagnate]{.mark}** over the
**next four decades**]{.underline}, according to a new Nature study
jointly led by a King's researcher. [[Economies]{.mark} **heavily
[reliant on manufacturing]{.mark}**, such as China and the
US]{.underline}, will be most [**[severely hit by]{.mark}** the supply
chain **disruption caused by [climate impacts]{.mark}**]{.underline}
occurring thousands of miles away. The study, published in Nature, is
the first to chart '[indirect economic losses' from climate change on
global supply chains into regions that would have been less affected by
projected warming temperatures]{.underline}. The report shows [losses in
global GDP]{.underline} as a result of such indirect costs will increase
exponentially over the coming decades. In other words, as climate change
progresses, these effects will account for a greater and greater
proportion of economic losses. Dr. Daoping Wang, co-lead author of this
research from The Department of Geography, School of Global Affairs,
King\'s College London, said: "[The way **[heat stress-related
costs]{.mark} emerge demonstrates how extensive and diverse impacts from
heat stress are propagated through global supply chains**, resulting in
**economic losses to a country or sector that may not be immediately
apparent**]{.underline}." The study [looked at 'direct' climate impacts
[such as]{.mark} the **[health costs from]{.mark} people suffering from
[heat exposure]{.mark}**]{.underline} (including heatwave mortality),
[[and **work stoppages**]{.underline}]{.mark} when it's too hot to work,
[as well as 'indirect' economic disruptions cascading through supply
chains]{.underline}. These previously unquantified disruptions in supply
chains will **[further [exacerbate]{.mark} projected [economic
losses]{.mark}]{.underline}** due to climate change, bringing a
[[projected **net economic loss of**]{.mark} between \$3.75 trillion and
\$**[24]{.mark}.7 [trillion]{.mark}** []{.mark}in adjusted 2020 dollars
**[by 2060]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} depending on how much carbon
dioxide is emitted. [As the **global economy has grown more
interconnected, disruptions in one part of the world have knock-on
effects elsewhere in the world**, sometimes in unexpected
ways]{.underline}. [**[Crop failures, labour slowdowns and other]{.mark}
economic [disruptions in one region]{.mark}** will **[affect]{.mark} the
supplies of raw materials flowing to [other parts of the world]{.mark}**
that depend on them, disrupting manufacturing and trade in faraway
regions]{.underline}. Whilst the [**[economies of small- and
medium-sized]{.mark} developing countries [in South-Central
Africa]{.mark}** will **[suffer disproportionately]{.mark}** from the
**increased mortality**]{.underline} caused by [[**heatwaves**, and
**labour productivity**]{.mark} losses being]{.underline}
[**[felt]{.mark}** most **acutely [in West Africa and Southeast
Asia]{.mark}**]{.underline} - by contrast, [similar sized economies
dependent on international trade, such as Brunei, are more exposed to
indirect losses]{.underline}. This is the first study to analyse and
quantify the propagation of these disruptions from climate change, as
well as their economic impacts. Dr. Daoping Wang said that as the planet
warms, the worse off economically it will become - with compounding
damage and economic losses climbing exponentially the hotter it gets.
[Negative impacts of extreme heat sometimes occur quietly on global
supply chains, even escaping our notice altogether.]{.underline} Our
developed Disaster Footprint model tracks and visually represents these
impacts, underlining the imperative for global collaborative efforts in
adapting to extreme heat. Dr. Daoping Wang, Department of Geography,
School of Global Affairs, King\'s College London The researchers
compared expected economic losses across three projected [global warming
scenarios, called "Shared Socioeconomic Pathways"]{.underline} or SSPs,
[based on low, medium and high projected global emissions
levels]{.underline}. The best-case scenario would see global
temperatures rise by only 1.5 degrees C over preindustrial levels by
2060, whilst the middle track - which most experts believe Earth is on
now - would see global temperatures rise by around 3 degrees C. The
worst-case scenario would see global temperatures rise by a staggering 7
degrees C. All projections paint a grim picture of the future economy,
but the differences in the paths are significant. [**By 2060, projected
economic losses will be nearly five times as much under the highest
emissions path** than the lowest. By 2060, total GDP losses will amount
to 0.8% under 1.5 degrees of warming, 2.0% under 3 degrees of warming
and 3.9% under 7 degrees of warming]{.underline}. The [team also
calculated that supply chain disruptions also get progressively worse
the warmer the climate gets, accounting for a greater and greater
proportion of economic losses]{.underline}. Supply chain [losses will
amount to 0.1% of total global GDP (13% of the total GDP lost) under 1.5
degrees of warming; 0.5% of total GDP (25% of the total GDP lost) under
3 degrees; and 1.5% of total GDP (**[38% of the total GDP lost) under 7
degrees, by 2060]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Project lead Professor Dabo
Guan, from Beijing's Tsinghua University, said: "These projected
economic impacts are staggering. These losses get worse the more the
planet warms, and when you factor in the effects on global supply chains
it shows how everywhere is at economic risk." The direct human cost is
likewise significant. Even under the lowest emissions path, 2060 will
see 24% more days of extreme heatwaves and an additional 590,000
heatwave deaths annually, while under the highest path 104% more
heatwaves and an expected 1.12 million additional annual heatwave
deaths. While tragic on their own, this [**[human toll entails economic
cost]{.mark}s** as well, such as **[increased healthcare]{.mark} costs**
and **[production losses]{.mark} stemming from lost labour**. These
**[impacts will not be evenly distributed]{.mark} around the world**,
and **[countries situated near]{.mark} to the [equator]{.mark} will
[bear]{.mark} the [brunt of climate change]{.mark}, particularly
developing countries**]{.underline}. Global collaboration in adapting to
extreme heat plays an important role in the efficient operation of
global supply chains, which means that everyone will benefit from
collaboration, whether in low latitudes or high latitudes, said Dr Wang.
He said: "The indirect losses of heat stress highlight the need for
countries to strengthen collaboration across global relevant
supply-chains.

Figure 1 shows the projected percentage reduction in global GDP from a
high emissions future (SSP5-8.5) relative to a lower emissions future
(SSP1-2.6), for the three models outlined in section 2.2. Each economic
model is run with and without global weather to determine its impact on
the projections. [Without the inclusion of global weather]{.underline}
(blue line), all three [models project more mild economic losses with a
median loss at 2100 of −28% for the Burke15 model, −4% for the Kahn21
model, and −11% for the Kotz24 model.]{.underline}

[**[Projected losses from]{.mark}** the latter two **[models are more
optimistic]{.mark} than in the original articles**]{.underline}, likely
due to the variations in data and exact assumptions made. [**[Adding
global weather]{.mark} systematically [increases projected economic
losses]{.mark}** independent of the model used]{.underline}. This
increase is dramatic in two of the three models. **[[Median
loss]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the Kotz24 model [**[increases to]{.mark}
−[40% by 2100]{.mark}**[, and]{.mark}]{.underline} to
−**[[86%]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the Burke15 model. The forecasts also
become more uncertain, in the Kotz24 and Khan21 models (demonstrated by
the width of the shading), particularly towards the end of the century,
owing to uncertainty regarding the magnitude of the effect that global
weather has on economic growth. Nevertheless, even with the increase in
uncertainty, the full range of projections lie outside the projected
range of when global weather is not included. [Supplementary material
demonstrates that this effect of global weather is robust to subsample
analysis, the inclusion of CO2 concentrations as an independent
variable, and also controlling for El Nino indices]{.underline}.
[**Median [loss]{.mark} increases [in]{.mark} the [Kahn21]{.mark} model
with the inclusion of global weather, but still [remains mild,]{.mark}
increasing from −4% to −19%**. [This is **unsurprising as**]{.mark}
**the Kahn21 specification in**]{.underline} (2) [**[assumes any degree
of climate change is fully adaptable]{.mark}**. Both the Kahn21 and
Kotz24 models only allow climate change to impact economic growth
through deviations or changes in temperature and rainfall. This implies
that any degree of climate change is fully adaptable in time, and only
the transitions to new climates matter for economic growth]{.underline}.
By including further lags in the model, the Kotz24 model allows this
adaptation to occur more slowly. Kahn21 additionally expresses weather
relative to a norm (in this case, the norm is the average weather in the
last M periods). As the climate worsens, the model allows this norm to
change over time, but even under SSP5-8.5, deviations from this updating
norm remain fairly small. This might explain why damages are smaller in
the Kahn21 model relative to the Kotz24 model. Figure 2 charts the
median projected loss to GDP per capita from SSP5-8.5 (relative to
SSP1-2.6) in 2100 by country, model specification, and whether global
weather ('GW') was included in the specification. [If global weather is
excluded (left column), all model specifications suggest a small impact
on GDP in most countries and in aggregate, with the relative effect of
SSP5-8.5 ranging across countries from −82% (Mauritania) to +139%
(Greenland) in the Burke15 model, −21% to +3% in the Kotz24 model, and
−7% to −2% in the Kahn21 model. **[Some countries in the northern
hemisphere]{.mark}, including Russia, Sweden, and Greenland are
projected to [benefit from warming]{.mark}**[. The **inclusion of global
weather change**]{.mark} **has a moderate impact on the Kahn21 model,
with median losses now ranging between −20% to −17%**]{.underline}
(figure 2, right column). The [same **inclusion [leads to dramatic
increases in]{.mark} projected [GDP loss across countries]{.mark} in the
Burke15 and Kotz24 models, [reaching −97% to −43%]{.mark} in the Burke15
model [and −56% to −11%]{.mark} in the Kotz24 model. An important result
shown in figure 2 is the [implications on the global distribution

In \[24\] for example, [the authors only find evidence that global
warming will impact GDP in poorer countries. **[Adding global weather
to]{.mark} the [models leads to severe losses]{.mark} through much of
the mid-latitudes of the northern hemisphere** in two of the three
models, particularly **Europe**, the **US**, **China** and
**India**]{.underline}. Nonetheless, there remains significant
heterogeneity between countries in 2100 economic losses in both the
Burke15 and Kotz24 models. This heterogeneity may increase with further
modifications to the model specifications. Appendices B and D2 provide
evidence that countries with a warmer climate may have more severe
responses to global average temperature changes than cooler ones. A
promising area of future research would be to extend these three models
with global weather to allow for this type of heterogeneity in slope
coefficients across countries, and explore how it impacts projections
further. 4. Discussion Figure 1 suggests that the current practice of
including only local weather in modelling the macroeconomic impacts of
climate change leads models to systematically underestimate the scale of
the potential losses. Indeed, the magnitude of the losses in the Burke15
and Kotz24 models when global weather is included is arguably more
consistent with the warnings from climate science of the dangers to our
planet from SSP5- 8.5. 4.1. Why does global weather matter so much in
the empirical models? We will briefly discuss several potential
explanations for how global weather impacts economic growth separately
from local weather. [The first is simply that **[in a highly globalised
world economy, shocks to]{.mark} economic [growth]{.mark} in one country
[has spillover effects]{.mark}**]{.underline} (alternatively called
general equilibrium effects) on other countries. The second, proposed in
\[19\], is that [**global [weather is correlated with distributional
aspects]{.mark}** of local temperature that are **important for
determining** **extreme weather events**. These are not captured by
measuring annual average local temperature and cumulative precipitation.
One candidate would be global climate phenomenon like El Nino, yet in
appendix D1 we show that the results for global average temperature are
robust to controlling for multiple El Nino indices. We hypothesise that
global weather may impact the ability of international trade to serve as
a means for economies to insulate themselves from local weather shocks.
In a stable climate during any given year, a number of countries will
experience favourable weather conditions while a number of others will
experience relatively poorer weather. **[If poor weather causes adverse
outcomes such as crop failures or capital loss]{.mark}, that
[country]{.mark} can usually [rely on good conditions in other
countries]{.mark} to import the affected commodities at a competitive
price**]{.underline}**.** When globally averaged weather is particularly
warm or dry in a given year, it increases the likelihood of more
countries experiencing poor weather simultaneously and can have a large
impact on the global supply chains of important commodities and
cost-push inflation (for the case of agricultural commodities, see \[25,
26\] for a similar argument). **[[Future climate change increases the
risk that these conditions]{.mark} will [occur]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(by raising global average temperature), and [accordingly including
global average temperature in the regression allows the model to
incorporate this risk into future projections]{.underline}. Clearly,
[one avenue for future research is to test these hypotheses and
determine the precise mechanisms through which global weather impacts
economic growth]{.underline}. If the impact of global weather on
economic growth is driven by the role of trade and supply chains, we
could expect that the impact is heterogeneous with the reliance of that
country to trade and other features such as sectoral makeup of the
economy. We note that climate science has developed a wide range of
metrics to evaluate changes in the spatial and temporal characteristics
of extreme events, including spatial and temporal compounding of
extremes \[27, 28\]. Linking some of this understanding with economic
growth modelling as well as behavioural modelling (see \[29\]) could
provide deeper insights into how global warming impacts growth

### AT: Warming Good\-\--Trade + Shipping

#### [Arctic Ice melting]{.underline} causes [chokepoints]{.underline} within [trade shipping routes]{.underline}\-\--Multi-Year Ice blocks routes and makes it more unpredictable

MYI = Multi-Year Ice\
NWP = Northwest Passage\
CAA = Canadian Arctic Archipelago

We have provided the first **[detailed [analysis]{.mark} of changes [in
season length along NWP]{.mark}]{.underline}** shipping routes since
2007 at a relevant ship scale and by [using operationally relevant RIO
values to understand navigational risk related to sea ice
change]{.underline}, as opposed to just [examining sea ice change in
isolation of important shipping relevant thresholds]{.underline}. It is
important to identify changes at spatiotemporal scales that are relevant
to ship operations, which, particularly in the Arctic, is often too
coarse to be useful in local navigation decision-making by operators41
and for policy makers to make evidence-based decisions on maritime
safety and risk management. [We **[focus on routes]{.mark} through the
NWP [at a local scale]{.mark}**]{.underline} (at 1 km distances along
the fixed paths) [and at consistent time periods]{.underline} (weekly,
annually, and over 15 years). Our 15-year study period begins when the
Arctic ice regime changed to younger, thinner sea ice, and we
acknowledge that there is considerable interannual variability region
wide. In addition, the availability of ice charts year-round on a
consistently weekly basis means we cannot include years prior to 2007,
so as a result we make no inferences about either past or future
longer-term trends.

Based on Fig. 2, we can affirm that **[[there are several
regions]{.mark} which can be [considered choke points along]{.mark} the
routes of the [NWP]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The [sections with shortest
season lengths in **[Larsen]{.mark}** **and** **[Peel Sounds]{.mark}**
**represent choke points for the southern route**.]{.underline}
Decreases in season length are much more apparent in the **[northern
route, indicating]{.underline}** the choke points within the CAA are at
[**[M'Clure Strait]{.mark}**, **and** **[Viscount Melville
Sound]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There are [regions along the northern
route that have shorter shipping seasons than anywhere along the
southern route throughout the period 2007--2021, which **[indicates
these]{.mark} chokes [are likely]{.mark} more [severe]{.mark} than the
southern route**]{.underline} (Fig. 2; Supplementary Figs. 2, 3, 4).
[Previous studies typically suggest the northern route may become less
risky in the future]{.underline}31,32,42, but we have demonstrated that
[long stretches of the northern route showed statistically significant
decreases in shipping season length over the 2007--2021]{.underline}
time period (Fig. 2).

[[We **attribute** these]{.mark} **shortening shipping seasons and the
[presence of choke points to]{.mark} the [MYI]{.mark} dynamic [and
thermodynamic processes]{.mark} that operate in the CAA and [contribute
to]{.mark} considerable interannual [variability]{.mark} in shipping
season lengths for both the northern and southern routes, with the
former being more nuanced**.]{.underline} Specifically, Arctic Ocean MYI
located in the Last Ice Area (LIA) is exported into the CAA where it is
gradually transported southward through the channels of the CAA with the
regions of Viscount Melville Sound, M'Clintock Channel, and Larsen Sound
acting as a "drain-trap" for MYI28,43. As a result, [the presence of MYI
in the CAA (]{.underline}and inherent NWP) is [cyclic whereby an
anomalous light MYI year is typically followed by a period of
recovery]{.underline}16,43,44. Moreover, [a considerable amount of MYI
forms thermodynamically]{.underline} (i.e. seasonal FYI aging) within
the CAA16,33. The oscillations in Fig. 2 reflect this [process and
highlights the choke point regions within the CAA.]{.underline}

In the future, these **[[choke points]{.underline}]{.mark}** may be more
navigable in some years compared to others based on their historical
variability but their **[[presence]{.mark} will still be [maintained,
and]{.mark} they [will continue to be]{.mark} a [challenge for
transiting ships]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This is because **[[warming in
the Canadian Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**45 [[has not stopped the
process of MYI]{.mark} flowing through the CAA [and **there is evidence
that**]{.mark} **in fact [there has been an increase in]{.mark} Arctic
Ocean sea [ice]{.mark} export [in]{.mark}to [the CAA]{.mark} since
1997**]{.underline}19 that is reflected in the shorter seasons since
2007 in M'Clure Strait and Viscount Melville Sound (Fig. 2). The 2007
start year marks the time period when the Arctic shifted from a MYI
regime to a FYI regime37 and is more representative of the current
lighter ice conditions across the Arctic. Increased temperatures
associated with Canadian Arctic warming certainly contributes to earlier
ice breakup within the CAA19 but this also facilitates the increased
southward transport of MYI from the LIA into the CAA in order to fill
the open water gaps in the drain trap regions of Viscount Melville
Sound, M'Clintock Channel, and Larsen Sound.

#### Warming guarantees [conflict]{.underline} over [chokepoints]{.underline} between [global superpowers]{.underline} and [political instability]{.underline} 

**Meza '22** (Abel Meza, Master\'s Student at Khalifa University,
"Disruption of maritime trade chokepoints and the global LNG trade: An
agent-based modeling approach",

DOA: 7/20/2025, KAoki)

In general, a chokepoint is "a vulnerable point of congestion along a
route" (Bailey and Wellesley, 2017). Referred to the maritime security
trade, the Energy Information Agency (EIA) of the US defines chokepoints
as "narrow channels along widely used global sea routes, some so narrow
that restrictions regulate the size of the vessels that can navigate
through them" (Kosai and Unesaki, 2016). We may define chokepoints as
places where regular sea transit is limited due to their physical
capacity and characteristics, but they cannot be easily bypassed because
there are few alternatives (if any) and the other routes are way longer,
leading to over costs and delays in the supply chain (Rodrigue, 2004).
Chokepoints are the weakest links in our supply web. When they are
broken or disrupted, logistic operations and the economic system suffer
because multiple commercial activities rely on them, leading to
shortages, potential economic crisis, and possibly other emergencies in
a complicated chain reaction (Kitamura and Managi, 2017).

[**[Maritime chokepoints]{.mark}** have been **critical** since **sea
trade developed regionally and globally**]{.underline}. As our world
became more physically interconnected by commercial activities (i.e.,
since the Colonial European journeys), they started to gain more
relevance. The [20th century [provided]{.mark} a **[new level of
strategic importance]{.mark} because human trade developed as never
before**. This time, the world depended on high-density energy resources
like fossil fuels to supply economic activity]{.underline}. That [made
**controlling the regular flow of energy** across these chokepoints a
**matter of continued survival for entire nations** (such critical
dependence intensifies in times of war like the two World Wars). In the
last decades, the control and normal flow of oil provided ground for
diplomatic and military confrontation in some chokepoints and developed
the conceptual risks and possible remedies to trade
interruption]{.underline}. One example was the constant confrontation
regarding control over the Suez Canal during the 1960s and 1970s
(Feyrer, 2021).

Table 1 summarizes the **[[types of incidents affecting]{.mark} the
[normal traffic]{.mark} of chokepoints]{.underline}** (Bailey and
Wellesley, 2017) and provides some examples of these incidents. Some of
them are very recent like the Ever Given blockade; others are historical
like the multiple threats and conflicts in the Strait of Hormuz related
to the Iranian political instability:

  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Beyond these **incidents interrupting the normal flow of commodities,
[some future trends potentially increase]{.mark} the [operational risks
around chokepoints]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The first is that, [as trade
continues to grow, the importance of chokepoints, our dependence, and
their cruciality as transit lanes would probably increase. The case with
NG is significant because if the goal is to turn gas into the dominant
fuel of the future, its secure commercial flow is a must.]{.underline}

The [second is **[climate change]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We [have
already stated how weather events could **[affect]{.mark} chokepoints
[operation]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Further, [climate change influences
slowly but **[irreversible]{.mark}** the [**sea levels**, **wear of
related infrastructure**, **extreme weather events**]{.mark}, and other
**hazards that [pressure our energy demands]{.mark}**, i.e., our need
for more **[congested supply lanes]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This
causality is not just one way. [With extreme weather affecting sea lanes
and passageways, conflicts to get more supplies would increase demand,
operation, and restrictions around chokepoints]{.underline}. This
[[trend]{.mark} could [**intensify the disputes** and **political
instability** in]{.mark} the **[neighboring countries]{.mark} to these
passageways**]{.underline}. In short, [climate change may **trigger
instability in different levels**, stressing operations and security
around chokepoints.]{.underline}

We can add a third trend: [the **[escalation on war]{.mark}** and
political instability]{.underline}. With more intensive maritime trade,
[**increasing climate change**, or even independently of these trends,
security among chokepoints is far from granted. In the last years, we
are watching an **increase** of **conflicts** that may finish to
**[affect]{.mark} the [security on]{.mark} different [maritime
routes]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} For instance, the Ukrainian --
Russian war (Fulwood et al., 2022) may add new struggles [regarding
maritime trade on countries under conflict and their allies, especially
when we consider Russia, the European countries, the US, China and other
countries are all big players on the LNG industry, either exporters or
importers. The **[possibilities of]{.mark}** trade bans, **[trade
restrictions]{.mark} and other mechanisms to penalize other countries
may [lead to more strain on]{.mark} some trading [routes and
chokepoints.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

"The Arctic region has stable and robust environmental and ethical

# Impact\-\--Wipeout

### Turn\-\--Extinction Bad

#### Extinction [permanently]{.underline} eliminates humanity's [unique potential]{.underline} to [alleviate suffering]{.underline} by [confusing]{.underline} the removal of pain with the [destruction]{.underline} of those [capable of overcoming it.]{.underline}

**Moynihan '20** \[Thomas (Researcher at the Future of Humanity
Institute at the University of Oxford); November 19, 2020; "Solve
Suffering by Blowing up the Universe? The Dubious Philosophy of Human
Extinction,";
https://www.globalpolicyjournal.com/blog/19/11/2020/solve-suffering-blowing-universe-dubious-philosophy-human-extinction\]//lol

Thomas Moynihan explores extreme solutions to humanities\' tendency to
threaten others.

[At a time when humans are threatening the extinction of so many other
species, it might not seem so [surprising]{.mark} that [some]{.mark}
people [think]{.mark} that the [extinction]{.mark} of our own species
[would be a good thing.]{.mark} Take, for example, the Voluntary Human
Extinction Movement, whose founder believes that our extinction would
put an end to the damage we inflict on each other and ecosystems more
generally.]{.underline}

Or [there's]{.underline} the South African philosopher David [Benatar,
who argues that bringing people into existence always does them
harm]{.underline}. He recommends we cease procreating and gradually
desert the Earth.

But humans aren't the only beings to feel pain. Non-human animals would
continue suffering without us. So, driven by a desire to eliminate
suffering entirely, some people have shockingly advocated taking the
rest of nature with us. [[They]{.mark} [recommend]{.mark} that
[we]{.mark} actively [abolish the world]{.mark}, rather than simply
desert it]{.underline}.

This disturbing and extremist position goes surprisingly far back in
history.

Benevolent world-exploders

Around 1600 years ago, Saint Augustine suggested that humans stop
procreating. He endorsed this, however, because he wanted to hasten the
Last Judgement and the eternity of joy thereafter.

If you don't believe in an afterlife, this becomes a less attractive
option. You'd have to be motivated exclusively by removing suffering
from nature, without any promise of gaining supernatural rewards.
Probably the first person to advocate human extinction in this way was
Arthur Schopenhauer. He did so 200 years ago, in 1819, urging that we
"spare" the "coming generations" of "the burden of existence".

Schopenhauer saw existence as pain so he believed we should stop
bringing humans into existence. And he was clear about the result if
everyone obeyed: "The human race would die out."

But what about the pain of non-human animals? Schopenhauer had an
answer, but it wasn't a convincing one. He was a philosophical idealist,
believing that the existence of external nature depends on our
self-consciousness of it. So, with the abolition of human brains, the
sufferings of less self-aware animals would also "vanish" as they ceased
to exist without us around to perceive them.

Even on Schopenhauer's own terms, there's a problem. What if other
intelligent and self-conscious beings exist? Perhaps on other planets?
Surely, then, our sacrifice would mean nothing; existence and painful
perception of it would continue. It fell to Schopenhauer's disciple,
Eduard von Hartmann, to propose a more complete solution.

Abolishing the universe

Hartmann, born in Berlin in 1842, wrote a system of pessimistic
philosophy that was almost as lengthy as his impressive beard. Infamous
in his own time, but completely forgotten in ours, Hartmann proposed a
shockingly radical vision.

Writing in 1869, Hartmann rebuked Schopenhauer for thinking of the
problem of suffering in only a local and temporary sense. His
predecessor's vision of human extinction "by sexual continence" would
not suffice. Hartmann was convinced that, after a few aeons, another
self-conscious species would re-evolve on Earth. This would merely
"perpetuate the misery of existence".

Hartmann also believed that life exists on other planets. Given his
belief that most of it was probably unintelligent, the suffering of such
beings would be helpless. They wouldn't be able to do anything about it.

So, rather than only destroying our own kind, Hartmann thought that, as
intelligent beings, we are obligated to find a way to eliminate
suffering, permanently and universally. He believed that it is up to
humanity to "annihilate" the universe: it is our duty, he wrote, to
"cause the whole kosmos to disappear".

Hartmann hoped that if humanity did not prove up to this task then some
planets might evolve beings that would be, long after our own sun is
frozen. But he didn't think this meant we could be complacent. He noted
the stringency of conditions required for a planet to be habitable (let
alone evolve creatures with complex brains), and concluded that the duty
might fall exclusively on humans, here and now.

Euthanasia shockwaves

[Hartmann was [convinced]{.mark} this was the purpose of creation: that
[our universe exists]{.mark} in order [to evolve beings]{.mark}
compassionate and [clever enough to decide to abolish existence
itself]{.mark}.]{.underline} He imagined this final moment as a
shockwave of deadly euthanasia rippling outwards from Earth, blotting
out the "existence of this cosmos" until "all its world-lenses and
nebulae have been abolished".

He remained unclear as to exactly how this goal would be achieved.
Speaking vaguely of humanity's increasing global unification and
spiritual disillusion, he hinted to future scientific and technological
discoveries. He was, thankfully, a metaphysician not a physicist.

[Hartmann's [philosophy]{.mark} is fascinating. It [is]{.mark} also
unimaginably **[wrong]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is [because [he
**confuses the eradication of suffering** with the **eradication of
sufferers**]{.mark}. Conflating [this]{.mark} distinction [leads
to]{.mark} crazy visions of **[omnicide]{.mark}**. To get rid of
suffering you don't need to get rid of sufferers: [you could]{.mark}
instead [try **removing the causes of pain**]{.mark}. We should
[eliminate suffering, **not the
sufferer**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Indeed, [so long as there are intelligent beings around, [there's at
least the **opportunity** for]{.mark} a **radical [removal]{.mark}** [of
suffering]{.mark}]{.underline}. Philosophers such as David Pearce even
argue that, [in the future, **[tech]{.mark}nologies** [like **genetic
engineering** will be able to]{.mark} **entirely phase it out**,
**[abolish]{.mark}ing [pain]{.mark}** [from the Earth]{.mark}. With the
right interventions]{.underline}, Pearce contends, [[humans and
non-humans]{.mark} [could]{.mark} plausibly [be driven by "gradients of
bliss", **not privation and pain.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

This wouldn't necessarily need to be a Brave New World, populated by
blissed-out, stupefied beings: plausibly, people could still be highly
motivated, just by pursuing a range of sublime joys, rather than
avoiding negative feeling. Pearce even argues that, in the far future,
our descendents might be able to effect the same change on other
biospheres, throughout the observable universe.

So, [even if you think removing suffering is our absolute priority,
there is [**astronomical value** in us stickin around. We may **owe it**
to sufferers generally]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Tech Solves

#### [New]{.underline} gene editing technologies like CRISPR [solves]{.underline} animal suffering.

**Pearce '17- \[**Pearce (Co-Founder of World Transhumanist
Association); published 2017- DOA is 7/23/2025; "COMPASSIONATE BIOLOGY:
How CRISPR-Based \"Gene Drives\" Could Cheaply, Rapidly and Sustainably
Reduce Suffering Throughout the Living World"; BLTC;
https://www.gene-drives.com/\]//lol

When a friend of the American composer John Cage asked, \"Don\'t you
think there\'s too much suffering in the world?\", Cage answered, "No, I
think there\'s just the right amount". Few ethicists openly express such
Zen-like equanimity at the suffering of other sentient beings; but until
recently all ecologists shared Richard Dawkins\' assumption of its
inevitability. However, [the living [world is on the brink of]{.mark} a
technical and ethical [revolution]{.mark}]{.underline} - and a major
evolutionary [transition in the development of life]{.underline}.
[[Humanity will]{.mark} shortly [be able to decide]{.mark} the [optimal
level of suffering]{.mark} both for members of our own species and
across the tree of life itself. Not least, [CRISPR-driven gene
drives]{.mark} can [cheaply, rapidly and dramatically reduce
suffering]{.mark} in all species [of sexually reproducing
organism]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Until 21st century biotechnology, the sheer cost, computational
complexity and technical obstacles to tackling suffering in free-living
non-human animals seemed daunting to anyone who cared about nonhumans. A
pan-species welfare state was inconceivable. Cross-species
fertility-regulation via immunocontraception, neurochipping,
GPS-tracking and monitoring, and rudimentary healthcare services would
be prohibitively costly even for large, long-lived vertebrates in human
wildlife parks. [How could we possibly hope to tackle suffering in
marine ecosystems or the Amazon rainforest, short of invoking molecular
nanotechnology and what critics would call Drexlerian
sci-fi?]{.underline} Actively helping free-living non-humans in an era
when millions of people still lack adequate nutrition and healthcare,
and when humans still systematically hurt, harm and kill billions of
sentient beings in factory-farms and slaughterhouses, has made such a
project seem sociologically fanciful as well. Evolution didn\'t design
Homo sapiens to be impartially altruistic.

[[CRISPR]{.mark}-based [\"gene drives\" are a
game-changer]{.mark}.]{.underline} In principle, [gene drives [can be
used]{.mark} - cheaply, rapidly and sustainably - [to \"fix\" the
typical level of suffering undergone]{.mark} by members of entire
free-living and sexually reproducing species [at minimal inconvenience
to humans]{.mark}.]{.underline} If targeted wisely, [gene drives could
massively amplify the effects of even exceedingly weak and fitful human
benevolence towards non-human animals.]{.underline} In principle, the
[level of suffering in any sexually reproducing species of organism
could be significantly reduced via genetic tweaking for the cost of
around \$10,000 of per species or less at current prices.]{.underline}
Back-of-an-envelope calculation suggests the financial cost of a happy
non-human biosphere would currently be several hundred million dollars -
plus annual maintenance costs of perhaps several million dollars per
year.

### AT: Neg Util

#### Reject negative util\-\--positive util is the only equal metric to evaluate consequences.

**Gustafsson '24** \[Johan. E (research scientist at the University of
Texas at Austin and senior research fellow in philosophy at University
of York); November 2, 2024; "Against Negative Utilitarianism,"
https://johanegustafsson.net/papers/against-negative-utilitarianism.pdf\]//lol

Consider

Bliss versus Torture[You have a choice between the following outcomes,
where the same people live for the same duration:]{.underline}

𝐴 [Everyone gets a century of pure bliss followed by a
pinprick.]{.underline}

> 𝐵 [Someone gets a century of torture, and everyone else gets a century
> of no pleasure and no pain.]{.underline}

[Given a large enough population, you ought to choose 𝐵 over 𝐴 according
to Negative Utilitarianism.]{.underline} [Yet 𝐴 seems more choice-worthy
than 𝐵 on, basically, any plausible moral metric: 𝐴 is overwhelmingly in
everyone's subjective interest]{.underline} (given, as seems plausible,
that everyone strongly prefers ending up in 𝐴 to ending up in 𝐵).12, 13
[𝐴 is more equal than 𝐵. The worse-off are better off in 𝐴 than in 𝐵.
There is less torture in 𝐴 than in 𝐵.]{.underline} And so on.

Furthermore, it seems that Bliss versus Torture lacks a clear analogue
for Classical Utilitarianism.14 (But it is, admittedly, somewhat
slippery what counts as analogous to what.) Furthermore[, the suffering
in 𝐵 seems morally worse, and a greater evil, than the suffering in
𝐴.]{.underline} Finally, [this counter-example cannot be blocked by
letting the sum total of pleasure break ties between outcomes with the
same sum total of pain.]{.underline} Hence this counter-example to
Negative Utilitarianism should be more challenging than the earlier
counter-examples.

[It may be objected that we could deny the possibility of any disanalogy
between Classical and Negative Utilitarianism by claiming that there is
no such thing as positive well-being.1]{.underline}5 If there is no such
thing as positive well-being, the bliss in 𝐴 would count for nothing.
And, if so, even Classical Utilitarianism would prescribe 𝐵. But note
that the claim that bliss does not provide positive well-being (that is,
that bliss is not good for the person) is a substantive evaluative
claim. This claim, which Classical Utilitarianism rules out, is part of
the package of normative and evaluative ideas that the counter-example
targets. [Bliss versus Torture does not refer to positive and negative
well-being; it only refers to bliss, pinpricks, and torture. Bliss,
pinpricks, and torture do exist.]{.underline}

Still, [one may defend the rejection of positive well-being with the
claim that there are no experiences with a positive hedonic
tone.]{.underline}16 [But this conflicts with what I suspect is most
people's introspective judgement that pleasurable experiences from the
best things in life have a positive hedonic tone.]{.underline}17

Furthermore, [it seems that our reasons for thinking that there is
negative well-being are analogous to our reasons for thinking that there
is positive well-being. If we are wrong about the existence of positive
well-being, we should also be sceptical about the existence of negative
well-being.]{.underline}

It may next be objected that a version of Negative Utilitarianism that
focused, not on pain, but on negative lifetime well-being would avoid
this counter-example. According to Lifetime Negative Utilitarianism,
pleasure compensates pain within a life just like in Classical
Utilitarianism, but you ought minimize the sum total of negative
lifetime well-being.18 This view avoids my counter-example, [since the
pinpricks are compensated by the bliss so that there is no negative
lifetime well-being]{.underline} in 𝐴. But it gives [less weight to
torture for a person who still ends up with non-negative lifetime
well-being than a pinprick for a person who ends up with negative
lifetime well-being, which is implausible.]{.underline}19

### AT: Wild Animals

#### We [over conflate]{.underline} suffering of wild animals.

Suffering,";
https://www.plantinghappiness.co.uk/the-unproven-and-unprovable-case-for-wild-animal-suffering/\]//lol**

Tomasik discusses and dismisses two objections to his argument. First,
that [[humans]{.mark} are inclined **to [misjudge]{.mark} the [happiness
of animals]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Tomasik claims we might be
underestimating the suffering of animals because, from our
air-conditioned rooms, we are no longer used to experiencing anything
like it. Second, he considers why we don't see animals committing
suicide if they are so unhappy. I'll return to the first point later on,
[but I [don't see why]{.mark} [discussing suicides is relevant]{.mark}:
it's presumably quite [hard for animals to kill themselves]{.mark},
except by falling from a great height or drowning.]{.underline} Further,
you'd [expect [animals]{.mark} to [only attempt]{.mark} suicide
[once]{.mark} they are [below]{.mark} the [neutral level of
happines]{.mark}s anyway, [so that wouldn't tell us]{.mark} anything
[about whether non-suicidal animals have net positive or]{.mark} net
[neg]{.mark}ative [lives]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Objections to the argument there is more suffering than happiness in
nature

In this section I present five objections, which I outline here. First,
the analysis is selective. It focuses on the most vividly painful
moments in nature, such as being killed, and gives very little analysis
to the average, humdrum and potentially pleasant lives of animals.
Second, judging how much animals suffer will be hard. Trying to assess
how happy animals are by considering how much we, as humans, would like
to be them is an irrelevant anthropomorphic mistake. It's not clear how
we could make the necessary cardinal comparisons either, except by
assumption. Third, the analysis is one-sided. Only the suffering of the
prey is counted, not the pleasure of the predators. Fourth, it employs a
'bait and switch', treating relevant different types of animals as if
they were the same. Having argued 'k-selector' animals (e.g. gazelles,
which have few offspring, few of whom die immediately) have bad lives
and painful deaths, he argues there is more suffering than happiness in
nature because most animals are 'r-selectors' animals (e.g. fish, which
have many offspring, most of which die immediately). Clearly, we should
treat different animals differently. Fifth, it is incomplete. We need a
common way of assessing the suffering of animals of different types to
establish where suffering lies. Having presented these objections, I
draw them together. I suggest, if we want to know the balance of
happiness to suffering in nature, we should to give an evolutionary
explanation of how much pleasure and pain the animals in a given
ecosystem would experience on a daily basis. This analysis will be
piecemeal, riddled with anthropomorphic assumptions, and likely
different from animal to animal anyway.

I'll now discuss these objections in turn.

3.1. Selective analysis: relies heavily on assumptions about the
suffering caused by death

The main argument for the idea that there is net WAS seems to be that
most animals' deaths are so bad that, even if they experience some
happiness whilst alive, it outweighs the happiness they experience
beforehand. In the paper, [[Tomasik]{.mark} [quotes]{.mark} a vivid
account of a [zebra being killed by a lion]{.mark}]{.underline} (Tomasik
2015, 135).

Let's assess the zebra example provided. [The [life expectancy of a
zebra in the wild is 25 years]{.mark}.]{.underline} [In the account
Tomasik gives the [zebra dies]{.mark} painfully [over 6 minutes]{.mark}.
As a [percentage of]{.mark} the [zebra's life]{.mark}, that [6 minutes
is 0.000046%.]{.mark}]{.underline} Let's assume the zebra is [[asleep
for 8 hours]{.mark} of every day[, so that 6 minutes is 0.000068% of its
conscious experience.]{.mark}]{.underline} Even granting the death of
the zebra is gruesome and those [6 minutes]{.underline} may feel like a
long time, that [is nevertheless a [tiny fraction]{.mark} of the
animal's entire life and **[should not be
overstated]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

For the sake of argument, let's assume that we can make cardinal intra-
and interpersonal comparisons of utility of and across other species and
do so lazily by intuition. That is to say, we can just guess [how many
times worse 6 minutes of being eaten is that 6 minutes of some other
experience, such as eating grass.]{.underline} Let's also assume the
zebra's life has been happy overall excluding the last 6 minutes of her
death (I'll come back to assessing the day-to-day lives on animals in
the next section). [Using the numbers above, for the zebra's death to
cause so much suffering it outweighs the pleasure in the rest of its
life, that means [each minute of its]{.mark} [death would]{.mark} need
to [be at least 2,190,000 times more painful than]{.mark} the [average
minute of the zebra's life]{.mark}.]{.underline} I provide no evidence
for this, but intuitively it seems rather hard to believe moments of
dying could really be that bad and so much worse than any other
experience.

Some might object I've chosen an unrepresentative case: zebras can live
25 years, in comparison to which 6 minutes is rather short[. The ratio
of time-dying to time-before-death may vary tremendously]{.underline}.
It would not advance the philosophical analysis to consider a range of
cases, so I will end this section by pointing out that even if it takes
some animal an hour to die[, [if]{.mark} the [animal lives for 1.15
years]{.mark} and has had a positive life until that point, [each minute
of death would still need to be 10,000 times more unpleasant
than]{.mark} its [pre-dying life was pleasant.]{.mark} Even in this
scenario **[death would still need to be implausibly bad]{.mark}** to
outweigh even a slightly pleasant life.]{.underline}

On the assumption that time spent dying is a small part of animals'
lives, the [crucial question must be whether the ordinary life of an
animal is pleasant or not.]{.underline} Tomasik notes that, unlike us,
animals may not have access to food and water whenever they want it,
shelter if it rains, and must be constantly wary of predators. However,
[isn't sufficient to prove his case that animals have some bad moments
in their lives. What his arguments need to show is that there is more
suffering than happiness overall. [Presumably there are some **positive
moments in animals lives**.]{.mark} I assume zebras enjoy [eating grass,
having sex, and enjoy time spent with the rest of the
herd.]{.mark}]{.underline} Maybe a zebra's life looks something like
Figure 1.

### AT: Animals

#### Humans outweigh animals

**Green '19** \[Brian Patrick (Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at
SCU); June 1^st^, 2019;"Self-Preservation Should Be Humankind's First
Ethical Priority and Therefore Rapid Space Settlement Is Necessary."
volume 110, pgs. 35--37\]//lol

In contrast to this necrotic ideology, other scholars have emphasized
the incredible [importance of human life, [despite our **moral
shortcomings**]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g. in this issue, Abney, 2019;
Munevar, 2019; Smith, 2019). Hans Jonas (1984) argued in The Imperative
of Responsibility that because [[humanity is]{.mark} the [only
species]{.mark} we know of which is [capable of ethics]{.mark}, it is
[thereby bound by ethics]{.mark}, and the primary morally-binding
principle of ethics is that [humanity ought to **continue to
exist**,]{.mark} so that ethics itself may remain a possibility within
the universe.]{.underline}

#### Animals experience more pleasure than pain.

**Veit and Browning '23** \[Walter (Lecturer in Philosophy at the
University of Reading) and Heather (Lecturer in Philosophy at the
University of Southampton); Biology & Philosophy, "Positive Wild Animal
Welfare," vol. 38\]//lol

So while [[animals]{.mark} experience negative affects when things are
going wrong, they [will also have positive experiences]{.mark} when they
correct for these, [and]{.mark} these positives will [cancel out]{.mark}
at least some of the overall [negative experience]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Being cold feels bad, but curling up in a cosy den feels good. We need
more information to determine the intensity and duration of all these
positive and negative experiences to determine if, and by how much, one
set may outweigh the other. It is true that evolution does not 'care'
about welfare and there is no evolutionary reason for welfare to be
maximised beyond motivating fitness-enhancing behaviour, such that there
will be cases where the two come apart and fitness 'wins' (Soryl et al.
2021). However, we would expect that most often the two will work in
tandem, else the potentially costly affects would not be preserved.

Finally, there are a large range of [additional positive experiences
that animals can have over their lifetime.]{.underline} Social bonds,
affiliative behaviour, courtship, mating, and rearing offspring are all
potential sources of positive experience. Young animals play a lot - and
sometimes older animals join in - behaviours which are typically taken
to be indicative of positive welfare (Held and Špinka 2011). Performance
of many natural behaviours will be positively valenced - for example a
recent study suggests that presence of endogenous opioids signals that
birds find singing intrinsically pleasurable (Stevenson et al. 2020). So
even beyond simply the satisfaction of bodily needs that weigh against
the negative experiences of dissatisfaction, there are additional
positives an animal can experience, associated with a variety of natural
behaviours, that help shift the balance back in a positive direction.

In particular, we may consider that [the ['baseline' experience of an
animal is mildly positive]{.mark}.]{.underline} If we strip away all the
specific physical demands, [the experience of just existing could be a
positive one -- a "joy of living"]{.underline} (Ginsburg and Jablonka
2019, p. 189). This makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint -- [that
an [animal for whom existence is positive]{.mark}ly valenced is one more
likely to [value]{.mark} its own [life and]{.mark} to [seek its
continuation]{.mark}]{.underline} (Humphrey 2011). It could even have
formed the earliest types of experiencing, an "inner feeling of living
which if experienced as positive, would drive behaviors that sustain it
and lead to the evolution of what we call more specific 'wanting'"
(Ginsburg and Jablonka 2019, p. 189). This is not to imply that a
sophisticated cognitive representation is needed, but merely that a
positive feeling is one which an individual may fight to maintain.

### AT: Spaghettification

#### No vacuum\-\--it's stable.

**Dattaro '14 --** \[Laura (Science Journalist and Writer for Columbia
Journalism Review, Symmetry Magazine, Slate, and the NYT); "What Stephen
Hawking Really Said About Destroying the Universe,";
https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/a11217/what-stephen-hawking-really-said-about-destroying-the-universe-17192502/\]//lol

In July 2012, when scientists at CERN\'s Large Hadron Collider
culminated decades of work with their discovery of the Higgs boson, most
physicists celebrated. Stephen Hawking did not. The famed theorist
expressed his disappointment that nothing more unusual was found,
calling the discovery \"a pity in a way.\" But did he ever say the Higgs
could destroy the universe?

That\'s what many reports in the media said earlier this week, quoting a
preface Hawking wrote to a book called Starmus. According to The
Australian, the preface reads in part: \"The Higgs potential has the
worrisome feature that it might become metastable at energies above 100
\[billion\] gigaelectronvolts (GeV). [This could mean that the [universe
could undergo]{.mark} catastrophic [vacuum decay]{.mark}, [with a
bubble]{.mark} of the true vacuum [expanding at the speed of
light]{.mark}. This could happen at any time and we wouldn\'t see it
coming.\"]{.underline}

What Hawking is talking about here is not the Higgs boson but what\'s
called the Higgs potential, which are \"totally different concepts,\"
says Katie Mack, a theoretical astrophysicist at Melbourne University.
The Higgs field permeates the entire universe, and the Higgs boson is an
excitation of that field, just like an electron is an excitation of an
electric field. In this analogy, the Higgs potential is like the
voltage, determining the value of the field.

Once physicists began to close in on the mass of the Higgs boson, they
were able to work out the Higgs potential. That value seemed to reveal
that the universe exists in what\'s known as a meta-stable vacuum state,
or false vacuum, a state that\'s stable for now but could slip into the
\"true\" vacuum at any time. This is the catastrophic vacuum decay in
Hawking\'s warning, though he is not the first to posit the idea.

Is he right?

\"There are a couple of really good reasons to think [that's**[not the
end of the story]{.mark}**]{.underline},\" Mack says. [[There are **two
ways**]{.mark} for a meta-stable state [to fall off into the true
vacuum]{.mark}]{.underline}---one classical way, and one quantum way.
[The [first]{.mark} would occur via [a huge energy boost]{.mark}, the
100 billion GeVs Hawking mentions. [But]{.mark}]{.underline}, Mack says,
[[the universe **already** experienced]{.mark} such [high energies
during the period of inflation just after the big
bang.]{.mark}]{.underline} Particles in [[cosmic rays]{.mark} from space
also [**regularly** collide]{.mark} with these kinds of high energies,
and **[yet the vacuum hasn\'t collapsed]{.mark}** ([otherwise, we
wouldn\'t be here]{.mark}).]{.underline}

\"Imagine that somebody hands you a piece of paper and says, \'This
piece of paper has the potential to spontaneously combust,\' and so you
might be worried,\" Mack says. \"But then they tell you 20 years ago it
was in a furnace.\" If it didn\'t combust in the furnace, it\'s not
likely to combust sitting in your hand.

Of course, there\'s always the quantum world to consider, and that\'s
where things always get weirder. In the quantum world, where the
smallest of particles interact, it\'s possible for a particle on one
side of a barrier to suddenly appear on the other side of the barrier
without actually going through it, a phenomenon known as quantum
tunneling. If our universe was in fact in a meta-stable state, it could
quantum tunnel through the barrier to the vacuum on the other side with
no warning, destroying everything in an instant. And while that is
theoretically possible, predictions show that if it were to happen,
**[[it\'s not likely for billions of billions of
years]{.underline}]{.mark}**. By then, the sun and Earth and you and I
and Stephen Hawking will be a distant memory, so it\'s probably not
worth losing sleep over it.

What\'s more likely, Mack says, is that there is some [**[new
physics]{.mark}** not yet understood that **[makes our vacuum
stable]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Physicists know there are parts of the
model missing; mysteries like quantum gravity and dark matter that still
defy explanation. When two physicists published a paper documenting the
Higgs potential conundrum in March, their conclusion was that an
[[explanation lies beyond the Standard Model, **not that the universe
may collapse**]{.mark} **at any time**]{.underline}.

### AT: AGI

#### AGI is [premature]{.underline} and [overblown]{.underline}\-\--market forces, competition, and gradual development will [naturally regulate]{.underline} its impact [before]{.underline} it poses existential threats.

Robin Hanson, an economist at George Mason University who has written a
science-fiction-like book about uploaded consciousness and has worked as
an [A.I. researcher, told me that [we worry too much about the
**singularity**]{.mark}.]{.underline} "[We're combining all of these
relatively unlikely scenarios into a grand scenario to make it all
work]{.underline}," he said. A computer system would have to become
capable of improving itself; [we'd have to vastly underestimate its
abilities; and its values would have to drift enormously, turning it
against us. Even if all of this were to happen, he said, the **[A.I.
wouldn't be able "to push a button and destroy the
universe."]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Hanson offered an economic take on the future of artificial
intelligence. [If A.G.I. does develop, he argues, then it's likely to
happen in multiple places]{.underline} around the same time. [The
[systems]{.mark} would then [be put to economic use]{.mark} by the
companies or organizations that developed them. The [market would
curtail]{.mark} their powers; [investors, wanting to see]{.mark} their
[companies succeed]{.mark}, would go slow [and add safety]{.mark}
features.]{.underline} "If there are many taxi services, and one taxi
service starts to, like, take its customers to strange places, then
customers will switch to other suppliers," Hanson said. ["[You don't
have to]{.mark} go to their power source and [unplug them from the wall.
You're unplugging the revenue stream]{.mark}."]{.underline}

A world in which multiple superintelligent computers coexist would be
complicated[. [If one system goes rogue]{.mark}, Hanson said, [we might
program others to combat it]{.mark}. Alternatively, the first
superintelligent [A.I. to]{.mark} be invented might [go about
suppressing competitors.]{.mark}]{.underline} "That is a very
interesting plot for a science-fiction novel," Clune said. "You could
also imagine a whole society of A.I.s. [There's [A.I. police, there's
A.G.I.s that go to jail]{.mark}. It's very interesting to think
about.]{.underline}" But Hanson argued that these sorts of scenarios are
so futuristic that they shouldn't concern us. "I think, for anything
you're worried about, you have to ask what's the right time to worry,"
he said. Imagine that you could have foreseen nuclear weapons or
automobile traffic a thousand years ago. "There wouldn't have been much
you could have done then to think usefully about them," Hanson said. ["I
just think, [for A.I., we're well before that
point."]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### AGI is [fundamentally]{.underline} [impossible]{.underline}\-\--[complexity]{.underline} of human intelligence and consciousness [exceeds]{.underline} the [limits]{.underline} of mathematical modeling and machine computation.

1.3.1 Impossibility

Throughout this book, we will defend the thesis that it is
[[**impossible** to obtain]{.underline}]{.mark} what we shall call
[synoptic and adequate mathematical models of complex systems, which
means: [models that would]{.mark} [allow us to engineer AI
systems]{.mark} that can fulfill the requirements such systems must
satisfy [if they are to emulate intelligence]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Because the proper understanding of the term impossible as it is used in
this sentence is so important to all that follows, we start with an
elucidation of how we are using it. First, we use the term in three
different senses, which we refer to as technical, physical, and
mathematical impossibility, respectively.

To say that something is technically impossible---for example,
controlled nuclear fusion with a positive energy output---is to [draw
attention to the fact that it is [impossible given the
tech]{.mark}nology [we have today]{.mark}.]{.underline} We find it
useful to document the technically impossible here only where (as is all
too often) proponents of transhumanist and similar concepts seek to
promote their ideas on the basis of claims which are, and may for all
time remain, technically impossible.16

[To say that something is physically impossible is to say that it is
impossible because [it would **contravene the laws of
physics**]{.mark}.]{.underline} To give an example: in highly viscous
fluids (low Reynolds numbers), no type of swimming object can achieve
net displacement (this is the scallop theorem \[Purcell 1977\]).17

To speak of mathematical impossibility, finally, is to assert that a
solution to some mathematically specified problem---for example, [an
analytical solution of the nbody problem]{.underline} (see p. 189) [or
an algorithmic solution of the halting problem]{.underline} (see section
7.2)---[cannot be found; not because of any shortcomings in the data or
hardware or software or human brains, but rather for a [**priori
reasons** of mathematics.]{.mark} This is the primary sense in which we
use the term impossible in this book.]{.underline}

1.4 The AI hype cycle

Despite the lack of success in brain modelling, and fired by a naïve
understanding of human brain functioning, [optimism as to future
advances in [AI feeds]{.mark} most conspicuously [into]{.mark} what is
now called ['transhumanism',]{.mark} the [idea that tech]{.mark}nologies
to [enhance human]{.mark} capabilities [will lead to]{.mark} the
emergence of [new 'posthuman' beings]{.mark}.]{.underline} On one
scenario, humans themselves will become immortal because they will be
able to abandon their current biological bodies and live on, forever, in
digital form. On another scenario, machines will develop their own will
and subdue mankind into slavery with their superintelligence while they
draw on their immortality to go forth into the galaxy and colonise
space.

[[Speculations]{.mark}]{.underline} such as this [[are]{.mark} at the
same time [**fascinating** and **disturbing**]{.mark}.]{.underline} But
we believe that, [like some earlier pronouncements from the AI
community, they [must be taken with]{.mark} a heavy **[pillar of
salt]{.mark}**, for they reflect enthusiasm triggered by successes of AI
research that [does not factor in]{.mark} the fact [that these successes
have been achieved]{.mark} only [along]{.mark} certain [**tightly
defined paths**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In 2016 it became known that the company DeepMind had used AI in their
AlphaGo automaton to partially solve the game of Go.18 Given the
complexity of the game, this must be recognised as a stunning
achievement. But it is an achievement whose underlying methodology can
be applied only to a narrow set of problems. What it shows is that, in
certain completely rule-determined confined settings with a
low-dimensional phase space such as abstract games, a variant of machine
learning known as reinforcement learning (see 8.6.7.3) can be used to
create algorithms that outperform humans. Importantly, this is done in
ways that do not rely on any knowledge on the part of the machine of the
rules of the games involved. This does not, however, mean that DeepMind
can 'discover' the rules governing just any kind of activity. DeepMind's
engineers provided the software with carefully packaged examples of
activity satisfying just this set of rules and allowed it to implicitly
generate new playing strategies not present in the supplied examples by
using purely computational adversarial settings (two algorithms playing
against each other).19 The software is not in a position to go out and
identify packages of this sort on its own behalf. It is cognizant
neither of the rules nor of the new strategies which we, its human
observers, conceive it to be applying.

Yet the successes of DeepMind and of other AI engineering virtuosi have
led once again to over-generalised claims on behalf of the machine
learning approach, which gave new energy to the idea of an AI that would
be general in the same sort of way that human intelligence is general,
to the extent that it could go forth into the world unsupervised and
achieve ever more startling results.

Parallel bursts of enthusiasm have arisen also in connection with the
great strides made in recent years in the field of image recognition.
But there are already signs that there, too, the potential of AI
technology has once again been overestimated (Marcus 2018; Landgrebe et
al. 2021).

Why is this so? Why, in other words, is AI once again facing a wave of
dampening enthusiasm20 representing the third major AI sobering episode
after the mid-1970s and late 1980s, both of which ended in AI winters?
There are, certainly, many reasons for this cyclical phenomenon. One
such reason is that genuine advances in AI fall from public view as they
become embedded in innumerable everyday products and services. Many
contributions of working (narrow) AI are thereby hidden. But a further
reason is the weak foundation of AI enthusiasm itself, which involves in
each cycle an initial exaggeration of the potential of AI under the
assumption that impressive success along a single front will be
generalisable into diverse unrelated fields (taking us, for instance,
from Jeopardy! to curing cancer \[Strickland 2019\]).21

[Assumptions of this sort are made, we believe, because AI enthusiasts
often do not have the interdisciplinary scientific knowledge that is
[need]{.mark}ed [to recognise]{.mark} [the obstacles that will]{.mark}
stand [in the way of]{.mark} envisaged [new AI applications]{.mark}. It
is part of our aim here to show [that crucial lessons concerning both
the limits and the potential of AI]{.mark} can be learned through
application of the right sort of interdisciplinary
knowledge.]{.underline}

1.5 Why machines will not inherit the earth

[In this book, we will argue that it is not an accident that so
[**little progress** has been made towards AGI]{.mark} over successive
cycles of AI research. The [lack of progress reflects]{.mark}, rather,
certain narrow, [structural limits]{.mark} to what can be achieved in
this field, limits which we document in detail.]{.underline}

[The [human tendency to **anthropomorphise** is]{.mark} very
[powerful]{.mark}]{.underline} (Ekbia 2008). When our computer pauses
while executing some especially complicated operation, we are tempted to
say, 'it's thinking'. But it is not so. The processes inside the
computer are physical through and through and, as we shall see in
section 7.2, limited to certain narrowly defined operations defined in
the 1930s by Turing and Church. The fact that we describe them in mental
terms turns on the fact that the computer has been built to imitate
(inter alia) operations that human beings would perform by using their
minds. We thus impute the corresponding mental capabilities to the
machine itself, as we impute happiness to a cartoon clown.

As Searle (1992) argued, computation has a physical, but no mental,
reality because the significance that we impute to what the computer
does (what we perceive as its mental reality) is observer dependent. If
we take away all observers, then only the physical dimensions of its
operations would remain. To see what is involved here, compare the
difference between a dollar bill as a piece of paper and a dollar bill
as money. If we take away all observers, then only the former would
remain, because the latter is, again, 'observer dependent'. [While we
impute consciousness to computers, we ourselves are
conscious.]{.underline}

[[Computers]{.mark} also [will **not be able to gain
consciousness**]{.mark} in the future, since as we will show, [whatever
remarkable feats they might be engineered to perform,]{.mark} the aspect
of those feats we are referring to when we ascribe [consciousness or
mentality to the computer will remain **forever** a product of observer
dependence.]{.mark}]{.underline}
