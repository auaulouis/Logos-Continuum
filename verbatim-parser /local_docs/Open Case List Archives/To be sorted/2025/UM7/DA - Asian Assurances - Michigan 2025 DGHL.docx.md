The Stability of the U.S.-ROK Alliance

[Despite political turmoil]{.underline} in South Korea, [the U.S.-ROK
alliance has remained **stable** and **effective**]{.underline} in
deterring North Korea's opportunistic provocations. When President Yoon
Suk Yeol declared martial law---only to have it overturned by the
National Assembly within hours---[the]{.underline} [U.S.
D]{.underline}epartment [o]{.underline}f [D]{.underline}efense promptly
[reaffirmed its ironclad commitment to South Korea's
defense]{.underline}. General Paul LaCamera, the commander of U.S.
Forces Korea (USFK), also made clear that joint military exercises and
operations would not be disrupted by external factors.

These [statements were not mere rhetoric.]{.underline} During January
14--16, U.S. and South Korean forces conducted combined firepower
exercises, followed by joint air force drills from January 21 to January
24. According to the ROK Ministry of National Defense, 113 combined
exercises and trainings are planned for the first half of 2025---a
notable 10% increase from the same period in 2024.

To better understan[d the alliance's stabilizing effect, consider a
counterfactual scenario: a political crisis in South Korea occurring
without a U.S. military presence. North Korea would find it easier to
exploit the leadership vacuum in Seoul,]{.underline} potentially staging
military demonstrations in the West Sea or attacking ROK units near the
demilitarized zone. [Even if such actions did not occu]{.underline}r,
the [mere prospect of these risks would significantly destabilize South
Korea's security environment.]{.underline}

More importantly, such uncertainty in and of itself is a critical factor
affecting South Korea's financial markets. Following the declaration and
subsequent repeal of martial law, foreign investors withdrew
approximately \$750 million from the country within three days. Business
leaders worry that ongoing instability could lead agencies like Moody's
or Fitch to downgrade South Korea's national credit rating for the first
time since the 1997 Asian financial crisis. However, s[uch worst-case
scenarios have not yet materialized. Thanks to the presence of U.S.
forces, deterrence remains intact, ensuring a minimum level of stability
and predictability]{.underline}.

#### The plan is a shock to South Korea and causes them to prolif due to existing [fear of abandonment]{.underline}. [Even if]{.underline} other factors of the alliance exist, the plan is seen as [mitigating entrapment]{.underline} and [avoiding commitments]{.underline} to the alliance

Entrapment, Fear of Abandonment, and South Korea's Nuclear Proliferation
Desire

A [patron state's concern about entrapment can ultimately drive a client
state toward nuclear proliferation if the client **fears
abandonment**.]{.underline} If the patron's commitment to providing a
nuclear security guarantee is perceived as weak, its assurance may seem
non-credible. [This]{.underline} [perception can prompt the
client]{.underline} to seek additional security measures, [such as
developing nuclear weapons]{.underline} (Bleek and Lorber 2014; Sagan
and Waltz 2013). [Reassurance is considered]{.underline} more
[challenging than deterrence, as it relies on both the patron's
deterrence capability and its demonstrated resolve]{.underline}
(Blankenship and Lin-Greenberg 2022). [Even if a client perceives strong
deterrence capabilities, **doubts** about the patron's resolve **can
fuel abandonment fears**]{.underline}. [Efforts]{.underline} by the
patron [to **mitigate entrapment risks** or **avoid costly commitments**
may **signal** waning resolve]{.underline}, [raising concerns about the
possible withdrawal of security guarantees]{.underline}. As discussed
earlier, inadequate reassurance can push a non-nuclear client toward
nuclearization (Bleek and Lorber 2014; Debs and Monteiro 2016; Reiter
2014).

[This dynamic of entrapment, fear of abandonment, and the desire for
independent nuclearization]{.underline} [is exemplified by South
Korea]{.underline}. Kim (2017) illustrates how the [perception of US
abandonment,]{.underline} shaped by two key events---the US opposition
to South Korea's retaliation against North Korea's Commando Attack,
which reached just one kilometer from the Blue House and led to a
gunfight with South Korean forces, and the withdrawal of approximately
twenty thousand US troops under the Nixon Doctrine---[prompted South
Korea to pursue nuclear weapons development in the 1970s under Park
Chung-hee's administration]{.underline}. At the time, [the US, burdened
by the costly Vietnam War, sought to reduce its military commitments
abroad to avoid further entrapments. Although US pressure ultimately
forced Park to abandon the nuclear program, this case clearly
demonstrates]{.underline} how [a client state's fear of abandonment can
drive efforts toward independent nuclearization.]{.underline}

[This dynamic persists today. Despite being under the US nuclear
umbrella]{.underline} since the withdrawal of tactical nuclear weapons
from South Korea in 1991, [public support for independent nuclear
acquisition remains well over 60%]{.underline} (Kim, Kang, and Ham 2023;
Dalton, Friedhoff, and Kim 2022). This [sentiment]{.underline} likely
[reflects doubts about the credibility of US security guarantees or
concerns over North Korea's advancing nuclear capabilities,]{.underline}
including ICBMs capable of reaching the US mainland. [Many South Koreans
fear abandonment due to the increasing costs and risks of maintaining
extended deterrence]{.underline} (Chung 2024).

[Reflecting]{.underline} these [public concerns,]{.underline} South
Korean President [Yoon]{.underline} Suk-yeol [suggested]{.underline} in
early 2023 that [South]{.underline} [Korea might consider developing its
own nuclear weapons or redeploying US nuclear weapons if North Korean
threats escalated]{.underline}. Although this position was later
reversed following the Washington Declaration---in which the US pledged
to strengthen extended deterrence in exchange for South Korea forgoing
nuclear weapons---[the statement underscored South Korea's perception of
US extended deterrence, including the nuclear umbrella, as
insufficiently reliable to deter North Korea amid growing fears of
abandonmen]{.underline}t.

#### Nuclear war.

**Kim '25** \[Lami; February 10; Professor at Daniel K. Inouye
Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies (APCSS) under the U.S.
Department of Defense; United States Institute of Peace, "The Risks of
South Korea's Nuclear Armament Under a Troubled Democracy,"
https://www.usip.org/publications/2025/02/risks-south-koreas-nuclear-armament-under-troubled-democracy;
accessed: 7.11.25\]

Risks Involved

[South Korea's desire for **nuc**lear weapon**s** is not hard to
understand given its security concerns]{.underline}, but [nuclearization
would not necessarily lead to **greater stability** on the Korean
Peninsula --- indeed, it could have the opposite effect.]{.underline}
[For Pyongyang, tolerating South Korea's nuclearization would mean
losing its sole advantage over the **conventionally
superior**]{.underline} South. Therefore, the period during which North
Korea wields greatest military supremacy over the South would be prior
to Seoul's nuclear armament, before Pyongyang's nuclear advantage is
compromised. Thus, the [risk of North Korea **launching attacks** on
South Korean nuclear sites to prevent nuclearization]{.underline} ---
[similar to **Israel's strikes** on **Syria** and **Iraq**]{.underline}
--- is not negligible.

If South Korea managed to avoid a preventive attack from North Korea,
withstand international economic and diplomatic pressures during the
nuclearization process, and successfully develop a functional nuclear
arsenal, it would likely be able to deter a North Korean nuclear attack.
The threat of mutual nuclear destruction could significantly reduce the
likelihood of a large-scale, all-out war between the two Koreas.

However, [existing scholarship suggests that this nuclear-level
stability could still increase the risk of **conventional-level
conflicts**]{.underline}. Although the risk of mutual nuclear
annihilation might deter large-scale conflict, the
[**"stability-instability paradox"** suggests that nuclear weapons could
embolden actors to engage in limited-scale provocations under the
impression that such conflicts would not escalate into full-blown
war]{.underline}. The 1999 Kargil War between India and Pakistan vividly
illustrates this phenomenon. After acquiring nuclear weapons in 1998,
Pakistani leaders believed that the threat of nuclear escalation would
deter India from launching a large-scale attack, which emboldened them
to initiate a limited conflict on the Indian side of the disputed
Kashmir territory. Similarly, a nuclear [South Korea, emboldened by its
newly acquired capabilities, and an already provocative North Korea
could find themselves **clashing** under the assumption that such
conflicts would remain **relatively limited** in scale]{.underline}.

Until recently, such concerns about South Korean decision-making would
have been easily dismissed. In democracies, major national security
decisions are typically made through consultation with civilian and
military advisors, with cooler heads prevailing. South Korea, as a
flourishing democracy, has long been perceived as a rational and
responsible actor. If it were to acquire nuclear weapons, the assumption
has been that it would do so purely to deter its erratic and dangerous
nuclear-armed neighbor.

The [narrative has been simple: the North is the unpredictable
**provocateur** while the South is the stable and benign
counterpart]{.underline}. However, revelations regarding [Yoon's actions
related to declaring martial law, seriously **undermine confidence** in
South Korea's ability to **act responsibly**]{.underline}.

Yoon's Reckless Provocations

As investigations continue, mounting evidence suggests that Yoon
attempted to bait Pyongyang into a military clash to justify declaring
martial law. On November 28, shortly before the December 3 martial law
declaration, [Yoon's **defense minister**, Kim Yong Hyun, widely
regarded as the chief conspirator behind Yoon's martial law order,
allegedly ordered a **strike** on locations inside North Korean
territory]{.underline} from which North Korea's trash balloons
originated. Though he denied any connection to the martial law
declaration, Kim admitted to contemplating the strike, which another key
accomplice, Roh Sang-won, acknowledged having discussed with Kim. Notes
confiscated from Roh's notebook further revealed that Kim's plan
suggested a plot to "induce an attack from the North at the Northern
Limit Line," the disputed maritime border between the two Koreas. If
carried out, these actions would have significantly escalated
hostilities with the North.

This was not the first time the [Yoon administration considered
deliberately **provoking** North Korea into a **military
confrontation**]{.underline}. In mid-October, when Yoon was already
preparing for martial law, South Korean drones infiltrated North Korean
airspace, reaching as far as Pyongyang, violating the 1953 Korean
Armistice Agreement. [While the Ministry of Defense initially denied the
allegations, it has since refused to confirm or deny the operation
following the emergence of evidence]{.underline}. The operation appears
to have lacked a strategic goal given that South Korea already has
advanced surveillance capabilities to monitor North Korea and the drones
were not deployed for a combat mission. Moreover, these particular
[drones were loud enough to be heard from a long distance, making it
more of a **provocation** than a **covert operation**]{.underline}.
Taken together, these facts support suspicions that the true objective
was to provoke the North to create a pretext for declaring martial law.

Fortunately, Pyongyang refrained from responding to Seoul's
provocations, possibly due to its reluctance to engage in a military
conflict while a significant portion of its troops, weaponry and
ammunition were deployed to support Russia's war efforts in Ukraine.
[Under different **circumstances**, such actions could have risked
igniting a **local confrontation**, potentially **escalating** into a
**large-scale conflict**]{.underline}. [If Seoul can act with such
**recklessness** even without **nuc**lear weapon**s**, how much more
**emboldened** might it become if it were to acquire them]{.underline}?

For seven decades, the [U.S.-South Korea alliance has been the
**linchpin** of peace, security, and prosperity]{.underline} in
Northeast Asia, the Indo-Pacific, and increasingly around the world,
said Secretary of State Antony Blinken on a recent visit to the South
Korea.

"Today, the [alliance between the United States and Korea remains more
essential]{.underline} than ever in shaping our shared future. And I
believe it\'s also [**stronger** than ever]{.underline} in taking on
that task. We\'ve enhanced \... our extended deterrence, the
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [commit]{.underline}ment [to
defend our allies with]{.underline} the full range of our conventional
and [**nuclear** capabilities]{.underline}, as well as our ability to
coordinate and respond to DPRK \[Democratic People's Republic of Korea\]
aggression, including through the nuclear consultative group."

The [United States]{.underline} [together with]{.underline} Japan and
the Republic of [Korea has forged a partnership for peace and
stability]{.underline} from the Korean Peninsula to the Taiwan Strait
and become an engine of economic and technological progress, said
Secretary Blinken:

"I believe it\'s in the strategic interest of each of our countries, not
just to sustain this trilateral **[cooperation]{.underline}**, but to
[grow it in the years ahead]{.underline}, particularly in an era when
security in the Indo-Pacific and Europe is increasingly intertwined."

Secretary Blinken warned about the growing military cooperation between
North Korea and Russia. Indeed, in the last week of December, more than
1000 North Korean forces were killed and or wounded in the war in
Ukraine.

"The DPRK is already receiving Russian military equipment and training.
Now we have reason to believe that Moscow intends to share advanced
space and satellite technology with Pyongyang and that \[Vladimir\]
Putin may be close to reversing a decades long policy by Russia and
accepting DPRK nuclear weapons program."

The [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is now So]{.underline}uth
[Ko]{.underline}rea[\'s]{.underline} second [**largest investor** and
largest goods exports market]{.underline}. In turn, South Korea has
become a leading investor in the United States, committing more than
\$140 billion since 2021, from semiconductor plants in Michigan to solar
facilities in Georgia.

The [U.S.-South Korea relationship]{.underline} is
[grounded]{.underline} not just [in]{.underline} economic or security
interests, but in our [shared democratic values]{.underline}, said
Secretary Blinken. "I remain fully, strongly optimistic that the United
States and South Korea will continue to go together into a future of our
own making."

#### Cooperation has never been better.

On the eve of a presidential election that could decide the fate of the
[U.S]{.underline}. alliance system, America's security [partnership
with]{.underline} the Republic of Korea ([ROK]{.underline}) [has never
been **stronger** and more able to **deter** North Korea or, failing
that, to defeat **aggression**]{.underline}.

[So]{.underline}uth [Ko]{.underline}rea [is a **key pillar** of the U.S.
alliance network]{.underline} in the Indo-Pacific region, [a
long-standing and trusted ally]{.underline}, and [a beacon of democracy,
freedom, and economic growth]{.underline}. South Korea's rise to success
was in no small measure due to America's investment of blood and
treasure, for which the Korean people remain deeply grateful. Today, the
[alliance deters North Korea and provides cost-free facilities that
facilitate U.S. regional military operations]{.underline} and allow the
United States to send an important message of deterrence to China,
Russia, and other potential adversaries.

However, North Korea's nuclear capabilities, a dangerous North
Korea-Russia "comprehensive strategic partnership," and a U.S.
presidential candidate who has questioned the value of the U.S.-Korea
military partnership have shaken South Korea's confidence in the future
of the alliance. In many Koreans' eyes, both the fate of the alliance
and Korea's security are at stake in this U.S. presidential election.

[**Stronger** than ever]{.underline}

America's [alliance with South]{.underline} [Korea]{.underline} is
[more]{.underline} capable and [interoperable than ever]{.underline}.
U.S. and ROK alliance managers [have never been more in
sync]{.underline}, including in their assessments of the North Korean
threat and their concern about China's ambitions, Russia's aggression
against Ukraine, Moscow's new military ties with North Korea, and the
Russia-China "partnership without limits."

ROK President Yoon Suk Yeol has moved Korea closer to the United States
while holding China at arm's length. Yoon has responded positively to
Washington's urging to work more cooperatively with Japan---America's
other key East Asian ally. Yoon and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio
Kishida have deftly managed Korea-Japan differences and forged a solid
bilateral relationship. Today, South Korea, Japan, and the United States
have built an important trilateral [partnership, including on security
issues, fulfilling a long-standing U.S. goal]{.underline}. Nevertheless,
progress in stabilizing South Korea-Japan ties remains fragile, and
shifts in domestic political winds or leadership in either Seoul or
Tokyo could result in new or revived tensions.

### UQ---Alliance High---Arctic 

#### They're cooperating in the Arctic.

**Suk-yee '25** \[Jung; March 3; coverage is heavily data-focused and
centers on the Korean economy, financial markets, investments, foreign
trade, and the banking sector; Business Korea, "South Korea-U.S. Task
Force to Enhance Shipbuilding Cooperation Amid Rising Arctic Demands,"
https://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=236532;
accessed: 7.14.25\]

A [pan-governmental task force for **So**uth **Ko**rea-U.S.
**shipbuilding** cooperation]{.underline}, involving the Ministry of
Trade, Industry and Energy, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the
Ministry of National Defense, is set to be fully operational as early as
this week. This comes after the first meeting between the South Korean
and U.S. industry ministers [since the inauguration of the second Trump
administration, reaffirming the need for **shipbuilding cooperation**
between the two countries and continuing specific **discussions**
through working-level channels]{.underline}. Notably, during Minister
Ahn Duk-geun\'s visit to the U.S. at the end of last month, the U.S.
reportedly added LNG carriers and icebreakers, which can be used in the
Arctic route area, to the cooperation list beyond naval ships. The South
Korean government is said to have proposed prioritizing the production
of U.S. orders if the U.S. places \"package orders\" for warships,
tankers, and icebreakers.

[Korean government officials say that the U.S. interest in
**icebreakers** is greater than expected]{.underline}. The [Trump
administration\'s plan is to]{.underline} resolve inflation and energy
security issues simultaneously by [extracting **LNG** stored in
**Alaska** and supplying it to major cities in the U.S. and **allied
countries**]{.underline}.

Domestic shipbuilders have already proven their capabilities in this
field. Hanwha Ocean (formerly Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering)
and Samsung Heavy Industries have experience in building icebreaking LNG
carriers and icebreaking tankers, respectively. The medium-sized
shipbuilder HJ Shipbuilding & Construction (formerly Hanjin Heavy
Industries) was responsible for the design and construction of South
Korea\'s only icebreaking research vessel, the \"Araon,\" launched in
2009. It can carry up to 85 researchers and crew members and break
through 1-meter-thick ice while traveling between the Antarctic and
Arctic.

However, the construction of South Korea\'s next-generation 16,560-ton
icebreaking research vessel has faced repeated delays, casting
uncertainty over its planned 2027 launch. Budgetary constraints have
pushed the timeline further, with a 2030 launch now in question.
Meanwhile, China has launched its first domestically built icebreaker,
the Xuelong 2, intensifying competition in Arctic route development.

The U.S. Navy\'s ambitious plan to invest an average of \$30 billion
annually until 2054 to build 364 new ships highlights the need for
international cooperation. With only 21 shipyards remaining from a peak
of 414, the U.S. shipbuilding industry faces significant challenges. Han
Seung-han, an analyst at SK Securities, noted, \"[For the U.S. to
control the **Northwest Passage**, possessing **icebreakers** is a
**prerequisite**, but due to the decline of the shipbuilding industry
and lack of capabilities, building icebreakers in the short term is
realistically difficult for the U.S]{.underline}.\"

[South Korea\'s proposal to **prioritize U.S. orders** if \"package
orders\" for warships, tankers, and icebreakers are placed,
**underscores** the **strategic alliance** between the two
nations]{.underline}. This partnership is further emphasized by the
Trump administration\'s focus on resolving inflation and energy security
issues by extracting LNG from Alaska and supplying it to major cities in
the U.S. and allied countries.

While domestic shipbuilders have experience in building icebreakers,
industry watchers warn that the [potential for **inter-departmental
disagreements** or budgetary issues within South Korea could
**jeopardize** Korea-U.S. **cooperation**]{.underline}. An industry
insider warned, \"Japan is set to complete the next-generation
icebreaking research vessel \'Mirai II\' by November next year. If there
is noise due to inter-departmental disagreements or budget allocations
within South Korea, it could cause the U.S. to change its partner.\"

development]{.underline}, the [US is fundamentally altering the
**traditional governance** dynamics where Arctic states maintained
**primary control** over regional resources and
development]{.underline}. The proposed Alaska LNG project represents
more than just energy infrastructure -- it creates lasting economic
partnerships that give non-Arctic nations vested interests in Arctic
policies and governance decisions. As climate change makes Arctic
resources more accessible, projects like this pipeline establish
precedents for how external powers can secure long-term access to the
region's energy wealth. However, these expanding partnerships expose the
inadequacy of current Arctic governance structures, which were designed
primarily for the eight [Arctic states and struggle to accommodate the
**growing influence** of economically invested non-Arctic nations in

President Donald Trump is re-elected this November, said Fred Fleitz,
vice chairman of the America First Policy Institute (AFPI) Center for
American Security. Fleitz is considered a potential U.S. National
Security Advisor candidate if Trump wins the presidential election.

Fleitz addressed concerns about a second Trump administration at a panel
hosted by the Sejong Institute in South Korea on July 9. Regarding
[Trump's previous comments on withdrawing its troops from South
Korea]{.underline}, Fleitz said, "The [situation with **China**,
**Russia**, and **No**rth **Ko**rea has changed since the **first**
Trump **administration**]{.underline}." He cited the rise of [Xi
Jinping's **authoritarianism** in China, Russia's invasion of
**Ukraine** and North Korea's **strengthening ties** with Russia as such
changes]{.underline}.

"Trump's [re-election will have a **positive impact** on South Korea's
**security**]{.underline}," he said. He explained that [South Korea's
**strategic importance** in the current geopolitical landscape has
become more pronounced compared to Trump's first term]{.underline} in
2017 to 2021, making the idea of [reducing U.S. forces in the region
**inconceivable**]{.underline}.

This is the first time a key figure in Trump's campaign has explicitly
denied the possibility of pulling out or reducing U.S. troops in South
Korea. Fleitz focused on easing concerns related to Trump's possible
return to office during the two-hour panel. He also mentioned that he
was not speaking for Trump, but offering his own assessment.

"[**Defense cost-sharing** negotiations between the U.S. and South Korea
will not be as **difficult** in a second Trump
administration]{.underline}," he said. During his presidency, Trump had
previously demanded a five-fold increase in South Korea's share of U.S.
defense costs.

He said that a second Trump administration is likely to appoint a
special envoy to North Korea to re-engage in dialogue with North Korean
leader Kim Jong Un. "But unlike in the first term, the second Trump
administration will go through intensive consultations with Japan and
South Korea, probably Taiwan among U.S. allies in advance," Fleitz said.
He expects the [Trump administration to engage in **frequent calls** and
**conversations** with President Yoon Suk Yeol about North
Korea]{.underline}.

The Constitutional Court's decision on impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol

Korea that has ground the government to a halt. While the decision
closes one chapter, it opens another one of bitter polarization and
political infighting. The biggest casualty of this unprecedented
domestic crisis, however, may be happening across the Pacific. The
confluence of months-long political stasis in Seoul and the start of the
second Trump administration has precipitated a [quiet crisis in the
U.S.-Korea alliance that neither side will admit to.]{.underline}

Defense Secretary Pete [Hegseth's]{.underline} first trip to [reaffirm
U.S. defense commitments with Indo-Pacific allies]{.underline} last week
[noticeably skipped South Korea]{.underline}. The apparent reason was
tha[t it made no sense to meet with his counterpart or the acting
president]{.underline}, both of whom would not be in office in a couple
of months. This [bypassing of the key U.S. ally takes place at a time
when]{.underline} Donald [Trump talks]{.underline} openly about meeting
again [with Kim Jong-un a]{.underline}nd refers casually to the North
Korean leader as "a nuclear power," suggesting that [the United States
has given up on denuclearization]{.underline}. Indeed, like [he has done
with]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir [Putin]{.underline} and
Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, [Trump displays a tendency to
**negotiate with adversaries first**]{.underline} and [then present a
fait accompli deal to allies.]{.underline} By contrast, [Trump has shown
no interest in talking with the interim head of state in the
South]{.underline}, which is understandable given that any agreement
reached with the acting government in Seoul wouldn't be worth its weight
in paper given the impeachment crisis at home.

[Trump's]{.underline} breakneck [pace]{.underline} of rolling out new
policies comes at a time when South Korea cannot respond to any of them.
[Following the 25 percent tariffs]{.underline} on steel and aluminum,
which took effect on March 12, the total value of South Korea's steel
exports in March declined by 10.6 percent year-on-year. The 25 percent
tariffs on the Mexico automotive sector are expected to cause a Korean
automative export decline of 7--13 percent. The 25 percent tariffs on
all foreign cars and the 25 percent reciprocal tariffs on all Korean
exports to the United States only adds to the burden. In his Joint
Address to Congress, [Trump singled out South Korea as having an average
tariff rate "four times higher" than those of the United
States]{.underline} (which was technically incorrect, as the free trade
agreement between the United States and Korea effectively sets the
average tariff rate at 0.79 percent). But South Korea's \$66 billion
trade surplus puts the country in Trump's crosshairs of "unfair" trading
partners. While other world leaders like Justin Trudeau, Claudia
Sheinbaum, Shigeru Ishiba, Narendra Modi, Emmanuel Macron, and Keir
Starmer have made initial visits with Trump to kiss the ring and to cut
deals for tariff exemptions, the impeachment crisis has left South Korea
leaderless to do the same. Bureaucrats and business leaders have come to
D.C. to try to fill the void, albeit unsuccessfully.

Meanwhile, [Trump continues to plow ahead with more policies likely to
have major impact on Korea]{.underline}. As the Pentagon under Hegseth
[moves to realign military force postures]{.underline} in the
Indo-Pacific to better counter the threat from China, [Korea may see
changes to the U.S. troop deployments on the peninsula]{.underline}, [as
well as demands that Seoul accept that the revised force presence be
"strategically flexible"]{.underline} to move off the peninsula in case
of a Taiwan fight---something Koreans have long resisted for fear of
being entrapped in a U.S.-China war. During his first term, the
president also made hay over South Korea's failure to sufficiently
contribute to the costs of the U.S. presence in Korea, and he is likely
to throw away Biden's five-year burden-sharing deal (ending in 2030) and
try to squeeze additional billions more annually from the ally.

[Trump is moving at 100 miles per hour while the leaderless South
Koreans are stuck in neutral.]{.underline} Even a relatively minor issue
like the Department of Energy's listing of South Korea on the "Sensitive
and Other Designated Countries List (SCL)" proved to be a major
embarrassment for the rudderless alliance. Both sides were completely
caught off guard by the decision, which was made late in the Biden
administration when neither side was paying attention. And the absence
of a leader in South Korea to request a call with Trump to resolve this
quickly allows the issue to fester.

The [only foreign policy issue in South Korea]{.underline}, meanwhile,
[that is **gaining momentum** is one that is not in U.S.
interests]{.underline}---that is, **[the growing calls for going
nuclear]{.underline}**. The [combination of North Korea's unchecked
nuclear buildup and **uncertainty** about Trump's commitment to South
Korea's defense has led to a groundswell of calls for South Korea's
nuclearization.]{.underline} According to recent polls, [**66 percent of
South Koreans support** their country going nuclear.]{.underline}
Prominent Korean [political leaders in both the conservative and
progressive camps have not ruled out such policies, with some openly
supporting them.]{.underline}

South Korea enters the next phase of its political crisis this week,
[but by the time the crisis is resolved and a leader is in
place,]{.underline} the damage to the alliance may be beyond repair.

High anxiety

[Despite a reinvigorated bilateral alliance and strong U.S.
assurances]{.underline}, [South Korea remains **anxious**]{.underline}
about the alliance's future. [Concerns that Pyongyang's nuclear arsenal
is now a]{.underline} permanent [threat, and]{.underline} that [the
Russia-North Korea partnership]{.underline} has [created a]{.underline}
serious **[new threat]{.underline}**, are contributing to this anxiety.

But the [main factor troubling South Koreans is the belief that Trump's
return]{.underline} to the White House [would end]{.underline} the
[Biden]{.underline} administration's [alliance-strengthening
approach,]{.underline} bring renewed anti-alliance rhetoric and massive
burden-sharing demands, and even see a reduction in U.S. forces on the
Korean Peninsula. Such concerns have fueled a lively debate in South
Korea about the need to acquire its own nuclear weapons---a debate that
has been spurred by former Trump administration officials who have
proposed downsizing the U.S. military presence and shifting the U.S.
military's mission away from the defense of Korea.

As a result, the [Biden]{.underline} administration has [further
strengthened the U.S. commitment, including with an agreement to
regularize the deployment of U.S. strategic assets to Korea. This new
agreement should ease ROK concerns, but we should not underestimate the
strength of pro-nuclear sentiment in South Korea, especially if
Washington decides to distance itself from its longtime
ally.]{.underline}

At the same time, the chances that [a conservative South Korean
government will embark on the nuclear weapons route are also currently
zero. Policy makers are aware of the serious consequences their country
would face]{.underline} -- harsh economic and political sanctions, [the
end of the US-South Korea alliance, the inability to sell nuclear power
plants overseas, and the]{.underline} required [withdrawal
from]{.underline} key [international agreements,]{.underline} including
the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.

In the meantime, [however]{.underline}, [as long as there is no
resolution to the North Korean nuclear issue, South Korean]{.underline}
indigenous [nuclear weapons supporters will continue to express their
demands,]{.underline} which are motivated by five general objectives
(Einhorn and Kim 2016)[. They seek **more credible deterrence,** so that
South Korea **can rely on the United States in a crisis.**]{.underline}
[They want to correct what they see as a critical asymmetry between the
two Koreas, so South Korea has leverage to negotiate with Pyongyang on
mutual reductions in and eventual elimination of nuclear
arsenals.]{.underline} Third, they aim to pressure Beijing and
Washington to each exert enough pressure to "force" Pyongyang's nuclear
surrender. Also, [some conservative politicians hope to score political
points domestically by demonstrating resolve to "do something" in the
face of a growing North Korean nuclear challenge. And finally, they are
expressing widespread **frustration and fear of
abandonment,**]{.underline} a sentiment felt by both conservatives and
progressives in opinion polls, [about Washington's failure to rein in
Pyongyang's strategic weapons programs and the **possibility that the US
would not defend South Korea in a crisis.**]{.underline}

[While]{.underline} many [decision makers]{.underline} still
[believe]{.underline} that [the best course is to rely on the extended
deterrence]{.underline} provided [by the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates nuclear umbrella, [a growing number are quietly
**contemplating** the alternatives]{.underline}. During a recent speech
at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington,
[former South Korean Foreign Minister Song]{.underline} Min-soon
[said]{.underline} that "[the Republic of Korea taking its own measures
to create a nuclear balance on the peninsula" was a "widely touted"
option. Such a statement is strong evidence of just how far moderate
proponents of nonproliferation have shifted]{.underline}. [The reason
for this shift is]{.underline} that today, [South Koreans
cast]{.underline} a much **[more doubtful eye]{.underline}** [toward the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [security guarantee than
ever.]{.underline} In particular, [more conservatives,]{.underline} who
are traditionally reliably US-friendly, [do not hide their
**uneasiness** about]{.underline} President [Trump]{.underline}. [Many
were offended when,]{.underline} at a rally earlier this year, [Trump
brought up the issue of the burden-sharing arrangement for US personnel
in South Korea]{.underline} and mocked that, "\[i\]t was easier to get a
billion dollars from South Korea than to get \$114.13 from a
rent-controlled apartment in Brooklyn." [More offensive]{.underline},
though, [is]{.underline} that [Trump]{.underline} has conspicuously
[tolerated North Korean missile tests that]{.underline} directly
[threaten South Korea]{.underline}, which hosts the third-largest
contingent of overseas US troops as well as a US anti-ballistic missile
defense system and is one of the world's biggest buyers of US arms. [The
more Trump brags about the letters from Kim Jong-un, the more he
alienates an ally.]{.underline} Even [moderate South Koreans see Trump's
approach to the alliance as extremely petty and bigoted]{.underline}. In
sum, [his flagrant disregard for the traditional alliance **undermines**
the credibility of extended deterrence and has made South Koreans
**pessimistic** about their continued dependence upon the United
States.]{.underline} Many Americans, even in [the administration, know
all of this.]{.underline} In September, US Special Representative for
North Korea Stephen Biegun rhetorically asked, "at what point will
voices in South Korea or Japan and elsewhere in Asia begin to ask if
they need to be considering their own nuclear capabilities?"
[Unfortunately, though, little is being done to assuage South Korean
concerns.]{.underline}

A Korean American [congresswoman]{.underline} on Thursday [called for
strengthening the trilateral **So**uth **Ko**rea-**U.S.**-Japan
partnership in the face of what she called an **\"unholy
alliance\"**]{.underline} among [North Korea, China and Russia that
threatens a free and open Indo-Pacific]{.underline}.

Rep. Young Kim made the call in a video message during the Korean
Peninsula Symposium, hosted by Yonhap News Agency, on Thursday, noting
the [deepening **military ties** between North Korea and Russia through
the war in **Ukraine** and China\'s increasing military exercises around
**Taiwan**]{.underline}.

\"[We are living in unprecedented times]{.underline}, with North Korea,
China and Russia\'s unholy alliance threatening a democratic, free and
open Indo-Pacific,\" she said. \"[Now is not the time to pursue a policy
of **appeasement** with our **adversaries**]{.underline}. [We know that
this approach has **failed** with **No**rth **Ko**rea]{.underline}.\"

\"But the time is ripe to promote peace through strength. [We must
leverage our **bilateral** and **multilateral partnerships** in the
Indo-Pacific region to advocate and advance our **security**, economic
and people-to-people ties]{.underline}.\"

Kim stressed the [need to maintain **security cooperation** among Seoul,
Washington and Tokyo]{.underline}, noting the \"historic\" progress made
in recent years.

\"We must [**ensure** the **partnership** only **strengthens** across
administrations]{.underline},\" she said.

Seoul has recently pushed to bolster trilateral security cooperation
with Washington and Tokyo to better deter North Korea\'s evolving
nuclear and missile threats amid an intensifying U.S.-China rivalry.

President Lee Jae Myung, who took office earlier this month, has
reaffirmed his commitment to strengthening the three-way cooperation,
while also seeking to improve ties with Pyongyang under a pledge to
pursue \"pragmatic\" diplomacy.

Kim, who serves as the chair of the East Asia and the Pacific
Subcommittee, said she looked forward to engaging with the new
administration, noting the [**alliance** between the United States and
South Korea is \"**more important than ever**]{.underline}.\"

#### Perception Link---any signal of US Abandonment pushes allies to proliferate

U.S. [extended deterrence]{.underline} in the Asia Pacific has
historically aimed not only to [deter U.S. adversaries​,​ such as China
and the DPRK​,​ from engaging in conventional or nuclear attacks on U.S.
regional allies, but also to **disincentivize** allies from acquiring an
independent nuclear capability]{.underline}. The [potential for allied
nuclear armament has recently made headlines]{.underline}, with
[prominent politicians in the region **raising questions about the
continued credibility** of the U.S. nuclear umbrella]{.underline} ​​and,
in some cases, openly endorsing the need for an indigenous nuclear
weapons program.

How the U.S. should interpret and respond to these challenges was a
topic of discussion at the April 2025 "Strengthening Deterrence in the
Indo-Pacific" workshop, facilitated by the Center for Global Security
Research at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). This essay
analyzes the potential for allied armament in [South Korea and
**Japan**, including **drivers of regional proliferation**, the current
state of public and elite opinion in both countries, and how the United
States should respond]{.underline}. While this paper draws on insights
from the recent LLNL workshop, the opinions presented are the author's
own and do not represent any organization.

The Regional Deterrence Architecture and Drivers of Proliferation

The [U.S. deterrence architecture in the Asia Pacific is focused on
**bilateral** partnerships with key allies]{.underline} -- principally,
[Australia, Japan, and South Korea]{.underline}. [Maintaining a forward
U.S. presence is necessary to **signal a robust commitment to**
allies]{.underline},​​ force adversaries to engage the U.S. early in
conflict, and deny adversaries an outright advantage. The [existing
deterrence architecture is designed to convince ​​adversaries, including
China, the DPRK, and R​​ussia, that violence against allies will incur
costs that exceed benefits and risk greater war]{.underline}.

Increasingly, this [architecture has **come under strain**. Gaps in the
regional deterrence architecture, along with advances in adversaries'
conventional and nuclear capabilities, **threaten the credibility** of
the U.S. extended deterrent and ​​may, in turn, **increase allies'
incentives to proliferate**]{.underline}. The [United States must now
contend with the possibility of conflict with two nuclear
peers]{.underline}, China and Russia, with China expected to reach
nuclear parity with the U.S. by 2035. The possibility of simultaneous
engagement extends to the DPRK, which may initiate a crisis on the
Korean Peninsula as a distraction or leverage an ongoing regional
conflict to pursue its territorial aims. The increasing
political-military alignment between Russia and China, as well as Russia
and the DPRK, makes this problem more urgent.

Additionally, the U.S. nuclear foundation faces external stress due to
an increase in targets that must be held at risk, including hardened and
mobile targets, and the "tyranny of distance" in deploying nuclear
weapons from the U.S. to the region. The foundation is also under
internal stress as the entire strategic force undergoes modernization,
including nuclear command and control. These stressors may impact allied
perceptions of U.S. political and technical credibility, including
whether the U.S. will be able to successfully complete its modernization
program and deliver all necessary capabilities.

Recent [U.S. policy positions have also **elicited concern** from
regional allies]{.underline}. [Washington has pressured its regional
allies to take on more of the **burden for their defense**, including
linking defense cost-sharing to broader trade disputes]{.underline}. The
[Trump administration has previously floated the potential of removing
U.S. troops]{.underline} from the region if cost-sharing expectations
are not met. Additionally, shifting positions on the U.S. approach to
the DPRK have raised alarm with South Korean policymakers. Both
President Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth have publicly
referred to North Korea as a "nuclear power," potentially legitimizing
the DPRK's nuclear weapons status. At his confirmation hearing, U.S.
Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Elbridge Colby further emphasized
the need to restructure U.S. Forces Korea to focus primarily on threats
posed by China rather than the DPRK.

As with [U.S. NATO allies, allies in the Asia Pacific are likely to
tolerate and, in some cases, embrace moderate pressure from the United
States to increase defense spending and burden sharing. However,
**stronger signals of U.S. abandonment**]{.underline}, such as the
removal of U.S. troops from the Korean peninsula or U.S. abandonment of
Taiwan, [are **likely to incentivize allied
proliferation**]{.underline}.

### Link---Arctic 

#### The Arctic is the [key frontier]{.underline} for the U.S-ROK alliance. Lee's 'staked his [political future]{.underline}' on [developing the Arctic]{.underline} but needs the U.S. to [follow through]{.underline}.

The [allure of **Arctic shipping** and South Korea's role in it has
taken **center stage** in the country's **presidential
election**]{.underline}.

Democratic party presidential candidate, [**Lee** Jae-myung, has
**staked** his **political future** on reviving the country's **southern
port cities**]{.underline}, [including Busan and Ulsan, including
transforming them into gateways for **Arctic maritime
trade**]{.underline}.

Lee [has closely tied the **economic future** of the country's southern
ports to the opportunities arising from Arctic shipping]{.underline}.

"The [economy is facing headwinds]{.underline}, the population is
shrinking, and youth is leaving. Shouldn't we find an alternative?
Today, I've brought such an alternative. The [Arctic route is opening
up]{.underline}," Lee announced during a campaign rally in Busan earlier
this month.

[**Shipping data** confirm the country's **strategic location** with
much of the traffic from Russia's Northern Sea Route passing near South
Korea]{.underline}. A number of recent voyages, including container ship
traffic from China to Russia via the Arctic, made stops at South Korean
ports.

Competing with China and Japan

Unlike other Asian countries, including parts of China, located too far
to the south to fundamentally benefit from the distance savings of
Arctic shipping routes, [South Korea's position further north could
allow it to **profit** from the **polar shortcuts**]{.underline}.

Lee's efforts are also [underscored by regional power
dynamics]{.underline}, [with both **China** and **Japan** similarly
positioned vis-à-vis the **Arctic**]{.underline}.

"[Japan and China have already made preparations. And we should be doing
the same --- but we\'re **falling behind**]{.underline}," Lee warned
during the same political speech.

[South Korea already maintains a **key role** in **Arctic shipping** via
its **shipbuilding** prowess]{.underline}. Much of the specialized fleet
of ice-capable oil tankers and liquefied natural gas carriers, has been
built by South Korean industrial powerhouses Hanwha Ocean and Samsung
Heavy Industries.

Over the past decade the yards have completed more than two dozen
vessels with high ice-class, among them the fifteen Arc7 LNG carriers
used by Russia's Yamal gas project.

Arctic shipping as economic driver

For Lee, the [potential of Arctic shipping ties **directly** into
reviving the **industrial activity** in the country's southern region,
where shipbuilding, logistics, and maritime trade have long been the
economic driver]{.underline}.

[Why not use this established expertise in Arctic shipping to further
expand South Korea's role in the region]{.underline}, the presidential
candidate asked earlier this month.

"[Development of the Arctic Route is also another
opportunity]{.underline}. Due to global warming, the navigation period
of the Arctic Route is increasing and the volume of cargo is also
increasing. As such, there is a high possibility that new demand will be
created in the shipbuilding industry," the presidential candidate
announced in a social media post on March 21st.

"[It may take time and there are many tasks to solve, but let\'s just
imagine that the cargo spreads across the world through the Arctic
routes]{.underline}," he continued.

As a concrete step to boosting the region, Lee proposed the relocation
of the headquarters of HMM, the country's largest container shipping
operator, and the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries to the port of Busan.

[Lee's vision for South Korea's role in Arctic maritime trade takes a
page out of President **Trump's playbook** who has also been looking to
strengthen **U.S. shipbuilding** and re-establish the country's
**maritime dominance**]{.underline}.

"[In this process, the **geopolitical value** of the Korean Peninsula,
which connects the continent and the ocean, will increase even more, and
the **Korea-US alliance** will be further strengthened **based** on the
**shipbuilding industry alliance**]{.underline}."

[engaging]{.underline} with them in political-military [frameworks such
as]{.underline} NATO's IP4[, the US-ROK-Japan alliance]{.underline}, the
QUAD,82 or bilateral security partnerships, may not be the ideal path
forward. As we have seen, US Indo-Pacific [partners with

[they **may not want** to directly engage with the US on **difficult
security issues** in the Arctic for fear of
**exacerbating**]{.underline} the [security threats they face
alread]{.underline}y. Moreover, from their respective geographic
positions, participation in the NSR has required some form of engagement
with Russia, its gatekeeper. To be sure, [US Indo-Pacific partners
monitor Sino-Russian joint patrols]{.underline} in the Bering Strait and
the Baltic Sea closely, and view them with concern, [just as the US
does. Nevertheless, China's challenge to the region in the near term
centers more on its strategic investments]{.underline}, its ability to
deploy dual-use technologies, and interest in participating in regional
rule-making---[all better suited to non-military responses by the US and

influence. The most challenging issue for South Korea would be
determining the roles of USFK and the ROK military in a Taiwan

particular, have long harbored fear about U.S. abandonment dating to the
1949 withdrawal of U.S. military personnel]{.underline}, followed
shortly thereafter by the North Korean invasion that catalyzed the
1950-1953 Korean War.

In Seoul, there has been growing interest in and public support for
nuclear weapons for over a decade, well before Trump was even a likely
political candidate. South Korean political conservatives are the most
vocal champions of a domestic nuclear weapons program, but Trump's
behavior may give progressives reason to reconsider their skepticism.
For now, there is a growing movement for nuclear "latency" (called the
Mugunghwa Forum), whereby South Korea would accumulate the additional
capabilities necessary for producing nuclear weapons should it decide to
build them in the future.9

Nuclear latency advocates are urging the South Korean government to
negotiate with the United States for permission to develop uranium
enrichment and plutonium reprocessing capabilities, first by upgrading
the existing South Korean-U.S. nuclear cooperation agreement. This is
highly likely to be a key item on Seoul's wish list as South Korean and
U.S. officials sort through alliance, security, and trade issues.

The [real wild card pertains to the Trump administration's
**intentions** regarding the U.S. defense posture and **extended
deterrence** commitments]{.underline}. If Trump seeks to withdraw U.S.
forces stationed on the Korean peninsula, then South Korean leaders
might feel forced to proceed with a nuclear weapons effort, despite the
challenges they would likely encounter.

Japan in many ways occupies a more difficult position: With a capable
but constrained self-defense force, it is more reliant on U.S. extended
deterrence despite its security and territorial issues with China, North
Korea, and Russia. Tokyo has fewer immediate options to remedy U.S.
retrenchment, apart from building nuclear weapons, which it likely could
achieve faster than South Korea but which would be far more politically
complicated given the strong Japanese pro-disarmament movement. Tokyo
seems likely to continue efforts to stay out of Trump's firing line and
not give him any reason to consider abandonment.

[As the implications of Trump's **shift** toward **Russia**]{.underline}
become clear, the [**potential effects** in Asia seem likely to boil
down to the issue of **linkage**]{.underline}. In the past, Russia has
proved willing to use its influence to further nonproliferation goals,
as it did during negotiations with Iran leading to the 2015 nuclear
agreement. However, if transactional politics dominate in the absence of
a broader Russian-U.S. strategic alignment, [**Moscow** will be less
willing to use its **influence** with China or North Korea in ways that
could **benefit** the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}.10 [At least,
not without extracting a **price**]{.underline}. [Whether that price
includes a **reduction** in the U.S. **defense posture** in Asia,
negotiated without the **input** of U.S. **allies**, will be a
**critical determinant** of the future number of nuclear-armed states in
the region]{.underline}.

#### They fear being sidelined by Trump-Putin cooperation.

Donald [Trump]{.underline} is [busily **ingratiating** himself with
Vladimir **Putin** and is ever-so-casually **withdrawing** US
**support** for Ukraine]{.underline}. And [Asia looks on,
**anxiously**]{.underline}.

An analytical piece in Singapore's The Straits Times, says that as
[concerns mount that Trump might "**sell out**" Ukraine, nowhere is the
fear of being victims of **US-Russia power plays** more keenly felt than
on the **Korean Peninsula**]{.underline} -- with the south under the US
sphere of influence and the north aligned with Russia.

"Both are [worried that in Mr Trump's and Mr Putin's **desire** to
**strike** a **broader deal**, their **interests** will end up
**sacrificed**]{.underline}," says the author, senior columnist Lin
Suling.

Pyongyang last year forged a strategic partnership -- a defence pact,
security co-operation and the supply of arms, ammunition and solders --
with Russia. This gave it heft in international affairs.

North Korea's involvement in the Ukraine war may now be a bargaining
chip that Putin could trade away, Lin says. "If the war in Ukraine ends,
Russia has no need for North Korean munitions or cannon fodder," she
says. "That would leave North Korea back at square one."

And this would be a starting point for talks between the US and North
Korea. Trump, she says, recently made comments recognising that North
Korea is a nuclear power -- although it is not yet policy.

In South Korea, the mood is strikingly sombre. [As Trump can be
**unpredictable**, and adopts a **transactional approach** to **foreign
policy**, fears grow that South Korea might be sidelined]{.underline}.

#### The plan signals we won't honor defense pacts with South Korea.

But [an even deeper concern is **structural**]{.underline}: [Would a
Trump administration truly come to **Korea's defense** in a conflict
with the North]{.underline}? [Amid doubts about U.S. **commitments** to
**NATO** and **Ukraine**]{.underline}, [South Koreans are watching
closely Trump's **negotiations** with **Russia**]{.underline}. The
[result in Seoul has been a reanimation of **domestic debates** over
**nuclear self-reliance**]{.underline}. Polls show strong public support
for a domestic nuclear option---whether redeployment of U.S. tactical
nuclear weapons or pursuit of their own indigenous capability, contra
Seoul's NPT obligations. The full cost of the political and financial
risks may be underestimated in Korea, and many proponents of the nuclear
option in Seoul believe Trump might carve out exceptions for South
Korea. While the Yoon administration had tempered these discussions
through mechanisms such as the Nuclear Consultative Group with the Biden
administration in 2023, the debate remains far from settled among Korean
strategic thinkers and politicians.

#### Doubling down on pro-Russian stances causes South Korean prolif.

On February 28, what should have been a routine diplomatic event in the
Oval Office of the White House turned into a debacle. As media cameras
broadcast the event live, U.S. [President Donald **Trump** and Vice
President J.D. **Vance** berated and belittled Ukrainian President
Volodymyr **Zelenskyy**]{.underline}.

The world witnessed how Trump and Vance coerced Zelenskyy to publicly
thank Trump for the military support Ukraine has received, although
Ukraine's leader had already mentioned multiple times how he is grateful
on behalf of the Ukrainian people for the support provided by the U.S.
and other countries. Trump and Vance pressured the president of Ukraine
to accept a minerals deal when Zelenskyy repeatedly asked Washington to
provide security guarantees -- which is the primary factor that is
needed for Ukraine to end the war.

"You don't have the cards right now," he said during the verbal clashes
with Zelenskyy. It was a visceral demonstration of how Trump handles
diplomacy.

Former U.S. President Joe Biden had showed unwavering support to Ukraine
since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, but now U.S.
President Donald Trump has reportedly halted military support to Kyiv.

As [Trump's "**America First**" approach heavily emphasizes the
**economic interests** of the United States]{.underline}, its
conventional approach to diplomacy stemming from its role as the "world
police" will likely be weakened during the second Trump administration.
In other words, the [United States seems to be ready to accept a
**multipolar world** in which it is no longer a **superpower**
dominating the international orders]{.underline}. With this move, the
European nations will have to form a new defense coalition that can
function without the U.S.

[Assuming Trump's **undiplomatic approach** becomes
**consolidated**]{.underline}, [possibly even **outlasting** the end of
his term, the United States' **allies** and like-minded countries will
need to **recalibrate** their **policies** on regional conflicts and
security issues]{.underline}. [Based on the **Ukraine** example, the
U.S. will not **support its allies** unless Trump sees a clear
**economic benefit** to doing so]{.underline}.

Leaders on both sides of the DMZ separating the Korean Peninsula are
watching these developments closely.

Ever since Russia invaded Ukraine, many experts have argued that Russian
President Vladimir Putin would have not conducted the "special military
operation" if Kyiv had not given up its nuclear weapons in the wake of
the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991. Ukraine ceded its nuclear
arsenal in return for security guarantees, but now faces the real
prospect of losing nearly one-third of its territory to an invasion by
its neighbor. For North Korea, the lesson is clear: nuclear weapons are
the only real security guarantee. Pyongyang will likely not consider
giving up its nuclear weapons preemptively.

Likewise, the [abandonment of **Ukraine** will also add **strong
motivation** for South Korea to think more seriously about developing
its own **nuc**lear weapon**s** rather than relying on the strategic
assets of the U.S]{.underline}.

Ahead of the "Freedom Shield" joint military drills between South Korea
and the U.S. this month, the U.S. Navy's nuclear-powered aircraft
carrier Carl Vinson arrived in South Korea's territorial waters in
Busan. As every South Korea-U.S. joint military exercise is interpreted
as an invasion rehearsal by the Kim regime, Kim Yo Jong, the powerful
sister of North Korea's top leader, denounced the drills through the
North's state-controlled Korean Central News Agency.

"The action-accompanied hostile policy toward the DPRK pursued by the
U.S. at present is offering sufficient justification for the DPRK to
indefinitely bolster up its nuclear war deterrent," Kim said. (DPRK is
the acronym of North Korea's official name: Democratic People's Republic
of Korea.) "If the U.S. continues to renew its records in the anti-DPRK
military demonstration, the DPRK will be naturally compelled to renew
its records in the exercise of strategic deterrence."

Since the breakdown of the 2019 Hanoi summit between Trump and North
Korean leader Kim Jong Un, more and more South Koreans have supported
their country acquiring indigenous nuclear weapons. Under the Biden
administration, Washington sought to soothe South Koreans' anxiety by
assuring that its nuclear weapons will be used should North Korea attack
South Korea under the name of "extended deterrence," and expanding joint
planning on nuclear scenarios on the Korean Peninsula.

But [the Oval Office clash between Trump and Zelenskyy raises **ample
room** to question whether Washington would really be willing to use
nuclear weapons to **defend** South Korea]{.underline}, should there be
any possibility of Pyongyang targeting California or other states in the
U.S. with its intercontinental ballistic missiles. [Despite the security
treaty between the two countries, and Washington's **repeated
guarantees**, even South Koreans believe that the United States will not
risk of putting its **territory** in trouble when the South is
**attacked** by the North]{.underline}.

In this context, South Koreans have shown snowballing support for the
idea of acquiring a domestic nuclear arsenal. Many believe it is the
only effective means to deter the North's preemptive strike against
South Korea, considering multiple military provocations made by
Pyongyang in recent decades and the failure of the peace process
implemented by then-South Korean President Moon Jae-in in 2018 and 2019.

As Trump views security conflicts as opportunities for business
negotiations, he will likely demand that Seoul pay more for the U.S.
defense commitment to South Korea -- like he did during his first term,
when his administration asked Seoul to increase its contribution more
than five-fold.

Right now, South Korea cannot meaningfully craft a policy response to
the upheaval in U.S. foreign policy, given its own domestic
difficulties. South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol has been suspended
from his duties after being impeached by the National Assembly and will
likely be removed from office permanently when the Constitutional Court
issues its ruling in the coming weeks. Should the court confirm Yoon's
impeachment, South Korea will hold special elections in May to install a
new president.

[If the new South **Korean president** takes a similar approach to
Trump's -- putting the country's interest first under the name of
**pragmatism** -- he may consider developing **nuc**lear
weapon**s**]{.underline}. Some comments from Trump and his advisers
suggest his administration may allow South Korea to have nuclear weapons
in exchange for pulling out the approximately 28,500 U.S. troops
stationed in South Korea.

Under such a scenario, Japan may also take steps to possess nuclear
weapons and revise the war-renouncing Article 9 of its Constitution --
which was a situation that the U.S. had long wanted to avoid. But, under
Trump's perspective on security and diplomacy, the United States may
allow other countries to "go nuclear" as long as there are economic
benefits to be had.

With the U.S. giving up its role and mission to act as the "world
police" and strengthen diplomacy and the rules-based international
order, countries around the world, especially those in a tense security
environment, will spend more money to developing weapons. The global
arms race will be heightened and diplomacy centered on dialogue will no
longer be the preferred means to resolve security conflicts.

What happened at the White House may have been meant to show Trump's
strong will to renew ties with Russia. However, to everyone outside of
Moscow, [Trump blaming the president of **Ukraine** for prolonging the
war by resisting **invasion** by a nuclear-armed neighbor sends a
**clear signal**: **every country for itself**, and woe to those not
equipped to **defend themselves** -- including with nuclear
weapons]{.underline}.

[Even proponents of a Northeast Asia NWFZ describe its prospects in
restrained terms]{.underline}.116 The NWFZ project reflects a liberal
internationalism that has not taken root in the security policies of
Northeast Asia; "all the regional players prefer the realist
approach."117 [Continued missile testing by North Korea, and mixed
messages about Japanese and South Korean proliferation by the US
president, complicates the security calculations of regional
actors]{.underline}. In this environment, [it would be challenging to
actualize some of the components of a Northeast Asia NWFZ. The extended
nuclear deterrent]{.underline} of the United States [would have to be
withdrawn]{.underline} without **[stoking abandonment
anxieties]{.underline}** [on the part of its allies. And if Japan and
South Korea do formally commit to nonproliferation, they would be taking
a risk that China would then lose interest in pressuring North Korea to
relinquish its nuclear weapons]{.underline}.118 Like the proposed Middle
East and Arctic NWFZs, the possibilities for a regional NWFZ seem
closely tied to more general improvements in the regional security
environment.

The [assurance side]{.underline} of the equation [is perceptibly harder
than the deterrence side. Alliance extended assurance is and has been a
never-ending process]{.underline} in both Europe and Asia. Such is the
case when one country tries to convince others that it will place its
own security at risk for a far-away partner. Naturally, [US allies fear
that in their moment of need, a US president would fail to act. This
risk is inherent to extended deterrence relationships and not unique to
the current security challenges]{.underline}. Nevertheless, [the
challenge of alliance assurance has grown more acute as the traditional
bipartisan support for alliances]{.underline} in the United States [has
broken down amid a widening split]{.underline} within the Republican
Party on this issue. [This **loss** of consensus creates **instability**
and **confusion** at a time when allies **seek reliability and
certainty**]{.underline}. [Any lack of those elements has and is likely
to feed demand for more national capabilities, including independent
conventional and nuclear systems]{.underline}.

[Ever since the first North Korean nuclear crisis]{.underline} in the
early 1990's, [frustration has grown among many South Korean
conservatives and moderate progressives about the ambivalence of both
Washington and Beijing to proactively and consistently deal with the
North Korean threat.]{.underline} They saw three consecutive American
presidents put the North Korea issue on the back burner because of more
pressing American foreign policy priorities in the Middle East, only to
have to tend to it after major North Korean provocations (Einhorn and
Kim 2016). Today, [South Koreans across ideological divides are hopeful
and relieved that an American president is dealing directly with
Kim]{.underline} Jong Un [and frequently talks about North Korea.
However, conservatives and many moderate progressives criticize the lack
of a real US strategy that supports the summit process, the refusal of
Pyongyang to hold real working-level negotiations with Washington, and
the absence of a real nuclear agreement]{.underline}.12

[South Korea became a member of the IAEA]{.underline} in 1957, the year
the Agency was established. [In 1975 it joined the NPT]{.underline} and
the same year it signed its Comprehensive Safeguards agreement with the
IAEA. In 2004 South Korea ratified and the IAEA started the
implementation of the Additional Protocol. [Since then its nuclear
activities and facilities have been subject to thorough, rigorous and
intrusive inspections by the IAEA]{.underline} all of which verified the
correctness and the completeness of its declarations on the non-use of
nuclear power for military purposes.

[South Korea's peaceful nuclear program is]{.underline} basically
[comprised of 24 nuclear power reactors]{.underline}, covering about
23.7% of the country's electricity needs. [Additional four NPRs are at
the construction stage]{.underline} (see Annexes III and IV).

Like its neighbour Japan, [**So**uth **Ko**rea has a shortage of
domestic energy resources while at the same time being]{.underline} a
[highly-industrialized]{.underline} economy. For that South Korea is a
large importer of energy, and this defines to a great extent the
structure of its economy and its geopolitical dependencies. Around [85%
of the country's primary energy consumption, including nuclear materials
comes from fossil fuel.]{.underline} Scarcity of domestic resources
means that 98% of the fossil fuel consumed has to be imported \[41\].

[**This reality made So**uth **Ko**rea **turn towards the development of
nuc**lear **energy**]{.underline}. In the field of nuclear research and
technology, [**So**uth **Ko**rea **is currently competing on par with
the rest of the top notch manufacturers of nuclear
reactors**]{.underline}. It is currently involved in the construction of
four NPRs in the United Arab Emirates under a 20 billion-dollar
contract.

5.5.2 Possible Military Dimension

In 1970, when [**So**uth **Ko**rea]{.underline} was not yet a member of
NPT, it had [created the Weapons Exploitation Committee to examine the
possibility of utilization of **nuc**lear technology for armament
purposes. This Committee]{.underline} had [decided]{.underline} back
then [that South Korea should acquire nuclear weapons]{.underline}
\[42\].

This decision was [caused partly by]{.underline} American President
Richard [Nixon's doctrine]{.underline} at the time [that urged US allies
in Asia to take up their own defence.]{.underline} The result was that
26,000 American military personnel stationed in South Korea up to that
point were withdrawn from the country. Associations with present time
developments may prove quite useful (see: 7.1 USA---Trump's doctrine and
the Munich Security Conference).

[South Korea ordered a nuclear fuel reprocessing
facility]{.underline}---crucial for the acquisition of plutonium---from
France, but [the US exerted pressure to both countries to roll back this
agreement]{.underline} and they did so. A few years later, in April
1975, South Korea joined the NPT

In two cases though, doubts were raised whether this country had truly
and fully complied to its obligations under the NPT.

First, from 1982 to 2000, allegations were made at certain instances
concerning experiments and activities indicating the existence of a
military nuclear program. These activities included uranium conversion,
chemical enrichment of uranium and also separation of plutonium. On top
of all that, these activities were all carried out without the IAEA
having being notified, as dictated by the mutually signed Safeguards
agreement, implemented since 1975.

The other case came to light in August 2004 [when the South Korean
government, starting to implement the Additional Protocol,]{.underline}
[submitted to the IAEA its initial declaration on all nuclear activities
and materials]{.underline} in the country. **[This official declaration
included activities which were identified by government
authorities]{.underline}** in June 2004 **[and were related to
laboratory experiments]{.underline}** carried out in 2000 **[on uranium
enrichment using]{.underline}** the **[AVLIS]{.underline}** method
(Atomic Vapor Laser Isotope Separation).

[**So**uth **Ko**rea is an ally of the **U**nited **S**tates and
currently under the US nuclear umbrella]{.underline}. However, [**it is
widely considered that So**uth **Ko**rea **has the
capacity**]{.underline}--- [**materials, tech**nology **and
resources**]{.underline}---[**to build nuc**lear
weapon**s**]{.underline} at a level similar to that of Japan, if its
leadership ever decides to "break-out" of the international nuclear
non-proliferation regime

[The growing nuclear threat of **No**rth **Ko**rea has alarmed South
Koreans. It is a matter of serious concern that the voices invoking the
country's right under article X]{.underline} of the NPT [to withdraw
from this Treaty, the same article North Korea invoked in bad faith to
withdraw]{.underline} from the NPT [in 2003, have recently been
strengthened]{.underline} at the higher echelons of South Korea's
political elite.2

[**So**uth **Ko**rea has a **checkered background**
regarding]{.underline} adhering to and respecting international [nuclear
**non-prolif**eration]{.underline} norms and guidelines. Seoul has
lately taken measures to strengthen its non-proliferation credentials
and meet applicable non-proliferation responsibilities. South Korea must
become a leader, not a follower, in the worldwide nuclear
non-proliferation framework if it is to achieve its objectives as a
nuclear exporter and successfully negotiate a new nuclear cooperation
treaty with the USA (Hamidi, 2020; Kristensen & Norris, 2017).

[**So**uth **Ko**rea is working on **pyro processing**]{.underline}, a
used-fuel treatment technique it feels it needs to handle the rising
volume of nuclear waste from its reactors, [raising further worries
related to **non-prolif**eration]{.underline}, especially in the USA
(Casarini & Tsuruoka, 2018). The government of South Korea has assured
the world that pyro processing is not the same as conventional
reprocessing and poses few proliferation concerns. However, many
scientists and officials from outside the country are worried that [the
method might make it **too easy to divert critical nuclear
materials**]{.underline}.

3.7.1 Cultural Factor

South Korea joined the NPT in 1969, but in the 1970s the country\'s
security situation prompted Seoul to explore pursuing a military nuclear
option. South Korean President Park Chung-hee prioritized acquiring a
processing capacity to segregate plutonium for nuclear bombs in the
mid-1970s (Hamidi, 2020). In 1975, South Korea joined the NPT. It
approved an IAEA protection agreement in response to threats from the
USA to remove security assurances unless Seoul halted its weapons
production intentions (Kristensen & Norris, 2017).

Park Chung-hee\'s passion for nuclear weapons was rekindled when
President Carter said in the mid-1970s that the USA wanted to remove all
foot forces from the Korean peninsula. Following Carter\'s involvement
and almost simultaneous determination not to remove US troops from the
peninsula, Seoul continued its attempts to get a reprocessed capacity
from France (Müller, 2017).

North Korea and South Korea committed not to \"hold nuclear reprocessing
and uranium nuclear sites\" when they signed the \"Joint Statement of
North and South Korea on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\"
in 1992, shortly after the end of the Cold War (Hamidi, 2020). Each side
also said it would not conduct any nuclear tests, make any new nuclear
weapons, acquire any, store any, use any, or deploy any nuclear weapons
(Casarini & Tsuruok, 2018)

It Is generally acknowledged that North Korea has breached the 1993
agreement with its nuclear operations over the previous decade,
especially with its enriching and reprocessing projects and nuclear
tests. Although there have been periodic proposals in South Korean elite
circles that Seoul should reject the deal, the South Korean government
has never publicly abandoned the joint statement and urged Pyongyang to
adhere to the commitment.

In January 2005, an annex to South Korea\'s IAEA agreement on safeguards
went into effect. IAEA inspectors are given more access to a nation\'s
nuclear facilities, substances, and documents, including those of
undeclared installations, according to the different protocols (Müller,
2017). Nevertheless, when [**So**uth **Ko**rea]{.underline} made its
first report to the IAEA, it [revealed]{.underline} several [previously
unreported research lab operations]{.underline} carried out by experts
at the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute (KAERI) (Ahmed, 2017).

[IAEA probes found **ev**idence of enriching uranium, transformation,
and separation experiments]{.underline} conducted by South Korean
experts. The [trials were]{.underline} not part of [a more significant,
concerted attempt to develop **nuc**lear weapon**s**, but the
**technical knowledge**]{.underline} they gained **[may be helpful in
such a plan]{.underline}** (Hamidi, 2020). Director-General of the IAEA,
Mohammed ElBaradei, said that the tests\' [undisclosed use of
radioactive material was **cause for grave concern**]{.underline}. South
Korea reportedly told the IAEA that the tests were carried out without
the state\'s knowledge or permission and were done to satiate the
scientists\' curiosity (Ahmed, 2017).

Since then, Seoul has adopted several institutional changes and
instructional initiatives designed to improve the government\'s ability
to monitor nuclear research centers. Nevertheless, South Korea\'s
history of provocative behavior has made it harder for the country to
get approval for purchasing dual-use technology for enriching uranium
and processing spent fuel that can be used to produce nuclear weapons
and nuclear electricity (Kristensen & Norris, 2017).

3.7.2 Economic Factor

The inability to resolve the local spent-fuel handling dilemma is the
driving force behind South Korea\'s involvement in pyro processing. Even
though South Korea is not alone in its inability to identify a permanent
location for spent fuel disposal, the country is on the verge of a
catastrophe due to the lack of political support for constructing new
temporary storage facilities at home. Researchers in South Korea
estimate that in the next few seasons, spent fuel pools at the
country\'s nuclear power facilities will commence to fill up (Pedraza,
2017). South Korea is considering pyro processing as a lengthy
technological solution; however, authorities recognize that other
solutions, including interim preservation, will be necessary for some
period.

Although not all members of the South Korean administration concur on
the merits of this strategy, [there is consensus in Seoul
that]{.underline} the possibility of [advancing]{.underline} this
[technology should]{.underline} indeed [be retained in ongoing
discussions with the USA]{.underline} regarding a new bilateral nuclear
cooperation agreement (Pedraza, 2017). Until its expiration in 2014, the
existing agreement forbids South Korea from engaging in any
\"modification in form and composition\" of US-origin fuel, including
classical reprocessing, pyro processing, or enriching. [Seoul is
advocating for loosening]{.underline} some of the **[long-standing
limits]{.underline}** imposed by the USA [on processing spent nuclear
fuel]{.underline} (Pedraza, 2017). The USA has not given its approval
because of concerns that the process or its output might be changed too
quickly to generate less innocuous goods, that it will be too hard to
implement protections intended to prevent such adjustments, and that any
easing of US rules will indeed harm Washington\'s wider regional and
global nuclear non-proliferation attempts.

As mentioned, South Korea has an inconsistent history regarding adhering
to and respecting global nuclear non-proliferation norms and guidelines.
The country has tried to strengthen its non-proliferation credentials
and meet applicable non-proliferation responsibilities. South Korea must
become a leader, not a follower, of the worldwide nuclear
non-proliferation framework if it is to achieve its objectives as a
nuclear exporter and effectively negotiate a new nuclear cooperation
treaty with the USA. South Korea is working on pyro processing, a
used-fuel treatment technique to handle the rising volume of nuclear
waste from its reactors (Pedraza, 2017). This has raised further worries
about non-proliferation, especially in the USA. The government of South
Korea has assured the world that pyro processing is not the same as
conventional reprocessing and poses few proliferation concerns.
Nevertheless, many scientists and officials from outside the country are
worried that the method might make it too easy to divert critical
nuclear materials (Baldus et al., 2021).

3.7.3 Political Factor

[The USA]{.underline} and critical regional countries like [Japan and
China are worried about **So**uth **Ko**rea**\'s readiness** to launch
programs]{.underline} involving these technologies. This is because the
[**non-prolif**eration documentation and the 1992 denuclearization
consensus]{.underline} that forbids enrichment or reprocessing
innovation [on the Korean peninsula are **disregarded**]{.underline}
(Ahmed, 2017). They are concerned that, [combined with **So**uth
**Ko**rea**\'s** existing capabilities, like its **missile
tech**nology]{.underline}, these [advancements]{.underline} would [put
the nation within a few **months of becoming able to construct a nuclear
bomb**]{.underline}. Further, they are concerned that [South Korea\'s
move would make it harder to persuade North Korea to comply
with]{.underline} the [**disarm**ament]{.underline} deal of 1992
(Hamidi, 2020). However, South Korean authorities point out that the USA
has allowed Japan to reprocess gasoline that originated in the USA, even
though the USA has long shared this worry with Japan and China. The USA
altered its stance on reprocessing in the early 1970s when India tested
a \"clean nuclear bomb\" made with plutonium using recycled spent fuel
(Müller, 2017). However, Japan had already established its reprocessing
system by that time. Tokyo has not violated its IAEA protection
agreements and has not agreed to limits such as those in the Korean
disarmament accord.

As a rising nuclear exporter, South Korea\'s policy on these problems is
significant for the world as a whole. So far though, [Seoul has been
**hesitant** to play a pivotal role in international efforts to prevent
nuclear **prolif**eration]{.underline} (Ahmed, 2017). Some NSG members,
most notably the USA, have been trying to tighten limits on the sale of
enrichment and recycling technologies. However, there has been some
public outcry against these measures. [**So**uth **Ko**rea still
needs]{.underline} to make acc[eptance of an IAEA supplementary
protocol]{.underline}, a requirement for selling nuclear technology,
unlike China (explicitly) and the USA (Pollack, 2017). Before
negotiations with South Korea, the countries of Jordon, Syria, and the
UAE agreed to adhere to this policy. Officials in South Korea have said
that they will accept this demand if and only if the NSG gives its
approval.

In addition, [Seoul has been **sluggish** in joining international
measures to counter Iran\'s nuclear program]{.underline}. Since Tehran
is a major commercial partner of Seoul and roughly 11 percent of South
Korea\'s energy comes from Iran, the country has economic reasons to be
cautious. New South Korean national sanctions on Iran were released in
November 2010 in response to pressure from the USA (Rauf, 2017). South
Korean involvement in Iranian oil and gas companies has been restricted.
A total of 102 Iranian organizations and 24 individuals have been placed
on a list \"banning monetary operations without central bank
authorization\". The lone East Asian branch of the Iranian lender, Bank
Mellat, was also temporarily shuttered in Seoul, South Korea (Pollack,
2017). About 70 percent of all trade between South Korean and Iran
reportedly went via this bank (Kristensen & Norris, 2017). The Seoul
office was believed to be employed to move money for weapons deals
between Iran and North Korea. Despite pressure from Washington, Seoul
restored the Bank Mellat branch in December 2010, indicating that [it
is]{.underline} still [wary of upsetting a significant economic
partner]{.underline}. In the same month, South Korean firm D.K. Tech
Corp. signed a \$760 million agreement with Iran to construct the second
and third stages of the massive Southern Pars natural gas field (Rauf,
2017). Considering the growing demands of certain Western countries
elating to sanctions over Iran\'s nuclear program, another South Korean
business pulled out of the plan six months before the signing of the
agreement.

Public Policy at the Australian National University, "Nuclear Weapons
May Not Be in Seoul's Best Interest," Asian Pacific Leadership Network,

https://www.apln.network/news/member_activities/nuclear-weapons-may-not-be-in-seouls-best-interest

On May 2, Pentagon spokesman Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder confirmed that a U.S.
Ohio-class nuclear-armed ballistic missile submarine will, for the first
time since the 1980s, make a visit to South Korea. The visit is part of
the bolstered extended deterrence consequent to the Washington
Declaration signed by American President Joe Biden and South Korean
leader Yoon Suk-yeol on April 26 --- the 70th anniversary of their two
countries' bilateral alliance. The agreement stipulates the U.S. will
"make its deterrence more visible through the regular deployment of
strategic assets" to South Korea and the establishment of a new Nuclear
Consultative Group to facilitate greater South Korean input into how
Washington prepares for threat contingencies on the Korean Peninsula.
This was the price demanded by and paid to South Korea for staying
inside the global nuclear nonproliferation regime. [In January this year
Yoon]{.underline} became the first incumbent South Korean president to
[raise the possibility of an indigenous bomb for South Korea. Opinion
polls]{.underline} have [tracked the upwards trajectory of support for
an independent nuclear deterrent capability among South Koreans, from
60% in 2016 to 71% in 2022, and almost 77% in January this
year]{.underline}. This is preferred to stationing U.S. nuclear weapons
in South Korea and the public was unconcerned with potential negative
repercussions for the U.S. alliance, China relations and the prospects
of North Korean denuclearization. **[Credibility challenges in the U.S.
nuclear umbrella have combined with growing geopolitical pressures to
increase the attractiveness of the nuclear option.]{.underline}** It's
hard to disagree with President Vladimir Putin's warning in October that
the world faces the most dangerous decade since World War II. Biden too
warned the same month of nuclear Armageddon. Meanwhile China has
steadily increased its nuclear arsenal to third place with 410 warheads,
well behind Russia and the U.S. with over 5,000 each. [Rising
nationalism in the region, maritime territorial disputes, **No**rth
**Ko**rea**'s** nuclear defiance and doubts about the reliability of
U.S. deterrence were powerful catalysts for pro-nuclear
arguments]{.underline}. Russia's invasion of Ukraine and serial nuclear
rattling, indications that Iran might have resumed its pursuit of
nuclear weapons [and the flurry of North Korean missile tests have only
heightened anxieties about the Korean Peninsula as "the world's biggest
powder keg." No one seriously doubts **So**uth **Ko**rea**'s** technical
and material ability to go nuclear]{.underline}. [Professor Suh
Kune-yull, a nuclear engineer at Seoul National University, told the New
York Times in 2017 that **Seoul could get the bomb in six
months**]{.underline} [after deciding to do so.]{.underline} The only
serious hurdle is the political will of the administration. Most others
think it would need three to five years. The legal route would become
easier if, say, North Korea conducted a seventh nuclear test and Seoul
used that as the trigger to announce withdrawal from the United Nations'
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Article 10 permits a state party to
exit the treaty if "extraordinary events ... have jeopardized the
supreme interests of its country." How many countries that matter to
Seoul would take serious issue with this rationale? [Japan, the
E]{.underline}uropean [U]{.underline}nion [and the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [are unlikely to put a nuclear-breakout South Korea
under sanctions. With North Korea acquiring tactical nuclear warheads,
ICBM capabilities, underwater nuclear attack drones and tensions between
the U.S. and China rising, Americans might even come to regard a South
Korean nuclear deterrent as lowering the risks of a nuclear attack on
the U.S. directly]{.underline}. Policy cleavages between Seoul and
Washington over China and evidence that American will as well as ability
to underwrite global order is weakening give additional incentives. But
what if South Korea's nuclearization increased U.S. temptation to pull
the plug on the alliance entirely --- would Seoul be comfortable with
that? The 2022 poll did a deep dive into reasons for supporting an
independent deterrent. South Koreans view North Korea as the greatest
current threat but China as the greater threat in 10 years' time. Most
want the bomb as a defense against a threat other than North Korea
(39%), followed by to increase national prestige (26%), counter North
Korea's threat (23%) and because of doubts over U.S. reliability (10%).
Every single one of these beliefs is contestable. **[South Korea's
nuclearization would likely set off a regional nuclear arms race that
would dramatically heighten the risk of a catastrophe through an
unstoppable escalation cycle, miscalculation, misunderstanding or
accident.]{.underline}** [Against the history of bitter wartime memories
and persistent distrust, the last thing East Asia needs is
nuclear-tinged tensions between Seoul and Tokyo to add to its already
combustible mix of geopolitical tensions. **South Korean nuclearization
would destroy all efforts to denuclearize North Korea and could also
kill the U.S. alliance, making Seoul more vulnerable to concerted
Chinese, North Korean and Russian pressures**]{.underline}. It is more
likely to hurt than enhance Seoul's global prestige. Moon Chung-in,
President Moon Jae-in's former special security adviser, further points
out how greatly dependent South Korea's civilian nuclear energy sector
is on the special 123 Agreement under the 1954 U.S. Atomic Energy Act.
Rakesh Sood was India's former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's special
envoy for nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament. In an opinion
article for the Toda Peace Institute last July, he argued that [the most
urgent nuclear policy task today is to ensure that the 78-year old taboo
on the use of nuclear weapons is not breached]{.underline}. In February,
Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association in
Washington, outlined several steps to that end. Last month, Daisaku
Ikeda, president of Soka Gakkai International, issued an appeal for the
Group of Seven summit in Hiroshima this month to take "the lead in
discussions on pledges of No First Use of nuclear weapons." Meanwhile
the Washington Declaration has paused the push for South Korea's
nuclearization. Biden reiterated that the U.S. commitment to Seoul is
"enduring and ironclad" and the extended deterrence is backed by the
full range of U.S. capabilities, including nuclear weapons. In return
Seoul expressed "full confidence in U.S. extended deterrence commitments
and recognizes the importance, necessity and benefit of its enduring
reliance on the U.S. nuclear deterrent." It reaffirmed its commitment to
the NPT "as the cornerstone of the global nonproliferation regime" and
to the bilateral agreement on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.
Should Donald Trump be re-elected as U.S. president next year, however,
South Korean nervousness will return and the escalatory cycle could
begin again.

#### It happens in [six months]{.underline}. 

Zachary **Keck &** Leon **Whyte 17**, Wohlstetter Public Affairs Fellow

the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, "Can South Korea Build a
Nuclear Bomb in 6 Months?", National Interest, 09-22-2017,
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/can-south-korea-build-nuclear-bomb-6-months-22437

As tensions with North Korea are heating up, [a prominent **So**uth
**Ko**rean nuclear physicist said his country **can build a nuclear
weapon in** just **six months.**]{.underline}

In a newly released Korean-language article in Chosun Monthly, Kune Y.
Suh, [an MIT-trained nuclear engineer]{.underline} at Seoul National
University, [argues that South Korea needs to build its own nuclear
arsenal to deal with the threat posed by Pyongyang]{.underline}. When
asked if Seoul is capable of producing such a weapon, Suh argued that
[the country could use **its huge stockpile of plutonium** to build an
operational nuclear weapon in six months.]{.underline}

Suh didn't go into detail about how Seoul could accomplish this feat,
which is notable because its plutonium stockpile largely consists of
what many dismiss as "unusable" reactor-grade plutonium. But clues to
how South Korea could overcome this challenge were offered at an event
our employer, the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, hosted on
Capitol Hill on September 14 for a visiting delegation of Japanese Diet
members. That event, which focused on the plutonium stockpiles in
northeast Asia, featured an eye-opening presentation by Bruce Goodwin, a
Senior Fellow at the Center for Global Security Research at the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory. At the event, [Goodwin, one of America's
top nuclear weapons designers and plutonium experts,]{.underline}
thoroughly [debunked the myth that countries cannot use so-called
reactor-grade plutonium to build nuclear weapons.]{.underline}

Reactor-grade plutonium refers to plutonium that has a larger percentage
of the isotope Pu-240 compared with weapons-grade plutonium, which has a
higher mix of the isotope, Pu-239. Many have contended that the high
level of Pu-240 makes reactor-grade plutonium unsuitable for nuclear
weapons because it would require too large of a critical mass, is too
radioactive to handle, and is prone to a condition called
"pre-initiation," which is when the nuclear chain reaction begins too
soon producing a minimal explosive yield. As the World Nuclear
Association has put it, "any significant proportions of Pu-240 in it
would make it hazardous to the bomb makers, as well as probably
unreliable and unpredictable" for use in nuclear weapons.

Goodwin's presentation exploded each myth, which persist even though the
United States tested a reactor-grade-plutonium nuclear device in 1962.
First, he noted that [the critical mass for reactor-grade plutonium in
nuclear weapons is only two kilograms larger than weapons-grade
plutonium, and much less than using highly enriched
uranium]{.underline}. The reason why many believe a much larger critical
mass is needed with reactor-grade plutonium is because Pu-240 is not
very fissionable with the slow neutrons present in nuclear reactors. On
the other hand, Goodwin explained, "[Pu-240 is a good fissile material
with fast neutrons and fast neutrons drive nuclear
explosives]{.underline}." The irony here, Goodwin pointed out, is that
**[reactor-grade plutonium works better for nuclear weapons than in
reactors.]{.underline}**

The radioactivity differences between reactor and weapons-grade
plutonium are also negligible. To be sure, reactor-grade plutonium is
over three times as radioactive as its weapons grade counterpart, but
the differences would have to be "several factors of ten" to seriously
inhibit handling of the material. In fact, Goodwin's presentation noted,
"In newly built facilities, handling reactor grade is essentially the
same as handling weapons grade Pu."

The problem of pre-initiation, while real, is also overblown. As Goodwin
points out, the Department of Energy released a report in 1997 that
stated that "even if pre-initiation occurs at the worst possible moment
(when the material first becomes compressed enough to sustain a chain
reaction) the explosive yield of even a relatively simple
first-generation nuclear device would be of the order of one or a few
kilotons." This is the absolute minimum yield, and in all likelihood, it
would be much higher even for a first-generation device. Nonetheless, "a
one-kiloton bomb would still have a radius of destruction roughly
one-third that of the Hiroshima weapon, making it a potentially fearsome
explosive."

Furthermore, that same Department of Energy report noted that [advanced
weapon states]{.underline}, like Russia and the United States, "[could
produce weapons from reactor-grade plutonium having reliable explosive
yields, weight, and other characteristics]{.underline} generally
comparable to those of weapons made from weapons-grade plutonium."
Goodwin assured the audience that "having done this myself I can tell
you that this is quite true." He also stated: "I suspect that the
industrialized states of Asia would be similarly capable to the United
States and Russia in making such weapons." It is also worth noting that
[**So**uth **Ko**rea **has one thousand bombs' worth of
tritium.**]{.underline} [This can be used to boost fission weapons
and]{.underline} totally [eliminate the risk of
pre-initiation.]{.underline}

Suh is therefore correct that South Korea's reactor-grade plutonium can
be used to build a nuclear arsenal. Still, its plutonium stockpile is of
the unseparated variety and, unlike Japan, Seoul doesn't have a
commercial-sized reprocessing plant. Wouldn't this prevent South Korea
from building nuclear weapons in the six-month timetable that Suh
outlines?

Not necessarily. [**So**uth **Ko**rea and other countries
could]{.underline} possibly [build a small reprocessing plant in that
time]{.underline}, according to a 1977 Oak Ridge National Laboratory
memo written by Floyd L. Culler. In the memo, Culler outlines how a
country could secretly build a chemical reprocessing plant with a
capacity to process 150 tons of irradiated fuel per year. Assuming the
plant was designed to process one PWR assembly per day (recovering about
five kilograms of plutonium per day), Culler estimated [it would take
four to six months to build such a facility, with the first ten
kilograms of plutonium becoming available]{.underline} about [**one week
after operation**s]{.underline} began. Such a plant could be built
covertly in a relatively small area in a warehouse or some other
unsafeguarded area, such as the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute's
Underground Research Tunnel, which is currently used for research on the
geologic disposal of spent fuel and high-level radioactive waste. To be
sure, it might take South Korea longer than six months, especially to
field an operational nuclear weapon. Still, it's undeniable that [Seoul
would be able to make a nuclear weapon without much
difficulty.]{.underline}

While President Moon Jae-in has vowed not to build a nuclear weapon, a
majority of South Koreans want the bomb, as do many members of the
opposition party. If Seoul chooses to go this route, or continues to
hint at it, Japan and China will likely ramp up their nuclear weapons
options as well.

[[North Korea's]{.mark} insatiable [appetite for nuclear weapons]{.mark}
and missiles of all ranges [makes]{.mark}]{.underline} achieving [the
dual [goals of strengthened military preparedness]{.mark} for deterring
North Korean threats and of pursuing peaceful unification with hostile
North Korea [more challenging]{.mark} for South Korea]{.underline}.
While some of the factors may lead up to more intense nuclear
confrontation on the Korean Peninsula or contribute to maintaining the
status quo, the assumption throughout this article has been that North
Korea will remain a hostile state with a strong drive to further develop
nuclear capabilities.

[Under such circumstances, it is natural for South Korea to consider all
its security policy options and tools to balance deterrence, preemption,
and defense to better respond to additional North Korean
provocations.]{.underline} In this context, this article has examined
costs and benefits of the extended nuclear deterrence provided through
the US--ROK alliance and nuclear weapons armament. [[Arguments for South
Korea's nuclear]{.mark} weapons [armament may help]{.mark} South Korea
to]{.underline} [[further]{.mark} advance its military [tactics, but not
under]{.mark} [current settings]{.mark}. Nuclear weapons alone do not
automatically promise stronger military power;]{.underline} there has to
be a missile delivery system, various measures to carry the nuclear
warheads, second-strike capability to support the nuclear assets, and a
new command chain. [Overall, expanding the military budget to fund R&D
projects, restructuring the command chain, and so forth will be an
expensive long-term option. This suggests that [under the current system
it will be]{.mark} much more [costly for South Korea to develop]{.mark}
[its own nuclear weapons than]{.mark} to [maintain]{.mark} the extended
nuclear deterrence under [the]{.mark} US--ROK
[alliance]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[The]{.mark} US--ROK [alliance has been crucial to South Korean
security policy calculations]{.mark}, especially the component of
extended nuclear deterrence. [Unless there is a crisis situation

Moreover, [in addition to the technical aspect of developing nuclear
weapons and the support systems,]{.underline} [establishing a command
chain and carrying out test]{.underline} runs [are
necessities]{.underline}. Since nuclear weapons would be a new type of
strategic asset to South Korea, Seoul will need to figure out how it
will proceed when nuclear weapons are required to be employed. [Under
current USFK and UN CFC in Seoul,]{.underline} it is likely that even
[if South Korea manages to develop its own nuclear weapons,]{.underline}
the [final decision for their use would have to go through not only
South Korean military but eventually through the US president due to the
security treaty.]{.underline} This would be the same command chain used
to carry out existing US nuclear extended deterrence measures, which
lessens the appeal for an independent South Korean nuclear capability.

[Unless there is a significant event that completely changes the current
alliance structure and its calculations, South Korea's decision to
develop nuclear weapons **is unrealistic**]{.underline}. [It is,
however, safe to assume that the cost of alliance for South Korea is
likely to increase in the coming years,]{.underline} based on recent SMA
negotiations on the defense cost sharing deal. [If this trend
continues]{.underline}, it is only a matter of time before [South

Growing Calls for Nuclear Armament

Calls for [**nuclear armament** had already been rising in South Korea
before Trump's return to office. Public opinion polls have consistently
shown that a majority of South Koreans---**often over 70
percent**---support the development of indigenous nuclear
weapons.]{.underline} While support for nuclear armament remains
significantly lower among elites, as indicated by a Center for Strategic
and International Studies survey, a growing number of influential
politicians---particularly conservatives, including President Yoon Suk
Yeol and other prominent politicians---have openly endorsed the idea.
Others advocate nuclear hedging. Last year, a member of the ruling
conservative People Power Party (PPP), Yoo Yong-won, launched a National
Assembly initiative known as the Mugunghwa Forum, aimed at galvanizing
support for acquiring the capability to quickly go nuclear for nuclear
hedging purposes. Several conservative politicians have joined the
initiative.

the world). [They point to Trump's unilateral decision to
halt]{.underline} major US-South Korean [military exercises]{.underline}
at his 2018 Singapore summit with Kim, [his dismissal of Pyongyang's
short-range ballistic tests,]{.underline} which threaten South Korea
(and Japan), [his "insulting" demands for Seoul to pay
exponentially]{.underline} more for combined defense costs, [and his
nonchalant comments about wanting to withdraw US troops from South
Korea.]{.underline}13 [South Koreans see Trump's military cost-sharing
demands as **disrespect**]{.underline} [for the value of the US-South
Korea alliance, treating it as a money-making tool instead of an
alliance forged on the basis of common values and national
interests]{.underline}.14

[These factors related to Trump are causing
**insecurities**]{.underline} [among South Korean conservatives
and]{.underline} some [moderate progressives and exacerbating suspicions
about the reliability and credibility of the US extended
deterrent]{.underline} (or, security guarantee).15 As leading security
expert Lee Sang-hyun at the Sejong Institute explains, "[The way Korean
people think]{.underline} \[about a future scenario\] [is, Trump demands
too much money]{.underline} \[for troops\] [and we don't give him what
he wants, then maybe he will reduce US troops and then **maybe we should
consider our own nuclear weapons**]{.underline}." 16 On the other hand,
the (progressive) head of a state-funded institute argues that "if the
North Korean nuclear capability continues to grow and Trump reduces US
troops, then progressives will \[also\] begin to question the
reliability of the US extended deterrent and, in turn, accelerate peace
with North Korea and ramp up its defense budget \[instead\]." 17

Other [experts warn that Trump could **encourage or even inadvertently
force**]{.underline} [South Korea to choose nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. As veteran Korea specialist Ralph Cossa of the
Pacific Forum points out, a South Korean "decision to go nuclear would
be driven by lack of faith in the alliance or Trump pulling out troops
or agreeing to end the UN Command/Combined Forces Command, so it's a
chicken and egg situation." 18 Senior editorial writer Lee Mi-sook with
the conservative daily Munhwa Ilbo says that South Korea cannot develop
its own nuclear weapons without US permission because of technological
and political reasons. But she also points out, "[If, out of need, the
US breaks the alliance and tries to retreat from Asia, it will be
**difficult for South Korea to deal** with a nuclear North Korea. Then,
just as divorcees provide alimony for example, shouldn't the US allow
South Korea to have its own nuclear weapons to defend
itsel]{.underline}f?" 19

The "[Trump factor" is not a temporary phenomenon in the minds of some
South Koreans.]{.underline} Former Foreign Minister Song Min-soon points
out that ["there is rising concern that **even after a Trump
presidency,** the US extended deterrent will becom**e less reliable or
costlier over time,** leading to more South Korean **calls for nuclear
balance between the two Koreas**]{.underline}." 20

[Another]{.underline} but [related alliance policy issue to be
weighed]{.underline} here [relates to the changing calculus of extended
deterrence in Northeast Asia. If denuclearization diplomacy between the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and North Korea falls
apart]{.underline}, while inter-Korean peace and reconciliation
continues to show progress, then [South Korea and the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [may]{.underline} well
[cultivate **diverse** approaches to making U.S. traditional extended
nuclear deterrence strategy more timely]{.underline}. Unless Seoul and
Washington are able to reconcile their potentially different policy
approaches to this problem, the U.S.-South Korea alliance could be
seriously undermined.

[Thus, a key challenge for the U.S.-South Korea alliance is to make U.S.
extended nuclear deterrence]{.underline} covering South Korea more
[credible]{.underline}, which is both important for the alliance per se
and a key to prevent conservative South Korean voices from calling for
Seoul to develop its own nuclear weapons (Lee, 2019). Indeed, [as North
Korea has increased its nuclear capabilities, there have emerged
conservative voices urging South Korea to **"go nuclear"**]{.underline}
(Kim, 2019; Lee, 2019). In the past the United States has deployed to
South Korea U.S. strategic assets, such as the B1-B bomber and
nuclear-powered aircraft carrier groups, as well as nuclear capable B-2
and B-52 bombers stationed in Guam, to demonstrate its strong commitment
to defending South Korea. [From the U.S. perspective, the audience for
this show-of-force is not only North Korea, but also South Korea and
Japan. However, under the scenario of inter-Korean peace and
reconciliation continuing to show progress, South Korea and the United
States may adopt differing positions on the U.S. deploying strategic
assets into or near the Korean Peninsula.]{.underline} [South Korea may
want to avoid provoking North Korea and China]{.underline}, and as such
would not welcome the continuing deployment of U.S. strategic assets on
or near the peninsula. We have already seen this, as, for example, some
liberal forces in South Korea expressed concern when the United States
flew B1-B bombers over the Korean Peninsula in 2017 as a part of the
maximum pressure campaign against North Korea, arguing that such a
show-of-force by the United States only worsened already high tensions.
[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [however, may find it
more desirable to sustain such initiatives to reassure not only
conservative factions in South Korea, but also in Japan, which would be
skeptical about resolving the North Korean issue through inter-Korean
dialogue, especially if U.S.-North Korea diplomacy failed to eliminate
North Korea's nuclear weapons capacity.]{.underline}

[Instead of provoking North Korea by deploying U.S. strategic assets,
there may well be more calls in South Korea for Washington and Seoul to
**agree to a guarantee of automatic involvement** of the United
States]{.underline} in the case of a Korean contingency. [While NATO's
Article 5 provides an explicit tripwire]{.underline} mechanism for U.S.
military action in case a NATO partner is attacked, [Article 3 of the
U.S.- South Korea Mutual Defense Treaty states only that "it \[the
U.S.\] would act to meet the common danger in accordance with its
constitutional processes]{.underline}." [Given the self-evident tripwire
function of U.S. soldiers stationed in South Korea, the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [would]{.underline} in fact
[have little choice but to be immediately involved in a second Korean
War]{.underline}, should it take place. [Yet]{.underline} a [growing
conservative]{.underline} cacophony of [voices in South Korea points out
that there is **no actual guarantee**]{.underline} that [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [will augment its
forces]{.underline} with soldiers [from]{.underline} [outside the
peninsula]{.underline}, especially if North Korea threatens U.S.
territory or bases with nuclear attack (Oh, 2019).

[Notwithstanding Seoul's abandonment fears, it is still unlikely the
United States would sign such an agreement. The **lack of an "automatic
involvement" clause**]{.underline} [is common to all U.S. alliances in
the Asia-Pacific, moreover, so the United States cannot in practice
modify it selectively]{.underline}.8 Apart from the domestic factor
cited above, [Japan and the Philippines would demand similar treatment
despite]{.underline} having [flashpoint]{.underline} territorial
[disputes]{.underline} of their own [with China]{.underline} in the East
and South China Seas, respectively. [If the United States were to enter
into such commitments, China's mistrust would intensify already strong
regional security dilemmas]{.underline}.9

[Korea's]{.underline} Ministry of [National Defense announced its
Intermediate-Term National Defense Plan for]{.underline} fiscal years
[2021 to 2025]{.underline} which [includes]{.underline} **[several
high-end projects]{.underline}** [along with a **substantial amount of
funds**]{.underline} earmarked [for developing and
manufacturing]{.underline} an array of impressive [weapon
systems.]{.underline}

As reported earlier by EurAsian Times, South Korea will also develop its
own version of Israel's Iron Dome in the next five years to protect the
country's key installations in the capital area against North Korean
artillery threats.

"When we talk about South Korea's missile defense system, it usually
refers to one targeting North Korea's Scud-type or stronger missiles,
whereas this new interceptor system will focus on protecting the capital
area against the North's long-range artillery such as its 240-mm or
300-mm multiple rocket launchers," a ministry official said.

[A variety of missiles are also in the pipeline]{.underline} which are
intended to boost its indigenous fighter jet, the KF-X, which is a 4.5
generation aircraft, currently under development.

[The KF-X, which is worth \$15 billion is also the largest project
undertaken by South Korea]{.underline}. It is expected to be delivered
in 2026. [Another exceptional boost to the military is the exclusive
Global Positional System (GPS) to be established by the early to
mid-2030s.]{.underline}

[South Korea lives under a serious threat of a surprise attack
from]{.underline} its neighbor, **[North Korea.]{.underline}** Apart
from the missiles, long-range artillery includes North Korean
multiple-launch rocket systems and 170mm self-propelled artillery.

[While the military has worked to establish a]{.underline} Korean Air
and Missile Defense ([KAMD) system, it is designed to intercept
ballistic missiles such as the Scud and is ineffective against
long-range artillery]{.underline}. "The long-range artillery
interception system could be force-integrated by the late 2020s to early
2030s," said a Ministry of Defence official.

[The real shark among its military plans is the **new
submarines**]{.underline} w[hich are expected to be powered by nuclear
reactors]{.underline} instead of diesel fuel. [This would give South
Korea an entry into the list of nations capable of building
nuclear-powered submarines]{.underline}.

It would be a massive upgrade to its existing Dosan submarines. [Seoul's
other acquisition would be the country's first aircraft carrier. The
30,000-ton carrier will be equipped with US-made F-35B fighter
jets]{.underline}, which have short takeoff and vertical landing
capability.

[Such a massive defense upgrade comes in the backdrop of the increasing
threat from South Korea's neighbors]{.underline}. [Not just from the
North, Korea's Defense]{.underline} White [Paper refers to
"omnidirectional security threats," **pointing to China in the west and
Japan in the east.**]{.underline}

With Chinese aggression being displayed in all directions including
Taiwan, Hong Kong, India, and Japan, South Korea is preparing for all
eventualities. Seoul also has a long-standing dispute with Tokyo
concerning sovereignty over the Dokdo (Takeshima) islands in the Sea of
Japan (called the East Sea by Koreans).

[South Korea has emerged as one of the countries to have sophisticated
military hardware]{.underline}, even though most of its defense products
are still based on Western (mostly American) designs.

[Washington and Seoul share a congenial relationship and military
cooperation is seen as a necessity to counter North Korea. While South
Korea doesn't perceive China as a major threat, but **with Washington
and Beijing locking horns, Seoul is stuck in an awkward
position.**]{.underline}

With [increasing tensions between the two global powers, Seoul will now
have to pick sides]{.underline}. On one hand, [there is its high
economic dependence on its Chinese neighbor which would mean
distancing]{.underline} itself [from Washington or]{.underline} to
[cooperate with the Americans and face a potential risk from
Beijing.]{.underline}

Scientists, P.h.D. in Physics from Boston University, Director at the

Engineering, and Medicine, "How South Korea Could Acquire and Deploy
Nuclear Weapons," Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, 2015,
http://npolicy.org/books/East_Asia/Ch4_Ferguson.pdf

[Acquiring fissile material would require **So**uth **Ko**rea to have
facilities for either uranium **enrich**ment or **reprocess**ing of
spent nuclear fuel.]{.underline} The former could produce highly
enriched uranium (HEU) that could initially power a relatively
easy-to-make guntype nuclear explosive such as the one first made during
the Manhattan Project for the Hiroshima bomb. HEU could also power more
advanced implosion-type nuclear explosives. South Korea does not have
enrichment facilities. Although the Korean nuclear industry has
expressed interest in developing enrichment capabilities, [the financial
incentives for South Korea venturing into enrichment are not apparent
for the foreseeable future]{.underline} given the relative glut of cheap
enriched uranium on the world market. In addition, South Korea would
likely not get U.S. permission to build an enrichment facility. A
clandestine facility could not be ruled out, but **[reprocessing seems
to be a more promising immediate pathway]{.underline}** as argued
herein.

[Reprocessing would separate plutonium from spent fuel;]{.underline} the
plutonium could power first-generation implosion-type bombs or
second-generation pure fission weapons that make use of levitated
plutonium pits surrounded by neutron reflectors made of beryllium.
Later, [South Korea could use its plutonium in more advanced boosted
fission and thermonuclear bombs]{.underline}. Notably, these more
advanced weapons could use HEU in combination with plutonium or by
itself. By the time the ROK went down the thermonuclear pathway, it
would be many years into an open breakout scenario and would then be
overt about building an enrichment facility.

[Plutonium is more desirable to South Korea]{.underline} for a few other
reasons[. Because plutonium is more efficient]{.underline} in terms of
the amount of material needed to achieve a certain explosive yield as
compared to HEU, [South Korean weapon designers would most likely prefer
this fissile material for their first nuclear bombs]{.underline}. [Such
material is more amenable for use in compact or miniaturized
warheads.]{.underline} Moreover, [the ROK would likely
choose]{.underline} the [plutonium]{.underline} pathway [because it has
**many tons of plutonium already resident in spent nuclear
fuel**,]{.underline} and **[it has been acquiring expertise in
reprocessing]{.underline}**. Thus, the enhanced status quo scenario
focuses on plutonium.

[Spent fuel could be acquired from either South Korea's pressurized
water reactors]{.underline} ([PWRs]{.underline}) or PHWRs. While South
Korea presently has much more PWRs with 19 operable and several more
under construction or planned, [the four PHWRs are much more useful for
acquiring weapons-usable plutonium]{.underline}. Due to the design of a
PHWR[, it does not burn up as much nuclear fuel as a PWR]{.underline}. A
lower burnup means that [the isotopic composition of the plutonium in
the spent fuel is better suited for nuclear explosives]{.underline}.
That is, [the higher the fraction of the fissile isotope plutonium-239,
the better the material will be for weapons purposes]{.underline}.
Fissile Pu-241 is also useful for weapons purposes but is less desirable
than Pu-239 because it is more reactive and emits more radiation, which
is a consideration during the handling and fashioning into an explosive.
In particular, a [PHWR with a typical burnup of 7,500 megawatt-day/ton
results in a]{.underline} plutonium mix of 66.6% Pu-239, 26.6% Pu-240,
and 5.3% Pu-241 for a [total fissile content of 71.9%.]{.underline} A
PWR with a typical burnup of 53,000 megawatt-day/ton results in a
plutonium mix of 50.4% Pu-239, 24.1% Pu-240, and 15.2% Pu-241 for a
total fissile content of 65.6%.9 Thus, in terms of the portion of Pu-239
and total fissile content, PHWR spent fuel is more weapons-usable than
PWR spent fuel.

[These "reactor-grade" plutonium mixtures are
weapons-usable]{.underline}, as officially stated by the U.S. Department
of Energy. 10 According to former nuclear weapon designer Dr. Richard
Garwin, it is wrong to rule out the use of a plutonium mixture that has
less than 85% fissile content. His calculations show that [**even a
fissile content of about 66% is weapon-usable** and has a "bare"
critical mass of about 13 kilograms]{.underline} as compared to about 10
kilograms bare critical mass for weapons-grade plutonium (Bare means a
sphere of this material by itself in a vacuum without being surrounded
by a neutron reflector that would reduce the critical mass). He outlines
in a 1998 article the relatively simple engineering steps that would be
needed to be able to use reactor-grade plutonium of 66% or greater
fissile content. He also points out that Pu-240 would add to the fissile
yield because high-energy neutrons, produced during the fission of
Pu-239 and Pu-241, can fission Pu-240. Thus, he argues that the
explosive yield of a reactor-grade plutonium bomb would be comparable to
a weapons-grade plutonium bomb because of approximately the same number
of fissions in each bomb, assuming similar number of critical masses. 11

Moreover, [there should be no doubt because **the U**nited **S**tates
demonstrated via a nuclear test]{.underline} during the Cold War [that
**reactor-grade plutonium is usable in nuclear explosives** and will
produce powerful nuclear yields]{.underline}.12 Also, it is believed
that [India demonstrated]{.underline} during its May 1998 tests [that it
used reactor-grade plutonium]{.underline}. The Indian PHWRs were the
likely source of that fissile material for at least one of the tests.13
[The Indian PHWRs and the Korean PHWRs are both derived from
Canadian-designed PHWRs known as CANDUs.]{.underline} The currently
stockpiled spent fuel at the dry cask storage facility at Wolsong could
provide about 26,000 kilograms of reactor-grade, but still
weapons-usable, plutonium for South Korea.14 [Assuming a conservative
estimate of about six kilograms plutonium]{.underline} for a
first-generation fission device, [**the ROK has up to 4,330 bombs' worth
of plutonium at this site.** South Korea could]{.underline} also [use
its PHWRs without too much effort to make
near-weapons-grade]{.underline}, often called fuel-grade,
[plutonium]{.underline} with a content of about 10 to 11 percent Pu-240
and at least 85 percent fissile isotopic content in the overall
plutonium mixture.

[The CANDU design is proliferation-prone from the standpoints of nuclear
material diversion and relative ease in making near-weapons-grade or
fuel-grade plutonium]{.underline}. [The CANDU can be fueled with natural
uranium, low enriched uranium, or even mixtures]{.underline} of various
fissionable and fissile materials. South Korea has fueled its CANDUs or
PHWRs with natural uranium fuel. The CANDU is designed so that it is
refueled while operating. Thus, **[the plant does not have to shut down
to refuel]{.underline}**, and **[there is no outward signal that the
plant is refueling.]{.underline}** In contrast, a PWR would have to shut
down to refuel, and an inspector could witness this activity by noting
that there would be no steam plume leaving the cooling tower.
Consequently, [if South Korea decided to make nuclear weapons and wanted
fissile material, it could keep its PHWRs operating while]{.underline}
removing and then **[diverting the spent fuel.]{.underline}** Secondly,
[a CANDU uses heavy water as a moderator and coolant]{.underline}. [The
heavy water does not absorb as many neutrons as light water, so there
would be more neutrons available to convert the uranium-238 atoms in the
natural uranium fuel to plutonium-239.]{.underline} Natural uranium has
more than 99 percent of its atoms as uranium-238, providing for numerous
targets for the neutrons to hit and result in conversion to plutonium.
To optimize for near-weapons-grade plutonium production with a very
large percentage of plutonium-239, the operator of the PHWR would want
to remove irradiated fuel on the order of about once a month.

According to the calculations of Thomas Cochran and Matthew McKinzie,
[every year until the decommissioning of the PHWRs, **So**uth **Ko**rea
could make about 2,500 kg or 416 bombs' worth of near-weapons-grade
plutonium]{.underline} (with a Pu-240 content of about 10 percent) from
the four PHWRs at the Wolsong Nuclear Power Plant assuming 6 kilograms
of weapons-grade plutonium per bomb and assuming an operational mode of
1,500 to 2,000 MW-day/ton burnup. 15 [For more sophisticated weapon
designs, the ROK might have available upwards of 830 bombs' worth of
plutonium in this operational mode]{.underline}.16 But as Cochran and
McKinzie point out, this scale of operations would require four to five
times the domestic natural uranium fuel production capacity that the ROK
presently has and would need a reprocessing capacity that is two to
three times that of the relatively large-scale commercial plant at
Rokkasho in Japan. Therefore, they argue that [the ROK would reasonably
reduce the scale to fit within its current fuel production
capacity.]{.underline} [That would still result in approximately 500
kilograms of plutonium, **enough for** several dozen to somewhat **more
than 100 bombs' worth of material.**]{.underline} Even a more modest
production rate of 150 kilograms of plutonium annually, which is well
within the capabilities of the four PHWRs, would generate 25 to 50
bombs' worth of material depending on the level of sophistication of the
weapons' designs.

Cochran and McKinzie notably highlight that [the ROK imports all its
natural uranium for producing fuel for these reactors because the ROK
has had very limited supplies of natural uranium]{.underline}.
Consequently, [the ROK would have to make sure that it had available
sufficient supplies of this material before embarking on a nuclear
weapons progra]{.underline}m. Typically, fuel manufacturing states do
purchase the raw material in advance and because uranium is a dense
material, hundreds to thousands of tons can be stockpiled without taking
up much space. South Korea, however, would have to be careful not to
appear to purchase too much natural uranium in a limited time period so
as to provide a telltale sign. Because of this concern, [the ROK would
likely **keep its initial weapons' material production program at a
lower level within the capabilities of existing stockpiles of natural
uranium**.]{.underline}

To ensure continuing supplies of natural uranium after the onset of the
weapons program, **[the ROK would mine newly discovered uranium deposits
on land and accelerate deployment of seawater extraction
methods]{.underline}**. Regarding the former source, [Stonehenge Metals
Limited presently owns 100 percent of the rights to four uranium
projects in South Korea]{.underline}. The lead project, known as the
Daejon Project, has inferred uranium resources of about 30 million
kilograms (30,000 tons) of U3O8 with an average grade of 320 ppm in the
ore bodies.17 [Seoul would]{.underline} likely move to [nationalize the
uranium resources in the event of a breakout to a nuclear weapons
program]{.underline}. [**So**uth **Ko**rea has]{.underline} also
[invested significant]{.underline} research and development
([R&D]{.underline}) [into seawater extraction of uranium]{.underline}.18
[The world's oceans contain at least several hundreds of years of
uranium]{.underline} based on current demand, but the concentration of
uranium is very diffuse. Recently, an international team of researchers
led by U.S.-based [Oak Ridge National Laboratory announced
a]{.underline} potential major [breakthrough that the group claims "can
extract five to seven times more uranium at uptake rates seven times
faster than the world's best absorbents]{.underline}."19

Shifting the PHWRs to low burnup operations is an essential step, but
[the ROK would also need a reprocessing facility]{.underline} to
separate the plutonium from the spent fuel. While South Korea in early
2015 does not have a reprocessing facility, **[it has made significant
strides in developing a prototype pyroprocessing facility at
the]{.underline}** Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute
(**[KAERI]{.underline}**) in Daejon. The stated rationale for
pyroprocessing is to remove the fissionable materials from spent fuel
and thus reduce the radioactivity and volume of the high level waste
that would have to be stored underground. The Korean government
anticipates fierce public opposition to a permanent high level waste
facility and wants to present a technological method that would show to
the public that the amount of waste to be stored would be minimized.

[Pyroprocessing]{.underline} would under normal operations not separate
out pure plutonium from other fissionable materials in spent nuclear
fuel. But it [would remove the plutonium and other fissionable materials
from the protective barrier of highly radioactive fission
products]{.underline} inside spent fuel. [The plutonium would be mixed
in with transuranic materials]{.underline} such as americium, curium,
and neptunium. While this mixture would not be desirable for a
militarily useful weapon, it could be susceptible to theft or diversion
if adequate physical protection measures are not in place because the
mixture would not be highly radioactive and could be handled. The main
concern from the proliferation standpoint is that [**So**uth **Ko**rea
could divert enough material into a]{.underline} Plutonium Uranium Redox
EXtraction ([PUREX]{.underline}) [type reprocessing facility or could
misuse the pyroprocessing facility]{.underline} in order [to extract
plutonium from the mixture.]{.underline} This plutonium could then be
used for making nuclear weapons.

Safeguarding pyroprocessing is challenging due to the nature of the
process, it is extremely hard to measure and track the amounts of
plutonium. While the International Atomic Energy Agency is working on a
safeguards method for pyroprocessing, the most often discussed scenario
is to couple the pyroprocessing facility with fast neutron reactors.
These reactors make use of high-energy, or fast moving, neutrons to
cause fission of plutonium and other transuranic fissionable materials.
Uranium enriched to 20 percent or more in the fissile isotope
uranium-235 could also be used to fuel these reactors. If the fast
reactors were just used to burn up transuranic materials, they could
help reduce the amount of these materials that would have to be stored
or that could be diverted into weapons programs. But these reactors can
also be run in a breeder mode to produce more plutonium, especially
plutonium that can be weapons-grade. Consequently, safeguarding fast
reactors adds to the challenge of ensuring that the combined system of
pyroprocessing plus fast reactors is not furthering a nuclear weapons
program.

At KAERI in Daejon, a small-scale research facility could provide a
relatively small amount of initial plutonium for breakout into a nuclear
weapons program. This is the HANARO research and isotope production
reactor and an associated hot cell facility. HANARO is rated at 30 MWth,
but the Korean regulatory authority has downgraded the operational power
to at most 26MWth. The reactor uses heavy water, but instead of natural
uranium fuel, it is fuelled with 19.75 percent U-235. If the reactor
were fuelled with natural uranium, it could make upwards of 8 kilograms
plutonium annually assuming the power limitation of 26 MWth and 300 days
of full power operation. However, due to the far fewer number of target
U-238 atoms in the 19.75 percent U-235 core versus a 0.7 percent U-235
natural uranium core, this reactor would not be able to make more than
0.55 kg of plutonium annually.20 While placing natural or depleted
uranium target material in the irradiation channels and around the core
could produce some more plutonium, it is likely that this would not be
much more than a few more kilograms of plutonium annually. Although the
HANARO reactor might provide some starter plutonium for a weapons
program, the annual amount would not be enough for the first bomb, but
it might supply enough after another year or two of operations assuming
that natural or depleted uranium target material were inserted in the
reactor. Notably, the hot cells have been used to extract radioisotopes
for medical, industrial, and research purposes. These hot cells could
also provide a means to extract some plutonium. [Of course, this assumes
that **So**uth **Ko**rea would break out of its safeguards commitments,
but given the]{.underline} basis of this [scenario in which **So**uth
**Ko**rea feels under serious threat to its supreme national interests,
**safeguards commitments are the least of its worries**]{.underline}.
The important finding from this analysis of the HANARO facility is that
the four PHWRs at Wolsong would be the preferred production route for
near-weapons-grade plutonium.

While KAERI has not yet used its PyRoprocessing Integrated DEmonstration
(PRIDE) facility with irradiated materials, its experience to date with
surrogate materials and its R&D work alongside U.S. researchers at Idaho
National Laboratory give KAERI's researchers the essential knowledge and
some work with this technique. The ROK has also requested to the United
States that packages of pyroprocessed material be made in advance of
operating the ROK's experimental fast reactor, which the ROK wants to
bring online by 2028. Making packaged pyroprocssed fuel would give
Korean technicians even further useful experience. The PRIDE facility
could handle about 10 tons of material per year. This capacity would not
allow for extensive production of plutonium annually from the PHWRs
given the several hundred tons of irradiated material from these
reactors, but it could provide a smaller scale means to extract the
first few bombs' worth of fissile material while KAERI is building a
bigger reprocessing facility.

To ensure much greater production capacity, the ROK would likely want to
build a dedicated reprocessing facility for the PHWRs that could use the
well-proven aqueous PUREX method. As Cochran and McKinzie point out,
[the ROK could first make a "Simple, Quick Processing Plant," which
could only require four to six months to build]{.underline}.21
[Considering that the PHWRs have much lower burnup than PWRs
and]{.underline} thus roughly [an order of magnitude greater amount of
spent fuel to be reprocessed, this simple plant would]{.underline}
likely [generate on the order of about **one kilogram of plutonium per
week**]{.underline} or about 50 kilograms per year. In parallel, [the
ROK could build a facility on the scale of the Rokkasho Reprocessing
Plant]{.underline}, which can reprocess up to 800 tons of irradiated
fuel annually, but such a plant would take considerably longer than six
months to build. (Also, given the technical struggles that Japan has had
with operating the complex Rokkasho plant, the ROK might not want to go
down this road. But Japan had successfully operated a pilot scale
reprocessing plant at Tokai that could process about 200 tons per
year--- plenty for the ROK's needs.) Nonetheless, **[the simple facility
would still provide the ROK with more than enough plutonium to make its
first few handfuls of nuclear bombs.]{.underline}**

###  AT//Costs

#### Its way cheaper than current conventional defense

Korean Nuclear Bomb", National Interest, 9/24/22,
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/korea-watch/case-south-korean-nuclear-bomb-204995

[In terms of budget concerns, nuclear development and maintenance costs
are not astronomical]{.underline}. Considering the political message and
deterrence provided by nuclear arms, **[nuclearization is a much cheaper
strategic asset than conventional forces]{.underline}**, as [**So**uth
**Ko**rea has already acquired the ground-based ballistic missiles,
submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and fighter bombers necessary for
the nuclear triad]{.underline}. [South Korea's well-established safety
management of nuclear facilities]{.underline} has also
**[provide]{.underline}**d ample **[tech]{.underline}**nical
[experience]{.underline}. Additionally, as [the purpose]{.underline} of
South Korean nuclear development would be [to deter]{.underline} the
[neighboring Eastern bloc]{.underline}, it would [not]{.underline}
necessitate [long-range ballistic missiles or costly strategic
bombers]{.underline}.

Also, given that [Seoul allocates a defense budget of \$46 billion to
defend against **No**rth **Ko**rean threats and **No**rth **Ko**rea has
spent only \$642 million for its nuclear program, industrialized
**So**uth **Ko**rea possesses **econ**omic and defense **tech**nological
capabilities that would allow it to nuclearize for considerably less
than it has spent on conventional arms]{.underline}. As a result, [a
nuclear arsenal is essential for a financially sound and efficient
defense]{.underline}.

###  AT//Delivery Vehicles

#### Their Air Force is [ready]{.underline}, and the other two legs are [close]{.underline}.

https://keia.org/the-peninsula/south-koreas-drive-toward-deterrent-capabilities

[**So**uth **Ko**rea**'s** conventional weapons]{.underline}
advancements [are]{.underline} also [a critical variable in Seoul's
potential development of an indigenous nuclear deterrent]{.underline}.
While not necessarily designed with nuclear capabilities in mind, [the
ROK military is **well on its way to**]{.underline} developing
**[latency]{.underline}** for an independent nuclear triad: [free**-fall
and air-launched ordnance, land-based ballistic missiles**, and
**sub**marine-**launched missiles**]{.underline}.

Starting in the 1970s, [the free fall and air-launched delivery
component was]{.underline} perhaps the most **[readily
available]{.underline}**. South Korea initially received then-state of
the art F-4D aircraft as a concession for Seoul's involvement in the
Vietnam conflict, and later purchased the upgraded F-4E for the
modernization of the rapidly aging Republic of Korea Air Force (ROKAF).
The acquisition of such U.S. designs alongside the attempted development
of a nuclear device, provided for potential aerial deployment of nuclear
weapons. [The ROKAF has]{.underline} since added many more [advanced
U.S. airframes]{.underline} to eventually replace the aging F-4s and
augment the growing indigenous fleet---from [the F-16C/D]{.underline}
(first delivered 1986), [to the F-15K]{.underline} (2005), [and the
F-35A]{.underline} (2019); **[all nuclear-capable
designs]{.underline}**.

Beyond possession of an airframe, the air-deployed ordnance with which
to deploy any nuclear warhead still poses a challenge for ROKAF. Rather
than depend on American airframes, [**So**uth **Ko**rea may enhance its
latency]{.underline} on the air-dropped component [with its]{.underline}
concurrent development of the [KAI KF-21]{.underline} Boramae
[and]{.underline} DAPA's Korea Long-Ranged Air-Launched Cruise Missile
([ALCM]{.underline}). [Domestically procuring both]{.underline}
platforms **[preempts]{.underline}** the **[burdensome regulatory
requirements]{.underline}** that come with imported weapons. Based on a
Swedish-German design, the [ALCM]{.underline} (for which the venerable
Phantom serves as a test bed) is unlikely to itself mount a nuclear
warhead; nevertheless, the [experience could give **So**uth **Ko**rea
the **knowhow** and **industrial infrastructure** to build]{.underline}
similar [air-launched weapons that could be
nuclear-capable]{.underline}.

The land- and submarine-launched ballistic missile arms of the South
Korean military form a storied yet more recent development. Like the
nuclear warhead it would later be envisioned to carry, South Korea's
ballistic missile program also came from a clandestine ADD project under
direction of the Blue House in 1971. The project began with an agreement
with McDonnell Douglas to jointly research modifications to the Nike
Hercules surface-to-air missile, with limits on range and payload to 180
kilometers and 500 kilograms, respectively. Despite resistance from the
U.S. Department of State, the project accelerated in 1975 under the
Yulgok Plan to close the capability gap with Pyongyang. In 1978, Seoul
successfully demonstrated the Baekgom surface-to-surface ballistic
missile. In 1979, with sustained U.S. pressure on the now well-known
nuclear program, the Park regime codified the initial range and payload
limitations of 180 kilometers and 500 kilograms. Following Park's
assassination in the same year, his successor Chun Do-hwan continued to
observe the limitation with the Hyunmoo missiles. It is of note that
nevertheless by 1990, U.S. inspections found that Hyunmoo retained the
potential to extend its range to 250 kilometers---demonstrating Seoul's
willingness to stretch the boundaries of its potential lethality.

As U.S. resistance held against Seoul's calls for renegotiating the
missile guidelines, Seoul turned to the newly formed Russian Federation
through the Bulgom (Siberian Bear) Operation. The technology exchange of
platforms and knowhow with Russia not only accelerated development of
South Korea's military missile capabilities, but also formed the
foundation of South Korea's space program. In 1997, [Seoul]{.underline}
eventually [succeeded in setting new ballistic missile
guidelines]{.underline} to 300-kilometer range and 500-kilogram
payloads, and joined the Missile Technology Control Regime
(MTCR)---[despite initial U.S. opposition and]{.underline} the
imposition of several [conditions calling for transparency]{.underline}
from Seoul. With subsequently growing North Korean nuclear and rocket
technology, the guidelines were again renegotiated in 2012 to a range
that covers 800 kilometers. [Demonstrating **So**uth **Ko**rea**'s**
latent capabilities, it **only took two years for Seoul to develop a
ballistic missile with a range of 500 kilometers**]{.underline}. Two
more revisions have taken place: in 2017, [all restrictions on payload
weight were **lifted**]{.underline}, and in 2020, [Seoul received the
green light to develop solid-propellant rockets]{.underline}---a
landmark development, as liquid-fuel rockets require laborious and
time-consuming fueling directly prior to launch, whereas solid-fuel
rockets are [shelf-stable and]{.underline} can be [launched more
quickly]{.underline}.

[By]{.underline} the [May 2021]{.underline} U.S.-ROK summit, **[all
remaining restrictions were effectively removed]{.underline}**.
Development had already been proceeding at a breakneck pace. In March
2020, DAPA announced that the Hyunmoo-4 could successfully deliver a
2,000 kilogram payload over 800 kilometers. In September 2021, South
Korea became the first nation without nuclear weapons to have SLBM
capabilities, also breaking the 1979 restrictions by over 200
kilometers. Most recently in December 2022, Seoul belatedly announced
the successful test of a solid-propellant space launch vehicle just six
months after the second-ever successful launch of the older, liquid-fuel
Nuri.

Nevertheless, South Korea faces resistance on its long-range strike
capabilities. In the 30 years since the ROK Navy (ROKN) commissioned the
first submarine in South Korean history, South Korea has taken great
efforts towards rapidly advancing its submarine-based strike
capabilities. However, its capabilities still fall short of nuclear
propulsion that can allow submarines to move faster and remain submerged
for longer. A ballistic missile submarine's ability to remain undetected
and constantly moving provides an immense deterrent capability; a
capability provided by nuclear propulsion. South Korea has been pushing
for a Korean nuclear submarine (KSSN) publicly for nearly twenty years.
The U.S. agreement to transfer nuclear submarine technology to Australia
with AUKUS only galvanized the debate.

Whether assistance from the United States or France, or independent
South Korean development of miniature reactors opens the doors to KSSN
is still uncertain. However, [**AUKUS** and **renewed calls for Seoul to
proceed with KSSN** is]{.underline} indeed [reminiscent of the broader
**So**uth **Ko**rean ballistic missile story]{.underline}. It is a story
of constantly shifting boundaries: [from initial restriction and
resistance to conditional allowance, and to eventual **unrestricted
development**]{.underline}. As a result, [Seoul may foresee a future in
which the **restrictions on nuclear devices** proceed in much the same
way as they **were lifted** for its missile capabilities]{.underline}.
While it may seem that tectonic shifts are underway in Indo-Pacific
security, for Seoul to arrive at such a conclusion remains misguided and
reductionist: a nuclear device involves a host of far more complex
variables such as technical dependency on the nuclear supplier group,
formal international legal ramifications with regards to the NPT, and
customary international obligations to nonproliferation.

are a signal to North Korea and the US," Australian National University,

[**So**uth **Ko**rea]{.underline} has formally declared that it
[possesses]{.underline} submarine launched ballistic missiles
([SLBM's]{.underline}), [and is the only country to possess them that
that does not also possess **nuc**lear weapon**s**]{.underline}. North
Koreas nuclear arsenal continues to undergo quantitative and qualitative
expansion, which, as Ankit Panda recently argued, has been motivated
more by the limited results of President Trump's summitry in Singapore
and Hanoi than the entry of the Biden administration into the oval
office. Especially alarming for South Korea is North Korean successes
with solid fuel propellants for its short and long range ballistic
missiles, which, as Timothy Wright and Joseph Dempsey have pointed out,
reduces the time required for Pyongyang to prepare missile launches and
for Seoul to react.

South Korea has both a deterrence by punishment and deterrence by denial
strategy to deal with the North Korean nuclear threat, and ballistic
missiles offer greater speeds than cruise missiles. Submarine launched
ballistic missiles ([SLBMs]{.underline}) also [offer]{.underline}
greater [survivability]{.underline} than land-based and aerially
launched alternatives. North Korea has often threatened to turn Seoul
into a sea of fire, but limited North Korean anti-submarine capabilities
would struggle to both locate South Korean submarines to say nothing of
making the sea surrounding them erupt into flame. [**So**uth **Ko**rean
SLBM's]{.underline} thus offer [Seoul a more reliable second
strike]{.underline} conventional capability which in the face of North
Korean nuclear and delivery system advances and especially growing
tactical nuclear systems signal a resolve and capability to match North
Korean advances.

But even if South Korea did not develop SLBMs, would North Korea be able
to take out all off Seoul's military capabilities in a first strike?
South Korean SLBMs may be just as much if not more about sending signals
to the United States. In national security affairs, as in most social
systems, one can rarely just do one thing. How North Korea interprets
this U.S.-ROK interaction could be just as if not more important for
influencing its own behaviour than how effective Pyongyang calculates
South Korea's SLBM's would be at targeting Kim's residences and growing
nuclear and conventional weapons systems. SLBM's may indeed offer more
survivability than ground based and aerial platforms, but they come at
great (financial) cost. Aerial platforms could presumably get even
closer to the relevant targets in North Korea, which would compensate
for the slower speed that these delivery vehicles would likely offer.
South Korea would also be able to field more of these than the 9
submarines planned. Indeed, the Defence Ministry most recently announced
the successful test of a long range air to surface missile to be fitted
to its 4.5 generation fighter aircraft.

While South Korea's [SLBM's]{.underline} do signal a greater effort to
improve the survivability of their conventional deterrence denial and
deterrence by punishment postures, they also [signal an intention to
adopt greater independence from]{.underline} and perhaps thereby
[**greater assurance from the** **U**nited **S**tates, a **greater
appetite for risk** and a potential **greater appetite for nuc**lear
weapon**s**]{.underline}. This menacing trifecta may well be designed to
make the North Koreans think twice if not blink twice (or spend thrice:
see below) about whether their nuclear weapons will get them what they
want from South Korea.

As Ian Bowers and Henrik Hiim noted, South Korea still closely
co-ordinates its strategy and military acquisitions with the United
States and still relies on Washington for important intelligence,
surveillance and reconnaissance data. The United States still retains
wartime operational control of South Korean military forces, but South
Korean submarines will not be easy to control unless they are commanded
by an American (and even then, the Cuban Missile crisis teaches us that
territorial control by the South Koreans or Americans of a submarine at
sea during a crisis may still be problematic). The [commanders of these
**sub**marine**s**]{.underline} are likely to [have greater freedom of
action]{.underline} in this sense [than anybody else in the **So**uth
**Ko**rean armed forces]{.underline}. To the extent that South Koreans
worry that President Biden or his successors may abandon them, this is
[a]{.underline} very [**strong signal of a willingness to act
independently of the U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}. After all, the
restrictions on South Korean ballistic missiles that Washington and
Seoul agreed on in 1979 expired earlier this year.

Where this becomes especially problematic is that South Korean
submarines armed with ballistic missiles will be especially threatening
to North Korea. These SLBM boats won't just be threatening to North
Korea because they improve the survivability of South Korea's
conventional forces. [**No**rth **Ko**rea cannot know for sure
that]{.underline} these boats and any ballistic [missiles
fired]{.underline} from them **[don't contain a nuclear
payload]{.underline}**. This [uncertainty makes them **especially
dangerous**]{.underline}, which makes them more likely to be targeted,
which exacerbates the fact that a South Korean submarine commander, not
the United States, will likely call the shots (or hopefully the lack of
them) in a crisis. Because North Korea can't be sure that any ballistic
missile launched from these submarines does not contain a nuclear
warhead, the North Koreans may assume that they might. South Korean
SLBMs are in this sense destabilising, although it is not clear that
North Korea's nuclear posture is any less dangerous. One might argue
that because the United States did not let South Korea develop nuclear
weapons in the Cold War, and that the North Koreans know this, the
latter would also conclude that Seoul would not (be permitted to)
develop nuclear weapons today. After all, despite much talk by Donald
Trump on the campaign trail about allies developing nuclear weapons he
maintained a fairly hard line on this when President. But North Korea
was not a nuclear power in the Cold War, and civilian and/or military
[leadership may conclude]{.underline} that [enough has changed that the
likelihood of a **So**uth **Ko**rean nuclear warheads in submarine
launched ballistic missiles also has **substantially
increased**]{.underline}.

Finally, the preceding discussion all assumes that South Korea does not
have nuclear weapons. But it would not be lost on the North Koreans that
[if **So**uth **Ko**rea wanted to develop a nuclear capability, this
would be a **very good first step**]{.underline} to do it. [Already
protected]{.underline} from any Chinese or North Korean preventive
strike [by the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline} alliance, nuclear
armed [**sub**marine**s**]{.underline}, at least if at sea, [would be
much harder to target than ground based or aerial systems]{.underline}.
And developing and sustaining the cost of multiple submarines capable of
launching ballistic missiles is signalling to the North Koreans that
Seoul has almost everything in place to develop a survivable nuclear
capability at what might be fairly short order. [**So**uth
**Ko**rea**'s** SLBM's are]{.underline} likely to be **[able to carry a
nuclear payload]{.underline}**. If the South Koreans are searching for a
way to signal to the North Koreans that Pyongyang really really needs to
think twice about continuing with the expansion and diversification of
its nuclear program, it would be hard to think of a better way to do it.
Like in a game of chicken, and as often happens between nuclear armed
rivals, [**So**uth **Ko**rea has responded to North Korean nuclear
expansion by signalling]{.underline} that [it]{.underline} too [is
willing to]{.underline} make moves that [**increase the risk of
nuc**lear **war**]{.underline}. South Korean SLBMs could indeed make
North Korea further double down on committing resources to its nuclear
program. But here, however, Seoul may be trying to outspend North Korea
and force Kim to commit all of his resources to his nuclear program to
the point of economic and regime collapse.

[Whether **So**uth **Ko**rea decides to develop **nuc**lear weapon**s**
will]{.underline} likely [depend on the **cred**ibility **of U.S.
assurances** and the severity of future **No**rth **Ko**rean
provocations]{.underline}. South Korean SLBM's may also be intended to
pressure China to be more helpful regarding North Korea and to take a
different line in broader Sino-U.S. competition. After all, China would
prefer South Korea to not have nuclear weapons. What influence South
Korean SLBM's would have on North Korea is anybody's guess, but a better
question might be what weapons systems -- tactical nuclear weapons?
submarine launched conventional missiles? -- Pyongyang will prioritise
in response. Those interested in reducing nuclear dangers on the Korean
peninsula, however, may no longer be able to focus their attention
exclusively on North Korea and the United States. With the emergence of
South Korean SLBMs, that ship has sailed.

###  AT//Export Controls

#### Export controls are [easily]{.underline} circumvented by international transfers and gas centrifuges\-\--empirical evidence.

R. Scott **Kemp 14**, Assistant Professor of Nuclear Science and
Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, "The
Nonproliferation Emperor Has No Clothes," International Security, Vol.
38, No. 4, Spring 2014, https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/89182

[When reports of the first Soviet nuclear weapon test arrived at the
White House]{.underline}, President Harry [Truman and]{.underline}
members [of his cabinet were so doubtful]{.underline} of Soviet
capabilities that [they rejected the reports on the grounds that a
Soviet weapon was impossible]{.underline}. One official later reported
that he believed the radioisotope fallout that revealed the Soviet test
was actually produced by a nuclear-reactor accident, a more likely
Soviet achievement.5 [U.S. intelligence analysts were similarly shocked
in 1964 when they discovered that China had tested a nuclear weapon made
from enriched uranium.]{.underline} The uranium path was understood to
be more difficult than that of plutonium, and the production of either
was thought to be well beyond China's capabilities. In its report
following China's first test, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA)
confessed that China had "a much more ambitious advanced-weapons program
than we had earlier thought possible."6

Despite these and other sobering experiences, technology is still seen
as an important barrier to proliferation. For decades, [the CIA based
its proliferation assessments not on motivations, but on forecasts of
how long it would take]{.underline} a country [to develop the technical
infrastructure]{.underline} needed to make a bomb.7 [U.S. and
international policies **put heavy emphasis on developing export
controls and technology safeguards**.]{.underline} Despite some efforts
in the 1960s to reduce the demand for nuclear weapons with the
Multilateral Force, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization security
coalition, and the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons,
nearly every nonproliferation institution before and since has focused
on technology.8

If nuclear weapons are inherently difficult to produce, then [why have
**tech**nology constraints]{.underline} sometimes [failed]{.underline}
to prevent proliferation? [The usual answer is to blame **foreign
assistance**]{.underline}. [The Soviets had spies in the Manhattan
Project. China received]{.underline} uranium-enrichment [**tech**nology
from the Soviet Union. Canada built the reactor that produced the
plutonium for India's first weapons]{.underline}.9 [Pakistan's
centrifuge]{.underline} program [was purchased]{.underline} piecemeal
[from European suppliers]{.underline}. [Brazil tried with technology
bought from Germany]{.underline}.10 [Iraq and Israel imported reactors
from France. Iran and **No**rth **Ko**rea imported centrifuges from
Pakistan]{.underline}, and so the history goes.11 A significant
literature is devoted to explicating the migration of capabilities from
the most technically advanced nations to some of the most technically
indigent.12 Scholars tend to agree that [these transfers are of two
major types: civil cooperation]{.underline} that enables later
proliferation [and]{.underline} cases of [intentional proliferation
assistance]{.underline}.13 While the technology-transfer model is rooted
in historical evidence, all that has been established in the literature
is that technology transfers took place. At times those transfers have
been helpful, but it is often presumed that transfers were important, if
not essential, to the acquisition of nuclear weapons, yet scant evidence
is provided.

With time, **[the necessity of technology transfer must be
questioned]{.underline}** simply [**because information and tech**nology
**that were once esoteric gradually become mainstream**]{.underline}. In
parallel, [the utility of transfers for proliferation is apt to decline
as motivations shift from the strategic]{.underline} (e.g., Soviet
proliferation to China, or Pakistani proliferation to North Korea) [to
the pecuniary]{.underline} (e.g., commercial transfers or black
markets). [The latter motivation has tended to produce problematic
outcomes for aspiring proliferators.]{.underline} Consider, for example,
Brazil's purchase of jet-nozzle enrichment technology from Germany.
Brazil squandered perhaps as much as \$100 million and half a decade
before realizing that the nozzle was a dud.14 [In some more recent
instances, such as Iraq's nuclear weapon program, financially motivated
transfers were **helpful but**]{.underline} arguably [**not
necessary**.]{.underline} For others, including some of the most
oft-cited cases such as Pakistan, Iran, and even Libya, I find evidence
to suggest that transfers set back these programs relative to what they
might have accomplished acting alone.

The most difficult technological step in building nuclear weapons is the
production of highly enriched uranium (HEU) or plutonium. [If HEU can be
obtained]{.underline}, then **[there are]{.underline}** essentially
[**no additional technologies needed** to make a bomb]{.underline}.
Unlike plutonium, [HEU can be used in both implosion- and gun-type
nuclear weapons]{.underline}. The latter type is a simple design that is
extremely robust to manufacturing defects and needs no exotic parts,
triggers, fuses, or materials. Such a weapon can be easily and quickly
made, and confidently fielded without testing. Gun-type bombs can even
be made small enough to fit onto missiles.15 Therefore, [to demonstrate
the]{.underline} effective [absence of supply-side constraints, it would
be sufficient to show that there exists a way to make HEU that is
accessible to most states, that is well known, and that states could be
confident of executing with a high chance of success.]{.underline}
**[Several such paths now exist, most using the gas centrifuge as the

have succeeded in deterring states from starting nuclear weapons

**[active]{.underline}** [nuclear weapons programs]{.underline}.31

failed to halt those countries' accelerating nuclear
programs]{.underline}. The reimposed sanctions on Iran in 2018 had a
reverse effect, causing Tehran to accelerate its nuclear program by
enriching uranium to levels that breached the limits put in place by the
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). While the effectiveness of
economic and financial sanctions warrants a wider discussion, neither
nonproliferation **[no]{.underline}**r **[sanctions]{.underline}** [have

#### We wouldn't do them.

Korean Nuclear Bomb", National Interest, 9/24/22,
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/korea-watch/case-south-korean-nuclear-bomb-204995

The NPT and Nuclear Domino Theory [The most common concern about
nuclearization is that South Korea's withdrawal from the]{.underline}
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons ([NPT) would bring
severe economic sanctions from the UN Security Council]{.underline}.
[North Korea withdrew]{.underline} from the treaty, [but it wasn't
the]{.underline} actual [reason why the UN sanctioned]{.underline}
Pyongyang. [Also, the NPT guarantees signatories the right to exit when
their supreme interests are threatened]{.underline}. Thus, **[the South
Korean government can leave the treaty based on the justification that
the increase of nuclear threats from North Korea undermines Seoul's
supreme security interests]{.underline}**. [South Korea can even avoid
sanctions, as Seoul would not need public nuclear tests because it
already has more developed nuclear technology than North
Korea]{.underline}. More importantly, [if South Korea suggests it will
exit from the treaty, it can send a clear message to the PRC and the
North that Seoul is open to all available options, increasing South
Korea-U.S. influence over Kim Jong-un's nuclear arsenal.]{.underline} It
is possible that [Washington]{.underline} might oppose South Korean
nuclearization at first, but it [is likely to accept it to deter both
Pyongyang and Beijing]{.underline}. [If sanctions are ever imposed on
South Korea,]{.underline} a global economic power, for developing its
nuclear weapons, [they wouldn't last long if Seoul's nuclear weapons
supported the United States' efforts to deter the PRC]{.underline}. When
[India]{.underline} conducted its fifth nuclear test in 1998, U.S.-led
[sanctions only lasted for three years]{.underline}. [Then]{.underline},
when President George [Bush visited India]{.underline} in 2005, both
states [signed a nuclear pact in order to check the PRC]{.underline}. As
was the case with India, [a democratic state that accepts International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards and non-proliferation obligations
as a nuclear-armed power can be an exception from the NPT and
Washington's nuclear policy. Democratic South Korea passes this test,
and its nuclear armament would eventually serve U.S.
interests.]{.underline}

#### Sanctions don't take out our impact. 

Jeff **Daniels 17**, former reporter for CNBC, quoting James Acton,
co-director of the nuclear policy program and a senior fellow at the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, "South Koreans want their
own nuclear weapons but doing so risks triggering a wider war," CNBC,
4-5-2017,
https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/24/south-koreans-want-their-own-nukes-but-doing-so-risks-wider-war.html

Seoul could face sanctions

Acton said it's understandable [there's uneasiness from **So**uth
**Ko**reans watching their neighbor]{.underline} to the north [develop
nuclear weapons]{.underline}, but added that there's still not been a
serious debate about the costs of acquiring nuclear weapons. "If there
was a very serious discussion of the costs, I think you would find much
less support for nuclear weapons," he said.

For instance, Acton said if South Korea were to arm itself with nuclear
weapons it would a violation of the country's international commitments,
which means [Seoul "would be very likely to have serious sanctions
imposed on it]{.underline}." Also, he said the U.S. might decide to no
longer offer its own security commitments to South Korea.

"The costs to South Korea of acquiring nuclear weapons are actually
very, very high," said Acton. "For South Korea, a country that's become
successful through international trade and engagement, **[the sanctions
would be incredibly painful and damaging."]{.underline}**

Back in the 1970s, South Korean President Park Chung-hee secretly began
a nuclear weapons development program. Once the U.S. learned about it,
the U.S. pressured Seoul to halt the program. As was the case then, [it
remains U.S. policy to oppose the spread of nuclear explosives in the
region.]{.underline}

At the same time, another option is the U.S. could redeploy tactical
nuclear weapons to South Korea. But doing so would violate the 1992
Seoul-Pyongyang joint agreement on denuclearization of the Korean
Peninsula. Pyongyang violated its end of the agreement in 2006 when it
exploded its first nuclear device under Kim Jong Il, father of the
regime's current young leader.

Also, bringing back tactical weapons to South Korea could make the U.S.
perhaps an even bigger target of North Korea and its communist neighbor,
China. Pyongyang recently threatened to lob ballistic missiles toward
U.S. military bases on the Pacific territory of Guam, which hosts the
Air Force's B-1B bombers and a Navy submarine base.

Reliability of security guarantees

"[**For as long as U.S. security guarantees are reliable, I don't think
So**uth **Ko**rea **has any need at this time for nuclear
weapons**]{.underline}," said Acton. "[The U.S. has pledged to defend
South Korea, including if necessary with the]{.underline} use of the
U.S. [nuclear arsenal."]{.underline}

That said, [**So**uth **Ko**rea has "serious concerns about the
reliability of those guarantees]{.underline} under President Donald
Trump," Acton said. He said Trump has done "a lot to disrupt the
U.S.-South Korean relationship --- and I think it's very important that
the disruption stop."

Experts say the areas where Washington has strained the alliance include
Trump's threat to terminate a "horrible" trade deal with South Korea as
well as suggestions in April by the president that Seoul should pay \$1
billion for the THAAD (or Terminal High Altitude Area Defense)
anti-missile defense system.

Also, Trump suggested on the presidential campaign trail that South
Korea should pay more money for its own defense, even suggesting that if
it doesn't he would be prepared to yank the roughly 28,000 U.S. forces
stationed on the peninsula. And after he took office some allies became
nervous since Trump was seen as slow to support NATO's Article 5, the
collective defense clause of the alliance.

"Donald [Trump's statements about allies needing to pay their fair share
and his hesitation about whether the United States would]{.underline}
[back up]{.underline} NATO's [Article 5]{.underline} commitment \...
[has all given]{.underline} people in [**So**uth **Ko**rea]{.underline}
**[greater anxiety about the]{.underline}** American military
**[commitment]{.underline}** to help protect South Korea," said Daryl
Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, a
Washington-based research and advocacy group

According to Kimball, the introduction of nuclear weapons into South
Korea, either by the U.S. or by South Korea pursuing its own indigenous
nuclear program, would have far more negative consequences than some
people might otherwise think.

["It would further solidify North Korea's commitment to keep
its]{.underline} own [nuclear weapons and **initiate an arms race in
East Asia involving China**]{.underline} and South Korea [that would not
be necessarily stable]{.underline}," said Kimball. "The allure of South
Korean nuclear weapons on the superficial level is understandable, but
you look at the consequences and they would cause much greater
insecurity for South Korea than they would provide security."

**[Even economic sanctions]{.underline}**---one of the nonproliferation
regime's most powerful tools---[may not be a realistic
deterrent]{.underline}. In [2016, China imposed unofficial sanctions on
South Korea after the Park Geun-hye administration agreed to the
deployment of the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile
defense system on Korean soil.]{.underline} The sanctions hit the South
Korean economy, but they did not wreak havoc on it, even though China
accounts for 25 percent of South Korean exports. Eventually,
[**Beijing removed the sanctions**, in no small part because Beijing
also needs access to South Korea's semiconductors and other high-tech
products to compete in the global economy.]{.underline}

[Likewise]{.underline}, [any **economic measures**]{.underline} that
[the United States and its allies]{.underline} and partners [could take
against South Korea would have to be **balanced against** deep
**existing** economic **links with Seoul**]{.underline}. [Among the
world's leaders in semiconductors, artificial intelligence, electric
batteries, green ships, and 5G/6G technologies]{.underline}, [**many
countries** would **find it difficult to sever ties with South Korea
to** the **detriment of their own economies.**]{.underline}

[Not to mention]{.underline}, nuclear-armed or not, [the **United
States**, Europe, and other likeminded partners would **certainly** much
rather **have South Korea in their** diplomatic and political
**corner**]{.underline} [as they focus on competition with
China]{.underline} and Russia. Former U.S. President Donald Trump, if
reelected, or a Trump-like successor, may even welcome South
Korea stepping up and taking greater responsibility for its own security
instead of "free-riding" on Washington's largesse. [Quietly, many
Western officials would probably not be opposed to a nuclear South Korea
in a region where it has to confront the nuclear arsenals of North
Korea, China, and Russia.]{.underline}

**this trite characterization** **underestimates** the potential

plutonium.

Democracy and Trust Must Come First

This is not to entirely rule out the option of nuclear armament for
Seoul. North Korea's continued possession and enhancement of its nuclear
arsenal is certain for the foreseeable future. And [despite U.S.
assurances of its commitment to extended deterrence and South Korea's
defense, South Korea may feel that developing and controlling its own
nuclear weapons]{.underline} [would be the best]{.underline} way to
ensure its security with or without international support. However, [as
it stands, South Korea's **faltering democracy**]{.underline} only
[reinforces]{.underline} international [doubts about nuclear
armament.]{.underline}

[A nuclear-armed South Korea led by someone like Yoon could **threaten
peace and stability**]{.underline}. This [concern is further heightened
by the fact that some of the most prominent advocates for nuclear
armament]{.underline} ---including Minister of Employment and Labor Kim
Moon-soo, Daegu Mayor Hong Jun Pyo and Seoul Mayor Oh Se Hoon -- [all
leading presidential hopefuls for the next election]{.underline}--- are
also among Yoon's most vocal supporters.

[Before advocating for nuclear weapons, South Korea must first restore
its democracy and the rule of law to rebuild trust]{.underline} that it
can act as a responsible state. [This is crucial to address concerns
that South Korea's acquisition of nuclear weapons **could heighten the
risk of conventional**]{.underline} conflicts [between the two
Koreas]{.underline} --- [conflicts that could **escalate to the nuclear
level** and endanger U.S. and global security.]{.underline}

The most [worrisome potential outcome stems from]{.underline} **[nuclear
fragility]{.underline}** and related human costs. Mutually assured
destruction (MAD) and the logic of nuclear deterrence makes planned
nuclear attacks inconceivable, but [the chance for]{.underline}
**[accidental]{.underline}** [nuclear escalation is]{.underline} **[very
high]{.underline}**, [given the]{.underline}
**[uncertainty]{.underline}** [of the nuclear arms races]{.underline}.
Bruce Blair (1985) demonstrated in his book, *Strategic Command and
Control: Redefning Nuclear Threats*, that [nuclear forces
are]{.underline} **[amazingly fragile]{.underline}** [because if the
nuclear command system is]{.underline} **[attacked]{.underline}**,
[control is]{.underline} **[lost]{.underline}**, [and no matter who
"wins"]{.underline} the war, [the winner will also]{.underline} **[lose
the war]{.underline}** [due to the inevitable loss of its own and
adversarial control, given]{.underline} that [even an]{.underline}
**[incapacitated]{.underline}** [enemy is likely to]{.underline}
**[retaliate in kind]{.underline}**, [and even a]{.underline}
**[few]{.underline}** [nuclear weapons coming back will be a very bad
day]{.underline} for a state. Yet, states and nuclear weapons
intellectuals took solace in [the]{.underline} **["survivability"
myth]{.underline}** that [ignored]{.underline} Blair's [warning on
nuclear fragility]{.underline}. Even Press (2019), who is supportive of
South Korea's independent nuclear path, aptly raises this issue. [As
the]{.underline} inter-**[Korean]{.underline}** [nuclear arms
race]{.underline} **[intensif-es]{.underline}**, [the structure of
nuclear fragility will be]{.underline} **[amplified]{.underline}**. [It
is]{.underline} **[certain]{.underline}** that when and [if **So**uth
**Ko**rea goes nuclear, the North will]{.underline}
**[double-down]{.underline}** [on proliferation and
deception]{.underline}.3 [**Nuc**lear **escalation**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[accidental]{.underline}** nuclear
**[clashes]{.underline}** [could become a]{.underline}
**[horrifying]{.underline}** [new **real**ity]{.underline}.

The human costs of nuclear clashes will be unbearably high in the Korean
context. Lisowski and von Hippel (2023) identify six impacts of nuclear
weapons use that would result in unimaginable death and destruction.
Human casualties can come from various sources: thermal fuence (heat)
from nuclear blasts; firestorms; physical damage caused by blast
overpressure; prompt radiation from nuclear detonation itself; fallout
radiation; and radiation-induced cancer deaths. The level of casualties
would vary by the number of nuclear bombs used. Jefrey Lewis (2017)
estimated two million deaths, mostly Koreans and some Americans, and
Japanese. But the exact numbers would be impossible to track. Zagurek
Jr. (2017) also shows similar figures. According to calculations using
the Nuclear Bomb Effects Computer, if nuclear detonations happened over
Seoul and Tokyo with North Korea's current estimated weapons, it could
result in as many as 2.1 million fatalities and 7.7 million injuries.
The human cost would be staggering even without nukes: back in 1994,
when Clinton was contemplating preemptive strikes on North Korea, the
commander of US forces in South Korea estimated over a million deaths in
and around the Korean Peninsula in the first 60 days of the war (Fefer
2017).

Contrary to expectations of the pro-nuke forces, [independent nuclear
weapons development will result in]{.underline} **[severe adverse
security consequences]{.underline}**. [If both]{.underline} South and
North Korea [nuclearize, their relationship would be characterized
by]{.underline} **[escalation imperatives]{.underline}** [that would
make the peninsula]{.underline} **[highly unstable]{.underline}**,
[with]{.underline} potentially **[catastrophic]{.underline}**
[consequences]{.underline}. Far from reinforcing South Korea's already
overwhelming ofensive military capabilities, [nukes would]{.underline}
**[undermine]{.underline}** [deterrence]{.underline} based on
conventional forces, [and even]{.underline} **[reduce]{.underline}**
th[e South's ability to use its conventional forces]{.underline} in
response to a North Korean attack. [Both Koreas would be faced with
a]{.underline} **[nuclear-armed adversary]{.underline}** [with
a]{.underline} **[mutual]{.underline}** [incentive to strike
first]{.underline}. [Each would]{.underline} therefore [remain in a
state of]{.underline} **[constant nuclear alert]{.underline}** [in case
the other side intended to attack immediately]{.underline}. This state
of [constant fear would drive both states to invest in]{.underline}
**[surveillance tech]{.underline}**nologies [and increase]{.underline}
**[mutual distrust]{.underline}** (Hayes and Moon 2015, 397, 402). The
new nuclear path will only justify North Korea's nuclear status and
diminish the opposition from China and Russia to the North's nuclear
armament.

Equally [troublesome is a]{.underline} **[nuclear domino
effect]{.underline}** [in]{.underline}
**[N]{.underline}**orth**[e]{.underline}**ast **[A]{.underline}**sia.
South Korea's [nuclear armament will]{.underline}
**[instantly]{.underline}** [force]{.underline} **[China]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[Russia]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} strengthen
their nuclear capabilities to **[counter it]{.underline}**. Also, some
ultra-[rightists in]{.underline} **[Japan]{.underline}** [will relish
the prospect that Seoul might make such a move so that they
can]{.underline} **[justify]{.underline}** [Japanese **nuc**lear
weapon**s**]{.underline}. They have been advocating Japan's nuclear
latency after China undertook its first nuclear testing in October 1964.
[Japan has]{.underline} **[nuclear materials]{.underline}** (47.8 tons
of plutonium and 1.5 tons of enriched uranium as of 2016),
**[tech]{.underline}**nological **[competence]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[financial capabilities]{.underline}**. Once
[the]{.underline} political [decision]{.underline} is made, [with the
support of national consensus]{.underline}, **[Japan]{.underline}**
[could go nuclear relatively easily]{.underline}. Japan has always been
worried about the advent of a nuclear Korea armed with nationalism (Moon
2021). New nuclear threats coming from China, Russia, and even Japan, in
addition to those from North Korea, will drive Seoul's defense planners
to face an unprecedentedly harsh security reality.

THE WRONG PATH

Proponents argue that the acquisition of independent nuclear weapons is
essential for national security. But this argument appears flawed. The
goals of national security are to ensure the survival of the state, the
prosperity of the country and the prestige of the nation. But the path
toward [acquiring nuclear weapons could have **paradoxical
results**]{.underline}, not only [**jeopardizing** South Korea's
**survival** and **endangering** its **prosperity**]{.underline} but
also [severely damaging its prestige in the international
community]{.underline}.

The case for acquiring nuclear weapons is based on the argument that
America's extended deterrence is not reliable and that South Korea
should counter North Korea's nuclear weapons with ones of its own. But
[we have more to lose than to gain from such a choice]{.underline}.
[South Korean nuclear armament would not only set off a **nuclear arms
race** on the Korean **Peninsula** by precipitating an even more rapid
build-up of Pyongyang's nuclear arsenal but also increase the likelihood
of a **nuclear war** occurring because of a **misperception**,
**miscalculation** or **mistake**]{.underline}.

It [would also provoke a **nuclear buildup** and other countermoves in
China and the Russian Far East, further heightening **military
tensions** on the Korean Peninsula]{.underline}. If South Korea goes
nuclear while maintaining its alliance with the US, China and Russia
would regard South Korea as the primary target for a nuclear strike,
turning it into the front line of nuclear confrontation between the US
and China/Russia. Japan has always been wary of a unified Korea armed
with nuclear weapons and driven by nationalism. Thus, it is very likely
to counter a nuclear South Korea with its own nuclear weapons, [placing
the Korean Peninsula at the center of a **nuclear domino effect** in
Northeast Asia]{.underline}.

#### Nuclear war is [guaranteed]{.underline} from [North Korea]{.underline} and [domino effects]{.underline}. 

Mun Suk **Ahn &** Young Chul **Cho 14**, Associate Professor of
Political Science and Diplomacy at Chonbuk National University; Korea

Korea?", International Journal, Vol. 69, Issue 1, March 2014,
https://www.jstor.org/stable/24709339

Rational deterrence theorists-Kenneth Waltz chief among them-claim that
nuclear proliferation leads to stability since nuclear weapons are
controlled by rational leaders\' careful decisions. They argue that
nuclear warheads can contribute to stable deterrence if states avoid
preventive strikes, develop nuclear weapons that can survive a first
strike, avert accidental nuclear war, and prevent terrorist theft of
nuclear weapons.10

However, [stability can]{.underline} also [be affected by the degree of
internal stability and]{.underline} the [command-control
arrangement]{.underline} of each state, [as well as by regional
environments]{.underline}. In practice, [**rational deterrence theory is
difficult to apply to the Korea**n **peninsula**]{.underline}. [A number
of battles have **broke**n out]{.underline} between the two Koreas
[since the]{.underline} 1953 [truce]{.underline} agreement, undeterred
by the fact that the North has had nuclear arms since 2006. In
particular, on the West Sea of the peninsula, the two Koreas do not
agree on the Northern Limit Line (NLL). This disagreement has led to the
first Yeonpyeong Sea Battle (June 1999), the second Yeonpyeong Sea
Battle (June 2002), the Daecheong Sea Battle (November 2009), the
sinking of the corvette Cheonan (March 2010), and the artillery shelling
of Yeonpyeong Island (November 2010). [Since the North infiltrates the
NLL many times each year, no improvement is expected]{.underline} in the
near future. [Under these antagonistic conditions, **the nuclear arming
of both North and South Korea could accidentally result in a nuc**lear
**war**]{.underline}.

Organization theorists observe that military organizations often act in
ways that contradict rational behaviours and lead to accidental or
deliberate nuclear war.11 [The huge military organizations in North and
South Korea]{.underline}-with more than 1,000,000 and 600,000 troops,
respectively-[are not likely to be exceptions]{.underline}, especially
[given the very real tensions and recurring military
conflicts.]{.underline}

Furthermore, [a corollary of Seoul\'s nuclear armament would almost
certainly be **Pyongyang\'s reinforcement of its own nuclear
power.**]{.underline} [**No**rth **Ko**rea is]{.underline} reportedly
[trying to increase its stock of, and miniaturize, its nuclear
warheads]{.underline}. **[The South\'s nuclearization would only hasten
that process.]{.underline}** [It would]{.underline} also [instigate a
serious arms race in Northeast Asia by **press**ing **Japan and Taiwan
to go nuclear.** In Japan, many politicians and activists are now
arguing for nuclear armament]{.underline}. The current [Abe]{.underline}
government [has sought to revise the constitution, which bans Japan from
rearming and waging war]{.underline}, in order to change the status of
the Self-Defense Forces and to restore Japan\'s right to use military
power abroad.

[An arms race would not only undermine stability in Northeast Asia but
also prevent states in the region from]{.underline} developing
economically. This consequence contradicts the argument presented by
South Korean conservatives who value both strong national defence and
[economic growth.]{.underline}

In addition, [the nuclearization of South Korea would]{.underline}
seriously [undercut]{.underline} the country\'s close [ties with the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. The United States has long
opposed Seoul possessing its own nuclear weapons, fearing that it would
result in an arms race in Northeast Asia and damage to the integrity of
the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty. Washington would, therefore,
reduce its military cooperation with the South if it developed nuclear
weapons. [This situation would be detrimental to Seoul\'s security
because South Korea still requires American military intelligence, which
is critical to the operation of South Korean armed forces.]{.underline}

[The Seoul government fully understands the reasons against a nuclear
South Korea]{.underline} and often reaffirms its desire for direct
denuclearization talks with the North. This has been consistent
government policy. South Korea is equipped with the technical and
industrial capacity to produce nuclear warheads within a few years of
any decision to go nuclear.12 The South is the world\'s fifth-largest
producer of atomic energy, and it has not suffered a nuclear accident
since the beginning of nuclear energy production in 1978. The literature
on nuclearization does not derive consistent predictions from these
circumstances. On the one hand, the theory that states equipped with
cutting-edge nuclear technology tend to be nuclear-armed would point to
the likelihood that Seoul will go nuclear. However, motivational theory,
which emphasizes incentives and intentions, rather than technology, in
relation to nuclear armament, leads to the opposite conclusion. In fact,
**[the South has the capability, but not the intention to go
nuclear.]{.underline}**

[Two further issues related to the South\'s going nuclear remain
unresolved: the transfer of wartime operational control and the prestige
of the scientific community]{.underline}. The US is scheduled to
transfer wartime operational control to South Korea in December 2015,
according to the South Korea-US agreement. South Korean conservatives
have been worrying that the subsequent dissolution of the South Korea-US
Combined Forces Command will undermine the South\'s national defence.
The concern is likely to grow as the date of the transfer approaches and
may buttress the argument for Seoul\'s nuclear armament.

At the same time, scientists may argue that further developments in
technology and scientific knowledge will enhance the prestige of the
South Korean scientific community. In the case of India\'s nuclear
development, the scientific community was motivated to produce nuclear
weapons in order to demonstrate its capabilities.13 [In South Korea, the
uranium enrichment experiment in 2000 was attributed to several
scientists\' desire to confirm their capabilities. **Nuc**lear
**tech**nology in **So**uth **Ko**rea is constantly developing and
scientists\' desire to increase their prestige may become a
factor]{.underline} in the debate.

[Public Opinion Towards Nuclear Armament in South Korea]{.underline} and
Japan

The [South Korean public has **long supported** acquiring nuclear
weapons, with upwards of 75%]{.underline} of the population [expressing
support]{.underline} in recent opinion polls. ​​Elite opinion has
historically been more divided; however, [polling indicates that South
Korean political elites could change their position on nuclear weapons
**in response to U.S. signals of ​​abandonment**]{.underline}, such as
troop withdrawals. Recent [South Korean debate about developing its
​​nuclear capability **likely reflects** that South Korea **is no longer
willing** to take the U.S. extended deterrence commitment at face
value]{.underline} -- it [wants to be more **actively involved** in its
​​defense and requires more information to feel assured]{.underline}.

In contrast to South Korea, the Japanese public remains firmly opposed
to acquiring nuclear weapons. Recent polls suggest that more than 70% of
the populace believes Japan should promote global nuclear disarmament,
with similar numbers in support of Japan signing onto the Treaty on the
Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. ​Despite an overwhelmingly unified
public, prominent Japanese politicians have publicly advocated a
different approach. Most notably, in ​2024, Prime Minister Ishiba called
for nuclear sharing with the United States through the creation of an
"Asian NATO."

[In the event that South Korea moves forward with developing an
independent nuclear capability, **Japan may also be more likely to
nuclearize**.]{.underline} At minimum, this scenario would likely result
in contentious political debate in Japan. Ultimately, however, the
current threshold for acquiring nuclear weapons in Japan is very high.
It is thus important to consider South Korea and Japan independently
rather than treat the region as a monolith.

#### It worsens security concerns.

that **threat** on its **own**]{.underline}. Gone will be the

[Seoul Would Deal a **Serious Blow** to the **Nonproliferation
Regime**]{.underline}

South Korea would be the [first **democratic** country to **withdraw**
from the NPT, dealing a blow to decades of US **leadership** in
preventing nuclear proliferation]{.underline}. As serious as the North
Korean nuclear threat is, I believe Washington would have no choice but
to condemn and counter the South's decision to build the bomb. The
nonproliferation regime is a complex fabric of treaties, agreements,
assurances, practices, and international organizations. North Korea's
bomb and Iran's pursuit of the bomb have already stressed the regime.
The negative impacts of Russia's invasion of Ukraine are playing out
now. South Korea should not join these countries in undermining the
regime.

[Its withdrawal or expulsion from the International Atomic Energy Agency
(**IAEA**) would also put it in company with the **only other country**
in that situation---namely North Korea]{.underline}. Instead of playing
a supportive role in organizations like the IAEA, the Nuclear Suppliers
Group and the Missile Technology Control Regime, [South Korea would be
**shunned** by the **international community**]{.underline}.

South Korea's withdrawal from the NPT would also [undermine one of the
**most effective elements** of the regime]{.underline}, [namely forging
**security alliances** to extend **security protection** to allied
states]{.underline}, [**eliminating** the need for these countries to
build their own **nuclear deterrents**. So far, the United States has
done this successfully in **Europe** and in **Northeast

### Impact---SoKo Prolif---Korean Peninsula 

#### It would destabilize the region, not deter North Korea.

[**Militarily**, a nuclear weapon would not make **So**uth **Ko**rea
safer]{.underline}. [The ROK already has the **conventional
capabilities** needed to **strike** any target in North Korea through
the use of **short-range ballistic missiles** and **precision strike**
weapons, has recently committed **\$81 billion** toward strengthening
its **pre-existing defense capabilities**]{.underline}, and has
established a strategic command to oversee its "three-axis" defense
system. Nuclear weapons would [add little while increasing **paranoia**
north of the **DMZ**]{.underline}.

To reinforce reliability of the U.S. commitment to extended deterrence,
Presidents Joe Biden and Yoon announced the Washington Declaration in
early 2023, as well as the creation of the bilateral Nuclear
Consultative Group. In early November, the two countries updated their
Tailored Deterrence Strategy agreement for the first time in a decade to
reflect their "ironclad" commitment to collective security underscored
by the symbolic deployment of major U.S. military assets to the country,
such as a nuclear ballistic missile submarine and a nuclear capable B-52
bomber. [South Korea is]{.underline} not only [**conventionally**
capable of deterring a nuclear attack by North Korea,]{.underline} but
it is also protected by a renewed commitment to extended deterrence by
the United States, [making the **development** of a nuclear weapon
**redundant** and **escalatory**]{.underline}.

Economically, a nuclear weapon would not make South Korea safer. A
withdrawal from the NPT would bring an array of potential sanctions with
the ability to cause real economic damage. Even if the impact of these
sanctions is mitigated by allies to protect regional security interests,
the impact of potential Chinese sanctions would be severe. Moreover,
this withdrawal would impact international cooperation with Seoul's
nuclear energy program, an economic and energy priority.

Thus, although a nuclear weapon might make South Koreans feel safer, at
least temporarily, it would not make the country any more secure.
Conversely, creation of a nuclear weapon will undermine South Korean
efforts to protect itself against a North Korean threat. Instead, the
[**legitimate** security concerns voiced by South Koreans could be
addressed by strengthening **conventional capabilities** as well as
engaging with **international arms control** efforts and dialogue across
the **DMZ**]{.underline}. Such measures would do more to promote
confidence among Korean citizens than engaging in a destabilizing arms
race.

### Impact---SoKo Prolif---North Korea

#### Proliferation causes North Korean [first strikes]{.underline}.

Stuart **Leavenworth 17**, editor and reporter with McClatchy DC, "South
Korea considers a nuclear arsenal to counter the North," 07-28-2017,
https://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/national/article164177042.html

South Korea is home to more than 20 nuclear power plants, and if it
decided to pursue a nuclear weapons program, it would have both the
expertise and material to do so.

Still, it would be no simple task for South Korea to "go nuclear."

[Building nuclear weapons would jeopardize **So**uth **Ko**rea**'s**
alliance with the **U**nited **S**tates, and]{.underline} also [force
Seoul to withdraw from a U.S. nuclear agreement]{.underline} that bans
it from independently enriching uranium or reprocessing plutonium. In
turn, it would expose South Korea to international sanctions, similar to
those imposed on North Korea after its first nuclear test, in 2006.

[It is]{.underline} also [unlikely that Beijing would sit idly by while
South Korea deployed nuclear weapons nearby]{.underline}. [China would
likely ramp up its own arsenal,]{.underline} especially if Japan
followed Seoul's lead and launched its own nuclear weapons program.

There are strategic reasons for South Korea not to go down this road,
said Pinkston. Even with its technological know-how, [**So**uth
**Ko**rea would need several years to develop a reliable nuclear
arsenal, leaving it exposed during that time.]{.underline}

["**No**rth **Ko**rea **would have an incentive to strike
first**]{.underline}," said Pinkston. "[**So**uth **Ko**rea **would be
in a very vulnerable position."**]{.underline}

Currently, [South Korea's pro-nuclear contingent of lawmakers does not
have the votes]{.underline} to pursue a nuclear weapons program. But
[that could change in subsequent elections, depending on what happens in
Washington, Pyongyang and Seoul.]{.underline}

"There are an increasing number of lawmakers who are studying armament,
or what we call nuclear sovereignty," said lawmaker Kim Jong Dae, a
member of the Justice Party, which is generally aligned with President
Moon's Democratic Party.

"[**This will** definitely **emerge as a mainstream political
issue**]{.underline}," he added, [**if No**rth **Ko**rea **demonstrates
it possesses the capability to launch a missile strike against major
U.S. cities.**]{.underline}

[Japan's and **So**uth **Ko**rea**'s** nascent nuclear **arsenal**s
would]{.underline} likely **[be very vulnerable to a disarming
strike]{.underline}**, especially **[by Chinese nuclear
forces.]{.underline}** For many years after building independent nuclear
forces, [both the United Kingdom and France struggled with the dilemma
of vulnerability]{.underline} to a preclusive first strike [by the
Soviet Union]{.underline}. On this point, the late American strategist
Albert Wohlstetter keenly observed in 1961: "England's cancellation of
its costly program for the Blue Streak missile marked the conscious
transition from a hopefully 'independent deterrent' to the much less
ambitious 'independent contribution to the deterrent.' And it is not
without reason---as \[French public intellectual\] François Mauriac has
pointed out---that France's first 'deterrent' vehicles will be called
'Mirage.'"19 Indeed, [vulnerability to a disarming strike would likely
lead Tokyo and Seoul to divert]{.underline} [increasingly more of their
already finite defense funds towards investments to improve the
survivability of their independent nuclear arsenals and their
**c**ommand-**and-c**ontrol, and thus away from procurements of
**critical non-nuclear military assets**]{.underline} [that would help
to defend shared security interests with Washington. The net effect
would be to **harm** Japanese and South Korean **military coop**eration

These [first several months]{.underline} of 2025 [have been especially
**tumultuous** for both the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[and So]{.underline}uth [Ko]{.underline}rea. US President Donald
[Trump]{.underline} has spent the beginning of his second term
[upend]{.underline}ing [longstanding policies and norms]{.underline}.
One of his more recent, all-consuming focuses has been trade deficits
and so-called "[unfair **tariff disparities**]{.underline}", which he
addressed with sweeping "reciprocal" tariffs against nearly every other
nation. One week later, and most of those tariffs were temporarily
paused. His inconsistency and capriciousness have caused US allies to
doubt the reliability of US security guarantees and extended deterrence,
while also stoking concern for the world economy and free trade norms.

South Korea has also seen its fair share of internal turmoil, beginning
with (now former) President Yoon Suk Yeol's martial law declaration in
December 2024. For the last four months, South Korean politics have been
in disarray; the country is still without an elected leader. While the
period of martial law itself was a flash in the pan, the fallout and
existing fractures it revealed in South Korean society and politics are
not easily salved.

Amid this uncertainty, [US-ROK relations]{.underline} were sure to be
tested. But Trump has given South Korean leaders additional reasons to
be concerned. Experts fear that current interim leadership in Seoul may
be pressured [into]{.underline} sweeping concessions with [long-term
consequences]{.underline}.

In the coming months, South Korea should remain focused on its own
presidential election and repairing its domestic fabric, but interim
leadership can also explore ways to weather Trump's demands, including
by reframing existing efforts, as Canada did with their border plan.

Though South Korea has largely not been at the forefront of President
Trump's agenda, that is not to say that the US-ROK relationship has
remained stagnant or purely speculative in the first stretch of the new
administration. To best understand where we are now, it is crucial to
examine three areas: the impacts of South Korean domestic turbulence,
Trump's global trade war, and the prospects of nuclear proliferation.

South Korea's leadership crisis

South Korea's current domestic instability and leadership turnover
threatens to undermine its negotiating position with the US. In both his
first term, and the start of his second, President Trump has fixated on
the interpersonal side of US foreign relations, favouring strong leaders
that have a firm handle on their constituents and are vocal in their
praise of his leadership. Look no further than Japan's former Prime
Minister Shinzo Abe, who leveraged an active personal relationship with
Trump in his first term to gain a number of symbolic and policy wins,
including Trump's adoption of Abe's Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP)
strategy. Former South Korean President Yoon knew this well, privately
and publicly congratulating then President-elect Trump and, soon after,
returning to the golf course to practice his swing for future meetings.

With Yoon officially removed from office by the South Korean
Constitutional Court, his successor will face the challenging task of
building a relationship with Trump from scratch while attempting to
stabilise the domestic political situation. The martial law declaration
may have been the initiating event, but South Korea's 'leadership
crisis' has persisted in the ensuing four months, with the role of
president changing hands three times. The first brought then Prime
Minister Han Duck Soo into a short-lived stint as interim President.
Barely two weeks later, he also faced impeachment and was replaced by
his deputy, Choi Sang Mok. The latest turnover, Han's reinstatement in
March, will not endure either, as Yoon's removal triggered preparations
for the next presidential election, set to be held on 3 June.

This **[instability]{.underline}** is not happenstance; it [is a symptom
of the **polarisation**]{.underline} that has [infected South Korean
politics and threatens the functioning of its democrac]{.underline}y.
The sheer number of both pro- and anti-Yoon protests since the martial
law declaration serve as evidence of this deep divide. According to the
ACLED, January 2025 saw a 61 per cent increase in pro-Yoon
demonstrations compared to December 2024, and such protests have more
closely matched rates of anti-Yoon protests since the start of February
2025. That is all to say, even when a new president is elected in the
coming months, they will have a challenging future ahead in quelling
domestic unrest, unifying a divided country, and presenting a strong
image in future negotiations with the Trump administration.

Donald [Trump wants more **money**]{.underline}. The more the better,
and this time [from South Korea]{.underline}, as it turns out. [On his
campaign trail, Trump announced]{.underline} his entirely unrealistic
[idea to increase South Korea's **annual contribution** to the
stationing of 28,500 US military troops on South Korean soil from 1 to
**10 billion** USD]{.underline}. Evidently, [that is a **non-starter**
request]{.underline}, but fortunately, if there is one thing we have
learned from Donald Trump over the lasts 6 month, it is that -- more
often than not -- much of what he says on Monday is no longer relevant
on Tuesday. For the time being, Washington will reportedly continue
sticking to the bilateral stationing costs agreement adopted in October
2024.

Back then, the US and South Korea agreed on a new five-year plan on
sharing the cost of financing US troops stationed in South Korea. For
the year 2025, it was stipulated, Seoul will increase its annual
financial contributions by 8.3% totalling roughly \$1.13 billion. After
that (i.e. for the four remaining years of the agreement), the increase
of Seoul's contributions will amount to 5% annually. Of course, it was
no accident that Seoul decided to adopt such agreement when the return
of Donald Trump to the US presidency began to look increasingly likely.
Indeed, given that the agreement was adopted between Seoul and the
previous US administration, it can be anything but excluded that [Trump
might rather sooner than later return to the topic and resume **urging**
Seoul to "**pay up**", as he typically puts it]{.underline}.

When announcing to impose tariffs onto all countries except Russia a few
months ago, Trump had indicated that he planned to make South Korean
burden-sharing contributions a part of negotiations over tariffs.
Nonetheless, South Korea is not alone in finding itself being confronted
with [Trump's idea to link **tariffs** with contributions to the
**stationing costs** of US troops in the region]{.underline}. Japan,
hosting 55,000 US military troops on Japanese territory, is on the same
Trumpian blacklist. Seoul has tentatively decided that it is not
planning to allow linking tariffs with its financial contributions to
the stationing costs of US military when negotiating with Washington.
Tokyo has done the same, and many in Japan even suggest that the country
should use its financial power as leverage over Washington. Japan is
holding \$1.13 trillion (roughly half the size of the Italian economy)
in US Treasury bonds and there have been voices in Japan which suggest
that Tokyo could -- if push came to shove -- use the Treasury bonds as
leverage, threatening to sell them on a large scale as part of
negotiation tactics. In fairness, none of said suggestions gained any
traction, but they might still have served as a reminder that the
world's third economy is less of a "pushover alliance partner" than
Trump thinks it is.

[Trump's propensity to **rock** the boat of Washington's **alliances**
in Asia has **no** apparent **limits**]{.underline}, thus far. In late
May, the Wall Street Journal reported that Washington is [considering to
withdraw **4,500 US troops** from South Korea and relocate them to
**Guam**]{.underline}. While Washington and Seoul were quick to deny
that a US troop withdrawal had ever been discussed, Korea expert Victor
Cha writes in an article for the Center for Strategic and International
Studies (CSIS) that the Pentagon, the US Forces in Korea, and the US
Indo-Pacific Command [are indeed seriously considering to reduce the
number of US troops stationed in South Korea]{.underline}. However,
Victor Cha claims to be concerned about further matters, fearing in a
recent Foreign Affairs article that the US [president might become
tempted to revive his attempts to **engage** **Kim** Jong Un. Trump's
"America First" policies]{.underline}, Cha argues, could [push the US
President towards cutting a deal with the North Korean dictator that
could envision Pyongyang agreeing to **arms control** in return for
Trump giving up on the long-established US policy of **denuclearizing**
North Korea and officially recognizing the country as nuclear weapons
state]{.underline}. "Arms control", Cha expounds, implicates convincing
Pyongyang to forego providing weapons technology to Middle Eastern
states in general and Iran in particular. This is an agreement which,
according to Cha, would further [endanger the **security** of
Washington's allies in the region, such as **South Korea** and
Japan]{.underline}.

#### Tariffs give Lee an [ultimatum]{.underline}.

When he assumed office in June, South Korean President Lee Jae Myung
inherited a country in crisis. His first priority was restoring
political legitimacy to the office of the president following his
predecessor's impeachment for declaring martial law in December 2024.
Now, his political credibility depends on an ambitious economic
reorientation, including addressing youth unemployment and declining
industrial output, among other factors, to reverse South Korea's sagging
economic outlook.

A month later, U.S. President Donald Trump announced [25 percent tariffs
on South Korean]{.underline} (and Japanese) goods. [Trump's **punitive**
trade measures---framed as an "invitation" for South Korea to
"participate in the extraordinary Economy of the United
States]{.underline}"---now [threaten]{.underline} to derail the
[export-dependent recovery]{.underline} that has given Lee's presidency
its early momentum.

Now, Lee's core challenge isn't whether his reforms are well-designed,
but whether he can overcome the external constraints---from global trade
wars to China-U.S. technology competition to global supply chain
disruption---that determine South Korea's economic fate, regardless of
Seoul's policy choices. Lee's pragmatic promises have sparked cautious
optimism, but his ability to deliver depends less on political skill
than on geopolitical developments, corporate governance battles with
interests of the entrenched chaebol (South Korean multinational
conglomerates), and market forces that operate far outside the
president's influence.

Trump's Economic Ultimatum

[Trump's tariff]{.underline} announcement reveals how dramatically U.S.
relations [with]{.underline} its key [Asian allies]{.underline} [have
shifted]{.underline} from strategic partnerships to something akin [to
**economic coercion**]{.underline}. The official tariff letters [to
South Korea]{.underline} and Japan are virtually identical, with only
country names and leader titles changed, signaling that Trump may view
both relationships through the same transactional lens. The ultimatum is
stark: Both countries face 25 percent tariffs on all exports unless
companies relocate manufacturing to the United States by August 1. Trump
characterizes their trade surpluses as threats to the U.S. economy and
national security, transforming routine commercial relations into a
zero-sum security competition.

Although Japan and South Korea face the same ultimatum,
[So]{.underline}uth [Ko]{.underline}rea['s]{.underline}
[**vulnerabilities** run deeper]{.underline}. The country's economy is
significantly more trade-dependent, with exports representing over 40
percent of GDP, compared to Japan's 20 percent. Japan possesses a larger
domestic market and lower reliance on trade as a share of economic
output, providing more cushion against external shocks. In other words,
[So]{.underline}uth [Ko]{.underline}rea['s]{.underline} smaller domestic
market means export [disrupt]{.underline}ion to the [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates hits harder and faster, making Lee's challenge more
acute than Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba's in navigating
Trump's demands while maintaining economic growth.

[Trump's announcement]{.underline} [represents]{.underline} an
existential [threat to Lee's]{.underline} governing
[strategy]{.underline}. Lee had staked his candidacy on leveraging South
Korea's strategic value to achieve economic transformation through
enhanced [U.S.--South Korea cooperation]{.underline}. Trump's tariffs
not only [undermine that narrative]{.underline} but [force
Lee]{.underline} [into]{.underline} [an **impossible
choice**]{.underline}: accept economic concessions that could [devastate
South Korean exporters or risk trade confrontation]{.underline} that
would destroy the market rally that fuels his political support.

The Geopolitical Vise

Beyond [Trump's]{.underline} immediate [tariff **threat**]{.underline},
Lee must navigate U.S.-China technology competition that [forces South
Korean companies into **impossible** choices]{.underline}. Samsung and
SK Hynix face restrictions on Chinese operations even as they invest
billions in American facilities--- including Samsung's impressive \$45
billion investment near Austin, Texas, for semiconductor fabrication
lines and research facilities. This market split [reduces the
flexibility that enabled South Korea's industrial **juggernauts** to
thrive and forces strategic decisions that compromise global market
access regardless of Seoul's preferences]{.underline}.

The technology competition illustrates how great power rivalry
constrains middle power options. South Korean companies built global
leadership by serving both U.S. and Chinese markets, but Washington's
security concerns over the past decade---spanning several
administrations---have required choosing sides in ways that reduce South
Korean competitiveness. Lee's promises of enhanced U.S. cooperation and
domestic innovation sound reasonable in theory, but implementation
timelines may not match the market expectations his campaign rhetoric
created.

The broader trend toward [economic nationalism]{.underline} in major
markets [limits So]{.underline}uth [Ko]{.underline}rea['s]{.underline}
traditional export-led growth [model]{.underline}. While Lee's proposed
pragmatic approach to alliance management may help in bilateral
negotiations, the fundamental shift toward geoeconomic competition
operates beyond any South Korean president's influence and constrains
the policy space available for domestic economic transformation.

### NUQ---Alliance Low---Impossible 

#### It's [impossible]{.underline} for Korea to align with US policies.

For Washington, Lee's economic pragmatism creates opportunities for
deeper bilateral cooperation. But [U.S. policymakers]{.underline} should
recognize that South Korea's domestic challenges may [limit Seoul's
ability to fully align with Washington's priorities]{.underline} when
[they conflict with immediate economic **survival**]{.underline}.
Trump's [tariff **ultimatum** forces exactly this kind of impossible
choice]{.underline}.

The next six months will reveal whether Lee's pragmatic gamble can
deliver both market performance and structural progress when success
depends largely on forces beyond his control. The stakes extend beyond
South Korean politics to questions about democratic capitalism's ability
to address [long-term challenges]{.underline} while satisfying
short-term political demands in an [increasingly **constrained** global
environment]{.underline}. Lee's presidency may ultimately prove that in
a globalized economy, domestic political leadership matters less than
the external forces that determine national economic fate.

### No Link---Alliances Resilient

#### The alliance is [resilient]{.underline}.

Bruno **Tertrais 22**, Senior Research Fellow at the Foundation for
Strategic Research, Ph.D. from the Paris Political Science Institute,

https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/entangling-alliances-europe-the-united-states-asia-and-the-risk-of-a-new-1914

That said, [most]{.underline} pre-1990 [defense guarantees have overall
proven **remarkably resilient**]{.underline}.24 [Alliances are regularly
described as]{.underline} being "[in crisis]{.underline}." Yet as
Alexander Lanoszka puts it, "[dysfunction is a]{.underline} permanen,t
[**feature of alliance politics, not a** temporary
**bug**]{.underline}."25

[US alliances were successfully tested in 2001]{.underline}. NATO's
[Article 5 was invoked]{.underline} for the first time ever. [It was not
a given that the Alliance would survive]{.underline} the
[Iraq]{.underline} War [and major transatlantic crises such as the
Snowden affair]{.underline}. The Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal
Assistance---[the Rio Treaty]{.underline}---[was also
invoked]{.underline} in 2001, as well as in 2019 (regarding the
situation in Venezuela).26 [It was not a given]{.underline} either [that
the US-Saudi defense relationship would have survived 9/11
and]{.underline} Jamal [**Khashoggi**'s murder, or that the US-Turkey
alliance would survive the acquisition]{.underline} by Ankara
[of]{.underline} modern [Russian air defense systems. Nor was it a
given]{.underline}, more generally, [that]{.underline} US [alliances
would survive the **Obama and Trump eras**, when attention given to most
allies was **less important** than]{.underline} it had been [in the
past]{.underline}. During the presidency of Donald Trump, the number of
US troops in Europe increased and NATO welcomed two new members
(Montenegro and North Macedonia). In fact, two scholars suggest that
when seen [in a historical perspective, US-based alliances]{.underline}
tend to [last **twice as long as non-US-based ones**]{.underline}, and
that [the main treaty-based American alliances forged after 1945 **are
historical outliers in terms of their duration**]{.underline}.27

### No Internal Link---Reassurances Solve

#### No East Asian prolif\-\--U.S. can reassure.

DG

As discussed above, [the US has a **successful track record** of
preventing **prolif**eration in East Asia, **even in the context of
concerns about US reliability**]{.underline} and perceptions of American
decline. Both [for geopolitical reasons]{.underline}---[to balance
against China's]{.underline} rising [power]{.underline}---[and
nonproliferation reasons, the US has a **strong incentive** to reassure
South Korea and Japan and strengthen the American commitment.
While]{.underline} a potential return of [Trump]{.underline} to the
presidency [could call this into question, a strong **bipartisan
consensus** has developed]{.underline} on the importance of competing
with China,107 [which is likely to translate into]{.underline}
bipartisan [support for]{.underline} maintaining and/or strengthening
[ties with Japan especially, but also South Korea]{.underline}. The
Biden administration recently made substantial efforts in this regard,
responding to comments by the South Korean president about a potential
nuclear program by strengthening the alliance. The so-called "Washington
Declaration" provides for enhanced consultation on matters of nuclear
deterrence, closer operational planning at the conventional level, and
visits to South Korea by nuclear-armed US submarines. As part of the
declaration, South Korea reaffirmed its intention to abide by its NPT
commitment to remain non-nuclear.108 The Biden administration likewise
strengthened its commitment to Japan, endorsing Tokyo's decision to
substantially expand its military capabilities.109 The US, South Korea,
and Japan also agreed to expand cooperation on missile defense.110

[Even if Japanese or South Korean leaders are not fully
satisfied]{.underline} with US efforts at reassurance, [the
alternative]{.underline}---[an independent nuclear weapons
program]{.underline}---[is]{.underline} likely to be perceived as [**too
costly or risky**. Pursuing nuclear weapons would expose either country
to **nuclear trade sanctions**, seriously damaging]{.underline} their
substantial [nuclear energy]{.underline} programs, [could **cause the US
to downgrade or terminate alliance arrangements**, and would likely lead
to **substantial Chinese sanctions**]{.underline}.111

[While some have argued the US would]{.underline} (or should) [look the
other way]{.underline} if South Korea or Japan go nuclear,112 consistent
with the argument above that intense geopolitical competition outweighs
nonproliferation concerns, [this is **unlikely**]{.underline} for
several reasons. First, [unlike prior cases]{.underline} like Britain
and France, [South Korea and Japan would be proliferating in the context
of a **robust nonproliferation regime** Washington has a strong
incentive to uphold]{.underline}. While the US could still choose to
prioritize great power competition, as it did with Pakistan in the
1980s, the implications here would be different since (unlike Pakistan)
South Korea and Japan are parties to the NPT. [Legitimizing]{.underline}
their [withdrawal]{.underline} from the treaty [could provide cover
for]{.underline} other countries, such as [Iran or Saudi Arabia, to do
the same]{.underline}.

Second, leaving aside the NPT[, a nuclear-armed Japan or South Korea
would be much more dangerous for the US]{.underline} than a nuclear
Pakistan because it could spark nuclear crises and arms races in a
region where the US is deeply involved. The US has always been unlikely
to become directly involved in an India-Pakistan war, but the same
cannot be said for a war involving South vs. North Korea or a war
involving China vs. Japan. [It is]{.underline}, therefore, very much [in
the US interest to ensure there are as few]{.underline} "[nuclear
buttons]{.underline}" [at play as possible in any conflict]{.underline}
scenario and to avoid potentially dangerous crises that could occur if
China or North Korea sought to prevent their rivals from acquiring
nuclear weapons.

Third, while India and Pakistan's acquisition of nuclear weapons did do
damage to the nonproliferation regime, it did not fundamentally call
into question the value of US security commitments since neither country
had a firm alliance with the US.113 By contrast, [if South Korea or
Japan went nuclear, it could send a message that US alliance guarantees
are not sufficient]{.underline} to ensure security[, a message American
officials would be loath to send]{.underline}.

In short, [**the US is likely to have the will and capacity to do what
it takes to persuade Japan and South Korea to remain non-nuclear**, even
in the context of an increasingly tense security
environment]{.underline}.

### No Prolif---East Asia

#### No East Asian prolif\-\--popular opposition, international sanctions, security implications, veto players, and alliances prevent armament.

and Inevitable?" Asia-Pacific Leadership Network,
https://apln.network/projects/wmd-project/is-nuclear-domino-in-northeast-asia-real-and-inevitable

However, [the nuc]{.underline}lear [domino]{.underline} **[is not likely
to materialize]{.underline}** anytime soon [in]{.underline} Northeast
[Asia]{.underline}. This is because, both the [Japanese and South Korean
governments are]{.underline} fully **[committed to their
non-nuc]{.underline}**lear **[stance]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
have **[resisted]{.underline}** [being drawn into]{.underline} loose
**[talk of]{.underline}** nuclear weapons
**[prolif]{.underline}**eration. [They]{.underline} have
[observed]{.underline} **[stringent monitoring]{.underline}** and
verification of their nuclear materials facilities and stocks of fissile
material. [They]{.underline} also [lend]{.underline} **[full confidence
in]{.underline}** American [e]{.underline}xtended nuclear
[d]{.underline}eterrence and, therefore, oppose the redeployment of
tactical nuclear weapons and the NATO-type nuclear sharing.

While both countries have the necessary missile delivery technology
available, neither is likely be a breakout nuclear state. **[Fear of
international sanctions]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[negative
impacts]{.underline}** [on their economy]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
the **[civilian atomic industry]{.underline}**, [a]{.underline}
potential **[rupture in their alliance]{.underline}** relationship [with
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, **[and a dangerous nuclear
arms race]{.underline}** on the Korean peninsula [are]{.underline}
likely to be **[an effective deterrent]{.underline}** against the
nuclear move.

**[Japan's peace constitution]{.underline}**, three **[non-nuclear
principles]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} Japan's **[excessive
reliance on American security]{.underline}** protection
[are]{.underline} also **[likely to prevent Japan's]{.underline}** move
toward nuclear **[armament]{.underline}**. In contrast to ROK, public
opinion in Japan is opposed to nuclear armament and [the]{.underline}
nuclear [taboo]{.underline} is **[deeply rooted in Japanese
society]{.underline}**. [Civil society groups]{.underline} in the ROK
and Japan are [form]{.underline}ing **[countervailing coalitions opposed

Assurance in Changing Conditions,\" in Options for Strengthening ROK
Nuclear Assurance, Chapter 6, 10/25/2023, pg. 115-116.

The third option is for [the ROK to]{.underline}
**[produce]{.underline}** [its own nuclear weapons]{.underline}, which
[is the]{.underline} apparent [preference of the ROK people, consistent
with]{.underline} the findings of ROK **[public opinion]{.underline}**
[polls]{.underline} (see, for example, Kim, Kang, and Ham, 2022). This
option would provide recognition that the ROK is a major power,
"increasing South Korea's prestige in the international community"
(Dalton, Friedhoff, and Kim, 2022, p. 2).9 \*\*\*FOOTNOTE BEGINS\*\*\*
This [poll reports]{.underline} that [the]{.underline} **[main
reasons]{.underline}** [respondents gave regarding a ROK nuclear weapon
program are]{.underline} (1) [defending]{.underline} the ROK [from
threats]{.underline} **[other than No]{.underline}**rth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea ([39 percent]{.underline}), (2)
[increasing]{.underline} ROK **[international prestige]{.underline}**
([26 percent]{.underline}), (3) [countering]{.underline} the
**[No]{.underline}**rth **[Ko]{.underline}**rean threat ([23
percent]{.underline}), [and]{.underline} (4) [fearing]{.underline} that
[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[will]{.underline} **[not defend]{.underline}** [the ROK if it is
attacked]{.underline} ([10 perce]{.underline}nt). But this
[poll]{.underline} was done before the extensive North Korean
provocations and belligerent rhetoric in 2022 and thus likely
**[underrepresents]{.underline}** [current concerns about
the]{.underline} **[No]{.underline}**rth **[Ko]{.underline}**rean
[threat]{.underline} (Dalton, Friedhoff, and Kim, 2022). \*\*\*FOOTNOTE
ENDS\*\*\* The ROK might especially expect such recognition if it builds
hundreds of nuclear weapons to maintain parity with the number of North
Korean nuclear weapons projected in this report. The option would also
give the ROK discretion in its use of nuclear weapons against North
Korea and allow the ROK to pose threats against the North that are
stronger than those threats that United States has been willing to pose
and therefore could increase both deterrence of North Korean nuclear
weapon use and ROK nuclear assurance.

However, it seems likely that many ROK government leaders and the ROK
public have not appreciated how serious the potential risks and
downsides are of this option (Brewer and Dalton, 2023).10 First, North
Korea would strongly object and likely cause serious crises, including
committing major provocations, trying to prevent having nuclear weapons
in the ROK. Second, **[ROK progressives]{.underline}**
[would]{.underline} likely **[object]{.underline}**, [as
would]{.underline} ROK **[citizens]{.underline}** [living near whichever
military bases would be chosen for nuclear weapon storage,
knowing]{.underline} that their [communities would become]{.underline}
**[high-priority]{.underline}** nuclear weapon **[targets]{.underline}**
for North Korea. The [citizens]{.underline} against having nuclear
weapons in the ROK [would]{.underline} likely [pursue]{.underline}
**[demonstrations]{.underline}** [against the nuclear
weapons]{.underline} as against THAAD, although [they would]{.underline}
likely [make those demonstrations]{.underline} far more
**[serious]{.underline}** [and of]{.underline} **[great]{.underline}**er
**[magnitude]{.underline}**. A future ROK president could simply cancel
the ROK nuclear weapon program. Third, [the]{.underline}
**[cost]{.underline}** [of the ROK producing its own nuclear weapons
would be]{.underline} **[very high]{.underline}**.
[Production]{.underline} would [take]{.underline} **[considerable
time]{.underline}** [especially because the ROK lacks]{.underline}
**[uranium enrichment]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[plutonium
reprocessing]{.underline}** [capabilities]{.underline}. Fourth, to
produce its own nuclear weapons, [the ROK would need to]{.underline}
**[leave]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} **[N]{.underline}**uclear
Non-**[P]{.underline}**roliferation **[T]{.underline}**reaty. If it does
so, [the]{.underline} **[N]{.underline}**uclear
**[S]{.underline}**uppliers **[G]{.underline}**roup might [refuse to
provide the uranium needed for either ROK nuclear power plants or ROK
nuclear weapons]{.underline}, potentially reducing or significantly
**[eliminating]{.underline}** perhaps 25 to **[30 percent]{.underline}**
[of ROK electrical power]{.underline}.11 Fifth, [the ROK]{.underline}
could also [suffer]{.underline} **[international economic
sanctions]{.underline}** [that could be]{.underline} particularly
**[devastating]{.underline}** [because of the ROK economy's emphasis on
exports]{.underline}. Sixth, **[China]{.underline}** would find it
highly problematic that the ROK would create hundreds of nuclear weapons
and [might put]{.underline} **[substantial]{.underline}** [economic
pressure on the ROK]{.underline} to not do so, including financial
sanctions potentially much greater than those used against the THAAD
deployment. And seventh, [the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [could]{.underline} decide to
**[withdraw]{.underline}** [from the ROK-U.S. military
alliance]{.underline}. None of these potential outcomes is inevitable,
but they are all quite possible. In trying to defend against the growing
North Korean nuclear weapon threat, it is possible that [the ROK could
do]{.underline} **[serious damage]{.underline}** [to its security,
economy, and reputation by pursuing this option]{.underline}.

### No Prolif---Framing---SoKo

Review, Vol. 5, pg. 11-12, 11/28/2023, Springer.

The nuclear taboo worked in the past, thanks to international safeguard
regulations that strictly prohibit reprocessing of spent fuels and
enrichment of weapons-grade uranium. Seoul has faithfully complied with
them. But on April 28, 2023, President **[Yoon]{.underline}** [made
another statement]{.underline} at the Harvard Kennedy School [that "If
committed]{.underline}, **[So]{.underline}**uth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea
[has technological infrastructure for nuclear armament in]{.underline}
**[less than one year]{.underline}**." His remarks sparked domestic
debates on South Korea's technological capabilities to produce weapons
(Lim 2023). Yoon's [position reflected the view of]{.underline} Seo
**[Kyun-ryul]{.underline}**, a professor emeritus of nuclear engineering
at the Seoul National University [who has been arguing]{.underline} that
[South Korea has]{.underline} **[technical]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[financial]{.underline}** [capabilities to produce
**nuc**lear weapon**s** in 1 year]{.underline}. He asserted that South
Korea has already acquired technology for production of fissile
materials through uranium enrichment and separation of plutonium, while
achieving cutting-edge technology for high explosives, detonation, and
guidance system. For him, "nuclear weapons development in South Korea is
not a matter of technology and economy. If the state makes the decision,
and politicians provide a political shield, mass production of nuclear
weapons will not be difficult" (SPN Editorial 2017).

Seo's projection is not groundless. In 2016, Charles Ferguson,
then-president of the Federation of American Scientists, estimated that
South Korea has up to 4,330 bombs' worth of plutonium at the Wolsong
nuclear reactor site, assuming a conservative estimate of about 6 kg of
plutonium for a first-generation fission device (Ferguson 2016, 70).2
Hecker, a renowned nuclear scientist and former head of the Los Alamos
Laboratory, also concurs that South Korea can produce nuclear bombs in a
relatively short period. [But]{.underline} nuclear [weaponization
requires a full set of]{.underline} **[nuclear
facilities]{.underline}**, **[weapons-grade fissile
materials]{.underline}**, verification through **[nuclear
testing]{.underline}**, [and a full range of]{.underline} **[delivery
vehicles]{.underline}**. [The process to]{.underline}
**[develop]{.underline}** [these is]{.underline}
**[costly]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[time-consuming]{.underline}**. He also [questions which]{.underline}
**[provinces]{.underline}** [would allow]{.underline}
**[underground]{.underline}** [nuclear testing sites]{.underline}
(Hecker 2021). Moreover, [there are]{.underline} **[several
barriers]{.underline}**. [South Korea has]{.underline}
**[not]{.underline}** [fully acquired technology for]{.underline}
**[reprocessing]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[uranium
enrichment]{.underline}**. [Research on nuclear]{.underline}
**[detonation]{.underline}** [devices and the production of]{.underline}
**[nuclear warheads]{.underline}** [has been suspended for]{.underline}
**[more than 40 years]{.underline}**. [Despite]{.underline} having [a
rich human resource pool related to the]{.underline}
**[peaceful]{.underline}** [use of nuclear energy, South Korea
lacks]{.underline} **[qualified researchers]{.underline}** [in the field
of nuclear]{.underline} **[weapons]{.underline}** [development after
the]{.underline} Agency for Defense Development (**[ADD]{.underline}**)
[disbanded]{.underline} its nuclear weapons research unit [in the late
1970s]{.underline}. Thus, [developing nuclear weapons will
be]{.underline} quite [a]{.underline} **[daunting]{.underline}**
[challenge]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} **[prudent]{.underline}**
[assessment notwithstanding, conservative politicians and pundits
are]{.underline} **[jumping]{.underline}** [on]{.underline} this
**[nuclear optimism]{.underline}** and pushing for the independent
nuclear path. Some pundits have even urged the South Korean government
to embark on the second Manhattan project for nuclear weapons
development (Kim 2023a, b, c, d).

The fourth thread relevant to [proliferation strategy in]{.underline}
**[So]{.underline}**uth **[Ko]{.underline}**rean nuclear weapons
**[discourse]{.underline}** [centers on achieving an]{.underline}
**[arsenal]{.underline}** [that would yield the]{.underline} **[desired
strategic objectives]{.underline}** [vis-à-vis]{.underline}
**[No]{.underline}**rth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea. Nuclear weapons
[advocates recognize that]{.underline} **[So]{.underline}**uth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea [would]{.underline} **[need more than a single
weapon]{.underline}**, which according to Korea Advanced Institute of
Science & Technology (KAIST) professor Yim Man-sung could take somewhere
between six months to two years to develop.31 [Rather, Seoul would need
to establish the infrastructure to create an]{.underline}
**[arsenal]{.underline}** [of sufficient size and capability to
meet]{.underline} **[posited]{.underline}** [deterrence
objectives]{.underline}. This issue is not usually stated clearly, but
[it is implied in some ideas about needing to]{.underline} match or
**[exceed No]{.underline}**rth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea**['s]{.underline}** nuclear
[arsenal]{.underline}. Estimates vary, but North Korea is generally
believed to possess enough nuclear material for 40 to 60 nuclear
weapons.32

Considerations on building an arsenal are driven by an emerging belief
that South Korea can easily catch up to and surpass North Korean nuclear
capabilities. That is, Seoul is better postured---due to economic
resources, its advanced technological industries, and its partnerships
with the United States and other international powers---to "win" an
ensuing arms race with North Korea.33 Although it is unclear whether he
was thinking in terms of a single weapon or a nuclear arsenal, this
confidence is reflected in President Yoon's comments in January 2023,
when he stated that the country's "advanced science and technology"
would allow it to build nuclear weapons"sooner rather than later,"if
needed. There even appears to be some appetite for arms racing as a way
to force Pyongyang to capitulate and agree to arms reductions. The
Sejong Institute's Cheong Seong-Chang, for example, argues that
"Pyongyang cannot unreasonably \[sic\] continue its nuclear arms race
with Seoul, which possesses more than 4,000 nuclear bombs' worth of
fissile material. In the end, when the DPRK realizes its limitations,
interKorean military dialogue can begin, aiming at the suspension of the
nuclear arms race and reduction of nuclear weapons." 34 Other experts
have gone even higher in their size estimates of a potential arsenal.35
It seems doubtful that South Korean officials would decide to produce
thousands of nuclear weapons, but the idea of a sufficient capacity for
a large arsenal is clearly important.

Interestingly, ROK nuclear advocates focus on the country's substantial
stockpile of plutonium-bearing spent nuclear power reactor fuel, which
if reprocessed could serve as the basis for this arsenal capacity. All
of this plutonium is reactor grade, with the spent fuel having been used
in nuclear power reactors optimized for electricity generation.
Technically, it is possible to manufacture nuclear weapons from
reactor-grade plutonium. However, [as]{.underline} plutonium metallurgy
expert and former director of Los Alamos National Laboratory Sigfried
**[Hecker]{.underline}** [points out, there is an]{.underline}
**[important difference]{.underline}** [between demonstrating
the]{.underline} **[technical feasibility of a single
weapon]{.underline}** [and building an]{.underline} **[entire
arsenal]{.underline}** [with reactor-grade plutonium]{.underline}.36
[Every other state with nuclear weapons has built
facilities]{.underline} **[specifically]{.underline}** [for the purpose
of churning out]{.underline} **[weapons-grade plutonium]{.underline}**,
which is [irradiated for]{.underline} much **[shorter]{.underline}**
[periods to minimize the]{.underline} **[concentration]{.underline}**
[of isotopes that]{.underline} **[complicate
weaponization]{.underline}**. In other words, even [though arsenal
capacity seems to be an]{.underline} **[important consideration in
So]{.underline}**uth **[Ko]{.underline}**rean **[nuclear
discourse]{.underline}**, [it is not yet backed by a]{.underline}
**[clear]{.underline}**ly articulated [technical strategy]{.underline},
at least publicly.

The [idea of **South Korea**]{.underline} developing [**nuc**lear
weapon**s** is reaching critical mass]{.underline}, if you'll excuse the
pun. Surveys show as much as 70 percent of the public now in favor.
There has also been plenty of commentary on why it's necessary: North
Korea's growing arsenal, China's rise, and the United States' perceived
increasing unreliability. The feedback buzz between public opinion and
commentary has grown so much that the issue became a presidential
campaign topic.

However, [just because something is popular and there are good reasons
for it doesn't mean politicians will **deliver** it]{.underline}. [Both
sides of politics have their **reservations**]{.underline}. The left
sees it as [harmful to relations with Pyongyang]{.underline} and [at
odds with the goal of **denuclearising** the north]{.underline}, while
those on the right [fear alliance **pushback**]{.underline}, [damage to
**exports**]{.underline}, and [weakening of **relations** with
China]{.underline}.

But the more [**fundamental obstacle** is that]{.underline} going
nuclear would require consistent unity of national purpose: [an
executive must **decide** to do it]{.underline}, a [legislature must
**pay** for it]{.underline}, [and the apparatus of government must
**facilitate** it]{.underline}. These efforts [must then be
**sustained** long enough to make it happen]{.underline}. But [**unity**
is a typically **scarce commodity** in South Korean politics, and is
certainly nowhere to be seen now]{.underline}. Politics has been nothing
if not [turbulent over the past 10 years]{.underline}.

The country remains relatively functional and maintains bipartisan focus
on certain policy approaches. Still, embarking on something new and
ambitious, such as a nuclear weapons program, is different to merely
keeping on. It requires a novel and sustained confluence of ideological
currents.

In South Korea, North Korea is an ideological fulcrum. The extreme right
wants to liberate the north at the risk of war, while the furthest left
wants the north's regime to reign over the entire peninsula. Politics
happens in the middle. The left wants to accommodate the north's
preferences on the way to cooperative unification, while the right
insists that the north must accommodate the preferences of the
south---including denuclearisation---if cooperation is to proceed.

The [left now holds both the **legislature** and the
**presidency**]{.underline}. Security plays a crucial role in outreach
to the north, as it provides the South Korean public with the confidence
needed to pursue cooperative peace, or even unification. But those on
the left [believe that security can come from the US **alliance** and
from South Korea's considerable **conventional
capabilities**]{.underline}. In their view, [nuclear weapons are not
only unnecessary; they would disrupt **engagement** with Pyongyang and
derail **the agenda internationally**]{.underline}.

The [right]{.underline} doesn't get to decide matters of state anymore.
But even if missteps by the left gave it that power in the future, it
would [balk at nuclearisation]{.underline}. For the right, the [US
alliance is central to **protecting** the south from the
north]{.underline}. And while some parts of the Trump administration may
be open to the idea of South Korea going nuclear, an effort in that
direction would face considerable alliance headwinds. Also, the [fear of
**damage** to South Korean exports and relations with China means it's
not a **serious option**]{.underline}. To this side, trying to convince
the US to do something, such as nuclear sharing, is a better option.

#### Lack of [technical capacity]{.underline}.

No one doubts that South Korea has the technical capability and
financial resources to produce nuclear weapons. But if it decided to go
nuclear, **[So]{.underline}**uth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea [would want
a]{.underline} **[sizable]{.underline}**,
**[sophisticated]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[publicly
demonstrated]{.underline}** [nuclear capability, not a]{.underline}
**[few primitive, untested bombs]{.underline}** [in the
basement]{.underline}. [That would be a]{.underline} major,
**[costly]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[time-consuming]{.underline}** [undertaking]{.underline}.
**[So]{.underline}**uth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea has a large and
worldclass civil nuclear energy program, but it [doesn't have
the]{.underline} **[specialized facilities]{.underline}** [in place to
produce a substantial nuclear arsenal]{.underline}. [It has]{.underline}
**[no uranium enrichment facilities]{.underline}** [or]{.underline}
**[readily accessible]{.underline}** [sources of uranium]{.underline}.
[It has done]{.underline} plenty of [research on ways to]{.underline}
**[separate]{.underline}** [plutonium from spent fuel but only on
a]{.underline} **[laboratory]{.underline}** [scale and would need to
build a much larger facility]{.underline}. It would [have]{.underline}
**[difficulty]{.underline}** [acquiring uranium that it
could]{.underline} **[irradiate]{.underline}** [to produce plutonium or
identifying spent reactor fuel]{.underline} **[already]{.underline}** in
South Korea [that could be reprocessed without]{.underline} **[violating
contractual obligations]{.underline}** [with suppliers or]{.underline}
that would [provide the]{.underline} **[optimal]{.underline}** [grade of
plutonium for weapons]{.underline}. It would [have to develop
a]{.underline} **[workable]{.underline}** [bomb design and test
it]{.underline}, presumably **[more]{.underline}** [than
once]{.underline}. [Finding a]{.underline} **[technically]{.underline}**
suitable [and]{.underline} **[politically]{.underline}** [acceptable
test site in]{.underline} **[densely populated So]{.underline}**uth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea [could be an insurmountable
challenge]{.underline}. [Achieving]{.underline} a secure retaliatory
[capability]{.underline} with survivable basing arrangements [could
take]{.underline} **[several years]{.underline}**, and it would divert
resources from other defense and national priorities.

#### Korea has [neither]{.underline} the tech NOR bureaucracy.

Finally, [there are]{.underline} some **[apparent]{.underline}** [gaps
relating to]{.underline} **[key technical aspects]{.underline}** [of
nuclear acquisition, specifically about]{.underline}
**[weaponization]{.underline}** [and how to]{.underline}
**[integrate]{.underline}** [a nuclear arsenal into a]{.underline}
**[c]{.underline}**ommand-a**[n]{.underline}**d-**[c]{.underline}**ontrol
[structure]{.underline}. [Weaponization]{.underline}---that is, the
design, testing and engineering of an explosive device into a warhead
that can be mounted to a delivery system---[requires a]{.underline}
**[tightly orchestrated campaign]{.underline}** [to bring together
disparate technical disciplines]{.underline}, as was done in the US
Manhattan Project. As one of the very few South Korean articles to
broach this issue concluded, "experts believe that nuclear weapons can
be made in one and a half to two years if the acquisition of raw
\[fissile\] materials (six months), detonator development (six to nine
months), and nuclear explosion tests (three to six months) are
combined." 51 Though the basis for this timeline is unclear, South Korea
does possess robust conventional munitions, machining and computing
industries, and there is evidence to suggest familiarity with other
necessary technologies such as neutron generation. South Korea also has
substantial experience in building conventional warheads for ballistic
and cruise missiles. Nevertheless, [constructing a]{.underline}
**[plutonium-fueled]{.underline}** implosion [weapon remains
a]{.underline} **[complex]{.underline}** [engineering challenge,
requiring]{.underline} **[extensive]{.underline}** [testing and
validation]{.underline}, **[only after]{.underline}** [which would
Korea]{.underline} **[shift]{.underline}** [to initial production
and]{.underline} ultimately [serial fabrication]{.underline}.

Once a state acquires [nuclear weapons]{.underline}, it then
**[inducts]{.underline}** them [into military operations as a means
of]{.underline} **[enhancing]{.underline}** the [credibility of nuclear
threats]{.underline}. This has [meant standing up]{.underline}
**[separate]{.underline}** [bureaucratic and personnel
structures]{.underline} within the military---e.g., a strategic
command---[to handle nuclear weapons, writing a nuclear doctrine, and
developing]{.underline} a [communications infrastructure]{.underline},
among other steps. Some of these capabilities appear to already exist
for non-nuclear capabilities in South Korea, for instance in the South
Korean Army Missile Command which operates conventional strike
platforms. In April 2022, the Korean government announced that this
command would be renamed the Missile Strategic Command, focused on
"strategic and operational target-strike missions." 52 Later, in July
2022, the Korean Ministry of National Defense announced that it would
stand up a new strategic command under the direction of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff that would integrate the service commands and bolster command
and control for missions involving preemptive conventional strike and
massive retaliation capabilities.53 [While]{.underline}
**[So]{.underline}**uth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea [appears to be building
a]{.underline} stronger **[bureaucratic foundation]{.underline}** [that
could cover some]{.underline} of the [requirements]{.underline} for
operationalizing a nuclear weapons program, [there is]{.underline} **[no
evidence]{.underline}** [it has been done with]{.underline}
**[this]{.underline}** [in mind]{.underline}.

### No Prolif---Sanctions---SoKo 

#### Sanctions are [inevitable]{.underline}, [multi-faceted]{.underline}, and [devastating]{.underline}.

Some experts [claim]{.underline} that [economic impacts emanating
from]{.underline} **[So]{.underline}**uth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea [going
nuclear will be]{.underline} **[manageable]{.underline}** for two
reasons (Cheong 2023a). One is that the USA and like-minded countries
such as the UK and France, will help mitigate tough UN sanctions against
South Korea. The other is that Israel, India, and Pakistan have survived
even after they have acquired nuclear weapons. [This is]{.underline}
**[wishful thinking]{.underline}**. At [the]{.underline}
**[initial]{.underline}** [phase of]{.underline}
**[secret]{.underline}** [nuclear weapons development]{.underline},
South Korean [allies and friends]{.underline} **[might]{.underline}**
[show tolerant attitudes]{.underline}, while [trying to]{.underline}
**[dissuade]{.underline}** [South Korea]{.underline}. [As Seoul
moves]{.underline} **[deeply into]{.underline}** [nuclear weapons
development]{.underline}, however, [they will find it]{.underline}
**[difficult to veto]{.underline}** [sanctions resolutions]{.underline},
even [though they are proposed by]{.underline} **[China]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[Russia]{.underline}**, [because of the]{.underline}
**[mandate]{.underline}** [to sustain the existing NPT
regime]{.underline}. Initial [sanctions will be imposed on technology
related to]{.underline} **[nuclear]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[ballistic missile]{.underline}** [development]{.underline}. But
[if]{.underline} **[So]{.underline}**uth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea
[undertakes nuclear testing and ballistic missile test
launches]{.underline}, **[heavier sanctions]{.underline}** [will be
imposed on energy, manufactured goods, and the banking and financial
sector]{.underline}. South Korea [will be hard hit]{.underline} **[far
beyond]{.underline}** [the magnitude comparable with]{.underline}
**[Israel]{.underline}**, **[India]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}
**[Pakistan]{.underline}**. At the time of nuclear weapons development,
[these countries pursued an import substitution industrialization,
and]{.underline} their [economies were relatively]{.underline}
**[insulated]{.underline}** [from external shocks]{.underline}. But
[today's **So**uth **Ko**rea is an]{.underline} **[entirely
different]{.underline}** [story]{.underline}. [Its]{.underline}
**[economic success]{.underline}** [came from an]{.underline}
**[export-led]{.underline}** growth **[strategy]{.underline}**, [and its
dependence on the external sector is huge]{.underline}. As of 2022, [the
ratio of imports and exports to GDP was]{.underline}
**[102%]{.underline}**, [and it]{.underline} **[imported]{.underline}**
[oil and gas]{.underline} **[100%]{.underline}** [from
abroad]{.underline}. Thus, UN [sanctions can]{.underline} **[deal a
catastrophic blow]{.underline}** [to the South Korean
economy]{.underline}.

South Korea will also be subject to various individual sanctions.
[The]{.underline} **[US]{.underline}**A can [invoke the]{.underline}
**[Glenn Amendment]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[other]{.underline}** [executive order and legislative measures
to]{.underline} **[block]{.underline}** [Seoul's nuclear
venture]{.underline}. **[US]{.underline}** [unilateral banking and
financial sanction measures]{.underline}, if taken, [will]{.underline}
**[\[freeze\]]{.underline}** ~~paralyze~~ [the South Korean economy
by]{.underline} **[banning]{.underline}** [foreign]{.underline} banking
and financial [transactions and discouraging direct investments from
abroad]{.underline}. And it is very likely that **[Japan]{.underline}**
[and the]{.underline} **[E]{.underline}**uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion
[will follow America's lead]{.underline}. **[China]{.underline}** [is
most likely to undertake]{.underline} **[tougher]{.underline}**
unilateral [sanction measures]{.underline} against South Korea. China
[accounts for]{.underline} **[20%]{.underline}** [of South Korea's total
trade, and]{.underline} its sanctions [could]{.underline}
**[devastate]{.underline}** [its economy, as demonstrated by the
experience of]{.underline} **[THAAD deployment]{.underline}** and
related China sanctions [in]{.underline} **[2016--2017]{.underline}**. A
study shows that the tourist sector alone lost \$19.2 billion for
34 months from July 2016 to April 2019 when China imposed a ban on group
tours to South Korea. If other sectors are included, damages could be
substantial (Cho 2020). [South Korea's]{.underline} window of
**[vulnerability]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} **[wide open to
sanctions]{.underline}**, [and the economic costs of an independent
nuclear path will be]{.underline} **[astronomical]{.underline}**.

After giving up its nuclear weapons development project in the 1970s,
South Korea emerged as one of the most successful countries in the
peaceful use of atomic energy. The [civilian nuclear industry accounts
for]{.underline} **[30% of domestic energy]{.underline}** needs [and its
share is projected to]{.underline} **[increase]{.underline}** [under the
Yoon government]{.underline}. **[Exports]{.underline}** [of nuclear
reactors have]{.underline} also [been impressive]{.underline}. But
[clandestine nuclear weapons development]{.underline}, if disclosed,
[will not only]{.underline} **[\[destroy\]]{.underline}** ~~cripple~~
[it, but]{.underline} also [bring about a]{.underline} **[crushing
blow]{.underline}** [to exports of nuclear reactors]{.underline}. From
the beginning, [South Korea's civilian nuclear energy industry has
been]{.underline} **[heavily dependent]{.underline}** [on]{.underline}
US Article 123 of [the]{.underline} US **[A]{.underline}**tomic
**[E]{.underline}**nergy **[A]{.underline}**ct of 1954,
[which]{.underline} **[prohibits]{.underline}** [South Korea from using
any nuclear materials, equipment, or technology received from
the]{.underline} **[US]{.underline}**A [in]{.underline}
**[military]{.underline}** [applications, including]{.underline} the
development of [nuclear weapons]{.underline}. [If Seoul]{.underline}
**[violates]{.underline}** [those rules or the]{.underline}
**[IAEA]{.underline}**'s **[safeguard clause]{.underline}**, [it will
have to]{.underline} **[immediately return]{.underline}** [all those
materials and equipment]{.underline} to the USA. [The]{.underline}
Nuclear Suppliers Group (**[NSG]{.underline}**) [will stop supplying the
requisite raw materials]{.underline} to South Korea, [and enrichment
services by foreign countries will]{.underline} also [be]{.underline}
**[terminated]{.underline}** (Moon 2023). [This]{.underline} can [lead
to a]{.underline} **[shutdown of domestic reactors]{.underline}** [as
well as the suspension of]{.underline} even **[medical
services]{.underline}** [such as X-ray, CT, and MRI]{.underline}.

The [Yoon]{.underline} Seok-youl [government has been
working]{.underline} **[very hard]{.underline}** [to promote export of
nuclear reactors to]{.underline} **[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**,
**[Egypt]{.underline}**, **[Poland]{.underline}**, [and
other]{.underline} **[Eastern European]{.underline}**
[countries]{.underline}. [If South Korea shows]{.underline} any [signs
of]{.underline} secretly **[developing]{.underline}** [nuclear bombs,
there will be]{.underline} **[no buyers]{.underline}** (Hecker 2023a,
b). The USA can easily block the export of many South Korean nuclear
technologies and eventually reactors. Albeit contentious, [they are
based on]{.underline} **[US technologies]{.underline}** [licensed to
South Korea]{.underline}. And [the]{.underline} **[US]{.underline}**A
[has political power and influence to block South Korean sales of
nuclear reactors]{.underline}. [If South Korea]{.underline}
**[withdraws]{.underline}** [from the NPT and breaks the nuclear accord
with the]{.underline} **[US]{.underline}**A, [the]{.underline}
**[domestic]{.underline}** [nuclear industry and export business will
be]{.underline} **[ruined]{.underline}**. [The]{.underline}
**[i]{.underline}**nternational **[c]{.underline}**ommunity
[will]{.underline} **[not tolerate]{.underline}** [South Korea's deviant
behavior]{.underline} either, [and]{.underline} such [wishful thinking
that Seoul can fix the problem through diplomatic appeal, lobbying, and
even cheating]{.underline} will not work (Klingner 2023).

#### It wouldn't happen---sanctions

towards a South Korean nuclearization?",

accessed: 7.16.25\]

Is it really feasible for South Korea on its own?

In addition to the [lack of willingness of **Washington** to **assist**
South Korea in a possible nuclear **program**]{.underline}, [67% of
South Koreans]{.underline}, when asked in a recent poll, confessed to
[prefer]{.underline} an independent capability and [not so much to
**rely** on the United States if the time comes to develop their own
**nukes**]{.underline}.

In technological terms, it is important to state that South Korea has
what is known as 'nuclear latency' meaning it has the possession of
"some or all of the technologies, facilities, materials, expertise
(including tacit knowledge), resources, and other capabilities needed to
develop nuclear weapons"; a clear indicator of how it could develop
nuclear weapons if desired, or at least, a good first step towards that
objective. In fact, its own president announced that "we can have our
own nuclear weapons pretty quickly, given our scientific and
technological capabilities". Moreover, the country is one of the top
global producers of nuclear energy and has 25 nuclear power reactors.
[There are, however, some **flaws** in South Korea's **nuclear
infrastructure**, added to the fact that the country lacks **uranium**
and some of the requiring capacities to work with it]{.underline}.

Another important facet to consider is that [South Korea is a state
party to the **N**uclear Non-**p**roliferation **T**reaty]{.underline}
(1968) since 1975. Due to this fact, [if the government decided to
acquire nuclear weapons, the country would have to withdraw from the
treaty]{.underline}, thus [losing **international
prestige**]{.underline} and reputation, since [South Korea has always
been a **strong voice** advocating for nuclear
**disarmament**]{.underline}. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty bans
all countries except for the five recognized nuclear weapon states from
owning nuclear arms. In exchange, the countries possessing nuclear
weapons have to fulfill the obligation to aid non-nuclear states, such
as South Korea, in developing peaceful nuclear energy, as well as to
promote global nuclear disarmament.

This [treaty is refraining many other actors from becoming nuclear,
being of **utmost importance** when it comes to trust-building between
states and global security]{.underline}. If South Korea breaks or leaves
the treaty, it [may even be subject to harsh **sanctions** and
**repercussions**]{.underline}, despite it being a right to leave
(article 10) for "extraordinary events, related to the subject matter of
this treaty, have jeopardized the supreme interests of its country". A
three months\' notice must then be given to the UN General Assembly, for
it to decide whether the claim is legitimate and in accordance with the
right of withdrawal or not, and it is not very clear whether a possible
South Korean nuclear acquisition could fit in. As a matter of fact,
North Korea is the only country that has ever left said treaty, back in
2003.

#### [International]{.underline} AND [US]{.underline} sanctions.

South Korea would pay a high price for going nuclear. Even if one
assumes that a U.S. administration would swallow its disappointment over
Seoul's decision, opt for maintaining close ties with its strategically
important ally, and work to spare it from harsh punishment as much as
possible---and it's hard to predict whether a future administration
would react that way---the ROK would still pay a high price. If it so
desired, the United States would be able to block Security Council
sanctions, but [countries]{.underline} **[opposed]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} **[So]{.underline}**uth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea**['s
nuclearization]{.underline}**, [especially]{.underline}
**[China]{.underline}** [but]{.underline} perhaps [also]{.underline}
**[Russia]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[others]{.underline}**,
[could be expected to adopt]{.underline} their own unilateral
**[punitive measures]{.underline}**. The **[U.S.]{.underline}**
administration would be able to waive a number of U.S. sanctions laws
that would be triggered by South Korea's actions, but under some laws,
**[sanctions]{.underline}** [would be imposed]{.underline}
**[automatically]{.underline}** and could be waived only by a vote of
Congress and not by the president. That would [include the]{.underline}
**[Glenn amendment]{.underline}**, [which would be
triggered]{.underline} by a nuclear test [and mandate a cutoff of
a]{.underline} **[wide range]{.underline}** [of bilateral cooperation,
including arms sales and various forms of financial
assistance]{.underline}. (The far-reaching Glenn amendment sanctions
against India and Pakistan were imposed in May 1998, relaxed
incrementally, and finally removed only in September 2001.29) In
addition, **[So]{.underline}**uth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea**['s]{.underline}** [trading partners could
become]{.underline} **[wary]{.underline}** [of providing the ROK with
dual-use and other high technology items]{.underline} that they believed
could contribute to its nuclear and missile programs.

South Korea's **[civil]{.underline}** [nuclear energy program would
be]{.underline} **[especially hard hit]{.underline}**. [Under
the]{.underline} **[U.S.-ROK]{.underline}** civil nuclear
[agreement]{.underline}, **[bilateral]{.underline}** [nuclear
cooperation would have to cease]{.underline}; South Korea could not use
any nuclear reactors, equipment, or materials previously supplied by the
United States in its nuclear weapons program; and Washington would even
have the right--- albeit a hard one to enforce---to demand that such
reactors, equipment, and materials be returned to the United States.30
In addition, [members of the]{.underline} multilateral Nuclear Suppliers
Group (**[NSG]{.underline}**), including all the world's major nuclear
suppliers, [would be committed]{.underline} under their guidelines
[to]{.underline} **[halt all nuclear cooperation]{.underline}**
[with]{.underline} **[So]{.underline}**uth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea.31
South Korea's [civil nuclear power program]{.underline}, which
[relies]{.underline} **[entirely on foreign supplies]{.underline}** [of
enriched uranium]{.underline} to fuel its light water reactors and which
[produces]{.underline} about **[27%]{.underline}** [of the country's
electricity (with plans to reach]{.underline} nearly
**[35%]{.underline}** by 2036),32 [would come to a halt]{.underline}. So
would South Korea's hopes of becoming one of the world's leading
exporters of nuclear reactors.

Acquiring an indigenous nuclear weapons capability is not the answer to
South Korean security concerns. It would do little, if anything, to
enhance deterrence against North Korea and could even undermine ROK
security by increasing tensions and crisis instability on the Peninsula,
weakening the U.S.-ROK alliance, and antagonizing neighbors, especially
China. South Korea's nuclearization would attract widespread
international opprobrium and damage the global nuclear nonproliferation
regime, undermining its image as a responsible and increasingly
influential international player. [It would require a]{.underline}
**[major investment]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}
**[time]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[financial
resources]{.underline}**, [with]{.underline} **[significant opportunity
costs]{.underline}** [to other national priorities,
including]{.underline} strengthening **[conventional]{.underline}**
[defense and]{.underline} **[deterrence]{.underline}**
[capabilities]{.underline}. [And]{.underline} **[So]{.underline}**uth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea [could become the target of]{.underline}
**[economic sanctions]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[other
pressures]{.underline}**, [with]{.underline} especially [disruptive
effects]{.underline} on its civil nuclear program.

#### It [explicitly disproves]{.underline} causality.

For other demand-side factors, this analysis employs the new nuclear
defender variable by Bleek & Lorber (2014) to re-examine their empirical
findings. Interestingly, the results show that the presence of nuclear
defenders does not necessarily constrain protégés' nuclear development
at statistically significant levels. This result is counterintuitive to
the cases of Germany and Japan in the postwar period. However, as seen
with Taiwan (1967, 1987) and South Korea (1959, 1970), the security
guarantor's dilemma always exists between a nuclear defender and its
protégés. [For instance]{.underline}, **[So]{.underline}**uth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea**['s nuclear development]{.underline}** [efforts
are]{.underline} **[often]{.underline}** [explained in association with
the]{.underline} **[US]{.underline}**A**['s]{.underline}** [decreased
military presence]{.underline} in the Korean Peninsula.
**[Despite]{.underline}** the USA's [nuclear defense commitments, the
fear of abandonment]{.underline} often **[looms]{.underline}** [on the
horizon for protégés']{.underline}, which drives them to nuclear
options. As Monteiro & Debs (2014) show in their article on the
strategic interactions among a nuclear defender, its protégé´, and a
potential enemy over nuclear proliferation, [the]{.underline} **[causal
relationship]{.underline}** [between the presence of a]{.underline}
**[nuclear defender]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[protégés']{.underline}** [nuclear development is]{.underline} **[more
complex than straightforward]{.underline}**. [The]{.underline}
**[absence]{.underline}** [of significant associations
delineates]{.underline} the **[ambiguous effects]{.underline}** [brought
about]{.underline} by a nuclear defender.

\[Table omitted\]

This section proceeds to present results from the supply-side equation.
The bottom half of Table I consistently shows that the hypothesis of
nuclear demand causing nuclear technology (H2) is supported; nuclear
development tends to pay off despite inherent technological
difficulties. The results also imply that the more seriously a state
develops nuclear weapons (pursuit rather than exploration), the more
likely it is to achieve technological milestones.

The [output on]{.underline} other **[supply-side]{.underline}** [factors
is striking]{.underline}. Most importantly, [the]{.underline} **[effect

results from the simultaneous equation analysis suggest that nuclear
assistance variables might have been potentially overestimated in the
existing quantitative literature at the cost of states' nuclear demand.

To acquire its own nuclear weapons, **[So]{.underline}**uth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea [would have to]{.underline}
**[withdraw]{.underline}** [from the NPT]{.underline}. The 1968 treaty
bans members other than Britain, China, France, Russia, and the United
States from possessing nuclear arms. In exchange, the nuclear-haves
promise to assist the have-nots with nuclear energy capabilities and to
work toward disarmament. The treaty has played a major role preventing
proliferation for more than five decades.

What had been fringe discussions over whether South Korea should leave
the NPT or prioritize conventional contingency planning with the United
States have become mainstream discourse as the security environment
deteriorates. To date, North Korea is the only state to have withdrawn
from the NPT, although nuclear-armed India, Israel, and Pakistan never
joined. The treaty permits withdrawal in "extraordinary circumstances"
if states provide a three-month notice, giving South Korea a theoretical
exit strategy. But if every state with significant security concerns
withdrew, preventing additional proliferation would prove impossible.
Washington must emphasize that a precedent-setting NPT exit by Seoul is
unacceptable.

After all, Seoul and Washington have recommended punishing states that
withdraw by terminating all civilian nuclear cooperation. [NPT
withdrawers]{.underline} would then [have to]{.underline} **[return
materials and technology]{.underline}** [to their foreign
suppliers]{.underline}. If South Korea were held to its own standard[,
the results would prove]{.underline} **[disastrous]{.underline}**. [The
country]{.underline} **[relies on]{.underline}** [foreign nuclear fuel
and energy cooperation]{.underline} with the United States and other
partners. It [expects]{.underline} **[34.6 percent]{.underline}** [of
its electricity to come from nuclear power]{.underline} by 2036.
[Leaving the NPT would]{.underline} likely **[mark the
end]{.underline}** [of civilian nuclear
cooperation]{.underline}---grinding these plans to a halt, **[severely
harming]{.underline}** South Korea's [economy, and]{.underline}
**[costing]{.underline}** [the political leadership public
support]{.underline}.

South Korean [officials]{.underline} should also
**[remember]{.underline}** [the **i**nternational **c**ommunity punishes
states that]{.underline} **[abrogate]{.underline}** their [nuclear
responsibilities]{.underline}. The **[UN S]{.underline}**ecurity
**[C]{.underline}**ouncil [imposed an arms embargo, asset freezes, and
travel bans following]{.underline} **[No]{.underline}**rth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea**['s]{.underline}** first **[test]{.underline}**
in 2006, [and similar measures]{.underline} were briefly levied
[against]{.underline} **[India]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[Pakistan]{.underline}** following their 1998 nuclear tests. Even if
the United States shielded South Korea from UN sanctions, unilateral
measures from actors like China, Japan, Russia, or the European
Union---beyond a Nuclear Suppliers Group trade ban---would still bite.
Broader understanding of these consequences could help steer South Korea
away from the nuclear path.

South Korea would face global diplomatic and economic consequences which
would redound on its export-led economy. At a minimum, and separate from
any unilateral penalties imposed by China and the United States, South
Korean weaponization would be debated in the UN Security Council.
Washington could veto any UN censure or sanctions, but this would not
prevent other states from taking their own independent actions.
Washington would also have [limited means of sheltering]{.underline}

**[nuclear fuel cutoff]{.underline}** [by]{.underline} members of
[the]{.underline} Nuclear Suppliers Group (**[NSG]{.underline}**); [this

reactors of low-enriched uranium fuel]{.underline}, potentially
[resulting in the loss of]{.underline} some **[30 percent]{.underline}**

component]{.underline}** [of its]{.underline} broader [Indo-Pacific

reactors by 2030 and cooperating with other countries on new advanced
reactor designs.49 Seoul's strategy [requires]{.underline}
**[coordination]{.underline}** [with a number of]{.underline}
**[international partners]{.underline}**, including the United Arab
Emirates where South Korea is building its first exported reactors and
where President Yoon made a high-profile visit in January to further the
South Korean and Emirati nuclear partnership.50 [NSG requirements, a

[South Korea elected its first **post-war generation** president in
2022]{.underline} and this [trend is expected to
**continue**]{.underline}. [As the war generation's **influence**
declines, South Korea will be **less determined** to develop its own
nuclear weapons]{.underline}.

Undoubtedly, South Koreans' current support for nuclear armament goes
beyond just the war generation. But the [war generation are the ones who
provide **unwavering support** and their position on nuclear armament is
less affected by **external factors**.]{.underline} [Younger cohorts are
more likely to **strategically alter** their views]{.underline} about
nuclear weapons in response to the evolving security environment.
According to a recent Korea Institute for National Unification report,
[more than **half** of respondents **withdrew** their **support** for
nuclear development after learning about its **costs**]{.underline},
such as the possibility of economic sanctions on South Korea.

As the war generation declines, South Koreans' views on nuclear armament
will become increasingly contingent on the security environment. This
dependence will open up the possibility that [US and South Korean
**policy decisions** may be able to somewhat control the South Korean
public's desire for nuclear weapons]{.underline}.

### No Prolif---Lack of Resources---SoKo

"The call for nuclear weapons will be anything but short-lived because
'going nuclear' sounds sexy as a slogan," said Lee Byong-chul, who has
studied nuclear nonproliferation at the Institute for Far Eastern
Studies in Seoul. "But [there is a huge gulf between **high public
support** and a lack of technical capabilities and political intention
to build **nuc**lear weapon**s**]{.underline}."

South Korea has [neither **facilities** to produce **fuel** for nuclear
bombs nor the technical **know-how** to design **nuclear
weapons**]{.underline}. And while Mr. Yoon has been more antagonistic
toward the North than his recent predecessors and briefly warmed to the
idea of going nuclear, there is [**little political will** in the South
to pursue atomic weapons]{.underline}.

In light of these discussions, some project participants
[stressed]{.underline} that **[So]{.underline}**uth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea [was]{.underline} **[not
seriously]{.underline}** [considering developing **nuc**lear weapon**s**
as this would]{.underline} **[undermine]{.underline}** [the country's
commitment to]{.underline} **[peaceful uses]{.underline}** [of nuclear
power, including]{.underline} **[reactor exports]{.underline}** [and
its expanding]{.underline} **[domestic]{.underline}** [nuclear power
sector]{.underline}.48 Against this backdrop, one analyst suggested that
the South Korean public [tended to]{.underline}
**[underestimate]{.underline}** [the]{.underline}
**[political]{.underline}**, **[diplomatic]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} **[economic]{.underline}** [costs of developing and
possessing nuclear weapons]{.underline}. For example, [if]{.underline}
**[So]{.underline}**uth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea [were to]{.underline}
**[withdraw]{.underline}** [from the NPT, it could lose]{.underline}
almost [a]{.underline} **[third of its total electricity
production]{.underline}** [from nuclear power generation as
international cooperation]{.underline} with the country's nuclear energy
programme, including imports of enriched uranium fuel on which South
Korea's reactors depend, [would most likely be]{.underline}
**[suspended]{.underline}**.49 Additionally, a [withdrawal]{.underline}
from the NPT [would lead to the]{.underline}
**[perception]{.underline}** [that]{.underline} **[So]{.underline}**uth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea [is in]{.underline} **[violation]{.underline}**
[of its safeguards agreement with the]{.underline}
**[IAEA]{.underline}**, [which would make it]{.underline}
**[difficult]{.underline}** [for
the]{.underline} **[i]{.underline}**nternational
**[c]{.underline}**ommunity [to justify]{.underline} South Korean
[exports of nuclear technology due to proliferation
concerns]{.underline}. The [growing]{.underline} **[So]{.underline}**uth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rean [reactor export industry could]{.underline}
**[collapse]{.underline}** [as a result]{.underline}.
**[So]{.underline}**uth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea [is
a]{.underline} **[resource-poor, trade-dependent country]{.underline}**
[that can ill afford to lose such]{.underline}
**[important]{.underline}** [trade relationships]{.underline}.
Additionally, [the]{.underline} **[US-So]{.underline}**uth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea civil [nuclear agreement stipulates]{.underline}
that [Seoul]{.underline} **[cannot]{.underline}** [use US-supplied
nuclear materials and equipment for weapons purposes]{.underline}.
[If]{.underline} those [terms were breached, Washington
could]{.underline} **[request]{.underline}** the [return of these
materials]{.underline} and equipment.50 Finally, the risks and benefits
equation should also consider [the impact of]{.underline} **[nuclear
testing]{.underline}**, which [would]{.underline}
**[contravene]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} Comprehensive
Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (**[CTBT]{.underline}**) [and]{.underline} could
**[trigger]{.underline}** [public opposition]{.underline}.

Preparedness Dilemma: South Korea's 'Three-Axis System',\" Defense

South [Korea]{.underline} **[once]{.underline}** [pursued its own
nuclear armament]{.underline} in the 1970s in response to the US's
unilateral decision to withdraw its military forces from its territory,
but immediately stopped it as the US cancelled the decision (Lim 2019,
307). Spurred by this experience, 50--70% of South Koreans consistently
supported this option in the surveys from 2010 (Dalton, Friedhoff, and
Kim 2022, 5--6). When North Korea developed its first nuclear weapon in
2013, a few South Korean conservative party leaders publicly and
strongly demanded to pursue this option (Bandow 2016). This demand was
repeated whenever the North Korean nuclear threat exacerbated. Even the
current South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol himself mentioned the
necessity of reviewing this option in early 2023 (Choe 2023), when 76.6%
of South Koreans turned out to support this option (Jung 2023). A few US
scholars recommended this option, too (Bandow 2016, 2022; Lind and Press
2021).

**[So]{.underline}**uth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea, however, [does not seem
to have the]{.underline} **[opportunity or willingness]{.underline}**
[to pursue its nuclear armament option]{.underline}. [It is]{.underline}
**[very probable]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}
**[No]{.underline}**rth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea [to conduct
a]{.underline} **[preventive]{.underline}** [nuclear attack]{.underline}
if South Korea is to develop nuclear weapons. [No South Koreans can
be]{.underline} **[sure]{.underline}** that [their cost, including
the]{.underline} **[withdrawal]{.underline}** [of the US NED, will be
worth risking]{.underline}. Most of all, South Korea's [potential for
nuclear armament is]{.underline} **[very low]{.underline}**, as Stephan
Herzog (2020, 76) evaluated South Korea at 5.2 on a ten-point scale in
2019, Japan at 7.8, and India and Pakistan at 9.4 and 7.8 in 1998 (the
year when the two countries conducted successful nuclear explosion
tests). Actually, [the]{.underline} South Korean [government
has]{.underline} **[not pursued]{.underline}** [this option]{.underline}
**[despite]{.underline}** [continuous demands by its people
and]{.underline} a few [politicians]{.underline}.

In theory, nuclear civil defence is indispensable. In reality, however,
[it became]{.underline} **[difficult for democratic
countries]{.underline}** [of the post-Cold War era to]{.underline}
**[execute]{.underline}** [civil defence]{.underline}. The [**So**uth
**Ko**rean government even]{.underline} **[did not]{.underline}** [join
the]{.underline} **[nuclear]{.underline}** [civil defence drills
of]{.underline} Hawaii, [the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, [and]{.underline} Tokyo,
**[Japan]{.underline}**, in 2018 [when]{.underline}
**[No]{.underline}**rth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea [test-fired long-range
missiles]{.underline}. Although [the]{.underline} current
**[Yoon]{.underline}** [administration]{.underline} conducted the drill,
it [had to]{.underline} **[reduce the scope]{.underline}** [only to
government officials]{.underline} on 16 May 2023, [due to negative
public response, and its second]{.underline} drill for the general
public on 23 August [was]{.underline} almost **[neglected]{.underline}**
[by the people]{.underline} (Shin and Park 2023). The South Korean
government and military have to prepare for the worst-case scenarios
without active participation from the public.

#### Elites [in control]{.underline} reject prolif.

Sangyong **Son &** Jong H. **Park 23**, PhD, Associate Professor, School

Attitude Change: Evidence from South Korea,\" Journal of Conflict
Resolution, Vol. 67, Issue 6, pg. 1096-1097, 2023, SAGE. \[italics in
original\]

The [majority of]{.underline} previous [research on nuclear
proliferation]{.underline} has [focused on]{.underline} **[elite
motivations]{.underline}** [for acquiring or abstaining from nuclear
weapons, with]{.underline} **[little attention]{.underline}** [to
the]{.underline} **[importance]{.underline}** [of public
opinion]{.underline}.1 Recent studies, however, have increasingly
focused on the role of public opinion in shaping elite decisions on
nuclear security policy (Berger 2014; Cole 1997; Flynn and Rattinger
1985). In this shift to public opinion in nuclear proliferation
research, an increasing number of scholars are focusing on South Korea
for its potential contributions to both studying and deriving policy
implications for nuclear proliferation and nonproliferation (Ko 2019;
Sukin 2019; Son and Yim 2021).

The [foreign policy gap between]{.underline} **[elites]{.underline}**
[and the]{.underline} **[public]{.underline}** [over nuclear
proliferation]{.underline} **[in South Korea]{.underline}** [has been an
intriguing puzzle]{.underline} for both theorists and practitioners of
international security. [Public support]{.underline} for the acquisition
of nuclear weapons **[consistently]{.underline}** [ranged
between]{.underline} **[50 and 70%]{.underline}** in more than 20
opinion polls conducted in South Korea (Dalton and Han 2020, 5). South
Korean public support for proliferation serves as evidence of "what
people really want" to international audiences. For example, Lind and
Press (2021a, 2021b) recently argued that South Korea should be allowed
to develop its own nuclear weapons in order to protect itself from North
Korea's nuclear threat, claiming that "70% of the South Korean public
(already) supports the move" (Lind and Press, 2021b).2 By contrast, [a
survey of 50 South Korean national security experts shows]{.underline}
that **[64%]{.underline}** of them [are opposed to independent nuclear
weapons development, and only]{.underline} **[12%]{.underline}**
[supported]{.underline}.3

In this paper, we examine whether [experts']{.underline} **[credible
nonproliferation information]{.underline}** [about the]{.underline}
potential **[consequences]{.underline}** of [nuclear weapons
development]{.underline} (hereinafter referred to as "nonproliferation
information") [can]{.underline} **[change]{.underline}** pro-armament
[voters']{.underline} pre-existing [attitudes]{.underline} and reduce
the foreign policy gap in nuclear proliferation. More specifically, we
compare the relative effectiveness of different types of
nonproliferation information derived from existing nonproliferation
studies: economic sanctions, conditional military sanctions, nuclear
technology sanctions, normative sanctions, reduced security threats,
elite and public opposition to nuclear proliferation. To evaluate the
effects of these seven types of nonproliferation information, we devise
a novel experiment on attitude change, where attitude change is defined
as a change in both opinion and behavior. In the opinion change
experiment, which is fielded at the beginning of the survey,
pro-armament subjects are randomly assigned to one of seven types of
nonproliferation information that is briefed to be written by South
Korean foreign policy experts. In the behavior change experiment
conducted after the opinion change experiment, pro-armament subjects are
asked to allocate donation money to either pro- or anti-armament
organizations. The initial experiment was conducted in December 2019 and
was repeated in January 2022 to assess the sensitivity of the initial
findings to changes in the internal and external experimental
conditions.

The [findings]{.underline} of our experiments **[clearly
show]{.underline}** that [experts' nonproliferation information had
a]{.underline} **[considerable impact]{.underline}** [on pro-armament
subjects' attitude changes]{.underline}. In the 2019 and 2022
experiments, an average of 53.4% of pro-armament subjects changed their
opinions and 16.8% of them changed their behaviors after receiving
credible nonproliferation information. Economic sanctions information
has the largest treatment effect on pro-armament subjects' attitude
change in both the 2019 and 2022 experiments. When given economic
sanctions information, an average of 77% of proarmament subjects changed
their opinions and 24% of them changed their behaviors in both
experiments. This finding suggests that the pro-armament public may
change their pre-existing attitudes if they learn about the consequences
of postarmament economic sanctions, which we call the *enlightening
effect of economic sanctions information*.

This is [in]{.underline} **[stark contrast]{.underline}** [to other

As discussions regarding this issue and its potential drawbacks have
gained traction among the population, [support for such a move
has]{.underline} **[significantly]{.underline}** [waned]{.underline}.

[According to]{.underline} the findings of [a survey
conducted]{.underline} by the Korea Institute for National Unification
(KINU), [public endorsement for]{.underline} **[South
Korea]{.underline}** [to possess nuclear weapons has]{.underline}
**[experienced a notable decline]{.underline}**.

The [study]{.underline}, released on June 5, [indicates]{.underline}
that [support for a domestic nuclear arsenal has dropped from
a]{.underline} **[peak of 71]{.underline}**.3**[%]{.underline}** in 2021
to 69% in 2022 and further down [to]{.underline}
**[60]{.underline}**.2**[%]{.underline}** as of last month.

These [figures illustrate a]{.underline} **[clear downward
trend]{.underline}** [in public sentiment toward]{.underline} **[South
Korea]{.underline}** [building its own nuclear arsenal]{.underline}.

The [decline in support]{.underline} can be [seen as]{.underline}
**[unexpected]{.underline}** [given]{.underline} **[North
Korea's]{.underline}** [increased frequency of missile launches and
weapons tests]{.underline}, surpassing 100 since early 2022, [and the
ongoing war in]{.underline} **[Ukraine]{.underline}** [prompting nations
to reassess]{.underline} their [defense capabilities]{.underline} and
strategies.

[Even the]{.underline} **[high poll numbers]{.underline}** [in

### No Prolif Impact---East Asia

#### No impact to East Asian prolif.

in East Asia's Nuclear Debates,"
https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/07/15/us-south-korea-japan-east-asia-nuclear-debates-nonproliferation/

Global Zero [advocates]{.underline}, such as political scientist Scott
Sagan, [worry about]{.underline} the transactional issues of WMD
possession because they are uniquely dangerous weapons. Indeed,
[**theft**, **loss**, **rogue scientists**, and so]{.underline} on are
legitimate fears. But they are no more resonant with South Korea or
Japan than with any other nuclear weapons state. Indeed, [as liberal
**democracies** with **robust state capacities** and preexisting,
well-managed]{.underline} [**nuclear energy** programs, they will likely
be quite **responsible**]{.underline}, as Britain and France have been.

[No one]{.underline} seriously [believes Seoul or Tokyo will launch an
**out-of-the-blue**, nuclear-first strike]{.underline} on an opponent;
[set up]{.underline} something like the A.Q. Khan [**proliferation**
network; **sell WMDs**]{.underline} to terrorists or other rogues; [put
Homer **Simpson** in charge of]{.underline} nuclear [safety; or
be]{.underline} so **[sloppy]{.underline}** as to require something like
the Nunn-Lugar program. Even Pakistan and India have been better with
their arsenals than the panic of the late 1990s suggested. Even
[dictatorships have been **cautious** about these issues]{.underline}.
And as [**democracies** with a history of **foreign-policy
restraint**]{.underline}, democratic peace theory [suggests they would
be **good stewards**]{.underline}, certainly better than East Asia's
autocratic nuclear powers.

There is [generalized anxiety about a regional **arms
race**]{.underline}, which South Korean/Japanese nuclearization might
exacerbate. Perhaps, but as noted above, [there is **no local cascade**
to be sparked because it has already occurred. **China**, **Russia**,
and **No**]{.underline}rth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea [have all moved
first]{.underline}. China and Russia have established nuclear arsenals
[and **no intention** of complying with the build-down imperative.
Russia's]{.underline} growing [rhetorical **invocation**]{.underline} of
its nuclear weapons [is a disturbing evolution. No]{.underline}rth
[Ko]{.underline}rea repeatedly agreed, non-bindingly since 1992, to
avoid nuclear weapons---only to [**exit** the **NPT** and keep
building]{.underline}. It now has intercontinental ballistic missiles
and several dozen nuclear warheads.

### 1NC---Japan Disadvantage 

#### The Alliance is [strong now]{.underline} despite tariffs, but the plan would [shock]{.underline} Japan and [cause them to proliferate]{.underline}---maintaining the [stable alliance]{.underline} is key

Isn't China or North Korea. It's the US.", *American Enterprise

The [US-Japan alliance has never been more important or
stronger]{.underline}. And [rarely has it faced]{.underline} greater
[uncertainties]{.underline} or dangers. [That's]{.underline} the
[paradoxical]{.underline} takeaway from my trip last week to Tokyo,
where I spoke to government and private-sector audiences about the state
of the world.

[Japan faces growing threats]{.underline} in its neighborhood,
[from]{.underline} a bellicose [China and]{.underline} a potentially
provocative [North Korea.]{.underline} But [the state of America was the
foremost worry]{.underline} of nearly everyone I met.

[Washington's alliance with Japan has been an inspiring]{.underline}
reminder that friendship can follow bitter enmity. [It has anchored the
US security presence]{.underline} in the Pacific for decades and looms
ever-larger today. [The risk of conflict in that region is rising, and
America's military edge is slipping]{.underline}. That means [Washington
will need greater support from its friends]{.underline} --- and [it
makes Japan]{.underline}, [America's most powerful ally]{.underline} in
the world's most crucial region, utterly [indispensable]{.underline}.

On many dimensions, **[the relationship is thriving]{.underline}**.
[Japan is muscling up militarily, by planning to nearly double defense
spending between 2022 and 2027]{.underline}. [Tokyo and
Washington]{.underline} are gradually turning what was once a deeply
asymmetrical alliance --- [a strategic protectorate]{.underline}, really
--- into a genuine warfighting partnership.

[Tokyo has also made itself a vital regional asset]{.underline} by
[engaging countries in Southeast Asia,]{.underline} where US ties are
sometimes strained. In [strengthening security partnerships]{.underline}
with India, Australia and the Philippines, and joining a host of
trilateral and quadrilateral arrangements, [Japan has become a crucial
node in an emerging regional security network.]{.underline}

There are [challenges on the horizon]{.underline}. Japan may struggle to
push defense spending past 2% of gross domestic product after 2027, let
alone reach the 5% standard that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth
endorsed in his recent speech to the Shangi-La Dialogue in Singapore.
[Japanese officials welcome affirmations]{.underline} that the Pacific
is America's priority theater, [but they wonder,]{.underline} following
yet another US military intervention in the Middle East, [whether the
elusive pivot will ever]{.underline} really [happen]{.underline}.
Meanwhile, [intensive security cooperation coexists with profound
**anxiety**]{.underline} [about where the larger relationship might
go.]{.underline}

The [biggest headaches are economic.]{.underline} President Donald Trump
rightly won plaudits for OKing Nippon Steel's acquisition of US Steel,
after his predecessor, Joe Biden, had stymied the deal on made-up
national security grounds. [But Trump's tariff proposals have been
particularly galling to the Japanese]{.underline}, who had cut a new
trade pact with the president in his first term and were hoping that as
America's most important ally, [they wouldn't be treated as a commercial
enemy.]{.underline}

A deal to prevent Trump from reimposing the worst levies seems likely:
Japan can't afford a trade war with the US amid the threat of a real war
with China. [But there is a strong sense that the US is abandoning the
open global economy it once anchored]{.underline}.

In remarks at the Nikkei Future of Asia Forum last week, both Prime
Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya argued that
Japan and its neighbors must cooperate to defend free trade. The
unspoken implication was that the country attacking it is the US.

Then there are the political perplexities, on both sides. Ishiba's
minority government seems likely to lose seats in upcoming parliamentary
elections, which could bring out the knives for an unpopular prime
minister. But regardless of who holds that job, Japan will probably have
weak leaders for the foreseeable future. That will hinder efforts to
push through ambitious economic or security reforms, let alone grapple
with a potentially disastrous demographic decline.

[If Japan's politics are uninspiring, America's seem downright
befuddlin]{.underline}g. A superpower that has long provided global
peace and prosperity is now threatening to grab land from its allies and
is whipsawing the world economy with capricious, ill-considered policy
decisions.

[Trump's administration is attacking the innovation
ecosystem]{.underline} and inflows of global talent that underpin US
economic primacy. It is slashing the national security infrastructure
that helps a president handle dangerous crises. Most fundamentally, [the
two-time triumph of a man so ambivalent toward US allies and global
engagement unavoidably raises questions about whether Trump's presidency
marks the start of a longer America First era, in which Washington
rejects the international order it once led.]{.underline}

[It's hard to overstate how jarring that would be for
Japan.]{.underline} It recovered from World War II under American
patronage and protection. [Japanese officials know that the **regional
balance will buckle** if Washington **pulls back** as Beijing surges
forward.]{.underline} For decades, t[he alliance with America has been
the bedrock of Japanese foreign policy. If that alliance ever falters,
drastic measures --- like **building nuclear weapons** --- might be the
requirement of Japan's survival.]{.underline}

No one I spoke to thinks such a rupture is imminent. In the near term,
few countries are working with Trump's America more closely. But in the
long term, few countries are more challenged by what his presidency
might augur for America's approach to global affairs. So for now, [the
alliance is thriving --- even as Japanese strategists contemplate the
possibility of a post-American world]{.underline}.

[During his **visit** to Washington, D.C., in February 2025, Prime
Minister **ISHIBA** Shigeru held a **summit meeting** with President
Donald J. **Trump** of the United States.]{.underline} The two leaders
shared the views on the severe and complex security environment and
[concurred to work closely to realize a **Free and Open Indo-Pacific**
(FOIP) and]{.underline} to [elevate the **Japan-U.S. Alliance** to **new
heights.**]{.underline} They also [concurred to strengthen the
**deterrence** and response capabilities of the Japan-U.S. Alliance and
to work closely to **address strategic challenges**]{.underline} in the
region that [both countries are facing.]{.underline}

Prime Minister [Ishiba reiterated Japan's unwavering **commitment** to
fundamentally reinforcing its **defense capabilities**]{.underline} and
President [Trump welcomed]{.underline} such commitment. President [Trump
underscored the unwavering commitment by the U.S. to the **defense of
Japan**, using its full range of capabilities, including
**nuclear**]{.underline}. The two leaders once again [reaffirmed that
**Article V** of the Japan-U.S. Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and
Security applies to the **Senkaku Islands**.]{.underline} The two
leaders confirmed their [commit]{.underline}ment [to the steady
implementation of the realignment of **U.S. Forces** in Japan in
accordance with the **Okinawa Consolidation Plan**, including the
construction of the Futenma Replacement Facility at Henoko and the
return of Marine Corps Air Station (**MCAS) Futenma.**]{.underline}

Furthermore, [they affirmed that Japan and the U.S. are **close
partners** in the **economic field** as well, with Japan being the
world\'s **largest investor** in the U.S. for five consecutive
years.]{.underline} Prime Minister [Ishiba conveyed his willingness to
cooperate together to elevate Japan's investment in the U.S. to an
**unprecedented** amount of **1 trillion dollars**, and President Trump
strongly welcomed such investments by Japanese companies.]{.underline}

The two leaders then [concurred to elevate the Japan-U.S. partnership to
an even higher level through improving **business environment** and
increasing **bilateral investment** and employment, strengthening each
other's industries and leading the world in **development** in the field
of technologies such as **AI** and leading-edge
**semiconductors**,]{.underline} and strongly [promoting efforts to
**harness** the energy of the **growing market** in the **Indo-Pacific
region**]{.underline}. They also confirmed that they will [cooperate to
strengthen **energy security**]{.underline} between the two countries,
[including increasing **exports** of U.S. **liquefied natural gas** to
Japan, in a mutually beneficial manner.]{.underline}

In addition, they [shared]{.underline} the [view on]{.underline} issues
related to **[China]{.underline}** and [**confirmed** their
**opposition** to any unilateral attempts to change the status quo by
force or coercion including in the East and South China
Seas.]{.underline} The two leaders [reiterated the importance of
**peace** and stability across the **Taiwan Strait**]{.underline}. They
also shared the views on the situation [regarding **North
Korea,**]{.underline} and [affirmed the need to address its nuclear and
missile issues together]{.underline}, as well as their [resolute
commitment to the **complete denuclearization** of North
Korea]{.underline}. Prime Minister [Ishiba asked for]{.underline}
continued understanding and [cooperation]{.underline} of the U.S.
[for]{.underline} the immediate [resolution of the **abductions issue**,
and gained full support]{.underline} from President Trump.

The two leaders [concurred on]{.underline} the importance of further
[developing coordination of **like-minded countries**, including
Japan-U.S.-Republic of **Korea** (ROK), Japan-**Australia**-India-U.S.,
and Japan-U.S.-**Philippines**.]{.underline} They concurred to [maintain
close partnership to further uphold and bolster the Japan-U.S.
relations, which have become **stronger than ever**, and]{.underline}
they [issued a joint statement]{.underline} (Full text: United
States-Japan Joint Leaders' Statement). At the end of the meeting, Prime
Minister Ishiba invited President Trump to the official visit to Japan
at an early timing.

[At the joint press conference]{.underline} held [after]{.underline} the
meeting, [the Prime Minister summarized the results of the summit
as]{.underline} follows: "While this was [the **first
time**]{.underline} for President Trump and I [to speak face to
face,]{.underline} I believe we had an [extremely fruitful meeting
covering topics of great substance]{.underline}, and we engaged in [a

**[Japan]{.underline}** has [raised concerns over China\'s expanding
**military presence** and the shifting balance of power]{.underline} in
the Asia-Pacific.

[China\'s actions]{.underline} \"[present an **unprecedented** and the
greatest strategic **challenge**]{.underline},\" the [Japanese Defense
Ministry wrote in its annual white paper]{.underline}.

Why It Matters

The report comes as Chinese President Xi Jinping pushes to complete the
People\'s Liberation Army\'s modernization by 2035 and seeks to replace
the United States as the region\'s dominant military power. China
possesses the world\'s largest navy, a vast missile arsenal, and is
rapidly building up its nuclear capabilities.

China\'s increasing coast guard patrols near the disputed,
[Tokyo-administered Senkaku Islands]{.underline}, [and continued threats
toward neighboring]{.underline} [Taiwan]{.underline} have [prompted
Japan to reinterpret its postwar constitution to allow for the
collective **self-defense** of **allies**, boost defense spending, and
pursue **closer cooperation** with its **defense treaty** partner, the
**U.S**]{.underline}.

Newsweek reached out to the Pentagon via email for comment.

What To Know

\"The international community is facing its greatest trial since World
War II and entering a new era of crisis,\" Japanese Minister of Defense
Gen Nakatani said in the white paper presented to the Cabinet on
Tuesday.

While the 534-page [report also highlighted]{.underline} Russia\'s
military activities and North Korea\'s frequent missile launches and
advancing nuclear weapons program, it was China that was described as
the preeminent threat.

\"[Japan should respond with its comprehensive national power and in
cooperation and **collaboration** with its **ally**, **like-minded
countries**, and others]{.underline},\" the authors stated.

China\'s navy has been operating farther afield and near Japanese
territory with increasing frequency, the report said, noting that
Chinese navy warships passing between islands in Japan\'s southwestern
prefecture of Okinawa have tripled in number between 2021 and 2024.

The defense ministry expressed \"grave concern\" over recent
encroachments by China, citing the Chinese spy plane that entered
Japanese airspace, as well as the aircraft carrier Liaoning\'s passage
through the narrow gap separating Okinawa\'s Yonaguni island and Taiwan
in October.

Also featured in the report is the near-daily presence of Chinese coast
guard ships near the disputed Senkaku Islands---known as the Diaoyu
Islands in China---which the report characterized as a unilateral
attempt to change the status quo.

The report drew parallels with China\'s expansive activities in the
South China Sea, where Chinese maritime forces have drawn fire for their
increasing activities within the exclusive economic zone of the
Philippines.

China\'s strengthening security ties with Russia, including joint bomber
flights and warship patrols near Japan, described as shows of force,
continue to be a source of concern.

As for Taiwan, the self-ruled democracy China claims as its territory
and has threatened to unify by force if necessary, the defense ministry
warned that the military balance between the two sides is shifting
rapidly in Beijing\'s favor.

The paper also expressed growing concern over Beijing\'s increasing use
of gray-zone activities---coercive actions that stop short of war---and
warned that military pressure, including potential blockades, could be
used to threaten Taipei.

Although the U.S. remains Taiwan\'s primary arms supplier under the 1979
Taiwan Relations Act, Washington has maintained a policy of \"strategic
ambiguity\" regarding whether it would intervene militarily.

Many analysts believe that Japan, which views a Chinese takeover of
Taiwan as an existential threat to its national security, would likely
participate in a U.S.-led counteroffensive if conflict erupted.

What People Are Saying

Japanese Defense Minister Gen Nakatani, in the white paper: \"Under
these circumstances, Japan\...is fundamentally strengthening its defense
capabilities, including the ability to carry out counterstrike
operations, and is making steady progress on various measures, including
securing and strengthening the necessary defense budget.

\"At the same time, [Japan is working to further deepen its **alliance**
with the **U**nited **S**tates, which serves as the **cornerstone** of
its **security**, and to expand **security cooperation** with
like-minded countries and others]{.underline}.\"

#### They're strengthening

accessed: 7.18.25\]

Over the two years since the announcement of its current national
security and defense strategies, **[Japan]{.underline}** has [taken
**major steps** toward increased defense capabilities and closer
**cooperation** with the **U**nited **S**tates as well as other
**allies** and **partners**]{.underline}. The Biden-Kishida summit of
last April further [extended alliance commitments in such areas as
**joint operations**, **regional defense** networks, science and
technology **collaboration**, information and **cybersecurity**
measures, and defense industrial collaboration]{.underline}.

The recent [launch of a new channel for **armaments**-related
dialogue]{.underline} could for the first time [broaden **bilateral
engagement** across a full spectrum of acquisition
interests]{.underline}. Common requirements for capabilities like
[**uncrewed aircraft** and **hypersonic interceptors** offer new
opportunities for cooperative acquisition]{.underline}, while
[strengthened **supply chain** arrangements]{.underline} can [lead to
closer **collaboration** among the **industrial bases**]{.underline} of
the United States, Japan, and other allies. However, achieving this
potential will require not only resets in policy on both sides but an
evolution to approaches more characteristic of true partnerships than
traditional supplier-customer relations.

July 11 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Friday played
down concerns about relations with key [U.S. ally Japan]{.underline},
saying there is [no \"**drama** or **division**]{.underline},\" despite
the Japanese prime minister speaking of the need for Tokyo to wean
itself off U.S. dependence.

In remarks to reporters, Rubio also disputed reports of [U.S. pressure
on Japan to significantly increase its **defense
spending**]{.underline}, saying that while Washington was
\"encouraging\" Tokyo to invest in certain capabilities, this did not
amount to a \"demand.\"

\"It\'s [less to do with the amount of money]{.underline} and [more to
do about certain things they can do]{.underline},\" he said after
attending a regional meeting in Malaysia.

Japanese media reported last month that the Trump administration was
demanding that Japan and other Asian allies boost defense spending to 5%
of GDP in line with demands on NATO members.

A Financial Times report last month said Japan canceled an annual
defense and foreign ministers meeting with the U.S. after it called on
Tokyo to boost defense spending beyond what it requested earlier.

President Donald Trump further upset Japan this week by announcing a 25%
tariff on Japanese imports starting August 1 as part of his global
tariff strategy.

On Thursday, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said Japan needed to
wean itself from U.S. dependence in security, food, and energy.

Asked about Ishiba\'s remarks, Rubio said the United States has \"a
[very **strong** and very good relationship with Japan]{.underline}, and
[that\'s not going to change]{.underline}.\"

\"Anyone who\'s looking for, like, drama or division there \...
shouldn\'t be doing it because the [truth of the matter is our
relationship with Japan is very **solid**]{.underline}**.\"**

He said Ishiba\'s comment should not be viewed negatively.

\"The idea that [Japan\'s military would become more capable
is]{.underline} not something we would be offended by; [it\'s something
we would actually be encouraged by]{.underline},\" he said.

Reemergence of the North Pacific in Japan's Strategic Landscape

[To most Japanese, the Arctic is a place for scientific exploration and
expeditions]{.underline}. During the Cold War, however, the North
Pacific, which includes the Bearing Sea adjacent to the Arctic, was the
frontline of the Cold War in the Far East. Indeed, this was the area
where Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) worked closely with
the U.S. Navy on anti-submarine and other naval surveillance operations
to keep the Soviet military in check.

Fast forward to the 21st century, and [Japan has not been oblivious to
the rising importance of the Arctic,]{.underline} either. The Japanese
government, following [Japan's ascendance to the Arctic
Council]{.underline} as a permanent observer in 2013, issued its Arctic
Policy in 2015 which focuses on (1) environment, (2) indigenous
population, (3) science and technology, (4) promoting the rule of law,
(5) utilization of the Arctic passage route, (6) natural resource
development, and (7) regional security. This policy was incorporated
into Japan's Third Basic Plan for Ocean Policy, most recently updated in
2018. Despite [the]{.underline} [regional security consideration,
Japan's approach to the Arctic has been firmly rooted in three areas --
scientific research, promotion of international cooperation, and
sustainable development of the Arctic]{.underline}.

However, as [the geostrategic competition in the Arctic]{.underline}
seems to intensify, the North Pacific may re-enter Japan's strategic
landscape. Namely, [the greater interest by China on engaging the Arctic
countries through]{.underline} investments in infrastructure and energy
developments in the region has **[compelled]{.underline}** [Japan to
work with U.S]{.underline}. and European partners to ensure that the
Arctic remains "free and open and is governed by the rule of law".

Indeed, Japan has been reenergizing its outreach to Northern Europe --

When then-foreign minister Yoko Kamikawa visited Sweden in January 2024,
she unveiled Japan's Northern European Diplomacy Initiative with four
focus areas: the Arctic, gender issues, broader economic cooperation
(including cooperation in science and technology), and defense. While
cooperation in the Arctic under this initiative is centered in
cooperation in scientific research, environmental preservation, and
human resources development, the countries that have high stakes in the
Arcti,c such as Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland have been
identified as the countries with which Japan seeks to strengthen its
defense relations.

What's more, [China's growing cooperation with Russia only
**aggravates** Japan's concern of China's behavior in the
Arctic]{.underline}.

North Pacific in the U.S.-Japan Alliance

Given [the emergence of the Arctic as the next ground for geostrategic
competition]{.underline}, [security cooperation in the
Arctic]{.underline} and the broader North Pacific [may re-emerge as
places for deeper U.S.-Japan alliance cooperation]{.underline} as Japan
looks to push for greater cooperation with Northern European countries.
In fact, [despite rising tensions in the trans-Atlantic alliance over
the handling of the Russia-Ukraine wa]{.underline}r and trade, the
[Arctic]{.underline} [provides a unique opportunity for **greater**
cooperation.]{.underline} Indeed, [Japan's approach to the
Arctic]{.underline}---primarily focused on scientific research and
environmental conservation---[makes Tokyo well-positioned to facilitate
the cooperation between the U.S., Japan, and North Europe at a critical
juncture for the future of the trans-Atlantic alliance]{.underline}.

In the context of [the U.S.-Japan alliance,]{.underline} Japan [can
leverage the assets and capabilities]{.underline} that the Japan
Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) has already developed to enhance its
role in surveillance and intelligence-gathering in the North Pacific.
Even after the Cold War, [the]{.underline} [JMSDF maintained its
surveillance and intelligence-gathering operations in the North to keep
not only North Korea's but also China's and Russia's military behavior
in check]{.underline}. These [efforts]{.underline} [may need to be
enhanced once again]{.underline}, especially given the elevated level of
military activities by China and Russia.

The biggest challenge for Japan may lie in resource allocation. Japan
has spent the last 10-15 years redirecting its defense investment and
its force posture to focus more on defending the Southwestern Islands.
The resurgence of the Cold War-era challenge from the North could
complicate the ongoing effort, as Japan now has to respond to the
security concern in the North once again. However, [as Japan anticipates
a U.S. request to "do more" in the U.S.-Japan alliance, enhancing its
investment to support Japan's capability for North Pacific security can
offer a meaningful option]{.underline}.

While U.S. President Donald [Trump\'s messaging for Europe has been
almost consistently negative, the same **cannot be said** for Japan.
Since returning to office, his administration has been **nothing but
positive**]{.underline} (apart from on tariffs) [on the U.S.-Japan
alliance.]{.underline} As encouraging as this situation may seem, past
precedent should not be taken as a prediction of the future,
particularly given how rapidly U.S. policy keeps changing.

[In a February **meeting** with Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, Trump
**reiterated** the United States\' unwavering commitment to Japan\'s
defense using its **full range of capabilities**. The two also agreed to
continue to strengthen **bilateral ties** in a host of areas in both the
**military and economic** domains.]{.underline}

Then [in March, in his first visit to the Indo-Pacific since becoming
the secretary of defense, Pete **Hegseth** offered similar
**reassurances** to Tokyo. One item]{.underline}, which some reports had
initially cast doubt on, [was the continued commitment to **upgrade**
the current U.S. Forces Japan command into an **operational command**.
He also reiterated the **value** the United States places on Japan,
saying that the two countries "stand **firmly together** in the face of
aggressive and coercive actions by the **communist Chinese**." He made
similar comments again]{.underline} last wee[k at the Shangri La
Dialogue. Collectively, these actions look very familiar to summits and
announcements by **every U.S. administration** this
century.]{.underline} Importantly[, they]{.underline} serve to [**allay
anxieties** in Tokyo]{.underline} about the Trump administration\'s
commitment to the region or to Japan.

[This **contrasts** with the state of U.S. relations with
**Europe**]{.underline}, where Trump has been crafting a new approach in
trans-Atlantic ties. Washington has pushed Brussels to take on more
responsibility for its own defense, threatening the possibility of not
defending NATO members that do not meet a defense spending threshold.
And where Europeans have been seeking ways to keep the United States
committed to the defense of Ukraine, they have struggled, even being
kept out of the initiation of peace talks with Russia in Saudi Arabia.
Collectively, U.S. efforts appear to be an attempt to transform the
transatlantic relationship in profound ways. And unlike Japan, these
actions foretell a distancing from Europe and NATO in particular.

Last week, [U.S. President Donald **Trump** signaled a shift in his
approach to **tariffs, pausing** his "reciprocal" tariffs for a 90-day
period to seek a negotiated path to **rebalance trade** while doubling
down on tariffs on China]{.underline} and maintaining a 10 percent
universal tariff on all other trading partners.

Th[is suggested a **"pivot"** that could **recalibrate** U.S. trade
strategy in ways that reverberate across the
**Indo-Pacific**.]{.underline} While much remains unknown about how the
pause, negotiations, and China-targeted trade war will play out, one
implication should be clear: [at a time of global economic uncertainty,
shifting geopolitical alignments, and increasing strategic competition,
the United States must **double down** on its most **vital alliances**
in Asia -- starting with the partnership with **Japan**.]{.underline}

[Japan's Economic Revitalization Minister Akazawa **Ryosei** arrived in
Washington, D.C. on April 16 for talks this week with U.S. Treasury
Secretary Scott **Bessent** and Trade Representative Jamieson **Greer.**
Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Hayashi Yoshimasa said the trip aimed
to "**build a relationship of trust**" and seek a pathway
forward]{.underline}. While the 24 percent "reciprocal" tariffs
announced for Japan have been paused, the 10 percent remains in addition
to a 25 percent tariff on cars, auto parts, steel and aluminum exports
from Japan.

[Japan is more than a longtime ally --- it is a **linchpin** of U.S.
Indo-Pacific strategy. A strong Japan-U.S. alliance is **indispensable
for peace and prosperity** in Asia, and the two countries are bound by
shared democratic values, mutual defense commitments, deep economic
integration, and a common vision for a free and open
region]{.underline}. But with Trump's pivot on tariffs raising fresh
questions about the future direction of U.S. trade policy, [now is the
**moment to expand** --- not just preserve --- the alliance with Tokyo
across military, diplomatic, and economic dimensions.]{.underline}

[The recent visit by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth to Japan
underscored the growing urgency and **opportunity** to deepen security
cooperation. The trip resulted in **meaningful progress** on
interoperability, regional deterrence, and defense technology
**collaboration**. Notably, Japan reaffirmed its commitment to
**increasing defense spending** --- part of a broader strategic
realignment that includes acquiring counterstrike capabilities and
modernizing its Self-Defense Forces. The **U.S.,** for its part,
**reaffirmed** its ironclad commitment to Japan's defense under
**Article 5** of the mutual security treaty, including over the
contested Senkaku Islands, which are claimed by China as the Diaoyu
Islands.]{.underline}

[These developments are essential]{.underline}, but they're only a
starting point. The [next steps]{.underline} must [include a **deeper
integration** of command-and-control structures, **joint military
exercises** that reflect real-world contingencies (particularly
involving Taiwan), and the co-development of **next-generation defense**
technologies, from AI-enabled systems to space-based
capabilities.]{.underline} As China grows more assertive, and as North
Korea accelerates its nuclear and missile programs deterrence must be
made [more credible, visible, and tightly coordinated.]{.underline}

At the same time, [economic collaboration with Japan must also be
**reinvigorated**]{.underline}. The second Trump administration's
imposition of universal tariffs has created uncertainty for American
workers and businesses and for the country's allies. While the intention
may be laudable -- to rebalance trade and strengthen the U.S. economy --
the risk remains that broad tariffs, especially if poorly targeted,
could undermine the very economic partnerships that are essential to
compete with China in an era where geoeconomic competition is as
fiercely contested -- and perhaps more so -- than geostrategic
competition.

The [U.S. and Japan]{.underline} should [approach this moment as a
chance to forge a **new economic compact** --- one that balances
national security with economic dynamism and the synergistic
opportunities across a range of new and emergent technologies. It's a
chance to **update the alliance** for a new era of strategic
competition, including cooperation on **digital trade standards**,
critical minerals, **semiconductor** supply chains, and mutual
**protections** for strategic industries]{.underline}. The goal should
be [to **counter China**'s economic coercion not just with
protectionism, but with trusted, rules-based collaboration between
allies.]{.underline}

Indeed, [Tokyo has been **consistent** in its willingness to deepen its
**economic ties** with the United States. Consider the]{.underline}
proposed [U.S. Steel-Nippon Steel **acquisition**,]{.underline} which
unfortunately turned into political football as opposed to an
opportunity to demonstrate what collaborative investments and an allied
approach to a stronger defense industrial base can look like. While
national security concerns must be taken seriously, Japan is not a
strategic rival --- it is one of the United States' closest allies. [An
investment]{.underline} from an ally [that injects capital and
competitiveness into U.S. industry, safeguarding jobs and **revitalizing
domestic production**]{.underline}, is precisely the sort of result that
the administration should be driving for. And now it seems like [the
Trump administration is now on the **right path**]{.underline}, so long
as the tariff rollercoaster does not complicate the moment[, with the
Committee on Foreign Investment on United States (CFIUS)
**re-examining** the transaction.]{.underline}

[Diplomatically, the alliance has **rarely been better aligned**.
Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru's recent visit to the U.S.
provided an opportunity to **further institutionalize** the partnership
and deepen the shared approach to the Indo-Pacific, including through
**new trilateral dialogues** with South Korea, a **reinvigorated Quad**,
and deeper cooperation with **Taipei** and other like-minded democracies
that can also serve to drive development **diplomacy** in Southeast Asia
and the Pacific in the face of China's new charm offensive in the
region.]{.underline}

The bottom line is this: While [Trump's tariff policy]{.underline}
risked destabilizing Washington's relationship with Tokyo, it now
[provides an **opening to catalyze** a smarter, alliance-driven economic
strategy alongside **deeper security** and **diplomatic
cooperation.**]{.underline}

The choice is clear. Allies are friends, not foes. Alliances are not
just military constructs, but economic and diplomatic force multipliers.
Reinvigorated structures --- both formal and informal --- are necessary
to ensure the Japan-U.S. alliance thrives not just in response to a
crisis, but as the foundation for regional stability. If U.S.
policymakers are serious about reasserting American strength, they must
work hand-in-hand with allies like Japan to meet the challenge of
strategic competition with China, and to shape the rules of the road for
this century. There is an opportunity to turn this moment of tariff
uncertainty into a moment of alliance clarity. But only if Washington
acts now --- strategically, boldly, and in concert with its allies.

[Geopolitical tensions began increasing in the Arctic]{.underline} well

that the region was a unique zone of peace and somehow immune to
conflicts plaguing other world areas. Although [US Indo-Pacific partners

Arctic]{.underline}, especially energy and economic security,
[engaging]{.underline} with them in political-military [frameworks such
as]{.underline} NATO's IP4[, the US-ROK-Japan alliance]{.underline}, the
QUAD,82 or bilateral security partnerships, may not be the ideal path
forward. As we have seen, US Indo-Pacific [partners with
interests]{.underline} in the Arctic [have]{.underline} their own
specific geopolitical and geoeconomic [concerns with
Russia]{.underline}---[especially]{.underline} territorial disputes for
[Japan, the]{.underline} security of the Korean peninsula for the

[they **may not want** to directly engage with the US on **difficult
security issues** in the Arctic for fear of
**exacerbating**]{.underline} the [security threats they face
alread]{.underline}y. Moreover, from their respective geographic
positions, participation in the NSR has required some form of engagement
with Russia, its gatekeeper. To be sure, [US Indo-Pacific partners
monitor Sino-Russian joint patrols]{.underline} in the Bering Strait and
the Baltic Sea closely, and view them with concern, [just as the US
does. Nevertheless, China's challenge to the region in the near term
centers more on its strategic investments]{.underline}, its ability to
deploy dual-use technologies, and interest in participating in regional
rule-making---[all better suited to non-military responses by the US and
its Indo-Pacific partners]{.underline}.83

RE-EMERGING HISTORIC PARADIGMS -- JAPAN'S ARCTIC (RE-)TURN

Today, [Japan's official interest in the Arctic continues to grow as its
historical threat horizons **re-emerge**]{.underline}. No doubt,
[Beijing's discursive campaign to tout itself as a "**near-Arctic
state**" , combined with its declaration of a "Polar Silk Road", is
being watched carefully in Tokyo]{.underline} (Sharma, 2021). However,
despite China's increasing geopolitical efforts in the Arctic, and aside
from the perennial threats of an unpredictable North Korea, it is the
[historical threat from the Russian bear that **still haunts** Japan's
geopolitical perceptions of the region.]{.underline} There is little
doubt that Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, and Tokyo's backing of
the latter, has undercut post-Soviet discussions on the return of the
Kurils to Japan and the signing of a Russo-Japanese peace treaty to
officially end World War II (Chang, 2022; Gavin, 2021; Puzanova, 2020).
But as early as 2015[, Japan was already hedging against the
re-emergence of a direct Russian threat emanating from the northern
approaches]{.underline}.

In Japan's Arctic Policy (2015), coming seven years before the first US
National Strategy for the Arctic Region (2022) and four years before
Canada's Arctic and Northern Policy Framework (2019), [Tokyo clearly
delineated the **importance of maintaining the "Free and Open**" aspect
of the Arctic]{.underline}. The policy states that: "it is important to
prevent moves to strengthen military presence in the region from leading
to tension and confrontations...it is necessary to pay close attention
to moves by the states concerned and also to promote cooperation with
Arctic and other states" (Headquarters for Ocean Policy, 2015). [While
not openly calling-out Russian re-militarization in the region, it is
obvious where Tokyo was pointing its not-so-subtle
ambiguity]{.underline}.

Indeed, the requirement of retaining strategic freedom-of-action in the
region, and the North Pacific more broadly, is the key feature in
Japan's broader approach to the Arctic. Without this strategic access
and placement, [Japan's ability to achieve the other objectives of its
Arctic policy will be severely curtailed, including: addressing "Global
Environmental Issues", the protection of the Arctic's "Indigenous
Peoples", expanding scientific internationalism with other "Arctic
States", "Ensuring the Rule of Law" and freedom of navigation as laid
out in the United Nations Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the opening and
accessibility of the "Arctic Sea Route", and the development of
sustainable access to mineral and marine natural resources]{.underline}
(Headquarters for Ocean Policy, 2015). [Japan's road to the Arctic runs
through the Kurils and, thus, being **able to project power in spite of
a growing Russian military** presence and A2AD zone in the region will
**form a key element of Japan's national strategy** in the coming
decades]{.underline} (Barrash, 2022).

There is no doubt that Japan is a de facto Arctic power -- or to use
Beijing's sophistry, a "near-Arctic state". This is not a new
phenomenon, like that of China, but rather an historical necessity based
on Japan's geography. However, it is the speed over the last decade at
which [Japan is **positioning itself to secure access** to this
historical and geopolitically existential region that is most notable.
By most traditional measures of geopolitical power, Japan greatly
outdistances all the other Arctic Council states aside from its treaty
ally the United States]{.underline} and its principal geopolitical
competitor China---though Japan can focus its geopolitical capital more
on the Arctic than an inherently Eurasian land power and, when
necessary, coordinate its efforts with those of the United States. When
compared to rest of the Arctic Council in terms of nominal gross
domestic product (GDP), Japan's GDP is more than double that of Canada,
or Russia, or of all the Arctic Council's Scandinavian members combined
(IMF, 2023).

Japan is further seeking greater trade integration with both the
European Union (EU) and the United Kingdom (UK) -- which the continued
thawing of the Northern Sea Route and Northeast Passage through the
Arctic will increasingly enhance (Rasmussen, 2020). In 2019, the
EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement came into effect and total trade
in goods between the two amounted to €141.4 billion in 2022 (European
Commission, 2022). Likewise, in 2020, the UK signed the UK--Japan
Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, with annual trade reaching
£27.8 billion in 2023 (HM Dept. for Business and Trade, 2024). Increased
accessibility via the Northwest Passage will also further expand
U.S.-Japanese trade---already standing at \$307.4 billion in 2022---by
bypassing the Panama Canal enroute to the Eastern seaboard (Office of
the US Trade Representative, 2022). In essence, Japan is ensuring that a
geopolitical balance-of-power along the opening Arctic Sea Route will be
maintained---with Japan, the United States, Canada, the UK, and EU
controlling the entrances and exits and the North American route, while
Russian primacy over the primary Eurasian leg will tacitly be accepted
(Nanae, 2021). Japan's central role in the opening of the Northern Sea
Route (NSR) is driving its own emergence as a geopolitical "pole" for
the Arctic (Cima & Sticklor, 2014).

As an increasing multi-polar Arctic emerges, Japan is still working to
maintain a cooperative aspect towards its relations with Russia in the
region. This is particularly true of Tokyo's drive for energy security
and diversification, as the possibility of Chinese interdiction of
energy supplies via the South China Sea during wartime or general
geopolitical instability in the Middle East increase. Indeed, as a
result of the Russo-Ukrainian War, recent US sanctions against the joint
Russo-Japan Sakhalin-2 Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) has put Tokyo
increasingly at odds with Washington (Uranaka & Takemoto, 2023). Japan
will likely remain a major shareholder in Russian-owned Sakhalin-1 and
in the developing Sakhalin-2 project, while Washington has, so far, been
willing to acquiesce to Japan's interests on the matter (Govternments of
Japan and the United States, 2023). Thus, it appears that the historical
realities of a "near-Arctic state" are forcing Japan to execute a
classic geopolitical hedging effort to balance its relations with both
Washington and Moscow---the two principle Arctic Powers.

In terms of food security, Japan is also heavily reliant on Pacific
fisheries and its large commercial fishing fleet---respectively 73.5%
and 60.9% of the US and Russian fleets operating in both the Atlantic
and Pacific (World Bank, 2021). Given the exhaustion of much of the
Pacific fisheries through illegal, unregulated and unreported (IUU)
capture by competitors like the Chinese, Arctic fisheries are emerging
as a zone of Great Power competition that Tokyo can ill-afford to ignore
(Evans & Østhagen, 2023; Myers, Chang, Watkins, & Fu, 2022). Indeed, for
over decade, Japan worked closely with like-minded Rules-based
International Order (RBIO) partners, as well as strategic competitors
like China and Russia, to develop the Agreement to Prevent Unregulated
High Seas Fisheries in the Central Arctic Ocean Fisheries (MOFA,
2021)---banning all commercial fishing in the region until fishery
populations recover (Schcreiber, 2021).

Yet, to compete with other would-be Great Powers in the Arctic,
[economic interests **must be backed** by the deterrent value of
military capability]{.underline}. While the Arctic Council's
Scandinavian members and Canada would be hard pressed to militarily
enforce their claims in the region, the JMSDF maintains one of the
world's premier naval forces (Mizokami, 2021). And unlike the United
States, Russia or China who must contend with multiple maritime theaters
through naval power disbursement, Japan can concentrate in the Northern
Pacific. In fact, aside from the navies of the United States and China,
Tokyo is projected by some to have the third most capable global force
projection capability by 2027 (Salerno-Garthwaite, 2022).

Aside from the commissioning of a new heavy icebreaker alongside the JS
Shirase, Japan has also developed its first amphibious capability since
World War II. The JGSDF's "Amphibious Rapid Deployment Brigade" (ARDB),
launched in 2018 and developed in close cooperation with the US Marine
Corps, is one of the "most significant post-war reforms" of the JGSDF
(Ishikura, 2021; Pitt, 2018). While ostensibly a capability for securing
the Southwest Islands in the East China Sea, an amphibious capability
could just as easily be employed in the sub-Arctic climates of the
Kurils from the JMSDF's three Ōsumi-class Landing Ship Tank (LST) while
supported by Tokyo's four light aircraft carriers (termed "helicopter
destroyers") operating F-35Bs (Panella, 2024). This expanding amphibious
capability, combined with the rapid expansion of Japanese precision
long-range strike systems underwritten by a major defense budget
expansion, means that Japan will soon be positioned to militarily secure
their claims on the Kurils and their access to the Arctic if required by
necessity (Yamaguchi, 2022, 2023, 2024; Yeo, 2023).

For the [United States, who will be increasingly hard-pressed to defend
both its own and its NATO allies' interests in the Arctic against China
and Russia, Japan may soon **become Washington's Arctic "Highly Capable
Ally**" of choice for strategic competition in the region]{.underline}.
Indeed, Japan's own latent Arctic Great Power status is already being
recognized by other Arctic Council states. In 2022, Ottawa signed a
defense cooperation agreement with Tokyo with specific clauses
addressing cooperation on IUU in the Northern Pacific and "maintaining
maritime order in the Arctic" (Global Affairs Canada, 2022).

CONCLUSION

Ultimately, [Japan **cannot afford to be uninvolved** in the
Arctic]{.underline}. Historically, Japan always maintained geopolitical
angst emanating from its northern flank. Whether Mongols, in the 13th
century, or the Czars in the 18th-19th century, or the Soviets in the
20th century, or a revanchist Russia and China today, [Japanese threat
horizons are **dominated** by northern strategic risk
specifically]{.underline}, and the concern regarding resources of an
island nation more broadly. [If the Arctic is **closed by a
competitor**---or worse a competitor **increases their military
posture** in the region in a place like the Russian-occupied
Kurils]{.underline}---the [direct approaches to the Japanese home
islands will be **threatened**. Furthermore, such adversarial
encroachment in the Arctic is **increasing perceptions** of strategic
isolation]{.underline} -- particularly those sea lines of communication
(SLOC) [r**eaching back** to their only treaty ally, the United
States]{.underline}. Japan's historical threat horizons remain
essentially unchanged because of the geography of the Northern Pacific.
There is no doubt that, as Nicholas Spykman surmised, geography is the
most important influence in geopolitics because it is the most permanent
(Spykman, 1983).

Likewise, based on the [**increasing geopolitical alignment** of
Japanese regional security interests with their
constitutionally--directed alliance with the United States, something
that has only increased in the last decade, the Japanese will be
**pulled north toward the Arctic** to support alliance efforts to
maintain their broader concept of a "Free and Open Indo-Pacific" in
cooler climes]{.underline} (Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 2021).
As it does for all its efforts in Northeast Asia, [the United States
will continue to **rely on forward-postured military** forces in Japan
for securing its Arctic interests]{.underline}. This US necessity,
[combined with Japan's own security interests in the region, will
further **drive U.S.-Japan coordination and cooperation** for securing
their shared interests against Sino-Russian inroads in the
Arctic]{.underline}.

There is little doubt that [Washington's and Tokyo's overlapping
security interests will **drive burden-sharing** as they both seek to
contain Russian and Chinese Arctic ambitions]{.underline}. Indeed, it
already seems that this return to Hokushin-ron, alongside its US allies
is already underway. US Arctic-qualified soldiers from the 11th Airborne
Division based in Alaska have just concluded a major bi-lateral exercise
with Japan's Northern Army---"North Wind"---in the snow-swept expanses
of Hokkaidō (Robson, 2024).

[**Opposing** China's Dividing Strategy]{.underline}

When [countries make accusations against China, they often criticize
China for utilizing a "dividing" policy]{.underline} to weaken the
adversary's coalition or alliance prtnerships. We can call these tactics
"punishment and rewards" or "public flogging." The "punishment and
rewards" tactic does not need an explanation and is often-used in
international relations (better known as \'carrots and sticks\'), but
the "public flogging" tactic may be unique to China. \"Public flogging\"
is illustrated when China picks one country in the opposing group and
uses a very harsh policy toward that country while implementing a more
tolerant policy toward others. For example, France became the target for
Beijing when western countries criticized human rights abuses in Tibet
in 2008. In ASEAN, the Philippines became the target of Chinese
"punishment."

Again, [Japan and the U.S. should **share the vision** of a peaceful
order in the Asia-Pacific as well as a comprehensive China
strategy.]{.underline} Building a constructive relationship with China
and supporting its stable growth should be the basis of the China
strategy for the U.S. and Japan. However, this is all the more important
going into the future because China is an increasingly influential
power. As China seeks to become a responsible stakeholder, [the U.S. and
Japan should not be passive towards China\'s aggressive
behavior]{.underline}. [It is difficult to imagine that the existing
problems between China, the U.S., and Japan will be settled in the
immediate future]{.underline}. On the contrary, the [coming decade might
be the **most difficult** period for Japan-China and U.S.-China
relations]{.underline} since the end of World War II. [Both Japan and
the U.S. have to strengthen and expand cooperation, as well as be both
patient and prudent to achieve a peaceful transition to establish a

Impact on Japan and South Korea

[Thus far, **Japan** and **So**uth **Ko**rea have been spared the ire of
Trump **administration officials**]{.underline}, who mainly have
criticized European governments for various perceived offenses. But
[Seoul and Tokyo no doubt are **discomfited** by Trump's **intimations**
that he may not feel **bound** by long-standing U.S. security
guarantees]{.underline}. During the 2024 presidential campaign, for
instance, [Trump famously recounted a conversation with a foreign **head
of government** in which he said]{.underline} he "would not protect you.
In fact, [I would encourage \[**Russia**\] to do whatever the hell they
want]{.underline}. You gotta pay."8 In this regard, [Trump's abusive
**abandonment** of **Ukraine**]{.underline} could [spur additional
efforts to augment **security capabilities**, including consideration of
**nuc**lear weapon**s**, among U.S. Asian allies. South Koreans, in
particular, have long harbored fear about U.S. abandonment dating to the
1949 withdrawal of U.S. military personnel]{.underline}, followed
shortly thereafter by the North Korean invasion that catalyzed the
1950-1953 Korean War.

In Seoul, there has been growing interest in and public support for
nuclear weapons for over a decade, well before Trump was even a likely
political candidate. South Korean political conservatives are the most
vocal champions of a domestic nuclear weapons program, but Trump's
behavior may give progressives reason to reconsider their skepticism.
For now, there is a growing movement for nuclear "latency" (called the
Mugunghwa Forum), whereby South Korea would accumulate the additional
capabilities necessary for producing nuclear weapons should it decide to
build them in the future.9

Nuclear latency advocates are urging the South Korean government to
negotiate with the United States for permission to develop uranium
enrichment and plutonium reprocessing capabilities, first by upgrading
the existing South Korean-U.S. nuclear cooperation agreement. This is
highly likely to be a key item on Seoul's wish list as South Korean and
U.S. officials sort through alliance, security, and trade issues.

The [real wild card pertains to the Trump administration's
**intentions** regarding the U.S. defense posture and **extended
deterrence** commitments]{.underline}. If Trump seeks to withdraw U.S.
forces stationed on the Korean peninsula, then South Korean leaders
might feel forced to proceed with a nuclear weapons effort, despite the
challenges they would likely encounter.

Japan in many ways occupies a more difficult position: With a capable
but constrained self-defense force, it is more reliant on U.S. extended
deterrence despite its security and territorial issues with China, North
Korea, and Russia. Tokyo has fewer immediate options to remedy U.S.
retrenchment, apart from building nuclear weapons, which it likely could
achieve faster than South Korea but which would be far more politically
complicated given the strong Japanese pro-disarmament movement. Tokyo
seems likely to continue efforts to stay out of Trump's firing line and
not give him any reason to consider abandonment.

[As the implications of Trump's **shift** toward **Russia**]{.underline}
become clear, the [**potential effects** in Asia seem likely to boil
down to the issue of **linkage**]{.underline}. In the past, Russia has
proved willing to use its influence to further nonproliferation goals,
as it did during negotiations with Iran leading to the 2015 nuclear
agreement. However, if transactional politics dominate in the absence of
a broader Russian-U.S. strategic alignment, [**Moscow** will be less
willing to use its **influence** with China or North Korea in ways that
could **benefit** the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}.10 [At least,
not without extracting a **price**]{.underline}. [Whether that price
includes a **reduction** in the U.S. **defense posture** in Asia,
negotiated without the **input** of U.S. **allies**, will be a
**critical determinant** of the future number of nuclear-armed states in
the region]{.underline}.

#### The plan cements Japan's fears of Russia and contradicts past U.S-Japan co-op against Russia.

**TJT '24** \[The Japan Times; September 15; "Japan moves to promote
rule of law in Arctic,"

Title: [**Japan** moves to promote **rule of law** in
**Arctic**]{.underline}

The [**government** is aiming to enhance a **free** and open
international **order** based on the rule of law in the
**Arctic**]{.underline} --- where the [presence of **Russia** and China
is growing]{.underline} --- [to **secure opportunities** for developing
natural resources]{.underline} and expanding seaborne trade.

[To this end, the government is **redoubling** its **diplomatic
efforts** to strengthen **cooperation** with the **U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline} and Nordic countries.

In a recent interview, [Foreign Minister Yoko Kamikawa stressed that
Japan]{.underline} \"[will not allow (**Russia** and **China**) to set
exclusionary **navigation rules** that are inconsistent with the U.N.
Convention on the Law of the Sea or to use natural resources
dominantly]{.underline}.\"

With sea ice decreasing in the Arctic due to global warming, Russia,
which has the largest territory in the area, is strengthening military
activities there, which include foothold development while expanding
cargo transportation and exploring resources

China is moving forward with active investment in infrastructure under
the \"Ice Silk Road\" cooperation project with Russia, part of its Belt
and Road initiative.

Beijing and Moscow are also beefing up military collaboration, such as
joint patrols in the seas off Alaska.

In its 2024 Arctic Strategy released in July, the U.S. Defense
Department cautioned that the growing cooperation between [China and
Russia is a **potential factor** \"to alter the **Arctic\'s stability**
and threat picture]{.underline}\" and [recognized the importance of
enhancing security in the region \"by **deepening cooperation** with
**allies** and partners]{.underline}.\"

[To cope with the **changing situation** in the area, Japan, for its
part, has been trying to **solidify** its **relations** with Nordic
countries and other nations **concerned**]{.underline}.

#### Ukraine means [everyone is watching]{.underline}.

Sheila A. **Smith 22**, John E. Merow Senior Fellow for Asia-Pacific
Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, Ph.D. in Political Science
from Columbia University, "The United States, Japan, and Taiwan: What
Has Russia's Aggression Changed?", Asia Policy, Vol. 17, No. 2, April
2022, http://doi.org/10.1353/asp.2022.0029

Two dimensions of the Ukraine conflict could have a bearing on Japan's
assessment. First, [Putin's use of nuclear coercion raises **important
political questions** about U.S. thinking regarding controlling
escalation]{.underline}, both vertical and horizontal, during the war.
As Russian military action against Ukraine began, [Biden drew a clear
line between U.S. treaty allies that have a **codified promise that U.S.
military power, including nuclear weapons, will be used on their
behalf** and nontreaty allies]{.underline} that have received no such
commitment. Not only did this exclude U.S. direct military assistance,
but it also precluded a role for NATO. As the invasion proceeded,
however, and Ukrainians came under increasing fire, many in Europe and
the United States began to call for greater military aid for Ukraine.
When Poland offered to give its aging MiG fighters to Ukraine in return
for new F-16s from the United States, the Department of Defense rejected
that offer, stating that "the decision about whether to transfer
Polish-owned planes to Ukraine is ultimately one for the Polish
government."27 Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky has called for a
no-fly zone over Ukraine as negotiations over humanitarian corridors for
evacuating the country's southern cities failed to protect residents
trying to flee. Again, the Biden administration has stated that it would
not participate in air defenses as that would raise the specter of
direct conflict with Russia or an escalation to nuclear war. To be sure,
the United States is providing considerable military assistance to
Ukraine. On the same day that Zelensky spoke to the U.S. Congress, Biden
also announced \$1 billion in additional assistance to Ukraine's
defenses.28 The humanitarian crisis in Ukraine has created deep public
empathy and difficult politics for the Biden administration. The longer
the conflict lasts, the greater this political pressure could become.

[What kind of action will the **U**nited **S**tates take in the context
of war]{.underline}? [**U.S. allies in Asia are watching this
carefully**. The **U**nited **S**tates continues to respond to Putin's
intimation that he would escalate]{.underline} the conflict [should
NATO]{.underline} forces [become involved]{.underline}. Moscow seeks to
deter U.S. direct intervention in, and even material support for,
Ukraine, while Washington seeks to preempt any chance of conflict
between the two nuclear powers by refusing to engage. To be sure, [other
wars may have involved]{.underline} this kind of [signaling, but
**rarely has it been so public**, nor has one side so explicitly used
nuclear risk to achieve its own war aims]{.underline}. How the United
States can help Ukraine without giving Putin an opening for escalation
is surely a daily calculation for U.S. policy planners.

But it is also a conversation for and among U.S. allies. Those states
bordering Ukraine feel the pressure both to help sustain Zelensky and
his forces and to prepare in case Putin decides to take the war to NATO.
On March 15, the leaders of the Baltic States, NATO's newest members,
visited Kyiv to meet with the Ukrainian leader. Poland, as well as other
European Union states, is admitting fleeing Ukrainian civilians and
offering them housing and support. The Czech Republic has provided
Ukraine with tanks. Biden traveled to Brussels to reiterate the U.S.
commitment to NATO's defenses as well as to emphasize the global
consequences of Putin's aggression. In addition to stating "we are
united in our resolve to counter Russia's attempts to destroy the
foundations of international security and stability," the NATO leaders
called on "all states, including the People's Republic of China (PRC),
to uphold the international order including the principles of
sovereignty and territorial integrity, as enshrined in the UN Charter,
to abstain from supporting Russia's war effort in any way, and to
refrain from any action that helps Russia circumvent sanctions."29

[Japan]{.underline} has also [played a **visible role** in the
international response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}. A
G-7 leaders meeting was convened, which included Japanese prime minister
Fumio Kishida. And in a follow-on meeting of NATO foreign ministers,
[Japan was invited to join as a NATO "partner."]{.underline} Foreign
Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi also visited Poland to offer assistance for
Ukrainians fleeing the war. [Japan]{.underline} has [**worked hard** to
keep pace with European nations, sending material assistance to Ukraine,
providing a venue for Zelensky to speak to]{.underline} the Japanese
[parliament, offering aid to nations that border Ukraine, and admitting
Ukrainians who seek refuge]{.underline}. Kishida's framing of Japanese
cooperation with the United States and European nations has been clear
from the start: [Russia's invasion]{.underline} is a violation of the
rule of law and thus affects all nations. It [is a **systemic threat**
to the postwar order that Japan relies on]{.underline} for its own
security and prosperity. Japan's engagement thus is an investment in a
possible future scenario in the Indo-Pacific that would require a
coordinated and concerted response to the use of force to change the
status quo.

A final question is how public opinion would shape regional attitudes
toward Taiwan. Initial polling suggests that more people in the United
States support a direct role in responding should China invade Taiwan.30
There is no such clarity in Japanese polling, but public attitudes
toward China continue to reveal distrust and uneasiness.31
Interestingly, a recent poll taken in Australia revealed that despite
the fact that their government only recognizes one China diplomatically,
most Australians view Taiwan as an independent nation, and 67% said
Australia should "do something" if China were to invade.32

#### It demands [public demonstrations]{.underline} of our willingness to use nuclear weapons.

Sheila A. **Smith 22**, John E. Merow Senior Fellow for Asia-Pacific
Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, Ph.D. in Political Science
from Columbia University, "The United States, Japan, and Taiwan: What
Has Russia's Aggression Changed?", Asia Policy, Vol. 17, No. 2, April
2022, http://doi.org/10.1353/asp.2022.0029

Already several opportunities for deeper alliance consultations have
emerged. First, [the **U**nited **S**tates and Japan must examine their
assumptions about how the nuclear threat may shape a Taiwan crisis.
Consideration must be given not only to **warfighting doctrine** but to
the **political factors** that could shape government
decision-making]{.underline}. Even countries with Article 5 guarantees
of U.S. strategic protection could find themselves tested in
unprecedented ways during a major-power conflict. The immediate task at
hand is to assess whether the United States and Japan are prepared for a
regional crisis of that magnitude. To do that, [Tokyo and Washington
must]{.underline} also evaluate the **[balance]{.underline}** of
**[risk]{.underline}** in their own alliance. What costs would Japan
need to be prepared to bear? What costs would the United States be
willing to bear? If nothing else, [Russia's invasion of Ukraine realized
Europe's **worst nightmare**]{.underline}---the return of violent,
interstate conflict on a scale not seen since World War II. Imagining a
similar military conflagration in Asia would heighten memories of the
brutality of the mid-twentieth century. Like Putin's effort to conjure
up demons of the past, such as "denazification" of the Ukrainian
leadership, as a pretext for his invasion, war memories could be
mobilized to legitimize the use of force. Moreover, [leaning into the
reality that **nuc**lear weapon**s** must be considered as part of that
nightmare will ensure]{.underline} that [Washington and Tokyo develop a
**realistic assessment** of what could become necessary]{.underline}.

In Tokyo, [policy experts are publicly **ask**ing what this conflict
means for extended deterrence in Asia and calling for a]{.underline}
more [frank]{.underline} and [public discussion of the nuclear
risks]{.underline}.51 Should China seek to change the status quo by
force as Russia has done in Ukraine, U.S. strategic protection for Japan
codified in Article 5 of the bilateral treaty will be expected. China
will likely emphasize the risk to Japan of supporting U.S. operations in
any cross-strait conflict to weaken alliance unity. [Without **nuc**lear
weapon**s** of its own, Japan could]{.underline} begin to [see a need
for more **publicly transparent demonstrations of U.S. capabilities**
that would deter China]{.underline}. How a Taiwan scenario might affect
the United States' ability to simultaneously deter aggression against
Japan is not only of deep concern to Japan's own defense planners but of
even deeper concern to the Japanese public. [Disinformation, nuclear
coercion, and the continuing sensitivities to the legacy of war make for
a **combustible mix** in imagining great-power conflict in
Asia]{.underline}.

### Link---NWFZ 

#### NWFZs are unrealistic and spark abandonment fears

Studies Quarterly, Vol. 14, No. 4, pp. 122-151*, JSTOR, Winter 2020

[Even proponents of a Northeast Asia NWFZ describe its prospects in
restrained terms]{.underline}.116 The NWFZ project reflects a liberal
internationalism that has not taken root in the security policies of
Northeast Asia; "all the regional players prefer the realist
approach."117 [Continued missile testing by North Korea, and mixed
messages about Japanese and South Korean proliferation by the US
president, complicates the security calculations of regional
actors]{.underline}. In this environment, [it would be challenging to
actualize some of the components of a Northeast Asia NWFZ. The extended
nuclear deterrent]{.underline} of the United States [would have to be
withdrawn]{.underline} without **[stoking abandonment
anxieties]{.underline}** [on the part of its allies. And if Japan and
South Korea do formally commit to nonproliferation, they would be taking
a risk that China would then lose interest in pressuring North Korea to
relinquish its nuclear weapons]{.underline}.118 Like the proposed Middle
East and Arctic NWFZs, the possibilities for a regional NWFZ seem
closely tied to more general improvements in the regional security
environment.

#### [Perception Link]{.underline}---any signal of US Abandonment pushes allies to proliferate

U.S. [extended deterrence]{.underline} in the Asia Pacific has
historically aimed not only to [deter U.S. adversaries​,​ such as China
and the DPRK​,​ from engaging in conventional or nuclear attacks on U.S.
regional allies, but also to **disincentivize** allies from acquiring an
independent nuclear capability]{.underline}. The [potential for allied
nuclear armament has recently made headlines]{.underline}, with
[prominent politicians in the region **raising questions about the
continued credibility** of the U.S. nuclear umbrella]{.underline} ​​and,
in some cases, openly endorsing the need for an indigenous nuclear
weapons program.

How the U.S. should interpret and respond to these challenges was a
topic of discussion at the April 2025 "Strengthening Deterrence in the
Indo-Pacific" workshop, facilitated by the Center for Global Security
Research at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). This essay
analyzes the potential for allied armament in [South Korea and
**Japan**, including **drivers of regional proliferation**, the current
state of public and elite opinion in both countries, and how the United
States should respond]{.underline}. While this paper draws on insights
from the recent LLNL workshop, the opinions presented are the author's
own and do not represent any organization.

The Regional Deterrence Architecture and Drivers of Proliferation

The [U.S. deterrence architecture in the Asia Pacific is focused on
**bilateral** partnerships with key allies]{.underline} -- principally,
[Australia, Japan, and South Korea]{.underline}. [Maintaining a forward
U.S. presence is necessary to **signal a robust commitment to**
allies]{.underline},​​ force adversaries to engage the U.S. early in
conflict, and deny adversaries an outright advantage. The [existing
deterrence architecture is designed to convince ​​adversaries, including
China, the DPRK, and R​​ussia, that violence against allies will incur
costs that exceed benefits and risk greater war]{.underline}.

Increasingly, this [architecture has **come under strain**. Gaps in the
regional deterrence architecture, along with advances in adversaries'
conventional and nuclear capabilities, **threaten the credibility** of
the U.S. extended deterrent and ​​may, in turn, **increase allies'
incentives to proliferate**]{.underline}. The [United States must now
contend with the possibility of conflict with two nuclear
peers]{.underline}, China and Russia, with China expected to reach
nuclear parity with the U.S. by 2035. The possibility of simultaneous
engagement extends to the DPRK, which may initiate a crisis on the
Korean Peninsula as a distraction or leverage an ongoing regional
conflict to pursue its territorial aims. The increasing
political-military alignment between Russia and China, as well as Russia
and the DPRK, makes this problem more urgent.

Additionally, the U.S. nuclear foundation faces external stress due to
an increase in targets that must be held at risk, including hardened and
mobile targets, and the "tyranny of distance" in deploying nuclear
weapons from the U.S. to the region. The foundation is also under
internal stress as the entire strategic force undergoes modernization,
including nuclear command and control. These stressors may impact allied
perceptions of U.S. political and technical credibility, including
whether the U.S. will be able to successfully complete its modernization
program and deliver all necessary capabilities.

Recent [U.S. policy positions have also **elicited concern** from
regional allies]{.underline}. [Washington has pressured its regional
allies to take on more of the **burden for their defense**, including
linking defense cost-sharing to broader trade disputes]{.underline}. The
[Trump administration has previously floated the potential of removing
U.S. troops]{.underline} from the region if cost-sharing expectations
are not met. Additionally, shifting positions on the U.S. approach to
the DPRK have raised alarm with South Korean policymakers. Both
President Trump and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth have publicly
referred to North Korea as a "nuclear power," potentially legitimizing
the DPRK's nuclear weapons status. At his confirmation hearing, U.S.
Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Elbridge Colby further emphasized
the need to restructure U.S. Forces Korea to focus primarily on threats
posed by China rather than the DPRK.

As with [U.S. NATO allies, allies in the Asia Pacific are likely to
tolerate and, in some cases, embrace moderate pressure from the United
States to increase defense spending and burden sharing. However,
**stronger signals of U.S. abandonment**]{.underline}, such as the
removal of U.S. troops from the Korean peninsula or U.S. abandonment of
Taiwan, [are **likely to incentivize allied
proliferation**]{.underline}.

At a meeting of Japanese business leaders last week, two of us --
Americans with a longtime interest in US- Japan relations, spoke of
investment opportunities -- and security necessities -- for our
countries to strengthen cooperation in the Arctic, at the top of the
world.

[Alaska is the US **state closest** to Japan. Both]{.underline} our
[nations have improved "neighborly" relations with Russia in the
Arctic]{.underline}, but on larger, geopolitical issues, continued
[**wariness is justified**.]{.underline} [Russia is]{.underline}
upgrading its missiles and military bases in the Kurile Islands, and its
Arctic naval capability. North Korea continues its nuclear missile
program, [threatening both Japan and the U.S. **Networking** our sea and
shore based missile defenses in **East Asia** and the Pacific with the
**major missile defense installation** in **Alaska** strengthens our
**mutual deterrence**. U.S. **military** forces -- and **logistical
infrastructure** -- based in the Arctic are crucial to the **US-Japan
alliance.**]{.underline}

[The **Arctic Ocean** is becoming more accessible to navigation, and
that prompts the need for both **business** and **security
cooperation**. Just as Japanese]{.underline} investment over the last 60
years [helped develop **air routes**]{.underline} in the polar regions
to link Eurasia and North America[, investment in **maritime
infrastructure** is now **vital** to establish reliability on northern
sea short-cuts.]{.underline} Proposed [**Japanese icebreakers** and
ice-thickness observing satellites could play a **major role** in
bringing efficiencies to global shipping, and ultimately a **less
expensive route**]{.underline} for some cargo destinations [than the
Suez and Panama Canals.]{.underline}

Today, [the U.S. security guarantee looks less and less
reliable.]{.underline} This summer, President Donald [Trump repeatedly
called the security treaty unfair and reportedly mused in private about
canceling the treaty altogether]{.underline}. He has tolerated North
Korean missile tests that threaten Japan. And during his election
campaign, he suggested that it might even serve Japanese and South
Korean interests if both nations developed nuclear weapons. [There are
still powerful historical, cultural, and institutional reasons for Japan
to resist going nuclear, but Biegun is right to worry that the country
could head in that direction---though it is the U.S. president, as much
as North Korea, who may push Tokyo toward nuclear
proliferation]{.underline}.

### 2NC---Assurances Need To Be Certain

#### Assurances to the alliance need to be certain---plan would be seen as confusing or concerning

Nuclear Use in East Asia", *Journal for Peace and Nuclear Disarmament

The [assurance side]{.underline} of the equation [is perceptibly harder
than the deterrence side. Alliance extended assurance is and has been a
never-ending process]{.underline} in both Europe and Asia. Such is the
case when one country tries to convince others that it will place its
own security at risk for a far-away partner. Naturally, [US allies fear
that in their moment of need, a US president would fail to act. This
risk is inherent to extended deterrence relationships and not unique to
the current security challenges]{.underline}. Nevertheless, [the
challenge of alliance assurance has grown more acute as the traditional
bipartisan support for alliances]{.underline} in the United States [has
broken down amid a widening split]{.underline} within the Republican
Party on this issue. [This **loss** of consensus creates **instability**
and **confusion** at a time when allies **seek reliability and
certainty**]{.underline}. [Any lack of those elements has and is likely
to feed demand for more national capabilities, including independent
conventional and nuclear systems]{.underline}.

https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/Interview/Japan-cannot-maintain-security-at-current-capabilities-SDF-chief

Q: Still, there is not enough public support and understanding for
defense policy. A: I want the public to recognize the strategic
environment facing Japan. The international community is at a critical
juncture on whether it can prevent unilateral changes in the status quo
by force and maintain an international order based on the rule of law.
Japan is on the front lines of this fight in the Indo-Pacific. [[How the
Japanese people view]{.mark} the [SDF is **changing
dramatically**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Russia\'s invasion of [**Ukraine**
has lessons]{.mark}]{.underline} for us, too. [[Interest in]{.mark} our
[defense is **growing**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as [the [public
sees]{.mark} the [provocations by **No**]{.mark}rth **[Ko]{.mark}**rea
[and **China** firsthand]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Opinion]{.mark} [polls
show]{.mark} that many [people support]{.mark} an [**increase in defense
spending**, as well as]{.mark} Japan acquiring **[counterstrike
capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Q: What can we learn from what is happening in Ukraine? A: Russia
underestimated Ukraine\'s military capabilities and the resistance it
would face from Ukrainians. The fact that Ukraine was not part of NATO
contributed as well. We cannot rule out a similarly serious crisis
happening near Japan, and we are strongly concerned by this possibility.
There are two things Japan must do. First, we must fundamentally
strengthen our defensive capabilities so that we are not underestimated.
Second, we need to do what we can to sustain extended deterrence,
including through strategies involving U.S. nuclear weapons. Q: Given
North Korea\'s advances in its nuclear and missile technology, missile
defense alone does not seem to be enough to protect Japan. A:
Strengthening our missile defense on its own will not protect the lives
and property of our people. North Korea has gained advanced,
sophisticated capabilities, including missiles with irregular
trajectories that are difficult to intercept. There are three areas we
must address. We need to gain counterstrike capabilities so that we can
hit a target using missiles, and bolster our ability to intercept
attacks. We also need more underground shelters so that we can minimize
damage from a missile attack and protect our people. Q: Some critics say
there has not been enough explanation on how Japan would utilize
counterstrike capability. A: There hasn\'t been enough dialogue with the
public. We plan to provide a thorough explanation. But it is also
important that we do not show our hand. If we reveal operational details
to the public, we lose the ability to deter opponents from attacking.
**[Q:]{.underline}** [[Would the U.S. **defend Japan** in a
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}? A: [[We have]{.mark} been engaged in a
**[deep dialogue with the U.S]{.mark}**. since 2010 [on extended
deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline} \-- [extending the U.S. nuclear umbrella
over Japan]{.underline}. [[In late June, we agreed to]{.mark} **share
[more info]{.mark}rmation**, **[improve]{.mark} the quality** of our
[joint]{.mark} [exercises]{.mark}, and [bolster]{.mark} our **[missile
response]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [There have also been **detailed
conversations** between our foreign and defense ministers.]{.underline}

Q: During the Cold War, the SDF was said to need the ability to sustain
two weeks of fighting. Now, it is said to need three. A: I\'ll refrain
from commenting on how long the SDF can hold its own, since that\'s an
operational detail. Our National Security Strategy aims for Japan to be
able to take primary responsibility by fiscal 2027 for dealing with
invasions. [**Q:** Changing [global dynamics have transformed

WASHINGTON --- [The **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [has [approached **Japan**]{.mark} and

and other matters, according to sources.

[[With **No**]{.underline}]{.mark}rth **[[Ko]{.underline}]{.mark}**rea
[[accelerating]{.mark} its **[nuc]{.mark}**lear and missile development
[program]{.mark}]{.underline}, [the [body is]{.mark} aimed at

**nuc**]{.mark}lear [deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline} in a coordinated
manner.

The [**[Japan]{.mark}**ese government is]{.underline} considering
[[**accepting** the proposal]{.underline}]{.mark}, according to sources.
[**So**uth **Ko**rea is also]{.underline} believed to be [positive about
the idea.]{.underline}

[[Japan and the **U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [hold talks
on]{.mark}]{.underline} the [U.S. **[nuc]{.mark}**lear
[deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline} among foreign and defense officials at
the deputy director general level, [while the **U**nited **S**tates and
**So**uth **Ko**rea hold similar talks]{.underline} at the
vice-ministerial level.

[The [three-country consultative body will]{.mark} be an
**[upgrade]{.mark}** to the bilateral [frameworks]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}**[currently [in place]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It will be
[established [on a **permanent basis** to **deepen discussions**]{.mark}
[on]{.mark} **[nuc]{.mark}**lear deterrence [policy]{.mark} [and
**enhance**]{.mark}]{.underline} information sharing on [[U.S.]{.mark}
**[nuc]{.mark}**lear [capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Washington has proposed establishing a framework for nuclear
deterrence-related training]{.underline} during normal times [and a
mechanism to]{.underline} determine how to [respond in an emergency
based on consultations]{.underline} with Tokyo and Seoul. Who will
participate in the body and what specific themes will be tackled are yet
to be determined. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization's
ministerial-level Nuclear Planning Group was established in 1966 during
the Cold War to discuss nuclear deterrence. Washington intends to
consult with Tokyo and Seoul [based on the NATO framework.]{.underline}

U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense Ely Ratner said in a speech on March
2, "We're in discussions now about ... new consultative mechanisms ...
to better understand our strategic operations and planning and
thinking," regarding nuclear deterrence against North Korea.

There are growing concerns in Japan and South Korea about the
reliability of the U.S. nuclear umbrella, amid North Korean threats of
short-range tactical nuclear weapons. [[Washington]{.mark} has [decided
it is **necessary** to establish]{.mark} a **new consultative
[body]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} [demonstrate]{.mark} its **[firm
stance]{.mark}** regarding extended deterrence [to defend its]{.mark}
two [allies]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The [**[Japan]{.mark}**ese government [is **positively
assessing**]{.mark} the [proposal]{.mark}]{.underline} on the
understanding [[that it will]{.mark} **[strengthen nuc]{.mark}lear
[deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is also closely watching the
situation regarding lawsuits linked to requisitioned workers from the
Korean Peninsula, which has been the biggest issue between Tokyo and
Seoul.

Following the South Korean government's announcement of a resolution
plan on Monday, [[Tokyo]{.mark} [thinks]{.mark} the [environment

None of these first three options is a game changer, and they might be
better imagined as "Plans A.2.0--4.0." 16 The same [shifting balance of
power that stirs Japanese doubt of Washington's]{.underline} security
[commitment]{.underline} also [undercuts]{.underline} Tokyo's [prospects
for autonomous defense]{.underline}. **[The gap]{.underline}** in
conventional capabilities **[is]{.underline}** simply **[too large to
fill,]{.underline}** either by indigenous capabilities or alliance with
lesser powers. [**Enter the nuc**lear **option.**]{.underline}

For decades, Japanese [strategists]{.underline} almost unanimously
[averred that as long as US extended deterrence remained
credible]{.underline}, [**nuc**lear breakout would not be in Japan's
interest]{.underline}.17 While **[this has been]{.underline}** regularly
**[reaffirmed]{.underline}**, [some]{.underline} mainstream strategists
today [interrogate the **cred**ibility of extended
deterrence]{.underline}. In 2018, for example, former Defense Minister
Ishiba Shigeru---a longtime advocate of Japan's nuclear
latency---suggested "the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence ... has
to be scrutinized." 18 He [publicly advocated amending
Japan's]{.underline} longstanding [prohibition on building, deploying,
or allowing]{.underline} the introduction of [**nuc**lear
weapon**s**]{.underline}, [known as Japan's three **nonnuc**lear
principles]{.underline}.19 Meanwhile, researchers at the Security
Strategy Research Institute of Japan with connections to **[Japan's
defense establishment argued]{.underline}** that "**[if
the]{.underline}** relative [**position of the U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline} [**produces doubts about extended deterrence,
another option would be to leave the NPT and become a nuc**lear weapons
**state**]{.underline} ... \[[W\]e would]{.underline} probably [gain the
understanding and support of]{.underline} most [other
countries]{.underline}." 20 In that case, they insist, the best model
would be Britain, which, unlike France, integrated its war planning with
the United States, but unlike Germany, maintained full control over
actual use.

[The government understands]{.underline} that [**nuc**lear breakout
would not be warmly received by the]{.underline} Japanese
[public]{.underline}, and it focuses on enhancing extended nuclear
deterrence, the so-called US "nuclear umbrella." 21 [To
prevent]{.underline} the [weakening]{.underline} of [extended
deterrence, **Japan**ese officials]{.underline} have [lobbied
against]{.underline} a US declaration of [**n**o **f**irst **u**se,
**discourage**d]{.underline} the United States from acknowledging
[mutual vulnerability with China, and pushed Washington to maintain
robust]{.underline} tactical nuclear weapons
[capabilities]{.underline}.22 Meanwhile, the Japanese [**public's
aversion to nuc**lear weapon**s has diminished**]{.underline}, though
these weapons are still unpopular. A 2017 survey indicated that 12
percent of Japanese citizens favored nuclear armament in the event that
North Korea does not surrender its own programs, up from 7 percent the
preceding year.23 In November 2017, a special collection of articles on
Japan's nuclear future was published in Chūō Kōron, one of Japan's most
prominent monthlies, and earlier that year, the former Japanese
Ambassador to the United States, Katō Ryōzō, argued that a [robust
reexamination of Japan's]{.underline} three [**non-nuc**lear principles
was necessary]{.underline}.24 **[What once was taboo]{.underline}** now
**[has a conspicuous presence in Japan's security
discourse.]{.underline}**

#### Tech is [already there]{.underline} and the aff generates [public support]{.underline}.

Relations at the Institute of International Relations at the University

[Even though]{.underline} the [reprocessing of plutonium is not
necessarily the same as]{.underline} the processing of nuclear fuel for
[military purposes]{.underline}, it should be noted that "the
[**Japan**ese]{.underline} **[government]{.underline}** also
[felt]{.underline} that [it made sense to **retain**]{.underline} at
least a [**latent capability to exercise the nuc**lear
**option**]{.underline}" (Mochizuki 2007, 311). In 1969, a document from
the Ministry of Foreign Relations in Japan declared that "for the time
being Japan's policy is not to have nuclear weapons, but we will always
retain the economic and technical potential to manufacture nuclear
weapons" (Oguma 2012).

In a pragmatic spirit, the Japanese [political authorities
never]{.underline} definitively [renounced the]{.underline} nuclear
[option, considering the possibility of a failure in the North American
nuclear umbrella]{.underline}. On the contrary, it discreetly maintained
all technological possibilities open (Shimin 1997, 707). Even though the
recent strategic changes in the East Asia have pressed Japan "to enlarge
its conventional forces and to add nuclear ones to protect its
interests" (Waltz 2000, 34), it is impossible to affirm that Japan will
adopt a nuclear option. Yet, "it may have weakened the taboo in Japan to
discuss publicly the nuclear weapons option" (Mochizuki 2007, 322) and
**[reinforced the Japanese]{.underline}** [**perception that "nuc**lear
weapon**s are**]{.underline}, after all, **[the ultimate trump
card]{.underline}**: if you can convince your enemy that you have a way
to play the card and are actually prepared to go through with it,
**[nothing is more powerful]{.underline}**" (Colby 2018, 29).

[In the **tech**nological field, **Japan has gone through all of the
important stages in order to obtain nuclear military
capacity**]{.underline}, with only a nuclear test not yet having been
conducted. Yet, [this]{.underline} does not [represent]{.underline} any
turnaround, but merely [a precautionary principle]{.underline}. As it
possesses launchers which permit it to send satellites in orbit, it is
thus also clear that Japan retains the means for launching a nuclear
device (Paris 2016, 5).

Underlining how only few have noticed that Japan also has become a space
power, Grunden (2012, 949) pinpoints that it possesses the technical
capacity and furthermore has positioned its national security as a
fundamental element in the country's strategy for spatial development,
"The [dual-use nature of]{.underline} some [space
**tech**nologies]{.underline} - such as launch vehicles and satellites -
[allowed Japan to make the rapid adaptation from commercial to military
applications]{.underline}."

With the creation of the National Space Development Agency in 1969,
Japan launched its first satellite in 1970, and in the beginning of
1990, it already possessed nuclear technology with potential military
uses. "Some analysts think that Japan can be considered as a
proto-nuclear power, technologically ready to become a nuclear power if
necessary" (Coulmy 1991, 225 apudShimizu-Niquet 1994, 167-168).

With point of departure in the knowledge that North Korea can hit
American territory, Kausikan (2018, 34) questions whether the U.S. would
sacrifice San Francisco in order to save Tokyo. In the author's view,
[Japan has the capacity to quickly develop an independent nuclear
dissuasion, preparing itself for this eventuality]{.underline} for a
long period of time, "[with American acquiescence]{.underline} and
perhaps assistance - for decades." Yet, Yoshihari & Holmes (2009, 75),
in spite of recognizing Japan's strong potential to become nuclear,
consider it to be highly unlikely that Tokyo would seek to maintain an
independent nuclear arsenal in the near future. Not least considering
the absence of intentions, at least in the short term, to break the
Japan-U.S. Alliance, as well as the negative reactions in North East
Asia. Even if this might be an unlikely situation, and even with the
expansion of the North Korean nuclear threat, [Japan appears to be
conscious that an autonomous nuclear option could
exacerbate]{.underline} the North Korean and Chinese [security
dilemmas]{.underline}, as well as the dilemma related to the U.S.
abandonment, which would weaken its security guarantee as a consequence
of the destabilizing effects on regional security (Hughes 2007b, 90).

In an innovative approach, **[it becomes evident that
Japan]{.underline}**, in spite of the Fukushima disaster, [**will
maintain its nuc**lear **development in accordance with the
techno-nationalist ideology**]{.underline} which is **[profoundly rooted
in Japanese society]{.underline}**. From the Meiji Revolution, its
principle of "rich nation, strong army," the radical and militarist
nationalism, and towards the defeat by a technically more advanced
enemy, for [Japan the development of **nuc**lear energy has been "a
prime example of the high-technology, high-value-added export-oriented
industry so important to the continued success of a mature economy such
as Japan's]{.underline}" (Kelly 2015, 48).

Furthermore, [Japan's leaders]{.underline} [have]{.underline}
periodically [kept]{.underline} the [fact of]{.underline} the [nuclear
hedge **publicly salient**]{.underline}. In 2002, then deputy chief
cabinet secretary and future prime minister Shinzo Abe said in an
interview to Asahi Shimbun that "the [**Japanese government's official
position** is]{.underline} that the [possession of nuclear weapons is
not]{.underline} necessarily **[forbidden by the
constitution]{.underline}** if they are small, of tactical nature and
being kept to a minimum size," though he then reiterated Japan's
commitment to not possessing nuclear weapons at the moment, [performing
the]{.underline} **[now-perfected hedging pirouette]{.underline}**.92
Even after the horrific events of the Fukushima nuclear crisis, Ishiba
Shigeru, a former Japan Defense Agency chief, stated: "I don't think
Japan needs to possess nuclear weapons, but it is important to maintain
our commercial reactors because it would allow us to produce a nuclear
warhead in a short amount of time. It is a tacit nuclear deterrent."93
He later stated in 2012 that "it would be possible to create nuclear
weapons in the relatively short time of several months to a year."94

[Japan]{.underline}, like India before it, [has]{.underline}
**[carefully laid]{.underline}** the [foundation for
transitioning]{.underline} from a peaceful nuclear program
[to]{.underline} the [development of nuclear weapons]{.underline} if
necessary. In 1968, Basic Studies had estimated Japan's "breakout" time
to be five to six years. By 2012, those responsible for managing Japan's
nuclear hedge, such as Ishiba (after leaving office), had [publicly
reduced]{.underline} that **[breakout time]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline} [under a year]{.underline}, possibly even [several
months]{.underline}, though estimating the exact time frame is fraught
with uncertainties. A sitting defense minister, Satoshi Morimoto, stated
that Japan's nuclear energy program was the foundation for Japan's
"latent deterrent" and that it must be maintained.95 While
[Japan]{.underline} has publicly continued to forswear nuclear weapons
--- for now --- and consistently highlighted public opposition to
nuclear weapons, its [leaders have]{.underline} [**carefully emplaced**
Japan as a **threshold nuclear state** as a **conscious strategic
choice**]{.underline} as early as the mid-1950s.

[Contrary to]{.underline} conventional wisdom that points to the
[bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]{.underline}, and the **[postwar
constitution]{.underline}**, notably [**A**rticle **9**]{.underline},
[banning offensive **military capabilities**]{.underline}, to
[suggest]{.underline} that [Japan]{.underline} is [allergic to
nuclearization]{.underline}, [Japan]{.underline} has [**in fact
carefully crafted** a nuclear hedging strategy]{.underline} has [put all
the **technological pieces** in place to exercise]{.underline} a
[nuclear weapons option should it ever decide to do so]{.underline}. As
early as 1957, Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi's cabinet not only
[declared]{.underline} that the [possession of nuclear
weapons]{.underline} for defensive purposes --- specifically tactical
nuclear weapons --- would be [consistent with **A**rticle **9** of the
Japanese constitution]{.underline}, but the prime minister went so far
as to tell U.S. ambassador Douglas MacArthur II that he "believed it was
essential that Japan have (a) nuclear" weapons arsenal, even though
Japanese leaders were only exploring the idea at the time.78 His
successor, Prime Minister Ikeda, made similar remarks in private.79 In
December 1964, several months after the first Chinese nuclear test,
Prime Minister Sato told U.S. ambassador Edwin Reischauer that "if other
fellow nations had nuclears \[sic\] \[weapons\] it was only common sense
to have them oneself."80 He repeated this to President Johnson directly
several weeks later in January 1965, stating to him that "if the Chicoms
had nuclear weapons, the Japanese should also have them."81 Even as the
[NPT]{.underline} was being negotiated between 1968 and 1970, [**Japan's
signature** and ratification were not a **foregone
conclusion**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} Vice Foreign Minister
Shimoda, according to Daitoku, "[insisted]{.underline} that
[Japan]{.underline} should '**[reserve the option]{.underline}**' [of
going nuclear **even in case of acceding to the NPT**]{.underline}."82
Publicly, Prime Minister Sato declared the [Three Non-nuclear
Principles]{.underline} in 1967 while two years later [privately
referring to them as]{.underline} "**[nonsense]{.underline}**" to U.S.
ambassador U. Alexis Johnson.83 In 1970, a Japanese Defense Agency White
Paper, commissioned by its then director and future prime minister
Yasuhiro Nakasone, stated: "as for defensive nuclear weapons, [it would
be possible in]{.underline} a [**legal sense** to possess]{.underline}
small-yield, tactical, purely defensive [nuclear weapons without
violating the Constitution]{.underline}."84 Over the course of a little
over a decade, [Japanese leaders]{.underline} had
[rationalized]{.underline} the [potential possession of not only
strategic nuclear weapons for defense]{.underline} if necessary [but
**t**actical **n**uclear **w**eapons]{.underline} as well
[which]{.underline}, if ever developed, could [**obviously support**
both defensive and offensive strategies]{.underline}.

Figure 3 and Table 3 show the percentage of respondents who approved of
Japan's acquisition of nuclear weapons across each of the eight
treatment groups, along with the associated 95 percent confidence
intervals. What is noticeable is that, across all the groups in our
experiment, Japanese support for the acquisition of nuclear weapons
never exceeds 33 percent. This would suggest that [the Japanese
do]{.underline} indeed [exhibit a **substantial aversion** toward
**nuc**lear weapon**s**]{.underline}.11

Although these results are indicative of a widespread nuclear aversion
in Japan, [other findings suggest]{.underline} that [this aversion is
**not immutable** or unconditional and]{.underline} thus [may not
constitute a deeply engrained Japanese socio-cultural norm]{.underline}.
Among those who received the SQ treatment, 21 percent of the respondents
supported Japan's acquisition of nuclear weapons; among those who
received the worst-case treatment, the level of support reached 28
percent, an increase over the SQ treatment of seven percentage points
(p-value = 0.09). This finding would appear to press in the direction of
being in accord with Hypothesis 2, and less so with Hypothesis 1. [Our
inference]{.underline} from the finding [is that, for many Japanese, the
acquisition of nuclear weapons is **not unthinkable**, rather it is an
option that a certain number of Japanese **are ready to support** if the
country faces a deteriorating security situation]{.underline}.

However, when we seek to assess the specific sources of variation in the
impact on Japanese nuclear views of the six forms of deterioration in
external-security environments, we obtain ambiguous results. In
particular, we could not determine statistically which among the six
treatment-patterns encapsulating different security environments had the
greatest impact on Japanese respondents. On the one hand, t-tests of
difference between the worst-case treatment and the SQ treatment group
exhibit a moderately statistically discernible difference. However,
contrary to our expectation in Hypothesis 3 that Japanese support for
the acquisition of nuclear weapons would be highest when all three
security dimensions deteriorate, in the current experiment we did not
observe statistically differences across the treatment groups. This
result suggests that there might be very little interactive or
cumulative impacts on Japanese nuclear views that arise from being
exposed to multiple security concerns

We do note, however, that an enhanced threat perception regarding North
Korea by itself helped boost public support for the possible acquisition
of nuclear weapons. A comparison between the SQ treatment and the NK
treatment exhibits a significant impact of high nuclear threat from
North Korea ( p-value = 0.07). Similar comparisons between the SQ
treatment and other two dimensions, the US alliance commitment and South
Korea's nuclear ambition, did not produce meaningful differences.12

Particularly surprising are the responses from those members of our
Japanese sample who were primed about the nuclear attacks against
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In marked contrast to our expectation that their
support should be the lowest because of social-desirability bias, those
respondents actually expressed the highest average level of support for
the acquisition of nuclear weapons compared to the six security-context
treatments. How can we explain this unexpected result? One possible
explanation can be found in the "reactance" literature in political
psychology. Reactance is "an unpleasant motivational arousal that
emerges when people experience a threat to or loss of their free
behaviors" (Steindl et al. 2015, 205). Further, Steindl et al. (2015,
209--210) argue that when attempts are made to persuade people by using
a forceful message, this message motivates people to present arguments
against the persuasive attempt. Applying the idea of reactance to our
experiment, it is possible that some respondents might have understood
the Hiroshima-Nagasaki remainder as a forceful message that restricts
Japan's freedom of choice as a means of national defense. Consequently,
the reminder might have elicited markedly negative attitudes toward the
priming message, which in turn triggered an intention to behave contrary
to the message.13

[We]{.underline} next [turn to support expressed by respondents **for
the use of nuc**lear weapon**s by the U**nited **S**tates **in defense
of Japan**]{.underline}. Figure 4 [**provide**s **strong support** for
the expectation that Japanese nuclear aversion is **relatively weak with
respect to the US use of nuclear weapons** if doing so is intended to
defend Japan. Respondents provide higher support scores for the US
deployment of nuclear missiles in Guam to defend Japan compared
to]{.underline} their support for [Japan's acquisition of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. In the worst-case treatment, 43 percent of
respondents supported such deployment by the United States. This result
is [consistent with the argument regarding a possible "**nuclear
duality" in Japan**, referring to the possession on the part of many
Japanese of an anti-nuclear position for Japan itself in combination
with **confidence in extended deterrence provided by the U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline} (Hoey 2016, 486).

"So long as nuclear weapons exist and are perceived to be a valuable
security and political tool, states will continue to seek them. Possible
nuclear aspirants in the future do not just include American adversaries
such as Iran and Syria but also 'friends' such as Saudi Arabia.
[[Even]{.mark} formal U.S. allies such as]{.underline}
**[[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark}**, South Korea, Turkey, and even Germany
[[may]{.mark} one]{.underline} **[day [disrupt]{.mark} the East
Asian]{.underline}** and European [[security]{.mark} architectures [by
deciding]{.mark} that an]{.underline} **[[independent nuclear
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}** [capability [is]{.mark}
[preferable]{.mark} to depending on Washington's security
commitments]{.underline}."\[55\] In Narang's analysis, a potential
nuclear aspirant's four main options are hiding, sheltered pursuit,
hedging, and sprinting.\[56\] "[He[d]{.mark}ging]{.underline}
[is]{.underline} a strategy to develop a bomb option," Narang explains,
"[**laying the** groundwork for weaponization in the future]{.underline}
[under some **set of strategic conditions**]{.underline}."\[57\] Hedging
may be subdivided into the minimalist category of technical hedging and
two progressively more robust categories: "insurance hedging" and "hard
hedging." [[Insurance hedging]{.underline}]{.mark}, Narang explains,
"[[involves]{.underline} [steps to **reduce**]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[the [time to]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[the bomb]{.mark} should a state
need to develop nuclear weapons]{.underline} (for example, if a security
threat intensifies or if the hedger is abandoned by an ally)."\[58\]
Hard hedgers, by contrast, "attempt to become threshold nuclear states
with many of the pieces in place for a functional nuclear weapons
program. They have potentially intense demand for nuclear weapons but
intentionally stop short of the finish line."\[59\] In sum,
"[[Hedgers]{.mark} **are not failed proliferators**]{.underline}, [they
[are]{.mark} simply]{.underline} [**[warming up]{.mark}** and deciding
whether they will eventually **run the race."\[**]{.underline}60\]
Adding to uncertainty and concern, Narang cautions, "Categorizing types
of hedgers in real time may be difficult because the activities that
distinguish hard hedging from insurance hedging, for example, consist of
technical work and deliberation that is likely done in secret. In
practice, most external observers may assume that anything resembling
technical hedging could very well be hard hedging."\[61\] This means, in
practice, that even if the U.S. government could detect the difference,
other regional governments and societies might assume the worst
regardless. Sprinting, an openly acknowledged effort to "develop a
nuclear weapons capability as quickly as possible," almost always
involves attempted "tactical obfuscation."\[62\] Importantly, Narang
emphasizes, "[[if a state directs]{.mark} the [necessary resources to a
nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline} effort and is immune from economic
or military preventative action, [its]{.underline}
[**[prospects]{.underline}** [for achieving its goals are]{.underline}
**[very high]{.underline}**]{.mark}."\[63\] Indeed, "[**contrary** to
the]{.underline} [conventional wisdom that successful nuclear
proliferation is rare,]{.underline} **[[over half]{.underline}]{.mark}**
--- **[ten of nineteen]{.underline}** --- [[of the active
proliferators]{.mark} **[succeeded]{.mark}** in developing nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. Within active proliferators, **[[sprinters]{.mark}
\... [have never failed]{.mark}]{.underline}** to get the bomb."\[64\]
Applying Narang's framework to American allies and partners in East
Asia, Taiwan pursued insurance hedging from 1967-74 and then a hidden
nuclear program from 1974-88, but it ultimately failed to keep its
program concealed. Under intense pressure from Washington, it abandoned
its program following the defection of Chang Hsien-Yi, deputy director
of Taiwan's Institute of Nuclear Energy Research, to the United States
in 1988.\[65\] If not for Chang's defection, Narang argues, "it is
entirely possible that Taiwan would have succeeded in building nuclear
weapons through a hiding strategy."\[66\] [[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[is]{.mark} currently hedging]{.underline}**,\[67\] specifically [as
"[the **quintessential**]{.mark} **insurance
[hedger]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the international system"\[68\] from
1954 to the present.\[69\] But it is also a potential sprinter.\[70\]
Narang emphasizes, "The quintessential example of nuclear hedging where
a pursuer faces an acute security threat but benefits from a formal
alliance is Japan. [[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [uses the
**implicit threat**]{.underline} [of nuclear breakout with its insurance
hedge to elicit **stronger commitments**]{.underline} from the United
States, [but also to [**put the pieces in place** for an
independent]{.mark} nuclear [deterrent **should it ever face
abandonment**]{.mark}]{.underline}\[71\] ... or if the severity of its
underlying threats increases to the point that the alliance with the
United States no longer meets its security needs."\[72\] Specifically,
[[Japan's]{.mark} putting the [technical pieces]{.mark} in
place]{.underline} "[[comprises]{.underline} **[a very
real]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[,]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[potentially [swift,]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[pathway to]{.mark} a
[nuclear weapons]{.mark} arsenal [in the event]{.mark} of]{.underline}
**[a rapid deterioration]{.underline}** [of Japan's security
environment]{.underline}, either because its underlying threats \...
become unbearably menacing or [because [the U.S]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
[alliance is]{.underline} **[insufficient]{.underline}**]{.mark} [to
meet Japan's security needs]{.underline} (or both)."\[73\] Such
potential changes are not simply theoretical in nature: "Any time there
has been a perturbation in the external security environment that causes
Japan to question America's extended deterrent, Japanese leaders ---
across all parties --- have not so subtly mentioned the threat to go
nuclear if American security guarantees are deemed insufficient to
Tokyo," Narang writes.\[74\] After pursuing secret nuclear weapons
efforts from 1970-74, when it feared American abandonment,\[75\] South
Korea has subsequently pursued insurance hedging.\[76\] While South
Korea lacks Japan's plutonium reprocessing ability, it has much stronger
popular support for nuclear weapons.\[77\] "Historically, some 60-70
percent of the South Korean public supports possessing independent
nuclear weapons," Narang notes, "which is remarkably high compared to
most states.\[78\] "In many ways, South Korea may be more willing to
pursue an active weaponization strategy if it continues to fear
abandonment and with such high levels of public support for nuclear
weapons," he concludes.\[79\] [N[ot all states]{.underline}]{.mark}
[would [have]{.mark} the **[economic]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,
**[industrial]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**[technological]{.underline}** [capacity]{.underline}]{.mark} [to take
the nuclear road, [but]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[Japan]{.underline}**]{.mark} and South Korea [[clearly
would]{.underline}]{.mark}. We accordingly offer a summary of each
country's nuclear weapons acquisition potential, as well as a brief
assessment of the risks for conflict that could be sparked by a Japanese
or South Korean decision to approach or cross the weaponization
threshold.

As the only country to experience a nuclear bombing, Japan is a leading
proponent of nonproliferation. [Quietly]{.underline}, however, [it
pursues a strategy of "nuclear hedging," preserving the capacity to
develop nuclear weapons without intending to do so]{.underline}.
Officials occasionally reveal the existence of this policy. In the wake
of the Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, for example, former Defense
Minister Shigeru [Ishiba]{.underline}, a prominent Liberal Democratic
Party politician, [explained]{.underline} [that Japan couldn't shut down
its nuclear power plants because the nuclear fuel cycle---the industrial
processes that turn uranium into electricity and recycle the
waste]{.underline}---[was necessary in order to maintain "technical
deterrence.]{.underline}" [Japan is the only nation that has the
**ability to enrich uranium and reprocess plutonium** but has no nuclear
weapons]{.underline}.

In theory[, Japan could develop a small atomic arsenal in **as little as
a year or two.** It would need to produce weapons-grade plutonium, a
process that would most likely require repurposing civil
reactors]{.underline}. It would also need to reengineer its advanced
space launch rockets to deliver nuclear warheads. [Japanese scientists
are technically capable of both tasks and could accomplish them on a
tight timetable if the government felt compelled to minimize concerns
about safety, secrecy, reliability, and accuracy]{.underline} (and shirk
its international obligations). [A more thorough, careful process in
keeping with Japan's usual modus operandi would take three or four
years. Scientists would face another hurdle in finding a place to test
weapons in the crowded Japanese archipelago]{.underline}. The most
recent known government study, conducted in 2006, concluded that Japan
had the technical expertise and facilities to develop a small nuclear
warhead but that doing so would take three to five years and cost over
\$2 billion.

#### Japan could make [6000 bombs]{.underline} with existing stockpiles.

Mari **Yamaguchi 20**, journalist covering nuclear issues, politics,
defense, and human rights for the Associated Press, "Japan Sticks to
Nuclear Fuel Recycling Plan Despite Plutonium Stockpile," The Diplomat,
10-21-2020,
https://thediplomat.com/2020/10/japan-sticks-to-nuclear-fuel-recycling-plan-despite-plutonium-stockpile/

[**Japan**'s government]{.underline} said Wednesday it [will pursue a
**nuc**lear fuel recycling program that would involve extracting
plutonium]{.underline} from spent fuel, [despite international
concerns]{.underline} about the country's already huge plutonium
stockpile and lack of prospects for effectively consuming it as nuclear
fuel.

Chief Cabinet Secretary Kato Katsunobu, at a meeting with the governor
of Aomori prefecture, home to Japan's pending nuclear fuel reprocessing
plant, reaffirmed that new Prime Minister Suga Yoshihide's government
will pursue the country's nuclear energy policy.

"The government will firmly promote our nuclear energy policy and fuel
cycle programs," Kato said. He said Japan will make effort to reduce
volume and toxicity of high-level nuclear waste, and extract plutonium
from spent fuel from a resource conservation point of view.

But critics say **[continuation of spent fuel
reprocessing]{.underline}** only **[adds to Japan's already large
plutonium stockpile]{.underline}**. Japan also lacks a final repository
for high-level nuclear waste.

Wednesday's meeting came after the Nuclear Regulation Authority granted
a safety approval this past summer for the Rokkasho fuel reprocessing
plant, operated by Japan Nuclear Fuel Ltd., located in northern Japan,
for a planned launch in 2022. The authority also gave a preliminary
permit for the Rokkasho MOX fuel production plant, also planned for
completion in 2022.

[Japan]{.underline} now has [45.5 tons of separated
plutonium]{.underline} --- 8.9 tons at home, and 36.6 tons in Britain
and France, where spent fuel from Japanese nuclear plants has been
reprocessed and stored because Japan lacks a plant to produce MOX fuel
containing plutonium at home. **[The amount is enough to make about
6,000 atomic bombs.]{.underline}**

Despite security concerns raised by Washington and others, the
[stockpile is hardly decreasing due to difficulties in achieving a full
nuclear fuel recycling program and slow restarts of
reactors]{.underline} amid setbacks from the 2011 Fukushima disaster.

Japan reprocesses spent fuel, instead of disposing it as waste, to
extract plutonium and uranium to make MOX fuel for reuse, while the U.S.
discontinued the costly and challenging program. [Allowed under
international safeguard rules,]{.underline} [**Japan is the only
non-nuclear weapons state that separates plutonium for peaceful
purposes, though the same tech**nology **can make atomic
bombs.**]{.underline}

Japan has pledged not to possess excess plutonium and to put a cap on
the amount of extraction from spent fuel. The Rokkasho plant operator
rules out any proliferation risks, citing tight safeguards and close
monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency.

At least three conclusions can be derived from the discussion above.
First, [even in the Japanese case, where we]{.underline} might [expect
to see]{.underline} not just [a robust]{.underline} but an immutable
[aversion toward the acquisition of **nuc**]{.underline}lear
[weapons]{.underline}, [**[movement]{.mark} from the status-quo** [to
a]{.mark} highly [unfavorable new]{.mark} hypothetical
external-[security scenario]{.mark} [is associated with a]{.mark}
[**significant increase** in **Japanese public support** for
**nuc**]{.mark}lear **[weapons]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[This]{.mark}
observed [shift]{.mark}]{.underline}, from roughly 21 percent to 28
percent support, by itself augurs no change in Japan's current policy on
nuclear weapons. But it [[does **by**]{.mark} [**itself** raise the
possibility]{.mark} that [Japan's nuclear aversion]{.mark}]{.underline},
while currently robust and probably deeply engrained, [[should **not
be** ]{.mark}**viewed as [immutable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Instead, [as
reported by astute observers such as **[Berger]{.mark} (1993)**,
**[Miyashita]{.mark} (2007),** [and **Machida**]{.mark}
**(2018)**,]{.underline} [we [find]{.mark} [using]{.mark} an original
[survey]{.mark} [experiment]{.mark} [that]{.mark} [Japan's]{.mark}
societal [aversion]{.mark} to nuclear weapons [is]{.mark} likely to be
**closely [related]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} the [threats Japan
faces]{.mark}]{.underline} from abroad [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[**perceived [robustness]{.mark} [of its military alliance
]{.mark}**with the **U**nited **S**tates.]{.underline}

#### Anti-nuclear norms in Japan are [determined by]{.underline} the strength of the [U.S.]{.underline} nuclear umbrella. The link extends [beyond]{.underline} elite circles to [broad]{.underline} societal sentiment.

[Previous studies have widely documented that Japan possesses "peaceful
cultural norms" that critically limit Japan's foreign
policy]{.underline} (Katzenstein, 1996). [In explaining Japan's passive
stance]{.underline} in the security issues, [constructivist scholars
have relied on the presence of cultural norms that are embedded in
Japanese society]{.underline} (Berger, 1993, 1998; Katzenstein, 1996).
Recognizing the uniqueness of Japanese culture in this field, scholars
have attempted to explore the origin of the peaceful norms in Japan.
Emphasizing the importance of the structural and material factors,
Miyashita (2007) contends thmat [[the **U**]{.mark}nited [**S**tates
has]{.mark} **played [essential roles]{.mark}** [in establishing]{.mark}
the peaceful [culture in]{.mark} [Japan]{.mark}]{.underline}. Building
upon these insights, the main goal of this study has been to further
explore the nature of the peaceful norms among the Japanese public. The
present research has examined how [**confidence in the U.S. nuclear
umbrella** among the Japanese public **shapes its attitudes** toward
Japan's nuclear armament]{.underline}. Taking advantage of the setting
in which Donald Trump explicitly presented the idea of withdrawing the
US troops from Japan, I have analyzed how [the [**loss of
confidence**]{.mark} in the U.S. **nuc**lear umbrella among Japanese
citizens [can]{.mark} **[undermine]{.mark} their [commitment]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} the **[anti-nuc]{.mark}**lear [norms]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The [result of the [statistical analyses]{.mark} **relying on the
original survey data in Japan** [have **verified the
hypothesis**]{.mark} above[, showing]{.mark} that]{.underline} those
[[citizens]{.mark} who are **[skeptical]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the
[cred]{.mark}**ibility of the U.S. **nuc**lear umbrella tend to
[indicate **stronger support for** ]{.mark}**Japan's nuclear
[armament]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Consistent with the proposition
emphasizing the structural and material factors, [the statistical anal-
yses in this study have demonstrated that the cultural content in Japan
is **indeed susceptible to the external factors** surrounding the issues
of national security]{.underline}.

The [main contribution of this [study]{.mark} has been to
[demonstrate]{.mark} the [**malleability of the security culture** in
Japan]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [statistical analyses have clearly shown
that **citizens' perceptions of the U.S. nuclear umbrella** have a
**significant impact** on the **anti-nuclear norms in
Japan**]{.underline}. In understanding the anti-nuclear norms in Japan,
[one **cannot overlook** the presence of the U.S. nuclear umbrella that
pro- vides an immense sense of security among the Japanese]{.underline}.
Even after more than seven decades since the end of World War II, [the
fundamental dynamics sur- rounding nuclear deterrence has **remained the
same**.]{.underline} In 2016, [the Japanese government decided not to
support the negotiation]{.underline} process in the United Nations [that
could]{.underline} potentially [lead to the ban of nuclear weapons **due
to the consideration** that Japan is **covered by the U.S. nuclear
umbrella**]{.underline} (Kakuheiki kinshi joyaku, 2016). [While
**political elites** in Japan are deeply concerned about the credibility
of the U.S. nuclear umbrella, **the public also reacts** to the emerging
threats in a **similar manner**]{.underline}. This [study has
demonstrated that **[citizens]{.mark} indeed [consider security
concerns]{.mark}** in forming their attitudes toward nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. Consequently, it is possible to verify the
critical importance of the realist concerns among citizens in shaping
the content of the security culture in Japan (Miyashita, 2007).

Furthermore, [[Japan's leaders]{.underline} [have]{.underline}]{.mark}
periodically [[kept]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[fact
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[nuclear hedge **publicly
salient**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In 2002, then deputy chief cabinet
secretary and future prime minister Shinzo Abe said in an interview to
Asahi Shimbun that "the [[**Japanese government's official position**
is]{.underline}]{.mark} that the [[possession of nuclear weapons is
not]{.underline}]{.mark} necessarily **[[forbidden by the
constitution]{.underline}]{.mark}** if they are small, of tactical
nature and being kept to a minimum size," though he then reiterated
Japan's commitment to not possessing nuclear weapons at the moment,
[[performing the]{.underline} **[now-perfected
hedging]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[pirouette]{.underline}]{.mark}**.92
Even after the horrific events of the Fukushima nuclear crisis, Ishiba
Shigeru, a former Japan Defense Agency chief, stated: "I don't think
Japan needs to possess nuclear weapons, but it is important to maintain
our commercial reactors because it would allow us to produce a nuclear
warhead in a short amount of time. It is a tacit nuclear deterrent."93
He later stated in 2012 that "it would be possible to create nuclear
weapons in the relatively short time of several months to a year."94

[[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark}, like India before it,
[[has]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[carefully laid]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
[[foundation for transitioning]{.underline}]{.mark} from a peaceful
nuclear program [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[development of
nuc]{.mark}lear [weapons]{.mark}]{.underline} if necessary. In 1968,
Basic Studies had estimated Japan's "breakout" time to be five to six
years. By 2012, those responsible for managing Japan's nuclear hedge,
such as Ishiba (after leaving office), had [[publicly
reduced]{.underline}]{.mark} that [**[breakout time]{.underline}**
[to]{.underline}]{.mark} [under a year]{.underline}, possibly even
[several [months]{.mark}]{.underline}, though estimating the exact time
frame is fraught with uncertainties. A sitting defense minister, Satoshi
Morimoto, stated that Japan's nuclear energy program was the foundation
for Japan's "latent deterrent" and that it must be maintained.95 While
[Japan]{.underline} has publicly continued to forswear nuclear weapons
--- for now --- and consistently highlighted public opposition to
nuclear weapons, its [[leaders have]{.underline} **[carefully
emplaced]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[Japan as a **threshold nuclear state**
as]{.mark} [a **conscious strategic choice**]{.mark}]{.underline} as
early as the mid-1950s.

[option]{.mark} [should it ever decide to]{.mark} do so]{.underline}. As

**A**]{.mark}rticle **[9]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the Japanese

as to tell U.S. ambassador Douglas MacArthur II that he "believed it was
essential that Japan have (a) nuclear" weapons arsenal, even though
Japanese leaders were only exploring the idea at the time.78 His
successor, Prime Minister Ikeda, made similar remarks in private.79 In
December 1964, several months after the first Chinese nuclear test,
Prime Minister Sato told U.S. ambassador Edwin Reischauer that "if other
fellow nations had nuclears \[sic\] \[weapons\] it was only common sense
to have them oneself."80 He repeated this to President Johnson directly
several weeks later in January 1965, stating to him that "if the Chicoms
had nuclear weapons, the Japanese should also have them."81 Even as the

[**Japan's [signature]{.mark}** and ratification [were

Foreign Minister Shimoda, according to Daitoku, "[insisted]{.underline}
that [[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark} should '[**[reserve the

Sato declared the [Three Non-nuclear Principles]{.underline} in 1967
while two years later [privately referring to them as]{.underline}
"**[nonsense]{.underline}**" to U.S. ambassador U. Alexis Johnson.83 In
1970, a Japanese Defense Agency White Paper, commissioned by its then

in]{.underline}]{.mark} a [**[legal sense]{.mark}** to

[to]{.underline}]{.mark} achieve its principal purpose of
[[prevent]{.underline}]{.mark}ing the
**[[prolif]{.mark}eration]{.underline}** of nuclear weapons in a number

those countries but failed to do so. Israel is virtually a de facto ally
of the United States but still went ahead with acquiring nuclear weapons
in the 1960s, perhaps ahead of the impending NPT. It is said that India
sought the protection of the United States but the United States
declined. Israel, Pakistan, and North Korea cite serious threats from
surrounding Arab countries, India, and the United States respectively as
reasons for acquiring nuclear weapons.

**[North Korea]{.underline}** [[and **Iraq**]{.mark} are]{.underline}
[cases where NPT parties carried out **clandestine nuclear weapon
developments**. [North Korea]{.mark} was [found to have
**discrepancies**]{.mark} as regards the IAEA safeguard verification
[but **refused to clarify**]{.mark} this [and]{.mark} eventually
[declared]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[it would
**withdraw**]{.underline}]{.mark} from the NPT. In the case of
**[Iraq]{.underline}**, due to its outright invasion of Kuwait, it [was
found to be conducting a clandestine nuclear weapons]{.underline}
[program. It was made to abandon it by the **Security
Council**]{.underline} and subjected to powerful verification. [If it
were not for that, **[Iraq]{.mark}** [could have **gone
further**]{.mark} with its clandestine nuclear weapons
program]{.underline}.

These [[incidents]{.underline} [reveal]{.underline}]{.mark}[ed the
**[inability]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of]{.mark} the **[IAEA]{.mark}
safeguard system** [to detect]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[hidden]{.mark}
nuclear [activities]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Thus, the
**[IAEA]{.underline}** [came up with a model additional
protocol]{.underline} to its safeguard system so that its inspectors
could verify a wider range of sites and use such methods as taking soil
samples for minute radio isotopic particles. The problem is that [even
after more than 20 years since its introduction]{.underline}, the
[[additional protocol]{.mark} has **[not]{.mark} been
[ratified]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[by]{.mark} **key [countries]{.mark}**
[of **concern**]{.mark} such as **[Iran]{.mark}**]{.underline},
**[[Brazil]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[Argentina]{.underline}**,
**[Egypt]{.underline}**, **[[Saudi]{.mark} Arabia]{.underline}**,
**[[Israel]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and
**[Pakistan]{.mark}**]{.underline}, while it has already been ratified
by more than 130 countries. **[India]{.underline}** [has only ratified
an additional protocol]{.underline} [regarding **limited
facilities**]{.underline}.

The model additional protocol was designed because the existing
safeguard system proved to be not good enough to detect hidden nuclear
activities. Logic should tell us that without it, a country cannot fully
satisfy the requirement under Article III of the NPT proving that it is
not in violation of the rules. However, the [additional protocol remains
a **voluntary requirement**]{.underline}, [not a legal one]{.underline},
and certain [countries **resist signing** and **ratifying**
it.]{.underline} [Some of them argue that while NWS have not fulfilled
their obligations under Article VI, they should **not be asked** to
**indefinitely fulfill** the requirement of Article III]{.underline}.
The argument is political and not legal.

###  AT//Sanctions/Backlash

#### First, sanctions. That's wrong. Speed outweighs\-\--sanctions [rarely work]{.underline} and are [long-term]{.underline}.

8/13/17

[Sanctions are coercive means, short of military action, intended to
bring the culprits to their knees and get them to mend their erring
ways.]{.underline} From a purely rational perspective, they should
produce results if actors are concerned about their economic outcomes.
But surprisingly, [[available research on]{.mark} economic
[sanctions]{.mark} [attests to]{.mark} their [limited
effectiveness]{.mark} at best. Hufbauer et al. [in a landmark
study]{.mark} claimed that the [success rate]{.mark} in the examined
cases was [only 34 percent]{.mark}; a later reanalysis of the same data
put the figure at a dismal 4 percent.]{.underline}

Whereas international sanctions imposed on Iran arguably brought it to
the negotiating table and enabled the nuclear deal of 2015, other
well-known sanctions produced little positive results, if not downright
fiascos. [Extensive [sanctions imposed on]{.mark} India and [Pakistan
didn't deter]{.mark} them from acquiring a [nuclear capability]{.mark},
[nor]{.mark} [did sanctions against Russia prevent]{.mark} its
[aggression]{.mark} in Ukraine or the annexation of Crimea. Economic
[pressure by]{.mark} the U.S. in the 1970s [did not convince Turkey to
remove]{.mark} its [troops]{.mark} from Cyprus,]{.underline} nor did the
grain embargo imposed by Jimmy Carter or our boycotting of the Moscow
Olympics dissuade the Soviets from their occupation of Afghanistan. The
list of ineffective sanctions is long, and there are reasons to doubt
that the current uptick of sanctions against North Korea will convince
the Kim Jong Um regime to abandon its nuclear ambitions.

The economics of sanctions, it seems, doesn't help us understand when
they will work and when they are doomed to fail. Economic calculations
have lost sight of the fundamental psychology of sanction, failing to
capture the human element.

To understand when sanctions will work, we need to turn to the science
of motivation. First, sanctions can only succeed when the costs they
exact from the target are greater than the perceived benefits derived
from the sanctioned conduct. If the goal served by that conduct is of a
greater magnitude of importance than the goal interfered with by the
sanctions, and/or if the interference imposed on the latter goal is
minor (i.e. that goal can still be attained though at greater effort)
sanctions are unlikely to succeed. For instance, though boycotting of
Olympics and a grain embargo may not have been pleasant to the Soviet
Union, they were hardly devastating to its public image or to its
economy. It, therefore, would be naïve to expect that they would prompt
a reconsideration of its policies motivated, as it arguably was, by its
lofty geopolitical goals of deterring US interference in the USSR's
'backyard', gaining a strategic foothold in Southwest Asia and
containing the radical Islamic revolution spreading from Iran.

Cost-benefit analyses are straightforward and eminently 'rational.' They
are the least one can expect of a mature government that contemplates
imposing sanctions on an adversary. But quantitative accounting isn't
all there is to the psychology of sanctions. In fact, it isn't even the
major facet of the issue. A much more intriguing, important, and
pervasive factor is the psychology of honor and significance that often
drive the target states' reactions to punitive moves by their
detractors.

The quest for significance, honor, and mattering has been hailed as a
major human motivation that universally governs social action. When it
comes into play, no cost-benefit analysis applies, and quantitative
considerations give way to motivational quality. [Sanctioning, in short,
is a direct affront to nations' honor and significance, that has to be
reciprocated immediately with retaliation, lest one seem weak and
incompetent. Indeed, once the issue is defined as matter of significance
and honor,]{.underline} [**[no amount of economic
pressure]{.underline}** [will override the target's
resistance,]{.underline}]{.mark} [and in fact, it will surely backfire,
as catering to money over honor is seen as reprehensible in honor
cultures. Even with its back to the wall, the [sanctioned party would
**"fight rather than switch"**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and utterly resist
complying with the oppressor's demands to prevent honor loss. In such
cases, yielding would be seen as a disastrous humiliation, a
significance-loss beyond recovery.]{.underline}

The anthropologist Scott Atran discussed in these terms the concept of
'sacred values' (often concerning one's land, one's religion, or one's
family) whose invocation vitiates any possibility of negotiation or
compromise. "Dignity before bread," so goes the Arab proverb, and
thousands of 'devoted actors' enthusiastically volunteering to die for
the ISIS cause, grimly illustrate this phenomenon better than the words
can tell.

[[Issues of **significance and honor**]{.mark} are highly [relevant to
nations ruled by autocratic dictators]{.mark} like Russia's Vladimir
Putin, and North Korea's Kim Jong Un.]{.underline} One does not need to
be an expert psychoanalyst to realize that grandeur, glory, and an
immense desire for significance consume both men to an outstanding
degree. [Insistence on [sanctions]{.mark} in both cases is likely
to]{.underline} **[challenge their honor]{.underline}**, particularly
given that they are done publicly [on the world stage, thus **[pouring
gasoline on their fire]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**[escalating]{.mark} honor [conflict]{.mark}** [even
more]{.mark}.]{.underline}

https://www.lawfareblog.com/dynamics-japans-armed-attack-initiation-doctrine-and-anticipatory-self-defense

Implications of the U.S.-Japan Alliance [How [Japan's]{.mark}
"[armed-attack]{.mark}-initiation" [doctrine]{.mark} **will evolve** in
the future **[is contingent on the]{.mark} fate of Japan's
[alliance]{.mark} with the United States**]{.underline}. In fact, not
only has [[the doctrine remained underdeveloped]{.mark}, but it has also
garnered little attention from the public and even most security
professionals]{.underline}. [This is primarily because]{.underline},
[[by virtue of the U.S.'s]{.mark} **overwhelming offensive
[capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline} backed by the Caroline doctrine,
[[Japan has been able to devote itself to a]{.mark} strictly [defensive
role]{.mark}]{.underline} in its defense. Seeking to "let sleeping dogs
lie," Japan has thus avoided facing squarely the issue of what exactly
the initiation of armed attack means as distinct from the imminent
threat of armed attack. The alliance relationship between the United
States and Japan is often compared to a "sword and shield." [Under the
spirit of the pacifist Constitution underlying its defense-only policy,
[Japan has long refrained]{.mark} from possessing offensive and
expeditionary capabilities]{.underline}, capable of reaching the
territory of other states even for self-defense purposes. Yet such
traditional balance of burden-sharing is now being undermined. One could
argue that, as with Australia, Japan currently leans toward
self-reliance in its national security while maintaining its alliance
with the United States. This move led to a proposal approved in August
by the country's ruling Liberal Democratic Party for Japan to acquire
"capabilities to halt ballistic missile attacks, etc. within the
territory of adversaries." But such capabilities should not be deemed
limited to those needed to halt ballistic missile attacks. To take a
prominent example, Japan has already set up a plan to build the
capabilities of its Self-Defense Force to disrupt cyber operations by
adversaries for its self-defense against their armed attack, which, in
the government's view, even a cyber-only attack could constitute. The
government will reportedly make the first revision to its National
Security Strategy this year based on the party proposal. [No doubt, [a
major shift in]{.mark} Japan's [alliance]{.mark} policy
**[affects]{.mark} relevant [legal parameters]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It
is not completely unrelated to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's recent
repeated calls for revising the Constitution---which has never been
amended in its 74-year history. [The wider the security policy pendulum
swings from defensive to offensive, the more likely it is that Japan
will push itself to the limit of the
"armed-attack-initiation"]{.underline} doctrine while remaining in
accordance with the U.N. Charter and other rules of international law.
[But [it is]{.mark} **the [alliance policy]{.mark}** of the United
States as well as that of Japan [that]{.mark} ultimately [will
determine]{.mark} whether and [how this]{.mark} Japanese [doctrine is
galvanized]{.mark} going forward]{.underline}.

[For decades]{.underline}, [[Japanese]{.mark} strategists]{.underline}
almost **[unanimously [averred]{.mark}]{.underline}** [that]{.underline}
[[as long]{.mark} as US [extended]{.mark} [deterrence]{.mark} **remained
[credible]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [nuclear
[breakout]{.mark}]{.underline} [would [not]{.mark} be [in]{.mark}
Japan's [interest]{.mark}]{.underline}.17 While this [has been
**regularly reaffirmed**]{.underline}, some mainstream strategists today
interrogate the credibility of extended deterrence. In 2018, for
example, former Defense Minister Ishiba Shigeru --- a longtime advocate
of Japan's nuclear latency --- suggested "the [credibility of U.S.
extended deterrence]{.underline} ... [has to be
**scrutinized**]{.underline}." 18 He publicly advocated amending Japan's
longstanding prohibition on building, deploying, or allowing the
introduction of nuclear weapons, known as Japan's three nonnuclear
principles.19 Meanwhile, researchers at the Security Strategy Research
Institute of Japan with connections to Japan's defense establishment
argued that "[[if]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**relative position**
of]{.underline} the [**U**nited **S**tates produces [doubts]{.mark}
about extended deterrence]{.underline}, another [[option]{.mark} would
be to **[leave]{.mark} the [NPT and become]{.mark} a [nuclear weapons
state]{.mark}**]{.underline} ... \[W\]e would probably gain the
understanding and support of most other countries." 20 In that case,
they insist, the best model would be Britain, which, unlike France,
integrated its war planning with the United States, but unlike Germany,
maintained full control over actual use.

The [government]{.underline} understands that nuclear breakout would not
be warmly received by the Japanese public, and it [focuses on enhancing
**extended nuclear deterrence**]{.underline}, the so-called
[US]{.underline} "**[nuclear umbrella]{.underline}**." 21 [To
prevent]{.underline} the [weakening of extended deterrence]{.underline},
[Japanese [officials]{.mark}]{.underline} have [[lobbied
against]{.underline}]{.mark} a [US declaration of [**n**o **f**irst
**u**se]{.mark}]{.underline}, [discouraged the **U**nited **S**tates
from **[acknowledging mutual]{.mark} [vulnerability]{.mark}** [with
China]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} [pushed Washington to
maintain robust **tactical nuclear weapons**
capabilities]{.underline}.22 Meanwhile, the [Japanese [public]{.mark}'s
[aversion]{.mark} to nuclear weapons]{.underline} [[has]{.mark}
**[diminished]{.mark}**]{.underline}, though these weapons are still
unpopular. A 2017 survey indicated that 12 percent of Japanese citizens
favored nuclear armament in the event that North Korea does not
surrender its own programs, up from 7 percent the preceding year.23 In
November 2017, a special collection of articles on Japan's nuclear
future was published in Chūō Kōron, one of Japan's most prominent
monthlies, and earlier that year, the former Japanese Ambassador to the
United States, Katō Ryōzō, argued that a robust reexamination of Japan's
three non-nuclear principles was necessary.24 [What once]{.underline}
was [[taboo]{.mark} [now]{.mark} has]{.underline} a [[**conspicuous

###  AT//Fukushima

#### Fukushima was irrelevant.

Maxime **Polleri 21**, Postdoctoral Researcher at McGill University in

International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University, "Why
Japan Might Not Abandon Nuclear Power," The Diplomat, 03-11-2021,
https://thediplomat.com/2021/03/why-japan-might-not-abandon-nuclear-power

March 11 marks the 10-year anniversary of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear
disaster, the most serious nuclear incident since the 1986 Chernobyl
catastrophe. The accident at [Fukushima debunked the myth of **nuc**lear
safety that had prevailed in Japan]{.underline} until that point. It
also threw Japan's nuclear infrastructure into a mess of uncertainty,
forcing political elites to rethink the future of energy policy.

However, **[it is doubtful that Japan will]{.underline}** fully
[**abandon nuc**lear **power.**]{.underline} This is not the result of
political agendas. Instead, [it has to do with particular visions of how
**nuc**lear power affects energy policies]{.underline} in ways that go
[beyond]{.underline} matters of [electricity]{.underline}.

Since 2013, I have studied [public controversies surrounding **nuc**lear
power in a post-Fukushima Japan]{.underline}. I assisted state-sponsored
conferences on the future of energy policies, visited nuclear R&D
facilities, and interviewed economic bureaucrats, nuclear scientists,
and state officials. I [came to realize]{.underline} that [pre-2011
visions associated with]{.underline} [**nuc**lear power and
**tech**nologies]{.underline} [still influence how Japan handles future
uncertainties]{.underline} around energy policies.
**[These]{.underline}** four [**visions are linked with energy
independence, "clean" energy, tech**nical **expertise, and international
security.**]{.underline}

#### Nuclear power is here to stay.

Maxime **Polleri 21**, Postdoctoral Researcher at McGill University in
the Biomedical Ethics Unit, Network Affiliate at the Center for
International Security and Cooperation at Stanford University, "Why
Japan Might Not Abandon Nuclear Power," The Diplomat, 03-11-2021,
https://thediplomat.com/2021/03/why-japan-might-not-abandon-nuclear-power/

[Fukushima led to surface level political posturing and
indecision]{.underline} around energy matters, but [**the obdurate,
enduring, and historically entrenched tropes that surround nuc**lear
**power** have **barely budged**]{.underline}. [Paying too much
attention to]{.underline} the words of [politicians can be a distraction
from this path dependency.]{.underline}

It is important to state that these tropes are not completely widespread
across Japanese society. Indeed, there was always an important
anti-nuclear movement within a part of the population. Nonetheless,
these tropes are particularly present within economic bureaucracies like
METI that have control over major policy areas. [Ten years after
Fukushima, **nuc**lear power is still considered]{.underline} a
[key]{.underline} factor [in]{.underline} issues surrounding [energy
security, global warming, **tech**nological expertise, and international
security.]{.underline}

These [issues]{.underline} did not emerge out of the blue; they [were
shaped by]{.underline} certain [historical, cultural, and political
contexts]{.underline}, which still influence the prevailing Japanese
vision and future of nuclear power. This **[legacy
represents]{.underline}** deeper **[structural factors]{.underline}**
[that supersede hectic changes in political parties]{.underline},
matters of [economic solvability, and]{.underline} the potential adverse
[health effects]{.underline} linked with radioactive contamination. It
also explains why Japan might not quit nuclear power.

Understanding the future direction of energy politics, whether in Japan
or elsewhere, means looking at how past elements remain in dialogue with
current events, often creating long-lasting influences on the governance
of nuclear power. Creating novel and more sustainable energy policies
might consequently require the toppling of enduring tropes that continue
dominate our worldviews.

[Japan is often referred to as a pacifist country]{.underline} due to
its constitution that forbids it from waging war. However, **[a more
accurate characterization is antimilitarist]{.underline}**. Pacifist and
antimilitarist are often used interchangeably, but [pacifism suggests a
principled opposition to war while antimilitarist suggests a
**restraint** toward the use of force, limiting it to]{.underline}
situations of [self-defense]{.underline}.74 Antimilitarism has been a
norm in Japan since the United States drafted the Japanese constitution
during the occupation after World War II. Article 9 of Japan's
constitution states:

> Aspiring sincerely to an international peace based on justice and
> order, the Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right
> of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling
> international disputes.
>
> In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea,
> and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be
> maintained. The right of belligerency of the state will not be
> recognized.75

Article 9 was reinterpreted almost immediately, as the United States
regretted this provision once it entered the Korean War and the Cold War
began. The pressure exerted by the United States and the realization
that with the U.S. occupied in Korea, Japan was undefended prompted the
Japanese government to reinterpret Article 9, not abandon Article 9.76
Today, [the **J**apanese **S**elf **D**efense **F**orce is a premier
military force ranking as **one of the most powerful**]{.underline}
forces [**in the world** with an annual budget around 49 billion
dollars]{.underline},77 the 9th highest in 2020.78

[The demilitarization of Japan allowed it to focus on economic
recovery]{.underline} after the devastation wrought by World War II.
However, [as Japan grew into an economic superpower a divide grew
between the government's desires to reinterpret Article 9]{.underline}
in order [to reimagine Japan's place in the international system and the
public's desire to remain bound by]{.underline} the [current
constraints]{.underline}.79 The government's argument is that Japan has
benefited greatly from the open international order and should do more
to maintain that system. Brad Glosserman describes this as a
"philosophy, which is based on the idea that Japan should contribute to
international peace, stability, and prosperity in a manner commensurate
with its economic and political standing."80

[Japan's premier military capabilities and the pride]{.underline} that
[the Japanese public takes in its Self Defense Force]{.underline}81
[**argues against the norm of pacifism** in favor of
antimilitarism]{.underline}. The debate that surrounds Japan's
antimilitarist norm is not whether or not to return to the militaristic
culture that dominated Japan prior to World War II, but how proactive
Japan should be in defending the international system that has allowed
it to develop into an economic superpower. The [changes in Japan's
security environment, or **if Japan incurs a security shock, will have
the greatest impact on the outcome of this debate**]{.underline}.82

In the [event of Japanese proliferation]{.underline}, Japan would
[**lose** any semblance of **legitimacy** as a benchmark for the
non-proliferation movement]{.underline}, and the [durable restraint of
Japan as a motivator for other countries' non-proliferation regimes
would disappear]{.underline}. When a [role model goes against the very
idea that it supported and valued, it will both **lose its adherents and
disenfranchise the ideology** itself]{.underline}. Japan is an exemplar
of advocating for and upholding non-proliferation, and if it is not
possible for Japan to remain in said position, it is unlikely that
another, less qualified country will thereafter be able to inherit it.
The [environment that this would produce is that of ideological anarchy
surrounding non-proliferation. With their benchmark defunct, countries
would **no longer feel obligated**, even on an informal basis, to
practice restraint with regard to the production of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}.8

The East Asian Disequilibrium

With the [NPT rapidly disintegrating and the ideology of
non-proliferation in a state of disrepair]{.underline}, [Japan's
immediate neighbors would be the **first to suffer from its
proliferation**]{.underline}. As it stands, Japan, South Korea (ROK),
and Taiwan (ROC) do not possess nuclear weapons despite their neighbors,
North Korea (DPRK) and China (PRC), possessing them. Rather, the nuclear
umbrella under which Japan and the ROK exist provides a counterbalance
to the nuclear capabilities of the DPRK and the PRC.9 [Japan's
acquisition of nuclear weapons would entirely **confound** this delicate
balance.]{.underline}

On the side of Japan's allies, the [ROK and ROC may **perceive** a
nuclearized Japan as a **threat** **to** their own **sovereignties**
both directly and through the threat of nuclear escalation with their
neighbors (the DPRK and PRC]{.underline}), and they may [**attempt to
match** Japan's proliferation with their own campaigns of nuclear
procurement]{.underline}. Presently, the President of the [Republic of
Korea]{.underline}, Yoon Suk-yeol has [already expressed his willingness
to begin the development of nuclear weapons]{.underline}, and --- due to
this existing willingness to proliferate --- [Japan's proliferation
would likely **serve as the catalyst** for the ROK's proprietary
development of nuclear weapons]{.underline} (Herzog and Sukin 2023).
[Regarding the ROC]{.underline}, the situation would be less dire on
account of President Tsai Ing-wen's staunchly anti-nuclear views;
nevertheless, [as non-proliferation loses its legitimacy and the ROC
gains exposure to new regional threats, this attitude would likely
change]{.underline} (AP News 2019). For Japan's nuclear neighbors, with
whom relations exist in a precarious state, its [nuclear
**proliferation** may **give** **reason** for the procurement **of**
**increasingly** **powerful** **nuclear** **arsenals** in an attempt
**to** **preempt** a potential strike from Japan and 'rebalance' the
nuclear ecosystem]{.underline}. With both effects in mind, an [**arms**
**race** among a nuclearized East Asia would occur at a
minimum]{.underline}, and --- in the worst case --- the [nuclear arms
race originating in East Asia would **spread** **sequentially** from
country to country in a centrifugal manner]{.underline}.

Japanese Proliferation and Revolutionary States: The Case of Iran

As previously stated, Japan's proliferation would likely lead to the
sequential centrifugal formation of nuclear states, and --- while East
Asia was explicitly mentioned previously --- [proliferation is **not
limited to Japan's immediate vicinity**; rather]{.underline}, due to the
international [scope of the]{.underline} non-proliferation regime
through the [NPT]{.underline}, the [nuclear **domino** **effect would
have an international reach**]{.underline}. While certain states may not
pose a significant threat as a result of a limited nuclear arsenal or
general nuclear abstention in the event of Japanese proliferation, other
states may pose a unique threat, and a floated set of standards for
nuclear etiquette could arise.

With the [desertion of one of the NPT's core members]{.underline}, the
legitimacy of non-proliferation would exist in a gray area, and the
enforcement of the NPT's consequences for proliferation would largely
rely on the international community's responses to acts of
proliferation10 . [If Japan were to face international sanctions, it
would suffer economically, yet it would still possess nuclear weapons.
For revolutionary states]{.underline} --- [such as Iran]{.underline} ---
upon whom sanctions have already been placed, their **[non-nuclear
status would be suboptimal]{.underline}**. As it stands, the [United
States currently has extensive sanctions placed on Iran that span over
numerous industries with merely a remote link to the Iranian nuclear
energy program]{.underline} (Nada et al. 2023). While this may serve to
reduce the scale of Iran's nuclear capabilities, it employs a great deal
of American leverage. Since the United States has levied so many
sanctions thus far, Iran's marginal loss from additional sanctions would
be greatly reduced. That being said, [Iran has already borne a **large
portion of** **international sanctions** without possessing nuclear
weapons]{.underline}; therefore, the United States and its other allies,
in an effort to materially stunt Iran's nuclear program, would not be
able to do so effectively as a result of their diminished level of
influence. [**Combined with the hypocrisy** of a supposedly pacifist
nation's decision to proliferate, Iran]{.underline} --- [and other
revolutionary states]{.underline} --- would [have both **logical and
ideological pretenses** to pursue the development of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}.

The [domino effect]{.underline}, however, is **[not]{.underline}**
entirely [**confined** **to the revolutionary states**
themselves]{.underline}. Given the [upended condition of
non-proliferation as an **ideology**]{.underline} and the presence of
the aforementioned \'gray area\', [any type of proliferation would not
have the potential to be easily contested]{.underline}. Connected with
the limited marginal loss from sanctions, revolutionary states would
have little in the way of providing nuclear weapons to ideologically
aligned terrorist states or organizations. Namely, Iran's continuous
support of designated terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah could
produce said issues in the event of Iran's reactive proliferation (Grace
and Mandelbaum 2006).11 As a major opponent of the Israeli state, a
potential nuclear power, Hezbollah's acquisition of nuclear weapons from
Iran would likely heighten regional tensions and lead to even more
clashes in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Further clashes with Israel
would introduce the possibility of American intervention as a result of
Israel's diplomatic ties with the United States. Additionally, as
terrorist states lack overt state affiliation, the danger of nuclear
attacks with limited retaliatory potential would have a marked increase.
As this danger increases, non-nuclear countries would have less of a
reason to retain such bounded security capabilities, thus further
augmenting the potential scale of proliferation.

Conclusion

[Japan's proliferation would]{.underline} --- as demonstrated --- [have
consequences that could **exceed initial projections**]{.underline}.
Resembling a sinking ship, the [holes in the ideology of
non-proliferation as a result of Japan's potential proliferation would
**greatly** **outnumber** the states attempting to maintain
it]{.underline}. Once this symbolic ship has sunk, there would be
[**nothing preventing the complete ideological dissolution** of an often
underappreciated security measure, and the global geopolitical
environment may **enter** an era of **nuclear disarray**]{.underline}.

Education, Louisiana Tech Research Institute, "Nuclear Danger in Asia:
Arms Races or Stability?", Springer, June 2023, pg. 266-280

[Unstable command and control over nuclear forces could be **joined at
the hip** to **nationalist** or **religious hostility** in
Asia]{.underline}. During the Cold War, the Americans and Soviets
competed on the basis of political ideology: communism versus
capitalism. Both of these ideologies were rooted in Western philosophy
and history and neither, with the exception of lunatic fringes on both
sides, anticipated an inevitable final day of judgment between the two
systems. Despite significant differences in military strategic doctrine,
the USA and the Soviet Union established an ongoing process of nuclear
arms control that helped to stabilize their political relationship and
to avoid conflicts based on misinformation and mistaken assumptions
about one another's intentions. In a sense, more than four decades of
"nuclear learning" occurred as between the two nuclear superpowers that
lasted to the very end of the Cold War and even beyond the demise of the
USSR.7

In [Asia]{.underline}, the next decade or two [may witness the
**combination** of **absolute weapons** in the hands of leaders with
**apocalyptic motivations** or **regionally hegemonic**
objectives]{.underline}. To be clear: it is not asserted here that the
leaders of nuclear powers in Asia will be less "rational" than their
European counterparts. Rationality is a loaded, and a subjective, term.
In politics, it implies a logical or logically intended connection
between political ends and means.8 [Leaders in Asia will have political
objectives]{.underline} that differ from those of the Cold War Americans
and Soviets: not illogical in their own terms, but [**less road tested**
against accidental]{.underline}, [inadvertent]{.underline}, [or
deliberate **escalation** to nuclear war under]{.underline} the stress
of [political crisis and ambiguous intelligence]{.underline}.267

Military strategy is the realm of logical paradox and oxymoronic truths.
Strategies and policies intended as defensive can, in this paradoxical
world, appear provocative and offensive to other states. For example,
[leaders in Asia might **misconstrue** or apply mistakenly the strategy
of **preemption**]{.underline}. It is not an offensive strategy but a
defensive one. Preemption is motivated by the expectation that the
opponent has already launched an attack or is about to. It is dangerous
on account of its "defensiveness": [leaders **misperceive** that they
are already under attack based on **deficient** and **misleading
indicators** of warning]{.underline}, [or on **mistaken assumptions**
about enemy intentions and capabilities]{.underline}.9

Another possible path to war based on the twenty-first century military
realities is the deliberate use, or threatened use, of weapons of mass
destruction, including nuclear weapons. We noted already that this use
might occur as part of "anti-access" or "area denial" strategies in
Asia. [Hostile powers could employ the threat of **nuclear first use**
against American **allies**]{.underline} or forward deploying the US
forces in order [to **deter American intervention** in the
region]{.underline}, against their interests.

This is an obvious stratagem for China to use in case it decides to
forcibly disarm Taiwan or otherwise create a military fait accompli in
the Western Pacific contrary to the US interests.10 China would not need
to use nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction in order to
accomplish a number of its possible objectives in the region, absent the
US military intervention. The challenge for China would be to deter or
defeat US military intervention in favor of Taiwan or another threatened
interest. More accurate ballistic missiles of various ranges, improved
air defenses and C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers,
intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) and expertise in cyberwar
could augment Chinese access denial capabilities---with or without
nuclear weapons.11 In addition, [the combination of **nuclear** and
**cyber capabilities** in a **USA--China confrontation** could create a
scenario of **escalation** from conventional war into a **nuclear
crisis**]{.underline}. As Andrew Futter has noted:

[This is a particular concern given the fact that China is thought to
**share**]{.underline} some [parts of its **C2** system for **both**
nuclear and conventional forces. This risk is]{.underline}, in turn[,
likely to have implications for China's 'No First Use' nuclear
posture]{.underline}, particularly when cyber is combined with US
ballistic missile defence plans and conventional global strike
capabilities.12

The Delusion of Nuclear Security: India and Pakistan

Despite its theoretical basis, a similar scenario to that which was
previously mentioned has already materialized, and although historical
events are not necessarily indicative of the future, they can provide an
apt warning. [If Japan were to consider proliferating with the pretense
of bolstering security, a careful analysis of India and Pakistan may
serve as an appropriate deterrent]{.underline}.

Upon splitting into two separate states, [India and Pakistan have
remained in a nearly **constant** **state** **of**
**conflict**]{.underline}. Even prior to India's incipient nuclear test
in 1974, the two states had already undergone three conventional
conflicts (Hashim 2019). With the acquisition of nuclear weapons, it
could have been reasonably assumed that conflicts --- particularly
conventional conflicts --- between India and Pakistan would have ceased,
yet periodic clashes in the Kashmir region continued to occur throughout
the latter quarter of the 20th century (Hashim 2019). It is, however,
possible to argue that conflict persisted due to the absence of nuclear
weapons in Pakistan until 1998, which in theory would have eliminated
the threat of conflict due to mutually assured destruction (MAD). [From
a normative viewpoint and with **consideration** of MAD, 1998 should
have been the year in which conflict between India and Pakistan
**ceased**, yet Pakistan's proliferation proved **only to escalate**
conflict between the two states with the eruption of the Kargil conflict
in the Kashmir region during the same year]{.underline}.

[Japan]{.underline} may exist in a unique situation that currently bears
little resemblance to that between India and Pakistan; however, if
[proliferation were to occur]{.underline}, it may find itself bridging
said gap. In such an event, [Japan would occupy the position of the
**first domino in a large series**]{.underline}. By attempting to
improve its own security through nuclear sovereignty, a paradoxical
effect would transpire. [Much like Pakistan's response to India's
proliferation, Japan's proliferation would **inflame** the regional
security environment, and, as **other countries become threatened** by
Japan's proliferation, they may seek to improve their security through
the **construction of their own arsenals**, thus causing further
inflammation. As demonstrated in India and Pakistan, human conflict ---
through the age of nuclear weapons --- has persisted, and
**proliferation merely serves to augment the potential severity** of
armed conflict, not to deter it]{.underline}.

Japan-U.S. Economic Relationship

[**Japanese** nuclear **prolif**eration could compromise its essential
**trade** relationship with the United States, which would threaten its
economic autonomy and by extension, its security]{.underline}. The
Japanese economy is [highly dependent on American
consumption]{.underline} of its exports, particularly automobiles and
auto-parts[. Any **substantial decrease** in those exports could
severely hamper the Japanese economy since auto-related goods account
for **19.4% of Japan's total exports** while exports comprise **18% of
Japan's GDP**]{.underline} (Ministry of Finance of Japan 2023; OECD
2021). In 2021, the United States was Japan's second largest trade
partner after China while Japan was the United States' fifth largest
trade relationship respectively (JETRO 2021 (A)). Additionally, the
United States receives a massive 18% of Japan's total exports while
providing 10% of Japan's total imports. Although the United States is a
substantial export target for Japan, Japanese exports only accounted for
5% of U.S. imports and Japanese consumption of American goods was only
4% of American exports (Chanlett-Avery et al. 2023). The [United States
is one of the **primary consumers** of Japanese goods and its
consumption outpaces any reciprocal Japanese consumption of **American
goods**]{.underline}. Consequently, [American consumption comprises a
significant share of Japanese GDP and underscores how **dependent** the
Japanese economy is on the United States]{.underline}. Furthermore,
Japan accounts for a declining share of U.S. imports due to shifts in
the global supply chain and the transference of manufacturing to
developing countries like China (Chanlett-Avery et al. 2023). [Japanese
**economic dependency** on the United States is further cemented by the
fact that a large portion of U.S. imports to Japan are **l**iquefied
**n**atural **g**as, which Japan is heavily reliant on for its **energy
demands**]{.underline} (International Trade Administration, n.d.).
[Without U.S. oil imports, the Japanese economy would suffer immensely,
especially considering that the global oil supply is **unusually
volatile** as a consequence of the Russo-Ukrainian War]{.underline}.

While these figures show that Japan and the United States are
interdependent, it is clear that Japan --- with its smaller and stagnant
economy --- relies much more on the United States. Moving forward,
Japan's reliance on the United States will only continue to increase as
Japan's share of global exports decreases. Thus, while the [United
States would want to avoid a **total trade severance** with Japan, it
could **diversify** and rely on **other partners** if
necessary]{.underline}. Therefore, Japan [should not **proliferate**
because it would threaten its mutually **beneficial trade relationship**
with the United States]{.underline}.

Conclusion

If [Japan were to pursue **nuc**lear weapon**s**]{.underline}, it [could
**jeopardize** its critical **relationship** with the United
States]{.underline}, and ultimately create a situation where Japan is
less safe. In light of the extended nuclear umbrella's credible
deterrence, Japan should simply continue to engage in regular
communication with the United States and maintain updated guidelines for
security cooperation. Japan-U.S. bilateral security operations are the
most critical factor for sustaining the status quo in the Indo-Pacific
and preventing a revisionist state from taking unilateral military
action. [Consequently, Japanese proliferation would be totally
**antithetical** to maintaining the status quo because nuclear weapons
would radically change the real **power distribution** of the
Indo-Pacific]{.underline}. Furthermore, nuclear proliferation would be
an [enormous deviation from their **joint plans** and shared vision for
**regional security**]{.underline}. While Japan and the United States
have a good rapport, a shift of this degree would be [unquestionably
damaging to their relationship and would significantly undermine the
perception of their alliance]{.underline}. Additionally, any
deterioration in Japan-U.S. diplomatic relations is likely to [spillover
to their **economic relationship**]{.underline}, which would be
[**devastating** for the Japanese **economy**]{.underline}. To conclude,
Japan should adamantly avoid nuclear proliferation and instead pursue
ever-improving bilateral cooperation with the United States, its most
critical ally.

Recognizing the potential economic and geopolitical costs of such
combative diplomacy, [Chinese **leadership** has gradually moved to
moderate its **diplomatic tone**]{.underline}. In June 2021, Xi Jinping
[emphasized the importance of "adopting a **narrative tone** that
reflects openness and confidence, yet conveys modesty and
**humility**]{.underline}, in a bid to shape a reliable, admirable and
respectable image of China."35 The Wall Street Journal reported that
this shift in approach has been driven by Beijing's apprehension that
its confrontational "wolf-warrior" diplomacy may exacerbate anti-China
sentiment and potentially isolate the Chinese economy.36

Notably, outspoken and [proactive **diplomats** known for their
assertive **wolfwarrior style**]{.underline}, such as former deputy
spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry Zhao Lijian and former
ambassador to Sweden Gui Congyou, have [been **retired** or
reassigned]{.underline}. Since 2022, China has been actively seeking to
resume official and unofficial exchanges and trying to fix its broken
relations with Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia, and India, and maintain
stable working relations with the United States amid strategic
competition. Since November 2023, China has unilaterally granted
visa-free entry to citizens of forty-three countries including Germany,
France, Italy, Australia, and Japan.37 [This reflects a strategic effort
to boost people-to-people exchanges, revitalize post-COVID economic
engagement, and improve its global image amid rising geopolitical
tensions]{.underline}.

China's new charm offensive is targeting Japan as well. [Xi has
**repeatedly** stated his will to enhance China's **relations** with
**Japan**]{.underline} and met with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ten times
from 2014 to 2019. At the 2019 Buenos Aires APEC Summit, Xi told
then-prime minister Abe that "China continues to welcome Japan to be
part of China's reform and opening up, sharing new opportunities of
China's development."38 As mentioned, China and Japan have engaged in
intensive minister-level meetings and social exchanges. Xi and
then-prime minister Kishida's meeting in November 2023 reaffirmed their
commitment to "the comprehensive promotion of a mutually beneficial
relationship based on common strategic interests."39

A [**major impetus** is both states' **willingness** to improve their
**economic ties**]{.underline}.40 [**Kishida** and **Xi** agreed to
establish a dialogue framework on **trade**, and their ministries in
charge discussed several key issues such as the stability of the
**supply chain**, **export control** of **semiconductor** manufacturing
equipment]{.underline}, China's entry into the Comprehensive and
Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP), and the
acceptance of new members into the RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic
Partnership).41 In January 2024, Chinese Premier Li Qiang met with
Japanese business leaders, underscoring the significant role of economic
and trade cooperation as "the ballast and propeller of bilateral
relations," two words echoing the previous language used to describe
China-US relations in China's official discourse prior to the two
countries' trade war.42 Additionally, China is active in promoting East
Asia integration, partly to offset the economic disengagement between
China and the United States. China, Japan, and Korea agreed to
accelerate free trade negotiations in March 2025---which had been on
pause since 2019 and were resumed in 2024---amid the growing concerns
over renewed tariff conflicts triggered by a second Trump
administration.

Unlike diversionary war theory, [**domestic challenges** have actually
generated **pacifying effects** over China's foreign
behavior]{.underline}. Conversely, Chinese leadership's perceptions of
favorable distribution of power in the international
system---particularly since the 2008 financial crises---have reinforced
a more assertive, albeit cautious, posture in the East China Sea and
South China Sea.43 As pointed out by Aaron Friedberg, "When Beijing
feels stronger it acts more assertively; when it feels weaker or more
vulnerable it acts with greater caution and restraint."44

Is the Diaoyu/Senkaku Dispute Still a Flashpoint?

The three factors discussed in the above sections play important roles
in pacifying the Diaoyu/Senkaku dispute from China's perspective,
creating incentives for Beijing to engage in strategic communication and
crisis management with Japan. These strategic choices---[restraint of
popular nationalist activism]{.underline}, [limited regional
aims]{.underline}, and [pursuit of **economic development** to quell
**domestic turmoil**]{.underline}---all [suggest]{.underline} that
[China has no intention to further alter the status quo]{.underline}.
Additionally, China's [routine navigation in disputed waters is
relatively transparent and predictable]{.underline}, [mitigating the
risks of misunderstandings and miscalculations]{.underline}. [Adding the
increasing **diplomatic engagements** between Beijing and Tokyo, the
**Diaoyu/Senkaku** dispute will not be a **flashpoint** in the
**foreseeable future**]{.underline}.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/07/12/us-japan-alliance-trade-tensions/\]

It was only five months ago that President Donald Trump heralded the
"fantastic relationship" between the United States and Japan, as he sat
alongside Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, the first Asian leader to visit
him in his second stint in the White House. This week, I[shiba was again
first in line --- but not in a good way. He became the first foreign
leader to receive a scathing letter from the U.S. president, threatening
steep new tariffs if Tokyo didn't meet Trump's new deadline]{.underline}
for a trade deal. The letter stunned some officials in Japan, a security
ally for seven decades and a key partner in U.S. efforts to counter an
increasingly assertive China. But the deadlocked trade negotiations have
frustrated the American president --- who recently called Japan "so
spoiled." Now, Tokyo is learning that being one of Washington's best
friends doesn't carry much sway in Trump's second term, analysts say.
"[They're coming to a very hard realization that Japan is not special
enough to Trump," s]{.underline}aid Mireya Solís, director of the Center
for Asia Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution. "At the end of the
day, when Trump sees deficits, he's not thinking, 'This is my close
security partner.' He sees deficits." [It seemed like Japan was on good
footing when it became one of the first countries to begin negotiations,
in Apri]{.underline}l[. Washington wanted to strike a swift deal with
Tokyo to use as leverage against China,]{.underline} which runs its
biggest trade deficit, analysts say. Trump even showed up to the first
round of talks and gave Japan's trade negotiator Ryosei Akazawa a signed
red "Make America Great Again" cap, which Akazawa wore in the Oval
Office as he posed for a photo with two thumbs up. "A Great Honor to
have just met with the Japanese Delegation on Trade. Big Progress!" he
wrote on Truth Social after speaking with Akazawa. But there was not
much progress at all[. Japan did not readily give in to the Trump
administration's demands]{.underline}, not least because of the domestic
political considerations that constrained Ishiba's administration from
making concessions on key industries, such as autos, steel and rice.
Ishiba faces a tough parliamentary election on July 20 that could cost
the ruling party its majority in the upper house --- and Ishiba his
premiership. Japanese officials hoped Trump would carve out a
tariff-rate quota, like he did for some allies during his first term.
But the president quickly made it clear no one would be exempt this time
around --- not even Japan. "Japan is being treated the same as other
Asian nations, and that is not making policymakers here happy," said
Tokuko Shironitta, Japan country director at the Asia Group, a
consultancy. [As trade talks dragged on, Ishiba repeatedly stressed his
nation's unique standing as the largest foreign investor in the United
States since 2019]{.underline}, creating 1 million jobs. After all,
touting those investments had worked with Trump before. [This time, it
hasn't resonated. "It feels like we're still in a dense
fog,"]{.underline} Akazawa told reporters on June 10. They've now
completed seven rounds of talks. Hiroshi Oe, former chief trade
negotiator who worked on the Trans-Pacific Partnership deal with the
Obama administration, said [Trump is making "even more hard-line"
demands than expected. "Unfortunately, they no longer seem to operate
under the assumption that they should treat \[Japan\] with any special
consideration.]{.underline}" Japanese officials may have underestimated
Trump's deep-seated skepticism toward the country and relied too heavily
on good will, experts say. Some Japanese newspapers and prominent
thinkers are now calling on Japan to reconsider its tactics. "I believe
this was essentially a strategic mistake on the part of the Japanese
government and the Ishiba administration," said Kenji Minemura, senior
research fellow on Japanese foreign policy at the Canon Institute for
Global Studies, in Tokyo. "We're now in a completely different phase
from the first Trump administration. The U.S. wants different things
now." Some analysts suspect this shift may reflect how Trump has felt
about Japan all along. He developed an antipathy toward Japan when, as a
real estate developer in the 1980s, he witnessed Japan's rise to become
the world's second-largest economy and an existential threat to the
U.S.'s economic dominance. That was tempered in his first term, when
former prime minister Shinzo Abe forged a personal friendship with
Trump. Now, in the absence of Abe, who was assassinated in 2022, Tokyo
no longer has that bridge. "He's from the Japan-bashing generation,"
Minemura said. "That's why Trump's inherent suspicion of Japan has come
back to the surface." Trump's attacks on Japan don't seem to be letting
up anytime soon. In Tokyo, there are concerns that the allies are locked
in a trade fight when they should instead be banding together, given
security threats in the region. "When our relations are sour, or seem to
be sour from other countries' \[view\], I think that would only
encourage Russia, North Korea and China," said Ichiro Fujisaki, former
Japanese ambassador to the United States. Tokyo must find a way to
negotiate with Trump, even if a perfect "win-win" solution is not
possible. The resolution, Fujisaki said, may be one where "the U.S. win
is a capital-letter 'Win,' and our win is a small-letter 'win.' "Such a
resolution has proved elusive. Trump has been fixated on two matters
with Japan: Autos and rice. These are also the two areas where Tokyo
isn't willing to budge. "Japan really doesn't have that many concessions
to offer and the ones that it could offer, they're very reluctant to
grant," said Marcel Thieliant, Singapore-based head of Asia-Pacific
research at Capital Economics. Trump has repeatedly complained about the
lack of American-made cars entering Japan compared to the volume of
Japanese cars moving in the other direction. In 2024, Japan exported 1.4
million cars to the United States and imported just 16,074, Japanese
government figures show. Japanese auto experts say U.S. cars have long
been unpopular in Japan, because they are too big for its narrow roads
and parking spaces. The auto industry is the backbone of Japan's
economy, and negotiators have been unwilling to bend on car tariffs.
Japan may revisit auto safety standards that the U.S. says are making it
harder for its imports to enter Japan. But it has so far unsuccessfully
pushed the U.S. to roll back the 25 percent tariffs on cars and auto
parts. Rice is also a complicated issue for Japan, partly because of an
affection for farming, partly because of taste. The homegrown Japonica
grain --- known for its plump, round shape and natural sweetness --- has
been long cherished in Japan. It also becomes soft and sticky when
cooked, and is considered an ideal grain for traditional Japanese foods
such as sushi and rice balls. But for Trump, rice has come to symbolize
Japan's unfair trade barriers, experts say. "Rice is the easiest way for
him \[Trump\] to show that Japan has a closed market. It's symbolic,"
said Oe, the former Japanese negotiator, who previously handled
U.S.-Japan agricultural talks. Trump has indeed been hammering this
point home. "Japan, our friend, charges us 700 percent \[on rice\], but
that's because they don't want us selling rice and other \[products\],"
Trump said during a tariff announcement on April 2. Japanese officials
say that's not entirely accurate. Under a World Trade Organization
agreement, Japan has established a "minimum access" system for rice
imports, allowing up to 770,000 tons of rice to enter tax-free. The
United States is the biggest exporter of rice to Japan, and the vast
majority of it enters tax-free, trade statistics show. Another factor
helping open up Japan's rice market: A recent rice shortage that has
sent prices soaring had forced Japan to accept more imported grain.
Still, dramatically increasing imports could leave farmers vulnerable to
competition and draw the ire of the powerful agriculture lobby, making
it politically difficult for Ishiba to move from his stance that
protecting Japanese rice is a matter of "national interest," experts
say. But some say it may be time to reconsider that position, given the
rice crisis and the stalled trade talks. Because foreign rice is
cheaper, increasing imports can help more lower-income families as they
cope with higher prices --- and with proper messaging, voters may
understand, analysts say. "I believe it actually serves the national
interest" to accept more U.S. rice, Oe said. "[It doesn't undermine
Japan's position --- in fact, it can create a win-win outcome for both
Japan and its partners."]{.underline}

### NUQ---Alliance Unstable

#### Assurances and sentiment are low now---recent tariffs and pressure from China already causing Japanese uncertainty

July 17, 2025

On July 7, U.S. President Donald [Trump]{.underline} sent a letter to
the Japanese government [announcing]{.underline} [a 25 percent tariff on
all goods shipped to the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
beginning on Aug. 1. The reaction was swift. "[The content is entirely
unacceptable,"]{.underline} said Itsunori Onodera, a senior member of
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). "To notify a key ally with
nothing more than a single letter is extremely disrespectful, and I feel
a strong sense of indignation."

In a country where speaking one's mind so directly is generally frowned
on, this statement amounted to a shout of outrage. [The sense of
betrayal is palpable in Japan these days]{.underline}. Prime Minister
Shigeru [Ishiba thought that he had placated Trump's more extreme
demands]{.underline} by promising to invest an additional \$1 trillion
in the U.S. economy, eliciting praise from him at the time. The letter
from Washington came as a correspondingly harsh surprise. A poll
conducted in March and April found that 81 percent of Japanese felt
"more uneasy than hopeful" about Trump's second term in office; that
number is now bound to be much higher.

[Tokyo-watchers are]{.underline} now [trying to figure out whether the
perceived insult and broadside against the Japanese economy]{.underline}
from the White House [will hurt or help Ishiba]{.underline} in the upper
house election on July 20. The vote comes at a time when popular
discontent over inflation and rising unemployment is already spiking.
And that's not the only complicating factor: Tokyo is also struggling to
formulate a response to rising Chinese military assertiveness in an
already tense neighborhood. "[Typhoon Trump is wreaking havoc with
longstanding allies in Asia]{.underline}---Japan and South Korea---[in
ways that are undermining American power and influence in the
region]{.underline}," said Jeff Kingston, a professor at Temple
University in Tokyo. "His erratic diplomacy is [shredding]{.underline}
[trust in American reliability as an ally at a time when Tokyo is
feeling vulnerable to Beijing's hegemonic ambitions."]{.underline}

In the third week of June, [the Japanese watched with shock as China
sent]{.underline} not one but two of its [new aircraft carriers into the
Western Pacific.]{.underline} The ships [sailed through Japan's
exclusive economic zone]{.underline}, and one of them, the Liaoning,
crossed for the first time the so-called second island chain, a crucial
line of defense that connects Japan with the island of Guam, a major
U.S. military strongpoint. The [Chinese conducted drills]{.underline}
involving hundreds of takeoffs and landings of helicopters and fighter
planes, [and one of the jets buzzed a Japanese surveillance aircraft,
prompting an official protest from Tokyo.]{.underline}

On June 27, [the cabinet authorized the Japanese military to shoot down
Chinese drones that enter Japanese airspace]{.underline}---[an
uncharacteristically confrontational gesture that speaks volumes about
Japan's growing concern around Chinese incursions.]{.underline} Some
analysts have warned that Beijing could opt to call Tokyo's bluff by
flying a drone over Japanese territory just to trigger a reaction. The
[cabinet decision came just three days after the Japanese miliary
conducted its first missile test from within Japanese territory. The
weapon in question was a land-based anti-ship missile---another clear
signal to the Chinese]{.underline}.

Even under normal circumstances, [Chinese saber-rattling would have
provoked serious anxiety. But the circumstances right now are anything
but normal]{.underline}. The political elite in [Tokyo is harboring
doubts about its alliance with Washington that go **far beyond the
uncertainty** conjure]{.underline}d [up by earlier
disagreements]{.underline}. At a moment when the Japanese want to see
reassurance from their friends, they are instead being scolded as
"spoiled" by the U.S. president for resisting his tariff demands.

#### Recent canceled security talks after demands of concessions and tariffs prove alliance is unstable

July 17, 2025

According to the Financial Times, [Japan canceled high-level security
talks with the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates scheduled for
July 1 [after Washington asked Tokyo to "boost defence spending to 3.5
per cen]{.underline}t \[of GDP\], higher than its earlier request of 3
per cent, according to three people familiar with the matter." (The
Japanese currently spend only around 1.6 percent, which stands in sharp
contrast to the European defense buildup.) The Times said [the request
had been made by]{.underline} U.S. Defense Department policy chief
Elbridge [Colby, who had already set off alarm bells in Tokyo
by]{.underline} launching a review of the Australia-U.K.-U.S. agreement
to provide Canberra with nuclear-powered submarines. The Nikkei
newspaper later reported that the [Trump]{.underline} administration
[had]{.underline} even [prodded Japan to raise its defense budget to a
whopping 5 percent of GDP.]{.underline} [Such U.S. demands are
**unlikely to go away**, considering the extent to which Trump has been
trumpeting Europe's commitment]{.underline} to exactly that number as a
"great victory" that only he could have achieved.

### NUQ---Trumpism 

#### Trump is killing the alliance 

**Pons '25** \[Philippe; June 26; Le Monde\'s correspondent in Japan; Le
Monde, "Japan is questioning its alliance with Donald Trump\'s United
States,"
https://www.lemonde.fr/en/opinion/article/2025/06/26/japan-is-questioning-its-alliance-with-donald-trump-s-united-states_6742727_23.html;
accessed: 7.18.25\]

But such **[assurances]{.underline}** have [not ruled out the
**unpredictability** of **Trump\'s decisions** −]{.underline} his
[tendency to view **alliances** as constraints]{.underline}, to conflate
economic and strategic interests and to [make demands that Tokyo
considers **unacceptable**]{.underline}. These demands included
requiring Japan to increase military spending from 2% of GDP (in 2027)
to 3.5%, or even 5%, to bring it in line with European levels. Japan is
realizing that it will be increasingly difficult to pursue a foreign
policy based on respect for international law and multilateralism.

[Japan]{.underline} diverged from the positions of Germany, France and
the United Kingdom by condemning Israel\'s attack on Iran, which it
judged \"unacceptable while negotiations are ongoing,\" Prime Minister
Shigeru Ishiba said on June 13. However, he was more circumspect
regarding the US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites on June 21, calling on
both sides to resume dialogue and later stating that he \"understood the
need\" to halt Iran\'s nuclear ambitions. \"We cannot openly say that we
disapprove of US\' actions,\" a source close to the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs told the daily Asahi.

Ishiba − who found himself isolated at the recent G7 summit − announced
that he would not attend, as an invited guest, the upcoming North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) summit in The Hague on June 24 and
25; the same is true for Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and
South Korean President Lee Jae-myung. These absences reflect the waning
hopes of closer ties between NATO and its partners in the Asia-Pacific
region following the US strikes on Iranian nuclear sites.

[From Tokyo\'s perspective]{.underline}, \"The [United States is no
longer as **reliable**]{.underline} as it once was, and [developing an
**alternative diplomatic** and security policy]{.underline} to the one
pursued until now is essential in order [to reduce our
**dependence**]{.underline},\" said Professor Masayuki Tadokoro of the
International University of Japan. Indeed, [greater independence was
**desired** by **68%** of respondents]{.underline} in a poll conducted
by Asahi in May.

Much like the rest of the world, Japan has had to contend with Trump\'s
demands on tariffs (a baseline 10% imposed on most countries, with
additional surcharges of 25% on cars and 50% on steel and aluminum).
This was not unprecedented; in the 1970s and 1980s, the country had
already faced American demands punctuated by table-thumping.

Lack of trusted interlocutors

[Tokyo is locked in tough negotiations]{.underline}; it [**risks**
prompting Trump to once again raise the issue of the **alliance\'s
imbalance**]{.underline}. According to Trump, the US has committed to
defending Japan, but the reverse has not happened. This has not been
true since 2015, though, when Tokyo reinterpreted the pacifist
provisions of its Constitution in order to participate in collective
self-defense operations.

To demand a greater Japanese contribution to the cost of American bases
in the archipelago would be equally disingenuous, since Japan has
already covered 75%, or 211 billion yen (€1.3 billion). These naval, air
and land bases − which provided essential support to the US during the
Korean and Vietnam wars − currently forms its frontline in the Pacific.

There are limits to the leverage of protection. And yet, one question
has haunted Japanese leaders: Is the alliance with the US reliable? They
are increasingly unsure. After Joe Biden\'s election in 2022, political
scientist Toshihiro Nakayama of Keio University wrote: \"[Trump in power
or not, Trumpism is **here to stay**]{.underline}.\"

Indeed, \"Trump is the [**symptom of changes** in American society that
have not always been perceived in Japan]{.underline},\" wrote Robert
Dujarric of Temple University in Tokyo in the April issue of the Revue
internationale et stratégique, titled \"Le Japon et les métamorphoses de
la puissance\" (\"Japan and the Metamorphoses of Power\"), edited by
Marianne Péron-Doise.

The [**uncertainties** surrounding the alliance with the
US]{.underline}, [combined with violations of **international rules**
and the increased **use of force** in Europe and the Middle East -- and
perhaps tomorrow in Northeast Asia]{.underline} -- [has forced Japan to
confront \"the most **severe security environment** since the end of the
Second World Wa]{.underline}r,\" the prime minister said in his general
policy address in October 2024.

Tokyo has sought to play a greater role in the reshaping of global
geopolitics by actively pursuing \"a diplomacy of influence,\" in the
words of Péron-Doise. Centering on multilateralism, Tokyo is also
[remaining careful not to be drawn into an **anti-China \"crusade\"**
and to avoid being the **fall guy** in any \"deal\" struck between Trump
and Xi Jinping]{.underline}.

#### Trump crushes eager optimism between Japan and US. 

**Baylor & Smith \'25** \[Chris Baylor, Sheila A. Smith; Doctorate from
the University of California. Master\'s degree from Brown University;

Faces Another Election\"; Council on Foreign Relations;
https://www.cfr.org/blog/us-japan-trade-impasse-ishiba-faces-another-election;
Accessed 7-18-2025; TS\]

But a weak political base is not Ishiba's only problem. The prime
minister also had to navigate the transition in U.S. leadership. During
his first term in office, Donald J. Trump and Shinzo Abe developed a
strong personal relationship, but [Abe's **death** meant that Ishiba had
to build his own relationship with Trump and his new
administration]{.underline}. On February 7, Ishiba traveled to
Washington, D.C., the second foreign leader to visit the Trump White
House. Outwardly, the visit seemed a success; the optics were good, and
the personal vibe was positive. Many Japanese observers believed that
the special relationship between Tokyo and Washington would continue.

[There were issues]{.underline}, to be sure, that promised
[**difficult** negotiations]{.underline} ahead. Trump remained wedded to
the idea that tariffs could be an effective weapon for recalibrating
allied ties. In addition, the fate of Nippon Steel's troubled effort to
acquire U.S. Steel remained unknown. Japanese businesses worried that
the Biden administration's decision to block the purchase by a Japanese
company due to "national security concerns" suggested a departure from
the close private-sector relationship between the two countries. Japan
was, after all, a U.S. ally and one of the largest sources of foreign
direct investment in the United States. This was made clear in the press
conference held by Ishiba and Trump after their meeting. So too was the
Japanese willingness to purchase more LNG from the United States, an
important energy priority for the Trump administration.

But the [early optimism of]{.underline} the [Ishiba-Trump meeting soon
began to fade]{.underline}. The [tariff announcement]{.underline} on
April 2 [changed the tone and tenor of U.S.-Japan talks]{.underline}.
[Trump imposed]{.underline} [a reciprocal tariff of 24 percent on Japan,
along with an additional 25 percent tariff on automobiles and their
parts, plus a 25 percent tariff on steel and aluminum. A **ninety-day
pause** was given on April 9 to allow countries to negotiate trade
deals]{.underline}, and the Japanese government got to work on crafting
a bilateral deal.

Trump's proposed [tariffs]{.underline} would be [**disastrous** for
Japanese businesses]{.underline}. The Japan Business Federation, or
Keidanren, expressed serious concerns, noting that blanket tariffs could
have "[a serious impact]{.underline} not only [on Japan-U.S. economic
relations]{.underline} but also on the global economy and the free trade
system." Japan's auto industry would suffer the most. The Japan
Automobile Manufacturers Association (JAMA) stated that Japanese
automakers have made significant contributions to the U.S. economy and
that mutual trust should be preserved. Estimates from Toyota and Honda
revealed stunning profit losses---for the Japanese fiscal year 2026,
Toyota forecasts a [35 percent profit **loss**]{.underline}**,** while
Honda forecasts a 70 percent loss.

#### Trade talks have been [fruitless]{.underline}.

U.S. President Donald [Trump expressed **frustration** with
Japan]{.underline} [over trade]{.underline} and said that its
[\"reciprocal\" tariff rate of 25%,]{.underline} mentioned in a letter
sent to Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba last week, might simply be allowed
to go into effect on Aug. 1.

"The letters are a deal," [Trump]{.underline} told reporters on Tuesday
at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland, with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard
Lutnick standing by his side.

"I will [veer from]{.underline} those [deals on]{.underline} occasion
when somebody is willing --- like if [Japan]{.underline} would open up
their country,\" he added. \"They don't do that. They just don't do
that. And I don't subscribe to it one way or the other.

"So, we might just stick with a letter."

Trump suggested in his comments that South Korea might be close to
making a deal that would supersede the tariff letter sent to its
president. South Korea\'s Aug. 1 reciprocal rate, as outlined in its
letter, is also set at 25%.

Additional tariffs on pharmaceutical products might be imposed as soon
as the end of July, Trump added while speaking to reporters on the
tarmac.

On Wednesday morning in Tokyo, Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Kazuhiko
Aoki declined to comment on Trump's remarks.

The U.S. president sent letters to dozens of countries notifying them of
the r[eciprocal tariff rate to be imposed on their goods]{.underline}
from Aug. 1. These rates will apply to almost all exports to the United
States and replace a 10% baseline rate now being charged.

Reciprocal tariffs will not be charged on goods subject to separate
sector-specific tariffs, which include a 25% duty on vehicles and auto
parts and a 50% duty on steel and aluminum.

[Tariff talks between the United States and Japan have been intense but
**fruitless**]{.underline}, with no concrete results being reported in
three months of negotiations. [The two sides have remained **far
apart**]{.underline}.

Public comments have indicated that they might not have even agreed on a
starting point for talks, with Japan insisting on a rollback of tariffs
already imposed as a precondition for discussions and the United States
insisting that only the reciprocal tariffs were on the agenda.

Tokyo has been especially focused on the duty being imposed on autos and
has said that this remains its top priority.

[Trump criticized Japan]{.underline} on a number of occasions in recent
weeks, saying [that it's "**tough**" and "**spoiled**]{.underline}"
[and]{.underline} that it has [refused to buy American
products]{.underline}, especially [rice and cars]{.underline}. At one
point, he suggested that he would end trade talks and simply raise the
tariff rate on Japanese goods to as high as 35%.

Upper House elections will be held in Japan on Sunday, and polls
indicate that the race could be close. Ishiba has been under
considerable pressure to hold the line in talks with the [United
States]{.underline} and could [continue to face
**pressure**]{.underline} after the vote if new coalition partners are
needed to govern.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who was appointed by Trump to
lead negotiations with Japan in April, is set to visit the 2025 Osaka
Expo this weekend. He might hold a meeting with Ishiba during the trip,
according to news reports.

Ryosei Akazawa, Japan\'s chief tariff negotiator, on Tuesday declined to
confirm a meeting with Bessent or any planned meetings on trade with the
United States.

### Link Turn---Science Diplomacy 

#### They like the plan.

**Arguello & Rafaly '23** \[Gabriela and Vonitsoa; December 18; Gabriela

Department, Vonintsoa Rafaly is a Research Fellow at the University of
Copenhagen (Denmark). After completing her JD in International law of
the sea at the University of Nantes; Polar Record, "Science diplomacy
and Asian states: Transforming the governance landscape in the Arctic,"
Vol. 59; accessed: 7.18.25\]

While binding agreements may still foster cooperation in the Arctic,
productive collaboration in soft-law forums like the Arctic Council is
uncertain. The war in Ukraine disrupted the trust-building effort in
Arctic governance and left the Russian scientific community isolated
(Andreeva, Reference Andreeva2023; Zaika & Lagutina, Reference Zaika and
Lagutina2023). This isolation effectively disrupts the scientific
networks developed under the auspices of the Arctic Council, a forum
"that intertwines knowledge creation and decision-making" (Andreeva,
Reference Andreeva2023). As a result, any efforts to resume scientific
cooperation will require a mediator who is trusted, credible and
acceptable to all Arctic states. (Bisen, Reference Bisen2023). Arguably,
Asian states can serve as a mediator between the West and Russia.
Science diplomacy is a field where Asian states can intensify
cooperation ties with the West while still involving Russia (Berkman,
Baeseman & Shibata, Reference Berkman, Baeseman and Shibata2022).
[**Japan**, for instance, places **great importance** on **research**
and **technology** in shaping the **Arctic** legal framework and
fostering collaboration in the region]{.underline}. This state [has not
precluded the **possibility** of continuing its **collaboration** with
both **Western states** and **Russia**]{.underline} (Hataya, Reference
Hataya2023).

China's political influence on the world stage and involvement in Arctic
science make it a potential mediator between the West and Russia,
according to certain commentators (Chen, Reference Chen2023). It is
noteworthy that China still maintains official contact with all Arctic
states, including Russia. More importantly, it could use its role as an
observer in the Arctic Council to promote collaboration between Russia
and other Arctic and non-Arctic states (Chen, Reference Chen2023).
Additionally, G20 and the Indian presidency are also acting as mediators
(Bisen, Reference Bisen2023). The G20 Forum remains one of the limited
platforms where cooperation between the West and Russia continues. In
December 2022, India took over from Indonesia to assume the Presidency
of the G20 Forum (G20, 2022). During its presidency, climate change is a
priority for the organisation and since the Arctic plays a fundamental
role in the regulation of the earth's climate, G20 could work towards
normalising scientific cooperation in the Arctic (Bisen, Reference
Bisen2023).

Moreover, Norway assumed the chairmanship of the Arctic Council for the
period 2023--2025, effectively replacing Russia. At the 13th Arctic
Council Meeting in May 2023, the Arctic Eight, including Russia, and six
permanent participants declared their commitment to promoting
cooperation and stability in the region through the work of the Arctic
Council. (Arctic Council, 2023). Although Russia is committed to being
active in this forum, Nikolay Korchunov, the Russian Senior Arctic
Official, stated that the work of the Council must be fully restored and
all projects must be beneficial to the interests of all Arctic states
(Jonassen, Reference Jonassen2023). At this stage, it is important not
to overlook the role of observers, including Asian states, in the
process of normalising activities within the Arctic Council. However,
despite the promises that a new chairmanship may bring to the Arctic
Council, many still raise concerns about the potential fragmentation of
Arctic governance. As we discuss in the following section, there is
still a possibility that Russia will strengthen its cooperation efforts
with Asian states while dismissing cooperative efforts with the West.

A disruptive effect on the balance of power

Prior to the Ukraine crisis, Arctic governance was based on the soft
power of science. The high degree of cooperation and collaboration in
science, technology and innovation projects helped to maintain
geopolitical stability. Nowadays, the inability to maintain
long-standing cooperation within the Arctic Council and other regional
bodies is likely to create disruption in the institutional order in the
Arctic (Caymaz, Reference Caymaz2023; Exner-Pirot & Murray, Reference
Exner-Pirot and Murray2017). From a governance perspective, studies
envision several directions among which the development of pan-Asian
Arctic era, or towards a Western Arctic Council and Russia/Asia
coalition (Koivurova & Shibata, Reference Koivurova and Shibata2023,
p.8; Landriault & Minard, Reference Landriault and Minard2022). In both
cases, dismantling epistemic knowledge can politicise Arctic governance,
endangering the scientific integrity of the Arctic Council.

First, regarding Asian states' ramp-up presence in the Arctic, and their
role in Arctic research, this interim period is likely to promote a new
Arctic Asian era, particularly as Russia's relations with Western
nations continue to deteriorate. A case in point is the withdrawal of
Russia from BEAC, where the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia
characterised the suspension of activities in this forum as the "fault"
of Western member states. The withdrawal statement opens the possibility
to continue collaboration in Arctic affairs with other partners (The
Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation, 2023). These
partners may well include Asian states.

The suspension of the Arctic Council's operations is also negatively
impacting the availability of accurate and comprehensive scientific data
on the Arctic for decision-makers, at the international, regional and
national levels (Johnstone, Reference Johnstone2015). For instance, the
isolation of Russia will close access to one of the largest Arctic
maritime zones for scientific purposes. It will be detrimental to the
production of regular and comprehensive assessments of the Arctic
environmental status. The dismantlement of activities in research,
science and innovation will lead, among others, to the fragmentation of
knowledge, a cost increase in scientific production, more pronounced
competition between Arctic and non-Arctic states, and fragmented effort
in addressing environmental issues in the Arctic. Asian states hold
critical infrastructure and knowledge in advancing Arctic science, and
their effort in investing in Arctic projects is significant. For
instance, Japan and South Korea launched the construction of an
icebreaker for scientific purposes, to be deployed in 2026 (Lindgren &
Lanteigne, Reference Lindgren and Lanteigne2023). On the other side, the
development of pan-Asian cooperation over Arctic issues reveals their
willingness to have a leading role in Arctic affairs. This is the case
of the Asian Forum for Polar Sciences (AFoPS), the only scientific
cooperative organisation in Asia, created in 2004 to encourage and
facilitate cooperation to advance polar science among countries in the
Asian region (Kim & Jeong, Reference Kim and Jeong2015). In relation to
scientific research areas, a trilateral cooperation between China, Japan
and South Korea was launched in 2016, concerning mutual coordination,
data sharing and collaborative surveys (Danner, Reference Danner2020;
Valery, Reference Valery2018). Other conferences enabling informal
dialogues give momentum for a greater involvement of Asian states in the
Arctic, at a time of conflict. [The **last Arctic Circle Forum** held in
**Japan**]{.underline}, on 4--6 March 2023 reinforced Asian states'
willingness to be perceived as an epicentre for polar research and
dialogue in the future of the Arctic (Lindgren & Lanteigne, Reference
Lindgren and Lanteigne2023). These cooperative frameworks [**assert**
and **enhance** the presence of **Asian states** in the **Arctic**
debate, with a risk of "Easternizing" the Arctic]{.underline}.

Second, Asian states seem to be divided in their ties and ally with the
Arctic Eight. While the Ukraine crisis gave momentum for better
opportunities for China and India's cooperation with Russia, it opened
the way for closer collaboration between the other Arctic states and
Japan, South Korea on economic, scientific and security matters (Bloom,
Reference Bloom2022). The actual trend is that scientific cooperation
with Russia is riskier -- both for Arctic and non-Arctic states. As a
protest against the invasion of Ukraine, scientific events involving
Russia may face boycotts. Such practices are likely to hinder the
epistemic community's cooperation established around the Arctic
environmental research and/or promote a "Western Arctic" (Raspotnik,
Reference Raspotnik2018). One scenario would be the possibility of a
closer cooperation between Russia and Asian states -- especially China
and India, while becoming estranged from the West (Koivurova &
Lanteigne, Reference Koivurova and Lanteigne2022). Russia may increase
cooperation with China and India to strengthen existing political and
economic alliances. For instance, Russia and China recently renewed
their commitment for a long-standing cooperation (Jinping, Reference
Jinping2023). Yet, the assumption of closer ties between Russia and
Asian states cannot be taken for granted. China has not only remained
neutral in the Russia--Ukraine war, but apparently, Sinopec (a Chinese
state-run company) announced the suspension of petrochemical and gas
activities in Russia (Aizhu, Zhu & Xu, Reference Aizhu, Zhu and Xu2022).
Chinese commentators qualify Russian collaboration as opportunistic,
since Russia had a more distant relationship with China before the
annexation of Crimea, in 2014, especially regarding scientific research
in the Russian part of the Arctic Ocean (Sun, Reference Sun2018). From
the Russian local level, China's investment in science, technology and
innovation has long been viewed with scepticism, regarding its impact on
domestic companies, the environment and the threat to regional security
(Zhang & Xu, Reference Zhang and Xu2020).

Therefore, while [**Asian states** can act as a **bridge** between the
**West** and **Russia** to maintain **manageable cooperation**, for
scientific and non-scientific matters]{.underline}, it appears that it
cannot be taken for granted due to the fragile balance of power at the
time of the Ukrainian crisis.

### Troops Check 

#### Troops provide secure assurances 

Alexander **Lanoszka 19**, assistant professor of international
relations at the University of Waterloo and an honorary fellow at City,
University of London, 6-11-2019, \"False Alarm? Donald Trump, Alliances
and Nuclear Proliferation,\" East West,
https://www.eastwest.ngo/idea/false-alarm-donald-trump-alliances-and-nuclear-proliferation

[Some observers argue the prospects for nuclear proliferation among U.S.
allies appear to have heightened in recent years]{.underline}.
Superficially, U.S. President Donald Trump may be responsible. During
his 2016 presidential campaign, he made statements suggesting he might
tolerate efforts by Japan and South Korea to acquire nuclear weapons.
His criticisms of NATO and some of its members have fueled debate in
Germany on the desirability and feasibility of the "nuclear option."
Looking more broadly, since the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. has had
to grapple with the management of its security ties abroad amid mounting
budgetary deficits and growing public weariness of so-called "forever
wars." [And yet, over [two years into]{.mark} the [Trump]{.mark}
administration, [little]{.mark} nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration-related
activity [seems to be taking place]{.mark} among U.S.
allies]{.underline}. In [fact, some of the most powerful U.S.
allies---Japan and Germany---have largely moved away from nuclear
energy]{.underline}. What lies behind this current scenario? **[Perhaps
[one answer is that the U.S military deployments that underscore]{.mark}
U.S. security [commitments remain strong]{.mark}]{.underline}**. But how
do security guarantees relate to nuclear proliferation? Presidential
rhetoric may be important for evaluating the strength of a treaty pledge
by the U.S. to defend an ally in the event of attack by a potential
adversary like Russia, North Korea or China. However, whether it is more
important than other considerations is debatable, since presidential
rhetoric may simply be just that: rhetoric. A verbally cited promise to
follow through on any pledges recorded in print is simply hard to
believe. No country wants to risk the safety of his or her country's
cities for an ally, if they can help it. How can a state, therefore,
have any sort of confidence in its alliances? Thankfully, there is a
way. [The U.S. deploys a wide range of military forces to shore up local
defense and deterrence measures to augment the security of its allies
and to advance its own national security interests]{.underline}. U.S.
forces stationed in South Korea and Japan, for example, are there for
regional contingency if North Korea and/or China were to commit an act
of aggression---not to serve as potential targets to trigger wider
retaliation by Washington, per the logic of trip-wires. They are also
there to kill, making it hard for any potential aggressor to go
successfully on the attack without incurring unacceptable costs. [**[So
long as the U.S. has]{.mark} such [forces on its ally's
territory]{.mark}, or in the theater of operations where a potential war
would be fought, [the]{.mark} security [guarantee is
sufficient]{.mark}ly strong [to have]{.mark} the [confidence of its
beneficiaries.]{.mark}** It is when the U.S. has unilaterally reduced
its forward deployments that its allies become so alarmed they are
tempted to acquire nuclear weapons to ensure their own security. A case
in point is South Korea in the 1970s.]{.underline} As it does now, South
Korea benefited from a treaty promising that Washington would defend it
against external aggression. But when President Richard Nixon came into
office in 1969, he spoke of how partners in East Asia and elsewhere
would need to bear more of the collective defense burden, especially in
light of its failures in Vietnam, rising anti-war sentiment at home and
the downturn in the U.S. economy. Yet, the South Korean President at the
time---Park Chung-hee---was unfazed by Nixon's rhetoric. He believed
that the United States would reward his country for its contributions in
the Vietnam War by retaining its large military presence on the Korean
Peninsula. President Park's optimism was misplaced. In July 1970, Nixon
announced that the U.S. would unilaterally withdraw 20,000 of its
military personnel from South Korea within a year, cutting the total
U.S. military presence on the peninsula by one-third. The balance of
power implications were potentially significant. Since more troop
reductions were now conceivable, South Korea would become newly
vulnerable to North Korea---an adversary that, at the time, was
relatively more industrialized, enjoyed Chinese and Soviet patronage,
had a stronger conventional military and had engaged in highly
provocative but low-level military activities across the Demilitarized
Zone against the South since 1966. Against this backdrop, President Park
put South Korea on the path towards acquiring nuclear weapons. This
project failed partly because South Korea needed outside sources for
credit and access to reprocessing and enrichment facilities---a
vulnerability that the United States used to its advantage to get its
ally to curb its activities and to make nonproliferation commitments.
Still, South Korea has had persistent interest in fissile materials
since the 1970s and continues to undertake continued pyroprocessing
activities. Today, South Korea may not be on an aggressive path to
acquiring nuclear weapons, but its apparent desire to seek some
advantage demonstrates that security guarantees---once broken---can be
very difficult to repair, thus prompting countries to reconsider the
nuclear option. The South Korean case illuminates why we are seeing no
new efforts to get nuclear weapons, at least by U.S. treaty allies, in
the age of Trump. When one looks beyond the rhetoric, actions speak
volumes. The Trump administration has reinforced U.S. force posture with
additional deployments to Germany. It is seriously considering a
permanent military presence in neighboring Poland. Present relations
with South Korea have been rocky, but the Trump administration did sign
an updated free trade agreement, as well as a temporary agreement, to
help cover the costs of 28,500 military personnel stationed there. The
U.S. military presence in Japan has remained steady. Indeed, if Trump is
serious about containing China, the U.S. military presence will likely
increase in East Asia over the long-term. [Dramatic, unilateral troop
withdrawals under the Trump administration are still possible, but the
historical record indicates that such attempts are generally made early
in a presidency rather than later. Nixon, for instance, announced his
troop withdrawal out of Vietnam within eighteen months of coming into
office. **Putting all rhetoric aside, [if the military
foundations]{.mark} of U.S. security guarantees [remain strong]{.mark},
nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration [among allies remains
unlikely.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Credibility]{.underline}** Landpower---particularly [[forward-deployed
**landpower**]{.underline}]{.mark}---[[helps]{.mark} American [security
guarantees appear]{.mark} more [credible]{.mark}]{.underline}. It shapes
how other states perceive America's willingness and ability to implement
its promises and threats. To clarify, [the benefits of
landpower]{.underline} we describe below [exist when the overriding
political objective is to defend an ally from external
aggression]{.underline}. These benefits might not exist if the goal is
to support a domestically unpopular regime face its internal enemies. In
such cases, landpower could become a liability if its presence can
provoke resentment from the local population and become a target for
counterinsurgency. American Willingness [Strategists and international
security scholars have]{.underline} long [understood that putting ground
troops on an ally's territory]{.underline} [is one of the most effective
ways the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [can **make itself
look like a willing part- ner**]{.underline}.20 [Forward-based
[troops]{.mark}]{.underline} deployed in areas of vital interest do
three things. First, they [[are a **tangible indicator** of]{.mark}
American [willingness to fight]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Allies and
adversaries can observe troop deployments and track troop
levels]{.underline}. Ground troops are also expensive to garrison
overseas. That the United States bears many of these costs offers
further evidence it is serious about its commitments. Second,
forward-based ground [troops demonstrate the United States has "skin in
the game." They [soothe fears the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[will abandon its ally]{.mark} in a
crisis **[by intertwining]{.mark}** American **[lives with allied
interests]{.mark}**.]{.underline} When ground troops are on allied soil,
even a small conflict where key American interests are at stake could
kill Americans. Allies and adversaries know the loss of American life
will trigger calls for retribution, making it hard for American leaders
to retreat. Accordingly, [strategists argue ground
[troops]{.mark}]{.underline} are one of the most important ways the
United States can [[make]{.mark} its promise to use **[nuclear weapons
more credible]{.mark}**]{.underline}.21 Third, basing troops overseas
also makes it more difficult to stay neutral in a crisis because ground
troops are not easy to withdraw. Ships and aircraft can sail and fly
away on short notice, but it takes considerable time and money to
re-deploy thousands of ground troops. More importantly, extracting
ground troops during a crisis entails serious reputational costs. Thomas
Schelling captured this logic when discussing American troops in West
Berlin: ..\[t\]he reason we got committed to Berlin, and stayed
committed, is that if we let the Soviets scare us out of Berlin we would
lose face with the Soviet (and communist Chinese) leaders. It would be
bad enough to have Europeans, Latin Americans, and Asians think that we
are immoral or cowardly. It would be far worse to lose our reputation
with the Soviets.22 [Recent scholarship supports these arguments,
demonstrating that troop [deployments **discourage**]{.mark} the
**[allies]{.mark}** who host them **[from acquiring nuclear
weapons.]{.mark}**]{.underline}23 Indeed, some states have responded to
troop withdrawals by trying to acquire nuclear weapons.24 Historians
have shown South Korea began its nuclear program shortly after President
Richard Nixon withdrew the 7th US Infantry Division from the Korean
peninsula.25 Even West Germany, amid indications the United States was
going to reduce its military presence in Western Europe, entered into a
trilateral initiative with France and Italy to develop nuclear
weapons.26 In both cases, troop redeployments signaled the United States
was no longer heeding the security interests of those allies who still
confronted more powerful adversaries.

Domestic Stability and Elite Consensus on Foreign Policy

Japan was domestically stable in this period and experienced rapid
economic growth, as discussed in Chapter 4. The country also had
moderately high levels of elite consensus on foreign policy. Japan was a
multiparty democracy dominated by the conservative Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP). [Although defense officials and officers sometimes had
different views from those of civilians, the government had **strict
civilian control** of the country's defense forces]{.underline}. The
mainstream faction within the LDP wanted to remain in power by
respecting the preferences of the pacifist, antimilitarist public and
continuing to deliver economic growth.677 [Increasing defense spending,
in its view, would be a drag on growth]{.underline}. The LDP also
believed that [militarization would **worsen Japan's relations** with
countries in the region and revive the Japanese defense forces as a
political force]{.underline}. The LDP therefore preferred to continue to
[**rely on the U.S.-Japan security** relationship because it was a more
cost-effective way to meet Japan's security needs and maintain a world
order that benefited Japan]{.underline}. This conservative mainstream
faction of the LDP remained in control of foreign policy. [It was
challenged from the right by nationalist factions within the LDP who
found Japan's dependence on the United States demeaning and wanted Japan
to **aggressively rearm**, and it was challenged from the left by
opposition parties who feared entrapment by the United States and wanted
Japan to **disarm** and abrogate the security treaty]{.underline}.678 As
a result, there was some modest, politically relevant discord on foreign
policy that could have affected Japan's response to U.S. retrenchment.

Availability of Alternative Partners

[Japan had poor prospects for finding alternative allies to the United
States]{.underline} for several reasons. Japan was constitutionally
prohibited from defending any other country. Furthermore, [Japan's
wartime atrocities]{.underline} made it more difficult to deepen ties
with South Korea or other regional states (see Chapter 5).679 Japan also
refrained from participating in regional security institutions so as not
to alarm regional countries---including Southeast Asian countries---that
strongly remembered Japan's atrocities in the Pacific War.680

Implications for Japan's Response to U.S. Retrenchment

The [moderate level of U.S. retrenchment and **rapprochement with
Japan's rivals would not have led to a major change** in Japan's
vulnerability]{.underline}, [creating **only weak incentives** to settle
differences with its rivals or devote more resources toward
balancing]{.underline} (compared with a more insecure state, such as
South Korea). [Pacifist and pro-growth public attitudes would have
**made it hard** for Japan's leaders to devote significantly more
resources toward building up its conventional forces, **even if they
wanted to**. Japan's constitutional limitations, wartime behavior, and
lack of regional security institutions made it less likely that Japan
**would devote more resources toward external balancing
instead**]{.underline}.

Those advisors are wrong. [Japan is]{.underline} **[extremely

  be necessary or desirable, nor can they explain how no-first-use
  compromises Japan's security. [The]{.underline} **[threat of US
  nuclear retal]{.underline}**iation [would continue to deter nuclear
  attacks against Japan]{.underline}.

As a senator, Biden expressed support for a no-first-use policy, and

Regarding the question of Japan's nuclearization, [the]{.underline}

**[short]{.underline}**-term [and]{.underline} **[mid-term
options]{.underline}** [to develop its own **nuc**lear

Japan's confidence in U.S. nuclear protection, and even [leading to
a]{.underline} **[worst-case scenario]{.underline}** [of the abrogation
of the U.S.- Japan Security Treaty]{.underline}. In the East Asian
regional security context, Japan's nuclearization could have
significantly increased the risk of an arms race (particularly provoking
China's assertive responses, as well as having a domino effect of
nuclear weaponization among other Asian actors, such as South Korea and
Taiwan). [In the]{.underline} Japanese **[domestic
political]{.underline}** [context, the choice to pursue an]{.underline}
**[independent]{.underline}** [nuclear weapons program
could]{.underline} have **[place]{.underline}**d **[enormous political
pressure]{.underline}** [on the Japanese government]{.underline},
possibly [resulting in the]{.underline} **[fall]{.underline}** [of the
pro-U.S. LDP government]{.underline}. Hence, [Japanese
strategists]{.underline} **[concluded]{.underline}** that [the pursuit
of an independent nuclear weapons program would]{.underline}
**[undermine]{.underline}** [Japan's]{.underline}
**[vital]{.underline}** [political and security interests]{.underline},
**[destabilize]{.underline}** international [security]{.underline}
environments, [and result in Japan's]{.underline}
**[isolation]{.underline}** [in the international system]{.underline}.
These sober calculations pressed Japanese leaders to intensify their
efforts to garner U.S. security reassurances, which consequently
increased Japanese reliance on the U.S. nuclear umbrella.

**[Despite U.S. retrenchment and other geopolitical
changes]{.underline}**, [Japanese leaders not only maintained the
country's policy of relying on U.S. extended nuclear deterrence but also
worked to ensure its continuance]{.underline}, assessing that it would
be [**unwise** for Japan to acquire its own nuclear weapons for
political, strategic, and diplomatic reasons]{.underline}.

[Japan **had the technical potential** to pursue a nuclear weapon

• The [**costs** of an indigenous program would be high]{.underline}.

• Japan [lacked appropriate **test sites**]{.underline}.

• Japan's [small size and **high population density** made the

• The [public **opposed** nuclear weapons]{.underline}.

• The United States opposed proliferation.728

to obtain the following systems or capabilities to carry out a
successful strike: the ability to destroy air defense radars, low-flying
aircraft capable of avoiding radar detection, ASMs or cruise missiles,
and the ability to collect intelligence \[End Page 76\] on enemy missile

Other than one bit of yellow journalism in the *Sunday Times*, [no one

With [consideration for the **serious** **ramifications** of nuclear
proliferation]{.underline} --- which include [harming **key diplomatic**
**and economic** partners, **igniting conflict** with foreign
adversaries]{.underline}, [**hindering** one's own **economy** and
energy supply]{.underline}, originating a sudden [rise of
**international proliferation**]{.underline}, and [provoking domestic
and international scrutiny that sows suspicion over the **ethics and
priorities** of the country]{.underline} --- [any effort to proliferate
from Japan has the probability of **creating** a **more dangerous**
situation]{.underline} [than proliferation would **ever possibly
solve**]{.underline}.

One current international objective of the United Nations is the
reduction in use and eventual elimination of nuclear weapons as evident
by the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) from
1970 and the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TPNW) from
2021. In part, this objective is highlighted by the United Nations with
such frequency because the dangerous nature of nuclear weapons --- which
is not unknown to Japan, the first and only country to suffer the direct
and brutal impacts of nuclear bombings --- goes beyond the casualties
and infrastructural damage and instead extends to even their creation
and storage, which are risky undertakings on their own. The
[implications of proliferating]{.underline} and obtaining weaponry of
this caliber [are clear]{.underline}: [possession of the power to cause
mass casualties and infrastructural damage to cities and the intent and
comfortability with using them. For Japan, such an **extreme**
**reversal** in its conduct on the international stage would undoubtedly
**cause a global disturbance**]{.underline}.

In acknowledgement of arguments for the proliferation of Japan, we
recognize the [existence of foreign nations frequently regarded as
threats to Japan]{.underline} -- often due to [**territorial disputes**
such as the Senkaku Islands (尖閣諸島]{.underline}) [with]{.underline}
the People's Republic of China (PRC, "[China]{.underline}")
[and]{.underline} the Republic of China (ROC, "[Taiwan]{.underline}")
[or the **Northern Territories** (北方領土)]{.underline}
[with]{.underline} the Russian Federation ("[Russia]{.underline}").
[Additional threats include]{.underline} the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK, "[North Korea]{.underline}") and its [usage of
**intimidation tactics** such as missile testing in the Sea of Japan and
North Pacific Ocean]{.underline} -- waters surrounding not only Japan
but its ally, the Republic of Korea (ROK, "South Korea").

Fortunately, the current [international environment]{.underline} at this
time [**does not legitimize** the nuclear proliferation of
Japan]{.underline} when [**weighed against the credibility of foreign
threats** and the overall significance of these conflicts]{.underline}
as discussed in further depth in Chapter I Section II--V. In studying
these foreign conflicts, our findings indicate that they [do not
constitute the **escalation** of national security initiatives to the
extent of proliferation, especially in the instance of territorial
conflicts]{.underline}. The [probability of proliferation
**aggravating** these current **threats** is immense]{.underline}, and
therefore, proliferating would be [**contradictory** to Japan's
objectives of establishing stability and democracy in East
Asia]{.underline}.

In Chapter I Section I, we assert the notion that the U.S.-Japan
Security Treaty and subsequent alliance of forces are sufficient for the
prolonged defense of Japan. In conjunction with the Japanese
Self-Defense Forces (JSDF), the American military can adequately address
the current international and regional threat environment and any future
adjustments to those environments. Additionally, the American nuclear
umbrella is robust enough to defend Japan should it require the usage of
nuclear weapons, creating a situation where Japanese proliferation would
be unnecessary in light of the other consequences facing Japan should it
proliferate.

To further address the non-diplomatic consequences of Japanese
proliferation, Chapter II discusses the [economic consequences of
proliferation domestically and internationally]{.underline} as well as
the opportunity costs of proliferation. We emphasize the [probability of
**sanctions**]{.underline} --- a particularly [challenging obstacle for
Japan]{.underline}, who is [heavily **reliant on the importation** of
natural resources and other materials]{.underline} --- and [decreased
foreign investment opportunities]{.underline} and the subsequent
repercussions these consequences would have on the Japanese economy.
This [establishes that Japanese proliferation is]{.underline} not only
[**dangerous** for foreign diplomacy and security purposes]{.underline}
but is [difficult due to the opportunity cost to its nuclear energy
supply and]{.underline} the [potential sanctions]{.underline} on
importation of other energy sources such as petroleum.

In an effort to acknowledge the international ramifications of Japan
proliferating from a non-diplomatic standpoint, Chapter III details the
"**[domino effect]{.underline}**," where [one country's proliferation
results in a chain reaction of several other countries']{.underline}
[subsequent proliferation]{.underline}. This would
[jeopardize]{.underline} not only [Japan's professed claim of increasing
non-proliferation movements but also the United Nations' efforts to
increase non-proliferation and disarmament internationally]{.underline}.
This would [likely have the **adverse effect** of causing mass
proliferation worldwide]{.underline} as **[even the most
pacifist]{.underline}** and [anti-nuclear societies **obtain nuclear
weapons**]{.underline}. This would pose a much great[er risk to Japan
than the initially projected regional threats of China, North Korea, and
Russia and would **damage regional and global security**]{.underline}.

However, [if Japan chooses to ignore the previous concerns]{.underline},
Chapter IV addresses the prominence of the Japanese anti-nuclear
identity and the **[domestic barriers]{.underline}** the [Japanese
government would encounter when trying to proliferate]{.underline}.
Section I acknowledges [Japanese society's lengthy history with nuclear
accidents]{.underline}, highlighting the [atomic bombings of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki]{.underline}, the Daigo Fukuryu Maru incident, and the
[Fukushima Nuclear Disaster]{.underline} as they [relate to a **growing
anti-nuclear sentiment** among the Japanese public]{.underline}. It
further serves to assess the [contradictory relationship between the
Japanese public and nuclear energy]{.underline}, [negating the argument
that public support for nuclear energy indicates public support for
proliferation]{.underline}.

Section II outlines the current interpretations of [Article
9]{.underline} [and the Three Non-Nuclear Principles]{.underline},
including their [restrictions and the validity of certain claims put
forth by the Japanese government]{.underline} --- most specifically that
there is a [capacity for so-called "**defensive nuclear
weapons**]{.underline}" under Article 9, which we argue **[there is
not]{.underline}**. We further detail the subsequent challenges the
Japanese government would face in proliferating due to the [Japanese
**public's current interest in maintaining Article 9** and the Three
Non-Nuclear Principles in their current state and the national
referendum requirement necessary for the formal amendment
process]{.underline}. Therefore, we suggest that an [attempt at
proliferation is **unlikely if it is fully democratic and
constitutional**]{.underline}.

**[likely]{.underline}** [reaction of the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, [which
has]{.underline} **[long opposed]{.underline}** [the acquisition of

The [Russian invasion to Ukraine raised, perhaps more than any other
time, the question as to whether Japan **should or should not go
nuclear**]{.underline}. On March 25, former prime minster Shinzo Abe
shocked Japan, and the surrounding region, when he said in an interview
with Sankei Shimbun that Japan should consider nuclear weapons and
"start discussing whether to seek a nuclear sharing arrangement similar
to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation's nuclear deterrence policy".

Of course, Abe knows that [acquiring nuclear weapons in Japan would be
**crossing the line**, if not unthinkable]{.underline}; but he is also
aware that threats to his country are real. As he explained, "Japan's
geopolitical situation shares points in common with Ukraine's... If
Ukraine were a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation
\[NATO\]... Russia would not have invaded."

Indeed, what happened to Ukraine came as a shock, not only to Japan, but
also to other countries, particularly those dependent on others to meet
their security needs. Abe is also aware of the Japanese public's
concerns about the ongoing North Korea threat and China's increasing
aggression in East Asia and the South China Sea region.

Of course, [Japan has **all the capabilities** to be a nuclear power and
already is in possession of 45.5 tonnes of reparated Plutonium, enough
to **produce 6,ooo nuclear bombs**. Japan could go nuclear within six to
12 months; nevertheless, Japan **will not acquire nuclear weapons for
several reasons**]{.underline}.

**[First]{.underline}**, as is well known, [Japan is the only country to
have suffered from nuclear attacks]{.underline}. This was the main
reason for its surrender in the Second World War. After the war, Japan
adopted the [**Three Non-Nuclear Principles**, which stipulate
non-**possession, non-production, and non-introduction of nuclear
weapons in its territories**. Japan is still **politically firmly
stuck** to these principles in accordance with its Peace
Constitution]{.underline}. Former prime minister, Yoshihide Suga, vowed
not only to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, but also to
free the world of all nuclear arms. This [Japanese sensitivity to
nuclear technology was further reinforced after the **Fukushima
disaster** in 2011]{.underline}.

**[Second]{.underline}**, The [**anti-nuclear sentiment is strong**
among Japanese people]{.underline}. Indeed, the [Japanese are strikingly
opposed to nuclear weapons]{.underline}. According to a prevous public
opinion poll, [**82 per cent** of Japanese people are against nuclear
weapons, while 69 per cent are also opposed to having these weapons
brought into their country's territories]{.underline}.

**[Third]{.underline}**, it is not only the Japanese public that is
opposed to nuclear weapons. Indeed, there [many **internal players who
reject** these nuclear arms]{.underline}. The nuc[lear energy industry
in Japan is **advanced and thriving**, but this only gained acceptance
on account of the '**nuclear energy, not nuclear weapons'** deal of the
1950s]{.underline}. Thus [ministries, regulatory bodies, industrial
groups, and local governments have the **right of veto** against any
political decision in this regard]{.underline}. These entities rely on
strong public opposition, of course.

Another important point here is that the [nuclear facilities in Japan
**operate in compliance** with several multilateral agreements and
treaties]{.underline}. It is also noteworthy that [all Japanese nuclear
activities are **under the regulatory control** of the International
Atomic Energy Agency]{.underline}.

**[Forth]{.underline}**, [Japan]{.underline} is still, and [will remain,
under the American nuclear umbrella]{.underline}. [All American
administrations, **including Trump's**, have **reaffirmed their
commitment** to Japan's security]{.underline}. Therefore, [US **nuclear
capacities** together with its conventional military capabilities in the
region are **sufficient** to deter any North Korean security threat to
Japan, including a nuclear attack]{.underline}.

However, [US **withdrawal**]{.underline} from the Pacific, though not
yet expected, could invoke Japan to conclude that the "nuclear option"
might be the best choice. Indeed, if the US withdraws its security
commitment to Japan, which includes [the **nuclear umbrella**, Japan
could seriously consider becoming a nuclear power. But this is **not
expected**]{.underline}, at least not in the near future.

**[Fifth]{.underline}**, despite Japan's potential to develop a nuclear
capacity, it still faces [significant challenges in the acquisition of
nuclear weapons]{.underline}. The issue is [**not limited to making** an
atomic bomb. Developing a nuclear deterrent will be no easy matter for
Japan. It will need to conduct a series of nuclear **tests, over a
period of years**, to achieve reliable nuclear
capabilities]{.underline}.

This also raises another significant question: **[How will Japan deploy
such weapons]{.underline}**? Japan [**does not have** nuclear-capable
aircraft, nor does it have specialised bombers or strike
planes]{.underline}. The Japan Air Self-Defence Force does have several
US warplanes, such as the [**F-15,** which can be modified to carry
nuclear bombs. However, deploying these would **require US approval** to
access the "black boxes" on the plane, that is the electronic codes. It
is hard to imagine that the **US would consent** to this]{.underline}.

Despite the ongoing debates as to whether Japan should change its
long-standing policy of nuclear abstention, given the profound changes
in the regional and international security environment, [it is **not
expected that** Japan will opt for nuclearisation, at least not in the
foreseeable future]{.underline}. However, the debate on sharing nuclear
power with the US will remain active from some time.

Despite [China's rising military and economic capability]{.underline},
its ascension and regional hegemony [**does not pose** the existential
threat needed to warrant Japanese nuclear proliferation]{.underline}.
[Pursuing nuclear weapons would only **serve to incense**
China]{.underline}, **[escalate regional tensions]{.underline}**, and
diminish Japanese security. Japan and China have a long history of
violent conflict and their relations have only recently been stabilized.
From 2017 to 2019, and again in February 2023, [Japan and China have had
several in-person meetings to discuss prominent issues and future
cooperation]{.underline} in an attempt to resume regular talks and
alleviate tension (Ming 2021; Murakami 2023). The February meeting
covered China's relationship with Russia, Japan's military expansion and
the Cross-Strait conflict. While none of these meetings with China have
yielded any resolution to their outstanding problems, [it appears both
states **understand the value of de-escalation**]{.underline}.
Nonetheless, rising nationalist sentiment and the legacy of their
historical antagonism continues to hamper progress. Thus, [considering
the fragile nature of Japan-China relations and the prospects for
improvement, Japan should not proliferate to **maintain progress with
China** and to prevent endangering the Japanese public]{.underline}.

Moreover, despite their historical and contemporary grievances, [Japan
and China have been core trade partners for decades]{.underline}, and
their [**economic** **interdependence** continues to grow]{.underline}.
[Both states are major mutual exporters and importers and any
substantial reduction in trade would be **extremely costly** to both,
but especially Japan]{.underline}. [Japanese nuclear proliferation would
draw China's ire and move it to fervent **retaliation**]{.underline},
which would likely [include **severe military** and economic
**measures** to punish Japan]{.underline}. The Japanese pursuit of
nuclear weapons would likely commit irreparable damage to their economic
relationship. Therefore, Japan should not proliferate in order to
maintain its fruitful economic relationship with China.

The [durability of Japan's commitment to]{.underline}

[raises an important consideration]{.underline}. [Some]{.underline}
security [analysts]{.underline} have **[predicted]{.underline}**

nuclearisation. Yet [Japan's]{.underline} **[decades-old nuclear
abstention]{.underline}** [defies those predictions, which
neglected]{.underline} **[other]{.underline}**
[considerations]{.underline}.

Early in the Cold War, [Japan's commitment to]{.underline} global
**[economic interdependence]{.underline}** [prioritised stability and
global market access]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}
**[shaped]{.underline}** [incentives to]{.underline}
**[remain]{.underline}** [a non-nuclear weapons state and]{.underline}
**[reduce risks]{.underline}** to its economy. Japan also capped defence
spending at 1 per cent of GDP. While by 2020 China had surpassed the
United States as Japan's top export market, Japan still relied on US
extended deterrence despite its own technological capabilities.

Unlike in South Korea, [Japanese public opinion remains]{.underline}
**[opposed]{.underline}** [to nuclear weapons acquisition]{.underline}.
[A]{.underline} **[2019]{.underline}** national **[survey]{.underline}**

[To]{.underline} **[reassure the public]{.underline}**, [Japan's leaders
launched]{.underline} the largest [**mil**itary
**expansion**]{.underline} since 1945. While Article 9 of the
Constitution famously renounced the right to maintain military forces,
in 2015 the Diet voted to allow Japanese forces to deploy overseas to
defend allies. In 2017, the 1 per cent of GDP cap in [defence
expenditures was]{.underline} **[superseded]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} in 2022 Kishida raised it to 2 per cent by 2027 --- on
track to become the third-largest defence budget globally. **[Joint

Domestic Costs of Proliferation

The [construction of a single nuclear warhead can **cost billions** of
dollars]{.underline}, and the [costs of **maintaining** a nuclear
arsenal would be **even higher**]{.underline}. [For Japan, the costs of
building nuclear weapons would be especially significant given its
**limited resources**]{.underline}. To give a comparable estimate, a
South Korean government analysis estimated that it cost North Korea
between \$1.1 billion and \$3.2 billion to develop its nuclear weapons
program (Pearson and Park 2016). However, accurate estimates are
difficult to obtain given the secrecy surrounding the program, and the
exact figures for Japan would be determined by the size of the project.
To provide an approximating estimate, it is possible to estimate Japan's
potential nuclear stockpile through a comparison in American and
Japanese military expenditures. For the fiscal year of 2023, the U.S.
Department of Defense (DoD) has allocated \$773 billion, and the JSDF
has allocated approximately \$52 billion (U.S. Department of Defense
2022; Tian & Liang 2023). Utilizing the two budgets as a proportion
(6.7%) of military sizes and the most recent estimated size of the U.S.
nuclear arsenal (5,428), Japan would likely end up compiling 300--400
nuclear warheads in its arsenal (Kristensen & Korda 2022). [If Japan
were to utilize]{.underline} the modernized W87-1 [nuclear
warheads]{.underline} (\$14.8 billion per warhead as of 2020) for their
arsenal, it could [cost anywhere from \$4.4 trillion to \$**5.9
trillion**]{.underline} (U.S. Government Accountability Office 2020).
[Even if Japan were to confine the size of its arsenal to]{.underline}
that of the DPRK ([20 warheads]{.underline}), it would still [cost
approximately \$**300 billion**]{.underline} (U.S. Government
Accountability Office 2020; Kristensen & Korda 2022). To account for
these costs, there would need to be a significant increase in Japanese
defense spending in Japan, which was already increased from 1% to 2% by
the Kishida administration in 2022 (Kajimoto and Yamaguchi 2022).

In addition to the direct costs of building and maintaining a nuclear
weapons program, there are [indirect costs associated with increased
defense spending]{.underline}. Given that military spending directly
diminishes the spending power of the government, [spending a greater
amount of money on defense would likely cause a **decreased**
availability of **funding** **for** **other** important government
**infrastructure** and social welfare projects]{.underline}.

This includes the opportunity cost of developing a nuclear weapons
program instead of allocating resources to sustainable nuclear energy.
The [cost of establishing a nuclear weapons regime would be **twofold**:
the implicit cost of building new facilities, and the opportunity cost
of the **energy** **capacity** **lost** due to the transfer to the
procurement of nuclear weapons]{.underline}. Developing nuclear energy
has been a priority of Japan's for a long time --- given its limited
natural resources and high energy needs. However, investing in nuclear
weapons would divert resources from the development of sustainable
energy solutions. As sustainable energy becomes an international
priority to slow the effects of climate change, it is important that
Japan continue to devote resources to the nuclear energy sector to
further the domestic and global initiative for sustainable energy
practice, and to divert these resources to a nuclear weapons program
would significantly hinder Japan's ability to accomplish those
objectives.

Therefore, the [estimated direct and opportunity costs of proliferation
are **too** **costly** for Japan given the other significant
consequences of proliferating]{.underline}. Serving as a hindrance to
other federal programming, a Japanese nuclear weapons program would
significantly detract from its current nuclear energy program and the
overall national energy supply.

\*\*CPTPP = Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific
Partnership

The Effect on Trade

The impact of trade sanctions can be severe, especially on countries
that rely heavily on imports as is the case with Japan. [If Japan were
to pursue a nuclear weapons program, it would face **serious**
**economic** **consequences** from its trade partners, which has the
potential to be devastating for Japan\'s economy]{.underline}. Trade
sanctions such as [**tariffs**, **quotas**, **and** **embargoes** would
lead to increased costs for Japanese businesses]{.underline}, resulting
in increased prices for Japanese consumers. Consequently, a decline in
purchasing power and a reduction in overall consumer spending would be
likely, which, in turn, could cause a decrease in economic growth and an
increase in unemployment. Export revenue would decrease, and imports
would be significantly more expensive --- if accessible at all in the
case of embargos. The Japanese current account balance would deteriorate
resulting in a loss of the account surplus it has dedicated itself to
maintaining for years. This would be particularly damaging to the
Japanese economy, where the country's account surplus has been a symbol
of "export might" and a "source of confidence in the safe-haven yen"
(Kajimoto 2023).

Similarly, [Japanese proliferation would likely jeopardize existing
trade agreements]{.underline}. The Comprehensive and Progressive
Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) are key trade partnerships for Japan
that might otherwise be negatively impacted by proliferation. The CPTPP,
a trade agreement between 11 countries in the Asia-Pacific region, aims
to boost economic integration and growth. Japan\'s membership in the
agreement provides the country with access to a large and dynamic
market, and serves as a strategic tool to counterbalance China\'s
influence in the region. In November of 2019, Japan exported just over
800 million yen worth of goods to CPTPP member countries (Jaramillo
2020).

Similarly, Japan\'s partnership with ASEAN, a regional intergovernmental
organization, aims to strengthen economic ties and promote peace and
stability in Southeast Asia. Japan\'s participation in the CPTPP and
ASEAN has significant implications for the country\'s economy. The
agreements provide Japan with opportunities to promote its businesses,
technology, and culture in the region. Japan\'s membership in the CPTPP,
in particular, has the potential to stimulate economic growth and
innovation by lowering tariffs, harmonizing regulations, and
facilitating the flow of goods and services. The [CPTPP eliminates an
estimated 95% of tariffs for trade of goods between CPTPP
countries]{.underline}, which contributes to reduced business costs
allowing consumers to benefit from lower prices. (US-ASEAN 2021).

If [Japan were to adopt nuclear weapons]{.underline} this could [result
in their **removal** from the treatie]{.underline}s, or alternatively,
the [treaty members might form a new agreement without
Japan]{.underline}. Thus, Japan would no longer benefit from lower
tariffs and regulations. This would increase transaction and business
costs, stunting economic growth. Japan would lose access to important
regional markets and its exported goods would become less competitive.

The deterioration of trade relationships would also have a negative
effect on the Japanese energy industry. As mentioned in Chapter I
Section V of the report, [Japan is **heavily reliant** on imported
oil]{.underline}, particularly from Russia, who provided 8% of Japan\'s
oil imports in 2020 (U.S. Energy Information Administration 2020).
Japan\'s [dependence on imported oil is primarily due to a **lack of
domestic natural resources** with only a few small oil fields in the
country]{.underline}. If Japan were to pursue a nuclear weapons program,
it would [jeopardize its relationship with key trade partners such as
Russia]{.underline}. This could [cause Russia to implement export
**quotas** that would make it difficult for Japan to import the oil it
needs]{.underline}. Oil imports are critical inputs for many sectors of
the Japanese economy including transportation, industry, and
agriculture. According to the Japan Oil, Gas and Metals National
Corporation (JOGMEC), [crude oil and natural gas together account for
more than **60% of Japan\'s primary energy consumption**]{.underline}
(JOGMEC 2021). [Therefore, any disruption in this import supply chain
could have serious consequences]{.underline} for the country\'s economic
well-being. The [price of oil in Japan would sky rocket, generating
inflation]{.underline}. Worse still, shortages of oil caused by
embargoes could [lead to an **energy** **crisis**]{.underline}. Due to
the Japanese reliance on imported oil, trade sanctions and embargoes on
Japan would destabilize the Japanese energy supply and likely cause an
energy crisis. This was exemplified by the Arab oil embargo of 1973 ---
during which Arab countries implemented oil export restrictions on
pro-Israeli governments, causing oil prices to jump from \$2 per barrel
to \$11 per barrel (Schneider, n.d.). This caused an economic recession
in Japan, marking the end of a period of rapid growth in the Japanese
economy. Thus, it is clear that [trade sanctions on oil imports to Japan
could have **disastrous** **effects** on the Japanese economy, and
Japanese proliferation would likely cause such sanctions]{.underline} to
occur due to the international backlash inherent in backing out of the
Non-Proliferation Treaty and obtaining nuclear weapons.

list of government officials and academic experts has always viewed

its security. What policymaker in Japan, looking at the present disarray
in Washington, can still take those guarantees for granted?

\<\<Text condensed none omitted\>\>

In the years after World War II and at the height of the Cold War, Japan
was the bulwark of the American presence in Asia. The two countries were
mutually committed to offsetting China's rise and countering the spread
of Communism. Former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone declared that
Japan and the United States shared an "inseparable destiny." Looking
back now, one can see that there were always cracks and potential
ruptures in that "destiny," even if politicians papered them over. After
the war, Japan, not unreasonably, became an international voice for the
cause of peace. Written into its Constitution is a renunciation of war
and the use of force to settle disputes. To some---over one-third of the
public, according to one poll---such language had transformed Japan from
a militaristic state into a pacifist nation with a special mission in
the world. However, others, including influential figures in the
government, interpreted the Constitution as giving Tokyo the leeway to
develop nuclear weapons if necessary. But the issue never developed into
a genuine debate. People in Japan refused to discuss it. As the only
country to be victimized by atomic bombs, many Japanese were
passionately opposed to their use---"Never again!"---or even their
development. John Foster Dulles referred to this as a "nuclear allergy,"
a phrase he used in 1954 after a fishing boat, the Lucky Dragon, was
exposed to radiation from an American thermonuclear test on Bikini
Atoll. The number of people affected was minuscule compared to the
thousands of dead in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Still, it was as if all the
emotions that had been tamped down since 1945 suddenly exploded. Within
a month, the Diet passed a resolution opposing nuclear testing, while a
public petition collected the signatures of more than half of the
country's registered voters in support of the resolution. (The incident
also spurred the production of the movie "Godzilla.") Japan was on its
way to developing an international reputation as "the peace nation," a
designation that made its citizens proud. And in the years that
followed, Japan introduced dozens of resolutions to the United Nations
General Assembly calling for the abolition of nuclear weapons.
Admittedly, there was incontrovertible hypocrisy between Tokyo's
opposition to nuclear weapons while it sheltered under the American
nuclear umbrella. In 2016, New Zealand offered a UN resolution declaring
that nuclear weapons should never be used under any circumstances. It
attracted more than 100 cosponsors, Japan included. At the same time,
eighteen nations backed a competing statement arguing that the use of
nuclear arms might be necessary for reasons of national security. The
two declarations were clearly incompatible. Japan was the only nation to
sign both. But such contradictions didn't bother the pacifist-minded
public. Discussion of nuclear weapons was the third rail of Japanese
politics. "Peace education" was required in public schools, and even the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs funded anti-nuclear programs. Any leader who
suggested a change in policy was bound to pay a political price. Not
even China's first successful nuclear test in 1964 had much of an impact
on public opinion---though it did bring home to many Japanese political
leaders just how dependent the nation was on America and its bombs.
Perhaps the majority of the Japanese people could shield their eyes and
remain complacent. However, government officials charged with
maintaining national security could not afford to ignore the Chinese
threat. A split was emerging between elite opinion and the popular
temper that would only grow in the years to come. It seemed that Japan's
longstanding anti-nuclear stance had become dependent on people who
refused to adapt to a changing international situation, who had learned
nothing and forgotten nothing. Prime Minister Eisaku Sato personified
the division. After the Chinese test, he lamented his countrymen's
policy blinders and said the public had to be educated about the new
realities. This would take time, he thought. Meanwhile, Sato took the
only path open to him. He traveled to Washington to plead with President
Lyndon Johnson to reaffirm America's commitment to Japan's defense.
There was clearly something hat-in-hand, undignified, about Sato's
supplications---the U.S.-Japan alliance was never one of equals---but he
did have one trump card up his sleeve. If Johnson didn't supply the
needed reassurances, he warned, Japan would have to consider developing
its own nuclear weapons. In 1964, public opinion wouldn't have
countenanced that, and Sato no doubt knew it. Yet, the threat was
convincing enough and disruptive enough to get Johnson's attention. He
issued a statement, reiterating it in 1967, that the United States was
prepared to prevent China from employing nuclear weapons. That was what
Sato had hoped for, and it allowed him to then tack in the opposite
direction. When he came home, he transformed from a leader for national
security to a leader for peace. In December 1967, he enunciated what
would become the foundation of Japan's nuclear policy ever since: the
"Three Nonnuclear Principles." Japan would not develop nuclear weapons;
It would not possess nuclear weapons; It would not allow nuclear weapons
to be stationed on its territory. In private, Sato allegedly called the
promises "nonsense." Later, the always ambivalent (or two-faced) Sato
added a fourth pillar, in essence declaring that Japan would adhere to
the Three Principles as long as it retained confidence in America's
nuclear umbrella. For his efforts, he received the Nobel Peace Prize in
1974.

\<\<Paragraph break resumes\>\>

Indeed, [Washington's **reliability** and its **nuclear umbrella** have
always been at the heart of Tokyo's **security policy**]{.underline}.
Posed in its simplest terms, the question is: [Would America be willing
to risk the destruction of **Los Angeles** to protect
**Tokyo**?]{.underline} As the [Chinese and the North Koreans expand
their **nuclear capabilities**, the question has taken on **lethal
pertinence**]{.underline}. As the question grows in importance for
Japan's future, one is forced to look back at the U.S.-Japan alliance
and ask how strong it is or has ever been. Japan has always been the
junior partner. Washington makes a decision, and Tokyo accommodates and
adapts. But should it be satisfied to remain a junior partner?

A historic turning point in the relationship arrived in the early 1970s
when Richard Nixon went to China and took the United States off the gold
standard. These were profound "shocks" to Japan's political and economic
positions. Crucially, they demonstrated to Tokyo that Washington was
prepared to pursue what it perceived to be its national interest, even
if it damaged the interests of its allies. To be sure, the
internationally-minded Nixon offered reassurances to the Japanese
government---and it adapted. Then, America abandoned its ally in South
Vietnam, and Japan adapted. The United States also turned its back on
allies in Iraq and Afghanistan. Again, Japan adapted. [[Washington
failed to support Tokyo]{.mark} when North Korea **kidnapped** Japanese
citizens]{.underline}. It [drew a **"red line"** in Syria and **refused
to uphold** it]{.underline}. It [[withdrew from the **Trans-Pacific
Partnership**]{.mark}, the **Kyoto Protocol** on climate change, and the
nuclear agreement with Iran]{.underline}. It made promises to defend the
integrity of Ukraine, then failed to risk the lives of its own troops
after the Russian invasion. Just how much can Tokyo trust any promises
coming out of Washington?

What's more, Japanese doubts are double-edged. If they have serious
concerns about the United States doing too little, they also worry about
it doing too much. In the years since the collapse of the Soviet Union,
the United States has proved to be impetuous and sanctimonious,
canceling agreements with Russia, invading Iraq and Afghanistan, and
intervening in Libya with little consideration of the long-term
consequences. By tying their security to the decisions of impulsive and
unreliable leaders in Washington, the Japanese are allowing themselves
to be whipsawed. This is not a condition any country should have to live
with, certainly not one as powerful as Japan.

[Perhaps **no other issue** reveals the **uncertainty** and **weakness**
of the U.S.-Japanese **alliance** at present as the vulnerability of the
**Senkaku Islands** in the East China Sea, claimed both by Japan and
Chi]{.underline}na (where they are known as the Diaoyu Islands). A
[full-scale attack on Japan by [China]{.mark} is
**unimaginable**]{.underline}, but [gradual **[encroachments]{.mark}**
that [shift]{.mark} the [balance of power in]{.mark} the
**[Senkakus]{.mark}** are another matter]{.underline}. This dispute has
continued for decades. Yet, in recent years, as the [nuclear-armed
Chinese have [grown **stronger militarily**]{.mark}, they have [become
more **assertive**]{.mark}, sending Coast Guard patrols into what they
claim are "Chinese territorial waters]{.underline}," and scrambling
their aircraft overhead. There are about [[two dozen Chinese]{.mark}
military [bases within range of]{.mark} the **[Senkakus]{.mark}**, but
[only four **U.S. and Japanese**]{.mark} **bases**]{.underline}.

Apart from this growing disparity, the larger question for Tokyo is how
reliable an ally Washington would be if the dispute developed into a
full-scale crisis. Would Americans be willing to shed blood for dots in
the ocean they have never heard of? Examples like Ukraine offer no
comfort. And it should be remembered that Japan has territorial
disagreements with Russia as well. No single dispute may be enough to
trigger an all-out war with either China or North Korea (or Russia). But
is [it time for [Japan]{.mark} to consider its own **nuclear
[deterrent]{.mark}** to replace the American **deterrent** and
**[neutralize]{.mark}** the **salami tactics** of its
[enemies]{.mark}]{.underline}?

Since the end of World War II, there have been two broad foundations to
its "nuclear allergy" ---and both have been steadily eroding. The
growing threats in Asia have already brought into question the first
foundation, the reliability of the American nuclear umbrella. The second
is Japanese public opinion, with its traditionally profound aversion to
nuclear weapons. But, like everything else in East Asia, that has been
changing, too. Recent polls point in different directions at once. Some
show the majority of Japanese are losing faith in the alliance with
America. Others indicate that reliance on Washington's nuclear umbrella
remains strong. Japan seems to be a nation suffering from cognitive
dissonance. As everyone knows, polls provide only a snapshot of public
opinion (and depend on the way a question is posed). They tell us little
about trends. But the trends in Japan all seem to be pointing in one
direction.

The generation with personal memories of Hiroshima and Nagasaki is dying
out, while younger generations appear to be more receptive to a nuclear
Japan. [Nuclear weapons are no longer a **taboo subject**]{.underline}.
When the [North Koreans fired a missile across **Japanese territory**
toward the end of the last century]{.underline}, that was a
history-changing event comparable to what the Americans experienced when
the Soviets launched Sputnik in 1957. Suddenly, the [entire country
seemed at risk and began to reconsider its options]{.underline}. The
[**perceived threats** only **increased** in the twenty-first
century]{.underline}, most notably with the North Korean nuclear test in
2006 and repeated flights of North Korean missiles over Japanese
territory. By 2022, after the Russians invaded Ukraine, despite American
promises of protection, an overwhelming majority of Japanese were ready
to debate the subject of nuclear weapons after decades of willed
silence.

How will a [**[great-power nuclear]{.mark} [war]{.mark}**
erupt]{.underline}? How can its outbreak be prevented? These questions
have bedeviled nuclear strategists and peace advocates since the dawn of
the Atomic Age and are [[gaining]{.mark} fresh **[urgency]{.mark}** as
[tensions among **China**]{.mark}, Russia, and the **[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates **[intensify]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Theorists generally assume that such a horrific cataclysm would occur
when the major powers have amassed large nuclear arsenals, have primed
these weapons for early use, and have reached a fever pitch of
hostility. Under these conditions, it is feared, any [outbreak of
**armed [hostilities]{.mark}** could [lead]{.mark} swiftly [to]{.mark} a
[**clash** of]{.mark} **major [conventional forces]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark}, were one side or another to face overwhelming defeat, the
[**early use** of]{.mark} **[nuc]{.mark}**lear
weapon**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Historically, it was believed that such incidents would arise along
NATO-Soviet borders or in the North Atlantic, where the warships of the
major powers often crossed paths. To avert a nuclear catastrophe, global
leaders labored over the years to reduce tensions among the major powers
through U.S.-Soviet summits, UN sessions, intense diplomacy, and so
forth and to reduce the size and alert status of their nuclear arsenals.
Unfortunately, less effort has been directed at identifying potential
flashpoints and reducing the risk of uncontrolled escalatory spirals.

This lack of attention is especially critical in the current era of
great power competition, says Michael O'Hanlon of the Brookings
Institution in his new book The Senkaku Paradox: Risking Great Power War
Over Small Stakes. He claims that although the probability of a
deliberate, full-scale military assault by one of the major powers
against another is extremely low, [significant risks remain for **minor
aggressions** to **escalate quickly**]{.underline}. There is
considerable potential for a limited Russian intrusion into one of the
Baltic republics or a Chinese seizure of a Japanese-claimed island in
the East China Sea to spin out of control, possibly triggering the use
of nuclear weapons.

Under existing U.S. military doctrine, he explains, any assault on a
NATO country or a U.S. treaty ally, however trivial, should
automatically prompt a full-scale military drive to reverse the
intrusion and punish the aggressor. Such an endeavor would require a
full-scale mobilization of U.S. and allied forces and still might not
succeed, or if it did, it might so alarm enemy officials that they might
resort to launching nuclear weapons. Fearing such an outcome, U.S.
leaders might allow the original intrusion to stand, thereby
jeopardizing U.S. alliances and inviting further aggression, with every
likelihood that all-out war would eventually follow.

This, he explains, is what constitutes the "**[Senkaku
paradox]{.underline}**": [In the event of a **limited enemy
aggression**]{.underline}, say [in the uninhabited **[Senkaku]{.mark}
Island[s]{.mark}** of the **E**ast **C**hina **S**ea]{.underline}, "[a
[large-scale U.S.]{.mark} and **allied [response]{.mark}** could
[seem]{.mark} massively **[disproportionate]{.mark}**]{.underline}." [On
the other hand, "a [nonresponse]{.mark} would [be
**unacceptable**]{.mark}, and **inconsistent** with American treaty
obligations]{.underline}." What is needed are credible responses that
fall between the extremes of acquiescence to aggression and military
escalation.

O'Hanlon proposes an "asymmetric defense" consisting of economic
penalties and limited military actions. These could include sanctions
aimed at critical nodes of the aggressor's economy, such as energy,
banking, and transport, along with air and missile strikes against key
logistical targets, such as pipelines, port facilities, and oil tankers.
At the same time, the United States and its allies would reinforce
defense positions near the initial conflict. The aim of all this would
not be to reverse the original intrusion but rather to demonstrate that
any further aggression would be met with intensified economic hardship
and a brutal confrontation with U.S. and allied armies.

In assessing U.S. strategic options, O'Hanlon focuses on three potential
flashpoints: the Baltic region, the East China Sea, and Taiwan. Of all
conceivable war-igniting scenarios involving the great powers, he
suggests, the most likely are a Russian attempt to seize a sliver of
eastern Estonia or Latvia, where Russian speakers are in the majority; a
Chinese occupation of one of the Senkaku Islands, claimed both by China,
which calls them the Diaoyu's, and Japan; and a Chinese naval blockade
of Taiwan to thwart any Taiwanese move toward independence.

In any of these scenarios, O'Hanlon claims, U.S. military policy would
presuppose a rapid and harsh response. Yet, any U.S. drive to dislodge
Russian or Chinese forces from those locations would require a major
commitment of force and, given recent improvements in those countries'
combat capabilities (especially through the acquisition of high-tech
weaponry), might not prove easy to accomplish. A U.S. victory would be
the most likely outcome, but could prompt Russia or China to employ
nuclear weapons. Far better, he argues, to counter such assaults with
asymmetric moves, such as attacks on vital energy infrastructure located
outside the Russian or Chinese heartland, along with the reinforcement
of positions in areas near the original intrusion.

O'Hanlon deserves credit for seeking credible alternatives to all-out
war as a response to low-stakes challenges of these sorts. His emphasis
on economic tools of coercion, as opposed to full-scale military
mobilization, merits close attention by U.S. strategists. He also
performs an important service by shining a spotlight on those potential
flashpoints. Clearly, unless [greater effort is made to understand and
defuse the sources of friction in all three, other efforts to avert
catastrophe could come to naught]{.underline}.

That said, many of his recommendations deserve careful scrutiny. Would
Russian or Chinese leaders consider attacks on their energy facilities
and logistical chokepoints as acceptable retribution? Perhaps such moves
would incite them to undertake even harsher countermeasures of their
own. To punish China for any future misbehavior in the East China Sea or
in waters off Taiwan, for example, he proposes blocking Chinese oil
imports from the Persian Gulf, a venture that he estimates will require
four to six U.S. aircraft carriers and supporting vessels and would
likely initiate a major naval conflict in the Indo-Pacific region.
Although certainly superior to the immediate onset of full-scale war,
asymmetrical moves of this sort do not necessarily promise a pacific
outcome. Surely, O'Hanlon could have devoted more attention to
preventative and diplomatic endeavors, such as confidence-building
measures and power-sharing arrangements, such as for the Senkaku/Diaoyu
Islands.

Indeed, the deeper lesson to be drawn from The [Senkaku Paradox is the
[difficulty in envisioning]{.mark} any [outcomes]{.mark} from future
U.S.-Russian or **U.S.-Chinese military encounters** [that do not
risk]{.mark} a **[nuclear escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Modern
conventional weapons are capable of inflicting immense damage on vital
military infrastructure, including, conceivably, nuclear
command-and-control facilities, so it is easy to envision Russia or
China responding with battlefield nuclear weapons.

[**Asymmetric responses** are a welcome contribution to the discussion
of **alternative options**]{.underline}, but a [far more thorough
reassessment of U.S. strategy is [required]{.mark}]{.underline}, [aimed
at [reducing]{.mark} U.S. [risk of]{.mark} **military
[entanglement]{.mark}** [in **far-off hotspots**]{.mark}]{.underline}
and putting more space between conventional combat and the onset of
nuclear war.

Presumptively, both Japan and China consider these land masses to be
islands, otherwise they would not be in such a heated battle, each
assuming that it will be able to extend its EEZ if it gains control. But
[[China]{.mark} refuses to **negotiate**]{.underline}.149 China asserts
similar claims over island chains in the South China Sea without
negotiating. 150 China [[feels no **incentive** to negotiate]{.mark},
[as]{.mark} its [power relative to]{.mark} the [countries who also
**assert claims**]{.mark} to these island chains
(**Japan**]{.underline}, the Philippines, Vietnam, Indonesia, etc.) [[is
**very strong**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In fact, China's [[refusal to
**arbitrate ownership**]{.mark} of the islands]{.underline} is in direct
breach of UNCLOS. 151 Given China's lack of willingness to comply with
international obligations and China's manifestation of power as a means
of settling international disputes, [Japan's [**acquisition** of]{.mark}
**[nuc]{.mark}**lear weapon**[s]{.mark}** would [balance China's]{.mark}
power and [ensure]{.mark} the **continued [relevance]{.mark}** and
**implementation** [of]{.mark} international [agreements]{.mark}
**governing** disputes [in Asia]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Some may argue that acquisition of defensive nuclear weapons may not
actually help Japan feel more secure in its strategic
position---defensive nuclear weapons would not allow Japan to exert
affirmative force on other countries to act---they would only allow
responsive measures should Japan be threatened. However, this argument
misses a key element of the solution: [acquisition of defensive nuclear
weapons could help [bring Japan into]{.mark} the fold of [**NATO** to
become]{.mark} the [first **Asian

[**Sino-Japanese Tensions** Will Escalate in the **E**ast **C**hina
**S**ea]{.underline}

In early March 2024, [the Japanese Air Self-Defense Force **scrambled
fighter jets** in response to **suspected airspace intrusions** in the
East China Sea]{.underline}. This is [part of a decades-long dispute
between China and Japan regarding competing claims over the
**Senkaku**/Diaoyu **Islands**]{.underline}. While, at present, neither
side seeks an extreme escalation of tensions, [**conflict** is
**increasingly likely** within the next decade]{.underline}.

Analysis

The Senkaku Islands (referred to as Diaoyu Islands in China) are a
potential flashpoint for conflict in the next decade. Currently, Japan
administers the islands, while China claims sovereignty over them. [Both
sides endow the islands with **national significance**, have increased
their **military presence** in the region, and rely on **inadequate
mechanisms** to avoid **costly escalation**]{.underline}. When conflict
erupts, it [will have far-reaching **implications** for the geopolitical
landscape of **East Asia** and beyond]{.underline}.

Nationalism and National Pride

The Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands are a symbol of deeply rooted national pride
for both Tokyo and Beijing. In 2012, the Consul Generals of Japan and
China in Sydney engaged in a diplomatic argument through official
communications detailing their respective governments\' positions
regarding the dispute. Tokyo asserts that the Senkaku Islands were terra
nullius and peacefully annexed in 1879, while Beijing argues that Japan
seized the Diaoyus through military aggression during the first
Sino-Japanese War. Further complicating matters, both Consul Generals
outlined differing understandings of a series of international
agreements signed after World War II. According to Beijing, the islands
are a part of the rogue Taiwan province and were returned to China as
part of the Cairo Declaration and Potsdam Proclamation; neither
explicitly mentions the islands. According to Tokyo, the islands are
independent of Taiwan and were put under Japanese administrative control
following a series of international agreements between Japan and the US;
China was not a party to these agreements. These contrasting narratives
set the stage for the disputed future of the islands.

Recent public opinion polling emphasizes the dispute\'s influence on
forming nationalist attitudes and worsening tensions between the two
nations. A 2023 Genron NPO survey revealed a deepening of nationalist
sentiment in Japan and China regarding the dispute. It revealed that
92.2% of Japanese participants (up from 87.3%) and 62.9% of Chinese
participants (up from 62.6%) have unfavorable opinions of the other
country. A similar poll in 2021 indicated that 56.7% and 62.4% say their
negative views are due to the ongoing territorial dispute.

Escalating Tensions and Military Presence

[Both countries\' **ongoing military build-up** and assertive posturing
indicate that tensions in the East China Sea will likely
persist]{.underline}. [Japanese control of the territory remained
largely **undisputed** until 2010]{.underline}, when, in September of
that year, a Chinese fishing vessel and a Japanese Coast Guard ship were
involved in a collision near the islands. Since then, both nations have
steadily increased their military presence in the area. Instances of
Chinese Coast Guard (CCG) patrols in the contiguous waters around the
islands reached an all-time high in 2023 with 1,287 incursions,
including a 134-day uninterrupted presence. [Meanwhile, the Japanese
expanded their **military presence** in the Ryukyu archipelago to deter
Chinese actions in the ECS]{.underline}.

This escalation was further intensified in November 2023 when President
[**Xi Jinping** instructed the CCG to \"**constantly strengthen**\"
Beijing\'s regional claims]{.underline}. Consequently, the CCG\'s East
China Sea Command formulated plans to maintain a daily presence in the
contested waters throughout 2024 and began warning the Japanese
Self-Defense Forces to vacate the waters and airspace around the
islands. Tokyo immediately responded to this development through
diplomatic channels in an apparent attempt to avoid further
deterioration of the already tenuous bilateral relationship.

Conflict De-escalation Mechanisms

Due to practical and design limitations, the [effectiveness of existing
de-escalation mechanisms remains **uncertain**]{.underline}. In April
2014, naval forces across the Pacific, including China and Japan,
endorsed the Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES). This code
prescribes conduct protocols and communication strategies to maintain
safety during unforeseen interactions. However, no bilateral drills have
occurred to ensure the respective militaries understand its application.
Without the necessary exercises, militaries are left to apply the method
during real-time disputes, often under heightened tensions.

In May 2018, the two nations agreed to implement the Maritime and Aerial
Communication Mechanism (MACM), which became active in March 2023. They
designed the MACM to avoid unintended and potentially escalatory
encounters between their military forces. However, the MACM only
established communication between the defense authorities, not military
members. These limitations leave the possibility of conflict at the
tactical level, suggesting that more comprehensive measures may be
needed for effective conflict prevention.

Shifting Regional Power Dynamics

The [**C**hinese **C**ommunist **P**arty aims to achieve military
modernization to counter **US military primacy** and shift the regional
balance of power in its favor]{.underline}. The US-Japan Security
Treaty, US military bases in Japan, and successive [US presidents
recognizing Japan\'s administrative control over the Senkaku Islands
have **deterred** Chinese aggression **thus far**]{.underline}.
Moreover, China\'s strategic focus on Taiwan requires the bulk of its
resources, mitigating the current threat of a protracted conflict with
Japan. However, [by 2035, the geopolitical landscape of **East Asia**
will shift as the People\'s Liberation Army achieves its **modernization
efforts** and could move to gain control over **Taiwan** by force,
should **diplomacy fail**]{.underline}. [As a result, Japan\'s claim to
the islands will be **increasingly challenged** by a more **confident**
and **assertive** China]{.underline}.

Conclusion

National pride rooted in 150 years of history, 15 years of escalating
tensions, the [inevitable shift in **regional power dynamics**, and the
inherent limitations in **real-time crisis management mechanisms** make
conflict between Japan and China over the **Senkaku**/Diaoyu Islands
increasingly likely]{.underline}. The [escalation of the **ongoing
standoff** will reshape international affairs]{.underline}.

The world is still grappling with and adjusting to this [potential
**geopolitical shift**. In the Indo-Pacific, responses are likely to be
mixed. U.S. **allies and close partners** may voice **deep
concerns,**]{.underline} but the vast majority of countries will
probably convey cautious optimism that nuclear-armed rivals are on
speaking terms and trying to peacefully work out their differences. This
is particularly true for those Indo-Pacific nations perpetually worried
about being stuck in the middle.

At the same time, however, these [**nonaligned countries** of the Global
South may worry that the prospects for their **hedging
strategies**---whereby they reap benefits from playing the great powers
off each other---could **significantly diminish.**]{.underline}

[The United States\' allies in northeast Asia---**Japan and South
Korea**---will likely express **deep reservations** about what appears
to be the new U.S. strategy]{.underline}. Since the outset of the
Russia-Ukraine war, [Tokyo has strongly supported the Biden
administration\'s position by signing onto and enforcing U.S.-led
sanctions against Moscow.]{.underline}

J[apan has also been worried about the "no limits" strategic partnership
between Russia and China, which could become a **force multiplier** in
future Indo-Pacific conflicts, whether over the Kuril Islands, the
Senkaku Islands]{.underline} (known as the Diaoyu Islands in China),
[Taiwan, South Korea, or the South China Sea]{.underline}. Tokyo was
unnerved in November, for example, when China and Russia deployed
strategic bombers in a joint air patrol over the Sea of Japan.

But [Japan is primarily concerned that a refreshed U.S.-China
relationship will **embolden Beijing to seize disputed islands**, such
as the Senkakus, or attack Taiwan, which might **require** **Japanese
intervention** to ensure the security of the Ryukyu Islands---Japanese
territory]{.underline} with a westernmost island located [just 68 miles
from the coast of Taiwan.]{.underline}

[South Korea is almost exclusively focused on the **threat from North
Korea** and could face enormous strategic consequences if Washington
improved ties with Beijing, Moscow, or both.]{.underline} Were
Washington to prioritize coordination with these two rather than
[Seoul,]{.underline} the latter [might **lose significant leverage**
when dealing with the North Korean regime]{.underline}.

[The United States could also look the other way on North Korean
**military assistance to Russia** in Ukraine, enabling Pyongyang to
further battle-harden its troops for a potential war on the Korean
Peninsula.]{.underline} Additionally, [neither Beijing nor Moscow would
feel as much pressure to pursue the **denuclearization** of North Korea,
which might even get **United Nations sanctions relief** with U.S.
consent.]{.underline}

[The Asian country that]{.underline} perhaps [has the most to lose would
be **Taiwan**. As a long-standing strategic partner, Taipei has
always]{.underline} hoped---and possibly [**expected**---that Washington
would **intervene militarily** if Beijing ever attacked the
island.]{.underline}

Indeed, [U.S. President Joe Biden **publicly noted** on four separate
occasions that the U.S. military would assist Taipei]{.underline} in
such a scenario, effectively [moving Washington away from]{.underline}
its position of "[strategic ambiguity" to one of **strategic
clarity**.]{.underline}

But [if U.S.-China ties were to improve]{.underline}, then [Taiwan would
wonder whether]{.underline} Biden\'s [commitments still
hold]{.underline}. And of course, [any U.S. accommodation with the
Kremlin]{.underline} on Ukraine that sees Russia retaining conquered
territory [will surely **create panic** in Taiwan over Washington\'s
interest in its **security** and continued sovereignty.]{.underline}

In Southeast Asia, the reaction to any U.S. detente with China and
Russia would probably be overwhelmingly positive, as nearly all of these
states seek to avoid becoming ensnared in great-power competition and
possibly war in their region. The United States\' key strategic
partners---Indonesia, Singapore, and Vietnam---already maintain strictly
nonaligned foreign policies that eschew choosing one great power over
another. To the contrary, their strategy has been one of hedging with
the great powers to protect themselves.

Vietnam, for example, is the only country in the world since Russia
invaded Ukraine to have welcomed Biden, Xi, and Putin for summits. Other
countries in the region, such as Brunei and Malaysia, would similarly
welcome a shift. Cambodia and Laos are already entrenched in China\'s
strategic orbit and may expect even greater benefits if Washington and
Beijing get along. The junta in Myanmar, which is fighting an ongoing
civil war, maintains close security ties to both China and Russia, so a
U.S. strategy shift would likely be embraced there as well. Even
Thailand, a U.S. treaty ally, would likely endorse better U.S.-China
ties, because Bangkok does not share Washington\'s urgency to address
the China threat.

Of all Southeast Asian countries, only [the **Philippines**---another
U.S. security ally---would surely lose from a major shift in U.S.
strategy toward China and Russia. For decades, Manila has been **forced
to confront Beijing\'s encroachments** into its exclusive economic zone
in the South China Sea,]{.underline} most notably in the Spratly Islands
and at Scarborough Shoal.

[Beijing\'s blatant disregard for international law and norms has
resulted in many **dangerous incidents** at sea involving **gray-zone**
tactics by Chinese coast guard vessels and a militarized fishing
fleet.]{.underline} This has [especially]{.underline} been the case
[when Manila periodically attempts to resupply its troops]{.underline}
on the World War II-era Sierra Madre tank landing ship at Second Thomas
Shoal. [In response, the United States and Philippines have taken many
steps to strengthen their alliance to enhance
deterrence]{.underline}---for example, [by **expanding** the number of
**Philippine bases**]{.underline} that [the U.S. military can deploy
to]{.underline} from five to [nine. If Washington and Beijing were to
have a closer relationship,]{.underline} then Manila [would naturally
**worry** about the ramifications for the alliance.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, in South Asia, another key U.S. strategic
partner---India---would surely embrace better U.S.-Russia ties, although
it might fret over closer U.S.-China relations. One of the few constant
frictions in U.S.-India ties, particularly since the Kremlin\'s invasion
of Ukraine, has been the doggedness of the India-Russia strategic
partnership, including new security arrangements signed by Indian Prime
Minister Narendra Modi and Putin in Moscow last year. A better
U.S.-Russia relationship would make that source of friction go away.

[On China, **India** is much more wary]{.underline}. In October, New
Delhi and Beijing peacefully resolved their land border standoff and
began the process of de-escalating ties. But [the heavy emphasis on
**defense cooperation** during Modi\'s visit to the White House in
mid-February strongly suggests that India sees the United States as the
primary power to help it **balance against China.**]{.underline} Hence,
[closer U.S. ties to China will be viewed with **suspicion** in New
Delhi.]{.underline}

All other South Asian countries---Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, the
Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka---are very likely to
enthusiastically applaud improved great-power relations. As in Southeast
Asia, they are simply looking for a more peaceful and stable environment
for socioeconomic development.

Of those countries, however, Bangladesh and Pakistan might be happier
than the rest. Bangladesh, whose ties with India are under strain since
a political transition in Dhaka last August, has in recent months
increasingly turned to China for support---and less so, Russia. For
decades, Pakistan has maintained an "iron brotherhood" with China, and
in recent years it has sought to leverage Russian assistance as well,
particularly to build a gas pipeline from Karachi to Lahore as well as
to engage in joint military exercises and counterterrorism cooperation.

In Oceania, [the **Solomon Islands** demonstrates the possible **loss of
bargaining leverage** if the great powers suddenly get along
better.]{.underline} Before signing [a security agreement with
China]{.underline} in 2022, the Solomon Islands enjoyed being [the
**center of attention** as the United States]{.underline} and its
friends [rushed to dissuade it from proceeding with the
deal]{.underline}. In the end, Washington would not or could not offer
anything better than Beijing, so the Solomon Islands went forward with
the deal.

[It is precisely these types of opportunities that **smaller and
middle-sized countries** all across the Indo-Pacific will **miss out**
on if there is a U.S. shift in the future.]{.underline} Overall in
Oceania, however, improved U.S. ties to China and Russia would generally
be welcomed, as small Pacific island countries have become increasingly
wary of intensifying great-power competition.

The [exceptions are]{.underline}, of course, [**Australia** and New
Zealand]{.underline}---a U.S. security ally and close partner,
respectively. In recent years, **[Canberra]{.underline}** has
[identified Beijing as its **top geostrategic threat** and bolstered its
alliance with Washington,]{.underline} not least by [deepening its
engagement through the **Quadrilateral Security Dialogue** and by
signing the Australia-U.K.-U.S. security pact.]{.underline}

[**New Zealand\'s** worries]{.underline}, too, [are
growing]{.underline}. Last month, for instance, [the **Cook
Islands**]{.underline}---a sovereign nation that is [supposed to consult
with Wellington]{.underline} on security matters, according to a
long-standing free association agreement---[decided]{.underline} without
consultation [to ink a **new deal with China** to enhance]{.underline}
the latter\'s [maritime presence]{.underline} on the islands. Chinese
warships also recently conducted a live-fire exercise in the Tasman Sea
between Australia and New Zealand, [heightening fears that Beijing
sees]{.underline} a [forward presence in Oceania]{.underline} as a
strategic necessity.

[Mongolia and North Korea are likely to both oppose and undermine
U.S.-Russia or U.S.-China detente]{.underline}, but for opposite
reasons. [For **Mongolia**, which is **geographically
squeezed**]{.underline} between Russia and China and constantly hedging
with both to ensure its survival, [the United States has always been a
very **useful "third neighbor**" to balance the two]{.underline}.
Without Washington, [Ulaanbaatar would lose critical leverage. **North
Korea**]{.underline} has the same problem but in reverse: It [needs
China and Russia to **resist** the United States]{.underline}, but [a
**friendlier** great-power dynamic]{.underline} [could seriously
**jeopardize**]{.underline} this strategy.

#### That [turns]{.underline} and massively [outweighs]{.underline} the AFF---It's an [unprecedented]{.underline} and [seismic shift]{.underline}. Sparks regional balancing, proliferation by allies in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East which goes nuclear, empowers right-wing nationalists, and causes wars that ultimately [draw the US back in]{.underline}.

[For seven decades, U.S. grand strategy was characterized by a
bipartisan consensus on]{.underline} [the United States' global
role]{.underline}. Although successive administrations had major
disagreements over the details, [Democrats and Republicans alike backed
a system of alliances]{.underline}, the forward positioning of forces, a
relatively open international economy, and, albeit imperfectly, the
principles of freedom, human rights, and democracy. Today, that
consensus has broken down.

President Donald Trump has questioned the utility of the United States'
alliances and its forward military presence in Europe, Asia, and the
Middle East. He has displayed little regard for a shared community of
free societies and is drawn to authoritarian leaders. [**So far,
[Trump]{.mark}'s views are not shared** by the **vast majority of
leading Republicans**. Almost **all leading Democrats**]{.underline},
for their part, [are **committed** to the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates' [traditional role in
Europe and Asia]{.underline}, if not in the Middle East. Trump has
struggled to convert his worldview into policy, and in many respects,
[his administration has **[increased U.S.]{.mark} military
[commitments]{.mark}**. [But]{.mark}]{.underline} if Trump wins
reelection, [that **[could change quick]{.mark}ly**]{.underline}, as he
would feel more empowered and Washington would need to adjust to the
reality that Americans had reconfirmed their support for a more
inward-looking approach to world affairs. At a private speech in
November, according to press reports, John Bolton, Trump's former
national security adviser, even predicted that Trump could pull out of
NATO in a second term. The receptiveness of the American people to
Trump's "America first" rhetoric has revealed that there is a market for
a foreign policy in which the United States plays a smaller role in the
world.

Amid the shifting political winds, a growing chorus of voices in the
policy community, from the left and the right, is calling for a strategy
of global retrenchment, whereby the United States would withdraw its
forces from around the world and reduce its security commitments.
Leading scholars and policy experts, such as Barry Posen and Ian
Bremmer, have called on the United States to significantly reduce its
role in Europe and Asia, including withdrawing from NATO. In 2019, a new
think tank, the Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft, set up
shop, with funding from the conservative Charles Koch Foundation and the
liberal philanthropist George Soros. Its mission, in its own words, is
to advocate "a new foreign policy centered on diplomatic engagement and
military restraint."

[Global [**retrenchment** is]{.mark}]{.underline} fast emerging as
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} most coherent and ready-made
[[alternative]{.mark} to the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates' [postwar strategy]{.underline}. [Yet **pursuing it
would be [a grave mistake]{.mark}**]{.underline}. By [dissolving U.S.
alliances]{.underline} and ending the forward presence of U.S. forces,
this strategy [would **[destabilize]{.mark} the [regional
security]{.mark} orders** in **Europe** and **Asia**]{.underline}. It
would also [[increase]{.mark} the risk of **[nuclear
prolif]{.mark}eration**]{.underline}, [[empower **right-wing
nationalists**]{.underline}]{.mark} in Europe, [[and aggravate]{.mark}
the threat of **[major-power conflict]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

This is not to say that U.S. strategy should never change.
[The]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has
regularly increased and decreased its presence around the world as
threats have risen and ebbed]{.underline}. Even though Washington
followed a strategy of containment throughout the Cold War, that took
various forms, which meant the difference between war and peace in
Vietnam, between an arms race and arms control, and between détente and
an all-out attempt to defeat the Soviets. After the fall of the Soviet
Union, the United States changed course again, expanding its alliances
to include many countries that had previously been part of the Warsaw
Pact.

Likewise, [the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[will now]{.underline} have to [do less in some areas and more in others
as it shifts]{.underline} its focus [from]{.underline} counterterrorism
and reform in [the Middle East to]{.underline}ward great-power
[competition with China and Russia. But]{.underline} **[[advocates
of]{.underline}]{.mark}** global [**[retrenchment]{.mark}**
are]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** [so much proposing **changes
within a strategy**]{.underline} [as they are [call]{.mark}ing
[for]{.mark} the **[wholesale replacement]{.mark}**]{.underline} [of one
that has **been in place [since W]{.mark}orld War
[II]{.mark}**]{.underline}. What the United States needs now is a
careful pruning of its overseas commitments---not [the]{.underline}
indiscriminate [**[abandonment]{.underline}** [of a strategy
that]{.underline}]{.mark} [has **[served it well for
decades]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

RETRENCHMENT REDUX

Support for retrenchment stems from the view that the United States has
overextended itself in countries that have little bearing on its
national interest. According to this perspective, which is closely
associated with the realist school of international relations, the
United States is fundamentally secure thanks to its geography, nuclear
arsenal, and military advantage. Yet the country has nonetheless chosen
to pursue a strategy of "liberal hegemony," using force in an unwise
attempt to perpetuate a liberal international order (one that, as
evidenced by U.S. support for authoritarian regimes, is not so liberal,
after all). Washington, the argument goes, has distracted itself with
costly overseas commitments and interventions that breed resentment and
encourage free-riding abroad.

**[Critics]{.underline}** of the status quo **[argue]{.underline}** that
[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[must take two steps]{.underline} to change its ways[. The first
is]{.underline} retrenchment itself: the action of
**[withdraw]{.underline}**ing **[from]{.underline}** many of
**[the]{.underline}** **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates'
[**existing commitments**, such as]{.underline} the ongoing military
interventions in the Middle East and [one-sided alliances in Europe and
Asia]{.underline}. [The second is restraint]{.underline}: [the strategy
of]{.underline} [**defining U.S. interests narrowly**, refusing to
launch wars unless vital interests are directly threatened]{.underline}
[and Congress authorizes such action, compelling other nations to take
care of their own security, and relying more on diplomatic, economic,
and political tools]{.underline}.

[In practice, this]{.underline} approach [means]{.underline} [ending
U.S. military operations]{.underline} in Afghanistan, withdrawing U.S.
forces from the Middle East, relying on an over-the-horizon force that
can uphold U.S. national interests, [and no longer **taking on
responsibility** for the **security of other states**]{.underline}. As
for alliances, [[Posen]{.mark} has [argued]{.mark} that [the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[should
**abandon**]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[mutual-defense]{.underline}]{.mark}** provision [**of NATO**,
**replace**]{.underline} [the organization "with a **new, more limited**
security]{.underline} cooperation [agreement," and **reduce U.S.
commitments to Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan**]{.underline}. On the
question of China, realists have split in recent years. Some, such as
the scholar John Mearsheimer, contend that even as the United States
retrenches elsewhere, in Asia, it must contain the threat of China,
whereas others, such as Posen, argue that nations in the region are
perfectly capable of doing the job themselves.

Since Trump's election, some progressive foreign policy thinkers have
joined the retrenchment camp. They diverge from other progressives, who
advocate maintaining the United States' current role. Like the realists,
progressive retrenchers hold the view that the United States is safe
because of its geography and the size of its military. Where these
progressives break from the realists, however, is on the question of
what will happen if the United States pulls back. While the realists
favoring retrenchment have few illusions about the sort of regional
competition that will break out in the absence of U.S. dominance, the
progressives expect that the world will become more peaceful and
cooperative, because Washington can still manage tensions through
diplomatic, economic, and political tools. The immediate focus of the
progressives is the so-called forever wars---U.S. military involvement
in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, and the broader war on terrorism---as well
as the defense budget and overseas bases.

Although the progressives have a less developed vision of how to
implement retrenchment than the realists, they do provide some
guideposts. Stephen Wertheim, a co-founder of the Quincy Institute, has
called for bringing home many of the U.S. soldiers serving abroad,
"leaving small forces to protect commercial sea lanes," as part of an
effort to "deprive presidents of the temptation to answer every problem
with a violent solution." He argues that U.S. allies may believe that
the United States has been inflating regional threats and thus conclude
that they do not need to increase their conventional or nuclear forces.
Another progressive thinker, Peter Beinart, has argued that the United
States should accept Chinese and Russian spheres of influence, a
strategy that would include abandoning Taiwan.

IS LESS REALLY MORE?

The realists and the progressives arguing for retrenchment differ in
their assumptions, logic, and intentions. The realists tend to be more
pessimistic about the prospects for peace and frame their arguments in
hardheaded terms, whereas the progressives downplay the consequences of
American withdrawal and make a moral case against the current grand
strategy. But [they]{.underline} share a common [claim: that the United
States would be better off if it]{.underline} dramatically [reduced
its]{.underline} global military footprint and [security
commitments.]{.underline}

**[This is a false promise]{.underline}**, for a number of reasons.
First, retrenchment would worsen regional security competition in Europe
and Asia. The realists recognize that [the U.S. military presence in
Europe and Asia does **dampen security competition**]{.underline}, but
[they claim that]{.underline} it does so at too high a price---and one
that, at any rate, should be paid by U.S. allies in the regions
themselves. [Although]{.underline} [[pulling back]{.mark} would
**[invite regional security competition]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [realist
retrenchers **admit**]{.underline}, the United States could be safer in
a more dangerous world because [regional rivals would **check** one
another]{.underline}. [This is [a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[perilous
gambit]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [however, because [regional
conflicts]{.mark} **often end up [implicat]{.mark}ing [U.S.
interests]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [They might thus **end up [drawing the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [back in]{.mark} after it has
left**---resulting in a **much [more dangerous]{.mark} venture** [than
**heading off**]{.mark} **the [conflict in the first place]{.mark} by
staying**]{.underline}. [Realist retrenchment reveals a **hubris** that
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [can
control consequences and **prevent crises from erupting into
war.**]{.underline}

A U.S. pullback from Europe or Asia is more likely to embolden regional
powers.

The progressives' view of regional security is similarly flawed. These
retrenchers reject the idea that regional security competition will
intensify if the United States leaves. In fact, they argue, U.S.
alliances often promote competition, as [in the Middle
East]{.underline}, where [U.S. support]{.underline} for Saudi Arabia and
the United Arab Emirates [has **emboldened**]{.underline} those
[countries in their cold war with Iran.]{.underline} [But **this logic
does not apply to Europe or Asia**]{.underline}, [where **U.S. [allies
have behaved responsibly]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [A **U.S.
[pullback]{.mark}** from those places [is **more likely to
embolden**]{.mark} the regional powers. Since 2008, Russia has invaded
two]{.underline} of its [neighbors]{.underline} that are [not members of
NATO]{.underline}, [and [if the Baltic]{.mark} states [were **no longer
protected by**]{.mark} **a [U.S]{.mark}. security
[guarantee]{.mark}**]{.underline}, it is conceivable that [**[Russia
would test the boundaries]{.mark}** with gray-zone warfare. In East
Asia, a U.S. withdrawal would force [Japan]{.mark} to **[increase its
defense]{.mark} capabilities**]{.underline} [and **change its
constitution** to enable it to **compete with China on its own**,
**straining relations with South Korea**]{.underline}.

The [second]{.underline} problem with retrenchment involves **[[nuclear
prolif]{.mark}eration]{.underline}**. [If the United States pulled out
of NATO or ended its alliance with Japan]{.underline}, as many realist
advocates of retrenchment recommend, some of [**its [allies]{.mark}**[,
no longer **protected**]{.mark} by the U.S. nuclear umbrella,
would]{.underline} be tempted to **[[acquire nuc]{.mark}lear
weapon[s]{.mark} of their own]{.underline}**. Unlike the progressives
for retrenchment, [the realists are **comfortable** with
that]{.underline} result, since they see deterrence as a stabilizing
force. **[Most Americans are not]{.underline}** so sanguine, [and
**rightly so**. There are **good reasons to worry** about nuclear
proliferation: **nuclear [materials]{.mark} could [end up in]{.mark} the
hands of [terrorists]{.mark}**, **[states with less
experience]{.mark}**]{.underline} [might be more **[prone to]{.mark}
nuclear [accidents]{.mark}**, and **nuclear powers in [close proximity
have shorter response times]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and thus
**[conflicts]{.mark} among them [have a]{.mark} greater [chance
of]{.mark} spiraling into [escalation]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Third, [**retrenchment** would **[heighten nationalism]{.mark} and
xenophobia**. **[In Europe]{.mark}, a U.S. [withdrawal]{.mark}** [would
**send the message** ]{.mark}**that [every country must fend for
itself]{.mark}**. It would]{.underline} [therefore]{.underline}
[**empower the far-right groups already making this claim**---such as
the Alternative for Germany]{.underline}, the League in Italy, [and the
National Front in France---while **[undermining]{.mark} the centrist
[democratic leaders]{.mark}**]{.underline} [there **who told their
populations that they could rely on the United States and
NATO**]{.underline}. [As a result, **Washington would lose leverage over
the domestic politics of individual allies**, particularly younger and
more fragile democracies such as Poland]{.underline}. [And since these
nationalist [populist groups are]{.mark} almost always
**[protectionist]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [retrenchment would **damage
U.S. economic interests**, as well. **Even more alarming**, many of the
**right-wing nationalists that retrenchment would empower** have
**called for greater accommodation of China and Russia**.]{.underline}

[A fourth problem concerns **regional stability**]{.underline} after
global retrenchment. [The [**most likely end state**]{.mark} is a
**[spheres-of-influence]{.mark} system**]{.underline}, [whereby China
and Russia dominate their neighbors]{.underline}, [but such an order is
**[inherently unstable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The **[lines of
demarcation]{.mark}**]{.underline} [for such spheres [tend to be
**unclear**]{.mark}, and there is no guarantee that]{.underline}
[**[China and Russia]{.mark}** will not seek to **[move them
outward]{.mark} over time**]{.underline}. [Moreover]{.underline},
[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[cannot simply grant]{.underline} other major powers [a sphere of
influence---the countries that would fall into those realms **have
agency**]{.underline}, too. If the United States ceded Taiwan to China,
[for example, the Taiwanese people could **say no**.]{.underline} [The
**[current U.S. policy]{.mark}**]{.underline} toward the country [**[is
working]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}]{.mark} [may be
**[sustainable]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Withdrawing support from Taiwan
against its will would plunge cross-strait relations into chaos. The
entire idea of letting regional powers have their own spheres of
influence has an imperial air that is at odds with modern principles of
sovereignty and international law.

A fifth problem with retrenchment is that it lacks domestic support. The
American people may favor greater burden sharing, but there is no
evidence that they are onboard with a withdrawal from Europe and Asia.
As a survey conducted in 2019 by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs
found, seven out of ten Americans believe that maintaining military
superiority makes the United States safer, and almost three-quarters
think that alliances contribute to U.S. security. A 2019 Eurasia Group
Foundation poll found that over 60 percent of Americans want to maintain
or increase defense spending. As it became apparent that China and
Russia would benefit from this shift toward retrenchment, and as the
United States' democratic allies objected to its withdrawal, the
domestic political backlash would grow. One result could be a prolonged
foreign policy debate that would cause the United States to oscillate
between retrenchment and reengagement, creating uncertainty about its
commitments and thus raising the risk of miscalculation by Washington,
its allies, or its rivals.

Realist and progressive retrenchers like to argue that the architects of
the United States' postwar foreign policy naively sought to remake the
world in its image. But [the real revisionists are those who argue for
retrenchment]{.underline}[, [a **geopolitical experiment** of
**unprecedented scale**]{.underline}]{.mark} **[in modern
history]{.underline}**. [If this camp were to have its way, Europe and
Asia---**[two stable]{.mark}, peaceful, and prosperous
[regions]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that form the]{.underline} [**two main
pillars of the U.S.-led order**---would be **[plunge]{.mark}d [into an
era of uncertainty]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
