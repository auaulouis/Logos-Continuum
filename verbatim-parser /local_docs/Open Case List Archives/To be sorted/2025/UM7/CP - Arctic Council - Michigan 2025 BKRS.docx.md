# Arctic Council CP

## Notes

Thanks to Aarav, Ajay, Arnav, Celeste, Finian, Meilyn, Rona, Sophia,
Varun, William and Yihe for their work on this file. This counterplan
argues that rather than doing the plan unilaterally or bilaterally, the
affirmative plan should instead be submitted to the Arctic Council and
implemented through multilateral cooperation. The net-benefit in the 1NC
is a unilateralism causes Arctic war argument. The Arctic Council DA is
a net-benefit to this counterplan, and there are several pieces of
evidence in the net-benefit section to substantiate that. There are a
variety of other net-benefits (this China argument is particularly
promising) and 'Arctic Council good' impacts in the file.

We did not copy the definitions to this file, but when writing AT: perm
do the CP blocks you should utilize T: its definitions that preclude
cooperation from other files. When writing AT: perm do both blocks you
should utilize the unilateralism bad/Russia backlash cards from the
net-benefit section, in addition to unilat links from other files.

### 1NC

The United States federal government should decrease its unilateral
development and exploration of the Arctic and propose that the Arctic
Council \[insert action of plan\].

#### The counterplan resumes Council cooperation and creates and enforced Arctic agenda that solves the aff.

In general terms, [[**Arctic** **coop**]{.mark}eration is [characterized
by]{.mark} an **intrinsic** **[interaction]{.mark}** [between **hard
law**]{.mark} instruments]{.underline}, relating to the ([in)direct
application of **binding** international treaties in the Arctic space,
[and]{.mark} **[soft law]{.mark}** mechanisms, based on the
**establishment**--- mainly [through the]{.mark} scientific and
[**political** role of]{.mark} the [AC]{.mark}---of **new**
**[procedures]{.mark}** [that apply **specifically** to the
region]{.mark}]{.underline}, but are [not legally
**binding**]{.underline}. The Council has become an [important
institution for [**formulating** the Arctic
**agenda**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [issuing [detailed
**guidelines**]{.underline}]{.mark} [that could be useful for national
and international [legislative **proposals**]{.mark} on the
region]{.underline}. Thus, through its activity, [the Council "[shapes
the rules that]{.mark} will [guide the behaviour]{.mark} of different
actors, [even in the absence of hard power]{.mark} or the threat of
legal repercussions"]{.underline} in case of non-compliance11. In that
vein, we can affirm that the creation and existence of the Council
illustrates the importance of soft power: Although the AC does not have
regulatory powers to compel its members to implement a particular
obligation, cooperation has been increasing under the auspices and
supervision of the circumpolar institution. In this line of thought, a
frequently discussed problem is that the [AC remains a
decision-shaping]{.underline} rather than a decision-making
[institution]{.underline} as it lacks a mandate to formulate, implement,
monitor or enforce any policies or regulations upon its Member States.

It is noteworthy that despite the limitations that the Council may have,
its members have shown little to no intention to dissolve or substitute
it with another mechanism; on the contrary, its regional and
international importance has been gradually increasing. Even so, [many
advocate that the [current **status** of]{.mark} high-level [political
**forums**]{.mark} is [falling **short**]{.mark} and weakens the
AC]{.underline}, which could in the [long [run push the Member
State]{.mark}s and other parties [to seek other ways of
protecting]{.mark} their [interests]{.mark}]{.underline}12. In any case,
the Council has been very active in the processes of regional governance
as evidenced by the signing of relevant agreements under its auspices,
aimed at improving cooperation on broader security aspects: The 2017
Agreement on Enhancing International Arctic Scientific Cooperation
(cultural, human and environmental security), the 2013 Agreement on
Cooperation on Marine Oil Pollution, Preparedness and Response in the
Arctic (environmental security) and the 2011 Agreement on Cooperation on
Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue in the Arctic (human
security).

The above-mentioned [[agreements]{.mark} are [proof]{.mark} that the [AC
is actually using hard law **instruments**]{.mark} to
influence]{.underline} the [conduct]{.underline} of the stakeholders in
the region. Certainly, [they [suppose significant change in]{.mark} the
[**perception** of the Council]{.mark} from having a merely consultative
mandate to being an influential **body** capable of reacting to the most
pressing issues.]{.underline} Following the adoption of the agreements,
some experts13 have introduced the concept of the "Arctic Council
System", which contains two components: The first consists of the
Constitutive Declaration, the Ministerial Declarations, any adopted
normative instruments (guidelines) and the institutional structure of
the Council; while the second comprises tools negotiated under the
auspices of the Council and its institutional components.

It is therefore important to highlight that two new platforms for
regional cooperation have been established through the work of the AC:
The Arctic Economic Council and the Arctic Coast Guard Forum, although
the latter is not formally affiliated with the Council. Moreover, at the
2021 Reykjavik Ministerial Meeting the Council approved its first
strategic plan with detailed goals and actions to be achieved by 2030
with the aim of making the Council more vigorous by increasing its
planning and implementation capacity. Overall, the Arctic Council has
maintained a firm position of being equally committed to sustainable
development, despite an initial prioritization of environmental
protection. In that sense, it focuses on issues related to economic
development, education, health and culture of the residents of the High
North, among others. In time, the Council managed to internationalize
the Arctic problems with the elaboration of high-quality reports and,
especially, after the admission of new Observers. The only major
disadvantage is that even issues related to soft security
(environmental, human, energy security, etc.) are not sufficiently
discussed within the AC. Discussions on military security also remain
excluded. Therefore, it can be concluded that the Council tries to
identify changes in State activities and make them more predictable in
order to soften and clarify positions and to ensure that there is no
misunderstanding between interested parties. The Spill-Over Effect of
the Russian War in Ukraine As already noted, during the Cold War, the
perceptions of security in the Arctic were focused on the balance
between the two superpowers14. Nowadays, this understanding has expanded
to contemporary security aspects that differ according to the object at
risk: Human, cultural, energy, economic and environmental security15. It
can be argued that since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the order in
the High North has been built on three pillars: Favouring the role and
interests of the States; highlighting the Council as the leading forum
for regional cooperation; and limiting the role of NATO16. The Council
indeed emerged as the most prominent actor involved in the governance of
the High North, being the only one that embraces all eight Arctic States
by providing a forum for discussion of common issues and mediation
between them. It can even be argued that using its soft power influence
as an integrative force, the long-term aim of the AC has always been to
establish political thinking based on win-win strategies of mutual
benefit for all, rather than achieving their particular interest17. And
indeed, throughout the existence of the Council, no significant sources
of discord have been recorded18. However, the ongoing Russian aggression
in Ukraine marked the return of geopolitics in the Arctic. This will
undoubtedly have a long-term impact on security and cooperation and will
seriously hamper the dialogue and open relations between the Russian
Federation and its Western partners in the North Polar Region for the
years to come. As a matter of fact, even the 2014 Crimea crisis and the
deteriorated relations between Russia and the West as a result of the
restrictive measures adopted in consequence are an excellent example of
how a non-Arctic event can impact cooperation and security in the North
Polar Region by increasing the mistrust between the Arctic stakeholders.
The 2014 Crimea annexation was followed by political and economic
sanctions that affected the Russian oil industry, as Western
investments, technologies and expertise for oil and gas extraction in
difficult climatic conditions were cancelled. Canada was the first to
introduce sanctions against Russia as a warning that aggressive actions
would not be accepted within the Arctic space. The cautious stance of
the other Arctic States, however, was not able to prevent the freezing
of regional political dialogue at the time: Russia was absent from the
2015 Iqaluit Ministerial Meeting, while several coordinated actions were
suspended (such as the NORTHERN EAGLE naval exercise between Norway,
Russia and the US) and the Arctic Security Forces Roundtable was also
held without Russian participation.

More recently, only a week after the start of the Russian invasion of
[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} in 2022, [[seven]{.mark} of the eight
[members]{.mark} of the **A**rctic **C**ouncil announced they would
[pause]{.mark} temporarily and indefinitely their work]{.underline}
within the organization and its working groups20, suggesting that
[cooperation could continue in a "Nordic Plus" format]{.underline}
limited to seven states. As understandable as such a response might be,
in [pausing the work of the **AC**, the seven Arctic States
**[lost]{.mark}** a valuable line of **[comm]{.mark}**unication [with
Moscow]{.mark}]{.underline}21 [that will [have to be **resumed**]{.mark}
in order [to prevent]{.mark} any risk of [miscom]{.mark}munication and
miscalculation in the North once tensions decrease.]{.underline} The
pause of the working groups (resumed in June 2022 in relation to
projects that do not include Russian participation) is also an
unprecedented act as it breaks with the tradition of keeping the Arctic
out of political conflicts elsewhere and will have a direct effect on
the region's security, governance and climate research. Against this
backdrop, [[Russia]{.mark} remained **isolated**]{.underline} during its
whole tenure as the AC rotating chair from 2021 to 2023, nevertheless
[[insisting on **remaining** open to]{.mark} resuming
[coop]{.mark}eration]{.underline} once the time is right.

To sum up, trust between Russia and the West might never return, but
[**coop**eration in the Arctic [cannot be allowed to
disappear]{.mark}]{.underline}28. Challenging months are awaiting
Norway, which is a leading voice inside NATO for promoting greater
involvement in the Arctic, following the transfer of the AC chairmanship
from Russia in May 2023.

Conclusion Over the last decades, the balance of power from the Cold War
period has been fading, yielding to strategic interdependence in the
High North. The Arctic Council has established itself as the most
outstanding actor for regional governance with unquestionable political
relevance. Therefore, its future remains a central issue in circumpolar
policies as it should become a body that can facilitate policy response
to pressing regional challenges.

In the end, [the story of the Arctic Council serves as a reminder that
States can work together]{.underline} despite disagreements and emerge
with a strong commitment to alliance and collaboration: Under its
[auspices, friends and [**adversaries** could sit down]{.mark} [to talk
and find common ground]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Unilateral Arctic development cause security spiral and nuclear war. Only revitalizing Council legitimacy prevents conflict.

In a regional perspective, we found that [[an **absolute prerequisite**
for a stable]{.mark} and cooperative [future]{.mark} scenario
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} the resumption and [[**maintenance** of the
**A**]{.mark}rctic **[C]{.mark}**ouncil]{.underline} \[interviews 3, 7,
9, 14, 15, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 28\]. Amongst our
interviewees there was a certain longing for the past and we found that
[the times before the Ukrainian Crisis in 2014 is an ideal model for
cooperation between states in the region]{.underline} \[interviews 1,
12, 13, 22\]. However, more importantly for this report, the [resumption
of [dialogue between the **A8**]{.mark}]{.underline} on security [[is a
**necessary prior condition** to avoid **conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark}
or conflict [[below]{.mark} the [threshold of war]{.mark} to emerge in
the region in the future]{.underline} \[interviews 1, 3, 6, 19, 21\].
While a move toward reassurance, such as crisis management and
mitigation, development of risk reduction and confidence building
measures (CBM), and most importantly more open lines of communication
were considered ideal, our interviewees recognised that interim low
level discussions on compartmentalised issues is a sign of success in
the region \[interviews 1, 3, 6, 21, 25, 28\]. For example, tailored
risk reduction measures towards existing commercial spheres, such as
fishing \[interviews 3, 6, 20, 21\], or cooperation on science
\[interviews 3, 6, 7, 18, 28\].

POLICY RECOMMENDATION 3: To ensure future stability in the Arctic, [[the
A]{.mark}rctic [C]{.mark}ouncil [must resume]{.mark} interim [practical
cooperation with **Russia**]{.mark} on compartmentalised issues such as
those prioritised by the Norwegian chair 2023-2025]{.underline}.34 The
current situation in the Arctic demonstrates that if there has ever been
an era of **[[Arctic exceptionalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** it
[[is]{.mark} indeed [over]{.mark}]{.underline}, and when we asked our
interviewees to outline a [negative scenario]{.underline} for the
region, interviewees [identified four main drivers of deteriorating
regional cooperation]{.underline}: [increased **competition** at the
strategic level]{.underline}, **[NATO expansion]{.underline}**,
**[inadvertent escalation]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} [increased
**China-Russia** regional cooperation]{.underline}.

Strategic competition

Our interviewees identified a range of different manifestations of
[[strategic competition]{.underline}]{.mark} which [[could spill
over]{.mark} in the Arctic]{.underline}, including the ongoing [war
against]{.underline} [**[Ukraine and Russian]{.mark}** [**nuclear**
sabre rattling]{.mark}]{.underline} \[interviews 13,14\], the actual use
of nuclear weapons in Ukraine \[interview 13\] and a prolonged
continuation of the war \[interview 1, 4\] which [were all seen as
[escalati]{.mark}ng [**tensions** between the
**A8**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Others mentioned increased competition
between the US and China as spilling over into the Arctic \[interview
21\]. We also found a more general concern around systemic competition
\[interview 23\], such as arms racing \[interview 14\] including in
space \[interview 18\]. The latter being mostly driven by China and
Russia.

NATO expansion

Most worryingly however is the future role of NATO and the possible
effects of [[**NATO's** expansion]{.underline}]{.mark} on the
cooperation in the region. As already mentioned, the expansion - we
found - [[creates **insecurity**]{.mark} in Moscow and distrust towards
the West's intentions]{.underline} \[interviews 1, 3, 28\]. 35 The
[effect of the expansion]{.underline} to include an additional two
Arctic states [[is]{.mark} in general [seen as having]{.mark} the
[potential to **overly militarise** the region]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[interviews 1, 17, 21\] and one scholar highlighted that with Finland's
accession, [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} had [[lost]{.mark} the
[advantages of "**Finlandisation**]{.mark}"]{.underline} in the region
\[interview 3\]. [Militarisation]{.underline} of course
[[increases]{.underline}]{.mark} the risks of
[**[miscalculations]{.mark}** and **misunderstandings**]{.underline}
between states [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} importantly [[may lead to
**arms racing**]{.mark} and increasing postures]{.underline}. As such,
our interviewees pointed to the risk of Russia doing more nuclear
posturing, increasing their capabilities and further modernising their
arsenal in an attempt to intimidate NATO \[interviews 21, 22\]. Others
feared that [[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} - in a worst case scenario -
[[would be]{.mark} more **[escalatory]{.mark}** than
conciliatory]{.underline} \[interviews 6, 21\]
[[increasing]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[risk of]{.mark}
escalation]{.underline}. Some did not rule out that the 'ultimate
result' of more confrontation and more military presence in the region
would be an armed conflict \[interview 21\], and one scholar found that
[should the **[nuclear]{.mark} weapons** states do 'some [**actions**
and **provocations**]{.mark}**'**]{.underline} at the systemic level,
[that will open]{.underline} a [new]{.underline} front of [confrontation
[in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} - a scenario deemed highly unlikelyb
ut yet possible \[interview 7\].

## Solvency \-\-- Top Level

### S \-\-- Enforcement

#### The Arctic Council's soft law approach empirically succeeded -- Norway proves.

**Soltvedt 17 -** Researcher in Polar Law at the Fridtjof Nansen
Institute (Ida Folkestad, 5/1, "Soft Law, Solid Implementation? The
Influence of Precision, Monitoring and Stakeholder Involvement on
Norwegian Implementation of Arctic Council Recommendations"
https://arcticreview.no/index.php/arctic/article/view/639/1865#content/contributor_reference_1)

Starting from the assumptions that international law is not binary, that
soft law is not a uniform phenomenon, and that certain characteristics
of the recommendations---precision, monitoring and stakeholder
involvement---may enhance implementation, what conclusions can be drawn?

[First and foremost, [Norway]{.mark} as a member state of the Arctic
Council [devoted **considerable effort to**]{.mark}
**[implementing]{.mark}** several of [the Council\'s
recommendations]{.mark}]{.underline}. Implementation, however, was
pursued in two very distinct ways. [[The ACIA put adaptation]{.mark} [on
the national agenda]{.mark}, while [the AMSA came into play in a]{.mark}
different [domestic context]{.mark}. Consequently, [the]{.mark} ACIA
[process led to national measures]{.mark} conducted [within]{.mark}
national [borders]{.mark} and [directed at national]{.mark}
[actors.]{.mark}]{.underline} As to the AMSA process, Norway constituted
a maritime power and had already implemented most of the measures
proposed in the AMSA\'s recommendations. [Therefore, [an]{.mark}
important [implementation objective for Norway became]{.mark} the
[promotion of national standards and greater]{.mark} [cooperation within
the Arctic Council.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Of [the]{.mark} six [recommendations]{.mark} examined here, four---two
from ACIA, and two from AMSA---[generated]{.mark} [implementation
measures]{.mark} in Norway.]{.underline} This study indicates that three
specific characteristics of the recommendations, along with the presence
or absence of malignancy, did influence some of the outcomes. Although
the effects of precision proved ambiguous, both monitoring of state
behavior and stakeholder involvement appear to have affected
implementation positively---if the issues were non-malignant. When
malignancy was present, there was no implementation.

[While [these findings]{.mark} are interesting in their own right, they
also [speak to]{.mark} the debate on [the]{.mark} **[effectiveness of
the Arctic Council]{.mark}** and to the scholarly literature on
effectiveness more generally.]{.underline} [[In]{.mark} [contrast to
assumptions]{.mark} that the Arctic Council, as a soft-law body, cannot
be effective, [this study]{.mark} has [shown how recommendations]{.mark}
from two significant reports [were **implemented** in Norway]{.mark}.
Although other aspects are also relevant, [the structural]{.mark} and
organizational [characteristics of the Arctic Council\'s]{.mark}
[recommendations emerge as]{.mark} important [explanatory
factors]{.mark}, as long as the issue is not overly demanding. With
regard to the literature on effectiveness more generally, this study has
shown that [characteristics often associated with hard-law]{.mark}
agreements may be [equally relevant in]{.mark} the application of
[soft-law]{.mark} commitments. Ultimately, then, the differences between
the two may not be as great as often claimed. By extension[, it is not
necessarily so that hard law is more effective]{.mark} for ensuring
implementation [than soft law.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### The Arctic Council empirically fosters cooperation and creates legally binding agreements.

**Łuszczuk 22? --** Professor at the Institute of socio-economic
geography and spatial economy. (Michał, "The what and the how of the
Arctic Council"
https://edu-arctic.pl/en/articles/the-what-and-the-how-of-the-arctic-council)

[[The **Arctic Council**]{.mark} working groups and [task forces are
made up of experts]{.mark}]{.underline} from specialized government
institutions and ministries as well as scientists, all of whom are
appointed by the Council's member states. [Their work is]{.underline},
to a great extent, [[to collect and synthetize]{.mark} scientific
[data]{.mark}]{.underline}, and to produce comprehensive reports which
are then presented to diplomats and politicians from the Arctic states.
These reports provide not only a reliable assessment of the current
state of affairs, but also a range of recommendations, which inform
international and local political decisions. Occasionally, as was the
case with the 2004 report on climate change in the Arctic, these
documents generate increased international interest in the Far North, as
well as complement scientific knowledge with empirical, methodological
and theoretical information. It might therefore be said that scientific
collaboration and science diplomacy are the motors of the Arctic
Council, while effective communication between researchers, experts,
diplomats and politicians, and consequently -- the ability to translate
scientific data into political decisions, form the underlying mechanism
thanks to which the institution has been functioning successfully for
over two decades.

It is worth pointing out that [[the]{.mark} fundamental [principle
behind]{.mark} the **[cooperation]{.mark}** carried out by the Arctic
Council [is that all its]{.mark} [decisions are taken by
**consensus**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This principle applies at all levels
of cooperation and in all types of meetings. Such an approach has an
obvious advantage as all decisions reached by the participants are
unanimously approved and thus eagerly and fully implemented (although it
may also happen that crucial topics are disregarded due to a single
objection).

What is more, [[the Arctic Council is]{.mark} gradually becoming [a
forum for **negotiating**]{.mark} legally-binding [agreements]{.mark}
between its members]{.underline}. Until the year 2022, the Council
helped to formulate: ([1) [Agreement on]{.mark} cooperation on
aeronautical and **[maritime]{.mark}** [search and rescue]{.mark} in the
Arctic, (2) Agreement on cooperation on [marine **oil**
pollution]{.mark} preparedness and response in the Arctic, and (3)
Agreement on enhancing [international Arctic scientific
**cooperation**]{.mark}]{.underline}, all of which were signed during
ministerial meetings.

Joint projects and programmes stimulate and enhance cooperation among
government representatives, scientists, indigenous Arctic peoples and
all interested in the fate of the Arctic. [[They facilitate]{.mark} the
[common]{.mark} [understanding]{.mark} of Arctic issues, [collaborative
learning and]{.mark} the creation of a [shared **Arctic
identity**]{.mark}. Moreover, [being able to assess]{.mark} the
situation [based on]{.mark} collectively acquired, [well-founded
knowledge]{.mark} [plays a significant role in preventing
misunderstandings in political activity]{.mark}]{.underline}. Looking at
the Arctic Council from the perspective of the previous 25 years on its
activity, there is no doubt that the knowledge it generates leads to
essential changes in the Arctic and outside of it, mainly by [[arousing
**global interest** in]{.mark} the topic of climate change in the Far
North and its [far-reaching consequences]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### The Arctic Council is an effective platform in "law-making" and legally binding agreements

"Law-Making"";
https://thenorthernreview.ca/index.php/nr/article/view/861\] GH-CS

The [[negotiations, under the]{.mark} auspices of the [Arctic Council,
of the legally binding agreements point to the AC's ability to respond
to current and emerging challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}. This practice
also shows that all Arctic states are able to consolidate their efforts
on the AC's platform in addressing the most pressing issues. Decisions
of the Arctic Council are subject to consensus of all eight Arctic
states.111 Thus, any of the eight members could block unacceptable
proposals (e.g., the United States blocked the AC's declaration at the
ministerial meeting in Rovaniemi because of the US position on climate
change).112

During negotiations of those documents, all disagreements were clarified
in the course of preparations. At the end, all three agreements were
endorsed by the AC, which by virtue of its task forces performed "a
regulatory task" without being a legislative body or having a mandate to
adopt legally binding instruments. [[Agreements]{.mark} were signed by
the eight Arctic states but they [can rightly be considered as the AC's
product]{.mark}. [Although not being an international organization in
the traditional sense of international law the AC has been involved in
"law-making" activities as if it is such an
organization]{.mark}.]{.underline} Arguably, the practice of these
agreements has changed the nature of the AC and sped up its evolution
towards becoming a fully-fl edged international organization under
international law. The AC has been successful so far in producing
non-legally binding instruments that have direct implications for
development and implementation of "hard law" instruments. [Using the AC
as a platform for negotiations of legally binding instruments is subject
to several pre-conditions. For example, the experience with a possible
legal instrument to deal with prevention of marine oil spills has
revealed not only the complexity of issues at stake but also a question
of capacity within the AC to tackle such matters.]{.underline}
Prevention of contamination at sea and prevention of oil spills are hard
to codify, thus those issues were partially moved to the Polar Code and
the AC's work has shifted towards creation of non-legally binding
guidelines. It is no accident, for example, that the AC chose not to
become a platform in dealing with negotiations on unregulated commercial
fisheries in the Central Arctic Ocean but is interested in further
cooperation with relevant regional organizations. To sum up, the Arctic
Council is not a law-making body, but it has already contributed to the
development of international law as it applies to the Arctic. [[Any
further law-making activities of the AC, such as the negotiation of new
legally binding instruments under its auspices, are quite
possible]{.mark} but will depend on the will of member states to
compromise their national interests]{.underline}. It remains to be seen
whether Arctic governance will be strengthened if AC formally opens its
"law-making" process to relevant non-Arctic actors.113 A lot will depend
on the particular subject matter of any further agreements. Finally,
[[the Arctic Council may continue its contribution to law-making by
serving as a platform and initiator for negotiations; infl uencing
global and regional legal instruments]{.mark} by means of involvement in
their negotiation and implementation;]{.underline} and by bringing the
Arctic voice to those endeavours through scientifi c assessments and
reports. Also, the AC's practice of producing "soft-law" documents will
continue to infl uence the development of regulatory frameworks.

#### The Council produces [soft law]{.underline} which is better for [enforcement]{.underline} in the Arctic specifically.

The [A]{.underline}rctic [C]{.underline}ouncil is often [viewed as
politically ineffective]{.underline} because of its lack of legal
authority. But [despite]{.underline} its many limitations it has [proven
otherwise]{.underline} since its establishment 20 years ago, playing a
central role in Arctic [norm-setting since]{.underline} the thaw of
East-West relations in the [1990]{.underline}s, which has led to deeper
cooperation and uninterrupted stability in the Arctic. A patchwork of
intersec[ting soft law standards]{.underline} produced by the Council
has [helpe]{.underline}d circumpolar [states]{.underline} and other key
actors to overcome past [tensions and]{.underline} sit around the same
table to [address]{.underline} common and pressing regional
[issues.]{.underline}

JOËL PLOUFFE: Your article looks at how the Arctic Council as a body
produces norms that shape international affairs in the region.
Specifically, how have these norms been articulated over the last two
decades since the establishment of the Council in the mid-1990s?

CAMILLE ESCUDÉ: The [[A]{.mark}rctic [C]{.mark}ouncil [is the most
prominent]{.mark}]{.underline} intergovernmental organization in the
region and has been the principal [[producer of
norms]{.underline}]{.mark} since its establishment in 1996 as a
high-level forum. It's important to mention that the Council's role as
norm-creator is mostly limited to environmental protection and
sustainable development issues---the two pillars of the Council's
mandate---and of course excludes questions relating to hard power
security that were also exempt from the Ottawa Declaration that founded
the Council. The type of cooperation that emerged in the early post-Cold
War years was aimed at strengthening multilateral relations between
Arctic states and indigenous organizations at the civil level, not on
the level of the military.

Ever since the 1990s, [the Council has [developed]{.mark}]{.underline} a
certain number of [**[treaties and]{.mark} multiple [legal
norms]{.mark}** that]{.underline} seek to structure or
[[organize]{.mark} Arctic [governance and cooperation]{.mark} between
state and non-state actors]{.underline}, ultimately seeking [to
promote]{.underline} the best practices based on [the Council's
mandate]{.underline}. But we must reiterate that the Council in its
current form does not have a legal personality and does not have the
power to constrain behavior in the region. It is up to the states to
enact these norms through their own national legislations and processes,
with all the complexities that could entail.

[The Council has]{.underline}, however, [seen its prerogatives
strengthened since]{.underline} its inception in [the
1990s]{.underline}, and most recently, I think, has truly begun a new
phase of norm-setting with the 2011 Nuuk Declaration. The "[[Framework
for Strengthening the Arctic Council]{.underline}" [was
signed]{.underline}]{.mark} at the 2011 Arctic Council ministerial
meeting in Greenland [[with]{.mark} the [intention]{.mark} [of
creating]{.mark} the first [legally binding instruments to structure
Arctic governance]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Nuuk meeting also marked the
creation of a "Task Force for Institutional Issues" (TIFF) that seeks to
strengthen the institutional capacity of the Council.

The Nuuk ministerial and the 2013 Kiruna ministerial in Sweden marked a
break in the process of creating standards. The first agreement dealt
with search and rescue in marine and air spaces, and the second was
established to tackle the fight against pollution produced by
hydrocarbons in the Arctic. More generally speaking, the signing of
these two agreements illustrates an important step in the production of
standards over the past two decades within the Council, which in my
view, seems to be moving toward a more robust system that produces and
enforces standards, but still remains within a soft law framework. JP:
The Arctic Council is a complex system of interactions between state
officials, permanent participants, NGOs, and non-Arctic state observers.
Who leads the norm-making process in this type of setting? CE: If the
Council is in theory an inclusive organization, then a hierarchy between
all of these actors is the modus operandi of the standard-setting
process. For example, non-Arctic states do not have the right to speak
or make political declarations in the formal talks at Council meetings.
The status of the Permanent Participants (PPs)---indigenous peoples'
organizations---is another separate category of members who are included
in the decision-making process, even if they don't actually have the
right to vote on the same basis as the states. For example, in 2011 and
2013, only state representatives signed the two agreements introducing
truly binding standards for Council members, without the PPs' signature.
This shows that the role of non-state actors and, in particular, that of
PPs, is secondary when it comes to norm making. At the highest level, it
is the states that organize the norm-making process, represented by
their foreign affairs ministers, Nordic affairs ministers, or ministers
of the environment. This illustrates the eminently political aspect of a
forum that on paper does not deal with political matters, which are
nevertheless expressed through the Council's complex processes and
interactions. Only two legally binding agreements have been produced at
the end of ministerial meetings---these are the biennial meetings that
take place in the Arctic Council chairmanship host country like the
upcoming one in Fairbanks, Alaska, which will mark the end of the
American chairmanship and its transition to Finland for the next two
years. At the end of each ministerial meeting, a declaration is adopted
that summarizes the objectives reached during the past chairmanship as
well as those for the years ahead.

JP: As the title of your paper indicates, [the Arctic Council's
"flexibility"]{.underline} facilitates the norm-making process in the
region and has been at the core of the Council's successes over the
years. But others have also argued that the Council's lack of legal
authority weakens its role as an institution, since it lacks the power
to implement the agreements it produces. In your view, how do we
overcome this dichotomy between hard and [[soft
law]{.underline}]{.mark}?

CE: You are right to point out that the lack of legal authority could
weaken in some way the role of the Arctic Council, and we often see that
soft law has its set of limitations when the Council fails to implement
the standards it spends years to achieve. In my view, the Council's
[flexibility]{.underline} goes beyond this dichotomy by showing that
this system [[allows for the establishment of standards that could not
be implemented otherwise.]{.underline}]{.mark} What I've noticed in my
research is that [[in]{.mark} the]{.underline} present
[[situation]{.underline}]{.mark}, in [[which states do not wish to
subordinate]{.mark} their [sovereignty]{.mark} to an organization that
legally obliges them to do so, [soft law]{.mark} then [becomes]{.mark}
an interesting solution or a [preferred option to achieve
progress]{.mark}]{.underline}---or maybe the only one! For me, the
Council in its current flexible form, even if limited or imperfect, is
better than having nothing at all.

I would also add that through its flexible structure, the Council
facilitates cooperation and produces standards that may be appear weak
at first, but have the potential to become stronger, as we've seen
throughout the 2000s. [The **[objectives of soft law]{.mark} are often
[more]{.mark} easily [attainable]{.mark}** [than]{.mark} those of [hard
law]{.mark}, especially when they defy state sovereignty.]{.underline}

But for me, the most important advantage of the Arctic Council's
flexible structure is that it allows non-state actors to express
themselves by recognizing their place in new cross-border challenges
such as those related to the environment and climate change. These
non-state actors, especially indigenous peoples, are the first to be
affected by Arctic change[. A hard law structure would certainly be
narrow and rigid, to the detriment of the Council's PPs.]{.underline}.

#### Support for the Arctic Council is key---it's an [organization]{.underline} that punches above their weight.

The Glass Half Full?

Dr Douglas Nord, one of the leading academics on Arctic governance and
professor of from Umea University also prefer to see the glass half-full
when it comes to the Arctic Council's achievements. "There is always
additional important work that it could be undertaking," he says, "but
if you look at what it has accomplished, especially over the last
decade, its efforts are quite significant."

[The Arctic [Council has indeed managed to **foster**
**collaboration**]{.mark} across the North at a time were few thought it
was even possible to create such dialogue]{.underline} as the region was
seeing a rise of physical, economic and political changes. Nord further
explains that by focusing on specific problems and issues of salience to
the North the Arctic Council has encouraged the process of addressing
important concerns of the region. He adds that "a major accomplishment
of the Arctic Council has been to keep such disparate parties working
with each other in research and policy development and making headway on
real issues that affect the circumpolar community."

Of course, this does not mean there is no room for a healthy dose of
criticism or improvement. There is still much more that could be done to
broaden the work of the Arctic Council. Nord suggests there are
important initiatives that should be prioritized such as developing new
employment and education opportunities for the people living in the
North or broadening the input of Permanent Participants.

But Nord also tries to keep things in perspective. "For an institution
that is only about two decades-and-a-half old, [[what has been
accomplished thus far is **significant**]{.mark} and [compares
favourably with \[what\] other international **institutions** have
**accomplished**]{.mark}]{.underline} over similar periods of time," he
said. In terms of concrete outcomes, both Exner-Pirot and Nord agree
however that [the work, which is currently being done by the Council, on
**marine** **litter** and plastics is quite impressive]{.underline}. The
SAO meeting in Hveragerði served as a backdrop to discuss the next steps
in the process of combating marine plastic pollution in the Arctic.

The Web of Arctic Governance

The traditional understanding of Arctic politics places the Arctic
Council atop of regional governance, but as Exner-Pirot points out,
[[Arctic governance]{.underline}]{.mark} should not be viewed as a
pyramid, with the Arctic Council on top but [[rather as a **web**, with
the **Council** placed in the **middle**]{.underline}]{.mark}. There are
other important fora relevant to the governance of the region. "Think of
\[International Maritime Organization (IMO), the UN Commission on the
Limits of the Continental Shelf, the Arctic Coast Guard Forum, the
University of the Arctic, the International Arctic Science Committee,
the Five Plus Five Fishing Agreement, and many international environment
treaties," Exner-Pirot points out.

Navigating in this web of Arctic governance might prove difficult and it
is easy to give too much credit to the high-level political forum with
lack of law-making power that is the Arctic Council. Asked if too much
deference has been accorded to the Arctic Council, Nord suggests that
perhaps the opposite is true. "If [[anything, **insufficient**
**awareness** and support for its efforts]{.mark} have tended to me
[more of the case]{.mark}]{.underline}." Nord agrees with Exner-Pirot
that other fora such as the forthcoming COP 25 Conference, the IMO and
the Arctic Circle Assembly can and do serve as appropriate venues for
discussion of some Arctic issues and concerns. However, he adds that
"[the way in which the **[Arctic Council]{.mark}** provides an ongoing
and [integrative focus to these matters is **unmatched** by any other
body]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus, [it [should remain at the **centre** of
Arctic governance **efforts**."]{.mark}]{.underline}

### S \-\-- Enforcement \-\-- AT Not legally binding

#### Arctic Council is a forum for legal binding agreements

**Hossain \'24** (Kamrul -- Research Professor & Director of
Environmental and Minority Law @ University of Lapland, \"The Future of
Science Diplomacy in Arctic Law\", xx-xx-2024, Current Developments in
Arctic Law, Vol. 12, pp. 14-19,
https://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi-fe2024112596400//phs-maubu)

Today, the Arctic Council is the central forum through which the eight
Arctic states promote inter-state cooperation for environmental
protection and sustainable development. Environmental protection and
sustainable development in the Arctic call for a governance framework in
which scientific findings translate into legal norms. The Arctic Climate
Impact Assessment (ACIA), an Arctic Council initiative carried out in
2004/5 and one of the first studies of its kind, represents a
ground-breaking work.5 It has provided evidence-based information on
changes in the Arctic, including the impacts of climate change, and has
implications for societies, both within and beyond the region. [[The
Arctic Council]{.underline}]{.mark}, through its six Working Groups,
produces science-based knowledge and assessment reports that shape
policies for Arctic states and other stakeholders and serve to enhance
systematic collaboration. Importantly, the Council's endorsement of the
reports, findings, and subsequent policy recommendations produced
through the political decision-making process takes on the status of
"soft law."6 [[Although not strictly legally binding]{.mark}, soft law
[is crucial in seting standards and shaping]{.mark} the [behavior
of]{.mark} state and non-state [actors]{.mark}]{.underline}. [While the
Arctic model for cooperation reflects the search for practicable
solutions to Arctic problems, today [many non-Arctic countries]{.mark}
worldwide have [embraced values that the Arctic Council
promotes]{.mark}, and participate as observers in the Council-led
governance framework. Over the years, [the Council's efforts have
been]{.mark} widely recognized as [a successful model for]{.mark}
inter-governmental [cooperation]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Significantly, [[this]{.mark} science-based approach to **[cooperation
has]{.mark} also [led to the establishment of formal legal
mechanisms]{.mark}.**]{.underline} For example, [the [Arctic
states]{.mark} [adopted]{.mark} a set of [legally binding instruments
under the auspices of the Arctic Council]{.mark}]{.underline}, with
these primarily based in assessment reports and findings produced by the
Council in response to the most urgent Arctic problems. The Arctic
[[Search and Rescue]{.mark} Agreement of 2011]{.underline},7 [the
[Arctic Oil Spill]{.mark} [Agreement]{.mark}]{.underline} of 2013,8 and
the [Agreement on Enhancing International Arctic Scientific Cooperation
of 2017]{.underline}9 are successful examples. They have served to shape
an even stronger cooperation model among the Arctic nations, one relying
on and promoting a coordinated approach and legal commitment.
Additionally, the Arctic coastal states, along with some of the
Council's non-Arctic observer states and the European Union (also an
observer), adopted the Central Arctic Ocean Fisheries Agreement in 2018
(entered into force in 2020),10 which prohibits unregulated fishing as
long as there is no scientific data available that would ensure the
feasibility of sustainable fishing in an area. The Agreement is driven
by the precautionary principle; that is, it avoids potential harm to the
Arctic ecosystem given that comprehensive knowledge is lacking on
whether or not sustainable fisheries notable is that the Agreement
recognizes the value of Indigenous knowledge and of incorporating this
into understanding ecosystem behavior. Moreover, by including Indigenous
peoples in the negotiation process and incorporating their voices in the
law-making process, the Council has further acknowledged Indigenous
peoples as legitimate actors in the Arctic governance framework. [These
[examples indicate]{.mark} how [a]{.mark} science-based [framework
supplemented by]{.mark} evidence based [Indigenous knowledge]{.mark}
systems has greatly enhanced -- and will continue to [enhance]{.mark} --
[regulatory norms for a]{.mark} transnational [governance framework
applicable to the Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Structure of the AC key to legalization of Arctic governance regardless of politics

**Kirchner & Koivurova \'22** (Stefan -- Research Professor of Arctic
Law @ University of Lapland, & Timo -- Research Professor of Arctic Law

Sustainable Development in the Arctic -- The Arctic Council as a

Arctic pp. 33-46, DOI:10.4324/9781003246015-3//phs-maubu)

This holistic way of addressing sustainability issues is also promising
when it comes to potential future developments. By providing space for
different aspects, topics, and perspectives, the AC maintains the
inclusiveness it already has in terms of its organization, for example,
by including indigenous representative organizations. By opening the
door to non-Arctic observer states, the AC recognizes the
interconnectedness of the Arctic and the interests of non-Arctic states
without relinquishing control over its internal working processes.

In recent years, [**[there has been]{.mark} a trend toward a
"[legalization]{.mark}" [of Arctic governance and soft law]{.mark}**
guidelines have been [turned into legally binding hard law]{.mark}
norms.]{.underline} This can be seen not only in the context of the
Polar Code or the CAOFA, both of which had nonbinding soft law
predecessor texts. [Binding norms were created outside the "Arctic
Council system",]{.underline} a term coined by Molenaar (2012), [both of
which had nonbinding, soft law, predecessor documents, but also within
the work of the AC.]{.underline} The [[three treaties]{.mark} associated
with the AC [have been created]{.mark}]{.underline} on the scientific
basis within the aforementioned system provided by the AC. These norms
were not created by the AC but were negotiated by the member states
under the umbrella of the AC, benefiting from the input by permanent
participants and observers. This strategy is not new but has been built
over the course of several chairmanships of the AC in the first two
decades of the 21st century. [The international treaties created by the
state [based on the work]{.mark} undertaken [within the AC]{.mark}
system]{.underline} have not been made by the AC but by the member
states. [This step-by-step approach, [building consensus to
create]{.mark} legal [norms]{.mark} on the fundament [provided
by]{.mark} [scientific research]{.mark}, which [includes]{.mark} not
only states but also [permanent]{.mark} participants [and]{.mark} allows
for input from observer organizations and [observer states]{.mark},
[appears to be sustainable]{.mark} insofar as it is [independent
of]{.mark} day-to-day [politics]{.mark}]{.underline} and, in fact, also
largely independent of the organizational structure of the AC.

### S \-\-- Norms

#### Council working [groups]{.underline} are key [towards]{.underline} the [negotiation]{.underline} of binding Arctic [norms]{.underline}.

[The **[AC]{.mark}**'s [working **groups**]{.mark} not only provide
technical information or raw data but reports which]{.underline},
according to Durfee and Johnstone, ["are highly [regarded as
**authoritative** and impartial]{.mark} **assessments** of the state of
the Arctic"]{.underline} (Durfee and Johnstone, 2019, p.75) [and support
the Senior **Arctic** **Officials** who meet in the AC with
**recommendations** for **policies**]{.underline} (ibid., p.74).

[The AC is not an intergovernmental organization]{.underline} (ibid.,
p.78), nor does it have international legal subjectivity (ibid., p.78),
but it [has great [practical **relevance** for the
**governance**]{.mark} of the region]{.underline} (ibid.). Within the
limitations of its mandate, in particular concerning the sharing of
knowledge, the [AC can make [contributions to the **sustainable**
**dev**]{.mark}elopment efforts by different Arctic actors]{.underline}.
The emphasis on knowledge is also important for building a basis
fundament for future generations in the Arctic by facilitating
high-level education and access to information. While the creation and
operation of educational institutions are seen as a national and local
task, educational institutions in the Arctic already have a tradition of
cooperation, for example, through the University of the Arctic.
Digitalization and cooperation across borders can contribute to closing
the gap which still persists in the non-urban parts of the Arctic.
Education, one of the SDGs (SDG 4), is essential for ensuring the
sustainability of development across different fields. Today, utilizing
educational opportunities usually requires physical relocation to
cities. Digitalization makes education accessible of location, thereby
reducing the risk of outward migration away from rural and remote areas
(which, in turn, impacts sustainability efforts). Through its efforts in
the field of digitalization, the AC therefore also has a positive
influence on access to education. Also, in addition to the explicitly
sustainability-related work of the SDWG, the work accomplished in other
working groups, for example, concerning the protection of the natural
environment, is closely connected to sustainable development.
Sustainability requires a view of the big picture and a capacity to pay
attention to detail when and wherever needed. Not all activities of the
AC related to sustainable development are labeled as such.

Potential future roles for the Arctic Council

This holistic way of addressing sustainability issues is also promising
when it comes to potential future developments. By providing space for
different aspects, topics, and perspectives, [the AC [**maintains** the
**inclusiveness** it already]{.mark} has in terms of its organization,
for example, by including **i[ndigenous]{.mark}**
[representative]{.mark} organizations.]{.underline} By opening the door
to non-Arctic observer states, the AC recognizes the interconnectedness
of the Arctic and the interests of non-Arctic states without
relinquishing control over its internal working processes.

century. [The international [treaties created]{.mark} [by]{.mark} the
[state based on the work **undertaken**]{.mark} within the AC system
have not been made by the AC but by the member **states**]{.underline}.
This step-by-step approach, building consensus to create legal norms on
the fundament provided by scientific research, which includes not only
states but also permanent participants and allows for input from
observer organizations and observer states, appears to be sustainable
insofar as it is independent of day-to-day politics and, in fact, also
largely independent of the organizational structure of the AC.

### S \-\-- Russia Say Yes \-\-- AC

#### Russia says yes, but the Council is key.

Ildar **Gibadiukov**, Iglobenews, 9-12-20**24**, \""No Arctic Without
Russia": Flashpoint or Cooperation with the West?\", iGlobenews,
https://www.iglobenews.org/no-arctic-without-russia/

Russia's Arctic region is a vast territory of about 5 million square
kilometers, which is home to more than 2.5 million people or about 40%
of the population of the entire Arctic. That is why the safe and
efficient development of the Arctic is one of Russia's key national
priorities.

[[**Russia** attaches]{.mark} great **[importance]{.mark}**
**[to]{.mark}** the development of its **[Arctic]{.mark}
territories**]{.underline}. Suffice it to say that in the current
concept of Russia's foreign policy, the Arctic ranks second among the
priority regional areas after the "Near Abroad" (friendly countries of
the former Soviet Union).

[[Moscow]{.mark}]{.underline} has [[called upon]{.mark} all other Arctic
[states]{.mark}]{.underline} -- Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland,
Norway, Sweden and the United States -- [[to cooperate]{.mark} for the
joint peaceful use of this harsh land, which has perhaps the world's
largest reserves of oil, gas, minerals and other natural
resources.]{.underline}

[[The Arctic Council promotes cooperation]{.mark} on environmental
protection and sustainable development [in]{.mark} the
circum[polar]{.mark} [regions]{.mark}]{.underline}, but its work in
recent years has been in fact frozen. The US and other [[Western
countries claim]{.mark} that [Russia's actions in Ukraine are hindering
coordination]{.mark} and cooperation among Council members.]{.underline}

In fact, [[this is not the case]{.mark}: during Russia's recent
chairmanship of the Arctic Council (from May 2021 to May 2023), it was
the US and the UK, joined by other countries unfriendly to Russia, that
paralyzed the Council's activities. All [projects]{.mark} and
initiatives [proposed by]{.mark} the [Russian chairmanship were
blocked]{.mark}. And this, as with the [imposition of anti-Russian
sanctions]{.mark}, [was done illegally]{.mark}.]{.underline}

At the same time, these countries are silent about the fact that they
have long claimed the Arctic coast, building infrastructure there
suitable for living in difficult natural conditions. This would appear
to be in preparation for their long-term involvement in this key region.

When the chairmanship of the Arctic Council passed to Norway in 2023
(until 2025), Russia's activities were formally unblocked, but little
has changed. [Now the efforts of the Council's member states hostile to
Moscow focus on achieving maximum restrictions of Russian military
activities in the Arctic.]{.underline}

However, it is important that Russia has a military presence in its
Arctic region to protect the strategically important Northern Sea Route
from terrorist attacks such as the blowing up of the Nord Stream gas
pipeline. The Northern Sea Route lies in Arctic waters, within Russia's
exclusive economic zone (EEZ).

[[**Western countries** consider]{.underline}]{.mark} not only
[[**Russia** as their **competitor**]{.mark} **in this
region**]{.underline}, but also China, which has declared its interest
in the Arctic. Beijing is interested to pursue cooperation and
development activities in the Arctic, while Russia is already actively
using its opportunities in the region. This fact does not sit well with
the rest of the Arctic countries, who are questioning Russia's sovereign
rights to its part of the Arctic.

[Russian experts]{.underline} and others [note that [the]{.mark}
**ideology of [West]{.mark}ern confrontation**]{.underline} with Moscow
[[does not allow]{.underline}]{.mark} even pragmatically-minded Western
leaders to take **[[concrete measures]{.underline}]{.mark}**, or at
least to create a basis, for dialogue [[on]{.mark} the
[Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Instead, it is suggested that Russia should show "good will" and limit
its Arctic development activities, until the Arctic countries are ready
to start their own development activities. This denies Russia's
sovereignty in its part of the Arctic and indicates that these states
are ready to oppose Russia's resource extraction in its Arctic territory
and its development of the Northern Sea Route near its border.

According to another strategic document, the Decree of the President of
Russia "On the Foundations of the Russian Federation State Policy in the
Arctic for the Period up to 2035", [[**Russia's** **goals**]{.mark} in
the Arctic **[include]{.mark}**]{.underline}: improving the quality of
life of the population of the Arctic zone (including almost 40
indigenous peoples of the North); environmental protection in the
Arctic; mutually beneficial cooperation; and peaceful
**[resolution]{.underline}** of all disputes [in the [Arctic]{.mark} on
the **basis of [international law]{.mark}**]{.underline}

#### Artic Council key\-\-- cooperation with Russia [fails]{.underline} absent [Norwegian involvement]{.underline}.

Gwladys **Fouche**, 5-14-20**24**, \"West, Russia manage limited
cooperation in Arctic despite chill in ties\", Reuters,
https://www.reuters.com/world/west-russia-manage-limited-cooperation-arctic-despite-chill-ties-2024-05-14/OSLO,
May 14 (Reuters) - When Arctic nations simulated a large oil spill for a
virtual training exercise in March off northern Norway, Russia also took
part - a rare sign of cooperation between Moscow and the West that
highlighted the special status of the polar region.

[[Relations]{.mark} between **Russia** and **Western** nations [have
been]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the [**deep freeze** since]{.mark}
**[Moscow\'s]{.mark}** full-scale [invasion of **Ukraine**]{.mark} in
**February 2022**, [but **Norway**]{.mark} has been [keen to
keep]{.mark} some limited **[cooperation alive through]{.mark}** the
**[Arctic Council]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

\"[[We had **good communication**]{.mark} (during the **oil spill
exercise**) **[with all states]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[including
**Russia**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and Russia also offered assistance and
we accepted that,\" said Ole Kristian Bjerkemo, chair of the Arctic
Council\'s Emergency Prevention, Preparedness and Response working
group, which led the drill.

[**Russia simulated sending two vessels** to the exercise]{.underline},
he said.

The Council comprises all eight Arctic nations - the United States,
Canada, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland and Russia - and
handles issues ranging from pollution and economic development to
search-and-rescue missions.

The seven [[**Western** nations]{.underline}]{.mark} - all now members
of the NATO military alliance - [[**paused cooperation** with **Moscow**
after]{.mark} its invasion of [Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}, putting a
third of the Council\'s 130 projects on hold because of direct Russian
involvement, and fuelling concerns that the forum might completely
collapse.

The loss of its work would jeopardise Arctic security and undermine
efforts to tackle climate change across a region that is warming four
times faster than the rest of the world, diplomats said.

[[Norway]{.underline}]{.mark}, which assumed the Council\'s rotating
two-year chairship last May, said it [[wanted to **avoid such an
outcome**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

\"The main objective for the [Norwegian chairship]{.underline}
[has]{.underline} been to [make sure that the structure
survives]{.underline}, because we cannot afford to lose it,\" Norway\'s
deputy foreign minister Maria Varteressian told Reuters.

ARCTIC \'EXCEPTIONALISM\'

The Council, founded in 1996, has long been seen as a key arena for
collaboration between the West and Russia, producing binding agreements
on environmental protection and preservation.

Russia makes up roughly a third of the entire Arctic region and is
behind nearly 70% of economic activity in high latitudes.

\"We knew this chairship would be an extremely challenging and difficult
one,\" said Norway\'s Morten Hoeglund, Chair of the Senior Arctic
Officials who is now tasked with balancing relations between the
Council\'s Western members and Russia.

Russia\'s Arctic Council ambassador did not respond to a request for
comment for this article.

At the onset of the Ukraine war, many polar pundits heralded the end of
Arctic \"exceptionalism\" - a post-Cold War concept that characterises
the Arctic as such a unique place due to its geography and history that
it is immune to some geopolitical tensions and is therefore an arena for
peaceful cooperation.

Some recent developments have reinforced the pundits\' pessimism.

Last September, Russia withdrew from the Barents Euro-Arctic Council,
another Arctic regional forum. And in February, Russia suspended its
annual voluntary payments to the Arctic Council, citing the needs for
\"real work\" to resume, involving the participation of all member
countries.

However, [the **[Arctic Council]{.mark}\'s secretariat**]{.underline}
said in February it [[would **resume**]{.mark} **working
[group]{.mark}** [meetings]{.mark} on **environmental and safety
issues** in a virtual format]{.underline}, [[with
**Russia**]{.underline}]{.mark} at the table, and some analysts saw
grounds for hope.

\"What we\'re seeing during Norway\'s chairship shows that
[[cooperation]{.mark} is [still **possible**]{.mark}]{.underline},\"
said Pavel Devyatkin, a Moscow-based researcher with the U.S. think tank
the Arctic Institute.

[The Council working group dedicated to monitoring the region\'s climate
and environment]{.underline} will soon [publish three
reports]{.underline} --- on changes to the Arctic climate, microplastic
pollution and radioactivity --- that had been delayed by the Ukraine
war.

The [radioactivity report required significant input from
Moscow]{.underline} as it has a Russian co-lead author and includes
extensive Russian data, said Rolf Roedven, executive secretary of the

MOSCOW (AP) --- Russia's President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that
President Donald Trump's push for control over Greenland wasn't
surprising given longtime U.S. interest in the mineral-rich territory.

Speaking at a policy forum in the Artic port of Murmansk, Putin noted
that the United States first considered plans to win control over
Greenland in the 19th century, and then offered to buy it from Denmark
after World War II.

"It can look surprising only at first glance and it would be wrong to
believe that this is some sort of extravagant talk by the current U.S.
administration," Putin said. "It's obvious that the United States will
continue to systematically advance its geostrategic, military-political
and economic interests in the Arctic."

Trump irked much of Europe by suggesting that the United States should
in some form control the self-governing, mineral-rich territory of
Denmark, a U.S. ally and NATO member. As the nautical gateway to the
Arctic and North Atlantic approaches to North America, Greenland has
broader strategic value as both China and Russia seek access to its
waterways and natural resources.

U.S. Vice President JD Vance and his wife are due to visit an American
military base in Greenland on Friday on a trip that was scaled back
after an uproar by Greenlanders and Danes.

Speaking on Thursday, Putin noted that [Russia is **worried** about
NATO's activities in the Arctic and will respond by strengthening its
military capability in the polar region]{.underline}.

"We are certainly concerned about NATO members describing the Far North
as the region of possible conflicts," he said, noting that Russia's
neighbors Finland and Sweden have joined the alliance.
"[Russia]{.underline} has never threatened anyone in the Arctic, but we
[will closely follow the developments and mount an **appropriate
response** by increasing our military capability and modernizing
military infrastructure]{.underline}."

[Russia has sought to assert its influence over wide areas of the Arctic
**in competition**]{.underline} with the United States, Canada, Denmark
and Norway as shrinking polar ice from the warming planet offers new
opportunities for resources and shipping routes. [China also has shown
an increasing interest in the region]{.underline}, believed to hold up
to one-fourth of the Earth's undiscovered oil and gas.

["We won't allow any infringement on our country's sovereignty, reliably
safeguard our national interests while supporting peace and stability in
the polar region," Putin said.]{.underline}

While pledging to strengthen Russia's military foothold in the Arctic,
[Putin said that Moscow was **holding the door open to broader
international cooperation** in the region]{.underline}.

"[The stronger our positions will be, the more significant the results
will be and the broader opportunities we will have to launch
international projects in the Arctic involving the countries that are
friendly to us, and, possibly, Western countries]{.underline} if they
show interest in joint work. I'm sure the time will come to launch such
projects."

Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund and Putin's
envoy for international investment who took part in talks with U.S.
officials, told reporters last month that Russia and the U.S. should
develop joint energy ventures.

"We need joint projects, including in the Arctic and other regions," he
said.

[Although [Russia]{.mark} disdains some multilateral fora]{.underline}
(recently bristling at UNESCO's focus on an imperiled Russian World
Heritage Site as having a "political orientation" imposed by Western
nations25 and withdrawing from the Barents-Euro Arctic Council in
September 2023),26 [the Putin administration appears to remain
[**committed** to the Arctic Council]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, just
before the hand-oﬀ of its duties as chair of the Arctic Council to
Norway,27 [**[Russia amended its national Arctic Strategy]{.mark}** and
continued [to]{.mark} **[aﬃrm the Arctic Council]{.mark}**'s leading
role in [overseeing]{.mark} international activities in [the
region]{.mark}]{.underline}.28

[Under Norway's]{.underline} leadership, [a new approach is now cracking
[open]{.mark} a [door for]{.mark} dialogue on Arctic Council [projects
that include Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline}29 [All Arctic states, in
consultation with the permanent participants, have agreed by consensus
on [new guidelines for decision-making]{.mark} via written
procedure,]{.underline} an approach that is permissible under the Arctic
Council's existing operating guidelines.30 Such a process is likely to
be more time-consuming and cumbersome than face-to-face communication.
However, [it]{.underline} at least [establishes [a means for]{.mark} all
[Arctic countries to communicate]{.mark} with each other [and]{.mark}
has [allowed for]{.mark} the [resumption of]{.mark} Arctic
[Council]{.mark} [activities]{.mark}]{.underline}.

In a media interview, the Norwegian Chair of the Senior Arctic Oﬃcials,
Morten Høglund, acknowledged [Russia's apparent interest in remaining
part of the organization]{.underline}, noting that "[when
needed]{.underline}, we have contact and [[meetings with]{.mark} the
[Russia]{.mark}n side]{.underline} and the conversation [is
[constructive]{.mark}]{.underline}... and the other countries are
interested in resuming the Council's work."

As reported by HNN, [[Russia\'s Arctic Ambassador]{.mark}, Nikolay

Affairs\']{.underline} views on the council at the press conference
after the meeting:

\"The future of the council is obviously a concern. But Norway is in a

He also expresses that [[Russia is **willing to cooperate** and]{.mark}
emphasizes that [it will be impossible to maintain the council]{.mark}
going forward [without interaction between]{.mark} the Arctic
[countries]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Furthermore, [[Kurchonov rejects]{.mark} that Russia has [intentions to

[\"[We had good **communication**]{.mark} (during the oil spill
exercise) [with **all states, including Russia**, and Russia]{.mark}
also [offered assistance]{.mark} and we accepted that]{.underline},\"
said Ole Kristian Bjerkemo, chair of the Arctic Council\'s Emergency
Prevention, Preparedness and Response working group, which led the
drill. [[Russia simulated sending **two** vessels]{.mark} to the
exercise, he said.]{.underline} The Council comprises all eight Arctic
nations - the United States, Canada, Norway, Finland, Sweden, Denmark,
Iceland and Russia - and handles issues ranging from pollution and
economic development to search-and-rescue missions. The seven Western
nations - all now members of the NATO military alliance - paused
cooperation with Moscow after its invasion of Ukraine, putting a third
of the Council\'s 130 projects on hold because of direct Russian
involvement, and fuelling concerns that the forum might completely
collapse. The loss of its work would jeopardise Arctic security and
undermine efforts to tackle climate change across a region that is
warming four times faster than the rest of the world, diplomats said.
Norway, which assumed the Council\'s rotating two-year chairship last
May, said it wanted to avoid such an outcome. \"The main objective for
the Norwegian chairship has been to make sure that the structure
survives, because we cannot afford to lose it,\" Norway\'s deputy
foreign minister Maria Varteressian told Reuters. ARCTIC
\'EXCEPTIONALISM\' [[The Council]{.underline}]{.mark}, founded in 1996,
[[has long been]{.mark} seen as [a **key** arena for]{.mark}
**[collaboration]{.mark}**]{.underline} between the West and Russia,
producing binding agreements on environmental protection and
preservation. Russia makes up roughly a third of the entire Arctic
region and is behind nearly 70% of economic activity in high latitudes.
\"We knew this chairship would be an extremely challenging and difficult
one,\" said Norway\'s Morten Hoeglund, Chair of the Senior Arctic
Officials who is now tasked with balancing relations between the
Council\'s Western members and Russia. Russia\'s Arctic Council
ambassador did not respond to a request for comment for this article. At
the onset of the Ukraine war, many polar pundits heralded the end of
Arctic \"exceptionalism\" - a post-Cold War concept that characterises
the Arctic as such a unique place due to its geography and history that
it is immune to some geopolitical tensions and is therefore an arena for
peaceful cooperation. Some recent developments have reinforced the
pundits\' pessimism. Last September, Russia withdrew from the Barents
Euro-Arctic Council, another Arctic regional forum. And in February,
Russia suspended its annual voluntary payments to the Arctic Council,
citing the needs for \"real work\" to resume, involving the
participation of all member countries. However, [[the Arctic Council\'s
secretariat said]{.mark} in February [it would **resume** working group
meetings]{.mark} on environmental and safety issues in a virtual format,
with Russia at the table, and some [analysts saw]{.mark} grounds for
**[hope]{.mark}**.]{.underline} \"What we\'re seeing during Norway\'s
chairship shows that [[cooperation]{.mark} [is still
possible]{.mark},\"]{.underline} said Pavel Devyatkin, a Moscow-based
researcher with the U.S. think tank the Arctic Institute. [[The Council
working group]{.underline}]{.mark} dedicated to monitoring the region\'s
climate and environment [[will]{.mark} soon [publish three
reports]{.mark}]{.underline} --- on changes to the Arctic climate,
microplastic pollution and radioactivity --- that had been delayed by
the Ukraine war. [[The]{.mark} [radioactivity report required
**significant input** from Moscow]{.mark}]{.underline} as it has a
Russian co-lead author and includes extensive Russian data, said Rolf
Roedven, executive secretary of the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment
Programme working group. Norway and Russia share an Arctic border, and
collaborate on practical issues such as managing fisheries in the
Barents Sea --- work which has continued since the invasion of Ukraine.
Pragmatic cooperation at the technical or scientific level may be the
way to go, but contacts at the political level on the Council are
unthinkable while the war continues, officials said. \"We have to adapt
to a new reality,\" Hoeglund said. \"We have to accept \... that this is
a different reality than it was four years ago. It is certainly not
going to be anything resembling what it was back then\".

[[One might expect Russia, a revisionist power, to pursue changes in the
Arctic order]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} expect [the West to defend]{.mark}
that order. [Instead]{.mark}, it was [the West]{.mark} that most
actively [worked to abolish cooperation]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In 2014, Western countries reduced security cooperation with Russia and
stopped inviting it to the Arctic Security Forces Roundtable and to the
Northern Forum of General Staff (Narvestad, 2015). In 2014-2022,
**[[Russia repeatedly called for resuming dialogue between the Arctic
countries]{.mark}' militaries]{.underline}** (Arctic Council, 2017; MFA,
2019), and its official strategy focused on the development of its own
Arctic regions (Konyshev et al., 2017). [[Arctic cooperation]{.mark} at
the time [was]{.mark} mainly [undermined by anti-Russian
sanctions]{.mark}]{.underline} (Young, 2016; Bertelsen, 2020).

On the other hand, other forms of cooperation were intensified, as if to
make up for this damage. The Arctic Economic Council, proposed by Canada
and created in the fall of 2014, was joined by Russian private companies
(Exner-Pirot, 2016). Russia also became full member of the Arctic Coast
Guard Forum, initiated by the United States and established in 2015
(Arctic Portal, 2015). In the same year, the Arctic coastal states
signed the Oslo Declaration on the prohibition of unregulated fishing in
the Central Arctic Ocean (WTO, 2015).

[[In 2022]{.mark}, [the West again led the dismantling of
cooperation]{.mark}.]{.underline} On 3 and 4 March 2022, Western
countries suspended interaction with Russia in the Arctic Council (USDS,
2022) and BEAC (BEAC, 2022). [[Russia tried to carry on its duties as
chair of the Arctic Council]{.underline}]{.mark} (Zhuravel and
Timoshenko, 2023) [and officially withdrew from the BEAC only when
Finland refused to transfer chairmanship to Moscow as
scheduled.]{.underline}

Russia was not interested in reforming Arctic institutions because,
until 2022, it held an important position in them. [This reflected the
reality that half of Arctic land, and half of the Arctic's population,
are Russian. [Regardless of]{.mark} the state of Russia's economy or
[international politics]{.mark}, **[Russia's role in the Arctic is
key.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Russia's significance for the Arctic also entails the Arctic's
significance for Russia. The Arctic generates approximately 10% of
Russian GDP, 20% of Russian exports (Karaganov, 2021), 80% of Russian
gas, and 90% of Russian nickel and cobalt, as well as other resources of
key significance for the Russian and global economies (Likhacheva and
Stepanov, 2021). [The enormous [importance of the Arctic for Russia made
it a prime target for the West]{.mark}: it seized the opportunity [to
"punish" Russia for revisionist behavior]{.mark}, [seeking to uphold the
international status quo at the expense of the Arctic]{.mark} status
quo.]{.underline}

During the Cold War, attention paid to the Arctic focused primarily on
national security matters. Beginning in the mid-1990s, governments
broadened their gaze to consider the economic potential---and the
environmental challenges---of the region. Particularly in the last
decade, as a warming climate ushered in profound environmental changes
in the region, Arctic governments and residents have scrambled to stay
ahead of emerging issues. Coastlines are eroding, sea ice is vanishing,
and permafrost is thawing. These phenomena and others are already
causing serious problems in the Arctic and point to trouble ahead for
other parts of the planet. At the same time, a more open Arctic Ocean is
sparking ever greater interest in potential resource development,
shipping and tourism, among other opportunities. As a result, the Arctic
has witnessed a remarkable spurt in the numbers of international
institutions and arrangements designed to manage expanding human
activity in the region, and deepen human understanding of it.
[[Despite]{.mark} serious [tensions between Russia and]{.mark} other
[Arctic nations]{.mark} concerning other issues and parts of the world,
[Arctic governments have]{.mark} largely [chosen to **compartmentalize
the region**]{.mark}, setting those tensions aside in favor of
[**cooperating** in]{.mark} pursuit of **[shared interest]{.mark}s**.
That is, **until recently**]{.underline}. [[During]{.underline}]{.mark}
the last two years of the [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} administration,
[the spirit of international [cooperation that has]{.mark}]{.underline}
largely [characterized Arctic affairs [came under

reversed course on climate policies and found itself seriously [**out of
step** with other Arctic]{.mark} [governments]{.mark}]{.underline} in
that regard. At the same time, [Russia stepped up its efforts to rebuild
its military infrastructure]{.underline} and expand its capabilities in
the Arctic, and engaged in provocative actions against the West.
Finally, China declared itself a "near-Arctic state" and sought to
increase its influence in the region in ways that have caused concern.

### S \-\-- Russia Says Yes \-\-- General

#### Russia will cooperate -- responsibility means incentive for a solution.

"On thin ice: The Arctic Council's uncertain future"
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X24000587)

Whether the Member States wish it or not, change is now inevitable for
the Arctic Council. Climate change is forever altering the physical
geography of the Arctic, opening a once isolated region to the global
economy and intercontinental transportation routes. The North is no
longer a peripheral area of international relations; the "new" Arctic
will increasingly take center stage in foreign and economic policies.
The Council must now adapt both to the unprecedented situation that has
stalled its operations, and restructure itself to adapt to the
ecological and socioeconomic pressures reshaping the Arctic environment,
all while political and military tension threaten to destabilize the
region.

The war in Ukraine demonstrated that the Arctic is not immune to
complications of high politics and conflict far from its borders.
[[Regardless of the situation]{.mark} in Ukraine, [every effort must be
made to resume]{.mark} [Arctic Council operations with]{.mark} full
[Russia]{.mark}n participation.]{.underline} From a purely scientific
perspective, scientists and research institutes have previously noted
the loss of scientific mores during periods of conflict and war.88 With
the diplomatic fallout of the Ukraine War, the inability for some
scientists to engage in field work within Russian territory, along with
the freeze in certain projects, is already resulting in "significant
gaps" in Arctic research data.89 Additionally, the war increases the
critical nature of maintaining cooperation in the Arctic to reduce
military posturing and the risk of sparking active conflict;
[[the]{.mark} collaborative atmosphere of the [Arctic Council
has]{.mark} until now [provided opportunities for communication]{.mark}
and diplomacy [on issues]{.mark} beyond the Arctic]{.underline} through
the ups and downs of East-West relations.90 At the start of its
Chairmanship [[Russia]{.mark} **reminded** the Council that it has
[worked **consistently** to guard the Arctic "as the]{.mark} [territory
of peace]{.mark}, stability [and]{.mark} constructive
[cooperation]{.mark}."91 [It added that Arctic States "carry
special]{.mark} [**responsibility** for the]{.mark} future of the
[region]{.mark} and its inhabitants."92 [This]{.mark} sense of [**duty**
should encourage]{.mark} the Member States to find [a solution]{.mark}
to the current impasse.]{.underline}

A return to the original spirit of Gorbachev's Murmansk speech could
restore the congeniality between the Member States. Rebuilding trust
between all the Arctic States is paramount to Arctic Ocean governance;
efforts at Arctic conservation can only succeed if the coastal Arctic
States, in particular, work together. [Member States should]{.underline}
revisit the foundation of their Arctic accomplishments, and
[re-initiate]{.underline} scientific collaboration and knowledge sharing
that includes [projects in Russia, the largest Arctic State. [The Ottawa
Declaration, and the]{.mark} Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy
([AEPS]{.mark}) before it, could [provide the **key** to]{.mark}
renewing goodwill and re-examining the future of [Arctic
governance]{.mark}. The Council should [focus on shared]{.mark} threats
and [challenges]{.mark}, bearing in mind the Principle of the Common
Concern of Humankind, [to revitalize **peer-to-peer dialogue** and
collaboration]{.mark}.]{.underline} The threats of climate change in the
fragile Arctic environment demand enhanced scientific cooperation "to
monitor and improve our understanding of how and to what degree the
Arctic climate is changing."93 [Should relations sour even further and
Russia choose to exit the Arctic Council, the international community
would suffer with the permanent loss]{.underline} of this forum which
has furthered understanding of complex ecological processes and assisted
in vital policy work. As many have noted, "[Russia's
importance]{.underline}, especially for Arctic environmental and climate
research, [is irreplaceable."]{.underline}94

#### Russia [says]{.underline} yes---historical [precedent]{.underline} and current policy.

Arctic Council Pause under Russian Chairmanship

The Arctic Council was created in 1996, bringing together the Arctic
states to cooperate on issues pertaining to the environment and
sustainable development (Arctic Council, n.d.). It was also an outcome
of Mikhail Gorbachev's 1989 speech calling for peace and cooperation in
the Arctic (Gricius & Fitz, 2022). In other words, [[the Arctic
**Council** was a way]{.mark} [to soften borders between Russia and the
other Arctic states]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Following]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[2014]{.mark} Russian annexation
of Crimea]{.underline}, some [[**disturbances** were
**observed**]{.mark} within the Arctic Counci]{.underline}l,4 yet,
[[work carried on as normal]{.mark} due to a "[separation of issue
areas]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Byers, 2017, p. 389). That said, a
potential for escalation remained (Käpylä & Mikkola, 2019), which turned
out to be the case following the invasion in 2022.

On March 3, [[2022]{.underline}]{.mark}, the governments of [Canada,
the]{.underline} [United States, Iceland, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and
Finland]{.underline} each [released an [identical statement]{.mark}
explaining]{.underline} that international [[**cooperation** is **no
longer possible**]{.mark} with Russia]{.underline} and that each of the
"states are temporarily pausing participation in all meetings of the
Council and its subsidiary bodies"5 (Global Affairs Canada, 2022a) until
a way forward can be determined. This decision was seemingly taken by
the states themselves as consensus would not be reached within the
Arctic Council (Koivurova & Shibata, 2023). These seven states, however,
were not the only Arctic Council members to speak out about the war.
Three Permanent Participant organizations6 ---the Gwich'in Council
International (GCI), the Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC), and the Saami
Council---released their own statements in the weeks following that were
in support of the Arctic Council's pause (Gwich'in Council
International, 2022a; Inuit Circumpolar Council, 2022; Saami Council,
2022). The Arctic Athabaskan Council (AAC) did not release a statement
in March 2022, but released a statement in February 2022 following the
invasion that condemned the war, addressed Indigenous rights, and
expressed their concern for the future of the Arctic Council (Arctic
Athabaskan Council, 2022). RAIPON released a statement in support of the
war,7 a position that was not supported by other Russian Indigenous
leaders (Zellen, 2023).

At the start of June 2022, [[Russia indicated]{.mark} that it [**still
valued** the work of the Arctic **Council**]{.mark} and that
**[activities should resume]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Edvardsen, 2022). On
June 8, 2022, [another [joint statement]{.mark}]{.underline}8 was
[[released by Arctic states]{.mark}, except Russia]{.underline},
reconfirming the importance of the Arctic Council and explaining that
"[[projects that do not involve]{.mark} the participation of the
[Russia]{.mark}n Federation]{.underline}" (Global Affairs Canada, 2022b)
may [[resume]{.underline}]{.mark}. While this was a step forward, it
ultimately [[created **a border** within the governance
structure]{.mark} of the Arctic Council]{.underline} between Russia and
the other member states. The exclusion of Russia and Russian researchers
from Arctic Council activities has affected a number of projects: "about
a third of the council's 130 projects are on hold, new projects cannot
go ahead and existing ones cannot be renewed" (Pamuk et al., 2023).
Moreover, climate data from Russia is no longer being shared with
colleagues in western countries and the scientific networks with Russian
researchers can be lost (Andreeva, 2023; see also: Collins, 2022).

deal with hard security.

Korchunov [[stressed]{.mark} the council\'s [strong history of
depoliticized dialogue]{.mark} in high latitudes]{.underline}. \"The
Arctic should remain as a territory of peace \... and thus, this unique
format should not be subject to the spill-over effect of any
extraregional events,\" he told Reuters.

But in light of the invasion of Ukraine, which Russia calls a \"special
operation,\" the majority of the Arctic Council felt differently.

Russia accounts for roughly a third of the entire Arctic region and is
behind nearly 70% of economic activity in high latitudes.

\"For us [there is no alternative to uninterrupted sustainable
development of our Arctic territories]{.underline},\" Korchunov said.

While the remainder of the Arctic Council pursued a \"pause in
cooperation,\" Arctic representatives in Russia would refocus \"the \...
Chairmanship toward addressing our domestic needs in the region,\"
Korchunov added.

All events organized under the Russian chairmanship of the Arctic
Council, he said, would go ahead as planned, aside from official
meetings with the other senior Arctic officials.

Understanding Russia's aspirations in the Arctic

A key to navigating future collaboration on emerging diseases and other
health risks in the Arctic is a deeper understanding of the future
Russia sees for itself as a leading power in the region. [[Russia
controls]{.mark} about [45% of the]{.mark} geographic territory of the
[Arctic]{.mark}, including the **N**orthern **S**ea
**R**oute]{.underline}---which is [in Russia's **e**xclusive
**e**conomic **z**one]{.underline}---a particularly useful seaway for
moving cargo between the North Pacific region and Northern Europe.
Russia's position in the Arctic and its role in current geopolitical
crises contribute to broader debates on the effectiveness of "soft law"
(such as recommendations and codes of conduct) and diplomacy in various
areas of international scientific cooperation, particularly for health
and climate issues.

Already, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in [[Ukraine
have **shifted** Russian **foreign** **policy**]{.mark} approaches to
health and science deeper into the security realm.]{.underline} The
invasion prompted many Western countries to impose a range of
[scientific sanctions]{.underline} on Russia, and though individual
researchers are not banned from cross-border collaboration, travel
between Russia and the West is more complicated. The number of research
collaborations between Russian scientists and those from the United
States and European countries has fallen, as has the attendance of
Russian researchers at international academic conferences. 

A year into the war with Ukraine, [Russian president Vladimir Putin
presented a [new Foreign Policy Concept]{.mark}]{.underline} (FPC), an
outline of Russia's national interests, strategic goals, challenges, and
main directions of foreign policy, which had last been updated in 2016.
The new FPC emphasizes Arctic policy in commitments to "counteracting
the unfriendly states' policy aimed at militarization of the region" and
"establishing a mutually beneficial cooperation with the non-Arctic
states pursuing a constructive policy toward Russia." These [[statements
signal Russia's strategic interest in **maintaining** a formal
**presence** on the **Arctic** **Council**]{.mark} to preserve its
political power in the Arctic]{.underline} while testing new bilateral
partnerships in the region.

[[Global health priorities]{.underline}]{.mark} in the FPC [[suggest
Russia's continuing interest in international
**discussions**]{.underline}]{.mark}, but with variations in focus
across regions. The document links global health to environmental
protection and climate change, and goals include "increasing efficiency
of international cooperation in the area of health care and preventing
its politicization," as well as "consolidating international efforts in
order to prevent the extension of dangerous infectious diseases" and
quickly responding to crises, epidemics, and pandemics. Russia [[remains
a member of the]{.mark} **[W]{.mark}**orld **[H]{.mark}**ealth
**[O]{.mark}**rganization]{.underline} (WHO) and is active in convenings
related to WHO's International Health Regulations and the pandemic
accord led by its Intergovernmental Negotiating Body.

MOSCOW (AP) --- Russia's President Vladimir Putin said Thursday that
President Donald Trump's push for control over Greenland wasn't
surprising given longtime U.S. interest in the mineral-rich territory.

Speaking at a policy forum in the Artic port of Murmansk, Putin noted
that the United States first considered plans to win control over
Greenland in the 19th century, and then offered to buy it from Denmark
after World War II.

"It can look surprising only at first glance and it would be wrong to
believe that this is some sort of extravagant talk by the current U.S.
administration," Putin said. "It's obvious that the United States will
continue to systematically advance its geostrategic, military-political
and economic interests in the Arctic."

Trump irked much of Europe by suggesting that the United States should
in some form control the self-governing, mineral-rich territory of
Denmark, a U.S. ally and NATO member. As the nautical gateway to the
Arctic and North Atlantic approaches to North America, Greenland has
broader strategic value as both China and Russia seek access to its
waterways and natural resources.

U.S. Vice President JD Vance and his wife are due to visit an American
military base in Greenland on Friday on a trip that was scaled back
after an uproar by Greenlanders and Danes.

Speaking on Thursday, Putin noted that [[Russia]{.mark} is **[worried
about NATO]{.mark}**'s activities [in the Arctic]{.mark} and [will
respond]{.mark} [by strengthening]{.mark} its [military capability
in]{.mark} the [polar]{.mark} region]{.underline}.

"We are certainly concerned about NATO members describing the Far North
as the region of possible conflicts," he said, noting that Russia's
neighbors Finland and Sweden have joined the alliance.
"[Russia]{.underline} has never threatened anyone in the Arctic, but we
[will closely follow the developments and mount an **appropriate
response** by increasing our military capability and
[modernizing]{.mark} military [infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline}."

[[Russia]{.mark} has sought to [assert]{.mark} its [influence
over]{.mark} wide areas of the [Arctic **in
competition**]{.mark}]{.underline} with the United States, Canada,
Denmark and Norway as shrinking polar ice from the warming planet offers
new opportunities for resources and shipping routes. [[China]{.mark}
also has shown an [increasing interest]{.mark} in the
region]{.underline}, believed to hold up to one-fourth of the Earth's
undiscovered oil and gas.

["We [won't allow]{.mark} any [infringement on]{.mark} our [country's
sovereignty]{.mark}, reliably safeguard our national interests [while
supporting peace and stability]{.mark} in the polar region," Putin
said.]{.underline}

While pledging to strengthen Russia's military foothold in the Arctic,
[Putin said that [Moscow]{.mark} was **[holding the door]{.mark}** [open
to **broader international cooperation**]{.mark} in the
region]{.underline}.

"[The stronger our positions will be, the more significant the results
will be and the broader opportunities we will have to [launch
international projects]{.mark} in the Arctic [involving]{.mark} the
countries that are friendly to us, and, possibly, [Western
countries]{.mark}]{.underline} if they show interest in joint work. I'm
sure the time will come to launch such projects."

Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund and Putin's
envoy for international investment who took part in talks with U.S.
officials, told reporters last month that Russia and the U.S. should
develop joint energy ventures.

"We need joint projects, including in the Arctic and other regions," he
said.

#### Bilateral US-Russia talks set the table for further Arctic cooperation.

[[Russia and the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[discussed]{.mark}]{.underline} possible [[cooperation on energy]{.mark}
projects [in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} at a meeting in Saudi
Arabia Tuesday, a top Russian negotiator told POLITICO. Kirill Dmitriev,
who heads the state-owned Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), said
[the [economic conversations had been]{.mark} about [broad]{.mark}
strokes,]{.underline} but that the two sides had discussed some
"specific areas of cooperation." "It was more a general discussion ---
maybe [[joint projects]{.mark} in the Arctic]{.underline}. We
specifically discussed the Arctic," Dmitriev said by phone as he boarded
a flight home after the talks in Riyadh. The negotiations, which
sidelined Ukraine and Europe, have sparked angst and urgency in key
European capitals as U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian leader
Vladimir Putin look set to decide on Ukraine's future without
substantial input from Kyiv or its Western allies. For his part, [Trump
aims to expand American influence in the Arctic]{.underline}, having
repeatedly mused about acquiring Greenland from Denmark --- and has
refused to rule out using military force or economic coercion to seize
control of the massive island with its vast mineral wealth and key
strategic location. U.S. oil major ExxonMobil had partnered with Russian
state oil major Rosneft to explore for hydrocarbons in the high Arctic,
but pulled out in 2018 following the imposition of Western sanctions in
response to Russia's initial invasion of Ukraine in 2014. Dmitriev was
part of a Russian delegation that included Foreign Minister Sergey
Lavrov and Putin's foreign policy adviser Yuri Ushakov and was in Saudi
Arabia for initial discissions on Ukraine. Tuesday's talks were the
first contact between officials from the two sides following a call
between Trump and Putin last week. He commented on the economic track of
the talks, which he described as good, but declined to go into detail on
the political discussions. Secretary of State Marco Rubio led the U.S.
delegation, accompanied by National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and
Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff. "Positive after the Biden
administration destroyed all of the communication, destroyed all of the
discussion," he said. In further remarks, Dmitriev said he had presented
an estimate by the RDIF that U.S. businesses had lost around \$300
billion as a result of leaving Russia following Putin's full-scale
invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. "[[There is an understanding that
bad relations]{.mark} between Russia and the U.S. actually [cost]{.mark}
a lot to American [business, and there are ways to have]{.mark}
productive [cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline} benefit both Russia and the
U.S." he said. "I would not want to have unrealistic expectations for
the process going forward, but I think [[joint investments between
Russia and the U.S. are]{.mark} now more [likely]{.mark}]{.underline}
after this meeting than before," he added.

The chairmanship of the Arctic Council rotates every two years among its
eight members. The United States most recently chaired the council from
May 2015 to May 2017, a term that spanned two U.S. administrations.
Indeed, when Secretary of State Rex Tillerson presided over the Arctic
Council ministerial meeting in Fairbanks, Alaska, in 2017, he brought to
fruition a set of programs and projects that the Obama administration
had launched two years earlier[. [The U]{.underline}]{.mark}[nited
[S]{.mark}tates [has found]{.mark}]{.underline} many [[ways to exercise
leadership within]{.mark} [the council]{.mark}]{.underline} even while
not leading the body as a whole. Experts from the United States have
very frequently spearheaded the work that the council undertakes, such
as the 2004 Arctic Climate Impact Assessment and the 2009 Arctic Marine
Shipping Assessment. [Three times in the past decade, the council
created task forces to negotiate new treaties for the Arctic
region.]{.underline} In each case, [the United States co-led these task
forces,]{.underline} which produced in quick succession (at least by the
normal standards of diplomacy) the 2011 Agreement on Cooperation on
Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue in the Arctic, the 2013
Agreement on Cooperation on Marine Oil Pollution Preparation and
Response in the Arctic, and the 2017 Agreement on Enhancing
International Scientific Cooperation in the Arctic. It is worth noting
that [[Russia]{.mark} also [co-chaired each]{.mark} of these [task
forces]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [[the success]{.mark} of each
endeavor [**depended substantially** on cooperation between Russia and
the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} in working through the
challenges that each group confronted. Having served as U.S. co-chair
for the first two task forces, I can say from experience that successful
leadership of the [negotiations required]{.underline} a great deal of
[behind-the-scenes [communication and trust]{.mark}, which [occurred
**despite rising bilateral tensions**]{.mark} at the time.]{.underline}
Similar [communication and trust]{.underline} also [existed between the

[was established **after**]{.mark} **the [Russian invasion]{.mark} of
Crimea** [and]{.mark}]{.underline} the [resulting international
[sanctions]{.mark}. [This demonstrates the willingness]{.mark} of the

with Russia]{.underline}, Arctic states continue to preside over a
well-governed region operating under extensive national and
international legal frameworks.

[The [A]{.mark}rctic [C]{.mark}ouncil [remains]{.mark} the [**leading
forum** for Arctic cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline} and is
[[complemented by]{.underline}]{.mark} other regional and international
organizations, forums, [declarations and **[legally binding
treaties]{.mark}**]{.underline}. These include several UN organizations
that make decisions affecting the Arctic on a wide range of global
issues, including climate change.

1\. Reinforcing the Arctic Council

[**[Canada]{.mark} is firmly [committed]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} the
[enduring value of]{.mark} the [A]{.mark}rctic [C]{.mark}ouncil
[and]{.mark} is [adhering]{.mark} [to]{.mark} its established [Rules of
Procedure]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Canada remains focused on continuing
the council's important work for the benefit of the Arctic
region]{.underline} and the people living there, including Indigenous
Peoples.

Since 2021, our [Global Arctic Leadership Initiative]{.underline} has
[funded]{.underline} the [establishment of a permanent
secretariat]{.underline} of the Arctic Council's Sustainable Development
Working Group in Canada and [[provided over \$2
million]{.mark}]{.underline} in funding [[for]{.underline}]{.mark} more
than 25 [[A]{.underline}]{.mark}rctic [[C]{.underline}]{.mark}ouncil
[[initiatives]{.underline}]{.mark} with national, civil society and
Indigenous partners.

The [A]{.underline}rctic [C]{.underline}ouncil [exists thanks in part to
Canadian]{.underline} and Indigenous [leadership]{.underline}. Canada
will not allow Russia's actions to undermine the integrity or
functionality of this important body. The people of the Arctic, who
benefit so deeply from the important work of the council, should not be
made to suffer because of Russia's choices.

We will increase our contributions to the Arctic Council to allow for
more Canadian engagement and leadership in council projects and greater
institutional support for the council, as well as provide funding for
innovative Indigenous and youth ideas in the council. This support is
critically important as the council continues to increase its
activities.

[[Canada will]{.mark} increase its leadership in the
council]{.underline} in preparation for Canada's third chairship of the
Arctic Council, from 2029 to 2031. Working with Canadian and Arctic
Council partners, Canada will [[meaningfully engage the]{.mark}
Permanent [Participants]{.mark} from Canada]{.underline}, territorial
and provincial governments of Canada and other Indigenous partners on
the planning and development of Canada's Arctic Council chairship
program.

Those essential [building blocks will also provide guidance on how
Canada engages in other international polar processes]{.underline}, such
as the International Polar Year: 2032 to 2033, which is an opportunity
to showcase Canada's leadership through scientific and technological
achievements, as well as by amplifying Indigenous Peoples' voices and
their rich knowledge.

Ocean Governance Meeting the challenge of coordinating a dynamic regime
complex"
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308597X21003377#bib36)
atn

The growing collection of cooperative arrangements dealing with Arctic
maritime issues constitutes what analysts treat as a regime complex in
the sense of a collection of distinct elements dealing with overlapping
issue domains or regions that are not related to one another in a
hierarchical fashion \[1\], \[2\], \[3\]. Today, there is no overarching
arrangement endowed with the authority and capacity to sort out
interactions in this dense complex to alleviate tensions or conflicts
and to identify opportunities to promote synergy in the activities of
the individual elements of the Arctic Ocean regime complex. What is
more, this complex is dynamic. New elements (e.g. the Polar Code, the
science agreement, the Central Arctic Ocean Fisheries Agreement) have
come on stream on a regular basis in recent years, despite the rise of
political tensions in the Arctic and the anxieties of those who fear the
securitization of the dialogue regarding Arctic issues. [[Additional
arrangements]{.mark} may well [arise]{.mark} in the coming years,
[addressing concerns]{.mark} relating [to]{.mark} noise pollution,
invasive species, marine genetic resources, deep seabed mining, or
[submarine cables]{.mark}.]{.underline} As the density of this regime
complex increases, the need for harmonization among the individual
elements will rise \[36\]. In the coming years, we expect this to emerge
as the critical challenge for those concerned with Arctic Ocean
governance.

Some analysts respond to this challenge by arguing that there is a need
to develop a comprehensive legally binding Arctic Ocean Treaty including
a broad group of signatories. Without going into detail regarding this
suggestion, however, it is easy to see that this idea is a non-starter
in political terms at this juncture. There is no prospect of reaching
agreement on the identity of the participants; the Arctic coastal states
in particular would treat such an initiative as incompatible with the
spirit of the 2008 Ilulissat Declaration \[37\]. [[Those
associated]{.mark} with each of the individual regime elements [would be
motivated to protect their]{.mark} own [turf under]{.mark} the terms of
[an Arctic]{.mark} Ocean [Treaty]{.mark}]{.underline}. Though there are
exceptions, legally binding arrangements often present problems
regarding the need for agility in adapting to rapidly changing
conditions. Moreover, we have entered a period of rising political
sensitivities regarding Arctic matters, creating an environment that is
not conducive to the negotiation of the terms of broad legally binding
agreements. All-in-all, there is no basis for expecting that we can
address the need for coordination regarding the Arctic Ocean regime
complex through the negotiation of an Arctic Ocean Treaty during the
foreseeable future.

Nevertheless, the challenge of finding ways to harmonize the elements of
the Arctic Ocean regime complex is destined to become increasingly
pressing in the coming years. As the impacts of focused human activities
in the Arctic (e.g. commercial shipping) increase and the impacts of
broader human activities on the Arctic (e.g. climate change) become more
severe, this challenge will become more urgent. [[An alternative]{.mark}
[approach to]{.mark} addressing the challenge of [coordinating]{.mark}
the Arctic Ocean regime complex [is reflected in the]{.mark} [work of
the]{.mark} Task Force on Arctic Marine Cooperation ([TFAMC]{.mark})
created under the provisions of the Arctic Council's 2015 Iqaluit
Declaration and renewed for a second two-year term under the terms of
the 2017 Fairbanks Declaration.]{.underline}

The Iqaluit Declaration called on the TFAMC "to assess future needs for
a regional seas program or other mechanism, as appropriate, for
increased cooperation in Arctic marine areas" \[31\]. [[The Task
Force]{.mark} reported]{.underline} back in 2017 that it was unable to
recommend specific measures to increase "cooperation in Arctic marine
areas" [but [requested a new]{.mark} [mandate to focus]{.mark}
specifically [on the work of the Arctic Council relating to maritime
issues]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Fairbanks Declaration authorized TFAMC
II and provided it with a mandate to present "terms of reference (ToRs)
for a possible new subsidiary body, and recommendations for
complementary enhancements to existing Arctic Council mechanisms"
\[38\]. Setting aside the idea of creating a new subsidiary body, TFAMC
II returned in 2019 with a recommendation to establish "a SAO-based
mechanism to guide the marine work of the Arctic Council and improve
coordination on marine arrangements in the Arctic Council" \[39\]. The
onset of the Covid-19 crisis delayed the launching of this SAO-based
marine mechanism (SMM) until the fall of 2020. Its initial meeting took
place in the form of four webinars on a range of current marine issues.
At this writing, the eventual fate of the SMM remains unclear \[21\].
The 2021 Reykjavik Declaration adopted at the close of the Icelandic
Chairmanship looks forward to the use of the mechanism to promote
continuing dialogues on marine issues \[40\]. But there is no indication
that the solidification of this arrangement will be accorded priority
during the 2021--2023 Russian Chairmanship \[41\].

[[Recent years have seen reduction of]{.mark} the [constraints]{.mark}
placed [upon digitalization of the Arctic]{.mark} by limited
connectivity via technological rollout that extends the range of
opportunities open to individuals and communities.]{.underline} [[The
Arctic Council]{.mark}'s]{.underline} Task Force on Improved
Connectivity in the Arctic (2019) [[highlights a range of technolo-gies
such as]{.underline}]{.mark} low-Earth orbit, medium-Earth orbit, and
highly elliptical orbit satel-lites, narrow-band options, terrestrial
and **[[undersea fibre cables]{.mark}, [high frequency communication for
marine areas]{.mark}, [and mobile wireless]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
alongside improved battery backup, as means of improving digital
connectivity and network robustness in dif-ferent Arctic contexts. These
options are acknowledged by the ACWG (2021, p. 4), [[noting
international consensus on the need to improve Arctic
connectivity]{.underline}]{.mark} but also the local context of such
work as well as the unprecedented extent of broader con- temporary
changes to climate and regional economies. Specifically, the ACWG report
lists unique characteristics of the Arctic as an operational
environment: land- scape, weather, generally low population densities,
cultural diversity, lack of or gaps in infrastructure, differing
regulatory structures, and a need for public investment. Recognizing the
impact of these factors, ACWG (2021, p. 9) concludes that "Arctic
projects \[have\] to be evaluated on a different set of criteria" to the
wider world as performance and cost modelling analyses used for most
projects are unsuitable to the Arctic. Such criteria might, for
instance, include supporting an Arctic commu-nity's longer-term
development that requires unconventional cost-benefit analyses and
unusual on-the-ground solutions. [The highlighting of Arctic contexts
and their growing implicit acceptance by national governments is as much
a key development as emerging technologies and climate
change]{.underline}.

**Arctic Council is key to sharing information on cyber security**

Another area of concern of [[growing importance]{.mark} for sustainable
development [in the Arctic is digitalization]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Providing fast and fair access to the internet everywhere is essential
for the participation of Arctic residents in the global digital economy.
The work of [the [Arctic Council Task Force]{.mark} on Improved
Connectivity in the Arctic [is a]{.mark} good [example of how the AC can
react to new challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[This will enable the
AC to advise on]{.mark} related issues such as
[cybersecurity]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Through this work, providing
information to its member states, [[the AC can contribute to]{.mark} the
equitable provision of [access to high tech]{.mark}]{.underline}
(artificial intelligence, space applications, etc.) also for small and
medium-sized enterprises, which continue to play an important role for
local economies in many parts of the Arctic. This is a good example of
how the AC creates real value for Arctic communities. Like the inclusion
of indigenous peoples' voices in decision-making processes, [the
emphasis on [knowledge sharing is]{.mark} part of [the core]{.mark}
identity [of the AC]{.mark}, [which already provides access to
high-value scientific information]{.mark}.]{.underline} It has neither
the infrastructure nor budget to actually create high tech. In so far,
it differs from technical institutions such as the European Space Agency
(ESA), which cooperates with the EU and provides open access Copernicus
satellite data for commercial use (European Space Agency, 2021), which,
in turn, is also being used in Arctic contexts, for example, when
determining sea ice coverage, in the monthly reports published by the
European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, an independent
organization which utilizes the Copernicus data (see, e.g., European
Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, 2021).

[The AC's [working groups]{.mark} not only [provide technical
information]{.mark} or raw data but reports which]{.underline},
according to Durfee and Johnstone, "are highly regarded as authoritative
and impartial assessments of the state of the Arctic" (Durfee and
Johnstone, 2019, p.75) [[and support]{.mark} the Senior Arctic
[Officials who meet in the AC with recommendations for
policies]{.mark}]{.underline} (ibid., p.74).

The AC is not an intergovernmental organization (ibid., p.78), nor does
it have international legal subjectivity (ibid., p.78), but [it has
great practical relevance for the governance of the region]{.underline}
(ibid.). [Within the limitations of its mandate, in particular
concerning the sharing of knowledge, [the AC can make
contributions]{.mark} to the sustainable development efforts by
different Arctic actors. The emphasis [on knowledge]{.mark} is also
important for building a basis fundament for future generations in the
Arctic by facilitating high-level [education and access to
information]{.mark}]{.underline}. While the creation and operation of
educational institutions are seen as a national and local task,
educational institutions in the Arctic already have a tradition of
cooperation, for example, through the University of the Arctic.
Digitalization and cooperation across borders can contribute to closing
the gap which still persists in the non-urban parts of the Arctic.
Education, one of the SDGs (SDG 4), is essential for ensuring the
sustainability of development across different fields. Today, utilizing
educational opportunities usually requires physical relocation to
cities. Digitalization makes education accessible of location, thereby
reducing the risk of outward migration away from rural and remote areas
(which, in turn, impacts sustainability efforts). Through its efforts in
the field of digitalization, the AC therefore also has a positive
influence on access to education. Also, in addition to the explicitly
sustainability-related work of the SDWG, the work accomplished in other
working groups, for example, concerning the protection of the natural
environment, is closely connected to sustainable development.
Sustainability requires a view of the big picture and a capacity to pay
attention to detail when and wherever needed. Not all activities of the
AC related to sustainable development are labeled as such.

In these early stages in the exploration of Arctic marine mineral
resources, efforts have focused on gaining scientific knowledge and
understanding of the extent of mineral resources on the continental
shelf and in the Area of the Arctic, and the ecosystems in which these
resources are found. Scientific knowledge of the Arctic's mineral
resources and their surrounding marine ecosystems is being pursued
through various fora of Arctic scientific cooperation, the first example
of which is the Arctic Council. [Firstly, [the Arctic Council's Working
Group on the Protection of the Marine Environment]{.mark}]{.underline}
(hereinafter 'PAME') [is working with the ICES and the North Pacific
Marine Science Organization]{.underline} (hereinafter 'PICES') to
produce an integrated ecosystem assessment of the Central Arctic Ocean.
The terms of reference of the Joint ICES/PICES/PAME Working Group on the
Integrated Assessment of the Central Arctic Ocean (hereinafter 'WGICA')
[[include the assessment of potential effects]{.underline}]{.mark} of
recent, ongoing and future climatic and oceanographic changes on human
activities, [[which include the exploitation of seabed
minerals]{.underline}]{.mark}.50 In line with its mandate, the Working
Group's recent report highlights the threat that ocean mining may
present if it expands into the Arctic.51 More extensive reports on the
potential exploitation of seabed minerals are expected to be issued by
the WGICA in the coming years.

A second forum for Arctic scientific cooperation is facilitated by the
Scientific Cooperation Agreement, which builds on Part XIII of UNCLOS
and includes provisions to 'enhance cooperation in Scientific Activities
in order to increase effectiveness and efficiency in the development of
scientific knowledge about the Arctic'.52 The scientific cooperation
envisaged by the Agreement is evidenced by the work of the Arctic States
and other stakeholders in their participation in the UN Decade of Ocean
Science for Sustainable Development (2021--2030) (hereinafter 'Ocean
Decade').53 The Ocean Decade is an initiative organized under the
auspices of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (hereinafter 'UNESCO') to provide for a common framework
for the management of ocean science for the benefit of humanity.54 The
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (hereinafter 'IOC') of UNESCO
has enlisted the support of regional workshops in the development of an
Implementation Plan for the Ocean Decade. Arctic stakeholders organized
to support the IOC's initiative by developing the Ocean Decade Arctic
Action Plan (hereinafter 'Action Plan').55 One of the resulting
transformative solutions proposed in the Action Plan includes, in part,
mapping and increasing the knowledge of the deep seabed as a means of
identifying the potential impacts of Arctic change on emerging maritime
industries.56 52 Scientific Cooperation Agreement, op. cit., Art. 2. 53

Decade Arctic Action Plan refers to the high level of support the Arctic
States have given to policy, science and innovation, as evidenced in the
Scientific Cooperation Agreement. 56 Ibid., pp. 27--28. Thirdly, another
forum for scientific cooperation that may address future exploration and
exploitation of mineral resources in the Arctic is the Arctic Science
Ministerial process, which was first convened by the United States in
2016 under the auspices of the Arctic Council, with the aim of effecting
greater Arctic science cooperation.57 Two years later, Germany hosted
the Second Arctic Science Ministerial.58

The Third Arctic Science Ministerial was co-hosted by Japan and Iceland
in 2021 in Japan.59 57 Arctic Science Ministerial, 'Conference
Background'. Available online (accessed 24 March 2021). 58 Ibid. 59 3rd
Arctic Science Ministerial. Available online (accessed 15 July 2021).

Lastly, the International Arctic Science Committee (hereinafter 'IASC')
is a leading international science organization in the Arctic.60 It was
first founded by the Arctic States but has since widened its membership
to 23 members.61 The IASC's Marine Working Group would be a likely forum
for scientific cooperation relating to DSM activities in the coming
years.62 60 International Arctic Science Committee. Available online
(accessed 24 March 2021). 61 Ibid. 62 Ibid.

Although there is no formal coordination amongst the fora of cooperation
described above, an aim of the Action Plan is to foster an inclusive
approach that creates momentum within the community of stakeholders in
the Arctic to 'deliver transformative ocean solutions for sustainable
development in the Arctic'.63 Therefore, maintaining momentum and
strengthening this inclusive approach through the Third Arctic
Ministerial and the IASC (among others) is seen as essential to meeting
the overall aims of the Ocean Decade.64 Thus, given that DSM activities
are at in early stage of development in the Arctic, it is likely that
the Action Plan will serve as the means through which the relevant fora
of scientific cooperation will interact for the purpose of obtaining
scientific knowledge and understanding of the Arctic deep seabed. 63

Conclusion

[[There is a]{.mark} relative [lack of development of regulations for
DSM activities in the Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is indicative of
the significant challenges that are inherent in conducting such
activities. The environmental vulnerability of the area, the extreme
conditions of ice and darkness and the lack of infrastructure to support
such activities are a few factors that may have hindered development.65
Another important challenge to the development of DSM regulations is the
lack of knowledge on the morphology and topography of the seabed of the
Arctic. [Initiatives such as the Seabed]{.underline} 2030 (initiative to
map 100 per cent of the ocean floor by 2030),66 [together with the
scientific cooperation initiatives described above, are intended to
provide stakeholders with the requisite knowledge to inform their
decision making on the regulation of the potential future exploitation
of marine mineral resources in the Arctic]{.underline}. [[Regardless
of]{.mark} the [progress and success of]{.mark} these
[initiatives]{.mark}]{.underline} (among others), [the regulation of
[future DSM activities in the Arctic will need to be]{.mark} based on
science, made consistent with the work of the International Seabed

A. [U.S. Courts Will Likely be Ineffective Forums for]{.underline}
Adjudication of Complaints Arising from [Mineral Mining Environmental
Disasters on the Ocean]{.underline}

Remedies issued by the judiciary serve an important function in
redressing wrongs in an ex-post fashion where ex-ante regulation may
have failed or where an actor failed to abide by regulations. There are
two significant barriers a future plaintiff may face if injured in some
fashion by deep-sea mineral mining activities: (1) if the harm is felt
on a global scale, both federal common law and the special injury
requirement erect significant barriers to recovery; (2) deep-sea mineral
mining litigation will likely occur under admiralty jurisdiction, and
with admiralty jurisdiction comes limitation of liability, which would
limit recovery to the value of the vessel.

As discussed in the environmental impact portion of this paper, one
potential injury may involve plume creation on a massive scale that
destroys, or irreparably damages, the ocean ecosystem. Plaintiffs
seeking redress for injuries sustained from large-scale environmental
impacts face an uncertain future with regard to proper venue and
controlling law, however.69 If a defendant is able to successfully
remove a case to admiralty court, it is likely that under current rules,
the defendant would only be liable up to the value of the vessel
involved in the incident. Though domestic judiciaries are not the sole
source solution for deterring bad behavior and redressing wrongs, this
paper argues that determining proper liability limits in a similar
manner to the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 will be helpful in erecting an
effective regime that future plaintiffs can rely on. Federal legislation
can be a powerful tool in this department to properly adjust incentives.

1\. Environmental Concerns with Deep-Sea Mineral Mining One of the
greatest unknowns associated with deep-sea mineral mining is the
environmental impacts of those efforts.70 These impacts include
immediate effects of deep-sea mining on known flora and fauna in
addition to potential second order effects on the ocean ecosystem as a
whole. Absent the occurrence of large-scale commercial mining projects,
these effects remain conjecture, however. Researchers are concerned with
both the effects of mining on the ocean floor and of sediment plumes
that mining activities create.71 Current deep-sea mining methods involve
using a collector vehicle to gather mineral nodules that are then
brought to a surface ship for processing.72 This vacuum process gathers
all material, including nodules and any flora and fauna that may be
collocated with these minerals, from the top ten to fifteen centimeters
of the ocean floor.73 After the nodules are pumped to the surface
processing ship, the minerals are separated from unwanted materials,
creating a slurry, which is then released back into the water, releasing
a second sediment plume.74 Though the effects of these plumes are not
well understood, one study suggests that plumes might be more
localized.75 The general concern with plume creation is a plumes
potential impact on the ocean ecosystem, whether through the
disbursement of toxic materials released throughout the water column or
sediment clogging filter feeding organisms, among other things.76 In
addition to the concern about sediment plume creation at the ocean
floor, the deep ocean regenerates at a glacial rate: new sediment
accumulates at a rate of about one millimeter every thousand years.77
Thus, this method, which is the only method predicted to become
commercially viable in the near future, functionally means that areas
disturbed by such activity would be unlikely to recover.78 Aside from
sediment plumes, environmental researchers are also concerned with noise
pollution that mining vessels create, the overall lack of understanding
of the ocean food web, and the role the deep ocean plays in the overall
system.79 In 2018 for example, scientists studied the carbon
sequestration role that bacteria play in the deep ocean.80 The study
explained that these bacteria play an important role in the carbon cycle
and that in the North Atlantic, they were responsible for sequestering
between 15-45% of carbon.81 Another study found that benthic bacteria
consume inorganic carbon, but that there was not enough information to
understand the effects deep-sea mineral mining might have on these
bacteria and their ability to digest carbon if the ecosystem is
disrupted.82 In sum, the degree of potential environmental harm
associated with deep-sea mining may be limited to the distance a plume
travels, or might extend far greater depending on how the food web is
affected. Land-based mining efforts have environmental impacts of their
own, and those impacts have spilled over beyond the borders of mining
sites.83 The broad comparison between land-based and sea-based impacts
goes only to show that mining operations have created numerous,
unintended environmental consequences. Such prior experiences on land,
paired with indicators that reasonably could lead one to believe that
sea-based operations may have significant impacts, counsel a robust
system of international enforcement of mining regulations. 2. Federal
Common Law and Historical Adjudication of Environmental Cases The
judiciary is not fully equipped to effectively adjudicate claims or
properly enforce deep-sea mining regulations. First, case law shows that
when injuries result from large-scale environmental accidents or the
effects of rising sea levels brought on by global warming, courts in the
U.S. are without the ability to effectively redress a wrong in its
entirety.84 Given the unknown scope of potential environmental impacts,
it may be possible that future deep-sea mineral mining controversies
would be subject to similar limitations. In Native Village of Kivalina
v. ExxonMobil Corp., members of a federally recognized tribe of Inupiat
Native Alaskans brought a suit against ExxonMobil and other defendants
alleging that massive greenhouse gas emissions emitted by the Energy
Producers have resulted in global warming, which, in turn, has severely
eroded the land where the City of Kivalina sits and threatens it with
imminent destruction.85 One of the issues in the case was the existence
of federal common law and whether it was competent to provide a remedy
in this situation.86 The Ninth Circuit held that federal common law
governed environmental public nuisance claims.87 The court also noted
that such a claim would require proof that the defendant unreasonably
interfered with the enjoyment of a public right and, thus, caused the
harm.88 The court conceded that the federal common law is subject to the
paramount authority of Congress because federal common law is used to
fill gaps in legislation.89 Ultimately, the court found that Kivalina
and its residents were without remedy because the Clean Air Act and
previous case law displaced their federal common law public nuisance
claim for damages.90 As a final word, the court explained that their
conclusion obviously does not aid Kivalina, which itself is being
displaced by the rising sea . . . \[b\]ut the solution to Kivalinas dire
circumstances must rest in the hands of the legislative and executive
branches of our government, not the federal common law.91 If future
deep-sea mineral mining complaints are brought by communities who
sustain injuries caused by the industry generally, it may be possible
that courts applying the federal common law would similarly defer to
congressionally supplied remedies instead of creating a federal common
law remedy.92 The Courts deference to Congressional action does not
leave plaintiffs entirely without hope for redressability, however.93 In
a way, the court implicitly states that it would be willing to issue
judgments when Congress or the President is the source of that
authority. Another case highlights how the injury requirement may raise
barriers to recovery. In Alaska Native Class v. Exxon Corp., one of the
many cases arising out of the Exxon Valdez disaster, the plaintiffs
brought a suit under general maritime law for non-economic damages.94
The complaint alleged that the spill harmed an integrated system of
communal subsistence . . . inextricably bound up not only with the
harvesting of natural resources damaged by the spill but also with the
exchange, sharing and processing of those resources as the foundation of
an established economic, social, and religious structure.95 The court
held that a party could not recover damages for a public nuisance claim
unless they are able to show a special injury different in kind from
that suffered by the general public.96 The court further held that even
though the class may have suffered such an injury more severely than
other members of the public, there would be no recovery because the
injuries alleged in the complaint were shared by all Alaskans.97 In a
worst-case scenario, the proliferation of commercial mining projects may
have a significant, negative effect on ocean ecosystems similar in
scope, or potentially larger, than oil-related environmental disasters.
If this were to be the case, a community adversely affected by such
industry collective action may face difficulties recovering under
federal common law in the absence of specific federal legislation
creating a cause of action. The special injury requirement under federal
common law, thus, does not bode well for future hypothetical plaintiffs
injured by mining practices. The threat of litigation can serve as an
effective deterrent against unwanted behavior, but the lack of domestic
redressability leaves a gap. This gap may be filled by domestic
legislation, but such action would only affect proceedings in U.S.
courts and, most importantly, it would be retrospective. Changes to the
U.S. regulatory regime will be necessary to ensure ex-post remedies are
effectively available where they ought to be, but enforcement mechanisms
at the international level will ensure litigation at the national level
is not the only deterrent. 3. Admiralty Law and Its Applicability to
Deep-Sea Mineral Mining Admiralty cases are exclusively the providence
of federal courts in the United States.98 It is generally the case that
an admiralty tort claim must (1) involve a vessel; (2) satisfy the
location test, where the injury occurs on navigable waters; and (3)
satisfy the connection test, where the activity either has the potential
to disrupt maritime commerce or that it shows a substantial relationship
to traditional maritime activity.99 First, the term vessel in Admiralty
tort cases is broadly construed and has included both off-shore oil
drilling rigs100 and dredging barges.101 Second, the location test does
not require that both the tort and the injury be relegated to navigable
waters. The Admiralty Extension Act prescribes admiralty jurisdiction in
cases where damage is caused by a vessel on navigable waters even though
the damage is consummated on land.102 Third, the connection test
involves an intermediate level of generality where the court assesses
the general features of the type of incident to determine if that sort
of incident has a potentially disruptive impact on maritime commerce.103
The courts reasoning in the Deepwater Horizon case is particularly
instructive when considering whether deep-sea mineral mining ships are
likely to be classified as vessels. There, the court found that the
drilling platform was a vessel, because it was practically capable of
transportation, it was only connected to the ocean floor by a well head,
and there were no other legs or attachments.104 There is no requirement
that the platform be in motion to be considered a vessel.105 Because
deep-sea mining is conducted by a ship that is not permanently moored to
the ocean floor, but rather controls a piece of equipment that operates
on the ocean floor, it will likely be considered a vessel for the
purposes of admiralty jurisdiction. The location and connection tests
would likely also be satisfied for the purposes of admiralty
jurisdiction.106 Thus, it is likely that two of the most foreseeable
future controversies would fall under admiralty jurisdiction. If a
future case involves an injury resulting from plume creation or nearly
any other activity attributable to a mining vessel on the high seas, the
case would fall within admiralty jurisdiction. If mining activities
create more attenuated injury, like destruction of ocean ecosystems and
the oceans ability to perform carbon capture, plaintiffs bringing such a
claim may find their cases removed to admiralty court. One example of
litigation surrounding environmental disasters at sea was the Deepwater
Horizon oil spill.107 After the disaster, numerous claimants brought a
suit seeking damages for injuries sustained as a result of the
incident.108 These claimants sought recovery under general maritime law,
the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (OPA), . . . and various state laws.109
The court found that the case fell under admiralty jurisdiction because
the drilling platform was considered a vessel.110 Relying on federal
maritime law, the court dismissed the state law claims holding that
state law must yield to the needs of a uniform maritime law.111 The
court explained that to subject a discharger to the varying laws of each
state into which its oil has flowed would contravene a fundamental
purpose of maritime law: \[t\]o preserve adequate harmony and
appropriate uniform rules relating to maritime matters.112 Although
states do have the ability to create remedies for oil spills that occur
within their territorial waters, they do not have the ability to create
remedies for incidents that occur on the high seas.113 A future deep-sea
mineral mining claim would likely be subject to similar reasoning, which
would result in uniform application of admiralty law and dismissal of
any state law claim. Thus, in some cases, the normal tort analysis, and
the injury requirement, do not properly account for the magnitude of
modern-day environmental harms that may affect large groups of
plaintiffs. As in Deepwater Horizon, courts seek to promote commerce,
and as a byproduct, will limit liability unless a federal law is in
place to expand liability beyond the value of the vessel. The history of
American case law, accordingly, supports the contention that future
environmental harms sustained by a large class of plaintiffs may not
result in full redress of the injury received. Federal courts have
explained, however, that the application of maritime law in admiralty
cases would be subordinate to Congressional action.114 The cases
mentioned above also show that state law will likely not be able to
provide remedies for injuries committed by deep-sea mining vessels and
their owners. In short, the American judiciary has signaled that (1)
Congress is the appropriate institution for drafting regulations to
govern liability in admiralty, and (2) it would honor and enforce those
regulations as the sole source of authority where admiralty jurisdiction
lies. 4. Limitation of Liability in Admiralty Law Once a case is
determined to be in admiralty jurisdiction, liability is typically
limited to the value of a vessel.115 The current version of the law
reads: The liability of the owner of a vessel for any claim, debt, or
liability . . . shall not . . . exceed the value of the vessel and
pending freight.116 The Supreme Court noted that the purpose of the Act
was to encourage investments in ships and their employment in
commerce\[,\] so that the shipping interests of this country might not
suffer in competition with foreign vessels.117 In the case of
large-scale environmental disasters where such impacts create thousands
of plaintiffs, as in the Exxon Valdez spill of 1989 or Deepwater Horizon
spill in 2010, this framework of liability would have limited the
defendant's liability to the value of the drilling equipment or
transportation equipment involved in the incident. Congress made an
exception to this liability ceiling by passing the OPA,118 which set
higher liability limits for defendants responsible for damages caused by
oil spills: \[T\]he total of the liability of a responsible party under
section 2702 of this title and any such removal costs incurred by, or on
behalf of, the responsible party . . . shall not exceed . . . \$3,000
per gross ton, . . . for an offshore facility except a deepwater port,
the total of all removal costs plus \$75,000,000, . . . \[and\] for any
onshore facility and deepwater port, \$350,000,000.119 The most
important feature of the OPA was that it set forth a higher level of
liability for oil spills as opposed to other maritime injuries. Today,
no such higher level of liability exists for deep-sea mineral mining.120
In fact, the only deep-sea mining related liability statute creates
civil penalties or criminal fines for conducting mining operations in
violation of U.S. law.121 In other words, Congress would have to pass
new legislation creating increased liability for deep sea mineral mining
companies who have the potential to create environmental effects similar
in scope to oil spills. Without such a measure, deep-sea mineral mining
companies may be able to seek protection under the Limitation of
Liability Act, which would limit their liability to the value of their
mining vessel and equipment.122 This raises concerns about
redressability as we have seen in the cases mentioned above. The lack of
such legislation would also leave absent an incentive for deep-sea
mineral mining companies to make their best effort to mitigate
environmental harms. Congress's normal fact-finding activities would
likely be frustrated by the current underdeveloped understanding of
deep-sea mining impacts. In short, without a more accurate understanding
of mining impacts, Congress may be unable to appropriately express
liability in terms of a number figure as it did with the OPA. Such
liability increases may be necessary in the future, even if they are
difficult to determine at the moment.

5\. Conclusions with Regard to the American Judiciary

In all, Congress and the President, [through administrative
agencies]{.underline} like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), [have the ability to adjust the course of future
deep-sea mineral mining litigation]{.underline} in a manner that would
positively affect a plaintiffs ability to recover damages commensurable
to the injury received. Such a structure may include increases to
liability limits in admiralty cases similarly to the OPA. It may also
include enacting new legislation to create a cause of action for more
attenuated injuries so that courts would not have to defer to federal
common law.

These changes do not wholly address all of the challenges associated
with deep-sea mineral mining regulation, but they would fill an
important domestic gap in how the judiciary would meet the challenge. A
positive byproduct could be that sufficient liability limits may deter
mining companies from committing bad acts and that plaintiffs could more
readily rely on a court's ability to grant a sufficient remedy.

[[Despite]{.mark} the [potential for]{.mark} positive [unilateral
reform]{.mark}, [it is not possible for all cases]{.mark} and
controversies occurring around the world to be effectively brought into
a United States court.]{.underline} The federal courts' jurisdiction is
not unlimited. [Even if liability limits under admiralty jurisdiction
are increased, [it may not be possible for a plaintiff to draw an
international defendant into a U.S. court]{.mark}.]{.underline} If that
defendant is an individual or citizen of a different country with no
place of business or meaningful tie to the U.S., the defendant may
choose not to defend the case, leaving the plaintiff with a judgment and
no mechanism to collect damages.123

At the Arctic Forum in Murmansk last week, [Dmitriev announced that
[Russia]{.mark} would [set up]{.mark} a [special investment]{.mark}

"a number of Western countries." Dmitriev also said the [[U]{.mark}nited

Russian Arctic region, including [in **LNG

[key revenue]{.mark} [makers]{.mark}]{.underline}, which have been

3\) What Are the Potential Benefits of Deep-Sea Mining?

Proponents of [[deep-sea mining]{.underline}]{.mark} argue that it [can
help [meet]{.mark} the world\'s **pressing [need for critical
minerals]{.mark}**, which will]{.underline} likely only [**[continue to
grow]{.mark}** as [countries invest]{.mark} more [in decarbonization,
digitization, defense]{.mark} [and infrastructure]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Estimates suggest that [global demand for nickel, cobalt and rare earth
elements may **double** by 2040 in a net-zero emissions
scenario]{.underline}. Several studies have concluded that there is no
shortage of mineral resources on land, but [the [world]{.mark} still
[faces **significant hurdles** in locating viable reserves]{.mark} and
quickly [scaling]{.mark} up [mining and processing
operations]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Some also view [[deep-sea mining]{.underline}]{.mark} as an alternative
pathway that can **[[circumvent]{.underline}]{.mark}** certain
[[risks]{.mark} associated [with mining]{.mark} [on
land]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since extraction would occur exclusively at
sea, [deep-sea mining is [**unlikely** to be associated with]{.mark}
**environmental hazards** such as [**deforestation** and **freshwater
pollution**]{.mark}]{.underline} that can impact communities neighboring
terrestrial mines. Yet others argue that infrastructure built to process
and transport deep-sea minerals would require land acquisition and
development, which may impact local communities\' property, food sources
and lifestyle.

Similarly, the [[difficulty in accessing]{.mark} deep-[sea]{.mark}
mineral [deposits]{.mark} for exploitation [means]{.mark} that
[artisanal]{.mark}]{.underline} (small-scale) [[mining operations would
be impossible]{.underline}]{.mark}, and strong regulation of labor
conditions may be feasible. This could potentially avoid the human
rights abuses associated with some terrestrial mining operations.
However, experiences of labor abuse in distant-water fishing operations
show this outcome is not guaranteed.

### S \-\-- Geoengineering/Permafrost

#### Participatory decision making through the Arctic Council is key to successful geoengineering

Burgess Power **Langshaw &** Samuel **Geisterfer**, 20**24**,
Cadieux-Léger Fellow at Global Affairs Canada and Affiliate Researcher
at the UN World Climate Research Program, providing briefings and
presentations on solar geoengineering, with special focus on climate
security and Arctic issues, 11/18/24, "The Arctic Council: a path
forward for geoengineering engagement and governance", Arctic Yearbook,
https://arcticyearbook.com/arctic-yearbook/2024/commentaries/539-the-arctic-council-a-path-forward-for-geoengineering-engagement-and-governance

While it is true that various geoengineering technologies do hold
potential risks, current research has not established the likelihood or
extent of such risks. Research is required to ascertain to what extent
these concerns are justified, and whether the probability can be
reduced, or the consequences mitigated. Conversely, [[failure to
research geoengineering]{.mark} is all but certain to **[lock]{.mark} us
[in]{.mark}**to [a future where]{.mark} the [environmental]{.mark} and
ecological [integrity of the Arctic is destroyed]{.mark} -- likely
irrevocably]{.underline}.

[Prior to engaging in]{.underline} such [research, we must determine who
should be responsible for it. [Most]{.mark} [geoengineering]{.mark}
technology's [research]{.mark} has been conducted [by academics
**disengaged from**]{.mark} **the realities of [Arctic living]{.mark}**.
[Decision-making]{.mark} for geoengineering research [should not
lie]{.mark} solely [in]{.mark} the hands of
[technocrats]{.mark}]{.underline}. Who else should be considered? Some
public advocacy groups have proposed moratoria and bans on
geoengineering research (including one supported by academics). While
these movements are well intentioned, they do not account for the
practicalities facing the world of geoengineering: [[Many]{.mark}
proposed [technologies for geoengineering are]{.mark} relatively
[simple]{.mark} and inexpensive, so it is [possible for]{.mark} private
[actors]{.mark} or nefarious agents [to engage in]{.mark} geoengineering
[research (and]{.mark} possibly [deployment]{.mark}) programs
[without]{.mark} public oversight or [transparency]{.mark}. Given this
reality, [a ban would]{.mark} only succeed in driving research into
covert, private and military spaces, [reduc]{.mark}ing accountability
and the ability for [**democratic oversight** of]{.mark} the
[research]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[The path forward]{.mark} in geoengineering [must be]{.mark} an open
and [transparent]{.mark} one. [Governments must begin]{.mark} immediate
[public]{.mark} engagement and [consultation programs to ensure]{.mark}
that [concerns]{.mark} around these technologies
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} appropriately studied and
[[addressed]{.underline}]{.mark}. With a properly funded research
program, the precise nature of the risks and consequences of these
technologies can be determined; and then, if the risks indeed outweigh
the benefits, appropriate governance mechanisms can be implemented.

The critical consideration here is where, who, and how to engage in
consultation. In the Canadian Arctic context, the word consultation
invokes constitutional overtones. Canadian Inuit groups are owed a
constitutional duty to consult for impacts to their rights. The impacts
to those rights resulting from geoengineering technologies will, of
course, be project specific. However, the existence of this recognized
legal duty should encourage governments to involve Indigenous groups at
the earliest stage possible. There remains a question regarding which
Indigenous groups should be consulted for broader governance decisions
and how their voices fit into broader decision-making structures for
geoengineering research.

[[International norms]{.underline}]{.mark} also work to
[[support]{.mark} the **[inclusion of Indigenous voices]{.mark}** while
[determining]{.mark} the future of [geoengineering
research]{.mark}]{.underline}. The United Nations Declaration on the
Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) provides guidance on ensuring that
states properly account for the voices of Indigenous groups. While there
is ongoing debate regarding the precise legal effects that flow from
UNDRIP, it provides a framework for government decisions that have
profound impacts on the territories of Indigenous groups.

[The issue of [consultation]{.mark} regarding geoengineering technology
is [complicated by]{.mark} the fact that [climate change]{.mark} [is a
trans-boundary issue]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Nation-states]{.underline}
have historically been held responsible for legal consultation
requirements, but they [may not be the best positioned to address the
impacts of climate change in the Arctic.]{.underline} [[Geoengineering
technologies]{.mark}]{.underline} and their impacts, like climate
change, [do [not]{.mark} begin or end [at]{.mark} the [jurisdiction of
nation]{.mark}-state[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. This fact suggests that
[**[a new model of consultation]{.mark} may be [required]{.mark}** for
consultation [on geoengineering technologies]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[The Arctic Council is **uniquely positioned** to test]{.mark} out [a
new model of consultation in]{.mark} the [geoengineering]{.mark}
context]{.underline}. It [[represents eight]{.mark} nation-[states
and]{.mark} [includes six Indigenous Peoples organizations]{.mark} as
Permanent Participants]{.underline} (including the Saami Council). While
the SCoPEx project stands as a prime example of how not to proceed, the
dire circumstances in the Arctic suggest that [[now is the time]{.mark}
to act. The [Arctic Council]{.mark} has [an opportunity]{.mark} to
consult [on geoengineering technologies in a]{.mark} new and [meaningful
way]{.mark}, emphasizing those whose lives and livelihoods are most
directly at stake in the fight against climate change]{.underline}.

It is entirely plausible that the outcome will be to reject
geoengineering technologies on account of their ethical implications, or
that it is simply too dangerous. However, it should not be up to biased
technocrats, nor governments lacking sufficient data. Therefore,
[engagement with the people at most risk -- both of climate change and
the effects of geoengineering -- must be considered first and foremost,
and [a strong path forward through]{.mark} a combined institution such
as [The Arctic Council]{.mark} presents [an excellent
opportunity]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Success]{.mark}]{.underline} in this
venue [[could]{.mark} then be a [model for]{.mark}]{.underline} future
such deliberation, for [[geoengineering]{.mark} [or other emerging
tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}, [and for]{.underline} not just
Indigenous peoples, but for [participatory decision making at the global
scale]{.underline}.

7\. Policy Responses and Mitigation Efforts

7.1. International Initiatives for Arctic Climate Protection

The susceptibility of the Arctic to climate change has led to several
international efforts aimed at encouraging international cooperation,
although the efficacy of these efforts varies \[242\]. The Arctic
Council, formed in 1996, is the premier intergovernmental platform for
Arctic governments and Indigenous communities \[243,244\]. It has played
an important role in producing critical reports, such as the Arctic
Climate Impact Assessment (ACIA), which highlights the multifaceted
effects of warming on the region \[245\]. The Council supports research
and sustainable resource use through initiatives, such as the Agreement
on Enhancing International Arctic Scientific Cooperation (2017) and the
Agreement to Prevent Unregulated Fishing in the Central Arctic Ocean
(2018) \[75\]. However, its inability to impose legally binding controls
on carbon emissions or industrial activity limits its overall
effectiveness. The Paris Agreement (2015), while global in scope,
indirectly addresses Arctic warming by aiming to keep the global
temperature rise to well below 2 ◦C \[246\]. Arctic-specific solutions,
such as enhanced financial support for adaptation in polar regions or
tighter timelines for emissions reductions in high-latitude countries,
are noticeably lacking \[247\]. Similarly, the Polar Code, produced by
the International Maritime Organisation, establishes rules for Arctic
shipping but calls for broader coverage to offset the hazards of
increased commercial activity, such as stronger limits on black carbon
emissions and ballast water discharge \[248\]. [The [lack of
comprehensive agreements]{.mark} explicitly designed to address Arctic
concerns, such as regulating oil and gas development or [overseeing
geoengineering experiments]{.mark}, [emphasises]{.mark} the [need for
more international action]{.mark}.]{.underline} Proposals for a binding
Arctic Climate Treaty, similar to the Antarctic Treaty System, remain
contentious due to competing interests among Arctic states and industry
\[249\].

7.2. Regional Policies and Indigenous Involvement and Leadership

National policies in Arctic nations vary significantly, reflecting
different priorities in balancing economic development and environmental
conservation \[250\]. Canada's Arctic and Northern Policy Framework
prioritises sustainable development, renewable energy transitions, and
climate resilience, while also incorporating Indigenous knowledge into
government policies to some extent \[251\]. In contrast, Russia's Arctic
strategy focusses on resource extraction, particularly oil, gas, and
minerals, and prioritises economic gains over environmental preservation
\[252\]. The Nordic countries have adopted ambitious green policies,
such as transitioning to renewable energy and promoting marine protected
areas, but there are still challenges in reducing emissions from the
expanding maritime and tourism industries \[253\]. Indigenous
communities, important to the Arctic's social and biological systems,
are becoming more active in policymaking \[50\]. Co-management
initiatives demonstrate the importance of combining traditional
ecological knowledge and scientific research to develop culturally
sensitive adaptation strategies \[254\]. Indigenous knowledge has proven
especially useful in monitoring climate impacts, such as changes in
species migration and permafrost degradation \[255\]. However, the
United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP)
emphasises the importance of increased political and financial
empowerment in order to promote fair participation in 34 decision making
\[256\]. Indigenous organisations advocate for greater influence in
shaping regional and national policies, particularly those governing
land use, resource extraction, and conservation \[40,257,258\].

7.3. Mitigation Strategies to Reduce Arctic Warming

Mitigating Arctic warming demands an integrated approach combining
traditional emission reduction strategies with novel technologies and
regional conservation activities \[259\]. Emission reduction remains
crucial, with Arctic nations working to decarbonise their economy
through renewable energy transitions, carbon pricing mechanisms, and
commitments to net-zero targets \[260\]. Policies to reduce black carbon
emissions, a major contributor to Arctic warming, are critical \[261\].
Regional initiatives, such as the Arctic Council Framework for Action on
Enhanced Black Carbon and Methane Emissions Reductions, seek to restrict
these pollutants, but enforcement is uneven \[262\]. [[Geoengineering
solutions]{.mark}, such as solar radiation management and Arctic ice
restoration, are under investigation as prospective interventions, for
example, using reflective aerosols to increase the Earth's albedo or
artificially recovering sea ice could help to decrease regional warming
\[263,264\]. However, these methods [pose ethical, environmental, and
geopolitical risks, demanding stringent international
control]{.mark}.]{.underline} Protected areas, such as the United
States' Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, are important for biodiversity
conservation and carbon sequestration \[265\]. Expanding these zones,
particularly in maritime habitats, may lessen anthropogenic disruptions
while providing refuge for vulnerable species. Cleaner shipping
technologies and tougher rules on resource extraction activities help to
achieve localised mitigation.

7.4. Arctic Governance and Adaptation Strategies

[[Climate change is causing significant]{.mark} environmental and
socioeconomic [changes in the Arctic]{.mark}, [necessitating]{.mark} the
implementation of strong [governance frameworks and adaptation
strategies]{.mark}]{.underline}. The combination of global climate
dynamics, Indigenous knowledge systems, and geopolitical interests has
made the Arctic a focus for scientific research and policy intervention.
The Arctic Council serves as a major forum for collaboration among
Arctic nations and Indigenous organisations \[266\]. It has played an
important role in addressing concerns, such as environmental
preservation and sustainable development, but its non-binding agreements
impede enforcement \[32\]. Despite these efforts, gaps exist in the
management of challenges, such as increased shipping, resource
extraction, and environmental deterioration. For example, the rapid
melting of sea ice has increased geopolitical competition for shipping
routes and mineral resources, emphasising the need for stronger legal
frameworks \[36,50,267\]. International agreements, such as the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, provide legal processes for
settling disputes, particularly those involving marine boundaries
\[268\]. However, there are concerns that these frameworks are
insufficient to handle the Arctic's rapid environmental changes \[212\].
The Arctic Fisheries Agreement of 2018, which outlaws unregulated
fishing in the central Arctic Ocean, is a recent example of effective
international cooperation \[269\].

Indigenous Peoples, who have lived sustainably in the Arctic for
centuries, play crucial roles in governance. However, their sovereignty
and rights are frequently overlooked in decision-making processes
\[270\]. Studies emphasise the necessity of incorporating Indigenous
knowledge into governance frameworks to achieve culturally suitable and
sustainable adaptation policies \[31,32,42\]. Collaborative governance
approaches that emphasise resource co-management have showed potential,
notably in mitigating the effects of climate change on traditional
livelihoods \[51,271,272\]. Fragmented policies and disparities in
capacities among Arctic governments present considerable governance
issues. Regional disparities in economic development, environmental
interests, and legal frameworks im-pede coordinated responses to climate
change \[42\]. Resource extraction activities, which are often motivated
by national interests, clash with conservation objectives, complicating
governance efforts \[14\].

Indigenous People are among the most susceptible to climate change, with
traditional subsistence activities disrupted by changes in wildlife
migration, sea ice loss, and permafrost thaw \[22,32\]. Adaptation
measures that incorporate Indigenous knowledge, like communitybased
monitoring systems, have been beneficial in increasing resilience
\[51,273\]. For example, collaborating on research with Indigenous
stakeholders has resulted in a better knowledge and management of
ecological changes \[30--32,274\]. Thawing permafrost and coastal
erosion pose significant dangers to Arctic infrastructure, such as
buildings, pipelines, and transportation networks \[19,275\].
Engineering solutions, such as permafrost-resistant materials and
coastal defence systems, are being deployed, but their high cost and the
distant locations of Arctic communities prevent widespread adoption
\[276--278\]. Policies that prioritise climate-resilient infrastructure
are important for mitigating these risks \[152,279,280\].

Ecosystem-based adaptation strategies prioritise biodiversity
conservation and habitat restoration in order to preserve ecosystem
services that benefit communities \[281\]. Arctic wetlands, for example,
play an important role in carbon sequestration and water control; hence,
their preservation is a priority \[22\]. Protecting vital habitats for
migratory species has become an important adaptation strategy \[23\].
Integrating climate adaptation into national and regional strategies is
critical for good governance. Participatory scenario planning, which
combines multiple stakeholder viewpoints, including those of Indigenous
communities, has proven effective in developing adaptive management
strategies \[282\]. However, research shows that it frequently fails to
fully integrate with Indigenous practices, emphasising the need for more
inclusive approaches \[282\]. Cooperative agreements, such as the Arctic
Fisheries Agreement, illustrate the possibility for multilateral
governance, but gaps exist in addressing the security implications of
rising human activity in the region \[36,50\]. Strengthening
international agreements on Arctic shipping, fishing, and resource
management is important for balancing economic development and
environmental sustainability.

Continuous monitoring with advanced technologies, such as
satellite-based remote sensing, drones, and IoT-enabled sensors, is
required for real-time data collection and processing \[283\].
**[[International collaboration]{.mark}, [such as the Arctic
Council]{.mark}, [must be strengthened to enable coordinated research
and]{.mark} policy [implementation]{.mark}]{.underline}** \[250\].
Enhanced funding channels and collaborations are required to support
Arctic-focused research activities \[284\]. Raising worldwide awareness
of Arctic changes and their repercussions can also help to mobilise
support for these efforts.

8\. Key Research Gaps

The Arctic has several research gaps that limit effective climate action
and equitable policy development, particularly for Indigenous Peoples
and the ecosystem. An important gap is the poor inclusion of Indigenous
knowledge systems into larger scientific frameworks. Indigenous
communities have built up extensive, place-based knowledge about Arctic
ecosystems over generations, which is underutilised in scientific and
policy discussions \[285\]. The lack of this knowledge reduces the
cultural significance and efficacy of adaptation strategies,
particularly those aimed at traditional livelihoods, like hunting,
fishing, and reindeer herding. The detailed overview of the key research
gaps identified in this study is given in Supplementary Table S1.
Studies that combine Indigenous knowledge with science are critical for
developing inclusive policies that empower communities and strengthen
their resilience. Beyond Indigenous specific gaps, larger ecological and
socioeconomic uncertainties persist. There is a lack of understanding
about Arctic marine ecosystems, specifically the combined effects of
ocean acidification, changing sea ice dynamics, and altered food webs.
Polar bears, walruses, and Arctic cod are among the species at risk due
to these conditions, which threaten both ecological equilibrium and
Indigenous sustenance. Economic gaps include a lack of comprehensive
appraisals of growing industries, such as Arctic shipping and resource
extraction. The effects of infrastructure expansion on vulnerable
permafrost and ecosystems are poorly understood, leaving important
concerns unanswered. These research gaps and future goals highlight the
need for a comprehensive and collaborative approach to Arctic climate
research, which ensures that scientific understanding keeps up with the
rapid changes taking place in this crucial area. Addressing these gaps
necessitates interdisciplinary research, more collaboration between
Arctic and non-Arctic nations, and a focus on participatory techniques
that incorporate Indigenous perspectives at all stages of development.
By addressing these research gaps, the Arctic can serve as a paradigm
for integrated, sustainable, and inclusive climate response.

Despite growing interest in Arctic climate change, several key research
gaps remain. These include limited high-resolution data across space and
seasons, insufficient integration of interacting climate drivers (e.g.,
greenhouse gases, albedo, and atmospheric dynamics), and unclear
linkages between Arctic warming and mid-latitude weather extremes.
Moreover, local-scale impacts on ecosystems and Indigenous communities
are underexplored, and observational data---especially in remote and
winter-dominated regions---remain sparse. This study contributes by
synthesising multiple drivers and highlighting the Arctic's role as a
critical zone of interconnected global change.

9\. Recommendations for Addressing Climate Change in the Arctic

The Arctic is warming at an unprecedented rate, affecting global climate
systems, ecosystems, and local communities. These recommendations
provide a comprehensive strategy for addressing climate change in the
Arctic, incorporating risk assessment, monitoring, mitigation, community
participation, and policy formulation to promote resilience and
sustainability. Effective risk assessment is essential to tackle Arctic
climate challenges. Geospatial analysis can reveal hotspots for
permafrost degradation, glacier retreat, and carbon release, as well as
vulnerabilities in Arctic biodiversity and infrastructure. Creating
multi-hazard vulnerability maps that integrate risks, such as ice melt,
coastal erosion, and storm surges, allows initiatives to be prioritised
more effectively. By including socioeconomic scenarios in climate
models, policymakers can assess risks to livelihoods, food security, and
cultural traditions, allowing them to address both local and global
implications. Robust monitoring and early warning systems are required
to track climate dynamics in real time. Advanced remote sensing
technology, such as AI-enhanced satellites and autonomous underwater
drones, can provide useful information about ice dynamics, permafrost
thaw, and ecosystem changes. Localised field investigations that combine
scientific methods with Indigenous knowledge are important for
understanding changes in animal migration patterns, ecosystem health,
and social aspects. Early warning systems, powered by AI and integrated
into global networks, can predict extreme weather and ice collapse
events, improving preparedness for downstream impacts, like sea-level
rise.

Large-scale renewable energy projects, such as offshore wind farms and
hydrogen energy hubs, can replace fossil fuels, while localised solar
power systems lessen the need for diesel generators in remote locations.
Restoring Arctic wetlands and peatlands is a natural carbon
sequestration approach, and novel technologies, such as carbon capture
and biochar synthesis, can further reduce emissions.
[[Geoengineering]{.mark} options, [such as maritime cloud
brightening]{.mark} and artificial ice floe creation, [must be
investigated carefully]{.mark}, [with international frameworks]{.mark}
insuring ethical and effective implementation]{.underline}. Marine
ecosystem preservation, including protected areas and sustainable
fisheries management, is important for biodiversity and carbon balance.
Community engagement is critical to Arctic climate action.
Capacity-sharing is important to promote sustainable practices and
prepare future leaders for climate science and resilience approaches.
Arctic climate councils, which comprise Indigenous leaders, scientists,
and policymakers, facilitate collaborative decision making and support
inclusive governance. Integrating Indigenous ecological knowledge into
climate policies is important to strengthen research and adaptation
while encouraging shared ownership of climate solutions. The
recommendations for addressing climate change impacts in the Arctic are
illustrated in Figure 7, while a detailed overview of each component of
recommendations is given in Supplementary Table S1.

[[Policy frameworks must be strengthened]{.mark} in order for Arctic
climate governance to function effectively.]{.underline} A legally
binding Arctic Climate Treaty could impose limitations on emissions and
resource extraction, while strengthening the Polar Code will ensure more
stringent management of shipping emissions and pollution.
Arctic-specific climate funds can help fund renewable energy,
conservation, and community resilience initiatives, but methods for
compensating Indigenous communities for climate-related losses must be
established. Regional and global
**[[collaborations]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[such as those [organised
by the Arctic Council]{.mark}, [can]{.mark} help to [coordinate action
and knowledge sharing]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Technological advancements
provide chances to strengthen Arctic resilience. Climate-resilient
infrastructure, such as floating structures and adaptable pipelines, can
resist severe weather and permafrost melt. Decentralised renewable
energy systems and innovative battery storage technologies can provide
stable electricity in remote Arctic locations, while IoT-based
monitoring systems track vulnerabilities in real time, allowing for
quick responses to emerging problems. Restoring Arctic habitats is
important for minimising climate impacts. Wildlife corridors can help
species migrate, and rewilding degraded landscapes with native
vegetation increases biodiversity and carbon sequestration. Developing
resilient agricultural practices, such as cold-resistant crops and
agroforestry, can promote food security while decreasing reliance on
imported foods.

#### The Arctic Council and its agreements are needed for geoengineering

Atmospheric Methane Removal,
https://scholarship.law.columbia.edu/sabin_climate_change/233//phs-maubu)

This section discusses key principles of customary international law and
[[international agreements]{.mark} potentially [relevant to atmospheric
methane]{.mark} [removal]{.mark} activities]{.underline}. At the outset,
it is important to note that international agreements impose obligations
only on countries that consent to be bound by them. Customary
international law, on the other hand, is derived from established
international practices that are accepted as law and is binding on all
countries. (The only exception is when a country has "persistently
objected" to a particular rule and thus may not be required to comply
with it \[Green, 2016\].)

While international law is generally only binding on countries (as
distinct from noncountry actors), it may inform domestic regulation and
thus have implications for the testing and deployment of atmospheric
methane removal approaches by private individuals and companies. For
example, customary international law and several international
agreements establish baseline requirements for environmental impact
assessments (EIAs), which have influenced domestic environmental review
processes that atmospheric methane removal projects might be subject to.
[[International law]{.mark} [will be]{.mark} particularly [relevant to
open system atmospheric methane removal projects]{.mark} that result in,
or have the potential to result in, transboundary environmental harm
since that is a key focus of many international environmental agreements
and rules of customary international law.]{.underline}

This section identifies key international law requirements that will
apply to atmospheric methane removal activities and highlights important
differences in the treatment of different approaches (e.g., based on
whether they involve open versus closed systems or take place in
terrestrial versus ocean environments). [It also discusses the impact of
"[soft law" instruments]{.mark}, including nonbinding resolutions
[address]{.mark}ing [geoengineering activities that have been adopted
under]{.mark} the CBD and other [international
agreements]{.mark}.]{.underline} Finally, the potential for state
responsibility if international legal requirements are not met is also
explored.

3.1 Relevant Principles of Customary International Law Atmospheric
methane removal activities, especially those involving the use of open
system approaches, could implicate the "no harm" rule of customary
international law. According to the no harm rule, each country must
"ensure that activities within their jurisdiction or control do not
cause damage to the environment of other \[countries\] or of areas
beyond the limits of national jurisdiction."23 The International
Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) described the rule as imposing
an obligation of "due diligence" on countries to "exercise best possible
efforts" or "do the utmost" to avoid or minimize transboundary
environmental damage.24 Countries must, at a minimum, closely oversee
activities that could cause transboundary environmental damage (e.g., by
adopting and strictly enforcing relevant domestic laws).25 The
International Court of Justice has stated that due diligence "entails
not only the adoption of appropriate rules and measures, but also a
certain level of vigilance in their enforcement and the exercise of
administrative control applicable to public and private operators, such
as the monitoring of activities undertaken by such operators."26 Thus,
under the no harm rule, countries have a due diligence obligation to
ensure that domestic laws and other measures adequately protect against
any adverse transboundary environmental impacts from atmospheric methane
removal projects. Also under customary international law, countries must
conduct an EIA before undertaking or authorizing a project that poses a
risk of "significant" transboundary environmental damage.27 There is no
agreed upon definition of what constitutes "significant" damage.
However, the International Law Commission has interpreted the term as
requiring damage that is more than merely "detectable" but not
necessarily "serious" or "substantial" (International Law Commission,
2001, p. 152). Prior to authorizing a project that has the potential to
cause transboundary harm, countries must conduct a preliminary
assessment to determine whether there is a risk of significant damage.28
If this preliminary assessment shows that there is a risk of significant
damage, the country must undertake a more comprehensive EIA. Under
international law, the country must complete the EIA prior to the
commencement of the project but otherwise has broad discretion in
conducting the assessment.29 The United States and many other countries
have domestic laws governing the conduct of EIAs. (U.S. requirements are
discussed in more detail below.) When the EIA confirms that a project
could cause significant transboundary environmental harm, the relevant
country must notify and consult with other potentially affected
countries and relevant international organizations.30 3.2 Relevant
International Agreements 3.2.1 United Nations Framework Convention on
Climate Change and Paris Agreement The United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was adopted in May 1992 with the
goal of "stabili\[zing\] greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere
at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with
the climate system."31 The UNFCCC entered into force in March 1994 and
had been ratified or acceded to by 197 countries and the EU at the time
of writing (UN, n.d.-b). In December 2015, the parties to the UNFCCC
adopted the Paris Agreement, which aims to "enhance the implementation
of" the UNFCCC and thereby "strengthen the global response to the threat
of climate change."32 The Paris Agreement entered into force in November
2016 and had been ratified or acceded to by 195 of the 198 parties to
the UNFCCC at the time of writing (UN, n.d.-b). The United States was
the first industrialized country to ratify the UNFCCC in October 1992.
The United States adopted the Paris Agreement in September 2016. During
the Trump administration, the United States withdrew from the Paris
Agreement (with effect from November 4, 2020), but it later rejoined the
agreement under President Biden (with effect from February 19, 2021).
Both the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement call on parties to mitigate climate
change by limiting anthropogenic emissions and enhancing "removals by
sinks of greenhouse gases."33 The term "sink" is defined broadly to mean
"any process, activity or mechanism which removes a greenhouse gas, an
aerosol or a precursor of a greenhouse gas from the atmosphere."34 The
definition is not limited to naturally occurring removals but is broad
enough to include those resulting from human interventions (Honegger et
al., 2021, p. 328). Many scholars have concluded that the definition
captures a wide range of "nature-based" and "engineered" CDR approaches
(Brent et al., 2019; Craik & Burns, 2016; Honegger et al., 2021; Horton
et al., 2016). It could be argued that atmospheric methane removal
approaches also fall within the definition (assuming the approaches are
effective in removing methane from the atmosphere). There is, however,
an important difference between CDR and atmospheric methane removal
approaches that might impact their treatment under the UNFCCC and Paris
Agreement. Whereas CDR results in the storage of CO2 outside the
atmosphere (e.g., underground or in terrestrial or ocean ecosystems),
atmospheric methane removal involves the destruction of methane via
oxidation, which typically releases CO2 that may (or may not) later be
removed and stored. Even so, atmospheric methane removal might still be
considered "mitigation of climate change" under the UNFCCC and Paris
Agreement because it helps to limit near-term warming and thus furthers
the goal of avoiding "dangerous anthropogenic interference with the
climate system."35 The Paris Agreement sets a specific goal of limiting
future warming to "well below 2o C above pre-industrial levels and
pursuing efforts to limit \[warming\] to 1.5o C above pre-industrial
levels."36 Consistent with that goal, parties to the Paris Agreement aim
to achieve net-zero emissions by the second half of the century, meaning
that any residual emissions at that time must be offset through removal
of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.37 In subsequent decisions, the
parties have reiterated the urgency of both reducing emissions,
including specifically methane emissions, and enhancing removals from
the atmosphere. For example, in the 2023 UAE Declaration on Climate and
Health, the parties "recognize the need for deep, rapid, and sustained
reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in line with 1.5o C pathways"
and, in particular, call for "\[a\]ccelerating or substantially reducing
non-carbon-dioxide emissions, globally, including in particular methane
emissions by 2030."38 The UAE Declaration also calls for
"\[a\]ccelerating zero- and low-emission technologies, including . . .
removal technologies."39 Each party to the Paris Agreement determines
the precise actions it will take to mitigate climate change and details
those actions in a "nationally determined contribution" (NDC) that it
must submit to the UNFCCC Secretariat in accordance with specified
requirements.40 Parties must periodically update their NDCs to "reflect
\[the\] highest possible ambition."41 Several parties (including the
United States) have outlined, in their most recent NDCs, measures aimed
at reducing emissions of methane into the atmosphere. However, to the
authors' knowledge, none have proposed removing methane already in the
atmosphere. As understanding of atmospheric methane removal develops,
parties may look to incorporate atmospheric methane removal into future
NDCs. In this regard, it is notable that the United States and several
other parties' NDCs already incorporate CDR, with a particular emphasis
on nature-based approaches such as forestry and coastal blue carbon
(Gallo et al., 2017; Krug, 2018). Under the Paris Agreement, parties may
choose to "cooperate in the implementation of their \[NDCs\]," including
through market-based mechanisms. Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement
authorizes parties to enter into bilateral and multilateral agreements
to trade emissions reductions and removals (known as internationally
transferred mitigation outcomes). Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement
creates a separate, centralized trading mechanism that is governed by
the UNFCCC and open to both parties and nonparties (including private
sector actors). Many of the details regarding implementation of Articles
6.2 and 6.4 are still under discussion and not expected to be resolved
until 2024 or beyond.42 One particularly controversial issue relates to
the treatment of removal activities under the Article 6.4 mechanism. In
May 2023, the subsidiary body appointed by the parties to provide advice
on implementing Article 6.4 issued an "information note" on removals:
there are currently no removal methods for removal of non-CO2
\[greenhouse gases\] that have progressed beyond conceptual discussion .
. . Some stakeholder submissions \[received by the subsidiary body\]
suggest that \[greenhouse gases\] other than CO2 should not be included
in the definition of removals.43 The subsidiary body noted that common
definitions of "removal" (e.g., used by the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change) typically refer to activities that remove and durably
store CO2 from the atmosphere and noted that "if the definition were to
cover non-CO2 \[greenhouse gases\], the word 'storage' might not be
appropriate as in the case of \[atmospheric methane removal\], for
example, it may be more appropriate to burn ('destroy') the
\[methane\]".44 The subsidiary body received many stakeholder
submissions on this and related definitional issues. Several of the
submissions supported adopting a definition of "removals" that
encompasses activities targeting non-CO2 greenhouse gases. For example,
the UK government submitted that there is no "rationale for limiting the
type of \[greenhouse gas\] in the definition at this stage" and
expressed concern that doing so "may risk prematurely disincentivizing
the development of future \[greenhouse gas\] removal technologies."45 It
remains to be seen how this and other issues relating to the
implementation of Article 6.4 will be resolved. 3.2.2 Convention on
Biological Diversity The CBD aims to promote "the conservation of
biological diversity, \[and\] the sustainable use of its components."46
The CBD entered into force in December 1993 and had been ratified or
otherwise accepted by 195 countries and the EU at the time of writing
(UN Environment Programme, n.d.). The United States had signed but not
ratified the CBD at the time of writing (UN Environment Programme,
n.d.). Article 3 of the CBD recognizes that countries have "the
sovereign right to exploit their own resources pursuant to their own
environmental policies" but must "ensure that activities within their
jurisdiction or control do not cause damage to the environment of other
\[countries\] or of areas beyond the limits of national jurisdiction."47
Article 7 of the CBD requires parties to, "as far as possible and as
appropriate," identify projects "which have or are likely to have
significant adverse impacts on the conservation and sustainable use of
biological diversity and monitor their effects."48 Countries will need
to be mindful of this requirement when undertaking or authorizing
atmospheric methane removal activities as some (e.g., those involving
ecosystem uptake enhancement) could affect biodiversity and will thus
need to be assessed and closely monitored. Some atmospheric methane
removal techniques could also involve bioengineering---for example,
through engineering methane-oxidizing bacteria to better oxidize methane
in soil. The CBD obligates parties to "regulate, manage or control the
risks associated with the use and release of living modified organisms
resulting from biotechnology which are likely to have adverse
environmental impacts."49 In 2000, the CBD parties adopted the Cartagena
Protocol on Biosafety (Cartagena Protocol), which regulates the
transfer, handling, and use of modified organisms. The Cartagena
Protocol obligates parties to set out procedures, including advanced
informed agreement, in order to ensure safe transfer, handling, and use
of modified organisms (Keiper & Atanassova, 2020). At the time of
writing, the Cartagena Protocol was in force for 172 countries and the
EU, but the United States had not ratified it (UN Environment Programme,
2018). Other decisions adopted by the parties to the CBD could also have
implications for atmospheric methane removal activities. For example, in
2008, the parties adopted a decision dealing with ocean fertilization.
Some forms of AOE could result in ocean fertilization and thus implicate
the 2008 decision. The decision "requests parties and urges other
governments . . . to ensure that ocean fertilization activities do not
take place until there is an adequate scientific basis on which to
justify such activities."50 There is an exemption for "small scale
research studies within coastal waters," which may be "authorized if
justified by the need to gather specific scientific data . . . \[and\]
subject to a thorough prior assessment of the potential impacts of the
research studies on the marine environment."51 According to the 2008
decision, authorized research projects should "be strictly controlled"
and not undertaken for any "commercial purpose" (e.g., to sell carbon
credits or offsets).52 A second decision, dealing with "geoengineering
activities," was adopted by the CBD parties in 2010.53 The decision
"invites Parties and other Governments" to consider specified guidelines
"on ways to conserve, sustainably use and restore biodiversity and
ecosystem services while contributing to climate change mitigation and
adaptation."54 The guidelines recommend that countries do the following:
Ensure . . . that no climate-related geo-engineering activities that may
affect biodiversity take place, until there is an adequate scientific
basis on which to justify such activities and appropriate consideration
of the associated risks for the environment and biodiversity and
associated social, economic and cultural impacts, with the exception of
small scale scientific research studies that would be conducted in a
controlled setting\[,\] . . . are justified by the need to gather
specific scientific data and are subject to a thorough prior assessment
of the potential impacts on the environment.55 The CBD parties have
defined "geoengineering activities" to include any "\[d\]eliberate
intervention in the planetary environment of a nature and scale intended
to counteract anthropogenic climate change and its impacts."56 This
definition is likely to encompass atmospheric methane removal activities
undertaken for the purpose of combating climate change. Thus, according
to the 2010 decision, governments should only allow research into
atmospheric methane removal in a controlled setting after conducting a
comprehensive environmental assessment. In 2016, the parties to the CBD
adopted a decision that, among other things, reaffirmed prior
geoengineering decisions and called for more research. The decision
notes that "more transdisciplinary research and sharing of knowledge . .
. is needed in order to better understand the impacts of climate-related
geoengineering on biodiversity and ecosystem functions and services,
socio-economic, cultural and ethical issues and regulatory options."57
It should be noted that the decisions referenced above are not legally
binding and use fairly soft language (e.g., the 2010 decision "invites"
parties to do certain things). Even so, the decisions carry weight and
may impact countries' approaches to atmospheric methane removal
activities (Proelss & Steenkamp, 2022; Webb et al., 2023). 3.2.3 Ocean
Agreements The agreements in this subsection apply to activities
occurring in, or affecting, the marine environment . 3.2.3.1 United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea UNCLOS defines countries'
rights and responsibilities with respect to the management and use of
marine areas. UNCLOS was adopted in December 1982 and entered into force
in November 1994 (UN, 2023c). As mentioned above, the United States had
not ratified UNCLOS at the time of writing, but it recognizes many of
UNCLOS' provisions as forming part of customary international law and
thus abides by them (UN, 2023b; U.S. Department of State, n.d.-a).
Atmospheric methane removal projects that are conducted in, or could
impact, the marine environment would need to comply with Part XII of
UNCLOS, which imposes a general obligation on countries to "protect and
preserve the marine environment."58 This general obligation is
elaborated on in subsequent provisions of UNCLOS. For example, under
Article 194, countries are required to "protect and preserve rare or
fragile ecosystems as well as the habitat of depleted, threatened or
endangered species and other forms of marine life."59 Article 206 of
UNCLOS provides that before undertaking any activity that "may cause . .
. significant and harmful changes to the marine environment," countries
must "assess the potential effects" of the activity and publish the
findings of that assessment.60 Once the activity commences, countries
also have a duty to monitor the activity and its effects on the marine
environment.61 Countries also have an obligation, under Article 194 of
UNCLOS, to "take all measures consistent with th\[e\] Convention that
are necessary to prevent, reduce and control pollution of the marine
environment."62 UNCLOS defines "pollution of the marine environment"
broadly to mean the introduction of "substances or energy into the
marine environment . . . which results or is likely to result in such
deleterious effects as" harm to living resources, human health, and
marine activities.63 In May 2024, ITLOS issued an advisory opinion on
climate change and international law, in which the UNCLOS definition of
pollution was discussed extensively. ITLOS noted that the UNCLOS
definition "does not provide a list of pollutants or forms of pollution
of the marine environment. Instead, it sets out three criteria to
determine what constitutes such pollution: (1) there must be a substance
or energy; (2) this substance or energy must be introduced by humans,
directly or indirectly, into the marine environment; and (3) such
introduction must result or be likely to result in deleterious
effects."64 Applying these three criteria, ITLOS found that
anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere constitute
marine pollution within the terms of UNCLOS.65 Some atmospheric methane
removal approaches might similarly be found to involve pollution. For
example, if AOE were performed by releasing iron particles from vessels
or aircraft over the ocean, some of the particles would end up landing
on the surface of the water, where they could stimulate phytoplankton
blooms that lead to macronutrient diversion from other parts of the
ocean and thus harm fishing or other marine life. Legal scholars have
argued that certain CDR projects might also be sources of marine
pollution (Burns, 2023; Reynolds, 2016; Webb, 2023). Some have, however,
countered that CDR projects should be viewed as a form of pollution
control (i.e., because they are designed to remove CO2 from the upper
ocean and thus combat the effects of CO2 emissions, which ITLOS has
identified as a source of marine pollution) (Reynolds, 2018). ITLOS did
not address this in detail in the May 2024 advisory opinion, but it did
note that "Article 195 of \[UNCLOS\] requires States, in taking measures
to prevent, reduce and control pollution of the marine environment, not
to transfer . . . damage or hazards from one area to another or
transform one type of pollution into another."66 ITLOS then stated,
"Marine geoengineering would be contrary to article 195 if it has the
consequence of transforming one type of pollution into another."67 In
the future, countries may look to atmospheric methane removal as a means
of combating marine pollution from greenhouse gas emissions and thus
meet their UNCLOS obligations. However, as indicated by ITLOS, countries
would need to ensure that the activities they undertake do not cause
further pollution of the marine environment. Additional research is
needed on this and other issues relating to the application of UNCLOS to
atmospheric methane removal activities. 3.2.3.2 Conservation and
Sustainable Use of Marine Biological Diversity beyond National
Jurisdiction Treaty In June 2023, the parties to UNCLOS adopted, by
consensus, the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Marine Biological
Diversity beyond National Jurisdiction (BBNJ) treaty.68 That treaty
opened for signature on September 20, 2023, but had not yet entered into
force at the time of writing (UN, 2023a). The BBNJ treaty establishes a
framework for countries to use area-based management tools (ABMTs),
including marine protected areas, for conserving and restoring
biodiversity in the high seas or seabed beyond national jurisdiction.69
In the future, ABMTs could be used to direct atmospheric methane removal
activities away from certain high seas areas (e.g., with high
biodiversity) and/or otherwise control how they take place. The BBNJ
treaty also includes provisions requiring EIAs for certain activities
taking place on, or impacting, the high seas and/or the underlying
seabed, which could have implications for atmospheric methane removal
projects.70 Scholars have begun to explore how these provisions of the
BBNJ treaty might apply to other NETs (particularly ocean-based CDR
approaches), but, to date, there has been no detailed examination of
their application to atmospheric methane removal (see, e.g., Burns and
Webb, 2023). 3.2.3.3 London Convention and Protocol The Convention on
the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter
(London Convention) was adopted in November 1972 and entered into force
in August 1975. The London Convention aims to "promote the effective
control of all sources of pollution of the marine environment,"
particularly those resulting from the "dumping" of "waste or other
matter" at sea.71 In November 1996, the parties to the London Convention
adopted a new protocol, which sets more ambitious goals than the London
Convention, aiming to "protect and preserve the marine environment from
all sources of pollution" and to "prevent, reduce and where practicable
eliminate pollution caused by dumping" of "waste or other matter."72 At
the time of writing, there were 87 parties to the London Convention and
53 parties to the London Protocol (EPA, 2023a). For countries that are
parties to both instruments, the London Protocol supersedes the London
Convention. The United States has only ratified the London Convention
and is, therefore, bound only by its terms (EPA, 2023a). Both the London
Convention and Protocol require parties to adopt domestic laws to
regulate the dumping of waste and other matter within offshore areas
under their jurisdiction (i.e., the territorial sea and EEZ) and,
outside of those areas, by vessels or aircraft that are registered or
were loaded within their territory.73 In both instruments, "waste or
other matter" is defined to mean "material of any kind, form or
description."74 "Dumping" is defined to mean the "deliberate disposal of
waste or other matter at sea from vessels, aircraft, platforms, or other
man-made structures," but there is an exemption for the "placement of
matter for a purpose other than mere disposal thereof, provided that
such placement is not contrary to the aims of" the London Convention or
Protocol (the "dumping exemption").75 Notably, the London Convention and
Protocol include specific provisions governing dumping through
"incineration at sea," which is defined as the combustion of waste or
other matter for the purposes of thermal destruction.76 This could have
implications for AOE projects in which aircraft or vessels are used to
disperse materials over ocean areas. This is because the materials would
be released via the aircraft or vessel exhaust, as a result of the
combustion of specially formulated fuels, which could be viewed as
involving the thermal destruction of matter. However, the purpose of
combustion would not be thermal destruction of matter but rather the
production of reactive species to react with methane. Further legal
analysis may be needed to determine whether this distinction in intent
is relevant under the London Convention and Protocol. AOE might also
result in ocean fertilization, which the parties to the London
Convention and Protocol have taken steps to control through a series of
nonbinding resolutions. Since the resolutions are nonbinding, parties
are not legally required to comply with them. However, some argue that
the resolutions must be consulted in the context of interpreting the
provisions of the two agreements (Proelss, 2021). In 2008, the parties
to the London Convention and Protocol adopted a resolution defining when
ocean fertilization will constitute dumping.77 The 2008 resolution
defined "ocean fertilization" to mean "any activity undertaken by humans
with the principal intention of stimulating primary productivity in the
oceans" (with the exception of conventional aquaculture and
mariculture).78 When the resolution was adopted, the concern was about
ocean fertilization projects that add iron or other nutrients directly
to ocean water. However, in theory, the resolution could also apply to
atmospheric methane removal projects that lead to ocean fertilization.
Atmospheric methane removal project proponents may argue that their
principal intention is to destroy methane (not to stimulate primary
production in the ocean), but opponents may argue that aerosolizing iron
is an attempted circumvention of the iron fertilization decisions,
especially if those projects are selling carbon credits associated with
ocean fertilization. The 2008 resolution draws a distinction between
ocean fertilization research and deployment. According to the
resolution, ocean fertilization activities conducted as part of
"legitimate scientific research . . . should be regarded as placement of
matter for a purpose other than mere disposal" and thus will qualify for
the dumping exemption if they are not contrary to the aims of the London
Convention or Protocol.79 A framework for assessing research projects
was adopted in 2010.80 It provides for a two-stage review of projects by
the country under whose jurisdiction they occur. The relevant country
must first conduct an "initial assessment" to determine whether the
project "has proper scientific attributes" to qualify as "legitimate
scientific research."81 Projects that qualify must then undergo an
environmental assessment.82 A project may only be approved if
"conditions are in place that ensure that, as far as practicable,
environmental disturbance and detriment would be minimized and the
scientific benefits maximized."83 Whereas the 2008 resolution and 2010
assessment framework envisage that some ocean fertilization research may
qualify for the dumping exemption, deployment has been viewed
differently. The 2008 resolution declares that "ocean fertilization
activities other than legitimate scientific research" are contrary to
the aims of the London Convention and Protocol and thus do not qualify
for the dumping exemption.84 In 2013, the parties to the London Protocol
agreed to an amendment that intended to establish a new permitting
regime for activities involving the "placement of matter into the sea"
for the purposes of "marine geoengineering."85 The amendment defines
marine geoengineering to mean a "deliberate intervention in the marine
environment to manipulate natural processes, including to counteract
anthropogenic climate change and/or its impacts, and that has the
potential to result in deleterious effects."86 It requires parties to
the London Protocol to prohibit the "placement of matter into the sea"
for "marine geoengineering activities listed in annex 4, unless the
listing provides that the activity . . . may be authorized under a
permit."87 To date, only ocean fertilization has been listed, but
several other CDR and solar radiation management (SRM) activities are
currently being considered for listing.88 Atmospheric methane removal
activities that involve the placement of matter in the sea could
similarly be listed in the future. It should be noted that the 2013
amendment has not yet entered into force and thus is not legally
binding. However, a legal committee appointed to advise the London
Convention and Protocol parties on marine geoengineering has urged
parties to "refrain from acts which would defeat the object and purpose
of the amendment," and suggested that it could be provisionally applied
before it enters into force.89 In October 2023, the parties to the
London Convention and Protocol issued a Statement on Marine
Geoengineering in which they declared that certain ocean CDR and SRM
activities90 have "the potential for deleterious effects that are
widespread, long-lasting or severe," and thus "\[a\]ctivities other than
legitimate scientific research should be deferred."91 The statement also
endorsed the 2010 assessment framework, stating that it should "form the
appropriate basis for the assessment of proposed research and
development projects relating to marine geoengineering."92 The parties
might be expected to take a similar approach to atmospheric methane
removal activities. 3.2.4 Montreal Protocol Some proposed atmospheric
methane removal techniques, like AOE, have the potential to affect the
ozone layer. Although research has not yet confirmed this potential
impact, complex, nonlinear alterations to atmospheric chemistry from
aerosol dispersal for the purpose of AOE could bring ozone layer
depletion risks. If research confirms AOE's potential to impact the
ozone layer, use of the techniques could implicate the Montreal Protocol
on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (Montreal Protocol). The
Montreal Protocol was adopted in September 1987 and entered into force
in January 1989 (UN, n.d.-a). The agreement has universal global
participation with 197 signatories (UN, n.d.-a). The parties to the
Montreal Protocol have agreed to "protect the ozone layer by taking
precautionary measures to control equitably total global emissions of
substances that deplete it."93 This is achieved by phasing out the
production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances. Controlled
substances are listed in the annex to the Montreal Protocol, and parties
have flexibility to expand the list over time. The parties to the
Montreal Protocol have adopted a decision to assess the potential of SRM
and its effect on the atmosphere.94 That decision directed expert panels
on science, environmental effects, and technology and economy to conduct
the assessment. This resulted in the inclusion of a chapter on SRM in
the Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion 2022, which concluded,
among other things, that SRM through stratospheric aerosol injection has
the potential to reduce global mean temperatures, that SRM cannot fully
offset the effects of global warming and produces unintended
consequences, that SRM could cause additional ozone depletion, and that
different aerosols might have differing effects on the ozone layer (WMO,
2022). In 2023, the parties to the Montreal Protocol issued a draft
decision that "\[i\]nvites the global scientific community to address
risks and uncertainties for the ozone layer in any scientific studies or
assessments undertaken in relation to stratospheric aerosol
injection."95 If AOE or other atmospheric methane removal approaches
demonstrate potential to damage the ozone layer, the Montreal Protocol
expert panels might similarly be engaged to assess this potential. This
could form the first step toward potential regulation of the production
and use of the substances used in AOE. 3.2.5 Convention on Long-Range
Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP) LRTAP, signed in 1979 and entered
into force in 1983, aims to reduce transboundary air pollution. The
convention has 51 parties, mostly in North America and Europe, including
the United States. LRTAP is notable both for its success in reducing
emissions of harmful substances and air pollution and for its success in
building an extensive network of scientists who exchange information
with policymakers to develop innovative emission control approaches
(UNECE, n.d.). Parties could utilize LRTAP to regulate or incentivize
atmospheric methane removal activities in two ways. Parties could (1)
incentivize atmospheric methane removal as a way to control
transboundary air pollution from methane emissions or (2) regulate
atmospheric methane removal activities directly as potential sources of
transboundary air pollution. LRTAP parties have adopted eight protocols,
most of which address specific pollutants (U.S. Department of State,
n.d.-b). The United States is a party to four of these protocols,
including the Gothenburg Protocol, which seeks to reduce acid rain and
ground-level ozone by targeting emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen
oxides, volatile organic compounds, particulate matter (PM), and black
carbon.96 The Gothenburg Protocol sets targeted emissions reduction
levels for certain sources, like electric generating units, boilers, and
vehicles.97 LRTAP does not currently address methane emissions directly
in its protocols. Parties have, however, identified methane emissions as
an issue of importance and have noted that the Gothenburg Protocol
should consider appropriate steps toward reducing methane emissions as a
way to control ground-level ozone (Mar et al., 2022). If the parties do
address methane emissions through the Gothenburg Protocol, atmospheric
methane removal could be utilized as a control tool to reduce pollution
resulting from methane emissions. LRTAP could also be used to regulate
atmospheric methane removal activities such as AOE or surface
treatments. Those activities are not, at the time of writing, listed as
sources of air pollution under the Gothenburg Protocol. In the future,
those activities could be viewed as a source of transboundary air
pollution and regulated through the LRTAP protocols based on, for
example, the concern that atmospheric methane removal activities could
inadvertently increase ground-level ozone. LRTAP's extensive scientific
network could drive research to develop appropriate regulation of
atmospheric methane removal use. 3.2.6 Environmental Modification
Convention The Convention on the Prohibition of Military or Any Other
Hostile Use of Environmental Modification Techniques (ENMOD) was adopted
in December 1976 and entered into force in October 1978. At the time of
writing, there were 78 parties to ENMOD, including the United States.
Parties to ENMOD agree "not to engage in military or any other hostile
use of environmental modification techniques having widespread,
long-lasting or severe effects."98 ENMOD defines "environmental
modification techniques" as those intended to change, "through the
deliberate manipulation of natural processes, the dynamics, composition
or structure of the Earth."99 This definition would likely include
atmospheric methane removal projects, but ENMOD would only prohibit such
projects if they were undertaken for hostile purposes. ENMOD would not
apply to atmospheric methane removal projects undertaken for peaceful
purposes, including to mitigate climate change.

collected during experiments, and entry and exit of researchers into the
region to conduct scientific activities.]{.underline}102 Notably, the
Agreement defines scientific activities as "efforts to advance
understanding of the Arctic."103 [As such, [atmospheric methane removal
research]{.mark} [projects]{.mark} that [seek to take advantage of the
benefits of the Agreement]{.mark}]{.underline} may need to gear their
research toward advancing Arctic understanding in some way---for
example, through better understanding natural methane emissions in
Arctic regions---in addition to advancing understanding of atmospheric
methane removal.

Regional Governance Possible

Finally, [Arctic interventions pose **less** of a **governance
challenge** than global climate interventions]{.underline}. Many believe
that [**decision-making** by **individual** countries about whether to
undertake global climate interventions would be **problematic**, and
that global governance would therefore be desirable]{.underline}. If so,
there is no obvious institution at the global level with the necessary
mandate, membership and efficacy to decide whether and how to proceed.55
The UN climate change regime is one option and has had some notable
successes, most prominently, the adoption of the Paris Agreement. But
given its consensus decision-making rule and often contentious politics,
assigning it authority over climate interventions could be a recipe for
paralysis. The UN Security Council could make decisions, since climate
change falls within its mandate to address issues of international peace
and security56 and global climate interventions could raise security
issues as well,57 but any permanent Council member could block
decisions.

By contrast, [if **international governance** is needed for **Arctic
interventions**,58 [there is an obvious institution that could play a
governance role, namely, the **A**]{.mark}rctic
**[C]{.mark}**ouncil]{.underline}.59 The Arctic Council was established
in 1996 to promote cooperation and coordination among the Arctic States.
It consists of the eight circumpolar Arctic countries -- Canada,
Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, the Russian Federation, Sweden, and
the United States -- with six organisations representing indigenous
peoples as permanent participants, and thirteen non-Arctic States,
thirteen intergovernmental organisations, and twelve NGOs participating
as observers.

Although Arctic interventions would have global effects, they would not
have setting the global temperature as their purpose. Rather, their
objective would be to slow Arctic melting in order to mitigate the
regional and global harms. For this reason, [[the Arctic **circumpolar
countries**]{.mark} arguably [have the **primary interest**]{.mark} in
deciding whether to proceed]{.underline}.

Because of its relatively small size, [the [**A**rctic
**C**ouncil]{.mark} has been a relatively [effective]{.mark} forum [to
develop]{.mark} **regional [policies]{.mark}** relating to the
Arctic]{.underline}.60 Through its Arctic Monitoring and Assessment
Programme (AMAP), it has conducted assessments of climate change on the
Arctic, and adopted a ministerial declaration in 2017 calling for
reductions in emissions of black carbon. Although it requires consensus
(which could prove difficult given the different interests and policies
of its members61) and does not have the authority to make binding
decisions, [it could serve as a [forum to discuss]{.mark} Arctic
**[intervention]{.mark} proposals**, undertake **assessments** [and make
**recommendations**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

International Law Considerations

Legal analysis of Arctic interventions depends in part on the location
of the interventions. Some interventions might take place on land, for
example, spraying reflective particles on Canadian snow or Greenland
ice, in order to limit melting, or drilling holes through glaciers to
pump out subglacial water. Other interventions might take place at sea,
for example, pumping water from beneath sea ice and spraying it on top,
in order to thicken the ice. Both [[**land** and **sea**-based
interventions would be governed by **i**]{.mark}nternational
environmental **[law]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with sea-based
interventions by the law of the sea as well.

Land-based Interventions

International environmental law imposes relatively modest duties on what
a State may do within its own territory. The primary obligation is the
so-called 'duty to prevent' significant transboundary pollution, which
has been called the 'cornerstone' of international environmental law.62
The duty was first expressed in the Trail Smelter case, in which an
arbitral tribunal concluded that 'no state has the right to use or
permit the use of its territory in such a manner as to cause injury ...
in or to the territory of another or the properties or persons therein,
when the case is of serious consequence'.63 The rule was extended to
apply to pollution of the global commons in Principle 21 of the 1972
Stockholm Declaration on the Human Environment (later reiterated in
Principle 2 of the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development),
which provides that [States have 'the responsibility to ensure thatx
activities within their **jurisdiction** and **control** do not cause
damage to the environment of ... areas beyond the limits of **national
jurisdiction'**.64 The **I**nternational **C**ourt of **J**ustice (ICJ)
declared that this principle is 'part of the corpus of international law
relating to the **environment**']{.underline} in its Nuclear Weapons
Advisory Opinion, 65 and has interpreted it as an obligation to use 'due
diligence' to 'avoid activities ... causing significant damage to the
environment of another State'.66 As a corollary of the duty to prevent,
the ICJ has held that [[States]{.mark} also [have]{.mark} various
**procedural** [duties]{.mark}]{.underline}, including the duty to
undertake an [**e**nvironmental **i**mpact **a**ssessment [when a
proposed activity 'may have a significant]{.mark} adverse
[impact]{.mark} in a **transboundary context**',67 [and to **notify**
and **consult** with]{.mark} potentially [affected States]{.mark} if the
assessment 'confirms' that a planned activity has a risk of significant
**transboundary harm**]{.underline}.68

Whether these pronouncements by the ICJ about the rules of international
environmental law are correct is open to debate. Judgments of the ICJ
are not a formal source of international law,69 so the question is
whether they accurately reflect State practice and opinio juris. Be that
as it may, [exercising [**due diligence** to]{.mark} prevent significant
**transboundary harm**, undertaking **e**nvironmental **a**ssessments,
and [consult]{.mark}ing [with potentially affected States]{.mark}
arguably [represent **sound public policy**]{.mark}, so Arctic States
would be well advised to apply these rules, [whether or not they
represent **binding obligations** under international
law]{.mark}]{.underline}.

How do these norms apply to Arctic interventions? [If **successful**,
[Arctic interventions would clearly have **global**]{.mark} as well as
local [effects]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, one of their primary
motivations would be to ameliorate global warming by maintaining the
Arctic's albedo and limiting the release of greenhouse gases caused by
the thawing of permafrost. But if these are the only transboundary
effects of Arctic interventions, international environmental norms would
not impose any limitations since the Arctic interventions would not
materially differ from other measures a State takes within its own
territory to mitigate climate change.

As for other possible transboundary impacts, there has been very little
research, to date, on possible Arctic interventions, so further research
is needed on whether they might have significant adverse impacts on
other States or on areas of the global commons. If this research
indicated that Arctic interventions may have a significant adverse
impact, then a State would need to conduct an environmental impact
assessment before proceeding and consult with potentially affected
States, although it would not ultimately need permission from other
States in order to undertake the intervention.

Finally, [[international]{.mark} human rights [law]{.mark}]{.underline}
arguably [[establishes **participatory rights** for local
communities]{.mark}, in particular, a right of access [to information
and]{.mark} a right [to participate in decisions]{.mark} that may have a
significant effect on the environment]{.underline}.70 Moreover, if an
Arctic intervention had significant adverse impacts on local
communities, then this could implicate human rights law (for example,
rules relating to indigenous rights, given that about 10% of Arctic
residents are indigenous peoples).

#### The Arctic Council unifies governance for geoengineering.

atn

[[The question is]{.mark} also [**how** to govern the
env]{.mark}ironmental [consequences of geoengineering and **by
whom**]{.mark} these should be governed. [At an international]{.mark}
regulatory [level]{.mark}, different types of targeted [geoengineering
would be **governed by norms**]{.mark} scattered in a series of
different instruments]{.underline}, such as the London Protocol (1996
Protocol to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by
Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter 1972) or the Convention on Biological
Diversity, creating uncertainties on the legal instrument to be used
(Argüello and Johansson 2022; Bodansky and Hunt 2020). As Argüello &
Johansson (2022, 64) argue, [fragmented governance of geoengineering due
to the simultaneous application of multiple regimes may lead to
"governance traps" and possible governance stagnation. Arguably,
**[regional governance]{.mark}** [through the Arctic Council could play
an important role to **unify the regulation** of Arctic
geoengineering]{.mark} (Bodansky and Hunt 2020).]{.underline} However,
given that the Arctic Council has no authority to make legally binding
agreements, this needs to be considered with caution.

Trump's Return and the Strains of Superpower Ambition

Donald **[[Trump]{.mark}'s]{.underline}** re-emergence on the world
stage has [[generated **anxieties**]{.mark} across the Arctic, not least
[in **Greenland**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Reviving his provocative 2019
proposal to buy the island[, Trump has now [extended]{.mark} his
**[rhetoric]{.mark}**, even musing [about annexing]{.mark}
Canada,]{.underline} remarks that [**[blur]{.mark} the [line]{.mark}**
[between]{.mark} political [drama and strategic
outmanoeuvre]{.mark}]{.underline}. These declarations emphasise a
resurgent American nationalism, [[eager to expand]{.mark} influence in
the Arctic [through **unilateral** **posturing** rather than
**diplomacy**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Trump's previous refusal to endorse the Arctic Council's
declaration---solely because it acknowledged climate change--- indicated
his administration's disregard for multilateral cooperation and
Indigenous rights, both foundational to Arctic governance. His return
raises concerns about a renewed assault on those norms.

[[Greenland]{.mark}, however, [is **pushing back**]{.mark}. [Foreign
**Minister**]{.mark}]{.underline} Vivian Motzfeldt [has [made it clear
that]{.mark}]{.underline} while the island maintains security ties with
Washington, [[it does not seek]{.mark} deeper [**political**
**alignment** with the **U.S**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} "We don't want
to be Danes, but we don't want to be Americans either," she said,
affirming Greenland's pursuit of autonomy without subjugation to great
power designs.

At the same time, China's expanding Arctic footprint, anchored by
infrastructure investments and ambitions to carve out shipping lanes,
has disturbed Denmark and its allies. Though Beijing holds only observer
status in the Arctic Council, its long-term strategic goals are being
closely watched.

Positioning itself as a more balanced partner[, **[Greenland]{.mark}**
is actively [courting the Eu]{.mark}ropean Union]{.underline}. With some
of the world's most sought-after rare earths lying beneath its icy
terrain, [Greenland is now [looking to deepen mineral]{.mark} and
**energy [cooperation]{.mark}** with the EU]{.underline}. Buried deep in
Greenland's icy terrain are around 40 of the 50 critical minerals that
the U.S. deems vital to its national security. The resources, from
uranium to graphite, are crucial to manufacturing and global supply
chains, though Greenland's stores are largely unexplored and untapped.
Motzfeldt's recent visit to [Brussels [emphasized]{.mark} the island's
[commitment to]{.mark} building [**durable**, **respectful**
partnerships, offering access to]{.mark} critical [resources]{.mark} in
exchange [for reliable **collaboration**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

But tensions persist. [[Motzfeldt **condemned**]{.mark} recent reports
of [U.S.]{.mark} intelligence operations [targeting Greenland]{.mark} as
a **betrayal** by an ally]{.underline}. "[**[We want]{.mark} reliable
[partnerships, not threats]{.mark}**,"]{.underline} she said, warning
that [[espionage and]{.mark} talk of **[military]{.mark}** action [only
harden Greenland's resolve]{.mark} to **diversify its
alliances**.]{.underline} In this new Arctic reality, the island is
navigating carefully between opportunity and overreach---asserting its
agency in a region too long dominated by outside powers.

Council Cohesion, Russian Isolation, and the Road Ahead

Despite its limitations, the Arctic [[Council]{.underline}]{.mark}
remains the central forum for managing regional issues[. Its [importance
lies]{.mark} not [in]{.mark} treaties or enforcement power, but in
creating **[trust]{.mark}**, fostering **[knowledge]{.mark}**, and
including Indigenous voices in decision-making.]{.underline}

[Three elements make [the Council]{.mark} indispensable]{.underline}:
first, its unique inclusion of Indigenous organizations; second, its
robust scientific networks that produce global data on ocean health,
pollutants, and climate change; and third, its quiet but
[[critical]{.mark} role [in preventing]{.mark} **geopolitical
[escalation]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

But the Council now faces paralysis. Russia, the largest Arctic state,
remains largely isolated after its 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Although
technical collaboration resumed in some working groups in 2024,
political engagement remains frozen. Unlike Norway, Denmark lacks a
robust history of Arctic-specific dialogue with Moscow, making future
efforts to engage Russia diplomatically more difficult.

A joint statement from the Council's 14th ministerial meeting attempted
to hold the line. It reaffirmed commitments to peace, stability, and
sustainable development, but avoided the term "anthropogenic climate
change," likely to maintain consensus. Outgoing Norwegian chair Espen
Barth Eide emphasized the urgency of warming, occurring three to four
times faster in the Arctic than the global average, and called for the
integration of Indigenous and scientific knowledge.

As the new chair, Denmark, through Greenland, must now translate
consensus into action. The Council's 30th anniversary in 2026 offers an
opportunity to renew its mandate and reestablish its credibility.
Greenland's five-point agenda, centred on Indigenous empowerment,
biodiversity, climate action, sustainable development, and ocean
stewardship, provides a constructive roadmap.

Why the Arctic Matters?

What emerges in the Arctic matters for every species on the planet. The
region acts as a thermostat for the Earth's climate system, a barometer
for environmental collapse, and a geopolitical testing ground for global
cooperation.

If warming continues at current rates, not only will Indigenous
communities lose their lands and ways of life, but coastal regions
worldwide will face rising seas and severe weather disruptions. The
Arctic is not just melting, it is sending distress signals for the
entire Earth.

Denmark and Greenland's chairmanship of the Arctic Council comes at a
crossroads. The leadership they show now, in resisting militarization,
strengthening Indigenous rights, promoting scientific integrity, and
upholding environmental norms, could restore the Arctic Council as a
model of cooperative governance in a fractured world.

But this moment calls for more than gestures. [[It demands]{.mark}
political **[resolve]{.mark}**, strategic **[clarity]{.mark}**,
[and]{.mark} a renewed sense of global [**responsibility**. As]{.mark}
**territorial** [**ambitions** intensify]{.mark}]{.underline} and
ecological crises deepen, [the Arctic [Council must]{.mark} move beyond
preservation, and it must reclaim and [reinvigorate]{.mark} its founding
spirit of dialogue and [cooperation]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### The aff's [unilateralism]{.underline} escalates [tensions]{.underline} and Greenland says no. It's [try or die]{.underline} to engage through the Arctic Council.

the Arctic\", ICAS, 1-13-2025,

For Canada, [[Greenland's **proximity**]{.mark} to its Arctic
territories [highlights]{.mark} shared **[security]{.mark}** and
environmental **[concerns]{.mark}**, prompting a measured
response]{.underline}. While Canada is unlikely to support the US
proposal, it is likely to be viewed with a mix of caution and concern[.
Any such [development would be **closely monitored**]{.mark}, with
Canada [emphasising]{.mark} the importance of **[multilateral
cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, environmental stewardship and the
protection of indigenous rights.

**[[Russia]{.mark},]{.underline}** a dominant Arctic power, [may
[**interpret** US interest in **Greenland** as part]{.mark} of
[a]{.mark} broader [strategy to **counter it**]{.mark}**s ambitions**
[in the region]{.mark}]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [Norway and other
[Nordic states prioritise **cooperation** through the]{.mark} **Arctic
[Council]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} are [likely to view]{.mark} any
**[unilateral action with scepticism]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The implications for China, a key stakeholder in Arctic development,
cannot be ignored. Beijing has made substantial investments in
Greenland's infrastructure and mining industries, presenting these
activities as part of its Polar Silk Road initiative. [Any [US attempt
to acquire]{.mark} [Greenland]{.mark} could **disrupt** China's Arctic
strategy, [escalat]{.mark}ing the [US-China]{.mark} **strategic
[rivalry]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Denmark's response to Trump's proposal reflects its broader strategic
priorities. As a Nato member and close US ally, Denmark values its
partnership with Washington but is unlikely to entertain a sale that
undermines its national interests or Greenland's autonomy.

A heightened US focus on Greenland could also influence Denmark's role
in Nato and its relationships with other Arctic states.
[[Denmark]{.mark} may [face **pressure** to balance]{.mark} its
[**alliance** with]{.mark} the US against its commitment to **Arctic
[cooperation]{.mark}** [through **multilateral**
frameworks.]{.mark}]{.underline}

For Greenland, economic independence through resource development and
[**[international]{.mark} partnerships** remains a [key]{.mark}
priority]{.underline}. While some Greenland politicians advocate for
closer ties with the US and see it as an opportunity for economic growth
and infrastructure development, others remain wary of interference,
viewing it as an affront to their autonomy and aspirations for
independence.

A US bid to acquire Greenland, even if unsuccessful, could reopen
debates about how best to balance its aspirations for autonomy with the
need for foreign investment and strategic partnerships.

[A [key factor]{.mark} shaping Denmark and [Greenland's decision-making
is]{.mark} the growing demand for **[Arctic
governance]{.mark}**]{.underline} rooted in sustainability and
indigenous rights. Any discussion of Greenland's future must consider
the aspirations of its people, who are navigating the challenges of
climate change, economic development and cultural preservation.

Trump's idea of buying Greenland, while unlikely to materialise,
highlights the Arctic's growing importance in global geopolitics. Arctic
governance frameworks, particularly [the **Arctic
Council**]{.underline}, [have traditionally focused on **environmental
protection**]{.underline}, scientific research and indigenous rights.
[But the region's [increasing **geopolitical** **competition**]{.mark}
is [putting **pressure** on]{.mark} these [frameworks to address
**security**]{.mark} **concerns**.]{.underline}

A renewed push by the US to strengthen its foothold in Greenland,
whether through diplomatic, economic or territorial overtures, could
complicate the council's dynamics and shift its agenda towards security
and geopolitical competition.

A Greenland sale may be implausible but the broader implications for
Arctic governance, international law and great power competition cannot
be overlooked. Navigating these [[challenges requires]{.mark} careful
[**diplomacy**, respect]{.mark} for sovereignty [and]{.mark} a
commitment to [sustainable development]{.mark} that benefits all Arctic
stakeholders]{.underline}, including its indigenous populations.

"**scientific enterprise"**]{.mark} **[and "knowledge
enhancement]{.mark}**" [in monitoring]{.mark} the glaciers and the
ecosystem in the [Himalaya]{.mark} is a reasoned one.]{.underline}
Reflecting on the scientific temperament of the current government led
by [Prime Minister Narendra [Modi]{.mark}, the MoES [approved]{.mark} of
the [acquisition]{.mark} [of Polar Research Vessel]{.mark} at a total
cost of USD 155 million. This **[will help India widen]{.mark}** the
thrust on **[Arctic research]{.mark}** disciplines undertaken through
Indian research station Himadri.]{.underline} Such a vessel can also
serve as a research platform for scientists to undertake scientific
research in the ocean realm. [However, India has to rework its
engagement to the immediate economic and infrastructure developments in
the Arctic region especially navigation facilities and services. The
commercial and [**strategic interest** will require
Arctic]{.mark}-oriented **[bilateral arrangements]{.mark}**. Countries
like Norway and South Korea can become significant actors in this
calculation]{.underline}. There is a calculation suggesting that India
should leverage trade talks with South Korea to achieve its Arctic
interest. [In 2010, India and South Korea signed a Comprehensive
Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) and in 2015, Prime Minister
[Modi]{.mark} [on]{.mark} his [visit to Seoul]{.mark} [advanced]{.mark}
the [CEPA to include maritime]{.mark} transport and sharing of maritime
technologies \[34\]. [As the Northern Sea Route opens]{.mark} up, [South
Korea will emerge as]{.mark} the next [hub for oil]{.mark} storage and
[thus **India's calculations**]{.mark} [can]{.mark} clearly **[have
dividends]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Not surprisingly, talks to review the
Indo-Korean Free Trade Agreement (FTA) are underway. [[India's
relation]{.mark}s with South Korea [has]{.mark} the [potential to give
**economic impetus in**]{.mark} the **[Arctic]{.mark}**, [particularly
as]{.mark} India's traditional partner [Russia forges]{.mark} strategic
[partnership with China]{.mark} in the Arctic. The [Council]{.mark} in
an indirect way [is providing]{.mark} [further impetus]{.mark} to these
developments.]{.underline} India is one of the fastest energy consumer
in the world and the Arctic presents an opportunity to rekindle
relationship with Russia in exploring the hydrocarbon potential.
[[India's]{.mark} labour force with skills in port development and
mining [can help develop]{.mark} the [Barents]{.mark}
[region]{.mark}.]{.underline} Norway has good relations with Russia in
the Arctic evidenced from the 25-years old Barents Cooperation on a
number of areas, including commercial development, transport and
communication, culture, environmental protection and security. Along
with Finland and Sweden, it has proven to be one of the most enduring
and constructive multilateral cooperation in the north since the end of
the Cold War. On the other hand, with India's roboust relations with
Norway and its deep bonds with Russia, an informal triumvirate (Norway
--- Russia --- India) can become an important catalyst of peace and
development in the Arctic.

India\'s Strategic Prospects in the Arctic

[[India\'s active role in the Arctic Council reflects]{.mark} its
[expanding global engagement]{.mark} and recognition of the Arctic\'s
strategic importance.]{.underline} While not an Arctic nation by
geography, India\'s involvement is driven by a variety of security
interests.

Economic Opportunities through New Maritime Routes

The shifting geopolitics and the thawing of Arctic ice have revealed
[[new maritime routes]{.underline}]{.mark}, presenting economic
opportunities for the global community. With its considerable maritime
capabilities, India is keen to utilize these newly accessible passages,
such as the Northern Sea Route and the Northwest Passage, for enhanced
trade and resource exploration. These routes, now more navigable due to
climate change, [offer reduced transit times and costs, making them
[vital to]{.mark} India\'s [economic
ambitions]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Resource Exploration and Sustainable Exploitation

The Arctic is rich in untapped natural resources, including oil, gas,
and minerals. [[As]{.mark} India\'s [energy needs grow, the
region]{.mark} is seen as a [potential source to meet]{.mark} these
[demands]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, the competition for these
resources could lead to conflicts. [India\'s **[participation in the
Arctic Council]{.mark}** serves as [a diplomatic channel]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} discussions on [resource management]{.mark}, ensuring
sustainable [and cooperative]{.mark} resource
[utilization]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Security Challenges and Collaborative Solutions

The retreat of Arctic ice has led to increased human activities, such as
shipping, tourism, and research, which introduce security concerns like
accidents, oil spills, and potential militarization. [[India
recognizes]{.mark} [the need for]{.mark} joint [efforts within the
Arctic Council]{.mark} to address these issues]{.underline}, advocating
for comprehensive frameworks for search and rescue, environmental
safeguards, and conflict prevention.

Climate Change Impact and Global Collaboration

The Arctic significantly affects global climate patterns, influencing
weather systems and sea levels. India, vulnerable to climate change, is
concerned about the effects of Arctic warming on its monsoon and other
climatic events. [Active [engagement]{.mark} in the Arctic Council
[allows India to contribute to]{.mark} international efforts to [combat
climate change]{.mark} and adapt to its consequences]{.underline}.

Diplomatic Engagement and Global Standing

[[The Arctic Council serves as a conduit for]{.mark} dialogue and
[**cooperation between Arctic and non-Arctic states**.]{.mark} [India\'s
involvement fosters diplomatic ties]{.mark} and addresses mutual
concerns, [enhancing its **international stature** and promoting
**collaboration**]{.mark}]{.underline} on wider issues such as
environmental conservation, scientific exploration, and sustainable
progress.

Leveraging India\'s Stature in the Arctic

[India has the opportunity to bolster its global stature by leveraging
its observer status at the Arctic Council. Active participation in
governance initiatives and working groups is key]{.underline}. The
chance to partake in crafting scientific cooperation agreements
underscores India\'s potential for a more pronounced role in Arctic
governance. By intensifying involvement in working groups, engaging in
Arctic forums, and fostering private sector investments, [India can
amplify its influence]{.underline} and affirm its reputation as a
responsible global actor.

Strategic ventures, such as forging LNG agreements with Russia and
fortifying ties with nations like South Korea, are in line with India\'s
escalating energy needs and commitment to environmental responsibility[.
As India seeks partnerships in the Arctic, [collaborative
efforts]{.mark}]{.underline} in infrastructure development, including
port construction, can act as a cornerstone for trust-building.
Moreover, deploying skilled Indian labor for economic ventures and
disaster response, even outside the Arctic, [[can advance broader
regional objectives and **reinforce** diplomatic
relations]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### India's interest in working with the Arctic Council is only growing

**Veselova '25** (Darya N. -- Associate Professor of Political Science
and Law @ Saint Petersburg State University, \"Participation of India in
the Arctic Council\", 03-17-2025, Arctic and North, DOI:
https://doi.org/10.37482/issn2221-2698.2025.58.117//phs-maubu)

Thus, based on the data in Table 3 13 and the circumstances mentioned
above, the following conclusions can be made. Firstly, due to the
absence of a report for 2015, it turns out that in 2013---2015, India
participated in only 2 environmental projects of the CAFF working group.
Similarly, for the period 2021--2023, the lack of data leads to the
conclusion that India participated in only 3 projects during these
years, which is most likely incorrect, since [[India's interest in the
Arctic is only growing every year]{.underline}]{.mark}, which means that
the country is interested in implementing projects, including in the
field of ecology. [India also prioritizes studying climate change in the
Arctic and protecting the environment in the region]{.underline}. This
area is also highlighted in India's Arctic Policy, adopted in 2022.
Therefore, further detailed research on this issue requires India's 2023
report, which is not currently available.

Over the period 2015--2017, [[there has been an increase in]{.mark} the
number of India's [projects]{.mark}]{.underline}. Their total number is
20. For the period 2017--2019, one can see a decrease in the number of
projects to 9. In 2019--2021, there is again an increase in the projects
in which India is involved to 21 projects.

However, it is difficult to trust the data contained in the report for
2017 due to the fact that the projects implemented in the Arctic
territories are not distributed among the working groups of the Arctic
Council, and the table presented in the report is titled "Current
projects of Indian institutes/universities in the Arctic region" \[3,
Zaikov K.S., Bhagwat D.V.\]. In addition, the report does not contain
information on three projects implemented by India from 2013/2015 to the
present within the framework of CAFF and PAME, which are mentioned on
the official website of the AC.

In the reports for 2019 and 2021, all projects are distributed among
groups. As can be seen from the table, there was an increase in the
number of projects being implemented from 9 in 2017-2019 to 21 in
2019--2021. Firstly, [[the]{.mark} sharp [increase]{.mark} in the number
of projects may [correlate with the fact that]{.mark} in 2018, [the
specialized]{.mark} scientific [institution of India]{.mark} responsible
for conducting expeditions and other scientific activities at the
Poles]{.underline} \[4, Voronchikhina D.N.\] [[changed its name from the
National Centre for Antarctic and Ocean Research]{.mark} (NCAOR)
[to]{.mark} the National Centre for [Polar]{.mark} and Ocean
Research]{.underline} (NCPOR) \[3, Zaikov K.S., Bhagwat D.V., p. 266\].
[[The renaming]{.mark} of NCAOR to NCPOR [indicates India's increased
interest]{.mark} over the past five years [in]{.mark} scientific
research of [the Arctic]{.mark} region]{.underline}, which is closely
related to the study of the ecology, ecosystem, biodiversity of the
Arctic, and climate change in the region. Secondly, 2018 is the year
when [[India and]{.mark} the Arctic states, namely [Russia and
Canada]{.mark}, [issued joint statements in bilateral meetings]{.mark},
[which discussed the development of]{.mark} mutually beneficial
[cooperation]{.mark} in the Arctic, including joint scientific research
on issues such as melting ice, climate change, marine life and
biodiversity]{.underline} 14. Thirdly, in 2019, [[India was re-elected
as an observer to the Arctic Council]{.mark}, which allowed it to
establish itself in this role and [increase its presence in]{.mark} the
implementation of [projects]{.mark} carried out with[in]{.mark} the
framework of the AC [working groups]{.mark}.]{.underline}

**[[The increase in]{.mark} the number of [projects]{.mark} may
[indicate India's increased interest in participating in the Arctic
Council]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and therefore in addressing
environmental issues in the Arctic region.

[[India's **participation in the Arctic Council**]{.mark} as an observer
state [**gives it a chance** to explore the Arctic]{.mark} region in
order to build its economy, marking its presence in the
region]{.underline}. India's sustainable Arctic policy can benefit the
country in various ways. The Northern Sea Route might help India in
reduced cost for shipping companies along with time, fuel and security
costs for transmitting goods. Meanwhile, China gaining accessibility in
the Arctic through the Northern Sea Route might hamper India's economic
growth, keeping in view the relationship between the two countries.

Opinions are divided on India's involvement in the Arctic due to
potential climate change impacts on India's economy and the world. This
concern stems from the Arctic mining for fossil fuels as there is no
clear Arctic strategy being formulated yet. Moreover, the potential
environmental consequences of Arctic mining underscores the urgency for
India to develop a well-defined and sustainable Arctic strategy.

On the other hand, India's diplomatic and scientific engagement in the
Arctic could be beneficial. With a team of knowledgeable
environmentalists, India can conduct expeditions and scientific research
for sustainable development, ensuring the Arctic remains safe, stable
and secure. This approach aligns India's Act East Policy with countries
like Singapore, Japan and Korea, bringing in a new perspective with
Asian participation.

[Along with China, Japan, South Korea, and Singapore, [India was one of
the five Asian countries to]{.mark} [receive observer status]{.mark} in
the Arctic Council in 2013. [India is]{.mark} a member of the Ny-Ålesund
Science Managers Committee (NySMAC), the International Arctic Science
Committee (IASC), and is **[actively]{.mark} [involved]{.mark}** [in
projects with the Arctic Council Working Groups]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The University of the Arctic welcomed students from India in 2019.
Indian researchers will have more opportunity to take part in various
subject courses and research networks relating to the Arctic as a
result.1)

[[India's policy]{.mark} also [emphasizes **cooperating with Arctic
countries**]{.mark} to produce green energy, utilize resources, and
expand green and clean industry. [India and Denmark]{.mark} have
[established a green strategic]{.mark} [relationship]{.mark} that would
see them work together on issues such as waste management, pollution
control, green technology, and renewable energy]{.underline}. Private
Indian players haven't made significant investments in the Arctic. The
Arctic strategy, however, encourages Indian businesses to apply for
membership in the Arctic Economic Council and participate in its five
working groups, which include the blue economy, maritime transportation,
connectivity, investment and infrastructure, and responsible resource
development. Keeping in mind its global responsibilities, the major
environmental implications, and the concerns of the indigenous
community, India wants to adopt a responsible approach for forming
partnerships with Arctic nations in sustainable resource extraction.2)

India's Historical Engagement in the Arctic

[[India has]{.underline}]{.mark} long harboured [[a curiosity about the
Arctic r]{.mark}egion]{.underline},\[a\] but its formal Arctic
involvement began in February 1920,\[24\] when it signed the Svalbard
Treaty in Paris under the British Empire.\[25\] In 1981, India
established the Department of Ocean Development (DOD), which was tasked
with advancing knowledge of the oceans through researching technology to
capitalise on marine resources and explore the physical, chemical, and
biological components of oceans. In 2006, the DOD was reorganised into
the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES), which had increased authority and
financial independence.\[26\] The MoES was responsible for exploring the
oceans and managing resources, both domestically and internationally,
and also became the hub for India's research in the Arctic and Antarctic
oceans.\[27\]

[In 2007, [India sent]{.mark} its first [**scientific expedition** to
the **Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline}, with a focus on
[[studying]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [bio]{.mark}logy, oceanography,
[atmosphere, and glaciers]{.mark}]{.underline} in the region. The
following year, [India established its first Arctic research
station]{.underline}, Himadri, at Ny-Alesund in Svalbard, Norway.\[28\]
In 2013[, **[India]{.mark} was granted [observer status in the Arctic
Council]{.mark}, which [allowed it to participate actively]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark}]{.underline} Arctic [**policy [discussions]{.mark}** [and
project]{.mark} undertaking[s]{.mark}.]{.underline} In 2014,
[[India]{.mark}'s first multi-sensor moored observatory]{.underline},
IndArc, was [[deployed]{.underline}]{.mark} in Kongsfjorden, and in
2016, [[an atmospheric lab]{.mark}oratory was deployed at
Gruvebadet.\[29\]]{.underline}

#### India has stated in policy documents that they will cooperate with the AC.

[India is home to a major part of the Himalayas, which, at times, is
referred to as the Third Pole.]{.underline} The drastic melting of the
glaciers, flooding of the plains, severe monsoon effects, and inundation
of coastal cities due to climate change are serious concerns in India.
[[**India**, in]{.mark} the [policy document, speaks]{.mark} clearly
[about]{.mark} the [impact of climate change]{.mark} [on]{.mark} its
[economy]{.mark} and its effect on the yield of summer
crop]{.underline}s such as rice, pulses, and soybeans which contributes
to almost 50% of India's food output, which is totally dependent on the
monsoon cycle and the glacial waters that feed its river system. [India,
[with]{.mark} a [population of 1.3 billion]{.mark}, [**cannot afford to
risk** its food]{.mark} security, [water]{.mark} security, [and economic
**security**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The **[Arctic Policy emphasises]{.mark} the [need]{.mark} [to
study]{.mark}** the linkages between [the glaciers in the]{.mark}
[**Arctic** and Himalayas]{.mark}, [citing]{.mark} the [IPCC's]{.mark}
Special [Report]{.mark} on Ocean and Cryosphere (2019).]{.underline} The
National Center for Polar and Ocean Research (NCPOR) is the nodal body
that functions under the Ministry of Earth Sciences, which conducts
research activities and various scientific expeditions in both the poles
and also in the Himalayas. India sees itself as a 'Tripolar state', with
its presence in both the poles through its research facilities, and in
the Himalayas, through which it is able to contribute efficiently in the
area of scientific and environmental research, especially in the area of
[climate change by harmonising the research conducted in the Polar
Regions and the Himalayas.]{.underline}

[**[India is]{.mark} also [interested in working]{.mark} [with]{.mark}**
the various working groups of **[the Arctic]{.mark} [Council]{.mark}**
[to contribute towards the conservation]{.mark} of Arctic flora and
fauna, marine environmental protection, addressing environmental
emergencies, search and rescue efforts, and more. The [Policy focuses
on]{.mark} further [strengthening India's scientific research through
cooperation]{.mark} with Arctic states and other partners. To increase
its capacity, India is planning to set up dedicated institutional
funding support for Arctic research at the national level.]{.underline}

India has undertaken 13 expeditions to the Arctic and 41 expeditions to
the Antarctic; yet, it has been chartering Polar Research Vehicles to
conduct its research. In October 2014, the Cabinet Committee on Economic
Affairs approved the acquisition of an icebreaker
vessel[\[3\]](applewebdata://739BD869-2609-4E07-8034-0C65FCC4CDC4#_ftn3), but
due to escalated cost and changes in design and technical
specifications, it did not go ahead. India's Parliamentary Standing
Committee on 'Science and Technology, Environment, Forests and Climate
Change' 2021-2022 has requested the allocation of funds towards the
acquisition of Polar Research
Vehicles[\[4\]](applewebdata://739BD869-2609-4E07-8034-0C65FCC4CDC4#_ftn4). India's
Arctic Policy document also stresses the urgent need to acquire
ice-class Polar Research Vessels and to strengthen India's domestic
capability to build such vessels through the initiatives of 'Atmanirbhar
Bharat' (Self Reliant India) and 'Make in India' -- not least to bring
India in line with other Asian observer states such as China and Japan.

The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) is known for its
cost-effective launching of satellites, and India is keen on sharing its
expertise in 'providing effective satellite-enabled communication and
digital connectivity in remote areas in the Arctic'. India has launched
a geostationary communication and meteorological satellite named South
Asia Satellite (formerly known as SAARC Satellite) to support regional
cooperation and to benefit its neighbouring states by providing support
in areas such as telecommunication, meteorological forecasting and
disaster management support, and India also supports the IMO through its
regional navigation satellite system. The policy also discusses the
US-India NASA-ISRO collaborative mission NISAR which will be launching a
satellite to study earth-changing ecosystems, ice mass, sea-level rise
due to climate change, and more, intended for 'better management of the
natural resources and hazards globally, including the Arctic'.

Although India's focus till now was primarily on scientific research and
climate change, the new Arctic policy has increased India's engagement
towards other areas such as its economic and strategic interest,
international cooperation, and capacity building. India has tried to
balance its energy needs, climate change and geopolitics through its
Arctic policy.

### S \-\-- India Co-op \-\-- China !

#### Arctic Council cooperation with [India]{.underline} solves [Chinese expansionism]{.underline} and [Russian isolationism]{.underline}.

**Khorrami '24** \[Nima Khorrami, Research Associate at The Arctic
Institute, 09-30-2024, \"India's Arctic Challenge: Aligning Strategic
Interests With Regional Realities\", No Publication,
https://thediplomat.com/2024/09/indias-arctic-challenge-aligning-strategic-interests-with-regional-realities/\]

India's Arctic strategy remains in its formative stages, reflecting the
relatively undeveloped nature of the country's Arctic policy. Despite
the limited body of literature on the subject, however, a recurring
theme advocates for greater [Indian engagement in the
Arctic]{.underline} to better safeguard and [secure India's
expanding]{.underline} [interests both in the region and
globally.]{.underline}

[India's interests]{.underline} in the Arctic [are]{.underline}
primarily [centered on scientific cooperation]{.underline},
[environmental monitoring]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}, more
recently, [resource security]{.underline}. For instance, the Arctic
holds significant importance for Indian scientists due to its direct
impact on India's monsoon patterns, which are crucial for the
agricultural sector and the country's overall food security.
Additionally, the increasing accessibility of the Arctic presents New
Delhi with opportunities to meet its growing energy demands and address
its shortage of strategic rare earth elements (REEs) -- notwithstanding
its awareness that the harsh environmental conditions, high costs of
extraction, and the need for advanced technology pose substantial
barriers.

A notable, and relatively recent, development in India's Arctic strategy
is the emerging narrative among Indian strategists that posits [New
Delhi's engagement with Russia in the Arctic as a strategic necessity to
counter the perceived rise of Chinese influence in the
region]{.underline}. This discourse [seeks to justify India's
push]{.underline} [for a greater regional presence]{.underline}, and its
close cooperation with Russia, as a means [to counter
Beijing's]{.underline} growing [interests in the Arctic]{.underline} and
its broader influence over Moscow.

[India is]{.underline} being portrayed as [a counterbalance to
China]{.underline}, [offering Russia a viable alternative to
avoid]{.underline} [international isolation]{.underline} and
over-dependency on Beijing. Given the perceived importance of the
Russian Arctic in addressing India's energy and mineral security and
growing concerns with regard to a China-Russia partnership in the
Arctic, enhanced bilateral cooperation between India and Russia in the
Arctic is held up as a welcomed alternative to China's influence; one
that would satisfy both India's and its Western partners' strategic
interests.

In an important sense, this approach is the mirror image of New Delhi's
strategy in Central Asia, where it has sought to counter China's
expanding influence -- viewed as a strategic vulnerability -- by,
amongst other things, leveraging Russian concerns about China's growing
presence. The argument suggests that India's strategic interest lies in
diversifying Russia's partnerships away from China by providing
alternatives in markets, finance, and manpower.

However, much like its strategy in Central Asia, New Delhi's approach to
the Arctic may be unsuccessful for similar reasons. Its strategy appears
to be a reactionary stance focused more on countering China than on
responding to the specific dynamics of the Arctic region. By emphasizing
its close relations with the Arctic 7 (A7) to justify its reliability in
working with Russia, India overlooks a critical point: While most A7
countries view China's growing influence in the Arctic as problematic,
they do not consider it an immediate threat to regional cooperation.
Instead, it is Russia -- the very actor to which India seems eager to
anchor its regional policy -- that raises the most concerns.

This tension is most evident in the calls to support Russia's proposal
for greater BRICS+ engagement in the Arctic. The reasoning behind this
is that coordination between India and Russia within BRICS is crucial to
avoid surprises from joint Russian and Chinese proposals and initiatives
in the Arctic. However, India's Western partners are likely to reject
such calls as they promote greater multipolarity in Arctic governance --
an idea that none of the Arctic states, including Russia until recently,
has favored. Arctic states prefer to maintain the current exclusive
arrangements in regional governance, where only states with Arctic
territory are entitled to participate in and shape the regional
governance structure.

India's support for the Russian proposal, while serving its interests in
limiting Russia-China cooperation and Russia's desire to avoid
over-reliance on Beijing, stands in stark contrast to its Western
allies' preference for exclusivity. As a result, it is unlikely to be
welcomed in Western Arctic capitals.

Instead of aligning with Russia, [India should consider forging an
approach with other like-minded non-regional states such as Japan and
South Korea]{.underline}, [both of which share India's concerns about
the growing China-Russia cooperation in the Arctic and the potential for
their businesses to lose out on Arctic opportunities to Chinese
competitors]{.underline}. [The trio should]{.underline} then [advocate
within the Arctic Council]{.underline} for enhanced observer
participation to rectify current disparities and promote a more
inclusive and equitable Council, [fostering a balanced Arctic
perspective]{.underline}.

To this end, [the underlying goal must be]{.underline} twofold. First,
to convince the Nordic states, as well as the United States and Canada,
to more rapidly open up their Arctic regions to commercial activities
thereby providing a real alternative to Russia's Arctic, where most
commercial activities are currently concentrated. Second, to push for a
reformed Arctic Council -- one with the mandate to debate hard security
issues -- [to avoid polarization and fragmentation in the regional
governance system whereby Russia and its partners adhere to one set of
rules while the A7 states follow another.]{.underline}

### S \-\-- Minerals \-\-- Co-op Key

[MINERALS RESOURCES OF THE [ARCTIC]{.mark} OCEAN]{.underline}

Generally, marine minerals are categorized into three principal types
derived by their formation and incidence:

- [Polymetallic nodules]{.underline} ("nodules") -- Found on abyssal
  plains, these nodules are rich in manganese, nickel, copper, and
  cobalt.

- [Ferromanganese crusts]{.underline} ("crusts") -- Occurring on
  seamounts and ridges, these crusts contain cobalt, rare earth elements
  (REEs), and platinum-group metals.

- [Seafloor massive sulfides]{.underline} -- Associated with
  hydrothermal vents, SMS deposits can be enriched in copper, zinc,
  gold, and silver.

Seabed resources thus [offer **[multiple]{.mark} types of [critical
minerals]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with individual [ore grades
often]{.underline} matching or **[[exceeding terrestrial
resources]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Nodules and crusts particularly can
[produce many metals as coproducts, [improving **economic
yield**]{.mark} and [reducing]{.mark} the [intensity of
processing]{.mark}]{.underline}. The four [[primary metals]{.mark} of
interest]{.underline} -- [cobalt, nickel, copper, and
manganese]{.underline} -- [are all [major]{.mark} inputs [to **renewable
energy**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [batteries, nuclear power, and other
energy infrastructure. All four]{.underline} targets, as well as trace
but valuable REEs, are [subject to complete or majority import
dependence for the U.S.]{.underline} (mainly from China).

Limited oceanographic expeditions have found all three types of marine
minerals in the Arctic, though [[data]{.mark} on resource [occurrence,
abundance, and distribution]{.mark} are extremely
[limited]{.mark}]{.underline}. Historically this was [[due to sea
ice]{.mark}, [challenging]{.mark} operating [conditions, and]{.mark} the
[lack of]{.mark} an [economic case **absent strategic
imperatives.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

A pioneering 2017 study, however, revealed that the [nature of Arctic
marine minerals may be **substantially different** from other deep sea
mineral deposits. **[American and Russian research
programs]{.mark}**]{.underline}, enabled by shrinking sea ice, began the
first major mineralogical surveys in the late 2000s and early 2010s.
Hein et. al. (2017) [[reported]{.mark} that]{.underline} this [data
indicates nodules and crusts in the Arctic Ocean are **compositionally
unique** compared to other oceanic deposits]{.underline}. Although the
primary metals targeted by conventional deep sea miners (Co, Ni, and Cu)
had lower concentrations than equatorial regions, the [[Arctic]{.mark}
samples had]{.underline} somewhat [[**higher levels** of]{.mark} the
[most valuable REEs]{.mark} [and vanadium]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Most strikingly, [samples of both nodules and crusts were found to
possess unusually high levels of [scandium]{.mark}]{.underline} -- 50
ppm, approximately [**[ten times higher]{.mark}** than CCZ nodules.
Scandium]{.underline}, an obscure REE, [is potentially [valuable
for]{.mark} solid oxide fuel cells, **[renewable energy]{.mark}**
alloys, **[military]{.mark}** aircraft, [missile]{.mark}
systems]{.underline}, and other applications. Listed by all three
critical mineral lists in the United States (DOD, DOE, USGS), one
analysis has additionally declared scandium as one of twelve "strategic
defense critical minerals." Current [global [production]{.mark} is [less
than 25 tons]{.mark} annually]{.underline}, but [projections indicate
**[demand]{.mark} as high as [5,300 tons]{.mark}** just [for clean
energy]{.mark} applications by 2030]{.underline}. There are [no
dedicated scandium mines]{.underline} (it is produced as a minor
coproduct), and it is 100% imported by the U.S.

These early surveys underscore the Arctic marine minerals are largely
uncharacterized, in part due to the mineral formation environment. The
[Arctic Ocean]{.underline} is bound by multiple continents, fed by large
terrestrial basins, and subject to extreme weather conditions, creating
[unique geological conditions for mineral formation]{.underline}. A 2024
study found that [Arctic basin has **mineralization**]{.underline}
through fault-driven hydrothermal processes, a previously undocumented
mechanism in the region. Such findings indicate that [[mineral
deposit]{.mark} types [in]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} could
be [**[greater than assumed]{.mark}**, reinforcing the need for
extensive seabed surveys.]{.underline}

As a brief aside, there may be an additional [critical mineral source in
the Arctic Ocean: **[oil and gas]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Researchers are
investigating critical mineral extraction from produced water during
fossil development. Watson et. al. posit that the source rocks of
Alaska's North Slope oil and gas fields contain high levels of REE and
other valuable minerals, and that [produced water
extraction]{.underline} could [enable]{.underline} [**mineral
coproduction** across future Arctic offshore oil and gas
operations.]{.underline}

[**Economic viability** will determine the Arctic's potential marine
mineral resources]{.underline} -- [[lacking survey data]{.mark}, [it is
unknown]{.mark} whether it can be feasible.]{.underline} Deep sea mining
operations globally are in their infancy, although equatorial regions
are on the verge of initial commercial mining. The mineral economics of
equatorial seabed mining depend highly on commodity prices, which have
been especially volatile since the COVID-19 supply disruptions.

Arctic deep sea mining operations will be more challenging than
equatorial equivalents. Exploration and mining operations will have to
contend with variable and retreating ice, needing both ice-class vessels
and potential icebreaker support. Extreme weather conditions and cold
may drive seasonal production. Arctic infrastructure is nascent and may
need significant investment to support an influx of vessels, especially
for mineral off-load and transport. Conversely, the Arctic Ocean
features shallower depths than Pacific equivalents, potentially
simplifying operations. Ultimately, [the [economics]{.mark} of the
endeavor]{.underline} [[depend on]{.underline}]{.mark} broader
infrastructure and **[[geopolitical developments]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

### S \-\-- Native Climate Adaptation

#### The structure of the Arctic Council is key to environment and decolonial justice for Indigenous Peoples

Governance, DOI: 10.4324/9781003371885-11//phs-maubu)

This chapter argues that [[the Arctic Council]{.underline}]{.mark},
through its knowledge production via working groups, expert groups, and
task forces, creates a normative space for shaping environmental policy
and governance in the Arctic region.1 This space [[allows
for]{.underline}]{.mark} some [[reconfiguration of power]{.mark}
relations [between states and Indigenous Peoples]{.mark}]{.underline},
particularly at the working group level where participation is more
equitable and where the real influence and relationship building can
occur.2 In this governance structure, [[Indigenous]{.mark} political
[organizations]{.mark} navigate their roles beyond mere consultative
status at the ministerial level, actively [engag]{.mark}ing [as]{.mark}
project [partners in working group]{.mark}s. [This]{.mark} inclusive
approach, which [diverges from typical international practices]{.mark},
[underscores the Council's role]{.mark} in redefining power dynamics
between states and Indigenous Peoples.]{.underline}3

The right to participation in decision-making in matters that affect
Indigenous Peoples is often touted as one of the cornerstones of Arctic
governance.4 As such, the participation of Indigenous Peoples'
organizations in several international institutions that are considered
part of Arctic governance is well documented in the academic literature.
Most famously, the role of "Permanent Participants" has been the focus
of most of the academic output on inclusive participation of Indigenous
Peoples in Arctic governance.5

**[Building on the premise that [environmental and decolonial justice
can only be achieved if Indigenous Peoples]{.mark} truly
[achieve]{.mark} [normative agency]{.mark}]{.underline}**,6 this chapter
analyzes how the adoption of rights-based language and frameworks
enhances the influence of Indigenous organizations. Previous analysis
reveals that, unlike the domestic obstacles encountered in applying the
UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and the
International Labour Organization Convention 169,7 the Arctic Council
faces no such barriers institutionally.8 However, from a justice
perspective, the question is whether this is conducive to Indigenous
agency[. This chapter outlines [the Arctic Council]{.mark}'s role in
regional governance, emphasizing its [facilitat]{.mark}ion of
[cooperation and knowledge generation]{.mark} among various
stakeholders]{.underline}. It then reviews the contribution of
Indigenous actors to this process, analyzing the outputs of the
Council's six working groups up to the end of Iceland's chairship in
2021. The findings highlight the successful integration of Indigenous
knowledge into the Council's scientific work, though it notes the
limited impact on enabling Indigenous agency.

The Arctic Council's Role in Arctic Governance

Mikhail Gorbachev's 1987 speech in Murmansk marked a significant shift
towards peace and cooperation in the Arctic, signalling a departure from
the tense relations that had dominated the region since World War II.9
This vision set the stage for a new era of collaboration, exemplified by
Finland's initiative to gather the eight Arctic states in Rovaniemi in
1989 to discuss the protection of the Arctic environment. This gathering
paved the way for the creation of the Arctic Environment Protection
Strategy (AEPS) through the Rovaniemi Declaration, a foundational
document for Arctic cooperation that included Indigenous organizations.
The AEPS, initially focusing on environmental protection, soon expanded
to incorporate sustainable development principles, laying the groundwork
for the establishment of the Arctic Council in 1996 through the Ottawa
Declaration.10

The Arctic Council serves as an intergovernmental forum, distinct from a
formal international organization due to its lack of legal personality
under international law. Its foundation on a political declaration
limits its decision-making capacity, yet it has become a pivotal body
for Arctic environmental governance.11 This informal structure aligns
with trends of state cooperation and significantly influences the
Council's operations.12 The Council's consensus-based approach and lack
of legal personality have fostered a flexible international and
transnational space for Arctic policy development. This flexibility has
facilitated the Council's ability to adapt and address the
science-policy interface effectively.13

Despite not having an independent legislative or policy-making
authority, the Arctic Council is mandated by the 1996 Ottawa Declaration
to promote cooperation and interaction among Arctic states on issues
related to sustainable development and environmental protection. Unlike
other international bodies that may function as de facto lawmakers, the
Arctic Council's political status means it does not negotiate
international treaties or make binding decisions. Its structure,
including working groups, task forces, Senior Arctic Officials, and the
ministerial level, supports its role as a primary source of knowledge
and research on Arctic changes.

The involvement of Indigenous Permanent Participants in the Arctic
Council,14 despite their limited decision-making power, emphasizes the
Council's commitment to integrating Indigenous perspectives in
environmental governance. This innovative approach has spurred
collaboration on Arctic environmental and development matters.
Nonetheless, the actual application of Indigenous rights and views
within the Council's activities invites scrutiny on how it enhances
Indigenous agency. A detailed analysis of the Council's impact on
policy, law, and science sheds light on its success in weaving
international human rights standards into environmental governance.

As an environmental organization, [the Arctic Council]{.underline}
primarily engages in generating knowledge and reinforcing norms.15 These
functions extend beyond merely [producing and sharing scientific and
traditional environmental knowledge [to]{.mark} include the
[integrat]{.mark}ion of this knowledge [into]{.mark} the
[governance]{.mark} framework]{.underline}, thereby strengthening the
regime's underlying norms and rules. This involves creating an epistemic
community that combines scientists and researchers, who provide a deep
understanding of environmental challenges and normative frameworks, with
policymakers and diplomats, who translate this knowledge into actionable
governance strategies. This collaborative process is where the Arctic
Council significantly contributes to filling the governance gap in the
Arctic region, bridging the divide between knowledge production and
normative reinforcement in environmental governance.

Knowledge Production, Normative Changes and Indigenous Rights

The Arctic Council, lacking formal legislative powers, facilitates state
cooperation and policy alignment, thereby endorsing the sovereignty of
Arctic states. According to Knecht and Kneil, it has contributed to
reasserting rather than diminishing the territorial claims of these
states, embedding the concept of sovereignty within the Arctic's
territorial and maritime domains.16 This includes a procedural
requirement for non-Arctic states seeking observer status to respect
Arctic sovereignty, as outlined in the Council's 2013 procedural rules,
inadvertently supporting existing colonial dynamics over promoting
regional Indigenous sovereignties. [Beyond its role as a political
forum,]{.underline} the Arctic Council is a pivotal producer of
[[knowledge]{.mark}, influencing regional [policies and]{.mark}
contributing to global environmental [treaties]{.mark}. It has also been
instrumental in negotiating several key multilateral agreements focused
on Arctic-specific issues, such as search and rescue operations, oil
spill responses, and scientific collaborations.]{.underline}

[The Council's emphasis on knowledge production, through science
diplomacy and the work of its working groups, [has fostered a
**normative framework** conducive to]{.mark} [peace]{.mark}ful Arctic
governance relations and potential policy shifts]{.underline}. The
inclusion of Indigenous knowledge in scientific assessments, such as the
2004 Arctic Climate Impact Assessment Report, demonstrates the Council's
commitment to integrating Indigenous knowledge into its environmental
studies, aligning with international legal standards for Indigenous
consultation and participation.

[The Council is recognized for [advocating Indigenous participation
rights, and establishing mechanisms for]{.mark} Indigenous
organizations' [involvement]{.mark} in Arctic governance.]{.underline}
This inclusion of Indigenous organizations at various levels of Arctic
governance, unique to the Council, underscores the exceptional nature of
Arctic governance, [[allowing Indigenous]{.mark} political
[organizations to]{.mark} [engage]{.mark} directly in decision-making
processes [alongside]{.mark} national [governments]{.mark}]{.underline}.
However, the degree to which this inclusion translates into actual
decision-making power for Indigenous representatives remains a matter of
debate.17 Despite these challenges, **[[the Council's]{.mark} flexible
[structure offers]{.mark} a unique opportunity for [Indigenous agency
and self-determination within]{.mark} regional [governance]{.mark},
[highlighting]{.mark} the ongoing [negotiation between Indigenous rights
and state sovereignty in the Arctic.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### Creating a new working group [solves]{.underline} Indigenous input on infrastructure

Ann **Carr**, 20**19,** 6/27/2019, "Options for international policy to
promote cooperation in Arctic infrastructure", The Henry M. Jackson
School of International Studies,
https://jsis.washington.edu/news/options-for-international-policy-to-promote-cooperation-in-arctic-infrastructure/

Seeing as infrastructure is typically a domestic responsibility, I
[propose the creation of [a new **Indigenous peoples-centered
group**]{.mark} that will serve as a [platform for them to
advocate]{.mark} for their own [needs]{.mark}]{.underline} and to voice
their own concerns [[with regards to infrastructure and]{.mark}
sustainable [developmen]{.mark}t]{.underline}. [This group would serve
as [a way]{.mark} for Indigenous [to make **infrastructural
recommendations**]{.mark}. It would to be to the advantage of the states
to fund this venture because it would help lead to longer-lasting and
therefore more cost effective infrastructure that [better suits the
needs of the inhabitants]{.mark}, while [facilitat]{.mark}ing [better
local-to-government communication]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Current infrastructure is lacking. For example, there are currently no
roads to Nunavut, an entire territory. Additionally, there are no roads
between the 25 communities there. However, this fact is not due to a
lack of effort on the part of the Canadian government. The Nunavut
Department Economic Development and Transportation published a business
case from Nishi-Khon/SNC Lavalin Ltd outlining the costs and benefits of
an all-weather road connecting the two areas, formally recommending the
road. It is projected to help drive down living costs and lessen the
need for subsistence hunting by increasing food security. However, with
a projected cost of \$1.5 billion CAD and a timeline more than 20 years
until completion, due in part to the large distances between
communities, building this road is not going to happen in the near
future. This example highlights [how the geography of the Arctic shapes
the infrastructure needed and the importance of the voices of the people
who live there]{.underline}.

Two of the countries displaying their interest in the Arctic include the
Russian Federation, which is an Arctic state, and China, which is not an
Arctic state. Russia is currently trying to re-establish its dominance
as a world power and part of the attempt to do so is a major increase in
infrastructure spending. Despite the development leading to greater
access to rural areas and communities, the development has come with its
own set of issues. Paved roads accelerate permafrost thawing and are
susceptible to damage. The railroads are deformed by the thawing and
refreezing of the ground. Supply to the more remote communities is
severely limited by these limitations. This example highlights the need
for Indigenous input on infrastructure development that would benefit
them for a greater proportion of the year and last longer. Additionally,
China, which should be noted to not be an Arctic state or member of the
Arctic Council, has announced plans for an "Arctic Silk Road" that would
connect China with Europe and the Middle East via development of Arctic
shipping routes.

With the increase in global interest in Arctic development and a hefty
amount being spent and projected to be spent on Arctic infrastructure,
[a [policy]{.mark} and/[or organization needs to]{.mark} be put in place
to: [limit]{.mark} the [negative impacts of building on]{.mark} the
environment and [communities]{.mark}; ensure that the building is done
in a sustainable way that is flexible and can [withstand]{.mark} the
changing [climate, and; facilitate]{.mark} the [exchange of
info]{.mark}rmation [for]{.mark} more [resilient
infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline}. I propose that [[a non-domestic
governmental association]{.mark} **[that focuses on Indigenous
perspectives will help achieve those goals]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
[[**The Arctic Council**]{.mark} has [recognized the pressure climate
change has put on infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline}, as seen in their
Arctic Resilience Interim Report 2013.

Because of climate change, the Arctic infrastructure is in a difficult
place. With the melting of permafrost and sea ice cover declining by
25%-30%, infrastructure needs to be flexible and adaptable to the
fluctuating climate. Arctic States have built considerable
infrastructure, such as the Russian Trans-Siberian Railway, the Dalton
Highway in Alaska, and the E6 through Sweden and Norway. [However,
improvements with respect to Indigenous concerns can and should be
front-and-center.]{.underline} Canada is paying a lot of attention to
the Indigenous perspective, as seen in their Arctic Policy Framework,
and other countries should follow suit.

[[Development]{.mark} can be [beneficial for Indigenous
populations]{.mark}]{.underline} when governments do it in an
environmentally considerate and people respectful manner. [More
infrastructure [could]{.mark} help build a more resilient economy,
[increase]{.mark} global participation and [economic opportunities,
provide better living conditions and]{.mark} help [provide]{.mark} more
[sustainable energy]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, development
introduces a myriad of other problems. Some of these include
environmental degradation, lack of economic benefits, and a greater
access to the community.

Pre-Existing Policy

Most of the current policy is domestic and marine-based. There is
currently no international body with the specific goal of guiding Arctic
infrastructure development. [[The Arctic Council]{.mark} has a
[Sustainable Development Work Group]{.mark} (SDWG) that does, in
addition to its many other projects and activities, [contribute
to]{.mark} the discussion on [international infrastructure
development]{.mark}. Ho]{.underline}wever, only three of its current or
planned projects pertain to infrastructure. These projects include the
Arctic Renewable Energy Atlas project, the Arctic Remote Energy Networks
Academy project, and the Improving Health through Safe and Affordable
Access to Household Running Water and Sewer project. The SDWG's other
projects are very important and should be given the attention they
deserve. However, infrastructure is another issue that needs to be taken
care of. Further [[diversification of]{.mark} the duties of the
[SDWG]{.mark} might help [fill]{.mark} those [gaps]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In Russia, a lot of the infrastructure is in poor condition, with few
regulations in place to mitigate the environmental degradation that
current infrastructure and the building of new infrastructure is
causing. However, they are working to rectify that through policy and
regulation changes. In the Arctic, specifically, they have already begun
development, putting them ahead in terms of development compared to the
other Arctic states.

The Canadian government has a robust vision for the North that includes
healthy communities that can manage their affairs, an emphasis on
respect for the environment, sustainable development in all actions and
inter-agency governmental cooperation so as to result in a "vibrant,
prosperous future for all, and protection of the land through enhanced
presence on the land, sea, and skies." Additionally, Canada has more
than \$180 billion (CAD) allotted for investment in sustainable Arctic
energy and \$2 billion for rural and northern communities.

In the United States' Ten-Year Prioritization of Infrastructure Needs in
the Arctic, the government highlights the opening of Arctic waterways
that would allow for an increase in maritime activities. They state that
the projected increase in activity increases the need for improved
infrastructure, both physical and informational. In their plan, they
prioritize the building of port reception facilities, communications,
and weather, water, and climate predictions.

Policy Options

[[A New Arctic Council Working Group]{.underline}]{.mark}

One option to [create a group that will help [facilitate international
cooperation regarding infrastructure]{.mark} would to be to create a new
working group within the Arctic Council]{.underline}. Currently the
Sustainable Development Working Group (SDWG) covers matters relating to
infrastructure. Given the amount of money being spent to develop the
Arctic, we would be remiss if we did not [[help to **prevent
damage**]{.mark} that could be caused [by unchecked
development]{.mark}.]{.underline}

A benefit of this option is that the [[Arctic Council **already
exists**]{.mark}, and [the]{.mark} proposed [group would serve as
a]{.mark} natural [subdivision of the SDWG]{.mark}. The main
[focus]{.mark} of the group [would be]{.mark} the [synthesis of
information collected by the other working groups]{.mark}]{.underline},
particularly from the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme, the
Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna, the Arctic Contaminants Action
Program, the Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment, and the
Sustainable Development Working Group.

#### The Arctic Council is the best forum for Arctic Indigenous advocacy

**Saami Council**, 20**25**, a voluntary Saami organization that deals
with Saami policy tasks, 5/12/2025, "The Importance of the Arctic
Council for Indigenous Peoples", Arctic Council,
https://arctic-council.org/news/the-importance-of-the-arctic-council-for-indigenous-peoples/

[The category of [Permanent Participants]{.mark} is a unique model of
[including Indigenous Peoples in decision-making]{.mark}]{.underline}.
It was created to [[provide]{.mark} Arctic Indigenous Peoples with the
[means of **active participation and full consultation** in the
Council's deliberations]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Arctic Council is the
only international body that has accredited Indigenous Peoples this
status. In this article Permanent Participants reflect on the importance
of the Council for them -- and vice versa.

In general, the engagement by Arctic Indigenous Peoples in the Arctic
Council is guided by the understanding that healthy and productive
ecosystems, both on land and in marine environments, are fundamental to
the cultures, identities, and livelihoods of Arctic Indigenous Peoples.
These cultures rely on local food sources and traditional materials to
maintain health, safety, and well-being. Indigenous Knowledge has been
generated and passed down for generations, ensuring a balanced
relationship with the surroundings and the environment. However, climate
change, pollution, land use changes, and encroachments are altering
natural landscapes and threatening Indigenous ways of life. [[The Arctic
Council is important]{.mark}, as our [homelands and matters
related]{.mark} to these lands and waters [are on the]{.mark} Arctic
Council [agenda]{.mark}. The [Permanent Participants]{.mark} are at the
Arctic Council table to [address the challenges]{.mark} the Arctic
[Indigenous Peoples are facing and amplify]{.mark} the [voices of Arctic
Indigenous Peoples]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Since the first gathering of Arctic Indigenous Peoples in Copenhagen in
1973, cooperation among Indigenous Peoples across the circumpolar region
has evolved significantly. From early efforts to unify Indigenous
Peoples' voices in addressing shared concerns to achieving formal
recognition in international cooperation, the journey has been marked by
both challenges and accomplishments. At the heart of this progress is
the Arctic Council, an intergovernmental forum that has provided Arctic
Indigenous Peoples with a seat at the table to shape policies affecting
their lands, cultures, and ways of life.

The first Arctic Indigenous Peoples' meeting in 1973 laid the foundation
for organized cooperation among Indigenous Peoples across national
borders. The participants envisioned a collective body to advocate for
their rights and interests. Their declaration emphasized the need to
protect their lands, resources, and cultural heritage for future
generations.

\[Image Omitted\]

Indigenous Peoples' leaders at the time understood that environmental
protection and Indigenous self-determination were inseparable. This
realization would later shape the direction of Arctic cooperation,
culminating in Indigenous Peoples' participation in environmental and
geopolitical discussions on the global stage.

[The [Arctic Council]{.mark}]{.underline}, established in 1996, built on
the foundation of the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy [and
emerged as [the **most significant institutional recognition** of
Indigenous Peoples voices in Arctic governance]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Unlike other intergovernmental organizations, the Arctic Council
[includes Indigenous Peoples' Organizations as Permanent Participants,
granting them a stronger role]{.underline} than Observer States and
institutions. This unique structure allows Indigenous Peoples
representatives to influence policy recommendations directly, even if
they do not hold formal voting rights.

At its inception, the Arctic Council included three Permanent
Participants: the Inuit Circumpolar Council (ICC), the Saami Council,
and the Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North (RAIPON).
Soon after, the Aleut International Association (AIA), the Gwich'in
Council International (GCI), and the Arctic Athabaskan Council (AAC)
also joined, ensuring broader representation of Indigenous Peoples
across the Arctic region. If we hold hands, we cover the whole Arctic
Circle.

\[Image Omitted\]

[[The Arctic Council]{.mark} has become [an essential forum for
Indigenous Peoples advocacy]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[allowing Indigenous
knowledge to be utilized in]{.mark} scientific [research]{.mark},
environmental [protection efforts, and **sustainable development
initiatives**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As one Indigenous leader put it, the
presence of Permanent Participants ensures that the Arctic Council is
not solely focused on environmental concerns like polar bears but also
on the people who live and thrive in the Arctic.

During its Chairship of the Arctic Council from 2023 to 2025, Norway has
made efforts to restart Arctic cooperation following a pause in official
meetings of the Arctic Council initiated by seven Arctic States in
February 2022. By focusing on non-political but critical issues such as
wildfires, Norway has managed to keep the Council functioning.
Additionally, Norway has maintained dialogue with the Indigenous Peoples
Organisations, ensuring that all six Permanent Participants remain
engaged in discussions about the Council's future.

\[Image Omitted\]

[[As Indigenous Peoples]{.mark} continue to [navigate]{.mark} the
[challenges posed by climate change]{.mark}]{.underline}, resource
development, and geopolitical tensions, [[their voices must
remain]{.mark} at [the centre of Arctic governance]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The evolution of Indigenous cooperation in the Arctic, from the 1973
meeting in Copenhagen to their status as Permanent Participants in the
Arctic Council, highlights the resilience and determination of leaders
of Indigenous Peoples. [[The Arctic Council]{.mark} has [provided a
foundation]{.mark} [for]{.mark} this [engagement and remains a **crucial
platform**]{.mark} for advocating for Indigenous Peoples' rights,
environmental protection, and sustainable development,]{.underline} but
further steps are necessary to solidify their role. [By strengthening
Indigenous Peoples' representation, the [Arctic Council can]{.mark}
continue to [serve as a **model for inclusive and effective
governance**]{.mark} in the Arctic]{.underline} and beyond.

[[The Arctic region]{.underline}]{.mark} is [[becoming a theater for
competition]{.mark} between states]{.underline} over its resources and
geopolitical advantages. This [[is]{.mark} having a **[deeply
harmful]{.mark}** impact [on]{.mark} the [indigenous peoples of the
Arctic]{.mark}, whose way of life doesn't fit in with state
borders]{.underline}.

\[Image Omitted\]

The Russian attack on Ukraine has had major consequences thousands of
miles from the battlefields. [[Since Russia]{.mark} launched its
[invasion]{.mark} in 2022,]{.underline} [the state]{.underline} that
contains around half of the total landmass above the Arctic Circle has
been [effectively [excluded from]{.mark} the field of transnational
[Arctic cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Regardless of the merits of temporarily [cutting Russia
off]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[it is]{.mark} the Arctic's [indigenous
peoples]{.mark}]{.underline} --- with longer histories in the region
than the states within whose borders they now find themselves --- [[who
have suffered most from the decision and]{.mark} from the broader Arctic
[fallout of the conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}.

During that time, they have been recruited for war, seen connections
across state borders severed, and [suffered from a **["pause" of the
Arctic Council]{.mark}**, an international forum [where they had fought
for representation.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Artificial Borders

The indigenous peoples of the Arctic already faced marginalization
before the war. As Anders Oskal, secretary general of the Association of
World Reindeer Herders, said recently: "Those who are hit first and
hardest by sanctions are the ones who are last in line to begin with."

In 2021, Norway's Supreme Court ruled that a wind farm constructed in
Sámi territory was a violation of indigenous rights, yet the wind farm,
and its disruption to reindeer migration, remains. In the Russian
Arctic, the reindeer-herding Nenets people have found migratory routes
similarly disturbed by oil and gas infrastructure. Kiruna municipality,
in the Swedish heart of Sápmi, the Sámi homeland, is home to the largest
underground iron ore mine in the world, alongside plentiful deposits of
rare-earth elements necessary for the energy transition, which are being
eyed covetously by the Swedish state.

The indigenous peoples of the Arctic already faced marginalization
before Russia's war with Ukraine.

Eirik Larsen is the head of the human rights unit of the Sámi Council, a
nongovernmental organization that works across Sámi territory in Russia,
Finland, Norway, and Sweden. He says that projects like these have been
developed without our consent, and they have a severe impact on our
culture and our way of life. We don't oppose climate solutions. We are
actually asking for climate solutions, and we are asking to contribute
to finding solutions concerning our lands . . . in a way that harms the
natural and traditional areas, and true sustainable areas, as little as
possible.

However, [[with]{.mark} the potential for [**cross-border** solidarity
reduced as the Arctic Council's **network of cooperation** has weakened,
Sámi concerns]{.mark} are more [likely to]{.mark} become a domestic
matter, to [be brushed aside by their governments]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[The Arctic Council]{.underline}]{.mark} is an intergovernmental forum
for states to cooperate on Arctic issues. It [has long been
[unique]{.mark} among major international organizations [in that it
reserves places for indigenous groups]{.mark}]{.underline}, six of
which, representing around 10 percent of the Arctic's total population,
hold the status of permanent participants in the council. While they
cannot vote on resolutions, [[they have secured a **greater voice** in
this international forum than in]{.mark} the domestic affairs of [the
states]{.mark} in which [they reside]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Since]{.mark} 2022, however, [the council's functions]{.mark} have
been [paused]{.mark}, and [indigenous groups]{.mark} have watched
[borders close]{.mark} once more, [separating families and splitting
traditional hunting grounds]{.mark}]{.underline} in a manner not seen
since the Cold War. The ways of life of the Arctic's indigenous peoples
have suffered from their encounters with modern interstate borders,
especially when one of the states goes to war.

In Northern Europe, several Sámi people formerly living in Russia have
been forced to claim asylum in neighboring countries in order to avoid
conscription. Eirik Larsen argues that the need to claim asylum at all
is unjust:

Our main position is that [if you are a Sámi, you should be able to
consider the whole Sámi territory as a home despite crossing
borders]{.underline}. We are used to cross\[ing\] the border all the
time and to maneuver\[ing\] around it.

#### The Arctic Council solves indigenous input on environmental issues\-\--it creates a model for intra-indigenous cooperation and action.

The AC also provides a mechanism for indigenous cooperation, just like
the plan

From 1996 to 1998, the [AEPS was merged into the Canadian initiative of
the **A**rctic **C**ouncil]{.underline}, which still operated in a very
similar manner to the AEPS.\" The only clear departure from the AEPS was
that [the region\'s [indigenous peoples\' received an unprecedented
status in **intergovernmental cooperation**]{.mark}, changing from
observer to permanent participant. [This change required that the Arctic
states consult indigenous populations **before** making
decisions]{.mark}.]{.underline}12 They participate in all the activities
of the Arctic Council, including sitting at the same table with
ministers during ministerial meet ings. [[Participation in the
**A**]{.mark}rctic **[C]{.mark}**ouncil [has also strengthened
**cooperation**]{.mark} and **networking** [between indigenous]{.mark}
peoples\' [associations, resulting in an ability to act as a **coherent
group**]{.mark} in indigenous **international forums**]{.underline} on
many occasions.

The fundamentals of Arctic cooperation have largely remained the same
lately, but larger changes have taken place only very recently. States
have avoided agreeing to any comprehensive international Arctic treaty
to govern their cooperation, which they affirmed with the Arctic Ocean
coastal state-issued 2008 Ilulissat Declaration, and have opted for
flexible soft law cooperation in the AEPS and the Arctic Council through
declarations.13 Not even with the 1996 founding of the Arctic Council
were states willing to commit to any stable funding mechanism for their
cooperation. They were also not ready to establish a permanent
secretariat, so the secretariat functions were managed by the respective
chair state. This low level of financial commitment by member states to
Arctic Council work was further criticized by scientific studies that
identified vast re gional challenges, such as responding to incoming
economic activities when sea ice disappears.14 For this reason, and only
very recently, changes have started to take place, most of which
culminated with the May 2011 ministerial meeting of the Arctic Council,
which decided to establish a permanent secretariat for the Council and
adopt the first ever legally binding agreement on search and rescue
negotiated under the Council\'s auspices.

Science as the Main \"Reality-Builder\"

The main effort in Arctic cooperation has been invested in producing
scientific synthesis reports on the chief pollution problems known to be
damaging the vulnerable Arctic environment and its ecosystems. The
strongest of the working groups, the AMAP, produced its first overall
popularized synthesis report in 1997, reporting on various problems
haunting the region and highlighting the long-range migration of
pollutants to the region from southerly latitudes.15

During the U.S. chair period from 1998 to 2000, the Arctic Climate
Impact Assessment (ACIA) commenced. Its dramatic findings were released
in a popular format in 2004. Even though the 2001 Report of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had already noted that
warming tends to be more intense in the Arctic, it was crucially the
Arctic Council-sponsored ACIA that established the Arctic as an
early-warning region of climate change.16 Warming there was demonstrated
by ACIA to be increasing at twice the rate as compared to the rest of
the world.17

In addition to revealing serious impacts to the Arctic environment---its
ecosystems and human communities---[the ACIA changed the way **regional
stakeholders** and others perceive the region]{.underline}. The AEPS
still conveyed the image of the Arctic as an inaccessible, inhospitable,
frozen desert, whereas the ACIA findings demonstrated that the Arctic is
a region undergoing a dramatic trans formation. The change in the way we
perceive the Arctic could not have been more dramatic. Our understanding
developed from a conception of the Arctic as being protected by its
hostile environment to being a dynamically changing region with major
economic possibilities, thus requiring stricter governance measures.
[The ACIA was followed by other major Arctic Council assessments of
**oil and gas** activities, **increased shipping** in the region, and
the effects of **climate change** on biodiversity]{.underline}.18

Tackling Outside Environmental Problems

From the beginning of Arctic cooperation, the AMAP working group was
especially engaged in studying the extent to which heavy metals and
persistent organic pollutants migrate into the Arctic. The AMAP had
already concluded in the mid-1990s that the Arctic served and continued
to serve as a waste disposal place for persistent organic pollutants.
These pollutants are produced in mid-latitudes and gradually migrate
their way to the Arctic by prevailing wind patterns and ocean currents.
In the cold, the persistent organic pollutants condense, fall to the
surface, and can no longer evaporate.

It would seem difficult for the Arctic Council to tackle such problems
given that the pollutants originate from outside the region and require
larger regional and global governance efforts to be solved. [Due to
their status as **permanent participants**, [the region\'s indigenous
peoples were able to present data that demonstrated the threat to their
**health**]{.mark} and **well-being**]{.underline}.19 For instance,
levels of PCBs, a persistent organic pollutant, in pregnant Inuit women
were much higher than the national averages due to the fact that
[**persistent organic pollutants** ended up in fatty tissues of large
predator animals that form the **staple diet** for many indigenous
peoples]{.underline}. With a concerted strategy, Arctic Council actors
were able to play a part both in regional negotiations leading up to the
adoption of the persistent organic pollutant protocol to the long-range
transboundary air pollution convention and in global environmental
governance.

[With sound science sponsored by the Arctic Council\'s **AMAP** working
group, [indigenous peoples could show how]{.mark} persistent organic
[pollutants are deleterious to human health]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
immediate and long term. [Indigenous peoples\'
**[organizations]{.mark}** also [were able to convey their views better
because]{.mark} the Arctic Council [**member states** allowed them to
take part in]{.mark} their delegations during the
**[negotiations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. With this strategy, the Arctic
Council could act as a united front in global persistent organic
pollutant negotiations.20 This strategy also made its way into the
preamble of the Stockholm Convention, which stated the importance of
\"acknowledging that the Arctic ecosystems and indigenous communities
are particularly at risk because of the biomagnification of persistent
organic pollutants and that contamination of their traditional foods is
a public health issue.\"21 Hence, with this strategy, the Arctic Council
actors were able to provide strong input to an overall strategy to
eliminate persistent organic pollutants that not only protects the
Arctic environment but also develops conservation at regional and global
levels.

Even if there were not a similar concerted strategy from Arctic Council
actors against climate change, to some extent the first international
litigation against climate change originated from the work of the Arctic
Council. The Arctic Council\'s [**[ACIA]{.mark}** working group
[involved]{.mark} not only **western science** and scientists, but also
[**indigenous experts** in traditional ecological
knowledge]{.mark}]{.underline}. This partnership was largely due to its
inclusion of the regions indigenous peoples as permanent participants.

The ACIA also contains a separate chapter on the [[**damaging impacts**
of climate change]{.mark} on the **traditional livelihoods** of Arctic
indigenous peoples. This information [partly catalyzed one of the
permanent participants of the **A**rctic **C**ouncil, the
**I**]{.mark}nuit **[C]{.mark}**ircumpolar **[C]{.mark}**ouncil (ICC),
[to file a claim against the United States in the
**I**]{.mark}nter-**[A]{.mark}**merican **[C]{.mark}**ommission on
**[H]{.mark}**uman **[R]{.mark}**ights in 2005]{.underline}. The Inuit
complained that climate change would infringe on many of their human
rights, including their right to enjoy their culture, which is strongly
connected to their now rapidly deteriorating environment. The petition
suggested that by any standards, the United States could be identified
as one of the main culprits of climate change. Thus, [even if [the
petition]{.mark} were unsuccessful, it [would **catalyze** the
discussion on]{.mark} whether international society should view [climate
change as a **human rights issue**]{.mark}, as well as consolidate the
view of the Arctic as a **victim** of climate change]{.underline}.

#### The Arctic Council is key to indigenous rights

**Sellheim et al. 19** \[Nikolas; Yulia V. Zaika; Ilan Kelman; 14 March,
2019; Nikolas Sellheim Dr Sellheim has extensively published on
international conservation law and Arctic governance. Dr Sellheim holds
a doctorate in law (2016) from the University of Lapland in Rovaniemi,
Finland, in which he focused on the European Union's ban on trade in

The above demonstrates that [[even though]{.mark} the [Arctic states
face significant domestic challenges as regards the recognition and
implementation of indigenous rights, these are not reflected in the
working structures of the AC.]{.mark}]{.underline}  Even though strictly
legal issues, such as the recognition of the Thule Tribe or the Inuit
and Athabaskan petitions, or domestic legal and managerial issues, such
as housing, employment, or land rights, are not explicitly touched upon,
[[the AC puts great emphasis on equal participatory rights of indigenous
peoples]{.mark}. [This right to participation]{.mark} and with it the
right to free, prior and informed consent [is a key triumph the AC has
established]{.mark}. Indeed, [the Council also advertises this
participation in other fora]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g. AC 2001b)
although concrete human rights-related language is absent in its work.
Instead, the United Nations' sustainable development goals are advanced,
which essentially address human rights as well albeit in political
commitment rather than legal language. Notwithstanding, [participation
is the most important issue concerning the advancement and promotion of
indigenous rights. Moreover, [the AC advances the normative and legal
discourse on health]{.mark} in northern and indigenous communities[;
traditional land use]{.mark} and livelihoods; [cultural
protection]{.mark}; indigenous [languages]{.mark}; [education; and
socio-economic development]{.mark}.]{.underline} Although
decision-making in the AC is still conducted by the nation states and is
thus rightfully being criticised within postcolonial discourses (e.g.
Lindroth and Sinevaara-Niskanen 2018), [[it]{.underline}]{.mark}
nevertheless [[has incorporated and normatively advanced the discourse
on indigenous rights,]{.mark} particularly bearing in mind the
increasing number of observers to the AC.]{.underline} One Arctic
example for this increasing recognition of indigenous peoples also
within other contexts is the project Bridging Early Career Researchers
and Indigenous Peoples in Nordic Regions, carried out by the Association
of Polar Early Career Scientists (APECS) between 2013 and 2015 (APECS
2015). Indeed, [if strengthening the rights of indigenous peoples
through supporting projects and political participation work in the
Arctic, why would it not work elsewhere]{.underline}?

#### Indigenous cooperation is especially facilitated by the nature of the Arctic Council.

[[The Arctic Council is **critically important**
for]{.underline}]{.mark} the space it creates for [[Indigenous
perspectives]{.underline}]{.mark}, and leadership on issues like
wildfire response in the Arctic. GCI's projects create international
space for cooperation and awareness on critical issues like the climate
driving impacts of wildland fire in the Arctic and subarctic regions.
The CAFF project, Arctic Fire, hopes to expand our understanding of
wildland fire ecology in the Arctic, [[exploring]{.mark} [Indigenous
knowledge]{.mark} on the topic, [and creating space
]{.mark}]{.underline}for experts around the circumpolar north
[[to]{.mark} [discuss]{.mark} these timely [issues]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The GCI project at EPPR, Circumpolar Fire, evaluates the legal
frameworks of current wildfire cooperation between Arctic States and has
proposed that new areas of cooperation and agreements may be warranted
in the current climate of Arctic wildland fire. Naturally, these are
only a couple of the examples of the many important projects Arctic
Indigenous Peoples are engaged in at the Arctic Council.

[The Indigenous groups also in many cases represent peoples who live in
different countries]{.underline}. The Gwich'in communities are located
in both Canada and in the United States. [Thus, [the **perspective**
of]{.mark} Indigenous [groups can be broader]{.mark} [than]{.mark} found
in [a single nation]{.mark}, and can point to new areas of
[needed]{.mark} bilateral **[cooperation]{.mark}** between neighboring
states that [can]{.mark} sometimes [be forgotten]{.mark} in southern
capitals.]{.underline} For example, the [[Indigenous]{.mark}
[groups]{.mark} have [led efforts to focus]{.mark} on [the importance of
removing obstacles]{.mark} to travel across borders where families of
particular tribes or groups live in different countries.]{.underline}
Only recently, President Biden and Premier Trudeau recognized the need
to improve conditions for visa-free travel between the United States and
Canada to aid contacts between these families, and it was Indigenous
groups who have pressed for this over many years. The complex nature of
the Jay Treaty and Canadian immigration policy as they affect Indigenous
Peoples are bound by a particular reality: these are one people, one
language, families, who have lived and governed their own areas for tens
of thousands of years, who have been separated by relatively recently
established borders, and they have the right to continue their
relationships.

The Indigenous are close to the land and nature and have a direct
understanding of what is going on in the Arctic, especially
environmental change which is at the heart of the issues the Council
cares about. Whether it is intricate changes to sea ice, plant, animal,
insect life, or ecosystem-wide rapid changes like wildfire, the
Indigenous peoples are vested stakeholders in the Arctic who are keen
and longtime observers of the region, and their knowledge is integral in
getting things right for the Arctic.

[[The]{.mark} history of the [Council]{.mark} has [demonstrated its
value]{.mark} as a forum that **[fosters communication]{.mark} [between
Indigenous groups and]{.mark} the central [governments]{.mark} of the
states**.]{.underline} For various reasons, relationships between the
Indigenous and ministries of governments, as well as domestic political
processes, can be difficult. At times, the Permanent Participants can
reach capitals through statements in the Council when other channels are
not successful. [On [the]{.mark} margins of Arctic [Council]{.mark}
ministerial [meetings]{.mark}, U.S. Secretaries of [State]{.mark} have
[taken]{.mark} the [time to have]{.mark} separate [meetings with]{.mark}
U.S. [Indigenous leaders]{.mark}.]{.underline} In that respect, it
appeared that groups representing Indigenous peoples living in the
United States had more successful access to the U.S. Secretary of State
than when they reach out to senior Alaskan state government officials.

#### Increased [council]{.underline} activity's key to Indigenous [sovereignty]{.underline}.

The [[need]{.mark} for **[increased council
activity]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Norway's chairship in 2023-2025 has managed to balance the situation and
keep the council alive by gradually ramping up its activities. For the
Danish, Greenlandic and Faroese chairship to be a success, it would be
wise to continue on the same path with steadily increasing activity to
ensure that the council's pulse continues to beat. However, the fact
that the [[threat now]{.mark} both comes [from]{.mark} the [east
and]{.mark} the [west]{.mark} makes the balancing act **historically
difficult**.]{.underline}

One opportunity for increasing activity is to further [[enhance]{.mark}
the [focus on]{.mark} the rights of **[Indigenous peoples]{.mark}** in
the Arctic]{.underline} -- which the new chairship program, indeed,
prioritizes -- in order to [[strengthen regional cooperation
without]{.mark}]{.underline} necessarily having to compromise on
[[condemning Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}. If the situation allows,
something as ambitious as a binding agreement on [increased protection
of Indigenous peoples' rights]{.underline} in the Arctic would be [worth
striving for]{.underline}, similar to the council's three existing
agreements on aeronautical and maritime search and rescue (2011), marine
oil pollution preparedness and response (2013), and enhancing
international Arctic scientific cooperation (2017).

Traditional security concerns have also undermined some of the advances
by Arctic Indigenous Peoples in regional arrangements such as the Arctic
Council. Established in 1996, the purpose of [the [Arctic
Council]{.mark} is to [provide]{.mark} a means for promoting
[cooperation]{.mark}, coordination and interaction [among Arctic
states]{.mark}, [with]{.mark} the full participation of Arctic
[Indigenous Peoples]{.mark}]{.underline}.51 It is made up of eight
member states and six organizations representing Arctic Indigenous
Peoples'. [[The Arctic Council is unique because it]{.mark} has always
made decisions based on consensus, which [grants its Indigenous
participants significant]{.mark} informal [power]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Moreover, given the regularly changing governments within the state
apparatus, the Indigenous participants make up the Arctic Council's
institutional memory. When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, seven of the
eight Arctic states paused the Arctic Council's proceedings, and there
was some concern that the Arctic Council might no longer function, which
would eschew Arctic Indigenous Peoples' meaningful participation in
regional governance. [[The Inuit Circumpolar Council and]{.mark} the
[Saami Council]{.mark} each [represent peoples on the Russian
side]{.mark} of their homelands too, [and]{.mark} [are accustomed to
navigating tense East-West cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
situation was partly resolved in May 2023 when Arctic Council, in
accordance with its rules of procedure, held its biennial meeting and
facilitated the transfer of its chairmanship from Russia to Norway.52
[[It]{.mark} nevertheless [illustrates]{.mark} the importance of
regional arrangements for Arctic Indigenous Peoples' inclusion in
processes which affect them, their value when they are included, and at
the same time [their continued **susceptibility to the unilateral
decision-making of states**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Although, [Nordic states have stood at the forefront of international
advocacy for the rights of Indigenous Peoples in multilateral
fora]{.underline}, their commitment to the implementation of those norms
abroad often contrasts with their implementation of them at home.
[[Arctic Indigenous Peoples]{.mark} have [sought to address the
shortcomings in human rights]{.mark} implementation [through their own
self-governance arrangements]{.mark} [and]{.mark} associated
[NGOS]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[It is]{.mark} [challenging]{.mark}
work]{.underline}, particularly when undertaken in the context of a lack
of adequate resources, the cultural domination of settler states, and
[[when it must be performed]{.mark} by people who are already spread
thin **[across multiple roles and legal systems]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
For Inuit and Sámi, regular re-configuration to fit the remit of a
state-based system of international law is both par for the course and
immensely challenging. For instance, in relation to enhanced
participation in the UN system, Inuit are yet to determine which
institution(s) constitute a representative body for them. Nor do Inuit
have a collaborative parliamentary body across the national territorial
boundaries akin to the Sámi Parliamentary Council, and neither Sámi nor
Inuit can currently engage fully with their Russian counterparts. The
recognition of Indigenous Peoples' interconnected and indivisible rights
have been achieved in the UN Declaration. However, the [[nation-state
model]{.mark} of the existing world order [must]{.mark} continue to
[evolve]{.mark} progressively, [in line with Indigenous Peoples']{.mark}
direct, full and effective [participation across the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### S \-\-- Security Co-operation

#### The [exclusion]{.underline} of Russia from NATO military [communications]{.underline} structurally [incentivizes]{.underline} escalation---arctic council [reform]{.underline} solves.

Escalation\", University of Denver Digital Commons,

yc

One of the most dangerous factors in the [[increasing
**misinterpretation**]{.mark} and fear that [drive the **security
dilemma**]{.mark} is a [**lack** of reliable]{.mark}, transparent
**[communication]{.mark}**]{.underline} between the relevant states
(Jervis 1976). One reason for this is that as states acquire new
weaponry, other states tend to automatically assume the act as a
precursor to aggression and to act accordingly themselves, often
purchasing more weapons and being perceived as aggressive in turn,
playing into a spiral of escalation. As Jervis put it, [states
"frequently assume... that the arms of others indicate aggressive
intentions]{.underline}. So an increase in the other's military forces
makes the state doubly insecure... because this behavior is taken to
show that the other is not only a potential threat but is [actively
contemplating hostile actions,"]{.underline} (Jervis 1976, 68).
[[Transparency of military actions]{.mark} and motivations is the [only
way to stop the **spiral**]{.mark} in its tracks.
[Misinterp]{.mark}retation]{.underline} about motivations [can be
[**corrected** by a reliable and strong flow of **information**]{.mark}
from the state about its true intentions]{.underline} (Jervis 1976,
308). Unfortunately, this open communication does not exist in the
Arctic, particularly between Russia and the other Arctic states, where
the dynamics of the security dilemma are most strongly at play

[The [majority of interstate **communication** about Arctic
security]{.mark} and military matters happens [through
**NATO**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which [[Russia]{.mark} is not only not a
part of but [views as its enemy]{.mark}.]{.underline} Individually,
almost [[all of the Arctic states refuse to cooperate or communicate
openly with Russia]{.mark} about Arctic **military**
matters.]{.underline} In its 2024 Arctic Strategy, Canada made this
explicitly clear, dedicating an entire section to Russian aggression and
saying that "Bilateral cooperation between Canada and Russia, including
in the Arctic, will remain exceedingly difficult for the foreseeable
future... with Arctic allies, Canada will defend NATO's northern regions
and approaches... Canada will maintain its policy of limited engagement
with Russia officials. It is for Russia to create the conditions that
will enable a return to political engagement and cooperation,"
(Government of Canada 2024, 30). And this view of excluding Russia from
communication is shared by many other Arctic states, notably including
the United States. Norway is the only Arctic state that has gone against
this practice, arguing in its 2017 Strategy that it needs to communicate
with Russia in order to prevent escalation (Norwegian Ministry of
Foreign Affairs 2017, 18). As a result, it has been celebrated by
scholars for making valuable progress in preventing a security dilemma
induced conflict (Folland 2022; Knutsen and Pettersen 2024).

[A reliable [forum of communication]{.mark} about military matters that
**involves** all of the Arctic **states** [needs to be
established]{.mark}]{.underline} because "largely peaceful relations in
the High North have been endangered by growing military competition
between Russia and Western Arctic powers. [The [**lack** of military to
military dialogue]{.mark} between Russia and the West has
[**exacerbated** the situation]{.mark},"]{.underline} (Wither 2021). The
Arctic states are already contesting the management and ownership of the
routes, and a lack of transparency about motives, borders, and ship
movements will only increase the likelihood that miscommunication leads
to escalation on the seas as the route opens and ship traffic increases
(Lackenbauer and Lalonde 2019, 96). Because of this risk, "Despite
reservations, constructive dialogue is urgently needed to build trust,
create greater transparency and establish working relationships before
the most difficult regional security issues worsen an already
threatening security dilemma. These challenges include the deployment of
new offensive weapon systems, the disputed status of the Northern Sea
Route and increasing open water in the central Arctic Ocean which would
allow the deployment of naval surface ships for the first time," (Wither
2021). These challenges and the fallout that would come from a conflict
in the Arctic cannot be underestimated. China, Russia, and the US would
all likely be involved. It is urgently important that the Arctic states
take proactive action in preventing security dilemma induced conflict.

Given the information about the Arctic states' individual goals as
stated in their Arctic Strategies and what is required for the region to
avoid a security dilemma, this study offers two recommendations that
fulfill both of those criteria. They focus on reforming the Arctic
Council, specifically by including military issues in its purview and
shifting discussion of Arctic security from NATO to the Council; and on
cementing the governance of the NSR by allowing Canada and Russia to
govern their respective territorial passages as international straits.
Both of these recommendations would open up the avenue of communication
that the region needs and prepare it to collectively deal with the
opening of the NSR in a way that includes all actors and builds the
trust that is required. 5. Recommendations Arctic Council Reform The
Arctic Council was formed in 1996 with the signing of the Ottawa
Declaration by the eight Arctic states. The Council primarily focuses on
issues related to the environment, research, and, as of 2011, SAR, with
its activities divided into six working groups: the Arctic Contaminants
Action Program (ACAP); the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme
(AMAP); Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF); Emergency
Prevention, Preparedness and Response (EPPR); Protection of the Arctic
Marine Environment (PAME); and the Sustainable Development Working Group
(SDWG) (Arctic Council, n.d.). The Ottawa Declaration is the governing
document of the council and states that its mission is to "provide a
means for promoting cooperation, coordination and interaction among the
Arctic States... on common Arctic issues," although it adds a footnote
to that statement that "The Arctic Council should not deal with matters
related to military security," (Arctic Council 1996, 1). To date, the
Council has abided by that rule, albeit with some ventures into soft
security issues (Greaves and Pomerants 2017), specifically the
coordination involved with SAR.

NATO's Role

[[The Arctic **Council** is the main **IGO**]{.mark} in the Arctic, but
given that it [**cannot discuss security** issues]{.mark}, the topic is
often discussed within other IGOs]{.underline} where the Arctic states
are members due to the need to collaborate. [[**NATO** is the primary
IGO]{.mark} where this happens]{.underline}, but the fact that
[[**Russia**,]{.mark} the largest Arctic state, is [not a part of
**NATO**]{.mark} means that any discussions of Arctic security there are
**non comprehensive**]{.underline} and, far from increasing transparency
and communication, [[only **increase** the likelihood of
misinterpretation and **escalation**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[There [can be no true military **transparency** or complete
cooperation]{.mark} in the Arctic [when one of the Arctic **states** is
**excluded**]{.mark} from discussions]{.underline}, which is the case
now because of the inability of the Arctic Council to discuss military
issues. As a result of that inability, "Military security cooperation
among most Arctic states has thus principally occurred through the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The significant exception to this
is Russia, as NATO was founded to deter the Soviet Union and protect its
members -- of which five possess Arctic territory -- against the
prospect of Soviet/Russian aggression," (Greaves and Pomerants 2017,
36). [Arctic military issues being discussed in NATO is thus inherently
going to exclude Russia]{.underline} and [send a signal to them of
aggression]{.underline}, or at the least of a lack of interest in
cooperation. NATO's involvement in the Arctic and [[**Russia**'s
resulting **interp**retation]{.mark} of Western **aggression**
[increases the potential for escalation]{.mark}, possibly under a
**[security]{.mark}** **[dilemma]{.mark}**;]{.underline} "an Arctic
security dilemma could still arise, especially for Russia. With the
other Arctic Ocean states all being NATO members, it is easy for Russia
to see itself in a situation of four-against-one... As Canadian
lieutenant colonel Todd L. Sharp has said, 'a more direct role \[for
NATO\] in Arctic security will be met with Russian resistance and will
serve to further destabilize the region rather than contribute to
greater security.'" (Byers and Covey 2019). Despite this, without the
Arctic Council as an inclusive forum for discussing Arctic security
matters, NATO continues to be the place where those discussions happen.
At the 2024 Arctic Circle Assembly, an annual meeting of individuals,
not states, interested in the wellbeing of the Arctic, Admiral Rob
Bauer, the chair of the [**NATO** Military Committee, gave a **speech**
about military security in the region despite the fact that **military**
issues are not typically discussed at the assembly]{.underline}. He
focused on NATO's commitment to countering Russian and Chinese military
build up, saying that "In September, Russia conducted a major naval and
air exercise in the Arctic Ocean called 'Ocean 24' and reportedly
deployed two nuclear submarines under the Arctic polar icecap. We are
also increasingly witnessing cooperation between Russia and China in
this region. This cooperation has a clear military aspect to it. China
joined Russia in the 'Ocean 24' exercise. And at the start of this
month, China's Coast Guard vessels entered the Arctic Ocean for the
first time, patrolling the waters jointly with Russian ships," (Bauer
2024). Later in the speech, he stated that NATO responded by having
"doubled the number of ships patrolling the North and the Baltic Seas;
stepped up intelligence sharing; and conducted a series of protective
military activities through the Joint Expeditionary Force," (2024). He
made it clear that in while September 2024 "Russian Foreign Minister
Sergei Lavrov vowed that Moscow would defend its interests in the Arctic
both in diplomatic and military terms... NATO will also defend its
interests in this region," (2024). [This **spiral** of **escalation**
and increasing **militarization** is unsustainable and
dangerous]{.underline}, and [NATO being involved is only making the
matter **worse**]{.underline}. NATO's involvement in the Arctic is,
without a doubt, making Russia respond more and more aggressively in the
region out of a perceived threat by NATO. This is in no one's best
interest, as "Although Russia still articulates the Arctic as a unique
cooperative region, [there]{.underline} [may be [little space left for
non-**conflictual** Russian **action**]{.mark} when encountering NATO in
the Arctic]{.underline}," (Wilhelmsen and Hermann 2022, 114).

For the spiral of escalation in the Arctic to stop, [[**NATO** must hand
over the status of]{.mark} the main forum for Arctic [military
**cooperation** to the Arctic Council]{.mark}]{.underline} so that all
of the Arctic states can cooperate. NATO would still maintain its policy
of defending all of its member states, but [[**Russia** would feel far
less **antagonized**]{.mark} in the region to make such a move
**necessary**.]{.underline}

Why [the Council Should Consider Security]{.underline}

[The Arctic [Council serves as the primary governing body]{.mark} and
[forum of cooperatio]{.mark}n]{.underline} in the Arctic, which makes it
incredibly important to the peace, stability, and operations of the
region.

A... special feature of the Arctic is that the region has no single
treaty regime regulating its management, like the Antarctic Treaty
System: and all the front-rank players (i.e. the Arctic states...) are
determined that it should not have one. Instead, the environmental,
scientific, human, and many functional aspects of the regional agenda
are covered by the work of the Arctic Council, which can be seen as
acting as an emerging international Arctic regime. (Heininen 2012, 12)

It is especially unlikely that the Council will be supplanted as the
primary Arctic IGO, or the heart of Arctic governance, given the
political tensions between key Arctic states that would make forming
another organization with all of the Arctic states as members nearly
impossible to accomplish. But despite its importance to the governance
of the Arctic, it does not cover any issues related to security or the
military. In its 2021 Arctic Strategy, the Council said that it would
"Strengthen the Arctic Council as the pre-eminent high-level circumpolar
forum for effective coordination and cooperation, and enhance its
ability to efficiently respond to emerging challenges and opportunities
in the Arctic," (2021, 22). And yet that strategy did not even mention
the words "security", "military", "defense", "offense",
"militarization", "weapon", or any topics related to them. [The [Council
**cannot** "efficiently **respond** to emerging challenges... in the
Arctic]{.mark},"]{.underline} (Arctic Council 2021, 22) [[**without**
addressing]{.underline}]{.mark} one of the biggest issues that has
arisen there in recent years: [[**security** and **stability**]{.mark}
amid increasing militarization and tensions in the region.]{.underline}
[This needs to change, as open communication is vital to preventing
escalation, misinterpretation, and miscalculation]{.underline} amid
growing tensions and militarization that have the potential to lead to a
security dilemma (Glaser 1997; Lackenbauer and Lalonde 2019; Jervis
2001).

[Clear and transparent communication of strategic intentions is critical
to ensure that countries like Russia and Canada do not unwittingly
provoke a security dilemma or get caught up in an Arctic arms
race]{.underline} -- something that... can be moderated by clarifying
how military investments and activities are consistent with State
sovereignty, deterrence, and regional safety and stability. (Lackenbauer
and Lalonde 2019, 99) The [[Arctic **Council**]{.mark} can and [should
act as that **forum** for states]{.mark} to be able [to safely and
transparently **communicate**]{.mark} their security plans]{.underline}
and work together to avoid misinterpretation of motives. It is also
important for the Council to be able to discuss security matters amid
the growing need to establish governance in the NSR, as "The eventual
determination of Russia's and Canada's extended continental shelf in the
Arctic will... necessarily involve negotiations between all the
concerned parties. For this reason, [it is [imperative that lines of
**communication** remain open]{.mark},"]{.underline} (Lackenbauer and
Lalonde 2019, 96) and [[amid political **tensions**]{.mark} between
Russia and the other Arctic states [due to the war in
**Ukraine**]{.mark}, the [Council is one of the only lines of
**communication**]{.mark} that is open and [could be
used]{.mark}]{.underline} for discussion.

Some [[**Arctic** states]{.mark} have [voiced support for **including**
**security** matters in the Council]{.mark}]{.underline}. In its 2021
Arctic Strategy, **[[Iceland]{.underline}]{.mark}** said that "The
Declaration on the Establishment of the Arctic Council clearly provides
that the Council shall not discuss military security matters, but it may
be asserted that solid and constructive cooperation in that area is
likely to reduce tensions," (The Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Iceland
2021, 22). And in a 2017 ministerial meeting of the Council,
[[**Russian** foreign minister]{.mark} Sergey [Lavrov implied]{.mark}
that the [country would be open to discussing security matters in the
Council]{.mark}]{.underline} because meetings among the Arctic states
about the region's security have been "very useful for building trust
and mutual understanding," in the past (Lavrov 2017). Now,
[[given]{.underline}]{.mark} the context of [[Russia's dissatisfaction
with its exclusion from Arctic military discussions]{.underline}]{.mark}
and exercises within NATO and its [[stated]{.mark} [desire **for** more
**communication**]{.mark} with the other Arctic states]{.underline}
about those issues it would likely [maintain the same support for
allowing the discussion of security in the Council]{.underline}
(Wilhelmsen and Hjermann 2022, 130). And the stipulation was initially
included in the declaration only because the US insisted that it be
(Greaves and Pomerants 2017, 36). But that was 29 years ago, and [[**no
other states** had an **objection** to discussing security
matters]{.underline}]{.mark} at the time.

[The Council has, in reality, [already started branching into the
discussion of **security**]{.mark} through [soft security topics such as
SAR]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Council has [been officially involved in
Arctic SAR since 2011]{.underline} with the signing of the Agreement on
Cooperation on Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue in the
Arctic, and now has the specifically SAR dedicated working group EPPR
(Arctic Council, n.d.). [SAR is tangentially [**related** to **military
security**]{.mark} because it "[**necessitates** the **coordination**
of]{.mark} the [states']{.mark} [military]{.mark}, coast guard, police,
and transport services]{.underline} for rescue purposes," (Greaves and
Pomerants 2017, 36). This expansion into soft security matters means
that "[hard security may be entering into the agenda by
stealth]{.underline}," and that "such practices in the 'soft security'
sphere may help to erode the practical effect of the Ottawa
Declaration's prohibition of 'hard security' discussions from the
Council," (2017, 36). Thus moving to discuss security matters in the
Council really would [not be that much of a difficult move.]{.underline}

[The **Council** certainly [has the]{.mark} logistical [capability to
**include** **security matters**]{.mark} in its purview.]{.underline}
"Theoretically, the Council could be an audience for securitizing moves
brought by its Member States or Permanent Participants; or the Council,
particularly through its Working Groups, could play the role of
securitizing actor identifying issues of concern for the Arctic region
and [communicating these to the Member States and Permanent Participants
for their acceptance]{.underline}," (Greaves and Pomerants 2017, 37).
More specifically, [the Council could serve as a [**forum** for]{.mark}
discussion for [states to present]{.mark} their [security plans]{.mark}
and communicate about their intentions,]{.underline} goals, and fears to
[[reduce the risk of misinterp]{.mark}retation [and
miscalculation]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The Council could also add
a [[**seventh** **working** **group** dedicated to military
security]{.mark}, as it has done for other emerging issues in the
past]{.underline}, such as the [**EPPR** for SAR in 2011]{.underline}
and the [**ACAP** for pollution in 2006]{.underline}. It could also hold
additional annual meetings dedicated to security to avoid other Council
meetings having to reduce the attention paid to other issues. There are
clearly ways that the Council could address security issues, and there
is momentum for it to be done. The Arctic states need to acknowledge the
advantages in doing so and push for an amendment to the Ottawa
Declaration.

#### Russia [supports]{.underline} Arctic security discussions---that [de-escalates]{.underline} conflict.

University of Calgary, 2024, A Menu of Arctic Specific Confidence
Building and Arms Control Measures, Arctic Yearbook 2024\] yc

The main objective of [[mil]{.mark}itary-[to-mil]{.mark}itary [dialogue
in the Arcti]{.mark}c is [to **preserve**,]{.mark} or restore if
necessary, a **['low tension']{.mark}** strategic
[environment]{.mark}]{.underline} via [increased levels of
**communication**]{.underline} and information sharing so as to avoid or
[[**curtail** the eruption of]{.mark} an Arctic based **[security
dilemma]{.mark}**]{.underline} (i.e., unnecessary action-reaction
cycles).

The US Navy's 2020 strategic blueprint "A Blue Arctic" notes that
"unintended military accidents and conflict, and spill-over of major
power competition in the Arctic all have the potential to threaten US
interests and prosperity," and thus insists that "US Naval forces must
operate more assertively across the Arctic Region to prevail in
day-to-day competition" (The United States Department of the Navy,
2021). The irony is that in the US Navy formally recognizing that a
spillover into the Arctic is possible, and by making preparations for
such a scenario, it is making it all the more likely. Arctic spill-over
is poised to become a self-fulfilling prophecy if Arctic capable states
continue to militarily build up in anticipation for it. Communication,
information sharing, and harmonizing expectations can stunt the
action-reaction cycle by clarifying intentions and actions.

Military activity will continue in the Arctic for the foreseeable
future, this is especially true because of the constabulary and safety
responsibilities that Arctic state militaries have been entrusted with.
[Military-to-military dialogue should thus be understood as a sort of
**[pressure release valve]{.mark}**, intended to **[reduce]{.mark}**, if
not eliminate, [**adversarial** **perceptions**]{.mark}]{.underline}
related to military activity in the Arctic region. It is to
[[contextualize all the necessary military activity]{.mark} in the
Arctic region [in **cooperative** and **transparent** **tones**]{.mark}
rather than competitive and adversarial ones]{.underline}. It is
essential that [Arctic specific mechanisms of military-to-military
dialogue be developed]{.underline} as the "military efforts of regional
states to protect their interests in the region, fueled by fear and
mutual lack of trust, may create 'actionreaction' dynamics as well as
risk creating a self-fulfilling prophecy of militarization and
escalation" (The United States Department of the Navy, 2021).

[[**Expanding** the Arctic **Council**'s mandate]{.mark} to [allow for
the inclusion of **hard security** issues]{.mark}]{.underline} and
topics has been floated as a possible way to begin seriously addressing
hard security in the Arctic. Indeed, the former Prime Ministers of
[[**Iceland** and **Finland** both endorsed]{.underline}]{.mark}
considering whether the Arctic Council's mandate should be expanded to
include hard security (Tømmerbakke, 2019). Most Arctic experts who have
opined on the matter have warned against expanding the Council's
mandate, primarily out of fear that this could paralyze the work of the
Council and undermine the now well-established cooperative relations
regarding soft security and their potential for further growth
(Groenning, 2016).

This analysis heeds the warnings of potential Arctic Council paralysis
and instead suggests the formulation of a parallel defence diplomacy
track to compliment and exploit the soft security cooperation
achievements of the Council while not threatening their vitality or
future potential. This dual-track approach would seek to exploit the
spirit of inter-governmental cooperation on Arctic soft security
matters, not by including hard security matters into already existing
cooperative forums, but by creating a parallel institutional track. This
would ensure that soft security cooperation is insulated from the more
contentious hard security cooperative efforts while at the same time
opening up hard security cooperative avenues. Arctic Security Forces
Roundtable (ASFR) and Arctic Chief of Defence Staff (ACDS) While the end
of the Cold War calmed military activity in the Arctic and led to
several cooperative ventures, like the AMEC, military interest and
activity returned to the Arctic in the mid-2000s. Arctic states
recognized that in such a context dialogue is required to avoid
misperception and miscalculation. Thus, the Arctic Security Forces
Roundtable (ASFR) and Arctic Chief of Defence Staff (ACDS) were
initiated in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Both forums suffered
significant setbacks, however, in the wake of Russia's 2014 annexation
of Crimea. Western Arctic States, in solidarity with Ukraine, chose to
cease engaging with Russia at the military-to-military level in the
Arctic context, and Russia withdrew from the ASFR. Some Western
commentators have voiced a discomfort with reinvigorating these two
forums out of concern that doing so would tacitly condone Russia's
position in Ukraine (Boulegue, Depledge, 2021: 2). Other commentators
have stressed that good behavior need not be a pre-condition for talks,
or that Artic cooperation opportunities ought to be approached in a
"compartmentalized" fashion (Exner-Pirot, 2020: 102). The negotiation of
a NWFZ, or any arms control measure, in the Arctic entails delicate
deliberations regarding strategic stability and wider security concerns,
for such discussions to be fruitful. Many point to the 2014 Russian
invasion of Ukraine as a spark point of deteriorating diplomatic
relations in the Arctic. While it is true, and evident, that it has
reduced levels of cooperation and good-will in Arctic governance forums
and even caused splitter meetings, such events need not totally dictate
the much broader negotiations and cooperation prospects. One can look
South for evidence that diplomatic breakthroughs are still possible
through international fora where Russia and NATO member states are
involved. An October 2016 meeting of the Convention of Antarctic Marine
Living Resources (CCAMLR) Commission, which Russia chaired, produced a
breakthrough in the form of an agreement to designate the Ross Sea as a
marine protected area (Conley, Melino, 2016: 3). These negotiations
included Russia, China, the United States and several other NATO member
states.

It has been previously reported that Russia is interested in resuming
the annual ACDS meetings, with Russia's
**[[Ambassador]{.underline}]{.mark}**-at-Large [[for the Arctic
stating]{.underline}]{.mark} that "[**[Russia
supports]{.mark}**]{.underline} resuming the annual [[meetings
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the Chiefs of the [[Armed Forces in the Arctic
states]{.mark} in order [to prevent **deterioration** of the military
**policy** situation in the Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline} This would be
an [[effective measure to build **trust** and **security**]{.mark} in
the region"]{.underline} (Danilov, 2021). Russia is not alone in
suggesting resumption of these meetings. The US International Security
Advisory Board recommended in 2016 that the US resume
military-to-military dialogue with Russia through the ASFR and ACDS
particularly noting that ["U.S. interests would be served by resuming
military-to-military **engagement** with **Russia**]{.underline} in the
Arctic on the basis of a determination that the advantages of doing so
would outweigh the impact (if any) on U.S. policy with respect to
maintaining, along with other nations, pressure on Russia to resolve
Ukraine/Crimea issues on satisfactory terms" (International Security
Advisory Board, 2016). Notably, it can be assumed that the calculations
of these assessments have changed due the fluid geopolitical dynamic of
US -- Russia relations since 2016.

#### **Abscence of security dialogue [fragments]{.underline} the council.**

**Burke et al '25** \[Ryan Burke, Andrea Charron, and Michael Paul,
3-11-2025, \"Trump 2.0's Arctic Opportunity: Thawing Frozen Dialogue\",
https://plasticpipeline.wilsoncenter.org/article/trump-20s-arctic-opportunity-thawing-frozen-dialogue\]

Strategy and statecraft abound with well-worn adages: \"Keep your
friends close, and your enemies closer\"; \"The enemy you know is better
than the one you don't.\" While these phrases may hold wisdom for some,
they do not guide US policy toward Russia. The Obama administration's
2015 prohibition on bilateral military cooperation between the US and
Russia was a strategic miscalculation, intended to punish Moscow for
violating sovereignty and disrupting the rules-based order. Successive
administrations have upheld this ban, restricting Pentagon funds for
\"bilateral military-to-military cooperation between the Governments of
the United States and the Russian Federation.\" While politicians defend
this stance as necessary to counter Russian aggression in Ukraine, the
reality is that it hinders Western interests. Any proposal to restore
military dialogue is swiftly labeled as appeasement, stifling
discussions that could reduce tensions.

[Trump's **[second term]{.mark}** has [clearly signaled a different
relationship]{.mark} with Russia]{.underline} but [[military-to-military
**dialogue** is still **illegal**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Rather than
select US decision-makers with direct access to Russian representatives,
which can concentrate dis and mal information campaigns by Russia, the
ban preventing conversations with Russian counterparts at every level of
US government needs to be lifted. Where the US leads, allies will
follow.

The Biden administration's 2022 National Security Strategy pledged to
restore American leadership on the global stage while tacitly
criticizing the previous Trump administration's self-interested and
transactional approach to world affairs. However, when it comes to
Russian relations, [[neither the first **Trump** nor **Biden**]{.mark}
administrations [did anything to rescind Obama's Kremlin ban]{.mark}.
Decreased **dialogue** between Washington and Moscow only [**degrades
diplomacy**, exacerbates **tension**, and increases the
unknowns]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since the beginning of Russia's invasion
of Ukraine in 2014, the global situation has gone from bad to worse. It
has become particularly troubling in the Arctic where military and
commercial activities continue to increase in scope and scale and where
there are no functioning forums---at the official level---enabling
Washington and Moscow to deescalate tensions. Absent a structured forum
for deescalation, the risk for miscalculation and escalation increases.

[The [**Arctic** presents an opportunity]{.mark}]{.underline} for the
Trump administration to [[pursue **pragmatic** and more open
engagement]{.underline}]{.mark} between Washington and Moscow,
specifically in the military and security space. Such a forum
currently exists at the Track 2 level, but absent official participation
from Washington and Moscow decision makers, this forum's efforts to
curtail conflict will struggle. 

Currently, [[official US-Russia dialogue on Arctic security is
**non-existent**, increasing the risk of
**miscalc**]{.mark}ulation]{.underline}. For nearly [[two decades prior
to Russia's annexation]{.underline}]{.mark} of Crimea in 2014, [[the
**eight** Arctic **states**]{.underline}]{.mark}---Russia, Canada,
Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and the US---[[collaborated
under the **Ottawa** Declaration, engaging in diplomacy through]{.mark}
the [**Arctic** **Council**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Council, however,
excludes military and security from its mandate. Following Russia's
invasion of Ukraine, collective Arctic cooperation collapsed, with
Moscow blaming Western sanctions for the diplomatic freeze. As a result,
[[**mistrust** now dominates Arctic relations]{.mark}, despite the fact
that much of this [discord **originates** outside the
region.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Conflict avoidance demands engagement. While Russia and the West
communicate through the United Nations and on issues like border
disputes, fishing rights, and search-and-rescue protocols,
Arctic-specific security dialogue remains absent. [[Russia was
**expelled** from Arctic defense forums]{.underline}]{.mark} like the
Arctic Chiefs of Defense (ACHOD) and the Arctic Security Forces
Roundtable (ASFR) in 2014. Today, Russia participates in the Arctic
Council only virtually. Without an official security dialogue, Arctic
states risk misjudgment and escalation.

The reluctance to re-engage with Russia is driven by political risk
aversion rather than strategic logic. Reviving dialogue does not mean
endorsing Russia's actions in Ukraine---it is, rather, a pragmatic
necessity for Arctic stability. The HNT's proposed measures focus on
ensuring that military activities in the Arctic remain predictable and
professional. Key initiatives include prior notification of military
exercises, an Arctic '911' communication platform for emergency
deconfliction, and commitments to refrain from escalatory activities
like GPS jamming or buzzing commercial vessels. Promoting and ensuring a
rules-based Arctic requires changing past policies that have done more
to raise tensions than they do to lower risk. These confidence-building
efforts align with long-standing Arctic governance traditions. The
region has a history of groundbreaking agreements between Arctic and
non-Arctic states, such as the moratorium on commercial fishing in the
central Arctic Ocean. Many of these agreements originated from informal
expert discussions before being adopted at the state level. The same
process could apply to Arctic security: discussions on military
transparency and risk reduction could eventually translate into formal
agreements, fostering stability not just in the Arctic but beyond.

[Strengthening [military **dialogue**]{.mark} between the US and Russia
in the Arctic serves a broader strategic goal---[preventing
**unintended** conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unlike arms control
treaties, which require mutual trust, CBMs are designed to function in
adversarial relationships. By enabling predictable military behavior,
they reduce the likelihood of dangerous miscalculations.

The war in Ukraine has undoubtedly strained Arctic relations, but [the
[region's future is not **predetermined**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
dismantling of conflict-resolution mechanisms in recent years has left a
dangerous void, but that does not mean rebuilding them is impossible.

[[Renewing **dialogue**]{.mark} with Russia is not about legitimizing
aggression]{.underline}---it is [[about restoring **pragmatic**
**engagement**]{.mark} to prevent **conflict** elsewhere]{.underline}.
The West's refusal to engage with Russia is viewed internationally as
punitive rather than strategic. However, [[dialogue is occurring in
**unofficial** **forums**]{.mark}, demonstrating that [productive
engagement is possible.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The [Trump administration has a chance to correct course]{.underline}
and return the Arctic to the "High North, Low Tension\" label it once
enjoyed. Rescinding the prohibition on military-to-military cooperation
with Russia is a critical first step toward reestablishing security
dialogue in the Arctic. 

At a time when geopolitical tensions have stifled official
communication, a structured backchannel approach offers a viable
alternative. The [[Arctic is an ideal testing ground for renewed
engagement]{.underline}]{.mark}, given its history of diplomatic
agreements and its critical role in global stability. A future framework
for Arctic security should incorporate structured, informal discussions
among experts, complementing existing diplomatic efforts. Such an
approach does not replace official negotiations but provides a
foundation for deescalation and risk reduction. The stakes in the Arctic
are too high to ignore---now is the time to act.

#### Transformation of the Arctic Council into a security [forum]{.underline} is key towards [adressing]{.underline} regional [instability]{.underline}.

**DeRusha '22** \[Daniel DeRusha, Major in the U.S Air Force, 4-6-2022,
"A New Arctic Security Council: Why the Arctic Needs a Security
Cooperation Forum," FAO Journal of International Affairs,
https://faoajournal.substack.com/p/a-new-arctic-security-council-why\]

Background

[The [**Arctic** **Council**]{.mark} has the [unique opportunity to be
the **forum of choice** for]{.mark} both [economic and **security**
**issues**]{.mark}]{.underline} among its 52 Arctic states, non-Arctic
states, indigenous people groups, and governmental and non-governmental
organizations. 2 Followers of this topic already know that years ago,
the [**Arctic** **Council** set about forming an economically focused
organization to cultivate robust, responsible business operations in the
Arctic]{.underline}.3 In mid-[[2019]{.underline}]{.mark}, that
years-long [[process of establishing]{.mark} the fittingly named
**[A]{.mark}**rctic **[E]{.mark}**conomic **[C]{.mark}**ouncil
culminated]{.underline} when both organizations signed a Memorandum of
Understanding. 4 This agreement established a formal relationship to
"provide a framework for cooperation and to facilitate collaboration" on
shared goals. 5

Strategically, this [[model offers a creative way to increase the Arctic
Council's range of influence]{.underline}]{.mark}. Under this inaugural
agreement between the Arctic Economic Council and the Arctic Council,
each side can leverage the other's respective political and economic
strength to expand their power and influence mutually. In other words,
the Arctic Council now enjoys a measure of influence on Arctic economic
activities, whereas the Arctic Economic Council has the means to
influence diplomatic talks. Essentially, the Arctic Council found a way
to extend its influence into new issues while avoiding the limitations
of its own charter.

Why A Security Forum?

First, security is critically important to all Arctic states. Though, it
is a more complicated issue than Arctic economics. This is particularly
true considering the daunting task of getting the two Arctic powerhouses
-- the [United States and Russia -- to discuss security issues in the
wake of Russia's annexation]{.underline} of Crimea in 2014. Russia's
[**invasion** marks a significant **turning point** in U.S.-Russia
relations and largely explains why US security **cooperation** in the
Arctic remain consistent with traditional alliances and
partnerships]{.underline}. 6 Nevertheless, Russian and Chinese military
activities are increasing and changing the dynamics in the region. 7 8
According to Postler, "\[t\]he geopolitical situation in the Arctic is
thus more tense than it was when the Council was established, and
warrants serious contemplation of security concerns." 9

The importance of security to Arctic states reflects in their Arctic
strategies. [The **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates and [**Russia**
have regularly discussed security **issues**]{.mark} in the Arctic
through various policy documents across multiple
administrations]{.underline}.10 Canada's Arctic policy recognizes the
Arctic presents "unique security challenges" and emphasizes
collaboration to confront "\[t\]he complexity of the regional security
environment." 11 The Kingdom of Denmark's strategy prioritizes "the
safeguarding of \[national\] interests," which relate to "security and
defence matters." 12 Finland's strategy states, "\[a\]s the strategic
importance of the Arctic region is increasing, the \[European Union's\]
common foreign and security policy should pay more attention to it." 13
In a 2017 report to Parliament, Iceland's Foreign Minister emphasized
"free trade and international cooperation on security and development
issues." 14 Increased Russian military activity in the north is "an
important factor in Norway's security and defence policy." 15 Finally,
Sweden's recently released Arctic policy is one of the clearest
descriptions of the connection between climate change, increased global
competition, and elevated security risks in the region: For many of
these countries, the latest versions of their Arctic policies
(referenced above) are also the first time they articulate national
security concerns related to the Arctic. The evolving geopolitical
environment is impacting Arctic states, and security is now a
significant issue for all.

Second, [[a **stable forum** where all Arctic states can discuss
**security issues** does not exist. Governments must rely on]{.mark} the
usual web of [bilateral relationships and **externally focused**
multilateral **organizations** to hold security
talks]{.mark}]{.underline}. The problem is that [[Arctic issues are
**distinct** from other global regions and involve a unique blend of
actors]{.mark} such]{.underline} [as indigenous groups. [Other
forums]{.mark} focusing on different parts of the globe [are simply
insufficient to address current Arctic challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The question remains if a security forum is so vital, why does it not
already exist?

In fact, an Arctic security construct is not a new idea. The last decade
witnessed sincere attempts at creating one, but all have either
disbanded or no longer include every Arctic state. For instance, The
Arctic Security Forces Roundtable, established in 2011 by United States
European Command and its Norwegian counterparts, was initially designed
to coordinate military activities among Arctic states.17 However, the
group formally uninvited Russia in 2014 when a majority of parent
administrations condemned the aggression. 18 While the group remains
otherwise intact, its influence is more limited without Russian
participation. Most bilateral groups collapsed entirely once Russian
hostilities began, such as the NATO-Russia Council, but this was
entirely predictable given their sole dependency on open relations with
one other entity. 19 While history shows that multilateralism alone
cannot overcome all state differences, every Arctic state's
representation is a necessary starting point for any future security
forum. The Arctic Council, on the other hand, remained unusually
insulated from the fallout over Crimea. Russia continues participating
in Arctic Council meetings even after every other member issued
sanctions on Moscow and even suspended Russia from other forums, like
the G8.20 21 Today, the Arctic Council remains the Arctic's premier
collaborative organization, even though "\[w\]ith no binding legal
powers and mandate to discuss military topics, the Arctic Council, in
its current form, is a weak institution to guard against aggressive
geopolitical posturing in the Arctic." 22 While some perceive the Arctic
Council's mostly non-binding, consensus-based approach as a weakness, it
proved remarkably resilient in the face of intense political pressure.
Key to the Arctic Council's resiliency is its foundation in soft
regionalism. At its center, soft regionalism is an approach for
achieving stability by pushing concepts around a shared regional
identity, in contrast to other less personalized ways of other upon
legalistic obligations. 23 Two predominant examples of this are the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC). 24 25 These organizations' characteristics
are an "aversion to legally-binding commitments, preference for weak
organizational structures, and emphasis on consensus-building." 26 The
Arctic Council and Arctic Economic Council espouse similar values in
their charters. 27 28 As a result, ASEAN, APEC, the Arctic Council, and
the Arctic Economic Council all reside in the space outside of national
borders, which leads each organization to a strong ethos of cooperation.
29 30 31 32 33 Similarly, an all-inclusive security forum with a
foundation in "soft regionalism" will withstand current geopolitical
pressures. The Arctic Council is uniquely postured to sponsor such a
forum, like it already achieved with the Arctic Economic Council.

Finally, [[**Arctic** **Council**]{.mark} members are [indicating they
wish to **establish** an Arctic security **forum**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
To be clear, the Arctic Council self-prohibited military security
discussions in 1998, making evidence of security conversations
challenging to ascertain. 34 However, during testimony before Congress
in March 2020, General Terrence O'Shaughnessy, [[commander of]{.mark}
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates **[North]{.mark}**ern
**[Com]{.mark}**mand, [revealed]{.mark} some elements of [security
cooperation occur at **Arctic** **Council**
meetings]{.mark}]{.underline}. He said, "[we're able to use, kind of,
the **[Arctic]{.mark}** [Security]{.mark} **[Council]{.mark}** to go and
talk through those security issues]{.underline}, to actually have that
dialogue with our allies and partners." 35 Besides [[**admitting**
security conversations occur]{.underline}]{.mark}, General O'Shaughnessy
[[**added** the word **security**]{.mark} to Arctic
Council]{.underline}, though no formal organization with that name
exists. Whether based on his awareness of the fruitless history
surrounding an Arctic Security Council, or simply his intuition of
current geopolitical dynamics, General O'Shaughnessy's [Freudian slip
[suggests]{.mark} a dedicated space for [security conversations has a
**natural** **place** within the Arctic Council's
orbit]{.mark}.]{.underline}

More recently, [[Russian **Ambassador-at-Large** for the Arctic]{.mark},
Nikolay **[Korchunov]{.mark}**, publicly broached the issue of Arctic
security, [**declaring** his country's desire to **revive formal
dialogue** on security issues]{.mark}]{.underline}. In an interview with
the Russian press, he said, "Russia supports resuming the annual
meetings of the Chairs of the Armed Forces in the Arctic states in order
to prevent deterioration of the military policy situation in the
Arctic," adding this would "build trust and security in the region." 36

Former Chief of the [[Norwegian Navy]{.underline}]{.mark}, now
Distinguished International Fellow at the United States Naval War
College, Lars Saunes, [[made similar overtures]{.underline}]{.mark}. He
recently said, "\[t\]he way \[the situation\] is today, [[deterrence and
military posturing]{.mark} are more or less the [only signaling that
takes place in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}...Right now, there is [a
[**security** **dilemma** in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Arctic
states are increasingly acknowledging this." 37 To be sure, Saunes,
along with his colleague Walter Berbrick, released an extensive report
analyzing the status of Arctic security cooperation. They provide a
[series of recommendations, including [**inviting Russia back** to
forums that uninvited them]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2014.38 Indeed, the
escalating military situation has many Arctic states worried about the
potential for miscalculation, as pleas for an Arctic security forum
continue to grow

#### Building the council as a [security]{.underline} forum [checks]{.underline} Chinese Arctic [expansionism]{.underline}.

Cooperation Forum," FAO Journal of International Affairs,

\*\*brackets in original text

Why Now?

The question turns from why to why now? As [[**security**
concerns]{.mark} get louder and louder, the merits of the [Arctic
Council's **agnostic** **stance** will **fade**. Arctic security issues
are no longer peripheral]{.mark}, and dialogue enables peaceful
development. [If **Arctic** **Council** members abandon]{.mark} efforts
to cultivate a [**regional** **security**
**dialogue**]{.mark}]{.underline}, evidence suggests [the Arctic region
could [transform]{.mark} in ways that [spell **strategic
disaster**]{.mark} for all Arctic states, including the **U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline}. After all, Arctic states are not the only ones
with a substantial interest in the Arctic.

[[China's recent public]{.mark} statements and policies are a [**direct
challenge** to the Arctic Council's authority]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Around the time it earned permanent observer status in 2013, China
issued a minimal challenge to the Arctic Council. 39 However, once
climate change in the Arctic began impacting China's economy, Beijing
started criticizing the Arctic governance structure as inadequate to
handle this global problem.40 Then in 2018, [China escalated by
publishing a **white** **paper**]{.underline} entitled "China's Arctic
Policy," [declaring itself as "an important stakeholder in Arctic
affairs]{.underline}" and a "Near-Arctic State." 41

On the surface, China's argument against the Arctic Council's role is
philosophical. Beijing believes internationalizing the Arctic is
sufficient for addressing environmental challenges and suitable for
Arctic governance broadly. [China sees the mosaic of international
organizations, like the Arctic Council and Arctic Economic Council, as a
**structural** **hindrance** to Arctic cooperation]{.underline}.42
However, as an outsider, China's preference for international law is
deliberate. Kong recognizes their motive saying, ["\[b\]y **relying** on
the various international regimes and treaties that it is a party,
**[China]{.mark}** has effectively [placed itself \[as\] one of the
**key players**]{.mark} in Arctic governance]{.underline}." 43

At the root is fear in Beijing that as Arctic nations realize the
opportunities of a thawing Arctic, members will embrace policies that
benefit themselves and suppress non-Arctic states' opportunities.44
Shortly after the release of China's Arctic policy, United States
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo issued sharp criticism of China's bold
presumptions about its role in Arctic governance.45 Likewise, all Arctic
states have resisted China's involvement in some way. 46 Nonetheless,
China continues pursuing internationalization despite weak international
support.

While [**[internationalization]{.mark}** of the Arctic is [not a
long-term **US interest**]{.mark}, neither is isolationism.]{.underline}
According to researcher Sybille Reinke de Buitrago, resistance to
internationalization in favor of isolationism has the effect of
elevating overall reliance on individual "national approaches." 47 She
goes on to say, a heavier reliance on national approaches "endanger
stability and security." 48 Both internationalization and isolation
increase challenges and risks to the future of Arctic governance.
However, a regionally focused security forum empowers Arctic states
collectively, effectively blocking either course's corrosive effects.

China's white paper also includes an Arctic off-shoot of the Belt and
Road Initiative called the "Polar Silk Road" and is [aggressively
pursuing economic partnerships with Arctic states]{.underline}. 49 In
particular, China is seeking agreements with Russia, which may further
[drive a wedge between Russia and other Arctic states]{.underline}.50
Pincus cautions against a standardized US approach to each competitor
that "symbolically groups Russia and China together...inadvertently
\[providing\] impetus for more substantive Sino-Russia cooperation." 51
Thankfully, in the economic realm, the United States has an avenue via
the Arctic Economic Council to tailor a more nuanced approach to each
competitor. Since Russia is a voting member of both the Arctic Council
and the Arctic Economic Council, the [**[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates and others [can **leverage** this multilateral
relationship]{.mark} [to **shape** Russia's **calculus**]{.mark} while
[contemplating a partnership with China]{.mark}]{.underline}. Malign
business schemes in the region are precisely the sort of thing the
Arctic Economic Council vows to resist. 52 Though Arctic states will
never completely stop Beijing's moves, the consensus among Arctic
members increases the chances of slowing them down and influences
members' decision-making. Consensus on security issues will have a
comparable stabilizing effect. However, these sorts of diplomatic
options are not available to counter unwanted alliances and partnerships
without a security forum.

Still, [some resist the topic of **military security** in any
conversation related to the Arctic Council]{.underline}. They believe
sensitive security topics might cause unnecessary friction between
members when political tensions are already high.53 Advocates often
downplay Russia's aggression or dismiss fears over China's expansionism
as alarmist. 54 55 However, every day these [arguments become less and
less accurate]{.underline}. In earlier testimony to Congress, just one
month before commenting about the Arctic Council, General O'Shaughnessy
testified that Russia's military infrastructure expansion is a direct
challenge to the US military. 56 Also, according to the recent release
of the United States Department of Defense's report on China's military
and security developments, [[China's foreign policy "seeks to **revise
aspects**]{.mark} of the [international
**order**]{.mark}]{.underline}...in accordance with ideas and principles
it views as essential to forging an external environment conducive to
China's national rejuvenation." 57 [[Security is more
**critical**]{.mark} to the Arctic than ever before,]{.underline} and
Russia and China's intentions are not benign. [[Conditions are suitable
to build a **security** **cooperation** forum that would **de-escalate**
tensions]{.mark} between Arctic states and [**blunt** efforts by
external **actors** who wish to **disrupt** the balance of power in the
region.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Absence of security cooperation is [destabilizing]{.underline}---the [pause]{.underline} of the council is [self-inflicted]{.underline} escalation.

Defence, 6-21-2022, \"Arctic Security Cooperation\", The Simons
Foundation,
https://www.thesimonsfoundation.ca/highlights/arctic-security-cooperation-still-needed-it-still-possible-0\]

In response to Russia\'s illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014,
[[**NATO** suspended all practical **cooperation**]{.mark} with
Russia]{.underline}. Meetings of the Arctic Chiefs of Defence ended, and
Russia, in response to sanctions, stopped participating in the Arctic
Security Forces Roundtable. The decision by the [seven non-Russian
states of the Arctic Council to temporarily
[**pause** "**participation** in all meetings of the Council]{.mark} and
its subsidiary bodies]{.underline}" (currently with Russia as chair) was
thus not a surprise, but it does raise the broader question of why
dialogue and direct engagement mechanisms cannot be designed to carry on
when needed most, when relations and violations of norms and laws are at
their worst, without parties to the dialogue thereby condoning, or being
seen to condone, the violations.

There may be a visceral temptation to make the horrific events in
Ukraine the "breaking point of Arctic cooperation" with Russia, but
[cooperation is not the only objective of engagement. [Dialogue and
engagement are also about **mutual accountability**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[-- about challenging interlocutors and managing adversarial relations.
Dialogue with adversaries is pursued, [as **realists** should
**recognize**, because **refusing** to talk risks having **confrontation
spin out of control**.]{.mark}]{.underline} The American think tank, the
Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), recognized in a
2020 report that a deficit in diplomacy meant lost opportunities. It
called for "annual meetings of the foreign and defense ministers of the
eight Arctic Council nations, outside of the Arctic Council venue,"
along with "more frequent meetings of the five Arctic coastal states to
discuss management of the \[Central Arctic Ocean\]."

The contention, in Arctic Today, that ["[peaceful engagement]{.mark}" at
the Arctic Council table is [**untenable** as long as **Russia**
**threatens**]{.mark}]{.underline} Sweden and Finland with "military and
political consequences" if they join NATO, [[**ignores** the long
history of Russia and the West **threatening**]{.mark} each other to the
point of **[nuclear annihilation]{.mark}** [without leaving dialogue
**tables**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the Cold War it was precisely the
dangerous threats and counter-threats that required the creation of
reliable avenues of sustained engagement. If, as the Norwegian Border
Commissioner says, things are "back to a cold-war mode," it doesn't
follow that all contact is ended -- something retired Canadian diplomat
Gar Pardy understands well in his critique of ministerial and media
responses to a Canadian official attending a Russian national day event.

Security Dialogue\
[When "convening power" is a central strength, as it is for the
[**Arctic** **Council**, refusing to meet invites **self-inflicted
injury**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [quite apart from the Arctic Council,
[the current **absence** of a reliable **security** **forum**]{.mark} in
the Arctic ought to be [especially concerning]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [It
is in the midst of crises that **engagement** with adversaries or across
deep political divides becomes more **important**]{.underline}]{.mark}
[than ever]{.underline}. A 2020 essay in Modern Diplomacy on security
dialogue in the Arctic, argues that "after six years \[since the 2014
annexation of Crimea\] it is apparent that the ban on mil-to-mil
engagement with Russia is adversely affecting all Arctic states."

A recent (May 2022) Council on Foreign Relations blog on the importance
of engagement with Russia, argues that, "given Russia's Arctic assets,
[[any organization governing the region without Moscow]{.mark} would be
[attempting to oversee an area mostly **outside** its
**control**]{.mark}]{.underline}." The focus is the Arctic Council, and
while the Council is a dialogue forum, not a governance body, the basic
point broadly applies, especially with regard to Arctic security
engagement. Engaging with adversaries is essential, and in the Arctic
would be a welcome instance of "regional functionalism" taking
precedence over "international geopolitics."\[1\] The value or
effectiveness of engagement with adversaries obviously depends on the
substance of the dialogue and the seriousness with which deep
differences and threatening postures are addressed. Security dialogues
in the Arctic that are confined to the seven non-Russian states, the
kind Canada's Defence Minister hosted in May 2022, are bound to be
helpful, but they are no substitute for pan-Arctic engagement.

The distinguished American Arctic diplomat, David Balton, wrote in
2021 that "despite serious tensions between Russia and other Arctic
Nations concerning other regions and other issues, Arctic governments
have largely chosen to compartmentalize the Arctic -- to set aside those
tensions in favor of cooperating with each other in the region." In
October 2021, for example, an Arctic Coast Guard Forum gathering
included all eight Arctic states, in spite of their profound differences
in other contexts, and focused on cooperation in search-and-rescue
operations and marine pollution responses, and on other "threats to
maritime security."\[2\] But that was then. The Russia that now visits
catastrophe on Ukraine seems to have little in common with the Russia
that cooperates with Arctic coast guards, and that of course leads to
the question of when the Russia of Ukraine might show up in the Arctic.
Amb. Balton has thus more recently lamented that "some of what made the
Arctic special, made it exceptional, seems not at hand at the moment."

But that does not mean that all military actions taken in response are
constructive. A Wilson Center paper, written before but published after
Russia's February 24 attack on Ukraine, rightfully raises concern about
naval operations by the US and NATO in the Barents Sea near the
homeports for Russia's Northern Fleet. It particularly notes [[U.S.
**attack** **sub**]{.mark}marines [operating in]{.mark} the waters
[(bastion) used by Russian]{.mark} [intercontinental ballistic
**missile** **subs**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and in sea lanes used by
Russian attack subs between the Kola Peninsula and the North Atlantic.
As argued before in these pages, [[**threatening** Russia's deterrent
forces does not advance **strategic stability**]{.mark} in the Arctic or
beyond.]{.underline}

Stephen Walt, the noted international relations scholar now at the
Harvard Kennedy School, was also insisting in the pre-Feb. 24 context
that the pursuit of sustainable peace in Europe would not be advanced by
"containment" or a "major military buildup," but "by a serious effort to
reduce the mutual suspicions that have risen between Russia and NATO
since the late 1990s" -- in these post-Feb. 24 times, his counsel is as
relevant to the Arctic as to Europe. Writing for The
Conversation, Gabriella Gricius, an American Arctic security scholar,
points out that "working with Russia in the Arctic is even more
important now than it was before the invasion." Expanded engagement
could, as Gricius suggests, even "precipitate a cooperation spiral" that
would not only enhance Arctic stability but also help to "lessen
tensions elsewhere."

[The [need to engage with Russia]{.mark} in a region [where it is
obviously **prominent**]{.mark}, heightens the [importance of the
proposal for an **Arctic security forum**]{.mark}]{.underline}, made in
the 2020 Modern Diplomacy essay noted earlier. Developed by Arctic
experts Troy J. Bouffard, Elizabeth Buchanan, and Michael
Young,\[3\] the proposal reviews the multiple Arctic forums that already
exist, noting that "a glaring gap in these fora is one that addresses
Arctic security or defence issues."

Indigenous communities and security The Arctic's dialogue gap is also
reflected in the failure, as Indigenous leaders in the Arctic have
confirmed,\[4\] of the seven non-Russian state members of the Arctic
Council to consult the Council's Indigenous permanent participants
before taking the decision to pause participation in its work. Not
consulting Indigenous communities on such a consequential decision, even
though they are formal participants in the Arctic Council's work,
suggests they are even less likely to be consulted on explicitly
security matters, for which there is now no formal consultative table.
Neither the Gwich'in Council International nor the ICC objected to the
pause, but the ICC in particular used the occasion to emphasize the
importance of respecting indigenous interests in the development of
Arctic security polices: "Inuit are committed to the Arctic remaining a
zone of peace, a phrase coined by former USSR President Mikhail
Gorbachev in a 1987 speech in Murmansk." It noted that the ICC's guiding
documents repeat that basic message, including in 2018 when it was
mandated to "lay the groundwork to declare the Arctic as a peaceful
Zone." In 1989 Mary Simon, now the Governor-General of Canada but then
the President of the Inuit Circumpolar Conference, wrote a seminal
article entitled, "Toward an Arctic Zone of Peace," in Peace Research
journal. She reasserted the need for indigenous communities to become
directly involved in shaping Arctic approaches to peace and security,
reminding Arctic states that the "vital starting point" was for them to
recognize "that vast regions in Northern Canada, Alaska, Greenland and
eastern Siberia constitute first and foremost the Inuit homeland." She
said, "we do not wish our traditional territories to be treated as a
strategic military and combat zone between eastern and western
alliances." She pointed out, among other things, the dangers of military
powers abusing "freedom of navigation" in Arctic waters and calling for
an examination of "how naval uses of the Arctic and other seas might be
limited" in order to "advance arms control and the common security of
all nations." Northern perspectives highlighted in a 2020 publication of
the North American and Arctic Defence and Security Network (NAADSN),
Voices from the Arctic,\[5\] recalls a series of resolutions, beginning
in 1977, calling for "peaceful and safe uses of the Arctic Circumpolar
Zone." Ambitious and challenging in many of the details, the indigenous
scholar, writer, and Chair of the International ICC, Dalee Sambo Dorough
nevertheless reminds governments that those resolutions remain relevant
and important calls to demilitarize the Arctic. These Inuit Circumpolar
Conference calls for the Arctic to be respected as a zone of peace have
been consistent over the decades, emphasizing an ongoing commitment to
dialogue and cooperation that is not conditional on the willingness of
the major powers to cooperate with each other. That raises the question
of how the ICC's "political universe" intersects with the state and
military centred security universe that now holds sway in the Arctic.
Bridget Larocque, also writing in Voices from the Arctic, points out
that the credible pursuit of a peaceful and prosperous Arctic cannot
happen without direct Indigenous involvement in decision-making. A
northern indigenous leader with extensive experience in indigenous
organizations, self-government negotiations, and government, Larocque
warns that "policies developed without the knowledge and wisdom of
indigenous expertise, which we bring as life-long Northerners, is
nothing more than the continuation of the colonial methodology that
perpetuates antagonism."

NATO and Arctic bridge building?\
One can only guess at Vladimir Putin's appreciation of irony, but a war
begun in large measure to blunt the spread and influence of NATO that
has succeeded in elevating it into one of the more coveted clubs to join
surely qualifies as such. And while Putin may have a genuine irony to
contemplate, for the [Arctic]{.underline}, where [[**cooperation** is
not just an option but a **necessity**]{.mark}, a heightened Russia/NATO
[divide looks more like **tragedy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. With seven of
eight Arctic states destined to be in NATO, Russia seems to be left on
its own, but of course the most prominent, dominant, presence in the
region will not be isolated -- it will have to be reckoned with.

Geography determines neighbors, not political preferences, and strategic
realism should recognize that stability is not achieved by shunning
powerful or prominent neighbours but by managing neighborhoods. And here
is the critical point, the management of intra-Arctic stability cannot
credibly be outsourced to NATO. A Western defence alliance is not the
institutional medium through which to pursue mutuality and stability in
a region that includes Russia. Acknowledging and collectively responding
via NATO to perceived military vulnerabilities on the alliance's eastern
flank or in the North Atlantic is obviously central to its defence
mandate, but it does not follow that NATO's institutional military
presence is required, or could be constructive, in the high Arctic, or
especially that NATO could be an effective vehicle for addressing
political/security controversies with Russia. The requirement in the
Arctic is cooperation and the search for mutuality across the gaping
geostrategic and indigenous/state divides. That means bridge-building,
which is not the purpose, and certainly not the hallmark, of defence
alliances.

[[**Pan-Arctic engagement** on security, with a view to **resuming
cooperation**]{.mark} on the full range of issues on which Arctic
well-being depends, [is **needed** **now** more than
ever]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is thus the collective responsibility of
all the diverse custodians of Arctic region security to muster the will,
prudence, and uninterrupted engagement to advance the shared interests
and well-being of the people of the Arctic, without giving an
unintentional or implied pass to Russia on its gross violations of the
well-being of Ukrainians and Ukraine.

### S \-\--Science Diplomacy

#### The Arctic Council's key to [science]{.underline}.

**Jacobsen 25**, \[Svein Vigeland Rottem and Marc Jacobsen. \"The Arctic
Council in the Shadow of Geopolitics,\"

Three reasons why the Arctic Council must survive

There are many good reasons why the Arctic Council should survive. Here
we will highlight three:

First, the [[involvement of Indigenous]{.mark} peoples as permanent
participants [in]{.mark} the [council]{.mark} is **[unique]{.mark}** in
an international context]{.underline}. They do not have direct
decision-making authority, but they are at the table and provide input
-- and are heard -- when decisions are made. If the Arctic Council does
not survive, this unique construct will fall apart, which will create a
major challenge for Arctic Indigenous peoples, who are unlikely to gain
the same kind of influence in another regional forum.

Second, the [Arctic Council's [working groups]{.mark} are a unique
construct]{.underline}: Over three decades, [[scientists and
officials]{.mark} have accumulated [knowledge]{.mark} that has been
[incorporated into **national administration**]{.mark} and
**international convention work**]{.underline}. This work has thus
[helped to [make]{.mark} the rest of the [world aware of]{.mark} the
**enormous** [climatic and environmental challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}
that are extraordinarily noticeable [in the Arctic]{.underline}, well
[exemplified by the average regional temperature increase]{.underline}
which is about three times higher than the global average. Thus, the
[[scientific work under]{.mark} the]{.underline} auspices of the
[[Arctic Council]{.underline}]{.mark} is not only [[important
for]{.mark} the]{.underline} region, but for the
[[globe]{.underline}]{.mark} at large. [If]{.underline} the [Arctic
Council does not survive the current crisis, these [essential networks
will]{.mark}]{.underline} likely [[collapse]{.mark}, and [they cannot be
rebuilt overnight]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The third, and related, reason is that the [Arctic states and the other
actors of the [Council face]{.mark} **major [transboundary
challenges]{.mark}** that are [best solved
**jointly**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Be it [**[biodiversity]{.mark}**
issues, the spread of **[diseases]{.mark}** and **[environmental
problems]{.mark}**]{.underline}; the risk of the latter is only
increasing in step with the heightened activities in the region.

#### The Arctic Council's [key]{.underline} to [effective]{.underline} Arctic science policy\-\--[unilateral]{.underline} approaches [don't]{.underline} solve warming.

**Spence 23**, \[Jennifer Spence is the director of the Arctic
Initiative at Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and
International Affairs. \"Opportunities for Multilateral Cooperation on
Climate Change in the Arctic,\"

Published August 16^th^, 2023, Accessed June 27^th^, 2025 // ajap\]

[Climate change is complex, multi-dimensional, and
far-reaching.]{.underline} The impacts of climate change are not
uniform, however, and few regions are currently facing the rapid and
dramatic effects being experienced in the Arctic. [Being a region on the
frontlines of climate change with sparse populations and limited
infrastructure emphasizes the importance of leveraging opportunities for
collaboration and coordination.]{.underline}

[The functions of multilateral cooperation in the Arctic related to
climate change are **multifold**]{.underline}, including to:

[Deepen and accelerate understanding]{.underline},

[Share experiences and lessons learned]{.underline},

[Mobilize limited resources]{.underline},

[Coordinate responses]{.underline}, and

[Collaborate on solutions]{.underline}.

Arctic Council

[For more than 25 years, the [Arctic Council]{.mark} has been the
**[primary multilat]{.mark}eral [institution]{.mark}** dedicated to
[advancing environment]{.mark}al protection [and]{.mark} sustainable
[development]{.mark} in the region]{.underline}. [This [**unique**
forum]{.mark} provides an important mechanism to [translate
research]{.mark}, Indigenous Knowledge, and local experiences [into
policy advice]{.mark} and guidance [at the]{.mark} local, regional,
national, and [**international** level]{.mark}s]{.underline}. In
addition to the eight Arctic member states (Canada, Denmark, Finland,
Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Russia, and the United States), the Council
established the unique role of "Permanent Participant," which provides
Arctic Indigenous Peoples with a voice in the decisions and activities
of the Council.

At present, the Council also has 38 Observers, including non-Arctic
states, intergovernmental and inter-parliamentary organizations, and
non-governmental organizations. [While military security is not within
the mandate of the [Arctic Council]{.mark}, the environmental and human
security issues emerging because of climate change combined with
increased global interest in the region have **[expanded the range of
policy issues]{.mark}** on the Council's agenda]{.underline} and the
number and diversity of actors involved in its work.

[High-level [cooperation]{.mark} through the Council was
[paused]{.mark}]{.underline} by seven of the Arctic member states in
March 2022 [as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine;
[however]{.mark}, some [activities at the working level]{.mark} have
been able to [continue]{.mark}]{.underline}. Norway began its two-year
chairship of the Council in May 2023 and is focused on finding
opportunities to revitalize more working-level cooperation in the
Council's work.

[The benefits of engaging with and contributing to the climate-related
work of [the Arctic Council can]{.mark} be broken into three main
categories]{.underline}:

[[Research]{.mark} to understand [climate change and inform
mitigation]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Council has three working groups
that conduct scientific assessments in the Arctic related to climate.
The Arctic Monitoring Assessment Programme (AMAP) has a long-term
program of work on the impacts of climate change on Arctic ecosystems
and peoples. This program aggregates the data and analyses of Arctic
states and diverse experts to assess changes at multiple scales (local
to regional). This program of work is also supported by the Conservation
of Flora and Fauna Working Group (CAFF) that concentrates its efforts on
biodiversity and ecosystem impacts and the Protection of Arctic Marine
Environment Working Group (PAME) that seeks to improve knowledge of
marine ecosystems and their functions. In addition to providing policy
advice to its member states, the scientific assessments of these working
groups inform multiple international scientific processes, including the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the Global Biodiversity
Assessment, the Global Methane Assessment, and the World Ocean
Assessment.

[[Risk and emergency management]{.underline}]{.mark}. Climate change
presents direct risks to Arctic communities and ecosystems (extreme
weather events, coastal erosion, wildfires, fish and wildlife population
changes, etc.); sea ice decline also poses indirect risks as a result of
increased vessel traffic and interest in the region's natural resources.
The Arctic is a vast, harsh, and fragile environment that is lightly
populated with well-known infrastructure deficits. In this context,
interjurisdictional coordination and cooperation to support risk and
emergency management is critical. The Council's Emergency Prevention,
Preparedness and Response Working Group (EPPR) provides an important
mechanism to coordinate safety- and emergency-related services and
programs in the Arctic, including support for two regional agreements
negotiated under the auspices of the Arctic Council: the Agreement on
Cooperation on Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue in the Arctic
(2011) and the Agreement on Cooperation on Marine Oil Pollution
Preparedness and Response in the Arctic (2023). PAME also plays an
important role in this area through its marine safety program of work
and its close ties to the International Maritime Organization.

[[Adaptation planning and implementation]{.mark}. Arctic communities and
ecosystems are experiencing **rapid and dramatic effects** from climate
change]{.underline}. Planning for and implementation of adaptation
strategies that are context-specific and led by the communities that
live in the Arctic are critical for long-term resilience. The Council's
Sustainable Development Working Group (SDWG) provides a platform for
identifying the common climate change-related needs and priorities of
Arctic communities, developing capacity, and sharing tools and lessons
learned across the Arctic. The Permanent Participants (Arctic Indigenous
Peoples Organizations) play a particularly strong role in setting the
priorities of the SDWG and contributing to its work. The EPPR and PAME
also contribute to relevant risk assessments, understanding
infrastructure impacts, and adaptation planning in the region.

North American Arctic Cooperation

While the Arctic as a region shares many commonalities, the environment
and communities of the North American Arctic (United States, Canada,
Greenland) face a number of challenges with which the Nordic Arctic has
little or no experience, including dramatic land degradation due to
permafrost thaw, the need to assess immediate and potential community
relocations, and significant infrastructure deficits. Furthermore,
[geographic proximity and like-minded governments make coordination and
collaboration on climate change-related policies and programs both
practical and feasible.]{.underline} The United States undertakes
bilateral cooperation with Canada and Greenland in the Arctic; the
impacts of climate-change combined with current geopolitical
circumstances that constrain circumpolar cooperation may present an
opportunity to establish stronger sub-regional cooperation.

[[This study sought to identify the major barriers to the implementation
of the Agreement on Enhancing International Arctic Scientific
Cooperation]{.mark} (2017) [and to uncover ways of facilitating the
Agreement that may enhance Russia]{.mark}--Japan [scientific cooperation
in the High North]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Russia--Japan case
exemplifies the difficulties as well as the potentials of the Agreement
in enhancing Arctic scientific cooperation between Arctic states and
non-Arctic states. Ultimately, the study identified several possible
ways to facilitate the Agreement's implementation. This paper first
examines these means within the Agreement's legal framework; more
specifically, it explores how to operationalize the effective review
process established under Art.12, utilize the 2000 Japan-Russia
bilateral Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement to implement
Art.17 on 'Cooperation with non-Parties', identify Arctic research
projects and infrastructure available under the Agreement, and designate
appropriate authorities as contact points under Annex 2 of the
Agreement. The paper then examines the potential of linking the
Agreement's implementation with other forums and institutions. [[In
particular, it recognizes the Arctic Council as a platform for enhancing
Arctic scientific cooperation and considers how cooperation within
various Arctic professional organizations and associations may be
revived]{.mark} and how to create synergy between the Agreement and
Arctic Science Ministerial processes.]{.underline} This paper's
discussion is largely based on information and political contexts before
February 24, 2022, but the concluding section provides a few policy
suggestions specific to the implementation of the Agreement in light of
the post-Ukraine situation.

#### Cooperation in the Arctic Council with Russia is key to helping all the Arctic

Returning to the level of cooperation seen prior to 2014 is possible,
but it will be difficult. [The [Russian people are not the enemy]{.mark}
of the West and all [Arctic states]{.mark} will continue to [have an
interest in solving]{.mark} the [problems that are shared by]{.mark} the

process]{.underline}**. The people who live in the Arctic face numerous
challenges, including the impacts of human-made climate change. Today,
the Arctic is warming up faster than any other part of the world.
Climate change, environmental degradation, the need for sustainable
development, food insecurity, and some of the world's highest suicide
rates, are just some of the challenges faced by communities across the
circumpolar North. **[[International cooperation through]{.mark} fora
such as [the Arctic Council play an]{.mark} undeniably [important role
in improving]{.mark} the [lives]{.mark} of the people who live [in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}**. By stepping away from the community of
law-abiding states and by becoming an international outcast like North
Korea, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Eritrea, or Belarus, the Russian
government has chosen to reject the long-term benefits of cooperation
for its people. Moscow has shown a particular vision for the future of
the economic development of the Russian Arctic, a future that emphasizes
the continued extraction of hydrocarbons that are harmful for the
climate, the natural environment and human health. This course of action
might provide short-term economic benefits, but it will come at a high
price - not only for Russia but, due to the impact on climate and the
natural environment, for the whole world, especially for the people who
live in the circumpolar North. Betting the well-being of future
generations on the continued extraction of oil, gas, coal, and other
natural resources, is not only not sustainable, but a mistake of
historic proportions. [[By rejecting]{.mark} fundamental norms of
[international law]{.mark} and the very idea of an international order
that is based on rules, [Russia is risking its own
future]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[The situation that]{.mark} has been [created by]{.mark} the current
government in [Moscow is not permanent]{.mark}. The international
[treaties]{.mark} that [are]{.mark} the fundament of the [international
legal order]{.mark}]{.underline} that has been established in the wake
of World War II still exist and continue to be respected most of the
time by most countries that have ratified them. These treaties continue
to apply. [This includes not only the [treaties that have been
negotiated]{.mark} by the Arctic states [within]{.mark} the framework of
[the Arctic Council]{.mark},]{.underline} but human rights treaties such
as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights19 (ICCPR)
and the European Convention on Human Rights20 (ECHR). [[Russia has not
derogated from these treaties and]{.mark} they [continue to
apply]{.mark}]{.underline}.21 The European Court of Human Rights has
made it clear on multiple occasions that the ECHR also applies in armed
conflicts beyond the borders of the states parties.22 Therefore, the
international human rights obligations, like those that follow from the
ECHR, have to be respected in addition to obligations under
international humanitarian law (IHL).

#### Russia likes the Arctic Council\-\--governance without them increases conflict

**Sukhankin & Lackenbauer \'23** (Sergey -- NAADSN Postdoctoral Fellow,

Russian Perspectives since February 2022\", 08-10-2023, North American

Narrative One: Any Arctic Council decisions adopted without Russia's
participation are illegitimate

This thesis was first articulated by Alexander Kozlov, Russia's Minister
of Natural Resources and Ecology, who stated that [[any Arctic]{.mark}
Council [decisions]{.mark} of the AC [made without Russia will be deemed
**illegitimate (by Russia**]{.mark}) [and could result]{.mark} in dire
consequences for the Arctic region]{.underline}. In his statement,
Kozlov underscored that the aforementioned "**[[serious negative
consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}**" could negatively affect such areas
as sustainable development in the Arctic, the conservation of
biodiversity and local ecosystems, and environmental remediation. In the
same statement, Kozlov also reiterated a point made frequently in
Russian circles prior and after its February 2022 invasion of Ukraine:
Russia still sees the macro-region as a territory of peace and
cooperation and does not consider armed conflict in the macro-region to
be a likely scenario. 14

[[Russia]{.mark}'s]{.underline} Ambassador to the US, Anatoly Antonov,
[also [expressed deep concern about the]{.mark} seven [other]{.mark}
**[A]{.mark}**rctic **[C]{.mark}**ouncil [members' decision to
continue]{.mark} [activities]{.mark} of the organization [without
Russia]{.mark}'s participation]{.underline}. Antonov asserts that this
renders the organization and its decisions illegitimate, as does
violating the founding principles of the Council by deviating from a
consensus-based decision-making process. According to this logic,
decisions made by other members in Russia's absence have no standing as
actual Arctic Council decisions.15

On 10 June 2022, MFA spokesperson Mariya Zakharova attributed what she
described as the West's haphazard and illogical behavior with regard to
Arctic-related issues to a "sense of confusion." She insisted that "any
attempts to isolate Russia in the Arctic are illusory, and \[our\]
Western partners are trying to cling to any ideas just to make an
impression of their independence in Arctic-related matters."16 Deputy
head of the Russian Security Council Dmitry Medvedev made a similar
statement four days later, arguing that the sheer scale of Russia's
Arctic presence (both geographically and demographically) means that any
decisions taken without Russia's participation would have no effect and
that Russia would disregard them.17 On 31 October 2022, Korchunov also
emphasized that "statements by US authorities suggesting that the Arctic
Council could function without Russia are unfounded" and illegitimate.
18

Narrative Two[: [The]{.mark} [West]{.mark}ern state[s]{.mark}' [decision
to "marginalize" Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} (which, according to the
Russian side, stems from the West's irrational reaction to the
developments in Ukraine) [is bound to [result in]{.mark} a [**dramatic
increase of security challenges and disagreements**]{.mark} between
Russia and other Arctic nations.]{.underline}

Prior to 24 February 2022, representatives of Russia's Ministry of
Defence (MOD) and the so-called siloviki faction promoted the "growing
conflict potential in the Arctic" thesis. Over the last eighteen months,
this idea has been widely espoused in Russian diplomatic and civilian
political circles as well. For example, on 5 March 2022 Ambassador
Korchunov unequivocally warned that [[the decision]{.mark} of the other
Arctic states [to halt participation in the]{.mark} **[A]{.mark}**rctic
**[C]{.mark}**ouncil [heightened tensions]{.mark} in the [region and
jeopardized]{.mark} the Arctic [security]{.mark} environment more
generally]{.underline}.19 Later he noted that "Russia is facing a
situation where the seven other Arctic Council states will be NATO
members," posing a serous security challenge to Russia. Korchunov also
asserted that:

NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg \[was\] stepping far beyond the
military-political agenda; he resorts to commenting on the content and
prospects of non-military, purely civilian cooperation between Russia
and other non-Arctic states, such as China. Of course, this cannot leave
us unconcerned, just like the expansion and the intensification of the
alliance's activities in high latitudes.20

Similarly, Russia's Ambassador to Denmark, Vladimir Barbin, noted in
February 2023 that "[[attempts to sideline Russia]{.mark} in terms of
international cooperation [in the Arctic are counterproductive]{.mark}.
[These lead]{.mark} [to]{.mark}ward its [fragmentation]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} are [contribut]{.mark}ing [to]{.mark} generation of
[confrontational moves that]{.mark} are damaging the authority of [the
Arctic Council]{.mark}. [It is **impossible to secure sustainable
development of the Arctic without**]{.mark} its largest actor,
**[Russia]{.mark}**.]{.underline}"21

Narrative Three: [[If the other]{.mark} seven Arctic [states persist in
ignoring Russia]{.mark}, [Russia is ready to abandon the]{.mark}
**[A]{.mark}**rctic **[C]{.mark}**ouncil and may change the format
[and]{.mark} structure of Arctic cooperation by welcoming more input
from nonArctic countries]{.underline}.

On 11 May 2023, Ambassador-at-large for the Arctic Nicolay Korchunov
declared that, if the other seven Arctic states continued to ignore
Russia in the future, it made no sense for Russia to remain a member of
the Arctic Council[. In this case, Russia, as the largest Arctic
country, could create an alternative council on Arctic issues in which
Russia]{.underline} (already purported to be "performing most
Arctic-related actions anyway[") could [invite]{.mark} two socalled
friendly nations, India and [China]{.mark}, [to become key
actor]{.mark}s.]{.underline} Nevertheless, Korchunov noted that [[the
existing]{.mark} **[A]{.mark}**rctic **[C]{.mark}**ouncil
[format]{.mark} as a consultative organ [still works for
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}, given that some consultations continue
despite what the ambassador described as anti-Russian behaviour, thus
allowing the forum to perform its fundamental function.22 While
apparently contradictory, this messaging showed the Russian MFA's
inclination to continue to hedge its bets while also revealing Russia's
growing predilection to court Asian partners.

During the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum (SPIEF)-2023,
Korchunov praised the presence of both Beijing and New Delhi in the
Arctic region and confirmed Russia's readiness to enhance cooperation
with them. As a sign of growing ties between the countries, he mentioned
the emergence of the Russia-Asia Consortium of Arctic Studies (founded
at the Ammosov North-Eastern Federal University) headquartered in
Yakutsk. 23 Korchuvov had previously alluded to Russia's readiness to
reconfigure its international collaboration in the Arctic with
non-Arctic actors on at least two separate occasions. On 26 May 2022, he
hailed Chinese participation in Russia's Arctic projects, suggesting new
forms of Sino-Russian cooperation along the lines of the Arctic Council.
24 On 15 June of that year, he announced that Moscow was consulting on
an ongoing basis with other, non-regional actors on Arctic issues,
noting that "almost all of the BRICS countries" and "many members of the
Big Twenty" expressed an interest in collaborating with Russia on
various issues, ranging from climate change to new transportation
routes.25

Narrative Four: [Western [attempts to marginalize Russia]{.mark} in the
Arctic Council are counterproductive and harmful to Russia's foreign
partners, [caus]{.mark}ing [damage to other Arctic nations]{.mark} but
not to Russia]{.underline}. 26

On 3 March 2023, Korchunov argued that [the pause in the **A**rctic
**C**ouncil meant that "several Arctic countries that do not have the
necessary skills and competences" had already lost "access to Russian
technologies and scientific achievements" in areas such as climate
change and permafrost]{.underline} (citing Finland and Sweden as
specific examples of countries lacking their "own expertise in this
area"). By contrast, he suggested that changes in Arctic Council work
plans did not affect Russia's Arctic research and related capabilities
in any substantive way.27 Similarly, Maksim Dankin, the deputy director
for regional development at the Information and Analytical Centre of the
State Commission for Arctic Development, noted that the seven other
Arctic states' boycott of Russian events hosted under the auspices of
its Arctic Council chairship did "not decrease the effectiveness of
\[our\] work aimed at the development of the Arctic zone."28 These
narratives seek to downplay the effects of the pause on Russia while
suggesting that it has a deleterious effect on the other Arctic states.

Narrative Five: Over time, the West will return to a "business as usual"
model of collaboration with Russia in the Arctic.

Soon after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the
seven other Arctic states paused their participation in Arctic Council
activities, Maria Zakharova called the other Arctic nations' responses
"irrational" and "politicised," suggesting that it "greatly obstructs
joint work on regional development" and undermines collaborative efforts
aimed at improving the "lives of Indigenous people, ensuring sustainable
social-economic development, climate change, implementing programs
associated with the environment, and ... preserving bio diversity."
Zakharova added that "the desire of some countries to 'punish' Russia
will backfire." Accordingly, she encouraged the other Arctic states to
"come to their senses and resume constructive cooperation" in the Arctic
Council. 29 Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov also noted that
[[the]{.mark} future of [effective work in the Council]{.mark}
[depend]{.mark}ed up[on]{.mark} the ability to continue "[civil dialogue
fo]{.mark}r the sake of [preserving the Arctic as a territory of
peace]{.mark}, stability [and]{.mark} constructive
[cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}."30

#### Engaging with Russia in the Arctic Council is key to prevent miscalculation, militarization, arms races, and war

**Gricius \'22** (Gabriella -- Graduate fellow @ North American and
Arctic Defense Security Network, PhD candidate in political science @
Colorado State University, \"Why freezing the Arctic Council is bad news
for global security\", 04-20-2022, Colorado State University Source,
https://source.colostate.edu/why-freezing-the-arctic-council-is-bad-news-for-global-security//phs-maubu)

For the past quarter-century, the Arctic has been a unique zone of
cooperation among the eight countries of the high north: Canada,
Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Russia and the United States.
Even when relations between Moscow and the West soured, the [[Arctic
Council's]{.mark} work [was a reminder that multilateral partnerships
could thrive despite global discord]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The point of the Arctic Council is to foster collaboration in areas such
as scientific research, search and rescue operations and the challenges
posed by climate change. Under its auspices, friends and adversaries
alike -- as well as nonstate actors, such as Indigenous groups -- can
sit down, talk and find common ground. In early 2022, lawmakers from
Norway nominated the council for the Nobel Peace Prize for its
collaborative spirit.

That collaboration ended shortly after Russia's invasion of Ukraine on
Feb. 24, 2022. One week after the start of the war, seven of the eight
Arctic Council members announced that they would "pause" their work with
the organization. Russia, which holds the council's presidency through
2023, was left ostracized.

[The [freeze of the Arctic Council is a loss]{.mark} on many
fronts.]{.underline} As a scholar of Arctic security, I see
[[cooperation]{.mark} in the region as [essential to global
security]{.mark}, and I believe an expanded set of institutions is
needed to reflect new global realities as the Arctic warms.]{.underline}

Security and cooperation in the Arctic

The eight Arctic countries formed the Arctic Council in 1996. While the
council explicitly steers clear of military issues, its members are
stewards of the Arctic region. Unsurprisingly, the organization has
grown in importance with global warming.

[Warmer temperatures and declining sea ice are opening new shipping
routes and, likely, expanding opportunities to exploit oil, gas and
other critical minerals -- changes that could spur conflict if not
handled carefully.]{.underline}

Through the council, the Arctic states have made agreements related to
search and rescue operations, oil pollution and scientific
collaboration. The council has tracked environmental changes in the
region with its yearly Arctic Climate Impact Assessment reports. Even
when relations between East and West were at their worst, including in
2014 when Russia invaded and annexed the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine,
joint endeavors in the Arctic remained strong.

[[Pausing]{.mark} the work of [the Arctic Council]{.mark}]{.underline}
was an understandable response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Yet in
doing so, the other Arctic countries [[lost a]{.mark} **valuable [line
of communication with Moscow]{.mark}**. In time, [it will be important
to resume the council]{.mark}]{.underline} or establish a new
institution in its place.

Indeed, working with Russia in the Arctic is even more important now
than it was before the invasion. From a global security perspective, it
is essential that the hot war in Europe be prevented from spilling over
into the Arctic and one of the world's last wildernesses.

The case for engaging Russia

Consider, for example, [that [while tensions are]{.mark} at an all-time
[high in Ukraine]{.mark}, [it might be easy to mistake]{.mark} a flock
of [geese or a meteor]{.mark} shower [for a military attack]{.mark}.
[Having a way for errors]{.mark} like these [to be]{.mark} quickly
[remedied will be important]{.mark} in this new era of geopolitical
competition]{.underline}.

Preserving and enhancing cooperation in the Arctic will take bold
leadership. Some critics argue that institutionalizing military dialogue
with Russia in the Arctic is an improper response to wanton aggression
in Eastern Europe and could be seen as legitimizing Russia's actions.
These are valid concerns.

However, [[giving up on cooperation would be a mistake]{.mark}.
[The]{.mark} whole [world will benefit if the high north can
avoid]{.mark} the fate of [militarization]{.mark}, [a costly arms race
and]{.mark} the terrible specter of [war]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Multilateral governance through the Arctic Council is best for all Arctic States

reconstruction. He works as an international trade attorney and serves

Arctic States Can Achieve Dispute Resolution Using Existing Legal
Frameworks", Ocean and Coastal Law Journal 2022,
https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4125765

Second, [instead of unilateral action, Canada and Norway should work
through the IMO, where "tough laws" on marine protection can be
replicated in a "multilateral context]{.underline}."202 Finally, the
2010 delimitation treaty between Norway and Russia may serve as a model
for how individual states can resolve bilateral disputes to clear the
way for more concerted action on common issues challenging Arctic
governance.

The danger of armed conflict among the Arctic States is very low. The
real danger confronting the Arctic is a rush for resources across
unsettled boundaries and Arctic States' reactionary responses, all of
which has the potential to break down long-standing norms within the law
of the sea and expose the sensitive region to further environmental
degradation already heightened by climate change. Yet, assertions by
environmentally- conscious states that they have interests beyond their
borders will lead to unpredictable outcomes where there are no rules to
accommodate their purported interests.

[The [Arctic States]{.mark} have signaled that they [wish to]{.mark}
remain the [manage]{.mark}rs of [this]{.mark} increasingly complex
[region by]{.mark} progressively formalizing [the Arctic
Council]{.mark}'s structure]{.underline}. But to retain its leadership
role, the Council and its members will have to make commitments to each
other and to the international rules-based order. In practice, the
Arctic States should treat the Council as a regional security system,
recognizing that their individual economic and military security is
dependent on their immediate neighbors' own security. In the event of
environmental or natural disasters, they will be more reliant on each
other than on external actors. Clearly, [[it is in the Arctic States'
interests]{.mark}---individually and collectively---[for the Arctic
Council to remain]{.mark} indispensable to [Arctic governance and the
**sole gatekeeper to the Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The Arctic States should be quick to prevent an incremental fait
accompli through the use of meritless environmental claims which result
in dramatic changes to the geopolitical environment. But they also
should not mistake defensive measures for offensive ones. Russia and
Canada both are experiencing an unparalleled shift in defense strategy
as the entire lengths of their northern borders become suddenly exposed
to the threat of armed force.203 Reestablishing northern bases is as
much a form of early- warning detection as it is an attempt at power
projection. Canada and Russia can be expected to continue asserting
their claims to internal waters or EEZ regulatory rights, respectively,
if for no other reason than to delay the inevitable transit or innocent
passage of foreign ships along their coasts. Building trust through
regional collective action in the Arctic Council will ease these
insecurities over time.

Together, the Arctic States should also make clear that the Arctic Ocean
should not be treated differently than other comparable bodies of water
under international law. It is home to a number of states' territorial
seas as defined by UNCLOS. Claims, like China's, that the Arctic is "a
community with a shared future for mankind" implicitly undermine that
regime.

Yet, some of the Arctic States themselves are inviting outside actors
into the region in ways that serve the outsiders' agendas. Arctic States
should be wary of outside actors' large-scale investments which allow
them to wield outsized influence in the region. Iceland and Greenland
have welcomed investments by China.204 But those investments come with
significant leverage, giving a non-Arctic State a foothold in the region
which it parleyed into an observer seat on the Arctic Council.205 In a
self- perpetuating cycle, outside states' increased participation in
Arctic governance justifies their presence in the Arctic, which further
justifies their taking on greater responsibilities, which will
eventually dilute Arctic States' power within this governance structure.

Expansive environmental protection--based claims may also serve to
reinforce the justifications used by outside actors to claim roles in
Arctic governance. Indeed, outside states' professed interest in
conducting climate change research rings hollow when it is self-evident
that they are lured to the Arctic by deposits of rare earth minerals and
untapped reserves of oil and natural gas.206

[To be successful, Arctic States' [strategy]{.mark} for the Arctic must
be values- driven, not interest-driven. As such, it [must be removed
from]{.mark} the parochial [concerns of individual states]{.mark} and
based in upholding international legal regimes.]{.underline} Canada
should not use its indigenous population as a cudgel to beat away
compliance with UNCLOS. [[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[should]{.mark} not resurrect Cold War--era fears to stimulate, or
perpetuate, an Arctic arms race. Informed threat assessment and [trust
in the **multilateral**]{.mark} Arctic Council [framework, which has
fostered collaboration for decades]{.mark}]{.underline}, will help the
United States and other Arctic States avoid an "ideologically driven
blunder."207

#### Russian [exclusion]{.underline} spells the end of arctic [multilateralism]{.underline} which results in permanent [militarization]{.underline}.

On March 3, 2022, [[seven]{.mark} of the eight Arctic
**[Council]{.mark}** member [states]{.mark}]{.underline}, the A7---
Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, United
States---[announced an **historic**, unanimous **[boycott]{.mark}** of
[Council participation]{.mark}]{.underline} in [protest [of
Russia]{.mark}'s **invasion** of **Ukraine**]{.underline}, after just
over twenty-five years of continuous operations since the Council's
inaugural meeting in Ottawa on September 19, 1996.

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

While this is the first time all seven democratic Arctic states agreed
to suspend participation in all Arctic Council (AC) activities, back in
April 2014, after Russia's first assault upon Ukraine, the United States
and Canada jointly boycotted a meeting of the AC's Task Force for Action
on Black Carbon and Methane (TFBCM) held in Moscow, but soon rejoined
their fellow Council members. As Canadian Environment Minister Leona
Aglukkaq explained then, Ottawa (and Washington, as well) was taking a
"principled stand" by not attending, marking the first time---but not
the last---the conflict in Ukraine disrupted the long tradition of
Arctic cooperation at the Council. The March 3rd decision by the A7 was
one of many similar decisions by countless organizations around the
world, part of a quickly-achieved and near-global consensus to isolate
Russia in protest of its naked and unprovoked aggression against its
neighbour. However, the A7 decision caught several of the Arctic
Council's Permanent Participant organizations, representing the
Indigenous Peoples in the region, by surprise as they were not
consulted. Th is was a break with the spirit and long tradition of the
Arctic Council, which stands fi rst among the world's many
intergovernmental forums for its eff orts to unite state and Indigenous
interests, and for elevating state--Indigenous consultation to the
highest of normative values. While unequal in their institutional power,
with the eight founding member states (the A8) holding all of the formal
power, the Permanent Participants are essential partners in the
formation of the consensus that defines Arctic Council governance, and
they have played a vital and important role in both the formation of the
Arctic Council in 1996, and in its operations in the quarter century
since. Indeed, the stability of the Arctic region owes much to the
spirit of collaborative governance that aligns Indigenous and state
interests, as reflected in the Arctic Council's structure as well as in
other novel and innovative governing institutions across the Circumpolar
Arctic. While surprised, most of the Permanent Participants endorsed the
decision made by the democratic Arctic states, but not all with the same
level of enthusiasm, and most expressing concern for the future of
Arctic cooperation. One of the Permanent Participants, the Russian
Association of Indigenous Peoples of the North (RAIPON), viewed now by
many as a mouthpiece for, and controlled by, Putin's government in
Moscow, came out in full and enthusiastic support of Moscow's
"peacemaking" eff ort in Ukraine. Th is outraged a network ofIndigenous
leaders in involuntary exile from Russia who were formerly associated
with RAIPON. Th ey issued their own counter statement ten days later
while also announcing the formation of their own parallel organization
to fi ll the vacuum created by RAIPON's lost legitimacy and what they
believe is its outrageous support for Russia's unjust assault on Ukraine
Th e Boycott: A Temporary Pause in Quest of New Modalities or Permanent
Collapse in Arctic Cooperation? According to the March 3rd announcement,
jointly released by offi cials in the seven democratic Arctic states:
"Canada, the Kingdom of Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden, and
the United States condemn Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine and
note the grave impediments to international cooperation, including in
the Arctic, that Russia's actions have caused."1 Th ey reasserted their
conviction of the enduring value of the Arctic Council for circumpolar
cooperation and reiterate our support for this institution and its work.
We hold a responsibility to the people of the Arctic, including the
Indigenous Peoples, who contribute to and benefi t from the important
work undertaken in the Council.2 Th eir brief statement concluded by
explaining that the core principles of sovereignty and territorial
integrity, based on international law, have long underpinned the work of
the Arctic Council, a forum which Russia currently chairs. In light of
Russia's fl agrant violation of these principles, our representatives
will not travel to Russia for meetings of the Arctic Council.
Additionally, our states are temporarily pausing participation in all
meetings of the Council and its subsidiary bodies, pending consideration
of the necessary modalities that can allow us to continue the Council's
important work in view of the current circumstances.3

[After Russia invaded Ukraine]{.underline} in late February 2022 and
unleashed chaos to the heart of Europe on a scale unseen since the
Second World War (and exceeding the kinetic destruction of Yugoslavia's
collapse if not yet its scale of human atrocities), introducing
unprecedented risk to the global order---on the question of how or even
whether to engage with Russia most of the world has responded with an
instinctive, passionate, and near-unanimous nyet. In the case of the
boycott of the [Arctic **Council** by the A7, [presented as a
**temporary** pause]{.mark} but [**without** a **timeline**]{.mark} for
when a reset will again be conceivable]{.underline}, this [nyet would
[optimally mean **not yet** rather than **never**]{.mark}]{.underline},
and the [[**wording** of the boycott]{.mark} and the quest for new
modalities]{.underline} it mentioned [[**indicates** a **future**
is]{.mark} in the realm of the **finite**]{.underline} [and [not]{.mark}
the [infinite]{.mark}]{.underline} or never-ending. But even a
[[**temporary** not yet could be for an **indeterminate**
period]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is by definition a period with no
known end point, putting into question for the first time since 1996 the
very future of the Arctic Council.

This was not the case in 2014 when the Canadian and US boycott was for a
single meeting in Moscow. To ensure there is a second twenty-five years
for the Arctic Council, it is [[**imperative** that]{.mark} the A7's
[**not yet** be as **brief** a period as is diplomatically]{.mark} and
politically [possible]{.mark}]{.underline}. Given a protracted war with
Russia and the potential for it to draw in NATO, it seems likely that a
resumption of face-to-face meetings among the whole of the A8 is
unlikely again under Russia's two-year rotating chair, which concludes
in 2023. All things considered, a year-long boycott need not mean the
end of the Arctic Council or its mutual vision of a cooperative and
peaceful Arctic with Russia's full and active participation, which only
became possible at the end of the Cold War when tensions with Moscow
declined. [But any [cessation of]{.mark} the Arctic
[**Council**'s]{.mark} exemplary consensual [alignment of
interests]{.mark}]{.underline} and values among a diverse range of
states and Indigenous organizations, and which [includes an even
**wider** array of Observers, both state and non-state
entities]{.underline}, from around the world, [[is worrisome]{.mark}. If
[Russia remains a **pariah**]{.mark}]{.underline} [beyond such a limited
time frame, that could [spell the **end** of]{.mark} a truly
[exceptional **vision** of Arctic
**collab**]{.mark}**oration**]{.underline} [[and]{.mark} an innovative
**experiment** in inclusive, multi-level, [multilat]{.mark}eral
**[diplomacy]{.mark}**. The Arctic [**Council** was]{.mark}]{.underline}
among [[the **best**]{.underline}]{.mark} of what the [post-Cold War
world]{.underline} achieved, [[and worth
**preserving**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Preserving A Peaceful Arctic in a World at WarTh is is not to diminish
the gravity of events in Ukraine, the clear and present danger to NATO
itself, or the spectre of total war that could result from a collapse of
the post-Cold War order, let alone the human tragedy unfolding across
Ukraine in the many months since Russia launched its invasion. But the
Arctic Council is a unique organization, with legitimacy that extends
across the entirety of the Circumpolar World---from the western tip of
the Aleutian Islands all the way to the eastern tip of
Siberia---spanning a diverse mosaic of states, Indigenous Peoples,
remote environments, and fragile ecosystems undergoing an historic
climatic transition. Th e Council brings together the eight founding
Arctic states---of which Russia, with its eleven time zones, is the most
vast and Iceland the smallest---and includes within its innovative
governance structure the six aforementioned Indigenous Peoples'
organizations, the Permanent Participants, providing them with much infl
uence and a voice at the table, together with a diverse range of
Observers, both state and non-state. Observer status allows countries as
far away as Singapore, and as consequential to the world economy as
China, an opportunity to participate, regardless of their domestic
governing structures or ideologies---and in the case of China, in spite
of its track record of oppressing minority peoples (such as Xinjiang) or
the lingering legacies of invasions past (Tibet), even if a cause of
symbolic diplomatic boycotts such as the absence of top offi cials at
the Beijing Olympics. Moreover, the issues facing the Arctic, of which
climate change is perhaps the most pressing for all stakeholders, small
and large, cannot be paused. Nor should they be. And excluding Russia
from any discussions, with the Russian Arctic representing some half the
Arctic's geographical extent, would render the Council's eff orts
substantially reduced. Th ere are no half-way solutions to the future of
the Arctic, whether it's peacetime or wartime. Even during the peak of
the COVID-19 pandemic, the Council managed to meet virtually, fi nding
like so many others that vast distances could be overcome through
digital connections. Somehow the Arctic felt less vast, less isolated,
at a moment when it was more cut off from the rest of the world than it
had been for generations. And while Russia's actions in Ukraine are
reprehensible, putting at risk the post-Cold War order---of which the
formation of the Arctic Council was an exemplary and illustrative
moment---stopping the Council's operations now because Russia presently
holds its rotating chair seems as illogical as shuttering the UN General
Assembly or putting a pause on meetings of the Security Council.
Intergovernmental bodies are the one space in world politics where
rivals and opponents can meet face to face, even in times of war. Their
business does not stop when hostilities commence; oftentimes, their
responsibilities multiply manifold at such times. We need the Arctic
Council no less today than we did before the Ukraine invasion and may
indeed need it more than ever. Arctic Council members find unity in
their diversity and approach their Arctic borders with a collaborative
spirit seldom found along borders further south. Th e challenge, of
course, is in minimizing tensions across Arctic borders, at a time when
one of the Arctic states is at war with a neighbour that is on friendly
terms with the other Arctic states. This is no easy feat. But it is not
the fi st time there has been strategic dissension at the top of the
world; indeed, with five of the eight Arctic Council members part of the
NATO alliance (Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and the United States),
there can hardly be a day without strategic dissension in the Arctic
even at the best of times. And yet, the Arctic has been one of the most
stable regions of the world, despite the pre-existing condition of
strategic competition. Indeed, there was a time not long ago when the
Arctic Council confronted a deep division in its ranks that threatened
the very consensus that serves as the bedrock of its successful fi st
quarter century. Th at member challenged the accepted consensus among
all the Council's other stakeholders (member states, Permanent
Participants, and Observers alike). After two impressive decades of
sustained consensus in good times and bad, that member state broke ranks
with that unanimity---and in so doing, made it impossible for a joint
declaration to emerge from a ministerial meeting for the very first
time. Th at time was just three years ago: in 2019. Th e founding member
state was not Russia, but the United States. And the issue that drove a
wedge between the US and its fellow Arctic Council members and other
stakeholders was a change in policy on climate change, long a unifying
issue for all Arctic Council stakeholders and the most pressing and
salient issue before the Council and, many believe, confronting
humanity. Despite this collapse in consensus, the Council---with its
meaningful and enduring bridges of communication and collaboration
between a diverse array of Arctic stakeholders, from the village to the
national to the tribal to the transnational level---survived, and only a
few short years later, consensus was fully restored. Th e organization
proved as resilient as the diverse collective of Arctic peoples, states,
cultures, and organizations it represents. Over a decade earlier, that
same Arctic Council outlier, the United States, went to war half a world
away from the Arctic, bringing along a coalition of partners in its
quest to rid Iraq of a fi ctitious Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD)
program and to depose its autocratic leader, sinking the Middle East
region into chaos that would last a generation and which would see a
stable, autocratic Iraq collapse into a failed state and become a
breeding ground of terror, ultimately providing al-Qaeda with an
opportunity it had not found before, and yielding the emergence of the
Islamic State caliphate, which required a brutal air war to dismantle.
Across Iraq and Syria, a generation has endured unprecedented bloodshed
and destruction, all a direct result of America's own war of choice
build on a foundation of lies. At the top of the world, however, the
Arctic remained united and cooperative, and the US and Russia each
contributed their part to the enduring Arctic peace, even as their
proxies battled violently across the Middle East. America's wars may
have been framed as wars of self-defence, much the way Moscow now frames
its current war, and wars to pre-empt WMD programs (much as Moscow now
echoes, seizing control of nuclear plants while cautioning against
seemingly fi ctitious Ukrainian chemical weapons programs). It's as if
we've seen this story before. But because it is Moscow on the off
ensive, and not the United States, the world is reacting diff erently to
a similarly tragic and disingenuous masquerade. With Russia on the war
path, a path Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin describes as a
"noble cause," having launched what much of the rest of the world---what
many observers describe as a re-emergent "Free World," as New York Times
columnist Th omas Friedman has described it4 ---sees as an undeniable,
unjustifi able, unprovoked war of aggression, that once again challenges
the consensus that has so long united the Arctic world, we are back to
this very same precipice of a collapsing Arctic consensus like we saw
just three years earlier when America unilaterally quit the global
coalition against climate change. Th e brutal confl ict presently
unfolding is diff erent in nearly every way from that previous
disagreement at the Arctic Council's 2019 ministerial meeting in
Rovaniemi, Finland, but the stakes are perhaps comparable, if
imperfectly so---the future of humanity is once again at stake, and
consensus on unifying values is once again eluding a single yet
essential member of the circumpolar family. And while this comparison
will not be greeted with equal receptiveness amidst the current crisis
unfolding across Ukraine at the hand of Russian aggression, the moral
scale of both global challenges (Ukraine and climate change) has an
equivalency of risk even if not the same palpable sense of immediacy. Th
e Arctic Council: A Quarter Century of Arctic Cooperation Th e Ottawa
Declaration, formally titled the "Declaration on the Establishment of
the Arctic Council," was promulgated by the eight Arctic
states---Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, the Russian
Federation, Sweden, and the United States of America---in 1996, in which
they affi rmed the following: • commitment to the well-being of the
inhabitants of the Arctic, including special recognition of the special
relationship and unique contributions to the arctic of indigenous people
and their communities; • commitment to sustainable development in the
Arctic region, including economic and social development, improved
health conditions and cultural well-being; • commitment to the
protection of the Arctic environment, including the health of Arctic
ecosystems, maintenance of biodiversity in the Arctic region and
conservation and sustainable use of natural resources. And recognized: •
the contributions of the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy to
these commitments; • the traditional knowledge of the Indigenous people
of the Arctic and their communities and taking note of its importance
and that of Arctic science and research to the collective understanding
of the circumpolar Arctic; and • the valuable contribution and support
of the Inuit Circumpolar Conference, Saami Council, and the Association
of the Indigenous Minorities of the North, Siberia, and the Far East 144
The Northern Review 54 \| 2023 of the Russian Federation in the
development of the Arctic Council.5 Th e Arctic states also expressed
their mutual desire "to provide a means for promoting cooperative
activities to address Arctic issues requiring circumpolar cooperation,
and to ensure full consultation with and the involvement of Indigenous
people and their communities and other inhabitants of the Arctic in such
activities;" and "to provide for regular intergovernmental consideration
of and consultation on Arctic issues."6 Th ey thereby declared the
establishment of the Arctic Council as a high level forum to: provide a
means for promoting cooperation, coordination and interaction among the
Arctic States, with the involvement of the Arctic Indigenous communities
and other Arctic inhabitants on common Arctic issues, in particular
issues of sustainable development and environmental protection in the
Arctic; oversee and coordinate the programs established under the AEPS
on the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program (AMAP); Conservation of
Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF); Protection of the Arctic Marine
Environment (PAME); and Emergency Prevention, Preparedness and Response
(EPPR); adopt terms of reference for, and oversee and coordinate a
sustainable development program; \[and\] disseminate information,
encourage education and promote interest in Arctic related issues.7 In
addition to the eight member states, the Ottawa Declaration also
designated in paragraph 2 that the "Inuit Circumpolar Conference, the
Saami Council and the Association of Indigenous Minorities of the North,
Siberia and the Far East of the Russian Federation are Permanent
Participants in the Arctic Council" and that "\[p\]ermanent
participation equally is open to other Arctic organizations of
indigenous peoples with majority Arctic indigenous constituency,
representing: a single indigenous people resident in more than one
Arctic State; or more than one Arctic indigenous people resident in a
single Arctic state."8 Th is inclusive defi nition made possible the
variation in ethnic composition of the Permanent Participant
organizations as well as the variation in scale, from representing as
few as several thousand constituents like the Aleut International
Association (AIA) and the Gwich'in Council International (GCI) from a
single Indigenous People, to over a quarter million constituents from
over forty Indigenous Peoples like RAIPON. Once the Council determines
"that such an organization Zellen \| The Arctic Council & the Ukraine
War 145 has met this criterion," the Ottawa Declaration capped the total
number of PP groups to "at any time be less than the number of members."
And since the Arctic states number eight, there can be no more than
seven PPs, one more than the present six.9 While Permanent Participants
lack the agency of member states to implement Arctic policies, many PPs
or components thereof have achieved formal governing powers within their
home states owing to an impressive variety of institutional powers,
whether constitutional, legislative, or co-managerial. Indeed, at the
local and regional levels, their powers often are represented by a local
or regional level of governance or greatly overlap therewith. Th is
further fulfi lls the aspiration of the Ottawa Declaration that the
"category of Permanent Participant is created to provide for active
participation and full consultation with the Arctic Indigenous
representatives within the Arctic Council."10 In addition to the Arctic
states and the PPs, the Ottawa Declaration also recognized three
categories of Observers that include "non-Arctic states;
inter-governmental and inter-parliamentary organizations, global and
regional; and non-governmental organizations that the Council determines
can contribute to its work."11

The Arctic Council at 25: Lessons for the Next 25 Years

[[If]{.mark} the Arctic [**Council** can **survive**]{.mark} the
[collapse of the **climate** **consensus**]{.mark}]{.underline} that was
forged at its inclusive and consensual table during its first quarter
century, and which came to define it in its expansive circumpolar agenda
from 1996 to 2021, there is [[no reason it can't do the same]{.mark}
again.]{.underline} Indeed, [[it **must** do so]{.mark} and soon.
[**Russia** is the largest]{.mark} of the [Arctic
state]{.mark}s]{.underline}, with the largest Arctic population and most
diverse Arctic economy and mosaic of cultures. Its [portion of the
Arctic [represents]{.mark} fully [half the Circumpolar
World]{.mark}]{.underline}. It [took the **collapse** of the **Soviet**
**Union** to allow for the close **collab**oration that the Arctic
**Council**]{.underline} nurtured, with its new model of inclusive
diplomacy bridging the state--Indigenous interface. But the foundations
of the Arctic Council took root well before the Cold War ended, and its
founding vision was articulated eloquently by the last Soviet premier,
Mikhail Gorbachev, in his famed Murmansk speech in 1987. The boundary
line separating the US from the USSR (and now Russia), which was
negotiated by the last Soviet foreign minister, Eduard Shevardnadze,
with his American counterpart, George Shultz, has been respected by both
postCold War United States and Russia since 1990, laying a stable
foundation on what could otherwise be a volatile border. Th e current
[[shipping lane through the Bering]{.mark} Strait [was jointly
negotiated]{.mark}]{.underline} by the United States and Russia,
reflecting the ongoing stability on this Arctic frontier, with the US
Coast Guard and the Border Guard Service of Russia developing a laudable
bilateral relationship that contrasts with so many of Russia's other
borders. [This [says something about]{.mark} the fundamental [importance
of Arctic]{.mark} [collaboration to world **order**]{.mark}, regardless

As bad as things are now, and as bad as they might become in the current

[**Council's** op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark} altogether]{.underline}, nor
to stop meeting with all of the Arctic Council's diverse and important
stakeholders, whether states, Indigenous Peoples' organizations, or
NGOs. Framing the A7's suspension as a pause in quest of new modalities
does seem to create a window of hope that the Council will find its way
toward a resumption of its important business. As shocking as Russian
President Vladimir Putin's recent threat to fellow Arctic Council member
states Finland and Sweden on their consideration of NATO membership; as
worrisome as the recent [[Russian military **exercise** in]{.mark} the

[[Certain]{.mark} types of [solutions have been **successfully** used to

**multilateral**]{.mark} issue-specific [agreements]{.mark}; regulated
frameworks; the use or creation of specific agencies, institutions, and

[academics tend to prefer multifunctional, multi institutional, and
cross-sectoral solutions that promise more equitable and longer-lasting
results]{.mark}]{.underline}.3 They are, however, complicated to
negotiate and time-consuming to achieve. In many cases, policymakers
will be better off to settle first on temporary or partial solutions.
Analysts and politicians alike should also keep in mind that no one
solution fits all problems or even all conflicts of one type or of the
same region. Nor is there a dispute for which there exists one specific
tailor-made answer. A special difficulty for solving conflicts in the
Arctic is its rapid and complicated transformation. It is difficult to
imagine a time in the foreseeable future when the region will provide a
firm basis for conflict resolution. WHO OWNS THE ARCTIC?4 In 1959, 12
countries signed an Antarctic treaty that \"froze\" all territorial
claims in the Antarctic. While member countries enjoy the liberty of

prohibits any military activities in Antarctica.5 No binding decision
existed on the status of the Arctic Ocean and the northern territories
bordering it. Because the Arctic?in contrast to the south polar
region?mostly consists of ice-covered seas, clarifications of its status
as well as territorial claims were less imperative. In 1925, the
government of Canada became the first to extend its boundaries northward
to the pole and to claim sovereignty over the sector between 6o? west
and 1410 west longitude. In the following year Russia fixed in law a
claim for the sector between 32?o4\'35\" and i68?49\'3o\" west,
basically for the purpose of claiming the islands north of the Siberian
coast. Other countries followed suit. To prevent a territorial
partitioning of the Arctic Ocean, the European Union and a number of
academic authors have argued in favour of a comprehensive convention,
modelled after the Antarctic treaty. Others have suggested developing
joint practices of stewardship for the polar region that can be further
institutionalized and may eventually lead to a regime.6 For two reasons,
however, it may be too late for joint governance. First, the Arctic is
not one all-embracing region, but rather a set of sub-regions in which
different conditions reign. And second, in their 2008 Ilulissat
declaration the five Arctic states with frontage on the Arctic Ocean
(Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia, and the United States) all insisted on
sovereign rights over their northern lands, waters, shelves, and the
living as well as material resources. At the same time, they pledged to
settle their differences in accordance with international law, above all
according to the UN convention on the law of the sea (UNCLOS).7 At a
second meeting of the Arctic Ocean states in Chelsea, Quebec, in March
2010, they reaffirmed their commitment to the orderly settlement of any
overlapping claims. With these declarations, the Arctic states have
excluded the option of an all-compassing multilateral treaty comparable
to the Antarctic treaty.8 UNCLOS does not recognize the sector principle
with regard to sea boundaries, but suggests instead that the median
lines of the seaward extensions of land boundaries should designate the
borders of territorial waters and their 200 nautical miles. Article 76
of UNCLOS provides that 5 Antarctic treaty, 1 December 1959, www.ats.ag.

exclusive economic zone of up to 350 nautical miles if they can prove
that their continental shelf extends that far out into the sea. In the
polar region, this clause makes for a number of overlapping claims.
Before coming into effect, they have to be endorsed by scientific
expertise from the UN commission on the limits of the continental shelf.
So far, Russia and Norway have submitted requests. Moscow, however, has
been advised by the commission that it needed to provide additional
morphological data before its claims could be considered. Norway has
received a legally non-binding recommendation from the commission that
supports Oslo\'s claims of an extended shelf in the Barents Sea, the
Norwegian Sea, and the Atlantic Ocean. The commission has recognized
that the \"loophole\" in the Barents Sea was part of both the Norwegian
and the Russian coastal shelf but has left it to both states to reach a
political settlement on their competing claims. In April 2010, much to
the surprise of observers, both states agreed on the delimitation of
their Barents Sea boundary.9 Canada and Denmark are preparing
submissions, cooperating closely with each other. These cooperative
moves should be encouraged and assisted by further confidence-building
measures. CLUSTERS OF CONFLICTS IN THE ARCTIC UNCLOS provides a binding
legal regime for the Arctic Ocean, but its regulatory framework gives no
advice on how to settle bi- or multilateral conflicts on sea boundaries
or the status of waterways.10 The convention requires little more than
that its signatories follow the principle of equity and take relevant
circumstances into account. (Sea) boundary conflicts Moving from west to
east, the maritime boundary between the United States and Russia from
the Bering Sea into the Arctic Ocean has not been established
conclusively. In June 1990, Washington and Moscow signed a boundary
agreement in which they settled on a compromise between a 9 \"Agreement

strict median line, the Soviet Union agreed that the US should exercise
exclusive economic jurisdiction over one small area east of this line,
while the opposite arrangement was recognized for two other areas.11 In
spite of domestic criticism that the administration had squandered
territory originally discovered by America? such as Wrangell Island?the
treaty was ratified by the US senate, but not by the Soviet/Russian
duma. The current government in Moscow sticks to the position that the
agreement was signed by former Soviet Foreign Minister Shevardnadze and
that Russia need not feel bound to it. Moreover, Moscow claims that
Russia\'s boundaries had essentially been determined by a 16 April 1926
decree in which the Soviet Union claimed all lands and islands in the
Arctic Ocean sector between 320 34\' and 1680 4\' west. This position
testifies to Moscow\'s aversion to multilateral regulatory arrangements.
It prefers instead a national implementation of international
obligations. Though the US would have been better off with a boundary
following a strict median line between the continents, it saw neither a
need nor an opportunity to reopen the case. Rather, Washington has
called on Russia intermittently to ratify the 1990 treaty. As long as no
oil or gas explorations are planned in the disputed area, the issue is
not on the American radar screen. The same is true for Russia; its
current policy centres around extending its coastal shelf out into the
Arctic Ocean. How could Russia be induced to recognize and ratify the
1990 agreement, which would give both countries greater assurance for
their long-term planning on resource exploitation? When the US and
Russia have felt that an issue needed urgent attention in the past they
have been able to reach an agreement, such as the bilateral moratorium
on pollock fishing in 1992. Griffiths has suggested eliciting US and
Russian interest in a joint declaration of principles on Arctic policies
along the lines of the 1972 American-Soviet basic principles\'
agreement, in which both committed themselves \"to practice restraint in
their relations toward each other and toward all countries, and pursue a
policy dedicated toward stability and peace.\"12 A similar declaration
could serve as an act of confidence-building and create an international
environment conducive to treaty ratification. n \"Agreement between the
United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on
the maritime boundary,\" l June 1990, in Delimitation Treaties InfoBase,
United Nations, DOALOS/OLA. 12 Griffiths, \"Towards a Canadian Arctic
strategy,\" 14-15. Griffiths argues that this agreement was intended to
encourage the other partner to cooperate in exchange for security
reassurances. I might also be useful for other Arctic boundary
conflicts. But in contrast to the example of the lead-up to detente,
these issues do not currently attract sufficient attention in either
capital to warrant the effort. Because of the area\'s rich oil and
natural gas reserves, the dispute between the United States and Canada
in the Beaufort Sea is more urgent. The disagreement is on the extension
of the maritime border between Alaska and Yukon through the 200 nautical
mile exclusive economic zone and on sovereign rights over a
triangular-shaped area of about 6250 square nautical miles. Canada
argues that its maritime boundary in the Beaufort Sea was settled by the
1825 convention between Great Britain and tsarist Russia that defined
the border between Alaska and Yukon as following the 1410 west meridian
\"as far as the frozen ocean.\"13 Washington, however, argues that no
maritime border has yet been legally defined; if it were to be set, it
should follow the median line between the two coastlines?which would
give the US a large area with potentially rich natural resources at
Canada\'s expense. A compromise has been somewhat complicated by
Ottawa\'s agreement with the indigenous people that uses the 1410
meridian as Nunavut\'s western maritime border. Thus, the Inuit
peoples\' representations will have to be involved in any agreement.
Except for occasional flare-ups, the level of conflict is relatively
low. But this could change when the ice retreats and economic
opportunities increase. For more than 100 years, the US and Canada have
seen each other as partners, not enemies. In 1908 and 1909, both states
created a number of bilateral institutions to aid conflict management.
During the east-west conflict they set up a joint air defence
system?NORAD?and more recently a binational planning group. Today
agreement has been somewhat complicated by a strong trend of
anti-Americanism among segments of the Canadian public; some Canadians
are more concerned about US than Russian infringements of sovereignty. A
constructive solution, however, should not be impossible to reach. One
promising approach is the joint Canadian-American expedition to explore
the seabed in the Beaufort Sea. Aside from assisting them in submitting
a joint application to the commission on the extension of coastal
shelves?though the US has yet to ratify UNCLOS?it might also help settle
the boundary issue. Irrespective of legal dissent, the state of Alaska
in 2007 publicly auctioned prospecting and drilling licenses in the
Beaufort Sea and leased several of them to Canadian firms. 13

prospect of Soviet/Russian aggression," (Greaves and Pomerants 2017,
36). [Arctic]{.underline} military [[issues]{.mark} being [discussed in
NATO]{.mark}]{.underline} is thus [inherently]{.underline} going to
[**[exclude Russia]{.mark}** [and send a signal]{.mark} to them [of
**aggression**]{.mark}]{.underline}, or at the least of a lack of
interest in cooperation. [NATO's involvement in the Arctic and
[Russia's]{.mark}]{.underline} resulting [[interpretation]{.mark} of
Western aggression [increases]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[potential for
escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, possibly [under a **security
dilemma**]{.underline}; "an Arctic security dilemma could still arise,
especially for Russia. With the other Arctic Ocean states all being NATO
members, it is easy for Russia to see itself in a situation of
four-against-one\... As Canadian lieutenant colonel Todd L. Sharp has
said, '[a more direct role \[for [NATO]{.mark}\] [in Arctic]{.mark}
[security will be met with Russian resistance]{.mark} and
will]{.underline} serve to further [[**destabilize** the
region]{.underline}]{.mark} rather than contribute to greater
security.'" (Byers and Covey 2019). Despite this, [[without]{.mark} [the
A]{.mark}rctic [C]{.mark}ouncil [as a]{.mark}n inclusive
[forum]{.mark}]{.underline} for discussing Arctic security matters,
[[NATO]{.underline} [continues]{.underline}]{.mark} [to be]{.underline}
the place [where]{.underline} those [discussions happen]{.underline}. At
the 2024 Arctic Circle Assembly, an annual meeting of individuals, not
states, interested in the wellbeing of the Arctic, Admiral Rob Bauer,
the chair of the NATO Military Committee, gave a speech about military
security in the region despite the fact that military issues are not
typically discussed at the assembly. He focused on NATO's commitment to
countering Russian and Chinese military build up, saying that "In
September, [[Russia]{.mark} conducted]{.underline} a major naval and air
exercise in [the]{.underline} Arctic Ocean called '[**Ocean 24**' and
reportedly [deployed two **nuclear submarines** under]{.mark} the
[Arctic polar icecap]{.mark}]{.underline}. We are also increasingly
witnessing cooperation between Russia and China in this region. This
cooperation has a clear military aspect to it. [[China joined]{.mark}
Russia in the 'Ocean 24' exercise]{.underline}. And at the start of this
month, China's Coast Guard vessels entered the Arctic Ocean for the
first time, patrolling the waters jointly with Russian ships," (Bauer
2024). Later in the speech, he stated that [[NATO]{.mark} responded by
having "[doubled the]{.mark} number of [ships
patrolling]{.mark}]{.underline} the North and the Baltic Seas; stepped
up intelligence sharing; and conducted a series of protective military
activities through the Joint Expeditionary Force," (2024). He made it
clear that in while September 2024 "Russian Foreign Minister Sergei
Lavrov vowed that Moscow would defend its interests in the Arctic both
in diplomatic and military terms\... NATO will also defend its interests
in this region," (2024). [[This spiral of **escalation**]{.mark} and
increasing militarization [is **unsustainable** and
**dangerous**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [NATO being involved is only
making the matter worse]{.underline}. NATO's involvement in the Arctic
is, without a doubt, making Russia respond more and more aggressively in
the region out of a perceived threat by NATO. This is in no one's best
interest, as "Although Russia still articulates the Arctic as a unique
cooperative region, there may be little space left for non-conflictual
Russian action when encountering NATO in the Arctic," (Wilhelmsen and
Hjermann 2022, 114).

[[For]{.mark} the spiral of [escalation in the Arctic to stop]{.mark},
[NATO must **hand over**]{.mark} the status of [the]{.mark} main [forum
for Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} military [[cooperation to the]{.mark}
Arctic [Council]{.mark} so]{.underline} that [all of the Arctic states
can cooperate]{.underline}. NATO would still maintain its policy of
defending all of its member states, but [[Russia would feel]{.mark} far
**[less antagonized]{.mark}** in the region]{.underline} to make such a
move necessary.

But for the A7, [[Russia's invasion of Ukraine shattered
this]{.underline}]{.mark} hitherto [enduring "[spirit of
cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}," precipitating the abandonment by
Nordic states Finland and Sweden of their long traditions of neutrality
and decisions to join the NATO alliance, as military concerns displaced
prior cooperative instincts. Faith in Arctic cooperation, as the war in
Ukraine approaches the end of its fi rst year with peace nowhere in
sight, is at an all-time low. And [[without the]{.mark} continued, [full
participation of all Arctic Council stakeholders, inclusive of Russia,
**the world has lost an important forum** where]{.mark} the
"[trust]{.mark} [and]{.mark} mutual [understanding]{.mark}"]{.underline}
Korchunov described [[can be rekindled]{.underline}]{.mark}. With this
distinctive forum for multi-level multilateralism, where the inherent
asymmetry of actors and diversity of their perspectives was welcome for
so long, it's hard to imagine a way back from this impasse, and to
overcome the new distrust felt across the Circumpolar Arctic. But if the
risks, dangers, and enmity of the Cold War era could so quickly give way
to a new cooperative spirit as witnessed in 1996 with the Arctic
Council's formation, it can happen again. But for this to happen,
dialogue must resume between all Arctic stakeholders---and this
restoration cannot happen too soon. [[The stakes are just too
high]{.mark}, for the Arctic, and [for the world at
large]{.mark}.]{.underline}

There is thus much opportunity from participating in, and in so doing
thwart Russia's ambitions, with the power of consensus that undergirds
the Arctic Council. [[Even while Europe is aflame, the Arctic continues
to melt. The **challenge of climate change** does not go away]{.mark},
nor do the many pressing challenges across the remote and isolated
communities of the Arctic region.]{.underline} And, with tensions high
in Europe, Moscow may choose to ship more of its petroleum products
through the Northern Sea Route to Asian markets rather than to European
ports---and if it does, its economy will come to increasingly rely on
the stable border with the United States it worked so hard to create and
to sustain since the fi nal days of the Soviet Union. When Russia sold
Alaska to the United States in 1867, it did so for a good reason: it was
the best neighbour to have, in good times and bad. Th is remained true
during the Second World War when that border provided a lend-lease
lifeline to the Eastern Front, and it remained true during the Cold War
even when tensions were high. And despite the uncertainty and chaos
unleashed with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it remains true even today.

There is every reason to isolate Russia as the war in Ukraine continues,
to maintain sanctions, and to remind Putin that he has become a pariah
that threatens global stability. But no matter how things unfold in
Europe, Russia still remains half of the Circumpolar World. Governing
the Arctic eff ectively, and peacefully, still requires Russia's
participation and consent. [[The Arctic climate will continue its
inexorable thaw]{.mark}; its still pristine ecosystems remain as fragile
and sublime [now as they did before Russia invaded
Ukrain]{.mark}e]{.underline}. Arctic Indigenous Peoples continue to off
er the world their wisdom and Traditional Knowledge, and require our
continued, good-faith eff orts to overcome past economic marginalization
and political exclusion.

[[By keeping today's pause on Arctic Council participation as brief as
possible]{.mark} and resuming meetings among its stakeholders virtually
and in symbolic protest, while trying to restore consensus with Russia
on the many important issues that still unite the whole of the
Circumpolar World, **[the Arctic Council can become part of

conflict]{.mark}**.]{.underline} It can offer the very same bridge to a
collaborative future that it has promised since 1996 and show that its
second quarter century can be as successful as its fi rst. Th e Arctic
Council survived the collapse of consensus once before on an issue of
great import---the climate change challenge that requires our collective
unity to overcome. [[The Council]{.underline}]{.mark} can---and
[[must]{.underline}---[survive the current collapse]{.underline}]{.mark}
[in consensus that has accompanied the confl ict over Ukraine [and keep

The Arctic, often associated with serene landscapes and wildlife, is not
just a picturesque region but a strategically important area shaped by
environmental, political, economic, and military forces. During the Cold
War, it was a battleground between the United States (US), the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), and the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics (USSR). Post-Cold War, Arctic nations sought to preserve it as
a zone of cooperation.1) However, the [**strategic competition** among
the US, Russia, and the]{.underline} People's Republic of China
[(**PRC**) has significantly elevated its **geopolitical
importance**]{.underline} in the past decade. The [[**military**
advancements of **Russia** and **PRC**]{.mark}, in contrast to
[slow]{.mark}er [efforts by]{.mark} the [US]{.mark} and
NATO]{.underline}, [have [turned]{.mark} the [Arctic into]{.mark} a
[critical focus for **security**]{.mark}, [**resource**]{.mark} access,
[and]{.mark} control over emerging **[shipping]{.mark}
routes.**]{.underline}

In 2009[, global [**interest** in]{.mark} the [Arctic **surged**]{.mark}

unprecedented; in 2007, Russian submarines planted a Russian flag on the
North Pole, proclaiming, "The Arctic is Russian."3)

The 2013 launch of the US National Strategy for the Arctic Region set
the stage for today's geopolitical landscape. By 2022, [Russian

prioritized investments in icebreakers, climate action, and Indigenous

sustainable development in this increasingly contested region.5)

\[Text Condensed\]

Background

Since 2009, the US has issued several Arctic policy documents. The 2009
Arctic Region Policy Directive marked a significant shift in US
assessment by recognizing the Arctic's importance, particularly in terms
of energy and security.6) The 2013 National Strategy for the Arctic
Region highlighted energy and US security, environmental preservation,
freedom of navigation, access to resources, commerce protection, and
peaceful resolution.7)

The 2022 National Strategy for the Arctic Region was more urgent.
Marie-Anne Coninsx, a senior fellow at the Egmont Institute and former
EU Ambassador (Arctic), noted that in prior years, US Arctic commitment
was "not high on the US Federal Agenda."8) The Strategy marked a shift
in US policy, acknowledging the Arctic as a critical and addressing
challenges that had emerged since 2013. It identified four key Pillars:
security, climate change/protection, sustainable development, and
international governance.9) The strategy emphasized climate change and
investing in sustainable development while increasing capabilities to
prevent threats to the US and its allies.10) Furthermore, it recognized
the heightened strategic competition in the Arctic, exacerbated by
Russia's invasion of Ukraine.11) In 2023, US Army General VanHerck
advocated to Congress the urgent need for a focused Arctic Strategy,
enhanced domain awareness, and the creation of a comprehensive defense
framework as these challenges were being driven further by advancing
climate change and rising security challenges.12)

The 2024 Department of Defense (DoD) Arctic Strategy further recognizes
the Arctic's growing importance due to climate change, geopolitical
shifts, and increasing great-power competition and directs the DoD to
"enhance its Arctic capabilities, deepen engagement with Allies and
partners, and exercise our forces to build readiness for operations at
high latitudes."13) It highlights critical defense objectives, including
protecting US sovereignty, maintaining stability, and ensuring the
Arctic's role as a secure avenue for power projection. The 2024 Strategy
includes specific initiatives such as enhanced domain awareness;
increased communication, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
capabilities; better understanding of cold-weather operations; and
conducting key routine training alongside US allies to strengthen joint
capabilities.14) The strategy emphasizes cooperation with, and
participation of, Arctic nations and Indigenous communities. It
underscores climate adaptation measures. Through these efforts, the DoD
seeks to maintain a "monitor-and-respond" posture, ensuring the Arctic
remains peaceful while adapting to dynamic environmental and security
conditions.

Climate change and security

Climate change has rapidly transformed the Arctic, making previously
inaccessible areas more available for economic and strategic use. The
North Sea Route (NSR) and the Northwest Passage (NWP) could become
economically viable by 2023,15) potentially diverting traffic from the
Suez Canal. As access to critical resources expands, states will shift
strategies and intensify competition over the Arctic's growing economic
and military significance. This competition has also been driven by its
militarization.16) Over the past decade, Russia has modernized its
Arctic military bases, deployed defense missiles, and upgraded its
submarine fleet while developing fisheries, petroleum, and mineral
extraction.17) Russia's restrictive NSR claims have further escalated
tensions, especially following its invasion of Ukraine. Meanwhile, PRC
signaled growing ambitions having ramped up its Arctic investments,
researched military applications, and expanded its icebreaker fleet.18)
These developments highlight the Arctic's evolving role in economic
opportunity and strategic rivalry, posing significant challenges to US
grand strategy.

American Grand Strategy

The 2009 Arctic Region Policy shifted away from the apathetic post-Cold
War US Arctic strategy, recognizing the Arctic as an emerging critical
region but only identified two focal points: energy and security.19) The
2022 National Strategy for the Arctic Region was comprehensive,
addressing the Pillars of security, climate change/environmental
protection, sustainable development, and international governance.
Changes in the physical, financial, and geopolitical landscape have
shifted American grand strategy in the Arctic, ending the previous three
decades of stability following the Cold War and reflecting rising
geopolitical tensions between Russia and Arctic stakeholders.

Energy

The US is vested in the Arctic's oil and natural gas, with Alaska's
Prudhoe Bay Oil Field being North America's most prominent; in the
2000s, Prudhoe Bay typically produced about 8% of America's domestic
oil.20) The importance of Arctic oil to America's energy independence
was demonstrated in 2006 when a leak in a critical pipeline at Prudhoe
Bay forced the line's shutdown while the US and Iran were in a dispute.
At the same time, tensions in the Middle East made it difficult for the
US to buy reasonably priced foreign oil. The total cost of oil increased
3% domestically.21)

The 2009 Arctic Region Policy aimed to increase US oil independence by
accessing Alaskan oil deposits. While it received support from energy
independence advocates, it was also met with resistance from
environmentalists, thus hindering implementation.22) This debate
persisted over the years, shaping subsequent approaches to Arctic
resource development. The Trump administration (2021) issued drilling
leases on more than 400,000 acres in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge.23) In contrast, the 2022 National Strategy for the Arctic
acknowledges the region's economic reliance on hydrocarbon production
while advocating for economic diversification, a transition to green
energy and environmental protection.24) In 2024, the US Department of
the Interior denied commercial access to a copper deposit through Gates
of the Arctic National Park. It banned oil drilling in half of the
National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.25) Environmentalists and tribal
leaders praised these decisions, but Alaska's officials criticized
them.26)

The relationship between environmentalism and energy complicates the US
grand strategy in the Arctic, creating inconsistency due to fluctuating
politics, public opinion, and stakeholder support. This makes long-term
planning for Arctic energy difficult, as leadership changes can shift
priorities between resource extraction and environmental protections and
alter the trajectory of US Arctic strategy. Such volatility hampers
coherent, long-term policies essential for the region's energy security
and ecological sustainability, making it a contentious issue influenced
by electoral outcomes and shifting public opinion.

Security

The 2009 US Arctic Region Policy's focus on security has evolved
significantly. Previously, the US emphasized unilateral security and
preferred bilateral agreements to regional cooperation while ignoring
Arctic issues.27) Post-Cold War, Russia expanded its presence in the
Arctic, reverting to Cold War norms. In response, the 2022 National
Strategy now prioritizes American people and sovereign territory and
rights, committing to enhance capabilities through infrastructure
improvements, including an expanded icebreaker fleet, and strengthening
cooperation with Arctic allies against Russian aggression.28)

\[None Omitted\]

In his 1987 Murmansk speech, Mikhail Gorbachev described the Arctic as a
"peace and cooperation zone," emphasizing collaboration over
competition.29) However during the 2000s, in response to an increased
perception of NATO's Arctic presence and strategic importance, Russia
began militarizing the region, seeking to reclaim its superpower status
after the Soviet Union's collapse.30) By 2019, Russia had established 14
airfields, six military bases, refurbished 16 Soviet-era deep-water
ports, and 10 border posts in the Arctic, with its Northern Fleet
boasting an estimated 120 ships, including 40 icebreakers.31) [[Russia
allowed **PRC** to **construct** **docks** at]{.mark} five of the most
[significant ports]{.mark} along Russia's Arctic
coastline.]{.underline}32) In contrast, the US needs to develop a
centralized command structure in the Arctic, a crucial aspect of its
security policy.33) It has only one significant base at Pituffik Space
Base in Greenland, with two additional bases south of the Arctic Circle
in Alaska.34) The US has only two ocean-going icebreakers. There is a
stark disparity in military presence between Russia and the US, a
potential security dilemma. Russia's action, and the US's inaction,
underscore the Arctic's strategic importance and the urgency for a
comprehensive security strategy.

Russia has fortified the region to protect future strategic and economic
interests.35) The US has interpreted this as an attempt to achieve
regional dominance, prompting numerous military operations in the
area.36) Moscow views US actions as aggressive intrusions into Russian
territory, which has led to further militarization on both sides.37)

This ongoing dynamic was exemplified when US Vice Admiral Lewis claimed
that his fleet was prepared to secure sea lanes in the Atlantic and
Arctic.38) A Russian Duma member responded by stating that the US should
not tempt fate and that the NSR and Arctic were Russia's responsibility
where Russian national interests are present.39) The current US Grand
Strategy has acted firmly but lacks consistent messaging. For example,
in 2019, Secretary of State Pompeo decried Russian aggression in the
Arctic, citing their regulations on NSR shipping, Arctic fortification,
and actions in Ukraine.40) However, Pompeo's message lacked specificity
about why the US felt threatened, simply stating that the US would host
military exercises and increase its presence in the Arctic.41) The US
must ensure that its actions in the Arctic are firm, predictable,
consistent, and straightforward to avoid further escalating tensions.

The US must improve its messaging on Arctic security by clearly
communicating its policies and red lines to Russia to avoid
misinterpretations and unintended confrontations. However, it's also
important to recognize that the Arctic offers opportunities for
cooperation. Enhanced communication can address immediate threats and
foster stable regional collaboration. By improving its messaging
strategy, the US can more effectively navigate the complex geopolitical
landscape and reduce the risks of escalating tensions with Russia.

Economics

The future of the American Grand Strategy will be influenced by
accessibility of the NSR and NWP, which has historically been limited
due to short operational seasons (sea ice, weather) and limited
infrastructure. These routes are, however, becoming viable with the
NSR's navigation season expected to extend from three to six months and
the NWP's from two to four months by 2100.42) If these projections hold,
transporting goods from Europe to the Far East via the NSR could be 25
percent more profitable than the Suez Canal Route.43)

The current shipping industry is already challenged. In 2023, Houthi
attacks in the Red Sea led seven major shipping companies to alter their
routes, resulting in fewer ships using the Suez Canal. Meanwhile, severe
drought in Panama caused a 30 percent decrease in trade since November
2023.44) These disruptions have led to a 283 percent increase in the
cost of a 40-foot container transiting from PRC to northern Europe.45)
These challenges have highlighted the need for alternative shipping
routes, making the Arctic routes increasingly important.

The future accessibility of the Arctic makes it more critical than ever
however, the West's investment is lagging.46) In contrast, Russia has
prioritized the development of the Arctic to attract traffic,
particularly the NSR. From 2011 to 2015, the Russian Arctic doctrine
focused on establishing new ports, customs facilities, and marine
checkpoints along the Arctic Coastline.47) [Vladimir [Putin]{.mark} has
[stressed]{.mark} the [NSR's]{.mark} strategic
[importance]{.mark}]{.underline}, and Russia's development plan for 2035
includes \$19 billion in infrastructure investments.48) These
commitments [underscore Russia's recognition of the value of the NSR and
the potential increase in cargo transport in the north.]{.underline}

The [development of the [NSR is]{.mark} also [of **interest to
PRC**]{.mark}]{.underline}, who referred to it as part of the Polar Silk
Road in its 2018 Arctic White Paper and the 14th Five-Year Plan.49)
[[Putin's **2023 visit** to PRC]{.mark} aimed to [enhance]{.mark} the
[NSR]{.mark}'s [integration]{.mark} into the **B**elt and **R**oad
**I**nitiative.50)]{.underline} [PRC's NSR use has steadily
increased]{.underline}, with transits rising from 27 in 2018 to 62 in
2020.51) The economic benefits, predicted to be 25 % greater than those
of the Suez Canal Route, are also a significant driver of PRC's growing
NSR interest.52) [[PRC]{.mark} stands to [**gain significantly**
from]{.mark} Russian NSR, and [Arctic expansion]{.mark}, in
general.]{.underline}

In contrast, Europe and Japan have a more complicated view of the NSR.
Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, there was a decline in NSR
transit due to sanctions on Russia.53) However, by 2023, transits had
rebounded, with increased transport of Russian LNG to Europe.54) Despite
condemning Russia's actions, Japan has not avoided the NSR, indicating
that economic advantages often outweigh political considerations.

Shifting maritime traffic from the Suez Canal to the NSR requires the US
to reevaluate trade routes and competitive strategies. [As
Europe]{.underline}an [and Asia]{.underline}n partners [increasingly use
the NSR]{.underline}, they will need to maintain good relations with
Russia, which could limit their willingness to oppose Russia, giving
Russia a strategic advantage. [The [US must]{.mark} consider this shift
in geopolitical power while also [closely]{.mark}
**[monitor]{.mark}ing** the [growing **partnership** between Russia
and]{.mark} the [PRC in the Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Increased access to [energy and mineral resources [extraction]{.mark}
due to ice melt, [holds significant]{.mark} capacity for
[growth]{.mark}.]{.underline}55) The area is home to 22 percent of the
world's resources, which includes up to 25 percent of unexplored oil and
gas reserves. Despite having no Arctic land, [[PRC]{.mark} refers to
itself as a "**near Arctic state**]{.underline}," investing heavily in
the region. In 2012[, PRC [**invested \$12 billion** in]{.mark} the
[Russian]{.mark} Yamal LNG [project]{.mark} [after US sanctions]{.mark}
left Russia short on funds.56)]{.underline}

Furthermore, in 2018, [[PRC signed]{.mark} an [**agreement** to invest
in Alaskan]{.mark} natural [gas]{.mark} export facility]{.underline},57)
and in 2019, [Chinese companies [purchased 10
percent]{.mark}]{.underline} (\$5.6 billion) [[of]{.mark} the most
prominent [Russian]{.mark} natural [gas
producer]{.mark}]{.underline}.58) PRC has unsuccessfully attempted to
buy mines in Nunavut59) and recently increased research and land
acquisition efforts in the Svalbard.60) [[PRC]{.mark} is [clearly
committed to Arctic]{.mark} resources.]{.underline}

The [[Arctic's **growing accessibility**]{.mark} is
**[changing]{.mark}** global [trade and econ]{.mark}omics,
[necessitating]{.mark} an **[adaptation of US]{.mark}** grand
[strategy]{.mark}]{.underline}. Considering the potential opportunities

[in]{.mark} future **[global trade]{.mark}**, resource [**extraction**,
and]{.mark} international **[relations]{.mark}**, making it a key

Conclusion

Arctic development and policies have transitioned from cooperative to
competitive due to Russian development, militarization, and the
[**PRC's** expanding **influence**, necessitating a recalibrated US
grand strategy.]{.underline} The 2022 US National Strategy for the
Arctic Region presented a comprehensive response, prioritizing security,
climate resilience, sustainable development, and international
governance. Its multi-pronged approach, emphasizing the immediate need
for a unified NATO Arctic strategy, furthers US interests and aligns
military, economic, and environmental policies among Arctic NATO
members.

When engaging Russia, the US must present a strong deterrent while
pursuing selective diplomatic efforts on shared concerns such as
environmental protection and accident prevention. This balanced
strategy, valuing both strength and diplomacy, is necessary to reduce
the risk of miscalculations. At the same time, [[strengthening]{.mark}
the [**US role** in]{.mark} multilateral forums like [the **Arctic
Council is essential to counter PRC's influence** and]{.mark} prevent it
from gaining [leverage]{.mark} as a self-proclaimed "near-Arctic"
stakeholder.]{.underline}

Climate change will create shipping opportunities and natural resource
access, accompanied by the potential for economic growth and strategic
challenges. In navigating this evolving landscape, the US strives to
balance energy, security, and environmental protection but conflicting
interests complicate policy coherence. Political changes and stakeholder
sentiment can significantly shape strategy, often resulting in abrupt
shifts. Maintaining consistency is crucial, especially as environmental
issues increasingly intersect with energy independence and national
security.

Security remains central to US strategy, but vulnerabilities exist due
to military and infrastructure gaps. Russia's aggressive Arctic buildup
contrasts with the [US's limited fleet and infrastructure. The US relies
on strengthening alliances, mainly through NATO]{.underline}, which
Sweden now reinforces and Finland's membership. Balancing defense,
diplomacy, and coalition-building is [vital to safeguarding [US]{.mark}
interests and Arctic stability.]{.underline} The US can shape the
Arctic's future through strategic investments and leadership, ensuring
alignment between national security, environmental, and economic goals.

Going forward, the 2024 DoD Arctic Strategy implements essential
initiatives of the 2022 Arctic Strategy. It strengthens grand strategy
by identifying the Arctic as a critical arena for power projection,
alliance strengthening, climate adaptation, and resilience. [Its'
[approach forms]{.mark} a [cohesive response to]{.mark} Russian
aggression and build-up, PRC ambition, [collab]{.mark}oration [between
Russia and **PRC**]{.mark}]{.underline}, the addition of Sweden and
Finland to NATO and climate change. To that end, it supports improved
Arctic capabilities, force readiness for high latitude operations, and
deeper engagement with Allies.61) Given adequate resources and a
functioning joined-up government, the DoD strategy will help maintain
stability and security in the Arctic.

[[The Arctic is a key battleground in]{.mark} the [great power
competition]{.mark}, [with China]{.mark} challenging US]{.underline} and
Russian [dominance]{.underline}. Claiming "near-Arctic state" status,
China seeks access to resources and the Northern Sea Route (NSR) through
its Polar Silk Road. Its investments in Arctic infrastructure face
resistance, particularly from Western nations. [Meanwhile, the
involvement of China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) in scientific
research has raised security concerns. **[As the Arctic Council
weakens]{.mark}**, [China aims to]{.mark} reshape regional governance,
[secur]{.mark}ing its [influence in a shifting multipolar world
order]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The great power competition unfolding in the Arctic is a complex and
dynamic geopolitical chess game. China has emerged as a key player
alongside traditional Arctic powers, specifically the United States and
Russia. [From China's perspective, [the Arctic]{.mark} is not merely a
source of valuable resources or a region experiencing dramatic
environmental change; rather, [it is a crucial theater for asserting
its]{.mark} growing [global influence]{.mark}]{.underline}, shaping the
future of Arctic governance, [[and managing]{.mark} the intricate web of
relationships with [other major actors]{.mark}, thereby [rendering the
region]{.mark} as one of the [New Strategic
Frontier]{.mark}s]{.underline}.

China's Arctic policy is a carefully calibrated strategy that balances
its economic needs, security concerns, and ambition for global
recognition and leadership. Despite being geographically distant from
the Arctic Circle, China has declared itself a "near-Arctic state." This
claim, although met with skepticism by former US Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo, serves a crucial purpose: it legitimizes China's involvement in
Arctic affairs. China argues that the cascading effects of climate
change in the Arctic---particularly the accelerating melting of ice and
the rising global sea levels---have far-reaching consequences. Even
distant nations like China, where major coastal cities such as Shanghai
and Tianjin face the threat of being potentially submerged, are
impacted. By positioning itself as a responsible stakeholder with a
vested interest in the region's stability, sustainable development, and
climate change mitigation, China justifies its expanding presence in
Arctic affairs. Thus, it advocates for broader international
participation and a more inclusive approach to Arctic governance,
allowing it to engage in discussions without appearing as an outsider or
opportunist. However, in doing so, [[China]{.mark} subtly
[challenges]{.mark} the existing governance framework, controlled mainly
by [the Arctic Council]{.mark} and its member states]{.underline}.

The Arctic Council is a highly effective international forum composed of
the eight states located above the Arctic Circle: the U.S.A., Russia,
Canada, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Finland, and Sweden. In addition to
these member states, the Arctic Council includes observer states and
representatives of indigenous peoples in the Arctic. Five of these
states--- the U.S.A., Russia, Canada, Norway, and Denmark---are littoral
members of the Arctic Ocean and are thus referred to as the A5. One of
these states, Russia, comprises 53% of the Arctic and is notably
different from the other Arctic Council members. Consequently, the
remaining seven Arctic Council members are collectively known as the A7.

Despite the differences between Russia and the A7, the Arctic Council
was historically one of the more effective international forums,
operating on consensus and explicitly barring discussions of military
affairs. However, the longstanding principle of "high latitude, low
tensions" came to an end in 2022 when Russia invaded Ukraine. In
response, the A7 decided that under such circumstances, business as
usual could not continue, and effectively suspended Russia from the
council.

[A key aspect of the [great power rivalry]{.mark} in the region
[is]{.mark} the competition [for access to]{.mark} the Arctic's abundant
natural [resources]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to the United States
Geological Survey, the Arctic is believed to hold vast, largely untapped
reserves of oil, natural gas, and critical minerals such as rare earth
elements, titanium, and lithium. As climate change melts the Arctic ice,
these resources are becoming increasingly accessible. Given its rapidly
growing economy and voracious demand for energy and raw materials, China
views securing access to these resources as a strategic imperative.

[Although China and Russia have formed a pragmatic partnership in the
Arctic---partly driven by shared concerns about US global
dominance---their ambitions could eventually clash]{.underline}. Despite
challenges from Western sanctions and geopolitical pressures, China
remains committed to securing access to Arctic resources. Its
involvement in large-scale projects like the Yamal LNG project, which
extracts and then liquefies gas from Russia's Arctic Yamal Peninsula,
underscores its determination to become an Arctic player. However,
projects like LNG 2, which takes gas from a Russian Arctic area adjacent
to the Yamal Peninsula, have been stalled due to Western sanctions.
Nonetheless, China seems determined to help LNG 2 proceed covertly.

China's approach to securing resources is often marked by a long-term
perspective. It is willing to invest in projects that may not yield
immediate returns but are crucial for future resource access and
long-term energy security. Another important element of the Arctic
competition is control over critical infrastructure. As sea ice
retreats, new shipping routes like the Northern Sea Route (NSR) are
opening, transforming the region into a vital hub for maritime trade,
potentially depriving the Suez Canal.

China has expressed a strong interest in the NSR, which offers a
significantly shorter route between Asia and Europe than the Suez Canal.
The NSR is a key component of China's ambitious Polar Silk Road, which
seeks to connect Asia and Europe while strengthening global trade.
Gaining influence over this crucial shipping route would provide
substantial economic benefits and increase China's geopolitical power.
To secure its position in the Arctic, China has proposed investments in
Arctic and near-Arctic port facilities like Arkhangelsk, Russia, as well
as transportation infrastructure such as Russia's Arctic Express No. 1,
and nuclear and non-nuclear icebreaker technology. While these projects
face scrutiny and resistance from some Arctic states, they underscore
[C[hina]{.underline}]{.mark}['s strategic [intent to establish a
foothold in this]{.mark} emerging [maritime corridor]{.mark} and could
also enable it [to **project naval power**]{.mark} in the Arctic [while
securing]{.mark} vital [trade routes]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The competition for influence in the Arctic also involves international
partnerships. China's approach often emphasizes economic incentives,
offering attractive investment opportunities to Arctic states, such as
its attempts to develop railroads in the Scandinavian Arctic. China's
efforts, however, have met resistance, especially from Arctic states
closely aligned with the United States and wary of China's growing
assertiveness. The Nordic states---particularly Sweden and Norway---have
been at the forefront of this pushback. The United States has sought to
limit China's influence in the Arctic, pressuring allies to reject
Chinese investments such as its attempts to mine in Greenland and
implicitly encouraging them to voice concerns about China's intentions,
as seen in the case of Chinese investment in the Kirkenes Port.

As the Arctic's strategic importance grows, competition for partnerships
will likely intensify and competition for its resources and influence
will escalate. Greenland, for example, denied China's request to
modernize its airport infrastructure, ultimately turning to Denmark
instead. This competition has occasionally created headlines, such as
when President Trump expressed his desire to annex Greenland, indicative
of the great power competition in the Arctic; Greenland's numerous rare
earth elements are vital for American national security.

The great power competition in the Arctic also extends into science and
technology. China expresses its commitment to scientific research in
numerous ways, including substantial investments in its icebreaker
fleet, which already surpasses that of the United States in number, and
could challenge Russia's icebreaker monopoly along the NSR. Chinese
research vessel expeditions---including those that have conducted
research off the US coast to explore the potential of deep-sea
mining---demonstrate its interest in Arctic exploration. China's Arctic
research facilities in Norway, Iceland, and Sweden also reflect its
commitment to expand its scientific presence.

[Although ostensibly focused on climate change and other useful science,
[China's scientific research]{.mark} [activities may]{.mark} also [have
military applications]{.mark}. The vast [data gathered]{.mark} by
Chinese research vessels, monitoring stations, and underwater sensors
[can]{.mark} improve navigation in ice-covered Arctic waters, [track
submarine]{.mark} movements, [and]{.mark} develop advanced radar systems
that can track [objects at long distances]{.mark}.]{.underline} This
dual-use nature of scientific research underscores the
interconnectedness of China's Arctic economic, strategic, and scientific
interests---an approach rooted in civil-military fusion. The fact that
[[some Arctic research programs are]{.mark} run by groups affiliated
[with the PLA]{.mark} further [proves]{.mark} the **[dual-use]{.mark}**
[nature]{.mark} of their research]{.underline}. China's research also
provides valuable information about the Arctic's ecosystem, resource
potential, and environmental changes, all critical for safely navigating
its waters and exploiting its resources. Furthermore, Chinese scientific
[[work]{.mark} in Norway on the ionosphere [could improve missile
detection]{.mark} capabilities, while its research on sea salinity
sampling could also help [enhance submarine stealth]{.mark}
operations]{.underline}.

[The [Arctic Council]{.mark}]{.underline}, [the primary forum for Arctic
governance and cooperation]{.underline}, faces increasing challenges in
maintaining its relevance and effectiveness as geopolitical tensions
rise. Russia's suspension from the Council and its subsequent
response---cutting off funding---illustrates this complexity. These
evolving [[dynamics]{.mark} will]{.underline} not only affect the fate
of the Arctic's resources, environment, and indigenous cultures but
[will also [have **broader** geopolitical
implications]{.mark}]{.underline}. The future of the great power
competition in the Arctic thus remains uncertain.

While NATO and Russia have traditionally dominated the region, China's
rapid economic growth, expanding military capabilities, and increasing
assertiveness have made it a significant force in the Arctic. The
evolving interaction between these powers will shape the Arctic's future
as each seeks to maximize influence, secure strategic and economic
interests, and advance its regional vision. [From [China]{.mark}'s
perspective, it [is a rising]{.mark} global [power with]{.mark}
legitimate and [growing interests in the Arctic]{.mark}. It is
[determined to]{.mark} play a prominent role in shaping the region's
future and [contributing to a]{.mark} new, **[multipolar world order
where China plays a leading role]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The competition
in the Arctic between China and the United States has already begun, but
it will likely accelerate once the Northern Sea Route picks up in the
next decade.

China was a latecomer to Arctic exploration. While European nations
started traveling to the area as early as the 16th century, it was not
until the late 20th century that China began to engage significantly in
the region. Despite this slow start, [Beijing is now determined to
position itself as a key player in the Arctic]{.underline}.

[Arctic ambitions driven by **mercantilism**]{.underline}

Since joining the World Trade Organization in 2001, China's
manufacturing sector has expanded dramatically. The decade that followed
was mutually beneficial: Affluent nations provided technology and
capital while China supplied affordable products. [Beijing remains
optimistic that Europe and North America will continue to be reliable
consumers of Chinese products]{.underline}.

[As global warming intensifies, Beijing's interest in the Arctic grows,
particularly if melting polar ice caps allow access through the
**Northern Sea Route** in coming decades. This path is expected to offer
a **more cost-effective alternative** to the Suez Canal, reducing
transit times by nine days]{.underline}.

[The region's current shipping lanes are not ideal for China. The
Northwest Passage is less economical and subject to Canadian navigation
rules, while the conditions for shipping via the Arctic Central Passage
are not yet favorable due to environmental and technical
challenges]{.underline}.

Meteorological forecasts indicate that [the Arctic is warming faster
than the rest of the world, leading to a significant reduction in the
area and thickness of the Arctic sea ice]{.underline} since satellite
monitoring began in 1978. Predictions suggest that [by 2030, the Arctic
Ocean may witness its first nearly ice-free summer. By 2050, the
Northern Sea Route is expected to be **one of the most efficient
shipping paths** between Asia and Europe.]{.underline}

Moreover, [the Arctic holds abundant natural resources, including oil,
gas, minerals and fish, with its untapped oil and gas reserves estimated
to comprise about 25 percent of the world's undiscovered
resources.]{.underline}

After over a decade of dedicated efforts, [China has achieved
significant milestones in the Arctic]{.underline}. To date, [China
operates several scientific research stations in the region and has
added two icebreakers to its fleet, which are capable of clearing paths
for merchant ships]{.underline} in northern latitudes. [China also
secured observer status in the Arctic Council in 2013 and has
established several agreements with Arctic nations for **joint research
and commercial endeavors** in the Arctic Ocean]{.underline}.

\<\<\<FIGURE 1 OMITTED\>\>\>

In July 2023, a regular Sino-Russian shipping corridor along the Arctic
sea lanes was officially launched, markedly reducing the distance and
time required for cargo transport from Russia's northern ports to China.
In 2023, 80 voyages, comprising cargo ships, cruise ships and oil
tankers, reached Chinese ports via the Arctic waterway. With these
developments, [China has **nearly** solidified its self-proclaimed
status as a "near-Arctic country."]{.underline}

Expanding Chinese interests in the Arctic

China's 2018 white paper on its Arctic policy makes the case that
non-Arctic countries, including China, have rights in the region. [China
has actively pursued the right to scientific research, navigation,
overflight, fishing, laying of submarine cables and pipelines, as well
resource exploration and exploitation]{.underline}.

Beijing is well aware of the challenges and high costs associated with
Arctic development and research. Some [80 percent of Arctic resource
research and development is already under the exclusive control of the
circumpolar states, presenting further obstacles for new entrants like
China]{.underline}.

Historically, [the Arctic represented a model of cooperation among the
eight circumpolar nations]{.underline}. However, on March 3, 2022,
Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Sweden and the United States
issued a joint statement announcing the suspension of their cooperation
with Russia within the Arctic Council, leaving Moscow in need of new
partners to develop the region.

Since the onset of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022,
[Russia has been making unprecedented concessions to China when it comes
to Arctic affairs]{.underline}. In March 2023, [the two countries agreed
to establish a joint working group to advance the Northern Sea Route
project]{.underline}. The following month, [they signed a Memorandum of
Understanding to enhance cooperation in maritime law]{.underline}. In
May, within the "Arctic Thinking -- Global Thinking" project framework,
[BRICS country representatives convened to formulate a unified Arctic
agenda]{.underline}.

\<\<\<CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>\>

China's covert support for Russia's Arctic LNG 2 project

The Arctic is poised to become a vital energy hub for Russia. The Arctic
LNG 2 project, the second major onshore gas initiative on the Gydan
Peninsula, is being developed with international collaboration. Russian
media predict that by 2050, these operations could contribute to 9
percent of global production of liquified natural gas (LNG). To attract
foreign investors, the Russian government has introduced substantial tax
breaks and subsidies.

However, the landscape shifted dramatically after Russia's full-scale
invasion of Ukraine. Major global oil companies, including BP, Statoil
and ExxonMobil, pulled out of or paused their collaboration with Russia.
Consequently, the Arctic LNG 2 project has been unable to proceed as
originally planned. France's Total, a key foreign investor in these
Arctic ventures, also declared it would cease funding new projects.

In November 2023, the U.S. imposed sanctions on the Arctic LNG 2
project, into which over \$20 billion had already been invested. In
response to escalating Western measures, Russia offered a 40 percent
discount on the sale of LNG. However, a year later, Russia has still not
found a buyer for Arctic LNG 2.

China's involvement in this project mirrors President Xi Jinping's
strategy: on one hand supporting Russia and aiming to prevent the
downfall of the Arctic LNG 2 project, while simultaneously not wanting
to jeopardize its access to Western markets.

Under pressure from the U.S. and Europe, China's Wison New Energies
officially withdrew from the Arctic LNG 2 on June 21. However, in
August, a small fleet of Chinese cargo ships covertly headed to the
Arctic to support the project. These ships were laden with substantial
power generation equipment for the Arctic LNG 2 project, provided by
Wison New Energies. During its journey within Chinese waters, one ship
changed its name twice to avoid detection. Its automatic identification
system listed Norway as its destination, masking its true route to
Russia. This discreet operation successfully delivered Modules 1-3 to
the project site in Russia. When these activities were exposed, Wison
denied direct involvement and suggested that a third party was
responsible.

China did not have sufficient time to deliver the final two power
modules to the Russian Arctic within the year. With the Arctic summer
shipping season over, Modules 4-5 now remain at the Zhoushan shipyard.
Another covert operation will likely take place next year.

Despite Washington explicitly threatening sanctions against involvement
in the Arctic LNG 2 project, on June 7 of this year PetroChina Chairman
Wang Yilin and Novatek Chairman Leonid Mikhelson signed a share purchase
agreement in St. Petersburg. This agreement stipulated that PetroChina
would acquire a 10 percent stake in Arctic LNG 2. This move was not
merely a decision by PetroChina but the fulfillment of an agreement made
between President Xi and President Vladimir Putin during the former's
visit to Moscow in March.

Simultaneously, Beijing continues to engage with the U.S. and Europe.
For instance, on April 16, China and Iceland signed a trade rights
agreement, during which leaders of both nations reaffirmed their
cooperation on Arctic affairs.

Scenarios

Likely: China becomes a forefront player in Arctic development

China's current Arctic operations focus on two main methods: Eurasian
transit of bulk cargo transport through the Northeast Passage and direct
shipments to ports along Russia's Northern Sea Route. When new routes
become navigable, Beijing will be perfectly positioned to expand its
activities. China will even launch tourist cruises to the Arctic on a
large scale in 2025.

This summer, China completed three Arctic research missions and began
building several heavy icebreakers for its coast guard fleet.
Furthermore, it plans to launch a manned submersible to the Arctic
seabed from the polar research vessel Exploration III. Previously
dependent on foreign technology, China will now be able to rely on its
own capabilities.

[Likely: Arctic cooperation between Russia and China
intensifies]{.underline}

[All of China's activities in the Arctic are **only possible thanks to
Moscow's facilitation**. A commercially viable shipping route along
Russia's Arctic coast could soon become a reality, which would be
economically beneficial for both Moscow and Beijing]{.underline}. A
joint venture between Russia's Rosatom and China's Hainan Yangpu Xinxin
Shipping Company is set to construct the necessary infrastructure and
polar-class container ships to operate these Arctic routes year-round.
This development will likely increase Russian economic dependence on
China, but [President Putin has few options available to break out of
international isolation and secure external support **while he continues
to wage war against Ukraine**.]{.underline}

Beijing seeks to ensure the Northern Sea Route remains free of Western
interference through its cooperation with Russia. For example, the
Chinese Coast Guard recently participated in its first Arctic patrol
with Russia. It is conceivable that [Russia will grant China more
influence in Arctic development moving forward]{.underline}.

At the moment, [the Arctic capabilities of the democratic circumpolar
states appear to be less robust than those of China and
Russia]{.underline}. The U.S. has only two icebreakers, and Canada does
not seem urgently focused on defending the Arctic's northern reaches.

Two developments are possible. [If tensions between Russia and the West
remain high due to the ongoing war in Ukraine, it is likely that
Russia's joint ventures with China in the Arctic by China will expand
**dramatically**]{.underline}. However, if the Trump administration
encourages Ukraine to cede land to Russia and returns confiscated
Russian assets, then perhaps American and European companies will begin
to engage with Russian Arctic projects again, although this will take
time. Meanwhile, China will try to maintain a facade of diplomatic
engagement with other Arctic states.

A Coast Guard cutter spotted the ships during a routine patrol of the
Bering Sea, north of Alaska: a guided missile cruiser and two smaller
ships from China, traveling in formation with four ships from Russia.
The cutter followed until they split up and dispersed.

The ships broke no rules and violated no boundaries. But their
appearance so close to the Arctic this past fall raised concern in
Washington nonetheless. [For years, China has worked to establish
footholds in the region that would give it access to rich mineral
deposits and shipping lanes, as well as a greater say in Arctic affairs.
That---and a strategic presence in a region ringed by the United States
and several other NATO countries.]{.underline}

Researchers at RAND and the Swedish Defence Research Agency looked at
where China is operating in the Arctic, what it wants, and what that
could mean for regional security. They concluded that [China has made
only limited inroads in the Arctic, but that\'s not for lack of
trying]{.underline}.

"The threat should not be inflated," said Stephanie Pezard, a senior
political scientist at RAND who specializes in Arctic security. "But at
the same time, [they have a clear intent to not be excluded from Arctic
developments as the region becomes more accessible]{.underline}. The
real questions are, How much of a role do they want, and what does that
mean for an Arctic nation like the United States?"

[Conditions in the Arctic have always been so extreme, the distances so
vast, that even rivals like the United States and Russia **were forced
to cooperate there**. But the Arctic is warming faster than anywhere
else on the planet. Sea routes that sailors and explorers have dreamed
about for centuries are starting to open. The promise of Arctic
riches---oil, minerals, trade routes, even fish---has started to draw
interest from far outside the northern latitudes.]{.underline}

[China]{.underline} has declared itself a "near-Arctic state," a
designation it invented to push for a greater role in Arctic governance.
It [has]{.underline} [dispatched research expeditions, sought to
establish mining and gas operations, and envisioned a network of
shipping routes crossing the Arctic, a "**silk road on
ice**."]{.underline} It describes itself as an "active participant,
builder, and contributor in Arctic affairs," one that has "spared no
efforts to contribute its wisdom to the development of the Arctic
region."

But [in the Arctic]{.underline}, as in the rest of the world, [the
United States sees China as a potentially destabilizing force, with the
economic and military power to try to bend the established order to its
liking]{.underline}. The Pentagon considers China its "pacing challenge"
of the foreseeable future. Its Arctic strategy, released in October,
pays particular attention to the risk of China using commercial or
scientific access to the Arctic for military advantage.

Researchers at RAND set out to document known Chinese activities in the
North American Arctic, which touches Alaska, Canada, and Greenland.
Their counterparts in Sweden focused on the European side, from Iceland,
through the Nordic countries, to Russia.

What they found: Especially in the North American Arctic, "there\'s not
a ton going on," Pezard said. [China has invested in a handful of mining
operations, mostly chasing valuable rare earth minerals. It has trade
partnerships with Greenland and a small stake in a zinc mine in
Alaska.]{.underline} A Chinese company tried to buy a shuttered U.S.
Navy base in Greenland, but the Danish government quashed the idea.

[China has used loans and infrastructure deals to prop open the door for
itself in countries across Asia, Africa, and Latin America]{.underline}.
But the countries of the North American Arctic have generally taken a
hard look at any proposed Chinese investments---and often a hard pass.
Canada blocked a \$150 million gold mine deal that would have put
Chinese interests too close to military installations. Greenland has
held up plans for another Chinese mine over concerns about pollution.

"We didn\'t see the more nefarious activities that we\'ve seen in other
parts of the world, like predatory lending or influence over local
decisions, that are more damaging to international norms," said Stephen
Flanagan, an adjunct senior fellow at RAND and former senior director
for defense policy and strategy at the U.S. National Security Council.
"[All of the governments are being careful in how they deal with
China]{.underline}. It\'s a \'buyer beware\' approach."

RAND\'s study did not include the [Russian side of the
Arctic]{.underline}. That [may be China\'s **best route to greater
Arctic influence**]{.underline}. The Arctic Council, a governing body of
Arctic States and indigenous nations, suspended its meetings last year,
refusing to engage with Russia after it attacked Ukraine. A panel of
experts that RAND convened for its study noted [that Russia could seek
to form its own Arctic governing council, with a **more central role for
its ally, China**]{.underline}.

The experts thought that was possible, but not necessarily probable.
Despite its joint operation in the Bering Sea this past fall, and
codevelopment of a natural gas project in the Russian Arctic, Moscow has
also been wary of letting China pursue its ambitions so close to its
home shores. And rather than walk away from the existing council, Russia
has called for it to resume its meetings, with Russia back at the table.

For now, [the U.S. should continue to make the Arctic a diplomatic,
economic, and strategic priority, to demonstrate its commitment to the
region and its people]{.underline}, researchers concluded. [It should
work to **strengthen solidarity** among its Arctic
allies]{.underline}---and explore conditions under which it could
restart some engagement with Russia, such as on search-and-rescue
preparedness.

But [the U.S. should also recognize that engaging with China in the
Arctic does not have to be a win-or-lose proposition. There are
opportunities to cooperate]{.underline}---[on climate
change]{.underline}, for example, [or pollution control. China has
already played a key role in international agreements to protect Arctic
fisheries and to create maritime shipping regulations]{.underline}. On
paper, at least, [both China and the United States are committed to
ensuring the Arctic remains a region of **peace and
stability**]{.underline}.

The next few years will be a crucial test. If current projections hold,
the Arctic could see its first ice-free summer by 2030.

began cooperating with China in the region. But [[after it sought to
limit]{.mark} the [involvement]{.mark} of the People's Republic, Russia
recently has invited much greater Chinese participation]{.underline},
says the report by Strider Technologies, a firm that focuses on
open-source intelligence.

"Russia's increasing willingness to allow the PRC in the Arctic
demonstrates the realness of their 'no-limits' partnership and its
potential counterbalance to U.S.-led alliances," the report says.

[[For decades]{.underline}]{.mark}, the report adds, [[Russia **actively

[[But]{.mark} Russia's [**increasing**]{.mark} economic and diplomatic

PSR Evolution

The idea of a [[PSR]{.underline}]{.mark} was borrowed [from
Russia's]{.underline} Concept [\"Silk Road on Ice\"]{.underline} in
2011. It later [became a **[central pillar]{.mark}** [of China's Arctic

(**[[BRI]{.underline}]{.mark}**). This [idea received traction when
China gained **observer status** in the Arctic Council,]{.underline}
further reinforced by the historic voyage of MV Xue Long in 2013.

[China formally introduced the PSR in its Arctic strategy in
2018]{.underline}. The plan views the [Arctic Sea shipping route as a
**key trade route**]{.underline} and advocates cooperation in
infrastructure development, including the Northern Sea Route [(NSR),
satellite navigation systems, and fiber optic cables. **[Collaborations

geothermal project with Iceland, [[underscore]{.mark} PSR\'s [focus on

PSR Evolution

The idea of a [[PSR]{.underline}]{.mark} was borrowed [from
Russia's]{.underline} Concept [\"Silk Road on Ice\"]{.underline} in
2011. It later [became a **[central pillar]{.mark}** [of China's Arctic
Strategy]{.mark}]{.underline} under the framework of
[[China\'s]{.underline}]{.mark} Belt and Road Initiative
(**[[BRI]{.underline}]{.mark}**). This [idea received traction when
China gained **observer status** in the Arctic Council,]{.underline}
further reinforced by the historic voyage of MV Xue Long in 2013.

[China formally introduced the PSR in its Arctic strategy in
2018]{.underline}. The plan views the [Arctic Sea shipping route as a
**key trade route**]{.underline} and advocates cooperation in
infrastructure development, including the Northern Sea Route [(NSR),
satellite navigation systems, and fiber optic cables. **[Collaborations
with Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline} and Nordic nations, such as the
geothermal project with Iceland, [[underscore]{.mark} PSR\'s [focus on
connectivity]{.mark}, [energy]{.mark} security, [and
sustainability]{.mark}]{.underline} while also [[addressing geopolitical
issues]{.mark} and environmental concerns.]{.underline}

#### Chinese leadership in the Arctic is purely out of self-interest and poses threats. 

**Cunningham '24** \[Alan; May 14; doctoral student at the University of
Birmingham's Department of History in the United Kingdom; The Arctic

changed Arctic Council Governance and the Arctic Council's Path
Forward,"
<https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/shifting-ice-russian-invasion-ukraine-arctic-circle-governance-arctic-councils-path-forward>\]

Not only this, but [strategically, [China]{.mark} has [become]{.mark} a
**far [stronger]{.mark}** power12) [in]{.mark} the
[Arctic]{.mark},13) [using]{.mark} the **[power vacuum and political
instability]{.mark}** to [further]{.mark} its economic and military
[goals]{.mark} in the region.]{.underline}

Overall, the [[Arctic]{.mark} remains]{.underline} [**highly
[vulnerable]{.mark}** to changing geopolitical
developments]{.underline}, and has likely never been more vulnerable in
its history, considering [increased global interactions with the
region]{.underline}. In fact, the Arctic affairs have become [even more
vulnerable in recent months]{.underline}, considering [Russia's threat
to leave the Arctic Council]{.underline} and their refusal to pay the
annual contributions.14)

How the West Can Reclaim the Arctic

[Allowing [China]{.mark} to [gain]{.mark} a further [foothold in]{.mark}
the [region]{.mark} could [lead]{.mark} to **[severe issues]{.mark}**
for the [global]{.mark} community [and]{.mark} for the [Arctic]{.mark}
itself.]{.underline} However, the end result of Russia's invasion of
Ukraine and how this may affect the Arctic in the immediate future of
the conflict and after the conflict is over remains to be seen.

Writing for The Conversation, Mathieu Landriault and Paul Minard,
political scientists at the University of Ottawa and the University of
Saint-Paul, write, "it's difficult to foresee how Arctic institutions
will continue in the future given the fundamental rift between Russia
and the West ... \[but many Arctic experts\] were correctly pessimistic
about Arctic Council members, including Russia, resuming co-operation by
the end of September 2022,"15) with most instead seeing the most likely
scenario being that Russia and the other members of the Arctic Circle be
unable to resume their regular operations in the near future.

In spite of this, commentary in the Financial Times16) and Foreign
Policy17) has argued that Western efforts at cooperation must be made
with Russia in the Arctic. While these experts certainly do not ignore
the realities of the Ukraine-Russia conflict, there appears to be a
desire to disregard these events in favor of keeping the status quo that
has long existed in the Arctic.

No matter the desire to see a return to normalcy or continue operations
in the Arctic, while it is important to ensure continuity, it is also
important to protect human rights and work against those who are
continuing to engage in illegal or criminal activities with no
indication or inclination to stop. By continually refusing to work with
Russia in the Arctic Circle, the Arctic Council is applying pressure to
the Russian Federation in coordination with the international community
and the rest of the West. Certainly, the nation-states that make up the
Council do realize that this lack of participation with Russia does
spell issues for the Council as a whole and in terms of properly
governing and regulating the region, yet they understand that what
Russia is doing in Ukraine (flagrantly violating international law,
indiscriminately killing Ukrainian civilians, torturing and mutilating
combatants and prisoners of war, suppressing their own domestic
population, and using sexual assault as a weapon of war) matters far
more than the current stability of the Arctic Circle. To them, and to
the vast majority of individuals, protecting human rights and stopping
totalitarian regimes matters more than maintaining the status quo of a
region.

Nonetheless, this is not an excuse for [allowing [China]{.mark} or other
world powers that [pose]{.mark} an additional [**threat to stability**
and]{.mark} apply further [pressure and influence]{.mark} in this
important region.]{.underline} As such, it [[should be]{.mark} an
additional [priority of]{.mark} the Arctic [Council]{.mark} [to **halt
Chinese incursion**]{.mark} and consolidate Western power over the
Arctic against nation-states [intent]{.mark} on further
[increasing]{.mark} their [own power to the West's
detriment.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### China sees the Arctic as a site for great power competition

Rush **Doshi et. al,** 20**21** \[Rush Doshi, Alexis Dale-Huang, Gaoqi
Zhang, an American political scientist currently serving as senior
fellow for China and director of the Initiative on China Strategy at the
Council on Foreign Relations, April 2021, "Northern expedition: China's
Arctic activities and ambitions", Brookings,
https://www.brookings.edu/articles/northern-expedition-chinas-arctic-activities-and-ambitions/\]

[[China]{.mark} [seeks to be]{.mark}come [a "polar great
power"]{.mark}]{.underline} but downplays this goal publicly. Speeches
by President Xi Jinping and senior Chinese officials with responsibility
for Arctic policy are clear that building China into a "polar great
power" by 2030 is China's top polar goal. Despite the prominence of this
goal in these texts, China's externally facing documents --- including
its white papers --- rarely if ever mention it, suggesting a desire to
calibrate external perceptions about its Arctic ambitions, particularly
as its Arctic activities become the focus of greater international
attention.

2

[China [describes the Arctic as]{.mark} one of the world's "[new
strategic frontier]{.mark}s," **[ripe for rivalry]{.mark}** and
extraction.]{.underline}2 China sees the Arctic --- along with the
Antarctic, the seabed, and space --- as ungoverned or undergoverned
spaces. While some of its external discourse emphasizes the need to
constrain competition in these domains, [several others take a more
cynical view, emphasizing the need to [prepare for competition]{.mark}
within them and [over]{.mark} their [resources]{.mark}]{.underline}. A
head of the Polar Research Institute for China, for example, called
these kinds of public spaces the "most competitive resource treasures,"
China's National Security Law creates the legal capability to protect
China's rights across them, and [[top]{.mark} Chinese Communist Party
(CCP) officials have suggested China's share of these resources should
be equal to its share of the global population]{.underline}.3

3

Chinese [military [texts treat the Arctic as]{.mark} [a zone of]{.mark}
future [military competition]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Although]{.mark}]{.underline} several [[externally]{.mark}
[facing]{.mark} Chinese texts [downplay]{.mark} the risk of [military
competition]{.mark} in the Arctic]{.underline}, which would likely be
harmful to Chinese goals, [[military texts]{.underline}]{.mark} take the
opposite perspective. They [[note]{.mark} that, "[the game of great
powers]{.mark}" [will]{.mark} "increasingly [focus on]{.mark} the
struggle over and [control of global]{.mark} public [spaces" like the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} and Antarctic [[and]{.mark} argue that
[China "**cannot rule out**]{.mark} **the possibility of [using
force]{.mark}**" [in]{.mark} this coming "[scramble for]{.mark} new
[strategic spaces]{.mark}.]{.underline}"4 Chinese [[diplomats
describe]{.mark} the region as the "[new commanding heights" for]{.mark}
[global military competition]{.mark}]{.underline} too while scholars
suggest controlling it allows one to obtain the "three continents and
two oceans' geographical advantage" over the Northern Hemisphere.5

4

Chinese texts make clear that its investments in Arctic science are
intended to buttress its Arctic influence and strategic position.
Although externally facing messaging indicates China's desire to pursue
scientific research for its own benefit and for global welfare, China's
top scientific figures and high-level CCP members are clear that science
is also motivated by a drive for "the right to speak," for cultivating
China's "identity" as an Arctic state, and for securing resources and
strategic access.6 China's polar expeditions and various research
stations assist Beijing with its resource extraction, with Arctic
access, and with acquiring experience operating in the Arctic climate.

5

[[China supports]{.mark} existing [Arctic governance]{.mark} mechanisms
[publicly but complains]{.mark} about them
[privately]{.mark}.]{.underline} Several Chinese texts indicate
frustration with Arctic mechanisms and concern that the country will be
excluded from the region's resources. Official texts suggest gently that
the region's importance now transcends "its original inter-Arctic
States," while scholars once feared Arctic states would launch an
admittedly unlikely "eight-state polar region alliance" or
institutionalize the Arctic Council in ways that "strengthen their
dominant position" at China's expense.7 These texts stress China's
pursuit of "identity diplomacy," namely, terming China a "near-Arctic
State" because it is affected by climate change.8 They also indicate an
interest in pushing alternative Chinese governance concepts --- in some
cases to supplement and other cases to run outside the Arctic Council
--- including a "Polar Silk Road" and China's "community with a shared
future for mankind," though specifics are often lacking.9

6

[[Accommodating]{.mark} [China]{.mark}'s Arctic ambitions [rarely
produces]{.mark} enduring [goodwill]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Norway]{.underline}]{.mark} was the first country to [allow China to
build an Arctic science station and [Sweden]{.mark}]{.underline} was the
first worldwide to [allow]{.underline} China to build its [own
completely China-owned satellite facility]{.underline}. Both [these
[efforts]{.mark}, which [were]{.mark} richly [praised by China]{.mark}
at the time, [did not protect]{.mark} either country [from]{.mark} later
[economic **coercion and**]{.mark} **harsh [condemnation]{.mark}** by
China]{.underline}. In both cases, China punished these countries not
only for the actions of their governments but also for the independent
actions of their civil societies, which were to award Chinese dissident
Liu Xiaobo the Nobel Peace Prize and to investigate China's kidnapping
of Swedish citizen Gui Minhai. [Efforts by both Norway and Sweden to
reverse the slide]{.underline} --- with Sweden keeping relatively quiet
about the rendition of its citizen and Norway vigorously [backing
China's pursuit of Arctic Council observer status]{.underline} --- [were
only met with]{.underline} [restrictions on]{.underline} Norwegian fish
[exports and]{.underline} colorful threats of [coercion]{.underline}
against Sweden.

7

Arctic dependence on trade with China is often overstated, and trade
flows are smaller than with other powers. Chinese economic statecraft is
feared by some in the Arctic and around the world, but the region's
dependence on China is remarkably small. For the five smallest Arctic
economies --- Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, and Iceland --- China
accounts for an average of only 4.0% of their exports, less than the
United States (6.2%) and far less than the NATO and EU economies
excluding the United States (70.3%).10

8

China has invested significantly in Arctic diplomacy to boost its
regional influence. China has sent high-level figures --- at the levels
of president, premier, vice president, foreign minister, and defense
minister --- to visit Arctic countries other than the United States and
Russia 33 times over the last 20 years. Beijing lobbied heavily to
become an Arctic Council observer, became a strong presence at many
other regional Track II fora, and launched its own diplomatic and Track
II regional efforts, including a China-Russia Arctic Forum and the
China-Nordic Arctic Research Center, to deepen relations with
governments and sub-national actors.

9

[[China's military]{.mark} profile [in the Arctic has increased]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} its [scientific efforts]{.mark} [provide strategic
advantages]{.mark} too. China has dispatched naval vessels]{.underline}
to the Arctic on two occasions, including to Alaska and later to
Denmark, Sweden, and Finland for goodwill visits. It has built its first
indigenously produced icebreaker, has plans for more conventional heavy
icebreakers, and is considering investments in nuclear-powered
icebreakers too.

10

China's scientific activities in the Arctic give it greater operational
experience and access. China has sent 10 scientific expeditions into the
region on its Xuelong icebreaker, generally with more than 100 crew
members, that officials acknowledge give it useful operational and
navigational experience. China has also established science and
satellite facilities in Norway, Iceland, and Sweden while pursuing
additional facilities in Canada and Greenland --- with its facility in
Norway able to berth more than two dozen individuals and provide
resupply. Finally, China has used the Arctic as a testing ground for new
capabilities whether related to satellites coverage, fixed-wing
aircraft, autonomous underwater gliders, buoys, and even an "unmanned
ice station" configured for research.

11

[China's [infrastructure]{.mark} investments [in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} sometimes [appear
[dual-use]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Several]{.underline}]{.mark} Chinese
[infrastructure [projects]{.mark}]{.underline} that [have little
economic gain]{.underline} have [[raised concerns about strategic
motivations]{.underline}]{.mark} and dual-use capabilities. These
[[include]{.mark}]{.underline} efforts by a former Chinese propaganda
official to [[purchase]{.mark} 250 square kilometers of Iceland [to
build a]{.mark} golf course and [airfield]{.mark} in an area where golf
cannot be played and later to buy 200 square kilometers of Norway's
Svalbard archipelago]{.underline}. Chinese [companies have also sought
to purchase [a]{.mark}n old [naval base]{.mark} in Greenland; to build
three airports in Greenland]{.underline}; to build Scandinavia's largest
port in Sweden; to [acquire (successfully) [a Swedish submarine
base]{.mark}]{.underline}; to link Finland and the wider Arctic to China
through rail; and to do the same with a major port and railway in
Arkhangelsk in Russia.

Beijing's harmful impact on academic integrity

Polar scientific collaborations can be seen as part of a broader and
more strategic bilateral relationships between Beijing and the Arctic
states. Among the latter, Iceland has been the most proactive and has
been consequently developing closer relations with the PRC for around a
decade, including a bilateral Arctic science exchange that started in
2011. In the case of Norway, following the restoration of relations
between the two countries in December 2016, in April 2018 Norway's
Ministry of Research and Education led a delegation of 250 of the
country's heads of universities and scientists to strengthen the
[[Chinese]{.underline}]{.mark}-Norwegian research collaboration.

Obviously, [[researchers]{.mark} may be **[influenced]{.mark}** either
directly or indirectly [to produce results that support]{.mark} the
**[PRC's Arctic plans]{.mark}** and strategies]{.underline}. By offering
generous grants and treating researchers with dinners and gifts,
government-funded academic exchange programs and conferences aim
primarily at building trust and strengthening the status of Beijing as a
legitimate Arctic stakeholder that is not only interested in the
region's resources.

[Also, these **multilateral** [forums]{.mark} may [put academics under
pressure to **censor**]{.mark} their [works]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Although the Arctic context is less sensitive than other sectors, [[it
is]{.mark} a [priority for]{.mark} the **[Chinese]{.mark} government**
[to advance]{.mark} an [image of its country]{.mark} [as]{.mark} a
[responsible]{.mark} Arctic stakeholder.]{.underline}

A bad example in tackling climate change

Whatever one thinks of the theories of human origin of the climate
change, and the consequent need to reduce human productive activities to
counter it, countries in the world have committed to nationally
determined contributions (NDCs) to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions
as part of climate change mitigation.

[The [**PRC's NDC** is not]{.mark} very [ambitious]{.mark}]{.underline},
and [the [country is likely to]{.mark}]{.underline} meet or [**[exceed
it]{.underline}**,]{.mark} [which would [allow]{.mark} the
[party]{.mark}-state [to use]{.mark} the [results for
**propaganda**]{.mark} purposes both at home and abroad**.
[Beijing]{.mark}**]{.underline} is [[not likely to commit]{.mark} itself
[to]{.mark} more [serious **emissions reductions**]{.mark}
targets]{.underline} in the future. Such a [[commitment would]{.mark} in
fact [cause]{.mark} a [**high risk** of]{.mark} losing face in case of
**[failing]{.mark}** to reach the target.]{.underline}

[China's [NDC is **insufficient**]{.mark} in [to
reach]{.mark}]{.underline} the goal of limiting the global temperature
rise to [**[2°C]{.mark}** that was decided at the **Paris Climate
Accords**]{.underline}**,** the international treaty that was signed in
2016 and is commonly known as "The Paris Agreement." Simply put, unless
other states do not implement much more ambitious emissions reductions
measures, the PRC's poor record on the topic will frustrate and
jeopardize the whole attempt.

\[Image Omitted\]

In particular, [Beijing has not indicated how much its **emissions**
will grow before they **peak**]{.underline}. In 2015, a number of
[[**Arctic Council** observer]{.mark} states
[submitted]{.mark}]{.underline}, on a voluntary basis, their [[national
reports on]{.mark} enhanced black [carbon and methane]{.mark}
**emissions [reductions]{.mark}**,]{.underline} including France, Japan,
Poland, Spain, Korea, India, Italy, and the European Union (EU). [[But
not the **PRC**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Beijing's role as an emitter]{.underline} of greenhouse gases,
including short-lived climate forcers, [is part of the country's broader
**environmental footprint** in the Arctic]{.underline}. [[Chinese
actors]{.mark}]{.underline} may [[affect Arctic]{.mark} habitats more
[directly through]{.mark} the **[investments]{.mark}** of Chinese
companies]{.underline} in places such as Greenland, northern Canada, or
Siberia. [Chinese [**demand** for **resources**]{.mark} is the key
**[contribut]{.mark}or** [to]{.mark} the **[extractive
industries]{.mark}** investment potential [in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. For instance, in 2013, the [PRC imported
more than **60%** of the international iron ore trade]{.underline}. The
country accounted for 44% of global nickel demand in 2011. [Beijing is a
major and growing market for pulp]{.underline} derived from boreal
forests. Moreover, [**[Chinese shipping]{.mark}** activities
[have]{.mark} **marine** and **air [environmental impacts]{.mark}** in
the Arctic, [which are bound to **increase**]{.mark}]{.underline} with
growing traffic.

In other words, the [[PRC]{.mark} largely [contributes to]{.mark} the
[environmental problems of]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline},
most conspicuously [[through]{.mark} the impacts of **[climate]{.mark}
change**]{.underline}, [but also through other
**[pollutants]{.mark}**]{.underline} that end up in the Arctic.
Moreover, the [[country does not participate]{.mark} in the Arctic
Council [**Working Group** on **black carbon** and
methane]{.mark}]{.underline}, which could present an important
contribution to addressing the impacts of climate change (again,
whatever one may think of it) in the North. Part of the black carbon
that is deposited there has its origins in China. **[[Beijing is]{.mark}
in sum part of [the problem, not]{.mark} of [the
solution.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### NB \-\-- China \-\-- Indigenous Rights

Dubious acts toward the indigenous peoples

Last but not least, there are issues with the Arctic indigenous people.
The [**[PRC]{.mark}** has a peculiar understanding]{.underline} of the
matter. [It [perceives]{.mark} that [there are no **indigenous peoples**
within]{.mark} its [borders, as]{.mark} for it being
"[indigenous]{.mark}" [arises]{.mark} exclusively [from]{.mark} the
context of **[colonization and conquest]{.mark}**.]{.underline} You can
call people within your borders "indigenous," the Chinese regime argues,
if and when you are a nasty colonizer that conquered and destroyed them.
Thus, [since [the PRC claims it is not a]{.mark} **nasty
[colonizer]{.mark}** that conquers and destroys]{.underline} (unlike the
West), [[it insists]{.mark} that there are no indigenous people in China
and [all minorities are protected and happy.]{.mark}]{.underline}

In this view of the Chinese government, [the [issue of]{.mark} Arctic's
[**indigenous rights** does not apply to the PRC]{.mark}
itself]{.underline}, but only to others. This means that PRC's
[[international statements]{.underline}]{.mark} on indigenous issues
[are [seen]{.mark} in Beijing as [having **no** **implications** for the
PRC]{.mark}'s **internal affairs**]{.underline}, including their
relations to international criticism of the Beijing government regarding
its policies towards minority ethnic groups, such as the Uyghurs,
Tibetans, Southern Mongolians, and others.

\[Image Omitted\]

In the past, [[Chinese **investors** and]{.mark} financial
**[institutions]{.mark}**]{.underline} have been [[accused of
**neglecting** indigenous interests]{.underline}]{.mark} in places such
as Africa or South America, in particular in cases of hydropower,
mining, and agricultural projects.

It is true, [[Beijing]{.mark} is a fairly vocal [supporter of]{.mark}
indigenous [rights **internationally**, but]{.mark}]{.underline} this
always concerns "the others." [It [does not regard it as a]{.mark}
domestic [Chinese problem, nor as a problem of the
**Arctic**]{.mark},]{.underline} where Beijing tries to expand[. [It
never spoke of]{.mark}]{.underline} indigenous issues in terms of
[[**indigenous rights**, not]{.mark} it has organized [any **practical
co-operation** with the]{.mark} Arctic Council's [Permanent
**Participants**]{.mark}]{.underline} organizations, in contrast to, for
instance, Singapore, India, or the EU.

Also, [Chinese **[investments]{.mark}** related [to tourism]{.mark} have
[proven **controversial**]{.mark}]{.underline} in some parts of the
Arctic. In northeast Iceland, Svalbard and in the Lyngen area in Norway,
[[**Chinese** **billionaire**]{.underline}]{.mark} tycoon Huang Nubo

China was a latecomer to Arctic exploration. While European nations
started traveling to the area as early as the 16th century, it was not
until the late 20th century that China began to engage significantly in
the region. Despite this slow start, [[Beijing]{.mark} is now determined
to position itself as a key player in the Arctic]{.underline}.

[Arctic [ambitions driven by **mercantilism**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Since joining the World Trade Organization in 2001, China's
manufacturing sector has expanded dramatically. The decade that followed
was mutually beneficial: Affluent nations provided technology and
capital while China supplied affordable products. [Beijing remains
optimistic that Europe and North America will continue to be reliable
consumers of Chinese products]{.underline}.

[[As global warming intensifies]{.mark}, Beijing's [interest]{.mark} in
the Arctic [grows]{.mark}, particularly if melting polar ice caps [allow
access through]{.mark} the **[N]{.mark}orthern [S]{.mark}ea
[R]{.mark}oute** in coming decades. This [path]{.mark} is expected to
[offer]{.mark} a **more [cost-effective alternative]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} the [Suez]{.mark} Canal, [reducing transit times]{.mark} by
nine days]{.underline}.

[The region's current shipping lanes are not ideal for China. The
Northwest Passage is less economical and subject to Canadian navigation
rules, while the conditions for shipping via the Arctic Central Passage
are not yet favorable due to environmental and technical
challenges]{.underline}.

Meteorological forecasts indicate that [the Arctic is warming faster
than the rest of the world, leading to a significant reduction in the
area and thickness of the Arctic sea ice]{.underline} since satellite
monitoring began in 1978. Predictions suggest that [by 2030, the Arctic
Ocean may witness its first nearly ice-free summer. By 2050, the
[N]{.mark}orthern [S]{.mark}ea [R]{.mark}oute is [expected to be]{.mark}
**one of the [most efficient shipping]{.mark} paths** [between Asia
and]{.mark} [Europe]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Moreover, [the [Arctic]{.mark} holds [abundant natural
resources]{.mark}, including oil, gas, minerals and fish, with its
untapped oil and gas reserves estimated to comprise about 25 percent of
the world's undiscovered resources.]{.underline}

After over a decade of dedicated efforts, [China has achieved
significant milestones in the Arctic]{.underline}. To date, [China
operates several scientific research stations in the region and has
added two icebreakers to its fleet, which are capable of clearing paths
for merchant ships]{.underline} in northern latitudes. [[China]{.mark}
also secured observer status in the Arctic Council in 2013 and has
[established]{.mark} several agreements with Arctic nations for
**[joint]{.mark} [research and commercial endeavors]{.mark}** in the
Arctic Ocean]{.underline}.

\<\<\<FIGURE 1 OMITTED\>\>\>

In July 2023, a regular Sino-Russian shipping corridor along the Arctic
sea lanes was officially launched, markedly reducing the distance and
time required for cargo transport from Russia's northern ports to China.
In 2023, 80 voyages, comprising cargo ships, cruise ships and oil
tankers, reached Chinese ports via the Arctic waterway. With these
developments, [[China]{.mark} has **[nearly]{.mark}**
[solidified]{.mark} its self-proclaimed [status]{.mark} as a
"near-Arctic country."]{.underline}

Expanding Chinese interests in the Arctic

China's 2018 white paper on its Arctic policy makes the case that
non-Arctic countries, including China, have rights in the region. [China
has actively pursued the right to scientific research, navigation,
overflight, fishing, laying of submarine cables and pipelines, as well
resource exploration and exploitation]{.underline}.

Beijing is well aware of the challenges and high costs associated with
Arctic development and research. Some [80 percent of Arctic resource
research and development is already under the exclusive control of the
circumpolar states, presenting further obstacles for new entrants like
China]{.underline}.

Historically, [the [Arctic represented]{.mark} a model of
[cooperation]{.mark} among the eight circumpolar nations]{.underline}.
However, on March 3, 2022, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway,
Sweden and the United States issued a joint statement announcing the
suspension of their cooperation with Russia within the Arctic Council,
leaving Moscow in need of new partners to develop the region.

Since the onset of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022,
[[Russia]{.mark} has been [making]{.mark} [unprecedented concessions to
Chin]{.mark}a when it comes to Arctic affairs]{.underline}. In March
2023, [the two countries agreed to establish a joint working group to
advance the Northern Sea Route project]{.underline}. The following
month, [they signed a Memorandum of Understanding to enhance cooperation
in maritime law]{.underline}. In May, within the "Arctic Thinking --
Global Thinking" project framework, [BRICS country representatives
convened to formulate a unified Arctic agenda]{.underline}.

\<\<\<CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>\>

China's covert support for Russia's Arctic LNG 2 project The Arctic is
poised to become a vital energy hub for Russia. The Arctic LNG 2
project, the second major onshore gas initiative on the Gydan Peninsula,
is being developed with international collaboration. Russian media
predict that by 2050, these operations could contribute to 9 percent of
global production of liquified natural gas (LNG). To attract foreign
investors, the Russian government has introduced substantial tax breaks
and subsidies. However, the landscape shifted dramatically after
Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Major global oil companies,
including BP, Statoil and ExxonMobil, pulled out of or paused their
collaboration with Russia. Consequently, the Arctic LNG 2 project has
been unable to proceed as originally planned. France's Total, a key
foreign investor in these Arctic ventures, also declared it would cease
funding new projects. In November 2023, the U.S. imposed sanctions on
the Arctic LNG 2 project, into which over \$20 billion had already been
invested. In response to escalating Western measures, Russia offered a
40 percent discount on the sale of LNG. However, a year later, Russia
has still not found a buyer for Arctic LNG 2. China's involvement in
this project mirrors President Xi Jinping's strategy: on one hand
supporting Russia and aiming to prevent the downfall of the Arctic LNG 2
project, while simultaneously not wanting to jeopardize its access to
Western markets. Under pressure from the U.S. and Europe, China's Wison
New Energies officially withdrew from the Arctic LNG 2 on June 21.
However, in August, a small fleet of Chinese cargo ships covertly headed
to the Arctic to support the project. These ships were laden with
substantial power generation equipment for the Arctic LNG 2 project,
provided by Wison New Energies. During its journey within Chinese
waters, one ship changed its name twice to avoid detection. Its
automatic identification system listed Norway as its destination,
masking its true route to Russia. This discreet operation successfully
delivered Modules 1-3 to the project site in Russia. When these
activities were exposed, Wison denied direct involvement and suggested
that a third party was responsible. China did not have sufficient time
to deliver the final two power modules to the Russian Arctic within the
year. With the Arctic summer shipping season over, Modules 4-5 now
remain at the Zhoushan shipyard. Another covert operation will likely
take place next year. Despite Washington explicitly threatening
sanctions against involvement in the Arctic LNG 2 project, on June 7 of
this year PetroChina Chairman Wang Yilin and Novatek Chairman Leonid
Mikhelson signed a share purchase agreement in St. Petersburg. This
agreement stipulated that PetroChina would acquire a 10 percent stake in
Arctic LNG 2. This move was not merely a decision by PetroChina but the
fulfillment of an agreement made between President Xi and President
Vladimir Putin during the former's visit to Moscow in March.
Simultaneously, Beijing continues to engage with the U.S. and Europe.
For instance, on April 16, China and Iceland signed a trade rights
agreement, during which leaders of both nations reaffirmed their
cooperation on Arctic affairs.

Scenarios

Likely: China becomes a forefront player in Arctic development

China's current Arctic operations focus on two main methods: Eurasian
transit of bulk cargo transport through the Northeast Passage and direct
shipments to ports along Russia's Northern Sea Route. When new routes
become navigable, Beijing will be perfectly positioned to expand its
activities. China will even launch tourist cruises to the Arctic on a
large scale in 2025.

This summer, China completed three Arctic research missions and began
building several heavy icebreakers for its coast guard fleet.
Furthermore, it plans to launch a manned submersible to the Arctic
seabed from the polar research vessel Exploration III. Previously
dependent on foreign technology, China will now be able to rely on its
own capabilities.

[Likely: Arctic [cooperation between Russia]{.mark} and [China
intensifies]{.mark}]{.underline}

[All of China's activities in the Arctic are **only possible [thanks to
Moscow]{.mark}'s facilitation**. A commercially viable [shipping
route]{.mark} along Russia's Arctic coast could soon become a reality,
which would be [economically beneficial for both]{.mark} Moscow and
Beijing]{.underline}. A joint venture between Russia's Rosatom and
China's Hainan Yangpu Xinxin Shipping Company is set to construct the
necessary infrastructure and polar-class container ships to operate
these Arctic routes year-round. This development will likely increase
Russian economic dependence on China, but [President [Putin]{.mark} has
few options available to [break out of international isolation]{.mark}
and secure external support [while he]{.mark} **[continues]{.mark}** to
wage **[war against Ukraine]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Beijing seeks to ensure the Northern Sea Route remains free of Western
interference through its cooperation with Russia. For example, the
Chinese Coast Guard recently participated in its first Arctic patrol
with Russia. It is conceivable that [[Russia]{.mark} will [grant China
more influence in Arctic development]{.mark} moving
forward]{.underline}.

At the moment, [the [Arctic capabilities]{.mark} of the democratic
circumpolar states appear to be [less robust than]{.mark} those of
[China and Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}. The U.S. has only two
icebreakers, and Canada does not seem urgently focused on defending the
Arctic's northern reaches.

Two developments are possible. [[If tensions]{.mark} between Russia and
the West [remain high due]{.mark} to the ongoing war in Ukraine, it is
[likely that Russia's joint ventures]{.mark} with China in the Arctic by
China will [expand]{.mark} **[dramatically]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
However, if the Trump administration encourages Ukraine to cede land to
Russia and returns confiscated Russian assets, then perhaps American and
European companies will begin to engage with Russian Arctic projects
again, although this will take time. Meanwhile, China will try to
maintain a facade of diplomatic engagement with other Arctic states.

A Coast Guard cutter spotted the ships during a routine patrol of the
Bering Sea, north of Alaska: a guided missile cruiser and two smaller
ships from China, traveling in formation with four ships from Russia.
The cutter followed until they split up and dispersed.

The ships broke no rules and violated no boundaries. But their
appearance so close to the Arctic this past fall raised concern in
Washington nonetheless. [For years, [China]{.mark} has worked to
[establish footholds]{.mark} in the region that would [give]{.mark} it
[access to rich mineral deposits and shipping lanes]{.mark}, as well as
a greater say in Arctic affairs. That---and a [strategic
presence]{.mark} in a region [ringed by the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark} several other [NATO]{.mark}
countries.]{.underline}

Researchers at RAND and the Swedish Defence Research Agency looked at
where China is operating in the Arctic, what it wants, and what that
could mean for regional security. They concluded that [China has made
only limited inroads in the Arctic, but that\'s not for lack of
trying]{.underline}.

"The threat should not be inflated," said Stephanie Pezard, a senior
political scientist at RAND who specializes in Arctic security. "But at
the same time, [they have a [clear intent]{.mark} to not be excluded
from [Arctic developments]{.mark} as the region becomes more
accessible]{.underline}. The real questions are, How much of a role do
they want, and what does that mean for an Arctic nation like the United
States?"

[[Conditions]{.mark} in the Arctic have always been so [extreme]{.mark},
the [distances]{.mark} so [vast]{.mark}, that [even rivals]{.mark} like
the United States and Russia **[were forced to cooperate
there]{.mark}**. But the [Arctic is warming faster]{.mark} than anywhere
else on the planet. [Sea routes]{.mark} that sailors and explorers have
dreamed about for centuries are [starting to open]{.mark}. The promise
of [Arctic riches]{.mark}---oil, minerals, trade routes, even fish---has
started to [draw interest from far]{.mark} outside the northern
latitudes.]{.underline}

[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} has declared itself a "near-Arctic state,"
a designation it invented to push for a greater role in Arctic
governance. It [has]{.underline} [dispatched research expeditions,
sought to establish mining and gas operations, and envisioned a network
of shipping routes crossing the Arctic, a "**[silk road on
ice]{.mark}**."]{.underline} It describes itself as an "active
participant, builder, and contributor in Arctic affairs," one that has
"spared no efforts to contribute its wisdom to the development of the
Arctic region."

But [in the Arctic]{.underline}, as in the rest of the world, [the
United States sees [China]{.mark} as a potentially [destabilizing
force]{.mark}, with the economic and military power to try to bend the
established order to its liking]{.underline}. The Pentagon considers
China its "pacing challenge" of the foreseeable future. Its Arctic
strategy, released in October, pays particular attention to the risk of
China using commercial or scientific access to the Arctic for military
advantage.

Researchers at RAND set out to document known Chinese activities in the
North American Arctic, which touches Alaska, Canada, and Greenland.
Their counterparts in Sweden focused on the European side, from Iceland,
through the Nordic countries, to Russia.

What they found: Especially in the North American Arctic, "there\'s not
a ton going on," Pezard said. [China has [invested in]{.mark} a handful
of [mining operations]{.mark}, mostly chasing valuable [r]{.mark}are
[e]{.mark}arth [m]{.mark}ineral[s]{.mark}. It has [trade
partnerships]{.mark} [with Greenland]{.mark} and a small stake in a
[zinc mine in Alaska]{.mark}.]{.underline} A Chinese company tried to
buy a shuttered U.S. Navy base in Greenland, but the Danish government
quashed the idea.

[[China]{.mark} has used [loans and infrastructure]{.mark} deals to prop
open the door for itself in countries [across Asia]{.mark}, [Africa, and
Latin America]{.mark}]{.underline}. But the countries of the North
American Arctic have generally taken a hard look at any proposed Chinese
investments---and often a hard pass. Canada blocked a \$150 million gold
mine deal that would have put Chinese interests too close to military
installations. Greenland has held up plans for another Chinese mine over
concerns about pollution.

"We didn\'t see the more nefarious activities that we\'ve seen in other
parts of the world, like predatory lending or influence over local
decisions, that are more damaging to international norms," said Stephen
Flanagan, an adjunct senior fellow at RAND and former senior director
for defense policy and strategy at the U.S. National Security Council.
"[All of the [governments]{.mark} are being [careful in how they deal
with China]{.mark}]{.underline}. It\'s a \'buyer beware\' approach."

RAND\'s study did not include the [[Russian side]{.mark} of the
Arctic]{.underline}. That [may be [China\'s **best route to**]{.mark}
**greater [Arctic]{.mark} [influence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The Arctic
Council, a governing body of Arctic States and indigenous nations,
suspended its [meetings]{.mark} last year, refusing to engage with
Russia after it attacked Ukraine. A panel of experts that RAND convened
for its study noted [that Russia could seek to [form]{.mark} its own
[Arctic governing council, with]{.mark} a **more [central role
for]{.mark} its ally, [China]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The experts thought that was possible, but not necessarily probable.
Despite its joint operation in the Bering Sea this past fall, and
codevelopment of a natural gas project in the Russian Arctic, Moscow has
also been wary of letting China pursue its ambitions so close to its
home shores. And rather than walk away from the existing council, Russia
has called for it to resume its meetings, with Russia back at the table.

For now, [the [U.S. should]{.mark} continue to [make]{.mark} the [Arctic
a diplomatic, economic, and strategic priority]{.mark}, to
[demonstrate]{.mark} its [commitment]{.mark} to the region and its
people]{.underline}, researchers concluded. [It should [work to]{.mark}
[**strengthen solidarity** among]{.mark} its Arctic
[allies]{.mark}]{.underline}---and explore conditions under which it
could restart some engagement with Russia, such as on search-and-rescue
preparedness.

But [the U.S. should also [recognize that engaging with]{.mark} China in
the Arctic [does not have to be]{.mark} a [win-or-lose]{.mark}
proposition. There are [opportunities to
cooperate]{.mark}]{.underline}---[on [climate
change]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example, [or [pollution]{.mark}
control. [China]{.mark} has already played a [key]{.mark} role
[in]{.mark} international agreements to protect [Arctic fisheries
and]{.mark} to create [maritime shipping
regulations]{.mark}]{.underline}. On paper, at least, [both China and
the United States are [committed to ensuring]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark}
remains a region of **[peace and stability]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The next few years will be a crucial test. If current projections hold,
the Arctic could see its first ice-free summer by 2030.

#### China's [working]{.underline} with Russia for [Arctic legitimacy]{.underline}. 

**Garamone 24**, \[Jim Garamone, \"China Increasing Interest in
Strategic Arctic Region,\" DOD News,

Published December 5^th^, 2024, Accessed July 2^nd^, 2025 // ajap\]

The Arctic strategic environment is changing profoundly, and the United
States must pay greater attention and dedicate more resources to this
crucial area, said Iris A. Ferguson, the deputy assistant secretary of
defense for Arctic and Global Resilience.

[Ferguson addressed the [increased attention]{.mark} that the
[P]{.mark}eople\'s [R]{.mark}epublic of [C]{.mark}hina has [in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. She spoke at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies today.

China is, by no means, an Arctic nation. But [Chinese [leaders see the
region as]{.mark} a new crossroads of the world, [a new source of
raw]{.mark} [materials]{.mark} and [new avenues for manifesting]{.mark}
its [growing power]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} is [[working]{.mark} closely [with
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} in its attempt [[to be **seen as an Arctic
power**]{.underline}]{.mark}, Ferguson said. [Even with Russia\'s unjust
war on Ukraine]{.underline}, President Vladimir [[Putin]{.mark} is
[investing]{.mark} heavily [on military and econ]{.mark}omic
[strat]{.mark}egie[s in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. \"We\'re seeing
Russia continue to have immense focus on the Arctic region, and it\'s
part of their ... security calculus, vis-a-vis the U.S. and NATO,\"
Ferguson said. \"Despite the attrition in Ukraine, we still see them
\... heavily focused on the region.\"

[A shifting climate is speeding the pace of change in the
region]{.underline}. \"Climate change is still a factor in the region,
where [the [region]{.mark}]{.underline} [[warms at]{.underline}]{.mark}
some [[four times the rate of the rest of the
world]{.underline}]{.mark},\" she said. [This [means more]{.mark} access
for settlements in the high North and more [chances
for]{.mark}]{.underline} what she calls \"[[competitor
activity]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"

\"\[China\] is one of the newer entrants on the scene,\" Ferguson said.
\"Over time, the strategic interests that they have in the region are
... giving us pause. How their long-term vision for the region could
affect our interests, is \[also\] giving us pause.\"

[Even [more disturbing is]{.mark} the increasing levels of
[collab]{.mark}oration [between Russia and China]{.mark} **especially
[in]{.mark} the [military]{.mark} domain**]{.underline}, she said.
Russia and China exercised together in the Bering Strait in summer of
2023. \"Just this past summer, right after we released our department
\[Arctic\] strategy, [we saw a [joint bomber patrol off]{.mark} of [the
coast of Alaska]{.mark}]{.underline}.\"

[There has also been increasing cooperation between the Chinese and
Russian [coast guards]{.mark} in the region]{.underline}. \"[This kind
of [increasing]{.mark} levels of [military cooperation is
new]{.mark}]{.underline},\" she said. \"Certainly, it\'s new within and
around Alaska.\"

The new DOD Arctic strategy is aimed at preserving the region as a place
that is both stable and secure, Ferguson said. She also discussed the
Defense Department\'s three main lines of effort in the region. The
first is enhancing domain awareness to see and detect threats, and to
ensure U.S. forces can operate in the region effectively.

\"We\'re also really focused on engaging with our allies and partners,\"
she said. These nations are a unique U.S. strategic advantage that
stretches from the border of European Russia to the Bering Strait. These
are \"seven like-minded partners that are incredibly militarily capable
and also have heavy geostrategic alignment with us,\" she said.

Finally, the United States is working on using military exercises in the
region. \"We\'ve long had exercises that operate in the region, but
we\'re really looking at how we can use those as a deterrent effect,
working alongside our allies and partners,\" she said.

There\'s an evolution in how competitors think about the region,
Ferguson said. \"We\'re going to continue on the DOD side to monitor
military activity.\"

But this [attention cannot be]{.underline} just [limited]{.underline} to
that. The Chinese are using other aspects of their national power to
insinuate themselves into the region. [[China]{.mark} is [involved in
**scientific**]{.mark} **and research [projects]{.mark}** in the region.
[China]{.mark} is [looking to **establish**]{.mark} [**economic ties**
within the Arctic]{.mark}.]{.underline} \"We really just need to be
clear-eyed about some of their intentions and, how we can be like
thinking about their long-term interests and, how we can best protect
ours,\" Ferguson said.

China and Russia's strategic alignment and top threats to vital U.S.
interests

[[China's]{.mark} continued economic and diplomatic [support for
Russia]{.mark} enables the latter to **[sustain]{.mark} its [war of
aggression in Ukraine]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This [war
[undermines]{.mark} the [principles of **sovereignty**]{.mark} and
**[territorial integrity]{.mark}** that underpin [**global stability**,
threatens]{.mark}]{.underline} the United States'
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} allies, [[and risks]{.mark} drawing the
United States into [a]{.mark} [**military confrontation** in
Europe]{.mark}. China has supplied Russia with industrial
inputs]{.underline}, many dual use, including microelectronics, military
optics, drone and turbojet engines, armored vehicles, satellite
technology, and materials like nitrocellulose. These exports have flowed
directly through Chinese suppliers and via third countries and have
facilitated the reconstitution of Russia's defense industrial base.
[[China]{.mark} has also undercut efforts to isolate Russia
diplomatically. It continues to [lend credence to Moscow's
narrative]{.mark} that paints Russia as the victim of Western aggression
and NATO expansion]{.underline} as the real driver of the war in
Ukraine. As such, [[Sino-Russian cooperation]{.mark} poses a **direct
threat** to the interests of the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates as well as its European allies and partners.

[China and Russia are [weakening]{.mark}]{.underline} the underpinnings
of [American leadership on the world stage and]{.underline} core
elements of [the existing [rules-based international
order]{.mark}. Beijing and Moscow are disseminating narratives of
terminal U.S. decline across the Global South and developing alternative
supply chains and financial institutions to insulate themselves from
U.S. sanctions. The two states are determined to end]{.underline} what
they see as [a U.S.-dominated international order. [With the]{.mark}
support of the [Global South]{.mark}, [they]{.mark} are seeking to
[create an order in which the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [and its Western partners have a
[diminished]{.mark} role, [and **authoritarian states**]{.mark} are
[free from]{.mark} international [scrutiny]{.mark} and immune to Western
sanctions. The Russia-Ukraine war and the [**escalating crisis** in the
Middle East]{.mark}]{.underline}, which have sharply divided the United
States, its allies, and its partners from much of the rest of the world,
[have [given Beijing and Moscow a **boost**]{.mark} in advancing such
aims.]{.underline}

While China or Russia alone might not present a credible alternate pole,
[a joint China-Russia]{.underline} "pole" is [[appealing to
middle]{.mark} [powers]{.mark} including Turkey, South Africa, Brazil,
regimes in the Middle East, and other Global South states]{.underline}
who [believe]{.underline} that the [current international order does not
sufficiently account for their voices.]{.underline} This is [evidenced
by the growing popularity of the **BRICS** and]{.underline} the
**[Shanghai Cooperation]{.underline}** [**Organization**. Hedging by
these middle powers [creates **geopolitical capital** for Beijing and
Moscow]{.mark}]{.underline}, economic benefits for Moscow in particular,
and limits the influence of the United States, its allies, and its
partners.

China and Russia's [**[deepening military alignment]{.mark}** poses a
**challenge** to U.S. interests in the Indo-Pacific
region.]{.underline} China-Russia [military interactions, including
joint exercises, have increased in frequency]{.underline} over the
decades. In recent months, the two countries have held live-fire
maritime drills in the South China Sea and joint long-range bomber
patrols near Alaska. While [cooperation and integration between the
P]{.underline}eople's [L]{.underline}iberation [A]{.underline}rmy [and
the R]{.underline}ussian [A]{.underline}rmed [F]{.underline}orces are
still limited, there is considerable potential for [deeper
integration]{.underline}. These [[developments complicate **strategic
planning** for the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline},
its [[allies, and]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[partners]{.mark} given how
[**costly** and **complex**]{.mark} it would be [to deter]{.mark}

[**technological cooperation** in]{.mark} the [military

For years, the U.S. has been pushed by military officials and lawmakers
to devote more resources to the rapidly evolving Arctic environment, but
it is a [**recent surge** in]{.underline} regional [[collaboration
between China]{.underline}]{.mark} [and [Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}
that is [giving [rise]{.mark} to an all-[new]{.mark} sense of
**[urgency]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Speaking at the Center for Strategic and International Studies on
Thursday, Iris A. Ferguson, the deputy assistant secretary of defense
for Arctic and Global Resilience, warned that [Beijing]{.underline} [is
increasingly eyeing the [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} as a domain that
would [[further China's **power assertions** and economic
resources]{.underline}.]{.mark}

Those [[concern]{.mark}s]{.underline} have been [[amplified]{.mark}
by]{.underline} a [[swarm]{.mark} of [recent military
activity]{.mark}]{.underline} in the region. [**Despite
[Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline} approaching its third year of war
following its February 2022 [**invasion of Ukraine**, it has remained
committed to [directing military and economic resources to]{.mark} the
[region]{.mark}]{.underline} --- at times **[[with
China]{.underline}]{.mark}** by its side.

In summer 2023, [Russian and Chinese militaries conducted [joint
training]{.mark}]{.underline} in the [[Bering
Strait]{.underline}]{.mark}, a [**[strategic
waterway]{.mark}**]{.underline} separating Russian and Alaskan
peninsulas. [Joint [air exercises]{.mark}]{.underline} and patrols by
the two nations' coast guards have [since [added]{.mark} to the
[uneasiness]{.mark} stirring [in]{.mark} the
[Pentagon]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"[This kind of [increasing]{.mark} levels of [military
cooperation]{.mark} is [new]{.mark}]{.underline}," Ferguson said.
"Certainly, it's new within and around Alaska. \... Just this past
summer, right [after we released our department \[Arctic\] strategy, we
[saw]{.mark} a [**joint bomber patrol** off]{.mark} of the
[coast]{.mark}."]{.underline}

[[China's]{.underline}]{.mark} regional
[[ambitions]{.underline}]{.mark}, meanwhile, are [[not limited]{.mark}
to]{.underline} a [military]{.underline} presence, Ferguson said.
[Scientific research projects]{.underline}, among other endeavors, have
[provided another gateway]{.underline} through which Beijing is staking
claim.

Such [[projects]{.underline}]{.mark} could yield long-term economic
gains while [[plant]{.underline}]{.mark}ing **[[China on America's
doorstep.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

"We really just need to be clear-eyed about some of their intentions and
\... thinking about their long-term interests and how we can best
protect ours," Ferguson said. "The [[strategic
interests]{.underline}]{.mark} that [they have]{.underline} in the
region are ... **[[giving us pause]{.underline}]{.mark}**."

In its 2024 Arctic Strategy, the Pentagon noted the "[increasingly
accessible [region]{.mark} is [becoming]{.mark} a [venue]{.mark} for
strategic [competition, and]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[must stand ready]{.mark} to meet the **[challenge]{.mark}** alongside
allies and partners]{.underline}."

[In every region]{.underline} on Earth, [climate change is threatening
societies and ecosystems]{.underline} with a variety of extreme
conditions, while resources to address these threats remain scarce.
[These [conditions demand]{.mark}]{.underline} a greater reliance on
**[[international cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, science diplomacy,
[[and a **collaborative approach**]{.mark} to regional
priorities.]{.underline} A region such as the "Third Pole" would do well
to examine how [[the Arctic Council]{.mark} structure]{.underline} for
international [cooperation has [helped]{.mark} the Arctic as a whole
[address pressing issues]{.mark}]{.underline}, and how something similar
might allow other regions to improve their understanding of
environmental changes, prepare for likely social impacts, and build
resilience for the future.

[[The Arctic Council]{.mark}, the premier intergovernmental
forum]{.underline} for the Arctic region, was established after a series
of convenings, agreements, and initiatives set in motion by Mikhail
Gorbachev's "Zone of Peace" speech in 1987, in which he indicated
openness to a multilateral forum in the Arctic. With strong and
persistent leadership from Canada and Finland, what began as the Arctic
Environmental Protection Strategy blossomed into [the Arctic
Council]{.underline} with the signing of the Ottawa Declaration in 1996.
[[With]{.mark} equally **[persistent leadership]{.mark}**]{.underline}
and advocacy [[from Indigenous leaders]{.underline}]{.mark}, the Council
charter included language providing for the direct but non-voting
participation of Indigenous organizations of the North -- a novel
arrangement that elevated Indigenous voices and enhanced the Council's
regional credibility.

The Arctic Council is unusual among intergovernmental institutions in
that it has no authority and no specific responsibility other than to
focus on the way in which the eight Arctic nations can work together on
topics of mutual concern. The framers limited the topics to two
categories: sustainable development and environmental protection.

The Arctic Council has [[leveraged]{.mark} its [consensus]{.mark}-based
structure [to]{.mark} create common ground and [address **international
priorities.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Since its inception in 1996, the Arctic Council has expanded from a
modest semi-annual convening for a small group of representatives from
eight nations and three Indigenous groups, to an umbrella entity with
hundreds of participants, six Indigenous Permanent Participant
organizations, formal observers from states and organizations around the
world, and a long list of significant accomplishments.

[Despite its lack of formal authority, the [Arctic Council]{.mark} has
leveraged its consensus-based structure to [create common ground]{.mark}
and address international priorities. For example, the potential for
[maritime]{.mark} [disasters such as]{.mark} the grounding of [oil
tankers]{.mark} or cruise ships in the Arctic [is of interest to]{.mark}
each and [every arctic nation]{.mark}, particularly the five with
coastal areas that could be directly impacted. Over several years, [the
Council, through]{.mark} the [work of]{.mark} its [Protection]{.mark} of
the Arctic Marine [Environment]{.mark} [Working Group]{.mark}, gathered
information, interviewed experts and [developed consensus]{.mark} papers
[to]{.mark} [describe]{.mark} the potential [risks]{.mark} and
alternatives [for minimizing]{.mark} those [risks]{.mark}. They focused
on methods that the countries could use to coordinate responses, rather
than each country simply going it alone.]{.underline}

The resulting Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment (AMSA), which was
completed and published more than 10 years ago, is still considered
foundational for ongoing efforts to make the Arctic Ocean shipping
regime safer. It described the importance of coordinated response
planning and communication among the responding agencies, and played a
role in the development of the first two legally binding agreements
signed by the Arctic Council Ministers -- the Agreement on Cooperation
on Aeronautical and Maritime Search and Rescue in the Arctic and the
Agreement on Cooperation on Marine Oil Pollution Preparedness and
Response in the Arctic. The working group and the many experts who were
consulted to produce that AMSA report demonstrated that common interests
could be best addressed with coordinated action, and that each country's
prevention and response capabilities would benefit.

Climate change is another primary concern of Arctic nations and
residents, as the Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of
the planet, on average, and this accelerating trend is leading to
dramatic economic, cultural, and ecological change. The Arctic is
essentially one climate system, so understanding the true extent of
change, whether it be sea surface temperature or water salinity,
requires data from many different locations around the circumpolar
Arctic.

Thanks to the work of the Arctic Council's Arctic Monitoring and
Assessment Working Group, the Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna
Working Group, and the International Arctic Science Committee, the first
Arctic Climate Impact Assessment was delivered to the Council in 2005.
Along with several updates, this coordinated international report has
elevated climate change understanding for all Arctic nations and the
world in a way that any single nation's reporting had not. The Arctic
Council was able to command attention and dedicate resources and
international focus to this issue consistent with what each of the
Arctic nations needed to know: the rate of change and how change was
manifesting in impacts to both natural systems and human society. This
coordinated effort benefited individual countries, the region as a
whole, and the world, as Arctic warming has a significant impact on
global climate.

Organizations based on both self and mutual interest have longevity,
even when challenged by extreme conditions.

The deliverables of the Arctic Council can go well beyond reports. In
2011 the Ministers approved the development of an Arctic Resilience
Assessment. When that world-class research was delivered in 2016, it was
quickly followed up with the world's first regional resilience framework
to organize and measure progress of resilience efforts in the
circumpolar Arctic. The Arctic Resilience Action Framework was approved
by the Arctic Foreign Ministers in 2017, and called for an Arctic
Resilience Forum to take place every two years to assess progress and
identify gaps. The Resilience Forum in 2020, hosted by the Icelandic
Chairmanship and delivered virtually over the course of 10 weekly
sessions, featured nearly 100 speakers and over 1400 attendees. It was
so successful that the Council's Sustainable Development Working Group
approved a project in 2021 to address community needs and opportunities
discussed in the Forum.

[These are just three [examples]{.mark}, among many others, that
[demonstrate how]{.mark} the [work coordinated]{.mark} under the Arctic
Council has [contributed to]{.mark} both [individual and collective
interests of the Arctic]{.mark} [nations]{.mark}]{.underline}. The novel
structure of the Council itself has also paid dividends, particularly
with the inclusion of Indigenous organizations as Permanent
Participants. While the Working Groups have produced world class
research and reporting, and [[several]{.mark} international
[agreements]{.mark} have [been signed]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} it
is the work of the Permanent Participants that has kept the Council
focused on the needs of the people of the North and the ecosystems they
depend upon.

[The Arctic]{.underline}, often associated with serene landscapes and
wildlife, [is not just a picturesque region but a strategically
important area shaped by environmental, political, economic, and
military forces. During the Cold War, it was a battleground between
the]{.underline} United States ([US]{.underline})[,]{.underline} the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization ([NATO]{.underline}), [and
the]{.underline} Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
([USSR]{.underline}). [Post-Cold War, Arctic nations sought to preserve
it as a zone of cooperation]{.underline}. 1) However, [the strategic
competition among the US, Russia, and the]{.underline} People's Republic
of China ([PRC]{.underline}) [has significantly elevated its
geopolitical importance in the past decade. The military advancements of
Russia and PRC, in **contrast to slower efforts** by the US and NATO,
have turned the Arctic into a **critical focus** for security, resource
access, and control over emerging shipping routes]{.underline}.

In 2009, global interest in the Arctic surged when the US Geological
Survey estimated the Arctic held 13 percent of the world's undiscovered
oil and 30 percent of the world's natural gas. 2) That same year, the US
hosted the Arctic Council Ministerial Meeting to reaffirm cooperation.
[When Russia asserted its claims over arctic territory, the tone shifted
from **collaboration to competition**]{.underline}. Russia's tenor was
not unprecedented; in 2007, Russian submarines planted a Russian flag on
the North Pole, proclaiming, "The Arctic is Russian."3)

The 2013 launch of the US National Strategy for the Arctic Region set
the stage for today's geopolitical landscape. By 2022, Russian
militarism and PRC's 'Polar Silk Road' ambitions prompted the US to
update its Arctic strategy, emphasizing military readiness,
infrastructure, and NATO collaboration.4) The Biden administration
further prioritized investments in icebreakers, climate action, and
Indigenous involvement, striking a delicate balance between national
security and sustainable development in this increasingly contested
region.5)

Background

[Since 2009, the US has issued several Arctic policy
documents]{.underline}. The 2009 Arctic Region Policy Directive marked a
significant shift in US assessment by recognizing the Arctic's
importance, particularly in terms of energy and security.6) The 2013
National Strategy for the Arctic Region highlighted energy and US
security, environmental preservation, freedom of navigation, access to
resources, commerce protection, and peaceful resolution.7)

The 2022 National Strategy for the Arctic Region was more urgent.
Marie-Anne Coninsx, a senior fellow at the Egmont Institute and former
EU Ambassador (Arctic), noted that in prior years, US Arctic commitment
was "not high on the US Federal Agenda."8) The Strategy marked a shift
in US policy, acknowledging the Arctic as a critical and addressing
challenges that had emerged since 2013. It identified four key Pillars:
security, climate change/protection, sustainable development, and
international governance.9) The strategy emphasized climate change and
investing in sustainable development while increasing capabilities to
prevent threats to the US and its allies.10) Furthermore, it recognized
the heightened strategic competition in the Arctic, exacerbated by
Russia's invasion of Ukraine.11) In 2023, US Army General VanHerck
advocated to Congress the urgent need for a focused Arctic Strategy,
enhanced domain awareness, and the creation of a comprehensive defense
framework as these challenges were being driven further by advancing
climate change and rising security challenges.12)

The 2024 Department of Defense (DoD) Arctic Strategy further recognizes
the Arctic's growing importance due to climate change, geopolitical
shifts, and increasing great-power competition and directs the DoD to
"enhance its Arctic capabilities, deepen engagement with Allies and
partners, and exercise our forces to build readiness for operations at
high latitudes."13) It highlights critical defense objectives, including
protecting US sovereignty, maintaining stability, and ensuring the
Arctic's role as a secure avenue for power projection. The 2024 Strategy
includes specific initiatives such as enhanced domain awareness;
increased communication, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
capabilities; better understanding of cold-weather operations; and
conducting key routine training alongside US allies to strengthen joint
capabilities.14) The strategy emphasizes cooperation with, and
participation of, Arctic nations and Indigenous communities. It
underscores climate adaptation measures. Through these efforts, the DoD
seeks to maintain a "monitor-and-respond" posture, ensuring the Arctic
remains peaceful while adapting to dynamic environmental and security
conditions.

Climate change and security

[Climate change has rapidly transformed the Arctic, making previously
inaccessible areas more available **for economic and strategic use**.
The]{.underline} North Sea Route ([NSR]{.underline}) [and
the]{.underline} Northwest Passage ([NWP]{.underline}) [could become
economically viable]{.underline} by 2023, 15) potentially diverting
traffic from the Suez Canal. [As access to critical resources expands,
states will shift strategies and **intensify competition** over the
Arctic's growing economic and military significance]{.underline}. This
[competition has also been driven by]{.underline} its
[militarization]{.underline}.16) [Over the past decade, **Russia has
modernized** its Arctic military bases, deployed defense missiles, and
upgraded its submarine fleet while developing fisheries, petroleum, and
mineral extraction]{.underline}.17) [Russia's restrictive NSR claims
have further escalated tensions]{.underline}, especially following its
invasion of Ukraine. Meanwhile, [PRC signaled growing ambitions having
ramped up its Arctic investments, researched military applications, and
expanded its icebreaker fleet]{.underline}.18) These [developments
highlight the Arctic's evolving role in economic opportunity and
strategic rivalry, posing significant challenges to US grand
strategy]{.underline}.

American Grand Strategy

The 2009 Arctic Region Policy shifted away from the apathetic post-Cold
War US Arctic strategy, recognizing the Arctic as an emerging critical
region but only identified two focal points: energy and security.19) The
2022 National Strategy for the Arctic Region was comprehensive,
addressing the Pillars of security, climate change/environmental
protection, sustainable development, and international governance.
Changes in the physical, financial, and geopolitical landscape have
shifted American grand strategy in the Arctic, ending the previous three
decades of stability following the Cold War and reflecting rising
geopolitical tensions between Russia and Arctic stakeholders.

Energy

The US is vested in the Arctic's oil and natural gas, with Alaska's
Prudhoe Bay Oil Field being North America's most prominent; in the
2000s, Prudhoe Bay typically produced about 8% of America's domestic
oil.20) The importance of Arctic oil to America's energy independence
was demonstrated in 2006 when a leak in a critical pipeline at Prudhoe
Bay forced the line's shutdown while the US and Iran were in a dispute.
At the same time, tensions in the Middle East made it difficult for the
US to buy reasonably priced foreign oil. The total cost of oil increased
3% domestically.21)

The 2009 Arctic Region Policy aimed to increase US oil independence by
accessing Alaskan oil deposits. While it received support from energy
independence advocates, it was also met with resistance from
environmentalists, thus hindering implementation.22) This debate
persisted over the years, shaping subsequent approaches to Arctic
resource development. The Trump administration (2021) issued drilling
leases on more than 400,000 acres in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge.23) In contrast, the 2022 National Strategy for the Arctic
acknowledges the region's economic reliance on hydrocarbon production
while advocating for economic diversification, a transition to green
energy and environmental protection.24) In 2024, the US Department of
the Interior denied commercial access to a copper deposit through Gates
of the Arctic National Park. It banned oil drilling in half of the
National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska.25) Environmentalists and tribal
leaders praised these decisions, but Alaska's officials criticized
them.26)

The relationship between environmentalism and energy complicates the US
grand strategy in the Arctic, creating inconsistency due to fluctuating
politics, public opinion, and stakeholder support. This makes long-term
planning for Arctic energy difficult, as [leadership changes can shift
priorities between resource extraction and environmental protections and
alter the trajectory of US Arctic strategy]{.underline}. Such volatility
hampers coherent, long-term policies essential for the region's energy
security and ecological sustainability, making it a contentious issue
influenced by electoral outcomes and shifting public opinion.

Security

The 2009 US Arctic Region Policy's focus on security has evolved
significantly. [Previously, the US emphasized unilateral security and
preferred bilateral agreements to regional cooperation while ignoring
Arctic issues]{.underline}.27) [Post-Cold War, Russia expanded its
presence in the Arctic, reverting to Cold War norms]{.underline}. In
response, [the 2022 National Strategy now prioritizes American people
and sovereign territory and rights, committing to enhance capabilities
through infrastructure improvements, including an expanded icebreaker
fleet, and **strengthening cooperation with Arctic allies against
Russian aggression**]{.underline}.28)

In his 1987 Murmansk speech, Mikhail Gorbachev described the Arctic as a
"peace and cooperation zone," emphasizing collaboration over
competition.29) However [during the 2000s, in response to an increased
perception of NATO's Arctic presence and strategic importance, Russia
began militarizing the region, seeking to reclaim its superpower status
after the Soviet Union's collapse]{.underline}.30) By 2019, Russia had
established 14 airfields, six military bases, refurbished 16 Soviet-era
deep-water ports, and 10 border posts in the Arctic, with its Northern
Fleet boasting an estimated 120 ships, including 40 icebreakers.31)
Russia allowed PRC to construct docks at five of the most significant
ports along Russia's Arctic coastline.32) In contrast, the US needs to
develop a centralized command structure in the Arctic, a crucial aspect
of its security policy.33) It has only one significant base at Pituffik
Space Base in Greenland, with two additional bases south of the Arctic
Circle in Alaska.34) The US has only two ocean-going icebreakers. There
is a stark disparity in military presence between Russia and the US, a
potential security dilemma. [Russia's action, and the US's inaction,
underscore the Arctic's strategic importance and the urgency for a
comprehensive security strategy.]{.underline}

Russia has fortified the region to protect future strategic and economic
interests.35) [The US has interpreted this as an attempt to achieve
regional dominance, prompting numerous military operations in the
area]{.underline}.36) [Moscow views US actions as **aggressive
intrusions into Russian territory**, which has led to **further
militarization on both sides**]{.underline}.37)

This ongoing dynamic was exemplified when US Vice Admiral Lewis claimed
that his fleet was prepared to secure sea lanes in the Atlantic and
Arctic.38) A Russian Duma member responded by stating that the US should
not tempt fate and that the NSR and Arctic were Russia's responsibility
where Russian national interests are present.39) The current US Grand
Strategy has acted firmly but lacks consistent messaging. For example,
in 2019, Secretary of State Pompeo decried Russian aggression in the
Arctic, citing their regulations on NSR shipping, Arctic fortification,
and actions in Ukraine.40) However, Pompeo's message lacked specificity
about why the US felt threatened, simply stating that the US would host
military exercises and increase its presence in the Arctic.41) [The US
must ensure that its actions in the Arctic are firm, **predictable,
consistent, and straightforward** to avoid further escalating
tensions.]{.underline}

The US must improve its messaging on Arctic security by clearly
communicating its policies and red lines to Russia to avoid
misinterpretations and unintended confrontations. However, it's also
important to recognize that [the Arctic offers **opportunities for
cooperation**. Enhanced communication can address immediate threats and
foster **stable regional collaboration**]{.underline}. By improving its
messaging strategy, the US can more effectively navigate the complex
geopolitical landscape and reduce the risks of escalating tensions with
Russia.

Economics

The future of the American Grand Strategy will be influenced by
accessibility of the NSR and NWP, which has historically been limited
due to short operational seasons (sea ice, weather) and limited
infrastructure. These routes are, however, becoming viable with the
NSR's navigation season expected to extend from three to six months and
the NWP's from two to four months by 2100.42) If these projections hold,
transporting goods from Europe to the Far East via the NSR could be 25
percent more profitable than the Suez Canal Route.43)

The current shipping industry is already challenged. In 2023, Houthi
attacks in the Red Sea led seven major shipping companies to alter their
routes, resulting in fewer ships using the Suez Canal. Meanwhile, severe
drought in Panama caused a 30 percent decrease in trade since November
2023.44) These disruptions have led to a 283 percent increase in the
cost of a 40-foot container transiting from PRC to northern Europe.45)
These challenges have highlighted the need for alternative shipping
routes, making the Arctic routes increasingly important.

The future accessibility of the Arctic makes it more critical than ever
however, the West's investment is lagging.46) In contrast, Russia has
prioritized the development of the Arctic to attract traffic,
particularly the NSR. From 2011 to 2015, the Russian Arctic doctrine
focused on establishing new ports, customs facilities, and marine
checkpoints along the Arctic Coastline.47) Vladimir Putin has stressed
the NSR's strategic importance, and Russia's development plan for 2035
includes \$19 billion in infrastructure investments.48) These
commitments underscore Russia's recognition of the value of the NSR and
the potential increase in cargo transport in the north.

The development of the NSR is also of interest to PRC, who referred to
it as part of the Polar Silk Road in its 2018 Arctic White Paper and the
14th Five-Year Plan.49) Putin's 2023 visit to PRC aimed to enhance the
NSR's integration into the Belt and Road Initiative.50) PRC's NSR use
has steadily increased, with transits rising from 27 in 2018 to 62 in
2020.51) The economic benefits, predicted to be 25 % greater than those
of the Suez Canal Route, are also a significant driver of PRC's growing
NSR interest.52) PRC stands to gain significantly from Russian NSR, and
Arctic expansion, in general.

In contrast, Europe and Japan have a more complicated view of the NSR.
Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, there was a decline in NSR
transit due to sanctions on Russia.53) However, by 2023, transits had
rebounded, with increased transport of Russian LNG to Europe.54) Despite
condemning Russia's actions, Japan has not avoided the NSR, indicating
that economic advantages often outweigh political considerations.

Shifting maritime traffic from the Suez Canal to the NSR requires the US
to reevaluate trade routes and competitive strategies. As European and
Asian partners increasingly use the NSR, they will need to maintain good
relations with Russia, which could limit their willingness to oppose
Russia, giving Russia a strategic advantage. The US must consider this
shift in geopolitical power while also closely monitoring the growing
partnership between Russia and the PRC in the Arctic.

Increased access to energy and mineral resources extraction due to ice
melt, holds significant capacity for growth.55) The area is home to 22
percent of the world's resources, which includes up to 25 percent of
unexplored oil and gas reserves. Despite having no Arctic land, PRC
refers to itself as a "near Arctic state," investing heavily in the
region. In 2012, PRC invested \$12 billion in the Russian Yamal LNG
project after US sanctions left Russia short on funds.56)

Furthermore, in 2018, PRC signed an agreement to invest in Alaskan
natural gas export facility,57) and in 2019, Chinese companies purchased
10 percent (\$5.6 billion) of the most prominent Russian natural gas
producer.58) PRC has unsuccessfully attempted to buy mines in Nunavut59)
and recently increased research and land acquisition efforts in the
Svalbard.60) PRC is clearly committed to Arctic resources.

The Arctic's growing accessibility is changing global trade and
economics, necessitating an adaptation of US grand strategy. Considering
the potential opportunities and challenges posed by Russia's and China's
growing commercial influence, the Arctic will play a crucial role in
future global trade, resource extraction, and international relations,
making it a key consideration for American strategic planning.

Conclusion

[Arctic development and policies have transitioned from cooperative to
competitive due to Russian development, militarization, and the PRC's
expanding influence, necessitating a recalibrated US grand
strategy]{.underline}. The 2022 US National Strategy for the Arctic
Region presented a comprehensive response, prioritizing security,
climate resilience, sustainable development, and international
governance. Its multi-pronged approach, emphasizing the immediate need
for a unified NATO Arctic strategy, furthers US interests and aligns
military, economic, and environmental policies among Arctic NATO
members.

[When engaging Russia, the US must present a strong deterrent while
pursuing selective diplomatic efforts on shared concerns such as
environmental protection and accident prevention]{.underline}. This
balanced strategy, valuing both strength and diplomacy, is necessary [to
reduce the risk of miscalculations]{.underline}. At the same time,
[strengthening the US role in multilateral forums like the Arctic
Council is essential to counter PRC's influence and prevent it from
gaining leverage as a self-proclaimed "near-Arctic"
stakeholder.]{.underline}

Climate change will create shipping opportunities and natural resource
access, accompanied by the potential for economic growth and strategic
challenges. In navigating this evolving landscape, the US strives to
balance energy, security, and environmental protection but conflicting
interests complicate policy coherence. [Political changes and
stakeholder sentiment can significantly shape strategy, often resulting
in **abrupt shifts**]{.underline}. Maintaining [consistency is crucial,
especially as environmental issues increasingly intersect with energy
independence and national security]{.underline}.

[Security remains central to US strategy, but vulnerabilities exist due
to military and infrastructure gaps. Russia's aggressive Arctic buildup
contrasts with the US's limited fleet and infrastructure. The US relies
on strengthening alliances]{.underline}, mainly [through
NATO]{.underline}, which Sweden now reinforces and Finland's membership.
[Balancing defense, diplomacy, and coalition-building is vital to
safeguarding US interests and Arctic stability]{.underline}. The US can
shape the Arctic's future through strategic investments and leadership,
ensuring alignment between national security, environmental, and
economic goals.

Going forward, the 2024 DoD Arctic Strategy implements essential
initiatives of the 2022 Arctic Strategy. It strengthens grand strategy
by identifying the Arctic as a critical arena for power projection,
alliance strengthening, climate adaptation, and resilience. Its'
approach forms a cohesive response to Russian aggression and build-up,
PRC ambition, collaboration between Russia and PRC, the addition of
Sweden and Finland to NATO and climate change. To that end, it supports
improved Arctic capabilities, force readiness for high latitude
operations, and deeper engagement with Allies.61) Given adequate
resources and a functioning joined-up government, the DoD strategy will
help maintain stability and security in the Arctic.

On December 19, the [[US]{.mark} Department of State]{.underline}
released the "Announcement of US Extended Continental Shelf Outer
Limits", which has [[extended]{.mark} the outer [limits of the US
continental shelf in the Arctic]{.mark} by approximately one million
square kilometers]{.underline}. According to [[the document]{.mark},
this [fully complies with]{.mark} the 1982 United Nations Convention on
the Law of the Sea ([UNCLOS]{.mark}), and the Scientific and Technical
Guidelines of the Commission on the Limits of the Continental
Shelf]{.underline}. [Construed by Russia as "anti-Russian provocation"
[this will]{.mark} further **[increase tensions in the Arctic]{.mark}**
region]{.underline}, a strategically important macro-region which used
to enjoy a status of "conflict free zone" and is now becoming an arena
of unravelling geopolitical tensions.

The main issue this piece is seeking to address is: what would be the
likeliest and the most realistic response of the Russian side and what
should the US and its Arctic allies expect next?

What are the stakes for Russia?

On December 11, speaking at the convention for the development of key
residential areas in the Arctic region, Vladimir Putin explicitly stated
that the "development of the Arctic is an undisputed priority for the
Russian Federation" due to its colossal geo-economic potential as well
as a factor of Russia\'s national security and defence.

In my view, however, for Russia the value of the Arctic region well
exceeds geo-economic interests and rather illusory security concerns. In
the light of Russia\'s post-2014 transformation translated into
re-emerging neo-imperial expansionism, it is clear that the Arctic has
transformed into a fundamental pillar of Russia\'s statehood and
national identity. At this juncture it is worth remembering that in
2015---after Kremlin\'s neo-colonial territorial grab in Ukraine and
initiation of the new chapter of "adventures" on the Middle
East---Russia officially stepped forward with a territorial claim in the
Arctic, giving a new breath to the idea of "Arctic exceptionalism".

Thus, one might theorize that prospective geopolitical defeat(s) in the
Arctic---in addition to overall humiliating course of Russia\'s war in
Ukraine, economic stagnation and traces of political discord best
reflected in Prigozhin\'s unsuccessful mutiny---would have serous
negative consequences for Kremlin\'s credibility and its image both
domestically and abroad.

The likeliest scenario: what could Russia\'s response look like?

[Analysis of [immediate reaction of]{.mark} leading [Russian
policymakers]{.mark} and officials has not become a revelation:
catchphrases like "provocation" and "[violation of]{.mark}
[i]{.mark}nternational [law]{.mark}" are dominating the
discourse.]{.underline} Additionally, one could also gain an impression
that the Russian side has not been overwhelmed by the US move.
Interestingly, [Russia\`s key political figures]{.underline} such as a
hardliner from the Federation Council Vladimir Dzhabarov urged to make a
[[distinction between]{.mark} "putting [**a claim**" and]{.mark} "being
able to **[do something]{.mark}**" due to the lack of capabilities,
[referring to]{.mark} the [US lack of]{.mark} icebreakers and necessary
[infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Prior to discussing Russia\'s potential response, I would articulate one
aspect: Russia\'s behavior in the Arctic in general and Kremlin\'s
potential/prospective strategic response to the US in particular, will
most likely depend on the outcome of Russia\'s war in Ukraine that will
include, among others such variables as (a) the shape, form and
conditions of the Russian Federation as a polity, (b) the state of its
economy, (c) military capabilities and potential, (d) the configuration
of political architecture in the country. In this piece I premise my
forecast on an assumption that Putin\'s regime will not collapse in the
next several years and even if some changes ensue---such as replacement
of Putin by one of this close associate and/or an advent of a collective
governance---the architecture survives in one form or another.

Taken this into consideration, in my opinion, [[Russia\'s]{.mark}
likeliest and most realistic [response]{.mark}]{.underline} to the US
will go through two potentially interrelated---and to a large extent
contingent on external factors---stages.

In scopes of the first stage Russia---which clearly lacks strategic
resources for an adequate response and being enmeshed into bloody and
economically costly war with Ukraine---will most likely pursue a course
of action that could be conditionally called the "imitation of response"
that [[will employ]{.mark} three main tools]{.underline}.

1\. [(Dis)informational campaigns and [anti-US
propaganda]{.mark}]{.underline}. Russia will continue its rhetorical
escapades and informational campaigns akin to the ones that surrounded
Russia\'s de-facto temporary exclusion from the Arctic Council (AC) and
NATO\'s Nordic enlargement in the post-2022 interim.

2\. [[Changes to]{.mark} existing [legal framework]{.mark}. Russia
[could]{.mark} make a decision to [denounce]{.mark} its participation in
the [UNCLOS]{.mark}]{.underline}---especially given massive
informational campaign that labels it as an "America\'s anti-Russian
invention" that had started before the US decision---and shut down
Russia\`s portion of the Arctic to so-called "unfriendly countries".

3\. [Continued (limited) **[remilitarization of the
Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Despite some overarchingly buoyant
declarations about readiness to dramatically increase military
capabilities and combat readiness of Arctic-deployed formations (both
land- and sea-based) turning the region into an impregnable military
bastion, there are doubts that Russia will be able o deliver on this
promise. In addition to already mentioned drain of resources caused by
the war against Ukraine, Russia\'s current military capabilities in the
Arctic exceed other Arctic nations and, what is more important, Russia
does not seriously entertain the idea of the war in the Arctic given
existing balance of power in the macro-region. Undoubtedly, [Russia
could [introduce]{.mark} some pilot versions of [new]{.mark} types of
(special) [equipment]{.mark} specifically [designed for operations in
the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}---for instance, project IBSV02 vessel
(currently being completed in Turkey for Russia) that are reportedly
capable of carrying various types of UAVs---as well as some other
changes. Yet, until the war against Ukraine does not come to an end
Russia will not be able to commit large resources to accomplish drastic
re-militarization of the Arctic.

In case of a favorable outcome of the war in Ukraine for Russia---which
will most likely strengthen anti-Westernism, isolationism and militarism
in the country, making Russia\'s strategic dependence on China even
greater---or the war dragging on further on, Moscow could be compelled
to make some serous concessions to China which will include, among
others, giving Beijing greater access to the Arctic region. Some of the
related measures could include forming an alternative to the Arctic
Council organization/forum that would provide non-Arctic nations (mainly
China) with greater presence in the macro-region. It needs to be added
that such ideas are already circulating among Russian Arctic experts but
mainstream thinkers and policymakers are not excited about such
prospect. Practical implementation of such move, however, will be a
matter of last resort and Russia\'s authorities---anti-Western and
dependent on China as they are---will make their best not to
postpone/avoid such a decision being fully aware of accompanying risks
(including, to Russia\'s territorial sovereignty and integrity of the
state).

In the final analysis, I would argue that in [[the move by the US
will]{.mark} likely [engender]{.mark} torrents of
[anti-Western]{.mark}/US [rhetoric]{.mark}, some limited [practical
moves]{.mark} aiming [to]{.mark} demonstrate Russia\'s
[re-militarization]{.mark} efforts and, potentially, Russia\'s decision
to walk away from the UNCLOS]{.underline}.

Strategy and statecraft abound with well-worn adages: \"Keep your
friends close, and your enemies closer\"; \"The enemy you know is better
than the one you don't.\" While these phrases may hold wisdom for some,
they do not guide US policy toward Russia. [The Obama administration's
2015 [**prohibition on bilateral** military cooperation between the US
and Russia]{.mark} **[was a]{.mark} strategic [miscalculation]{.mark}**,
intended to punish Moscow for violating sovereignty and disrupting the
rules-based order.]{.underline} Successive administrations have upheld
this ban, restricting Pentagon funds for \"bilateral
military-to-military cooperation between the Governments of the United
States and the Russian Federation.\" While politicians defend this
stance as necessary to counter Russian aggression in Ukraine, the
reality is that it hinders Western interests. Any proposal to restore
military dialogue is swiftly labeled as appeasement, stifling
discussions that could reduce tensions.

Trump's second term has clearly signaled a different relationship with
Russia but military-to-military dialogue is still illegal. Rather than
select US decision-makers with direct access to Russian representatives,
which can concentrate dis and mal information campaigns by Russia, the
ban preventing conversations with Russian counterparts at every level of
US government needs to be lifted. **[[Where the US leads, allies will
follow]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The Biden administration's 2022 National Security Strategy pledged to
restore American leadership on the global stage while tacitly
criticizing the previous Trump administration's self-interested and
transactional approach to world affairs. However, when it comes to
Russian relations, neither the first Trump nor Biden administrations did
anything to rescind Obama's Kremlin ban. **[[Decreased dialogue between
Washington and Moscow only]{.mark} [degrades diplomacy, exacerbates
tension, and increases the unknowns]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Since the
beginning of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2014, the global situation
has gone from bad to worse. [It has become particularly troubling in the
Arctic where military and commercial activities continue to increase in
scope and scale and where there are no functioning forums---at the
official level---enabling Washington and Moscow to deescalate tensions.
Absent a structured forum for deescalation, the risk for miscalculation
and escalation increases]{.underline}.

**[The [Arctic presents an opportunity for]{.mark} the [Trump]{.mark}
administration [to pursue pragmatic and]{.mark} more [open
engagement]{.mark} between Washington and Moscow]{.underline}**,
specifically in the military and security space. Such a forum currently
exists at the Track 2 level, but absent official participation from
Washington and Moscow decision makers, this forum's efforts to curtail
conflict will struggle.

Currently, [official [US-Russia dialogue on Arctic]{.mark} security [is
non-existent]{.mark}, [increasing]{.mark} the [risk of]{.mark}
[miscalc]{.mark}ulation]{.underline}. For nearly two decades prior to
Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014, [[the eight Arctic
states]{.underline}]{.mark}---Russia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland,
Norway, Sweden, and the US---collaborated under the Ottawa Declaration,
**[[engag]{.mark}ing [in diplomacy through the Arctic
Council]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The Council, however, excludes military
and security from its mandate. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine,
collective Arctic cooperation collapsed, with Moscow blaming Western
sanctions for the diplomatic freeze. As a result, mistrust now dominates
Arctic relations, despite the fact that much of this discord originates
outside the region.

Conflict avoidance demands engagement. While Russia and the West
communicate through the United Nations and on issues like border
disputes, fishing rights, and search-and-rescue protocols,
Arctic-specific security dialogue remains absent. Russia was expelled
from Arctic defense forums like the Arctic Chiefs of Defense (ACHOD) and
the Arctic Security Forces Roundtable (ASFR) in 2014. Today, Russia
participates in the Arctic Council only virtually. **[[Without an
official security dialogue, Arctic states risk]{.mark} misjudgment and
[escalation]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

The reluctance to re-engage with Russia is driven by political risk
aversion rather than strategic logic. Reviving dialogue does not mean
endorsing Russia's actions in Ukraine---it is, rather, a pragmatic
necessity for Arctic stability. The HNT's proposed measures focus on
ensuring that military activities in the Arctic remain predictable and
professional. Key initiatives include prior notification of military
exercises, an Arctic '911' communication platform for emergency
deconfliction, and commitments to refrain from escalatory activities
like GPS jamming or buzzing commercial vessels. Promoting and ensuring a
rules-based Arctic requires changing past policies that have done more
to raise tensions than they do to lower risk.

These confidence-building efforts align with long-standing Arctic
governance traditions. The region has a history of groundbreaking
agreements between Arctic and non-Arctic states, such as the moratorium
on commercial fishing in the central Arctic Ocean. Many of these
agreements originated from informal expert discussions before being
adopted at the state level. The same process could apply to Arctic
security: discussions on military transparency and risk reduction could
eventually translate into formal agreements, fostering stability not
just in the Arctic but beyond.

[Strengthening military dialogue between the US and Russia in the Arctic
serves a broader strategic goal---preventing unintended
conflict]{.underline}. Unlike arms control treaties, which require
mutual trust, CBMs are designed to function in adversarial
relationships. By enabling predictable military behavior, they reduce
the likelihood of dangerous miscalculations.

The war in Ukraine has undoubtedly strained Arctic relations, but the
region's future is not predetermined. The dismantling of
conflict-resolution mechanisms in recent years has left a dangerous
void, but that does not mean rebuilding them is impossible.

[[Renewing dialogue with Russia]{.mark} is not about legitimizing
aggression---it [is about restoring pragmatic engagement to prevent
conflict]{.mark} elsewhere.]{.underline} The West's refusal to engage
with Russia is viewed internationally as punitive rather than strategic.
However, dialogue is occurring in unofficial forums, demonstrating that
productive engagement is possible.

The Trump administration has a chance to correct course and return the
Arctic to the "High North, Low Tension\" label it once enjoyed.
Rescinding the prohibition on military-to-military cooperation with
Russia is a critical first step toward reestablishing security dialogue
in the Arctic.

At a time when geopolitical tensions have stifled official
communication, a structured backchannel approach offers a viable
alternative. [[The Arctic is an]{.mark} [ideal]{.mark} testing [ground
for]{.mark} renewed [engagement]{.mark}, given its history of diplomatic
agreements and its critical role in global stability.]{.underline} A
future framework for Arctic security should incorporate structured,
informal discussions among experts, complementing existing diplomatic
efforts. Such an approach does not replace official negotiations but
provides a foundation for deescalation and risk reduction. The stakes in
the Arctic are too high to ignore---now is the time to act.

[Unilateralism]{.underline}, in the context of global politics, refers
to the practice of individual nations [taking independent actions
without the consent or cooperation of other states or international
organizations]{.underline}. This approach often involves pursuing
national interests and security without adhering to multilateral
agreements or seeking diplomatic consensus. [Some of [the world's major
powers have increasingly]{.mark} employed [unilateral actions]{.mark} in
recent years, [which has]{.mark} significant [consequences for]{.mark}
**[i]{.mark}**nternational **[r]{.mark}**elations.]{.underline}

Examples of unilateral actions by major global powers include military
interventions in sovereign nations, trade sanctions, withdrawal from
international agreements, and the imposition of tariffs. For instance,
the United States' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change
in 2017 and the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (Iran Nuclear Deal)
in 2018 exemplify [unilateral decisions that have global
ramifications]{.underline}.

The Impact of Unilateralism

[[Unilateral actions]{.mark} by powerful countries]{.underline} can have
far-reaching consequences for global stability and cooperation. [These
actions can [**undermine** diplomatic efforts, erode international
norms, and create mistrust]{.mark} among nations.]{.underline} The
following are some key impacts of [unilateralism]{.underline}:

[Undermining Multilateralism]{.underline}: [[Unilateral actions
**challenge**]{.mark} **the principle of
[multilateralism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which is the foundation of the
UN system. Multilateral cooperation is essential for addressing complex
global issues, including conflict resolution, climate change, and public
health crises. [The rise of **[unilateralism weakens international
institutions]{.mark}'** ability to coordinate collective
responses.]{.underline}

Erosion of International Agreements: The disregard for international
agreements and treaties erodes the credibility of global commitments.
When major powers unilaterally withdraw from agreements, it sets a
precedent that encourages others to follow suit, leading to instability
and uncertainty.

Diminished Diplomatic Channels: [[Unilateralism often sidelines
diplomatic]{.mark} efforts in favor of military or economic coercion.
Diplomacy [and]{.mark} dialogue, which are essential tools for conflict
resolution, suffer as a result.]{.underline}

Weakened Norms and Rules: [Unilateral actions can **[weaken established
norms]{.mark}** and rules of international conduct]{.underline}. This
can lead to a more chaotic global environment, where countries are more
likely to act in their narrow self-interest rather than considering the
broader implications.

"America First" and North American Arctic Allies

During the first [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} government, [the [US
sought a more **unilateral** Arctic policy]{.mark} which [**dismissed**
environmental concerns]{.mark} and placed [emphasis on assuring **great
regional security**]{.mark} and [American **economic**
**interests**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [[results were mixed]{.mark} at
best]{.underline}, starting with the [[tragicomic
proposal]{.underline}]{.mark} in 2019 by the Trump government that the
[US should [outright **purchase**]{.mark}]{.underline} the island of
Kalaallit Nunaat -- [[Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark} -- from the Kingdom
of Denmark. This would have [**contravened** the 2009 Greenland Self
Government Act]{.underline}, especially Section 21(1): "Decisions
regarding Greenland's independence shall be taken by the people of
Greenland." [[Greenlandic and Danish leadership **repudiated**]{.mark}
Trump's purchase proposal,]{.underline} prompting the US president to
call off a scheduled trip to Denmark in August 2019. That affair further
illustrated both the transactional and low information aspects of the
first Trump administration. When the President-elect resurrected these
ideas in December 2024, [[**rebukes** from Nuuk and Copenhagen were
**swif**]{.mark}**t**]{.underline}. Nonetheless, Trump's comments
prompted the Danish Government to announce more defence spending on
Greenland to provide the Kingdom with a "stronger presence in the
Arctic," and to update the Danish royal coat of arms by providing
Greenland and the Faroe Islands with their own field, to affirm that
they are a core part of the Danish Realm.

On 7 January 2025, Donald Trump Jr. (the president-elect's eldest son)
landed in Greenland for "a private visit" -- with an entourage including
conservative activist Charlie Kirk and Trump Sr.'s personal director
Sergio Gor. "Don Jr. and my Reps landing in Greenland. The reception has
been great," the incoming president posted on his Truth Social network
shortly before his son landed. "They, and the Free World, need safety,
security, strength, and PEACE! This is a deal that must happen. MAGA.
MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN!" Then, when a reporter asked Trump if he
would rule out using military or economic force to secure this outcome,
the president-elect said he could not.

\<\<IMAGES OMITTED\>\>

Commentators were quick to explain US interests in Greenland, including
its key geostrategic location in North America, the Arctic, and the
North Atlantic, coupled with its resource wealth. Ulrik Pram Gad, a
senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies,
explains that the US seeks to ensure that "no hostile great powers
control Greenland, because it can be a foothold for attacking the US."
The US has core interests in the Pituffik Space Base (formerly the Thule
Air Base), the Greenland-Iceland-United Kingdom (GIUK) Gap that secures
maritime access from the European High North to the North Atlantic (and
vice versa), and Greenland's critical minerals and energy resources.
Pituffik is a major strategic asset for the defence of North America,
playing a role in the United States' Ballistic Missile Early Warning
System since the 1950s, boasting a deep-water port and massive airfield,
and supporting space-based missions. As Sara Olsvig observes, the 2020
negotiations regarding Pituffik positioned Greenland in a new and more
direct relationship with the United States. "Greenlandic politicians
became more stringent in their decision making and manoeuvrings in the
negotiations with the United States," she explains. Broader competition
between China and the US with respect to strategic resources and
infrastructure have amplified interest in Greenland, given China's
interests in rare earth elements, uranium, and Greenlandic airports and
ports. Olsvig noted in a 2024 article that "the relationship between
Denmark and the United States has been free of diplomatic conflict for
decades," but Trump runs the risk of disrupting this with his
exhortations that Denmark should hand over Greenland, a self-governing
entity inside its kingdom, or the US under his leadership "would tariff
Denmark at a very high level."

[Trump's [blunt statements and veiled threats]{.mark}]{.underline},
which [[completely **disrespected**]{.mark} Greenland's [right to
**self-determination**]{.mark}, did not win the hearts and minds of
Greenlanders]{.underline}. Denmark Parliament member Aaja Chemnitz
reiterated on CNN that Greenland "is not for sale" and that "the
[[majority in Greenland find it quite **scary** and quite
**uncomfortable**]{.underline}]{.mark} ... that the US, in a
disrespectful way, is showing that they would like to be buying
Greenland or controlling Greenland. Greenland is not MAGA. Greenland is
not going to be MAGA." Danish national broadcaster DR's Nuuk
correspondent Steffen Kretz also observed that Greenlanders who watched
Donald Trump's 7 January press conference were [[left "**quite
shaken**]{.mark},"]{.underline} with "very few people here who are
dreaming about becoming subjects of a new colonial power led by Donald
Trump." Kretz noted that having "the leader of Denmark's closest ally
refuse to rule out the use of military force against Greenland and
Denmark to claim a part of the Danish kingdom's territory ... [[lays the
groundwork for]{.underline}]{.mark} what could become Denmark\'s
[[**greatest foreign policy crisis** in modern
times]{.underline}]{.mark}."

European leaders responded quickly. "I don\'t think it\'s a good way
forward to fight each other with financial means when we are close
allies and partners," Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen noted,
graciously welcoming Washington's greater interest in the Arctic but
emphasizing that it would "have to be done in a way that is respectful
of the Greenlandic people." She told national broadcaster TV2 she did
not believe Trump\'s pursuit would result in military action and called
for a sober assessment of the situation. Germany emphasized that borders
must not be changed by force, with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz
reiterating that the inviolability of borders is \"fundamental
international law.\" French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told
France Inter radio that "there is obviously no question that the
European Union would let other nations of the world attack its sovereign
borders, whoever they are.\" While he did not believe that the US "would
invade Greenland," Trump's comments confirmed that we have returned to
an era when some world leaders 'might makes right.' Chief EU Commission
Spokesperson Paula Pinho was more evasive, describing the US
president-elect's statements about Greenland as "wild hypothetical
stuff" while reiterating that the sovereignty of states must be
respected "as a matter of principle." While Trump's remarks evoked
concern and rebukes in Europe, they found a welcome reception in Russian
circles. Prominent pundits supported the president-elect's statements
which they saw as validating the Kremlin's expansionist ambitions in its
perceived sphere of influence. For example, Russian TV personality and
Kremlin ally Vladimir Solovyov hosted a debate on his primetime show,
claiming that Trump's position authorized Moscow to demand the
restoration of its former Soviet empire, including the Baltic states.
"What Trump is doing benefits us greatly," Solovyov asserted, by
"totally destroying any illusions that anyone might have still had about
the summit of democracies, about respecting opinions of NATO allies."
Other pro-Kremlin pundits on the panel said that Trump's ambitions
validated Russia's "special military operation" against Ukraine by
justifying the use of force to secure geopolitical ambitions. All of
this is predictable, given Russia's established strategic narratives
using "whataboutism" to brand the US as a hypocritical belligerent,
discredit NATO, legitimize its own revanchist behaviour. There is also
the question of how Trump's threats will be interpreted in China, given
that Beijing has frequently been cited as using 'sharp power' and
geo-economic strategies, namely the use of economic coercion in
diplomatic disputes, such as previously with Australia, Lithuania,
Norway, and South Korea as well as Canada. The threat of tariffs on
Denmark to pressure its government into ceding Greenland to American
control also opens up Washington to charges of double standards. The
Northwest Passage: Will Sleeping Dogs Be Allowed to Lie? During Trump's
first administration, the longstanding and well-managed disagreement
between Ottawa and Washington over the legal status of the Northwest
Passage spilled into public view during the 2019 Arctic Council
Rovaniemi Ministerial meeting when Pompeo lumped Canada in with Russia
and China as examples of countries making "illegitimate claims" in the
Arctic. There is a distinct possibility that the hitherto well-managed
dispute will again complicating cross-border relations under a new Trump
administration. Canada's longstanding position holds that the waters of
Canada's Arctic Archipelago, including the Northwest Passage, are
historic internal waters and that Canada's Arctic sovereignty
encompasses land, sea and ice. "Canada intends to continue to act as a
responsible sovereign of its Arctic territories and waters, relying on
the rules-based international order and supported by historical and
scientific evidence," Canada's Arctic Foreign Policy released in
December 2024 explains. "Canada's commitment to ensuring that maritime
claims are addressed in a manner that is consistent with international
law is one of its key enduring priorities in the Arctic."

While Canada and the US have "agreed to disagree" on the status of these
waters for decades, there is no guarantee that this mutually beneficial
understanding will hold during the second Trump administration. Rob
Huebert and Adam Lajeunesse warned in 2019 that "with discussion of
Arctic freedom of navigation voyages for the US Navy becoming
commonplace, and the [[old diplomatic **safeguards** **breaking down**
in favour]{.mark} a new [**zerosum** **fo**]{.mark}reign
[**po**l]{.mark}icy approach]{.underline}, Canada may soon face a [[new
challenge to its Arctic sovereignty]{.underline}]{.mark}." While this
did not come to pass during Trump's first stint in the White House, the
president-elect's willingness to accept the advice of clear-headed
advisors who seek to preserve the United States' legal position and to
maintain the country's ["premier partnership" with Canada is
uncertain]{.underline}. Although Trump has ruled out using force to make
Canada the 51st state, he noted on 7 January 2025 that he would use
["economic **force**" to coerce Canada]{.underline} into joining the
United States -- an indicator of disrespect for Canada's distinctiveness
and for the enduring bilateral relationship. Public opinion in Canada
for joining the US is very low, and Trump's bullying is more likely to
alienate Canadians than it is to win their support.

Q: Turning back to politics, [we have an **[administration]{.mark}**
that [seems to be **pulling back** from]{.mark} all kinds of
[**multilateral** organizations]{.mark}.]{.underline} How do you think
that\'s going to affect both scientific pursuits and regional
security? \
\
JS: [I think it\'s incredibly concerning. My general take is that we\'re
in a [period of **extreme uncertainty**]{.mark}]{.underline}. There's
been a true cry for help from scientists sounding the alarm that there
is a real---or immediate---impact that\'s happening to research and
science. And so much of the [[research that happens in the Arctic
depends on **cooperation**]{.mark} and collaboration]{.underline}. These
are expensive spaces to work in. And it\'s not a data-rich area, and we
struggle to get the data we have. It [really depends on
**collaboration** and **cooperation** [through **multilateral
agreements**]{.mark}]{.underline} to get the kind of data that we need,
and to bring it together in a way that [provides us with information
that can be useful]{.underline} \[especially regarding climate change\].

Q: How prepared is the US for navigating through the Arctic?\
\
RK: I think the US is very unprepared, both in terms of the technology
but also I think the [rhetoric is not helpful]{.underline}. When Trump
says OK, if we can\'t have Greenland, we're going to take it. If you\'ve
ever been to Greenland, you'll see the irony. I think the battalion
strength in Greenland now is like forty-six battalions from the US and
nineteen from Denmark. So essentially, he would be invading his own
forces on that island.

So I think there\'s an unpreparedness in \[dealing with the seriousness
of this\] rhetoric. And there\'s also a technological unpreparedness.
The US has, I think, only two functioning icebreaker ships. JS: Barely
functioning. RK: They are very old, considering that Russia has over
forty-two quite high-level functioning ones. And then twenty or so more
on top of that. So the imbalance is striking. If you match the
capabilities of Russia to navigate in the Arctic against the US, it\'s
not good. But it\'s also not good for the fact that you need icebreakers
for accessing ports, for rescuing people, for research activities. They
are multifunctional. And what makes this worse is that now, because of
the excitement of the discovery of the new sea there, there\'s a backlog
of countries that want to buy icebreakers. There\'s a lot of orders. But
also icebreakers are made from steel, and steel has just become much
more expensive now President Trump wants to put more tariffs on it. So
why I\'m mentioning all of this is that it\'s not only a disadvantage,
but it\'s an exponential disadvantage. And I would add one more issue,
in this era of fuzziness and unpredictability: some of the other Arctic
states like Russia, and the Arctic-interested China, are able to lower
their standards in manufacturing icebreakers. You have to have a very
fortified ship that can take a certain level of ice \[and we have seen a
decline in quality standards\]. \<\<IMAGE OMITED\>\> Q: So that could
mean lower-quality ships and more accidents? JS: Maritime accidents can
be devastating, and we've seen some recent incidents that should catch
our attention. Just as a tidbit, at the Arctic Frontiers conference, a
Norwegian brigadier, Steinar Dahl, was asked by the moderator: What
keeps you up at night? And his answer was: an environmental accident. He
said from a military tensions perspective, he felt that the deterrence
factors were well in place. What kept him up at night was the risk of an
environmental accident. And if this is a primary concern, you need
cooperation. You need collaboration. You need common investment and
infrastructure and frameworks for decision making. This should be
driving at least some of the policy decision making and the approach
that you use. Q: The accidents are, I assume, collisions with icebergs,
or other ships? JS: Yes. I mean, these are extremely harsh conditions.
We have this vision of an ice-free Arctic that is like the
Mediterranean, where everybody will be out in their bikinis on the deck
of the ship. These are still going to be incredibly harsh, incredibly
difficult conditions. Ice-free does not mean there isn\'t ice, it just
means that there\'s not solid ice. Another question is what does less
sea ice mean for wave action with high winds and in the dark? Even in an
ice-free Arctic, risk and uncertainty are two things that will always be
factors. Shipping is all about knowing you can get from point A to point
B in a certain period of time. That will never be the case in the
Arctic. There are much higher risks associated with the environmental
conditions in the Arctic than there would ever be anywhere else. Q:
Rinna, let's go back to Greenland. Is it realistic to think that the US
could acquire Greenland as a sovereignty purchase? RK: I don\'t think
that it would be reasonable to expect that. It could have been
reasonable if the approach would have been different. If it had not been
a question about annexation, if it would have been a question about
business relations and building of infrastructure, and even extracting
resources, although that\'s very negative---and brings to the
historian\'s mind colonialism.

[If the US administration would have simply]{.underline}---[in a normal,
**diplomatic**, commercial **way**]{.underline} that has [been the
mainstream before---approached]{.underline} Greenland and Denmark [and
suggested joint ventures with US capital]{.underline}, it [would have
been very likely that the Danes and the Greenlanders would have
accepted]{.underline} them and even embraced them. But Greenland and
Denmark have had a [long-term relationship with a [**colonial** and
**hurtful**]{.mark}, negative past.]{.underline}

After 1992, the relationship between Greenland and Denmark was carefully
rethought in terms of legal relationships, in terms of the Maastricht
Treaty, and the Danish membership in the European Union, and many of the
old wounds had been healed. Now the [[US approach]{.underline}]{.mark}
to annexation or acquisition of Greenland has [[opened up some of the
wounds]{.underline}]{.mark}. Nonetheless, Denmark and Greenland are very
unlikely to abandon their shared past.

Q: [Imagining [governance of the Arctic]{.mark} as a vast and harsh
region, it [obviously **cannot** be **unilateral**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
As you've both pointed out, [[it calls for **multiple**
**countries**]{.mark}, sovereign countries, [**working** together
somehow]{.mark}, even with the rising competition in
powers]{.underline}. Now that everything is shaken up globally, what\'s
the best way forward for trying to preserve and encourage cooperation?\
\
JS: [The **Arctic** **Council** has had this ability to be high profile
and big and showy when that made sense]{.underline}. And now what we
need is for it to go below the radar---[[to **depoliticize** as much as
possible]{.underline}]{.mark}---and [[allow for working-level
relationships]{.underline}]{.mark}: scientist to scientist, researcher
to researcher, **[[community to community.]{.mark}\]{.underline}**

#### Reliance on [allies]{.underline} and [partnerships]{.underline} is key---unilateral action alone [fails]{.underline}.

**Kurka '24** \[Amber Kurka, 11-22-2024, \"Anchorage Security and
Defense Conference shapes future of Arctic security cooperation\",
DVIDS,
https://www.dvidshub.net/news/486878/anchorage-security-and-defense-conference-shapes-future-arctic-security-cooperation\]

As [receding sea ice opens new [**trade** **routes** and grants access
to valuable resources]{.mark}, the Arctic has become a [focal point of
**international** **interest**]{.mark}.]{.underline} This surge in
activity has sparked [concerns over jurisdictional
disputes]{.underline}, environmental degradation, and the militarization
of the region.\
\
The Arctic's strategic importance as NATO's western flank was a
recurring theme during the event. One panelist noted, "Everyone in this
room is a member of NATO and supports the NATO mission. That shared
commitment should guide our collaboration." These discussions emphasized
that Alaska, often perceived as geographically isolated, is, in fact, a
vital component of NATO\'s strategic considerations---particularly as
cooperation between Russia and China intensifies. Panelists explored the
shifting geopolitical dynamics, analyzing the implications of growing
collaboration between Russia, China, and aligned states. The Arctic was
highlighted as a central element in their shared ambitions, posing
challenges to the rules-based international order. Experts agreed on the
critical need for security professionals to innovate and adapt,
acknowledging Alaska's pivotal role as an operational hub for Arctic
security. Alaska's geographic proximity to both Russia and the
Asia-Pacific region further underscores its strategic value for NATO.
Serving as a crucial position for defense and security operations,
Alaska is uniquely positioned to address evolving challenges in the
Arctic. Participants stressed the importance of fully embracing this
reality, especially as the deepening partnership between Russia and
China reshapes Arctic affairs. This emerging alliance has heightened the
strategic stakes, demanding close coordination and vigilance among NATO
members to safeguard regional security. The discussion also highlighted
how the impacts of operational environment change on Arctic
infrastructure---such as melting permafrost and erratic weather
patterns---are creating vulnerabilities that could undermine operational
readiness. Highlighting the need to create adaptive strategies to
maintain resilience. Partner Regional Centers and Academic Contributions
The conference highlighted the essential role of partner Regional
Centers and academic institutions in advancing Arctic security through
cross-sector collaboration. Notable contributors included the George C.
Marshall European Center for Security Studies and the Daniel K. Inouye
Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies, whose insights brought a
global dimension to discussions on security challenges. Their
participation in two panels underscored the interconnected nature of
Arctic security, drawing parallels with transatlantic and Indo-Pacific
issues to emphasize the need for cohesive, multinational strategies. The
Homeland Defense Institute (HDI) led one panel that focused on critical
expertise on infrastructure resilience and adaptive security strategies
for the Arctic\'s unique challenges. Its work on risk-based approaches
to protecting vital systems was particularly relevant, as infrastructure
remains a linchpin for operational and societal resilience in the
region. Meanwhile, ADAC-ARCTIC and University of Alaska Anchorage,
showcased their research on enhancing Arctic domain awareness and
addressing the region\'s pressing security needs. Their focus on
technological innovation and interdisciplinary education is equipping
the next generation of security professionals to navigate the Arctic\'s
complexities. Their work bridges theoretical research with practical
solutions, making them key partners in fostering a resilient Arctic.
Arctic Perspectives and Knowledge\
\
Arctic community leaders had a critical role in the conference. They
emphasized the [[importance of including traditional knowledge]{.mark}
alongside scientific research in addressing regional
challenges]{.underline}. Their presentations underscored the need for
Arctic security policies to reflect the realities of Arctic communities
and the importance of protecting the region's unique ecosystems.\
\
One panel emphasized the vital contributions of the Canadian Ranger
program and how meaningful and inclusive partnerships with Arctic
communities are essential for Arctic security. Speakers highlighted the
critical role of Arctic knowledge in areas such as disaster resilience,
operational environment adaptation, and sustainable development. Calls
for Cooperation and Innovation\
\
The conference repeatedly underscored the necessity of international
collaboration in tackling Arctic challenges. Delegates stressed that
[[Arctic **security** is a **shared responsibility**, requiring
coordination among Arctic and non-Arctic nations]{.mark}
alike]{.underline}. Existing [frameworks, such as the [**Arctic**
**Council**, were presented as **models** for balancing national
interests with regional stability.]{.mark}\
\]{.underline}
Technological innovation also featured prominently in the discussions.
Advances in satellite surveillance, autonomous vehicles, and artificial
intelligence are transforming Arctic operations, offering new tools for
monitoring and securing the region. However, panelists cautioned against
over-reliance on technology without careful consideration of its
potential environmental and long-term implications.\
\
Fireside Chat and Forward Momentum\
\
As the conference drew to a close, a fireside chat brought together
three influential leaders shaping a whole-of-government approach to
Arctic security in Alaska: Randy "Church" Kee, Director of the Ted
Stevens Center; Dr. Michael Sfraga, Ambassador-at-Large for Arctic
Affairs; and Julie Kitka, Federal Co-Chair of the Denali Commission.\
\
Moderated by Matthew Hickey, Associate Director for Strategic Engagement
at the Ted Stevens Center, the discussion embodied the conference's
collaborative and forward-thinking spirit under the theme of \"What\'s
Next?\"\
\
The panel focused on actionable strategies to sustain and build on the
momentum generated by the conference. Reflecting on the event\'s
discussions and their broader implications, ["It's [clear **allies** and
**partners** must consider the Arctic a dynamic, **integrated**
**security** landscape]{.mark}, stretching from the Bering Sea to the
Barents Sea, to the Baltic Sea, [with **inherent** **connections** to
the Indo-Pa]{.mark}cific, North Pacific, North Atlantic, and
Euro-Atlantic regions,"]{.underline} US Ambassador-at-Large for Arctic
Affairs Mike Sfraga said. Underscoring [the [**unique** **relationship**
among like-minded Arctic nations]{.mark}, Ambassador Sfraga noted, "It's
[critical we strengthen this **trans-Arctic
alliance**]{.mark}]{.underline} which in turn strengthens the
Transatlantic Alliance."\
\
Kee reinforced this perspective, emphasizing the importance of
maintaining the progress achieved: "As we move forward, I encourage each
of you to carry the momentum of this conference into your respective
fields. Let the insights and connections forged here inspire new
initiatives, stronger partnerships, and continued engagement with the
challenges and opportunities of the Arctic. Together, we have the
expertise and determination to make a meaningful impact."

#### Multilateral [military disclosure]{.underline} succeeds at bulding [trust]{.underline}.

**Paul '24** \[Michael Paul, Ph.D, Senior Fellow @ German Institute for
International and Political Affairs, 5-18-2024, \" Back to the Future of
the Arctic\", *Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik*, German Institute for
International and Political Affairs,
https://www.swp-berlin.org/publications/products/comments/2024C18_FutureArctic.pdf\]

What kind of measures can restore trust?

[[Trust]{.underline}]{.mark} always involves a degree of uncertainty and
the possibility of disappointment. Nevertheless, it also [[opens up more
**possibilities**]{.mark} for action]{.underline} because, as the
sociologist Niklas Luhmann puts it, ["trust provides a more effective
form of reducing complexity]{.underline}". Those who [act with
confidence are optimistic about the future]{.underline}, which always
contains a multitude of certain and uncertain events. If calculated
rationally, risks cannot be eliminated, but they can be reduced.
According to Luhmann, such points of reference can thus serve as a
[["**stepping stone** for]{.mark} jumping into a [**limited** and
**structured** **uncertainty**]{.mark}".]{.underline}

According to its National Security Strategy, the German government
"supports strategic risk reduction and the fostering of predictability,
as well as the maintenance of reliable political and military channels
of communication in relations between NATO and Russia. \[It\]
remain\[s\] open to reciprocal transparency measures where the
prerequisites for them exist". This includes the development of new
approaches based on behavioural arms control that can help reduce
tensions.

In 2023, [[Russia's Arctic ambassador]{.mark} Nicolay
**[Korchunov]{.mark}** once again [expressed the desire for
**comprehensive** **cooperation** that included military
**issues**]{.mark}]{.underline}, stating that "\[i\]t can all be sorted
out by dialogue, which would strengthen trust". Despite this sentiment,
it will be difficult to start a dialogue in view of the consequences of
the war in SWP Comment 18 May 2024 5 Ukraine. Russia's current policy
gives little hope for constructive talks, as deliberately playing with
unpredictability is one of Russia's manipulation tactics to destabilise
Western societies and institutions. This, however, should not prevent
preparations and considerations with respect to how security and
stability can be enhanced in the future.

Confidence-building measures (CBMs) should define acceptable and
legitimate behaviour. They should help to promote transparency and
reduce the risk of misjudgements, and hence, unwanted escalation. In
this way, a certain degree of crisis stability and trust in the
intentions of the other side can be fostered. This could mitigate the
current security dilemma.

[[**CBMs** could, for example, focus on **creating transparency** with
regard to **military activities**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and they could
incorporate recommendations from the former NATO Russia expert dialogue.
For instance, [[Arctic military bases could be subject to **mutual
visits**]{.mark}.]{.underline} A regular regiment on visitation could be
established and [[plans for **military exercises** could be
**disclosed**. Advance notice of Russian exercises]{.mark} could help to
[avoid misinterpretation]{.mark}]{.underline}. In turn, [[NATO]{.mark}
allies could [inform Russia about unscheduled
activities.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Confidence- and security-building measures (CSBMs) are rooted in the
Vienna Document on CSBMs. In the 1990s, the Organization for Security
and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) created the world's most advanced set
of rules for arms control, verification, and CBMs. Now many of the
agreements under this arrangement have either been suspended or weakened
as partners withdraw. According to OSCE Secretary General Helga Maria
Schmid, however, this does not mean that CSBMs will not play an
important role again in the future, as the instruments are still
available.

[New dialogue requires [**constructive** substance]{.mark} in the form
of suitable projects that [foster **cooperation**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
In the long term, it is important to [develop a new set of
([**multilateral**) **rules**]{.mark} that [serve both sides'
interests]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to a team of authors from the
Peace Research Institute Frankfurt, two basic conditions must be met to
[[facilitate an effective multilateral agreement]{.underline}]{.mark}:
The rules must be designed so that they are [[appropriate for solving
the problems]{.underline}]{.mark} and these rules must be adhered to by
the involved states. Accordingly, the crucial question is to what extent
these rules will restrict state action, including military action.

### NB\-\--Russia

#### [Rejuvenation]{.underline} of the [council]{.underline} is key towards [re-engagement]{.underline} of Russia.

**Andreeva and Rottem '25** \[Serafima Andreeva, Svein Vigeland Rottem ,
1-30-2025, \"How and Why the Arctic Council Survived Russia's Invasion
of Ukraine\",
https://jordanrussiacenter.org/blog/how-and-why-the-arctic-council-survived-russias-invasion-of-ukraine\]

In May 2022, Norway confirmed that it would proceed with preparations
for its upcoming chairship period despite the ongoing pause. The
following June, the ["[Arctic **seven**]{.mark}]{.underline}"---the
western AC member states---[[issued a]{.mark} statement [signaling
partial **resumption** of AC work **without** **Russian**]{.mark}
involvement]{.underline}. This action attracted media attention, adding
traction to debates about the Council's prospects, which seemed bleak at
the time. The Arctic Circle Assembly in October 2022 was, however, a
turning point. Among those closely involved with the Arctic Council, the
approach had been to avoid public discussions about its survival to
prevent further speculation as to the body's future. But after the
Arctic Circle Assembly, leaders deemed it necessary to assert the
Council's relevance and demonstrate the commitment of all Arctic states
to its continued survival. 

In November 2022, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov invited the
Arctic states to a ministerial meeting to take place in May 2023. Norway
accepted the invitation, signaling its desire for a smooth chairship
transition and the continued existence of the Arctic Council. The
[[transition of chairship]{.mark} from **Russia** and Norway [was
completed]{.mark}]{.underline} on 11 May 2023, despite challenges and
the lack of in-person participation. 

During the transition, Norway outlined its priorities, focusing on
oceans, climate and environment, sustainable development, and the
well-being of northern communities.
Although [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} expressed conditioned
skepticism to the upcoming Norwegian chairship period, particularly due
to the potential influence of NATO in the Arctic Council---since,
indeed, all AC member states except Russia were now NATO members---[it
did [**not** push for alt]{.mark}ernative **multilateral**
[platforms]{.mark}. ]{.underline}

After the transition, the body approved new guidelines for resuming
scientific work within the Council's Working Groups. The collective
efforts of the Arctic states, under Norwegian chairship, have been
crucial in preserving the Council's role during this challenging period.
Despite these gains, however, [the [future of the]{.mark} Arctic
[Council remains **uncertain**]{.mark}.]{.underline} 

Why did the Arctic Council survive?

We define "survival" as the Arctic Council's ability to continue
functioning, albeit to a limited extent, with all participating member
states. All member states have been kept engaged in ongoing activities
to varying degrees, and all member states, including Russia, have
expressed a desire to maintain cooperation. This fact, however, does not
guarantee the Council's future stability, much less immunity to external
or internal challenges. 

Legal framework

The legal framework of the Arctic Council is rooted in the 1996 Ottawa
Declaration and the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy (AEPS),
which emphasize consensus-based decision-making among member states.
This framework deliberately avoids military security issues. The Council
lacks the authority to impose sanctions, allowing its working groups to
make clearer recommendations without the constraints of consensus-driven
decision-making. These working groups, some of which predate the Council
itself, have been instrumental in shaping international environmental
policies.

[Hence, the Arctic Council is [more of a
decision-**shaping**]{.mark}]{.underline}[ [body]{.underline}]{.mark} than
a decision-making one, [[providing a **platform** for non-state
actors]{.mark} like **indigenous** communities [to engage]{.mark} in
international **governance**]{.underline}. Norway's chairship transition
in 2023 was made possible through a combination of established
procedural documents and the strategic plan for 2021--2030. This
strategic reliance on existing frameworks enabled Norway to navigate
diplomatic challenges, ensuring the Council's survival during a period
of geopolitical instability. Yet procedural feasibility alone does not
fully explain the Council's survival.

Strategic framework

Over recent decades, global interest in the Arctic has surged, driven by
the region's strategic importance and the growing need for international
cooperation. The AC [has played a [central role in
**facilitating**]{.mark} this interest]{.underline}, even during times
of high geopolitical tensions. All [AC member states agree that the
Arctic Council is the main [forum for]{.mark} multilateral
[coop]{.mark}eration]{.underline} in the Arctic in the relevant
strategic documents. 

Moreover, [the **A**rctic **C**ouncil was [created on]{.mark} the
**[assumption]{.mark}** that it would be [possible to
**coop**]{.mark}erate [with **Russia**]{.mark} after the dissolution of
the Soviet Union.]{.underline} Indeed, the Council's founding agreement,
the AEPS, was enabled through the Murmansk initiatives articulated by
Mikhail Gorbachev in 1987.

Foreign policy engagement

[The **A**rctic **C**ouncil has been a central arena for international
**coop**eration]{.underline} in the region for several reasons. First,
[[by promoting **multilat**]{.mark}eral **[coop]{.mark}**eration through
the Council, Arctic [states can counter expansionist ambitions]{.mark}
from non-Arctic states and [prevent conflict-driven
**narratives**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Council also [[serves as a
**barrier** against]{.mark} the establishment of [competing
**regimes**]{.mark}, reinforcing the legitimacy of]{.underline}
frameworks like [the Law of the Sea]{.underline} Convention. 

Furthermore, [the Arctic Council's structure, which includes indigenous
peoples' organizations as permanent participants, adds legitimacy and
ensures diverse perspectives in decision-making]{.underline}. The Arctic
Council\'s role in knowledge generation and its established networks
have heightened global awareness of Arctic climate challenges, making
its survival crucial for continued environmental collaboration. 

Finally, the Council\'s origins in the post-Cold War era and its [role
in maintaining regional **stability** underscore its
importance.]{.underline} The [[**transition** of chairmanship]{.mark}
from Russia to Norway]{.underline}, coupled with the resumption of
project-level work, [[illustrates the]{.mark} [**collective**
determination]{.mark} of the Arctic states to ensure the Council\'s
continued **[existence]{.mark}**, with an [**open-door** **policy**
for]{.mark} Russia's potential future
**[re-engagement]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

#### Resumption of [council]{.underline} cooperation is [key]{.underline} towards a bridge to [re-integration]{.underline} of Russia. 

**Zellen '23** \[Barry Scott Zellen, senior research scholar at the
Naval Postgraduate School, 6-01-2023, \"As War in Ukraine Upends a

Ironically, [[even as Russia embarks on]{.mark} the path of
[expansionist war to its south]{.mark}, it [remains
**committed**]{.mark}, for the most part, [**to**
**coop**]{.mark}eration [**to** its **north**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Consider the words, and life experience, of [Russia's
**[S]{.mark}**enior **[A]{.mark}**rctic **[O]{.mark}**fficial Nikolay
[Korchunov]{.mark}]{.underline}, who presently holds the rotating chair
of the Arctic Council (Russia's second tenure at chair since the AC was
formed).The Arctic Council website describes Korchunov as a "[a career
diplomat]{.underline} who has served as the Ambassador at Large for the
Arctic Cooperation at the Ministry of Foreign Aff airs (MFA) of Russia
and the Senior Arctic Offi cial of the Russian Federation to the Arctic
Council since December 2018,"35 with prior service at Russia's Ministry
of Foreign Aff airs (MFA) headquarters, and in overseas postings to
"embassies of the Russian Federation to Sweden and Finland," and as
"Head of Russia's delegation to the Council's Task Force on Arctic
Marine Cooperation and the Task Force on Improved Connectivity in the
Arctic from 2015 until 2018." In these past positions we see a depth of
knowledge, experience, and commitment to the Arctic, and to its
cooperative legacy, and as he assumed the Chair of the AC, he was
"especially interested in matters related to sustainable development, in
fi nding the right balance between environmental protection and
socio-economic development,"36 positioning him in the very sweet-spot at
the intersection of Arctic globalization and the preservation of the
sublime, undisturbed Arctic free from the manifold impacts of
modernization. In an interview on the Arctic Council website, he
[[observed]{.underline},]{.mark} "I have visited many places in the
Arctic and gotten acquainted with many people and issues. I can see now
that most issues, questions and challenges in the Arctic are
interconnected. So there is an [[obvious need for]{.mark} an
[integrated,]{.mark} cross-sectoral, and inclusive [approach to
development]{.mark} in the **Arctic**]{.underline}."37 A year ahead of
assuming the rotating chairmanship of the AC in 2021, he noted,

We are in the early stages of the preparations for the forthcoming
Arctic Council Chairmanship. Th ere will be a number of priorities on
the agenda of our Chairmanship, among them of course environmental
protection and sustainable development, as well as new technologies for
safeguarding the Arctic environment. Th e human dimension, the Arctic
inhabitants including Indigenous peoples, will of course be stressed and
underlined throughout our forthcoming Chairmanship.38

[Korchunov [noted]{.mark}]{.underline} the Russian term for the Arctic
Council is "торганизация, которая должна обеспечить умное управление
Арктикой. И это то, чем мы занимаемся," which translates into English
as: "[The Arctic [Council is the organization, which is supposed
to]{.mark} provide the **conditions** for and contribute to [responsible
**governance**]{.mark} in the Arctic]{.underline}. Th at is what we are
doing here."39 Indeed, this continues the Council\'s mission to
\'provide the conditions for and contribute to responsible governance in
the Arctic\' that started in 1996 (predating it with the formation of
the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy fi ve years earlier) and
was carried forward by each of the Arctic states during their periods of
service as AC chair---a tradition Russia had pledged to uphold.

Th at Russia could nurture a collaborative Arctic even as it engaged in
regional confl icts as far afi eld as Syria, Libya, Crimea, and Eastern
Ukraine (with only that one brief interruption when in 2014 the US and
Canadian AC representatives boycotted the Moscow meeting) was the
accepted view by and large for nearly the entirety of the AC from its
1996 formation to its twenty-fi fth anniversary in 2021, when Russia
assumed the rotating chair for its second time. While it is universally
acknowledged that Russia's full invasion of Ukraine is a game changer,
and a systemic risk to global security, and while threats to Finland and
Sweden on Russia's far northwestern frontier and to Japan on its far
northeastern frontier indicate a notable shift in diplomatic tone, one
cannot readily forget the "If you're not with us, you are against us"
philosophy undergirding US President George W. Bush's "Bush Doctrine"
that shaped and guided the "Long War" or "Global War on Terror" that the
United States waged after the 9/11 attacks.40

While the United States did not threaten the existence of those who did
not join it, it did position opponents to the American war as "against
us," which of itself was coercive diplomatically---and the regional wars
that embroiled the US armed forces for a generation did not impede the
enduring cooperation among the Arctic states, regardless of where they
stood on America's wars. While Russia has threatened supporters of
Ukraine's defence more forcefully, including Finland and Sweden for
their considering joining NATO it must still be noted that [Arctic
**[coop]{.mark}**eration has [**endured** many **disagreements**]{.mark}
among the Arctic states on various matters of policy, whether related to
foreign wars or not]{.underline} (as [[seen in the Trump
Admin]{.mark}istration's [break]{.mark} with fellow AC members [on
climate change]{.mark}]{.underline}, which under Barack Obama was
conceptualized as an all-of-government war against
nature-out-of-balance).

[The A7 decision to **boycott** the AC entirely]{.underline}, as part of
the global isolation of Russia, does risk the opportunity presented by
Korchunov under his watch as AC chair, and [creates [a **gap** in
multilateral **coop**]{.mark}**eration** that could [endure for many
years]{.mark}.]{.underline} Can the Arctic aff ord such a gap? Was the
exclusion of the Permanent Participants from the discussion and decision
to impose an AC boycott breaching the spirit of state--Indigenous
collaboration for which the AC rightfully takes much pride for its
inclusivity, likewise a gap within the gap, putting the Indigenous
organizations in the uncomfortable position that President Bush put
American allies and friends in during the run-up to war after 9/11? Has
[the A7 response to Russia's aggression in Ukraine [created its own risk
to Arctic unity]{.mark} that continued operation of the **AC** during
wartime]{.underline}, with various alternative ways of expressing
profound disagreement with Russia, might have avoided?

According to Newsweek, "Russia's Arctic envoy has told Newsweek that
international tensions over the war in Ukraine should not spill into the
northern region that also borders the United States. But recent
diplomatic and military moves by Washington and its allies show the
usually serene frontier has already become a frontline in the crisis."41
Nikolay Korchunov, who serves as Russia's ambassador-at-large to the
Arctic Council, told Newsweek that Moscow found this decision
'regrettable,' arguing that it ran contrary to the apolitical nature of
the intergovernmental forum founded more than 25 years ago. 'Th e
Council's mandate explicitly excludes matters related to military
security,' Korchunov said. 'It is enshrined in all its founding and
strategic documents that the Arctic should remain as the territory of
peace, stability and constructive cooperation. Th erefore, this unique
format should not be subject to the spillover eff ect of any
extra-regional events.'42 Newsweek noted with "cooperation at a
standstill due to the deadly war raging in Ukraine, the future of
multilateral eff orts remains deeply uncertain," and that Korchunov said
his country 'reiterates its commitment to close and constructive
engagement with all Arctic Council memberstates, permanent participants,
observers and other interested nonregional partners. We are open for
long-term partnerships in the region with any nation ... be it the
Arctic Council member state or any other country, in the interest of its
sustainable development and well-being of its inhabitants, including
Indigenous Peoples.'43

Even in this time of war, [[Korchunov reiterated]{.mark} that "'[Russia
is convinced]{.mark} that '[the **spirit of
cooperation**]{.mark}]{.underline}[']{.mark} inherent in the Arctic
Council will help to strengthen trust and mutual understanding ... and
[the Council should remain a solid framework for peaceful mutually
**beneficial** **collaboration**]{.underline} despite geopolitical
tensions elsewhere in the interest of a sustainable and prosperous
future of the entire Arctic region.'"44

But for the A7, Russia's invasion of Ukraine shattered this hitherto
enduring "spirit of cooperation," precipitating the abandonment by
Nordic states Finland and Sweden of their long traditions of neutrality
and decisions to join the NATO alliance, as military concerns displaced
prior cooperative instincts. Faith in Arctic cooperation, as the war in
Ukraine approaches the end of its fi rst year with peace nowhere in
sight, is at an all-time low. [And without the continued, full
participation of all Arctic **Council** stakeholders, inclusive of
Russia, the [world has **lost** an important **forum**]{.mark} where the
"trust and mutual understanding" Korchunov described can be
**rekindled**]{.underline}. With this distinctive forum for multi-level
multilateralism, where the inherent asymmetry of actors and diversity of
their perspectives was welcome for so long, it's hard to imagine a way
back from this impasse, and to overcome the new distrust felt across the
Circumpolar Arctic. But if the risks, dangers, and enmity of the Cold
War era could so quickly give way to a new cooperative spirit as
witnessed in 1996 with the Arctic Council's formation, it can happen
again. But for this to happen, [[dialogue **must resume**]{.mark}
between all Arctic stakeholders]{.underline}---and [this **restoration**
cannot happen too **soon**]{.underline}. Th e stakes are just too high,
for the Arctic, and for the world at large.

There is thus much opportunity from participating in, and in so doing
thwart Russia's ambitions, with the power of consensus that undergirds
the Arctic Council. Even while Europe is afl ame, the Arctic continues
to melt. Th e challenge of climate change does not go away, nor do the
many pressing challenges across the remote and isolated communities of
the Arctic region. And, with tensions high in Europe, Moscow may choose
to ship more of its petroleum products through the Northern Sea Route to
Asian markets rather than to European ports---and if it does, its
economy will come to increasingly rely on the stable border with the
United States it worked so hard to create and to sustain since the fi
nal days of the Soviet Union. When Russia sold Alaska to the United
States in 1867, it did so for a good reason: it was the best neighbour
to have, in good times and bad. This remained true during the Second
World War when that border provided a lendlease lifeline to the Eastern
Front, and it remained true during the Cold War even when tensions were
high. And despite the uncertainty and chaos unleashed with Russia's
invasion of Ukraine, it remains true even today.

There is every reason to isolate Russia as the war in Ukraine continues,
to maintain sanctions, and to remind Putin that he has become a pariah
that threatens global stability. [But no matter how things unfold in
Europe, Russia still remains **half** of **the** Circum**polar** World.
[Governing the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} effectively, and peacefully,
[[still **requires** Russia's **participation**]{.mark} and
consent]{.underline}. Th e Arctic climate will continue its inexorable
thaw; its still pristine ecosystems remain as fragile and sublime now as
they did before Russia invaded Ukraine. Arctic Indigenous Peoples
continue to off er the world their wisdom and Traditional Knowledge, and
require our continued, good-faith eff orts to overcome past economic
marginalization and political exclusion.

[[By keeping]{.mark} today's [pause on Arctic **Council** participation
as **brief** as possible]{.mark} and **resuming** meetings among its
stakeholders]{.underline} virtually and in symbolic protest, while
trying to restore consensus with Russia on the many important issues
that still unite the whole of the Circumpolar World[, the Arctic
[**Council** can become part of the **answer** **to**]{.mark}, and
resolution of, [the current **conflict**]{.mark}.]{.underline} It can
off er the very same bridge to a collaborative future that it has
promised since 1996 and show that its second quarter century can be as
successful as its fi rst. Th e Arctic Council survived the collapse of
consensus once before on an issue of great import---the climate change
challenge that requires our collective unity to overcome. [The
**Council** can---and [must]{.mark}---survive the current collapse in
consensus that has accompanied the conflict over Ukraine and [**keep**
this important **bridge** to]{.mark} a more peaceful and **[united
future]{.mark}** open for the time [when Moscow is ready to **reset its
policies** and **rejoin** the **consensus**]{.mark} it once
embraced.]{.underline}

#### The [counterplan]{.underline} works with [Russia]{.underline} in the [council]{.underline} to resolve the [power vacuum]{.underline} created by inactivity which is [filled]{.underline} by non-[arctic states.]{.underline}

to Norway: Warns of Political Vacuum in the Arctic Region\", High North

https://www.highnorthnews.com/en/russias-ambassador-norway-warns-political-vacuum-arctic-region\]

[The Arctic **[Council]{.mark}** is the foremost international **forum**
for cooperation in the Arctic]{.underline} but [its level of
[**activity** is still **reduced** in]{.mark} the [wake of]{.mark}
Russia\'s warfare in [Ukraine]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Since February, the council\'s working groups have been able to resume
official meetings in digital format, while [meetings at the
**[diplo]{.mark}matic** and political levels have remained
[**paused**.]{.mark} ]{.underline}

The absence of [pan-Arctic political dialogue creates an [unfortunate
**void**]{.mark} that others flock to]{.underline}, Korchunov recently
stated to the Russian state-owned news agency RIA Novosti. He elaborates
on the statement to High North News:

"I will refrain from listing specific countries or other entities that
show increased interest in the Arctic. My key message is that [the lack
of political **dialogue**, the loss of trust, as well as the
**alienation** among the leading actors of the cooperation]{.underline}
in the [region inevitably leads to an [increase in
**uncertainty**]{.mark} and [creates a **vacuum**]{.mark} that others
will seek to fill]{.underline}," the ambassador writes in an email.

"It is clear that [some non-[regional actors seek to **assert**]{.mark}
themselves at the expense of the Arctic states]{.underline}. Their rise
in the Arctic affairs may have a limiting impact on the capabilities of
the Arctic states to effectively manage the region. [[Many cannot
resist]{.mark} the [temptation to use]{.mark} the [current uncertain
situation]{.mark} in their **favor**]{.underline}," Korchunov considers.

"[Surely, non-regional actors [pursue different
**goals**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- for some it is access to natural
fossil and biological resources as well as transport corridors that is
paramount. Others, on the contrary, push for introducing restrictions on
economic activities in the Arctic."

"Some organizations and groups of non-regional states do not only
arrange discussions of the Arctic issues, but also adopt strategic
documents on the matter," he points out. The ambassador likely refers to
the EU\'s annual Arctic Forum and Indigenous People\'s Dialogue, as well
as the new EU-funded format for Arctic Youth Dialogue. Other likely
reference points are the UK\'s and Germany\'s updated Arctic policies
launched in 2023 and 2024, respectively. Ambiguous

[Russia believes that states and **organizations**, primarily from
Europe and Asia, are [seeking to fill the **void**]{.mark} in the
Arctic.]{.underline} Still, more recently, Moscow has also noted an
increased interest in the region from Arabic states. 

This was stated by Korchunov this fall when asked by Elizabeth Buchanan,
Senior Researcher at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, who
refers to his comments in an op-ed in the National Interest. 

However, [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} itself has opened up to
cooperation in the Arctic with non-Western countries, not least China,
[while also [keeping the door **ajar** for]{.mark} \"efficient [work in
the A]{.mark}rctic [C]{.mark}ouncil.\" ]{.underline}

\"Our line in the Arctic Council will depend on the situation\'s further
development and respect for Russian interests. With the council\'s
weakened role and effectiveness, provoked by our Western partners, we
are already [[engaged in active dialogue with]{.mark} an Arctic
agenda]{.underline} in various formats [with [other countries]{.mark}
and organizations]{.underline},\" said Korchunov in May 2023 after the
handover of the AC chairship to Norway.

From a Russian perspective, the difference is likely that [Russia\'s
[engagement with non-regional **actors**]{.mark} is about \"mutually
beneficial cooperation,\"]{.underline} while [the aforementioned
\"vacuum\" is sought to be filled at the cost of both Russia and the
other Arctic states]{.underline} -- including their sovereign rights and
jurisdiction in the Arctic.

Recently, we have noticed some improvements in the Arctic Council.

Nikolay Korchunov, Russia\'s new Amabassador to Norway and former Arctic
Ambassador.

\'Securitization, but some progress\'

Regarding the western Arctic states\' approach to the region, Korchunov
now states the following:

"We [note with concern securitization of the Arctic policies of other
Arctic **Council** member-states]{.underline}. The [[key task]{.mark} is
[to preserve the Arctic as the territory of peace]{.mark}]{.underline},
stability, and mutually beneficial cooperation. Pending issues on the
Arctic agenda do not lie in the military dimension."

Yet, his assessment of the council\'s situation also holds a small
positive note.

"Recently, we have noticed some improvements in the stagnant state of
the Arctic Council. I am referring to the gradual resumption of the
activities of the working groups of the council in the autumn of this
year," the ambassador points out and continues:

"However, I would rather not exaggerate the results -- [the
[self-restraining decision]{.mark}, previously **adopted** by a number
of the council's member-states, unfortunately, [continues to
**weaken**]{.mark} the spirit and [atmosphere of
**coop**]{.mark}eration]{.underline}, and negatively affects the current
state of affairs in the organization. The Arctic Council, in a sense,
has turned into a virtual forum."

Overall, we assess positively Norway\'s work as the Arctic Council
chair. Nikolay Korchunov, Russia\'s new Amabassador to Norway and former
Arctic Ambassador. Have noticed Norwegian efforts At the same time,
Norway\'s chairship is receiving positive feedback from the Russian
side. "Overall, we assess positively Norway\'s work as the Arctic
Council chair," writes Korchunov and continues: "In the current
challenging period, we note the efforts of the Norwegian chairship to
resume the regular full-scale activities of the council, though the
negative impact of decisions previously taken by some of the member
states is evident." "In addition, not all of them share the Norwegian
approach to get the Arctic Council back to full-format work. Time will
tell whether Norway and other member-states are ready to cooperate
constructively." No high expectations for Danish chairship In the spring
of 2025, the Kingdom of Denmark will take over the chairship of the
council, an event that Russia takes a reserved approach toward. "We have
no high expectations about the upcoming Arctic Council chairship of
Denmark. As far as I am aware, Copenhagen hasn't held by far any
consultations with Russia regarding its plans for 2025-2027, nor have
they informed us about their priorities," notes Korchunov. "That said, I
believe that the success of the upcoming chairship of Denmark will
largely depend on what role the actual Arctic territories -- the Faroe
Islands and Greenland -- will have," he adds. The position of Ambassador
at Large for Arctic Cooperation no longer exists. Nikolay Korchunov,
Russia\'s new Amabassador to Norway and former Arctic Ambassador. Under
"Department of European problems" The new ambassador to Norway can also
inform that the responsibility for Arctic issues in the Russian Ministry
of Foreign Affairs is now held by Vladislav Maslennikov, Director of the
Department of European Problems.

Until this fall, the department was known as the Department of
Pan-European Cooperation. The MFA\'s spokeswoman Maria Zakharova told
the Russian state-owned news agency TASS that the name change was due to
the [\"[obvious degradation of **multilateral** coop]{.mark}eration

In 2007, Russia dramatically changed its national Arctic strategy and
began committing significant military and fiscal resources to
successfully pursue, promote, and protect its national objectives in the
region. [[Having determined that the Arctic region will be critical for
its economic survival]{.mark}]{.underline} over the next few decades,
[[Russia is aggressively pursuing strategic economic objectives in three
important sectors]{.mark}: energy resources and [minerals,
transportation, and food]{.mark} security]{.underline}. Russia's energy
industry is the largest and most important single driver of the
country's aggressive Arctic strategy because Russia's economic security
is inextricably linked to its energy industry and its failure to
diversify its economy have forced Russia to double down on the
extraction of oil and natural gas resources. Since 2007, Russia has
expertly wielded its diplomatic, information, and legal tools of
national power. [[Russia has]{.mark} also [aggressively increased its
Arctic military presence]{.mark}, both quantitatively and qualitatively,
[in accordance with the country's coordinated Arctic strategy to pursue,
promote, and protect its growing strategic economic interests in the
region]{.mark}]{.underline}. The possibility of conflict between great
powers remains ever present regardless of the potential for cooperation
or competition. [[The probability of a **miscalculation escalating into
unintentional armed conflict** is greater due to increased Russian
economic and military activity in the Arctic
region]{.underline}]{.mark}. Russian economic interests have highlighted
the Arctic region's dramatically increased strategic importance. [[U.S.
policymakers risk]{.mark} damaging U.S.- Russian relations, failing to
achieve U.S. national strategic objectives, and also [making the world
more unstable, unpredictable, and dangerous]{.mark} by failing to
explore and contemplate Russia's national strategic
interests]{.underline}. To lessen concerns about the unknown and thereby
make the world safer, U.S. policymakers and our allies must attempt to
understand the objectives towards which Russia is driving its Arctic
strategy.

### AT Russia Thumps

#### Russia wants [collaboration]{.underline} through the Arctic Council---proven by statements and [symbolic]{.underline} funding cuts.

More Efficient Arctic Cooperation\", High North News,
https://www.highnorthnews.com/en/seeking-consensus-more-efficient-arctic-cooperation\]

On Wednesday, [[**Russia** **announced** it would **suspend** its
economic **contribution** to the Arctic Council]{.mark}. ]{.underline}

\"This decision [will [apply **until** the council **resumes** its
full-fledged work]{.mark}]{.underline} and corresponding interaction
[between all its members]{.underline}, including project activities,\"
said Nikolay Korchunov, Russia\'s Arctic Ambassador, to TASS.

More specifically, Moscow is halting its co-funding of the Arctic
Council Secretariat, informs Morten Høglund to High North News. He is
Norway\'s Arctic Ambassador and Chair of the Senior Arctic Officials in
the Arctic Council under the Norwegian chairship.

\"This will not affect the council\'s work in the short term. However,
[a delay in payments in the long-term can mean [**fewer resources** for
the Arctic Council]{.mark}]{.underline} Secretariat in Tromsø and less
opportunity to support the work,\" Høglund writes in an e-mail.

Proposal on \'hearing\'

Can you say something about the current dialogue with Russia and the
other member states around fully resuming the Arctic Council\'s work?

\"A natural part of holding the chairship is having contact with all the
member countries, including Russia, and we are aware of the Russian
position,\" answers Høglund and continues:

\"[Lately]{.underline}, we have [worked to reach an agreement among the
member countries on more **efficient** **working** methods]{.underline},
and we have recently sent out a proposal to all the member states on new
guidelines allowing for better working conditions for the council\'s
working and expert groups.\"

To what degree have the working and expert groups resumed their
activities with written procedures since this was made possible in the
late summer? Have they managed to pick up existing projects, including
collaboration with observers, as well as suggest new ones?

\"A lot of good work is taking place in the Arctic Council, and many
projects are underway. Decisions are being made in the working groups
with all Arctic states in consultation with the indigenous peoples\'
organizations. The observers are participating in projects they are
involved in, as before. The aforementioned proposal will entail even
stronger observer participation,\" he maintains.

The [Arctic Council is still functioning.]{.underline}

Maria Zakharova, [[Russian **MFA**]{.underline}]{.mark} Spokeswoman.

Additional Russian initiatives

The aforementioned Russian announcement [[follows several recent
statements]{.underline}]{.mark} from official Russian quarters regarding
the Arctic Council.

\"We must keep all options open for foreign policy maneuvring, including
withdrawal from the Arctic Council,\" said Ambassador Korchunov earlier
in February.

He and Russian ministers articulated the same message several times in
2023. This month, other voices have also made statements:

Russia continues its participation in the Arctic Council but will make
\"special decisions\" if it were to stop considering the council as
\"effective and fair,\" emphasized Dmitry Peskov, Press Secretary for
President Vladimir Putin, according to TASS.

Whether or not the membership is appropriate will be reconsidered \"if
the council develops into an institution that is unfriendly toward
Russia,\" added Maria Zakharova, Russian MFA Spokeswoman. This was also
reported by TASS.

At the same time, she states that alternative forums are not currently
being considered.

\"[It is [**not** **necessary** to talk about any possible
**replacements**]{.mark} for this organization, at least not at this
stage]{.underline}. This is because [[the Arctic
Council]{.underline}]{.mark} -- although it works at the slowest speed
possible -- [[**still functions** and is a multilateral instrument to
support **cooperation**]{.underline}]{.mark} in areas that were
determined at the ministerial meeting in Reykjavik in May 2021, as well
as at the last meeting in Salekhard in May last year,\" said
[Zakharova]{.underline}.

[\"**[Wants real cooperation]{.mark}**\"]{.underline}

[Russia\'s [decision to suspend payments to the Arctic Council is not as
dramatic]{.mark} as it may sound]{.underline}, writes Jennifer
Spence, PhD, Arctic Initiative Senior Fellow, Harvard Kennedy School\'s
Belfer Center, in an op-ed on Thursday. She has both studied the council
and worked for it.

Spence rightfully assumes that the situation concerns the Russian
contribution to the secretariat\'s budget, which, according to her,
amounts to around eight percent -- and does not exactly amount to \"a
death knell\" for the forum.

\"Next, I would argue that [Russia\'s announcement [**demonstrates**
that they want real **cooperation** through the Arctic Council, not just
the **symbolic** **fig leaf**]{.mark} that the Council is at risk of
becoming]{.underline}. With other multilateral institutions, they have
cut ties completely. Here, we see a measured approach -- [[a \"pause\"
on]{.mark} funding that is more [a **symbolic gesture**]{.mark} than a
heavy blow]{.underline},\" she maintains. 

**The Arctic Council is alive, but on the brink of collapse**

**Bryant \'25** (Miranda -- Nordic correspondent @ the Guardian,
\"Norway hands over Arctic Council intact after 'difficult' term as
chair\", 5-12-2025,
https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/12/norway-arctic-council-leadership-ukraine-trump-greenland//phs-maubu)

[Norway is to hand over the leadership]{.underline} of an
intergovernmental body comprising countries with territory in the Arctic
after what its foreign minister called a "difficult two years", during
which there have been [unprecedented tensions within the group's
membership related to Russia's war in Ukraine and Donald Trump's threat
to seize Greenland]{.underline}.

The Arctic Council requires consensus from all eight Arctic states --
the US, Russia, Canada, Finland, Iceland, Norway, the kingdom of
Denmark, which includes Greenland, and Sweden -- for all decisions and
statements.

[[Despite]{.underline}]{.mark} seismic divisions among its membership
being played out under the global spotlight -- [particularly in relation
to [Russia]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}, since [Trump's]{.mark} re-election,
the US -- **[the council remains active and
intact]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The Norwegian foreign minister, Espen Barth Eide, will hand over the
rotating two-year chair to Greenland's foreign minister, Vivian
Motzfeldt, at a meeting of the council on Monday.

Denmark is due to take the presidency but in a signal that Copenhagen is
attempting to reset its relations with Greenland -- a former Danish
colony that remains part of the Danish realm -- after Trump's advances,
Greenland is taking the chair.

"[[It's been]{.mark} a [difficult]{.mark} two years to be frank [because
the global]{.mark} backdrop, the [international backdrop]{.mark}, has
[made it impossible to have]{.mark} full [business as
usual]{.mark}]{.underline}," Eide told the Guardian. "[But [we were very
eager to keep the council together]{.mark}, to maintain its membership
and to have activity, and we are pleased to report that [we achieved
that]{.mark}]{.underline}."

He admitted that their goals -- including on the oceans, the climate
crisis and people in the north -- were "limited" but said the council,
formed in 1996, had managed to maintain working relations despite
considerable strain since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.

"[We were able to keep it together]{.underline}," he said. "And in
contrast to some other formats, nobody has left and nobody has suggested
that we should not continue our work, and slowly, slowly, [[we were able
to develop some]{.mark} practical [cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}."

**Russia's funding cuts doesn't mean the AC is dead\-\--it signals
cooperation**

**Spence \'24** (Jennifer -- PhD, Arctic Initiative Senior Fellow,
Belfer Center, Harvard Kennedy School, \"Russia Suspends Funding for the
Arctic Council: Wake up Call Not Death Knell\", 2-15-2024, High North
News,
https://www.highnorthnews.com/en/russia-suspends-funding-arctic-council-wake-call-not-death-knell/phs-maubu)

First, [[suspending funding to the]{.mark} Arctic [Council is not as
dramatic as it sounds]{.mark}]{.underline}. The activities of the Arctic
Council are primarily supported by in-kind and financial contributions
from those directly involved in specific projects.

For example, the Aleut International Association, Finland, and the
United States might decide to contribute to a project related to waste
management; Iceland, Canada, and Saami Council to a project on gender
equality; and Gwich'in Council International, Norway and the United
States to a wildland fire project. In each case, the expertise and
funding for the project comes from the institutions involved.

Most likely, Russia was in fact indicating that it is suspending its
annual funding to the Arctic Council Secretariat (ACS).

There is no core Arctic Council funding for the many assessments,
toolkits, analyses, events, and other products that have been delivered
by the Council over the last 25+ years. This lack of core funding to
support the Council's priorities has been a source of frustration and
the topic of much debate over the years, but in this instance, it means
that the Council's ability to function is not dependant on the financial
contributions of any one Arctic state.

Most likely, [[Russia was]{.mark} in fact [indicating]{.mark} that it is
[suspending]{.mark} its annual [funding to the]{.mark} Arctic Council
Secretariat ([ACS]{.mark}]{.underline}). [[The small]{.mark} (but
mighty) [team]{.mark} [based in]{.mark} Tromso,
[Norway]{.mark}]{.underline} that provides administrative and
communication support to the Arctic Council. While the ACS will
certainly have to make some adjustment because of this reduction in
funding, it is important to note that more than 40% of its budget comes
from its host country (Norway) and the remainder is split between the
seven other Arctic states.

This means that [[Russia's decision]{.mark} to suspend
funding]{.underline} results in a decrease of a little more than 8% of
the ACS' annual budget. **[[Not exactly the death knell for the]{.mark}
Arctic [Council]{.mark}]{.underline}** that you may have initially
imagined.

Next, I would argue that [[Russia's announcement demonstrates that they
want real cooperation through the Arctic Council]{.mark} and not just
the symbolic fig leaf that the Council is at risk of
becoming]{.underline}. With other multilateral institutions, they have
cut ties completely. Here, we see a measured approach -- a [["pause" on
funding that is more a symbolic gesture than a heavy
blow]{.underline}]{.mark}.

They even emphasized that Russia's departure from the Council, while
possible, is not under serious consideration at this time. They are
signalling that the current working arrangements in the Arctic Council
aren't enough. And can anyone really argue with that?

We are at a crossroads in Arctic governance. [[The Arctic Council is
alive, but hobbling]{.underline}]{.mark}. Based on multiple accounts,
efforts to re-invigorate working-level cooperation have had mixed
results, but it is far from where we need to be to effectively respond
to the critical issues facing the region and the globe -- mitigating and
adapting to climate change, supporting resilient and thriving Arctic
peoples and communities, pressing infrastructure needs, growing demand
for the region's resources, increasing risk of human-induced and natural
disasters, and so many more.

Russia's announcement makes it clear that the status quo is not an
option. [[This is a wake up call]{.mark}. [The]{.mark} Arctic [Council
can still play a central role in]{.mark} circumpolar
[cooperation]{.mark}, [but there is more work]{.mark} to do [to get
there.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### AT Trump Thumps

#### The council can [resolve]{.underline} disputes through mediation despite [Trump]{.underline}.

**Konyshev and Serungin '25** \[Alexander Sergunin and Valery Konyshev,

https://www.orfonline.org/expert-speak/the-arctic-great-game-the-need-for-cautious-optimism\]

[The [**Arctic** five]{.mark}]{.underline} are Russia, the United States
(US), Canada, Denmark, and Norway, [all of which [compete]{.mark} with
each other]{.underline} and with non-Arctic countries for natural
resources and control over the maritime transport routes of the Far
North. Having a coast along the Arctic Ocean, in accordance with the
1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), these five nations
have preferential rights to develop the resources of the marine Arctic
within their territorial waters and exclusive economic zones (EEZs). At
the same time, it should be noted that [the **[US]{.mark}**, unlike
other coastal **states**, has an [Arctic strategy characterised
by]{.mark} a [reliance on unilateral actions]{.mark}, ignoring (or
[belittling]{.mark}) those [international **institutions**]{.mark} that
are completely beyond their control, [including the Arctic
**Council**]{.mark}]{.underline}, the Arctic Economic Council, the
Northern Forum, as well as UN specialised agencies dealing with the
Arctic. As recent moves by the [[**Trump**
admin]{.mark}istration]{.underline} [[demonstrate]{.underline}]{.mark},
\[e\] [the US does not hesitate to put [pressure on]{.mark} its
[**closest** allies]{.mark} (for example, Canada or Denmark) to
**achieve** its goals in the region.]{.underline}

A second group of actors in the region comprise the sub-Arctic states
that, having no direct access to the Arctic Circle, nevertheless are
either located in close proximity (Iceland) or possess territory located
in the Arctic (Sweden and Finland).\[f\] Also actively involved in
Arctic affairs are certain international organisations of Western
countries (the North Atlantic Treaty Organization or NATO and the
European Union, EU), as well as organisations of Nordic countries.\[1g\]
Comprising the fourth set of stakeholders are the various institutions
and programmes of the United Nations (UN): the Commission on the Limits
of the Continental Shelf, UN Development Program, UN Environment
Program, International Maritime Organization, and UNESCO. These agencies
are mandated to act in the interest of the global community, as well as
to serve as arbitrator in disputes between Arctic players. In addition
to these four, another fifth and relatively new circle of cooperation
and competition in the Arctic has emerged in recent years---the
non-Arctic states (primarily East Asian countries, as well as a number
of European states), which in the last two decades have also begun to
show interest in the development of the region. This inevitably leads to
the growth of economic and political tensions in the region, since the
Arctic legal regime is not the ideal one and allows some ambiguity
regarding the rights of both regional and non-regional actors. For
example, under UNCLOS, non-Arctic states do not have the rights to
explore and develop natural resources in the EEZs and continental
shelves within the national jurisdiction of the 'Arctic Five'.
Therefore, they are objectively interested in reviewing the already
established legal norms and spheres of influence, and they favour the
"internationalisation" of the region, especially of its maritime
transport routes and the Central Arctic Ocean, an area located outside
the national jurisdiction of coastal states. The Points of Contention
The following paragraphs outline the past, existing, and potential
conflicts in the Arctic region. Maritime delimitation Disputes are
ongoing over the delimitation of maritime space between the US and
Canada in the Beaufort Sea and between Canada and Greenland (Denmark) in
the Lincoln Sea. The Canadian-Danish dispute over the delimitation of
the Lincoln Sea in the part that concerned the small Hans island was
resolved in 2022: an agreement to divide the island nearly in half along
a natural fault line was signed by the Danish, Greenlandic, Canadian,
and Nunavut governments. Extension of the continental shelf In 2001,
Russia became the first country to apply to the UN Commission on the
Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) with a claim on expansion of its
shelf in the Arctic Ocean.\[h\] Moscow claimed sovereign rights over
resources on the seabed area of some 1.2 million km2 outside the
200-mile line. However, the CLCS found Russia's claim to be
insufficient. Russia organised comprehensive research expeditions and in
2015, submitted a revised application. The Commission has almost fully
approved Moscow's application, with the exception of one small area.
Since Russian claims overlap with similar ones to parts of the Arctic
shelf of Denmark and Canada, which filed their applications in 2014 and
2019, respectively, Moscow will have to negotiate with them after the
Commission decides on their applications. Other coastal states (except
the US which has not ratified the UNCLOS) followed Russia (see Map 3).
Norway was the second after Russia to submit its application to the CLCS
in 2006 and the first among the Arctic states to get a positive decision
from the Commission in 2009. At the end of 2023, the US unilaterally
announced the expansion of its continental shelf in the Arctic Ocean and
the Bering Sea. This action did not affect Russian interests in the
region but was consequential to Canadian claims to a part of the shelf
in the Beaufort Sea. International legal status of the Northern Sea
Route and Northwestern Passage While Moscow and Ottawa believe that they
have historical and legal rights to control and regulate navigation
through the Northern Sea Route and Northwestern Passage, other countries
(including the US and China) insist on the freedom of navigation
principle. For example, Moscow defines the NSR as a historically
existing national unified transport route of the Russian Federation in
the Arctic and therefore considers it to be under its exclusive
jurisdiction. Canada considers that it is sovereign over the waters of
the NWP on the ground that those waters are internal. Both Russia and
Canada invoke the UNCLOS Article 234, which provides coastal states with
the right to adopt and enforce non-discriminatory laws and regulations
for the prevention, reduction and control of marine pollution from
vessels in ice-covered areas within the EEZ limits, where particularly
severe climatic conditions and the presence of ice covering such areas
for most of the year create obstructions or exceptional hazards to
navigation, and pollution of the marine environment could cause massive
harm to or irreversible disturbance of the ecological balance. In order
to insist on the international status of the NSR and the NWP, the US
initiated the Freedom of Navigation Operation Program (FONOP) back in
1979. So far, Washington has been hesitant to send commercial and
military vessels to these maritime areas, as it cannot provide
icebreaking escorts and fears a harsh reaction from Russia and Canada.
However, the US has not ruled out the possibility of implementing FONOP
in the Arctic Ocean when it has the appropriate resources.\[11\] Both
Moscow and Ottawa regard these plans as a serious destabilising factor
that could negatively affect the security of the entire region.\[12\] Is
a Military Conflict Inevitable?

One school of thought believes that the [Arctic Five [will fight hard
for their **sovereign** rights]{.mark} in the region and push for a
further delimitation of the continental shelf and maritime spaces, with
Russia and Canada seeking to establish **exclusive** control over the
**NSR** and **NWP**. This scenario [could lead to]{.mark} the [region's
**remilitarisation**. With]{.mark}]{.underline} the outbreak of the war
in [[Ukraine]{.mark} in 2022, [relations]{.mark} between the Western
Arctic **countries** and Russia have
[deteriorated]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The Arctic institutional
system has also degraded. \[i\] the pessimists maintain that even a
military conflict cannot be ruled out in the foreseeable future
involving both the regional and non-regional actors.

However, regional players do not yet have a sufficiently serious
motivation to initiate an armed conflict in the Arctic and are unlikely
to have one in the foreseeable future.\[1j\] All the actors believe that
the [[challenges]{.mark} in the region can be [resolved through
**negotiations** and diplomacy rather than by military
force]{.mark}]{.underline}. The current regional military buildup is,
from the point of view of Arctic actors, more a means of deterring each
other than a preparation for a real military conflict.

In Lieu of a Conclusion

This essay argues that the Arctic players will work to resolve existing
and potential disputes not by force but through negotiations and
international arbitration. Indeed, [the countries of the region have
more common **interests**]{.underline} than conflicting ones, and
therefore the [tendency to cooperate will eventually prevail despite
current tensions.]{.underline}

While Western countries may be currently pursuing a confrontational
policy in the Arctic, there [are still [areas]{.mark} that are [open to
**coop**]{.mark}eration with all **stakeholders**]{.underline}, among
them: climate action, environmental protection, biodiversity
conservation, monitoring ice and permafrost dynamics, search and rescue
operations, prevention and dealing with the consequences of natural and
man-made disasters, the well-being of indigenous peoples, and
sustainable development.

Despite the serious crisis of the regional institutional infrastructure,
it would be premature to talk about its collapse. The UN
structures---specifically the IMO, UNEP, UNDP, and UNESCO--- remain
operational in the Arctic. The Northern Forum and the Arctic Economic
Council also continue their activities, albeit not as actively as in the
earlier years. There are signs of a revival of the Arctic Council's
activities at the working group level.

It is safe to assume that after the end of the Ukrainian conflict, which
will reasonably happen sooner or later, it is likely that international
[[Arctic coo]{.mark}peration and regional **institutional**
infrastructure [will be fully restored]{.mark}]{.underline} and the
'great Arctic game' will end, to the mutual benefit of all players.

#### Trump has incentives to cooperate so he can expand into the Arctic.

According to climate researchers, the speed of today's global warming is
unprecedented compared to the natural global temperature increases that
occurred in the earth's history. Global warming is progressing at an
above-average rate, especially at the North and South Poles. In the
past, the Arctic was covered by thick perennial sea ice. According to
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, it is very likely that
the extent of the Arctic Sea ice will continue to decrease all year
round. In fact, the average thickness of sea ice in the Arctic has
decreased from more than three metres to less than two over the past 30
years, and old ice, i.e. multi-year ice (MYI) covered by snow from past
winters, is disappearing. A study published in 2024 concludes that since
2007, the Arctic has transitioned significantly from a perennial,
multi-year ice regime (thus, old ice) to a seasonal first-year ice
regime (in other words, young ice).1 US climate researcher Mark Serreze,
Director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC), has described
this development as the 'Arctic death spiral'.2 As a result, it becomes
more and more likely that in the future we will have an ice-free Arctic
and an Arctic Ocean that is covered by less than one million square
kilometres of sea ice. It seems possible that the Arctic could see its
first ice-free summer day even before 20303 -- and not in the mid-2030s
or at the end of the century, as projections have suggested so far.4
Climate change, however, not only has devastating consequences for the
biosphere. In the future, it will also allow for increasing -- though
not necessarily easier -- access to the northern polar region, Arctic
sea routes and resources.5 [This will add to the region's geopolitical
significance as it links the Atlantic with the Pacific.]{.underline} [In
May 2019, during Donald **[Trump's]{.mark}** [first term]{.mark} in
office (2017-- 2021), Secretary of State Mike Pompeo **[elevated the
Arctic]{.mark}** **[to]{.mark} [a]{.mark}** **geopolitically
[significant]{.mark} '[arena']{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the [struggle for
power]{.mark} [and influence]{.mark}, and [announced]{.mark} the dawning
of 'a **[new age of strategic engagement]{.mark}** [in the]{.mark}
[Arctic']{.mark}.]{.underline}6 This eloquent yet premature exaltation
of the Arctic was followed by strategy papers from branches of the armed
forces containing many generalities, albeit few concrete measures and no
priorities.7 [In a June 2020 memorandum, President [Trump]{.mark}
[called]{.mark} [for a '**strong Arctic**]{.mark} security
**[presence']{.mark}**. This included a 'fleet of polar security
icebreakers' that was to be 'fully deployable by Fiscal Year
2029']{.underline}.8 In fact, work on the first Polar Security Cutter
(PSC-1), USCGC Polar Sentinel, began at a Mississippi shipyard in August
2023.9 However, this first new heavy icebreaker is not expected to be
handed over to the Coast Guard before 2030 as the shipyard has
underestimated the time required for complex design modifications. If
construction continues at its current pace, completion of the second and
third PSC could take until 2040.10 With the delivery of the fleet
delayed, it can be assumed that Trump will have to rely on the
Icebreaker Collaboration Effort (ICE) Pact promoted by his predecessor
in order to establish a minimum presence of icebreakers as soon as
possible. The ICE Pact [signed]{.mark} on the sidelines of the NATO
Summit in July 2024 is [a **[trilateral arrangement]{.underline}**
**[between]{.underline}**]{.mark} the **[[U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates, [Canada]{.mark} [and Finland]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[aimed at accelerating icebreaker]{.mark} ship[building]{.mark}.
[Canada]{.mark}'s largest shipbuilder Davie, which owns Helsinki
Shipyard in Finland, [intends to invest in]{.mark} longterm [projects in
the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates. A US government
representative said that they expect allies to build between 70 and 90
icebreakers over the next decade.11 With the support of its allies and
partners, the United States seeks to ensure a continuous presence in the
Arctic.12 With a global market share of 0.13 percent, the US
shipbuilding industry has already been left far behind by Asia, and the
lack of icebreakers is just one part of the crisis the [US]{.mark}
shipyards are in.13 It remains to be seen whether and to what extent
ideas from the first Trump administration will be reconsidered, and
whether a first icebreaker will be built in Finland, for example. This
time, however, tangible measures will be required to remedy this
embarrassing state of affairs. The [conclusion]{.mark} reached by the
United States [that]{.mark} an [increased presence in the Arctic is
necessary]{.mark} results from the fact that both the situation and the
perception of threats have changed. In March 2020, General Terrence
O'Shaughnessy, Commander of the North American Aerospace Defense Command
(NORAD), stated in Congress: 'The Arctic is no longer a fortress wall,
and our oceans are no longer protective moats'.14 According to the U.S.
Air Force's Arctic Strategy, the Arctic is part of both North America
(U.S. Northern Command, USNORTHCOM) and the Indo-Pacific (U.S.
Indo-Pacific Command, USINDOPACOM), two highly important areas.15 In
fact, all branches of the American armed forces and three of the most
important combatant commands -- including USNORTHCOM, USEUCOM (U.S.
European Command) and USINDOPACOM -- consider the Arctic, in whole or in
part, as a portion of their military area of responsibility. Experts
from the German Marshall Fund criticise that this 'complicate\[s\] the
implementation of an integrated strategic mission'16 as the Arctic is
becoming increasingly important for all major powers bordering the
Atlantic Ocean and the (Indo-)Pacific as regards their efforts to
project military power.

It may not sound like something [[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} would want
a stake in, but there is a chance that the Arctic Council does not have
his attention whatsoever due to its limited activity -- and because
there are plenty of other things that keep him occupied. If that is the
case, it may actually prove to be an [[advantage]{.mark} for the Arctic
[Council]{.mark}, which under normal circumstances would otherwise

revitalization post Ukraine**

a Course for Working-Level Cooperation\", 2-14-2024,

Introduction

On February 14, 2024, [the [Russian]{.mark} Federation announced that it
would [suspend its annual payments to the Arctic Council]{.mark} "until
the resumption of real work in this format with the participation of all
member countries]{.underline}."1 [This suspension comes after over two
years without in-person Arctic Council meetings.]{.underline} It
highlights the importance of carefully examining how the Arctic Council
got here, and what opportunities there are for cooperation in the
future.

**[The [Arctic Council has]{.mark} long [been the central hub for
coop]{.mark}eration [on Arctic issues]{.mark}.]{.underline}** That
changed in 2022, when Russia's invasion of
[[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} profoundly shifted Arctic governance
dynamics. A week after the invasion, the seven other Arctic Council
member states---Canada, the Kingdom of Denmark, Finland, Iceland,
Norway, Sweden, and the United States---announced that they were
**[[pausing]{.mark} participation in Council
[meetings]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [This [disrupted]{.mark} the
[decades-long peaceful cooperation]{.mark} that had persisted between
Arctic states, Indigenous Peoples' organizations (Permanent
Participants), as well as a broad range of experts and knowledge holders
both in and outside the region.]{.underline}

[[There have been no in-person]{.mark} Arctic Council [meetings
since]{.mark} then]{.underline}, but some activities have resumed at the
working level. In August 2023, under Norway's leadership, all eight
Arctic states reached consensus to establish new guidelines to allow
decisions to be made through written procedures. This enabled some work
to proceed without requiring Arctic Council member states and Permanent
Participants to convene in-person as a group. While far from ideal, this
decision-making process was seen as a way to reinvigorate cooperation in
recognition of the many Arctic issues that remain pressing.

**[Arctic states have been clear that [the Arctic Council is]{.mark}
still [the]{.mark}ir chosen [mechanism for]{.mark} regional
[cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} despite the challenges
posed by the war in Ukraine. [But [charting a path forward for the
Arctic Council]{.mark} is not about returning to "business as usual."
Rather, it [is about]{.mark} finding ways to advance [cooperation based
on emerging needs and broader geopolitical
dynamics]{.mark}]{.underline}. This report endeavors to inform responses
to this crisis moment with key takeaways and practical recommendations
for future cooperation.

Present and Future of Arctic Council Cooperation: Key Takeaways

More than two years have passed since Russia's invasion of Ukraine
prompted a pause in in-person Arctic Council meetings. Since then, some
work has resumed, particularly at the working level. Workshop
participants took stock of the Arctic Council's progress since the 2022
invasion, and four key trends emerged:

The Arctic Council Chair's role has been elevated. The eight Arctic
states take turns serving as Arctic Council Chair, and Chairships rotate
every two years. In 2023, Norway took over from Russia as Chair and
began working to restore constructive cooperation after a tense year
with Moscow at the helm. Norway---and future Chairs---have a more
complicated role now that in-person meetings have stalled. It is harder
to reach the full consensus that is required to make decisions at the
Arctic Council because the Chair cannot engage with one collective group
of eight states and six Permanent Participants to facilitate decisions.
Instead, they must engage bilaterally with each Arctic Council member
state, Permanent Participant, and Working Group. The forward motion of
the Arctic Council depends on the Chair serving as an effective leader
and interlocutor in this environment.

Indigenous Peoples' participation is crucial and at risk. [Indigenous
Peoples have played an integral role in the Arctic Council since the
Council's formation in 1996. Indigenous Peoples' input, convening power,
people-to-people contacts, and cross-border connections are even more
crucial now that not all representatives of Arctic states can be in the
same room.]{.underline} However, the Permanent Participants are facing
new hurdles to their participation. The operating guidelines introduced
in August 2023 that allow decisions to be taken in writing instead of in
person creates a heavy burden on the human capacity and financial
resources of Permanent Participants. These organizations have very few
permanent staff that must now review large quantities of written
material to determine what information is relevant, what decisions are
being proposed, and how and where they would like to engage. All this
must be done in relatively short periods of time and with little or no
opportunity for discussion about the issues under consideration.

[[The]{.mark} Arctic [Council is]{.mark} still [capable of
realignment]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unlike many other international fora,
the Arctic Council is not treaty-bound. This absence of formal legal
obligations can be an asset during this period of uncertainty because it
can enable innovation and flexibility. The Council has adapted before.
In 2019, when the prospect of a Ministerial Declaration became
impossible, the Finnish Chair mobilized in real time to release a
"Statement by the Chair" that acknowledged the Arctic Council's
accomplishments from 2017-2019 and identified key priorities for the
incoming Icelandic Chairship.2 Similarly, the "pause" of activities
following Russia's invasion of Ukraine was a form of realignment driven
by necessity. [[During this period of flux]{.mark}, [the]{.mark} Arctic
[Council has an opportunity]{.mark} for self-examination, discerning
what initiatives [to]{.mark} prioritize and what processes to
[improve]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The Council suffers from a perceived lack of transparency and
communication. The current Chair of the Senior Arctic Officials, Morten
Høglund, has stressed that "**[[the Arctic Council is not
dead]{.underline}]{.mark}**," but how can outside observers really
know?3 The Arctic Council has previously been characterized as a "black
box," and the current absence of public information is feeding this
reputation and leaving space for others to fill the void. [The Arctic
Council's presence on the international stage is also weakened. [Visible
participation of Arctic Council]{.mark} representatives [in]{.mark}
international [discussions]{.mark} and events **[is crucial to
maintain]{.mark} the Council's [relevance.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

#### US abides by most of UNCLOS as customary i-law

https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Wild-Blue-Yonder/Article-Display/Article/2685294/us-china-international-law-disputes-in-the-south-china-sea/

China's incremental expansion and bold territorial claims in the South
China Sea (SCS) over the past 20 years have raised global concerns. Each
year, 3.4 trillion dollars of trade goods are shipped through the SCS,
and over 80 percent of crude oil destined for Japan, Taiwan, and South
Korea transit this area.1 [[The **US has enforced**]{.mark}
international law under provisions of the United Nations Convention on
the Law of the Sea (**[UNCLOS]{.mark}**) through routine operations in
the SCS]{.underline} by US Navy/Coast Guard ships and US Navy/Air Force
aircraft Freedom of Navigation (FON) operations. These FON operations
have been conducted in disputed waters and airspace, in which the
Chinese lay claim to maritime territories represented by its nine-dash
line[. Since UNCLOS was not ratified by the Senate in 1994, the US
enforces international law based on customary international law [with
respect to China's violation]{.mark} of UNCLOS and repeated harassment
of foreign vessels]{.underline}. Given the US-China tension in the SCS,
some have argued that the US should ratify the 1994 agreement to UNCLOS
to build legitimacy with partners in the region and apply pressure to
China to abide by international law. Others have argued [that [the US
need not ratify]{.mark} UNCLOS [since]{.mark} its military [FON actions
are consistent with UNCLOS]{.mark} and customary international
law]{.underline}. This article will examine the history of US support of
UNCLOS, China's nine-dash line claim, and the intersecting issues
related to international law and territorial disputes in the SCS.

US UNCLOS History

During the first conference for UNCLOS in 1958, [[four law of sea
conventions]{.mark}, which remain in effect today, [were ratified by the
US]{.mark} Senate and used [to develop]{.mark} what eventually became
the 1982 [UNCLOS]{.mark}]{.underline}.2 As a lead negotiator with
UNCLOS, the US did not ratify this multinational agreement in 1982 due
to a controversial seabed floor provision. UNCLOS was later modified in
1994 to address the concerns raised with this provision. Today, 168
countries officially recognize UNCLOS, which defines a coastal nation's
exclusive economic zone (EEZ) as 200 nautical miles from the coast and
territorial waters as twelve nautical miles from the coast.3
[[Since]{.mark} the 1994 UNCLOS [modification to seabed claims,
the]{.mark} US [executive branch has supported UNCLOS, and]{.mark},
currently, [the UN maintains a "provisional application" for the
US]{.mark}]{.underline}.4 In addition to executive branch support of
UNCLOS, every US Chief of Naval Operations since the development of
UNCLOS in 1982 has supported ratification.5 Additionally, every Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff has written a letter to the Senate
stressing the need for the US to become a party to UNCLOS.6 Since the
1994 update to UNCLOS to address concerns with the original 1982
agreement, every Senate has failed to bring UNCLOS to a vote.7 UNCLOS
has repeatedly been blocked by Senate opposition due to concern of
reduced US sovereignty and the argument that [[**UNCLOS is not needed**
since much of it has]{.mark} already [been **established as
customary**]{.mark} **[i]{.mark}nternational
[law]{.mark}**]{.underline}.8

Figure 2: Contested Areas in the South China Sea38

China's Nine-Dash Line

As a party to UNCLOS, China has sought to invoke its sovereign rights to
maritime territory beyond China's EEZ and claim an area that encompasses
nearly the entire SCS.9 China presents its SCS claim as a map that
depicts nine-dashes that stretch across the SCS, hence the term
nine-dash line. The nine-dash line is a vague representation of what
China argues is their historic maritime claim. First presented in 1947
(as the eleven-dash line by the Chinese Nationalist Party, also known as
Kuomintang), the nine-dash line depiction of China's SCS maritime claim
provides little detail and lacks defined coordinates for the seemingly
arbitrary dashes on the map.10 With no "coherent legal basis," China did
not formally announce its nine-dash line claim to the UN until 2009.11
China's nine-dash line claim to waters beyond its internationally
recognized EEZ encompasses various disputed territories within the
Spratly Islands, Paracel Islands, and Scarborough Shoal. From 2014-16,
China made further claim to the nine-dash line maritime territory by
constructing various artificial features through dredging in the Spratly
and Paracel Islands.12 Under UNCLOS provisions, these artificial
features do not "strengthen China's territorial claims as a legal
matter" for its justification of the nine-dash line.13

nine-dash line, the US has increased its FON operations throughout the
SCS to enforce international law]{.underline} by operating within
China's nine-dash line.14 The US has been persistent with enforcing
UNCLOS provisions in respect to FON in international waters and airspace
within the nine-dash line. [Although the US never ratified UNCLOS, its
increased FON missions are recognized as abiding by customary
international law]{.underline}. China claims that the US FON operations
are violating international law due to the use of military ships and
aircraft. Within the nine-dash line area, China consistently violates
UNCLOS through routine harassment of civilian vessels within their
respective EEZ. In June 2011, China severed cables to oil exploration
vessels from Vietnam as they operated within its EEZ.15 In addition,
China collided with a Vietnamese fishing vessel in the vicinity of the
Parcel Islands in April of 2020.16 In 2016, a UN tribunal concluded
China violated UNCLOS for operating within the Philippines' EEZ,
interfering with fishing and petroleum activity, constructing artificial
features, and conducting law enforcement activity that led to
near-collisions at sea.17

Given China's opposition to foreign military operations within its EEZ
and nine-dash line, the number of US military incidents and near miss
collisions at sea and air has led the US to spearhead agreements between
China and the US to prevent a catastrophic event from occurring. The
first international airspace incident occurred in 2001 with the
collision of an aggressive Chinese fighter with a Navy EP-3E Aires II,
and the first international incident at sea involved the harassment of
the USNS Impeccable in 2009.18 Both were conducting intelligence,
surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) FON missions. In 2013, a Chinese
navy ship placed itself in the path of a US cruiser forcing the US ship
to change course in order to avoid a collision.19 This event led the US
to seek a non-binding Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES) with
Pacific navies (to include China), in an effort to standardize the
actions of ships in the event of unplanned encounters.20 CUES has been
criticized, however, because it does not address ship behavior nor does
it apply to China's coast guard, other law enforcement ships, and
maritime militia.21

US-China International Law Considerations

UNCLOS allows coastal nations to protect resources within their EEZ and
provides freedom of the high seas, to include navigation and overflight
for foreign vessels and aircraft.22 China argues they have the right to
prevent foreign military vessels and aircraft to enter its EEZ; however,
this is not what international law dictates. The basis for US FON
operations is to assert the right to freedom of navigation and
overflight in China's internationally recognized EEZ and self-recognized
territorial and EEZ claims. The principles of FON have been in existence
for 400 years, and the US has continuously used its military to enforce
FON throughout its more than 200-year existence.23 US FON operations
work to "preserve for all States the legal balance of interests
established in customary international law as reflected in the Law of
the Sea Convention."24

China attempts to legally justify the nine-dash line claims through
domestic legislation passed in 1992 and 1998. China's 1992 Law on
Territorial Sea and Contiguous Zone claim various disputed islands
throughout the SCS as sovereign to China.25 The 1998 Law of the People's
Republic of China on EEZ and Continental Shelf states China's EEZ
applies to all Chinese territorial rights to include the historical
rights to the areas defined by the nine-dash line.26 China's legal basis
to argue its rights to the nine-dash line territory is based on Chinese
domestic law, not international law.27

With no such provision in UNCLOS, China asserts that UNCLOS limits
foreign militaries from operating in its recognized and claimed EEZ.28
With regard to regulating foreign military operations within its EEZ,
China is not the only country that makes this assertion. Others, such as
Algeria, Ecuador, Iran, Malaysia, Pakistan, and Uruguay hold this same
position.29 UNCLOS does claim that coastal nations have the authority
over scientific research within its EEZ.30 Through domestic law, China
passed the 2002 Surveying and Mapping Law of the People's Republic of
China that broadly defined research activities and made the argument
that military platforms conducting ISR be considered scientific
research.31 Combining the UNCLOS provision that allows nations to
control scientific research within its EEZ and claiming military ISR as
scientific research, China argues it should control foreign military
activity in its internationally recognized/unrecognized EEZ. The Chinese
again use domestic law in combination with international law to justify
its actions towards preventing the US from conducting FON operations
within its EEZ and self-recognized nine-dash line territories.

China's interpretation of international law is that the movement of
military ships should be restricted inside China's EEZ.32 China also
attempts to make the distinction between 'navigation' and 'passage' with
regard to military operations through China's EEZ.33 China claims it has
no problem with the 'passage' of military vessels/aircraft, but when
these units perform ISR with 'navigation' it is violating international
law, which is contrary to international norms in respect to FON. This
claim is also inconsistent with China's routine harassment of foreign
civilian vessels within the disputed maritime territories of the
nine-dash line area.

Conclusion

Because it is not a party to UNCLOS, the US lacks the ability to bring
international maritime disputes to the UN.34 The US Navy and Coast Guard
have also asserted that securing cooperation with partners in the region
is complicated due to the non-party status of the US.35 It has been
argued that by becoming a party to UNCLOS, the US could shape its
provisions and exert more influence among China's neighbors who are
affected by China's nine-dash line claim, potentially constraining
China's territorial expansion.36 Continuing not to ratify this
convention, some assert, could negatively impact the credibility of the
US to enforce international law and may influence China's boldness to
continue to stake claims in disputed territories throughout the SCS.

China has ratified UNCLOS although it rejects some of its binding
provisions, [while the [US]{.mark} has not ratified UNCLOS although it
[enforces certain provisions]{.mark} through its FON
operations]{.underline}. [Although not a party to UNCLOS, the US
consistently [disputes China's EEZ]{.mark} and nine-dash line claims
through FON operations [asserting]{.mark} rights of [customary
international law]{.mark}.]{.underline} Through these actions, [the US
has [demonstrated that it supports elements of
UNCLOS]{.mark}]{.underline}. Considering the historical precedence set
by customary international law, **[[it seems]{.mark} to be [irrelevant
whether or not the US ratifies UNCLOS]{.mark}]{.underline}**. To promote
freedom of the seas in the SCS, the US and its allies will likely
continue FON operations in an ongoing effort to contest China's
unsubstantiated claims.

[The legal regime applicable in the Arctic is]{.underline} the customary
international law as reflected in the United Nations Convention on the
Law of the Sea ([UNCLOS]{.underline}).

[[While the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [has not ratified UNCLOS, it
considers]{.mark} the convention's [navigation and jurisdiction
**provisions to be binding**]{.mark} international law]{.underline}. The
convention advances and [[protects]{.mark} the [national security,
environment]{.mark}al, [and economic interests of all
nations]{.mark}]{.underline}, including the United States, codifying the
navigational rights and freedoms that are critical to American military
and commercial vessels. It also secures economic rights to offshore
natural resources.26

Article 76 of the convention allows nations to claim jurisdiction past
their exclusive economic zones on the basis of undersea features that
are considered extensions of the continental shelf, if a structure is
geologically similar to a nation's continental landmass.27 In May 2008
[five of the Arctic nations [adopted the Illulissat Declaration, which
acknowledges]{.mark} that "**[the Law of the Sea is the]{.mark}**
relevant **[legal framework in the Arctic]{.mark}**" and that [there is
"no need to develop a new]{.mark} comprehensive international [legal
regime to govern the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}," committing the
signatories to an "orderly settlement of any possible overlapping
claims."28

Currently there are overlapping, unresolved maritime boundary claims
between the United States and Canada, Canada and Denmark, Denmark and
Norway, and Norway and Russia. At this time, none of these disputed
boundary claims pose a threat to global stability. [While the United
States and Canada disagree on the location of the maritime boundary in
and northward of the Beaufort Sea, the United States considers Canada a
close ally, and the dispute does not jeopardize this
relationship]{.underline}.29

[The hopes for [**coop**eration with Russia]{.mark} in the Arctic
[continue to cool]{.mark}.]{.underline} Days after [a U.S. [**diplomat**
stated]{.mark} that [coop]{.mark}eration with Russia in the
Arctic]{.underline} was now virtually [impossible]{.underline}, the
[[**Kremlin** published **amendments** to its Arctic
policy]{.underline}]{.mark}. President Putin signed the decree earlier
this week on 21 February. 

The updated document places [[greater emphasis on Russian **national**
**interests**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the region and [[**removes**
specific mentions for **coop**]{.mark}eration within the Arctic
**Council**.]{.underline}

While the original policy, published in March 2020, called for the
"strengthening of good neighborly relations with the Arctic states" in
the fields of economic, scientific, cultural and cross-border
cooperation the amended version removes the above section and instead
calls for the "development of relations with foreign states on a
bilateral basis, \[...\] taking into account the national interests of
the Russian Federation in the Arctic."

The amended text also [[removes]{.mark} mentions of "the [framework of
**multilat**]{.mark}**eral** regional cooperation formats]{.underline},
including the Arctic Council, the coastal Arctic \"five\" and the
Council of the Barents Euro-Arctic Region." 

In [the original policy]{.underline} the section on international
cooperation, [placed significant [emphasis on work within
"**multilat**]{.mark}**eral** regional [cooperation
formats]{.mark}\"]{.underline} for the purpose of building up economic,
scientific and technological, as well as cultural cooperation. It did
not make any mention of prioritizing Russian national interests. 

In contrast, the wording of the revised document [now [places]{.mark}
the country's [national **interests**]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Arctic
[[ahead of work towards]{.underline}]{.mark} economic, scientific and
technological, and cultural [[coop]{.mark}eration]{.underline}. 

Just last week, [U.S. military leaders emphasized that the Arctic was
now Russia's number one **priority**]{.underline}.

Independence from western technology The updated version also places a
greater emphasis on Russian self-reliance in the region. It calls for
ensuring "import independence of the shipbuilding complex," clearly a
response to western sanctions which have affected Russia's ability to
order and purchase ice-capable gas and oil tankers at foreign shipyards.
The amended version of the policy calls for the "development and
modernization of shipbuilding and ship repair facilities for the
construction and maintenance of ships navigating in the waters of the
Northern Sea Route." In terms of energy supply for population centers
and industrial facilities along the NSR the policy now calls for the use
of domestically-built "low-power nuclear power plants." The first such
facility, the floating nuclear power plant Akademik Lomonosov was towed
through the Baltics and up the Norwegian coastline in 2018 to the Arctic
town of Pevek to supply electrical power and residential heat. A

prospects for]{.mark} continued [Arctic cooperation as relations]{.mark}
[between Moscow and Western]{.mark} capitals [plummet to new
lows]{.mark} 18 months into Russia's invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}.

"Under the current conditions, we are forced to announce the withdrawal
of the Russian Federation from Barents Euro-Arctic Cooperation (BEAC),"
the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.

"Through the fault of the Western members (Denmark, Iceland, Norway,
Finland, Sweden, the EU), the Council's activities have been effectively
paralysed since March 2022. The Finnish presidency failed to confirm the
transfer of the BEAC presidency to Russia, scheduled for October 2023,
in violation of the principle of rotation thus disrupting the necessary
preparations," the statement added.

[Russia was informally dismissed from the BEAC]{.underline}, which has
done work in areas including environmental protection, rights of
indigenous peoples, conservation, and the sustainable management of
forest resources, in the opening stages of its 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

**[[A similar situation is]{.mark} playing out [in the Arctic
Council]{.mark}]{.underline}**, whose seven other members --- Canada,
the United States, and the five Nordic states --- announced in March
2022 that they will not convene under Russian chairmanship or work on
projects involving Russia, the region's largest geographical
stakeholder.

[The BEAC and Arctic Council]{.underline}, established in 1993 and 1996,
respectively, [reflected a uniquely optimistic moment in Russian-Western
relations.]{.underline} With the Cold War in the rearview mirror at the
end of 1991, there was an almost millenarian sense among former Cold War
rivals that there was nothing stopping a fledgling Russian Federation
from joining hands with the West to build a better world.

[Many of these [multilateral institutions]{.mark}, established or

"**[[Cooperation is based on]{.mark} values and on [trust]{.mark}. [And

Jari Vilén, according to the Barents Observer. [[Western
governments]{.underline}]{.mark}, in keeping with Vilén's line of
reasoning, [[have tried to eject Russia from multilateral
organizations]{.mark} [and marginalize its role in]{.mark} any

### S \-\-- Geoengineering

#### The Arctic Council can't solve geoengineering\-\--it doesn't affect national security and nations just wouldn't agree.

Management with the University of Alaska Fairbanks (Alec, 5/25, "Arctic
Sea Ice Decline and Geoengineering Solutions: Cascading Security and
Ethical Considerations" https://www.mdpi.com/2078-1547/13/1/22) atn

Such challenges remain the purview of the diplomatic corps of the world
who are well trained and experienced in dealing with multinational
issues and tensions. For the circumpolar North, the Arctic Council
represents the lead international institution with significant
proficiency in overseeing efforts in support of environmental and
Indigenous solutions. Although unlikely to directly oversee
geoengineering efforts for the Arctic, the organization provides a
highly relevant example of what coalition-led efforts offer in the realm
of scientific uncertainty and understanding that is deeply connected to
regional stakeholders. It is plausible that the Arctic Council could
contribute to any number of components, whether through efforts to
improve scientific understanding, through enhanced monitoring, or
through the establishment of guidance based working groups, making the
lessons learned there additionally valuable to any implementation
strategies. Many Arctic Council projects and initiatives involve the
study of processes that affect the entire region, not unlike
geoengineering. [[The Arctic Council is]{.mark} by design a
[consensus-based]{.mark} organization]{.underline}, where the eight
member nations retain decision-making authority, and six permanent
participant groups representing Arctic Indigenous peoples have full
consultation rights. Of note, [the Arctic Council [does not engage in
issues of]{.mark} military [security]{.mark}]{.underline} \[30\]. As a
result, [topics involving sensitive national security interests cannot
get in on the agenda]{.underline}, or they are otherwise rejected if
member nations are instructed or compelled to do so. The securitization
process warns us that issues can go from acceptable dialogue and
consideration to a diplomatically difficult situation---possibly even
elevated to an emergency level in extreme scenarios. To maintain a
geoengineering dialogue in a collaborative or consensus building
environment such as the Arctic Council, it will require an understanding
of potential conflict and competition points in advance to prevent or
limit the securitization of these issues.

[[Within that context]{.underline}]{.mark}, it is not only possible but
plausible that [[nations]{.mark} may [not]{.mark} easily [agree to
geoengineering]{.mark} solutions [as a]{.mark} [result of
conflicting]{.mark} national [security interests]{.mark}]{.underline}.
To disregard such opposition, even in an adversarial-based system (such
as the United Nations), might lead to the development of dangerous
consequences. Unlike the Arctic Council, it would be anticipated that
the responsible body with regard to Arctic geoengineering would likely
have two overarching organizational objectives: (1) identifying and
defining the problem(s) to be resolved in a typical framework instrument
(e.g., Vienna Convention), followed by (2) establishing the
implementation, maintenance, and inspection/review requirements in a
typical protocol instrument, such as the Montreal Protocol \[31\]. What
determines the structure and authorities of any potential
geoengineering-related organization is yet to be seen, although the
history and process of similarly related endeavors are well-known and
documented. Part of any international organization's efforts involving
management of geoengineering will invariably include a significant
amount of interdisciplinary literature reviews. For example, not only
will the impact of global climate systems as a result of geoengineering
need to be relatively well known, but a critical understanding of the
processes and norms of securitization and consequentialism will also
need to be a part of considerations where tensions over issues are
concerned. It is of paramount importance that international
organizations are set up for success from the start, because the
alternatives are often exponentially counter-productive, and delays late
in the process may lead to a failure to reach diplomatic solutions.

As with any international treaty/convention, the most commonly
recognized types concern international law \[32\], but not all nations
become full-party members, nor do all nations remain members. This would
likely be the case with any framework convention and protocol involving
Arctic geoengineering, especially because the vast majority of
environmental agreements tend to function on the premise of reducing
production, consumption, or processes, rather than the introduction of
engineering-based solutions. For example, the international solution for
dealing with the ozone problem as per the Montreal Protocol involved a
significant reduction in use of the substances responsible for the
problem. Other agreements have found solutions in reductions or a change
in human behaviors, such as the precautionary moratorium on unregulated
high-seas Arctic fishing activities, until a greater understanding of
impacts could be achieved \[3\]; [however, [geoengineering]{.mark}
solutions [in]{.mark}]{.underline} the context of this article
[[will]{.mark} likely [involve adding something]{.mark} new [to the
environment, which]{.mark}, once released, might [not be]{.mark} as
[easily controlled]{.mark}.]{.underline} This circumstance would be
fairly novel and especially difficult as part of an agreement, based on
ongoing monitoring and management requirements. Unlike other conventions
where non-party member nations might not interfere with the agreement,
geoengineering in the Arctic atmosphere would undoubtedly draw active
opposition from non-party members. [Whether in the Arctic, Northern
Hemisphere, or anywhere else, [affected nations]{.mark} could have a
justification for [withhold]{.mark}ing [support]{.mark}, knowing full
well that what happens in the Arctic does not stay in the
Arctic.]{.underline}

This leads to the potential for a range of scenarios, where independent
or unilateral attempts at geoengineering solutions may have consequences
outside the intended area of impact, and may affect the food security,
energy security, and other forms of security within other nation's
political boundaries. Modeling efforts have already identified that
asymmetrical approaches to geoengineering in the Arctic may lead to
alterations in the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), creating a
reduction in local precipitation in portions of the Southern hemisphere
\[33\]. Although the oceans and atmosphere form components of the global
commons \[34\], alterations to those features have the potential to
directly affect areas within terrestrial boundaries. [[Prior conflicts
over fishing resources, including access]{.mark} [and distribution,
offer examples]{.mark} here as [to]{.mark} the [connections
between]{.mark} shared [resources]{.mark} and the potential for
conflict]{.underline}. Previous efforts at geoengineering, such as iron
fertilization, when connected with issues of fishery management, may
provide insights as to the ability for such issues to become securitized
\[35\]. Additionally, when framed as a disruptive technology,
[[nation-states]{.mark} may be [incentivized to develop]{.mark} cutting
edge [systems that produce improvements]{.mark} to regional outputs,
whether from fisheries, agriculture, or other means, [at the cost of
neighboring]{.mark} or even distant [regions, creating]{.mark} regional
losses that may generate [antagonistic perceptions]{.mark}.]{.underline}

3.3 Security

Inherently, geoengineering is about global security as it is envisioned
as a means to secure humanity and the planet from a disastrous future.
By virtue of its importance in global climate dynamics, the Arctic
region easily lends itself to both broad and more targeted climate
interventions (Versen et al. 2022). Thus, the Arctic region and
geoengineering are entwined in the global politics of climate change,
and a widely held assumption is that as climate change effects multiply
so will the impetus for enacting increasingly radical climate
interventions (Corry 2017). As argued by Bennett et al. (2022, 6) "t[o
assume that an Arctic geoengineering solution will be developed and
implemented through naturally peaceful and cooperative means might be a
mistake". [Arctic geoengineering]{.mark} solutions [may]{.mark} thus
[become sources of conflict]{.mark} and contestation in and of
themselves, alongside emerging conflicts due to climate
change]{.underline}. Indeed, [[when]{.mark} Arctic [ice loss is
argued]{.mark} by retired NASA scientists [as a]{.mark} direct [threat
to US]{.mark} national [security]{.mark}]{.underline} (Strawa et al.
2020), [solutions like [geoengineering]{.mark} become clad in the
national security policy language of emergency, speed, and
inevitability, [seen]{.mark} as measures of necessity [with little
regard for]{.mark} the [consequences]{.mark}]{.underline} (cf. Buzan et
al. 1998).

More broadly, our engagement with the literature reveals that Arctic
geoengineering plays several roles in relation to security. In the first
instance, as the threats and dangers associated with climate change
intensify and become more encompassing and immanent, climate
interventions become more appealing policy options because they promise
to alleviate the increasingly serious security threats connected to
climate change. From both a policy and a mitigation perspective, polar
ice---both sea ice and the Greenland ice sheet---seem efficient objects
of intervention. As bluntly stated in one analysis, doing solar
geoengineering would require a near-global consensus, whereas
intervening on the Greenland ice sheet is a decision that can be made by
the Greenlandic Home Rule Government alone (Moore et al. 2021), making
the Arctic an easier "target" for geoengineering experimentation.

Another way of understanding Arctic geoengineering in relation to
security is to see the activity in and of itself creating security
issues in two distinct but interrelated ways. First, compared to more
general security concerns raised in relation to geoengineering, some are
[concerned that [one actor\'s]{.mark} [geoengineering]{.mark}
initiatives [may be considered as infringing on]{.mark} the [sovereign
rights]{.mark} or territories [of other actors]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Bennett et al. 2022). Second, [[military]{.mark} actors,
infrastructure, and capabilities are [often envisioned]{.mark}
[as]{.mark} playing a [substantial]{.mark} part [in conducting]{.mark}
actual [geoengineering. **Especially if done unilaterally**]{.mark},
this may [in a low-trust environment like the]{.mark} current
[Arctic]{.mark} Region be [seen as a **militarizing** instrument of
power projection]{.mark}]{.underline} (Scheffran 2019). Indeed,
[highlighting geoengineering as a potentially militarily conducted
activity with the risk of interfering with other states sovereign rights
shows the relation between geoengineering and security
clearly.]{.underline}

Further, [a key critique of geoengineering is that enacting it may
potentially have detrimental and/or unforeseen effects unevenly spread
out among a multitude of subjects and outside the intended area of
impact. It is, in effect, increasing someone\'s security on behalf of
others]{.underline}. [[Targeted climate interventions]{.mark} in the
Arctic [can]{.mark}, from an outside-in perspective, [be seen as
global]{.mark} (powerful) [actors]{.mark} tinkering with the Arctic
region to [secure themselves]{.mark}]{.underline} (cf. Strawa et al.
2020), [potentially **[disregarding local concerns]{.mark}** and
creating local insecurities deemed unimportant in the "bigger picture"
of national or global climate security concerns. [Sami concerns
about]{.mark} experiments with stratospheric [aerosol injection]{.mark}
in Sweden [illustrate this]{.mark}]{.underline} (Oksanen 2023). This
dynamic ties the security dimension of geoengineering to the above
discussion of (especially indigenous) rights and rights-holders.
Detrimental effects of Arctic geoengineering may, however, also work in
an inside-out logic. Bennet et al. mention how geoengineering in the
Arctic may inadvertently reduce local precipitation in parts of the
Southern Hemisphere (Bennett et al. 2022). This would have direct food
security implications for human livelihoods far away from the otherwise
targeted geoengineering, and food security is a well-established driver
for political instability and wider insecurity (e.g., Rudolfsen 2020).
This perspective makes Arctic geoengineering a potential driver for
insecurity and conflict both within and outside the Arctic Region.

In conclusion, the many ways geoengineering targeted on the Arctic
becomes implicated with different forms of security highlights the high
stakes and the many stakeholders involved in governing climate change.
High stakes---existential threats---are the essence of security. Taken
together, the literature on Arctic geoengineering that engages with how
to govern the security implications of these climate interventions
underscores that a myriad of subjects\' security at very different
scales---from local communities to the global---are made insecure not
only by climate change but also by the means to mitigate it.

4 Arctic Geoengineering as a Multifaceted Governance Problem

While concern for governance appears to be slowly increasing, including
its global, regional, and local aspects (Barclay 2021; Bodansky and Hunt
2020; Carlarne 2010; Egede-Nissen and Venema 2009; Long 2013), the
[**[governance]{.mark} aspect [is underemphasized]{.mark}** in the
literature at large]{.underline}. [Most of the work focuses on how to
technologically do geoengineering rather than who legitimately decides
whether to do it, how to do it, and what social and political
consequences and risks follow from doing it]{.underline}. Further,
within the governance literature, law is under-represented. This is
concerning due to the potential impacts of Arctic geoengineering for the
enjoyment of human rights and environmental protection, and the central
role that legal regimes and regulation play in mitigating negative
effects of human activities on both humans and nature.

Our review highlights that there may be some potential benefits to
targeted geoengineering, but also significant environmental, social, and
political risks. While it is not our objective to pass judgment on
whether targeted geoengineering is sensible, our findings highlight the
need for more extensive interdisciplinary studies on geoengineering that
take the above-mentioned risks into account. It is in our view
[[essential to address]{.mark} the [disconnect between research]{.mark}
on geoengineering methods [and]{.mark} their
[governance]{.mark}]{.underline}. Considering the divide in the
literature between technical feasibility and potential risks on the one
hand and implications for the environment, people, and security on the
other hand, cross-disciplinary research approaches are necessary. Such
research can contribute to addressing the question of how the regional
governance system should tackle and embed targeted interventions\'
environmental challenges together with the people and security
challenges. The literature demonstrates a need for a fair and effective
governance of geoengineering (e.g., Bodansky and Hunt 2020; Long 2013).
Effective governance should ensure that a precautionary approach
prevents interventions that may have an undesired effect on the
ecosystems, and at the same time only allows those interventions to
proceed that are backed up by enough scientific evidence on their
impacts in view of avoiding a climate catastrophe. [Fair governance
[requires]{.mark} specific [considerations for]{.mark} the risks,
rights, and interests of [Indigenous Peoples]{.mark} and Local
Communities]{.underline}, and their inclusion in all governance
processes. This should not only be reflected in research on individual
governance aspects but transpire into all research approaches.

[[Due to]{.mark} the potentially [significant risk for Indigenous
Peoples]{.mark}]{.underline} and Local Communities, governance of
geoengineering will need to consider the people dimension (Argüello and
Johansson 2022), and find ways to mitigate concerns related to the
impact of these technologies on Indigenous Peoples. This applies to both
the deployment of geoengineering, as well as the research which precedes
it (Bennett et al. 2022; Lawrence et al. 2018). As highlighted
previously, substantial parts of the literature do not focus on
governance issues, framing geoengineering as a technical problem.
However, the most [significant problems with geoengineering in places
like the Arctic may indeed be non-technical ones. The [political
risks]{.mark} associated with geoengineering potentially taking place in
a social setting [with few strong governance structures]{.mark}, many
right-holders at different levels, [and increased geopolitical
tensions]{.mark} may turn out to be significant too]{.underline}. This
could become compounded by increasing commercial interest in
geoengineering, which would bring even more actors into the picture.
[Framing the issue only in technical terms harbors the risk of
technocratic decision-making]{.underline}, which may frustrate
governance processes later on. [[Bridging]{.mark} the divide between the
[technical]{.mark} aspects of the [research and]{.mark} the
[implications for people]{.mark} living in the Arctic region [is]{.mark}
therefore [imperative]{.mark}, both [to enhance]{.mark} the
[quality]{.mark} of scientific research [and]{.mark},]{.underline} even
more importantly, [to prevent]{.underline} the recurring perpetration of
injustice and the risk of increasingly [contentious international
**[relations in the Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Should Arctic
geoengineering research move from theoretical research and modeling to
practical experiments, more consideration is needed for how
geoengineering is governed. This again highlights the importance of
interdisciplinary research approaches.

5 Conclusion: A Call for Interdisciplinarity

As the effects of climate change are materializing rapidly in the
Arctic, the geoengineering discourse is gaining traction. However, the
present state of the literature raises a number of questions. While
necessary to have strong scientific and technical foundational studies
on Arctic geoengineering, we believe that the divide between the natural
sciences and technology studies on the one hand, and societal
considerations on the other hand, has the potential to lead to
technocratic decision-making that fails to consider the possible effects
of these technologies on the Arctic environment, on the Arctic peoples,
and the potential security concerns both inside and beyond the Arctic.
Interdisciplinary and [[inclusive decision-making]{.mark} processes that
take all stake- and right-holders into account are a [**precondition**
for effective]{.mark} and just [governance of
geoengineering]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, we observe an urgent need
to bridge the divide between governance, scientific research, and
Indigenous knowledge. In order to avoid governance traps and a
governance vacuum, it is essential that governance develops closely
alongside technology---this also has [merit from a security aspect, as
it may contribute to [prevent]{.mark}ing [security concerns]{.mark} that
[**unilateral development**]{.mark} of technologies [may
bring]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Research that focuses on the
technological aspects of geoengineering should therefore include
governance and policy considerations, instead of leaving the "governance
problem" to later or to other disciplines.

Overall, this review highlights the benefits and need for cooperation
and inter- and transdisciplinary approaches to Arctic geoengineering
research, including both western science and other types of knowledge.
These would [help the development of governance proposals that consider
the wider consequences of Arctic geoengineering for the environment,
people, and security in a holistic manner]{.underline}.

#### The Arctic Council is key to research and governance for geoengineering -- unilateral action fails to solve for international challenges

Henry David **Venema** **&** Bjørnar **Egede-Nissen**, 20**09**, \[PhD

So if the challenge of **[[geoengineering requires a global
solution]{.underline}]{.mark}**, why should a regional organization like
the Arctic Council (the Council) be involved? The goal of this paper was
to look specifically at the consequences of business-as-usual in the
Arctic, and to discuss geoengineering in the context of catastrophic
climate change in this vulnerable region. Geoengineering poses [dramatic
challenges for all of the [Arctic countries]{.mark},]{.underline} which
[have committed]{.underline} themselves [to [cooperat]{.mark}ing
[through the Council]{.mark}]{.underline}. [As [the only]{.mark}
[circumpolar governance forum]{.mark} on environmental issues, the
Council is an obvious venue for discussion.]{.underline}

We neither foresee nor prescribe that the Council should reinvent itself
as a planetary engineer. It makes little sense that only eight
countries---even if they include both the largest country on the planet,
and the most powerful one---should dictate the climate of our planet.
Quite the contrary: we argue that these [countries have a fundamental
responsibility to address the biophysical foundations of climate change
through mitigation]{.underline}. A corollary is that although
geoengineering may be available as an emergency solution, the more they
drag their feet on mitigation, the more dramatic an eventual
intervention would have to be.

But what can the Council do? Does considering geoengineering in any way
even fall within its mandate? At its inception, the Arctic governments
declared that the purpose of the Council is to provide a mechanism for
addressing the common concerns and the challenges faced by their
governments and the people of the Arctic. To this end, Ministers
referred particularly to the protection of the Arctic environment and
sustainable development as a means of improving the economic, social and
cultural well-being in the North (Joint communiqué, 1996).

[The protection of the Arctic environment is the main driver of the
Council]{.underline}, though it is worth noting that [its mandate is
open-ended, not barring other areas]{.underline}, save military ones
(Joint communiqué, 1996). Given that fact, [[geoengineering]{.mark} is
as **[appropriate]{.mark}** a [topic for the Council]{.mark} as any
other]{.underline}.

Geoengineering, however, is by definition unsustainable; it is the worst
possible end-of-pipe solution. Continuous intervention is required to
offset the effects of GHGs through SRM. Although only supposed to be
temporary, it would have to be sustained for years, all the while doing
nothing to alleviate the real problem and allowing the oceans to become
increasingly acidic. That would seem to be the diametric opposite of the
Council's sustainable development mandate. Nevertheless, that the day
may come when [geoengineering is considered the best way of protecting
the global and the Arctic environment, and if [the Council]{.mark} takes
its mandate seriously, it [needs to be prepared]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The role of the Council would be moderated by [whether the actual act of
[geoengineering]{.mark} would [take place in the Arctic]{.mark} or
somewhere else. If there are benefits to placing aerosol injection in an
Arctic country[, the Council]{.mark} has [good]{.mark} reason [to
be]{.mark}come [involved]{.mark}]{.underline}. But atmospheric particles
know no bounds: they habitually and indiscriminately violate other
countries' airspace, so geoengineering anywhere in the northern
hemisphere will have a direct bearing on the Arctic. And there is little
Arctic countries can do to stop them; at least the smaller ones---the
writ of the U.S. or Russia is certainly more global. Conversely[, it
could be in the interest of the [Council]{.mark} to [convince]{.mark}
the rest of [the global community to deploy geoengineering]{.mark} in
order to save the Arctic]{.underline}, and it might be met with deaf
ears.

The questions that remain unanswered are what exactly the Council can
do, and what its role should be. Speaking as the Chair of the Senior
Arctic Officials, another piece in the Arctic governance tapestry,
Icelandic Ambassador to the United Nations Gunnar Pálsson extolled in
2004 that ―that climate change itself could and should be arrested and
even reversed through human enterprise‖ (Pálsson, 2004, p. 4). Although
not a direct endorsement, reversing climate change through human
enterprise is geoengineering. The Council does not need to endorse
geoengineering; it should not, however, ignore the issue or pass
judgment until the concept and its consequences---both good and
bad---are better understood. This paper suggests that there are [two
areas where the Council can play an important role]{.underline} when it
comes to geoengineering: the very obvious [one is research; the other is
governance]{.underline}. These are discussed below.

Global and regional governance

Smaller [[countries]{.underline}]{.mark} in particular would benefit
from a strong Council. But [[if]{.mark} they are [serious about]{.mark}
[protecting the Arctic]{.mark}, solving collective action problems and
otherwise fostering Arctic cooperation, Arctic states, big or small,
**[cannot]{.mark}** act alone or otherwise **[abandon the
Council]{.mark}** on this issue.]{.underline} Franklyn Griffiths's
Arctic policy paper, discussed earlier, recommends that Canada should
cooperate bilaterally with the United States on geoengineering (2009, p.
19). [**[Unilateral]{.mark}**ism, however, or restricted [geoengineer
"clubs"]{.mark} of countries or private arrangements of any kind,
[**ought to be avoided,** as it could set]{.mark} [an undesirable
precedent]{.mark} for the handling of this and similar
issues]{.underline}.

Yet, as it is based on soft law, the Council cannot compel any of its
members to do anything (Koivurova & Vanderzwaag, 2007). The Council has
received much criticism for its apparent timidity and lack of teeth
(Young, 2009). [It can [only function if]{.mark} its [members agree
to]{.mark} use it and [control their unilateral]{.mark} and isolationist
[instincts]{.mark}]{.underline}; the kind which are behind the
increasingly hostile tone of some Arctic countries with regard to
territorial issues. The Council itself, and its members, have recognized
the need for organizational changes; the 2004 Reykjavik Ministerial
Meeting concluded that the Council may need to reorganize itself to
better deal with climate change (Koivurova & Vanderzwaag, 2007, p. 56).
More formal arrangements like an Arctic treaty in the mould of the
Antarctic Treaty have been discussed, but most observers regard such
prospects as dim (Koivurova & Vanderzwaag, 2007; Young, 2009; Keskitalo,
Koivurova, & Bankes, 2009). Though many focus on the limits of soft law,
others argue it has distinct advantages, which are more valuable for
Arctic political cooperation at this point in time (Young, 2009). As
several scholars argue, the political circumstances in the Arctic not
only make a treaty flatly unrealistic, but also undesirable (Young,
2009; Keskitalo et al., 2009). The Council has evolved into a highly
unique and dynamic organization, counting among its members not only
states but also organizations representing indigenous peoples as
permanent participants (Heinämäki, 2009; Tennberg, 2001), and other
non-state actors that have been bound together in what Oran Young, a
veteran in Arctic affairs, calls the ―tapestry of transboundary
cooperation in the circumpolar north (2009, p. 76). The Council is a
central element in this tapestry. Rather than spending its scarce
resources on navigating the treacherous straits of treaty making, the
Council has been able to focus its efforts instead on building
community, regional cohesion, a sense of common purpose and scientific
consensus---an approach that has had considerable success (Jabour &
Weber, 2008; Young, 2009).

Young argues that this may actually be the Council's greatest strength:

Where, then, does the comparative advantage of the Arctic Council lie?
It may come as a surprise to some to realize that the council\'s most
important role is probably generative in nature. Through its very
existence, the council has become a symbol of the emergence of the
Arctic as a distinct region in international society (Young, 2000, p.
15).

He goes on to say that the [**[role of the Council in]{.mark} dictating
the [policy]{.mark}** agenda for the circumpolar north]{.underline} and
in framing the issues that occupy prominent places on this agenda [[are
important]{.mark} parts of that [generative power]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Young, 2000, p. 15). Discursive power can thus be said to be the true
face of the Council's authority, [and [in line with]{.mark} what is
required in the construction of [geoengineering
governance---framing]{.mark} the issue [is going to be
paramount]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[It helps [the Council]{.mark}'s legitimacy that it is not purely an
inter-state institution, but [counts indigenous]{.mark} organizations as
permanent [participants;]{.mark} thus [it]{.mark} can actually say that
it [represents the voice of people]{.mark} living in the Arctic and not
merely the interests of countries that are only partially in the
Arctic]{.underline}, and whose capitals are mostly in the south.
Indigenous people have traditionally been among the weakest and least
represented constituents of the North (Heinämäki, 2009; Shadian, 2007),
and the recent focus on resource extraction, shipping, territoriality
and sovereignty by southern interests illustrates that this is still
largely the case. By investing in the Council, the Arctic Eight have a
good opportunity to show that they take the opinions of their Arctic
inhabitants seriously, since indigenous organizations can communicate
with these countries on an equal footing in the Council.

On the other hand, this may have led to the suppression of knowledge and
opinions from nonindigenous Arctic inhabitants, who experienced
difficulties when trying to register their own concerns with their
national government (Nilsson, 2009). The [Council has nevertheless
[shown considerable acumen in bridging]{.mark}]{.underline} the politics
of scale between [[the local and regional, and]{.underline}]{.mark} its
success in bridging the divide between [[regional and
global]{.underline}]{.mark} also speaks to its advantage (Nilsson,
2009). There are two ways to see this divide between local and global
[when it comes to geoengineering; it is a sword that cuts both ways: it
is at once a local action with global effects, and global changes with
local effects. [Considering the]{.mark} wildly disparate [effects
geoengineering might have]{.mark} across the [global]{.mark} landscape,
and the sensitivity of the Arctic to climate change, **[bridging the
gap]{.mark}** between the local and the global [should be]{.mark} a
[central]{.mark} task for the Council]{.underline}. This would include
cooperating and creating linkages with other organizations and forums at
the Arctic, interregional and global level.

Research

[The **[Council]{.mark} may thus be [well positioned
]{.mark}**[to]{.mark} contribute to the [social and political
construction of geoengineering]{.mark}, but governance is not the only
thing the Council can generate. [Research]{.mark}]{.underline}, the
framing of climate change and [the creation of knowledge about [climate
change in the Arctic]{.mark} context]{.underline} have been important
parts of their generative work, and have become [[**core competencies**
of the Council]{.underline}]{.mark}, central pillars of its existence
and legitimacy, and essential to its success as a regional forum. Most
of its working groups are oriented around research agendas. The Arctic
Monitoring and Assessment Program (AMAP) has been at the core of Arctic
cooperation since before the Council was even created, at which point it
became the largest working group within the Council (Koivurova &
Vanderzwaag, 2007; Tennberg, 2001). ACIA, as mentioned previously, has
given the Council a strong foundation in climate research, and AMAP is
working on an update called \"Climate Change and the Arctic Cryosphere:
Snow, Water, Ice and Permafrost in the Arctic, now in the final stages
of preparation (Hansen, 2009).

One could say that the Council has become to the Arctic what the IPCC is
to climate change, though this comparison can only be taken so far. Part
of the Council's (and particularly ACIA's) success stems from its unique
structure, which allows indigenous organizations full rights to
participate in working groups and in the scientific steering committees
that are behind assessment reports (Heinämäki, 2009; Nilsson, 2009;
Tennberg, 2001). This had led to the incorporation of knowledge and
information that would not otherwise be considered scientific, but which
nevertheless adds value to the Council's work. [Indigenous observations
of climate change are among the information passed along to the
Council.]{.underline}

[As a [result of the Council]{.mark}, our [understanding of]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} vulnerable [North has increased
tremendously]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Council had good reason to focus
on science and research initially, as knowledge about environmental
problems in the Arctic was highly rudimentary (Tennberg, 2001). Our poor
knowledge of things like feedbacks demonstrates that research is still
necessary, and as noted previously, the scientific foundation of
geoengineering in the Arctic and in general is embryonic to say the
least. As of yet, we are aware of only three papers that have discussed
geoengineering specifically in the Arctic context.

[Being a forum that enjoys a high degree of legitimacy, the [Council
could]{.mark} make itself useful in [build]{.mark}ing [trust]{.mark}
[between the scientific community, policy-makers and the
public]{.mark}]{.underline}. Building trust between scientists and the
general public, writes Paul Crutzen, one of the scientists responsible
for bringing geoengineering to the fore, would be [[needed to
make]{.mark} such a large-scale [climate modification
acceptable]{.mark}]{.underline}, [even if i]{.underline}t would be
judged to be [advantageous]{.underline} (2006, p. 217). [Policymakers
may have to deal with a highly skeptical public when it comes to
geoengineering]{.underline}, depending on the socio-political
construction of the issue. There is ample reason for suspicion. For
example, the priorities of the Canadian government in the North of late
do not inspire confidence that it is sufficiently concerned about the
consequences of climate change.

An [[evaluation of]{.mark} the merits of [geoengineering cannot be done
without a]{.mark} firmer [scientific foundation]{.mark}, and this is one
area where **[the Council can excel]{.mark}**. Its role as a producer of
high-quality, impartial and consensus-based research speaks well
[for]{.mark} its ability to produce [good]{.mark} [and agenda-free
knowledge about geoengineering]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the grand scheme
of things, research is relatively cheap12; yet, regardless of cost, it
would be completely irresponsible not to do this kind of research. An
uncomfortable question is [whether [the Council should
concentrate]{.mark} solely [on the consequences of
geoengineering]{.mark} or whether it should aid [and]{.mark}
[abet]{.mark} the [research into]{.mark} actual techniques and
[engineering implementations]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [answer is
both]{.underline}. In anticipation that the mitigation strategies we are
pursuing might ultimately fail, heavy investment will be necessary to
make sure geoengineering is as safe and reliable as possible---unsavoury
as that option might be. But geoengineering should only be another leg
in the climate change adaptation strategy, not the mainstay of Arctic
climate policy.

### S -- Indigenous

**The AC reproduces colonial dominance**

[[The Arctic Council]{.underline}]{.mark}, with all of its intentions of
inclusion, **[[still participate in]{.mark} the [colonial]{.mark},
[settler state domination of Indigenous nations]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
There is a clear demarcation between principle and practice in the
Arctic Council. [[There are problems with sovereignty in]{.mark} the
[international]{.mark} governance [institution]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
simultaneously there has been significant progress for Indigenous
peoples in international governance, specifically in the Arctic Council
for Permanent Participants. [[Indigenous]{.mark} nation's [sovereignty
is entangled with state sovereignty]{.mark}, as sovereignty is based on
engagement with other authorities, and power is based through
negotiations with other powers.]{.underline} This relates to Gordon
Christie's (2011) approach to governance and sovereignty, as
[[approaches]{.mark} to sovereignty [are dominated by settler state
frameworks]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indigenous nations can choose to
operate within that state-based framework, in this case within the
Arctic Council, and demand to address the obstacles to capacity
presented in my results. Another mode of exerting self-determination and
power in the Arctic is through creative means of exerting authority by
ways of respect, reciprocity, and collaboration among Indigenous
nations.

This work examines the political participation of Indigenous peoples in
the Arctic through the lens of the Arctic Council. The Arctic Council
conceptualizes Indigenous peoples through the designation of the
Permanent Participants, non-governmental organizations formed to
represent Indigenous peoples in the Arctic. The inclusion of the
Permanent Participants in the Arctic Council is a notable achievement
for the political agency of Indigenous peoples, specifically in agenda
setting and decision-making in the consensus-based forum. However, [the
nature of [international institutions]{.mark} [centers the settler
state]{.mark}, [and places]{.mark} institutional and operational
[constraints]{.mark} on the Permanent Participants [that
prevents]{.mark} the full application of [sovereignty and
self-determination by Indigenous peoples]{.mark} in the
Arctic.]{.underline} This is important because encroaching resource
development interests, such as oil drilling and shipping, have local and
global consequences, and [[it is critical to include]{.mark} the
original stewards of the land, the [Indigenous peoples]{.mark} of the
Arctic, [in]{.mark} making [decisions about the land that sustains
them]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Through a qualitative mixed methods approach of documentary analysis and
interviews I found that there are obstacles within the Arctic Council
that obfuscate the participation of Indigenous peoples to the fullest
extent. I examined the Protection of the Marine Environment's Meaningful
Engagement of Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities in Marine
Activities project to understand how the Arctic Council conceptualizes
meaningful engagement and the participation of Indigenous peoples in
Arctic Council projects. I interviewed professionals who work in
Permanent Participant organization and those who have studied the Arctic
Council to elucidate levels of Indigenous participation in practical
applications of Arctic Council projects. The MEMA Reports signaled the
value of engagement of Indigenous peoples in Arctic council projects in
principle, but the interviews with individuals who have worked in and
about the Arctic Council indicate that there is room for improvement and
the engagement principles are not actualized in practice.

[[The]{.mark} Arctic [Council is not an efficient forum]{.mark} in its
current iteration]{.underline} and could be altered due to its soft law
structure which enables flexibility in the procedural actions of the
forum. An alternative approach to governance in the Arctic that centers
the desires of Indigenous peoples is the expansion of current coalitions
and the building of new ones to assert sovereignty over land and
resources. This approach would involve applying Indigenous circumpolar
thinking to policy making in a radical move beyond the constraints of
the state dominant frameworks.

Ken Coates believes that [the Arctic Council needs to be altered in some
way to remain a relevant forum on the international stage]{.underline},
meaning political actors are closely following the agenda of the
organization. Coates indicates that the forum of [[the Arctic Council
**is no longer the most appropriate site**]{.mark} **[for Indigenous
political engagement]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and that the Arctic Council
is no longer needed, at least from the perspective of the Permanent
Participants, for their agendas to be heard. [[Many Indigenous]{.mark}
political [organizations]{.mark} now [navigate through alternative
fora]{.mark} that have arisen since the inception of the Arctic Council
to pursue their policy goals]{.underline}.

[[**Hierarchical systems constitute spheres of influence** and create
rules restricting what Indigenous participation]{.mark} will [look
like]{.mark}]{.underline}, including rights to speak in certain
institutional spaces [[within the]{.mark} Arctic
[Council]{.mark}]{.underline} (Tennberg 1996). The arrangement of the
Arctic Council has provided Indigenous peoples with indirect power, as
Indigenous peoples have been able to express concerns at the
nation-state level of decision-making. Christie (2011), however, notes
that [[only]{.mark} the [members of the]{.mark} Arctic [Council can make
binding decisions]{.mark}. **[Indigenous peoples are relegated to
certain issues]{.mark}**, and as a result issues including [mining and
resource development are restricted to states]{.mark}]{.underline}9,10 .
Policy issues such as mining and resource development need to be put on
the table for discussion or Permanent Participants will go 'forum
shopping' for a decision-making apparatus outside of the Arctic Council

#### **IPs face limitations in the AC due to its state centric framework**

This thesis has addressed to what extent the AC addresses IPs rights and
interests. [It has argued that [the AC is]{.mark} currently [a
state-centric forum due to its current framework that creates limitation
to IPs participation]{.mark} through the PPs.]{.underline}

Arctic IPs have fought for their rights as a collective of peoples with
distinctive culture and land for decades. Today they face various issues
regarding those rights in their respective states and in IR. Through the
AC the Arctic IPs have been able to participate at a transnational level
to express their interests and rights which is an important step towards
alternative sovereignty and self-determination. The AC is progressive
regarding IPs rights and interests in many ways as it is the only
platform where IPs have specific rights to consult and participate in IR
through their unique status as PPs. The PPs have similar opportunities
to represent themselves at the AC in theory as both actors can
participate at all levels of the AC. However[, in practice [they face
various obstacles that make it harder for them to represent
themselves]{.mark} than member states. The PPs do not have the resources
to attend AC activities to the same extent as the member states and to
sponsor AC projects. [Decisions and agenda in the AC can thus be made
without PPs input and without]{.mark} [Arctic IPs voices. Because of the
lack of representation, the PPs are having a difficult time to
participate in the AC]{.mark} and to provide consultation to member
state in accordance with the Ottawa Declaration (1996). The current
framework that the AC follows is thus creating challenges to the PPs and
the declaration on which the AC is built.]{.underline}

[Due to climate change and globalization the AC has been expanding and
getting more involved in various issues. Because the PPs already
struggle with the [workload it will only become increasingly harder for
them to participate]{.mark} unless the AC takes measure to address this
challenge]{.underline}. In order for the PPs to participate they need to
be able to attend AC activities and therefore need more funding to
address issues such as lack of human resources. [The current framework
that the AC follows does not seem to take this issue into account like
it should since activities are frequent. This lack of action to address
this challenge is [because the AC is state-centric and therefore makes
sure that the forum benefits the member states first]{.mark} and
foremost.]{.underline} Since the member states have the resources to
keep up with the workload the AC might not see a great enough reason to
make changes. [This is not to say that the [AC]{.mark} does not [address
PPs challenges]{.mark} but rather to point out that it might rather do
so [when it benefits the states]{.mark}.]{.underline} In this case the
member states have the opportunity to influence more than other actors
in the AC which is the most beneficial situation for them.

The member states also take turns leading the AC through the rotating
two-year chairmanship and have a veto right at the Ministerial Meeting,
unlike the PPs. [Through these roles and rights, the member states thus
have secured themselves certain opportunities to influence that the PPs
do not get.]{.underline} This was, for example, demonstrated by
comparing Iceland, a small nation-state, with the PPs. The opportunity
for Iceland to act as chair makes it easier for the state to push its
agenda than the PPs that do not get that opportunity. [This structure in
the AC is rooted in the Westphalian ideology which focuses on state
sovereignty. The member states and the PPs can both participate in the
Ministerial meetings, but the [power lies with the member states as they
have the opportunities to lead]{.mark} the AC [and to make]{.mark} or
break final [decisions]{.mark} at the Ministerial meetings. [Because IPs
are not states they are not provided with this
opportunity]{.mark}]{.underline} although as self-determining peoples an
alternative system to the Westphalian model could paint a more inclusive
picture where both actors would be afforded power.

[[Danish Prime Minister]{.underline}]{.mark} Mette [Frederiksen has
formally [acknowledged the **end of the Ilulissat Declaration**]{.mark},
a 2008 political pledge by Arctic coastal states to keep the region a
zone of low tension and peaceful cooperation]{.underline}. Speaking in
Nuuk just ahead of a state visit by French President Emmanuel Macron,
Frederiksen [[cited]{.mark} growing [geopolitical instability]{.mark} as
the reason [for abandoning]{.mark} the [principles]{.mark} laid out [in
the]{.mark} now-defunct [agreement]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"The situation is serious," Frederiksen said during a press appearance

by Denmark's Arctic Command in Greenland and growing [concerns over
Russia's reactivation of]{.mark} Cold War-era Arctic [bases and]{.mark}
establishment of [new]{.mark} [military infrastructure]{.mark} in the
region]{.underline}. In December, the Danish Defence Intelligence
Service (FE) concluded that the level of military activity in the Arctic
had not been this high since the Cold War.

"The most dangerous situation we face right now is due to the threat
from Russia toward Europe---including Greenland," Frederiksen said.
"Russia now sees itself in open conflict with the West."

[Originally signed in Ilulissat in 2008 by the five Arctic coastal
states]{.underline}---Canada, Denmark, Norway, Russia, and the United
States---[[the declaration aimed to resolve Arctic disputes
peacefully]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[under]{.underline}]{.mark}
existing [international frameworks, particularly]{.underline} the UN
Convention on the Law of the Sea ([[UNCLOS]{.underline}]{.mark}). [But
observers and [experts have]{.mark} increasingly [questioned the
declaration's relevance as military activity accelerates]{.mark} in the
region.]{.underline}

"I understand the original desire for low tension," Frederiksen added.
"There's nothing I want more than peace. But it's unavoidable that the
world has changed."

U.S. and French Dimensions

[Frederiksen also acknowledged [concerns about American rhetoric
regarding Greenland]{.mark}, particularly past remarks by U.S. President
Donald Trump referencing potential "annexation." While she did not name
Trump directly, she criticized the notion that **[Washington might not
rule out]{.mark}** the use of **[force in asserting claims in the
Arctic]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

"Discussions about using military power and annexing Greenland should
never be taking place," she said.

Frederiksen framed Macron's visit as part of a broader strategy to
strengthen European alliances in the face of pressure from both East and
West.

"No country can do this alone. When we are under unacceptable pressure
from the U.S., we---as a kingdom---depend on strong alliances with
others. I'm pleased the French president is visiting because it
reinforces European unity."

Greenlandic Autonomy Question Resurfaces

The Prime Minister's visit was not without controversy. Greenlandic
politicians, particularly from the Naleraq party, criticized Frederiksen
for not allowing Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen to
independently welcome Macron---suggesting it undercut Greenland's
autonomy.

Frederiksen rejected that framing.

"Denmark does not own Greenland. We are a commonwealth. All three
parts---Greenland, the Faroe Islands, and Denmark---belong to the
Kingdom of Denmark, but I never use the word 'ownership,'" she said.

[[As tensions **continue to rise**]{.mark} across the Arctic,
Frederiksen's blunt acknowledgment [that the Ilulissat Declaration is no
longer operative]{.mark} [may mark a turning point in]{.mark} how [the
region]{.mark} navigates defense, diplomacy, and sovereignty in the
years ahead]{.underline}.

### AT China NB

#### The Arctic Council is ineffective post-Ukraine, but China uses a functional Council to gain influence in the region

Luke **Coffey** 20**25**, a senior fellow at Hudson Institute. His work
at Hudson analyzes national security and foreign policy, with a focus on
Europe, Eurasia, NATO, and transatlantic relations, 5/16/2025, "How a
Big Freeze Descended on the Arctic Council", Hudson Institute,
https://www.hudson.org/international-organizations/how-big-freeze-descended-arctic-council-luke-coffey

[The [invasion of Ukraine]{.mark} by Russia in February 2022
[shattered]{.mark}]{.underline} many channels of cooperation between
Moscow and the West, including [[the Arctic
Council]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although Russia handed over the
chairmanship to Norway in May of that year, the customary fanfare was
noticeably absent. [Over the past two years Norway has tried to keep the
council afloat, but the **[breakdown in relations with Russia rendered
it]{.mark}** largely **[ineffective]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[By]{.underline}]{.mark} the time Norway passed the [[chairmanship to
Denmark]{.mark}, [the best that could be said was]{.mark} that [the
council still existed]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Complicating matters further are suggestions by Trump that the US might
seek to annex Greenland and an unwillingness to rule out military force
to do so, which have alarmed NATO allies and unsettled the Arctic
Council's delicate balance. That may explain why it was Greenland's
foreign minister, rather than a Danish official, who accepted the
chairmanship on Denmark's behalf. How this tension between the US and
Denmark plays out within the council remains to be seen, but it will not
make cooperation any easier.

[With the [council **unable** to conduct substantial work]{.mark}, its
immediate goal is simply to survive]{.underline}. Should a ceasefire or
peace agreement be reached in Ukraine, some might push to quickly
[[revive the council]{.mark}, but they [would face serious
headwinds]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Since 2022, [the Arctic security
landscape has changed profoundly]{.mark}. Norway's newly released
national security strategy describes its situation as "the most serious
\... our country has faced since the Second World War]{.underline}."

What happens in the Arctic is often shaped by geopolitical currents
elsewhere, and increasingly what happens in the Arctic has consequences
across the globe.

Finland and Sweden, previously militarily non-aligned, have joined NATO,
placing seven of the eight Arctic states under the same security
umbrella. Their accession to the alliance would have been unimaginable
before Russia's invasion. The new Canadian government is expanding its
presence in the Arctic, for geopolitical reasons that are unlikely to
disappear anytime soon: [Russia's actions in [Ukraine]{.mark} have [left
deep scars]{.mark}.]{.underline}

This evolving environment also affects non-Arctic states seeking a
larger role in the region. [[China]{.mark}, for example, [has
been]{.mark} one of the [major loser]{.mark}s [of the Arctic Council's
dysfunction]{.mark}. [Beijing used the forum to **expand influence** in
polar affairs]{.mark}. With the council no longer functioning as it once
did, [China has lost a **key international venue**]{.mark}. [In
response]{.mark}, [Russia and China have deepened]{.mark} their
[cooperation in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly on energy
and infrastructure projects, driven partly by Western sanctions.

[**[If the Arctic Council does]{.mark}** eventually **[resume full
operations, expect China to re-engage quickly]{.mark}** to regain lost
ground]{.underline}.

### AC Collapse Inev \-\-- Russia

#### Russia is a [destabilizing]{.underline} actor in the Arctic and globally---that spills down to [council]{.underline} collapse, not the [other way]{.underline}.

**Martel '24** \[Quentin Martel, 10-4-2024, \"The Arctic, a Geographical
Region Beset by Geopolitical Tensions with Russia\", Network for
Strategic Analysis (NSA),
https://ras-nsa.ca/the-arctic-a-geographical-region-beset-by-geopolitical-tensions-with-russia/\]

[[Geopolitical tensions]{.mark} linked to the Arctic have [developed as
a result of Russia's **hostile** **attitude**]{.mark} in the
region.]{.underline} The war in Ukraine has played an important role in
accentuating this crisis. For several years, [[Russia has
**intensified** the **militarization**]{.mark} of its Arctic
territory]{.underline}, raising concerns about its intentions in the Far
North. [This has [led to an **escalation** of tensions]{.mark} with
other countries in the region]{.underline}, such as Canada, the United
States, and several European countries, who are concerned about this
military build-up. However, these diplomatic tensions over the Arctic
are nothing new. The region has already been the scene of similar
confrontations.

In particular, the political and military tensions of the Cold War seem
to be repeating themselves in our own time. What distinguishes today's
situation from that of the Cold War is the interests at stake: today,
they are primarily strategic, economic, and military, rather than
ideological. The Arctic is an economically important region for Russia,
the USA and Canada, as well as for several European countries such as
Finland, Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. The Canadian Arctic Archipelago,
which accounts for 40% of the country's territory, is a major strategic
area for the country. It borders Russia, which claims part of the Arctic
Sea as part of its internal waters, justifying this position by its
attachment to the Siberian Islands. This region of the world has been
the scene of diplomatic tensions for many years, compounded by global
warming, which is a key factor in the area's environmental and political
degradation.

These recent tensions between Arctic countries have led Canada to
recognize the need to modernize its capabilities in the region, in
response to the political and military stakes exacerbated by the
conflict in Ukraine. It is crucial to understand why Canada is reviewing
its Arctic policy strategy, and to examine what is at stake.

The aim of this policy brief is to demonstrate that the Arctic region is
undergoing a major geopolitical shift, threatening the area's political
stability. Added to this vision is [the idea of a [**hybrid war**,
combining **military** and **non-military** means]{.mark}.
Misinformation and foreign interference seem to be the new weapons of
this hybrid war, **[propagated by
Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} they can have [[a significant
impact on the stability of the Arctic region]{.underline}]{.mark}. For
this reason, Canada must adopt a defense policy that is adapted to a
Russia that is militarizing and not hesitating to use non-military
means to impose its influence around the world.

The Arctic: a geographical zone beset by diplomatic tensions

[Geopolitical tensions and the Arctic's vulnerability to global warming
make it a [difficult region to control]{.mark}]{.underline}. Far from
being spared political disagreements between the major powers, the
region has [[seen **diplomatic** **tensions** intensify]{.mark} since
the start of the war in Ukraine]{.underline}. This has had an [[impact
on the **functioning** of the Arctic **Council**]{.underline}]{.mark},
which has been considerably slowed down by its members, who see Russian
action in Ukraine as a violation of international law and a threat to
the global stability the Council strives to maintain.

Global warming is both a threat and an opportunity for the major powers.
This paradox now opens up access to areas of exploitation previously
inaccessible due to ice. The region, rich in natural resources such as
coal, iron, gold, and uranium, as well as oil and natural gas deposits,
is therefore subject to an increase in industrial installations. It is
estimated that around 30% of the world's oil reserves are located in the
Arctic, a fact that is attracting the interest of the major powers. Some
countries consider that environmental protection is essential and that
the region must be protected from human action, while others see it as
an opportunity for economic and military development. Such is the case
of Russia, which is stepping up its military presence, justifying this
stance by its desire to develop its Arctic territory, while defending
the integrity of its borders against the effects of global warming and
foreign interference. This scramble for the region's resources has
created a climate comparable to that of the Cold War, characterized by
diplomatic tensions, claims to the ocean floor and the allocation of
undersea resources. This climate of tension evokes the event of 2007,
when Russia planted a flag on the bottom of the Arctic Ocean, claiming
sovereignty over the seabed. An image perceived as a political maneuver
on Moscow's part. Russia's rise to power in the Arctic

[[The war in Ukraine has profoundly **altered** the global geostrategic
**order**]{.mark}, plunging the world into an uncertain future, while
redefining the diplomatic chessboard in the Arctic]{.underline} region.
In particular, the [[adoption of **sanctions** against Russia by the
member countries of the **Arctic** **Council**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
response to these new dynamics, [[Arctic countries are seeking to
strengthen their **military** **budgets**]{.mark} in order to ensure
their regional security and adapt to increased geopolitical
stakes]{.underline}. This is what Norway and Denmark report.  They
explain, however, that an armed conflict is unlikely, but that a hybrid
war is conceivable given Russia's attitude in the region. The
international context unfolding before our eyes is leading the major
powers into a competition in which the Arctic will be at the heart of
discussions. Canadian and American intelligence reports point to new
military bases and assets in the Russian-controlled zone.

This militarization is nothing new, however, as [[Moscow has already
indicated its desire to **increase** its **presence**]{.mark} in this
part of the world]{.underline}. The country seems to be [[carrying out
numerous **military** **exercises** in the region, such as firing
**ballistic** **missiles** into]{.mark} the [Barent]{.mark}s
Sea]{.underline}. [A **warning** sent out by Moscow [to demonstrate its
**superiority** and reaffirm its desire to monitor]{.mark} this part of
the world.]{.underline} Added to this is a feeling of encirclement
following the accession of several Arctic countries to NATO. Russia's
changing attitude is prompting Canada to reassess its military-strategic
stakes in the region, in order to ensure the protection and defense of
its Arctic archipelago.

[The era of war in Ukraine has opened a new door to the use of
**disinformation** to influence foreign populations]{.underline}.
Although disinformation campaigns, integrated into the [concept of
**hybrid** **warfare**,]{.underline} have become a crucial factor in
national defense and population protection, it is important to qualify
them. These campaigns are used to provoke debate within national
politics, exacerbate social cleavages or sow mistrust in a government.
They can also disrupt a country's democratic process. The aim is to
disseminate totally or partially erroneous information, via uncontrolled
channels or social networks, targeting specific criteria that will have
a moderate impact on national security or public opinion. Used for
propaganda purposes, it can be a relatively effective weapon.  Russia
seems to be adept at these methods, which cannot be associated with any
one country, as they are difficult to detect and attribute, risking
diplomatic tensions. However, several reports document the use of
disinformation during Russia's annexation of Crimea. As far as the
Arctic is concerned, Russian disinformation could harm Canadian
interests, by creating discord in public opinion or influencing markets
beneficial to the Russians. This approach is mentioned in Whitney
Lackenbauer's policy brief.

Climate Change

[[**Climate** **change**]{.mark} policies represent one of the [most
visible **policy divides**]{.mark}]{.underline} between the Democratic
and Republican parties in the US, [[especially after Trump became the
dominant voice]{.mark}]{.underline} in the latter. Prior to becoming a
presidential candidate, [Trump had [derided **climate** **change** as a
**fiction**]{.mark}, framing efforts to curb carbon emissions as
directly contrary to US political and economic interests]{.underline}.
During his first term in the White House, his administration overturned
several domestic environmental rules and protocols and pulled the United
States out of the 2016 Paris Climate Agreement. His [[administration
**derailed** the **Arctic** **Council**'s
now-notorious]{.underline}]{.mark} May 2019 [[Ministerial
meeting]{.underline}]{.mark} in Rovaniemi when the American delegation
[[refused to support any joint declaration]{.mark} [which even mentioned
climate change]{.mark}]{.underline}, leading to the first occasion when
the body failed to release a joint declaration. (Secretary of State Mike
[[Pompeo's "verbal **thunderstorm**]{.underline}]{.mark}" against
Canada, China, and Russia also made the event particularly memorable.)

President Joe Biden attempted to reverse these policies, bringing the US
back to the Paris Agreement upon assuming office in 2021 and making
climate change one of four pillars in his administration's Arctic
policies announced in October 2022 (along with security, sustainable
development and regional and international cooperation). But signs have
already appeared that President-elect [Trump is again seeking to push
forward a denial policy, including [removing the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates [from the **Paris** agreement]{.mark}]{.underline}
again and [[pursuing a fossil fuel centred energy
policy]{.underline}]{.mark} ("drill, baby, drill") while [[downgrading
clean energy]{.mark} policies]{.underline}. The incoming government
could also pull the US out of the 1992 United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which would further ostracize
Washington from global climate change dialogues and likely also diminish
American policy voices in the Arctic.

[Alaska]{.underline}, which voted solidly for Trump in this election, is
[likely to be another environmental front line, especially over oil and
gas drilling]{.underline}. After the first [Trump government [sought to
open up protected areas in the **A**rctic]{.mark} **N**ational
**W**ildlife **R**efuge [to fossil fuel extraction]{.mark}]{.underline}.
In early November 2024 the Biden administration started taking steps to
'Trump-proof' the refuge by complicating any attempts by the next
government to open up drilling projects there. In response, the State of
Alaska has filed a federal lawsuit against the Biden administration for
what it calls violations of a congressional directive to allow oil and
gas development in a portion of the federal Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge (ANWR).

### Arctic Council Dead

**The Arctic Council is dead\-\--working groups don't matter**

**Bhagwat & Bisen \'25** (Jawahar -- Associate Professor @ Northern
(Arctic) Federal University, & Anurag -- Senior Research Fellow @
Vivekananda International Foundation, \"India and The Arctic States\",

https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-76124-9_4//phs-maubu)

[The Arctic Council is a multilateral high-level forum formally
established]{.underline} in 1996, through the Ottawa Declaration, signed
by eight countries: United States, Russia, Norway, Sweden, Denmark,
Iceland, Canada and Finland. These countries are seen as "member states"
in the Arctic Council. The structure is three-tiered, and in addition to
the member states, the Arctic Council is made up of permanent
participants, i.e. indigenous communities and observer members. The main
purpose of the Arctic Council is "promoting cooperation, coordination
and interaction among the Arctic states, Arctic Indigenous communities
and other Arctic inhabitants on common Arctic issues, in particular on
issues of sustainable development and environmental protection in the
Arctic (AC, 2024)." [The Arctic Council is not a legal body that can
implement policies]{.underline}, but an intergovernmental high-level
forum, which provides guidelines and proposals for policies to be
followed by the member states (AC, 2024).

[[The Arctic Council]{.mark} virtually [stopped functioning
after]{.mark} the commencement of the [Ukraine]{.mark}
conflict]{.underline}, with its seven Members' joint statements on March
3 and June 8, 2022. [[Its future seems]{.mark} to be [bleak even
though]{.mark} the current chair [Norway has restored some working
groups]{.mark}]{.underline} including Russia reportedly functioning in a
truncated manner. According to some researchers, most Arctic
treaty-based cooperative frameworks continue to function in some form or
another. [They argue that even though [Russia's actions]{.mark} in
Ukraine [are contrary to international law]{.mark} had the Arctic
Council been a treaty-based framework, terminating or suspending the
operation of a cooperative framework established by a treaty regarding
Russia would require legal justifications in conformity with the
relevant rules of international law]{.underline} (Koivurova and Shibata,
2023). Many Western researchers are of the view that **[[Arctic
exceptionalism is over]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This opinion is shared by
a few Russian researchers who have pointed out that the Arctic Council
continued to functioning even after the US invasion of Iraq though it
did not have the approval of the UN Security Council and the support of
Russia. According to them, this is a deliberate move by Washington to
isolate Russia in the Arctic Council. [It is therefore inferred that at
least in the near-term [the]{.mark} normal [functioning of the Arctic
Council is **unlikely to get revived**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### Arctic Council Fails

#### **The Arctic Council [structurally]{.underline} fails---funding, bureaucracy, and lack of trust.**

**Cui '23** \[Zheng Cui, 11-16-2023, \"How an "Observer Plus" Club Could
Strengthen the Arctic Council's Governance --- The Fletcher Forum of
World Affairs\", Fletcher Forum of World Affairs,
https://www.fletcherforum.org/the-rostrum/23/11/15/how-an-observer-plus-club-could-strengthen-the-arctic-councils-governance\]

The [Arctic [Council is currently facing two **critical**
**challenges**]{.mark}]{.underline} that converge to offer the platform
a timely opportunity to address foundational concerns. First, [the
council faces continued [**funding** challenges]{.mark} from
[**overstretched** resources]{.mark}]{.underline} and [[**inefficient**
**bureaucratic** structures]{.underline}]{.mark}. Second, non-Arctic
states and actors are expressing growing interest in the Arctic and
challenging the council's exclusivity. To meet the Arctic Council's
financial and geopolitical needs, the council should implement a new
concept based on the existing observer mechanism: the Observers Plus
Club (OP Club). The OP Club would increase funding for the council's
projects while bridging the gap between Arctic and non-Arctic entities.

THE ARCTIC COUNCIL'S CHALLENGES

The Arctic Council includes eight Arctic states (Canada, Denmark,
Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United States), six
permanent participants representing Indigenous groups, and a plethora of
global observers. However, even with such robust membership, [the Arctic
Council lacks [the stable funding to plan, implement, and
monitor]{.mark} its projects. [Inadequate and inconsistent **funding**
poses **systematic** **challenges**]{.mark} that [hampers the
practicality of the Arctic Council]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Arctic
Council [has [no **programming** **budgets**]{.mark}, with [projects
funded **ad hoc** by the states]{.mark} who advocated for
them]{.underline}. The Secretariat is funded equally by all member
states of the Arctic Council, except for Norway, which sponsors half of
the Secretariat's budget as the host country. While the Secretariat
enjoys stable finances, [[fluctuations in project-based funds
**hinder**]{.mark} both [short-term and long-term program
planning]{.mark}]{.underline}. In addition, the number of projects that
the Arctic Council undertakes has increased dramatically since its
creation in 1996, further stretching the already thin budget. 

[[Efforts to address]{.mark} this problem [have been
**unsuccessful**]{.mark}]{.underline}. During the [**[U]{.mark}**nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates' [2015]{.mark}-2017 chairmanship]{.underline}, the
Secretariat asked for a comprehensive review and categorization of the
funding sources. The [[Algu Fund]{.mark}, established [in
2017]{.mark}]{.underline}, aimed to provide stable and long-term funding
for Indigenous groups who are permanent participants in the Arctic
Council. However, reforms related to working group finances have [[yet
to materialize]{.underline}]{.mark}, leaving many [[initiatives
grappling with financial uncertainty]{.mark}.]{.underline}

A separate problem is that the Arctic Council [[lacks fully developed
mech]{.mark}anisms [for non-Arctic entities to participate]{.mark} in
the region]{.underline}. As one of, if not the most, important platforms
for Arctic governance, the Arctic Council includes several diverse
actors. The current make-up of observers includes non-Arctic states,
intergovernmental organizations, and non-governmental organizations. As
of now, Observers must find an Arctic state or an Indigenous permanent
participant to co-propose new projects to the Arctic Council. This
greatly [[limits the growing interest in the Arctic]{.mark} by Observer
countries]{.underline}. In addition, Observers are only allowed to
sponsor Arctic Council projects at levels no greater than the
contribution of the project\'s host country. 

While the current structure ensures the dominant position of the Arctic
states in the Arctic Council, it significantly limits the potential of
the Observers. With economically powerful non-Arctic nations like the
People's Republic of China (PRC), Japan, and South Korea demonstrating
increased interest in Arctic governance, the current Arctic Council
structure fails to provide participation pathways that non-Arctic
nations desire. INTRODUCING THE OBSERVERS' PLUS CLUB The Arctic Council
has a unique opportunity to tackle two problems at once by linking the
desire of non-Arctic entities to participate with the need for increased
funding. Building on the existing model of Observers serving as norm
entrepreneurs in Arctic governance, the Arctic Council should develop an
Observers' Plus Club (OP Club), which would require members to
financially commit to sponsoring working group projects and providing
funding for the permanent participants. In exchange, OP Club members
would have the ability to independently bring Arctic-related issues for
discussion and propose new projects. Observers demonstrating interest
would be put into \"candidacy" status, thereby removing the current
limitations for financial contribution and giving the power to propose
new projects within the working groups. The Arctic countries would then
have three years to examine and evaluate the intentions and potential
impact of a candidate. Subsequently, a two-thirds majority vote would be
required to officially induct the Observer to the OP club. The
two-thirds majority vote ensures a fair majority without creating
impossible barriers for collective decision-making. The Secretariat
would review existing members of the Observer Plus Club every three
years. Criteria for evaluation might include demonstrating a strong
interest in the wellbeing of the Arctic, willingness to promote and
engage in different sustainable agendas, and establishing accountable
commitments to Arctic governance and development. States that do not
consistently deliver satisfactory outcomes, as assessed by Arctic
countries, would receive a warning, constraints on participation, and
eventual removal from the club, with each stage given a one-year period
before moving to the next. The advantages of this framework are
numerous. By enabling non-Arctic states to financially contribute and
propose projects, the OP Club could significantly bolster the Council\'s
project funding, allowing for a more diverse range of initiatives and
enhancing the Council\'s capacity for environmental protection and
sustainable development. Moreover, this model would provide a balanced
approach to inclusivity, empowering non-Arctic entities to participate
in Arctic governance while maintaining the centrality of Arctic states
and indigenous peoples. The review process for candidacy and membership
ensures that only genuinely committed entities are involved, with the
periodic review fostering ongoing accountability. The OP Club model
establishes a framework to link the economic needs of the Arctic Council
with the political needs of the non-Arctic nations. It is also important
to acknowledge that the Arctic Council nations are some of the
wealthiest in the world, bringing into question why monetary incentives
would be attractive. Three of the eight Arctic nations (the United
States, Norway, and Denmark) rank in the world's top ten wealthiest
states, as measured by GDP per capita. Economic incentives and capital
alone will not be sufficient to attract support. Luckily, the OP model
also has political and strategic implications. If the Arctic Council
fails, like the League of Nations or the International Refugee
Organization, there is no guarantee of the power distribution in the
next governance regime. By allowing more non-Arctic nations\'
involvement, the Arctic Council can increase its legitimacy as it builds
itself to be the most inclusive and efficient multilateral cooperation
platform for Arctic governance, with the Arctic nations at its helm.
Strategically, demonstrating the inclusiveness of Arctic governance
would encourage more nations to be involved in the region, further
strengthening a collaborative environment where shared interests in
scientific research, sustainable development, and indigenous rights can
be pursued. Lastly, Arctic nations that are concerned about their
diminishing influence can rest on the difference between agenda-setting
and voting rights. While members of the OP Club can propose a limited
number of agenda items, the club does not give its members voting
rights. 

In October 2022, the PRC's Special Envoy to the Arctic Feng Gao
announced that the PRC would not recognize the Arctic Council without
Russia\'s participation. In May 2023, Norway assumed the chairmanship
from Russia. While Norway has demonstrated its ability to foster a
smooth transition [[amid the political **tensions**]{.mark} between
Russia and the West, future [cooperation remains **difficult** due to
the lack of **trust** among Arctic nations]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
Observer Plus model provides a way to build a more effective and
impactful Arctic Council that will be the backbone of Arctic
international cooperation. With proper monitoring and management, this
model could lay the foundation for a more effective, inclusive, and
responsible Arctic governance regime.

There is no doubt that the Arctic Council is an important --- probably
the most important --- intergovernmental forum in the Arctic region.
[But it is facile to suggest that all Arctic affairs can or should fall
within its mandate. [The Arctic Council has real structural and
organizational limitations]{.mark}.]{.underline} As regional governance
gets more complex, additional forums should be welcomed --- or as many
already exist, recognized --- for the role they play in effectively
governing the Arctic.

The Nature of Arctic Governance

Perhaps it is anticipated that most international relations theorists
and government diplomats would see the Arctic region primarily through a
lens of state-to-state cooperation (with the inclusion of indigenous
peoples identified as a welcome novelty). Doing so naturally highlights
the centrality of the Arctic Council. But a trend is emerging that, on
the one hand, sees the Arctic Council as much more powerful than it is
in practice; and on the other hand, diminishes the role that other fora
play.

Limitations of the Arctic Council

Commentators sometimes depict the Council as a catch-all for Arctic
issues, when in fact it was established with a very circumscribed
mandate: [[the Arctic Council]{.mark} deals with issues of environmental
protection and sustainable development. Amongst other things that
regional organizations typically address, this [excludes trade, security
and immigration]{.mark}. And [while]{.mark} [sustainable development has
been painted with a wide brush in the Arctic, the Council's work in that
regard has been extremely limited]{.mark}]{.underline}, though arguably
useful and appropriate, dealing mainly with research syntheses and best
practices on issues such as suicide prevention, cancer incidence and
promoting indigenous languages. [[The]{.mark} [A]{.mark}rctic
[C]{.mark}ouncil [has no mandate or funding to devise policy nor
implement programming in]{.mark} the [key areas]{.mark} of health,
education and infrastructure.]{.underline}

[In addition to the narrow mandate, [the structure of the Arctic Council
imposes limitations]{.mark}. [It is]{.mark} [technically a forum and not
a treaty-based organization. It has no legal character, meaning it has
no mandate to enact or enforce agreements or
regulations]{.mark}]{.underline}; the Search and Rescue (2011) and
Marine Oil Pollution, Preparedness and Response (2013)
[Agreements]{.underline}, for example, [were concluded under its
auspices, but not within the Arctic Council.]{.underline}

In recent years, the Council has been equipped with a permanent
secretariat, however it provides mainly administrative functions and is
not an executive body. [[The]{.mark} [A]{.mark}rctic [C]{.mark}ouncil
[is managed by a two-year rotating chairmanship]{.mark}, with the chair
given the right and responsibility to set the agenda and host
meetings]{.underline}. While many agree this format provides momentum to
the Arctic Council, it does, at the same time, mean agendas are often
reflective of the chair's domestic priorities, [it [means that goals are
often pursued on a short-term basis, and that there can be discontinuity
between chairmanship agendas]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Funding is also inconsistent]{.mark}, with a limited defined
contribution from all Arctic states]{.underline} (Canada, Denmark,
Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and United States) to fund
secretariat activities (US\$106,418 per annum, though Norway, as host,
contributes significantly more). Programmatic and working group funding
are often in-kind and/or ad hoc, depending on states' particular
interests and objectives. [[The level of Arctic Council funding is not
such that it can implement policy or programming outside of the
parameters of other levels of governance]{.mark}, even if states were
amenable to such a role.]{.underline}

[Scientific and technological [cooperation between Beijing and Moscow in
the Arctic]{.mark}---and beyond---[has]{.mark} significantly [evolved in
the last decade, as both countries' relationships with the United States
and other NATO members have become increasingly tense]{.mark}. Russia's
initial economic and political isolation in the aftermath of its 2014
annexation of Crimea and the acceleration of that isolation following
the full-scale invasion of eastern Ukraine in 2022 has made cooperation
with the PRC more attractive. At the same time, a growing wariness of
Chinese strategic ambitions, coercive economic tactics, and focus on
dual-use technologies, has slowed Beijing's efforts to advance economic
and scientific collaboration with NATO Arctic powers. [With other
avenues of Arctic engagement restricted, Moscow now offers Beijing the
best pathway to further its Arctic interests]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Greater [strategic and economic alignment between the two
powers]{.mark}, driven]{.underline} by Russian President Vladimir Putin
and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, [[is fueled by scientific
collaboration]{.underline}]{.mark}. While efforts to better understand
and mitigate climate effects have served as important justifications for
Beijing's inclusion in Arctic scientific and multilateral forums, and
are cited as evidence for the need to resume international collaboration
with Moscow, [[climate mitigation actually holds little interest for
Putin and Xi]{.mark} who view the Arctic primarily through the strategic
lens of national and economic security]{.underline}. Academic
institutions from both countries have launched joint research
initiatives on climate-relevant topics such as water ecology and
permafrost (two issues that have direct implications on Chinese and
Russian societies), but these efforts largely serve to preserve regime
stability.

Arctic scientific cooperation between the PRC and Russia has evolved
from commercial applications to facilitate shipping and navigation along
the NSR to a more geological focus with relevance for dual-use
capabilities in space and in the deep sea. [[The PRC's]{.mark} MCF
[strategy]{.mark} and the involvement of institutions associated with
the PLA [make it likely that scientific data collected during Arctic
missions helps inform Chinese military interests in that region]{.mark}
and research and development efforts in Beijing's [and Moscow's broader
defense sectors]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Nonetheless, as outlined in GMF's previous paper in this series, [some
[limits on this evolving partnership]{.mark} continue.]{.underline}
Beijing's third polar-capable vessel, for example, will be
conventionally powered, despite previous plans by the PRC and Russia to
collaborate on a nuclear-powered icebreaker, which would have relied on
existing Russian technology. Beijing's long-standing skepticism of
relying on Russian technology, and Moscow's long-standing skepticism of
sharing it, may persist.67 [But the limits [may be beginning to erode,
which suggests a growing level of trust]{.mark} and pragmatic scientific
engagement [that could deepen over time]{.mark}]{.underline}.

As in other domains, Beijing and Moscow continue to seek to diversify
their partnerships and balance their growing bilateral cooperation and
trade relationships through engagement with others. [[Russia has
recently]{.mark} [increased its courtship of]{.mark} other "friendly
powers", including other [BRICS]{.mark}+ countries.]{.underline} The
PRC, to facilitate broader engagement in the Arctic and develop its
Polar Silk Road---which relies on access to ports, airfields, and
communication and data centers along the route---is eager to continue
its political and economic engagement with other Arctic powers. Beijing
also seeks to portray itself as a responsible power, but its increased
rhetorical support68 of Moscow and its tangible support for Russia's war
economy has begun to cross a threshold that may force the United States
and its NATO partners to respond to PRC actions more forcefully.

[[Collaboration in]{.mark} the field of international scientific
research and [science diplomacy in and around the Arctic Council]{.mark}
and other international forums [remains one of Beijing's and Moscow's
last avenue]{.mark}s [to advance cooperation]{.mark} with other Arctic
powers and reduce Russia's international isolation.]{.underline} This is
consistent with Western countries' desire to keep open channels with
both capitals. But caution and awareness are necessary as [[both use
these avenues to support their interests, not international
collaboration]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### The Arctic Council won't succeed -- Trump means collapse is inevitable.

Future of Arctic Power Politics"
https://thegeopolitics.com/polar-realignment-trump-putin-and-the-future-of-arctic-power-politics/)

[[End of]{.mark} Circumpolar [Consensus]{.mark}?]{.underline}

[[The Arctic Council]{.underline}]{.mark}, established in 1996 to
coordinate peaceful cooperation among Arctic states (A8), [now [stands
at a **critical** juncture]{.mark}]{.underline}. Russia's 2022 invasion
of Ukraine already suspended much of its work. Now, [[with
Trump's]{.mark} possible [withdrawal from]{.mark} international
[institutions, the]{.mark} very [foundation of]{.mark} circumpolar
[cooperation is at risk]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[This]{.mark} emerging [U.S.-Russia rapprochement]{.mark} could [render
the Arctic Council obsolete, marginalize]{.mark} smaller [Arctic
nations]{.mark}, and [destabilize]{.mark} existing legal
[frameworks]{.mark} like the Central Arctic Ocean fisheries agreement
and the Spitsbergen Treaty. [The result]{.mark} could be [a **new Arctic
order**, ]{.mark}]{.underline}governed not by collective interests and
environmental norms but [[by **hard power** politics and economic
**extraction**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Europe]{.mark}, especially Denmark and Norway, [risks being
sidelined]{.mark}. If [Trump]{.mark}]{.underline} supports a revision of
the Spitsbergen Treaty or pushes forward on Greenland, it would
[[fragment existing Arctic legal architecture]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[Indigenous communities]{.underline}---often champions of environmental
stewardship and cultural autonomy---[may find their voices drowned in a
race for resources.]{.underline}

[Meanwhile, [climate]{.mark} science [and biodiversity
preservation]{.mark}---hallmarks of previous Arctic cooperation---are
likely to be [**casualties** of]{.mark} a transactional
[geopolitics]{.mark} that privileges fossil fuel extraction over
environmental integrity. [As Arctic ice melts]{.mark} and new shipping
lanes open[, the region will become a **new**]{.mark} **[axis of
rivalry]{.mark}** and contestation.]{.underline}

### No Enforcement

#### The Arctic Council's "soft law" doesn't do anything.

Secondly, while [[the Arctic Council]{.underline}]{.mark} has
facilitated substantive cooperation among Arctic nations and established
itself as a core component of Arctic governance, it [[faces]{.mark}
significant **[limitations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As Arctic affairs
become increasingly complex, these [[deficiencies hinder]{.mark} its
[effectiveness]{.mark}]{.underline}. According to the 1996 Ottawa
Declaration, the Arctic Council's primary mission is to promote
sustainable development and environmental protection \[35\]. However,
[it [lacks]{.mark} legislative and **[enforcement powers]{.mark}**,
which [prevents]{.mark} it from [addressing **core issues** such as
security]{.mark}, fisheries, and energy]{.underline}. Additionally, its
[[resolutions are]{.mark} primarily "[soft]{.mark} measures," [lacking
**binding force** and]{.mark} effective [oversight]{.mark}]{.underline}.
In March 2022, the other seven Arctic states ([Arctic 7, [A7), excluding
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}, issued a joint statement announcing that
they would no longer send representatives to Arctic Council meetings in
Russia and would suspend attendance at all meetings of the Council and
its subsidiary bodies \[36\]. This led to [a [standstill]{.mark} in
Arctic Council cooperation [with no]{.mark} immediate [prospects for
resolution]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus, the current Arctic governance
mechanisms are predominantly characterized by "[[soft" features]{.mark}
and lack binding force, [making it]{.mark} **[challenging to address
conflicts]{.mark}**]{.underline} and disagreements among countries in
various Arctic domains.

### Multilat Bad \-\-- China Influence

#### Multilateralism in the Arctic is weaponized and only increases China's influence

complex\", 2022, Asian Security, Volume 18, Issue 2,
https://doi.org/10.1080/14799855.2021.1986008//phs-maubu)

This article has reviewed [China's evolving interests in the Arctic and
how it pursues them]{.underline}, as a nonArctic state and as a great
power with expanding interests. Specifically, we reviewed
[[China's]{.mark} approach to [pursuing its interests in]{.mark} the
areas of [navigation]{.mark}, [resource]{.mark} extraction, [and
scientific]{.mark} [advancement]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[China]{.mark}
combines [use]{.mark} of both the [global]{.mark} and regional
[institutions within the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}** "regime complex"
in questions related to navigation, resource extraction and scientific
advancement, along with bilateral cooperation. [[China has not
prioritized military-strategic interests]{.underline}]{.mark}, but its
current level of cooperation would provide a basis for which to pursue
these in the future, if they became more salient.

Thus, **[[China pursues its interests through]{.mark} a mixture of
bilateral and [multilateral engagements]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
[[working within the existing]{.mark} regime [complexes]{.mark},
[participating in developing]{.mark} these, but also attempting [to
influence them]{.mark} from without, [by developing new projects and
partnerships]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[China's behavior]{.mark} [may
qualify as revisionism]{.mark} in the sense that it does seek to revise
existing regime complexes with a view to enhance Chinese interests, [but
this **revisionism is not pursued as a unilateral
effort**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Instead, China couples on to the agendas
of multilateral institutions and individual countries or groupings with
whom it has common interests in particular issue areas. Moreover, China
is careful to take into account the common interests that are inherent
in the existing regime complexes when pursuing its interests. Chinese
revisionism in the Arctic is then of a kind that looks for incremental
change on the basis of cooperation with likeminded states and with
respect for rules and norms that enjoy regionwide support. This
sophisticated incremental revisionism allows China to pursue its
interests while minimizing its involvement in regional conflicts.

The general picture is that China pursues its interests with a view to
enhance its image as a great power that takes into account the common
interests of other international actors in the Arctic so as to avoid
becoming entangled in local rivalries to the detriment of Chinese Arctic
interests. [[China]{.mark} thus [engages]{.mark} all Arctic and
non-Arctic [actors with]{.mark} regional [interests]{.mark} [and
avoids]{.mark} becoming wedded to unilateral [agendas that]{.mark} might
[distort China's image]{.mark} as an engaged but nonpartisan actor in
the Arctic]{.underline}. China is particularly careful not to form an
entente with Russia in the Arctic to keep at arm's length Moscow's
geopolitical rivalry with the United States and NATO in a region that is
still peripheral to Chinese interests.

The links between China's behavior in the Arctic and in the South China
Sea illustrates several elements of China's Arctic approach. In the
Arctic, Chinese maneuvering to downplay its geopolitical role while
investing in strategic resources such as rare earths and research
stations allow China to prepare for a future of regional great power
rivalry without a permanent military footprint. This contrasts with
China's growing physical and military presence in the South China Sea by
means of land reclamation and militarization, as does its long-standing
restrictions on innocent passage in the territorial sea and marine
scientific research (defined to include military surveys) in the EEZ.
The reason for this difference is that China views the South China Sea
as its immediate periphery and likely site of confrontation with the
United States over regional hegemony. By contrast, the Arctic is at the
periphery of this competition. This allows China to position itself
strategically in the Arctic, preparing for a future where the Arctic may
have moved to the top of China's agenda

The regime complex literature in combination with Bull\'s observations
on great power pre-ferences and Drezner's observations on great power
influence and regime complexity is useful for understanding that China's
pursuit of its interests is not merely an individual cost-benefit
calculation designed to extract resources to benefit China's economic
development and put in place the preconditions for a future permanent
presence. These elements form significant parts of Chinese policies in
the Arctic. However, the regime complex literature identifies the
complex web of institutional rules and agendas that any state pursuing
extra-regional interests faces, explaining that China has to pursue its
interests within this setting and support its procedures and normative
foundations if it wants to pursue its interests. As a result, China
takes on interests that it would not otherwise have considered. China's
support for a moratorium on fisheries in the high seas of the Arctic in
return for acceptance of the rights of non-Arctic states to conduct
science research in the region is a case in point. Another example is
China's notification of Canada and Russia when sailing through the
Northwest and Northern Sea Route, despite its potential conflict with
its South China Sea claims. The complexity of regional settings does not
allow even great powers to have simple, universally applicable policies
and principles. They have to adjust these to regional circumstances and
live with the contradictions and double standards that may result from
differentiated engagements.

The regime complex and great power reading of China's role in the Arctic
highlights the advantages that accrue to China when it makes common
interests the basis for its pursuit of national interests. This strategy
facilitates acceptance of its position as a non-Arctic state with a
legitimate presence and reduces its involvement in geopolitical rivalry
that is likely to prove counterproductive to China's Arctic interests.
It also explains why China shows little interest in aligning too closely
with Russia. Although Moscow is Beijing's principal regional partner,
Beijing seeks to engage with a broad range of Arctic, European, American
and Asian intra-regional and extra-regional actors, balancing Western,
Eastern and local cooperation.

The regime complex and great power approach to [China's influence in the
Arctic highlights the complexity involved in any cooperative effort in
international relations with the omnipresent institutio-nalization of
all issue areas]{.underline}. This research tentatively demonstrates
that great powers such as **[[China]{.mark} are able to [utilize
institutional complexity to their advantage]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Great powers can rearrange linkages between issue areas, for example
coupling military-strategic interests with scientific advancement. They
can also engage in regimes that facilitate future opportunities for
pursuing strategic interests rather than meet immediate demands, such as
the fisheries regime in the Central Arctic Ocean. [Perhaps most
importantly, [great powers]{.mark} are able to [reshape]{.mark} regime
[agendas to]{.mark} better [reflect their interests]{.mark}
[while]{.mark} nurturing an image of [looking after the]{.mark}
interests of the [international community]{.mark}, for example by
financing environmental and climate research while at the same time
pursuing strategic advantages]{.underline}. As strategic great power
competition takes off, [[this]{.mark} Janus-faced [approach]{.mark} to
international cooperation [is likely to gain
ground]{.mark}.]{.underline}

### China Leadership Good

#### **Chinese Arctic leadership [stabilizes]{.underline} and [connects]{.underline} the region.**

China's Engagement," China-Nordic Arctic Research Center,

[China is defining itself as an important stakeholder in Arctic affairs
and geographically a \"**[Near-Arctic State]{.mark}**\"]{.underline},
one of the continental States that are closest to the Arctic Circle4 ,
which reflects the fact that China has many interlinks with the changing
region. For instance, fitting downstream from the Arctic\'s climate
system, northern China\'s climate, biological and environmental systems
are directly affected by changes in the Arctic, [[Chinese
experts]{.mark} have been [active in the **research**
**projects**]{.mark} of several groups [under the Arctic
Council]{.mark}]{.underline}, China's funds, markets and
[[**proficiency** relating to **infrastructure**
**construction**]{.mark} and resource exploitation are [highly valued by
some Arctic countries]{.mark}]{.underline}. In particular, Chinese
shipping companies are pioneering on pilot voyages via Northern Sea
Route --constitutes major part of NEP-- to connect two major production
and consumer markets of Asia and Europe. With developing practices of
cooperation, the significance of the [[newly
proposed]{.underline}]{.mark} idea of the [Polar Silk Road
(**[PSR]{.mark}**]{.underline}) to the Arctic region in political,
economic and social patterns, its priorities and difficulties of
cooperation, and responsibilities of governments, enterprises and
citizens in construction of the PSR have become emerging topics of
international debate and discussion. '

1.CHINA'S CONCEPTION OF JOINTLY BUILDING THE PSR The idea of joint
establishment of the PSR was first appeared in the Chinese government\'s
document on the international cooperation on the Maritime Silk Road5 ,
which gradually developed during the practice of the Belt and Road
initiative, and was fully explained in the White Paper on China\'s
Arctic Policy published by Information office of State Department in
early 2018. The idea at beginning has been expressed in mixed
definition, including the Ice Silk Road6 , Silk Road on Ice7 when
President Xi Jinping met with Russian leader, and Finland8 . Based on
above mentioned policy and pragmatic practices, China has formulated its
own understanding of the PSR.

First of all, [jointly building the **PSR** is an [**international**
**initiative**]{.mark} which refers to specific region, [involving the
**cooperation**]{.mark} in Arctic\'s major shipping routes and coastal
areas]{.underline}. It focuses on Arctic's geopolitical, economic and
social connections to the world by joint efforts by Arctic nations,
international organizations and other stakeholders for Arctic
governance. According to the conditions for the development and
utilization of Arctic shipping routes, the PSR is currently more
concentrated in the development of the NEP, connecting East Asian
countries with European partners.

Secondly, the PSR reflects the common policy orientations of Arctic
states and other stakeholders towards to new opportunities of the Artic,
in particular for commercial opportunities of development of the Arctic
sea routes, while countering enormous ecological and environment
challenges with the increase of human activities. The possibility of
commercial use of Arctic shipping routes may significantly shorten the
traditional voyage, further enrich the international shipping network,
and promote economic and trade relationship of relevant countries and
region as whole. The PSR should not be a patented product of a
individual country, but a new platform for policy coordination and
science, industrial, social collaboration among various countries. China
advocates multilateral cooperation to jointly build the PSR and focus on
the forward-looking investments, focusing on the infrastructure
construction and green development to achieve a balance between
development and protection of the Arctic. China's participation to the
PSR is also a proactive response to the expectations of some countries,
regarding China\'s relative advantages in capital, technology and talent
on the development and utilization of the Arctic.

Thirdly, [the PSR serves one of the [most pragmatic platform of
**bilateral** and **multilateral** **cooperation**]{.mark} between
Arctic and Non-Arctic states]{.underline}. Although China's perception
of changes in the Arctic is direct and rapid, as a non-Arctic coastal
state located beyond the Arctic circle, bilateral or multilateral
cooperation based on respect of the sovereignty, sovereign rights, and
jurisdiction enjoyed by the Arctic States in this region, respect the
relevant marine management policies and willingness of Arctic coastal
states are important prerequisite for jointly building the PSR. In
practice, China attaches great importance to bilateral cooperation with
the Arctic countries, conducts bilateral consultations on Arctic affairs
with all Arctic countries, and [[established regular dialogue mechanisms
with all Arctic states]{.underline}]{.mark}. In 2012, China and Iceland
signed the Framework Agreement on Arctic Cooperation, which was the
first inter-governmental agreement on Arctic issues between China and an
Arctic State. In addition, China, Japan, South Korea and other countries
have carried out discussions on Arctic shipping issues,
[[promoting]{.mark} the establishment of equal [mutual trust]{.mark} and
[mutually beneficial cooperation]{.mark} among potential shipping route
users and investors]{.underline}, China also supports platforms such as
\"The Arctic: Territory of Dialogue\", \"The Arctic Circle\", \"Arctic
Frontiers\", \"The China-Nordic Arctic Research Center\", in promoting
exchanges and cooperation among the stakeholders, to explore a new model
of Arctic international cooperation involving multi-stakeholders.

Last but not least, the PSR is an integral part of China's Arctic policy
and an extension of the Belt and Road Initiative. As the major global
trade partner and a potential user, cooperation on Arctic shipping
routes are undoubtedly becoming one of the policy priorities of China.
Starting from 2013, Chinese companies have begun to explore the
commercial opportunities associated with Arctic shipping routes. The
COSCO shipping continued to carry out frequent navigation via NEP,
successfully finishing 10 voyages in 2018 along, and has dispatched 15
ships to complete 22 voyages since 2013.9 This policy orientation has
been demonstrated by the Vision for Maritime Cooperation under the Belt
and Road Initiative and the Arctic Policy issued by the China, where
clearly proposed the construction of the "blue economic passage is also
envisioned leading up to Europe via the Arctic Ocean"10. The
construction of the blue economic passage and eventually the PSR is not
only concentrated on maritime interconnection, but also to promote the
free flow of marine knowledge, culture, technology and talents,
advocates peaceful, green, innovative and win-win maritime cooperation
and deepens global significance and humanitarian care of the BRI.
2.CHINA'S POLICY ORIENTATIONS TOWARDS TO THE PSR In general, China\'s
policy goals on the Arctic are: to understand, protect, develop and
participate in the governance of the Arctic, so as to safeguard the
common interests of all countries and the international community in the
Arctic, and promote sustainable development of the Arctic.11
Unfortunately, many of China's moves relating to the Arctic have been
met with suspicion in light of its population size and its status as one
of the largest consumers of oil and natural gas products. The \"China
threat\" has become a hot topic that is highlighted in the media
worldwide, its increased prominence in the region has prompted concerns
from Arctic states over its long-term strategic objectives, including
possible military deployment.12 Regarding the PSR itself, it is also
discussed in scholarly arguments that Russia's Northern Sea Route has
been renamed the Polar Silk Road13, which have completely misinterpreted
China's policy orientations towards to the PSR. Emphases on docking of
national interests and strategies of relevant states. In response to the
opportunities and challenges brought about by the Arctic changes,
relevant countries have introduced and updated their development
strategies, covering various aspects of Arctic shipping. For instance,
one of the principle of the Icelandic Arctic Strategy is "make full use
of employment opportunities created by changes in the Arctic region" 14,
especially focuses on opening up new Arctic shipping routes which
connect the North Atlantic, the Arctic Ocean and the Pacific. Sweden is
calling for efficient, multilateral cooperation on the Arctic, "aiming
to prevent and limit the negative environmental impact potentially
caused by the opening--up of new shipping routes and sea areas in the
Arctic" and "contribute to safer and greener shipping"15. One of the
priorities of the Finland's Arctic strategy is "continue to maintain
Finland's position as a leading expert in the Arctic maritime industry
and shipping and keep Finnish companies closely involved in development
projects in Arctic sea areas"16. Coastal states of the Arctic Ocean are
more focused on utilization of new shipping route and update of related
transport infrastructures, especially when Russia has defined "use of
the Northern Sea Route as a national single transport communication of
the Russian Federation in the Arctic" as one of its national interests
in the Arctic17. In the process of participating in the Arctic affairs,
China follows the basic principles of \"respect, cooperation, win-win
result and sustainability\"18, which suggests that whether bilateral or
multilateral cooperation between China and Arctic countries is included
in the framework of the BRI initiative, the Chinese government respects
the willingness of Arctic partners, and will rely on the development and
utilization of the Arctic sea route with all interested countries,
especially Arctic states.

Hence, [many [Arctic countries see the]{.mark} **[PSR]{.mark}** also [as
an **opportunity** and gave positive responses. **Finish**
President]{.mark}]{.underline} Sauli Niinisto believes that "[the Polar
Silk Road is]{.underline} not only a plan for more roads, railways and
shipping routes, but also [a vision for promoting **understanding**
among different peoples]{.underline}".19
**[[Iceland]{.underline}]{.mark}**'s Foreign Minister, Mr. Thordarson
underlined that his "[[government]{.mark} [follows]{.mark} carefully and
with interest the **B**elt and **R**oad **I**nitiative, including the
\"**[Silk Road on Ice]{.mark}**\"]{.underline}, which is focused on
opening up new shipping routes through the Arctic."20 Russian President
Vladimir Putin has expressed that Russia is consistently upgrading
maritime, railway and road infrastructure, investing significant
resources into improvements to the NEP in order for it to "become
a global competitive transport artery", and more importantly to calling
for "completely reconfigure transportation on the Eurasian continent",
by putting "infrastructure projects within the EAEU and the One Belt,
One Road initiative in conjunction with the Northeast Passage"21.

Prioritizes knowledge accumulation and scientific research as the
guiding principle for cooperation. The Arctic is no doubt rich in
resources, but is also the region that receives the most direct impact
of climate change, climate change is causing major changes in the
Arctic, threatening the Arctic ecosystem, including changes in species
range, wetland loss, and destruction of the marine food chain, which
demands of utilization and development in a sustainable manner are more
urgent than other places. Coal, metals, oil and natural gas, fishery
resources and other "Arctic golds" are stored in a fragile environment
and harsh production conditions. Therefore, in addition to the
exploration of Arctic resources and new shipping routes, all human
activities regarding resource exploration require environmental risk,
production safety risk and ecological sensitivity assessments. In this
sense, the PSR should reflect common exploration of humankind for
accumulate knowledge, responsible action and joint response to global
challenges, to understand how climate change and human activities pose
obstacles to the migration and reproduction of Arctic species, and how
environmental pollution such as oil spills can affect fragile marine
ecology. The acquisition of knowledge and the response based on
scientific researches are necessary for the development the PSR.

Currently, one of the biggest challenges in the year-round operation of
Arctic shipping routes is limited monitoring and forecasting knowledge
of sea-ice conditions, frequent navigation with limited hydrological
data[. [China is aimed to **joint research** and **data
sharing**]{.underline}]{.mark} [on feasibility and operational safety of
the PSR with interested parties]{.underline}. This can occur under
various frameworks including the International Arctic Science Committee,
Arctic Council working groups, the University of the Arctic, and the
Agreement on Enhancing International Arctic Scientific Cooperation, also
through bilateral cooperation. Formulating and implementing mandatory
environmental standards and technical requirements based on a solid
scientific basis is essential to the PSR. Navigation security in the
Arctic shipping routes is one of China's priorities of concerns, which
has been conducted comprehensive studies and hydrographic surveys with
the aim to improving the navigation, security and logistical capacities
in the Arctic region. [China [abides by the **Polar**
**Code**]{.mark}]{.underline} and [[supports the **IMO**]{.mark} in
playing an active role in formulating navigational rules for Arctic
shipping.]{.underline}

Besides conducting research on climate change trends and ecological
assessments, innovation in both the natural and social sciences can be
promoted by strengthening research on Arctic politics, economics, law,
society, history, culture, and the management of human activities. In
addition, sustainable development in the Arctic will need to balance
development and protection at the international level and catalyze
bilateral and multilateral cooperation across various sectors--- e.g.,
the economy, environment, health, and infrastructure. To this end,
[[Arctic states, non-Arctic states]{.mark}, and nonstate
actors]{.underline} should [[**coordinate** their long-term **policies**
on]{.mark} technical standards and investment of the
**[PSR]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Plans for cooperation should address the
preservation of ecology and biodiversity, prevention of marine pollution
in Arctic sea routes, reduction in marine acidification, and promotion
of sustainable fisheries.

Promotes green technology solutions and humanistic concerns. Technology
serves humanity. The exceptionality of the PSR and Arctic region as
whole raising the demand of green economy and green solutions, require
both "economic development road map" and the "green technology progress
map". Although the economic benefits driven by the opening up of
shipping routes will increase the economic development rate, but extreme
weather condition such as low temperatures, magnetic storms will pose a
threat to equipment and personnel safety. The core area of Arctic
technological innovation need to focus on communications, navigation,
infrastructure and logistics, in particular on various scientific
monitoring and detection technologies, engineering techniques suitable
for Arctic environment, shipbuilding and navigation, resource
utilization technologies in permafrost regions and fragile environments.
China attaches importance to both land based and marine based
cooperation of the PSR, promotes the interaction between the inland
economy and the marine economy through infrastructure connectivity, also
encourages the development of technology and equipment that pays
attention to environmental protection capabilities and innovative
elements in the construction of Arctic infrastructure, focuses on
sustainable energy system, including wind power, ocean tidal energy,
geothermal energy and hydropower, strengthening clean energy cooperation
with Arctic countries, exploring the supply and utilization of
geothermal and wind energy, achieving low-carbon development.

[[Promoting interconnectivity of the Arctic]{.mark} is an
[important]{.mark}]{.underline} indicator [[for]{.mark} innovative
solutions of the **[PSR]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To achieve a balance
between development and protection, [[China is committed to **green**
**solutions**]{.mark} of infrastructure construction [and **digital**
**connection**]{.mark} in the region]{.underline}. Norway is actively
considering the possibility of greater involvement by Chinese Arctic
shipping stakeholders,22 the Arctic Corridor project -railway project
that would connect the city of Rovaniemi in northern Finland with the
Norwegian port of Kirkenes- could be well-suited for cooperation under
the PSR framework, parties concerned have come to China to discuss the
possibility to cooperate with Chinese companies and the project has a
brochure in Chinese.23 In addition, [[Chinese government and
enterprises]{.mark} are [involved in Arctic cooperation in submarine
**cable** **construction**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Ministry of
Industry and Information Technology of [China and China Telecom are
working with the Finland on trans-Arctic **submarine** **cable**
project]{.underline}- a 10,500 kilometer fiberoptic maritime cable link
across the Arctic Circle- and will be joined by Russian, Japanese and
Norwegian partners.24

#### Chinese [leadership]{.underline} in the Arctic Council [revitalizes]{.underline} arctic governance.

**Ponczek '23** \[Cordelia Buchanan Ponczek, 7-17-2023, \"Arctic
Ambitions: The Role of Russia in China\'s Polar Strategy\", ISPI,
https://www.ispionline.it/en/publication/arctic-ambitions-the-role-of-russia-in-chinas-polar-strategy-135859\]

[Critical [**infrastructure** is another key element]{.mark} of China's
Arctic strategy]{.underline}. China already utilizes Arctic shipping
routes and is working to access the critical minerals and other natural
resources the Arctic holds. The area is rich with sub-soil resources
that can be extracted and used in China's production and processing of
rare earth elements and its access to natural gas. 

The discussion over critical infrastructure and gas supplies has taken
off most recently in the Russian-Chinese negotiations over the Power of
Siberia 2 (PoS-2) pipeline. While China is the only reasonable market
destination for eastern Siberian gas carried by 2014's Power of Siberia
pipeline, the PoS-2 is different. A physical pipeline, which would
originate from the Yamal Peninsula in Western Siberia and go on to
supply China, would be a decisive shift---if not a full
re-orientation---of Russia's natural gas market to the east. Yamal gas
previously flowed west, carried by pipelines like Nord Stream. But the
European desire for Russian hydrocarbons has decidedly taped off. Both
Power of Siberia projects are opaque, and though the Russian state
claims Power of Siberia is lucrative, the numbers are not clear enough
or public enough to confirm this. As with any critical infrastructure
project that is shrouded in secrecy, there are hefty financing risks.
The pipeline infrastructure is not a closed deal, and it does not need
to be. Russia and China have alternative ways to trade in natural gas,
including through Central Asia (Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan have
pipelines and significant gas export to China already) and through LNG,
which includes Russia's in-process Arctic LNG project. China remains
reluctant to make such a large commitment to Russia, which could cost
China economic leverage in Europe. As a tool of influence, large
infrastructure projects can be more powerful before they are confirmed
than after the deal is done, and large infrastructure projects have been
a double-edged sword for China's reputation and solvency. China's
reluctance is complimented by---or evidence of---Russia's weakened
negotiating position vis-à-vis the war in Ukraine and the overspread of
materials. European countries and the United States should take note.

A precedent of what "Arctic" means could shift. Concerns over further
politicization of the Arctic Council is one reason the body is currently
operating without Russia, with Russia's Arctic leadership at a
stalemate. The Arctic Council, which was under Russian leadership at the
beginning of 2023, suspended all activities and only accepted Russia's
passing the rotating chairpersonship to Norway. Bringing China further
into the equation could deepen this freeze. But it is likely China will
apply pressure. Similar to the soft inroads China has made to the
Russian Arctic space, [[China could pick up]{.mark} on [key issues for
the **Arctic** **Council** and lobby to advance
them]{.mark}]{.underline}. Topics like [[**environmental** and climate
change **research**, treatment of **preserved areas**, access to
critical raw **materials**, and maritime **routes**]{.mark} are all
areas where China is a genuine actor and has a stake. Lobbying these
positions could [result in a strategy where China tries to
create]{.mark}]{.underline} parallel [[consulting **groups** or
institutions--in the **Arctic Council**]{.underline}]{.mark} or
elsewhere--to address these issues. 

[The other seven [Arctic nations can expect China to try to work
]{.mark}]{.underline}bi-laterally [[with them]{.underline}]{.mark}, as
well. Aside from this, China might try to leverage other global actors
to push for an expansion of the Arctic zone of interest; to this effect,
China's 2018 Arctic White Paper lists the area as a community for all of
humankind, not just the Arctic Eight. [China could try to [make
**overtures** to the **Arctic** **Council**]{.mark}, but it is [more
likely that China will pursue]{.mark}]{.underline} and suggest
alternative places for [[discussion, diplomacy, and
policy]{.underline}]{.mark}. If they want to prevent China from
establishing a foothold, other Arctic powers should be aware of these
factors, especially China's pressure on Russia and attempts to negotiate
in other avenues on matters where it seeks an interest. [The [Arctic
seven should]{.mark}]{.underline} work to clearly define Arctic policy
agenda items, [[**maintain** the Arctic **Council** as the route for
legitimate Arctic discussion]{.underline}]{.mark}, and remain true to
the notion of an Arctic space.

Governance from the Perspective of International Law, Law & Economy,

\(2\) Immaturity in China's Arctic Rule-Shaping Capabilities

At the international level, [[China's **capacity** to shape]{.mark}
Arctic-related [international rules remains
**underdeveloped**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This stems from [China's status
as a non-Arctic state]{.underline}, which [[lacks sovereignty over
Arctic territories]{.mark} under international law and holds only
observer status in the Arctic Council,]{.underline} resulting in a
[[weaker legal standing]{.mark} and [limited influence in rule-making
processes]{.mark}]{.underline}. While this relatively closed
institutional landscape is difficult to alter, China retains potential
to enhance its agenda-setting capabilities and targeted rule-shaping
expertise in specific domains.

Specifically, [advancing agenda-setting [requires crafting
**norm-setting initiatives**]{.mark} that [garner **multilateral**
**support**]{.mark}, such as proposing Arctic-specific environmental or
shipping regulations aligned with global priorities]{.underline}.
Meanwhile, improving rule-shaping capacity demands systemic investments
in specialized talent (e.g., Arctic legal and technical experts),
increased participation in expert-level negotiations, and streamlined
interagency coordination to unify China's diplomatic, scientific, and
economic strategies in Arctic governance. (Jiang, C. Y., 2021)

4.2 China's Response Strategies 4.2.1 Effectively Leverage Existing
International Organizations and International Law-Based Systems To
better engage with the international legal system for Arctic governance,
China should prioritize leveraging existing international organizations
and international law-based frameworks. Firstly, it must strengthen its
role as an Arctic Council observer. By actively participating in council
activities, contributing to specialized working group discussions, and
offering expert recommendations on Arctic affairs, China can amplify its
influence in regional decision-making. Secondly, China should deepen its
involvement in Arctic-related international bodies such as the United
Nations (UN) and the International Maritime Organization (IMO). Through
these platforms, China can shape Arctic rule-making on a broader scale
while elevating its global diplomatic clout. Thirdly, proactive
engagement in Arctic-related international negotiations is critical. By
fostering dialogue and consensus-building, China can secure greater
discourse power, ensuring its perspectives inform the development of
Arctic rules---a goal requiring enhanced diplomatic strategies and
multilateral collaboration. Finally, China must cultivate a cadre of
professionals skilled in international organizational dynamics,
particularly legal experts capable of driving the drafting, amendment,
and interpretation of international rules. This includes targeted
training in Arctic law, multilateral negotiation tactics, and
institutional diplomacy to bridge gaps in specialized expertise 4.2.2
Improve Domestic Legal Frameworks for Arctic Governance To strengthen
the domestic legal framework for Arctic governance, China must
accelerate the development of a comprehensive polar legal system to fill
gaps in domestic legislation. The legislative process should begin with
Antarctic laws, which face fewer political obstacles, and progressively
extend to Arctic-specific legislation, while ensuring regulatory
coherence between the two poles to harmonize standards and avoid
conflicts. Simultaneously, reforms to polar governance institutions are
critical. First, elevating the administrative authority of polar
management bodies will enhance their decision-making power and
legitimacy. Second, expanding their functional mandates is necessary to
address emerging challenges such as environmental monitoring, resource
management, and international cooperation. Third, streamlining
coordination mechanisms among domestic agencies---such as the Ministry
of Natural Resources, the Chinese Arctic and Antarctic Administration,
and environmental regulators---will improve interdepartmental synergy
and governance efficiency. By integrating these interconnected measures,
China can establish a robust legal and institutional foundation to
support its sustainable and influential participation in polar
governance. 4.2.3 Promote Multilayered Cooperation and Participation in
Arctic Affairs Polar affairs transcend regional boundaries to constitute
a global public issue central to humanity's shared future, necessitating
coordinated international governance. China must pursue a multi-tiered,
multi-stakeholder approach to Arctic engagement. At the state level,
China should deepen bilateral and multilateral cooperation with Arctic
nations through joint research initiatives, collaborative projects, and
economic partnerships. By forging stronger strategic partnerships, China
can enhance its agenda-setting capacity in Arctic governance, ensuring
its priorities align with global sustainability goals. Concurrently,
scientific collaboration and data sharing with Arctic states are
critical. Pooling research findings and datasets not only unlocks
cooperative opportunities but also strengthens the scientific basis for
China's policy decisions in Arctic governance. Beyond official channels,
China should empower non-state actors---including NGOs, research
institutions, enterprises, and individuals---to actively contribute to
Arctic governance. Leveraging track II diplomacy (civil diplomacy) and
public diplomacy, these actors can foster grassroots dialogues, advance
technological innovation, and promote cross-cultural understanding,
complementing state-led efforts and enriching China's holistic
engagement strategy 4.2.4 Propose Responsible Arctic Governance Concepts
and Solutions China's engagement in reforming and shaping the
international legal system for Arctic governance must leverage its role
as a key stakeholder in Arctic affairs, guided by the principles of
consultation, collaboration, and shared benefits, with the overarching
aim of safeguarding humanity's common interests, while firmly protecting
its core national interests. Specifically, building on scientific
research, China can prioritize environmental protection---a
low-political-tension domain---as an entry point, addressing the
livelihoods of Arctic Indigenous communities and advocating for a
sustainable, eco-centric Arctic governance model. By supporting and
participating in Arctic ecological conservation, promoting green
technologies (e.g., renewable energy, pollution control), and balancing
economic development with environmental stewardship, China can champion
equitable solutions that harmonize resource utilization and ecological
resilience.

5\. Conclusion

[China's [**geographical** **remoteness** from the Arctic inherently
**challenges** its **participation**]{.mark} in shaping the
international legal framework]{.underline} for Arctic governance, while
[the [**volatile** international **landscape** further amplifies
uncertainties in this process]{.mark}]{.underline}. Ultimately, China's
strategy to strengthen its role in Arctic legal governance must center
on capacity-building and enhancing institutional discourse power. To
advance capacity-building, three priorities stand out: Firstly, China
must prioritize enhancing its economic and scientific prowess,
particularly in Arctic-related infrastructure, technology, and research,
which form the bedrock for practical engagements such as icebreaker
operations, climate modeling, and resource exploration. Secondly,
establishing a comprehensive domestic legal framework for polar
governance is critical to regulate Arctic activities, align domestic
practices with international norms, and address China's specific
strategic needs. Thirdly, cultivating a specialized talent
pool---including experts in international law, Arctic diplomacy, and
multilateral negotiations---is essential to bridge expertise gaps and
sustain long-term engagement. In parallel, enhancing institutional
discourse power demands a threefold approach: Concurrently, China should
leverage existing international platforms (e.g., the Arctic Council,
UNCLOS forums) to refine its legal advocacy and rule-shaping strategies,
demonstrating mastery of international law. Furthermore, deepening
international partnerships---both with Arctic states and non-Arctic
actors---is vital to amplify China's voice in multilateral negotiations.
Finally, fostering a multi-stakeholder governance model---engaging
governments, NGOs, academia, and industry---will diversify
participation, enrich policy perspectives, and solidify China's role as
an important stakeholder in Arctic affairs.

### Trump Thumps

#### Trump guts the Arctic Council -- he will go scorched earth even if he doesn't withdraw.

**Huebert '25**

\[Rob, March 3, professor in the Department of Political Science at the
University of Calgary. He also is the interim director of the Centre for
Military, Security and Strategic Studies, "Can the Arctic Council
survive the Trump administration? Probably not. Here's why",
https://www.arctictoday.com/can-the-arctic-council-survive-the-trump-administration-probably-not-heres-why/\]

The havoc caused by the new American administration has been devastating
on a wide range of fronts. [[We are]{.underline}]{.mark} quite possibly
[[witnessing]{.mark} [the **end of the western rules-based international
order**]{.mark} that has lasted since the end of World War II. While
[Trump]{.mark}'s attention [hasn't]{.mark} yet [shifted to the Arctic
Council]{.mark}, it should be apparent to all that [this is]{.mark} just
[a **matter of time**]{.mark}.]{.underline} When he does[, [the outcomes
will be **devastating**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[He
will]{.underline}]{.mark} probably take three steps that will combine to
[either **[gut the key works]{.mark}** of the Council, [or]{.mark}
possibly **[end it altogether]{.mark}**.]{.underline} First, [Trump's
elimination of international aid demonstrates his policy of selfish
isolationism]{.underline}. His decision to stop much of the assistance
provided under the USAID program shows that [[he has no inclination
to]{.mark} understand the benefits of [a]{.mark} cooperative
[multilateral system]{.mark}]{.underline}, or a desire to continue a
policy that every U.S. president since Kennedy has supported. In
addition, [he has [openly criticized NATO and]{.mark} the [ICC]{.mark},
along with many of the U.S. economic agreements]{.underline} with other
nations. In both his first term and now his second, [Trump has shown [a
clear lack of support for]{.mark} international organizations and
[multilateral agreements]{.mark}]{.underline}. Specifically, he seems
[[intent on]{.mark} either [ending American participation or upending
the agreements]{.mark} solely for American benefit.]{.underline} Trump
has already demonstrated that [[even if he doesn't withdraw]{.mark} from
the Arctic Council, [he would actively gut]{.mark} some of [the most
important]{.mark} [achievements]{.mark}]{.underline} in line with his
own goals. First, [[he **doesn't "believe" in climate
change**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} During Trump's first term, the Arctic
Council ministerial meeting in Rovaniemi in 2019 failed to produce a
final declaration for the first time since the organization was created.
This was because [the U.S. delegation]{.underline} -- under the
leadership of Secretary of States Mike Pompeo -- [objected to the term
"climate change" or any reference to the Paris Accord. There is nothing
to suggest that the American position on climate change will be altered.
[If anything, it will]{.mark} probably [get **more strident**]{.mark}.
[Trump has]{.mark} also [moved quickly to end]{.mark}]{.underline}
American programs that are in any way associated with the issues
surrounding Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ([[DEI]{.underline}). [It is
highly unlikely]{.underline}]{.mark} that as part of this process to
reshape American society, [his administration [would support]{.mark} any
of the important [initiatives supporting]{.mark} the northern
[Indigenous Peoples]{.mark} under the Arctic Council]{.underline}. His
administration has had no qualms about ending the support that the U.S.
had provided to the developing world, so he will almost certainly be
unwilling to continue to provide any support of the Permanent
Participants or any of the Arctic Council programs that support them.
Third, [[Trump has **directly attacked**]{.mark} two of the [**core
state members** of the Arctic Council]{.mark}.]{.underline} Since his
second term began, [he has repeatedly [threatened to "take over]{.mark}"
both [Greenland and Canada]{.mark}]{.underline}. While some at first
thought he was just joking, Trump has continued to say that these are
his intentions. [He has begun to take active steps, through the threats
[of a trade war to]{.mark} critically [weaken
Canada]{.mark}]{.underline} in order to make it more amendable to
"joining" the U.S. Again, [[even if he doesn't]{.mark} move to directly
des[troy the Arctic Council, how could Canada and Denmark work with the
U.S.,]{.mark} knowing that the Americans are actively moving to
weaken]{.underline} or even cripple [them]{.underline} as a
state[?]{.underline} Fourth, the one Arctic state that Trump has
attempted to improve relations with -- [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} --
[[remains]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[problematic]{.underline}]{.mark}
for the Arctic Council. [[Trump's effort to work with Russia will make
the existing issues]{.mark} that the Arctic Council had with Russia
[even more difficult]{.mark}.]{.underline} Trump has already called for
the Russians to be readmitted to the G-7. If he doesn't move to end the
Arctic Council, he will undoubtedly call for any sanctions against
Russia to be eliminated and for the country to be fully integrated. At
the same time he is actively moving to directly be involved in assisting
Russia to complete its conquest of Ukraine. In a move that is
reminiscent of the conquest of Czechoslovakia through the capitulation
of the U.K. and France to Germany in 1938, Trump has begun direct
negotiations with Russia without the involvement of the Ukrainians.
Putin now knows that it has the support of Trump. As a result, [there is
every reason to believe that Russia will continue with its acts of
aggression]{.underline} against its neighbours. This includes both
Sweden and Finland, who both chose to join NATO. Putin has always made
it clear that it was the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO that was
one of the reasons for his decision to launch his war of aggression
against Ukraine in 2014. Ultimately, this means that [the Arctic Council
now faces two **terrible scenarios**]{.underline}. The first is that
[[in his **scorched earth** policy toward multilateralism, Trump]{.mark}
[will]{.mark} either move to [**end the Arctic Council** o]{.mark}r at
least **[remove the U.S.]{.mark}** as a member.]{.underline} He may also
carry out his threat to ensure that both Canada and Denmark also cease
to be meaningful members of the Arctic Council. If he truly does intend
to take over Canada, it won't even be a state. Even if he only means to
weaken and reduce Canada to a vassal state, its ability to participate
will be damaged -- if not eliminated. Likewise, if the U.S. takes over
Greenland, Denmark's main rational for being a member of the Arctic
Council will be eliminated. Assuming that somehow the Arctic Council
survives an American withdrawal, and the U.S. follows up its threats to
control Greenland and Canada, the Council would have only the active
membership of Finland, Sweden, Norway and Iceland. [Even if the U.S.
remains in the Arctic Council, its current actions means the gutting of
some of its most important missions]{.underline}, The U.S. won't support
actions to eliminate the causes of climate change, and it is very
unlikely to support the Permanent Participants. Outside of the Council,
perhaps the Coast Guard forum will continue. But even here Trump is
having an impact. He has already fired Admiral Linda Pagan, the
Commandant of the USCG. American officials have suggested it was because
of her commitment to DEI policies. Even more dangerously, [[this
variant]{.mark} of the Arctic Council [would include a U.S. whose
policies are]{.mark} now **[at complete odds]{.mark}** with the previous
actions of the Arctic Council]{.underline}. It would also include a
Denmark that has either lost Greenland to the U.S. or will need to take
action to prevent this. It will include a Canada that is being
continually weakened by American action, and is either actively trying
to stop an American takeover or has become a vassal state to the U.S.
[It will also include a Russia that is being increasingly supported by
the U.S]{.underline}. and has been given the right of conquest over
Ukraine. Furthermore, if Ukraine was conquered for considering joining
NATO, the future of both Finland and Sweden (which did actually join
NATO) will undoubtedly be even more problematic for Russia. [[These are
**dire times**]{.mark} for the Arctic Council. [It is **hard to think of
a way** to maintain its]{.mark} many [successes]{.mark}]{.underline} in
supporting an understanding of the impact of climate change on the
Arctic. It has also played an important role in supporting a greater
awareness of the northern Indigenous Peoples in the region. And perhaps
most importantly, it has served as the principal means of promoting a
peaceful and harmonious international regime of cooperation. All of this
is now at risk. Perhaps Trump won't think that the Arctic Council is
worth his attention, and it can somehow remain under the American radar
until the next presidential election. But as many have said in the past,
[hope is not a strategy]{.underline}.

### Perm: Do Both

#### Unilateral development is primarily based off defense and security \-\-- no reason why that and cooperative, multilateral, tools can't co-exist.

The [[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} is increasingly a very
[busy]{.underline} international [region]{.underline}. However,
[existing [multi- lateral instruments]{.mark}]{.underline} are [sparse
and]{.underline} are [[not designed for]{.underline}]{.mark} a
**[rapidly [changing environment]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Perhaps more
troubling is the unwillingness of Arctic [[states]{.mark}]{.underline}
to develop new instruments of cooperation. Their [[willingness to invest
in improving]{.mark} their northern [security]{.mark} capabilities
[suggests]{.mark}]{.underline} that they do [recognize that **change is
coming** But]{.underline} are ultimately [[preparing to depend]{.mark}
on [their own ability]{.mark}]{.underline} to protect their own northern
interests. This in itself is [[not out of place]{.underline}]{.mark}.
**[[States]{.mark} are ultimately [responsible for]{.mark} the [security
of their people]{.mark}]{.underline}**, including their northern
inhabitants. The [[military]{.underline}]{.mark} remains one of [the
[best]{.mark} [provider]{.mark}s of search and rescue and]{.underline}
any other [disaster relief]{.underline}. Thus there is [[no
question]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[new]{.mark} security
[capabilities]{.mark} are [needed]{.mark}]{.underline} so that northern
states know and can act when their interests are being threatened[.
[But]{.mark} this **[does not preclude]{.mark}** the [Arctic states
developing]{.mark}]{.underline} new [[**multilateral tools to work
cooperatively**.]{.mark} Maritime [disputes]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
Arctic [are [numerous]{.mark} and [increasing]{.mark}]{.underline} as
the northern states develop their continental shelf claims. [[Why not
develop]{.mark} a [body or]{.mark} agreed [process]{.mark} that can
[operate strictly for the Arctic states for]{.mark} the [purpose of
resolving]{.mark} these differences?]{.underline} States will develop
oil and gas on a large scale in the near future. While most of these
fields will be developed within the control of a specific state, the
environmental consequences of an accident or spill will not.
[[Now]{.mark} is [the time to develop both]{.mark} a [cooperative
regime]{.mark}]{.underline} to ensure that any accident is handled as
quickly as possible [[and]{.mark} an international
[agreement]{.mark}]{.underline} governing search and rescue [that goes
beyond the current regime]{.underline}.

When Kenneth Hoegh, a native Greenlander, thinks about the Arctic these
days, he tries to focus on the common ground between countries rather
than the [[increasingly fraught political relationships]{.mark} among
Arctic nations --- including between his own territory and the United
States.]{.underline}

It's a difficult but essential mindset as he steps up to lead the
[[operations of the Arctic Council]{.underline}]{.mark}, the preeminent
body [tasked with maintaining multilateral cooperation in the
Arctic]{.underline}. Hoegh, who is also the Kingdom of Denmark's Arctic
ambassador, is taking over as chair of the council's senior Arctic
officials, diplomats who guide its activities.

The Monday handover comes at a time of remarkable geopolitical tension
for a region that, until a few years ago, was seen as a sort of neutral
zone, with the countries ringing it broadly united in their desire to
maintain a "High North, low tension" approach.

But now [[the US]{.mark}, one of the council's eight permanent member
states]{.underline}, has [[expressed interest in **acquiring**]{.mark}
two other members, [**Greenland** and **Canada**.
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}, also on the council, [[has stood at
**odds**]{.underline}]{.mark} with its peers since its invasion of
Ukraine.

Climate research, a priority of the council, is also under pressure as
US funding cuts stand to reduce scientific activity in the region and
Russia's isolation hinders collaboration.

"We are communicating within the frames that we have," Hoegh said. "We
will just try to do our level best to do as much as possible. We have to
work within that political landscape."

[The council's [mandate is to work collaboratively]{.mark}]{.underline}
with Arctic nations, Indigenous communities and increasingly engaged
observer states --- like China --- on polar issues affecting the entire
world. As the fastest-warming part of the world opens up, there are
competing interests that need to be managed.

But the [body is [being **pushed** outside its **comfort zone**.
**Tensions**]{.mark} between members are becoming harder to ignore even
as they [make **survival** of the organization]{.mark}
critical]{.underline}. The world's eyes are on the region for
its critical mineral stores and shipping lanes emerging from melting sea
ice.

The Kingdom of Denmark, which includes Greenland and the Faroe Islands,
chose the Greenlander Hoegh to lead its council work. Neither Hoegh nor
Denmark's Senior Arctic Official Torsten Kjolby Nielsen would comment on
how Trump's aspirations to acquire Greenland may affect the council, if
at all.

"It's multilateral work; we consider this a bilateral question," Nielsen
said.

When Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, the council immediately suspended
all activity. Norway became chair a year later, after a handover from
Russia that was itself, at times, in doubt. Norway gradually restarted
work, first with scientific projects that didn't include Russia, then
with virtual working-group meetings and finally with in-person meetings
between the chair and the six Indigenous groups that are permanent
participants.

"It's no secret, of course, that the [Arctic Council has been
[**severely affected** by the Russian]{.mark} unlawful, full-scale
[invasion of **Ukraine**]{.mark}]{.underline}," Nielsen said. "It is a
complicated situation for us as a chairship because if you imagine a
triangle, we have no business as usual in one corner, yet we have a
growing interest and relevance in the Arctic globally, and also within
our own states."

Russia has made clear that it would like to see the council's operations
fully normalized, which would require a former policy change agreed to
by all other permanent member states. That likely won't be possible
without a resolution in Ukraine, said Espen Barth Eide, Norway's
minister of foreign affairs, who previously chaired the currently
suspended political arm of the Arctic Council. While there are no
political-level meetings happening now, another Greenlander, the
territory's foreign minister Vivian Motzfeldt, will chair meetings of
foreign ministers should they resume.

["[As long as there's no peace agreement in **Ukraine**, I don't think
it will be possible to extend the **cooperation**]{.mark} any further
than it is right now,"]{.underline} Eide said in a May 9 interview about
Norway's tenure leading the council.

#### Ukraine thumps Council importance -- completely stopped operations

Alan **Cunningham**, 20**24**, PhD Fellow at the University of
Birmingham, 5/14/2024, "Shifting Ice: How the Russian Invasion of
Ukraine has changed Arctic Circle Governance and the Arctic Council\'s
Path Forward", The Arctic Institute,
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/shifting-ice-russian-invasion-ukraine-arctic-circle-governance-arctic-councils-path-forward/

Despite these positive indicators, [[the Arctic Council's ability
to]{.mark} [weather geopolitical storms]{.mark} abruptly [ended with
Russia's invasion of Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}. On March 3, 2022,
less than two months after the Arctic Council was nominated for the
Nobel Peace Prize, the [seven other permanent [members]{.mark} of the
council took an unprecedented step in [declaring they would]{.mark} be
"[paus]{.mark}ing [participation in all meetings of the \[Arctic\]
Council]{.mark} and its subsidiary bodies]{.underline}." The forum
previously navigated diplomatic disagreements among member states,
including over the Iraq War in 2003, Georgian War in 2008, and
annexation of Crimea in 2014, but **[[disagreement over]{.mark} the
invasion of [Ukraine was irreconcilable]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Not only
does this change the future of Arctic relations, but it also
(temporarily) ends Russia's participation in one of its few remaining
soft power venues capable of meaningful international coordination.

How Will the Diplomatic Fallout Change Arctic Governance?

Following the seven-member states' boycott of the Arctic Council, there
has been speculation that the West will fundamentally reshape Arctic
governance by forming a new international body without Russia, known as
"Nordic Plus." Theoretically, this forum would include the seven
protesting states and Arctic indigenous peoples (including those from
Russia). While Nordic Plus would have shared values and government
norms, it would forfeit the institutional legitimacy and progress that
the Arctic Council has fostered. Furthermore, little utility exists in
such an organization without Moscow.

Russia accounts for nearly half of the Arctic's population, over half of
the Arctic's coastline, and the majority of Arctic industry. It also
dominates Arctic energy production, fishing, and shipping. Moreover, the
Russian Arctic remains critical to addressing global environmental
issues such as permafrost thawing and wildfire prevention. Without
Russia in the Arctic Council, scientists will not be able to share data
between weather observatories or monitor Siberian permafrost melt. Given
Russia's Arctic assets, any organization governing the region without
Moscow would be attempting to oversee an area mostly outside its
control. Even if a forum like Nordic Plus attempted to include other
Russian partners such as indigenous representatives, it is hard to
imagine that Moscow would permit such representatives to attend.

These rumors notwithstanding, the structure of the Arctic Council is
likely to stay intact, though its operations will surely change. In all
likelihood, the Arctic Council will resume operations when Russia turns
over its chairmanship to Norway in spring 2023, or when a resolution is
reached to end the war in Ukraine. But the story of future Arctic
governance does not end here.

[[The Arctic Council will **lose legitimacy**]{.mark} and goodwill [and
its agenda will shrink]{.mark} in both scope and size [as]{.mark} future
[Russian statements on Arctic cooperation will]{.mark} likely [be
met]{.mark} [with]{.mark} more [skepticism]{.mark} from the other seven
members than ever before]{.underline}. While some might argue that this
was already the case after Russia's annexation of Crimea, the
reverberations felt in the Arctic from the two episodes of Russian
belligerence were of vastly different scales. [The war in
[Ukraine]{.mark} has [led to]{.mark} all seven Arctic states
implementing unprecedented [sanctions]{.mark} against Russia [and
boycotting the Arctic Council]{.mark}]{.underline}. The reaction to the
annexation, by contrast, was lukewarm. While the states ended most
military-to-military discussions, they also increased regional
cooperation by forming the Arctic Coast Guard Forum in 2015.

[Many have seen the Arctic region as a zone of peace, insulated from
external political disputes. The war in Ukraine and subsequent boycott
of the Arctic Council will [prove **devastating** to]{.mark} this
[theory of Arctic exceptionalism]{.mark}, [and to the council's position
as the foundation of Arctic governance]{.mark} going
forward]{.underline}. [[High tensions]{.mark} among members of the
council will likely [mean]{.mark} that [only the **least
controversial**]{.mark} Arctic [issues will be addressed]{.mark} when
the council reconvenes]{.underline}. The least contentious issues are
not coincidentally the three binding treaties passed by the Arctic
Council: the Agreement on Search and Rescue in the Arctic (2011),
Agreement on Marine Oil Pollution in the Arctic (2013), and Agreement on
Enhancing Arctic Scientific Cooperation (2017).

[Recent [progress on]{.mark} imposing [international legal frameworks
on]{.mark} more sensitive [issues such as fishing]{.mark} disputes,
[energy]{.mark} production, [continental shelf claims]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} freedom of [navigation]{.mark} will [**come to a
standstill** as the war in Ukraine drags on and]{.mark} geopolitical
[tensions rise]{.mark}]{.underline}. While the Arctic Council was never
directly responsible for drafting and enforcing agreements on some of
these matters, it served as the facilitator of regional diplomacy.
Moreover, the forum played a pivotal role in proposing oil and gas
drilling guidelines and encouraging states to join the International
Agreement to Prevent Unregulated Fishing in the High Seas (2018).
Unfortunately, these issues become more difficult to solve with every
passing year as the Arctic Ocean becomes increasingly navigable, thus
heightening the probability of interstate conflict.

Rising tensions [[will transition]{.mark} [the]{.mark} Arctic [Council
from]{.mark} a high-level [diplomatic facilitator to a low-level]{.mark}
tactically-oriented **[talk shop]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Arctic Council
representatives will likely eschew ministerial-level discussions.
[Foreign Minister Lavrov is personally sanctioned by the United States,
Canada, European Union, and the United Kingdom and he is unlikely to
ever step foot in an Arctic Council meeting again]{.underline}. This
incidentally means that the ad hoc Arctic Five group, which includes the
five Arctic littoral states of the United States, Canada, Denmark,
Norway, and Russia and almost exclusively works at the ministerial
level, will become defunct. By contrast, the Arctic Council's six
working groups and scientific research operations are politically
insulated because they work at a technical level and are one layer
removed from political leadership.

### Arctic Council Fails\-\--General

#### The Arctic Council fails -- no real authority over the US and Russia and Indigenous voices aren't equally represented

Council", Institute of Current World Affairs,

Motzfeldt is taking on an extraordinarily difficult diplomatic position.
Today, [[the Arctic Council]{.underline}]{.mark} is still a
last-standing bastion of high North diplomacy, but it [[may be
entering]{.mark} its [most treacherous phase yet]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[As part of its founding principles, [its agreements are both
**consensus-based** and **unenforceable**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} That
means [it [requires extreme]{.mark} levels of discourse, [cooperation
and goodwill to]{.mark} continue its [work---all]{.mark} of which remain
[on thin ice]{.mark}]{.underline}. Today, the future of Arctic climate
science, along with projects from search and rescue to contamination
clean-up hang in the balance of a forum that, just two years ago, seemed
to be reaching its twilight. And [[some fear Greenland]{.mark}'s rookie
chairship [is **under-prepared** for]{.mark} the precarious task of
[keeping Russia and the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[cooperative]{.mark}]{.underline} [in an increasingly]{.underline}
(excuse the pun) [polarized high North]{.underline}.

"This is not only a question of who leads, but also of how Greenland
will handle the diplomatic challenges of chairing the council," Arctic
Council expert Svein Vigelund Rottem wrote in a 2024 paper that explored
the possibility of a Greenlandic chairship. "Norway's transition of the
chairship in 2023 was a diplomatic masterpiece, and Greenland will need
similar skill."

The idea of "polar peace" was, in fact, dreamed up by the Soviet Union's
last leader. On October 1, 1987, Mikhael Gorbachev stood on a stage in
Murmansk, Russia, and called to end the Arctic era of spies and nuclear
submarines, and form a unified front of "peace, science and prosperity."

In what is now considered a key prelude to the fall of the Iron Curtain,
he outlined six goals: to de-militarize the Arctic, ban high North
nuclear testing, facilitate research exchanges, peacefully collaborate
over resource development, safeguard the interests of its Indigenous
peoples, and protect its ever-more fragile environment. For Gorbachev,
the collective need to better understand and protect the high North
environment represented a rare opportunity.

"The main thing is to conduct affairs so that the climate here is
determined by the warm Gulfstream of the European process and not by the
Polar chill of accumulated suspicions and prejudices," he said at the
time. "Let the North of the world, the Arctic, be a zone of peace."

The 11th Arctic Council Ministerial Meeting in Rovaniemi, Finland in
2019 was the final in-person and open meeting before the pandemic and
Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Many have since questioned the
strength and legitimacy of the consensus-based forum (Jouni Porsanger,
Finland Foreign Affairs Ministry)

At the time, the Euro-Arctic region was one of the world's most
militarized regions. At the top of the planet, where "the frontiers come
close to one another," as Gorbachev said, the sheer physical proximity
of enemy territories had turned the region into a concentrated military
theater. By the 1970s, extensive radar networks dotted frigid scapes
from Greenland to Siberia, and the Barents Sea swarmed with ballistic
missiles, bombers and battleships. In the 1980s, both Soviet and
American navies introduced a potentially destructive high North fleet:
nuclear submarines built to pass under ice caps, armed with missiles
capable of reaching targets on opposite sides of the planet.

In September 1996, representatives from the eight polar states and six
Indigenous organizations convened a first-of-its-kind forum in Ottawa to
make Gorbachev's vision a reality. Two structural mechanisms make the
Arctic Council unique:

First, it began as a research and data collection effort, and became the
first international monitoring initiative to also include strong policy
recommendations. Its data-to-policy connection has helped set global
agendas: From pollution regulation to shipping codes, legally binding
international conventions have built their foundations on its work.

Second, because the group is not treaty-based, it is the sole
international body of its kind that includes Indigenous stakeholders.
That has enabled a still-singular diplomatic forum that gives Indigenous
leaders an equal seat at the table.

Science precedes, and undergirds, the council's work. In 1991, just
after the fall of the Iron Curtain, the Arctic states convened for the
first-ever Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy, a non-binding
agreement to identify and prevent contamination from nuclear waste to
persistent organic pollutants. In 2005, the scientists of the Arctic
Monitoring and Assessment Programme (AMAP) contributed the first-ever
"Arctic Assessment" section of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) report---which established for the first time that the
Arctic is changing faster than the rest of the world. Five years later,
the success of that scientific cooperation led to the Ottawa meeting.

Paradoxically[, high North [climate change]{.mark} has also
[attracted]{.mark} growing [geopolitical
competition]{.mark}]{.underline}. Just as this melting region becomes
more vulnerable, it's [opening up resource extraction, shipping and
other economic opportunities---and [global superpowers are jockeying for
control]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 2007, the Arctic sea ice shelf
collapsed. The same year, Russian explorers planted their national flag
in the North Pole seabed, widely taken as a symbolic claim to Arctic
energy. Back in 2009, the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration reported that high North melt would expose up to 40
million new tons of oil and gas by 2020.

The developments sparked new interest in the Arctic Council, too. It was
once an obscure organization, the kind of place you put aging diplomats
out to pasture, experts have told me. In the past decade or so, however,
non-Arctic states have vied to be added as "observers" that offer
funding and attend meetings. In 2013, the Arctic Council added six new
"observer states": China, Japan, India, Italy and South Korea. Over
nearly three decades, this research-focused forum became a key
diplomatic stage, and, because influence can be gained through funding
research, geopolitical interests actually benefited scientific aims. In
2022, the council was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. Weeks later,
its suspension went into effect.

Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev spoke in the Arctic city of Murmansk in
1987 calling for an end to high North tension and militarization. Many
credit his speech, in which he envisioned the region as one of "peace,
science and prosperity," as the originating idea behind the Arctic
Council (Vladimir Vyatkin, Wikimedia Commons)

Judging the success of the council's past two years is a matter of
perspective. Compared to most other chairships, very little work was
done. Yet many call Norway's real work a masterclass in diplomacy. But
because Russia is half of the geographical Arctic, and still isn't
allowed to collaborate on most of the science, others contend the
so-called "Arctic Council" isn't truly "Arctic."

Science powered the diplomacy that formed the Arctic Council. Now, the
future of crucial climate science depends on the strength of diplomatic
agreements. It's not just about sharing data; to use another team or
nation's data for your own models, you need a lot more information,
including the instruments used, how they were calibrated and even the
way you decide to input values in a spreadsheet. All that requires the
kind of open channels of communication the Arctic Council's projects
simply haven't had. Under Norway's chairship, things were moving in the
right direction, however: Just two months ago, AMAP published its
first-ever report since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The data was
incomplete, but the science, at least, wasn't entirely halted by
geopolitics.

\* \* \*

This year, [[the Arctic Council]{.mark} is [grappling with]{.mark} yet
another problem child, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}.
That isn't exactly new, as I've learned talking to Nordic experts.
[[From]{.mark} the George W. [Bush]{.mark} administration [to
Trump]{.mark}'s first term, Arctic states have previously seen
themselves [caught between two unpredictable
superpowers]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"[**[Nothing happens if the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and Russia
don't want it to]{.mark}**, and [neither of them feel]{.mark} the [rules
apply to them]{.mark} in the same way]{.underline}," Michael Paul,
senior researcher at the German Institute for International and Security
Affairs, told me.

[The [council's first existential threat came]{.mark} [from the
West]{.mark} before Russia invaded Ukraine]{.underline}. It was in 2019
at the Arctic Council Assembly in Rovaniemi, Finland, when [US Secretary
of State Mike [Pompeo]{.mark} went off-script by calling his own news
conference]{.underline}. He proceeded to deliver a fiery speech about
the rising threat from China, and [re[fused to sign]{.underline}]{.mark}
[onto [a]{.mark} joint [declaration that listed climate change as
a]{.mark} key [priority]{.mark}]{.underline}. Typically, [[council work
can't move forward without all]{.mark} stakeholders
[co-signing]{.mark}]{.underline}. In an act of improvisation, then-chair
Finland salvaged the situation by publishing the intended "joint
declaration" as a statement from the chair. It was unconventional but
managed to keep the council afloat.

Still, such moments [[reveal]{.mark} the [Westphalian assumptions
undergirding the council]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Technically,
Indigenous "permanent participants" are considered equal stakeholders to
nation-states. But the [political jockeying]{.mark} between the states
often **[overshadows]{.mark}** the [**interests** of Indigenous
peoples]{.mark}]{.underline}. (As [[one Sami
politician]{.mark}]{.underline} who asked not to be named [told me, "[We
have a seat]{.mark} at the table. That [**doesn't** mean]{.mark} [we
have a voice]{.mark}]{.underline}.") [[When]{.mark} the seven
non-Russian [Arctic states agreed to suspend]{.mark} council
[activities]{.mark}]{.underline} rather than cooperate with Russia [in
2022, the six Indigenous [permanent participants]{.mark} said they [had
**not been consulted**]{.mark} about the decision]{.underline}. But the
suspension deeply affected them because many of their challenges
transcend state borders and often rely on the council's transboundary
work.

### Russia Says No

#### Russia won't cooperate with the Arctic Council -- amended national strategy to remove references to cooperation

Malte **Humpert**, 20**23**, Senior Fellow and Founder of The Arctic
Institute. His research focuses on Arctic geopolitics, Northern Sea

Policy Prioritizing 'National Interest' and Removing Cooperation Within

https://www.highnorthnews.com/en/russia-amends-arctic-policy-prioritizing-national-interest-and-removing-cooperation-within-arctic

The [[hopes for cooperation with Russia in the Arctic continue to
cool]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Days after a U.S. diplomat stated that
cooperation with Russia in the Arctic was now virtually impossible, [the
Kremlin published]{.mark} [amendments to]{.mark} its [Arctic
policy]{.mark}.]{.underline} President Putin signed the decree earlier
this week on 21 February.

The [updated document places [greater emphasis on Russian national
interests]{.mark} in the region [and **removes**]{.mark} specific
**[mentions for cooperation within the Arctic
Council]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

While the [original policy, published in March 2020, called for the
"strengthening of good neighborly relations with the Arctic
states"]{.underline} in the fields of economic, scientific, cultural and
cross-border cooperation the [amended version removes the above
section]{.underline} and instead [calls for the "development of
relations with foreign states on a bilateral basis, \[...\] taking into
account the national interests of the Russian Federation in the
Arctic.]{.underline}"

\[Image Omitted\]

Original wording of Russia's State Arctic Policy to 2035 published in
March 2020. (Source: Kremlin)

The [amended text also [removes mentions of]{.mark} "the framework of
[multilateral]{.mark} regional [cooperation]{.mark} [formats,
**including the Arctic Council**]{.mark}]{.underline}, the coastal
Arctic \"five\" and the Council of the Barents Euro-Arctic Region."

In the original policy the section on international cooperation, placed
significant emphasis on work within "multilateral regional cooperation
formats\" for the purpose of building up economic, scientific and
technological, as well as cultural cooperation. It did not make any
mention of prioritizing Russian national interests.

In contrast, [the wording of the revised document now [places]{.mark}
the country's national [interests in the Arctic ahead]{.mark} of work
towards economic, scientific and technological, and cultural
[cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Just last week, U.S. military leaders emphasized that the Arctic was now
Russia's number one priority.

\[Image Omitted\]

Updated wording of Russia's State Arctic Policy to 2035 amended on 22
February 2023. (Source: Kremlin)

Independence from western technology

The updated version also [places a greater [emphasis on]{.mark} Russian
[self-reliance]{.mark} in the region]{.underline}. It calls for ensuring
"[import [independence of]{.mark} the [shipbuilding]{.mark}
complex]{.underline}," clearly a response to western sanctions which
have affected Russia's ability to order and purchase ice-capable gas and
oil tankers at foreign shipyards.

The amended version of the policy calls for the "development and
modernization of shipbuilding and ship repair facilities for the
construction and maintenance of ships navigating in the waters of the
Northern Sea Route."

In terms of energy supply for population centers and industrial
facilities along the NSR the policy now calls for the [[use of
**domestically-built**]{.mark} "low-power [nuclear power
plants]{.mark}]{.underline}."

The first such facility, the floating nuclear power plant Akademik
Lomonosov was towed through the Baltics and up the Norwegian coastline
in 2018 to the Arctic town of Pevek to supply electrical power and
residential heat.

"[We [do not anticipate]{.mark} that [Russia]{.mark} will [change its
behavior]{.mark} anytime soon]{.underline}."

U.S. State Department official Derek Chollet

A reaction to U.S. Comments?

The [[changes to]{.mark} Russia's [state Arctic
policy]{.mark}]{.underline} and the specific removal of cooperation in
the Arctic Council [[come]{.mark} just a week [after U.S. State
Department official]{.mark} Derek Chollet, [explained]{.mark} that [the
U.S. will resume]{.mark} [some activity in the Arctic Council sans
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"Unfortunately, we do not anticipate that Russia will change its
behavior anytime soon. Adjusting to this new reality forced upon us by
Moscow, we [resume the Arctic Council\'s projects not involving
Russia]{.underline}," he stated at the Wilson Center's Polar Institute
last week.

"[[Moscow\'s decision to invade]{.mark} its neighbor]{.underline}, an
independent and sovereign state, [[makes cooperation **virtually
impossible**]{.underline}]{.mark} for \[the\] foreseeable future."

The change to its Arctic policy comes during the same week as Russia
announced the suspension of the START nuclear arms treaty with the U.S.

#### Russia prefers [bilateral]{.underline} cooperation over the Arctic Council \*maybe perm do both for science diplomacy\*

[[A year into the war]{.mark} with Ukraine, Russian president Vladimir
[Putin presented a new Foreign Policy Concept]{.mark}]{.underline}
(FPC), [an outline of Russia's national interests]{.underline},
strategic goals, challenges, a[nd main directions of foreign
policy]{.underline}, which had last been updated in 2016. The new FPC
emphasizes Arctic policy in commitments to "counteracting the unfriendly
states' policy aimed at militarization of the region" and "establishing
a mutually beneficial cooperation with the non-Arctic states pursuing a
constructive policy toward Russia." [These [statements signal
Russia's]{.mark} strategic [interest in maintaining]{.mark} a [formal
presence on the Arctic Council]{.mark} to preserve its political power
in the Arctic [while testing new **bilateral partnerships**]{.mark} in
the region]{.underline}.

[Russia's [current inclination toward bilateral **rather than**
multilateral cooperation, coupled with China's]{.mark}
[ambitions]{.mark} for the region, [could **set back the Arctic
Council**]{.mark}'s work to build up necessary health security and
cooperation networks.]{.underline}

Global health priorities in the FPC suggest Russia's continuing interest
in international discussions, but with variations in focus across
regions. The document links global health to environmental protection
and climate change, and goals include "increasing efficiency of
international cooperation in the area of health care and preventing its
politicization," as well as "consolidating international efforts in
order to prevent the extension of dangerous infectious diseases" and
quickly responding to crises, epidemics, and pandemics. Russia remains a
member of the World Health Organization (WHO) and is active in
convenings related to WHO's International Health Regulations and the
pandemic accord led by its Intergovernmental Negotiating Body.

It is significant, however, that [[neither of the FPC's agendas]{.mark}
for health or the Arctic [refers to]{.mark} the existing international
platforms---WHO and [the Arctic Council---for maintaining multilateral
cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The [[lack of mention]{.underline}]{.mark} of multilateral platforms
[[is **notable** alongside]{.mark} a joint Russian-Chinese political
statement]{.underline} in March 2023---timed closely with the
presentation of the Russian FPC---declaring the two countries'
intentions to act "in favor of preserving the Arctic as a territory of
peace, stability, and constructive cooperation." Though China has no
territorial claim in the Arctic, its plans for a Polar Silk Road via
Arctic waters to Europe, which is included in its Belt and Road
Initiative, indicate a vision for leadership in the region. Official
dialogue on the Arctic between Moscow and Beijing began in 2013. The
cooperation has produced two large Arctic energy infrastructure projects
and a memorandum of understanding between the two countries on maritime
law enforcement in the Arctic zone.

Russia's current inclination toward bilateral rather than multilateral
cooperation, coupled with China's ambitions for the region, could set
back the Arctic Council's work to build up necessary health security and
cooperation networks among all Arctic states and peoples. We think the
situation calls for consideration of new mechanisms for dialogue around
emerging climate and health threats in the region.

The entangled future of the Arctic, global health, and science diplomacy

[[As geopolitical and military instability]{.mark} abuts nonmilitary
humanitarian pursuits, [Arctic states may be]{.mark} [forced to allocate
resources to **protecting individual interests**]{.mark}]{.underline}
over supporting scientific cooperation. However, in other periods of
tension, science diplomacy has been key to preserving cooperation
between allies and rivals, as with the Pugwash Conferences on Science
and World Affairs, the Edinburgh Conversations, Cold War--era polio
vaccine cooperation, and the international effort to sequence
SARS-CoV-2.

[[With the Arctic]{.mark} region [in a precarious position]{.mark}, now
may be the time to move beyond traditional forms of diplomacy and center
the pursuit of alternative means of scientific cooperation]{.underline}
around health and climate security as a unifying purpose for continued
engagement.

An important component of any effective international science
collaboration is the personal relationships cultivated between
scientists from around the world, often nurtured over decades. [[To
preserve]{.mark} those [relationships under an Arctic Council with
diminished capacity]{.mark}]{.underline}, we [[recommend]{.mark} Western
policym[akers]{.mark} and other stakeholders [engage in bilateral
initiatives extending **beyond the Arctic Council
framework**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

As the discussion above suggests, [the [web of Arctic governance is

remaining settings [**lack** inclusive **membership**, argumentative
'clout' or geographical scope to offer a viable
alternative]{.underline}. In the following section we argue that they
are increasingly marked by what has been referred to as a form of
medieval governance---that is, a 'system of overlapping authority and
multiple loyalty'. According to the global governance literature, the
universalistic claims of the nation-state, on the one hand, and the
global political economy, on the other, hold the system together.79 In
the case of the Arctic, we argue that it is the nation-state together
with the broader and more recent multidimensional notion of
'sustainability' that maintain the system. This argument should find
support among English School scholars who have identified sustainability
as a new and core primary institution of global politics.80 Importantly,
sustainability comprises more than the long-term use of resources,
speaking to issues of justice that encompass social, environmental and
economic dimensions.81 [As these dimensions need not align congruently,
questions of **sustainability** and **justice** might themselves become
a boundary object]{.underline}. Translated to the context of Arctic
governance, this means that while the two claims may make the governance
web resilient to rupture, they cannot be reconciled in a way that would
be conducive to creating collaborative boundary work suitable for
addressing the 'responsibility to freeze'. In their totality, [the
overlapping governance arrangements point towards diverse
loyaltie]{.underline}s. In other words, the competing duality that is
the hallmark of 'medievalness' is not conducive to efficient governance

Here, the [[NC and WNC]{.mark}, along with the NC(M), are cases in
point]{.underline}. The NC and WNC are [[**interparliamentary**
**bodies**]{.mark} founded in 1952 and 1985]{.underline}, respectively,
that both [[precede the **Arctic** **Council**]{.mark} by some
decades]{.underline}, while the executive-bound NC(M) was founded in 
1971. The latter's primary task is the coordination and development [of
joint policies in fields such as welfare, education, culture,
environment and research.]{.underline}82 Both interparliamentary and
intergovernmental arrangements proceed by consensus, with the NC
providing space for debate, while the NC(M) yields executive power. They
are an example of the difficulty of coherent, collaborative boundary
work and the diffusion of responsibilities that are primarily orientated
towards the benefit of the respective state.

Greenland, the Faroe Islands and Iceland are members of both the NC and
the WNC---organizations that are platforms for addressing common
challenges pertaining to politics, economics, culture and the
environment.83 Similarly, the WNC coordinates initiatives in the fields
of tourism, fisheries, renewable energy and research.84 Across both
forums, there are also links to EU institutions, even though the WNC
countries are sceptical of the EU's Common Fisheries Policy85 and
Greenland voted in 1985 to withdraw from the bloc.86 However, the three
entities' membership in the NC, the other members of which have closer
ties with the EU---whether as members of the bloc or of the European
Economic Area--- and therefore need to ensure their policies comply with
EU law, showcases the overlapping and intersecting forms of governance
that apply to the region. They are instances of collaborative yet also
competitive boundary work.

The [[**AEC** is another alternative **forum**]{.mark}, albeit one that
likewise showcases the medieval nature of **Arctic** boundary **work**
in that it is collaborative, yet with elements of competitiveness
stemming from particular **interests**]{.underline}. The AEC seeks to
promote economic development and cooperation in the region,87 making it
a collaborative partner by default. It reaches beyond the region by
maintaining links to the International Maritime Organization and the
World Economic Forum, serving a diverse membership from different
economic sectors. [[Responsibility regarding sustainable growth is a
core part of its agenda that plays out across several **working**
**groups**]{.mark} which [deal with infrastructure, telecommunications
and responsible resource development]{.mark}]{.underline}.88 As its
membership is not derived from political mandates but rather obtainable
through a fee, the AEC holds very little political capital, representing
the vested interests of its members. This is not to say that AEC members
harbour nefarious intentions, but they hardly represent civil society
more broadly. It is conceivable that AEC members' understanding of
sustainability is based on a shorter time horizon than that perceived in
other forums that need to take a longer perspective. This may curtail
its interest in engaging questions over the 'responsibility to freeze'
that extend to Arctic communities more broadly.

Finally, one of the sites most conducive in terms of collaborative
boundary work is the Arctic conference circuit. In particular, the ACA
and AF are the standout events, taking place annually in Reykjavik and
Tromsø, respectively. Their mode of operation has been described as
'bazaar governance'89 because they bring together a broad range of
representatives from policy-making, science, Indigenous groups, civil
society and business. Lately, the ACA has expanded its activities into
spin-off forums, held in Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Greenland,
China, South Korea, the Faroe Islands and the United Kingdom. These
forums are evidence of the global reach of Arctic affairs. They are
further contextualized by a number of smaller events with a narrower
remit, such as the Arctic Science Summit Week, which brings together
scientists and policy-makers, or the Northern Lights Business and
Cultural Forum, which focuses on economic developments and cultural
exchanges. Beate Steinveg's research has shown how the meetings
contribute to shaping agendas and creating an inclusive approach to
Arctic governance.90 While these meetings promote dialogue and
cooperation, particularly around exchanging knowledge, and though the
informality may be conducive to seeking novel solutions to the pressing
issue of climate change and other socio-economic challenges, the
conference circuit has limited power to actually create binding
policies.91 Though the relatively close-knit and closed-off nature of
the specialist circle of experts at these events affords trust-building
and networking advantages, it also creates disadvantages concerning the
potential for groupthink and the exclusion of marginalized voices.92 As
befits a 'bazaar' and in line with the metaphor of medievalism, the
conference circuit resembles a rather large specialist circle in which
the cacophony of voices does not convincingly add up to a coherent
whole, as it lacks a centralizing authority. This is not to say that
such development is impossible, but it is unclear whether a
self-organizing, coherent system will emerge 'from within'---and in time
to allocate an effective 'responsibility to freeze'. Conclusion: the
short-term future of Arctic governance

[[While the Arctic Council]{.mark} is certainly the [most prominent
forum]{.mark} for Arctic governance in the region]{.underline}, and
while current geopolitics surely influences how this forum and others
will operate in the coming years, the good news for governance in the
region is that [[a **myriad** of **different platforms** for dialogue
and cooperation are already in place]{.mark}. Allowing for collaborative
boundary work, these [platforms are **interstate** and
**intergovernmental**]{.mark}]{.underline}, involving a large number of
civil society, local and Indigenous actors, which [[enables a continued
discussion about projects]{.mark} that span a broad range of social,
economic and cultural activities]{.underline}. As the article has
illustrated, this 'medieval' network and the collaborative boundary
practices connecting it---clearly exceeding the work of the AC's working
groups---make Arctic governance fairly resilient. Yet, the network's
'medievalness' also comes at the cost of effectiveness, which ultimately
bears down on who should hold the 'responsibility to freeze'.

In the coming years, [[these different **platforms** might increase in
importance]{.underline}]{.mark}. Some of the [[**authority** and powers
that were invested in the **AC**]{.mark} by the Arctic 8 could [shift to
these]{.mark} inter-parliamentary, [intergovernmental, civilian or
scientific sites of **conversation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. They might
even [[retain some of the **circumpolar** **communicative** and
**collaborative** **boundary-working capacity** that characterized the
region **prior** **to** the war in **Ukraine**]{.underline}]{.mark}.93
On a positive note, despite the long-term uncertainty of the forums,
this shift means that [[important **projects** around climate change
research]{.mark}, but also socio-political and socio-economic
development, can continue or be **initiated**]{.underline}. The
potential disadvantage is that these forums have their own rules of
participation and decision-making; they lack some of the prominence and
political clout of the AC. This dispersion of authority comes with new
rules around who can access conversations and what policy suggestions
are brought forward by them---eminent questions that the third wave of
norm scholarship has started to address but that have not yet been
raised in connection with Arctic governance scholarship. The most
obvious actors to suffer from these changes are the Permanent
Participants, whose standing in the Council is not replicated in other
forums---because of either their rules of procedure or their lack of
comparable discursive reach. In relation to the web of Arctic governance
depicted in figure  1, the shift in authority would result in a
different nodal position. [The [future web might look quite
**different**]{.mark}]{.underline} from the one sketched in this
article. [It might even be [necessary to include new forums]{.mark} or
mention the many meeting places]{.underline} we did not include owing to
the format restrictions of this article---for example, the Arctic
Mayors' Forum or the Arctic Coast Guard Forum. On the global level,
states need to negotiate competing responsibilities, since even Arctic
states might regard some of the region's topics of concern as secondary
in their own list of priorities.94 Climate change is an existential
threat for Arctic inhabitants, but it is also a threat for societies
elsewhere, since climate feedback loops interact with other parts of the
planet. It is thus in the interest of humanity to collectively address
the question of the 'responsibility to freeze

The [most obvious solution seems to be the least realistic, namely

to include military security issues]{.underline}, and [this has

#### Security [discussions]{.underline} in the Arctic Council [politicize]{.underline} and [fragment]{.underline} it---[military]{.underline} disputes kill [diplomatic]{.underline} cooperation.

Security should be kept out of the Arctic Council\", Arctic Institute -

As geopolitical tensions grow in the rest of the world, the [[Arctic
Council remains an **effective** **forum**]{.mark} for international
cooperation between arctic states]{.underline}, including Russia and the
US. This is largely [[due to the members' **commitment** to keep the
forum **depoliticized**. Bringing **military** security **issues** into
the **Arctic** **Council**]{.mark} could [risk damaging the current
**cooperation** and coordination]{.mark} between arctic states and
indigenous communities on important issues such as climate change,
environmental issues, health, and scientific research.]{.underline}

When the [Arctic Council]{.underline} was established as a high level
forum in 1996, [the main goal was to enhance **cooperation** on
**environmental** **protection** and **sustainable** economic
**development** in the region]{.underline}. The Arctic Council [has
proved to be a **successful** **forum** for interstate cooperation in
the region]{.underline}, but as the geopolitical situation in the world
has changed some have argued that the Arctic Council is due for a
change. In a recent report by the Washington, D.C. based think tank
Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Heather Conley
presents a scenario in which the Arctic Council is redesigned into an
OSCE-like structure.1) Under this design, the Arctic Council would cover
three main areas---an economic dimension, a human dimension, and a
security dimension.

Although it is true that both the world and the Arctic looks different
today than in 1996, [[traditional **hard security** issues have been
left out]{.mark} of the Arctic Council [for]{.mark} [a
reason]{.mark}]{.underline}. In times [[when **tensions** between
**Russia** and the **West** are **rising**]{.mark} in the rest in the
world, it is [particularly **important** that these **tensions** do not
**spoil**]{.mark} one of the [few remaining **arenas** where these
countries still participate in **constructive
cooperation**]{.mark}]{.underline}; the Arctic. That being said, arctic
states must still be prepared to face the new security challenges that
are arising in the region.

A changing Arctic: economic resources and increased commercial activity
Environmental change is opening the region for increased economic,
military, and human activity. The Arctic is warming at twice the rate of
the rest of the world, affecting communities through melting sea ice,
thawing permafrost, and coastal erosion. The Arctic is believed to hold
vast amounts of undiscovered oil and gas resources, causing various
media outlets to predict a "race for the Arctic."2) While natural
resources are of great interest for arctic countries, exploration
activities have not lived up to these predictions. First of all, arctic
nations have expressed and practiced a commitment to international law
in the region. The most relevant legal regime is the UN Convention on
the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which governs who has the sovereign right
to explore and exploit marine resources. Countries that have begun
resource exploration and exploitation in the region, such as Norway,
Russia, and the US, have done so within their Exclusive Economic Zones
(EEZs). Secondly, most arctic resources are located in undisputed areas
of the Arctic. That is to say that, for the most part, these resources
can be found within the already settled EEZs of the arctic coastal
states. Thirdly, these resources are not easily accessible due to the
challenging geographic and climatic conditions, the large amounts of
initial capital required, and the high cost of extraction. This, coupled
with recent low oil prices, has caused many oil companies to pull out of
the Arctic. For instance, Shell pulled out of the Chukchi Sea after only
a month of exploratory drilling in the fall of 2015. Following this,
Statoil also pulled out of the Alaskan Arctic due to high costs and low
oil prices. Another aspect focusing attention on the Arctic region is
the possibility of transpolar shipping.3) The Northern Sea Route (NSR)
along the Russian coast, for example, reduces the sailing distance
between some ports in Asia and Europe by 40% compared to the route
through the Suez Canal. The reduced sailing distance has spurred
interest from Asian countries, and in the fall of 2015 China's biggest
shipping company COSCO announced plans to launch regular services along
the NSR.4) However, data shows that international shipping through the
NSR has decreased in the last few years.5) The navigation season of the
NSR is currently too short for investments in ice-class vessels to be
economically viable, and even Russian officials have stated that the NSR
cannot be an alternative to the Suez Canal. The NSR is nevertheless
essential for domestic shipping in Russia, and is expected to become
even more important in transporting Russian oil and gas. Although the
narrative of a race to the Arctic is incorrect, the changes in the
Arctic that are opening the region to increased commercial activity in a
harsh and remote environment require safety and security measures. The
extreme climatic situations combined with very limited satellite
communication---this is because the current orbital configurations limit
the effectiveness of communication satellites in the Arctic---require
that countries cooperate in order to ensure safe and secure activity in
the region. A changing geopolitical environment "Russia shows increased
willingness and ability to use a wide range of instruments to achieve
its political goals, and the modernization of its military powers
enhances the ability to influence, also in the High North"6), reads a
recent report by the Norwegian Intelligence Service. There is no doubt
that the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 has had a negative effect
on the general geopolitical climate between Russia and Western
countries. The sanctions regime is still intact and has been adopted by
all members of the Arctic Council, either through membership in the EU
or NATO. Additionally, the Russian military has been modernized during
the past decade. For example, since 2008 there has been a modernization
of the Russian Navy (particularly the Northern Fleet), a reopening of
military bases in the Arctic, large military exercises, and creation of
Arctic brigades and command centers. The re-establishment of military
infrastructure in the Russian Arctic has been a cause of concern,
especially for neighboring countries like Norway and the Baltic states.
Not least, the intervention in Ukraine, and recently in Syria, show that
Russia is a military power capable of going to war.

However, it can be argued that the [concerns over Russia's role in the
Arctic have been alarmist]{.underline} rather than alarming.7) First,
the [[**opening** of the Arctic region gives Russia a legitimate reason
for **modernizing** and **prioritizing** Arctic capabilities]{.mark} in
order to **secure** its **borders** and protect its **economic**
**activities** in the region]{.underline}. With increased commercial
activity in the region comes the need to prepare for threats such as
piracy, terrorist attacks, illegal fishing, and illegal arms
transportation. After the Cold War, the military bases in the Russian
Arctic were to a large extent abandoned and it is understandable that
the Russian government sees the need to modernize aging infrastructure.

Second, how much the Russian military activity in the Arctic has
increased over the last few years is up for discussion. According to the
head of the Norwegian Joint Command Headquarters Lieutenant General Haga
Lunde, "the situation in the High North is close to normal compared to
the activity of the last years."8) The US Department of State's Special
Representative for the Arctic, Admiral Papp has stated that "everything
we have seen them \[Russia\] doing so far, is lawful, considered and
deliberative. So we'll just continue monitoring it and not over-react to
it."9) It is also likely that the new focus on the intervention in
Syria, and the recent conflict with Turkey, will take the focus at least
partly away from the Arctic. Facing economic troubles, it will be
difficult for Russia to keep up military spending both in the Arctic and
elsewhere. Third, the climatic conditions make traditional forms of
warfare very difficult in the Arctic. Retired Chief of the Canadian
Defence Staff, Gen. Natynczyk said in 2009, "If someone were to invade
the Canadian Arctic, my first task would be to rescue them."10) While
neighboring states and their allies should monitor Russian capabilities
in the Arctic closely, it is incorrect to label these developments an
"Arctic problem." Russia's military modernization in the Arctic is part
of a larger Russian strategy as a global power and a more assertive
foreign policy. The West (NATO in particular) is naturally a big
obstacle for this strategy, and the military build-up in the Arctic is a
part of a general "balancing" act with NATO rather than specifically
related to the Arctic. This is also reflected in Russia's updated
national security strategy (2015)11), where the word "Arctic" is
mentioned only three times: once in connection to the region's
resources, once with regards to international cooperation, and once
describing the need for improved infrastructure. The foreign policy
focus lies on "consolidating the Russian federation's status as one of
the leading world powers." It also explicitly identifies the expanding
NATO as a threat to Russian national security and asserts that the US
and its allies are trying to contain Russia in order to maintain their
role in the world.12) Russia's willingness to cooperate with NATO
countries in the Arctic, however, suggests that it has a different view
of the West here than in other parts of the world.

The Arctic Council and Security

[A [**footnote** in the **Ottawa** **Declaration**]{.mark} establishing
the Arctic Council in 1996 [states that the Council should not deal with
matters related to **military** **security**]{.mark}]{.underline}.13) In
2008 the five Arctic coastal states (US, Canada, Russia, Norway and
Denmark) reaffirmed their commitment to the current institutional
framework in the Arctic through the Ilulissat Declaration, declaring
that they see "no need to develop a new comprehensive international
legal regime to govern the Arctic region."14) Additionally, the official
Arctic policies of all of the Arctic coastal states underline strong
commitment to international cooperation and law in the
region---including those of the US15) and Russia.

Despite the exclusion of military security, the Arctic Council has come
a long way in facing some of the softer security challenges, such as
environmental security and emergency preparedness in a region with
increasing commercial activity. This is exemplified by two important
legally binding agreements: the 2011 Search and Rescue Agreement and the
2013 Marine Oil Pollution Preparedness and Response Agreement. These
both clearly move into the realm of human and environmental security.
Additionally, in the fall of 2015, the eight Arctic states (including
Russia) established the Arctic Coast Guard Forum (ACGF) in order to
improve the response to coast guard missions in the region, such as
search and rescue, enforcement of regulations, and emergency response.
The ACGF is independent of the Arctic Council, but will complement
several of its working groups focusing on economic development and
environmental safety. Coast guards perform important military or
semi-military tasks in the region, such as national law enforcement and
upholding a naval presence. Although the ACGF faces many challenges, it
shows that the arctic states are able and willing to cooperate on
security issues with a clear military component even during turbulent
political times.16) Beyond specific tasks like search and rescue, the
ACGF will develop relationships and contribute to information sharing
that will ultimately work as a confidence building measure between the
Arctic states.

Is the Arctic Council immune from geopolitical tensions?

Following the Ukraine crisis there were some initial signs that the
Arctic Council was affected by the new geopolitical climate. In April
2014, Canada boycotted an Arctic Council meeting in Moscow due to
Russia's actions in Ukraine. However, it has been argued that this
incident is not convincing proof of a spillover effect.17) All other
meetings of the Arctic Council and its working groups and task forces
were held with all Arctic states present. The process of developing the
ACGF came to s standstill after the annexation of Crimea, as
representatives from Russia were not included in two expert meetings in
2014.18) The reality is that without Russia the Arctic Council or the
ACGF would be pointless, and would instead further contribute to the
tensions between Russia and the West. At the same time, Russia depends
on a positive relationship with other Arctic states---for example for
advancing economic development in the region.

[These [attempts to use the Arctic as a proxy for external geopolitical
**challenges**]{.mark} suggest that [bringing **hard** **security**
**issues** into the Arctic Council may be **counterproductive**]{.mark}.
By discussing or implementing [rules on **military** **conduct**]{.mark}
in the Arctic, [arctic states will face
**disagreements**]{.mark}]{.underline} that may [[**spill over** to
other important issues]{.underline}]{.mark} under the purview of the
Arctic Council. What will happen if some states do not abide by the
rules? Will possible sanctions contribute to [[further **exacerbating**
the **relationship** between western countries and
Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}?

### Unilat Good

#### Now is the time for [unilateral]{.underline} development---it pushes a [weakened]{.underline} Russia out of the region.

**Mcvicar '25** \[Daniel Mcvicar, 3-31-2025, \"What a Second Donald
Trump Administration Means for Arctic Security\", Diplomatist,
https://diplomatist.com/2025/03/31/what-a-second-donald-trump-administration-means-for-arctic-security/\]

While most media attention focuses on the future of Ukraine under the
next Trump administration, [[another more distant **region**]{.mark} is
[equally prone to **disruption**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In recent years,
the [[relative peace and obscurity]{.mark} of the High North that
[contributed to the theory of "**Arctic Exceptionalism**" has
**collapsed**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It has become abundantly clear that
the Arctic is not immune to geopolitical developments. [[The **Arctic**
**Council**]{.mark} -- best known for its environmental and search and
rescue partnerships]{.underline} between Canada, Denmark via Greenland,
Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the US -- has [[largely
**ceased** operations]{.mark} since the Russian invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline}. The [[decline of the Arctic
Council]{.underline}]{.mark}, paired with a rebalancing of Russian
forces away from the Arctic, [[offers a **historic** **opportunity** for
**US leadership** in the region.]{.underline}]{.mark}

What the War in Ukraine means for Russia's Arctic force posture

While [[Moscow has recently expanded]{.mark} its [military
presence]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Arctic by reopening several
Soviet-era bases and conducting large-scale military exercises, [it has
been [forced to **divert**]{.mark} the vast majority of its military
[**resources** to Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}. The battlefield in
Ukraine is inextricably linked to Russia's Arctic power projection.
While some of Russia's specialized assets, such as its icebreaker fleet,
obviously cannot be used in Ukraine, most of Russia's Arctic military
assets are fungible, and many have already been transferred to Ukraine.
According to a study by CSIS, Russian Arctic ground forces have
significantly deteriorated. It is reported that the 200th Motorized
Rifle Brigade, 61st Independent Naval Brigade, 80th Arctic Motor Rifle
Brigade, and the 76th Guards Air Assault Division have been involved in
combat in Ukraine.

\<\<IMAGES OMITTED\>\>

In addition to shifting military assets from the Arctic, [Moscow has had
to [**deprioritize** dual-use infrastructure
**improvements**]{.mark} planned to connect its many remote Arctic
outposts and forward bases]{.underline}. While Russia continues to claim
that it is increasing readiness of the Northern Fleet and ramping up
icebreaker production, this is doubtful given the immense resource drain
in Ukraine.\
Thus, the cessation of the war in Ukraine would likely lead to
heightened Russian power projection in the Arctic. This possibility is
reinforced by Finland and Norway's accession to NATO and increased
Russian anxiety about the vulnerability of its critical nuclear assets
in the Kola Peninsula. Therefore, the next administration's position on
the War in Ukraine will have important implications for the broader
Arctic region.

\<\<IMAGES OMITTED\>\>

How does Trump's election influence the future of the Arctic?

Trump's first term is the best time to evaluate how his next
administration will influence the Arctic. While some sources have argued
that a Trump administration is prone to aid Russia's oil and gas
interests because of the alleged "friendly relations" between Putin and
Trump, this notion can be easily dispelled. [Trump's [focus on energy
**dependence**]{.mark} will likely [provide a boon to American oil and
gas production in the Arctic at **Russia**'s
**expense**]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is supported by the 2019 US
Sanctions that targeted Russian deepwater Arctic drilling entities.
Trump's proposed energy sanctions in this term promise to be even more
sweeping and [no doubt [will **limit** Russia's desired **LNG**
expan]{.mark}sion.]{.underline} President Trump was a strong proponent
of closing European markets to Russian LNG in favor of US LNG exports.
Increasing US LNG supplies to Europe could prove to be a linchpin in the
cross-Atlantic alliance and could be pivotal in closing the oil and gas
loophole to the EU from which Russia has continued to profit. Moreover,
increased competition with China, which dominates the global rare earth
metals market, could lead to the US seeking new metal sources in the
largely untapped Arctic region.

While it is too early to tell who exactly will compose Trump's cabinet
over the next four years -- one fact is clear -- it will be stacked with
China hawks. Sanctions, secondary sanctions, tariffs, and non-tariff
barriers that the Trump administration could impose on China will
invariably affect Russia. Russia and China have rapidly accelerated
their economic integration and interdependence since the War in
Ukraine. The German Marshall Fund reports that Sino-Russian trade
turnover in 2023 exceeded \$240 Billion, and around 40% of Russian
imports came from China. Russia is even more dependent on China for
military technology. According to Carnegie, Russia has imported
approximately 90% of its dual-use technology from China since the onset
of Western Sanctions. Increased US semiconductor onshoring and limiting
chip exports to China will almost certainly cause short to long-term
disruptions to Russia's war economy. Sino-Russian economic and
geopolitical interdependence has bled into the Arctic domain, and the
next Trump administration will likely have heightened threat perceptions
of any move by China in the region. China's interest in the Arctic,
embodied by \$90 Billion in FDI, has already increased the salience of
the Arctic in DC. While many observers remain skeptical of a second
Trump Administration's commitment to NATO, some indicators point to
increased NATO cooperation in certain domains. In addition to the
promise of greater American LNG shipments to Europe, there has been a
perception shift toward China in many European capitals since the first
Trump Administration, which is more in line with the American threat
perception. In recent years, EU countries, from Lithuania to the Czech
Republic, have taken outwardly adversarial stances towards China.
Trump's unprecedented 2019 Huawei ban has been replicated across Europe
in recent years, with even Germany acceding to the ban by 2026.
Moreover, since the war in Ukraine, more EU countries than ever are
meeting their 2% defense spending commitment. Aligning EU and US threat
perceptions of the PRC offers the opportunity for more\
NATO integration.

Another domain where NATO integration is possible under the Trump
Administration is the trilateral ICE Pact with Canada and Finland. [The
[Trump]{.mark} Administration is likely to **[ramp up]{.mark}** the
previous administration's [effort to produce
icebreakers]{.mark}]{.underline}, and given the extremely limited and
costly production of icebreakers, it is pivotal for the US to expand its
involvement in the ICE Pact. This agreement utilizes the
state-of-the-art Helsinki Shipyard, which was responsible for building
some of Russia's most advanced icebreakers until it was acquired by a
Canadian company in 2023. [The ICE Pact offers the US **significantly**
lower overhead **costs**, cuts down on time, and reduces per-unit
production **costs** of icebreakers]{.underline} by sharing the burden
with other NATO partners. This plan of expanding icebreaker assets and
replacing the aging and limited existing icebreaker fleet fits neatly
into the Trump administration's goal of increasing the total number of
vessels and reversing the Navy's Doom Loop. Icebreakers are still the
most effective way to project power in the Arctic, [conduct freedom of
navigation operations]{.underline}, and [[protect US territorial
**claims** and commercial interests]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is pivotal
that the US close the gap between its icebreaker fleets and Russia's in
the upcoming decades.
