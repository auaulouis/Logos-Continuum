CARTOGRAPHY (MAPS AND MAPPING) Both literally and metaphorically, [maps
and mapping are dominant practices of colonial and post-colonial
cultures]{.underline}. [Colonization itself is often consequent on a
voyage of 'discovery', a bringing into being of 'undiscovered'
lands]{.underline}. The process of [discovery is reinforced by the
construction of maps,]{.underline} [whose existence is a means of
textualizing the spatial reality of the other,]{.underline} naming or
,in almost all cases, [renaming spaces in a symbolic and literal act of
mastery and control]{.underline}. In all cases [the lands so colonized
are **literally reinscribed**, written over,]{.underline} as [the names
and languages of the indigenes are replaced]{.underline} by new names,
[or are **corrupted** into new and Europeanized forms by the
cartographer]{.underline} and explorer. [This was a long-standing
feature of colonialism]{.underline} and not restricted to distant
unknown lands. Irish playwright Brian Friel graphically illustrates this
in Translations, which deals with [the mapping and renaming of the West
of Ireland by the English]{.underline} army in the nineteenth century,
[a process in which the native Irish (Gaelic) culture is literally
overwritten by English imperialism.]{.underline} [Maps also **inscribe
their ideology** on territory in numerous way]{.underline}s other than
place-names. [The blank spaces of early maps signify a literal **terra
nullius**, an open and inviting (**virginal**) space into which the
European imagination can project itself and]{.underline} into which [the
European (usually male) explorer must **penetrate**]{.underline}. Such
[blank spaces invite other cultural superscriptions, such as the
elaborately drawn monsters and **sub-human wild-men** (savages) of most
early maps]{.underline}. Imaginative transferences are frequent. Thus
[early maps of Australia]{.underline} (Terra Incognita or Terra
Incognita Australis as it was known in the seventeenth century when the
first European maps of the northern coast-line were drawn) [show an
interior populated by elephants and pygmies]{.underline}. Similarly [the
so-called cannibals of the Indies]{.underline} (a term derived from the
corruption of the Spanish name for the Carib peoples) [appear frequently
on maps of the interior of Africa]{.underline}. Indeed[,]{.underline} by
the early twentieth century, the term is almost synonymous with Africans
in popular literature and humour, as witness the numerous cartoons that
represent cannibals as black people with bones through their noses
roasting missionaries in a pot. [The fictionality of the narratives of
such processes of 'discovery', which the process of mapping objectifies,
is emphasized by the role of the native guide in such explorations, who
leads the explorer]{.underline} to the interior. [The prior knowledge of
the land that this dramatizes, and which **cannot be wholly silenced**
in the written accounts of these explorations, **is ignored, and
literally silenced** by the act of mapping]{.underline}, [since the
indigenous people **have no voice** or even presence that can be heard
in the new discourse of scientific measurement and written texts that
cartography implies.]{.underline} [They figure, if at all, only as
illustration -- savages, cannibals or monsters. The allegorization of
space (and its hierarchization) is also defined by maps, first by the
decision as to which projection to favour,since this privileges some
land-spaces over others]{.underline}; or [by the decision to orient all
maps on a North--South axis]{.underline}; or [by the creation of a body
of special maps that divide the land into such 'objective' categories as
climatic regions, population densities and, not least, natural
resources.]{.underline} [Maps can also serve as (allegorical) **tools of
exploitation**]{.underline}.In his analysis of Mercator's Atlas, José
Rabasa (1993) demonstrates how [the projection map became a major **tool
of Euro-centrism**, defining European latitudes as pivotal reference
points for the conception of a **world hierarchy**,]{.underline} and
[embodying as geographical fact European attitudes about]{.underline}
the nature of [the world]{.underline}. In effect, [the European map
created]{.underline} what has remained [the contemporary geographical
world reality.]{.underline} [The definition of cultures as tropical in a
world where temperate is the norm]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} as
[densely populated or thinly populated]{.underline},[or]{.underline} as
[resource rich or poor]{.underline}, [are essential discriminations upon
which]{.underline} a practice of [exploitation or **control** can be
erected]{.underline}. That [these techniques also feature in such modern
controlling **discourses as 'development'**]{.underline} studies
[illustrates how persistently the sciences of cartography and mapping
have contributed to the establishment and reestablishment of the
**various world orders**]{.underline} of the last few centuries.
[Although ethnography]{.underline} (the supposedly objective scientific
description of 'primitive'peoples and cultures) [has frequently borne
the brunt of anti-colonial attacks]{.underline} as being the principal
intellectual discourse of colonization, [it is worth noting that
geography and geographers,and the science of **cartography, played at
least as important a role in** underpinning the objects and values of
**the colonial enterprise**]{.underline}. The Royal Geographical Society
was a prime mover in the imperial conquests of the 'undiscovered'
regions of the world, and it is significant that as Kipling's Kim
illustrates (the cover of the Head of the Secret Service in that text,
Creighton Sahib, is that of the Director of the General Survey of
India), [**the colonial mapper** and surveyor **was** frequently **the
most ubiquitous figure of imperial control**.]{.underline}

> [The territory no longer precedes the map, **nor does it survive
> it**]{.underline}. It is nevertheless [the map that precedes the
> territory]{.underline} -- precession of simulacra -- that engenders
> the territory. (Baudrillard Citation1995, 1)

[Baudrillard's theory]{.underline} of the precession of simulacra that
engenders the territory [highlights Said's notions of geography as a
colonial construct.]{.underline} [Cartography, one of the key concepts
in postcolonial studies, constitutes a significant part of Arctic and
African colonial narratives. Imperial powers have shown great interest
in cartography and charting maps as **manifestations of domination** and
material gain]{.underline}. The [imperial enterprise portrays maps as
parchments with vacant spaces awaiting a **glorious imperial
flag**]{.underline} to give them meaning, identity, and culture.
Canadian and British fiction frequently features maps with several
goals. According to Graham Huggan (Citation1994), featuring maps in
Canadian literature shows the close relationship between historical
development and geographical discovery and allows writers to come to
terms with and celebrate the rediscovery of their country. Maps, seen by
Huggan as a product and a process, because [the map "does not restrict
itself to the decoding of the model, but also involves itself in the
further recoding of the modelling system"]{.underline} (4), are
reflected in Elce and Conrad's texts in nearly identical ways. In one of
the letters imagined by Elce, Jane Franklin starts recollecting her
memories with her husband, mentioning their "old map of London" (Elce
Citation2018, 29) and reminiscing about how they drew the lines of their
travels, with the "routes in and out of the city almost soaked through
with ink" (29). Lady Franklin's use of the map as a compass for her
memories and the couple's sense of geographical imperative is indicative
of imperial ontology. Their map, in this case, is reflective of what
Huggan calls [the "dialectic between the formulation of the map, during
which the real world is concentrated in model form, and the
implementation of the map, during which the model is tested against
reality"]{.underline} (Citation1994, 4). Lady Franklin's and her
husband's act of tracing their travels reflects the process of testing
the map's abstract model against their lived experiences. The ink-soaked
routes symbolize how their personal memories and physical journeys are
inscribed onto the map, transforming it from a mere representation of
London into a record of their experiences, thus highlighting the
relationship between the conceptual model of the map and its real-world
application. [Similarly, the imperial venture of finding the Northwest
Passage was all about geography,]{.underline} although John Franklin's
map towards the Northwest Passage represented a model that could not be
implemented when tested against reality.

The [North in its entirety can be considered a colonial and militarised
territory, where]{.underline}, nowadays, [decolonial initiatives have
arisen]{.underline}. Among these, several are [rooted in
mapping]{.underline}. [Cartography has been forced upon the land in such
violent ways that the only way forward is to overthrow the practice
itself.]{.underline} Settler colonialism is not only a political issue;
it also consists in imposing a way of thinking (considered superior)
which devalues and replaces Indigenous cultural practices and
ontologies. [Maps determine the locations of the centre and the fringes,
as well as the ways in which the land is occupied]{.underline}. As
[historically strategic tools]{.underline}, they [make it possible to
claim an entire territory without even setting foot on it]{.underline}.
The [Rupert's Land treaties and]{.underline} the [monopolies held
by]{.underline} the major [colonial companies]{.underline}, such as the
Hudson's Bay Company's hold over what is now the Canadian North, for
instance, [gave precedence to the authority of the word]{.underline} --
by the power vested in me, I hereby declare [that this land belongs to
such and such -- over physical occupation.]{.underline} As Bernard
Nietschmann puts it, '\[[m\]ore indigenous territory has been claimed by
maps than by guns']{.underline} (1994, 37). Indeed, [Europeans took
possession of territories before they set out to explore
them.]{.underline} [Maps are agents of this power and replace the
experience of roaming the land with a cartographic abstraction that will
later serve as proof of property,]{.underline} for instance during
subsequent territorial negotiations. Furthermore, [maps thwart
toponymy]{.underline}, [replacing it]{.underline} sometimes [with the
settler's lexicon, and]{.underline} at other times, rather cynically,
with [something like 'great white expanse', signalling the unknown
(rather than]{.underline} admitting [ignorance]{.underline}) [and
emptiness]{.underline} [(in lieu of acknowledgement]{.underline}). In
the Americas, this [imperialist cartographic violence denies any
recognition of prior Indigenous presence, as acknowledging it would
negate the very vocabulary that Europeans used to claim the
land]{.underline}: 'the New World', 'New England', 'New France', 'the
discovery of America', 'the founding of Canada'. [To allow for the
conqueror's gesture, Indigenous toponymy must be silenced.]{.underline}
This [cartographic overwriting leads to the silencing not only of place
names, but also of prior cultures and practices]{.underline}. [Maps
render the land -- an]{.underline} [essential]{.underline} and concrete
element [for Indigenous cultures]{.underline} -- [abstract,
dematerialising it]{.underline} [and devaluing its empirical
understanding]{.underline}, favouring sedentary life over nomadism.
Geographer and linguist Louis- Edmond Hamelin, who advocated for a
'geography of the feet', calling for trajectories, experiences, and
field observations, writes that '[such condescending behaviour can only
serve to distort the perception of facts]{.underline} on the ground'
(Hamelin, Chartier, and D.sy 2013, 41).3 [For peoples under colonial
rule who]{.underline} still have to [live with the performative efforts
of colonial maps within their governance]{.underline}, such as the Inuit
and the Sámi, [overthrowing cartographic perspectives is a way to
transform the political order.]{.underline}

#### Treating the Arctic as a land for the US to explore and develop are rooted in a Eurocentric history of colonialism, which homogenizes the Arctic and creates the preconditions for colonial and hierarchical violence

A contemporary of Herodotus, **[the lyric poet Pindar penned these words
during the fifth century BC in an ode to the fabled]{.underline}**
Ὑπερβόρε(ι)οι, or **[Hyperboreans. To the Ancient Greeks, these were a
mythical people who lived beyond the North Wind in a fabulous landscape
of eternal spring, sunlight, and warmth. For them, light perpetual was
cast onto a land of enlightenment, devoid of shadow and full of
possibility.]{.underline}** Indeed, Nietzsche later invokes Pindar's
stanzas to argue that we are all Hyperboreans in that we seek out,
through solitude, a philosophical, hermeneutical happiness -- 'another
beginning', as he suggests -- in order to overcome the decadence and
malady of the modern individual.2 **[While contemporary imaginations of
the Arctic may have turned cooler and darker since the time of the
Greeks, the region continues to be mythologized as an unknown,
inaccessible, and forbidden land, a remote, wild, and often 'othered'
frontier. As an aggregate territory and a phantasy of the public
consciousness, there has been a drive to essentialize this diverse,
contested space in a way that heavily glosses over the complex
geopolitical, (trans)national, cultural and linguistic distinctions that
define it. Its history entangled with various cultural and ideological
representations, the Arctic is disputed as an idea as much as a broad
topographical description we use to orient ourselves.]{.underline}** It
is not merely that the alterities we ascribe to this part of the world
are socially, culturally, and historically embedded. It is that the
Arctic's multiple landscapes -- and its aesthetic, cultural, political,
economic and scientific interests -- are all inexorably intermeshed with
one another.3 Perhaps it is this seduction towards a unifying
singularity that draws in those who seek in the Arctic some measure of
inspiration. **[For if the Arctic has been a space for ideological
projections, it has also served as a physical nexus for thought and
experimentation, creativity and artistry, engagement and collaboration,
excitement and adventure -- for artists, writers, thinkers, scholars,
explorers and travellers. Many journeys North are constructed and
portrayed as odysseys towards self and truth, movements mobilized by the
poetic potential of exploration, both to the ends of the Earth and the
innards of the soul.]{.underline}**4 **[The Arctic's reluctant,
disorienting, and alienating fictional and factual landscapes, whether
characterized by remoteness, loneliness or vulnerability, also hold an
immense power to encourage the bridging of boundaries, categories, and
discourses.]{.underline}** Creative work conceived of in this region and
by its peoples -- or, indeed, through both -- can challenge dominant
analytic and interpretive frameworks, and question prototypical
conceptualizations and beliefs about extreme spaces, and about the
humans (and non-humans) who inhabit them. **[And yet, for many external
observers, the Arctic today is extreme no longer: it is tamed, and more
accessible than ever.]{.underline}** Two thousand five hundred years
ago, Pindar wrote that 'never on foot or ship could you explore the
marvelous road to the feast of the Hyperboreans'.5 Today, Ryanair flies
there direct. **[Changes (climatic, social, commercial) across the
region have further enabled this contested space to exist beyond mere
imagination, promising new access to new people. Encounters with the
Arctic are being re-envisioned today given the increased accessibility
of travel and mobility. This is due not just to us bearing witness to
the materialization of anthropogenic climate change, nor to what has
been called -- in deliberate reference to another colonial hot potato --
a 'scramble'6 for the Arctic, nor yet to new forms of travel and tourism
cropping up in various pockets of the region. It is also due to the
paradox that the more we are empowered to move closer to landscapes and
experiences that defamiliarize us from what we know in our everyday
lives, the more we seek to imagine new unfamiliarities.]{.underline}**
This issue of Moving Worlds is the outcome of a series of talks convened
by Arctic Encounters: Contemporary Travel/Writing in the European High
North, a collaborative and multidisciplinary HERA-funded research
project that explores the ways in which a changing Arctic changes ideas
not just about travel, but about the planet and its inhabitants more
broadly. **[The Arctic itself is very much a moving world. It has come
to stand for much more than its own landscapes. Movement here is an apt
metaphor for a globalizing topography in which immobility becomes more
and more anomaly: we move the Earth (with our chlorofluorocarbons,
fracking and terraforming); the Earth moves us (through its retreating
ice and rising waters). And indeed, if recent scholarly and public
debates around the Anthropocene are any measure, such movements mobilize
us into political and environmental action. Amid this, old contests over
control of Arctic resources and occupation of its territories resurface
as increasingly urgent social issues, and the fight again emerges to
define and (re)claim the Arctic's pasts, present, and futures. As the
Arctic moves forward, so does it become an even grander geography for
the projection of imperial anxieties. That these anxieties are writ
large today is hardly surprising. The history of the Arctic is -- albeit
at different times and in different ways -- one of subjection, both to
the absolutisms of imperial rule and to more locally inflected
colonialisms. That history continues apace, confirming the obdurate
legacies of 'old-style' modes of colonial governance, but also ushering
in the 'new imperialisms']{.underline}**7 **[that are generally
associated with latecapitalist globalization, one epiphenomenon of which
-- all too visible in the Arctic -- is accelerated climate change. If
none of this is in dispute, two questions still remain in the context of
this particular issue. The first is the extent to which the contemporary
Arctic can be seen as 'postcolonial'. The second is the extent to which
the region -- however defined, and there are many possible definitions
-- can benefit from 'postcolonialism': that loose toolkit of approaches,
theories, and methods which, rarely accepted with equanimity, has been
applied to so many other parts of the world. Neither question yields an
easy answer. If the Arctic is postcolonial, then it will only be so if
the term is seen as negating its own prefix; as challenging the very
conditions of colonialism within which it is itself inscribed. And if it
is amenable to postcolonialism, then it will only be so if those
approaches, theories, and methods are taken to their own limits. Indeed,
in some ways the Arctic, which has become central to 'one-world'
ecological debates around planetary stewardship even as it continues to
be socially and politically marginalized, pushes the boundaries of
postcolonial understandings of society, politics, ecology -- and
conceptions of itself. The essays included here engage with these
reflexive dilemmas without falling into the trap that postcolonial
criticism often sets for itself: that of debating 'real-world' issues
that are designed for the application of postcolonial methods, only for
those methods to end up circling back on themselves. One way of
confronting this is to elevate practice above theory.]{.underline}** The
Postcolonial Arctic begins with a moving experiential account by the
British writer Kari Herbert -- daughter of the famous polar explorer Sir
Wally Herbert -- of part of a childhood spent in northern Greenland. The
account is characterized by a love -- of people, of place, of the
multiple fascinations of the Arctic -- that has remained undiminished
over time. It is also remarkably free of nostalgia, recognizing the
harshness, even ugliness, of the far north and the acute social and
environmental problems that have arisen there. These problems are
accentuated in the essay that follows by the award-winning Norwegian
political geographer Tone Huse. Huse **[focuses on the notorious Blok P
-- a now-defunct housing estate in Nuuk, Greenland's capital -- which
becomes the site for a lyrical contemplation on the country's colonial
past. Blok P is perhaps best known for the violence -- suicide and
aggravated assault, domestic and substance abuse -- that happened inside
it. But Huse is more interested in the external violence that created it
in the first place: the violence of central government planning; the
violence of a certain kind of architectural modernism; and, above all,
the violence of colonialism itself. The Arctic's colonial pasts --
multiple, often confused, always internally
differentiated]{.underline}** -- are also the subject of the next four
essays, whether colonialism is refracted through mediatized geopolitics
(Johanne Bruun), the technologies of polar exploration (Marionne
Cronin), threatened indigenous life-ways (Tero Mustonen), or digital
governance regimes (Citt Williams). **[In all four cases, colonialism is
as much of the present as of the past, caught up as it is in the
enduring (albeit historically shifting) symbolic politics that has come
to characterize the region for those who seek to control it rather than
those who wish to inhabit it; for those who want to manipulate it either
as an object of Western knowledge or as an opportunity for resource
extraction -- or both, since the Arctic is a rich symbolic and material
space.]{.underline}** This sense of the symbolic as well as material
importance of the Arctic is maintained in the last two essays: a
visually arresting piece by the Tromsø-based architect, Kjerstin Uhre,
and a rousing cri de coeur by the Cambridge-based environmental
historian, Michael Bravo. Much in the spirit of the issue as a whole,
Bravo **[see]{.underline}**s **[the Arctic in terms of a complex set of
interrelationships between 'old' and 'new' colonialisms -- one that
offers opportunities to colonize others, but also to decolonize
ourselves. Who 'we' are in these particular instances is moot,
and]{.underline}** (as Bravo is well aware**[) the diverse peoples of
the Arctic are fed up with being spoken for by others. But if the
'postcolonial Arctic' is to make any sense, both for these peoples and
for those who see themselves as acting in their best interests, then it
needs to be a fully dialogical space within the wider context of an
increasingly globalized world.]{.underline}**

#### Impact: Cartography is made to appear neutral, but it serves a political function: it is a form of intellectual colonization that justifies the epistemological and material erasure of indigenous life.

This book begins by reading into the [decolonial argument that the
**colonial** matrix of power largely tends to transform modernity into
an instrument of domination which manifested in the colonization of
**political cartographies**.]{.underline} [As regards the colonial
matrix of power is concerned, it is characterized by the
operationalization of **ontological** and **episte- mological** binaries
and hierarchies that was engendered by the unequal politico-economic and
**psycho**-cultural relations between the colonizing metropolitan core
and the colonized periphery. Such an unequal rela- tionship of
**domination** and **subjugation** emerged as crucial elements in
determining the structural/functional conditionalities of the working of
international relations, as well as the epistemologies that attempted to
explain the same. It happened as the grand theories of International
Rela- tions that have assumed the status of the disciplinary canon
tended to impart a kind of epistemological legitimacy to the unequal
relationship between the Western **metropolitan** core and the
non-Western periphery. Such a legitimacy was mediated through the
**hegemonic** epistemolog- ical and pedagogical practices of the grand
theories of **IR**. In this way, the grand theories in IR tended to
demonstrate a kind of deep-seated neocolonial imperial attributes that
are disseminated across the world as axiological postulates of the
**metaphysics** of cosmopolitanism. Considering this, it may be stated
that any satisfactory explanation of the nature of the working of IR,
hence must involve an epistemological engagement with the
**postcolonial** **ontology**.]{.underline} Such an engagement manifests
as an exigency vii viii PREFACE when we begin unpacking the ontic and
epistemic foundations of the disciplinary matrix of the subject of IR.
[As we pursue this very process of **mapping**, it becomes evident that
the disciplinary matrix of IR has largely evolved by way of treading a
teleolog- ical trajectory of synchronic **Eurocentric** and
**ethnocentric** history. Owing to such a teleological trajectory, the
scope and subject matter of IR has deeply grounded itself into a
paradigmatic thrust on Western ontic and epistemic **supremacism**. With
such a supremacist epistemological asser- tion, the world considerably
gets interpreted from the mere lens of the stagiest doctrinal progress
of European history.]{.underline} By virtue of such a West- centric and
ethnocentric intellectual project, a section of the theory in the
disciplinary matrix of IR has incarnated into the status of a canon. On
its part, the elite minority of the epistemic community of IR, who are
the treasurers of such a canon, have been hypostatized into the status
of the apostles. [The **hegemony** of the discourse of such a canon and
the hierarchy of the theoreticians privy to such a discourse tends to be
medi- ated through the universalizing hegemonic tropes of knowledge that
are embodied in the 'grand theories' of IR.]{.underline} Hence, for any
project that aims at making the discipline of IR more cosmopolitan in
character that would commend a wider contextual significance, the
dismantling of the theistic doctrinal hegemony and the primacy of the
sacrosanct position of grand theories of IR manifest as pressing
disciplinary imperatives. [Such an enterprise in the act of dismantling
seems to have become inevitable, mainly because the grand theories are
largely situated in a kind of an **axiological** postulate of the need
for the substantiation of the meta-histories that are constituted
through an epistemic focus upon the local history of Western
civilization. This kind of focus on the **local** history of **Europe**
renders world history to appear as a mere **reductionist** synchronic
narrative. It is in such a narrow ontic narrative on history and the
supremacism of Western epistemology that the meta-theoretical
foundations of the discipline of IR tend to be pivoted. The tropes of
knowledge that are produced in such a circumstance considerably shape
the pedagogical and epistemological processes in the discipline of
Interna- tional Relations.]{.underline} Such a heuristic
over-determinism that characterizes the technical discourse of the
discipline of International Relations is firmly grounded in the
ontological roots of a Eurocentric interpretation of the past and an
ethnocentric definition of the epistemology of IR. This kind of
disciplinary ontology is propelled by what has been desig- nated as IR's
Westphalian common-sense. For such a common-sense, our PREFACE ix
present-day international society has directly descended from the
universal European system. Owing to this, the technical discourse of the
disci- pline of IR has largely tended to be shaped in terms of the
grammar of the Westphalian conception of international order. By virtue
of this, the paradigm of Westphalia tends to act as the core ontological
principle driving the formation of grand theories in IR. What gets
erased in such an epistemological trajectory is the very diachronic
history of international relations that is constituted by the pres- ence
of a world that is outside Europe. Such a world that is designated as
the postcolonial spatio-temporal topoi seems to have been regarded as a
disjunctive structural imaginary, a historical break and an epistemolog-
ical lag by the dominant hegemonic technical discourse of the discipline
of IR. Considering this kind of epistemology of IR, the task at hand is
to look at historical narratives by situating them in their specific
spatio- temporal idiosyncrasies. To do this, the imperative is to
decolonize the meta-theoretical foundations of IR. In order to do this,
the restruc- turing of the ontological, epistemological, methodological
and theoretical underpinnings of the discipline becomes an exigency. An
attempt has been made in this book to undertake such a task of
restructuring, by interrogating the disciplinary matrix of IR at the
level of meta-theory. This interrogation has been situated largely on
the plank of ontology and it is done by critically examining the working
of grand theories in IR. Based on this, a case has been made in this
book for placing mid-level theories at the core of the ontological
concerns of the discipline. Such a thrust on the significance of
mid-level theories, it has been argued in this book, goes a long way in
the restructuring of the disciplinary matrix of IR at the level of
meta-theory. Taking cognizance of this, the book has been designed as a
venture toward committing a kind of disciplinary heresy. This is because
it seeks to question the deep-seated conceptual grammar and the
meta-theoretical structure of the grand theories of the discipline of
IR. Such a struc- ture and content of the grand theories have
considerably contributed to the substantiation of the imperializing
nature of the epistemology of the discipline[. In any case, the origin
and growth of such a process of epis- temological **imperialism**
happened as the product of the genealogies of the West-centric
ethnocentric disciplinary matrix of IR.]{.underline} However, such an
argument seems to be a mere reductionist one that renders a less-than-
perfect explanation for the sustenance of the hegemony of grand theories
x PREFACE that are produced in the West. Rather, the rote
epistemological and peda- gogical practices that have characterized the
structure and content of the disciplinary history of IR seem to have
been equally responsible. Such practices are manifest in the mimetic
reproduction of the arguments of the grand theories that are undertaken
for [the purpose of mapping the terrain of the 'international', a task
that is done by being completely oblivious of the phenomenological
caveat toward the need for suspension of our intentions and the
hermeneutic postulate of recognizing the contextual significance of any
phenomenon.]{.underline} [Such epistemic endeavors factor deeply in
perpetuating the **intellectual** **colonization** of the discipline of
IR by the imperializing heuristic power of the grand
theories.]{.underline} Hence, even at the cost of committing a kind of
apostasy, I dare to question the established canon that has been
disseminated across generations. By doing this, I present to the
readers, my ideas for liberating the discipline of IR from the
colonizing mental yoke of the grand theories. In any case, while the
book undertakes such a task, I wish to render a caveat at the very
outset. I intend to make it very clear here that neither I am aiming to
engage in any kind of a nihilistic endeavor at dismantling a particular
form of theory, nor do I seek to propose any kind of liberation theology
that would venture toward recrafting the disciplinary matrix of IR by
way of scripting its theoretical space on a clean slate. Rather, the
simplest objective in this book is to involve myself in a flirtatious
but not very dilettantish engagement with second-order theorizing. While
I do this, the aim here would be to carry out a rigorous critique of the
grand theories of IR which form part of first-order theorizing. Such a
pursuit of course cannot be undertaken by being oblivious to the need
for adherence to the logic of pedantic precision and methodological
agnosticism.

#### The alternative is refuse the aff's cartographic practices -- this is a prerequisite for ethical decolonial politics

The [North in its entirety can be considered a colonial and militarised
territory, where]{.underline}, nowadays, [decolonial initiatives have
arisen]{.underline}. Among these, several are [rooted in
mapping]{.underline}. [Cartography has been forced upon the land in such
violent ways that the only way forward is to overthrow the practice
itself.]{.underline} Settler colonialism is not only a political issue;
it also consists in imposing a way of thinking (considered superior)
which devalues and replaces Indigenous cultural practices and
ontologies. [Maps determine the locations of the centre and the fringes,
as well as the ways in which the land is occupied]{.underline}. As
[historically strategic tools]{.underline}, they [make it possible to
claim an entire territory without even setting foot on it]{.underline}.
The [Rupert's Land treaties and]{.underline} the [monopolies held
by]{.underline} the major [colonial companies]{.underline}, such as the
Hudson's Bay Company's hold over what is now the Canadian North, for
instance, [gave precedence to the authority of the word]{.underline} --
by the power vested in me, I hereby declare [that this land belongs to
such and such -- over physical occupation.]{.underline} As Bernard
Nietschmann puts it, '\[[m\]ore indigenous territory has been claimed by
maps than by guns']{.underline} (1994, 37). Indeed, [Europeans took
possession of territories before they set out to explore
them.]{.underline} [Maps are agents of this power and replace the
experience of roaming the land with a cartographic abstraction that will
later serve as proof of property,]{.underline} for instance during
subsequent territorial negotiations. Furthermore, [maps thwart
toponymy]{.underline}, [replacing it]{.underline} sometimes [with the
settler's lexicon, and]{.underline} at other times, rather cynically,
with [something like 'great white expanse', signalling the unknown
(rather than]{.underline} admitting [ignorance]{.underline}) [and
emptiness]{.underline} [(in lieu of acknowledgement]{.underline}). In
the Americas, this [imperialist cartographic violence denies any
recognition of prior Indigenous presence, as acknowledging it would
negate the very vocabulary that Europeans used to claim the
land]{.underline}: 'the New World', 'New England', 'New France', 'the
discovery of America', 'the founding of Canada'. [To allow for the
conqueror's gesture, Indigenous toponymy must be silenced.]{.underline}
This [cartographic overwriting leads to the silencing not only of place
names, but also of prior cultures and practices]{.underline}. [Maps
render the land -- an]{.underline} [essential]{.underline} and concrete
element [for Indigenous cultures]{.underline} -- [abstract,
dematerialising it]{.underline} [and devaluing its empirical
understanding]{.underline}, favouring sedentary life over nomadism.
Geographer and linguist Louis- Edmond Hamelin, who advocated for a
'geography of the feet', calling for trajectories, experiences, and
field observations, writes that '[such condescending behaviour can only
serve to distort the perception of facts]{.underline} on the ground'
(Hamelin, Chartier, and D.sy 2013, 41).3 [For peoples under colonial
rule who]{.underline} still have to [live with the performative efforts
of colonial maps within their governance]{.underline}, such as the Inuit
and the Sámi, [overthrowing cartographic perspectives is a way to
transform the political order.]{.underline}

#### And, ethical scholars must refuse to participate in colonialism

[We must remain inquisitively expectant of the blindspots that are
intrinsic to our enduring complicities in whiteness as a
\[neo-\]colonising system of power]{.underline}. As emphasized by Fanon
(1952/2008), [white people and researchers operating in white knowledge
systems, need to cultivate an "attitude," "which is profoundly
epistemological, as well as ethical, political, and
aesthetic]{.underline}\... \[requiring\] that the [subjects of knowledge
question themselves,]{.underline} not about the humanity of others, but
[about the extent to which they are expressing their own humanity \[by
actively countering the continued dehumanisations of people living in
precarious conditions\]]{.underline}" (Maldonado-Torres, 2017, p.
439---emphasis added). [This requires "epistemic modesty"
(]{.underline}Teo, 2019); a value that [means being "aware of one's own
horizon, the strengths and limitations of one's own
approach]{.underline}, [while being knowledgeable about the history,
sociality, and culturality of knowledge."]{.underline} (p. 40).
Developing such an attitude and value depends on us recognizing our
entanglements with the world around us, which also demands that we move
beyond human-centered notions of agency. Singh (2018) locates the
decolonial project in a dehumanist (but importantly, not disembodied)
understanding of agency, viewed through our ''non-masterful
entanglements" with other humans, animals, and the environment; a
practice and a "promise of vulnerability" that remakes the human "from
its outside," from the standpoint of those who have been dehumanized.
[For white people this "remaking" affords an opportunity for the
co-construction of a new positionality, beyond Western binary, fixed,
categorical thinking---a "third space"---that is "guided by" Black,
Indigenous, and people of color knowledges, where we are neither "enemy
or ally," but rather a "concrete subject of struggle"]{.underline}
(Leonardo, 2009, p. 186). Puig de la Bellacasa (2017) recognizes this
reciprocity within more-than-human worlds "through a collective web of
obligations, rather than individual commitments\... \[exposing\] the
multilateral circulation of agencies of care\... \[that\] follows the
requirement of looking at the specificity of moments, particular
relations, of ecologies where the ethical is both personal agency and
embedded in the 'ethos' of a community of living\... \[focussed on the\]
doings and undoings of the ethical embedded in technoscientific
assemblages and naturecultures" (p. 120; 151). Specifically in regard to
universities, paperson (2017) identifies us as "scyborgs" (drawing on
Haraway's concept of the cyborg) that spring from the colonizing
technological assemblage of the university: "The agency of the scyborg
is precisely that it is a reorganizer of institutional machinery; it
subverts machinery against the master code of its makers; it rewires
machinery to its own intentions (p. 55) \... Your agential capacity
extends beyond your being, into the system's capacity. Your agency is a
system. This is why I put the s in front of the cyborg" (p. 61).
Accordingly, s-he argues, [there is no utopian decolonized university
but there are opportunities for operating as a decolonizing university
through the subversive scyborgian acts of reassemblage]{.underline}
(paperson, 2017). So what does this mean practically for white people
and those of us connected to whiteness in the neoliberal academy? At the
most basic level, [cultivating this "attitude" and the post-/dehumanist
understanding of agency that underpins it, means recognizing that our
decolonizing potentials are contingent on the ways in which we maintain
our relationships with "the outside." In decolonial and Indigenous
literatures this is described as "relational accountability," which
calls on us to be responsible and locate ourselves (and our theories)
within the political and violent histories which continue to structure
sites of oppression in our societies today]{.underline} (Chilisa, 2020;
Dei & Asgharzadeh, 2001; Naylor et al., 2018). Therefore in reading
about the subjectivities, ontologies, and epistemologies of Others, this
implicates the importance of holding "proximity and distance together"
in such encounters (Ahmed, 2000). In explanation, Ahmed (2000), drawing
on Levinas, likens an ethical interaction to a caress, as opposed to a
grasp, shake, beating, or withdrawal, reflected through a respect of the
"boundary lines that have already been drawn as markers not only of
territory, but of power" (p. 156--157). For example, in the case of
paperson's (2017) scyborg, s-he locates the reassembling potentials of
the scyborg in desire; how "you, as scyborg might use these
\[colonising\] technologies to bend the fabric of power to suit your
decolonial desires" (p. 59). However, [for those of us who move
relatively easily through the unmarked whiteness of Western academia, we
must question whether we can ever fully trust our own decolonial
desires]{.underline}? As scyborgs who do not feel \[ever nearly as
strongly\] the friction and violence of colonial technologies on our
bodies, it is crucial that we recognize our difference. Namely, that [we
understand the importance of formulating our decolonial desires in more
"co-conspiratorial" ways]{.underline} (Love, 2019), taking care to
[ensure that our \[removals from\] action align with broader decolonial
and social justice strategizing]{.underline}. It is for this reason that
I would never describe myself as a decolonial or anti-colonial scholar;
I recognize that in order to work in anti-colonial ways I must think
with Others (through interdisciplinary readings and real interactions)
about how and when I take-up and deoccupy space. [Refusals are integral
to this. They are about our responsibilities as scholars, practitioners,
and activists in needing to be explicit about how we are engaging with
the knowledge of Others in our attempts to manage and remain accountable
for our continued complicities in oppressive structures and forces.
Refusals demand that we go beyond the "self-deceiving]{.underline}"
(Maldonado-Torres, 2017) [practices of some reflexive accounts, in which
"privileges" are named only in relation to how they were \[supposedly\]
mitigated]{.underline}. Refusals call for the telling of 'involved
stories' (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2017) in which the complexities of our
relationships with the worlds that we research and work with, are
acknowledged through remaining "openly moved by a commitment to treat
the emerging issues as a matter of care\... \[providing accounts that
are\] neither theoretical nor descriptive, \[and\] open to alternative
readings, yet situated" (p. 22). This connects with Tuck and Yang's
(2014) identification of refusals "as a way of thinking about humanizing
researchers" (p. 223), and too, with Fanon's (1952/2008) emphasis on the
importance of narrative and description as a means of disrupting the
coloniality of the scientific method (Maldonado-Torres, 2017). [Refusals
therefore provide an opening for white scholars, practitioners, and
activists, and all of us connected to whiteness, to contribute to the
telling of stories and assembling of practices around and outside of the
"sameness"]{.underline} (Essed & Goldberg, 2002) [and
"mastery]{.underline}" (Singh, 2018) [that is actively cultured in
academia.]{.underline} By the very nature of complicities, and also the
long arc of collaborative change[, the stories of our refusals will
remain imperfect, undone, and particular to each own's
situation]{.underline}. In my current situation, working on a fixed-term
postdoctoral research contract, I am not always able to set limits on
the work that I do. I raise the issue of complicities, open-up
dialogues, and take a stand when I can, but also sometimes I don't have
the energy, opportunity (because of pressured timeframes), or relational
power to do so. Nevertheless I'm also taking this experience as a
learning opportunity. Even when I cannot refuse, I can still identify
specific examples of how I do not want to work, as much as how I hope to
when I have more institutional power, and I imagine I'll spend my career
trying to cultivate these practices. For those of you who currently hold
institutional power, educate yourself, and share learning on issues of
care and wellbeing in academia (e.g., see Boynton, 2021). Support and
shield students and colleagues who are striving to operate in subversive
and decolonizing ways; listen, and learn from them, and cultivate space
for the sharing of "involved stories" that speak to the discomfort and
unease of being complicit in the coloniality of social science research.
Furthermore, co-conspire and mobilize (also with alumni \[see Canham et
al., in, press\] and movements and communities outside of academia)
against the precariousness that pervades so much of this work. [We do
not engage in refusal to absolve ourselves of complicity or attempt to
move towards innocence, we engage in refusal to "unsettle
innocence]{.underline}" (Tuck & Yang, 2014), [and this ultimately, must
be a collective endeavor.]{.underline} It is essential that we attend to
both the long arc of collectively strategized change as well as moments
of ethics, in which our responsivity to more-than-human worlds is never
mechanistically presumed, but rather viewed as requiring, "a moment by
moment process of ethically sensitive negotiation at the boundaries of
our being" (Shotter, 1992, p. 11). In order to put our differences "to
work" (Ahmed, 2000) we must form entire webs of refusals, through which
new ethico-political and agentic possibilities can emerge.

[EUROCENTRISM The conscious or unconscious process by which Europe and
European cultural assumptions are constructed as, or assumed to be, the
normal, the natural or the universal]{.underline}. [The
first,]{.underline} and possibly most potent [sign of
Eurocentrism]{.underline}, as José Rabasa explains (1993), [was the
specific projection]{.underline} employed [to **construct the Mercator
Atlas**]{.underline} itself, [a projection that favoured the European
temperate zones in its distribution of size]{.underline}. [This map of
the world is not merely an objective outline of discovered continents,
but an 'ideological or mythological reification of space' which opens up
the territories of the world to domination and
appropriation.]{.underline} '[The world']{.underline} only [acquired
spatial meaning]{.underline} [after different regions had been
**inscribed by Europeans**]{.underline}, and this inscription, [apart
from locating Europe at the top of the globe or map, established an
ideological figuration]{.underline}, through the accompanying text and
illustrations, which [firmly centralized Europe as the source and
arbiter of spatial and cultural meaning]{.underline}. By the eighteenth
century [this conception of a collective 'Europe' constructed as a sign
of superiority]{.underline} and [in opposition to the rest of the
world's cultures]{.underline} had become firmly consolidated. Then, as
now, [such collective constructions existed in a troubled or ambivalent
relationship with an alternative stress on the nationalism of emerging
individual European nation-states]{.underline} and their particular
cultures. [European colonization]{.underline} of the rest of the globe,
which accelerated in the eighteenth century and reached its apogee in
the nineteenth, actively promoted or [facilitated Eurocentrism through
**exploration**, conquest and trade]{.underline}. Imperial displays of
power, both in the metropolitan centres and at the colonial peripheries,
and assertions of intellectual authority in colonialist institutions
such as schools and universities, and through the civil service and
legal codes, established European systems and values as inherently
superior to indigenous ones. Edward Said's Orientalism examines [the
ways in which Eurocentrism not only influences and alters, but actually
produces other cultures.]{.underline} Orientalism is 'a way of coming to
terms with the orient that is based on the orient's special place in
European western experience'(1978:1) or 'the western style for
dominating, restructuring and having authority over the orient' (3).
This authority is, in Said's view, a product of a systematic
'discipline' by which European culture was able to construct and manage
the Orient during the post-Enlightenment period. [Eurocentrism is
masked]{.underline} in literary study [by concepts such as literary
universality]{.underline}, in history by [authoritative
interpretations]{.underline} written from the point of view of the
victors, [and]{.underline} in early anthropology by [the unconscious
assumptions involved in the idea that its data were those societies
defined as 'primitive' and so opposed to a European norm of
**development**]{.underline} and civilization. Some cultural critics
have argued that anthropology as a discipline in its classic, unrevised
form came into being in such a close relationship with colonization that
it could not have existed at all without the prior existence of
Eurocentric concepts of knowledge and civilization. [Eurocentrism is
also present in the]{.underline} assumptions and practices of
Christianity through education and mission activity, as well as in in
the [assumed superiority of Western mathematics, **cartography**, art
and numerous other cultural and social practices which have been
claimed, or assumed, to be based on a universal, objective set of
values.]{.underline}

[WORLDING A term coined by Gayatri Spivak to describe the way in which
colonized space is **brought into the 'world'**]{.underline}**,** that
is, [made to exist as part of a world essentially constructed by
Euro-centrism]{.underline}: If . . . we concentrated on documenting and
theorizing the itinerary of the consolidation of Europe as sovereign
subject, indeed sovereign and subject, then we would produce an
alternative historical narrative of the 'worlding' of what is today
called 'the Third World.' (Spivak 1985a: 128) Alluding to Heidegger's
essay 'The Origin of the Work of Art', Spivak describes the process as
the '[worlding of the world on uninscribed earth']{.underline}, [which
may be described in other terms as the 'inscribing' of imperial
discourse upon the colonized 'space']{.underline}. [This kind of
inscription is most obviously carried out by activities such as
**mapping**, both by putting the colony on the map of the world and by
mapping it internally so as to name it, and by naming it to know it, and
hence, **control it.**]{.underline} [But]{.underline} the process of
'[worlding' also occurs in much more subtle ways]{.underline}: Spivak
offers examples of the ways in which imperialism works to overwrite the
colonized place by simply being there, [pointing to the example of the
solitary British soldier walking across the countryside of India in the
early nineteenth century]{.underline}: H[e is actually engaged in
consolidating the self of Europe by obliging the native to cathect the
space of the Other on his home ground]{.underline} \[that is, he is
obliging the native to experience his home ground as imperial space\].
He is worlding their own world, which is far from mere uninscribed
earth. . . . \[He is effectively and violently sliding one discourse
under another.\] (Spivak 1985a: 133) This is one of the many different
processes of othering, which characterize colonial contact. The point
Spivak is making here is that the imperial project itself is far from
monolithic, that its 'class composition and social positionality are
necessarily heterogeneous' (133). [This '**cartographic
transformation'** was not only achieved by the policy makers, but also,
and **more importantly**, by the little people like the solitary soldier
-- and the thousands of colonists **who followed** people like him to
places that are colonized by an imperial society.]{.underline}

Never the Muse is absent

from their ways: lyres clash and flutes cry

and everywhere maiden choruses whirling.

They bind their hair in golden laurel and take their holiday.

Neither disease nor bitter old age is mixed

in their sacred blood; far from labor and battle

they live; they escape scandal and litigation

\... those blessed men1

A contemporary of Herodotus, **[the lyric poet Pindar penned these words
during the fifth century BC in an ode to the fabled]{.underline}**
Ὑπερβόρε(ι)οι, or **[Hyperboreans. To the Ancient Greeks, these were a
mythical people who lived beyond the North Wind in a fabulous landscape
of eternal spring, sunlight, and warmth. For them, light perpetual was
cast onto a land of enlightenment, devoid of shadow and full of
possibility.]{.underline}** Indeed, Nietzsche later invokes Pindar's
stanzas to argue that we are all Hyperboreans in that we seek out,
through solitude, a philosophical, hermeneutical happiness -- 'another
beginning', as he suggests -- in order to overcome the decadence and
malady of the modern individual.2 **[While contemporary imaginations of
the Arctic may have turned cooler and darker since the time of the
Greeks, the region continues to be mythologized as an unknown,
inaccessible, and forbidden land, a remote, wild, and often 'othered'
frontier. As an aggregate territory and a phantasy of the public
consciousness, there has been a drive to essentialize this diverse,
contested space in a way that heavily glosses over the complex
geopolitical, (trans)national, cultural and linguistic distinctions that
define it. Its history entangled with various cultural and ideological
representations, the Arctic is disputed as an idea as much as a broad
topographical description we use to orient ourselves.]{.underline}** It
is not merely that the alterities we ascribe to this part of the world
are socially, culturally, and historically embedded. It is that the
Arctic's multiple landscapes -- and its aesthetic, cultural, political,
economic and scientific interests -- are all inexorably intermeshed with
one another.3 Perhaps it is this seduction towards a unifying
singularity that draws in those who seek in the Arctic some measure of
inspiration. **[For if the Arctic has been a space for ideological
projections, it has also served as a physical nexus for thought and
experimentation, creativity and artistry, engagement and collaboration,
excitement and adventure -- for artists, writers, thinkers, scholars,
explorers and travellers. Many journeys North are constructed and
portrayed as odysseys towards self and truth, movements mobilized by the
poetic potential of exploration, both to the ends of the Earth and the
innards of the soul.]{.underline}**4 **[The Arctic's reluctant,
disorienting, and alienating fictional and factual landscapes, whether
characterized by remoteness, loneliness or vulnerability, also hold an
immense power to encourage the bridging of boundaries, categories, and
discourses.]{.underline}** Creative work conceived of in this region and
by its peoples -- or, indeed, through both -- can challenge dominant
analytic and interpretive frameworks, and question prototypical
conceptualizations and beliefs about extreme spaces, and about the
humans (and non-humans) who inhabit them. **[And yet, for many external
observers, the Arctic today is extreme no longer: it is tamed, and more
accessible than ever.]{.underline}** Two thousand five hundred years
ago, Pindar wrote that 'never on foot or ship could you explore the
marvelous road to the feast of the Hyperboreans'.5 Today, Ryanair flies
there direct. **[Changes (climatic, social, commercial) across the
region have further enabled this contested space to exist beyond mere
imagination, promising new access to new people. Encounters with the
Arctic are being re-envisioned today given the increased accessibility
of travel and mobility. This is due not just to us bearing witness to
the materialization of anthropogenic climate change, nor to what has
been called -- in deliberate reference to another colonial hot potato --
a 'scramble'6 for the Arctic, nor yet to new forms of travel and tourism
cropping up in various pockets of the region. It is also due to the
paradox that the more we are empowered to move closer to landscapes and
experiences that defamiliarize us from what we know in our everyday
lives, the more we seek to imagine new unfamiliarities.]{.underline}**
This issue of Moving Worlds is the outcome of a series of talks convened
by Arctic Encounters: Contemporary Travel/Writing in the European High
North, a collaborative and multidisciplinary HERA-funded research
project that explores the ways in which a changing Arctic changes ideas
not just about travel, but about the planet and its inhabitants more
broadly. **[The Arctic itself is very much a moving world. It has come
to stand for much more than its own landscapes. Movement here is an apt
metaphor for a globalizing topography in which immobility becomes more
and more anomaly: we move the Earth (with our chlorofluorocarbons,
fracking and terraforming); the Earth moves us (through its retreating
ice and rising waters). And indeed, if recent scholarly and public
debates around the Anthropocene are any measure, such movements mobilize
us into political and environmental action. Amid this, old contests over
control of Arctic resources and occupation of its territories resurface
as increasingly urgent social issues, and the fight again emerges to
define and (re)claim the Arctic's pasts, present, and futures. As the
Arctic moves forward, so does it become an even grander geography for
the projection of imperial anxieties. That these anxieties are writ
large today is hardly surprising. The history of the Arctic is -- albeit
at different times and in different ways -- one of subjection, both to
the absolutisms of imperial rule and to more locally inflected
colonialisms. That history continues apace, confirming the obdurate
legacies of 'old-style' modes of colonial governance, but also ushering
in the 'new imperialisms']{.underline}**7 **[that are generally
associated with latecapitalist globalization, one epiphenomenon of which
-- all too visible in the Arctic -- is accelerated climate change. If
none of this is in dispute, two questions still remain in the context of
this particular issue. The first is the extent to which the contemporary
Arctic can be seen as 'postcolonial'. The second is the extent to which
the region -- however defined, and there are many possible definitions
-- can benefit from 'postcolonialism': that loose toolkit of approaches,
theories, and methods which, rarely accepted with equanimity, has been
applied to so many other parts of the world. Neither question yields an
easy answer. If the Arctic is postcolonial, then it will only be so if
the term is seen as negating its own prefix; as challenging the very
conditions of colonialism within which it is itself inscribed. And if it
is amenable to postcolonialism, then it will only be so if those
approaches, theories, and methods are taken to their own limits. Indeed,
in some ways the Arctic, which has become central to 'one-world'
ecological debates around planetary stewardship even as it continues to
be socially and politically marginalized, pushes the boundaries of
postcolonial understandings of society, politics, ecology -- and
conceptions of itself. The essays included here engage with these
reflexive dilemmas without falling into the trap that postcolonial
criticism often sets for itself: that of debating 'real-world' issues
that are designed for the application of postcolonial methods, only for
those methods to end up circling back on themselves. One way of
confronting this is to elevate practice above theory.]{.underline}** The
Postcolonial Arctic begins with a moving experiential account by the
British writer Kari Herbert -- daughter of the famous polar explorer Sir
Wally Herbert -- of part of a childhood spent in northern Greenland. The
account is characterized by a love -- of people, of place, of the
multiple fascinations of the Arctic -- that has remained undiminished
over time. It is also remarkably free of nostalgia, recognizing the
harshness, even ugliness, of the far north and the acute social and
environmental problems that have arisen there. These problems are
accentuated in the essay that follows by the award-winning Norwegian
political geographer Tone Huse. Huse **[focuses on the notorious Blok P
-- a now-defunct housing estate in Nuuk, Greenland's capital -- which
becomes the site for a lyrical contemplation on the country's colonial
past. Blok P is perhaps best known for the violence -- suicide and
aggravated assault, domestic and substance abuse -- that happened inside
it. But Huse is more interested in the external violence that created it
in the first place: the violence of central government planning; the
violence of a certain kind of architectural modernism; and, above all,
the violence of colonialism itself. The Arctic's colonial pasts --
multiple, often confused, always internally
differentiated]{.underline}** -- are also the subject of the next four
essays, whether colonialism is refracted through mediatized geopolitics
(Johanne Bruun), the technologies of polar exploration (Marionne
Cronin), threatened indigenous life-ways (Tero Mustonen), or digital
governance regimes (Citt Williams). **[In all four cases, colonialism is
as much of the present as of the past, caught up as it is in the
enduring (albeit historically shifting) symbolic politics that has come
to characterize the region for those who seek to control it rather than
those who wish to inhabit it; for those who want to manipulate it either
as an object of Western knowledge or as an opportunity for resource
extraction -- or both, since the Arctic is a rich symbolic and material
space.]{.underline}** This sense of the symbolic as well as material
importance of the Arctic is maintained in the last two essays: a
visually arresting piece by the Tromsø-based architect, Kjerstin Uhre,
and a rousing cri de coeur by the Cambridge-based environmental
historian, Michael Bravo. Much in the spirit of the issue as a whole,
Bravo **[see]{.underline}**s **[the Arctic in terms of a complex set of
interrelationships between 'old' and 'new' colonialisms -- one that
offers opportunities to colonize others, but also to decolonize
ourselves. Who 'we' are in these particular instances is moot,
and]{.underline}** (as Bravo is well aware**[) the diverse peoples of
the Arctic are fed up with being spoken for by others. But if the
'postcolonial Arctic' is to make any sense, both for these peoples and
for those who see themselves as acting in their best interests, then it
needs to be a fully dialogical space within the wider context of an
increasingly globalized world.]{.underline}**

### Link\-\--Borders

The 1acs capture of arctic knowledge reifies immigrant stereotypes that
reinforce 'refugeness'. The border line is the distinction between being
and becoming. Your place on the map determines if you do or do not
exist.

[The Arctic camp My first residence in Sweden after being released from
detention was a refugee camp in Kiruna, the northernmost city in Sweden,
145 kilometres north of the **Arctic Circle.**]{.underline} Through the
window of the airplane, as far as our sight reached, there was only snow
and woodland. [No immigrant communities existed in that little Arctic
town. With our dark black hair or skin, we stuck out everywhere we
went]{.underline}. People looked at us as if we were space aliens. [One
aspect of migrant illegality is that one's life is unsettled,
unpredictable and erratic. Migrant illegality means abrupt and dramatic
interruptions in one's life, interruptions such as detention,
deportation or simply sudden opportunities to move. Migrants disappear
without a trace.]{.underline} I lost contact with many of my
co-travellers from Cantt Station and Defence Colony, and I do not know
what happened to them. However, I have followed some in their trajectory
wanderings (see Appendix). We use all kinds of communication, ranging
from personal networks -- extending from Los Angeles via London to
Tehran -- to Facebook to find old co-travellers. [Like war veterans, a
shared trauma, a collective woe, binds us together.]{.underline} When we
meet, our talk is almost entirely about Cantt Station, Defence Colony
and shared friends who passed through these places. We have lost
something over there. Once again, my life was lived with refugees and
immigrants from all corners of the poor world, with Asians, Africans and
Latin Americans. We all had one thing in common, our homelessness and 70
'Illegal' Traveller wondering what the hell we were doing in a city
covered with frost and darkness. [Daylight was limited to a few hours
per day. To make things cosier, the camp was attacked by an
**anti-immigrant mob** one week after my arrival. Despite all the
differences (not least in terms of economic resources) between my Arctic
camp and refugee camps in poor countries in Asia and Africa, the logic
of the camp, however, was the same: **to place undesired people outside
the society.**]{.underline} [The camp meant both **expelling and
excepting** refugees. Camps are for refugees -- those exceptions to the
nation-state system who have **violated** the norm and are unfeasible to
be integrated into the ordinary law.]{.underline} [Refugee camps are the
most advanced form of the global treatment of stigmatized identities and
undesirable groups]{.underline} (Agier 2008:61). [They treat refugees
like lepers in the Middle Ages, who were kept outside city
walls.]{.underline} The French anthropologist Michel Agier has observed
that [refugee camps are not only spatially but temporally outside the
commonplace and outside the ordinary and **predictable**
world]{.underline} (Agier 2008:40). [Camps are spaces but not places.
Refugee camps, even those that have existed for several decades and
house a **constant population of tens of thousands**, like small towns,
do not appear on the **maps** of countries]{.underline} (Agier 2008:44).
[Camps occupy space but are not recognized as official places. Their
inhabitants live, give birth and die there for generations but are not
recognized as a **community**.]{.underline} [Camps are **unnamable,
indefinable**.]{.underline} [Regarded as having penetrated the
**'purity'** of the nation, refugees are seen as constituting a
**'danger'**]{.underline} (Douglas 1966). [To protect the wellbeing of
society, these individuals are placed under surveillance, located
outside the sphere of ordinary social life. By regulating, managing and
limiting refugee mobility, camps function to protect the **virtue** of
the nation.]{.underline} In the case of Nazi camps, the juridical
foundation of internment was Schuzhaft (literally: protective custody).
Metaphorically, the Swedish word förvar (detention centre) is often
confused with försvar (defense) (Khosravi 2009a). [The camp is not a
historical relic of the past, but is 'the hidden matrix and nomos of the
political space in which we still live']{.underline} (Agamben 2000:36).
[Refugee camps constitute the most significant characteristic of the
modern nation-state. One significant feature of all refugee camps, no
matter where they are located, is that they impose 'refugeeness', not as
a juridical category but rather as a mode of **being**, an identity, on
The **Invisible Border** 71 individuals]{.underline}. As Malkki puts it:
['refugeeness is a matter of **becoming'**]{.underline} (1997:228).
[Through a **pathologizing** bureaucracy, camps produce refugees, or
rather refugeeness.]{.underline} As a war refugee, I was not seen as a
'normal' and 'healthy' individual. Apart from the medical examinations
of my body, I was treated, according to the most positive
interpretation, as a child who did not know what was good or bad for
him. The clientization of the refugee began as soon as she or he entered
the camp. In the Arctic camp, I was educated to become a 'victim'.
Neither lashes on my back, time in prison nor a year of statelessness
could take from me my dignity as the Arctic camp did. Until then, I
might have lacked documents and a state, yet I was full of life, will
and courage. All that I lost in the process of 'becoming a refugee'[. As
a Rwandan man in a refugee camp put it, 'they educate us to be
refugees']{.underline} (Malkki 1995a:222). I, who had crossed so many
borders and lived in dangerous places, shared rooms with prostitutes and
a cell with a murderer and drug smugglers, had become afraid to take the
bus to the city centre, [in one of the safest countries in the world.
This deeply **embodied fear** stayed with me for a long
time.]{.underline} Even today, though to a much lesser extent, I suffer
from [agoraphobia -- a fear of being among others, of being
seen.]{.underline} In that period of my life, I wrote a couple of
amateurish short stories, which I never submitted for publication. One
was about a young black man who always wore dark sunglasses, day and
night, indoors and outdoors. He was protecting himself from the
collective judgmental gaze. He could see without being seen. The other
was about a young man who realized that he simply did not exist for
others, when one day in the subway he talked to people and no one heard
him and one woman simply walked right through him to get on the train.
The victim role followed me for a long time beyond the walls of the
refugee camp. I first realized how deeply the role had become
internalized many years later in the mid-1990s during a course on
anthropological methodology when I was interviewed by a classmate as
part of the course's practical work. For refugees, interviews are
associated with the asylum process, meetings with refugee camp
authorities or encounters with border police. My classmate, a young
Swedish woman, focused the interview on my life. In the middle of the
interview, I saw her eyes were getting wet and then suddenly tears were
72 'Illegal' Traveller running down her chin. Obviously, I was telling
her exactly what I was supposed to say as a refugee in an interview. [I
had left no space for enjoyment, **agency,** self-representation or
individual background.]{.underline} [In that interview, as I had been
'educated', my self-represented victim role appeared, stripped of the
specificity of **culture, place and history**]{.underline} (Malkki
1995a). Years later, I reluctantly became a link between my informants,
failed asylum seekers, and the Swedish media[. Refugees are not only
'helpless', they are also 'speechless' and need someone to speak for
them, for example, journalists, researchers, politicians and
activists]{.underline} (Malkki 1997:236). It was my informants who asked
me to help them into the public sphere. These failed asylum seekers
believed that publicity would give them a second chance. I always
followed my informants and was the interpreter. My informants knew well
what was expected of them. Noting how asylum seekers are discursively
constituted as 'non-agents', they strategically appropriated that
discourse in their own self-presentation through performing 'victimcy'
(Utas 2005:409). Utas demonstrates that victimcy is a form of
self-representation deployed by Liberian refugees in their 'social
navigation' of displacement. Several of my informants used the
interviews with journalists as a chance to gain advantage through
performing victimcy and refugeeness. By exaggerating and overplaying
their subjugation, they were performing the role ascribed to them. They
had been educated to perform in such a way. My informants were aware
that displaying any kind of agency would cast the authenticity of their
refugeeness into doubt. Once one informant, a young Kurdish woman in her
early twenties whose asylum application had been rejected, had an
appointment with her lawyer before going to the Migration Board. I
followed her to a café where she was supposed to meet her lawyer. When
the lawyer came, she started by commenting on the young woman's looks
and dress. [The lawyer, also a woman, told my informant to wipe off her
makeup and change from her miniskirt into jeans, because in her current
condition 'she did not look like a refugee'. Refugeeness entails living
up to expectations of what a refugee is.]{.underline} Malkki (1995a:9)
has indicated that there is a 'tendency to universalize "the refugee" as
a special "kind" of person, not only [in the **textual representation**,
but also in their photographic representation']{.underline}. The
Invisible Border 73 [The **stereotype** of 'the refugee' and what she or
he 'looks like' is formed by visual representations in the form of
abundant images]{.underline} in the press, on TV and recently even in
coffee-table books (see, for example, Szörényi 2006). Wright believes
that such images of refugees are primarily rooted in Christian religious
iconography, which has a long tradition of portraying forced migration;
witness such themes as 'the expulsion from the Garden of Eden' and 'the
flight into Egypt' (Wright 2000). Furthermore, refugeeness and asylum
are linked to old biblical traditions such as 'cities of refuge' and
'sanctuary'. Wright (2000) demonstrates that there are 'striking
similarities in content and style' between Christian iconography and the
current visual representation of refugees. Refugees are portrayed as
embodied eternal human suffering. Some images of refugees have become an
allegory of refugeeness. The best-known example is the picture of the
'Afghan Girl', Sharbat Gula, taken in a refugee camp in Pakistan. Her
innocent, childish and beautiful face, with green eyes staring into the
camera, appeared on the cover of National Geographic in June 1985. The
'Afghan Girl' image has appeared extensively in newspapers, magazines,
handbooks, brochures and on TV. The visual representation of refugees
often reduces them to bearers of the 'message', [to signifiers of the
'real world' for viewers in rich parts of the world]{.underline}
(Szörényi 2006). [In other words, pain and suffering have become the
hallmarks of **refugeeness**. The term 'refugee' generally signifies
**deprived and underprivileged** people. A 'real' refugee is thus
supposed to be a 'profound', 'poor', 'traumatized', 'serious' and of
course 'sad' person.]{.underline} I was once told by a refugee case
worker in Sweden that Iranians could not be 'real' refugees. To my
'Why?' she answered, 'You see, they are well-dressed and go to discos'.
Thus, a happy, well-dressed, good-looking refugee is a contradiction.
Refugees have to perform 'refugeeness'. Similarly, the authenticity of
smuggled asylum seekers' cases may be called into question because they
have paid 'a lot of money to the smuggler'. The feeling of estrangement
and alienation, not only from Swedish society but, in an existential
sense, from the world in general, was intensified in the frozen refugee
camp north of the Arctic Circle. By then, even the atrocious Hotel
Shalimar seemed a remote haven. All these symptoms are woes of exile, of
being out of place, of having no place. According to an old Afghan
legend, the soul leaves the body 74 'Illegal' Traveller when one dreams.
If one wakes up before one's soul has returned to the body, one enters
an eternal nightmare (kabous), an outlandish predicament. For me this is
what exile is about: my soul did not return in time. Exile is when you
live in one place and dream in another. Exile is a dream of going back
home. In exile, one is possessed by longing, no matter where the exile
takes place. The whole world becomes a prison. Neither Calypso's beauty
and passionate love nor a pleasant life on her island could relieve
Odysseus's longing for Ithaca. [A life in exile is like being condemned
to purgatory, a state between life and death,]{.underline} a limbo
between here and there. Like many others in exile, I have an ambivalent
relationship with space and time. [My **body** is physically here and
now while my **heart** is there and then.]{.underline} The spatial
dimension of exilic life is excluding, vicious and wounding. In
allocating the social spaces, the exiles are not counted. Exile can
therefore be felt bodily. I feel it in my agoraphobia. In exile, not
even time follows its normal rhythm. In exile, the past exists side by
side with the present. [Exilic life is the **constant** presence of the
**absent.**]{.underline} I am in the subway and waiting for the train,
ordering a coffee in a coffee shop, paying money in a grocery store,
eating lunch with my colleagues on campus, listening to a lecturer,
writing a word on the blackboard for my students, and then abruptly
images of our houses, hazelnut trees, vineyard, a breeze moving through
the treetops outside my room in our Bakhtiari house, or mountains appear
before my eyes. Unexpected and unintentional the images come, one by
one, like a slide show. The images are detailed and real, but disappear
as swiftly as they appear. They are an interruption in the rhythm of the
present, an intermezzo. In exile, one does not stand on firm ground.
Exile is a condition of transience. Since crossing the border to
Afghanstan, everything has been provisional, transitory. [Exile is only
parenthetic to life, though it lasts and lasts, though I know return is
only a myth, a never-to-be-realized dream, though I know there is no
home to go back to. **Even though the house is there, the home is
gone.**]{.underline} I am not the same person, either. When Odysseus
returned to Ithaca, no one recognized him, not even his beloved
Penelope. However, the dream keeps me hoping. It liberates me from the
unbearable burden of alienhood. After six months I was granted asylum on
humanitarian grounds. I thought I had experienced all the possible kinds
of borders. The Invisible Border 75 I assumed that there would be no
more borders ahead to be crossed. However, I had a new kind of border to
tackle

### Link\-\--"The North"

#### The Rhetoric of the "North" is a colonial tool to justify mapping Indigenous territories farther and farther off their land. 

Daniel **Chartier et. al \'24** \[(Daniel Chartier ; Hanna Guttorm ;
Britt Kramvig ; Berit Kristoffersen ; Johannes Riquet ; and Philip
Steinberg ) \"Decolonial cartographies: Counter-mapping in the arctic,\"

The points of the compass are the foundations of cartographic
orientation, and [traditionally]{.underline}, the [North is placed at
the top of the map, which makes the Arctic seem both
'extreme']{.underline} (located on the very edge) [and 'above' the rest
of the world]{.underline}. [For Inuit]{.underline}, who occupy a large
portion of the Arctic, [the notion of 'North' is far from self- evident,
sparking a conflict of definitions]{.underline} that has [implications
on the practice of cartography]{.underline}. A closer study of this
conflict brings forth the issue of Inuit relationship with land and
helps to explain decolonial initiatives involving maps. [From their
standpoint, Inuit ('humans')]{.underline} [live in nuna ('the
land').]{.underline} Drawing on the works of linguist Michael Fortescue
(1988), Louis- Jacques Dorais believes that the [orientation system used
by Inuit was based on other elements of the land rather than on abstract
directions]{.underline}. [Inuit only began using 'North' and
'South']{.underline} as reference points [as a result]{.underline} of
their [relationship to settlers]{.underline} (2009, 15-- 16).
Therefore[, for Inuit, the North is a relative notion used to orient
themselves]{.underline} on the land [but an absolute one when it comes
to colonial interactions]{.underline}. In this section, we therefore
reflect on Northern cartography from the point of view of Inuit mapping
initiatives, notably the Nunavik- based Nunatop project. The [creation
of the 'North' is a recent phenomenon for Inuit]{.underline}: it [stems
from]{.underline} a new [relationship with the colonial
'South',]{.underline} which began at various moments for different
territories.4 In his introduction to Taamusi Qumaq's remarkable memoir
Je veux que les Inuit soient libres de nouveau ('I want the Inuit to be
free again'), Dorais notes that [as late as the mid- twentieth century,
the Inuit realm of Nunavik had not yet been integrated into the Western
world,]{.underline} nor was it subjected to its ways of thinking and
modes of orientation: 'As a young man, the author was never concerned
with his ethnic or national belonging ... He was a human being (an
Inuk), who spoke Inuktitut and who travelled the land of humans (Inuit)
in search of means of survival for his community' (2009, 11). [For the
Inuit, the idea of living 'north of the North' or even 'in the North'
does not make much sense]{.underline}. [Inuit were forced to let go of
the idea that their world is central rather recently, as a result of the
colonial push towards Northern territories enacted by 'Southern'
nations]{.underline}.5 With the growing presence of qallunaat6 and the
ensuing [pressure on Inuit to trade in their traditional lifestyle for
the settler ways]{.underline}, the [term Inuit ceased to designate
'humans']{.underline} in [general and became a demonym]{.underline}.
[Western influence led to the 'invention']{.underline} of the [Nunavik
territory]{.underline} (see Canobbio 2009) -- [another
abstraction]{.underline} according to Qumaq7 -- [and forced its
inhabitants to adopt a new designation]{.underline}, first as 'Inuit'
and later by the more precise term 'Nunavimmiut'. Meanwhile, the
[integration of Western]{.underline} [concepts pushed Inuit
territory]{.underline} away from the centre [towards the North, and
later north of the North]{.underline}. It can thus be surmised that from
the perspective of North American Inuit, the [twentieth-
century]{.underline} [colonisation of the Arctic]{.underline} by
Southern nations [invented the ideas of 'North', 'far North', 'north of
the North', and 'grand nord' for mapping purposes and forcefully
introduced the usage of this lexicon to Arctic populations.]{.underline}

The Global Arctic

The [critics of the Arctic exceptionalist narrative have paved the way
to a new set of narratives about the region.]{.underline} In the 2010s,
[the Arctic became]{.underline} [narrated]{.underline} increasingly by
IR scholars [as being "embedded in global space]{.underline}", that is,
"[inextricably linked to global climatic, environmental, economic and
political systems and processes]{.underline}" (Keil & Knech, 2016, 4).
This narrative came to be called the "[global Arctic
paradigm]{.underline}" (Keil & Knecht, 2016, 10--11). [The common theme
in the paradigm]{.underline}, despite different versions, [is increasing
global interest in the Arctic beyond regional boundaries,]{.underline}
recognition of its economic and environmental significance, [and its
diminishing political agency]{.underline} (Keil & Knecht, 2016, 10--11;
see also Heininen & Southcott, 2010; Keskitalo & Nuttall, 2015).

T[he Arctic was seen as caught in the midst of globally driven
transformations]{.underline}: "The globalized Arctic includes both
directions: [global impacts within, and worldwide implications of the
Arctic]{.underline}" (Heininen & Finger, 2018, 200). [The
history]{.underline} of the region [was reinterpreted as background to
the narrative: globalization]{.underline} "is nothing new, since global
relations have influenced and been effected \[sic\] by the Arctic region
for centuries" [through fishing, whaling and sealing activities,
exploration and shipping routes, colonialism, exploration,
militarization and environmental degradation]{.underline} (Heininen,
2011, 36).

Climate change, access to resources, and transportation are problems of
global circulation which the Arctic contributes to, enables and benefits
from. The problem has been defined in material terms: [Arctic raw
materials appear as a promise to include Arctic goods in global trade
flows and their more effective circulation has global potential, but
requires development of infrastructure in the region]{.underline}. From
the point of view of governance, [the rationality is to maintain and
secure global economic circulation that has positive
effects]{.underline} while limiting circulation having negative impacts.
[The Global Arctic narrative shifts the attention from geopolitics to
geoeconomics]{.underline}. Economic development is not seen primarily in
terms of structures and institutions, but rather is projected in
patterns of movement of goods, money and labour, circulation of natural
resources and digital information, and free trade (Albert & Vasilache,
2021; Käpylä & Mikkola, 2016).

According to this narrative, the political agency of the Global Arctic
is no longer Arctic: "Thus, it is possible to say that [the future
development of the 'globalized' Arctic is no longer in the hands of
Arctic actors alone]{.underline}, whether we like it or not" (Heininen &
Finger, 2018, 200). [Political and economic development of the Arctic is
increasingly intertwined with politics beyond the region, and its
governance is decentralized]{.underline}, taking place locally,
nationally, regionally and globally. In the Global Arctic, political
agency is internationalized beyond the region, and diversified to
include a wide range of actors, both states and non-state actors, with
their own interests as regards the region and their particular
imaginaries (Corry, 2017; Keil & Knecht, 2016).

The plot of the [globalizing Arctic IR narratives strengthens "authority
and agency to certain claims on time, destiny and direction of the
Arctic for resource geopolitics and global change policies]{.underline}"
(Sörlin, 2018, 245). [The Arctic is used as an example of a particular
state-centric and anthropocentric "governance-object]{.underline}",
mainly [a natural science concern and a site for engineering
human-nature relations]{.underline} (Corry, 2017). [Climate
change-related concerns, threats and opportunities dominate the Global
Arctic paradigm as the main problems]{.underline}. [The problematic
paradox for IR scholars is the portrayal of the Arctic as a globally
relevant source of fossil fuels yet, at the same time, as a region
clearly showing the harmful impacts of a warming climate]{.underline}
(Palosaari, 2019).

[The Arctic,]{.underline} thus, [is a particular object to be governed
"globally]{.underline}". Corry (2017, 74) notes that the abstract
"globalist" IR narrative ignores the specific interests, agents and
localities of political action. The narrative paradigm reflects the
post-colonial roots of IR scholarship: [The Global Arctic paradigm
totalizes the Arctic]{.underline}---although in practice it is a
fragmented entity for governance---[views it from outside the region and
essentializes it as a resource region to respond to global
demand]{.underline}. As Felix Anderl and Antonia Witt note[, IR scholars
use the "the global" as a descriptive category, often unproblematized,
as an imagined space of politics, governance and knowledge]{.underline}.
This is often the case in Arctic IR. Instead, Anderl and Witt suggest
that in fact "globalisms" are many, with multiple narratives about them
as well as multiple ways to know "the global". [One needs to consider
where the particular understanding of "the global" comes from, how it is
narrated, by whom and with what effects]{.underline} (Anderl & Witt,
2020).

From a critical perspective, the paradox in the Global Arctic narrative
is the epistemic violence they exercise towards the diversity,
complexity and multiplicity of issues, actors and concerns in the
Arctic. Geographer Klaus Dodds (2018, 193) has pointed out that [if
terms like "Global Arctic" are used unthinkingly, the narrative "can
gloss over]{.underline}, smooth over, glide over" [the multiple
struggles in the Arctic over the uses of land and resources, competing
ideas of development and complex issues of sustainability]{.underline}.
This indifference towards the multifaceted Arctic ["worldliness" might
be interpreted as "epistemic violence"]{.underline}, an idea introduced
by Gayatri Spivak already in 1980s [in connection to colonialism and its
"Othering"]{.underline} practices (Spivak, 1988, 280; in connection to
IR, see Brunner, 2021). [The epistemic violence can be detected when the
Global Arctic narrative]{.underline}---as the dominant IR narrative
told, shared and repeated about the Arctic--- [overrides local
understandings]{.underline} of the issues, [obscures the multitude of
local and regional actors]{.underline}, such as Arctic cities and youth,
[and situates the region in the economically driven, competitive
world]{.underline} (Huggan, 2016, 6). Instead[, the narratives of the
Global Arctic]{.underline} "[could be used productively to]{.underline}
[think]{.underline} further [about]{.underline} situated [practices,
where Arctic and global imaginaries are promoted, negotiated and
exchanged]{.underline}" (Dodds, 2018, 193).

[The Arctic as a space of exception]{.underline}---both i[n the identifi
cation of climate change as an issue of global security and in the very
state of the region as being one of remote liminality]{.underline}---has
been "imagined and performed as a distinct \[\...\] space with its own
properties." 43 It is this [liminality, at once geographical and
political, which has enabled the Arctic to become a space that is both
paradigmatic of "masculinist fantasy and adventure" and deeply embedded
within performances of "paternal sovereignty"]{.underline} in
state-building and international relations---[characterisations which
are mirrored in contemporary accounts of Arctic geopolitics]{.underline}
at large. 44 Still, [some scholars argue against this type of
exceptionalism, suggesting]{.underline} that [the Poles are "exceptional
spaces" not just on account of their "size, loca- tion, \[and\]
remoteness," but also because of "their connectivity to wider global
political, legal and economic networks]{.underline} and practices." 45
Though it does not fall within the scope of this paper, the context of
Svalbard does raise an interesting point linked to the concerns of Abram
(this vol- ume), Bravo ( 2009) and others regarding silenced Arctic
voices. Though different peoples (e.g. Basque whalers, American
industrialists, Russian labourers, Thai restaurateurs, Canadian guides,
Swedish chefs) have come to Svalbard for sojourns of various periods,
the archipelago has not been permanently inhabited until the past
several decades. Due to the fact that most residents only remain on
Svalbard for between 6 months and a few years, one could argue that it
has never really been "settled" at all. This now-inhabited area of the
Arctic is thus distinct from other Northern regions with longer
histories of human habitation, casting into relief local concerns of
sovereignty and rights, among other geopolitical issues, in new ways.
[Through geopolitical action, the Arctic becomes conceptualised as both
an open (unclaimed, geopolitically undefi ned) space and an open- ing
(melting, disappearing) space,]{.underline} [leading many to pontifi
cate over various forms of "Arctic futures"]{.underline} (Anderson 2010;
see also Chap. 1 of this volume). In speculations of this kind, [the
Arctic comes to trace the contours of a geography of rich promise,
becoming "the locus of a potential oil bonanza, new strategic trade
routes and huge fi shing grounds]{.underline}." 46 [The result is that a
largely "empty space" ends up needing to be fi lled with evidence of
"effective operation]{.underline}," 47 [morphing into a theatre for
imagined or imaginary action of different kinds]{.underline}. Similarly,
Svalbard is connected---symbolically and metaphorically as well as
physically---with the rest of the world; indeed it could be argued that
[the more Svalbard develops, the less exceptional it
becomes]{.underline}. Certainly it is hardly as isolated as it once was
before modern technology irre- versibly connected it: on the contrary,
in terms of everyday life [it is now "a place where mobility is the norm
and fi xity the exception \[\...\], a partly global place \[where\]
researchers and students, but also people in other sectors, come from
all over the world]{.underline}." 48 Tourists are among these
globetrotters: the discount carrier Norwegian Airlines now fl ies
regularly from Oslo to Longyearbyen, while Finnair is scheduled to
launch its route from Helsinki to Longyearbyen in the summer of 2016.
Armchair travellers will soon join then: BBC Earth recently commis-
sioned a ten-part reality television programme, to be aired in 2016,
which will follow the everyday lives of several of Svalbard's residents
(Brzoznowski 2015).

### Link\-\--Ice

#### Temperate Normativity is rooted in the ice and weather of the arctic. Racialization in the arctic is in an unwavering cycle right now until real change occurs.

Temperate- normativity espouses the supposed nongenerative features of
ice as understood in contrast to a Western ideal of civilization in
temperate climes. Temperate- normativity is the idea that [all good
places are temperate, fertile, flower- ing, and full of normative kinds
of life.]{.underline} Temperate- normativity also arises in part from a
dependence upon forms of agriculture, a practice that is meant to act as
both a civilizational and government- making activity. That dependency
consequentially renders spaces of ice and those who call them home
supposedly aberrant and pathological. Ice is maligned because it does
not adhere to a temperate- normative requirement measured by
agricultural fertility that engenders stasis. James Scott writes that
the dominant version of "human prehistory" that most people learn is one
in which "fixed- field crops . . . were the origin and guarantor of the
settled life, of form religion, of society, and of government by laws."
25 Further, "those who refused to take up agriculture did so out of
ignorance or a refusal to adapt." 26 David Turnbull accords, writing
that "fixity in space and place has become the foundation stone of
Western rationality and epistemology . . . movement is equated with
wandering, irrationality, and the primitive, something that needs to be
controlled and set in log- ical, linear order." 27 [Ice geographies and
Arctic Indigenous peoples don't fit neatly into these logical, linear
orders that depend on rootedness in place to create their forms of
civilization]{.underline}. [Ice]{.underline} acts as the anti-
agriculture that [disturbs the very roots of the West.]{.underline} As
Michael Bravo writes, "The earth's frozen states have received bad press
for a very long time--- from societies whose agrarian and pasto- ral
values are rooted in systems of value that looked back to the classical
world of temperate Mediterranean ecosystems." 28 Raymond Williams
suggests that the etymology of civilization, as opposed to barbarity, is
bound up with methods of cultivation and, by relation, culture. He
writes, "Civilization, from \[the\] late 18th century, is a specific
combina- tion of the ideas of a process and an achieved condition. It
has behind it the general spirit of Enlightenment, with its emphasis on
secular and progressive human self- development . . . alternative words
were devel- oped to express other kinds of human development and other
criteria for human well- being, notably, culture." 29 Knotted up in the
concept of culture, then, is the importance of fixed settlement that
agriculture sup- posedly provides for the emergence and success of
correct, cultivated civilization. Movement, migration, and transit
relatedly, then, act as a counter to fixity and settlement, which
constitute the literal ground from which Western culture emerges. To
turn once more back to Hegel in this con- text, he writes, "Agriculture,
by its very nature, requires that the nomadic existence should come to
an end. It necessarily entails a settled way of life, and demands
foresight and provision for the future." 30 Here Hegel implies that
[peoples of certain geographies are not only racially inferior to those
who occupy temperate zones but that they are constitutively peoples of
transit]{.underline}. Temperate locales provide settlement whereas ice
geogra- phies, supposedly, force constant mobility and push humans to
migrate toward more "stable" resources or temperate climes.
Interestingly, Buf- fon's arguments differed from Hegel. He believed
that "the world's old- est, most developed, and largest plants and
animals originated in the North Pole when the global climate was warmer;
as it cooled these species moved southward . . . to seek the warmest
climates of Africa and Asia." 31 While Buffon's argument does not align
with the overarching theories of migration out and across a phantomatic
land bridge, his core idea is that cold climates are undesirable and
from which living things must flee toward warmer climes. Temperate-
normativity, then, is constituted in part by the idea that those who
[inhabit geographies of ice and other "nongenerative" environs are
racially inferior]{.underline} and that these same Indigenous peoples
are consti- tutively rendered peoples of pathological transit. Jodi Byrd
writes that to be in transit "is to be in motion, to exist liminally in
the ungriev- able spaces of suspicion and unintelligibility. To be in
transit is to be made to move." 32 In this case, Arctic Indigenous
peoples become invari- ably unintelligible as geographies of ice are
said to force constant and pathologized movement. [Ice as a historically
racialized geography pro- duces inferior human beings and, in its
rootless materiality, presupposes a coerced movement]{.underline}. This
conjuring of aberrant migrancy is implicated within other narratives of
transit--- namely, human migrations across and out of geographies of ice
toward settlement in temperate locales. Nat- ural historians of the
eighteenth century were equally interested in the influences of climate
upon the body as they were in tracing human ori- gins and their
migrations. The [**racialization of Arctic ice,** and the constant
transit it suppos- edly necessitates, is **entwined with concerns of
origins**]{.underline}. For example, in Immanuel Kant's "Of the
Different Races of Human Beings," he hypothe- sized that the race
"displaced into the arctic zone" is not only of "smaller stature" due to
the risk from cold but also that "most of the now- known inhabitants of
the arctic zone seemingly are but late arrivals there . . . and have
taken up their present seat only since the emigration from the east- ern
part of Asia." 33 [Kant's musings illuminate entangled concerns about
the nature of human migrations and temperate- normative notions of
livable landscape. His argument renders Indigenous Arctic peoples'
**relationships to land as recent** and therefore suspect.]{.underline}
Temperate- normativity also assumes that typical and logical human
migrations occurred through the move out of undesirable cold climates
and into preferable temperate climes. Thomas Jefferson, in his 1787
Notes on the State of Virginia, wrote: Discoveries, long ago made, were
sufficient to shew that a passage from Europe to America was always
practicable, even to the imper- fect navigation of ancient times . . .
discoveries of Captain Cook . . . have proved that, if the two
continents of Asia and America be sepa- rated at all, it is only by a
narrow streight \[sic\]. So that from this side also, inhabitants have
passed into America: and the resemblance between the Indians of America
and the Eastern inhabitants of Asia, would induce us to conjecture, that
the former are the descen- dants of the latter, or the latter of the
former.34

Whatever the nature of the postcolonial society, language always
negotiates a kind of gap between the word and its signification. In this
sense, the dynamic of naming becomes a primary colonizing pro‑ cess
because it appropriates, defines and captures the place in language.
Perhaps the most comprehensive example of this is the drafting of the
Mercator projection Atlas in 1636. [The map demonstrates
that]{.underline} [geog‑ raphy,]{.underline} like place itself[, 'is a
series of erasures and overwritings which have transformed the
world']{.underline} (Rabasa 1993: 358). [Our most]{.underline} profound,
ubiqui‑ tous and [unquestioned assumptions about the physical shape of
the globe and its continents can thus be seen to be specific evidence of
the power of European discourse to naturalize its construction of the
world itself]{.underline}. [The provision of names to the non‑European
world through **exploration** and 'discovery' is thus an elaboration of
the dynamic of control that the Atlas presupposes]{.underline}. To name
a place is to announce discursive control over it by the very act of
inscription, because through names, location becomes metonymic of those
processes of travel, annexation and colonization that effect the
dominance of imperial powers over the non‑European world. The control
over place that the act of naming performs extends even to an ecological
imperialism in which the fauna, flora and the actual physical character
of colonized lands changes under the pressure of the practical
outworking of the European con‑ cern with property: enclosure,
agriculture, importation of European plants and weeds; the destruction
of indigenous species; possibly even the changing of weather patterns.

[EUROCENTRISM The conscious or unconscious process by which Europe and
European cultural assumptions are constructed as, or assumed to be, the
normal, the natural or the universal]{.underline}. [The
first,]{.underline} and possibly most potent [sign of
Eurocentrism]{.underline}, as José Rabasa explains (1993), [was the
specific projection]{.underline} employed [to **construct the Mercator
Atlas**]{.underline} itself, [a projection that favoured the European
temperate zones in its distribution of size]{.underline}. [This map of
the world is not merely an objective outline of discovered continents,
but an 'ideological or mythological reification of space' which opens up
the territories of the world to domination and
appropriation.]{.underline} '[The world']{.underline} only [acquired
spatial meaning]{.underline} [after different regions had been
**inscribed by Europeans**]{.underline}, and this inscription, [apart
from locating Europe at the top of the globe or map, established an
ideological figuration]{.underline}, through the accompanying text and
illustrations, which [firmly centralized Europe as the source and
arbiter of spatial and cultural meaning]{.underline}. By the eighteenth
century [this conception of a collective 'Europe' constructed as a sign
of superiority]{.underline} and [in opposition to the rest of the
world's cultures]{.underline} had become firmly consolidated. Then, as
now, [such collective constructions existed in a troubled or ambivalent
relationship with an alternative stress on the nationalism of emerging
individual European nation-states]{.underline} and their particular
cultures. [European colonization]{.underline} of the rest of the globe,
which accelerated in the eighteenth century and reached its apogee in
the nineteenth, actively promoted or [facilitated Eurocentrism through
**exploration**, conquest and trade]{.underline}. Imperial displays of
power, both in the metropolitan centres and at the colonial peripheries,
and assertions of intellectual authority in colonialist institutions
such as schools and universities, and through the civil service and
legal codes, established European systems and values as inherently
superior to indigenous ones. Edward Said's Orientalism examines [the
ways in which Eurocentrism not only influences and alters, but actually
produces other cultures.]{.underline} Orientalism is 'a way of coming to
terms with the orient that is based on the orient's special place in
European western experience'(1978:1) or 'the western style for
dominating, restructuring and having authority over the orient' (3).
This authority is, in Said's view, a product of a systematic
'discipline' by which European culture was able to construct and manage
the Orient during the post-Enlightenment period. [Eurocentrism is
masked]{.underline} in literary study [by concepts such as literary
universality]{.underline}, in history by [authoritative
interpretations]{.underline} written from the point of view of the
victors, [and]{.underline} in early anthropology by [the unconscious
assumptions involved in the idea that its data were those societies
defined as 'primitive' and so opposed to a European norm of
**development**]{.underline} and civilization. Some cultural critics
have argued that anthropology as a discipline in its classic, unrevised
form came into being in such a close relationship with colonization that
it could not have existed at all without the prior existence of
Eurocentric concepts of knowledge and civilization. [Eurocentrism is
also present in the]{.underline} assumptions and practices of
Christianity through education and mission activity, as well as in in
the [assumed superiority of Western mathematics, **cartography**, art
and numerous other cultural and social practices which have been
claimed, or assumed, to be based on a universal, objective set of
values.]{.underline}

Unscrambling the arctic

[While Arctic scientific research and exploration has contributed to
knowledge]{.underline} about the polar regions and the planet more
broadly, [one must not divorce these interests from economic
ones]{.underline}. [Scientific research and economic and political
interests have long been interconnected]{.underline} (Cornelia and
Summerhayes 2012; Roberts 2011). [Practices of mapping and survey- ing,
for example, **were central to the early geopolitical formation of
Arctic spaces**]{.underline}. [Early]{.underline} whalers and maritime
[explorers drew the first maps of the region,]{.underline} while [one of
the tasks of nineteenth-century industrial exploration was
to]{.underline} examine coastal areas and [improve geological knowledge
in the search for valuable **mineral resources**.]{.underline} A
state-funded expedition that led to the establishment of mining
activities could in turn improve the influence of that country in the
archipelago. From a broader perspective, [even much of the **seemingly
"pure" science** of today is economically and politically
motivated]{.underline}, with [countries often sponsoring expensive polar
research in order to bulk up their presence in these regions and thereby
increase their influence]{.underline}. The [search for exploitable
mineral resources continues]{.underline} up to the present
day---primarily for oil and gas, though there is still ongoing surveying
in Svalbard for further coal deposits. [Deep drilling]{.underline},
especially for oil, began in the 1960s, and even though some of the
results were withheld due to competition between the companies, these
expensive drilling programmes, like later seismic shootings,
[contributed to knowledge of geological structures deep under the
surface]{.underline}. [Research both in and on the Arctic has "long been
constituted via constellations of emotional and embodied practices as
well as epistemic ones."]{.underline} 23 [Such research has been
constituted by "complicated relationships between activities which were
construed to be scientific whilst also allowing some sort of
demonstration of territorial sovereignty."]{.underline} 24 Furthermore,
as was the case with jostling for mineral resources during the previous
cen- tury, [research itself now represents a **geography of
international competition**]{.underline} on Svalbard. Linked to the
[increase in research activity is the growing conflict between
ecological research and protection of the environment, or between

[FRONTIER The idea of a frontier, a boundary or a limiting zone to
distinguish one space or people from another, is clearly much older and
used more widely than in colonial and post-colonial theory]{.underline}.
There is,for example, a broad study of frontier history in American
Studies, beginning with the so-called 'Turner thesis' advanced by
Frederick Jackson Turner in 1893 (see Taylor 1971; Philp and West 1976).
[Turner theorized that American development could be explained by the
existence of a vast area of free land into which American settlement
advanced westward.]{.underline} Turner [saw the frontier as the
essential guarantor of American democratic freedoms, because whenever
social conditions put pressure on employment or when political
restraints tended to impede freedom, individuals could escape to the
free conditions of the frontier.]{.underline} [Men would not accept
inferior wages and a permanent position of social
insubordination]{.underline}, he believed, w[hen a promised land of
freedom and equality was open to everyone for the taking]{.underline}.
Significantly, [Turner also observed that the open frontier was already
an environment of the past]{.underline} [and]{.underline} that
[Americans should]{.underline} of necessity [**move on** to another
chapter of history]{.underline}. Regardless of the validity of his
thesis as a whole (and it has been severely critiqued as largely
unproven by empirical evidence), few will quarrel with his assertion
that [the American frontier experience has been central to
self-perceptions of identity in the United States]{.underline} as a
result of its ubiquity in mass culture. [It is]{.underline}, of course,
[significant that the frontier is perceived by Turner primarily as a
shaping force on the westward expanding settler population]{.underline},
[and little interest is shown]{.underline} in the perception of this
expansion [by the indigenous populations of the so-called
frontier]{.underline}. Thus recent accounts by historians and others of
native American reactions to the westward expansion are a necessary
corrective to this dominant myth of the West as a land of freedom and
escape. For the Indians, the frontier experience was very different
(Berkhofer 1978). The centrality of the idea to settler American
selfperceptions may have had a great deal to do with the popularity of
the term, and frontier studies have always been a major component of
American studies ever since.The term has also been internationalized by
modern American historians such as McNeill who took the idea of the
frontier and argued that it should be seen as one of the most dominant
tropes of recent world history (McNeill 1983). Nevertheless, in its more
recent use within post-colonial cultures, it has taken on a particular
local significance. [Colonial frontiers were created as imperial
discourse sought to define and invent the entities it shaped from its
conquests]{.underline}. The [numerous ruler-straight frontiers of
imperial maps indicate how colonial cartography existed as much to
**invent** as to record actual features and distinctions between various
places and peoples.]{.underline} [The]{.underline} frontier or [boundary
that limited the space so defined was a crucial feature in imagining the
imperial self, and in creating and defining (othering]{.underline})
those others by which that 'self'could achieve definition and value.
[That which lies 'beyond the pale']{.underline} (itself a metaphor
invoking one of the earliest delimiting frontiers of colonial Ireland,
the fence between the Protestant enclave of Dublin and the wild,
Catholic lands beyond) [is often defined literally as the other, the
dark, the savage and the wild]{.underline}. As well as literal
frontiers, [the discourse of empire was metaphorically concerned to
delineate boundaries and frontiers]{.underline}, [inventing categories
for which the spatial was always and only a loose image for a perceived
or desired racial, cultural or gendered divide]{.underline}. 'East is
East and West is West, and never the twain shall meet' wrote Kipling
(1889), suggesting that the idea of a West and East had less physical
than metaphysical boundaries. Even the creation of some literal
juncture, 'East of Suez', seems less than physically specific, since
[Egypt, the land of the joining frontier,]{.underline} [has
been]{.underline} at different times [defined both as the cradle of
European civilization and the heart of the exotic]{.underline} and
dangerous Orient, as discourses shift and meet on a terrain of
abstraction to which frontiers and spatial categories refer only as
metonyms. [The idea of a frontier civilization implies a civilization
where rules of law and social graces wither as man reverts to a state of
nature]{.underline}. [The frontier then becomes a place of
savagery]{.underline}. But it is also frequently imagined as a place
where men (the pronoun is deliberate) can test themselves and where the
effete weakness of the civilized can be bred into a renewed strength
(Low 1996). [This ambivalence is always present in construction of
settler frontier narratives,]{.underline} [as the idea of civilization
is both upheld and critiqued]{.underline} from the rude but vigorous
perspective of the frontier world. Significantly, [frontier narratives
by women are far less romantic and more often emphasize the harsh daily
realities of survival]{.underline} (Moodie 1852).

#### The aff's view of the arctic as a "development zone" is a reinforcement of neoliberal and neocolonial agendas and reduces the Arctic and its people

[Neocolonialism is another tricky term in the context of the
contemporary Arctic]{.underline}. As Philip Altbach explains, "[modern
neocolonialism differs from traditional colonialism in that it does not
involve direct political control,"]{.underline} but "[it is similar in
that some aspects of domination by the advanced nation over the
developing country remain]{.underline}" (Philip Altbach, "Education and
Neocolonialism," in The Post-Colonial Studies Reader, ed. Bill Ashcroft,
Gareth Griffi ths, and Helen Tiffi n \[London: Routledge, 1995\], 452.).
[Neocolonialism]{.underline}, Altbach suggests[, is "partly a planned
policy of advanced nations to maintain their infl uence in developing
countries]{.underline}" (ibid.). [This defi nition]{.underline} might
hold good for African countries but it [seems inappropriate for the
Arctic]{.underline}, [which is not a "developing country,"]{.underline}
[rather]{.underline}---and I am fully aware that the designation is
tendentious---[an internally **differentiated**, partly **autonomous**
regional development zone]{.underline}. Still, [an argument can be made
that northern indigenous peoples, in particular, are currently being
subjected to new forms of colonialism thrown up by changing economic as
well as geographical conditions in the Arctic]{.underline}.
[These]{.underline} conditions [are linked in turn to the global agendas
set by neoliberalism]{.underline}, [which some]{.underline} Marxist
commentators, David Harvey prominent among them, [see as the primary
ideological expression of imperialism today]{.underline} (Harvey 2003).
For my pur- poses here, [I will see neoliberalism and neocolonialism as
related but non- identical phenomena]{.underline}, [linked]{.underline}
fi rst and foremost [by the desire to control markets in majority
interests]{.underline}. T[o see the Arctic as a "regional **development
zone"** is in part a function of the global pact between neoliberalism
and neocolonialism]{.underline}; [part of the task of decolonising the
region is]{.underline} therefore [to alter these objectifying
terms]{.underline} of reference, [reinstating the Arctic]{.underline}
(and Arctic peoples) [as autonomous subjects rather than instrumental
objects of foreign economic interest, national political consideration,
or global eco- logical concern.]{.underline}

#### Arctic development results in an indigenous "[scramble for survival]{.underline}" that results from [colonialist paternalism]{.underline}

Let me begin, as I did in the last section, by dealing in turn with two
very different examples, Laurence C. Smith's The New North ( 2012) and
Alun Anderson's After the Ice ( 2009): both well-written books aimed at
a gen- eral readership, and both designed at least in part to capture
the volatile atmosphere, as well as the changing strategic importance,
of the High North. The premise of Smith's vivid thought experiment,
which projects the world forward to 2050, is to ask whether mounting
global pressures might cause new societies to emerge in places that
might otherwise seem to be unappealing, even unamenable, to human
settlement. The provisional answer it gives is that it is the northern
geographic regions that will assume an exponentially higher strategic
value, and correspondingly greater economic importance, than they have
today. 30 [The]{.underline} scene is set for Smith's "[New
North]{.underline}," which he envisions in terms of "all land and oceans
lying 45 \[degrees north\] or higher currently held by the United
States, Canada, Iceland, Greenland (Denmark), Norway, Sweden, Finland,
and Russia," 31 [an economically rather than geographically defined
region]{.underline} he also dubs, with a sly nod to its profit-indexed
Pacific counterpart, the "Northern Rim." [The ascent of the
North]{.underline}, Smith suggests, [owes to the pressures brought about
by chronic overpopulation and the increased demand for natural resources
it entails]{.underline}. [The Arctic]{.underline}---less clearly defi
ned---[belongs to this "New North]{.underline}," but as a periphery of
it, and Smith conforms to [populist understandings of the Arctic as a
globally connected space, but also one that is paradoxi- cally "cut off
from the rest of the world.]{.underline}" 32 Smith is less enamoured of
the populist rhetoric of "scramble," which he briefl y
invokes---intensifying resource wars, the dismal prospect of
remilitarisation, and so on---only to turn his back on it, siding
instead with Young and others in seeing the Arctic as having entered a
new era of fruitful cooperation---a coopera- tive spirit which has
persisted, he says, "despite \[all\] the hype about mad scrambles and
looming Arctic wars." 33 Instead, he suggests, the stage is set for
another kind of carve-up from which the Northern Rim countries (he uses
the unfortunate acronym NORCs) stand massively to gain---not least from
the much-anticipated new northern seaways that will spring up to feed an
already hungry Arctic maritime economy, allowing ships to gorge in situ
on northern oil and gas, then turn around and carry it to eagerly
waiting markets in the south. 34 This vision of plenty, hyperbolic in
its turn, is backed up by the cheerful view of Northern Rim cities,
despite their cold winters, ranking "among the world's happiest places
to live." 35 This is only likely to continue, Smith suggests, as
"against a global backdrop of rising material wealth, envi- ronmental
stress, and total human population \[\...\] smaller, fl ourishing
cultures \[are set to grow\] amid the milder winters and abundant
natural resources packed into the northern quarters of the planet." 36
The Arctic belongs to this clement vision, though Smith implicitly
critiques stereo- typical views of "a place \[once\] perceived as a
maritime graveyard and killer of men \[and\] now perceived as dissolving
into a frontier ocean, laden with natural-resource riches for the
taking." He furthermore pointedly adds that such contrapuntal images
have been "fi rmly cemented into pub- lic consciousness" precisely
because there "are so few actual Arctic resi- dents around to protest
these frames." 37 Smith notably fails, however, to enquire [what might
become of these peripheral residents of the "New North,"]{.underline} or
to [ponder the implications of those new geographies of
poverty]{.underline}---within as well as between regions--- [that have
recently arisen under the conditions of globalisation.]{.underline} The
[geography of poverty invokes a different kind of scramble, not so much
the scramble for profi t as the scramble to survive]{.underline} (Bravo
2014; see also Klare 2013). Anderson's account, while it has problems of
its own, certainly cannot be accused of overlooking this. More
interested than Smith in see- ing the Arctic as a region in its own
right, Anderson nonetheless admits that [this region has been
discursively fashioned by outsiders]{.underline}---"[the scien- tists
who study it, the politicians who want to control it, \[and\] the oilmen
who \[seek\] to exploit it"---rather than by "those \[diverse\]
indigenous peo- ple who call it home."]{.underline} 38 He tries to
counteract this objectifying tendency by spending time with the local
(Canadian) Inuit. But he only fi nds that, despite surface confi dence
in the future, [histories of "colonial paternal- ism" 39 are being
replayed in the poor living conditions, and overall lack of economic
opportunities, to which many Arctic indigenous communities are currently
being subjected.]{.underline} They are [also replayed in the government-
sponsored dependency that keeps Inuit and other northern indigenous
peoples locked in "a state of fi nancial and emotional
despair]{.underline}." 40 Here as elsewhere, Anderson rehearses "dark
ecological" tropes of the Arctic that are powerfully if predictably
associated with "the fastest single environmental catastrophe to hit
this planet since the rise of human civi- lization": contemporary
anthropogenic climate change. 41 And as might similarly be expected, he
also supports ["scramble" scenarios that pit Arctic stakeholders against
each other in an essentially unwinnable struggle for natural resources,
and "vanishing" scenarios that foresee the disappear- ance of keystone
Arctic species, great and small alike.]{.underline} [Arctic
**development**]{.underline}, Anderson suggests, [is a **catalogue of
risks**, just as its ecology is a compilation of "horror
stories."]{.underline} 42 [Even the oil and gas boom, which has the
potential to bring jobs and prosperity to the region, is]{.underline}
written off as "[short-lived]{.underline}." [Arctic oil]{.underline},
Anderson gloomily contemplates, [might soon enough become "as archaic as
wooden warships]{.underline}," and if gas will run further, it too seems
inexorably destined to run out. 43 Thus, while Anderson does not rule
out the possibility of an environmentally protected Arctic that belongs
to "the global community, with living standards to match," he seems much
more drawn to its negative counterpart, which conjures up visions of an
"aban- doned" rather than a "sustainable" Arctic---one that leaves
"Arctic people living \[in a ruined landscape\] among transient workers
from the south." 44

### Link\-\--Infrastructure

#### Infrastructure projects are a means in which the state striates space. The cumulative, slow atrocity is made possible through notions of progress and development 

**Plessis 20** \[du Gitte; Academy of Finland Research Fellow based @

and Nomadic Forms of Life in the Arctic"; International Political
Sociology; vol 14; pgs 347-365; 2020\] sems

[The problem is land grabbing.]{.underline} The government expropriates
land for roads and tunnels, wind farms and mines. Our land is being
eroded by development. Almost half of our winter lands have gone. I fear
that in future there will be nowhere left for the reindeer. (Aslak Eira,
quoted in Vidal 2016)

According to Deleuze and Guattari, [the state seeks to striate and
control flows until no smooth space is left. This endeavor by the state
is an indirect, slow]{.underline} (Nixon 2011) [type of violence to
nomadic forms of life, which squeezes them bit by bit, making the
cumulative effects at once discreet and deadly.]{.underline} In the
spatial politics of the Nordic states, **[the state's infrastructure is
the main perpetrator of this violence.]{.underline}** Mundane [objects
such as roads, railroads, mines, and leisure cabins]{.underline}, benign
and necessary as they may seem, [are committing a cumulative
atrocity]{.underline}, [bolstered by lofty legitimizations related to
renewable energy, jobs, or progress.]{.underline}

Environmental impact assessment reports attending specifically to how
different infrastructure projects will affect and have affected reindeer
herding practices are a display of how this violence takes place. For
example, [a 2017 report on the estimated effects on reindeer herding of
building a new road]{.underline} (E8) from the south into Tromsø,
Norway, [is a showcase of the detrimental effects of state striation for
reindeer nomadism]{.underline} (Riseth, Johansen, and Danielsen 2017).
Based on research by Sámi professor Sara (1999), the report describes
the movement of reindeer for each season---how the reindeer in early
summer move down in the terrain for new sprouts that emerge first in
lower lands. In mid-summer, the reindeer shed their fur and become very
sensitive to sun, cold, rain, and especially insects (see also Sara
2009). Mosquitoes can drive the reindeer up on high plateaus, and,
during the summer, the reindeer migrate up and down depending on heat
and rain. In late summer and early fall when insects and heat have
subsided, the reindeer seek forested areas with ample pasture and will
also travel far and wide in the forest to find mushrooms. As the first
snow falls in the fells, the reindeer seek even further down, into
marshes to find their food. In the winter, the reindeer depend on lichen
that they can dig out from under the snow or find hanging on trees.

The E8 report describes how [gradual state striation of reindeer space
results in fragmentation of reindeer pasturelands through direct effects
when pastureland is simply lost; through indirect effects when reindeer
shy far away from disturbances and consequently abandon some pastures
and also lose energy and body weight; and, finally, through cumulative
effects, which are the sum of past and present
disturbances.]{.underline} Different [infrastructure projects with small
individual effects can, in conjunction]{.underline}, [have catastrophic
effects because they undermine]{.underline} the aforementioned
[flexibility]{.underline} that is [essential to reindeer
herding]{.underline} (see also Johnsen, Mathiesen, and Eira 2017).

The reindeer-herding district that will be affected by the new E8 road
is already under severe pressure, most notably on its winter pastures,
which are overlapped by the Mauken-Blåfjell military training area. The
E8 will affect the summer pastures, harming the adaptability that came
from compensating for pressure on winter pastures. Also, an expanding
area with recreational cottages puts pressure on pastures, as does the
general expansion of Tromsø city. [The report concludes that E8 will
effectively close off corridors for passing reindeer herds between
different summer pastures and will cause the loss of marsh and forest
pastures]{.underline} (Riseth, Johansen, and Danielsen 2017, 39). The
report therefore recommends heavy investments in fencing,
noise-reduction, and infrastructure that allow reindeer to cross over
and under the road in critical locations. In essence, the environmental
impact assessment recommends that the territorialization of the road
should come equipped with its own partial deterritorialization.

A 2017 report on the railway line Nordlandsbanen mentioned in the
introduction, describes how the railway strips away large areas of
pasture land, and herders spend a lot of energy driving their herds away
from areas close to the railroad, which are then areas that, due to
limited pasture activity, become extra appetizing to the reindeer.
According to the report, it is difficult to directly compare the costs
of putting up and maintaining fencing along the railway to keep reindeer
off it, and the cost of compensating herders for lost animals (Rolandsen
et al. 2017). For such a comparison to be difficult, one must be blind
to any value of reindeer life that cannot be calculated vis-a-vis the
value of reindeer meat.

The Finnish state is pursuing a proposed railway line from Rovaniemi to
Kirkenes---dubbed "The Arctic Corridor"---which would enable Chinese and
Russian goods shipped via the Northern Passage to Kirkenes to make their
way to Europe via a tunnel from Helsinki to Tallinn. This would
establish Finland as a geopolitical node ready to reap the advantages of
the Chinese Belt and Road initiative, untapped oil and gas in the
Barents sea, and mining potential in Lapland (Breum 2018a; Wall 2019).
The proposed railway line would cut through traditional Sámi reindeer
herding lands:

Everybody would lose their jobs if the railway comes. Our land would be
divided---it would be like a new border . . . Reindeer follow migration
paths through forests. If they can't, there will not be enough food to
feed them all. (Jussa Seurujärvi quoted in Wall 2019)

Tiina Sanila-Aikio, the president of the Finnish Sámi Parliament, views
the process of dividing lands by a railroad and then handing them over
to foreign investors as a slow colonization (quoted in Wall 2019). As
she says:

This means the end of the Sami people, because there are no
possibilities to practice traditional livelihoods. Then the Sami are
extinct. (Quoted in Wall 2019)

Despite such statements from Sámi representatives, in 2019 the Regional
Council of Lapland added the railway to an updated regional land use
plan, enabling its construction. The council's vice-chair, Heikki Autto,
maintained that the rail project is too important for any single
interested party to have a veto over it and pointed out that the Sámi do
not have a veto on "land use planning" (Yle News 2019).

[Each new infrastructure project tends to grow in scale over time,
encroaching further into smooth spaces.]{.underline} As reindeer herder
Mikkel Isak Sara says about yet another proposed infrastructure project
in his reindeer district, this time a "small" hydroelectric plant that
would build a dam in a fell water system that provides cooling for
reindeer on hot summer days:

[The plans will probably become larger than they say. In the beginning
they just want a little bit, and then later the plans are
expanded]{.underline}. . . . We see that there has previously been given
concessions to building small hydroelectric plants in our herding
district. These have grown and grown over time. Even small gravel pits
are still growing in scale. \[Even one leisure hut poses a threat,
because\] [After that there will often be an application for one more.
And another one. Another. And finally, you have a huge hut field that
needs a road.]{.underline} This again increases traffic. (quoted in
Larsen 2018; translated from Norwegian by author)

[Different striation activities slowly chip away at smooth space,
territorializing it bit by bit. First, the extra
pasture]{.underline}---the one for difficult times or the one allowing
the other to rest---[is taken away. Then the Sámi can be blamed for
reindeer overgrazing on the remaining land]{.underline} (Forbes 2006;
Benjaminsen et al. 2015).9

[Smooth space takes up a lot of space in the eyes of the state, whose
goal is to striate until nothing is left. Each new infrastructure
project is proposed in the name of "jobs," "progress," "renewable
energy," "the interest of the majority," or even in the name of
opportunities for the Sámi]{.underline}, so they won't disappear in a
modern world, [followed by obligatory rounds of environmental impact
assessments and coercive "dialogues," in which herders are given small
but nonessential concessions and are assured that nothing will be put up
unless agreed to, except everything ends up being put up without being
agreed to, or the impacts are much more severe than initially outlined.
To seize]{.underline} its [space]{.underline}, [the state engages in
bureaucratic feints in which, keeping everything within its own
administrative systems and logics, it play-acts due diligence and claims
to be legitimate according to itself]{.underline}.10 Examples abound of
[this bureaucratic dance]{.underline} in which the state slowly seizes
its space while ignoring Sámi [concerns about an end to a form of
life.]{.underline}

### Link\-\--Oil

#### Oil extraction enacts necropolitics in the Arctic---Extraction renders the Khanty people as disposable- oil driven necropolitics turns their living culture into a symbol of extinction.

The contrast between [the oil seeker's map and the liquid map of the
river creates a juxtaposition between the oil and the river, the two
liquids flowing on and under the ground. These concrete and material
fluids are entangled in manifold webs of discourses, desires and
imaginaries]{.underline}. The inseparability of what is imagined and
what is material in Aipin's descriptions of flowing water and oil bring
forth Gaston Bachelard's (1983) argument on using the interconnectedness
of imaginary176 E. Kuikka concepts and material entities to express
abstract ideas. In the novel, the river appears as an element that is
ultimately connected with life as its physical flow is parallelised with
the flows of life, time and memories and, at the same time, it sus-
tains the organic life of the Khanty people by providing them with the
necessary living conditions. Mika Perkiömäki (2021) has noticed a
similar tendency to imag- ine and present the major Siberian rivers in
Russian village prose texts as "rivers of life". The metaphor
"underline\[s\] the common history, interdependency and fate of the
river and the people' and 'connects to the active, agentic river, whose
actions have implications for both human culture and the more-than-human
world" (Perkiömäki, 2021, p. 110). He has also noticed a prevailing
metaphor of the "river of death" that presents the river as "dangerous
and lethal" or as related to environmental damage and contamination (p.
107). In contrast to Perkiömäki's observations, the river and the water
in Aipin's novel do not bear any lethal connotations as the deadly
characteristics are attached to the oil. [The oil, depicted as "the
black, hot grease" (Aipin, 2014, p. 24) that flows in the black pipes,
becomes a literal stream of death as oil pumping destroys the
environment for both human and non-human entities. The notion of death
is drawn on the geologists' maps as well as the lines marking out
possible oil deposits signify destruction for everything that gets in
the way of those lines. If the river serves as a live, flowing and
constantly transforming map of the watery milieu that connects the lives
of the Khanty people with the non-human entities with which they share
and co-constitute the space they inhabit, the streams of the oil draw a
map that enforces settler-colonial power and an instrumentalised view of
the non-human world. Whereas the river adapts to the relief of the
environment and sustains the ecosystems and living entities to which it
is connected, the oil reserves lead to constructions of straight
railway- and pipelines whose build- ers "cut down pine woods, covered
swamps, built bridges over big and small rivers" (Aipin, 2014, p.
24).]{.underline}

The fear that the oil seekers provoke in Dem'ian is based on what he has
heard from the regions where oil is already pumped. The novel's
temporally non-linear narrative structure reveals to the reader that his
concern is not in vain by revealing the destructive development of the
region to the reader through the narrative line that follows Dem'ian's
son Mikul'. Even if Aipin's novel entails depictions of brute acts of
violence, especially in the flashbacks depicting the purges of the
1930s, the main narrative strategy of presenting colonial violence in
the novel is to underline the long-term impacts of the settlers and the
environmental colonialism experienced by the Khanty people. In the next
section of this chapter, I argue that the depiction of the
settler-colonial violence in the novel can be read through Rob Nixon's
(2011) concept of slow violence. In my view, Aipin's novel offers a
demonstrative example of how slow violence can constitute different
interrelated and cumulative processes that have a destructive effect on
both subaltern groups of people and the non-human world.10

As presented earlier in this chapter, [Nixon's slow violence is a
concept that is used to describe gradual violence, the effects of which
are only visible in the long term or/and in the distance, effects that
may not be even recognised as violence.]{.underline} This graduality and
temporal dispersal is visible in Aipin's novel, and whereas Nixon (2011,
p. 3) pointed out what challenges presenting slow violence might face,
Aipin's work resolves this problem through its narrative structure. When
the narra- tion of the novel leaps back and forth between the past,
present and the future, vio- lent causal connections whose consequences
are not revealed during one's lifetime or during a generation are made
visible. In particular, the narrator's tendency to move into the future
and narrate Mikul's experiences in adulthood sheds light on the
disastrous results of the Soviet policies and resource extraction.

Despite the novel's anachronism, the reader can distinguish the
development of the region since the establishment of the Soviet power
and the arrival of oil seekers. In the beginning of Dem'ian's journey,
he recalls a time "when he did not think of anything other than hunting
and fishing" and "a peace lived in his soul[". That peace is ended when
"new people appeared on the Vat'ëgan river to build a metal road"
(Aipin, 2014, p. 23), and at the time of Dem'ian's journey, "\[t\]he
bottomlands in the East were split in two by a pipe; there was oil in
the South and a railway line in the West" (p. 42).]{.underline} The
consequences of Soviet policies for the Khanty's home region are already
present by the time Dem'ian makes his journey: the hunters' hunting
areas of the "lowest river" have been destroyed, alcohol consumption is
slowly increasing, and Khanty families suffer from a lack of reindeer,
the most important companion of Indigenous hunters moving across the
taiga. However, only the narrator's leaps to the1980s with Dem'ian's
grown-up son Mikul' reveals the tragic development of the situation.

[Mikul's experiences and observations in his home region underline the
interconnectedness of the resource extraction, environmental degradation
and wilting of the Indigenous community:]{.underline}

[Under the pressure of geologists and oil men the village slowly fell in
onto economic depression. First, the cooperative lost its reindeer herd
of 300 reindeer, then its cows and horses. Growing vegetables ended due
to a lack of fertilizers. Game and fish disappeared due to contamination
of lakes and rivers]{.underline} and unreasonable logging. That forced
people to close down the fox farm. (Aipin, 2014, p. 265)

[The environmental degradation and animal loss that bring an end to the
traditional livelihoods is followed by alienation of Native children
from their parents' culture as boarding schools move further away from
the taiga and into urban centres. All these factors are depicted as
interrelated and leading to the gradual decline of the Native people.
Therefore, Aipin's description of the consequences of settler
colonialism is in line with Wakeham's (2021) notes on slow, attritional
violence leading to the annihilation of Indigenous societies, social
practices and cultures with a geno- cidal effect (cf. Wolfe,
2006).]{.underline}

The correlation between [environmental damage and social decline is
illustrated through the interconnectedness of the settler-colonial flows
of death, oil and spirits.]{.underline} In the same way that the people
who map the region and extract its oil come to the taiga from outside,
spirits are also brought there from elsewhere. Yet, it is the river
along which alcohol is transported: "The river did its job: it fed and
watered. But it did not only give clear water to drink. A regular
transportation of boxes with alcohol bottles to [the]{.underline}
village began ten years later" (Aipin, 2014, p. 125). The same river
that connects the Khanty families with each other and connects the
Khanty people with the region also connects the area with other parts of
the country, and [the river flow carries the alcohol that then flows
down the Khanty people's throats. However, the "era of the bottle"
(Aipin, 2014, pp. 125--126) only starts after the arrival of the oil
seekers and the village they establish]{.underline}, where "the shops
are open without a break and during the weekends" (p. 125). The
intersections of these different flows bring out the embodied character
of the relationship between the Khanty people and their home region. As
these liquids flow between different regions, as well as between human
bodies and the non-human environment, they point to the porosity of
their interfaces in a trans-corporeal way and show how inseparable human
bodies are from their material surrounding. [When the oil extraction and
consequent environmental damage are approached through the oil's
interconnectedness with spirits and how it spills over the region with
the geologists, environmental problems and the alcoholism among the
Khanty people cannot be seen as separate phenomena. Instead, they appear
as a continuation of the same "flow of death". Whereas the geologists
following the flowing oil "dig up the forests and the endless swamps"
(Aipin, 2014, p. 42), the spirits flowing with the geologists "takes"
one Khanty person after another. The rampant alcoholism in the region is
not only a social con- sequence of the natural resource extraction but
also a continuum of the settler-colonial slow violence in different
human and non-human bodies.]{.underline}

After all, in the novel the alcohol-related deaths of the Khanty people
seem almost less tragic than the break of the communicative and cultural
memories, which not only destroys individuals but also the Indigenous
people as a nation. The Russian literary scholar Ol'ga Lagunova (2007,
p. 123) pointed out the importance of memory for the survival of the
people by comparing Dem'ian's recount of the bear feast to an event
taking place in the future, after Dem'ian's journey. In this event,
Dem'ian's son, Mikul', contacts his old relative Galaktion Kurpelak in
order to hear old songs and stories, but the old man, who has lost all
his relatives to alco- hol, states: "My mind is empty, my words have run
off. What stories there were ... In this century of sufferings" (Aipin,
2014, p. 260). In the contrast between these scenes, Lagunova (2007, p.
123) sees the end of an era in the history of the Khanty people, a
change from the time when stories, myths and rituals are carried in peo-
ple's mind to one when they have disappeared from memory:

The space of the feast, in which everyone knew when and what they were
supposed to do and say, and the space of the seemingly boundless fairy
tale that joins together everything alive, entails all times and unites
generations, have fallen apart: the elderly people have left and the
young ones do not remember. \[...\] And so comes the end, the end for
all: for songs, fairy tales, feasts, family, home, Land \[sic\], life.
(Lagunova, 2007, p. 123)10

As Lagunova points out, when Galaktion Kurpelak lets go of the tales and
stories he used to tell, the cultural memory of the Khanty people is not
transmitted from one generation to another. Whereas Mikul's father has
participated in the bear feast him- self and is therefore able to recall
its course and related songs, for Mikul' the oral tradition of the
Khanty remains a vague recollection from childhood. The following
generation will have no personal experience of the national feasts or
folklore. The break in the communicative chain of memory between
different Khanty generations stifles the live and natural flow of the
cultural memory and solidifies it into Nora's lieux de mémoire, forming
lifeless symbols that merely represent the Indigenous community rather
than reconnect to it. This is already the case with one distant rela-
tive of Mikul' who "collects exhibits of Khanty's applied arts for an
exhibition of the Achievements of National Economy" in Moscow (Aipin,
2014, p. 262). [Gradually, the vivid Indigenous culture turns into a
curiosity and a symbolic demonstration of the multi-ethnicity of the
Soviet Union until it becomes a remnant of an extinct
community.]{.underline} As a result of alcohol abuse, the break of the
communicative and cultural memories cannot be separated from oil
drilling and its environmental consequences, and hence, the thoroughness
of the following devastation of the Khanty people is comparable to the
destruction of the taiga caused by the natural resource extraction.

Predatory Cultivation

As mentioned, the Mauken-Blåtind military training area in Troms Norway
overlaps a winter pasture for reindeer. A new road connecting the Mauken
and Blåtind areas, and a subsequent expansion of the Blåtind area, was
completed in 2011 after intense protests and legal struggles between the
Norwegian military and the reindeer herders. In 2014, a plan for "shared
use" of the area was implemented.

A 2015 report analyzing whether the actual effects of these changes were
larger or smaller than projected in original impact assessments
concluded that the effects have been much larger than anticipated for
the reindeer herders (Riseth 2015). [**Most problematic is the increased
activity of the army:** it simply uses the areas more intensively now
that they are connected.]{.underline} [This results in
disturbances]{.underline} for the reindeer, who have to survive the
winter with increasing noise [from vehicles, helicopters, and gunshots.
The new road]{.underline}---the corridor [between the two areas---is
kept snowcleared by the military]{.underline} all winter. [The
snow-drifts that this clearing creates]{.underline} on both sides of the
road [make it impossible for the reindeer and their herders on snow
scooters to pass, making it hard for the reindeer to maintain
flexibility in their pastures and difficult for the herders to bring
food to their reindeer]{.underline} when this is needed (the report
states that feeding is increasingly needed due to the general
fragmentation of pasture lands). The report also describes how
[reindeer]{.underline} sometimes [scatter into rugged and unknown
territory to escape military noise and disturbance, and fall prey to
predators as a result]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} how especially
[foreign military personnel have little understanding of how destructive
it is to drive small military vehicles on top of ridges rich in
lichen.]{.underline} Nonetheless, the shared-use plan for the
Maukenblåtind military training area condemns reindeer herders and the
military to coexistence, with no defined right of way.

Ideally, one is assuming that the two parties to a certain degree have
to mutually adapt, and one can say that for both parties, a very
challenging coexistence has been forced upon them. The challenge lies
not merely in the differences in the size and strength of the parties,
but that the activities are of such entirely different xcharacter. This
is exemplified well through how the parties have to relate to time and
space. [The military has its trainings that have to be carried out with
a certain amount of personnel during a year. This requires extensive and
detailed planning, and also results in limited flexibility in execution.
Reindeer herding has a yearly cycle that has to be flexible in time and
space based on reactions of the reindeer and movements according to
weather, and wind and local pasture conditions. The larger the intensity
of the use of the area is, the larger the challenge will become for both
parties.]{.underline} (Riseth 2015, 19; translated from Norwegian by
author)

One winter exercise in the area, which in a stark display of ignorance
was called ["Operation Joint Reindeer," took place in March
2018.]{.underline} [Over five thousand soldiers from Norway, Britain,
the United States and the Netherlands joined operations under
challenging winter conditions]{.underline} (Forsvaret 2018a). [The
exercise was a precursor to the]{.underline} high-visibility [NATO
exercise Trident Juncture]{.underline}, which took place further south
in Norway in the late fall of 2018, [attracting thirty-five thousand
participants, 250 aircraft, sixty-five ships, and ten thousand vehicles,
with the primary goal of deterring Russia]{.underline} while practicing
and showcasing a NATO Article 5 scenario (known as one for all, all for
one), and [making sure that NATO allies are able to operate in Northern
landscapes]{.underline} (Forsvaret 2017). As Colonel Thomassen, leader
of an allied training center in Norway says:

It is important that allied soldiers are well educated in basic
individual skills under winter conditions. They need this to be able to
operate during the winter in Norway. Without this basic training,
someone will be more focused on surviving than fighting . . . If you
lose your glove in the cold, this will have immediate consequences
because you risk frostbite in your hands, which will put you out of the
game. Once soldiers master this, their fighting ability is maintained.
(Forsvaret 2018b; translated from Norwegian by author)

As part of NATO cooperation, Dutch Marines have trained in Norway since
1972. They come to prepare for the challenges of combined cold with wet
weather, navigation and movement in full winter gear, and keeping their
weapons operative in Arctic climates. After completing winter training
in Norway and Scotland, a Dutch Marine can add a badge to his or her
uniform depicting a reindeer as a symbol of being an experienced soldier
able to operate in an extreme climate (Forsvaret 2018b).

[The choice of the reindeer as the trope for soldiers mastering Arctic
environments]{.underline}, with its suggestion that the soldier is like
a reindeer, [overlooks the differences between how a well-trained
soldier versus a reindeer operates in Arctic space.]{.underline} [When
the point is to fight in the landscape, and only secondarily to be in
it, a]{.underline} well-trained [soldier]{.underline} with a reindeer
badge [does not hold a smooth space]{.underline}. The nomadic trajectory
distributes people and animals in an open, indefinite space, while the
sedentary road functions to parcel out a closed space for people
(Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 380). [Soldiers are trained in how to
continuously uphold a personal space of striation that often leaves
behind it a wake of ecological destruction.]{.underline} An example of
this destruction is the reindeer that in 2016 was found shot in one of
the army's shooting areas (Ingvaldsen 2016). Conduct that results in
killing a reindeer should not earn you a reindeer badge.

As Deleuze and Gauttari note, [the state making a military is always a
compromise; because the military is a destructive line of flight, it is
in itself a deterritorialization that runs against what the state stands
for]{.underline} (Deleuze 2006, 106). Accordingly, [a military is an
excessively disciplined and striated destructive force. It does not
exist in accordance with the ecology it operates in but barges in at its
convenience, bending the ecology to its needs of
destruction.]{.underline} In this way, [the territorializations of the
military become a deterritorializing force that destructs the supple,
transspecies, and flexible territorializations of reindeer]{.underline}
and their herders that are carried out much more in resonance with the
surrounding ecology.

In the Mauken-Blåtind military training area, [the state is behind its
own striated forces of destruction, all in the name of
security]{.underline}. [The military keeps Norway and NATO safe, and it
would]{.underline} also [say that it is a necessary evil]{.underline} to
local reindeer [because it keeps the]{.underline} reindeer [herders safe
from military invasion]{.underline}. [The problem is that
these]{.underline} particular reindeer and their [herders have been
deemed to survive in a perpetual military invasion]{.underline},
[and]{.underline}, in this way, [their lives are continuously sacrificed
in the name]{.underline} [of]{.underline} Norway's
[sovereignty]{.underline}

As is the case with a military, the state sometimes has an interest in
cultivating certain deterritorializing, destructive elements. The
conservation of predators is another such example. Through institutions
such as the EU and the Bern Convention, predators, most controversially
the wolf, are protected in Norway, Sweden, and Finland (Russia, on the
other hand, provides bounties for shooting wolves). Reindeer are the
most important food source for several of these large carnivores, which
means that, currently, reindeer herding is essential for keeping
predator populations afloat. Technically, the state compensates herders
for lost animals and pays for its predators that way, but finding dead
reindeer is a tricky business, so compensation and prey do not match up
(Paliskunnat, n.d.; see also Beach 2004; Tyler et al. 2007).

In a classical biopolitical sense, predator populations of wolf, lynx,
bear, and wolverine are controlled via close monitoring and culling as
necessary in order to maintain nationally mandated population goals.
Predators can also be deemed "trouble animals"---for example, if they
enter human yards and kill dogs---and can then be hunted down and killed
after permission has been granted by the state (Castle 2008; Barkham
2017). The Scandinavian wolf population is inbred, and it is therefore
encouraged that new wolves be allowed to enter Finland from Russia and
make it across to Sweden and Norway.

Wolves can kill reindeer by the hundreds, and semidomesticated herds,
especially those that come to feed in set places every day, are easy
prey (Castle 2008; Barkham 2017; see also Heikkinen et al. 2011). In
October 2018, a wolf in Finnmark killed twelve reindeer, some of which
had to be put down due to severe injuries. As a distressed reindeer
herder said: "It stays in the reindeer herd and kills, it is not eating
to get full" (Varsi, Paulsen, and Larsson 2018; translated from
Norwegian by author). A wolf that finds a reindeer herd coming to a
certain place every day to be fed will indeed kill many more reindeer
than it can eat immediately. In zoology, this behavior is called
"surplus killing" and has been observed in many different predator
species (Kruuk 1972). It is speculated that such killing frenzies "allow
utilization of a kill at a later time, or allow other members of the
same social unit or offspring to use the food" (Kruuk 1972), or that
they occur when the behavior of the prey is altered---for example, in a
herd of semidomesticated reindeer that come to feed in the same place
every day (Siler 2016). Removing carcasses striates the
deterritorialization caused by the predatory instincts of the wolf and
motivates even more killing.

The question of predators is also a question of spatial encroachment.
Pitting the issue as the conservation of biodiversity via apex predators
against the continuance of reindeer herding (as some herders do, see for
example Vidal 2016 and Paliskunnat, n.d.) again sidesteps the main
issue, which is a lack of smooth space due to state striation. Wolves
have always been a threat to reindeer (see Sara 2009). In its
biopolitical management, the state fails to take the nomadism of
predators into account. The predation is cultivated to take place in
pockets of smooth space that are not large enough to host it, and what
is made to give in this equation are the reindeer. The constriction of
smooth space makes the predators more intense, and in this situation,
the conservation of predators becomes another cumulative effect that
further destroys possibilities for reindeer herding.

[The state's interest in cultivating predation]{.underline}, be it [via
NATO soldiers]{.underline} or wolves, [enacts a strange hybrid between
striation and deterritorialization]{.underline}. [The state wants access
to just enough smooth space to cultivate predation that fits within its
biopolitical regime:]{.underline} only so many predators can live and
only if they behave a certain way ("trouble animals" are killed) and
[only so many soldiers and only if they behave a certain
way]{.underline} (thirty-five thousand and they are well trained and
only kill "to make life live" \[Dillon and Reid 2009\]). [Smooth spaces
are kept to a minimum for the state's cultivation of just the right
amount of predatory, deterritorializing lines of flight:]{.underline}
just enough to keep the wolf gene-pool renewing itself and [just enough
to deter Russia but not so much smooth space that nomadic forms of life
could become a threat to the state itself.]{.underline} [In this way,
infrastructure such as roads, railroads, and borders help the state
remain in control, including over the predatory cultivations it has
deemed necessary.]{.underline}

#### The affirmative's understanding of the Arctic as volumetric turns it into a battlespace where mapping and surveillance technologies promote conquest via militarization.

impact to any of the "link" arguments in my opinion. It just feels like
a retelling of history without that critical spin we're looking for. It

Making the Ice and Snow Accessible and Legible

[The]{.underline} onset of the [Cold War is central to any analysis of
the subterranean]{.underline} --- military planners and political
leaders were desperate to know more about what lay beneath the ice and
snow. [Military paranoia became caught up with scientific curiosity and
further probing]{.underline} and poking [of the world underneath the
ice]{.underline} and within frigid polar seas resulted (Doel 2003;
Turchetti and Roberts 2014). [The Arctic]{.underline} and Antarctic
[attracted a new generation of men]{.underline} (there was a distinct
gender regime underwriting this investigatory and explorative labour),
[mapping and delving into the depths of the oceans, the tundra and ice
sheet to exploit, survey, secure, inhabit and exclude others from
these]{.underline} cold [environments]{.underline} (Bloom 1993; Collis
2009). Money came from military organizations and the Office of Naval
Research was an important funder of US polar science. This
naval-scientific marriage of convenience was also picked up in Cold War
popular geopolitical culture as submarine movies such as The Bedford
Incident (1965) and Ice Station Zebra (1968) thrilled audiences with
what might lie beneath the ice and snow. [The volumetric]{.underline},
as Bridge (2013) notes, [is a primary metric of anticipation and
potential, involving assessments about what]{.underline} a space such as
[the Arctic might contain and what it might become if transformed into
resource and military environments]{.underline}. Thus, it is
understandable how [the figure of the 'undetected\' nuclear submarine
sailing under the Arctic sea ice pack became]{.underline} such [a
productive referential object in Cold War geopolitical
imaginaries]{.underline}.

As historians and geographers of the physical and environmental sciences
have reported, disciplines such as [geology, geophysics, oceanography
and sedimentology were vital accomplices to this volumetric
strategizing]{.underline} (Doel 2003; Hamblin 2005). [The development
of]{.underline} Cold War era [governmental power in regions such as the
North American Arctic]{.underline} and the Russian North [is a story of
scientists and military planners working separately and collectively to
transform the tundra and sea ice into 'vertical territory\']{.underline}
rather than wide-open horizontal space. [These interventions
were]{.underline} also [biopolitical]{.underline} rather than simply
geopolitical ([in terms of securing]{.underline} [control]{.underline}).
[Moving people]{.underline} there [was critical in securing the
Arctic]{.underline} and Antarctic [as volumetric territories --- places
to be filled]{.underline}. Sometimes [these interventions were
disastrous]{.underline}; the Canadian government [organized relocation
of Inughuit to various parts of the High Arctic in the
1950s]{.underline} was controversial because the [relocatees struggled
with considerable]{.underline} [privations and little government support
in the area]{.underline}s in question, [notwithstanding all the attempts
to improve understanding of 'northern environments\']{.underline}
(Tester and Kulchyski 1994). Sadly [no amount of probing]{.underline}
[above and below the ice would have compensated]{.underline} [for a
badly thought out]{.underline} and funded [relocation
scheme.]{.underline}

As a consequence of what we have described, [there is widespread
consensus amongst historians]{.underline} of science [that the Cold War
was a major stimulus of exploratory and scientific activity in the
Arctic]{.underline} and Antarctic, as it was in many other parts of the
world [in which the possibilities of confrontation between the US and
the Soviet Union were reinforced by posture and rhetoric]{.underline}
(see e.g. Dennis 2003; Parish 2010; Turchetti and Roberts 2014). To this
we can add that [the Polar Regions played a critical role in
revolutionizing military technologies and]{.underline} what Paul Virilio
(1989) calls [the 'logistics of perception\']{.underline}. [The
Arctic]{.underline} in the Cold War [was considered a place of
potential]{.underline} [hostility and possible invasion, a region of
long-range bombers, intercontinental missiles, early warning systems,
sophisticated radar and air bases.]{.underline} Some [areas, such as
northern Greenland or Russia\'s border with Finland, became places of
dislocation for people as they were moved from their homes to make way
for military infrastructure,]{.underline} which was often [accompanied
by scientific facilities]{.underline}. Drawing on Virilio\'s work on
battlespace, particularly as developed in War and Cinema (1989), we
suggest that [as the Arctic became strategically vital to]{.underline}
the [Soviets and]{.underline} to [Western governments]{.underline}, [it
became a potential battlespace that not only produced a 'field of
perception\' but one that transformed the 'logistics of military
perception\'.]{.underline} As Virilio argued, [the side that can see
further and extensively, can gather more information, which can react
quicker and whose reach is longer and deeper, has the potential to be
the most powerful]{.underline}. In this way, [the Arctic became vital to
the sharpening of a military vision to see deeper into the territory of
others, to gather information and intelligence, and to monitor and
develop the capabilities to penetrate ever more intensively into that
territory. Utilizing different technologies of observation and military
gazing, surveillance and other forms of knowledge gathering of Arctic
conditions, such as the meteorological sciences, glaciology and geology,
this 'multimedia field of vision\']{.underline} (Virilio 2002) also [had
a volumetric dimension to it as military projects started to look within
northern landscapes and beneath northern seascapes, as well as across
and above them]{.underline}. Nick McCamley\'s account of the Cold War\'s
'secret, invisible infrastructure, the networks of underground control
bunkers and radar stations stretching across continental North America
and Great Britain, whose existence has never been more than a rumour\'
(McCamley 2002: 3) reminds us of the efforts that went into building
sophisticated military bases beneath mountains and under the ice and
snow.

Notable [projects of]{.underline} such [Cold War subterfuge in the
Arctic]{.underline} [include]{.underline} Olavsvern, a Norwegian naval
base near Tromsa, designed for patrol- ling submarines to hide or to be
resupplied in, and which extended deep into a network of mountain
tunnels. Another was [Project lceworm]{.underline}, [where
the]{.underline} [latest polar science]{.underline} and technology [were
used by the United States to excavate, mould and carve the ice sheet
with the intent of concealing a system of intermediate range ballistic
missiles]{.underline} (lRBMs) [in]{.underline} northern
[Greenland]{.underline} (Weiss 2001; Nielsen et al. 2014). In 1959---60,
[Project lceworm set out to construct a nuclear-powered
city]{.underline} --- Camp Century ---- [under the]{.underline} inland
[ice]{.underline} some 250 km [east of Thule Air Base]{.underline}, as
the foundation for a larger installation in which 'Iceworm\' IRBMs would
be housed (it was never built, although Camp Century itself was and
accommodated around 225 personnel in the first few years of the 1960s).
Declassified American documents have revealed the extent of the project
--- although Camp Century was hardly kept secret at the time, the real
reason for its construction was (figure 3.1). [The US claimed it was
building a scientific facility and Camp Century was depicted in
propaganda materials, including]{.underline} a [film about the
mobilization of US Army Engineers to excavate]{.underline} and tunnel
down into [the ice]{.underline}, [as an example of the conquest of the
Arctic environment and of man\'s quest for knowledge]{.underline} (Wager
1962; Kinney 2013).

[This celebratory account of the subjugation of a wild polar ice cap and
the triumph of science and technology makes no mention of indigenous
human presence]{.underline} in north-west Greenland [and
the]{.underline} movement and [relocation of Inuit families to make way
for Thule Air Base]{.underline} in the first place. [Military personnel
and equipment]{.underline}, [including a nuclear reactor]{.underline} to
power the facility, [were transported]{.underline} from the base and up
[to]{.underline} and across [the inland ice]{.underline} on trailers
hauled by snow tractors. Access to the inland ice was from a ramp at
Camp Tuto (Thule Take Off), a facility that had been built in 1954 to
examine whether the inland ice could be used as building material.
Nielsen et al. (2014: 445) situate the construction of Camp Century
within the context of US military appropriation of northern Greenland, a
process beginning with the construction of Thule Air Base in 1951 (and
possibly earlier with military geological interest). [Polar military
engineering was used to transform 'the snowy wasteland into a veritable
city equipped with every convenience from library to warm showers\'
which the US Army saw as a 'stepping-stone to increased military
presence on]{.underline} \[[and]{.underline}, quite literally,
[in]{.underline}\] [the icecap\'.]{.underline} Eventually, [the mobility
of the inland ice crushed the tunnels, laboratories and living quarters
--- the achievements of American military engineering were not quite
matched by knowledge of glaciological movement]{.underline} --- but Cold
War politics and difficulties in negotiating the placement of nuclear
installations on Danish territory also played their part in the eventual
abandonment of Camp Century (Nielsen et al. 2014). [It is also salutary
at this point to think that an investment of millions of dollars could
also fail to deliver upon another kind of settlement project in the High
Arctic]{.underline}.

[Progress in modern upper atmosphere physics and chemistry and weather
forecasting]{.underline} (where falling snow could obscure the skies and
interfere with communication) [owes much to military---supported
scientific efforts during the Cold War]{.underline} (Harper 2008). For
example, Danish research carried out in Greenland on the ionosphere
became of considerable importance for US long-distance radio
communications. A[n American military---operated network of weather
stations throughout the country became critical to Denmark\'s
meteorological ambitions to be able to imagine Greenland as part of
their 'national weather map\'.]{.underline} While Christopher Ries
discusses how '[US Cold War visions of the nature of global warfare
brought forth a pressing need for new kinds of knowledge
about]{.underline} terrains and soils in [northern
Greenland\']{.underline}, we can also, along with Michael Billig, note
how [such things feed into banal and not so banal
nationalisms]{.underline} (Billig 1995; Ries 2012:338)

[US efforts to project]{.underline} and consolidate its [power during
and immediately following World War 1 were 'accompanied by an enormous
expansion of military funded research, which tightened the links between
science]{.underline}, technology [and foreign policy]{.underline}, and
affected deeply the institutions, disciplines and practices of a broad
range of sciences [inside --- and outside --- the USA\']{.underline}
(Ries 2012: 336). [The fear of a Soviet attack]{.underline}, even
invasion, [ensured that this research continued to be generously
funded]{.underline} and supported thereafter.

But an earlier invasion arguably initiated this determination to
discover more about what lay beneath the ice and snow. The Japanese
invasion of Alaska in 1942 coupled with German military activity in the
European Arctic brought home the importance of having accurate weather
information as well as an appreciation of the distribution and thickness
of Arctic sea ice. As we note further in chapter 4, as the conflict
developed, US forces established a presence on Greenland and lceland,
but Alaska also became key to the US military defence system. Air, army
and navy bases were built in Alaska and the Alaska Highway through
Canada was constructed in 1942. [To supply the military build-up and
infrastructure, the US required ready access to oil and the Canadian
Oil]{.underline} (Canol) [Project of 1943]{.underline}---4 [involved a
hastily constructed pipeline from]{.underline} [the Norman
Wells]{.underline} oil fields in the Northwest Territories [to a newly
constructed refinery in Whitehorse in the Yukon]{.underline}. From
there, oil was transported by a network of pipelines to points along the
Alaska Highway, including to a fueling station in Skagway in south-east
Alaska. [Sections of pipeline were laid on the surface of the ground and
crude oil frequently leaked and seeped down into the permafrost and the
matter beneath.]{.underline} Although seen as a major event in the
history of Canadian cold region engineering, [it was nonetheless
designed, constructed and operated with little understanding of the need
for specific northern design and construction methods.]{.underline} It
was one of the largest projects ever undertaken in northern Canada and
[its environmental legacy remains]{.underline} very much in evidence,
and [a testimony to what happens when you]{.underline} either [do not
understand the subterranean worlds beneath frozen soil or fail to
appreciate what happens when alien substances drain and seep into
it]{.underline} (Nuttall 2010).

In the Antarctic, German forces were active in destroying the Norwegian
whaling fleet and there were fears that Japanese---German forces might
invade and occupy the Falkland Islands and disrupt maritime traffic
around Cape Horn. In the UK, scientists and scholars attached to the
Scott Polar Research Institute at the University of Cambridge were asked
to generate polar intelligence, and in the case of the Arctic required
to provide information and advice on how to navigate under and above
Arctic waters and negotiate the capricious--- ness of snow and ice. In
the Antarctic, the British, fearing mounting Argentine and Chilean
interest in what it considered its national polar territories, were
enrolling scientists in plans to launch a secret operation designed to
restore British sovereignty --- to facilitate it, orders were made to
collect and condense existing bodies of knowledge regarding polar
environments, above and below the surface.

World War II brought to the fore how patchy knowledge was of both the
terrestrial and marine environments of the Arctic and Antarctic. While
systematic observations and measurements of ice, water and weather (and
of indigenous peoples and the classification of material culture) were
made during the first International Polar Year (IPY) in 1883---4, and
although many later expeditions towards the end of the nineteenth
century and into the twentieth, had increased scientific understanding
of the Polar Regions --- including long-term programmes such as the
extensive geological mapping of East Greenland begun by the Geological
Survey of Greenland in 1926 - they remained frontiers of scientific
investigation. For example, Fridtjof Nansen and his crew had made
significant observations of the drift, motion and trajectories of sea
ice in the Arctic Ocean during the Pram expedition in 1893---6, but
knowledge of transpolar ice drift remained poor until the 1950s when
Soviet and American drifting stations were deployed, accompanied later
in the century by new technologies of automated weather stations and
airborne and satellite observations. The first drift station on floating
ice in the Arctic Ocean was set up by the Soviet Union in 1937, to be
followed by extensive Soviet and US programmes from the 1950s onwards.
But while little was known of the surface, and while drift stations
improved under- standing of sea ice, advanced meteorological knowledge
and allowed for oceanographic research, even less was known about the
depths of the oceans when the Soviets had set up North Pole-1, the first
drift station in 1937. In the late 1930s and early 1940s, little was
known, for instance, of the submerged ocean floor (Doel et al. 2006).
Mapping beyond coastlines was varied and episodic with scientific-
commercial investment in ocean mapping tied to sovereignty-resource
agendas associated with protecting fishing and whaling interests.
Terrestrial mapping was also tied to particular networks of patron- age
and state-sponsored interest. In the Antarctic, the UK sponsored the
British Graham Land Expedition (1934---7) to enhance British mapping in
the light of the growing interest of others in the Peninsula region and
to improve British understanding as to whether it was connected to the
polar Iandmass. Within two decades, however, this situation was greatly
changed as ships, airplanes and snow-vehicles were put to work in ever
greater numbers and intensity, probing above and beneath the ice cap and
polar seas.

Given its geographical location between the two superpowers of the
United States and the Soviet Union, the Arctic initially enjoyed (at
least in the late 1940s) the lion\'s share of new investment and
investigation. The US defence community was the primary driver of this
activity and the Office of Naval Research (QNR) was a notable funder of
data investigation, collection and analysis. Improved instrumentation,
including automated depth sounders and recorders, helped oceanographers
on vessels, including military submarines, to collect new information on
the ocean floors, especially the Arctic and strategically significant
territories such as the Bering Strait.

[Military patronage was one aspect]{.underline} of this Cold War era
enchantment of the Polar Regions. [Another factor was
commercial]{.underline}, with [mining and communication
corporations]{.underline} eager to understand the Arctic in a more
volumetric manner. [In the field of communications]{.underline}, [Bell
Laboratories and AT&T, when preparing to lay submarine
telephone]{.underline} cables from Canada to Scotland [alongside more
covert sonic buoys]{.underline}, [needed greater understanding of the
subterranean features of the North]{.underline} Atlantic and North
Pacific Oceans. As oceanographers increasingly appreciated, the seabed
was anything but flat and rather a complex array of trenches, plateaus,
seamounts, mountainous peaks and ridges. [Appreciating depth and
three-dimensional form was not just a commercial imperative; it was a
military one.]{.underline} [The US Navy\'s submarine commanders wanted
to understand]{.underline} those [topological complexities]{.underline}
not only for their own operations but fo[r detecting and deterring
anything that their Soviet counterparts might wish to
undertake.]{.underline} [Depth soundings]{.underline}, as early as 1952,
[were caught up within an explicit national security calculation with
Pentagon officials]{.underline} concluding that this emerging data set
could not be circulated more widely (Hamblin 2005).

Seafloor sounding depended on the physical character and on sea- water
temperature. Rocky slopes provoked a rather different acoustic profile
compared to the abyssal plain, and sea ice challenged acoustic operators
in submarines. Engineers and physical scientists working with the US
Navy were critical in informing advances in submarine design and
technology including seabed mapping. [Military planners swiftly
appreciated that the Arctic Ocean was a vital space of calculation. As
Soviet capabilities grew]{.underline}, as witnessed by their emergence
as a nuclear weapon state in 1949, [so the impulse to map, sound out and
ultimately classify resulting data as volumetric
intensified]{.underline}. As noted, [depth data was not the only item to
be affected; sea ice data, geo- magnetic data, atmospheric data - almost
anything that might offer further clues to those operating environments
of submarines, surface vessels and airplanes.]{.underline}

The calculation of depth soundings proved frustrating for a new
generation of oceanographers eager to investigate and map the ocean
floors, and for geophysicists interested in better understanding the
distribution and thickness of sea ice. [Maps produced of the North
Atlantic in the late 1950s]{.underline}, for instance, [were
physiographic rather than bathymetric because the US Navy did not wish
this strategically important territory to be understood]{.underline} (at
least [in public]{.underline}) [in a volumetric]{.underline}
[manner]{.underline}. [Thinking]{.underline}
[volumetrically]{.underline} [was]{.underline} something [caught
up,]{.underline} in the Cold War era, [in explicit national security
terms]{.underline}. Seafloor soundings data was more likely to be
classified top secret than ever before. As Doel et al. (2006: 608)
concluded, '[seafloor mapping became a far more nationalistic and
secretive undertaking the oceans \[including the Arctic\] became far
more relevant to national security because of two technological
developments: long-distance communications that utilized the acoustic
properties of the sea, and antisubmarine warfare\".]{.underline} [The
emergence of new maps]{.underline}, however, [was made possible
by]{.underline} other circumstances with the most notable being the
International Geophysical Year (lGY) 1957---8 and[, in the case of
seabed mapping, a commercial interest]{.underline} shaped by practical
concerns such as minimizing costly telephone cable snagging and
disintegration. From the perspective of AT&T, it made financial sense to
track seafloor routes that were likely to be most conducive to long-term
endurance.

#### The 1AC transforms Arctic ice into militarized data and universal climate narratives that erase Indigenous epistemologies to justify extraction. These scientific and strategic justifications enable colonial governance that sacrifices Indigenous life for geopolitical and environmental control.

This form of mapping the Arctic is from on high, using vegetation
indicators to carve the surface of the Arctic into segments, while other
more [modern mappings foreground a colonial desire to track, measure and
develop detailed volumetric knowledge about Arctic ice, land and sea
(Cameron 2015). Surface, aerial, space-based and volumetric mapping work
together as well, further attempting to render legible the horizontal
and vertical space of the Arctic and its ice (on subterranean aesthetics
and mapping, Hawkins, 2020). Measuring ice by volume adds deeper
colonial scientific dimensions to knowing, occupying and extracting from
the Arctic. Academic disciplines such as glaciology and permafrost
science were integral to this shift away from and building on surface
level measurements of ice]{.underline} (and associated methods such as
repeat photography) [to a focus on ice cores and the volume and depth of
the cryosphere]{.underline}. As Sorlin and Isberg (2021) remind us, [ice
coring not only transformed the social and material landscapes of
Greenland into a site of considerable scientific and strategic interest
but also transformed the epistemological and material significance of
ice (Alley, 2014; Cosgrove, 2008).]{.underline} As ice cores from
Greenland and Antarctica are transported and archived in overseas
locations, the temporal relationship to scientific research of ice and
the data it contains allows for a new form of reconstruction of past
environments and climates. Interpreting the chemical makeup of two mile
long ice cores extracted from ice sheets creates particular apertures of
mediated past climates to emerge. In one sense, then, [ice core science
created the conditions of possibility for universal narratives about the
history of the Earth to take shape and inform a climate-catastrophe
modernity.]{.underline} While local fieldwork was consequential in terms
of access to ice, often through the pres- ence of militarised access and
partnership, the portability of material ice enabled scientific networks
to extend and transform (O\'Reilly, 2016 and see the essays in Dodds &
Sörlin, 2002). We offer a reading of Arctic ice and its dynamic
relationship to narratives about Arctic geopolitics and futures. We take
up and engage with a growing body of literature falling within what
might be called ice humanities (for example, Bloom & Glasberg, 2011;
Bravo, 2019; Bravo, 2017; Bravo & Rees, 2006; Carey, 2007; Carey, 2010;
Dodds, 2019; Dodds & Sörlin, 2002 Ruiz et al., 2019; Smith, 2021;
Sorlin, 2015). The most recent and rising scholarly turn to ice has
parallels with ocean geogra- phies and critical ocean studies (Steinberg
& Peters 2015; Deloughrey, 2019; Jue, 2020) in the sense that both
strands of writings have drawn impetus from feminist, Indigenous and
post-colonial epistemologies, more-than-human ontologies, Anthropogenic
change such as acidification and elemental state-change, and finally a
turn towards more explicitly immersive and volumetric conceptions of
space that emphasise depth, height, forces and composition (see the
essays in Billé, 2020). The shared impetus for so much of this work has
been a collective misgiving about the over-emphasis given to either
legal-strategic-military gram- mars and zonation (for example, exclusive
economic zones, outer continental shelf delimitation, sea lanes of
communication, shipping lanes) and/or a relentless focus on fundamental
state-change such as melting, thawing and acidification, which contin-
ues to posit the Arctic as a natural region, being relentlessly depleted
of ice, snow and coldness. [In the case of the Arctic Ocean, sea ice
decline coupled with ocean warming has enabled new scientific framing
devices such as 'Atlantification' to gain traction as a way of
accounting for the open-ended, bio-geochemical and non-linear shifts
occurring in the substance and circulation of polar waters. In other
ways, the 'Arctic' becomes less Arctic because it cannot prevent the
loss of its ice and as a consequence is now being absorbed by a dominant
agency---Atlantification.]{.underline}

2 \| FROM 'NATURAL REGION' TO ICE CORE AND NOW 'ATLANTIFICATION' As
scholars of the Arctic have noted, a dominant discursive formation which
continues to frame the Arctic as a circumpolar region is one
characterised by reference to cold climate and frozen environment (for
example, Bloom,

1993; Grace, 2000). For the last 15 years, there has been a steady
production of articles, books, documentaries and films purporting to
track and trace transformations of the changing Arctic. [There has been
a relentless quest to identify a 'New Arctic', which is characterised by
excessive change to ice, ocean and air (for instance, Evengård et al.,
2015). Physical change is held responsible for stimulat- ing more
extraction, more mobility and more governance.]{.underline} What gets
lost in these sweeping overviews are two fundamental things. First, as
Ruiz et al. (2019) note, is '[Making sense of ice \[and we would add
land, ocean, air\] is not just a material, but involves ideas rooted
across past, present, and future socio-cultural contexts and
environmental experiences' (Ruiz et al., 2019, p. 8). The role of ice in
the human history of the Arctic varies in meaning and significance; so
making sense of loss will itself reveal different ontologies and
epistemologies]{.underline} (Gearheard et al., 2013). Second, the power
of story-telling remains profoundly asymmetric. [Recent calls for
research into the 'Arctic Anthropocene' reveal yet again a fondness for
thinking of the polar regions as 'laboratories' for non-polar audiences
to extract, observe and process from afar]{.underline} (for example,
Finger, 2016). Indigenous and northern communities have been telling
their own stories for millennia but still have to fight to be heard in a
region that so often has been framed by outsiders as a blank,
people-less void. [As volumetric ice became 'quantifiable data' it
encouraged conversation across disciplines such as climatology and
ocean- ography (Elzinga, 2017). Ice core research became less about the
localised extraction of ice from ice sheets and instead was rendered
data to be interpreted as global climate information and planetary
story-telling]{.underline}. Thus, climate modelling in the 1960s and
1970s made the Arctic 'global' and trans-national far before the term
was being used as a shorthand to describe the grow- ing interest from
Asian countries in Arctic geopolitics and governance (Sorlin & Lajus,
2014; Woon & Dodds, 2020). The cryosphere became in short 'portable', in
ways that earlier maps and forms of aesthetic media had previously
provided, such as through early photographs, paintings and drawings of
glaciers and icefields by early colonial explorers, travellers and
tourists to northern spaces. While ice had been considered portable,
even pocket size through a photograph or drawing, the technology of ice
coring and the infrastructure built to keep ice cores frozen created a
new terrain of the volumetric space of ice and the data it contains
(Antonello & Carey, 2017). [Ice data became part and parcel of
computerised climate modelling, intra-proxy envi- ronmental research
(for example, pollen, tree rings), and geo-chronological analyses of
human and non-human climate forcing]{.underline} (Cosgrove, 2008;
Achermann, 2020). In addition to the ice core, there has been no
shortage of endeavors to document the Arctic\'s frozen earth and sea
ice, ranging from nineteenth century Russian surveying of permafrost in
eastern Siberia to elaborate monitoring of drifting sea ice during the
International Geophysical Year (1957--8). While these exercises were
informed by scientific labouring, both permafrost and sea ice attracted
an array of other stakeholders, including engineers and industrialists
(Brunn, 2020). These scientific stakeholders were charged with planning
Russian and then Soviet agricultural and industrial development on the
one hand. On the other hand, Soviet and American military planners were
desperate to better understand the sea ice dynamics of the Arctic Ocean.
Submarine operations during the Cold War depended in large part on
having an up-to-date compendium of data on sea ice distribution and
thickness (Roberts, 2015). [One main intent of such mapping projects was
to create knowledge sets about ice as a dynamic, transitional
materiality that could either help or hinder movements of military and
capital, buoying or tanking colonial nation-state financial
interests]{.underline}. What links nineteenth century Russian
exploration of eastern Siberia and mid-twentieth century sea ice mapping
is a sense that the Arctic\'s cold qualities were sufficiently enduring
to necessitate academic, financial and infrastructural investigation and
investment (Herzberg et al., 2018). Such was the scale and extent of
frozen ground in Russia and sea ice in the Arctic Ocean that the Arctic
could be routinely framed as a place of frustration due to the
unruliness of ice in complicating Euro-Western exploration,
exploitation, industrial development and trade, as well as acting as a
buffer and at times barrier to the shrinking of space--time as movements
of capital are enacted (Chu, 2020). As research connects the global
cryosphere to debates about the Anthropocene, the affordances provided
by Arctic and Antarctic ice became increasingly recognised and
celebrated as integral to seasonal regularity, shaping the wider benefit
to the earth\'s (human) inhabitants that have come to depend upon it
since the Little Ice Age. As scholars of ice have noted, the last 150
years have been extraordinarily dependent on relationships and
entanglements with artificial and natural frozen water (Dodds, 2018;
Heidbrink, 2020). In the nineteenth century a global ice trade
flourished involving the extraction and transporta- tion of Arctic
glacial, river and lake ice that connected, for example, Alaska to
California and Norway to the United Kingdom. These global movements also
demonstrate [the role of ice in fulfilling the need of certain
racialised bodies to 'keep cool' in tropical geographies, which signals
and shapes oppressive interfaces between colonial actors and Indigenous
peoples, between the metropole and the colony (Hobart, 2022). In this
way, ice can act as both a deterrent to movements of empire and coloni-
alism in the Arctic and Antarctic while also demonstrating aesthetics of
colonial comfort of ice as a comestible transported from the
hinterlands.]{.underline} [If tropical heat is disorienting, and ice a
mediating factor in providing stability and comfort for temperate bodies
and agents of colonialism, here]{.underline}

[ice can be understood as a buffer]{.underline}, something that George
Orwell reflected upon in his ruminations about life in colonial Burma,
entitled Burmese Days (Orwell, 1934). In the twentieth century,
scientific interest in the Arctic, especially the island of Greenland,
grew markedly as climate research began to shift its attention away from
natural variability towards the perturbative role of human agency. The
Arctic proved itself to be strategically significant to
colonial-capitalist militaristic endeavours and initiatives during World
War II and the appropriately named Cold War. What connects the three
developments is [the role and value of ice: as commodity, as locat- able
and portable scientific object, as substance that challenged
conventional military tactics and domain awareness.]{.underline}
Simulta- neously, civil-military resourcing could also enable the
material presence of scientific stations dedicated to ice coring and ice
surveying in the Arctic and Antarctic[. Domain awareness was not
restricted to land, sea and air. Going 'underground' had its advantages;
scientists were eager to discover more about what lay underneath ice
sheets and glaciers while militaries experi- mented with plans to hide
infrastructure including missile installations under those same ice
bodies. The toxic remains of such military projects and plans are easily
found across Arctic spaces.]{.underline} As the ice harvester, the
scientist and the soldier/naval officer quickly discovered what
Indigenous people have already long known and experienced, ice is highly
dynamic, shape-shifting and capable of frustrating, blocking and
resisting human designs. As Michael Bravo has alerted us, there is a
cryo-politics to all of this (Bravo, 2017). In this moment of late
modernity, however[, the Arctic now comes to matter differently on the
main stage and through the main stream. Now, scholars, scientists,
activists and journalists report that there is too little ice, too much
glacial retreat, and insufficient frozen terrain (Balog, 2012). Ice is
no longer performing as a reliable buffer---containing subsurface carbon
stores, reflecting heat, and preserving the frigidity of polar waters.
Nor is ice performing as a constant or consistent barrier.]{.underline}
Whereas earlier dominant refrains regarding the Arctic discussed it as
an obstacle, if anything useful to comment upon at all, now Arctic ice
as it drastically transforms shape and viscosity receives more press
than ever. If the Arctic was largely ignored and over- looked in
previous eras of the Western master narrative, in dominant discourse
now, the Arctic in part constitutes what it means to be a human being in
a moment of late-stage capitalism. As Morehouse and Cigliano (2020)
report, glacial funerals are now being held in Iceland as a way of
marking disappearance and persistent sea ice loss is credited as
ushering into existence a 'new Arctic' (on the 'new Arctic', see
Serreze, 2018). Morehouse and Cigliano (2020) suggest that the public
mourning of glacial disappearance operates as an opportunity to think of
ice as animate rather than inanimate, an idea similar to Cruickshank\'s
detailing of Athabascan, Tlingit, and Eyak philosophies pertaining to
glacial sentience, and the long held belief that glaciers are social
actors that change physical, social and spiritual landscapes. [This is a
loss that cannot be adequately captured by metrics such as ice melt and
surface area exposure but something that speaks to the connections
between ice and the life-worlds of others.]{.underline} In her account
of life on either side of the Bering Strait, Bathsheba Demuth reminds us
of how sea ice is lively, animate and life-affirming. As she notes: In
forming, thawing and shifting under the wind, ice steadies the
circulation of the world\'s oceans, making them hospitable for living
things ... The sea ice shapes being, human and otherwise, on this
planet. From its groaning surface, the world as we know it is made
(Demuth, 2019, pp. 21--36) Here Demuth\'s attunement to [the necessity
of ice is understood as relational, symbiotic and mutualistic in its
crucial func- tioning. It works, in sympathy, with the other accounts
that consider Indigenous life-worlds and the meaning of ice in shaping
the lives of the peoples of the Arctic]{.underline} (Gearheard et al.,
2013).

[One of the more interesting recent developments has been the renewed
attempt to construct the Arctic Ocean as a "Polar
Mediterranean]{.underline}," [a]{.underline} kind of [international
free-trade zone that involves political cooperation as well as
commercial transaction between the major Arctic states]{.underline}. 48
A further neologism comes to mind here:
"[mediterraneanism]{.underline}," [whose]{.underline} twentieth-century
[Fascistic]{.underline} [roots and nineteenth-century connections to
European cultural suprematism make the idea of the Arctic Ocean as a
"new Mediterranean" considerably less attractive]{.underline}. 49
Indeed, as Iain Chambers argues, [the Mediterranean]{.underline}, far
from representing the pinnacle of European civilisational success, [has
come to symbolise all that is most divisive and exclusionary about the
European project]{.underline} [and to provoke reflection]{.underline},
in turn, [on the "profound 'unfreedom' that characterizes the modern
world]{.underline}." 50 Little wonder, then, that [the geographer Philip
Steinberg]{.underline} in a recent piece [lays into "Polar
mediterraneanism" as a damaging form of Arctic
Orientalism]{.underline}----[the "othering" process by which the polar
regions]{.underline} (and the Arctic as a whole) [are separated into
"successful" zones]{.underline} and their "unsuccessful" equivalents [in
accordance with a neoliberal logic of progress]{.underline},
modernisation, [and development]{.underline} that is bound to benefit
some Arctic states more than others, and [that risks setting them
against each other as well as creating a new Cold War
scenario]{.underline} in which the west is set against the rest
(Steinberg 2016). As Steinberg contends, "[mediterraneanization is as
much an 'othering' process on Europe's northern border as it is on its
southern border]{.underline}," and [the hierarchical relations it
produces are symptomatic of the racialised outlooks that underpin the
proposed emergence of a "New North]{.underline}" (Steinberg 2016; see
also Stuhl 2013). These outlooks are not just projected onto the North;
they also exist within the North, and are contained within, if by no
means coterminous with, ideologies of Nordic exceptionalism (Jensen and
Loftsdóttir 2012). In the next section, I want to look briefly at Nordic
exceptionalism in an Arctic state that will prove to be exceptional in
other ways, and that also has strong links with the Polar Mediterranean:
Iceland. As Steinberg suggests, the [economic opportunism that is at the
heart of northern-style mediterraneanism]{.underline} is neatly captured
in the wishful diplomatic image of Iceland as an "Arctic Singapore."
Steinberg cites Iceland's ambassador to Norway, Gunnar Pálsson, to the
effect that: We may now find ourselves on the threshold of a new epoch,
where changes in the patterns of climate, settlements, energy
consumption, trade and transportation will begin to converge in a way
that could transform the world we live in. In effect, we could be moving
towards the activation of the Arctic in a manner that would radically
alter, if not reverse, our conceptions of the world's periphery and
center. We could, in effect, be moving towards a world with the pole in
the middle: the Polar Mediterranean. 51

### Link\-\--Shipping / NWP

#### The dispute over the NWP has been growing---the low impact shipping corridors initiative incorporates indigenous spatial understanding into state-run cartographic efforts, especially when navigating territorial disputes, promoting indigenous recognition and sovereignty.

\*\*Note: I think this is very strategic because the is advocates for
something attainable which is to view arctic territory from a new lens
of indigenous spatial understandings superimposed on western
understandings to promote their sovereingty.

[Spatial thinking commonly reflected within these instruments is deeply
rooted in cartesian conceptualizations of the world based on ontological
dichotomies such as land versus sea and nature versus culture that can
be traced back to the solidification of legal modernity.112 Such
dichotomies are reflected in international law's fundamental spatial
order and revealed in the way space is partitioned upon cartographic
representations on the basis of state sovereignty.113 Yet this is not
the only way to conceptualize space in the Arctic. **Many Indigenous
spatial orders across the Arctic diverge from the fundamental
dichotomies that underpin the foundations of international law's
spatial** order and are instead traditionally grounded in holistic114
conceptualizations of space and animist or relational ontologies115
Inuit customary legal orders have been shaped by the particularities of
Arctic landscape conditions (e.g., sea ice, remoteness, coldness) and
are rooted in a special spiritual connection with the surrounding
environment and wildlife.116 According to Inuit worldviews, **human
beings are traditionally seen as not separated from the natural world,
while the sea ice constitutes an extension of the land, and, thus,
international law's land--sea dichotomy contravenes the holistic spatial
vision of the Inuit legal orders.**117 As the former Chair of the Inuit
Circumpolar Council (ICC) put it in a UN Chronicle, "the Arctic Ocean
and the sea ice is our nuna," which translated into "land,"
acknowledging the Inuit's strong bonds to the marine ecosystems---much
like nation-states conceptualize the "land."118 For the Inuit of the
NWP, the sea ice is thus not seen as a "barrier" in the development of
navigation and commerce, but **functions as a bridge to the sea, a
symbol of their own mobility across space**, reflecting their customary
relationship to nature and their historical seminomadic lifestyle.119
Indeed, as observed by Beveridge, there is also a "functional" (and far
from being ontological) boundary of land--sea among Inuit, mainly when
the sea ice is not present, which, however, becomes blurred when the sea
ice appears.120]{.underline}

[Through this understanding, and with Inuit settlement in the Arctic
preceding the arrival of Europeans for many centuries, the Inuit
pioneered their own traditional mapping techniques to navigate within
space in accordance with their hunting practices and migration cycles.
Such cartographic praxes may take a variety of forms, ranging from sewn
driftwood to sealskin representations and to carved portable
maps.]{.underline}121 Ethnographers and cartographic researchers most
commonly refer to the Wetalltok map of the Belcher Islands (Sanikiluaq),
a map of the islands in Disko Bay on the Western coast of Greenland by
Silas Sandgreen, or the portable wooden carving maps from eastern
Greenland,122 created out of driftwood to navigate coastal waters
(Figure 9).123 These compact tactile devices represent islands or
coastlines in a continuous line, up one side of the wood and down the
other. [Inuit traditional maps were predominantly of navigational or
**storytelling use that enabled a variety of senses** (e.g. sight,
sound, touch) and reflect the way Inuit view the land/seascape, beyond
dominant conceptualizations of territory and sovereign
borders.]{.underline}

Although most Indigenous peoples developed their own methods of mapping
to depict people's stories and communities' relationships to places and
other beings, most traditional modes of spatial expressions upon the
area now known as the Northwest Passage were deeply affected by the
arrival of the Europeans.124 European views and ontological assumptions
of space were gradually imposed upon preexisting Indigenous cartography,
and maps of the newly "discovered" places depicting borders, resources,
and claims upon space soon became common in the colonial world. Early
European expeditions acknowledged the precision of Inuit maps in
delineating the complex Arctic ice-scape, and in many cases, European
explorers trusted Inuit hunters in producing planimetrically accurate
maps consistent with European standards and their voyage's cartographic
needs.125 As observed by McGurk and Caquard, since the first contact
with the European settlers, Inuit mapping has had to "move back and
forth between ancestral and processual mapping and impacted by the
colonizers requirements for precise, standardized, and rational
mapmaking practices."126 For instance, under the umbrella of Moravian
missionaries and Scottish whalers, and using European cartographic
tools, the Inuit contributed to a comprehensive mapping of the Inuit
presence in the region.127 The map Nunat Kalâtdlit Najugait from
Atuagagdliutit no. 1, 1861 (Figure 10), is probably the first such known
map that illustrates the entirety of the Inuit territories of North
America, demonstrating both the predominant presence of the Inuit
throughout the Northwest Passage and the close cartographic work among
the Inuit and European settlers.

The familiarization of the Inuit with European cartographic means has
been used today to ensure opportunities to advance Indigenous decolonial
mapping efforts. Remarkably, Western mapping methods are now often
infused with Indigenous knowledge and are used by Indigenous groups as
tools to counternarrate space and reflect Indigenous beliefs and
political claims in light of an ongoing decolonial endeavor. Since the
1970s, Inuit people have been highly involved in mapmaking activities in
Arctic Canada, as part of the Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project
(ILUOP) that constituted the legal basis for the Land Claim Agreements
of Inuvialuit (1984) and Nunavut (1993).128 [In 2005, after delineating
their last land claims, the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami **(ITK),129 which
serves as the domestic representative organization for the Inuit of
Canada, created a new map of Inuit use and occupancy of the Arctic
entitled Inuit Nunaat (Inuit homeland).130**]{.underline}

[More recently, ITK developed a new map for Canada's Arctic region named
Inuit Nunangat, which aimed to reflect the Inuit settlements and
distinct conception of space.131 The map Inuit Nunangat (Figure 11)
encompasses all terrestrial, marine, and ice-covered areas, and
demonstrates that the Inuit consider the land, water, and sea ice to be
interconnected and "integral to their culture and way of life."132 The
map challenged dominant conceptions of space and replaced Canada's
provincial and territorial boundaries with terraqueous/frozen borders
based on traditional use and occupancy by the Inuit, raising concerns
regarding Canada's sovereignty and political jurisdiction within
traditional areas, particularly over the Northwest Passage.133
**Thinking of the NWP as part of the Inuit Nunangat may allow for a
comprehensive holistic conceptualization of space that erases Western
dichotomies, bridges water, sea ice, and land in accordance with the
Inuit way of life, and replaces ontologies of power and control with
ontologies of "being" in and with nature. Such an approach could better
reflect also the general scope of UNCLOS as provided in the Convention's
Preamble, which states that "the problems of ocean space are closely
interrelated and need to be considered as a whole."**134 Yet, as further
observed by Fabbi, a reconceptualization of "territory" as a notion
inclusive of ice, water, and land will have far-reaching implications as
to UNCLOS's ability to settle the current dispute over the Passage, as
well as to Canada's general commitments toward international law
instruments.135]{.underline}

Holistic cartographic representations of the Arctic space by Indigenous
peoples have also been embedded in online mapping representations, with
the Inuit increasingly engaging in such projects aiming to reclaim
Indigenous rights and decolonize cartography.136 Although online mapping
is inherently a Western tool, it has today become a part of the Inuit's
"decolonial agenda" and important tool for redefining space.137 For
instance, the project "The Northwest Passage and the Construction of
Inuit Pan-Arctic Identities" has mapped the historical Inuit presence
along the Northwest Passage, using, instead of precise geographic
locations or separate routes on land and in the sea, terraqueous lines
that spread across land, sea, and sea ice.138 Inuit trails are not
static lines as they are depicted in mainstream maps, but mobile
entities that represent fluidity across space, tangle with each other,
and create a complex meshwork139 that cannot be simply reduced to
Western cartographic representations.140 In that regard, the Nunaliit
Atlas Framework driven by the Geomatics and Cartography Research Centre
(GCRC) at Carleton University has managed to provide access to Inuit
communities to build their own interactive maps and digitally document
local and traditional Inuit spatial knowledge in cybercartographic
atlases.141 What emerges from these maps is that statist representations
of territory are mobilized and renegotiated from the bottom up.
Furthermore, they resonate with the uncertain materiality of the Arctic
environment such that it is dynamic in both space and time and may
change form inconsistently, exposing sovereignty's inherent tendency for
permanence.142

[The Low-Impact Shipping Corridors Initiative---One Map to Rule Them
All?]{.underline}

[The inter-state dispute over the legal status of the NWP is premised on
different visions of ocean space: one of the full and exclusive
sovereignty by the state of Canada, and one more akin to a res communis
vision of an international strait where other states are entitled to
exercise freedom of navigation for the purpose of transit passage.143
Although these different visions are difficult to reconcile, in light of
international developments with respect to the rights of Indigenous
peoples, the cartographic representation of the NWP/Inuit Nunangat is
today subject to other visions of space and developments in human
rights. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous
Peoples (UNDRIP),144 although initially rejected by Canada, has, since
2021, been supported through the United Nations Declaration on the
Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act.145 The 2021 Act affirms the UNDRIP as
a universal human rights instrument with application in Canadian law,
and provides a framework for its implementation146 that aims to ensure
the consistency of Canadian law with the Declaration.147]{.underline}

[Against this context, the Low-Impact Shipping Corridors Initiative
constitutes a proposal to reconcile, although on Canadian terms, the
different opposing considerations, including the pluralistic visions of
space, transcending the ones wielded by the sovereign states. Navigation
in the Arctic is a highly risky endeavor, and in that sense, the classic
"freedom of navigation" may be of little use if not supported by a
system of aids, appropriate charts, and mechanisms to assist in normal
operation and in emergency. The initiative avoids the formal recognition
of a navigational right or freedom, and instead focuses on the modality
of the use of the sea space by different actors (Figure 12). It is
revealing that in 2016 the leaders of the United States and Canada, the
two champions of the opposing sides of the sovereignty dispute,
announced a new partnership to embrace the opportunities and confront
challenges in the changing Arctic.148 The partnership includes a
commitment to identify sustainable shipping lanes through the Arctic in
collaboration with Northern and Indigenous partners. As a followup,
Canada earmarked CA\$ 1.5 billion for its Oceans Protection Plan and
launched an Initiative to identify and develop Low-Impact Shipping
Corridors. The corridors "are intended to be dynamic shipping routes
throughout Canada's North where the necessary infrastructure, marine
navigational support, and emergency response services could be provided
to ensure safer marine navigation, while respecting the sensitive
northern environment and its ecological and cultural
significance."149]{.underline}

[As such, the ambition is to identify the areas where three types of
concerns are taken into account: respect for the sensitive environment,
cost-effective provision of necessary navigational support and
infrastructure, and respect for cultural sensitivity. It is particularly
the latter issue that prompted the innovative collaboration toward
developing a governance framework to address local and Indigenous
communities' needs. The initiative is led by Transport Canada and the
Canadian Coast Guard, who has been leading engagement with Inuit, First
Nations, and Metis organizations and governments, provincial and
territorial governments, and other key stakeholders to identify priority
areas for investment and potential governance models. In the course of
Arctic Corridors and Northern Voices (ACNV) research project, 14
Canadian Inuit communities across Inuit Nunangat were invited to share
their views and recommendations for the corridors.150 The community
recommendations identified preferred corridors in different localities,
areas to be avoided, specific measures relating to the seasonal use of
different areas, recommendations on vessel operation, and areas of
inadequate charting. The multitude of factors to be considered when
implementing this ambitious initiative will inevitably lead to
compromise and trade-offs. It is unlikely that all the recommendations
will be given equal weight. However, there are potential and efforts
toward developing a genuinely collaborative governance structure to not
only design but also manage the low-impact corridors.151 This initiative
provides a good opportunity to reconcile the different visions of space
and give real voice to the local communities to translate their visions
into specific recommendations---indeed **to provide "one map to rule
them all."152 Yet incorporating Inuit interests and spatial views into a
state-driven cartographic initiative** bears the risk of perpetuating
statism via a territorially grounded conception of the Passage that
appears detrimental to the pursuit of self-determination for the Inuit
people.153 As of the time of writing, it is yet difficult to tell how
well all this can be done in practice, but the process is
there.]{.underline}

Concluding Remarks

[It is undisputable that cartography materializes the way societies
conceptualize space and legalities pertinent to it. Since the age of
discovery, European nations have been using cartography as a technology
of planning that legitimated the establishment of state sovereignty
through "lines" upon land and sea and demarcated borders and
jurisdictions. Under this rationale, as Harley and Laxton have noted,
"the state became---and has remained---a principal patron of
cartographic activity in many countries," determining the dominant
narratives of spatial thinking.154 This cartographic activity though is
strongly affiliated to a prolonged history of colonization, competition
among sovereign powers, and neglect of different ways of
thought.]{.underline}

[**A bird's-eye view of the development of cartographic thinking in
relation to the Northwest Passage demonstrates that the history of
spatial inscription of the Passage is not a static one, but has
historically been driven by a territorial rationale imposed on the
Passage ever since the first colonial charters were used as avenues for
the successful imperial expansion and imposition of colonialism.** In
this context, maps of the region have reflected a dominant Eurocentric
worldview of "space" that is not very relevant to the way the very own
people of the region think about it. If "to map is to think," and thus
"to inscribe" worldviews upon space,155 then there is paramount value in
examining how non-Western conceptions of space may challenge dualistic
assumptions about the surrounding world that lie at the core of modern
spatial thinking. Antithetical to dominant maps decided upon to serve
their "makers" and to demonstrate their brute assertion of ascendancy
over a colonized "other," Inuit cartography is nowadays seeking not only
to question existing legal spatial thinking but also to reshape it from
the ground up, resisting the long colonial legacy of Arctic mapping.
This demonstrates that the NWP is not only an arena of dispute among
sovereign states, but a rather plural space that currently accommodates
different ontological visions, legal orders, and ways of being in
relation to space. **Inuit cartography thus becomes a tool of
countermapping, retelling existing narratives of space and questioning
the very understandings of maritime zones and borders, even conceptual
dichotomies among land and sea, upon which Arctic law and governance are
today premised.** Should the Arctic states decide to fully
operationalize Indigenous self-determination in accordance with
International human rights law and, thus, acknowledge the Inuit
terraqueous materialities, then the legitimacy of state sovereignty's
territorial application and cartographic representation over coastal
waters and frozen areas would be drastically challenged. Reconciling
Inuit and state spatial orders is not only about geographical accuracy
but also about upholding and respecting the rights and heritage of
Indigenous communities.]{.underline}

[Navigating the history of NWP/Inuit Nunangat throughout cartography for
the purposes of this article is thus not only about recognizing Inuit
cartography, but also about using it to obtain and promote the local
understanding of the localities, which, given the particular
relationship with nature, may also be considered good environmental
practice. **The Low-Impact Corridors Initiative holds great potential to
merge worldviews without homogenizing them. Low-impact corridors will
not solve the inter-state dispute, and will not displace either the
political map of Canada (national boundaries) or Inuit cartography.
Rather, the Initiative superimposes one on another in a way that
enriches how we conceive of space, and facilitates a synergetic reading
of a pluralistic multivision of the Arctic. Recognizing Inuit interests
on official state maps helps validate Inuit rights to these lands and
waters, enabling them to maintain their cultural heritage and
traditional practices.**]{.underline}

Unscrambling the arctic

[While Arctic scientific research and exploration has contributed to
knowledge]{.underline} about the polar regions and the planet more
broadly, [one must not divorce these interests from economic
ones]{.underline}. [Scientific research and economic and political
interests have long been interconnected]{.underline} (Cornelia and
Summerhayes 2012; Roberts 2011). [Practices of mapping and survey- ing,
for example, **were central to the early geopolitical formation of
Arctic spaces**]{.underline}. [Early]{.underline} whalers and maritime
[explorers drew the first maps of the region,]{.underline} while [one of
the tasks of nineteenth-century industrial exploration was
to]{.underline} examine coastal areas and [improve geological knowledge
in the search for valuable **mineral resources**.]{.underline} A
state-funded expedition that led to the establishment of mining
activities could in turn improve the influence of that country in the
archipelago. From a broader perspective, [even much of the **seemingly
"pure" science** of today is economically and politically
motivated]{.underline}, with [countries often sponsoring expensive polar
research in order to bulk up their presence in these regions and thereby
increase their influence]{.underline}. The [search for exploitable
mineral resources continues]{.underline} up to the present
day---primarily for oil and gas, though there is still ongoing surveying
in Svalbard for further coal deposits. [Deep drilling]{.underline},
especially for oil, began in the 1960s, and even though some of the
results were withheld due to competition between the companies, these
expensive drilling programmes, like later seismic shootings,
[contributed to knowledge of geological structures deep under the
surface]{.underline}. [Research both in and on the Arctic has "long been
constituted via constellations of emotional and embodied practices as
well as epistemic ones."]{.underline} 23 [Such research has been
constituted by "complicated relationships between activities which were
construed to be scientific whilst also allowing some sort of
demonstration of territorial sovereignty."]{.underline} 24 Furthermore,
as was the case with jostling for mineral resources during the previous
cen- tury, [research itself now represents a **geography of
international competition**]{.underline} on Svalbard. Linked to the
[increase in research activity is the growing conflict between
ecological research and protection of the environment, or between
geopolitical research and mining or tourism]{.underline}. 25

#### Science, mapping, and climate discourses are NOT neutral, they are all colonial tools that enforce settler control- they frame the Arctic as both a technical problem to be solved through governance and a site of inevitable Indigenous disappearance.

3 \| THE STORIFICATION OF ICE IN ARCTIC GEOPOLITICS

In our reading of the Arctic, we argue that [contemporary Arctic
geopolitical discourse too often pivots around simple causalities such
as less sea ice equates to growth in maritime traffic and possible
geopolitical tension (]{.underline}for a critical review, Depledge,
2019). This in turn invites a phalanx of technical-scientific experts to
qualify claims about the preponderance of open water or dampen down
expectations that the Arctic will inevitably be a global maritime
highway. [These are particular and familiar colonial moves towards
possessing the Arctic. The relationship between colonialism and northern
territories, including water, is not straightforward given that many of
those lands incorporated into colonial-nation states such as Canada, the
United States and Russia that utilised varying projects, tactics and
techniques to dispossess Indigenous peoples of their lands, lifeways and
liveli- hoods (Kollin, 2001; Ruiz et al., 2019)]{.underline}. [What is
often understood as a settler impulse to eliminate to replace by way of
genocidal warfare is not neatly projected onto landscapes of the Arctic,
especially in thinking of the particularly situated (ongoing) colo- nial
histories in Alaska and Canada.]{.underline} The enactment of allotment,
and terra-forming forest and plain into agriculture including ranching,
though attempted, was not successfully replicated further north. The
early needs for resource extraction as animating the core principle of
settler-racial-capitalism was not easily met by virtue of the presence
of ice and glacier fields of Arctic landscapes. Colonial movements and
travels in search of the Northwest/east Passage of the white nationalist
race to the illusive North Pole were temporary and fleeting---apart from
later public policy directed towards the encouragement and support of
homesteaders and gold miners to populate northern spaces, colonial
actors in the North often did not come to stay. Elemental substances
such as frozen earth, sea ice and glaciers were surveyed, mapped and
manipulated, with colonial agents seeking to thaw out permafrost and
restructure parts of the Arctic landscape in terms of agriculture. The
needs of colonial desires to cultivate particular foods in particular
ways that aligned with property making through labour and land were
thwarted by ice and its liminal shapes of constituting land not water
(Smith, 2021).

[The coupling of scientific expertise and racist legal policies of
dispossession ultimately created similar outcomes of long- standing
oppressive colonial regimes that continue to constitute the present. For
one example, plans such as the so-called Inuit High Arctic relocations
in the early 1950s were hatched in Canada to resettle Indigenous
communities in what is for now understood as northern Quebec, as part of
a strategic calculation designed to populate a 'sparse and spartan'
northern territory. The relocation strategy proved to be a costly and
devastating failure, as it was built upon the notions that all cold
climates are ostensibly the same and therefore Indigenous peoples should
be able to live successfully within them---racist thinking that either
misunderstands or overlooks centuries of relationships built across
Indigenous peoples and more-than-human kin.]{.underline} At the base of
this thinking is a temperate-normative assumption that an adapted cold
weather community in one part of northern Canada could simply be
trans-located for the purpose of filling a less populated area. [The
Inuit High Arctic relocations serve as a poignant reminder of how the
initiatives of relocation are currently iterative---at one moment in the
1950s, Indigenous peoples of the Arctic are made to undergo enforced
relocation by decision of a colonial-nation-state meant to 'uplift' or
to meet the end of an act of colonial sovereignty,]{.underline} but in
the contemporary moment in which Native peoples find their homes
underwater due to carbon consequences, those same nation-states will not
assist in relocation efforts (Audlaluk, 2020).

[The storification of the extent and thickness of sea ice is integral to
Arctic geopolitics---often framed as loss followed by revelation and
enhanced activity and engagement by Arctic and non-Arctic states and
stakeholders (Dodds,]{.underline} 2010[, Dittmer et al.,]{.underline}
2011[).]{.underline} There have been three aspects to all of this that
we believe deserve more explicit and considered attention.
Fundamentally, further attention needs to be given to how these
analogies of sea ice work to produce different framings and
relationships within and beyond the Arctic. First, we might ask what is
the role of sea ice as 'buffer' rather than 'barrier' and/or 'hazard',
and how does such an analogy complicate iterative accounts of sea ice\'s
annual rates of extent or shrinkage (with the inference being that less
sea ice extent and thickness means more likelihood of activity and
possible conflict over the use of polar waters). If sea ice is
considered to be a barrier then that implies that there is either an
obstacle to movement (which someone or thing wishes to cross) and/or
that there is a distinction to be made between one area or another. For
example, the term barrier reef is used to signify an ecological space
betwixt shallow water and shoreline. Whereas sea ice as a material
barrier is often used to help identify the Arctic Ocean as distinct from
the warmer Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. [Sea ice as buffer foregrounds
something quite different; in this rendering, ice is said to perform a
series of ecological services including regulating ocean temperature,
reflecting heat away from ocean and absorbing the energy released by
wave action; whereas sea ice as hazard is framed as such because
commercial and military shipping wishes to traverse ice-covered waters.
Tropes such as 'polar Mediterranean' have long been used to re-configure
the Arctic Ocean and maritime passages as capable, at some point, of
being usable(Steinberg,]{.underline} 2014[).]{.underline}

This shift in the framing of sea ice has developed in two distinct
areas. In stories about climate change and coastal communities in
Alaska, it has become increasingly common to recognise the 'buffering'
effect sea ice plays in mitigating the erosive damage done by winter
storms to coastlines. The intersection between shoreland, water and ice
is thus recognised as interstitial space; with a capacity to absorb and
deflect wave energy away from the rock, soil and sand of the coastline.
A reduction in multi-year sea ice with thinner annual or young sea ice
in turn reveals buffering limits; thicker sea ice being far more likely
to be able to absorb the energy associated with wave action. We see this
enacted in real time with the recent typhoon Merbok that moved through
the Bering Strait and left many coastal communities with damaged homes
and destroyed subsistence infrastructure. Another way sea ice scientists
have framed sea ice is to posit it as a 'lid' to acidification, which is
caused by the ocean becoming saturated with carbon dioxide emissions.
Younger sea ice in particular being less able to act as a 'lid' to both
warming and amplification trends. With less sea ice, open water is
better able to absorb heat and disrupt in turn the relationship between
water, ice and air. Acidifying waters have direct implications for
future biodiversity, as some creatures including shell-building
organisms cannot tolerate acidification beyond a certain degree of
concentration. As Cheryl Katz (2019) noted in her investigation of the
acidification:

But as marine carbon levels climb, more and more carbonate ions are
being used up, lowering the ocean\'s ability to buffer, and causing
acidity---measured as a drop in pH---to rise. Those same carbonate ions
are needed by creatures like starfish and clams, whose shells or
skeletons are made of the calcium carbonate minerals aragonite or
calcite ... Melting away the ocean\'s icy lid exposes yet more water to
take up yet more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.

The acidification of Arctic waters has direct implications for local and
Indigenous fishing and shellfish harvesting in coastal Alaska, with the
fastest rate of acidification occurring in the Beaufort Sea and Bering
Sea. Acidification affects growing seasons for molluscs and crustaceans,
reproduction rates and species distribution (for example, clams and
crabs). What the analogy of the 'buffer' does is to highlight energy
transfer rather than simply assume 'disappearance' of sea ice per se.
The relationship between land, sea and air in the Arctic reveals well
the 'vertical reciprocity' between the three, as more open water means
more heat absorption, rising air and water temperatures, greater
acidification and diminishment of multi-year ice (Adey, 2010).

Second, sea ice and its relationship to scientific-military imaginaries
and practices reveals polar waters to be hazard rather than buffer---an
obstacle to unfettered mobility. Contemporary iterations of Arctic
geopolitics owe their poignancy to earlier antecedents. During the Cold
War, sea ice was conceptualised as a barrier to movement (Roberts,
2015). A slippery subject that would prove a difficult adversary for
submarine captains as rival naval forces. Countries such as Canada
established national ice services in the 1950s to provide further
coverage and assessment for shipping users. [Sea ice research, and for
that matter permafrost science, was in part funded by national
governments to enable and improve awareness and understanding of
ice-covered waters and cold environments (and Indigenous knowledges and
expertise enrolled if often under-acknowledged). In the military arena,
institutions such as the Office of Naval Research and the US Arctic
Submarine Laboratory in Barrow Alaska were charged with funding research
that sought to make ice more knowable, predictable and
governable.]{.underline} And yet the memoirs of US nuclear submarine
captains and published research on sea ice revealed the opposite---sea
ice was and is notoriously dynamic, confusing and unsettling to those
seeking to go under it, transit it at the surface and/or break through
from below (for example, McLaren, 2008). [Depending on seasonality, wind
direction, ocean temperatures and currents, militaries and scientists
were involved in a host of national and international initiatives
designed to improve seasonal charting, environmental management plans,
strategic patrols, and resource extractions plans.]{.underline} Richard
Powell\'s work on Canadian scientific authority in the 1950s illustrates
well the manner in which sea ice was caught up with sovereign and
security agendas (Powell, 2017).

Coastal states such as Russia and Canada were also eager to ensure that
their ice-covered waters were properly protected---environmentally and
legally---from transit traffic (Steinberg et al., 2015). In the 1960s
and 1970s, Canadian governments in particular were alarmed by the
prospect of US oil tanker traffic going backwards and forwards from
Alaska via the Northwest Passage. The presence of sea ice acted as a
politically helpful shipping hazard and thus possible deterrent to
foreign-registered ships wishing to cross through waters the Canadian
authorities considered to be 'historic' rather than subject to transit
rights. While Canada put in place additional environmental regulatory
safe-guarding measures (for example, the 1970 Arctic Waters Pollution
Prevention Act), the Northwest Passage remains a source of official
legal disagreement between Canada and the United States. Diminishing sea
ice, thus, acts as a catalyst for speculation about whether this
waterway might become a source of future friction either because the
waters are thought to be in principle less hazardous (a point that is
often contested by shipping and sea ice experts alike) or because
relevant details of the United Nations Law of the Sea Convention (UNCLOS
and Article 234) for 'ice-covered areas' are thought to be less relevant
in operational terms. As the Article in question

Coastal States have the right to adopt and enforce non-discriminatory
laws and regulations for the prevention, reduction and control of marine
pollution from vessels in ice-covered areas within the limits of the
exclusive economic zone, where particularly severe climatic conditions
and the presence of ice covering such areas for most of the year \[i.e.
6 months and one day\] create obstructions or exceptional hazards to
navigation, and pollution of the marine environment could cause major
harm to or irreversible disturbance of the ecological balance.

Article 234 was the only example of where UNCLOS recognised the presence
of ice-covered areas. Later the UN body the International Maritime
Organisation\'s Polar Code (entered into force in 2017) sets out
requirements for shipping entering and leaving polar waters. While
acknowledging that coastal communities 'in the Arctic could be, and that
polar ecosystems are, vulnerable to human activities, such as ship
operation' (emphasis added, Polar Code 2017). While the Polar Code noted
a 'could be' for possible impacts on Arctic coastal communities of
climate change, it addresses the operational challenges posed by sea ice
with considerable assertiveness. [Sea ice is framed throughout as a
technical problem that can be mitigated by collective action. Solutions
to sea ice will emerge through legal, technological and training
interventions.]{.underline}

[Third, sea ice as register of global rather than local or Indigenous
futures. When coastal communities in Alaska are posited as on the
frontline of climate change, sea ice and permafrost are spectacularised
in the sense of being made to stand for a harbinger of an unwanted
global future (Bronen,]{.underline} 2010[). There is often a slippage
between the everyday and local and the global and planetary. What gets
lost in this slippage is the notion that ice/frost/snow become caught up
in an extractive economy which prioritises the ramifications for
extra-territorial parties, global elemental spaces and the 'buffering'
affordances of ice and frozen ground.]{.underline} The Arctic is in
crisis primarily because it will not keep its frozen ground frozen and
its sea ice intact. The very thing that Cold War frontier engineers
dreamed of annihilating is now being cursed for not being resilient
enough (Fleming, 2010). We further assert for a ground to articulate an
Arctic that does not lose the verifiable danger and precarity of ice
melt and the livelihoods that continue to be changed, transformed and
dispossessed, which is largely consequential from the enactments of
racial capitalism but that also holds a refusal to fall victim to an
alarmist, polemical, devastation and declensionist narrative. [The
declensionist narrative is one that has been historical and often
wielded to discuss Indigenous peoples and their inevitable disappearance
conveniently from resource rich areas.]{.underline} [Care must be taken
when reporting the disappearance of ice]{.underline}. As Inupiaq poet
Joan Naviyuk Kane writes:

[Much of the discourse around the Arctic and Indigenous people
preoccupies itself with destruction ... It is couched in either the
concrete documentation of disappearance---erosion or submersion of land
due to climate change or climate-caused displacement, for instance---or
in the figurative language of loss (cited in Nunatsiaq
News,]{.underline} 2018[)]{.underline}

Taking up Kane\'s project, is there a way to identify the enactments of
colonialism without a spectacularised event of damage, loss and the
horror of that loss, as the vessel of discussion? And is it possible to
have that conversation without lioning Indigenous resilience as a
life-lesson for non-indigenous peoples elsewhere? As Eve Tuck and C. Ree
put it:

[Damage narratives are the only stories that get told about me, unless
I\'m the one that\'s telling them. People have made their careers on
telling stories of damage about me, about communities like mine. Damage
is the only way that monsters and future ghosts are conjured (Tuck and
Ree,]{.underline} 2013[)]{.underline}

### AT: Link of Omission

#### Mapping is an ongoing process that requires subjects to continue to believe in and legitimize the artificial boundaries created by and for colonialism -- the K is not a link of omission

[This thesis frames the subterranean as a space that is still in the
making and whose constitution is not yet settled. It views the
activities and products of **geological mapping as generative processes
that enable us to imagine the subterranean**, expand down into it and
draw it up into our surface worlds.]{.underline} As I will show in this
thesis, [**geological maps of the Arctic** today, as nearly 500 years
ago, contain reflections of societal meanings and aspirations of what
could or should become of a place, and resultingly, become a mechanism
to invent and **produce**]{.underline} (**[economic]{.underline}**)
**[spaces.]{.underline}**

[The production and realisation of imagined spaces is crucial to the
curation of socio-political and socio-environmental relations with
place.]{.underline} As political ecologists have noted, [**mapping** has
worked to **rationalise colonial interventions into colonised lands**
and supported the **transformation of lands'** existing ecosystems or
communities **into supporting** more **European, 'rationalised' forms of
spatial production**]{.underline} (c.f. Peluso, 1995; Tsing, 2005).
[**These actions enabled** forestry, mining, military or agricultural
use to become established and allowed **capitalist modes of accumulation
by dispossession to occur**]{.underline} (Harvey, 2003). While volumes
and the subterranean emerge in contemporary geographic literature as
relevant to territorial expansion, the extension of nation-states into
new geological frontiers using geological mapping techniques is
sometimes discussed as if it were a practice of the past, restricted to
early-stage (colonial) politics and histories of territorialisation
(Braun, 2000; Scott, 2008; Himley, 2019; Marston, 2019). However,
[**geological** **mapping**]{.underline}, and indeed mapping of
frontiers, [is **not** something that's **finished.** Geographers have
certainly not exhausted the critical leverage that new perspectives in
territorial politics and materiality offer to understand the meanings
and implications of different cartographies.]{.underline}

Geological mapping is not finished because many places that were
inaccessible 30 or 50 years ago have been brought closer to global
networks of geological knowledge and practice via a combination of
technological advances, changes in land tenure regimes, and climate
change opening up previously ice-covered spaces. Examples of this
include deep sea geologies (Childs, 2020), Antarctic landmasses (Yusoff,
2005) and parts of the Canadian Arctic, as discussed in this thesis.
[Expansion of human knowledge into new geological frontiers is therefore
an ongoing process: geological territorialisation and enrolment into
expansionist imaginations is not over, nor are the practices that enable
this to happen.]{.underline}

[Since geological mapping in 'remote' areas of the Earth]{.underline}
(such as parts of the Canadian Arctic or the sea floor) [draws the
natural environment into closer contact with human interference, **areas
that previously avoided intense industrial activity now stand to be
impacted by it.** As such, there is **increased pressure to** evaluate
not only what 'work' geological knowledge is doing to **rationalise
expansion into new**]{.underline} (subterranean) [**territories**, but
also a need to understand what trade-offs are made during the great
pinching together of surface and subsurface space.]{.underline} After
all, [geological knowledge production and the desire-driven philosophy
of resource extraction occurs against a backdrop of other land use
values and philosophies]{.underline} (Simpson, 2019). Political ecology
is well equipped to untangle what happens when these things meet: where
communities, environment and resources come into contact. However, the
story does not end, nor necessarily begin, there. There is, for example,
a need to understand who is making the knowledge we have about geology
and resources, how this happens and to what effect. How is the practice
of geological knowledge production supporting contemporary regimes and
dreamscapes of state-making, and who benefits and gets left behind in
the process?

Contrapuntal Reading of Narratives

The work of Edward Said, a professor of literature and one of the
founders of post-colonial studies, has inspired IR scholars to consider
their discipline from a critical perspective (Bilgin, 2016, 2021; Duvall
& Varadarajan, 2007; Oliveira, 2020). [Said broadened the understanding
of colonialism from territorial control, political domination and
military rule to include issues of knowledge, language and
mentality]{.underline}. He explored how Western media, academia and
politicians have a distorted colonial lens called "Orientalism" on
non-Western peoples, societies and cultures (Said 1978).
[Orientalism]{.underline} establishes power relations with broad social,
political and economic implications between the Western centres and
peripheral, [imagined "Others" as marginal, peripheral, powerless and
lesser in value.]{.underline} Originally, Said focused on the relations
between the West and the Orient, but today [Orientalism is understood to
be a global phenomenon]{.underline}, and not alien to IR scholarship
(Saramago, 2020Tickner, 2016; Tucker, 2018). [In the Arctic, the idea
was introduced by cultural anthropologist Ann Fienup-Riordan using the
term "Eskimo-Orientalism"]{.underline} (Fienup-Riordan, 1995). Applying
Said's post-colonial theory [in the context of the Arctic, she used the
concept to describe the way Alaskan Eskimos were depicted in American
movies.]{.underline}

The IR narratives with strong Eurocentric, Western historical roots
struggle even today with lingering practices of "Othering" the
nonWestern world (Duvall & Varadarajan, 2007; Tickner, 2016; Tucker,
2018). [Orientalism produces a totalizing "Other"; that is, the Arctic
is represented as a unified, unitary entity from the perspective of
state sovereignty]{.underline}. [In IR, the Arctic is]{.underline} a
space that is ["deeply embedded within performances of 'paternal
sovereignty' in state-building, international relations and
security"]{.underline} (Norum, 2016, 55, see also Gricius, 2021). Thus,
the m[ainstream IR narratives restrict their "worldliness" to certain
agencies and relations through]{.underline} academic expertise,
linguistic practices and [claims of authority.]{.underline} [Arctic IR
narratives are normalized through their **repetition** in media,
politics and science in a way that they are seen as **true, objective
and apolitical**]{.underline}. The close [relations between research and
politics as well as between academic and political institutions keep
Orientalism alive (]{.underline}see Kamola, 2020, see also Ei-Malik,
2015).

[Orientalism is problematic in its ordering, valuing and differentiating
knowledge about the world]{.underline} in a particular way.
[IR]{.underline} narratives construct and [imagine the Arctic
paradoxically as an international region]{.underline} through a select
few regional markers, such as its [being a materially based,
economically significant "resource region" and]{.underline}, at the same
time, [having a vulnerable]{.underline}, fragile [nature in need of
protection]{.underline}, and by drawing selectively on existing
historical and contemporary narratives. [Such totalizing]{.underline},
yet paradoxical, [narratives]{.underline} focus on comparatively few
local particularities, [generalize them and establish them as the
overarching regional, politically significant markers]{.underline}.
[These narratives attain their official, authoritative and clearly
definable form in regional political processes]{.underline} (Larner,
2002, see also Paasi, 2009).

[Narratives inform us about social relations, authority and
power]{.underline}. Power relations are expressed in narratives by
[narrators]{.underline} who [position themselves and others in their
accounts of the world.]{.underline} IR narratives are often considered
"[methodologically elitist" with their focus on narratives of political
decision-makers]{.underline} and experts (Stanley & Jackson, 2016). Such
[narratives legitimize power relations, naturalize interactions and
mobilize action or enable inaction]{.underline}. The [totalized
narratives of the Arctic do not consider the diversity of the
region]{.underline}, [and produce a world view that does not match local
experiences, everyday lives and varied concerns]{.underline}. Even if
such insights from inside the Arctic are not reflected in IR narratives,
it does not mean that they do not matter, as the advocates of "Global
IR" point out (Bilgin, 2021; Tucker, 2018).

According to geographer Anssi Paasi (2021), "[Othering" is not a
constant, static and singular phenomenon]{.underline} that can simply be
wiped away as desired. Rather, "[it is a complex, dynamic and malleable
phenomenon, which is historically contingent, political and politicised
phenomenon that often finds new forms and that tends to multiply
borders]{.underline}" in social life (Paasi, 2021, 20). Critically
oriented scholars focus on how "[Othering" narratives continue to play a
significant role in making the Arctic world and employ their insights to
decolonize the IR narratives]{.underline} (Gricius, 2021, see also
Bravo, 2015; Jensen, 2015; Huggan, 2016).

Narratives are often understood as texts. Said warned that "[reading and
writing texts are never neutral activities: there are interests, power,
passions, pleasures entailed no matter how aesthetic or entertaining the
work]{.underline}" (Said 1993, 318). [Texts such as literary works and
curricula, as well as visual representations of different kinds **such
as maps**, show how contemporary Orientalism operates in IR
narratives]{.underline}. In the following, I will apply contrapuntal
reading to study the IR narratives of "Arctic exceptionalism" and the
"Global Arctic" in contemporary texts produced by Arctic IR scholars.
For Said, each text has both an interior and an exterior world of its
own. A text manifests its "worldliness", that is, a set of relations
with its world mediated by the author. Texts might be complex and
paradoxical, blurring Western and the non-Western, local and global,
centre and periphery at the same time. A paradox is a seemingly absurd
or contradictory situation. To capture this complexity, Said calls his
method "contrapuntal", evoking counterpoint, that is, music composed of
two or more relatively independent melodies and the way they sound
together. The method aims at a critical reading of texts to explore
their cultural backgrounds, intertwined colonial roots and paradoxes.
For IR scholars, the method makes it possible to not only establish new
connections in thinking about "worldliness", but also uncover already
existing relations and gaps in them; it also encourages new ways to see
problems in world politics (Bilgin, 2016; Chowdhry, 2007).

### AT: Maps inevitable

#### **Land doesn't have to be mapped with border and strict spatial boundaries**

**Remy 3** \[Lola. "Making the map speak: Indigenous animated
cartographies as contrapuntal spatial representations." NECSUS,
12-6-2018.

Ayan Mahajan 🤪

In Adam Loften and Emmanuel Vaughan-Lee's short documentary Counter
Mapping (2018), Jim Enote, a Zuni farmer and director of the A:shiwi
A:wan Museum and Heritage Center in New Mexico, declares:

**[\[t\]o assume that people would look at the earth only from a vantage
point that is above and looking straight down doesn't consider the
humanity of living on the landscape. Saying that there's a pond, there
are cattails, there are turtles in that water -- that is a different
view that expands the human experience of a place.]{.underline}**

[A central concern of Indigenous mapping, as stressed by Margaret W.
Pearce, is the question of **expressing 'the geographies of human
experience and place in the map', far from a view of the land from
above, devoid of life and interactions.**\[43\] How can a map become a
testimony of the Indigenous experience and subjectivity? An answer to
this question lies in the practice of cognitive, or mental, mapping.
This type of map-making, simply put, captures the representations of
people's perception of an area, of their 'imaginary relationship to
\[their\] real conditions of existence'.]{.underline}\[44\] Originally
developed in relation to the urban experience of a fragmented space, it
was then used in various situations as an alternative to scientific
cartography.\[45\] For her video installation Memory Cards (2013),
Mohawk artist Hannah Claus, member of the Tyendinaga Mohawks of the Bay
of Quinte (birthdate unknown-), collaborated with First Nation
communities from Carleton-sur-Mer, Listuguj, and Gesgapegiag in Quebec.
She invited people to draw personal maps of familiar places of their
choice (their 'favourite territories'), and filmed the process of their
drawing. Using a self-constructed apparatus, she filmed their drawings'
evolution through (slightly transparent) paper. As a result, one can see
the image appearing out of nowhere, and our eyes follow the animated
line traced by the pencil with a sense of indeterminacy. Sometimes, the
drawer's hand casts a shadow on the paper, giving a sense of embodiment
and diffuse presence to the maps. Her installation, a floor-based
projection, superimposes two drawings or more, creating a play of
transparency and inscription. **[Refusing a single interpretative frame,
the superimposition of images insists on the communal aspect of
counter-cartography and on the multiplicity of perceptions of a given
space.]{.underline}**

Here, the film depicts map-making as a subjective process, and not
simply a product. The original French title of her work, Cartes
Mémoires, explicitly links maps (cartes) to memory and subjectivity. In
the hands of non-professional communities, they become a tool for
thinking about space in an embodied and personal way, cut off from
scientific measurements and objectivity. With her work, Hannah Claus
returns to the Indigenous tradition of map-making illustrating one's
personal stories. The performative aspect of Indigenous maps is further
transmitted through the immediacy of the apparatus, and the use of film
as a recording device. Rather than an argument about land ownership and
use, Cartes Mémoires presents a more intimate framework, transcribing
the subjectivity and memories of the community against their erasure by
official state maps as noted by Eades. Furthermore, Claus complicates
the colonial state's demarcation and bordering of Indigenous territory.
Rather than conforming to scientific cartographic codes, the circular
shape of the paper allows for an alternative representation of space.
Whereas some maps mirror the format of the frame and use a circular
composition, most of them seem to bleed out of the framed space and
expand in the mind of their maker.

By giving the means of animated cartography to Indigenous communities,
Hannah Claus and other filmmakers claim a new kind of representation of
space, one that includes different bodies and experiences and contains
the potential to threaten a colonial geography. In one scene of Jack
Pettibone Riccobono's (birthdate unknown-) controversial documentary The
Seventh Fire (2015), William 'Bill' Brown, an Ojibwe community member of
the White Earth Indian Reservation (Minnesota) draws a map of the
reservation to help the filmmaker locate Rob Brown, the person he is
looking for. This scene is shortly followed by an aerial shot of the
land in question, which starkly opposes the imagined and lived geography
with the synoptic view characteristic of American survey teams.\[46\]

Against the disembodied, impersonal rendition of the reservation,
characteristic of official governmental maps, this scene conveys the
experience and perception of a colonial space from the inside. It
reintroduces subjectivity (not only the narrator's but also the people
he mentions) into the spatial imaginary of the reservation. Through the
drawing and the voice of the map-maker, we are also told an indirect
narrative of Rob Brown: where he lives, who he is close to and visits
often, his habits, etc. The voice, followed by the movements of the
camera over the drawing, directs us through the space of the reserve in
a linear way, similar to the panning of Obomsawin's camera over the
historical documents she is commenting on. The question of scale and
perspective, as noted by Martin Mitchell, is at the centre of an
Indigenous approach to mapmaking.\[47\] In Obomsawin's and Riccobono's
films, cartography becomes a way to emphasise the relationality inherent
to space, the links between places, people, and things, as Jim Enote
describes in Counter Mapping:

[**\[m\]odern maps don't have a memory. For me, the whole landscape
around here is home. I have patterned languages that help me to remember
how I get from one place to another.** I go to my field in the summer. I
collect wood in the fall and winter. I may be pinion picking or going to
collect tea. This whole constellation of what makes up a map to me has
always been far beyond a piece of paper.]{.underline}

CARTOGRAPHY (MAPS AND MAPPING) Both literally and metaphorically, [maps
and mapping are dominant practices of colonial and post-colonial
cultures]{.underline}. [Colonization itself is often consequent on a
voyage of 'discovery', a bringing into being of 'undiscovered'
lands]{.underline}. The process of [discovery is reinforced by the
construction of maps,]{.underline} [whose existence is a means of
textualizing the spatial reality of the other,]{.underline} naming or
,in almost all cases, [renaming spaces in a symbolic and literal act of
mastery and control]{.underline}. In all cases [the lands so colonized
are **literally reinscribed**, written over,]{.underline} as [the names
and languages of the indigenes are replaced]{.underline} by new names,
[or are **corrupted** into new and Europeanized forms by the
cartographer]{.underline} and explorer. [This was a long-standing
feature of colonialism]{.underline} and not restricted to distant
unknown lands. Irish playwright Brian Friel graphically illustrates this
in Translations, which deals with [the mapping and renaming of the West
of Ireland by the English]{.underline} army in the nineteenth century,
[a process in which the native Irish (Gaelic) culture is literally
overwritten by English imperialism.]{.underline} [Maps also **inscribe
their ideology** on territory in numerous way]{.underline}s other than
place-names. [The blank spaces of early maps signify a literal **terra
nullius**, an open and inviting (**virginal**) space into which the
European imagination can project itself and]{.underline} into which [the
European (usually male) explorer must **penetrate**]{.underline}. Such
[blank spaces invite other cultural superscriptions, such as the
elaborately drawn monsters and **sub-human wild-men** (savages) of most
early maps]{.underline}. Imaginative transferences are frequent. Thus
[early maps of Australia]{.underline} (Terra Incognita or Terra
Incognita Australis as it was known in the seventeenth century when the
first European maps of the northern coast-line were drawn) [show an
interior populated by elephants and pygmies]{.underline}. Similarly [the
so-called cannibals of the Indies]{.underline} (a term derived from the
corruption of the Spanish name for the Carib peoples) [appear frequently
on maps of the interior of Africa]{.underline}. Indeed[,]{.underline} by
the early twentieth century, the term is almost synonymous with Africans
in popular literature and humour, as witness the numerous cartoons that
represent cannibals as black people with bones through their noses
roasting missionaries in a pot. [The fictionality of the narratives of
such processes of 'discovery', which the process of mapping objectifies,
is emphasized by the role of the native guide in such explorations, who
leads the explorer]{.underline} to the interior. [The prior knowledge of
the land that this dramatizes, and which **cannot be wholly silenced**
in the written accounts of these explorations, **is ignored, and
literally silenced** by the act of mapping]{.underline}, [since the
indigenous people **have no voice** or even presence that can be heard
in the new discourse of scientific measurement and written texts that
cartography implies.]{.underline} [They figure, if at all, only as
illustration -- savages, cannibals or monsters. The allegorization of
space (and its hierarchization) is also defined by maps, first by the
decision as to which projection to favour,since this privileges some
land-spaces over others]{.underline}; or [by the decision to orient all
maps on a North--South axis]{.underline}; or [by the creation of a body
of special maps that divide the land into such 'objective' categories as
climatic regions, population densities and, not least, natural
resources.]{.underline} [Maps can also serve as (allegorical) **tools of
exploitation**]{.underline}.In his analysis of Mercator's Atlas, José
Rabasa (1993) demonstrates how [the projection map became a major **tool
of Euro-centrism**, defining European latitudes as pivotal reference
points for the conception of a **world hierarchy**,]{.underline} and
[embodying as geographical fact European attitudes about]{.underline}
the nature of [the world]{.underline}. In effect, [the European map
created]{.underline} what has remained [the contemporary geographical
world reality.]{.underline} [The definition of cultures as tropical in a
world where temperate is the norm]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} as
[densely populated or thinly populated]{.underline},[or]{.underline} as
[resource rich or poor]{.underline}, [are essential discriminations upon
which]{.underline} a practice of [exploitation or **control** can be
erected]{.underline}. That [these techniques also feature in such modern
controlling **discourses as 'development'**]{.underline} studies
[illustrates how persistently the sciences of cartography and mapping
have contributed to the establishment and reestablishment of the
**various world orders**]{.underline} of the last few centuries.
[Although ethnography]{.underline} (the supposedly objective scientific
description of 'primitive'peoples and cultures) [has frequently borne
the brunt of anti-colonial attacks]{.underline} as being the principal
intellectual discourse of colonization, [it is worth noting that
geography and geographers,and the science of **cartography, played at
least as important a role in** underpinning the objects and values of
**the colonial enterprise**]{.underline}. The Royal Geographical Society
was a prime mover in the imperial conquests of the 'undiscovered'
regions of the world, and it is significant that as Kipling's Kim
illustrates (the cover of the Head of the Secret Service in that text,
Creighton Sahib, is that of the Director of the General Survey of
India), [**the colonial mapper** and surveyor **was** frequently **the
most ubiquitous figure of imperial control**.]{.underline}

This book begins by reading into the [decolonial argument that the
**colonial** matrix of power largely tends to transform modernity into
an instrument of domination which manifested in the colonization of
**political cartographies**.]{.underline} [As regards the colonial
matrix of power is concerned, it is characterized by the
operationalization of **ontological** and **episte- mological** binaries
and hierarchies that was engendered by the unequal politico-economic and
**psycho**-cultural relations between the colonizing metropolitan core
and the colonized periphery. Such an unequal rela- tionship of
**domination** and **subjugation** emerged as crucial elements in
determining the structural/functional conditionalities of the working of
international relations, as well as the epistemologies that attempted to
explain the same. It happened as the grand theories of International
Rela- tions that have assumed the status of the disciplinary canon
tended to impart a kind of epistemological legitimacy to the unequal
relationship between the Western **metropolitan** core and the
non-Western periphery. Such a legitimacy was mediated through the
**hegemonic** epistemolog- ical and pedagogical practices of the grand
theories of **IR**. In this way, the grand theories in IR tended to
demonstrate a kind of deep-seated neocolonial imperial attributes that
are disseminated across the world as axiological postulates of the
**metaphysics** of cosmopolitanism. Considering this, it may be stated
that any satisfactory explanation of the nature of the working of IR,
hence must involve an epistemological engagement with the
**postcolonial** **ontology**.]{.underline} Such an engagement manifests
as an exigency vii viii PREFACE when we begin unpacking the ontic and
epistemic foundations of the disciplinary matrix of the subject of IR.
[As we pursue this very process of **mapping**, it becomes evident that
the disciplinary matrix of IR has largely evolved by way of treading a
teleolog- ical trajectory of synchronic **Eurocentric** and
**ethnocentric** history. Owing to such a teleological trajectory, the
scope and subject matter of IR has deeply grounded itself into a
paradigmatic thrust on Western ontic and epistemic **supremacism**. With
such a supremacist epistemological asser- tion, the world considerably
gets interpreted from the mere lens of the stagiest doctrinal progress
of European history.]{.underline} By virtue of such a West- centric and
ethnocentric intellectual project, a section of the theory in the
disciplinary matrix of IR has incarnated into the status of a canon. On
its part, the elite minority of the epistemic community of IR, who are
the treasurers of such a canon, have been hypostatized into the status
of the apostles. [The **hegemony** of the discourse of such a canon and
the hierarchy of the theoreticians privy to such a discourse tends to be
medi- ated through the universalizing hegemonic tropes of knowledge that
are embodied in the 'grand theories' of IR.]{.underline} Hence, for any
project that aims at making the discipline of IR more cosmopolitan in
character that would commend a wider contextual significance, the
dismantling of the theistic doctrinal hegemony and the primacy of the
sacrosanct position of grand theories of IR manifest as pressing
disciplinary imperatives. [Such an enterprise in the act of dismantling
seems to have become inevitable, mainly because the grand theories are
largely situated in a kind of an **axiological** postulate of the need
for the substantiation of the meta-histories that are constituted
through an epistemic focus upon the local history of Western
civilization. This kind of focus on the **local** history of **Europe**
renders world history to appear as a mere **reductionist** synchronic
narrative. It is in such a narrow ontic narrative on history and the
supremacism of Western epistemology that the meta-theoretical
foundations of the discipline of IR tend to be pivoted. The tropes of
knowledge that are produced in such a circumstance considerably shape
the pedagogical and epistemological processes in the discipline of
Interna- tional Relations.]{.underline} Such a heuristic
over-determinism that characterizes the technical discourse of the
discipline of International Relations is firmly grounded in the
ontological roots of a Eurocentric interpretation of the past and an
ethnocentric definition of the epistemology of IR. This kind of
disciplinary ontology is propelled by what has been desig- nated as IR's
Westphalian common-sense. For such a common-sense, our PREFACE ix
present-day international society has directly descended from the
universal European system. Owing to this, the technical discourse of the
disci- pline of IR has largely tended to be shaped in terms of the
grammar of the Westphalian conception of international order. By virtue
of this, the paradigm of Westphalia tends to act as the core ontological
principle driving the formation of grand theories in IR. What gets
erased in such an epistemological trajectory is the very diachronic
history of international relations that is constituted by the pres- ence
of a world that is outside Europe. Such a world that is designated as
the postcolonial spatio-temporal topoi seems to have been regarded as a
disjunctive structural imaginary, a historical break and an epistemolog-
ical lag by the dominant hegemonic technical discourse of the discipline
of IR. Considering this kind of epistemology of IR, the task at hand is
to look at historical narratives by situating them in their specific
spatio- temporal idiosyncrasies. To do this, the imperative is to
decolonize the meta-theoretical foundations of IR. In order to do this,
the restruc- turing of the ontological, epistemological, methodological
and theoretical underpinnings of the discipline becomes an exigency. An
attempt has been made in this book to undertake such a task of
restructuring, by interrogating the disciplinary matrix of IR at the
level of meta-theory. This interrogation has been situated largely on
the plank of ontology and it is done by critically examining the working
of grand theories in IR. Based on this, a case has been made in this
book for placing mid-level theories at the core of the ontological
concerns of the discipline. Such a thrust on the significance of
mid-level theories, it has been argued in this book, goes a long way in
the restructuring of the disciplinary matrix of IR at the level of
meta-theory. Taking cognizance of this, the book has been designed as a
venture toward committing a kind of disciplinary heresy. This is because
it seeks to question the deep-seated conceptual grammar and the
meta-theoretical structure of the grand theories of the discipline of
IR. Such a struc- ture and content of the grand theories have
considerably contributed to the substantiation of the imperializing
nature of the epistemology of the discipline[. In any case, the origin
and growth of such a process of epis- temological **imperialism**
happened as the product of the genealogies of the West-centric
ethnocentric disciplinary matrix of IR.]{.underline} However, such an
argument seems to be a mere reductionist one that renders a less-than-
perfect explanation for the sustenance of the hegemony of grand theories
x PREFACE that are produced in the West. Rather, the rote
epistemological and peda- gogical practices that have characterized the
structure and content of the disciplinary history of IR seem to have
been equally responsible. Such practices are manifest in the mimetic
reproduction of the arguments of the grand theories that are undertaken
for [the purpose of mapping the terrain of the 'international', a task
that is done by being completely oblivious of the phenomenological
caveat toward the need for suspension of our intentions and the
hermeneutic postulate of recognizing the contextual significance of any
phenomenon.]{.underline} [Such epistemic endeavors factor deeply in
perpetuating the **intellectual** **colonization** of the discipline of
IR by the imperializing heuristic power of the grand
theories.]{.underline} Hence, even at the cost of committing a kind of
apostasy, I dare to question the established canon that has been
disseminated across generations. By doing this, I present to the
readers, my ideas for liberating the discipline of IR from the
colonizing mental yoke of the grand theories. In any case, while the
book undertakes such a task, I wish to render a caveat at the very
outset. I intend to make it very clear here that neither I am aiming to
engage in any kind of a nihilistic endeavor at dismantling a particular
form of theory, nor do I seek to propose any kind of liberation theology
that would venture toward recrafting the disciplinary matrix of IR by
way of scripting its theoretical space on a clean slate. Rather, the
simplest objective in this book is to involve myself in a flirtatious
but not very dilettantish engagement with second-order theorizing. While
I do this, the aim here would be to carry out a rigorous critique of the
grand theories of IR which form part of first-order theorizing. Such a
pursuit of course cannot be undertaken by being oblivious to the need
for adherence to the logic of pedantic precision and methodological
agnosticism.

There are many connections between capital and place, and places are in
competition with other places for highly mobile resources (Cresswell,
2004). Capitalism is dependent on its spatial fixes, and it "builds and
rebuilds a geography in its own image" (Harvey, 2000, p. 54). The
tension between capital and place is accentuated by neoliberal policies
and discourses, many of which seek to commodify places and re-story
histories to align with trends in extraction and consumption. The term
neoliberalism is used to describe the currently dominant system of
global governance that promotes free market conditions that "prioritize
corporations and economic growth over considerations of social equity or
environmental protection" (Tuck & McKenzie, 2015, p. 3). In today's
society, regrettably, commodifying everything and subjecting almost all
transactions to a cost-benefit analysis is the dominant way of thinking
(Harvey, 2000). Moreover, "\[n\]eoliberalism builds on a western
trajectory of cultural norms and practices" (McKenzie, 2012, p. 165),
while neo-liberal policy agendas have brought to light differentiating
spatial effects of unequal provision (Gulson & Symes, 2007). [An example
of how power influences place can be witnessed amongst Native American
and First Nations students living in the United States and Canada,
whereby the scientific method/**Western worldview oftentimes coexists
with Native spiritually along with a deep connection with the land and
animals. In this vein, power represents "the living energy that inhabits
and/or composes the universe, and place being the relationship of things
to each other"**]{.underline} (Deloria, 2001, p. 23). [**The connections
that Indigenous people have to places are undeniably some of the
strongest in the world.** As such, "Indigenous people represent a
culture emergent from a place, and they actively draw on the power of
that place, physically and spiritually"]{.underline} (Wildcat, 2001a, p.
32). [Furthermore, **tribal persons "find meaning in the world and
recognize through experience that they are of a people and
place"**]{.underline} (Wildcat, 2001b, p. 145). [This enduring sense of
place within Indigenous communities is not static, instead place serves
as a location for "contemporary Indigenous knowledge and language
practices to comingle with others, change, and yet persist"]{.underline}
(Hornberger & McCarty, 2012, p. 6). **[Many Indigenous epistemologies
view the world as a dynamic and living place, but many of these
perspectives have been challenged and/or supplanted by dominant
European/Western worldviews]{.underline}** (Lucas, 2013). **[Indigenous
communities use place/land as central reference point; in contrast,
Western communities use time as the narrative of central
importance]{.underline}** (Coulthard, 2010). **[Through the processes of
colonialism, Europeans worldview became known as The World History,
displacing all other experiences and cultural histories around the
globe]{.underline}** (Deloria, 2001; Simpson, 2002). **[This has had a
devastating impact on how we view and interact with places, since most
times the Western worldview is unable to understand any other history,
as it is the "truth" and superior to all others]{.underline}** (Deloria,
2001; Lucas, 2013). "Until relatively recently in human history, the
social activities through which distinctive forms of knowledge are
produced have for the most part been localized" (Gough, 2002, p. 1223).
Unfortunately, colonization has allowed Western thought to travel around
the world, appearing to be devoid of any one cultural fingerprint; an
undeniable universal truth and rational way of thinking (Gough, 2002).
While this Western conception of place, rooted in the power of
colonialism and resource extraction, narrows the possibilities of how
humans interact in and with places; the history of colonization and
cultural oppression creates a context for shared experiences that tie
identity to place (Kana'iaupuni & Malone, 2010). Wildcat (2001b) posits
that "[\[p\]lace is not merely the relationship of things, resources or
objects, it is the site where dynamic processes of interaction occur
-where processes between other living beings or other-than-human persons
occur]{.underline}" (p. 144). Thus, "\[e\]ducation space is therefore
revealed as fluid, interconnected and constructed through power
relations" (Cook & Hemming, 2011, p. 6). Coulthard (2010) states that
["\[p\]lace is a way of knowing, experiencing, and relating with the
world -- and these ways of knowing often guide forms of resistance to
power relations that threaten to erase or destroy our senses of
place"]{.underline} (p. 79). [This resistance to power is articulated by
arguing against the contemporary pathological drive for expansion,
growth, and accumulation]{.underline} (colonial-capitalist ideologies).
Coulthard (2010) stresses the importance of sharing, egalitarianism,
respect for one another and the land, and autonomy, thus nurturing a
sense of place. Sense of place research considers how people connect
with places and how those connections influence their sentiments and
behaviours towards the environment, which may have significant
implications for sustainability education (Ardoin, Schuch & Gould,
2012).

### !\-\--Genocide

#### Western forms of cartography facilitate the domination of external settlers over indigenous populations, greenlighting genocide in the name of exploration and discovery.

Them All'? Revisiting Legalities Through Cartographic Representations of

When looking at how cartography marks legalities within space, a
causational circular relationship between cartography and law can be
observed: [**Established legal orders may be incorporated on a map,
while, in turn, a map may put forward existing legal or political claims
over space in support of a legal argument. In other words, mapping
becomes both a "requirement" and a "tool" of power over space,4 since
maps operate as instruments of legal power, capable of narrating,
representing, generating, or even (re)claiming territory.**5 Drawing
lines on space (what Deleuze and Guattari call "striation")6 and
representing it as a horizontal flattened Euclidean surface7 have been
historically a necessary precondition for the creation of sovereign
states, **aiming to conceptualize space as "territory" and establish
sovereign power over a demarcated area,8 wherein the sovereign entity
succeeds independence from external unconsented intervention (or
interference) and determines the monopoly of violence.** Territory as a
bounded space in international law appears as a historical,
geographical, political, and juridical concept that is in constant need
of being exercised and performed by sovereign entities. **The concept of
"territory" is thus not a state of "existence" but a "semiotic practice"
originating from the land, which, in turn, gives existential meaning to
space and makes it amenable to sovereign power, appropriation, and legal
treatment.**9 In turn, the manner according to which states'
geographical limits are determined, as well as the way authority and
control over a people are exercised, is further known as
territoriality.]{.underline}10 Taking, however, the concept of territory
as a granted in thinking about space and idealizing the territorial
state as the sole molder of spatiality fall under what Agnew labels as a
"territorial trap."11 Maps thus as an instrumental means of
territorializing space and drawing lines upon it have historically borne
the responsibility of perpetuating the territorial trap of international
law. Yet with borders shifting, new actors emerging, and legal as well
as geopolitical relationships constantly changing, cartography becomes a
complex and ever-evolving tool in determining law's relationship to
space.12

Early modern European cartographic representations of the world provide
valuable information about how actors thought about political space,
organization, and authority upon it.13 Since the beginning of
colonization and the dawning of international law, the study of the
world gained enormous impetus from overseas voyaging that necessitated
an increase in both navigation and cosmography.14 [From the 15th century
onward, cartography has served as an instrumental means for European
nations to ascertain sovereignty over space and presume imperial claims
over previously uncharted areas legally conceptualized as, among others,
"terra incognita," "terra nullius," or "vacuum
domicilium."]{.underline}15 Cartography was of decisive importance in
these imperial endeavors of European nations, as the world previously
"unknown" to the west needed to be illustrated as a "blank space" on
maps, thereby opening new avenues for sovereign claims and colonial
expansion.16 [Against the backdrop of a territorial conceptualization of
space, the colonial world was subject to the acquisition of title
through occupation, since "space" in the preexisting societies of the
"new" world was not territorially organized by a sovereign authority,
delineated boundaries, and land ownership in a Western sense, and thus
was considered to be "vacant."17 **More specifically, nomadic societies
were seen as the furthest from sovereign authority, as they lacked
permanent territorial confinements and consistent agriculture and
fisheries operations: facts that allowed European empires to justify
colonization.**]{.underline}18 This dialectic between an imagined vacant
space and the processes of drawing lines on it is well anchored in the
foundations of the international legal order, and cartography served as
a major tool for the latter to attain its expansion.

[In this context, throughout the age of "discovery"---or better,
"rediscovery," as De Gourdon puts it19---the conceptualization of the
colonial world as a "terra nullius" waiting for European authority and
resource extraction was supported by maps of large void spaces that
portrayed the Americas (and not least other parts of the world) as an
empty territory open for appropriation and exploitation.20 Under the
doctrine of discovery, the newly charted areas soon became the European
states' transoceanic territories, vacant of any pre-\\existing authority
and hence susceptible to "occupation" and subject to the colonial rule's
political and economic ambitions.21 Soon after, cartography became a
device to **enable slavery, forced relocations of Indigenous
communities, systematized assimilation policies, massive land theft, and
even genocides** in the newly "discovered" world.22 Under this
rationale, America soon became a "produced" European territory charted
through maps and legal documents that established jurisdictions in
bounded spaces, while dispossessing and destructing preexisting
Indigenous populations.23 **In turn, non-Western conceptualizations of
space constructed through competing epistemologies were deemed inferior
or incorrect and misrecognized in many cases.24**]{.underline}

Closely interconnected with the processes of state and industrial
colonialism, [the surveying and mapping projects]{.underline}, and the
missionary activities [were the interest in and the collecting of Sámi
material culture in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries]{.underline}. [As part of a widespread interest in the Sámi,
and not least their perceived heathen rituals and witchcraft, Sámi
material objects, such as sacred drums, were much sought-after by many
collectors around Europe]{.underline}. During the colonial campaigns,
[many drums and other sacred objects such as stone or wooden sieidi were
destroyed by missionaries and their helpers]{.underline} (see, e.g.,
Tornæus 1900, 32-3; Reuterskiöld 1910, 42; 1927,9; Rydving 1995, 62-7).
But many drums were also confiscated and brought to different
collections in Uppsala, Stockholm, and Copenhagen, and from there to
collectors all over Europe. [This process of colonial collecting was
thus marked by a certain emotional ambivalence]{.underline}: [on the one
hand,]{.underline} [repulsion and a will to destroy, on the other,
desire and a will to possess]{.underline} (see Snickare 2014; Nordin and
Ojala 2015; 2018). Later, in the early nineteenth century, as a
continuation of the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century collecting [and
mapping, scholars, explorers, and local doctors and clergymen also
started to gather Sámi **human remains** from deceased individuals as
well as from graves, for anatomical collections and subsequent **racial
biological collections** at universities and museums]{.underline}. [The
mapping]{.underline} and collecting [of Sápmi now included not only land
and culture, but also the people of Sápmi themselves-aiming to define
and control land, culture, and **people**]{.underline} (see further

[For centuries, cartographers]{.underline} -- alongside writers and
artists -- have [projected onto the Arctic an imaginary
world]{.underline} located on the outskirts of the European ecumene, [a
world of emptiness, whiteness, and purity, an uninhabited and
uninhabitable space balanced between utopia and dystopia.]{.underline}
When Russia, Denmark, Canada, Norway, Sweden, Finland, and [the United
States expanded their 'national' space northward]{.underline}, [they
brought not only their modes of thinking, systems of governance, and
languages with them, but also spatial perceptions unfamiliar to Arctic
local populations]{.underline}. The previously [white]{.underline} and
virgin [spaces on the top of European world maps]{.underline} were [soon
filled with place names in English, French, Russian, and
Danish]{.underline}, honouring 'discoverers' and 'founders' who spread
the European, Asian, and American territories 'beyond' the frontiers of
their historical colonisation. In this chapter, we foreground very
different Arctic cartographies by studying strategies aimed at
establishing a decolonial mapping of the circumpolar North, taking into
account the variety of cultures and perspectives of those who live in
the region.1 Through examples taken from cultural, cartographic, and
toponymic mediated actions, we wish to put forward a politico- cultural
movement at the junction of geostrategy, the arts, cartography, and the
takeover of power by communities. Recent [postrepresentational
approaches to cartography have advocated for a perspective that
understands '\[m\] apmaking and map use' as 'embodied and dynamic',
emphasising that 'maps are constituted in and through diverse,
discursive and material processes']{.underline} (Kitchin, Perkins, and
Dodge 2007, 17). Turning their [attention to 'living cartographies' and
foregrounding what maps do as well as what people do with
maps]{.underline} (Rossetto 2014, 522-- 6), these critical trends h[ave
rethought mapping as performative and emergent,]{.underline} as ongoing
actions- in- process, and [created links between cartographic theory
and]{.underline} fields such as [phenomenology, cognitive science, and
new materialism]{.underline}. These new directions in cartographic
theory are [particularly useful for discussions of decolonial mapping
projects]{.underline} because they [counter the association between
cartography and abstraction that informs national and colonial
cartographies]{.underline} at the expense of lived experience (see Roth
2009). For Bjørn Sletto, such [cartographic abstraction 'inevitably
effect\[s\] violence to the fluid, shifting, and socially contingent
nature of lived, indigenous spatial relationships']{.underline} (2009,
147). Similarly, Renee Pualani Louis et al. write that 'there is still a
[tendency to view Western cartography as the standard]{.underline} by
which all other cartographies are measured' (2012, 77). '[Western
cartography]{.underline}' is here [understood as a territorial
form]{.underline} of mapping [that fixes space and sets
boundaries]{.underline}. Indeed, as Annita Hetoevehotohke'e Lucchesi
maintains, 'many Indigenous nations have rich traditions of mapping',
and she aims 'to dispel the myth that Indigenous peoples did not, and do
not, draw maps' (2018, 2). As she argues, '[rhetoric and scholarship
that ignores Indigenous cartographic practices denies thousands of years
of advancements, traditions, and intellectual property created by
Indigenous people']{.underline} (2018, 14). For her, the [decolonial
potential of maps lies in their capacity to create connections to the
land]{.underline} (2018, 15) and 'tell Indigenous stories in a
meaningful way' (2018, 12). In Sápmi, for instance, joiks are living
maps of the land; the soundscape of the joik recalls the land and is a
performative act of the landscape, mountain, animal, or person made
alive through the joik. More broadly, we argue that [combining a focus
on mapping as a creative and embodied practice with Indigenous
cartographic thought and spatial philosophies highlights the
transformative and generative potential of cartography and opens up the
very understanding of what constitutes maps and mapping]{.underline},
whether in the context of Indigenous or non- Indigenous artistic and
cultural production from the circumpolar Arctic. We will begin by
focusing on the theoretical and methodological context of cartography as
an instrument of power in colonial and Indigenous contexts and go on to
discuss examples from Nunavik, Sápmi, Kalaallit Nunaat (Greenland), and
Norway. These [political and artistic initiatives involve reversals of
cartography and counter- mappings of the Artic]{.underline}. They credit
[aesthetics with the ability to redefine spatial perceptions and,
consequently, to act upon existing power dynamics.]{.underline} In doing
so, they transmit ancestral knowledge, [imagine beyond colonial
violence, and assert Indigenous self- determination.]{.underline}

The [rise of **scientific racism** in the mid- nineteenth century
biologized race as something measured through supposedly innate
characteristics of the body.]{.underline} Before that, many philosophers
attributed human difference to geography and climate, a concept now
referred to as "[environmental determinism]{.underline}." The rise of
environmental determinism is often attributed to work by Ellen C. Semple
in the early twentieth century, which drew on Friedrich Ratzel's
Anthropogeographie (1882 and 1891).15 In that text, Ratzel influentially
analyzed "the geographical distribution of societies, the relation
between migration and the physical environment, and . . . the influence
of environments upon societies." 16 Environmental deter- minism was not
a unitary theory agreed upon across all thinkers but was a common theme
that transversed multiple conversations long before Ratzel. Scholars
drawing upon and criticizing his inferences rippled out following his
work. Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel writes in The Philosophy of History
that "[groups who lived in certain climatic zones should not be
considered as historical actors.]{.underline} . . . In the Frigid and in
the Torrid zone the locality of World- historical peoples cannot be
found." 18 For Hegel, inhabitants of the "frigid" and "torrid" locales
of the globe should not be considered as actors in the history of the
world. Hegel's characterization of appropriate historical actors
emerging from particular geographies was not created in a vacuum. His
influences were many and those influences constitute a genealogy that
can be traced back further still. The set of quotes that follow are not
exhaustive but [demonstrate the discursive proliferation of linking
climate and geography to racialized bodily characteristics, especially
in the Arctic]{.underline}. One common dimension of such thinking was
that [peoples of Arctic environments]{.underline} were the [strongest
example of environ- mental determinism that resulted in an inferior
intelligence.]{.underline} Georges- Louis Leclerc, also known as the
Comte de Buffon, wrote that "nothing can afford a stronger example of
the influence of climate than this race of Laplanders, who are situated,
along the whole polar circle . . . the breadth of which is limited by
nothing but excessive cold; for that race totally dis- appears whenever
the climate becomes a little." 19 Similarly, David Hume argued that "all
the nations, which live beyond the polar circles or between the tropics,
are inferior to the rest of the species, and are incapable of all the
higher attainments of the human mind." 20 In that same writing, Hume
references George (Bishop) Berkeley, who claimed that "the native of a
cold climate" have some intelligence, but "the north- ern geniuses are
like melons, of which not one in fifty is good; but when it is so, it
has an exquisite relish." 21. According to these men, Indigenous peoples
of the Arctic suffer from their surrounding northern climes, and by
contrast temperate zones have the opposite influence. [Immanuel
Kant's]{.underline} lectures from the 1750s to the 1790s include this
quote: "In the hot countries the human being matures in all aspects
earlier, but [does not, however, **reach the perfection** of those in
the temperate zones]{.underline}. Humanity is at its [greatest
perfection in the race of the whites."]{.underline} 22 Comte de Buffon
agrees, stating, "The [most **temperate climate**]{.underline} . . .
[produces the most handsome and beautiful men]{.underline}. It is from
this climate that the ideas of the genuine colour of mankind, and of the
various degrees of beauty, ought to be derived." 23 Hegel again concurs
and summarizes these relating bodies of thought when he wrote that "the
true theatre of History is therefore the temperate zone." 24 These
excerpts demonstrate the [perceived superiority of whiteness brought
about by the geographies of a temperate zone]{.underline} as well as a
supposed nongenerativity and [**inferiority** of both ice
geographies]{.underline} and peoples of a "frigid or torrid zone" or
"[polar circle]{.underline}." I call this **[phenomenon temperate-
normativity]{.underline}**.

To grasp the discourse around Grind and the confusion that it has
caused, following Baumgarten, one has to analyse what has been fused
together in its aesthetic constitution and proceed to disentangle the
values, moral status, ethics, invested power relations and politics that
the case is pregnant with. This is not undertaken to "judge" the work of
art or its interpretations, to assess its value or to see whether
something has been "misused" or "misunderstood". [The purpose of the
inquiry is to examine how the work reflects the aesthetic constitution
of the Arctic and the politics of aestheticization.]{.underline}

Grind is a fusion of cultural signifiers, displaying a stereotypical
Arctic and the indigenous as a part of it. In addition to direct Sámi
references, such as commercial replicas of gákti, the men's headpiece
and footwear, the video includes possible references to Russia, such as
a black scarf with red floral patterns. The same scarf worn as a
headband brings to mind the First Nations of North America and the
leather fringes and geometrical patterns on fabrics in the video
resemble those used by the Navajo. The fur hats in the video may suggest
any Arctic area, as direct indications of the region's cold weather.
[Where the references to the Arctic are intermingled, so, too, are those
to the indigenous peoples living inside and outside the
region]{.underline}. Uusitalo (2017) describes the aesthetics as evoking
"murky" northern culture, [indicating the elusiveness and general nature
of visual elements that refer to hardly anybody or anything specific.
This fusion reveals common denominators: phantasy, Otherness, exoticism
and erotization.]{.underline}

[The geographical distance]{.underline} of the country's southern from
its northern regions [has made it possible to use Lapland as Finland's
"internal Other"]{.underline} (Hiltunen, 2019, 87). [The nationalistic
project of becoming a civilized European nation required providing a
counterpart from which to distance oneself, namely the Sámi, who have
been characterized as a backward and inferior people]{.underline}
(ibid., 87). Like Africa, Sápmi, [the Sámi homeland, was turned into an
exotic, constructed space used as a counterpart to the conceited
centre]{.underline} (Nordin & Ojala, 2018, 63). One sees the same
mindset at work when Europe defined the Orient as its opposite; [neither
had any more than imaginary ontological stability]{.underline} (ibid.,
88). [For colonial rule, a racial geography and orientalist epistemology
with regard to sexual boundaries constituted masculinized
management]{.underline} (Levine, 2000, 7, 13). [In]{.underline} [popular
representations]{.underline}, such as films, Lapland [was a romantic and
exotic locale]{.underline} (ibid., 89): [Sámi women]{.underline} in The
White Reindeer (1952) [possess]{.underline} [supernatural and sexual
powers]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} in Sensuela (1973) they [exhibit
unrestrained sexual behaviour]{.underline} (Hiltunen, 2019, 91), [more a
facet of nature rather than culture]{.underline} (ibid., 98).

Ulrike Schaper et al. [use a portmanteau word "sexotic" for the
intersection of sexualization and exoticization, a strictly relational
category that "build\[s\] on alleged differences in the sexual drive,
attitudes towards sexuality and sexual behavior]{.underline}, [which
construct them as the origin and determinant of the exotic quality" that
also "constructs the 'exotic' as sexually attractive, desirable and
stimulating]{.underline} \[...\] for example, [the sexual fetishization
of a certain skin color" (]{.underline}2020, 115). [Before the sexuality
discourse of the eighteenth century]{.underline}, the French term
"[exotic" referred to the natural world of flora and fauna]{.underline},
and [came to suggest race only after the human being became regarded
primarily as a biological being (]{.underline}ibid., 117). Although
[this naturalization]{.underline} did not concern all of humanity, it
[played into racial and gender stereotypes, equating non-European women
as wild, sensual and permissive]{.underline} (ibid.), [resembling the
aesthetic division in which the natural and the feminine share the same
qualities of irrationality and immorality.]{.underline}

Queer in the Arctic[\-\--Queering the Arctic?]{.underline}

[What]{.underline}, then, [could be the connection between theorizing
and analysing queer, and theorizing and analysing the
Arctic]{.underline} specifically? [What may queer studies contribute to
Arctic studies]{.underline}? And [how do queer studies discuss with
Native or indigenous studies]{.underline}? When searching for academic
analyses on queer themes in the Arctic, one hardly finds an abundance of
publications as yet: some conference workshops focusing on queerness in
the North (e.g., Queering Indigeneity, 2018), a few journal articles and
book chapters on the topic (e.g., Huuki & Kyrölä, 2022; Kyrölä & Huuki,
2021; Peltomaa, 2012, 2013) and some academic theses (Løvold, 2014;
Peltomaa 2022). In the field of arts, there are some interesting
examples of exhibitions (Queering Sápmi 2019--2021) and documentary
filmmakers taking up queer sexualities among indigenous people (see
Kyrölä & Huuki, 2021). Nevertheless, [most of the burgeoning queer
Native studies have focused on the situation of the Native peoples and
settler colonialism in North America]{.underline}, although some queer
indigenous research has also been done in Australia. [The Arctic
non-Anglo settler colonialism needs to be analysed more, in dialogue
with existing Native and indigenous queer research.]{.underline}

When thinking about the notion of "queer in the Arctic", one is
immediately faced with critical questions: [How is queer intelligible as
a term in different Arctic societies and among different groups of
people living in the Arctic areas]{.underline}? [Are there other
terms]{.underline}, more pertinent, [used in the Arctic]{.underline}?
Unlike the term "queer", ["Arctic" has a rather well-defined and
well-understood referent;]{.underline} we can, for instance, use the
definition of the Arctic Human Development Report (2004, 17--18).
However, [there are multiple peoples or nations living in the
Arctic:]{.underline} the many different subgroups of Inuit in Alaska and
Greenland[;]{.underline} the different groups of Sámi in the Sápmi area
covering the northernmost parts of Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia;
small nations in the Arctic region of Russia (from Nenets to Yupiits);
and ethnic Norwegian, Finnish, Swedish and Russian people living in the
area and belonging to the majority nationalities (Jessen Williamson,
2011, 24--27). Obviously[, the differences in cultures, histories and
positions in terms of settler colonialism, as well as languages, also
cause differences in adaptation of the ideas and identities connected to
"queer"]{.underline}. What is more, [the term "settler colonialism"
receives different interpretations in different contexts depending on
whether it is used, for example, to refer to the colonization of
non-European areas by European imperial powers, colonial
complicity]{.underline} (Keskinen et al., 2009) [in the Nordic Arctic,
or the Israeli colonization of Palestine]{.underline}. However, [the
concept]{.underline} essentially [refers to occupation and assertion of
ownership over land and resources and to the hierarchical power
relationship between settlers and indigenous peoples]{.underline} (see,
e.g., Vowel, 2016, 16--17).

When talking about queer in the Arctic, [are we referring to
identitarian definitions of queer, that is, people identifying as
LGBTIQ2]{.underline}? In the English acronym LGBTIQ, the letter T (for
trans) includes non-binary. In other languages, there may be more
specific words for non-binary, as in Finnish for example, where the word
muunsukupuolinen literally means "otherwise gendered". [The acronym has
been updated in queer indigenous/Native studies to LGBTQ2 to include
Indigenous people who understand their genders and sexualities to be
outside heteropatriarchal Eurocentric constructions]{.underline} (see,
for example, Driskill et al., 2011). [How can indigenous ways of
identifying beyond the sexual and gender binaries contribute to queer
studies?]{.underline} Or[, if we talk instead about queering the Arctic,
what does that mean]{.underline}? [How do generational and geographical
differences affect understanding what is queer in the Arctic, or what
queer does in the Arctic]{.underline}? Can we argue that [having been
othered within the Western world, the Arctic as an area, with its
peoples, has been made strange by the settler colonial
powers]{.underline} in multiple ways? [It has been defined quite
stereotypically as a "harsh and unforgiving environment]{.underline}"
(Williamson, 2011, 45) and [an empty space void of people yet
fascinating and exotic]{.underline} (Hiltunen & Oisalo, 2020, 3); it has
also been described as the "North of the North", [an area of
contestation for rights and representation, and a strange, marginal
realm from the perspective of the "centers" further south]{.underline}
(Keskitalo-Foley & Naskali, 2013, 9). One may say that, in an
interestingly parallel way, [a struggle for rights and representation
has been a key area of queer politics]{.underline} since the days of ACT
UP and Queer Nation. [Queer political demands have also been shunned as
"peripheral" because of the "minority" status of non-heterosexuality and
people identifying as non-cis-gendered.]{.underline}

However, in the third millennium, [the Arctic has become a focus of
global politics and monetary interests]{.underline}, [as climate change
and the fact of the ice melting in the Northern seas have offered new
economical possibilities for trade and commercial exploitation of the
environment]{.underline} (Keskitalo-Foley & Naskali, 2013, 9). Even
[many of the audio-visual representations imaging the North and the
Sápmi have ignored the indigenous people living there and thereby
realized the "colonial mind", pushing aside the indigenous culture and
history]{.underline} (Hiltunen & Oisalo, 2020, 3). [If we draw a
parallel again to queer cultures,]{.underline} there is a growing media
attention focused on non-heterosexual representations, and [the concept
of the "pink pound" or "pink dollar" has been developed to describe the
economic effects of the intersection of gay (male) sexuality, whiteness
and the middle- or upper-middle-class subject positions]{.underline}
(Hall, 2003; Karkulehto, 2011). As a matter of fact, [the Pride parades
and carnivals, which have spread throughout Europe---including the
Arctic--- from their original site in the US, the northernmost Pride
events in Sápmi having taken place]{.underline} in Kautokeino in 2016
and in Inari in 2017, [have been criticized by some queer communities
precisely because of their commerciality]{.underline}, [and even
normativity]{.underline} (being geared towards couples, wedding
celebrations and families with kids) (Eng et al., 2005; Hall, 2003;
Rossi, 2017). Indeed, [where there used to exist "fear of a queer
planet"]{.underline} (Warner, 1993) or pervasive homophobia among the
heterosexual majority, [what one sees today is the lure of a queer
market]{.underline} and growing interest towards queer representations
in mainstream entertainment. [Many queer-identifying activists have
wanted to protect queer subversiveness and anti-normativity from
commercialism and heteronormative familism]{.underline}, [much like the
indigenous people in the Arctic want to protect their environment and
culture against contemporary ecological colonialism]{.underline}
(Keskitalo-Foley & Naskali, 2013, 9).

I will now provide some queer readings, or readings of chosen phenomena
that can be considered queer in contemporary Arctic cultures----or
practices and processes that can be thought of queering some
communities, histories or places in the Arctic. This will be done in
discussion with indigenous and queer scholars who have analysed
non-normative or non-binary genders and sexualities in the North.

Going Beneath and Beyond: Thinking Volumetrically

[In an era of abrupt and rapid climate change, cartographic
representations of the Polar Regions showing receding and diminishing
sea ice have become increasingly familiar]{.underline}. This visual
rendering and understanding of the planet's circumpolar places remains
focused on surfaces and outer layers, [with maps and other images
depicting the gradual loss of whiteness, the appearance of deep blue
ocean space, and the northwards movement of the tree line.]{.underline}
The Arctic Climate Impact Assessment is an example of just how powerful
surface imagery and the technologies of such production can be when they
are deployed to bring the Arctic into focus as a region undergoing
dramatic change. Indeed, ACIA underscores Jody Berland's point that [the
production of satellite images **'extends a history of landscape
depiction which prefers its nature at a distance\'**]{.underline}
(Berland 2009: 246). [In a series of high resolution colour maps,
satellite images and graphics]{.underline} in both the comprehensive
scientific assessment and the shorter distillation report of ACIA's key
findings, [we are invited to gaze like Apollo]{.underline} (Cosgrove
2001). From the top of the globe, [we look (with alarm) at declining
snow cover, the melt zone of the Greenland inland ice, changes in summer
sea ice extent, northern places splashed with **oranges and deep reds**
indicating rising temperatures, changes in the boundaries of
discontinuous permafrost, northwards shifts in the ranges of plant
animal species, alterations in atmospheric and oceanic circulation, sea
level rise, and incoming, diffused and reflected solar
radiation]{.underline} (ACIA 2004, 2005). This a view from high above of
a changing Arctic [represented by lines, colours and
arrows]{.underline}. [The region is visualized through the products
of]{.underline} **[technologies of affect. It is
intoxicating.]{.underline}**

[Despite the best attempts of social scientists involved in ACIA to draw
attention to the realities and lived experience of climate change for
the people of the circumpolar North]{.underline} (e.g. Huntington and
Fox 2005; Nuttall et al. 2005), [the maps and graphics convey distance
and detachment and give us no idea about the complexity and richness of
human---environment relations, **which is all the more curious given the
seriousness of the melting and warming Arctic and the impacts on
environment and society they aim to say something about**.]{.underline}
[The projected loss of perennial sea ice in the Arctic
Ocean]{.underline}, for example, [is represented in ways that imagine
northern waters]{.underline} in a climate changed Arctic [as
increasingly blue rather than white spaces on the map, devoid of ice and
transected by lines indicating transpolar shipping routes]{.underline}.
[It is a tantalizing glimpse of]{.underline} open water and [the
possibility of shorter sailing distances between Europe, North America
and Asia]{.underline} rather than a view from the bridge of a ship
navigating through northern waterways that will still be filled with ice
regardless of the extent of summer melt. [When ACIA\'s key findings were
first released, they pointed to scenarios of possible environmental
catastrophe; now, open polar seas hint at the Arctic\'s economic
potential. This is reinforced through maps and graphics that attempt to
make the rhetoric of anticipation legible]{.underline}. As Berland
(2009: 247) puts it, **['maps constitute a visual index of traversable
space which is pragmatically linked to the anticipated exigencies of
unaccustomed, uncharted, or unfriendly movement\'.]{.underline}**

[When maps of a changing Arctic do try to point to what is below the
surface, they tend to mark]{.underline} [the location, or the
possibility for discovery, of oil, gas and other minerals.]{.underline}
[Ocean structures such as the Lomonosov Ridge become
emboldened]{.underline} as and [when they are connected to]{.underline}
possible [continental shelf claims]{.underline}. While they hint at
complexity, [they]{.underline} also [reinforce a geopolitics of the
surface and indicate what resources could be extracted, rather than an
appreciation of the stratigraphies and structures of what is
within]{.underline}, below and underneath. [They also underplay earthly
forces; the manner in which ice, snow, water pressure, atmospheric
turbulence, cloud cover, seismic activity and the like have an agency
that]{.underline} enables, [slows down, frustrates and even prevents
human activities]{.underline} and encounters. [Countless
explorers]{.underline}, [scientists, pilots and miners have
found]{.underline} to their cost [how polar environments can abuse,
confuse and refuse human interventions. Maps of the Arctic
Ocean]{.underline} and the Southern Ocean [rarely succeed in capturing
how little we really understand of these]{.underline} watery
[environments]{.underline}.

> it**]{.underline}. It is nevertheless [the map that precedes the
> territory]{.underline} -- precession of simulacra -- that engenders
> the territory. (Baudrillard Citation1995, 1)

[Baudrillard's theory]{.underline} of the precession of simulacra that
engenders the territory [highlights Said's notions of geography as a
colonial construct.]{.underline} [Cartography, one of the key concepts
in postcolonial studies, constitutes a significant part of Arctic and
African colonial narratives. Imperial powers have shown great interest
in cartography and charting maps as **manifestations of domination** and
material gain]{.underline}. The [imperial enterprise portrays maps as
parchments with vacant spaces awaiting a **glorious imperial
flag**]{.underline} to give them meaning, identity, and culture.
Canadian and British fiction frequently features maps with several
goals. According to Graham Huggan (Citation1994), featuring maps in
Canadian literature shows the close relationship between historical
development and geographical discovery and allows writers to come to
terms with and celebrate the rediscovery of their country. Maps, seen by
Huggan as a product and a process, because [the map "does not restrict
itself to the decoding of the model, but also involves itself in the
further recoding of the modelling system"]{.underline} (4), are
reflected in Elce and Conrad's texts in nearly identical ways. In one of
the letters imagined by Elce, Jane Franklin starts recollecting her
memories with her husband, mentioning their "old map of London"
(Elce Citation2018, 29) and reminiscing about how they drew the lines of
their travels, with the "routes in and out of the city almost soaked
through with ink" (29). Lady Franklin's use of the map as a compass for
her memories and the couple's sense of geographical imperative is
indicative of imperial ontology. Their map, in this case, is reflective
of what Huggan calls [the "dialectic between the formulation of the map,
during which the real world is concentrated in model form, and the
implementation of the map, during which the model is tested against
reality"]{.underline} (Citation1994, 4). Lady Franklin's and her
husband's act of tracing their travels reflects the process of testing
the map's abstract model against their lived experiences. The ink-soaked
routes symbolize how their personal memories and physical journeys are
inscribed onto the map, transforming it from a mere representation of
London into a record of their experiences, thus highlighting the
relationship between the conceptual model of the map and its real-world
application. [Similarly, the imperial venture of finding the Northwest
Passage was all about geography,]{.underline} although John Franklin's
map towards the Northwest Passage represented a model that could not be
implemented when tested against reality.

From a [Western point of view, land stops where the sea
starts]{.underline}. [Maps create a clear visual differentiation between
land and water]{.underline}. [Bodies of water]{.underline} also
[have]{.underline} [a specific status in the eyes of the
law]{.underline}, and [seashores are particularly
significant,]{.underline} serving as precise borders surrounding states
(and mitigated by maritime law, which applies differently). In that
sense, [the Western meaning of 'territory' implies 'land']{.underline}.
[For Inuit]{.underline}, this [notion does not make sense seeing as the
territory does not stop at the shores, which are difficult to spot in
cold weather as they are extended by the ice that forms along
them]{.underline}. This is why [hunting and habitat are not based on a
clear distinction between terrestrial and maritime
behaviours]{.underline} (Collignon 1996, 100). This [connection of the
land to the frozen sea creates a world order based on surfaces rather
than on abstract directional concepts]{.underline} such as the North.
Moreover, [the intimate knowledge of the land is not an]{.underline}
[abstraction; it is the result of cumulative experience]{.underline} --
hunting, gathering, movement, and displacement -- shaping a [network of
lines connecting temporal notions]{.underline} with territorial ones,
[an 'axial perception' that 'is clearly expressed in the maps drawn by
Inuit in response to explorers' requests']{.underline} (1996, 98). These
[perceptions of space are based on a system of signs wherein language
plays a decisive role]{.underline}. Any contemporary Indigenous setting
is a bilingual one where one (Indigenous) language competes with one or
several dominant languages (Russian, English, French, Norwegian, or
Danish, for instance). So[, to create a map with Inuit knowledge of the
territory, it does not suffice to replace a language with
another]{.underline}; their [worldview must be translated, often
awkwardly, with words that necessarily displace meanings]{.underline}.
[Western temporal, legal, and philosophical systems, and the
corresponding ways of orienting oneself on the land, relating to it, and
organising it as a society]{.underline}, a[re either imposed on the
Inuit system or considered in relation to it, both of which lead to the
introduction of new concepts, translated or not, that destabilise Inuit
ways of thinking.]{.underline} Therefore, the [North becomes rooted as a
concept while nuna, which previously referred for the Inuit to the world
where people live, becomes an Inuit concept meaning North as it now
refers to Inuit territories]{.underline} (Nunavik, Nunatsiavut, Nunavut,
etc.). The [knowledge of space depends on an understanding of Inuktitut
as well as of its relationships to other languages, which in turn
transform its meaning]{.underline} (cf. Collignon 1996, 197). [To orient
oneself in the Arctic]{.underline}, [one must have a sophisticated
understanding of the environment]{.underline}. [For the Sámi and the
Inuit alike]{.underline}, [this is a matter of life or
death]{.underline} for herders, hunters, and fishermen, particularly
[when it comes to finding food and shelter]{.underline} from the cold
and the wind. [Inuit cartography thus unsurprisingly favours resources,
itineraries, previous experiences, as well as potential obstacles to
survival rather than abstract depictions]{.underline}. Inuit have been
[sharing this knowledge among themselves for millennia,]{.underline} as
McGrath writes: Inuit have a long history of map- making. For thousands
of years [they shared their knowledge of the country]{.underline} with
one another by creating [representations of areas, either visited or
known indirectly, by drawing and building outlines on sand or snow,
using rocks, bones and sticks to give a three- dimensional quality to
their images.]{.underline} (1988, 6)

Elce's portrayal of Lady Franklin continues to demonstrate the focal
position of maps for the imperial citizen; throughout her decade-long
search for her lost husband's expedition, the fictionalized Lady
Franklin has examined her maps so well that she feels that Captain
Hamilton "had overstepped personal decorum when his finger traced the
same line \[that hers\] had so many times" (Elce Citation2018, 34). Lady
Franklin's reliance on maps during her search for her husband's
expedition further underscores the political authority of maps as
representations of power. Nonetheless, [the over-reliance on
maps]{.underline}, as Baudrillard suggests, [leads to "substituting the
signs of the real for the real]{.underline}" (Citation1995, 2), meaning
that [the map becomes more important than the reality it represents. In
the context of colonial critique]{.underline}, [this]{.underline} does
not just involve creating a fictional version of reality, but it [also
represents the danger of explorers becoming overly dependent on these
abstract representations]{.underline}. This [over-reliance can lead to
loss or failure when explorers are misled or overwhelmed by the
**authority of the map**]{.underline} itself, [rather than engaging with
the actual terrain]{.underline}, thus [illustrating how the map's
symbolic power can lead to **real-world defeat**.]{.underline}

In addition to the use of maps as signs of the real, maps are used in
both texts as analytical tools in the journey to find Kutz or in
searching for the lost expedition. Nonetheless, [the tools, just another
dialectic themselves, become the cause of being lost]{.underline},
metaphorically and literally. Sir John Franklin's inability to overpower
the map by reaching the Northwest Passage is similar to Kurtz's failure
to "penetrate" the heart of Africa as he succumbs to the forest's
darkness. Similarly, with the passage of time and the numerous campaigns
launched to find Sir John Franklin and the Northwest Passage, Lady
Franklin's maps stop operating as simulacra, giving way to realistic
referentiality, which unravels the truth behind imperial explorations
and the impossibility of locating her husband beyond the signs of the
map.

> (Baudrillard Citation1995, 120; emphasis in original)

[Baudrillard's concept of the "loss of the terrestrial referential"
speaks to the diminishing connection between symbols (maps,
representations, or models) and the real-world spaces they are meant to
represent.]{.underline} This idea is [rooted in Baudrillard's broader
theory of simulation and hyperreality, where the distinction between the
real and the simulated becomes **increasingly blurred** until
the]{.underline} simulated (the [map]{.underline} or model) effectively
[**becomes the real** in our perceptions and interactions]{.underline}.
The confusion paradoxically leads to Kurtz succumbing to his nihilism,
enslaving the Congolese and establishing his own imaginary kingdom.
However, it is also the loss of terrestrial referential that leads
Marlow to a realization of the ugly face of imperialism. Hence, maps in
Elce's and Conrad's texts can be seen as models of reality in which the
imperial imaginations of the two protagonists are countered. In both
cases, [maps **preceded reality** in a Baudrillardian sense before
disillusionment started.]{.underline}

On the domestic American political side, [the experience of two world

[A region like the Arctic]{.underline}, argues Geir Hønneland (2017, p.
31), [is not a predetermined territory, but made in text and speech as
it is always possible to find supporting arguments for a geographical
area to constitute a 'natural' unit]{.underline}. [Thus, maps can be
viewed as part of the **discursive construction** of the Arctic as a
region,]{.underline} which Albert and Vasilache (2018) argue is based on
a mixture of actors, knowledges and representations that (re)define and
(re)constructs the region into what it is understood as. Similarly,
Karen Culcasi (2010) considers maps to be central in constructing 'the
Middle East' as a particular 'world-region'. Therefore[, I find maps to
be central knowledges and representations that define and construct the
Arctic 'world-region'. Where it is, what it is, what should happen
next:]{.underline} [these questions are full of power-knowledge
problematisations which are expressed and reproduced in
maps.]{.underline} However, to gain access to the underlying assumptions
about the Arctic and to understand the kind of place the Arctic has
become (and is becoming) requires us to examine how the [maps themselves
problematise Arctic issues and developments]{.underline}. [Contrary to
authors who emphasise the ways in which geography influences Arctic
politics, for example by exploring how melting sea ice impacts on the
prospects of the Arctic coastal states]{.underline} (cf. Wegge and Keil
2018), [I argue that such **changes and problematisations are not given,
but often constructed and mediated in maps**. A key contention of this
thesis is indeed that maps influence politics by projecting certain
assumptions about the geographical areas and issues in
question]{.underline}.

[To illustrate how particular problematisations about the Arctic are
being (re)produced and sustained via the use of maps, I point to two
articles]{.underline} by Scott Borgerson (2008, 2013) in the journal
Foreign Affairs. In "Arctic Meltdown", [Borgerson]{.underline} ([2008)
displays two maps showing the extent of Arctic sea ice. One map depicts
ice coverage in September 2001 and the other map depicts the decrease of
ice coverage as of September 2007.]{.underline} [After establishing the
sea ice changes, there is a map showing 'Arctic Energy Resources', and
later, also two maps illustrating 'Arctic Shipping
Shortcuts']{.underline}. However, none of these three maps show signs of
sea ice in the Arctic Ocean. Moreover, [in the largely realist
Borgerson's article from 2013]{.underline}, "The Coming Arctic Boom",
[the first sentence identifies one of the issues: "The ice was never
supposed to melt this quickly"]{.underline} (2013, p. 76). [Later, there
is a map showing 'Economic Opportunity in the Arctic'. This map includes
shaded areas marking the probabilities of oil, a line marking the extent
of Arctic sea ice extent in September 2012, and an arrow running across
the ocean, named the Northern Sea Route]{.underline} 33 (Borgerson 2013,
p. 83). [He concludes that it is only a matter of time before the summer
sea ice is gone and the Arctic opens up to extensive development, "with
enormous benefits for both outsiders and the inhabitants of this prime
real estate]{.underline}" (Borgerson 2013, p. 89). **[This
conclusion]{.underline}**, I argue, [**is being substantiated through
the use of maps**, for example, by not showing any sea ice on the map as
a way to reveal economic opportunities.]{.underline} [Moreover, the maps
displayed in both the articles are familiar to people engaged in Arctic
issues and emerge from renowned mapping agencies,]{.underline} such as
the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) and the United States
Geological Survey (USGS) -- whose maps that I analyse in Chapters 5 and
6. [Due to their circulation and authority, these maps often go
unquestioned in Arctic debates, reproducing dominant ideas about there
being 'challenges']{.underline} [(ice melting), but also 'opportunities'
(undiscovered petroleum) in the area.]{.underline} Hence, I find it
important to understand how maps become part of such discourses
surrounding 'challenges' and 'opportunities' in the Arctic, but more
importantly how they give way to particular visions and certain actors,
while silencing others luence politics by projecting certain assumptions
about the geographical areas and issues in question.

In this context, [it is interesting to observe that
Borgerson]{.underline} (2013) [sketches out a kind of 'win-win' scenario
for the future of the Arctic and uses many maps to illustrate this
point]{.underline}. [He uses the maps as a convincing, seemingly neutral
background against which his key arguments are articulated]{.underline}.
However, I will argue that instead of being neutral background
information figuring in a journal article, a scientific study, or a book
about the Arctic, these maps in themselves can be the subject of a study
about the Arctic. [Such **maps do not simply mirror reality, but form
our conception of what that reality entails**]{.underline}. [Equally
important is the ability of **maps to shape debates and visions about
the future of the Arctic**]{.underline}. In what follows below I will
explain the contributions made in the thesis.

Arctic geopolitics and metageographies of the Arctic

[The manner in which the world is divided into spatial
categories]{.underline} such as area, continent, and region [is rarely
innocent]{.underline} and certainly never devoid of legal and political
circumstance. Geopolitics has at its heart a preoccupation with the
politics of representing space. For the last 30 years, scholars have
thought of geopolitics as capable of being distinguished between formal,
practical, and popular forms of geopolitics. These are defined as the
work done by universities and think tanks, political leaders and agents
of the state, and mass media and public opinion, respectively.
Geopolitics, under this conceptual rubric, is not simply something
created by academic thinkers in either university or think tank
environments. Instead, [geopolitics is best thought of as something more
fluid, multilocational, and interlocked with practical and popular
elements]{.underline}. As an example, a political leader such as US
President Donald Trump might articulate a plan to build a border wall
(practical), the media might cover that story (popular), and analysts
might thereafter analyze and speculate on the rationale and underlying
logic for wall building (formal). Geopolitics is produced by wider
geopolitical cultures. [To speak of a]{.underline} Norwegian
[geopolitical culture]{.underline}, for example, [would be to identify
how the country's role, identity, and mission in the world are
conceptualized]{.underline} (Medby 2018). For example, one striking
feature of contemporary Norwegian geopolitical culture is the emphasis
placed on the High North. The foreword of Norway's Arctic Strategy,
titled "Between geopolitics and social development" (2017) notes: The
Arctic is important for Norway and for the world as a whole. Foreign and
domestic policies are intertwined in the region, and people's everyday
lives are affected both by high politics and by day-to-day issues. Here,
people are not divided by the ice, but rather joined by the ocean. In
the Arctic, our most important foreign policy priority, countries from
three continents have found new ways of cooperating, based on common
interests and respect for international law. [Popular geopolitical
imaginaries matter because of their framing capacity]{.underline}
(Dittmer et al. 2011). [The Arctic as a space is not preformed but is
subject to intervention, representation, and reproduction through
particular institutional and stakeholder organizations.]{.underline} For
example, [public education is an important element in the socialization
of Arcticness. Schools, media, and public information campaigns, often
using maps and charts, help to articulate what might be integral to the
Norwegian High North.]{.underline} As a geographical region, the High
North as a Norwegian geopolitical culture is a region stretching from
Greenland to the western margins of Russia, encompassing northern Norway
and the archipelago of Svalbard (Keskitalo 2004). This geopolitical
thinking is not unique to Norway. [The eight Arctic states]{.underline}
of Canada, Denmark (Greenland), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia,
Sweden, and the United States [are active producers of Arctic
identities, including geographical representations of the Arctic as a
region.]{.underline} Using lines of latitude, such as the Arctic Circle
or 60 degrees North, or simply the boundary lines of a northern state
such as Alaska, Arctic imaginaries have been grounded in cartographic
coordinates and geographical locations. [They have been supplemented,
however, by other cultural and economic factors and forces such as the
presence of Indigenous and northern communities, resource projects, and
military investment in "northern commands" and Arctic
forces]{.underline}. Every Arctic state has its own distinctive
investment, imaginative and material, in this Arctic-building process.
There is no single Arctic state identity (Medby 2018). [Building and
sustaining a distinct "Arcticness" is an ongoing project; one that is
not under the control of any one particular actor or stakeholder. Arctic
states are powerful producers]{.underline} and circulators [of popular
geographical imaginaries, but they are not alone.]{.underline} At the
height of the British Empire, 18th- and 19th-century British sailors,
explorers, and traders, alongside artists and novelists, were actively
engaged in harvesting stories, images and objects of and from the Arctic
North (Depledge 2017). There is a long history and geography to how the
Arctic as a transnational space (rather than formed regions) attracted
imaginative and material investment. [For British expeditioners and
travelers in the 19th century, the Arctic was **something to pass
through:** a passage onto other trading and cultural
worlds]{.underline}. There was nothing discrete about the Arctic per se.
[It was a space]{.underline}, both terrestrial and maritime, [that was
poorly mapped, defined, and understood]{.underline}. There was little
appreciation that Indigenous communities were resident, and in part that
ignorance was indicative of the fact that these expeditions were
traveling by ship in some of the remotest parts of the now North
American Arctic. [In the 20th century, the Arctic attracted not only the
attention of Arctic states seeking to integrate northern homelands into
their national boundaries through assimilation, infrastructural
investment, and militarization, but also interest in projecting further
northwards]{.underline}. In Canada and Russia from the 1920s onwards,
[military and political actors looked further north and imagined their
countries projecting]{.underline} sector-like [towards the North
Pole.]{.underline} Using lines of longitude, governments on either side
of the Arctic Ocean began to stretch their national ambitions ever
northwards. Most notably, the Soviet Union sent ships, planes, and men
northwards. Taming Arctic nature, conquering Arctic sea ice, and
establishing infrastructure on permafrost and tundra became a leitmotif
of Stalin's Soviet Union (Rowe and Blakkisrud 2014). Arctic geopolitical
ambition was hardened further by the experiences of war: imagined and
real. [World War II transformed the Arctic as an active wartime theater.
Alaska, Russia, Northern Norway, and Svalbard witnessed German,
Japanese, and Allied forces in action.]{.underline} Atlantic convoys
traveled back and forth from the North Atlantic and the Barents Sea.
[Infrastructure was extended northwards, connecting the territory of
Alaska to the southern provinces of Canada and the continental United
States.]{.underline} [The northern territories of Arctic states became
ever-more connected]{.underline} to their southern constituencies
[through airports, sea lanes, lines of communication, and media
stories]{.underline} about why they mattered to the war effort. [New
maps were produced]{.underline} in American newspapers, [which
championed a polar projection so that readers could better understand
how Alaska was tied to Pacific Ocean military operations
against]{.underline} [the Japanese]{.underline} imperial forces. Wartime
investment and experiences of conflict in the high latitudes fueled Cold
War scenarios of potential future conflict. Superpower enmity involving
the United States and the Soviet Union and their respective allies
radiated across the northern hemisphere. [Yet, strategies took on a
particular imaginative purchase in the Arctic. Precisely because the
Arctic was imagined to be a barren wasteland with few settled
communities, it became a productive space to fantasize about what might
occur. Both the United States and the Soviet Union invested more in
academic disciplines such as glaciology and oceanography as they
recognized that they needed to better understand northern
environments]{.underline}, both on land and at sea. [Infrastructure such
as the]{.underline} Distant Early Warning ([DEW]{.underline})
[system]{.underline}, built in themid- to late 1950s, was [intended to
provide an electronic "tripwire" in the event of a possible sneak Soviet
bomber attack over the]{.underline} frozen Arctic [Ocean]{.underline}.
Stretching from Alaska and Canada to Greenland and Iceland, [the DEW was
one of the most iconic manifestations of Cold War militarism. For
millions of American citizens, the North was defined by images of
isolated radar stations immersed in a wintery environment]{.underline}
(Farish 2010). However, Cold War militarism also had a biopolitical
element as well (Albert and Vasilache 2018). If the United States and
the Soviet Union were motivated by geopolitical rationales pertaining to
the control and surveillance of their respective northern territories,
they were also concerned with the regulation and control of communities
and populations. As Michel Foucault (2008) noted, with the development
of the modern nation-state biopolitics and geopolitics became
co-constitutive of one another[. Regulating territory and people in the
Arctic North was a multifaceted affair, from relocating Indigenous
communities to areas of strategic significance and forced assimilation
to the development of prison systems]{.underline} (i.e. gulags in the
Soviet Union), an[d resource--industrial development projects, which
necessitated the movement of non-Indigenous people into new mining
projects and resource cities across the Arctic.]{.underline} Military
bases and associated land, sea, and aerial patrolling also carried with
them particular costs to both native communities and local ecosystems,
[notably in places such as Thule]{.underline} in northwest Greenland.
[Thule]{.underline}, an American air station established in the early to
mid-1950s, [led to community displacement and the establishment of
exclusion zones. As with the Soviet Union, large areas of the Arctic
became]{.underline}, in effect, clo[sed spaces where human mobility was
strictly regulated.]{.underline} When speaking of geopolitical cultures
in the way that political geographers assert, attention is drawn to how
states in particular imagine the world, spatialize it, and link it to
economic, political, and cultural projects, including identity politics,
knowledge, resource extraction, and physical security (Dodds and Nuttall
2016). [To speak of the]{.underline} Canadian [Arctic]{.underline}, the
High North, and/or the Russian Arctic [is to enter into a contested and
complex imaginative terrain and material space that bares the traces of
colonial, Cold War, and transnational histories of encounter and
exchange.]{.underline} Nationalist myths and stereotypes on the one hand
coexist with biopolitical and geopolitical interventions on the other.
[There is no one Arctic per se, but tracing multiple Arctic(s) is not a
straightforward process or practice either, despite what might be
suggested by maps.]{.underline} In 2007, stories and images circulated
of a Russian flag being planted on the bottom of the central Arctic
Ocean. News organizations were swift to pronounce the ideological and
visual significance of the event. Headlines such as "Scramble for the
Arctic" were rolled out, as commentators warned that Russia was
hell-bent on spatial expansionism and the domination of Arctic place
(Dodds 2010; Dittmer et al. 2011). While the provenance of the
flag-planting was rather more complicated than social media and
headlines might attest, [it unleashed an affective geopolitics of fear:
a type of geopolitics that triggers forceful sentiment and feelings,
which appear to supersede discourses and practices of legal and
political governance. Emotions circulate, jeremiads are produced, and
calls for action are issued.]{.underline} Canadian political leaders
reassured the public that their sovereignty in the Arctic would not be
imperiled. Other countries unfolded new Arctic strategies, and resource
companies, Indigenous organizations, and nongovernmental organizations
also released their own visions for a future Arctic. [What the
flag-planting incident revealed is how febrile geographical imaginaries
and practices remain.]{.underline} [The planting]{.underline} of a
Russian flag (as opposed to a Canadian, Norwegian or even UN flag)
[carried with it a particular sort of affective geopolitics]{.underline}
in Europe and North America. [It recalled not only past imperial
practices such as the scramble for and colonizing of
territories]{.underline} in Africa, Asia, and the Americas, [but also
touched upon contemporary anxieties that Russia had embarked on a new
project under]{.underline} President [Putin to recover its great-power
status]{.underline}. If the Chinese flag had been deposited alongside
the Russian one, then that might also have triggered a fresh round of
concern about China's great-power pretensions in the international
waters of the central Arctic Ocean. [The flag as a material object
exemplifies that geopolitics is more than simply language and
representation.]{.underline} [The Russian flag was]{.underline} made of
titanium and considered [rust- proof]{.underline}, thus [hinting at a
quasi-permanence.]{.underline} What made the flag-planting incident in
2007 even more visceral was that it coincided with a record low for
Arctic sea ice. For many commentators, [the Arctic appeared to be
"opening up" and thus inviting more geopolitics: more flag-planting,
more resource extraction, more transiting, and more strategic scrambling
for comparative advantage]{.underline}. In this articulation[, Arctic
geopolitics is better thought of as an unstable assemblage of discourse,
practice, performance, and affect]{.underline}. **[It is more than
simply visual and cartographic]{.underline}**. [While maps and
media]{.underline} such as film [contribute to popular geopolitics of
the Arctic, helping to identify, represent, and dramatize the
coordinates]{.underline} and configurations of space, [these are not
sufficient]{.underline}. [Arctic geopolitics **is not reducible** to
frames such as "Scramble for the Arctic" or "A return to the Cold War,"
however]{.underline} [popular]{.underline} and resilient [they might
be]{.underline}. Arctic geopolitics comes in many shapes and sizes (for
example, Tamnes and Offerdal 2014). It is integral to the everyday lives
of northern residents, it is performed in an array of sites and spaces
in northern and non-northern locations (which in itself might be
contested), and it is animated and inflamed by affective atmospheres.
National leaders demand action in the Arctic; popular media warns of
others trespassing in their airspace, seascape, and landscape; and
Indigenous and northern communities and organizations articulate their
own demands and wishes for past, present, and future Arctic(s). Hope,
fear, dread, resentment, and the like all play their part in making
Arctic geopolitics affective, emotive, more than representational, and
corporeal (on affective geopolitics, see Toal 2017).

#### Cartographic Truth Claiming results from the constitutive power of maps;

**Lindberg 19'** Helena Gonzales Lindberg (Ph.D) has an
interdisciplinary educational and research background within geography,
political science and environmental science. *The constitutive power of
maps in the Arctic*, pg. 59 - 60, Lund University, 2019,
<https://lucris.lub.lu.se/ws/portalfiles/portal/70153744/Lindberg_The_constitutive_power_of_maps_in_the_Arctic_2019.pdf>
{gs}

The concept of cartographic truth-claiming is closely related to the
critique presented above about the critical cartography field. Namely,
[maps not only mirror 'reality' but also represent it in particular
ways, producing 'truth effects']{.underline} (Harley 1988a). According
to David Turnbull (1989), [maps seemingly become evidence of reality in
themselves since they can introduce modes of control and manipulation
that might not be possible without the maps; that is, they **give us a
view of the world that is difficult to achieve in other
ways**]{.underline}. This is where [the visual elements of the map
become central: the 'truth' of what is represented in the map is
assisted by the map's visual representation in which maps are perceived
as mirroring the 'real']{.underline}. Like photographs, [people may be
drawn in by the "seductiveness of the real" to the point that it is
forgotten that someone made the map from a particular
perspective]{.underline} (Perlmutter 1998 in Bleiker 2018, p. 13). [This
seductiveness helps establish 'truths' about the aspects of the world
that a map represents,]{.underline} especially in maps that combine
graphics with aerial photographs and satellite imagery. [An example of
cartographic truth-claiming is how many world maps is unproblematically
represent oceans as blue, establishing the 'truth' about the colour of
water being blue and that all oceans of the world are identical without
any local or regional variabilities]{.underline}. I return to in Chapter
4 when I scrutinise the visual representation in Google Maps.

Furthermore, like other representations, [maps can be seen as products
of knowledge as well as producing knowledges and 'truths' about the
world]{.underline} (Shapiro 1988). [These truth-claims refer to "what is
'in the true'- what is accepted as truth]{.underline}" (Bacchi and
Goodwin 2016, p. 35). [Features such as geological layers, climate
systems, or potential new sea routes would all be very difficult to
imagine as being 'true' without being creatively mediated through
maps.]{.underline} **[This is part of a map's ability to make meaning
and constitute power]{.underline}**. Moreover, [their visual expression
makes maps easily assimilated into discourses of knowledge and truth
because they often are perceived to be what Shapiro calls "**an
unmediated simulacrum, a copy of what we consider the
'real'**]{.underline}" (1988, p. 124). In this way[, maps mediate
'reality' not merely as descriptions of a world of facticity, but as
ways of making this facticity]{.underline} (Shapiro 1988). For [example,
maps can make claims about dynamic elements in nature being static and
as such make it a 'fact' that something like a measurable 'ice edge'
exists]{.underline}, which I will discuss further in Chapter 5 where I
look at a map showing a clearly defined mass of Arctic sea ice. In my
empirical analysis, the cartographic truth-claiming pertains to how the
maps that I analyse make truth-claims about 'the Arctic' and constitute
what the main 'problems' or 'issues' in this context are. Furthermore,
the truthclaiming lays the foundation of how elements in the map can be
naturalised as 'facts', which I address below

#### Ethical scholars must refuse to participate in the construction of colonial narratives or endorse colonial policies

Sciences, King\'s College London, London, UK) \" Accounting for colonial
complicities through Refusals in researching agency across borders,\"
Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues,
https://doi.org/10.1111/josi.12473, 8-22-2021\]

[We must remain inquisitively expectant of the blindspots that are
intrinsic to our enduring complicities in whiteness as a
\[neo-\]colonising system of power]{.underline}. As emphasized by Fanon
(1952/2008), [white people and researchers operating in white knowledge
systems, need to cultivate an "attitude," "which is profoundly
epistemological, as well as ethical, political, and
aesthetic]{.underline}\... \[requiring\] that the [subjects of knowledge
question themselves,]{.underline} not about the humanity of others, but
[about the extent to which they are expressing their own humanity \[by
actively countering the continued dehumanisations of people living in
precarious conditions\]]{.underline}" (Maldonado-Torres, 2017, p.
439---emphasis added). [This requires "epistemic modesty"
(]{.underline}Teo, 2019); a value that [means being "aware of one's own
horizon, the strengths and limitations of one's own
approach]{.underline}, [while being knowledgeable about the history,
sociality, and culturality of knowledge."]{.underline} (p. 40).
Developing such an attitude and value depends on us recognizing our
entanglements with the world around us, which also demands that we move
beyond human-centered notions of agency. Singh (2018) locates the
decolonial project in a dehumanist (but importantly, not disembodied)
understanding of agency, viewed through our ''non-masterful
entanglements" with other humans, animals, and the environment; a
practice and a "promise of vulnerability" that remakes the human "from
its outside," from the standpoint of those who have been dehumanized.
[For white people this "remaking" affords an opportunity for the
co-construction of a new positionality, beyond Western binary, fixed,
categorical thinking---a "third space"---that is "guided by" Black,
Indigenous, and people of color knowledges, where we are neither "enemy
or ally," but rather a "concrete subject of struggle"]{.underline}
(Leonardo, 2009, p. 186). Puig de la Bellacasa (2017) recognizes this
reciprocity within more-than-human worlds "through a collective web of
obligations, rather than individual commitments\... \[exposing\] the
multilateral circulation of agencies of care\... \[that\] follows the
requirement of looking at the specificity of moments, particular
relations, of ecologies where the ethical is both personal agency and
embedded in the 'ethos' of a community of living\... \[focussed on the\]
doings and undoings of the ethical embedded in technoscientific
assemblages and naturecultures" (p. 120; 151). Specifically in regard to
universities, paperson (2017) identifies us as "scyborgs" (drawing on
Haraway's concept of the cyborg) that spring from the colonizing
technological assemblage of the university: "The agency of the scyborg
is precisely that it is a reorganizer of institutional machinery; it
subverts machinery against the master code of its makers; it rewires
machinery to its own intentions (p. 55) \... Your agential capacity
extends beyond your being, into the system's capacity. Your agency is a
system. This is why I put the s in front of the cyborg" (p. 61).
Accordingly, s-he argues, [there is no utopian decolonized university
but there are opportunities for operating as a decolonizing university
through the subversive scyborgian acts of reassemblage]{.underline}
(paperson, 2017). So what does this mean practically for white people
and those of us connected to whiteness in the neoliberal academy? At the
most basic level, [cultivating this "attitude" and the post-/dehumanist
understanding of agency that underpins it, means recognizing that our
decolonizing potentials are contingent on the ways in which we maintain
our relationships with "the outside." In decolonial and Indigenous
literatures this is described as "relational accountability," which
calls on us to be responsible and locate ourselves (and our theories)
within the political and violent histories which continue to structure
sites of oppression in our societies today]{.underline} (Chilisa, 2020;
Dei & Asgharzadeh, 2001; Naylor et al., 2018). Therefore in reading
about the subjectivities, ontologies, and epistemologies of Others, this
implicates the importance of holding "proximity and distance together"
in such encounters (Ahmed, 2000). In explanation, Ahmed (2000), drawing
on Levinas, likens an ethical interaction to a caress, as opposed to a
grasp, shake, beating, or withdrawal, reflected through a respect of the
"boundary lines that have already been drawn as markers not only of
territory, but of power" (p. 156--157). For example, in the case of
paperson's (2017) scyborg, she locates the reassembling potentials of
the scyborg in desire; how "you, as scyborg might use these
\[colonising\] technologies to bend the fabric of power to suit your
decolonial desires" (p. 59). However, [for those of us who move
relatively easily through the unmarked whiteness of Western academia, we
must question whether we can ever fully trust our own decolonial
desires]{.underline}? As scyborgs who do not feel \[ever nearly as
strongly\] the friction and violence of colonial technologies on our
bodies, it is crucial that we recognize our difference. Namely, that [we
understand the importance of formulating our decolonial desires in more
"co-conspiratorial" ways]{.underline} (Love, 2019), taking care to
[ensure that our \[removals from\] action align with broader decolonial
and social justice strategizing]{.underline}. It is for this reason that
I would never describe myself as a decolonial or anti-colonial scholar;
I recognize that in order to work in anti-colonial ways I must think
with Others (through interdisciplinary readings and real interactions)
about how and when I take-up and deoccupy space. [Refusals are integral
to this. They are about our responsibilities as scholars, practitioners,
and activists in needing to be explicit about how we are engaging with
the knowledge of Others in our attempts to manage and remain accountable
for our continued complicities in oppressive structures and forces.
Refusals demand that we go beyond the "self-deceiving]{.underline}"
(Maldonado-Torres, 2017) [practices of some reflexive accounts, in which
"privileges" are named only in relation to how they were \[supposedly\]
mitigated]{.underline}. Refusals call for the telling of 'involved
stories' (Puig de la Bellacasa, 2017) in which the complexities of our
relationships with the worlds that we research and work with, are
acknowledged through remaining "openly moved by a commitment to treat
the emerging issues as a matter of care\... \[providing accounts that
are\] neither theoretical nor descriptive, \[and\] open to alternative
readings, yet situated" (p. 22). This connects with Tuck and Yang's
(2014) identification of refusals "as a way of thinking about humanizing
researchers" (p. 223), and too, with Fanon's (1952/2008) emphasis on the
importance of narrative and description as a means of disrupting the
coloniality of the scientific method (Maldonado-Torres, 2017). [Refusals
therefore provide an opening for white scholars, practitioners, and
activists, and all of us connected to whiteness, to contribute to the
telling of stories and assembling of practices around and outside of the
"sameness"]{.underline} (Essed & Goldberg, 2002) [and
"mastery]{.underline}" (Singh, 2018) [that is actively cultured in
academia.]{.underline} By the very nature of complicities, and also the
long arc of collaborative change[, the stories of our refusals will
remain imperfect, undone, and particular to each own's
situation]{.underline}. In my current situation, working on a fixed-term
postdoctoral research contract, I am not always able to set limits on
the work that I do. I raise the issue of complicities, open-up
dialogues, and take a stand when I can, but also sometimes I don't have
the energy, opportunity (because of pressured timeframes), or relational
power to do so. Nevertheless I'm also taking this experience as a
learning opportunity. Even when I cannot refuse, I can still identify
specific examples of how I do not want to work, as much as how I hope to
when I have more institutional power, and I imagine I'll spend my career
trying to cultivate these practices. For those of you who currently hold
institutional power, educate yourself, and share learning on issues of
care and wellbeing in academia (e.g., see Boynton, 2021). Support and
shield students and colleagues who are striving to operate in subversive
and decolonizing ways; listen, and learn from them, and cultivate space
for the sharing of "involved stories" that speak to the discomfort and
unease of being complicit in the coloniality of social science research.
Furthermore, co-conspire and mobilize (also with alumni \[see Canham et
al., in, press\] and movements and communities outside of academia)
against the precariousness that pervades so much of this work. [We do
not engage in refusal to absolve ourselves of complicity or attempt to
move towards innocence, we engage in refusal to "unsettle
innocence]{.underline}" (Tuck & Yang, 2014), [and this ultimately, must
be a collective endeavor.]{.underline} It is essential that we attend to
both the long arc of collectively strategized change as well as moments
of ethics, in which our responsivity to more-than-human worlds is never
mechanistically presumed, but rather viewed as requiring, "a moment by
moment process of ethically sensitive negotiation at the boundaries of
our being" (Shotter, 1992, p. 11). In order to put our differences "to
work" (Ahmed, 2000) we must form entire webs of refusals, through which
new ethico-political and agentic possibilities can emerge.

[In emptiness there is pause.]{.underline} There is no requirement for
full, complete interpretation or translation. In emptiness, critical
cotheorizing, productive touching, and contamination among us can occur
without a final answer, magnifying glass, dictation, a recording device,
a funded grant, a performance of complete mastery. In emptiness, there
is also what I offer as careful guessing or careful guesswork. [Building
from critical Indigenous studies, guesswork honors emptiness, respecting
the refusals, the breaks, the pauses, the doors shut and not inspecting
the windows. Careful guesswork also urges a form of study that is not
extractive, that is desire- based,18 that does not seek to build new
theories that displace Indigenous theorizing.]{.underline}19 Careful
guessing is critically attentive to the ongoing dimensions and histories
of power relations that shape the responses to the question at hand and
the forms of questioning that seem possible and impossible[. Who and
what shape my questions that seem naturalized to me? Careful guesswork
upholds that I can guess to the best of my knowledge, with
accountability to place and peoples,20 and with an **ethic of anti-
coloniality and decoloniality** when possible.21]{.underline} [Careful
guesswork insists that objectivity is an impossibility, that researchers
are narrators who craft compromised stories. We are guessing always, and
our guesses must work to be consensual among all forms of our
interlocutors, relations, and the careful guessing that has emerged
before us.22]{.underline} In my own guesswork, I am studying,
researching, and guessing about Indigenous ice geographies, the spatial
materiality of ice, and the experiences that ice might be having. I
cannot know with the normative performance of certainty that is expected
of a researcher. I can read, listen, and participate thoroughly, widely,
experientially and make careful guesses. The work of careful guessing in
relation to nonhuman kin, entities, and collaborators is not to
anthropomorphize. Guesswork upholds that ice geographies cannot and will
not be enclosed by the stretches of human intellectualizing or
imagination. Instead, I can try to the best of my careful, critical
abilities to tell my compromised reflections of the interlocking
politics, stories, histories, and affective embodiments of and with ice
geographies that existed before I had ideas about them. [As Sai diya
Hartman writes of her concept **critical fabulation**, there is a
politicalethical- moral container we make as our research protocols. It
is our responsibility to write within and against the intellectual
infrastructures that invent the limits of what and who counts and
matters.]{.underline}23 In care- Careful Guessing • 11 ful guesswork,
emptiness is a political reality of the haunting of colonial theft,24 a
choice or a refusal,25 and the material embodiment of space and the
infrastructure of matter to contain emptiness. Emptiness does not equate
to meaninglessness or a void to be filled with meaning. For even if this
mischaracterization were true, that ice geographies are empty, would
they be less worthy of my time, attention, and care? Toward that
sensibility, I'm not concerned with redeeming ice as meaningful. Nor do
I uphold a social vibrancy of ice, demonstrate a value of ecological
vitality, or unmake it as a wasteland. From where I sit, [ice is not in
need of redemption or valorization; it has always been and will continue
to be consequential in multitudinous ways and especially to Indigenous
peoples. I am also interested in how ice geographies and the materiality
of ice have been deployed to serve colonial enterprises of anti-
Indigeneity.]{.underline} My curiosity in materiality is not to
deemphasize affect or to uphold a positivistic analysis that
necessitates material evidence as the arbiter of Truth. I show that the
research- [need for material evidence necessitates violence against
Indigenous peoples, their ancestors, and their cultural
items.]{.underline} [Oftentimes the materiality of ice and other matter
are made into evidence to prove violent theses. If ice isn't empty and
but is also generatively empty, then it has also been a site for
normative machinations of masculinity and can also override those
determinations. Imperial science at the poles is nearly always entangled
with identity- making projects of white nationalism, resourcebased
commerce, and masculinity]{.underline}.26 Lisa Bloom's ever- relevant
text Gender on Ice: American Ideologies of Polar Expeditions reminds
readers that "polar expeditions were icons of the whole enterprise of
colonialism" and that "the difficulty of life in desolate and freezing
regions provided the ideal mythic site where men could show themselves
as heroes capable of superhuman feats."27 The impulse to test and
evidence masculine mettle against the elements is ongoing. In a sense,
the figure of the hero never dies.28 This book takes up ice and race. [I
illustrate that spaces of ice were weaponized by Enlightenment
philosophers through concepts of environmental determinism to racialize
and dispossess Indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Within these notions,
"extreme" environments of the North supposedly rendered Indigenous
peoples intellectually and corporeally inferior, particularly in
distinction to white men inhabiting temperate zones from whom and from
where these theories emerged.]{.underline} Environmental determinism of
the "frigid" and "torrid" zones is linked in the simul- 12 •
Introduction taneous and similar racialization of Indigenous peoples in
tropical and icy geographies. Enlightenment philosophers and ancient
geographers defined tropicality through a racialization that
characterized peoples of the mid- latitudes as "naturalized" laborers
and in other space- times into property,29 whereas [iciness was wielded
to dispossess Indigenous peoples of juridical claims to Indigenous
rights and territory]{.underline}.[30 In ice geographies, racial
histories of ice figure into the ways that Indigenous peoples were
forced to navigate juridical realms of land meanings and land
dispossession. Ice geographies, as they are brought under an imperial
scientific laboratorial gaze and racializing regime, are bound up with
colonial enactments over land, territory, and the peoples who live in
concert with those lands and territories.]{.underline}31 Nineteenth-
century polar expeditions were compared alongside expeditions to what
was called "darkest Africa."32 [The gendered and colonial ideations of
conquering the "blank, white space" on the map of the Arctic and
Antarctica are also always racialized, antiIndigenous, and anti- Black
projects as well.]{.underline} In Alaska the naming of the territory
"darkest Alaska" fit easily in American imaginings of a wider imperial
geography. The central position of Africa as the "Dark Continent" in
colonial and imperial activities during the time period provided a kind
of common grammar.33 This book aims to keep the local contexts of
colonialism and imperialism central while not losing sight of the
entanglements of global projects of white supremacy always at work. In
Cooling the Tropics, for instance, Hi'ilei Hobart analyzes the global
movements of ice as a comestible and as a refreshment.34 Hobart
clarifies how [ice followed the ruts of empire and carved new routes of
dispossession.]{.underline} In this case, ice as a foodstuff can be made
mobile and in tropical environments act as a "cooling" metonym for
civilization. [Ice is also important to analyze in relation to the role
that agriculture plays in coloniality, racialization, and land
dispossession.]{.underline} An important dimension of environmental
determinism and thermal colonialism as they are enacted in both hot and
ice geographies is the implicit connection to the necessity of
agriculture to the production of civilization and culture itself.[35
Early forms of racialization were constitutive to logics of agricultural
sedentarism and what I call temperate- normativity. Temperate-
normativity suggests that part of the myth of Western civilization is
that only from temperate zones could proper forms of civilization
grounded in agricultural practices and settled livelihoods flourish.36
Not only did the climates of tropical and ice geographies supposedly
produce Careful Guessing • 13 inferior human subjects, but those peoples
belonging to temperate zones through acts of conquest and invasion
believed they could "progressively soften harsh climates and the
allegedly barbarous, politically fragmented societies peopling
them."]{.underline} 37 These early foundations of race- thinking through
geography and climate racialization shaped cultural and scientific
knowledge production about climate itself, ice, and the tropics, as well
as early and lasting manifestations of the category of the Human. ICE,
THE HUMAN, AND VIOLENCE The historical foundations of race and space
discussed previously continue to shape scientific, legal, and cultural
interactions with ice geographies into the twenty- first century.
Although environmental determinism is sometimes understood as a form of
racialization that preceded and linearly gave way to the rise of
scientific racism, it is not bound by the Enlightenment. Narratives of
climate determinism histories, especially of ice, are necessarily
enmeshed with contemporary coloniality and racialization. Those
entanglements often go overlooked to favor and are also reiterated
within generic, grand, planetary narrations. Such narrations of ice are
meant to tell a generalized "we" something about humanity's linear past,
present, and future. Humanity is defined in this case as largely
sedentary Western civilizations that succeed in temperate locales and
support settlements capable of domesticated agriculture--- something
that ice inherently forbids in its resistance to root. The making of
these categories, [Human and Humanity, require and produce discursive,
epistemic, and corporeal violence.38 The category of the Human, and its
inherent exclusions, are in part forged through understandings of
racialized theorizations of climate and land,]{.underline} expectations
of how that land is worked, and what is produced from that land by human
effort. I am concerned with [the violences borne of the categories of
the Human and the nonhuman,]{.underline} for one necessitates the
simultaneous, careful analysis of the other. One form that violence
takes is the relationship between the ice geographies of the Arctic and
Antarctica and how they have been written as a place of objective,
universal human activity. [In the context of Antarctica, the category of
the Human plays out in the original moments of historical/Western
Antarctic **expeditions,** in more contemporary nationalized science and
**exploration narratives**]{.underline}, a

[If the power of a map operates successfully by constituting an object
or place as a 'true' and 'natural' domain, "as a taken-for-granted
ontology"]{.underline} (Butler 1993, p. 10), [then it can have material
effects because it is taken as a primary given]{.underline}. Thus,
Butler argues that [materiality "is power in its formative or
constituting effects]{.underline}" (1993, p. 9, emphasis in original).
[Moreover, it is precisely when something appears outside power and
discourse that its power is most effective]{.underline} (Butler 1993[).
For example, in a study of how Port-au-Prince]{.underline}, Haiti [is
represented in maps]{.underline}, Nicolas [Lemay-Hébert's]{.underline}
(2018) [found that colour zoning on maps of 'safe' and 'unsafe' areas
affects not only how United Nation officials regulate their
interventions but also how local people themselves talk about, think
about, and act in their city]{.underline}. [The colours of the zones on
the maps -- e.g., red, yellow, and green -- become part of people's
self-identification and help establish an imagined geography of
insecurity in Port-au-Prince]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} study
[shows how visual representation in maps are central in these processes
of thinking and acting and how maps are effective in 'selling' their
particular visions of the world]{.underline} (Dodge et al. 2011 in
Lemay-Hébert 2018, p. 96). In this way, maps end up having material
effects in ways that, for example, the people in Haiti may not have
intended or imagined.

Therefore, I find [the concept of cartographic materialisation helpful
in explaining the constitutive effects that maps have when they are
taken for-granted and their constitutive power]{.underline} is
[ignored]{.underline}. Moreover, I use 'cartographic materialisation' to
explain how [maps not only can constitute 'reality' today, but also can
constitute what is not yet materially 'real']{.underline}: [maps can
contribute to enabling particular expectations about the future, which
can later materialise as a map's ideational power.]{.underline} **[In
the context of the Arctic]{.underline}**, this is particularly
interesting as Steinberg et al. (2015) argue that **[imaginaries matter
more here than elsewhere]{.underline}**. [Hence, what a map represents
as 'real' in the Arctic, such as new shipping routes or the occurrence
of natural resources, can build certain expectations that can drive
economic investments and become real.]{.underline} Furthermore, [maps
have the capacity to set the conditions for new images and expectations
of what can be and what can emerge; they have an '**unfolding
agency'**]{.underline} (Corner 1999, p. 214). [A similar line of
argument emerging from the aesthetics approach is that maps, like other
visuals, can set the "conditions of possibility]{.underline}" (Connolly
1991 in Bleiker 2019, p. 119). In other words, [maps can set the limits
for what is possible to think, write, map, and speak]{.underline}. They
can operate in the same way as Carol Bacchi and Susan Goodwin (2016)
argue that policies can: as taken-for- granted background descriptions
and, more importantly, as constitutive of the conditions under which
perceptions and expectations of the future are being governed.

Thus, [particular **expectations about the future can be nested in
maps**]{.underline}. According to James Porter and Samuel Randalls
(2014), [expectations play a deeply political role in bringing into
existence one future over another]{.underline}. [Performative practices
such as making forecasts, models, or maps can "pre-emptively shape the
social, political and economic context for innovations as well as
influences people's thinking]{.underline}" (Porter and Randalls 2014, p.
203). [The materialisation of particular expectations is made more or
less probable depending on the success of the map in naturalising and/or
silencing particular representations of the world or issues in the
world]{.underline}. [By doing this, **maps can discern alternative
possibilities not only as improbable, but also often as
impossible**]{.underline} (Ferguson 1996, p. 169). [Within this lies
also the role that maps can have in decision-making, in particular when
maps are seen as forecasts produced by experts]{.underline} (Dunmire
2011[) that can contribute to silencing other forecasts or visions
coming from 'non-experts' such as local communities. This contributes to
limiting the alternatives upon which political decisions can be
made.]{.underline}

However, [while maps can constrain what is thought of as possible by
blocking alternatives, they also have the potential to enable ideas and
open up 'thinking space',]{.underline} to use a term from Bleiker
(2017). This is in line with my definition of power as not simply
restricting, but also constitutive in enabling ways of thinking and
living our lives (see p. 57- 58). Moreover, [the power of maps to affect
ideas,]{.underline} as noted by Winichakul (1994) and Branch (2011,
2014), [indicates their ability to not only depict the political world,
but also to being actively involved in producing this political
world.]{.underline} Furthermore, I contend that [a map's ability to
limit as well as enable ideas about the future is not only something in
the past, relating to the emergence of the state system but also
something that is happening today,]{.underline} which I will illustrate
in in the context of the Arctic by unpacking what particular maps do to
the political visions for the future. Eleonora Masini22 makes a similar
claim: "The future must not only be foreseen and dreamt of, but also
chosen and built" (2006, p. 1159). Thus, the concept of cartographic
materialisation helps me understand how maps can constitute choices and
political alternatives for a future that can become materialised.

#### Power is constitutive, and understanding that reality is created through discursive representations is key to moving beyond the hegemonic relationships that traditional maps promote.

[Power is here understood as "the production, in and through social
relations, of effects that shape the capacities of actors to determine
their circumstances and fate"]{.underline} (Barnett and Duvall 2005, p.
42). [This is different from a more realist conception of power being
the ability (of states) "to get others to do what they otherwise would
not"]{.underline} (Barnett and Duvall 2005, p. 40). [Therefore, instead
of power being repressive, imposing limits and constraints on how we
live our lives, **power is constitutive** because it can impose limits
and constraints as well as enable ideas and thinking about our ways of
living and the future.]{.underline} Thus, [constitutive power produces
understandings as well as the foundations for
understandings]{.underline}. Key here is also the argument that **[power
is produced through discursive representations]{.underline}** (Foucault
1982; Campbell and Bleiker 2016). [Discursive representation is in this
thesis understood as a process with which we organise our understanding
of reality]{.underline} (Bleiker 2009). [Importantly, this recognises
that **the 'real' is inseparable from how it resides in our discursive
representations**]{.underline} (Shapiro 1988, p. 8). [Moreover, it is
through discursive representations such as texts, images, films, and
maps, that meanings, identities, and social relations are constituted,
making political ideas, visions, and outcomes more or less
possible]{.underline} (Campbell 2013, p. 234-235). [Hence, **what
matters is how a representation limits what can be talked** about as
"possible or desirable, or as impossible or undesirable]{.underline}"
(Bacchi 1999, p. 3).

Moreover, according to Shapiro (1996, p. xvii), [discursive
representations involve a temporary fix of a meaning at the expense of
other possible meanings]{.underline}. Similarly, Bacchi (1999, p. 7)
argues that [any proposed 'solution' depends on the discursive
representation of what the 'problem' is. That is, gaining an
understanding of the constitutive power of maps is central to
challenging hegemonic understandings of issues and, as such, inspires
and promotes alternative map representations on which the future can be
envisioned and built]{.underline}. To facilitate my analysis of the
constitutive power of maps [I have developed the following three broad
assumptions about constitutive power 'effects':]{.underline}

#### Only a decolonized Arctic can ensure the survival of indigenous cultures and create sustainable solutions to climate change.

Despite the Arctic's central role in our planet's health, it is often
still perceived as a distant, isolated, region. Inhabited for millennia
by Indigenous Peoples who are the custodians of deep ecological
knowledge, this region is now one of the most visible epicentres of
environmental injustice.

The David Suzuki Foundation's mission is clear: [**to protect nature's
diversity and the wellbeing of all life. But for this mission to be
truly transformative, it must be deeply rooted in environmental justice
and decolonized governance.** Environmental justice affirms the right of
every individual to live in a healthy environment. **By decolonized
governance, we mean dismantling the colonial legal systems we have
inherited -- systems built by former colonial powers through policies,
practices and structures that marginalized Indigenous Peoples and
dispossessed them of their ancestral lands.**]{.underline}

Understanding decolonized governance

**[Decolonized governance---whether at the societal level or within
specific communities, such as universities or scientific and
professional bodies---requires the recognition and respect of diverse
knowledge systems and traditional cultures that shape our relationships
with land, social structures, and community cohesion.]{.underline}**

[This perspective also calls on us to reject the deeply rooted tendency
to value certain communities and knowledge systems over others--- a
legacy of the colonial mindset.]{.underline}

**[Although society has largely renounced the 15th-century religious and
legal doctrines that justified the dispossession of Indigenous Peoples
throughout the world and the destruction of their ancestral lands, the
enduring inequalities rooted in that colonial legacy remain far from
resolved.]{.underline}**

The Arctic: At the Frontlines of Environmental Harm

The Arctic plays a key role in our planet's health, and yet it remains
largely on the peripheries of international cooperation. Even today, our
global economic system and the laws that shape it, all too often
consider the Arctic to be a zone of competition and resource extraction,
rather than a region that must be governed with respect for the
self-determination and fundamental rights of the Indigenous Peoples who
have inhabited it for millennia.

[The international economic and environmental systems that shape the
Arctic's ecosystems and profoundly affect the livelihood of Arctic
communities have been driven by colonial powers seeking to control the
Arctic for their own gain, whether through resource extraction, military
expansion, or both. This history has left deep scars on the region's
social, cultural and environmental fabric.]{.underline}

[**Inuit communities continue to bear the impacts of both historical and
ongoing injustices**: poverty rates in the region remain significantly
higher than the national average, housing is often overcrowded and
inadequate, and access to clean drinking water is still
unequal.]{.underline}

[On an environmental level, Inuit women have been found to carry much
higher levels of PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) in their
breastmilk compared to populations in southern Canada -- a direct
consequence of widespread chemical pollution driven by global industrial
activity.]{.underline}

[The Arctic is also severely impacted by plastic pollution, which harms
its wildlife, ecosystems and communities. This serves as a stark example
of how consumption and production choices made elsewhere in the world
impose a heavy toxic burden on populations that have contributed little
or nothing to the problem.]{.underline}

[These realities reveal a profound imbalance: the communities least
responsible for environmental crises are often the ones suffering their
worst consequences. In the context of accelerating climate change,
maintaining the current model of globalization will not only perpetuate
these injustices -- it will intensify them. Melting glaciers, ocean
acidification and biodiversity loss are not distant or abstract threats;
they are part of the daily reality of Northern communities.]{.underline}

Legal milestones: Significant, but fragile

For decades, Inuit communities have warned global governments of the
existential threats that they face---threats that also have global
repercussions. For example, Inuit organizations play a key role in
international efforts seeking to regulate chemical substances, including
the Stockholm and Minamata Conventions, as well as the Arctic Council
and the International Maritime Organization.

**[Thanks to their historic and contemporary efforts, as well as the
broader mobilization of Indigenous and allied voices across the country,
we are beginning to see meaningful shifts in how laws are developed,
especially in terms of whose voices are included in decision-making
processes. In a notable step forward, Canada passed its first
environmental justice law last year.]{.underline}**

**[This law provides a crucial tool for advancing the wellbeing of
Arctic communities by requiring that environmental decisions made by the
Canadian government take into account local realities, Indigenous
knowledge and the systemic inequalities that affect health, food
security and the broader human environment.]{.underline}**

Another significant victory for the right to a healthy environment was
recently secured through the Canadian Environmental Protection Act.

[For Arctic communities, the recognition of this right under federal law
provides a critical legal foundation to demand environmental policies
and programs that reflect their unique living conditions, address the
persistent pollution threatening their health and the need to protect
the ecosystems their ways of life depend on.]{.underline}

Through this legislative reform, the federal government has also
acknowledged that certain communities---especially Indigenous,
racialized and remote ones---are disproportionately affected by
environmental damage. While imperfect and still insufficient, these
changes to the law pave the way for a more equitable transformation of
our public policy.

The Arctic must be fully included in -- and benefit from -- this
evolving legal landscape. Whether in terms of plastic pollution,
chemical pollution, climate change or biodiversity loss, Arctic
communities experience a disproportionate share of the environmental
harms.

These legislative reforms can and must be leveraged to protect the
North's fragile ecosystems, uphold the rights of Indigenous Peoples and
support communities in their fight against environmental and climate
injustice.

The role of research in building justice

[Researchers have a vital role to play in this context. **By documenting
environmental inequalities, generating localized data and centering
Indigenous knowledge, research conducted in true partnership with
Indigenous communities can serve as a powerful catalyst for advocacy,
policy change and transformative action.**]{.underline}

[By drawing on new legal frameworks such as the environmental justice
law or the right to a healthy environment, scientists can help shape
public policy, support community-led advocacy and co-develop solutions
grounded in the lived realities of the North.]{.underline}

[The next generation of Arctic research must be conducted in true
partnership with Inuit communities as knowledge-holders, decision-makers
and innovators. It is only by grounding science in Indigenous
sovereignty and justice that we can create solutions that are truly
sustainable, equitable and responsive to local realities.]{.underline}

**[Collaborative research, conducted with---not on---Inuit communities
is the only path forward. It must be grounded by the principles of
justice, reciprocity, respect for rights and Indigenous sovereignty over
ancestral knowledge.]{.underline}**

Decolonized governance for a viable future

We face a brutal truth: climate collapse, inescapable pollution,
ecosystem degradation and geopolitical instability are converging in
ways that threaten not only the biosphere, but the very foundations of
the international community established after the Second World War.

[This system, founded on cooperation, peace, and collective security,
has been profoundly undermined by ecological crises fueled by economic
greed, with the Arctic standing as a visible and urgent
epicentre.]{.underline}

[We can no longer afford to underestimate the threats facing this
strategic and vulnerable region. Nor can we continue the extractive,
paternalistic models of scientific research that have long excluded
Indigenous voices and appropriated their knowledge without
reciprocity.]{.underline}

[Science, technology and innovation are never neutral---they are shaped
by social, political and cultural contexts -- and must be held
accountable to justice.]{.underline}

**[Inuit knowledge must not only shape the decisions that directly
affect Northern territories but also inform global ecological
transitions.]{.underline}**

[We call on all stakeholders---researchers, communities, decision-makers
and allies---to reflect on their role in promoting environmental justice
for the Arctic. This is not a distant issue: it is a global emergency
that demands concrete action rooted in respect, solidarity and
justice.]{.underline}

[Ice geographies in a contemporary, normative sense are dominantly
imagined and circulate as landscapes of consequence only in their
declining transitory states as they pose potential problems to
geographies imagined as more meaningful.]{.underline}5 In its most
present form, ice animates the look and feel of rapid, urgent climate
change. Across all versions of mainstream media, on tv screens, news
headlines, and internet memes, glaciers and ice sheets collapse. [Ice
melt is mediated out to a mass audience. However, viewers aren't always
seeing the infrastructures of **colonial capitalism** from which that
ice melt is a consequence.]{.underline} It is true that today[, ice is
melting faster than ever before. Melt causes social upheaval among
**northern coastal communities,** as well as those lives shaped by sea
level rise. Alaska's western coast was pummeled by **Typhoon Merbok in
2022**, a storm bigger than has been seen in decades and made worse by
an unusually warm Pacific Ocean, for instance. Ice melt disrupts long-
standing practices of mobility by Indigenous peoples across all ice
geographies. Communities are meant to relocate due to rising seas
without aid from governments invested in capitalist extraction directly
implicated in sea level rise. Relations with ice shift more quickly than
ever remembered, which challenge Indigenous fishing, harvesting, and
hunting practices. As of 2021, the Arctic is **warming at a pace four
times faster than the rest of the planet.**]{.underline}6 Sea ice volume
in the Arctic has reduced by two- thirds since it was first measured in
1958.7 One of Antarctica's ice shelves named "Doomsday Glacier" parts
away from itself and into the ocean. [Simultaneously, an inundation of
climate models anticipates a sea level rise over the next decade, half
century, and century that will reshape the sociality of the
globe.]{.underline} Readers, viewers, and listeners are told that
melting ice will continue to disrupt a more temperate world as sea
levels rise in every imaginable future because of and despite change in
human behavior. Simultaneously, activism and proactive initiatives by
Arctic Indigenous people(s) abound and multiply for climate justice. Ice
melt also creates and collides with other natural disasters heightened
under the conditions of capitalist resource extraction and accumulation,
like floods, fires, and freeze. [That same ice melt in the far North
creates new opportunities for the expansion of profit, of shipping
lanes, and the mobility of seemingly ever- expanding resource
extraction.]{.underline} Melting icebergs are transported by artists to
well- trafficked city squares and 8 • Introduction conferences that
bring melt to a more temperate experience of everyday life. Ice has
become an unprecedented daily mediated experience of modernity across
the globe. As a result, conditions of ice are now a key interest for
political, economic, academic, and activist stakeholders. This
unsettling potential of ice thus spatially and temporally shapes the
ways that contemporary humans understand the past, respond to the
present, and plan for the future. [Yet, ice has always been at the
center of making sense of the world. Ice as a de- peopled **melting
catastrophe, as a threat that will unsettle the settled and the
settlers, is a modern iteration of long- standing ice anxieties,**
obsessions, and normative orderings. It has taken a considerable number
of colonial enactments for certain sets of humans to imagine the Arctic,
and other ice geographies, as empty and de- peopled. Especially as
**ontologically, cosmologically, and juridically**, ice in part shapes
and figures the world for many Indigenous peoples who call the Arctic
home and homeland, and have for thousands of years.8 Reflections on ice
have also long been a constitutive element of Western political thought
and cultural imagination for hundreds of years.9]{.underline} The way
that ice geographies are figured in contemporary discourse are just one
piece of a longer story of ice relations and imaginings[. Ice is
anything but an innocent, pristine entity or apolitical, geographical
soothsayer. Historically, ice has been cast as blank, barren, empty
and/or ahistorical and disconnected from ongoing socialities, human or
otherwise.10]{.underline} [Often a description of emptiness attends the
desires of extraction in some form such as resource extraction of crude
oil or natural gas. In many colonial cases, landscapes must be made
empty for white masculinity to be tested against it or technological
invention to be tested within it.]{.underline} Across landscapes that
are not immediately identifiable as easily workable for capitalist
enterprise such as those of ice, desert, or swamp, the articulated
["emptiness" of a landscape opens it for capitalist improvement,
development, or other forms of extractive property relation. In the
Arctic, emptiness is articulated to identify it as
exploitable.11]{.underline} The practical response has been to evidence
nonemptiness through a demonstration of liveliness and fullness, as
clear evidence of why not to harm and exploit what was previously
interpreted as empty[--- to fill the empty Arctic with life.12 It is not
empty; it is vibrant, it is full **of history, stories, relations, and
peoples.**]{.underline} These claims are correct, and I pause at the
impulse to fill some manufactured void with information. Who am Careful
Guessing • 9 I trying to persuade, exactly, with whose relations, and
with what tools and methods of proof? I'd like to push a bit on the
strategic necessity to argue for the legible fullness of ice
geographies, both ecologically and socially. The response to imbue ice
geographies with vibrancy is also to try to imbue ice with more
acceptable qualities for those unfamiliar with those spaces. The urge is
to fill ice geographies with notions of normative life, to unmake or
improve its "wasteland" nature into something more recognizably aligned
with [normative or capitalist value, something vibrant or even
pure.]{.underline} I'd like to offer a way to relate to ice and ice melt
in a similar way to what M. Murphy calls "chemical alterlife." 13
Alterlife questions the normative senses of what life is and "asks for
an unflinchingly pessimistic acknowledgment that these chemical
relations are racist, harmful, even deadly, and that it is up to you to
take on the ways that you are caught up in the killing (even if they are
killing you too, just more softly)." 14 Each of us is implicated with
ice melt. Though, like the metabolization of chemicals, there is an
unequal felt experience15 of that melt and, of course, the unequal
contribution of a capitalist- carbon "footprint" that makes melt in the
first place.16 [In this alterlife, in which we are all caught up in the
differently experienced melt, the generative capacity of emptiness can
act as a reframing.]{.underline} I will not rush to narratively fill
emptiness, to beautify it toward progress. Erica Violet Lee writes, ["A
wasteland is a place where, we are taught, there is nothing and no one
is salvageable. . . . Wastelands are spaces deemed unworthy of healing
because of the scale and amount of devastation that has occurred there.
Wastelands are named wastelands by the ones responsible for their
devastation." 17 I add that wastelands are named wastelands by the ones
who have **no relation, no history** to lands deemed **empty, wasted,
and/or destroyed**.]{.underline} I'm unconvinced by the need to prove
otherwise, to fill emptiness. In looking closely at a snowflake, the
building material of ice, each snow crystal is shaped by its corners,
openings, bubbles, and empty spaces. These characteristics are what
fundamentally constitute the productive and capacious nature of ice,
both scientifically and aesthetically. [Empty spaces allow for matter to
temporarily cohere.]{.underline} [Empty spaces allow for the unknotting
of the bind that yokes us as researchers to believe that we must know
and report on every knowable thing in every knowable aspect about our
research subject, object, place, and interlocutors, to 10 • Introduction
name and intellectualize a feeling into data before we've let it wash
over and saturate us.]{.underline}

An estimated 10 percent of the nearly four million residents throughout
the entire Arctic region are Indigenous. Indigenous populations have
inhabited much of the Arctic for thousands of years, long before the
land was claimed and divided into nation-states. Interest in
opportunities for natural resource extraction drove the historic
colonization in the Arctic and, today, the increasing accessibility of
minerals and oil due to climate change is fuelling the so-called "Arctic
resource boom"---a quest to find and exploit the region's remaining
resources. **[As more international players hope to participate in
Arctic affairs, it is critical to not only consider how these ventures
impact Indigenous populations but to prioritize decolonization in these
spaces.]{.underline}**

**[Climate change is occurring more rapidly in the Arctic than in any
other part of the world, with the most recent evidence pointing to a
rate of warming nearly four times greater than the global
average.]{.underline}** This warming is driving the thawing of
permafrost, loss of seasonal snow cover, and melting of sea ice, ice
caps and glaciers; each, in turn, increasing the accessibility of
natural resources and growing global interest in the Arctic. This
article uses a decolonization framework to analyze resource development
with a focus on the United States (US), which is considered an Arctic
state by way of Alaska. Decolonization will be defined as a concept and
practice of confronting and reversing the historic and ongoing legacies
of colonialism, including the structures of power that uphold
inequalities.

[After a brief background covering land ownership and some of the
outcomes of resource development in Alaska, this article will delve into
**dynamics that reproduce and perpetuate colonial structures of power.
This analysis will feature (i) the prioritization of state and federal
interests through the idea of sovereignty and (ii) the primacy and
assumed superiority of Western knowledge and conventions and,
conversely, the disregard for Indigenous knowledge systems and
worldviews.** To bridge the gap between theory and action, the article
will continually ask what it would mean to **decolonize resource
development in the US Arctic. Confronting the ongoing systems and
dynamics of colonialism must be placed at the forefront of present-day
and future Arctic engagement and collaboration---not only in the US, but
throughout the region.**]{.underline}

Background

[The United States purchased the land that is present-day Alaska from
Russia in 1867. Just over a century later, in 1968, the discovery of oil
in Prudhoe Bay made the Arctic relevant at a national scale. The
commercial export of oil to the lower 48 states was now possible for the
first time. Hindering this ambition, however, was the fact that the
planned pipeline to carry the oil south traversed lands claimed by
Alaska Native populations. 'Alaska Native' refers collectively to the
Indigenous populations who have lived in present-day Alaska for
thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans in the 1700s. This
term encompasses "many nations and tribes" and "widely diverse cultures,
languages, lifeways, art forms and histories". To enable the
construction of the pipeline to the contiguous United States, land
claims issues around Prudhoe Bay were settled with the Alaska Native
Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) in 1971. ANCSA extinguished Indigenous
claims to nearly 400 million acres of land throughout the state in
exchange for \$962.5 million and ownership of 43.7 million
acres.]{.underline}

ANCSA also divided the state into twelve regions, each with an Alaska
Native Regional Corporation. The regional boundaries of the corporations
do not, however, equate to land ownership; land in Alaska is
predominantly owned by the state and federal governments. Just 10
percent of Alaska's 663,000 square miles are owned by Alaska Native
populations. The Regional Corporations operate under US corporate law to
administer resources and serve the local communities. These for-profit
corporations participate in the Alaskan natural resource industry, both
directly and indirectly.

**[Federal Arctic policy in the US has tended to emphasize the
exploitation of Arctic resources for US economic development. Within the
new National Strategy for the Arctic Region (released October 2022),
economic development continues to receive a strong emphasis---alongside
security---and Arctic investments are expected to increase over the
following decade. In the face of this ever-growing interest in Arctic
engagement, Alaska Native communities may face new and renewed colonial
intrusion in the form of large-scale resource
development.]{.underline}**

Effects of resource development

Continual 'boom and bust' with periods of financial growth and decline
characterizes resource development in the capitalist system. This
instability prohibits many communities from relying solely on economies
centered on resource extraction. Subsistence practices provide a source
of greater stability within what would otherwise be an unstable
extractive economy. Resource extraction has, however, had detrimental
impacts on the land, water, and wildlife that reduce the viability of
subsistence lifeways. Specifically, extractive activities have been
found to increase vulnerability to biological invasion, bring changes to
the land with built infrastructure, and introduce the risk of
contamination, such as oil spills. The resulting decreased viability of
subsistence practices is worsened by the threat climate change poses to
hunting and gathering activities.

[**Although some measures of physical health have improved since ANCSA,
resource extraction can compromise the health and wellbeing of nearby
Indigenous populations.** Significant health disparities remain among
Alaska Natives compared to non-native Alaskans and other US residents.
Generally, Alaska Natives have a lower life expectancy, increased risk
of cardiovascular disease, and an elevated burden of infectious disease.
By exacerbating food insecurity, the negative impacts of resource
development may contribute to and worsen health outcomes. Many of these
disparities are rooted in the history of colonialism and socio-political
marginalization; in addition, their persistence today may be attributed
to the disproportionate exposure to environmental health hazards.
Moreover, some researchers have found that health data fails to produce
a holistic picture of well-being, suggesting that there must be a
greater consideration for context-specific understandings of health
status.]{.underline}

Importantly, the effects of resource development are not felt uniformly
by Alaska Natives. Instead, various facets of identity among individuals
and communities impact how they relate to extractive activities.
Socioeconomic class divisions, gender identity, one's location in a
rural versus urban setting, and many other factors can all impact how
resource development is experienced. The complexity of the relationship
between resource development and Indigenous populations, and the
diversity within the Alaska Native population, must not be ignored or
simplified.

Sovereignty and the prioritization of state interests

[**To decolonize resource development, Alaska Native populations must
have greater control over the process. In other words, one overarching
aim of decolonization in practice is Indigenous sovereignty. However,
(neo)colonial narratives shape and are ingrained within the traditional
concept of state-centered sovereignty. Within this concept, the aims of
the government are continually prioritized; a hierarchy is established
whereby the interests and concerns of the state are given primacy. This
dynamic is one of the reasons why, in the case of Alaska and Alaska
Native populations, resource development continues to be experienced as
a colonial enterprise.** The gains from extractive activities do not
necessarily or primarily benefit Alaska Native populations, and the
interests of outside actors are prioritized. Oftentimes, wealth from
resource development has been extracted from northern regions to benefit
other populations. An evaluation of the Red Dog Mine in northwest
Alaska, for instance, found that the local population received a
relatively modest share of benefits in terms of employment, income, and
mobility.]{.underline}

**[As established through ANCSA, the Regional Corporations are the
primary route for Alaska Native participation in governing resource
development in the US Arctic. These corporations, however, operate under
US corporate law and, therefore, within the frameworks of the capitalist
order. Participation through the structure of the Regional Corporations,
thus, limits the opportunity for Alaska Native populations to achieve
self-determination outside of those conventions. In action, considering
the embeddedness of the corporations within the capitalist and colonial
dynamics of the state, decolonization may necessitate enhancing the
power of and regard for local governments rather than governing resource
development principally through the Regional
Corporations.]{.underline}**

Prioritization of Western knowledge and conventions

[A deep-rooted colonial mentality that remains pervasive is the assumed
supremacy of a Western knowledge system. This creates a paternalistic
relationship wherein decisions are made by external 'experts' and
imposed upon the Indigenous population. In short, Indigenous ways of
knowing are undermined. The term Indigenous knowledge is defined as "the
understandings, skills and philosophies developed by societies with long
histories of interaction with their natural surroundings". Efforts to
decolonize resource development in the US Arctic must not only embrace
these different worldviews, perspectives, and knowledge systems, but put
them first.]{.underline}

[There is also a tendency to assume that the only route to achieving
greater material benefits or power is to adopt a capitalist economy.
What Aníbal Quijano---one of the preeminent thinkers of decolonization
theory---terms 'cultural Europeanisation,' but can be understood as
colonial Western society more broadly, is taken as universal and
synonymous with being 'developed'. Before ANCSA was passed in 1971,
Alaska Native populations had primarily engaged in subsistence
activities. Since the settlement of land claims agreements, Alaska
Native populations are increasingly entrenched in the capitalist
economy, especially via resource development. Today, most Indigenous
people in Alaska engage in a mixed economy, meaning a combination of
both subsistence and market-based activities. A desire to obtain the
benefits from natural resource extraction on Indigenous lands is a
primary reason for this growth in capitalist engagement. Through a
decolonization lens, it is understood that following the rhetoric and
logic of Western society is a way to "reach the same material benefits
and the same power as the Europeans: viz, to conquer nature in short for
'development'". This model of development, however, has proven
"environmentally calamitous on the global scale", made even more dire by
the rapid impact of climate change throughout the Arctic.]{.underline}

Conceptualizing Indigenous sovereignty

[**Notions of Indigenous sovereignty are connected to the right to
self-determination. Decolonization must seek the conceptualization and
expression of Indigenous sovereignty outside of the western hegemony and
enduring colonial structures; self-determination and sovereignty are
limited when they can only be articulated within the existing capitalist
order. Dr. Melanie K. Yazzie presents the idea of anti-capitalist
decolonization to challenge the "hegemonic formation of 'extractivism'
and its liberal, capitalist, heteropatriarchal, and settler colonial
valance of development". This approach to decolonization seems
especially well suited to the Alaskan context as it critiques how
resource development is carried out in a capitalist system, instead of
presenting resource extraction as something inherently at odds with
indigeneity.** Indigenous sovereignty is reliant on the ability of
communities to have autonomy over their resources and decision-making,
as they have for thousands of years. An anti-capitalist approach to
decolonization offers a way to center Indigenous epistemologies and
enable economic, societal, cultural, and political pathways
conceptualized and implemented by Alaska Native people
themselves.]{.underline}

The ideas presented throughout this article are applicable well beyond
the US Arctic, and beyond the realm of resource development. Interest in
exploiting natural resources drove historic colonization throughout the
entire Arctic region and the lingering structures and systems of power
continue to shape Indigenous lives and limit the capacity of communities
and individuals to mold their own destinies. [Therefore, interrogating
and confronting the ongoing systems and dynamics of colonialism must be
prioritized within Arctic engagement and collaboration going forward. In
light of the new National Strategy for the Arctic Region---which
differs, in one way, from the prior 2013 edition in making no mention of
oil or gas---there is a need for further research and analysis to
identify the implications of this new strategy on efforts to decolonize
and achieve Indigenous sovereignty. There is also a need to center and
privilege Indigenous voices in this space and, as such, future research
must be informed and conceptualized by and for Arctic Indigenous
populations.]{.underline}

A note from the author

This article is based on and includes direct excerpts from the thesis
completed by the author for the earning of a Master of Science in
Development Practice at Trinity College Dublin, supervised by Dr.
Quentin Crowley and Dr. Padraig Carmody. Approval and permission for
this project, including the research aims, methods, and ethics, were
authorized by the module coordinator. Data was collected via two
methods: (i) desk-based research to produce a narrative review and (ii)
a series of semi-structured interviews with key informants and
stakeholders in Alaska. The primary outcome of this research was a
descriptive foundation upon which future research can build. The ideas
discussed are by no means comprehensive, nor do they represent the vast
diversity of opinions, values, and priorities that exist among Alaska
Native people and communities.

The author has reflected a great deal on her positionality, including
identifying and examining her interest in the subject, and has
questioned and critically engaged with her assumptions and
preconceptions. The author recognizes her positionality as an outsider
to this region and the communities she is writing about, as well as her
being raised in a Western system of knowledge that has continually
marginalized Indigenous voices. It is in no way her intention nor her
place to speak on behalf of any Indigenous person or other residents of
the Arctic region. Moreover, she acknowledges the need to decolonize
academic spaces and research processes.

MAPS, COLONIALISM, AND POWER In the colonial processes in Sápmi, and
elsewhere in the world, [the conquest and control of land has been one
of the most fundamental issues.]{.underline} Today, land-to be used for
mining, forestry, dams for hydroelectric power, wind power, or
tourism-remains central to state and corporate interests in the Sámi
areas. At the same time, [the Land]{.underline} (with a capital L) [is
in many ways of fundamental importance for upholding and developing Sámi
culture and identity, as well as for the possibility to express
Sáminess]{.underline}. [This centrality of land is shared with
indigenous groups in many parts ofthe world who are facing similar
threats]{.underline} to their traditional living spaces. Consequently,
[land and the understanding of land have been, and still are, of central
importance in the colonial confrontations and negotiations in
Sápmi]{.underline}, and [certainly in the different mapping projects
affecting this region]{.underline}. Today, conflicts over land rights in
connection with the expansion of mining projects and other industrial
enterprises in Sápmi are of great concern to Sámi communities and a
priority for Sámi activists and politicians. The multiple pressures from
different extractive industries and other encroachments in the Sámi
areas, which threaten nature, reindeer grazing lands, and traditional
livelihoods, have led to resistance and protests from local Sámi
communities as well as from central Sámi organizations and the Sámi
Parliament (Gärdebo, Öhman, and Maruyama 2014; Ojala and Nordin 2015;
Liliequist and Cocq 2017). These protests are part of a larger Sámi
ethnopolitical movement, struggling for recognition of land and cultural
rights, which in turn forms part of the international indigenous rights
movement. In these protests, the understanding of colonial history and
the notion of indigeneity become of central importance. In this paper,
[we wish to emphasize the connections between mapmaking, cartography,
surveying for natural resources, and Christian missionary work in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, as well as the close connections
between the scientific study of Sámi lands, history, and culture and the
exploration and exploitation of natural resources in Sápmi.]{.underline}
[We use \"mapping\" not only to denote map-making, but as a broader,
more complex concept, including ways of exploring and knowing land and
people in Sápmi. The concept of mapping, in this sense, combines
economic and material aspects as well as ideological and aesthetic
dimensions of colonial history]{.underline}. We see [the making of maps
as part of a world-making: the making of ideas, notions, and images of
the world, which in turn affect the lived realities]{.underline} of
people[, as well as physical landscapes.]{.underline} [Maps are always
an expression of specific, delimited, and situated perspectives on the
world. And as such, they are always embedded in power
relations.]{.underline} The [scholarship dealing with colonial mapping
and geographical knowledge in colonial and imperial contexts constitutes
a vast field]{.underline}, which cannot be covered in all its complexity
and diversity in this article. M[ap-making has played a central role in
processes of exploration and colonization around the world, and in the
interactions with indigenous peoples in the lands being colonized, which
have been discussed by scholars in different fields of
study]{.underline} (see, among many other works, Lewis 1998; Driver
2001; Hostetler 2001; Kivelson 2006; Short 2009; Seegel 2012;
Miggelbrink et al. 2013; Lennox 2017). This theme has, however, received
little attention in relation to Swedish colonialism in Sápmi (see,
though, e.g., Svalastog 2015).

[The constitution of Arctic space in this way is not merely a matter of
discursive scholarly, journalistic and policy utterance]{.underline}. It
is also a matter of legal inscription. [State-led bordering practices in
the Arctic are enabled and constrained by the prevailing legal
order]{.underline} (UNCLOS), [which itself conceptualises the law of the
sea as a matter of the apportioning of sovereign territorial
rights]{.underline} (Strandsbjerg 2012). [The accumulation of knowledge
about the Arctic]{.underline} through the development of statistical
indices and, in particular, [through the deployment of technologically
advanced forms of underwater surveying]{.underline} to resolve
jurisdictional claims (Arvelo 2014) [has the effect of reinforcing the
'sovereign competition']{.underline} version of the Arctic. Indeed
[these forms of knowledge are fundamental to the reinforcement of this
particular conception of the Arctic at the expense of
others.]{.underline} Indeed [the articulation of dominant discourse,
technology and knowledge through measurement would seem to have settled
the question of the constitution of 'the Arctic']{.underline}. Those
with [preferences for the containment of aggressive bordering practices
that exploit]{.underline} rather than mollify [the effects of climate
change]{.underline} in the circumpolar north should instead work for
collective regime solutions that bind states into cooperative
institutions premised on the appeasement of regional anarchy. This would
[seem in turn to exclude, emphatically and decisively, alternative
'Arctics' such as the ideal type derived here from notions of civic
cosmopolitanism and ecological sustainability]{.underline}. Perhaps, but
as this section suggests, [it is possible to think through forms of
Arctic governance that are premised on radically different conceptions
of the region]{.underline}. The combination of the cosmopolitan rights
of Arctic peoples is a powerful script here, not least because [the
actual juridical constitution of Arctic states is far from the settled
Westphalian spatio-temporal fi that is imagined in the dominant
discourse]{.underline}. For example, Aboriginal peoples are formally
recognised by the Constitution of Canada. The Arctic region of Nunavut,
which is demographically dominated by Inuit and other aboriginal
peoples, was formally constituted as a territory of Canada in 1999.4
Another case in point is Denmark, whose extensive claims in relation to
the region emerge from its complex post-colonial relationship with
Greenland. Greenland is formally an 'autonomous country' within the
Kingdom of Denmark. In practice this means that Greenland is autonomous
in matters of internal affairs, although for the time being it relies
upon substantial fiscal transfers from Denmark. Denmark is sovereign
over Greenland in matters of foreign policy and defence. Meanwhile the
2009 Self-Government Agreement establishes the Greenlandic population as
a people with the right to self-determination in international law
(Statsministeriat 2009). In short, to suggest that Denmark has
geopolitical interests in the Arctic needs to be placed within the
complex context of Greenland's gradual evolution towards full
independence. These brief examples serve to show that [the geopolitical
map of the Arctic is rather more fluid than might be gleaned from the
dominant discourse of the region.]{.underline} [The emphasis on peoples,
be they deserving of subnational recognition and autonomy
or]{.underline} perhaps (in the case of the Greenlandic people)
[sovereign self determination]{.underline}, is a hook upon which the
beginnings of a civic cosmopolitan version of the Arctic might be hung.
Plus, [as a number of writers have emphasised, the recognition of
aboriginal rights gives space for the articulation of aboriginal forms
of knowledge about the space over which they]{.underline} -- in many
cases -- [claim moral authority]{.underline}. As Dalby puts it,
['\[a\]boriginal lives and the cultural disruptions of modernisation in
remote northern areas directly confront the links between knowledge and
specifications of particular place]{.underline} (Dalby 2003; 181). The
[articulation of subaltern/aboriginal ways of knowing the Arctic -- of
rendering it legible as a space]{.underline} -- might perhaps be [best
expressed when conjoined with ideas about environmental sustainability,
which increasingly enjoy scientific as well as moral
authority.]{.underline} In Canada there is a twenty-year history of
bringing indigenous knowledge into dialogue with conventional science
(Bielawski 1995) and the voluminous multi-disciplinary literature on the
topic is suggestive of a growth of such encounters in the Arctic north
(see e.g. Cruikshank 2012). Moreover, it is doubtful whether there is
anything as potentially destabilising of traditional forms of
international politics and sovereign practice as the transplanetary
phenomenon of climate change (Gerhardt et al. 2010).

#### Borders are artificially constructed [discursive mechanisms]{.underline} that create [colonial violence]{.underline}. Any attempt to define, secure, and/or enforce a border is [Border Imperialism]{.underline}, vote for us to reject it.

Relatedly, another key element to understanding border imperialism is
that, like modernity, the nation-state, the Westphalian order, and
capitalist social relations----[borders are neither natural, nor
apolitical]{.underline}. Rather, [borders are **artificial
constructions** unjustifiably inscribed upon **land** and
**bodies**]{.underline} [through **violence**]{.underline}. From this
perspective, [it is essential to recognize the **authoritarian
exercises** of regulatory control that borders perpetuate by analyzing
the ways in which borders are used to surveil populations, manage
exclusion, and administer punishment]{.underline}. [Border
imperialism]{.underline} as an analytical frame [enables us to
understand how borders induce hierarchies and are deployed as
instruments of segregation that are wielded, ultimately, as weapons of
empire]{.underline}. In this way, [Walia's]{.underline} (2013)
[reckoning with **borders** demonstrates they **are apparatuses of state
repression, capitalist exploitation**, and **nationalist aggression**
and----that borders kill]{.underline}. To be exact, [the border is both
a material and discursive mechanism used to do the dirty work of
trapping people into having to navigate and withstand---constantly and
inescapably--- colonial power.]{.underline} [As well as its concomitant
abusive relationships, manipulation, and penchants for incarceration,
negligence, and humiliation]{.underline}. [Walia]{.underline} (2013)
[reinforces]{.underline} the links that imperial (b)ordering has with
the deracination, stigmatization, and stratification of differing
people:

"\...[border imperialism illuminates how colonial anxieties about
identity and inclusion within Western borders are linked to the racist
justifications for imperialist missions beyond Western borders that
generate cycles of mass displacement]{.underline} (6). Practices of
incarceration and expulsion, often shared across Western states,
demarcate zones of exclusion and mark those deemed undesirable
\[emphasis added\]" (31).

As evidenced above, [borders are not only the premeditated cause of de
facto segregation and hierarchies of humanity, but also spikes of toxic
stress, acute anxiety, and despair]{.underline} (Linton, Griffin,
Shapiro, 2017). [The effect of which is disproportionate amounts of
physical, psychological, and emotional trauma being experienced by those
deemed "undesirable" -- especially their children]{.underline} -- the
repercussions of which can be lifelong and are exacerbated if one is
ripped away from family (Van der Kolk, 2015). The scope of these
practices is extensive. As a recent study on US Immigration and Customs
Enforcement (ICE) conducted by Flores and Salazar (2017, 2) shows: "The
United States has the world's largest immigration detention system,
detaining up to 442,000 persons per year; many are children. \[emphasis
added\]" In offering a unnerving glimpse of this sobering reality,
Linton, Kennedy, Shapiro, and Griffin (2018, 125), conducting research
in pediatrics and medicine, illustrate:

"Once in US custody, all immigrants, including single adults, families
with children, and unaccompanied children, are transported to Customs
and Border Protection Processing Centers. Almost 70% of all immigrants
are processed through the Rio Grande Valley Sector Processing Center,
located in McAllen, Texas. Temperatures in this facility are chilly
(universally referred to as "hieleras" \[ice boxes\]), and children are
initially in the same space with adults who may include the person who
brought them through Mexico. "Processing" is the first step in US
reception and takes place in chain-link, locked enclosures (called
"perreras" \[dog cages\]), where children and their accompanying
caregivers (parents, grandparents, older siblings, or other family) are
subsequently separated into short-term holding cells by gender and age.
This can leave toddlers separated from their caregivers, siblings
separated from each other, or spouses separated from their partners."

Further confirmation that borders are not only instruments of power and
division, but abuse. [The justification to establish and enforce/arm a
border **necessitates a perceived enemy** "Other,"]{.underline}
preferably [one that]{.underline} is menacing, or at least [constructed
to be]{.underline}. Historically, this has been precedent.
[Presently]{.underline}, however, [the state cannot levy bigoted
epithets upon target groups with orientalist legislation as recklessly
as it once could. As an alternative, the racially-coded rhetoric and
rule of law now deploys a jingoistic phobia-inciting vocabulary of
"threat," "crime," "illegality," "protection," and
"security,"]{.underline} with the term ["alien"]{.underline} being
especially damning (Jiwani, 2002). Walia (2013, 6) details the
socio-psychological influence it carries as a discursive tool and
device:

"Migrants' precarious legal status and precarious stratification in the
labour force are further inscribed by racializing discourses that cast
migrants of colour as eternal outsiders: in the nation-state but not of
the nation-state."

"[Defense" of the border is also an obsessive preoccupation of the
colonial state]{.underline}, which it does both socio-spatially and
dynamically----not to mention ruthlessly. In describing this,
[Walia]{.underline} (2013, 29) [states]{.underline}: "[Border
securitization operates not at a fixed site but rather through
**structures and technologies of power across
geographies**.]{.underline}" Indeed, **[the border is ground zero for
purging the Other]{.underline}**, and its state-sanctioned enforcers
have effectively been handed a blank check, a loaded gun, and impunity
when it comes to capturing migrants, expelling the "undesirable,"
incarcerating travelers, fracturing families, and confining children in
cages. And no one is safe in a prison or cage. Just as no one is illegal
or "alien." [As detailed above, borders are violent socio-spatial
phenomena.]{.underline} [It is]{.underline} thus [vital to draw
attention to how they and the driving colonial-capitalist forces behind
them are situated and relational]{.underline}, as well as generating
affliction and anguish across places and psyches. That is, [while global
in scale and habit, **the aftermaths and ongoing effects of borders and
bordering processes** are undeniably emplaced. Equally unique yet
ubiquitous, corporeal and psychological, as well as internalized both
individually and socially]{.underline}. And despite that the products of
borders vary across time and space, [the rationale and motivations
underpinning them remain interrelated and certainly rhyme.]{.underline}
Meaning, it is necessary to engage in historical and geopolitically
contextualized analyses when it comes to diagnosing, scrutinizing,
halting, and repairing the destructive consequences and human damage
resulting from borders. Because as Walia (2013, 6) concisely sums it up:
"[Undoing border imperialism would mean a freer society for everyone
since borders are the nexus of most systems of oppression]{.underline}."

### AT: Borders are solid

#### Borders are a changing and undefined metric

The expansive [understanding of borders and boundaries in recent
scholarship has enriched border studies, but it has **also obscured what
a border is**]{.underline}**.** This set of interventions is motivated
by a need for a more sophisticated conceptualization of borders in light
of the recent trajectories of border scholarship. In contrast to the
much-feted "borderless world" of the early 1990s, the trend during the
past decade has been to consider the exercise of state sovereignty at
great distances from the border line itself as "bordering". Indeed,
Balibar's (1998) notion that "borders are everywhere "that the sovereign
state's loci of bordering practices can no longer be isolated to the
lines of a political map of states has gained tremendous currency but it
is also quite a departure from traditional border studies. Thus the
broad question posed to our contributors was: [Where is the border in
border studies? The first decade of the twenty-first century saw
substantial growth and diffusion of scholarly work in border studies in
geography and beyond.]{.underline} This can be seen as partly a reaction
to naïve, post-Cold War "borderless" world discourses and partly a
response to clarion calls of the late 1990s for more attention to
borders as the sum of social, cultural, and political processes, rather
than simply as fixed lines (for a recent review of this body of
literature, see Parker et al., 2009). Some of the emergent work
continued long-standing interest in the role of international political
borders in the still dominant territorial order of the sovereign state
system (O'Dowd, 2010). [This work drew inspiration from the disjuncture
between the notion of a **borderless world through globalization** and
the reality of **increased border securitization** as part of the "**war
on terror**", economic protectionism, and anti-immigration
sentiments]{.underline}. Along these line[s, scholars have analyzed
changes at political borders such as new border fences (Jones, 2009b),
biometric passports (Amoore, 2006), increased violence at the border
(van Houtum & Boedeltje, 2009),]{.underline} and expanded security
practices at airports and border crossings (Salter, 2008; Sparke, 2006).
Much of the bordering work that marks some bodies as legitimate and
others as out of place happens far from the political border itself
through document procurement, data monitoring (Amoore, 2007),
immigration raids (Coleman, 2009), offshore detention facilities
(Mountz, 2010a), and exclusionary narratives in media and popular
culture (Spoonley & Butcher, 2009). Geographers have focused our
attention on the technologization of borders and visualization practices
(Amoore, 2009), on cognitive boundaries of categories (Jones, 2009a),
and on the relationships between "traditional" borders and the so-called
borderless world of networked, topological space (Paasi, 2009). External
[drivers of border studies have included strong institutional support of
the topic of borders, especially by the European Union. Not
surprisingly, then, the increasing permeability of internal borders of
the EU but the simultaneous reterritorialization of state power has been
an important aspect of **recent scholarship,** particularly around the
topic of transboundary cooperation (Johnson, 2009; Kramsch & Hooper,
2004; Popescu, 2008).]{.underline} The conflicting logics of "national"
borders and "supranational" unity have often complicated attempts at
cooperation at the border line (Sidaway, 2001). Border studies in the EU
have also shown [that "new" European borders, especially the external
borders of the Union, are in some ways no less hard than their internal
predecessors, and indeed have become fairly "sharp" markers of
difference (Scott & van Houtum, 2009). Geography by no means has
monopolized border studies. Recent important contributions from **IR and
political sociology** focus on the diffusion of **border security**
discourses (Salter, 2010)]{.underline}, "[virtual
biopolitics]{.underline}" (Vaughan-Williams, 2010), and the movement of
borders into cyberspace (Deibert & Rohozinski, 2010). Questions about
the appropriate spatial scales of border studies have also featured
prominently in recent years: asking whether the evidence of the
performance of the border is best found in cities (e.g. Jirón, 2010) or
in the actions of non-state actors ranging from vigilantes to
entrepreneurs who do borderwork, such as petitioning for an exclusive
regional labeling, to improve their business (Doty, 2007; Rumford,
2006). [**Borders are** also **alive** and well in cultural studies,
such as in work on borders as sites of cultural encounter with the
"other" (Rovisco, 2010), and in philosophy, particularly on the
relationship between citizenship and borders in Europe (Balibar,
2009).]{.underline} In light of the rich-but-diffuse recent history of
border scholarship, the contributors to this set of interventions put
forth possibilities for a more coherent, interdisciplinary agenda for
border studies focusing on the interconnected themes of place,
performance, and perspective. Although the spatiality of borders has
undergone shifts in recent decades, [it is nevertheless still important
to consider the **place of borders in border studies**, i.e. where do we
look for evidence of bordering practices and what are the impacts on
particular places?]{.underline} The places of bordering have expanded
well away from the border line itself to non-descript office parks and
cyberspace just as risk assessment at the border has become pre-emptive
in what Louise Amoore describes as "spatial stretching" and "temporal
orientation". As Alison Mountz will show[, political geographers must
continue to interrogate the material manifestations of borders,
particularly the relocation and reconstitution of unconventional border
sites offshore]{.underline} and to sites internal to sovereign
territory. Borders are enacted, materialized, and performed in a variety
of ways. Mark Salter suggests that the performativity of borders
increasingly resembles Butler's (1988) idea of "stylized repetition of
acts". Building on analyses of the narrative construction of statecraft,
including borders, that has been at the center of critical geopolitics
for two decades, recent work suggests how border studies can be enriched
by focusing on the performative aspects of borders by state and
non-state actors. Borders are, according to Paasi, enacted and performed
not only as "discursive or emotional landscapes of social power" on the
one hand, but also as "technical landscapes of control and surveillance"
on the other. Another concern for border scholars is how best to gain
access to the border methodologically, or which perspectives provide the
most fruitful openings to borders and borderwork. Just as the "where"
question is complicated by unconventional border sites, the seemingly
simple question of "who borders?" entails an increasingly complex answer
since bordering practices are less and less the exclusive domain of the
state and its agents. Indeed, as several contributors point out, a range
of private actors including media, businesses, and citizens is involved
in the daily work of making borders. "The sovereign decisions of the
border", as Amoore describes, are as likely to be made by programmers
and mathematicians who write computer code as they are by uniformed
border agents. According to Mountz, gaining access to borders may
therefore entail smarter use of geography's sophisticated methodological
tools such as GIS, cartography, ethnography, and Participatory Action
Research. Conceptually, it may also be useful to move scholars away from
"seeing like a state" (a constraining lens given the increasing
heterotopia of contemporary borders) and toward "seeing like a border",
as Rumford proposes. Such a shift in emphasis would allow scholars to
disaggregate the state and the border in order to conceptualize the
multiple actors and sites of borderwork. To this list of three 'p's'
could be added a fourth: political[. The **shifting nature of borders**
has made them neither less politicized, nor lessened the need for
scholars to be mindful and critical of the complicated
relationship]{.underline} between state power and space and the fact
that this relationship is perhaps most apparent at borders, wherever
they are found. Indeed, collectively these [interventions put forth
possibilities for an ever more robust agenda for scholarly inquiry into
borders while highlighting the need for any border scholar to accompany
the ongoing transformations of state power with critical and politically
attuned eyes.]{.underline}

[This book explores and maps the relationship between borders, security
and global governance]{.underline}. Theoretically, [the book seeks to
establish to what degree, and in what ways, traditional notions of
borders, security and (global) governance are being eroded, undermined
and contested in the context of a globalising world]{.underline}.
[Borders are increasingly being reconceptualised to account for
connectivity as well as divisions]{.underline}, at the same time as
[focus is shifting from permanence to permeability]{.underline}. The
ambivalence ascribed to bordering processes is at heart a security
concern; borders are not only entwined with state formation but are also
attempts at governing securities, identities and histories. Proceeding
from a critical rendering of statist conceptualisations of borders,
security and governance, [the book]{.underline} not only emphasises the
politics of borders, mobility and relocations, but also [provides a
shared groundwork for interrogating the spatial conditions for bordering
and border work as manifestations of a continuously deferred becoming
rather than being]{.underline}. A principal contribution of the volume
is its [scrutiny of how borders are enacted and perceived in and through
the everyday]{.underline}, and of how such production and construal can
make sense as acts of resistance to various forms of governing. Such a
focus reveals the necessity of investigating how governing from afar
affects the possibilities and tendencies to securitise as well as
desecuritise, within as well as beyond elite settings. This book will be
of much interest to students of border studies, human geography,
governmentality, global governance and IR/critical security studies.

FIRST POACH, THEN SCRAMBLE: A GEOECONOMIC ARCTIC [Ever since Europeans
fi rst made contact with the Arctic, a range of "explor- ers, traders,
sailors and scholars have all played their part in promoting the
interests of various states and companies in **mapping**, exploiting,
admin- istering and **controlling** Northern spaces such as
the]{.underline} Northwest Passage and the [Arctic Ocean]{.underline}."
5,6 [Like most other areas of the High Arctic, the Svalbard archipelago
was long mythologise]{.underline}d as an unknown, inaccessible, and
forbidden land; as a remote, wild, [and often "**othered**"
frontier]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} in turn [made it the object of
various colonialist "**scrambles**"]{.underline} (Borgerson 2008;
Craciun 2009; Dodds and Nuttall 2016; Sale and Potapov 2010). In recent
years, Svalbard has become important both in and for the Great Games of
national, international, and transnational relations. Despite the
geographical remoteness of many of the territories that make up the
[Arctic]{.underline} on a circumpolar level, these individual
[spaces]{.underline}, much like the region as a whole[, are now embedded
within the global economic and political system]{.underline}. As
[scholars of the postcolonial moment have pointed out, the region has
largely been framed discursively by those from **elsewhere**, among them
"the scientists who study it, the politicians who want to control it,
\[and\] the oilmen who want to exploit it]{.underline}" (Anderson 2009:
9; see also Chap. 1 of this volume). Indeed, [the Arctic is also
emerging not just as a space **of** geopolitics, but **for** geopolitics
as well]{.underline} (Dittmer et al. 2011), which is to say that [it has
become as much a space for geopolitical actors to play and perform
sovereignty games as it has for geopolitically minded scholars to carry
out critical research]{.underline} about them. While geopolitically
important regions such as the Arctic are "neither self-evident spaces
nor straightforward categories," they do still manage to "create and
recreate confi gurations of people, objects, practices, sites and
affect." 7 [Today's Arctic scrambles in many ways differ little from
those of yesterday, or indeed those of a century or two
ago.]{.underline} [One sees similar tropes, relationships, and processes
reproduced]{.underline}, as Klaus Dodds and Mark Nuttall have recently
noted: "[As earlier European explorers sought to accumu- late knowledge
about trade winds, harbors, oceanic passages and resource potential, so
contemporary actors scramble to acquire a greater under- standing of
navigation potential, ecosystem vulnerabilities and resource
availability]{.underline}." 8 [But scrambles are important to think
about critically because they refl ect and create new **geometries of
power**]{.underline}---[inequalities between places]{.underline} that
are produced "[as a consequence of their positioning and rela- tionship
to other places, relationships and power-geometries]{.underline}." 9

### AT: Indigenous Maps Good

#### State-based cartography engages in a politics of recognition that consolidates state power through maintaining disciplinary and territorial boundaries

Cartographies." *Cultural Geographies*, vol. 16, no. 2, 2009, pp. 147-,

Participatory mapping in indigenous landscapes, whether to support
indigenous claims for territorial rights or to facilitate more
\'participatory\' management of state-controlled lands, are inherently
interventionist, political projects that shape relations of power in
unpredictable and sometimes paradoxical ways. Besides the obvious social
ramifications of map-making with and/or for indigenous people --- such
as the cultural consequences of technology transfer, the likelihood of
changing or reinscribing uneven social relations in communities being
\'mapped,\' and the vexing question of ownership, access to and
legibility of maps --- **[indigenous cartographies
articulate]{.underline}** in different ways with the multiple, shifting
**[relations of power]{.underline}** that traverse indigenous
landscapes. The mapping process is thus of utmost importance for
indigenous leaders, theorists, develop-ment practitioners and others who
share a commitment to indigenous rights, but who also assume a critical
perspective on the possibilities and pitfalls of map-making in and for
indigenous communities. The power of maps\' derive in part **[from
their]{.underline}** **[rhetorical weight, most specifically from
their]{.underline}** **[ability to abstract]{.underline}**
**[complex]{.underline}** and fluctuating **[and]{.underline}**
[socially contingent spatial relationships]{.underline} [and make these
representations seem inevitable, common-sensical, and]{.underline}
[commensurate with **hegemonic conceptualizations of
territorial**]{.underline} **[and property]{.underline}**
**[relationships.]{.underline}** However, **[mapping projects
driven]{.underline}** **[wholly or in part]{.underline}**
**[by]{.underline}** **[such processes of]{.underline}**
**[abstraction,]{.underline}** which in turn are shaped by statist
requirements for spatial fixity, precision, and cartographic
\'accuracy,\' **[inevitably]{.underline}** **[effect violence
to]{.underline}** **[the]{.underline}** fluid, shifting, and socially
**[contingent nature of lived,]{.underline}** **[indigenous spatial
relationships]{.underline}**. Ultimately, by abstracting and thus
concealing the complex, lived spaces of indigenous peoples,
**[counter-mapping]{.underline}** may **[increase,]{.underline}** rather
than weaken, **[state control of indigenous lands]{.underline}**. It is
this dilemma that is the focus of the current special issue of Cultural
geographies. The papers presented here originated in the conference,
\'Indigenous Cartographies and Representational Politics,\' hosted by
the Society for the Humanities at Cornell University in 2005 and
attended by indigenous activists, elders, scholars, and GIS
practitioners from Asia, Latin America and North America. The conference
was premised on the need for a critical praxis of indigenous cartography
that does justice to the specificities of indigenous place-making, while
simultaneously harnessing the \'power of maps\' in the service of
indigenous justice. Most specifically, conference presenters, including
the authors in this special issue, considered the ways in which the
(re)production of boundaries articulate with multifaceted, shifting
relations of power, which again shape, and are shaped by, indigenous
mapping projects. The notion that boundaries are not a given but rather
the results of social processes is not new among critical geographers,
especially those writing at the intersection of social theory,
GIScience, postmodern geopolitics, and landscape theory.2 This
perspective on boundary-making informs an important critique of
[participatory]{.underline} [mapping projects]{.underline}: that they
are often [premised on false dualisms --- between nature and
culture]{.underline}, between [indigenous and
non-indigenous,]{.underline} between [scientific and local
knowledge]{.underline} [---]{.underline} and hence unwittingly [produce
fixed, impermeable]{.underline} [boundaries in landscapes defined by
movement,]{.underline} networks, and fluctuating social relationships.
**[Rather than a neutral application of value-free technologies,
map-making is]{.underline}** entangled in the webs of power that shape
indigenous landscapes**[, informed by]{.underline}** contentious
productions of indigenous identities, implicated in the socially
contingent nature of knowledge systems, and shaped by **[the
positionality of the (most typically western) scientists who direct
indigenous mapping projects.]{.underline}** Although these concerns are
receiving increasing attention in the field of indigenous
cartographies,3 **[participatory mapping is still most typically talked
about as a technical problem,]{.underline}** where the most prevalent
question is how to most effectively and \'accurately\' represent such
essentialized, place-based identities in fixed, two-dimensional
Cartesian space. In contrast, Joel Wainwright and Joe Bryan see
map-making in indigenous landscapes as a political more than a technical
process. The central question, they postulate, is under what conditions
does mapping become possible and politically imperative? They take as
their points of departure two important, precedent-setting legal cases
for indigenous property (rather than territorial) land rights: the Awas
Tingni case in eastern Nicaragua and the case of the Maya villages of
Conejo and Santa Cruz in the Toledo District of Belize. [Although the
Inter-American Court in its ruling in 2001 affirmed the property rights
of the Mayangna people]{.underline} [of Awas Tingni]{.underline}, and
the Belize Supreme Court in 2007 ruled that the Maya communities had
property rights to their lands based on customary usufruct, [no progress
has been made towards actually granting effective land
rights]{.underline} to these communities. Instead, Wainwright and Bryan
suggest that [the \'cartographic-legal\' strategy of these court
cases]{.underline} **[has reinscribed state power as a guarantor of
\'property]{.underline}**.\' **[By]{.underline}** fixing and **[making
visible the boundaries of indigenous land based on]{.underline}**
**[hegemonic, specifically]{.underline}** **[instrumental-legal notions
of indigeneity, these cases]{.underline}** **[validated state
territoriality]{.underline}** and thus, paradoxically, deepened state
hegemony in these very same indigenous lands. Nevertheless, indigenous
cartographies are not necessarily \'good\' or \`bad;\' rather, an
effective counter-cartography is one that \'unsettles the very
categories that constitute the intelligibility of modern power
relations\' (Wainwright and Bryan, this issue), including western
concepts of \'boundaries.\"This returns us to the question of conditions
(and not in the sense of technical limitations, skills, logistics, and
so on); rather, we are speaking here of the social conditions that make
this unsettling possible and hence makes map-making desirable

[The Anthropocene is the geological age in which human impact on earth
systems has become irreversible and will be detectable far into the
future. It is therefore the greatest challenge currently facing life on
earth. Its effects are omnipresent: ocean acidification, deforestation,
the loss of species diversity through extinction, changes to the earth's
surface due to population migration and alterations to geomorphology,
global warming and much more.]{.underline} Describing these changes as
indicators of a new geological epoch acknowledges the unprecedented and
planetary magnitude of human impact on the earth's ecosystems and
geochemistry. [Anthropogenic climate change is but one of the sites of
human impact and its dispersed effects demonstrate the complex and
interrelated nature of our current socio-ecological moment.]{.underline}
[Climate change manifests in gradual statistical shifts in temperature
averages and extremes, more frequent droughts, storms, wildfire and
flooding, and the impacts of these increased fluctuations on the oceans
and ice sheets, the most alarming of these being rising sea
levels]{.underline}. The year 2015 was the hottest ever and 2016 is set
to be hotter. Except for 1998, the fifteen hottest years on record are
of this century. The UK's Met Office confirms the earth has now crossed
the threshold towards a global average 1 degree Celsius higher than
preindustrial times. November 2015 also saw the United Nations Climate
Change Conference in Paris, which reminds us that the Anthropocene is an
urgent geopolitical issue that is both local and global, and which has
galvanised international governments as well as public sentiment. Most
scientists warn, however, that even the hardwon consensus on cutting
carbon emissions at Paris will not be able to stop the warming of the
earth by 4 degrees over the next century.

[Climate change therefore presents a dispersed and enduring problem of
such scale that it becomes]{.underline}, according to Timothy Clark
(2015), [unreadable]{.underline}. Timothy Morton (2013) calls it [a
primary example of a 'hyperobject', an assembling of elements so complex
and distributed that it challenges the post-Kantian definition of
'object'.]{.underline} [However, this insistence on ineffability and
opacity restrains the kind of thinking necessary to confront the
disastrous earth scenarios that are being predicted for the twenty-first
century.]{.underline} Global human society has arrived at a pivotal
moment in the production of scientific, political and philosophical
subjectivity. [The urgency and opportunity of engaging with the
Anthropocene is clear in the unprecedented pace at which public,
political and philosophical debates about climate change are
developing]{.underline} and intensifying.

However, there is a stark disjuncture between the material
manifestations of the Anthropocene and our capacity to conceptualise it
temporally. Dating the 'golden spike' of the Anthropocene, or the
boundary marker between the Holocene and this new geological epoch,
requires a stratigraphic signal of global and permanent change in
geological material (such as rocks or ice cores). Attributing this trace
of the human -- its scarring of the earth -- to one date has proved to
be contentious, with a range of dates currently being debated.
Atmospheric chemist Paul Crutzen and Eugene Stoermer (2000), in an
influential piece widely considered to be the conceptual arrival of the
Anthropocene, locate the onset of the Anthropocene in the late
eighteenth century with the Industrial Revolution, specifically with the
invention by James Watt of the steam engine, which they date to 1784
(see also Crutzen's piece in Nature, 2002). More recently, Simon Lewis
and Mark Maslin (2015) have proposed the 'Orbis hypothesis' dating the
beginning of the Anthropocene to the year 1610. They reject dating the
Anthropocene all the way back to the end of the last Ice Age
(Pleistocene), when humans in many places caused a significant mass
extinction event through the use of fire and hunting, mainly of
megafauna (mammoth, moa, etc.). Lewis and Maslin also reject dating the
advent of the Anthropocene to the development and spread of agriculture,
however much it changed ecosystems from about 10,000 years ago. They
take 1610, which they call the 'Orbis spike', as start-date of the
Anthropocene because the dip in atmospheric carbon that occurred that
year was directly caused by the most important demographic and economic
shift in the history of the human species, the European colonisation of
the Americas. Through genocide, war, displacement and pandemics, the
great societies of Native Americans -- anywhere from 2 to 18 million in
North America, and at least 37 million in South America, the figures
being perhaps the most contentious in demography -- were cut by 90 per
cent over the long sixteenth century (see Mann 2005). Contrary to myth,
the largest societies were urban and agricultural. The most viable
explanation for the dip in atmospheric carbon detectable in ice cores is
the massive reforestation of the Americas in the wake of the decimation
(literally) of the indigenous population. Without farming and hunting
there were more trees and therefore less atmospheric carbon dioxide. The
most astonishing fact of the process of wiping away most human cultures
and their ecosystems from two continents is that it measurably altered
the composition of the planet's atmosphere. After 1610, population
increase through immigration and steady deforestation made carbon
dioxide rise again.

Hence the fundamental shifts in the global distribution of biota through
the movement of plant and animal species between the Old and New Worlds
and the opening of global trade routes as well as the lasting political
implications of colonialism are what led Lewis and Maslin to favour 1610
over 1776, the year Watt put his steam engine to use. After all, as
Marxists have long argued, industrialisation in Europe required the
wealth accumulated through slave labour and raw materials made possible
through the colonisation of the Americas. Lewis and Maslin do not deny
the so-called Great Acceleration of economic production, mining, waste,
transportation and the use of nuclear energy from 1945 onwards, but see
it as less decisive than the Columbian Exchange. From the mid-twentieth
century, a growing number of stratigraphers suggest, there have been
rapid changes to ecosystems everywhere, including the Arctic and
Antarctic, and a massive increase in the extraction of fossil fuels,
metals and minerals, parallel to the growth in global population. The
post-war world has also been the nuclear age. Another date being
proposed as the origin for the age of humans is 1964 because of
stratigraphic evidence of a peak in radionuclides from the testing of
nuclear weapons (Waters et al. 2016). A starting date of 1945 or 1964
seems to be emerging as the front runner with the Anthropocene Working
Group of the Subcommission on Quaternary Stratigraphy, who are currently
deliberating whether the Anthropocene can be ratified as an official
geological era and where it would fit in the geological timescale.

[The decision of the working group is bound to be hotly debated in
popular, scientific and political discourse.]{.underline} This special
issue of Deleuze Studies argues that [philosophy and cultural theory
should join that debate]{.underline}. The stakes have never been higher
because, as Waters et al. (2016) suggest, 'Not only would this represent
the first instance of a new epoch having been witnessed first-hand by
advanced human societies, it would be one stemming from the consequences
of their own doing'. [At stake is nothing less than the understanding of
the impact of the human species on its planet: will it be a story of
empire and genocide, or of the 'dark side' of industrial and scientific
progress, or of capitalist and consumerist greed, or of unleashing the
potentially catastrophic subatomic powers of the universe?]{.underline}
What will the dating of the Anthropocene reveal about responsibility?
How will this unifying narrative of the human as a species navigate
racial and cultural difference? After all, whose history is being writ
large as the new narrative about the planet? What will become of key
political-philosophical notions such as universality, destiny,
community, equality, sustainability and the nation-state? What will be
done with the traditional conception of 'nature' in Western thought?
However, no matter where the line demarcating the material Anthropocene
is officially drawn, its meteoric career as a concept shows it will be
an obligatory passage point for critical thinking.

Rapidly gaining currency after Crutzen and Stoermer's use of the term
(2000), the Anthropocene has emerged as the ultimate but also intimate
conceptual horizon with which we need to grapple in this new century.
The dramatic difference in timescales between the geophysical
Anthropocene and the onset of its conceptualisation itself suggests the
humanities have to radically alter their approach to temporality. As
Nigel Clark (2010) has argued, we have only just started the
intellectual work that a changing earth is requiring from us. It is
overwhelmingly clear that the Anthropocene will have a profound impact
on philosophy, shocking it out of anthropocentric complacency and the
accustomed ways of thinking which situate the human apart from nature.
The Anthropocene disrupts thought itself, requiring that we return to
the question of the place of the human species in the cosmos: a third
Copernican Revolution after that of Kant and Copernicus. Postcolonial
theorist Dipesh Chakrabarty says it signals a 'profound change in the
human condition' (Chakrabarty 2012: 15), as the human species has been
discovered to have been a nonhuman force shaping the earth systems which
are its very milieu. As one of the first in the humanities, Chakrabarty
understood the profound impact climate change will have had on the
humanities insofar as they were for centuries systematically premised on
excluding nature from the play of deliberately directed forces we call
history. With this repositioning of the human, however, any erstwhile
conceptual distinction between 'natural history' and the history of
human societies has more or less collapsed. While agitating for the
place of the humanities in debates about the Anthropocene, this special
issue also asks whether discrete humanities frameworks are sufficient to
think through the enormity of the Anthropocene. In contrast to the
humanities and the social sciences, [Deleuze and Guattari have always
known that 'society' and 'history' are not simply human
products.]{.underline} This special issue is therefore motivated by the
nonhuman turn and by the potential that it has for destabilising the
conventional organisation of the disciplines. It acknowledges, as
Elizabeth Grosz so succinctly suggests, that [the 'humanities requires a
recognition not only of the politics of the human that informs and
produces knowledge of the human; but also of the ontological forces of
the nonhuman that press the human from both within and
outside']{.underline} (Grosz in Roffe and Stark 2015b: 23).

Conceptually, as we come to reconcile ourselves to human impact on the
environment at a planetary scale, the Anthropocene is shaping
philosophical understandings of the human and its place in a broader
nonhuman context. The human emerges as an ambivalent figure in the
Anthropocene. The question of whether there could be a 'good' and not
'bad' Anthropocene endows humans with an immense and unprecedented
agency in their relationship to the earth, positioning us as accountable
to future generations for past actions and present inaction. We should
beware of the fact that this moral dimension tends to offer little more
than a biblical version of human stewardship as ostensible solution for
the catastrophic futures that scientists are alarmed about. It has
precisely been such selfish anthropocentrism, and its most vicious
avatar, capital, that landed the species in this predicament in the
first place. If the risks embedded in the Anthropocene conceptually
unify the human as a species desiring food, energy, art and a minimum of
groundedness, it also brings into relief the ways in which a violent
earth further fissures humanity along economic, racial and sexual axes.
Anthropocene anxiety manifests itself variously in reassessments of the
entanglements of the human and the nonhuman, the continuing breakdown of
the subject/object distinction, and an increasingly popular rethinking
of the human body in the context of becomings-animals, -plant and
-mineral. The Anthropocene likewise reminds us of the necessity to think
at more-than-human scales. It has required that we consider deep time as
well as vast space, reflecting in the process on the inevitability of
human extinction and the hypothesis of an earth without or after us. As
geologists like Jan Zalasiewicz (2009) are inviting us to consider, what
worlds are there before, beyond and after human time and thought?

It is unsurprising that the crisis of thought engendered by the
Anthropocene has also prompted an invigoration of theory in general and
of poststructuralism in particular. The concept of the Anthropocene has
triggered an explosion of ethical and highly political theorising
through the 'posthumanist' redeployment of phenomenology,
deconstruction, psychoanalysis, philosophy of science and literary
theory. Theory has the potential to render the Anthropocene
'meaningful'. A cultural accounting of the Anthropocene is imperative
because if the 'problems' addressed by scientific research are
constituted through cultural, social and political processes, then the
Anthropocene is a problem that is social and discursive as well as
scientific. Cultural texts such as theory not only reflect but also
construct dominant attitudes to the environment. Taking stock of
theoretical engagements with the Anthropocene is essential to building a
picture of the complex web of significances -- material, philosophical,
scientific, ethical, political, textual -- of a social and environmental
problem that both confounds us and calls us to action.

This special issue is interested in the conceptual resources that Gilles
Deleuze, who died before the conceptual arrival of the Anthropocene,
might offer in this time of profound environmental and epistemic crisis.
Most importantly, [Deleuze's work provides us with tools that help us to
overcome the problematic anthropocentrism of Western philosophical
systems]{.underline}. This can be contextualised with the well-known
debate around humanism in France after the Second World War. The
undisputed master, who offered philosophical resources to put into
perspective the profound disturbance to man's erstwhile implacable
belief in his own progress after Auschwitz and Hiroshima, was Sartre. In
Existentialism is a Humanism he writes, ['although it is impossible to
find in every man a universal essence that could be said to comprise
human nature, there is nonetheless a universal human
condition']{.underline} (Sartre 2007: 42). The almost-absolute horrors
of worldwide war had shown that humans, being determined by the blind
march of history and the rest of the universe, cannot take anything for
granted, certainly not that the future will be better than the past.
[There is no essence of man which would guarantee progress and reason,
as is posited by the Renaissance, the Enlightenment and liberalism. In
the face of this void at the heart of the human condition it is
immensely difficult, but at the same time indispensable, to achieve
universality and truth.]{.underline}

In 1964, Deleuze came out strongly in admiration of Sartre's refusal of
the Nobel Prize for Literature. In an otherwise increasingly 'conformist
moral order', Deleuze admired how the older philosopher's decision
reflected a strong belief in philosophy's political role: 'Sartre allows
us to await some vague future moment, a return, when thought will form
again and make its totalities anew, like a power that is at once
collective and private' (Deleuze 2004: 79). Although he calls Sartre for
this reason his 'teacher' in philosophy, Deleuze remained suspicious
about the notion of man. In fact, much of his early work should be seen
as an indirect critique of Sartrean humanism (see for instance the very
early essay 'Description of Woman' (Deleuze 2002)). When most of the
French intellectual scene was steeped in phenomenology and a revival of
Hegel, Deleuze turned to Hume, Bergson and Nietzsche to explore the
habitual contractions of impersonal forces at the basis of the human,
and which humans share with animals. As his project was taking shape in
the 1960s, Deleuze had political and ontological affinities with a
general move away from existentialism through the importation of
structural linguistics into anthropology (Lévi-Strauss), psychoanalysis
(Lacan) Marxism (Althusser) and philosophy (Derrida and Foucault) (see
Deleuze's sympathetic critique 'How Do We Recognize Structuralism?'
(Deleuze 2004: 170--92)). Even if he arrived at antihumanism from
different sources, [Deleuze was part of a larger generation in France
whose revolutionary impetus derived to a significant extent from a
denunciation of the category of man as the source of history, knowledge
and praxis.]{.underline}

A critique of human exceptionalism and humanist essentialism does not
necessarily mean dissolving the specificity of the human into a
freeflowing, all-encompassing and chaoid Life (Roffe and Stark 2015a).
In fact, Deleuze and Guattari agree with the humanist tradition that it
is incumbent on thought to examine reality from within the
intractabilities and ambiguities of the human perspective. They are
heirs to the Enlightenment in critiquing the structures and prejudices
that thwart human flourishing and in examining the conditions of
possibility for something genuinely new to emerge. [At every point in
their work, Deleuze and Guattari clearly distinguish the ethical
exigencies that accompany being human, whether sketching an agenda in
What is Philosophy? for philosophy, art and science or mapping the
strata of the earth -- physicochemical, biological and alloplastic or
anthropic -- in A Thousand Plateaus, whether naming thought and matter
the two attributes of infinite reality following Spinoza, or proposing a
theory of more-than-human assemblages as continually open to
micropolitics]{.underline} (Deleuze and Guattari 1994, 1987). [Those
critics are wrong who fear that Deleuze and Guattari demolish
anthropocentrism simply to lodge discourse onto an omnivorous
eclecticism mushing all processes and entities on the same horizontal
plane of ceaseless interpenetration, where nothing is stable enough to
demand political or epistemic commitment.]{.underline} On the contrary,
[A Thousand Plateaus provides an ontology which,]{.underline} with an
unprecedented precision as well as a revolutionary ethos, [maps the
singular dependency of the human species on many layers of material
flows from weaponry to order-words, barely held together in a capitalist
system currently going into spirals of self-destruction.]{.underline}

Hence Deleuze is far from pre-Kantian. He reads Hume after Kant, naming
his new method a transcendental empiricism. He also reads Spinoza after
Kant, and argues God-or-nature, or the Plane of Immanence, is not
transcendent to the things and ideas 'in' it. Getting rid of
anthropocentrism does not mean getting rid of Kant's critical and
transcendental turn. Deleuze wholeheartedly supports modern philosophy's
prerogative to endlessly reframe the question of what humans are to do
with the uncanny fact they are part of, yet separate from, the rest of
the universe. Deleuze's antihumanism is quite different, then, from
recent anti-Kantian developments like speculative realism, which aim to
replace the humanist and critical legacies with serene indifference, and
even explicit nihilism. On a different front, Deleuze would have no time
for those radical ecologists who argue the human species is but a skin
disease of the Gaia hyper-organism. Within this framework, disastrous
positive feedback loops of atmospheric and toxic havoc will lead to a
sixth mass extinction, a catastrophic fever after which the earth will
regain 'her' health in the absence of the human. The post-Heideggerian
return to the question of technology under the banner of 'posthumanism'
has another emphasis than the stratigraphic framework of A Thousand
Plateaus mapping the larger inhuman systems subtending the aggregates
and flows of the human species. [Deleuze and Guattari's ontology of the
imbrication of the human in the nonhuman is materialist and
geographical, revolving around capitalism, the state, the family, racism
and other social territorialisations as explanatory factors. Instead of
thinking at the levels of an abstract individual subject or humanity as
such, Deleuze and Guattari return to the old ethical question of
philosophy, which posits that life is, from the beginning, collective
and political.]{.underline}

[Guattari's therapeutic work, political engagements and solo-authored
writings are central to the Anthropocene politics]{.underline} that we
are deriving from Deleuze's work. [Guattari's politics is]{.underline},
of course, far more explicit than Deleuze's own, [aiming specifically to
rework communism by emphasising subjectivity and creativity after the
catastrophic dead ends of the Cold War, the Soviet system, Maoism and
ultra-left terrorism]{.underline} (Guattari and Negri 1990). Almost
alone amongst the key theorists associated with May 1968 (Foucault,
Lefebvre, Marcuse, etc.), Guattari came to understand the looming
environmental crisis (then mostly associated with local chemical
pollution) as a fundamental challenge to the left. Against narrow-minded
environmentalism, his machinic ecology starts with a world-systems
analysis of systematic impoverishment on a variety of scales. The Three
Ecologies, his clearest statement on green politics from 1989, starts:
'The Earth is undergoing a period of intense techno-scientific
transformations. If no remedy is found, the ecological disequilibrium
this has generated will ultimately threaten the continuation of life on
the planet's surface' (Guattari 2008: 19). Guattari distinguishes
between three interwoven ecologies: social ecology, subjective ecology
and environmental ecology. At one point he has a remarkable premonition
of the disastrous economic and political times to come:

In the field of social ecology, men like Donald Trump are permitted to
proliferate freely, like another species of algae, taking over entire
districts of New York and Atlantic City; he 'redevelops' by raising
rents, thereby driving out tens of thousands of poor families, most of
whom are condemned to homelessness, becoming the equivalent of the dead
fish environmental ecology. Further proliferation is evident in the
savage deterritorialization of the Third World, which simultaneously
affects the cultural texture of its populations, its habitat, its immune
systems, climate, etc. \[. . . \] How do we regain control of such an
auto-destructive and potentially catastrophic situation? (Guattari 2008:
29)

Guattari might point out that in the preoccupation with how computers
will save humanity, theorists forget that 1.2 billion people have no
electricity at all -- and perhaps have no need for it. [The only
possible response to an economic system bent on destroying itself and
its milieu through endless proliferation and displacement is to replace
it with another.]{.underline} How exactly to get to such a new system is
still unclear, but [Guattari provides at least some conceptual
innovations to map the global situation.]{.underline}

Apart from the ecosophical approach of The Three Ecologies, [Guattari
also develops a radically new sense of cartography]{.underline}. The
formalism of [Schizoanalytic Cartographies]{.underline} (Guattari 2013)
is vertiginous, perhaps to the point of being useless for further
application, but the book does [demonstrate how understanding the
predicament of global capitalist society]{.underline} (what Guattari
from the early 1970s calls Integrated World Capitalism) [has to be
multiscalar and historical and must develop a strong sense of emergence,
system and chaos in the sense physics gives those terms]{.underline}.
Finally, inspired by Lewis Mumford's (1967--70) famous notion of
megamachine (the hierarchical organisation of humans like cogs in a
bigger machine, paradigmatic examples being the pharaonic pyramid, the
Taylorist factory and the nuclear militaryindustrial apparatus),
Guattari introduces the term 'mechanosphere' as a name for the
planet-wide intermeshing of mechanical, architectural and biological
processes (see Saldanha 2015). Given his interest in world history,
Guattari would no doubt be fascinated with the recent turn to 'big
history', blending environmental history with astronomy, geology and
evolutionary biology under the aegis of complexity theory (see for
example Spier 2015). However, even Guattari's machinism at times slips
back into an anthropocentric technological determinism and even
Malthusianism as he negotiates the difficult terrain of worst-case
scenarios and the calls of mainstream science for geo-engineering:

Natural equilibriums will be increasingly reliant upon human
intervention, and a time will come when vast programmes will need to be
set up in order to regulate the relationship between oxygen, ozone and
carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere. We might as well rename
environmental ecology machinic ecology, because Cosmic and human praxis
has only ever been a question of machines, even, dare I say it, of war
machines. From time immemorial 'nature' has been at war with life! The
pursuit of mastery over the mechanosphere will have to begin immediately
if the acceleration of technoscientific progress and the pressure of
huge population increases are to be dealt with. (Guattari 2008: 43)

The mechanosphere can be called Guattari's name for the Anthropocene, or
the biosphere in the time of irreversible human impact, provided this
tendency towards technological determinism is bypassed. With the benefit
of more science and popular debate, it is now becoming clear that
neither climate change nor other Anthropocene disasters can be
'engineered away'. Overconsumption not overpopulation is the earth's
problem, and if 'vast programmes' are indeed necessary, their
experimentation will be political and social, not simply
techno-scientific. From Guattari's own critique of reductionism,
technoscience cannot have a monopoly on addressing environmental
problems even if it forms an integral part of the conversation.

[Ultimately, what Deleuze and Guattari hope for]{.underline} in A
Thousand Plateaus and What is Philosophy? [is the creation of a 'new
earth' and 'new peoples', returning to an old messianic and
revolutionary trope]{.underline}. Leaving the content somewhat vague,
[they call for collective self-invention in the interstices of existing
political formations]{.underline}. [Against the traditional belief in a
transcendent essence of a people (a nation, a state, a race or indeed a
class), a 'return to the earth' requires an immanentism, which reorders
a revolutionary collectivity according to the present problems it finds
itself in.]{.underline} What we find when we look again at Deleuze and
Guattari's work, are concepts that [we can push towards an ecological
politics: new ways of imagining living with the earth.]{.underline} In
this context, [the new earth invites us to work collectively towards an
Anthropocene no longer spiralling closer to systemic breakdown and
extinction.]{.underline}

To support this, we begin by establishing the current knowledge dynamics
upheld by scientific research practices. [Acknowledging multiple ways of
knowing the ocean requires recognizing how an individual's perspective
and relationships shape their understanding]{.underline} of marine
environments. Believing, as others studying ocean literacy initiatives
have also highlighted, [that multiple ways of knowing the ocean are
valuable]{.underline} (Lobo & Parsons, 2023; Schwerdtner et al., 2023),

[even the active stepping back of researchers to "make room" for

that must be carefully considered alongside local and Indigenous
peoples, hence the importance of developing interpersonal relationships.

7\. Conclusion [A paradigm shift in how marine research is conducted is
necessary]{.underline}, including special attention to [the role of
ocean literacy in research engagements.]{.underline} The authors wish to
emphasize [the importance of **getting off the boat**, venturing into
communities and building interpersonal relationships with reciprocal
knowledge exchanges]{.underline}. [These practices are key to the
creation of collaborative marine research which respects and recognizes
diverse knowledge systems.]{.underline} By [reconceptualizing the
researcher's role]{.underline} as that of a guest and learner, we [can
foster a more inclusive and comprehensive understanding of ocean
literacy. The case study]{.underline} of marine habitat mapping [in the
**Arctic** demonstrates the **tangible benefits** of this approach,
including locally relevant research outcomes, improved outreach
materials and research results, and enduring relationships with
community members]{.underline}. [This shift not only enhances the
**quality** and relevance of scientific research]{.underline} but [also
addresses **power imbalances** inherent in conventional research
methodologies]{.underline}. In [embracing the values of respect,
engagement, and reciprocity]{.underline} to build relationships,
[researchers can create meaningful ties to local realities and integrate
diverse knowledge]{.underline} systems into their work. By building
relationships in conjunction with the two‐eyed seeing framework,
[multiple ways of knowing the ocean can be uplifted while respecting
local realities]{.underline}. This approach aligns with the UN Ocean
Decade's call for increased ocean literacy and [contributes to a more
holistic understanding of marine environments]{.underline}. [Despite
increasing efforts in ocean science to collaborate with Indigenous
knowledge holders]{.underline} (see Keenan et al., 2018; and Laidler,
2006, for pertinent Arctic examples), our [experiences working in the
Arctic as early career researchers indicate that there is **still work
to do** in applying these conceptual frameworks of relationship building
and two‐eyed seeing in ocean literacy work]{.underline}. As a practical
example, this case study had several notable limitations. Data
collection in 2019 proceeded without community consent, and Inuit
participation was not integrated throughout all research stages, such as
the data analysis. No formal community workshops were conducted, and the
research methodology remained firmly grounded in Western scientific
approaches. While results were translated into the local language,
Indigenous knowledge systems were not meaningfully integrated into the
final analysis. This was evident from the community reaction to the
final maps, as [the predictive modelling of where scallops would be was
already known]{.underline}. Additionally, the high costs of northern
travel and accommodation presented significant barriers to sustained
community engagement, with only about 30 in‐person days in the community
over two years. These limitations [highlight the need for institutional
support and resources to help early career researchers build meaningful
relationships with northern communities]{.underline}. Future [research
should prioritize Indigenous involvement from the outset, integrate
diverse methodologies, and ensure adequate funding]{.underline} for
sustained community engagement throughout the entire research process.
Moving forward, [it is crucial for the scientific community to actively
work towards building relationships]{.underline} that facilitate two‐way
knowledge exchange. For ocean scientists, there are several ways this
can be accomplished throughout the research process. Researchers can
consider learning directly from local knowledge holders, engage local
experts in collaborative research design, or disseminate plain‐language
summaries through appropriate channels (such as community radio
stations), for example. The most crucial aspect in determining the path
towards reciprocity, however, is for researchers to reach out to local
communities with the intention of building a genuine and mutually
respectful relationship. By doing so, a more inclusive and comprehensive
approach to ocean literacy can be created which benefits both
researchers and coastal communities. [In **getting off the boat** and
into communities, we create new opportunities for knowing the ocean for
all.]{.underline}

**Nabok, 22**---Senior Lecturer, Saint Petersburg State University
(Sergey, "Main Theoretical Approaches in the Arctic Policy Studies,"
Arctic and North, 2022, no. 47, pp. 119--135, dml)

In the scientific study of international relations, international
political processes and management systems, the role of theory is
characterized by two specific features that distinguish it from other
social disciplines. Firstly, the actual [political analysis used in the
study of specific issues]{.underline}, [such as]{.underline} state
**[policy]{.underline}**, inter-state relations, or international
institutions, [**rarely** relies on a **well-defined** set of concepts
and propositions that establish key relationships between the phenomena
under study]{.underline}, [is **ad hoc** in nature]{.underline}, [and
claims to **generalize** conclusions]{.underline}. Although theory is an
indispensable element of scientific discourse, its factual usefulness in
political analysis is insignificant, and [theoretical
provisions]{.underline} (which are hypotheses in the epistemological
sense) [are often accepted as **implicit suppositions**]{.underline},
[**without** reflection and critical analysis]{.underline}.

Secondly, as F. Chernoff notes, [the **prescriptive** component is
**extremely important**]{.underline} in the theory of international
relations: [although some theories seek to describe only the
interrelations of phenomena]{.underline}, [theoretical analysis often
goes **beyond** a strict description and **explicitly** or
**implicitly** formulates certain political goals and **normative
criteria** used to **evaluate** a]{.underline} certain actual or
**[hypothetical course of action]{.underline}** \[1, p. 3--4\]. The
latter leads to the fact that political [theory acts as a **discursive
justification** of a certain political model and as a **basis** for a
political narrative that **legitimizes** a certain course of
action]{.underline}.

Let us [consider]{.underline}, for example, a simple theoretical
statement, corresponding to the position of [the **realist**
paradigm]{.underline}: "[The **only** type of actors whose actions
**matter** for]{.underline} [international politics and]{.underline}
international [relations are **states**]{.underline}". [Taking this
statement as an **implicit** assumption focuses political analysis
**exclusively** on the actions and decisions taken by the highest levels
of state power]{.underline}, without even allowing the question of the
possible role of non-state actors. [If such political analysis is faced
with the need to explain the behavior of **non-state**
actors]{.underline} (for example, NPOs), [they will be interpreted
either as **insignificant** or as **instrumental**]{.underline}, that
is, as [**tools** of state actors' decisions]{.underline}. [If this
theoretical premise becomes the **basis for
policy-making**]{.underline}, [the consequence is that **any meaningful
processes** in]{.underline} **[i]{.underline}**nternational
**[r]{.underline}**elations [have to be interpreted as resulting from
the decisions of **state** actors]{.underline}. Any actions of non-state
actors are construed as being inspired by the governments of other
countries, and the actors themselves are deprived of subjectivity,
including in a practical political sense.

[Such **uncritical acceptance** of theoretical propositions and the
**failure to distinguish** between descriptive and prescriptive
elements]{.underline} of theory [have **important negative
consequences** for both]{.underline} the scientific
**[study]{.underline}** of political processes [and political
**practice**]{.underline}. In a practical sense, [this **incorrectly
evaluates** information]{.underline}, [makes **erroneous
decisions**]{.underline}, [and **narrows the range** of available
behavioral strategies]{.underline}. In analytical terms, [the focus of
attention is **distorted** and the risk of **misinterpretation** of the
observed phenomena **increases**]{.underline}. For example, the
systematic efforts of China to influence the regional policy in the
United States \[2, de La Bruyère D., Pikarsic N.\] in case of uncritical
acceptance of the postulate of the state as the only actor in the world
political arena should be recognized as meaningless and not having
rational justification.

[These problems]{.underline} of the theory of international relations
[are]{.underline} also [typical for the study of the
**Arctic**]{.underline}. The [authors of publications
citing]{.underline} the results of [empirical research and political
analysis do not always rely on **clearly formulated** theoretical
positions and analytical models]{.underline}, [and the descriptive
characteristics of the subject under study]{.underline} (for example,
the Arctic strategy of a particular state) [are **explicitly** or
**implicitly** based on the adoption of certain political
**goals**]{.underline}, in according to which the situation and
decisions are evaluated. At the same time, [**explicitly formulated**
theoretical provisions play an **important role** both in]{.underline}
scientific [**research** and in formulation of **practical
recommendations**]{.underline}. [Theory performs several important
functions]{.underline}: [defines the **focus** of research and the
**specific subjects** to be studied and analyzed]{.underline};
[establishes the **content** and **relationships** between key variables
used for explanation and prediction]{.underline}; [allows to **evaluate
alternative mechanisms** for achieving political goals]{.underline}
(without a priori determination of these goals).

#### The aff is a performance of geopolitics that they cannot sever and should have to defend

More recent work in critical geopolitics has been less wedded to this
trilogy of geopolitics. Instead, [scholars have gravitated towards an
analytical register involving an assemblage-like approach to
performances, imaginaries and practices]{.underline}. Our focus here is
on three core elements that we think enable contemporary forms of
critical geopolitics:

[Performances]{.underline}. This is [the "when and where" of
geopolitics]{.underline}. Our attention is thus directed towards
[timing, choreography and the affective potential of the
geopolitical.]{.underline} Geopolitical [performances such as a
flag-planting episode matter because they occur in particular spaces,
they are carried out by noteworthy actors, and they use highly symbolic
objects]{.underline} such as flags.

[Imaginaries]{.underline}. A social imaginary refers to [the images,
stories and fables which underpin how people imagine their collective
social and political life]{.underline}. [Imaginaries blend fact and
fiction and are tacit rather than explicitly articulated in
societies]{.underline}. [In political geography, the term "spatial
imaginary" is used to focus attention on how shared understandings of
spaces and places are made and reproduced]{.underline} within societies.
This is the "why" of geopolitics.

[Practices]{.underline}. [Geopolitics is]{.underline} more than language
and spatial imaginaries. It is [a socio-material assemblage that uses
lived experiences and socio-material technologies]{.underline} and is
what might be described as the "how" of geopolitics.

Recently, a distinct body of critical geopolitical-inspired scholarship
on Arctic and even polar geopolitics has taken shape that incorporates
political geographers, political scientists, sociologists, international
lawyers, media scholars and anthropologists (for recent overviews, see
Lehtimäki et al., 2021; Wehrmann, 2019). While this literature is
methodologically diverse[, there is a shared passion for thinking about
the why, how, when and where of the Arctic being embroiled in
geopolitical circumstances]{.underline}. [Some of this work
has]{.underline} [centred around]{.underline} the relationship between
the geophysical and geopolitical, [exploring how sea ice melt,
permafrost thaw and environmental change provoke a resurgence of Arctic
interest as a space for geopolitical intrigue, resource extraction or a
place for indigenous renaissance. It might connect to theoretical
agendas linking the Arctic to debates over territorial
volumes]{.underline}, [materiality and climate change
geopolitics]{.underline}. Philip Steinberg, Berit Kristoffersen and
Kimberley Peters have worked with [the idea of "voluminous" to highlight
how water and ice as elements challenge the more static, two-dimensional
ways of thinking]{.underline} (see e.g. Steinberg & Kristoffersen, 2017;
Steinberg & Peters, 2015). They encourage us to think about the
contingency[, lived experiences and flows of Arctic geopolitics, which
includes indigenous communities of the northern region]{.underline}.
[Thinking volumetrically acts as a prompt to think about how we define
and refine our understanding of space without being "trapped" by a line
of latitude such as the Arctic Circle]{.underline} and the political
sovereignty of the eight Arctic states (Canada, Denmark/Greenland,
Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States).

What political geographers bring is a critical engagement with how the
"Arctic" gets assembled in discourse and practice (Bennett, 2014; Medby,
2018). In Norwegian geopolitical discourse, there is a "High North",
which is defined quite differently. It reflects the geo-strategic
preoccupations of a small Arctic state, and NATO member, that works
closely with others such as the UK, United States, Netherlands and
Denmark. [The High North is geographically flexible and generally gets
defined by function or object of concern]{.underline}, such as fisheries
management. In effect it draws attention to Norway's northern and Arctic
interests. [The history of the term "High North" is not
straightforward.]{.underline} It originates from the Norwegian term
nordområdene (i.e. the northern areas), which was used in the mid-1980s
and then adopted and translated into "High North" by successive
Norwegian governments in the early twenty-first century. This stands in
contrast to Canadian geopolitical discourse, which defines the "North"
as the three northernmost territories and provinces---Nunavut, the
Northwest Territories and the Yukon. More recently, terms such as
"global Arctic" have been used to draw attention to the growing
entanglement of Arctic economies, polities and societies with global
networks and processes (Dodds, 2018). As our next section illustrates,
relative geographical proximity to the Arctic has led China to declare
itself a "near-Arctic state", and this in turn has attracted criticism
from Arctic states, including the United States (see Woon & Dodds,
2020).

[Naturalisation is something that "can occur simply through statements
of 'fact'", as argued by Roxanne Doty when describing the naturalisation
of a 'North' versus a 'South':]{.underline} "[Naturalisation occurs
through presupposition, which creates background knowledge that is taken
to be true]{.underline}. [This background knowledge entails an
**implicit theorization** of how the world works and also an elaboration
of the nature of its inhabitants.]{.underline} (1996, p. 10, emphasis in
original)" Moreover, [**deciding what 'reality' is and who's
'reality**']{.underline} that [**ought to be included in a map
representation underpins the naturalising process inherent
in**]{.underline} most forms of **[map making]{.underline}**.
[Naturalising effects]{.underline}, according to Iver Neumann and Daniel
Nexon, [are conducted on the basis of selection and omission of certain
elements and symbols in a map that make "a particular way of looking at
the world appear to be part of the natural order, 'just the way thing
are', and hence difficult to argue against]{.underline}" (2006, p. 19).
Hence, [maps can keep alternative 'realities' from emerging through a
naturalisation of the dominant understanding of 'reality']{.underline}.
Furthermore[, the naturalising effects of a map are more explicit the
more similar the map is to other political representations **such as
internationally defined political entities or** **actors**.]{.underline}
For example, assu[ming that the most powerful states are located in the
'North' confirms and reinforces the natural and 'true' position of the
'North' and the 'South'. Moreover, this 'natural' fact becomes difficult
to challenge. Thus, a map can help naturalise and depoliticise the
political judgements inherent in a map's selected and coded
representation]{.underline} (Ferguson 1996), as I will later discuss in
my empirical Chapters 4, 5 and 6. Herein lies a map's constitutive
power: [a map attaches meaningful existence to assumed
'realities']{.underline}, such as a world divided into a North and a
South, by employing visual and textual language in particular ways.
[This is also part of legitimating existing political structures as
just, rational, and natural, rather than subject to contestation and
reinterpretation.]{.underline}

[To the extent that users of a map accept what the map shows and what it
fails to reflect in its dominant discourses, users engage
in]{.underline} what Shapiro calls ["implicit acts of recognition of the
existing power and authority configurations"]{.underline} (1988, p. 93).
[Since maps often are viewed and read as unproblematic descriptions,
dominant discourses within their representations are not always easy to
discern as map users tend to see and understand them
unproblematically]{.underline}. [For example]{.underline}, Shapiro
refers to [the use of maps as an example of unreflective reproduction
that shapes international, political speech:]{.underline} ["\[I\]t is a
matter of course that most books which claim to speak about a country
begin with a map in the opening pages. This representational practice is
so familiar it seems natural]{.underline} (i.e., not a practice),
[but]{.underline} [this representation of bounded areas partakes of a
venerable rhetorical gesture: **the map is a spatial trope which**, far
from simply reflecting (natural) boundaries, **is an aggressive
practice, delivering up the discursive territory within which legitimate
speech about bounded areas can occur**]{.underline}. (1988, p. 93)" [For
example]{.underline}, the beginning of [the book titled Negotiating the
Arctic]{.underline} -- The Construction of an International Region
(Keskitalo 2004) [includes a map that illustrates different ways of
defining where the Arctic is: by temperature, by]{.underline} its
[marine boundary, by treeline, and by sun height]{.underline} (the
Arctic Circle at 66 degrees North). [This map is followed by a
'political map' showing the different nation states and several place
names]{.underline} (Keskitalo 2004, p. ix-x). [Although the book
discusses different constructions of 'the Arctic', these maps are not
discussed further but taken as a natural basis for the study. **This
practice is common in other books about the Arctic and Arctic
issues**]{.underline} (see Steinberg et al., 2015). This illustrates
[why it is important to highlight what one understands as natural and
how naturalisation takes place]{.underline}. [Other
examples]{.underline} of places naturalised by the map
[are]{.underline}, for example, [the placement by early cartographers of
the prime meridian through Greenwich]{.underline} outside London, [a
geographical feature on maps that helped the British empire claim being
at the centre of the world and made places such as the 'Middle East'
possible]{.underline} (Dittmer 2010). [Without a meridian on a map there
would not be anywhere 'East' against which the 'Middle East' can be
measured]{.underline}. Moreover, Jason Dittmer argues the following:
"\[t\]his may seem innocent enough, but consider the Iraqi citizen who
self-identifies as a Middle Easterner -- they have accepted a term that
reinforces their own geographical marginality" (2010, p. 11). [In a
similar manner]{.underline}, Ingrid Medby (2014) has shown how [the
ideas of 'the North' and 'the Arctic' are becoming elements of
selfidentity among people living in Norway.]{.underline}

Furthermore, just as any disclosure of the inauthenticity of an image
does not necessarily undermine the ability of the image to be included
in a wider understanding of what it represents (Hansen 2011, p. 56), so
too can [a map have naturalising effects regardless of being 'proven'
wrong or misleading]{.underline}. [For example, even though the Mercator
projection is known to provide a false account of the actual size of
land masses, it does not stop it from being a widely used and circulated
projection]{.underline} (Kaiser and Wood 2001). [That is, the Mercator
projection continues to constitute the conditions for how 'The' world
map should look like and how people are to think about 'the
world',]{.underline} which I will discuss further when I analyse Google
Maps in Chapter 4. [This is a good example of how naturalisation works
to reinforce and legitimate dominant understandings.]{.underline}
Moreover, [this process directly involves ignoring and/or undermining
alternative understandings by not including them. Hence, **whenever
something is naturalised, something else that is silenced**]{.underline}
-- i[.e., one 'reality' is privileged over another]{.underline} (Harley
1988a). [Silences can be intentional (]{.underline}e.g., secrecy and
censorship[) and unintentional (]{.underline}e.g., discursive rules and
codes that structure how maps are made[)]{.underline} (Harley 1998a, p.
58). [An example of the latter, is standardisation in maps which
generates "the silences of uniformity" in which much of the character
and individuality of local places are absent in the map]{.underline}
(Harley 1988a, p. 65). [This makes it possible for places that look
alike to be treated alike. Another example is how cultures are erased by
not mentioning them on maps]{.underline} (which can be highly
intentional), [thus rejecting 'other' people and ways of life not
corresponding to the politically more powerful groups]{.underline}
(Harley 1988a, p. 66). In this way, **[silences help reinforce the
dominant discourse in politics and support the political
s]{.underline}**tatus **[quo]{.underline}** (Harley 1988a; 1989). While
Harley (1988a) focussed on revealing hidden agendas in historical maps,
I emphasise the impact of silences in contemporary maps. Moreover, as
explained by Elspeth Van Veeren about visual representations,
invisibility is "not only disempowerment of certain identities but also
to the cultural forces that reproduce these identities and associated
inequalities and insecurities, rendering them 'common sensical' and
therefore harder to overcome. (2018, p. 199)" Hence, [**silences are
central in** the **naturalisation** and making of the 'common sensical'
and cultures of 'how things are done' that often pass
unquestioned]{.underline}. [Maps can reinforce and legitimate the status
quo without people being aware of it]{.underline} (Harley 1989, p. 14).
[Instead of calling for complete visibility, which would subvert the
whole purpose of maps, I call for attention to silences as an important
naturalisation effect of constitutive power]{.underline}. To sum-up,
[the implication for my theorisation about **the constitutive power of
maps is that the cartographic naturalisation of particular issues
becomes the background knowledge that limits and controls who speaks as
well as how one speaks, thinks, imagines, and forms expectations about
the future.**]{.underline} As pointed out by Wood and Fels (2008), the
map itself can stay 'natural' and 'neutral', untainted by politics, as
it is only the issues represented in the map, such as property rights or
voting behaviour, that are considered to be social constructs. In this
way, the map itself is not questioned. Thus, the naturalisation of
issues in maps are powerful aspects of ontology because they stabilise
the established power-knowledge structures (Crampton 2002). In my
empirical analysis, focussing on cartographic naturalisation helps me
study what and who are silenced and to consider the underlying
assumptions in a map's representation of 'the Arctic'. These silences
and assumptions, when taken as 'truths' and naturalised can have
material 'effects', which I will address next.

#### Their fiat is a form of biopolitical futurity which continues the power of governmentally, only through new futures may we rupture theirs.

We have argued here, along with the contributors, [that futurity is
dangerous. How then, do we proceed]{.underline}? Though these articles
do not answer the durable question of racial injustice, they caution us
to take care to understand what political work the future does.
Modernity denies futurity to racialized others by depending upon a
hierarchy of human-ness. [These papers remind us that, ironically,
efforts to include the marginalized within the biopolitics of the human
serve to naturalize and reinscribe the functioning of race rather than
attacking the hierarchy of humanity that produces the uneven
distribution of life and death]{.underline}. Our readings of
race-[biopolitics indicate that white non-futurity has been greatly
exaggerated]{.underline}. White supremacists refer to a ''white
genocide,'' [revealing a racial fantasy rooted in white fragility
(DiAngelo, 2011)]{.underline}, while some on the left place hope in
demographic changes to shift party politics. The articles here make
clear that whiteness is about more than demographic trends, and recent
events reaffirm that a lax teleological [hopefulness equating futurity
with progress will lead to **repetition rather than
rupture**]{.underline}. [We must work toward a future that comprises a
break with a past that cannot be reconciled or forgiven]{.underline}
(Eaves, 2016; Inwood, 2012).

Da Silva (2011) asks us to take on racism as ''biopolitical arsenal'' by
understanding how race emerged in modernity, infused into the apparatus
of the ''bios'' and the ''political,'' and sustained through the
production of new efficient tools for sorting humanity. [Here, we
suggest it is incumbent on us to pay attention to both specificities and
continuities in context-based, future-oriented biopolitical
practice]{.underline}. That is, as Olund observes, [there are multiple
and complex racializing spatio-temporalities beyond what is implied by
the white/non-white binary]{.underline}. Here, we identify two competing
temporalities. On the one hand, a [hopeful imagining of the future (as a
''long arc toward justice'') sees biopolitical violence as exceptional
or as falling away over time]{.underline}. On the other, in the
vocalization that Black Lives Matter, and in the indigenous
re-occupation of Standing Rock, [alternate futurities momentarily
**rupture the present tense, revealing the untenability of the
biopolitical violence that undergirds this world**]{.underline}. In
Olund's words, under present biopolitical regimes, ''[white spaces and
futures are necessarily heteronormative, while racialized spaces and
temporalities are queered'' (285). The disruption of race-biopolitics
requires a seizure of the biopolitical arsenal, and a queering of the
future through 216 Environment and Planning D: Society and Space 35(2)
decolonial, abolitionist, and fugitive practices (Best and Hartman,
2005; Bliss, 2015; Collard et al., 2015; Dillon, 2013; Gumbs, 2016;

grammar that binds us to a narrowly defined human future.]{.underline}

Relations at the University of Lapland, Finland. *Critical Studies of
the Arctic: Unravelling the North*. 1st ed., Cham: Springer

The [study of biopolitics in the Arctic]{.underline} is relatively
under-developed when we compare it with the study of geopolitics. We
know much by now about the Arctic as a space of geopolitical
contestation between powerful territorially aggrandizing states (Tamnes
& Offerdal, 2014). We [know much less about the Arctic as a space of
specifically biopolitical governance, a space, that is, in which power
is exercised over human populations through strategies of care for
life]{.underline}. The need for such understanding and analysis is all
the greater in this present era of pandemics and the threat of disease,
which is to say, of biological death, of suffering and of loss and
illness, in the Arctic as much as elsewhere. However, there are examples
of research in which the concept of [**biopolitics has been deployed**
to make sense of how power is organized and exercised in the
Arctic.]{.underline} The anthropologist Lisa Stevenson has written
especially important works in which she has developed the concept as a
framework for understanding power relations between the Canadian state
and the Inuit who live in Arctic Canada (Stevenson, 2012). Rather than
try to provide a broad survey of different texts in which the [concept
of biopolitics has been deployed to approach power in the
Arctic]{.underline}, this chapter will focus specifically on Stevenson's
work, as an important and thorough example of scholarship on Arctic
biopolitics. It is a text which does not simply add or transfer
biopolitics to Arctic Studies from other areas of research, but which,
in examining the Arctic, contributes significantly to the fundamental
theory and understanding of the importance of biopolitics for knowledge.
Yet it also has limits, owing to its relative age and to its
disciplinary origins in anthropology; these require us to think beyond
it, [using recent insights into the changing nature of biopolitics,
drawn from International Relations and elsewhere]{.underline}. As
Stevenson argues, one of the major utilities of the concept of
biopolitics for the study of power in the Arctic is the way in which it
enables us to reveal and see the violence of discourses and practices of
care in the Arctic. [The biopolitics of care is by now a very wide
subject area transcending disciplines and geographic areas of
study]{.underline} (De Boever, 2013). It is for obvious reasons a major
feature of [critical humanitarian studies]{.underline}, as theorists and
practitioners have learnt to be more circumspect about the relations
between humanitarian care and power (Mavelli, 2017). We know well by now
that the concept and practice of care is deeply loaded, politically.
Stevenson's study of the Inuit experience of care in the Canadian Arctic
is yet another [contribution to the wider understanding of how care
functions,]{.underline} in the Arctic, as well as many other spaces of
liberal intervention, [to legitimate intervention itself]{.underline}
(Reid, 2005). One of the main ways in which Inuit have suffered from the
care of the Canadian state has been through the [intervention in the
suicide crisis said to exist in Inuit communities]{.underline}. The
[suicide crisis]{.underline} among the Inuit, as well as the wider
health problems identified with Inuit communities, has been [useful to
the Canadian state]{.underline} when it comes to [legitimating
interventions]{.underline} in Inuit communities. [It is not that the
biopolitical state does not care; it does]{.underline}. The point is, as
Stevenson well argues, that it is [useful for the state to care where
care **legitimates its capacities to intervene** and **ensure its own
colonial control** of spaces and peoples, including the
Inuit]{.underline}. S[uicide crises in the Arctic are not limited to
Inuit communities]{.underline}, and the analysis of the [biopolitical
functions of these crises in legitimating colonial interventions in
populations and territories could easily]{.underline}. be extended to
encompass other peoples and places. The 'i[ncreased risk' of
suicide]{.underline} among Saami populations has, for example, been
extensively researched, with particular attention drawn to the high
rates of suicide among young Saami men (Silviken et al., 2006). These
elevated rates are reported as being especially high among
reindeer-herding men, and higher still among young men (Sjolander,
2011). Attempts are ongoing to increase awareness and refine the means
by which the suicide crisis in Saami communities is addressed. A [recent
study identified 17 different suicide prevention]{.underline}
initiatives targeting Saami in Norway, Sweden and Finland, as well as 40
different problematizations regarding the question of how to prevent
suicide among Saami (Stoor et al., 2021). Typically, [such studies are
statistical and make their own biopolitical assumption that suicide is a
'problem' and an expression of 'unfavorable psychosocial outcomes' which
require preventing (Kiaerbech et al., 2021)]{.underline}. In other areas
of the Arctic, as diverse as Alaska and the northern regions of Russia,
and in the analysis of other indigenous groups, [the same positivist
approaches prevail, under the guise of 'prevention science' (Allen et
al., 2022) and 'targeted prevention']{.underline} (Sumarokov et al.,
2014). [Increasing the efficacy of interventions]{.underline} is seen to
go hand in hand with the [need for increasingly refined quantitative
studies]{.underline} of the whys and wherefores of indigenous 'mental
health' (Middleton et al., 2021). Of all the different suicide crises
researched in the Arctic it is that of [the Inuit that has drawn most
attention for the high rates of suicide,]{.underline} ones regularly
detailed as being among the highest in the world (Kral, 2016). Mean age-
standardized analyses of different suicide rates in the eight different
Arctic states indicate that the three Arctic regions with the very
highest rates are Chukotka, Nunavut and Greenland, all of which contain
large indigenous populations (Kue-Young et al., 2015). Statistical
analyses, however, remain limited in their different conclusions, partly
because not all Arctic states record ethnic identity in their health
databases (Kue-Young et al., 2015). Nevertheless, the rising interest in
documenting and [detailing the rates and risks of suicide in Arctic
regions can be seen to have developed in parallel with the scaling up of
mental health]{.underline} care as a '[core service']{.underline} of
state health agencies as well as non-governmental agencies governing
indigeneity in the Arctic as a whole (Trout & Wexler, 2020). Thinking
about the [**biopolitics of care** is also fundamental to the work of
two other scholars of the Arctic]{.underline}---Marjo Lindroth and Heidi
Sinevaara- Niskanen---whose work addresses it as a central theme
(Lindroth & Sinevaara-Niskanen, 2018, 2022). The focus of their research
has been on the [**continuities of colonialism** at work in the policies
of Arctic states such as Canada, as well as the Arctic
Council.]{.underline} This is important because [the Arctic Council is
often identified as a more progressive]{.underline} and postcolonial
regime of governance when compared with the Arctic states. As Lindroth
and Sinevaara-Niskanen describe, the significance of the Arctic Council
is that it [functions to represent a structural transformation in the
relations of states to indigenous peoples]{.underline}, on account of
its being more inclusive and consultative of indigenous peoples than the
states of the Arctic region (Lindroth & Sinevaara-Niskanen, 2022: 16).
Whether we are considering the care of the Arctic Council or of Arctic
states for indigenous peoples, it is essential, they argue, that we see
how such [care functions strategically, as a way of signaling to
indigenous peoples and the wider world that things are getting
better]{.underline}. **[Care]{.underline}**, they suggest, ['signals
hope for the better' yet, on closer inspection, is revealed to be
'**dangerous'** and indeed '**colonial'**]{.underline} (Lindroth &
Sinevaara-Niskanen, 2022: 101). [Hope]{.underline} itself has to be
understood as [another element of such colonialism,]{.underline} they
argue, for [acts of care are designed to 'reproduce hope'
(]{.underline}Lindroth & Sinevaara- Niskanen, 2022: 101). Expressions of
a [will to care enable Arctic regimes to implement a 'politics of
hope']{.underline} which, in turn, [extends their colonial rule over
indigenous peoples]{.underline} (Lindroth & Sinevaara-Niskanen, 2022:
101). As Claes Tängh Wrangel has well argued, [hope]{.underline}, like
care, is a [biopolitical technology]{.underline} (Tängh Wrangel, 2019:
669); its [function]{.underline} is to [enable regimes of
power]{.underline} to [govern the life of the populations which they
target, and produce 'hopeful subjects' whose orientation to the future
is secure and not dangerous to political power. Subjects without hope,
it is feared in the United States,]{.underline} for example, are more
likely to turn into suicide bombers (Tängh Wrangel, 2019: 672). In the
Arctic, there is a comparable set of [linkages between care, hope and
suicide that are equally biopolitical.]{.underline} The [Arctic Council
has been particularly proactive in tackling the suicide crisis in the
Arctic]{.underline}, not just among the Inuit but among wider indigenous
communities as well. It is essential therefore that the [Council's
policies towards suicide be subjected]{.underline} to the [same kind of
biopolitical scrutiny that Stevenson has given to those of the Canadian
state.]{.underline}

#### The alternative is a rejection of the 1AC's engagement in this biopolitical structure. It is time to reject the "care" and the logic of help because under the allegedly humanitarian surface, this form of politics results in net harm for indigenous populations

\*\*\*TW: mentions of suicide

**Reid 22**, Julian Reid is a professor and chair of International
Relations at the University of Lapland, Finland. *Critical Studies of
the Arctic: Unravelling the North*. 1st ed., Cham: Springer

Understanding the [biopolitical rationalities]{.underline} which [shape
the **discourses and practices of care**]{.underline} in the Arctic also
[enables us]{.underline} to better [understand the rationalities of
those who resist that care in the Arctic.]{.underline} It is a fact that
while [care continues to be exercised towards indigenous
peoples]{.underline} of the Arctic, by Arctic states as much as by the
Arctic Council, and while some [representatives of those peoples
cooperate with these colonial bodies]{.underline}, others among these
[peoples]{.underline} resist and refuse that care. The [reason for that
resistance and refusal]{.underline} owes to the [ways in which care is
sometimes experienced as murderous]{.underline} (Stevenson, 2014: 4).
Stevenson's focus on the disjuncture between the [intention of the
care]{.underline} of Canada and the Inuit [experience of that care as
murderous]{.underline} leads her to ask what it is that goes on in this
[disjuncture between the **intention to care for life**]{.underline} and
**the [experience of that care]{.underline}** [as
murderous]{.underline}. Is there something in Inuit subjectivity that
produces the [anger of the rejection of that care, a rejection which
has, as she also well details, produced a suicide epidemic]{.underline}
in Nunavut in which the suicide rate for the region is more than five
times the Canadian national average (Stevenson, 2014: 7). What is it in
the Inuit, as a subject- formation, as well as a culture and people, and
as a political subject, that produces this apparent desire for death?
[Is there something in biopolitics and the experience of the **caring
embrace of biopower** that leads the Inuit to reject it and choose
death?]{.underline} These are questions which are not specific to the
study of the Arctic, or of indigenous peoples elsewhere. However, they
are key to the ways in which the [concept of biopolitics has been
mobilized within Arctic research to date.]{.underline} Answering these
questions requires us to [navigate the colonial origins and development
of biopower.]{.underline} Among the Inuit, the [experience of
biopolitics has been translated through the practices by which Canada
responded to the tuberculosis crisis of the 1950s and
1960s:]{.underline} many Inuit were forcibly removed from their homes
and communities in the Arctic and shipped to sanitoria in the south of
the country, where they [were treated, often only to die without ever
seeing their homes and families again. The inhumanity of those
biopolitical practices, not just the force with which Inuit were
removed, but the ways in which their lives were reduced to statistical
series---numbers and not names---and to diseased bodies to be treated
and not psyches with dreams and desires of their own, may help us to
understand **their resistance and refusal**]{.underline}. These
[biopolitical techniques were effectively drawn]{.underline}, as
Stevenson argues, from the realms of animal husbandry (Stevenson 2014:
29). The death of a tubercular Inuit was often anonymous, leaving no
trace in Canadian state records other than a simple index card, marked
with the statement 'dead' and with the year of death enumerated---'1956'
in the case of one Inuit, Kaujak, whose journey to death Stevenson's
research attempts to unearth more details about (Stevenson, 2014:
21--46). Superficial [critics of Foucault's theory of biopolitics have
often pointed out that it is marked by an absence]{.underline} of an
[analysis of **colonialism**.]{.underline} The argument goes that
Foucault was a Eurocentric thinker with little regard for the
non-European world, and that his theory is, in fact, as Howell and
Richter-Montpetit argue, racist (Howell & Richter-Montpetit, 2019: 2).
Research on biopolitics, which uses the concept to help us under- stand
[how care functions in the strategies of colonial powers]{.underline},
is, therefore, truly important in overcoming this analytical deficit of
Foucault's. In the Arctic, at least, the [biopolitical emphasis of state
power on caring for and preserving life]{.underline} can be seen to be a
fundamentally '[colonial norm']{.underline} (Stevenson, 2014: 96).
Looking at practices of [care through a biopolitical lens]{.underline}
in these ways is really to pose a challenge to the ever-larger
literatures in the health sciences that continue to treat care as if it
were sheer benevolence. [Identifying suicide simply as a problem to be
solved and enacting 'suicide prevention interventions' as the solution,
as has been done by the Arctic Council]{.underline} through its Rising
Sun initiative since 2015 (Collins et al., 2019: 152), may [only
reproduce the kinds of problems which earlier interventions in
indigenous communities are known]{.underline} for, namely the experience
of **[colonialism]{.underline}**. Scientific [studies]{.underline} which
[argue]{.underline} for [state-led interventions into communities where
the act of suicide is itself an indigenous solution]{.underline} to the
[problem of colonial intervention]{.underline} do not seem to see the
irony and paradoxicality of their reasoning (Pollock et al., 2020). A
biopolitical analytic can help in at least making such paradoxes and
ironies more apparent.

suffer from a [life-threatening condition that would not be properly
treated in their home country,]{.underline} she emphasises how
humanitarian government politicises [migration by establishing what
constitutes legitimate suffering, and thus by turning the 'suffering
body' into a 'means to papers']{.underline}. 32 At the same time,
humanitarian government also depoliticises migration by [constructing
**suffering bodies** as 'victim\[s\] without a perpetrator', and
individuals as objects of care]{.underline} and compassion rather than
equal citizens.33 This makes their condition all the more precarious, as
the [humanitarian exception that gave them protection]{.underline} may
[quickly **revert** to practices of security]{.underline} (should the
'sick body' no longer meet the criteria of what counts as legitimate
suffering) turning the 'endangered' into the 'dangerous' and the
'innocent' into the 'delinquent'. 34 This argument brings to [the fore
the centrality of the politics of life and the body to humanitarian
government,]{.underline} thus suggesting an important [conceptual
affinity with the phenomenon famously described by **Foucault** as
**biopolitics**.]{.underline} According to Foucault,
[biopolitics]{.underline} denotes a modern condition in which the [life
of individuals]{.underline} (their bodies) and the life of the
population as a whole become the [object of political strategies and
interventions.]{.underline} At the heart of this condition is a
transformation in the technology of power: from the [sovereign power to
take life to the biopolitical power to make live.]{.underline}35 Unlike
traditional forms of sovereign power which manifest themselves through
mechanisms of deduction of wealth, labour, services, and 'ultimately
life itself', [**biopower** -- which encompasses the discipline of the
body ('anatomo-politics') and the **regulation** of the **population**
('bio-politics') -- is primarily **a power of care** aimed at
strengthening and enhancing life.]{.underline}

The role of surveillance in society: social sorting

Whilst some literature suggests that surveillance is simply the capture
of personal information, [Lyon contends that surveillance is a strategy
of social control, and that its purpose is to "influence or manage those
whose data have been garnered"]{.underline} (Lyon, 2001). [In this way,
surveillance functions as a process of "social sorting"]{.underline}
(Lyon, 2003), where surveillance capacities are used to collect data,
categorise, classify, evaluate and ultimately assign individuals and
groups an identity in relation to the normative white (or other dominant
race or ethnicity), middle-aged, middle-class, able-bodied,
cis-gendered, heterosexual male (Lyon, 2005; Marx, 2005).

[Historical accounts of colonisation reveal that surveillance was
essential for the classification of people and the control of newly
acquired territories]{.underline} (Zuriek, 2013). From the 14th to the
19th century, European colonists amassed vast quantities of data on the
populations they colonised. [The foundations of modern-day biometrics,
such as fingerprinting, census taking, map-making and profiling, were
refined and implemented in colonial setting]{.underline}s (Zureik,
2013). I[nformation gathered via surveillance was used by European
governments to classify populations according to innate biological
traits, and construct racial hierarchies based on flawed notions of
"scientific racism", both in the colonies and at home]{.underline}
(Brown & Barganier, 2018). In Australia, white colonisers used these
theories of white supremacy to justify violence such as massacres of
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, land theft, removal of
children from families, and erasure of language and culture (Anderson &
Perrin, 2008).

[Systems of surveillance have been instrumental in creating and
reinforcing the social identities, divisions, and hierarchies that shape
contemporary society]{.underline} (Gandy 1993; Lyon 2003). This is most
apparent in the logics that construct the 'criminal'. Colonial racial
taxonomies formed the basis for the modern study of 'deviance', a core
concept of the scholarly field of Criminology (Brown & Barganier, 2018).
[Deviance is based on a "constant division between the normal and the
abnormal"]{.underline} (Foucault, 1977) [so that groups can be "sorted
by levels of dangerousness"]{.underline} (Feely and Simon 1994). Harsha
Walia, in her book Undoing Border Imperialism observes that "criminals
are never imagined as

politicians, bankers, corporate criminals, or war criminals, but as a
racialised class of people living in poverty. The word criminal becomes
synonymous with dehumanising stereotypes of ghettos, welfare recipients,
drug users, sex workers, and young gang members" (2013). The
criminalisation of migration intensified in the aftermath of the attacks
of 9/11 in New York and Washington DC (Akkerman, 2016; Lyon, 2003). The
construction and reinforcement of race-based categories (Finn, 2005) as
a potential threat (for example, Arab and Muslim men) justified a suite
of new global counter-terrorism policies, legislation and the
strengthened power of police and intelligence forces (Pellerin, 2005).
[Surveillance serves as a technique to create and sustain borders
through defining the grounds for exclusion and inclusion]{.underline}
(Marx, 2005), such as citizenship criteria that determines who does or
does not belong as a full member of a nation-state (Lyon, 2005). [In
addition to the ability to admit or exclude, today surveillants --
whether at an airport, a welfare office, or a credit card company --
have the responsibility of defining people as normal or deviant,
desirable or undesirable, safe or risky, citizen or threat, healthy or
diseased]{.underline}. These definitions have profound effects on the
freedom of those individuals (Finn, 2005; Lyon, 2005; Marx, 2005). In
this way, surveillance plays a central role in reproducing inequality,
creating a hierarchy of access to various social, political, or economic
benefits (Lyon, 2005).

[Achille Mbembe describes the brutality of borders as an embodiment of
"necropolitics", which he defines as the "ultimate expression of
sovereignty... the power and capacity to dictate who is able to live and
who must die]{.underline}" (2019). Social sorting, and its power to
"kill, to let live, or to expose to death" will remain a central feature
of contemporary society and only be strengthened through the development
of surveillance technologies (Mbembe, 2019; Lyon, 2005).

Neoliberalisation, growing corporate power and border security

[Colonial racial hierarchies were the primary structuring principle of
the capitalist world economy]{.underline} which laid the foundation for
the lasting rift between parts of the world categorised broadly as
Global North and Global South1 (Hoogvelt, 1997).

### 2NC !\-\--Genocide 

**Allowing the sovereign to control populations allows for the worst
kinds of violence. The atrocities of everyday biopower are normalized,
and then manifest themselves in genocide.**

Agamben argued that in fact the [modern political "**power over
life**"]{.underline} (as in Foucault's theorization of
biopower) [is]{.underline} [predicated on]{.underline} [a more
fundamental "**power over death**" belonging
to]{.underline} **[sovereignty]{.underline}** (1998: 83). [Since
sovereign power encapsulates the power to]{.underline} ...**[suspend
law]{.underline}** [and the]{.underline} **[protections it
confers]{.underline}** [on subjects]{.underline} (Hannah, 2006: 633),
Agamben urges that [individuals are]{.underline} ["biological
beings]{.underline} **[ultimately vulnerable to death]{.underline}** [at
the hands of the sovereign]{.underline}, that is, [as]{.underline} homo
sacer or "**[bare life]{.underline}**." (Tyner, 2013: 706) [This
is]{.underline} **[tragically]{.underline}** **[apparent]{.underline}** [in]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[hundreds
of thousands of enforced citizen
disappearances]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[other]{.underline}** **[human

Similarly, under]{.underline} Sudanese President
Omar [al-Bashir]{.underline}'s policy of Arabization and
Islamization, [a]{.underline} **[vicious scorched earth ethnocidal
policy]{.underline}** [designed to subjugate]{.underline} the southern
racial and religious [opposition]{.underline} [led to
a]{.underline} [cumulative]{.underline} [death toll
of]{.underline} **[well]{.underline}** **[over 2
million]{.underline}** [pointing to a reality in which citizens are
"**bare life**"]{.underline}. Unfortunately, as in the case of
China, [we tend to]{.underline} **[initially
negate]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[normalize]{.underline}** [the
tragedies of everyday biopower,]{.underline} **[absorbing everyday
violence]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[violations]{.underline}** [without
reflecting on their corrosive impact on our
communities,]{.underline} **[trusting in
elections]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} [move us from
the]{.underline} **[jungle of death]{.underline}** [to
the]{.underline} **[administration of life]{.underline}**. But has the
old form of sovereign power, embodied in \"the right of seizure of
things, time, bodies, and ultimately life itself,\" truly gradually
yielded to the biopolitical \"administration of bodies and the
calculated management of life?\"(Kordela, 2015:1). Agamben insists that
Foucault's construct of biopower as
those [everyday]{.underline} ["**normalized**"]{.underline} [forms of
biopolitical
control]{.underline} actually **[share]{.underline}** **[common]{.underline}** **[roots]{.underline}** [with]{.underline} [the]{.underline} **[extreme
programs of violence]{.underline}** [we associate
with]{.underline} **[totalitarianism]{.underline}** (Agamben, 1998:
5--6; Hannah, 2006: 633). [One of the]{.underline} **[most brutal
applications]{.underline}** [can be found in
the]{.underline} **[atrocities of the]{.underline}** [**Nazi
concentration camps**, in which Jews and others \"were
exterminated]{.underline} **[not in a]{.underline}** mad and
giant **[\[sacrificial\]
holocaust]{.underline}** [but,]{.underline} [**exactly as Hitler had
announced**, \'**as lice**,\' which is to say, as]{.underline} [**bare
life**\"]{.underline} (Agamben, 1998:127-29, 114 cited in Kordela, 2015:
1-2). Of course, we do not have to go far back into history for proof.
We live in a world currently dominated by news
of **[ISIS]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[Boko
Haram]{.underline}** who **[regularly upload gleeful
videos]{.underline}** [of their extermination of human beings
as]{.underline} **[reminders of the capacity]{.underline}** [of the
'sovereign
to]{.underline} **[imagine]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[eradicate
humans]{.underline}** [as '**bare life**.']{.underline} However,
Foucault did not suggest that a "biopolitical regime effectively
protects all life." On the contrary, he admitted that [the "destruction
of life remains an]{.underline} [**integral part of biopolitics**"
in]{.underline} **[all modern states]{.underline}**, but also submitted
that quite unlike life under the reign of the sovereign, biopolitical
management of life in liberal states "now requires a recodification of
any assault on life in terms that justify it from a biopolitical point
of view" (Kordela, 2006:7, 8). Perhaps the difference between exercising
"power over death" and the "power over life" is negligible. Tyner puts
it succinctly, "[Whether characterized as '**bare
life**']{.underline} (Agamben, 1998), 'wasted lives' (Bauman, 2004;
Neocleous, 2011), 'humans-as-waste' (Yates, 2011), 'abandoned lives'
(Pratt, 2005), '**[disposable]{.underline}** lives' (Chang, 2000;
Wright, 1999, 2004, 2006), 'precarious lives' (Butler,
2004), [or]{.underline} **[any of the other myriad
terms]{.underline}** currently being introduced, the commonality is
that [some populations
are]{.underline} **[legally]{.underline}** **[relegated to the realm of
surplus]{.underline}** [and thus]{.underline} **[rendered
expendable]{.underline}**" (Tyner, 2013: 708).

### 2NC !\-\--Necropolitics

#### Biopolitical management culminates in [neoimperialism]{.underline} and state-sanctioned [targeting]{.underline} -- the demarcation of the "other" undergirds [necropolitical violence.]{.underline}

**Quinan & Thiele 19** Quinan, C., & Thiele, K. (2019). Biopolitics,
necropolitics, cosmopolitics -- feminist and queer interventions: an
introduction. *Journal of Gender Studies*, *29*(1), 1--8.
https://doi-org.proxy.lib.umich.edu/10.1080/09589236.2020.1693173

While [biopolitics and necropolitics have gained more and more scholarly
attention]{.underline}, we aim in this Special Issue to nuance this
conversation by [emphasizing feminist and queer investments and by
adding the analytical lens of cosmopolitics to the ongoing debates
around life/living and death/ dying in the current political climate.
The migration crisis, the rise of populism on a global scale,
neoimperial practices and homonationalist strategies, and
state-sanctioned targeting of gender, sexual, racial and ethnic 'others'
are only a few of the crises that we face today and that mark some lives
as more -- or less -- worthy than others.]{.underline} As Foucault
(2003, 2008) outlined in his groundbreaking analysis,
[biopower]{.underline}, a new governing strategy focused on the
regulation of populations and the management of life, arose in the late
eighteenth century. This notion of 'making live and letting die' marked
a significant shift from a medieval system wherein a singular sovereign
[could exercise the power to 'let live and make die' over a
hierarchically organized people.]{.underline} The new governmentality
also instigated a modernized notion of the social body and the subjects
that embodied it. As Foucault describes, this technology exerted social
and political power over a new type of social structure: 'not exactly
society . . . nor is it the individual-as-body. It is a new body, a
multiple body, a body with so many heads that, while they might not be
infinite in number, cannot necessarily be counted' (Foucault, 2003, p.
245). As the target of biopolitical management, this 'multiple body'
requires forms of governance under which new and updated modes of
control of both human and non-human agents are created and implemented.
In this system, discourse and/as power produces a social subject who
willingly selfimplements the basic rules of Law Now, several decades
after Foucault's intervention and the emergence of biopower and a [mode
of governance known as biopolitics]{.underline}, [we are forced to
account for death and dying in a neo-imperial and neoliberal era in
which a majority of people around the globe are pushed into precarious
living situations, where millions of refugees are attempting to cross
borders]{.underline}, specifically those of Europe and the United
States, [and in which technologies of destruction are not only more
pervasive but have also become more sensorial]{.underline} (Mbembe,
2003, p. 34). In his supplement to Foucauldian biopolitics, Achille
Mbembe, therefore, interrogates if the notion of biopower is still
adequate in accounting for the contemporary political economy. 'What
place', he asks, 'is given to life, death, and the human body (in
particular the wounded or slain body)? How are they inscribed in the
order of power?' (Mbembe, 2003, p. 12). As his theoretical paradigm of
analysis, Mbembe coins the terms [necropower and necropolitics to
explain how life in a biopolitical frame is always already subjugated to
and determined by the power of death]{.underline} (Mbembe, 2003, 2019).
In this sense, [necropolitics questions in today's political climate who
gets to live and who must die -- or who must live and who is let
die]{.underline} -- thereby putting forth a different hypothesis than
had Foucault's conceptualization of biopower. While thinking with the
Foucauldian theoretical paradigms of analysis, necropolitics is much
more concerned with how life is subjugated to the power of death. [Thus,
rather than showing how life and death are both structuring instruments
of power]{.underline} (as if in a relation of equivalence),
[necropolitics asks about the asymmetrical conditioning of who gets to
live and who must die.]{.underline} While Foucault keeps a certain
conceptual distance, Mbembe emphasizes that they are no longer an even
pair. Death, making die, is what structures living. [Necropolitics
thereby uncovers how certain bodies are cultivated for life and
(re)production while others are systemically marked for death,
constructing a constantly shifting borderline between subjects deemed
'productive' and 'lawful' and non-subjects branded as 'illegitimate' or
'illegal'.]{.underline} [The concept of necropolitics also accounts for
contemporary warfare and the various ways in which]{.underline}, as
Mbembe explains, '[weapons are deployed in the interest of maximum
destruction of persons and the creating of death-worlds, new and unique
forms of social existence in which vast populations are subjected to
conditions of life']{.underline} (2003, p. 40). [Referencing not only
physical death but also social death]{.underline}, these death-worlds
severely impact entire populations, ['conferring upon them the status of
living dead']{.underline} (Mbembe, 2003, p. 40). In the same vein,
concepts like Lauren Berlant's slow death (2007) and Rob Nixon's slow
violence (2011) underscore how the deterioration, devastation and
destruction of certain human and non-human populations are a hallmark of
necropolitical modes of governance and engagement. [The way in which the
conditions of possibility for life and death also come to be linked with
the distribution of resources represents a fundamental bio- and
necropolitical negotiation]{.underline} (Agamben, 1998; Butler, 2004;
Mbembe, 2003, 2019; Weheliye, 2014). [Nonetheless, life and death cannot
be separated: biopolitics and necropolitics are not
opposites.]{.underline} Rather, they are 'two sides of the same coin',
as Rosi Braidotti explains (2013, p. 122). [They are lenses that come
together to allow us to analyse contemporary power relations and examine
the inextricable politics of life and death at work on a planetary scale
today.]{.underline} This focus of critical research has been
supplemented by a [growing body of innovative scholarship in feminist
and queer studies on biopower and necropower]{.underline}. Kyla Schuller
(2018), for instance, documents in The Biopolitics of Feeling how race
and sex became entangled in the nineteenthcentury US context, [with
biopower serving to consolidate]{.underline} 'in a sentimental mode that
regulated [the circulation of feeling throughout the population and
delineated differential relational capacities of matter, and therefore
the potential for evolutionary progress, as the modern concepts of race,
sex, and species]{.underline}' (2018, p. 5). Meanwhile, in the
contemporary context, Alexander Weheliye (2014) closely analyses the
racial dimensions of biopolitics and necropolitics in Habeas Viscus:
Racializing Assemblages, Biopolitics, and Black Feminist Theories of the
Human. Drawing inspiration from the seminal works of Hortense Spillers
and Sylvia Wynter, Weheliye interrogates the role of race in
foundationally shaping modern notions of the human itself. His theory of
['racializing assemblages' understands race as a set of sociopolitical
processes that discipline humanity into full humans, notquite-humans and
nonhumans.]{.underline} Further, Mel Y. Chen's Animacies: Biopolitics,
Racial Mattering, and Queer Affect (2014) has been foundational in its
application of the concept of the 'animacy hierarchy' to interrogate the
questionable yet materializing distinctions made between the living and
the dead. This thinking through [animacy as the hierarchically
structured condition of what is considered life and liveability, or
toxicity and disposability, makes a great contribution to
disability]{.underline} studies [and queer of colour
critique.]{.underline} Theoretical explorations of biopolitics and
necropolitics have also been taken up within the field of queer studies.
Jasbir K. Puar (2007, 2017) has been particularly instrumental in
provoking an expanding body of work on queer necropolitics. Puar's
persuasive analysis has, for example, been furthered by the collection
Queer Necropolitics, where Jin Haritaworn, Adi Kuntsman and Silvia
Posocco use [queer necropolitics as 'a tool to make sense of the
symbiotic co-presence of life and death' in order to analyse the
distinction of 'queer subjects invited into life and queerly abjected
populations marked for death']{.underline} (Haritaworn, Kuntsman, &
Posocco, 2014, p. 2). In trans studies as well, [bio- and necropolitics
have been useful in helping articulate how increased visibility and
representation of trans and non-binary individuals happen alongside
increasing and intensifying violence towards trans communities,
particularly those of colour]{.underline} (cárdenas, 2017; Gossett,
Stanley, & Burton, 2017; Snorton, 2017). But while it may be that
biopolitics and necropolitics could be the quickest to turn to in
working through the contemporary sociopolitical climate, [in our project
of presenting queer and feminist interventions, we want to supplement
this discussion by engaging with the concept of
cosmopolitics]{.underline}. We take this concept from Isabelle Stengers
who understands the cosmos as an operator of 'putting into equality'
(Stengers, 2005, p. 995). She proposes a cosmopolitics, which while
modelled on the ideal scientific method, considers all assumptions and
facts as being open to question. In this sense, her cosmopolitical
proposal precisely challenges the taken-for-granted 'modern' (i.e.
colonial, patriarchal, capitalist) pretensions of objectivity,
rationality and truth.4 Stengers' cosmopolitical approach must therefore
also be distinguished from the humanist classical understanding of
cosmopolitanism, which aimed, as she writes, 'at [a project of a
political kind]{.underline} \[. . .\] [in which everyone might envisage
themselves as members in their own right of the worldwide
society']{.underline} (Stengers, 2005, p. 994). Stengers' use of cosmos
is different. [Instead of a rights-based approach that brushes over
precarious questions of in-/ exclusion, cosmos in her thinking refers to
'the unknown constituted by the]{.underline} \[. . .\] [multiple,
divergent worlds and to the articulations of which they could eventually
be capable']{.underline} (2005, p. 995). [Her project is premised on the
idea that a politics that is not attached to a cosmos is moot, but that
a cosmos detached from politics is irrelevant.]{.underline} Turning away
from the universalizing assumptions of postEnlightenment secular
liberalism, Stengers admits that her 'cosmopolitical proposal is
incapable of giving a "good" definition of the procedures that allow us
to achieve the "good" definition of a "good" common world' (ibid.).
Thus, this cosmopolitics cannot be read as aprogramme or a new political
horizon to be striven for in the progressivist logic of linearity,
overcoming and leaving behind. Rather, she emphasizes that cosmopolitics
'happens in the mode of indeterminacy, that is, of the event from which
nothing follows, no "and so. . .," but that confronts everyone with the
question of how they will inherit from it' (Stengers, 2005, p. 996).
[Given our contemporary political climate, it might be too simple to
reiterate the all-too-common political dogmas: equality, justice,
freedom, recognition. Participating politically in a foundationally bio-
and necropolitically structured world requires complicating the
political equation so that equality and justice are precisely not taken
in the logic of equivalence]{.underline} (that is, a logic of
interchangeability and based on a preset 'common' measure). [A
cosmopolitical perspective demands the most complex constellation of
various participating perspectives and (non-)agencies]{.underline},
because '\[t\]hose who meet have to know that nothing can erase the debt
binding their decision to its victims . . .. Equality does not mean that
they all have the same say in the matter but that they all have to be
present in the mode that makes the decision as difficult as possible'
(Stengers, 2005, p. 1003).

#### Spatial striation expands a form of life that is fundamentally self-destructive and genocidal towards other forms.

Conclusion: Elimination of Nomadic Forms of Life

At the moment, [the sixth mass extinction event]{.underline}---driven by
human activity---[is underway]{.underline}, [resulting in "biological
annihilation"]{.underline} (Ceballos, Ehrlich, and Dirzo 2017). Against
this backdrop, the idea that the construction of a railroad is more
important than the continuance of a Sámi form of life seems absurd.
[What is being lost]{.underline} in the sixth extinction [is not only
distinct biological species but also forms of life, and such forms of
life are more than just curiosities]{.underline} (Grove 2017). [The
Arctic geopolitics]{.underline} of the Nordic states [are impeding
biodiversity in a large-scale spatial striation effort that expands a
forceful homogenization of the Western form of life based on
consumption, profit, and growth. Given how destructive this form of life
is due to its fundamental misunderstanding of what kind of relationship
it is possible]{.underline} to have to the surrounding ecology, [this
homogenization is not only genocidal toward other forms of life, **it is
ultimately self-destructive.**]{.underline} As mentioned, Tyler et al.
(2007) describe how a principle of strength in diversity is well known
to Sámi reindeer herders, both in terms of pastures and animals. The
Sámi "concept of a 'beautiful' herd of reindeer (cappá eallu) is the
antithesis of the homogeneity of a pure-bred herd of livestock developed
by selection for the requirements of modern, high-yielding agricultural
production systems" (Tyler et al. 2007, 197). A herd is beautiful
precisely because its diversity allows it to survive under changing or
unfavorable conditions (Mazzullo 2010):

The herd is beautiful if it is composed of many reindeer of different
shapes and colours giving it a picturesque unity with contrasting black
and white in different patterns. In addition, it should contain many
adult bulls and animals of all ages. (Oskal 1999, 176)

[The state is unable to acknowledge that homogeneity is not only violent
but also a path toward vulnerability, and it is unable to acknowledge
the profound losses its focus on profit, security and geopolitical
positioning entails. In its perverse focus on the calculable,
measurable, and profitable, the biopolitical state is blind to the
richness of living]{.underline} itself. The number for calf weight is
blind to the value of a reindeer mother's connection to her calf, the
number for compensation for dead reindeer run over by a train is blind
to the actual life and death of the reindeer, and the number for profit
is blind to heterogeneous forms of life, cross-species empathy, and
rich, wild living. [Liberal biopolitics shrink what is important about
living and what kinds of lives are worth living.]{.underline}11 If the
logics of striation are taken to their fullest extreme, we end up with a
scenario where the Sámi merely have the right to work in reindeer
factories:

[The brutal simplification of a complex and heterogeneous landscape goes
hand in hand with an equally brutal simplification of the pastoral
livelihood itself]{.underline}, a move [that]{.underline} [reduces the
rich]{.underline}, adaptive [complexity of]{.underline} pastoralism---as
[an assemblage of social forms, practices, traditions and ethical
principles]{.underline}---[to a sterile, dysfunctional
caricature]{.underline} of a meat factory. (Benjaminsen et al. 2015)

In essence, [Sámi territorializations express a form of life that the
liberal, biopolitical state, through its striation activities, refuses
to accept.]{.underline} The colonialism of the Nordic states involves a
spatial attempt to homogenize what constitutes living. [Forms of life
that differ from the dominant Western form of life, intimately wedded to
the state apparatus, are under continuous attack in the
Arctic.]{.underline} Perhaps the "friction of terrain" (Scott 2009) of
an icy ecology that prohibits agriculture is part of the reason why
there is still some alterity left to attack in this part of the planet.
As Holbraad, Pedersen, and de Castro (2014) write:

[To differ is itself a political act.]{.underline} [This would require
us to accept that such noncontroversially "political" notions as power,
domination, or authority are relative stances]{.underline} [towards the
possibility of difference and its control. To put it very
directly]{.underline} (crudely, to be sure), [domination is a matter of
holding the capacity to differ under control---**to place limits upon
alterity**]{.underline}

The point is not that Sámi and reindeer forms of life should be
protected because they can save the West from itself. [Nothing can save
the West from itself.]{.underline} [Forms of life that embody alterity
deserve acknowledgement]{.underline} simply [because they are
different]{.underline}, lest we cater to the violence of the
homogenizing alternative. [Biodiversity and alterity resonate with
antiviolence and decolonization.]{.underline} And alterity requires
space, in the literal sense. [Being exterior to]{.underline}, which is
to say different from, [the state, requires a space that is exterior to
the state.]{.underline} [A new road is not just a new road. There is
spatial violence in resource extraction and infrastructure, and
**"land-use conflict" is a euphemism for genocide.**]{.underline}

Of course, smooth spaces are not in themselves liberatory. But the
struggle is changed or displaced in them, and life reconstitutes its
stakes, confronts new obstacles, invents new paces, switches and
adversaries. Never believe that a smooth space will suffice to save us.
(Deleuze and Guattari 1987, 500)

it is.]{.underline}

[Spatial thinking commonly reflected within these instruments is deeply
rooted in cartesian conceptualizations of the world based on ontological
dichotomies such as land versus sea and nature versus culture that can
be traced back to the solidification of legal modernity.112 Such
dichotomies are reflected in international law's fundamental spatial
order and revealed in the way space is partitioned upon cartographic
representations on the basis of state sovereignty.113 Yet this is not
the only way to conceptualize space in the Arctic. **Many Indigenous
spatial orders across the Arctic diverge from the fundamental
dichotomies that underpin the foundations of international law's
spatial** order and are instead traditionally grounded in holistic114
conceptualizations of space and animist or relational ontologies115
Inuit customary legal orders have been shaped by the particularities of
Arctic landscape conditions (e.g., sea ice, remoteness, coldness) and
are rooted in a special spiritual connection with the surrounding
environment and wildlife.116 According to Inuit worldviews, **human
beings are traditionally seen as not separated from the natural world,
while the sea ice constitutes an extension of the land, and, thus,
international law's land--sea dichotomy contravenes the holistic spatial
vision of the Inuit legal orders.**117 As the former Chair of the Inuit
Circumpolar Council (ICC) put it in a UN Chronicle, "the Arctic Ocean
and the sea ice is our nuna," which translated into "land,"
acknowledging the Inuit's strong bonds to the marine ecosystems---much
like nation-states conceptualize the "land."118 For the Inuit of the
NWP, the sea ice is thus not seen as a "barrier" in the development of
navigation and commerce, but **functions as a bridge to the sea, a
symbol of their own mobility across space**, reflecting their customary
relationship to nature and their historical seminomadic lifestyle.119
Indeed, as observed by Beveridge, there is also a "functional" (and far
from being ontological) boundary of land--sea among Inuit, mainly when
the sea ice is not present, which, however, becomes blurred when the sea
ice appears.120]{.underline}

[Through this understanding, and with Inuit settlement in the Arctic
preceding the arrival of Europeans for many centuries, the Inuit
pioneered their own traditional mapping techniques to navigate within
space in accordance with their hunting practices and migration cycles.
Such cartographic praxes may take a variety of forms, ranging from sewn
driftwood to sealskin representations and to carved portable
maps.]{.underline}121 Ethnographers and cartographic researchers most
commonly refer to the Wetalltok map of the Belcher Islands (Sanikiluaq),
a map of the islands in Disko Bay on the Western coast of Greenland by
Silas Sandgreen, or the portable wooden carving maps from eastern
Greenland,122 created out of driftwood to navigate coastal waters
(Figure 9).123 These compact tactile devices represent islands or
coastlines in a continuous line, up one side of the wood and down the
other. [Inuit traditional maps were predominantly of navigational or
**storytelling use that enabled a variety of senses** (e.g. sight,
sound, touch) and reflect the way Inuit view the land/seascape, beyond
dominant conceptualizations of territory and sovereign
borders.]{.underline}

Although most Indigenous peoples developed their own methods of mapping
to depict people's stories and communities' relationships to places and
other beings, most traditional modes of spatial expressions upon the
area now known as the Northwest Passage were deeply affected by the
arrival of the Europeans.124 European views and ontological assumptions
of space were gradually imposed upon preexisting Indigenous cartography,
and maps of the newly "discovered" places depicting borders, resources,
and claims upon space soon became common in the colonial world. Early
European expeditions acknowledged the precision of Inuit maps in
delineating the complex Arctic ice-scape, and in many cases, European
explorers trusted Inuit hunters in producing planimetrically accurate
maps consistent with European standards and their voyage's cartographic
needs.125 As observed by McGurk and Caquard, since the first contact
with the European settlers, Inuit mapping has had to "move back and
forth between ancestral and processual mapping and impacted by the
colonizers requirements for precise, standardized, and rational
mapmaking practices."126 For instance, under the umbrella of Moravian
missionaries and Scottish whalers, and using European cartographic
tools, the Inuit contributed to a comprehensive mapping of the Inuit
presence in the region.127 The map Nunat Kalâtdlit Najugait from
Atuagagdliutit no. 1, 1861 (Figure 10), is probably the first such known
map that illustrates the entirety of the Inuit territories of North
America, demonstrating both the predominant presence of the Inuit
throughout the Northwest Passage and the close cartographic work among
the Inuit and European settlers.

The familiarization of the Inuit with European cartographic means has
been used today to ensure opportunities to advance Indigenous decolonial
mapping efforts. Remarkably, Western mapping methods are now often
infused with Indigenous knowledge and are used by Indigenous groups as
tools to counternarrate space and reflect Indigenous beliefs and
political claims in light of an ongoing decolonial endeavor. Since the
1970s, Inuit people have been highly involved in mapmaking activities in
Arctic Canada, as part of the Inuit Land Use and Occupancy Project
(ILUOP) that constituted the legal basis for the Land Claim Agreements
of Inuvialuit (1984) and Nunavut (1993).128 [In 2005, after delineating
their last land claims, the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami **(ITK),129 which
serves as the domestic representative organization for the Inuit of
Canada, created a new map of Inuit use and occupancy of the Arctic
entitled Inuit Nunaat (Inuit homeland).130**]{.underline}

[More recently, ITK developed a new map for Canada's Arctic region named
Inuit Nunangat, which aimed to reflect the Inuit settlements and
distinct conception of space.131 The map Inuit Nunangat (Figure 11)
encompasses all terrestrial, marine, and ice-covered areas, and
demonstrates that the Inuit consider the land, water, and sea ice to be
interconnected and "integral to their culture and way of life."132 The
map challenged dominant conceptions of space and replaced Canada's
provincial and territorial boundaries with terraqueous/frozen borders
based on traditional use and occupancy by the Inuit, raising concerns
regarding Canada's sovereignty and political jurisdiction within
traditional areas, particularly over the Northwest Passage.133
**Thinking of the NWP as part of the Inuit Nunangat may allow for a
comprehensive holistic conceptualization of space that erases Western
dichotomies, bridges water, sea ice, and land in accordance with the
Inuit way of life, and replaces ontologies of power and control with
ontologies of "being" in and with nature. Such an approach could better
reflect also the general scope of UNCLOS as provided in the Convention's
Preamble, which states that "the problems of ocean space are closely
interrelated and need to be considered as a whole."**134 Yet, as further
observed by Fabbi, a reconceptualization of "territory" as a notion
inclusive of ice, water, and land will have far-reaching implications as
to UNCLOS's ability to settle the current dispute over the Passage, as
well as to Canada's general commitments toward international law
instruments.135]{.underline}

Holistic cartographic representations of the Arctic space by Indigenous
peoples have also been embedded in online mapping representations, with
the Inuit increasingly engaging in such projects aiming to reclaim
Indigenous rights and decolonize cartography.136 Although online mapping
is inherently a Western tool, it has today become a part of the Inuit's
"decolonial agenda" and important tool for redefining space.137 For
instance, the project "The Northwest Passage and the Construction of
Inuit Pan-Arctic Identities" has mapped the historical Inuit presence
along the Northwest Passage, using, instead of precise geographic
locations or separate routes on land and in the sea, terraqueous lines
that spread across land, sea, and sea ice.138 Inuit trails are not
static lines as they are depicted in mainstream maps, but mobile
entities that represent fluidity across space, tangle with each other,
and create a complex meshwork139 that cannot be simply reduced to
Western cartographic representations.140 In that regard, the Nunaliit
Atlas Framework driven by the Geomatics and Cartography Research Centre
(GCRC) at Carleton University has managed to provide access to Inuit
communities to build their own interactive maps and digitally document
local and traditional Inuit spatial knowledge in cybercartographic
atlases.141 What emerges from these maps is that statist representations
of territory are mobilized and renegotiated from the bottom up.
Furthermore, they resonate with the uncertain materiality of the Arctic
environment such that it is dynamic in both space and time and may
change form inconsistently, exposing sovereignty's inherent tendency for
permanence.142

[The Low-Impact Shipping Corridors Initiative---One Map to Rule Them
All?]{.underline}

[The inter-state dispute over the legal status of the NWP is premised on
different visions of ocean space: one of the full and exclusive
sovereignty by the state of Canada, and one more akin to a res communis
vision of an international strait where other states are entitled to
exercise freedom of navigation for the purpose of transit passage.143
Although these different visions are difficult to reconcile, in light of
international developments with respect to the rights of Indigenous
peoples, the cartographic representation of the NWP/Inuit Nunangat is
today subject to other visions of space and developments in human
rights. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous
Peoples (UNDRIP),144 although initially rejected by Canada, has, since
2021, been supported through the United Nations Declaration on the
Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act.145 The 2021 Act affirms the UNDRIP as
a universal human rights instrument with application in Canadian law,
and provides a framework for its implementation146 that aims to ensure
the consistency of Canadian law with the Declaration.147]{.underline}

[Against this context, the Low-Impact Shipping Corridors Initiative
constitutes a proposal to reconcile, although on Canadian terms, the
different opposing considerations, including the pluralistic visions of
space, transcending the ones wielded by the sovereign states. Navigation
in the Arctic is a highly risky endeavor, and in that sense, the classic
"freedom of navigation" may be of little use if not supported by a
system of aids, appropriate charts, and mechanisms to assist in normal
operation and in emergency. The initiative avoids the formal recognition
of a navigational right or freedom, and instead focuses on the modality
of the use of the sea space by different actors (Figure 12). It is
revealing that in 2016 the leaders of the United States and Canada, the
two champions of the opposing sides of the sovereignty dispute,
announced a new partnership to embrace the opportunities and confront
challenges in the changing Arctic.148 The partnership includes a
commitment to identify sustainable shipping lanes through the Arctic in
collaboration with Northern and Indigenous partners. As a followup,
Canada earmarked CA\$ 1.5 billion for its Oceans Protection Plan and
launched an Initiative to identify and develop Low-Impact Shipping
Corridors. The corridors "are intended to be dynamic shipping routes
throughout Canada's North where the necessary infrastructure, marine
navigational support, and emergency response services could be provided
to ensure safer marine navigation, while respecting the sensitive
northern environment and its ecological and cultural
significance."149]{.underline}

[As such, the ambition is to identify the areas where three types of
concerns are taken into account: respect for the sensitive environment,
cost-effective provision of necessary navigational support and
infrastructure, and respect for cultural sensitivity. It is particularly
the latter issue that prompted the innovative collaboration toward
developing a governance framework to address local and Indigenous
communities' needs. The initiative is led by Transport Canada and the
Canadian Coast Guard, who has been leading engagement with Inuit, First
Nations, and Metis organizations and governments, provincial and
territorial governments, and other key stakeholders to identify priority
areas for investment and potential governance models. In the course of
Arctic Corridors and Northern Voices (ACNV) research project, 14
Canadian Inuit communities across Inuit Nunangat were invited to share
their views and recommendations for the corridors.150 The community
recommendations identified preferred corridors in different localities,
areas to be avoided, specific measures relating to the seasonal use of
different areas, recommendations on vessel operation, and areas of
inadequate charting. The multitude of factors to be considered when
implementing this ambitious initiative will inevitably lead to
compromise and trade-offs. It is unlikely that all the recommendations
will be given equal weight. However, there are potential and efforts
toward developing a genuinely collaborative governance structure to not
only design but also manage the low-impact corridors.151 This initiative
provides a good opportunity to reconcile the different visions of space
and give real voice to the local communities to translate their visions
into specific recommendations---indeed **to provide "one map to rule
them all."152 Yet incorporating Inuit interests and spatial views into a
state-driven cartographic initiative** bears the risk of perpetuating
statism via a territorially grounded conception of the Passage that
appears detrimental to the pursuit of self-determination for the Inuit
people.153 As of the time of writing, it is yet difficult to tell how
well all this can be done in practice, but the process is
there.]{.underline}

Concluding Remarks

[It is undisputable that cartography materializes the way societies
conceptualize space and legalities pertinent to it. Since the age of
discovery, European nations have been using cartography as a technology
of planning that legitimated the establishment of state sovereignty
through "lines" upon land and sea and demarcated borders and
jurisdictions. Under this rationale, as Harley and Laxton have noted,
"the state became---and has remained---a principal patron of
cartographic activity in many countries," determining the dominant
narratives of spatial thinking.154 This cartographic activity though is
strongly affiliated to a prolonged history of colonization, competition
among sovereign powers, and neglect of different ways of
thought.]{.underline}

[**A bird's-eye view of the development of cartographic thinking in
relation to the Northwest Passage demonstrates that the history of
spatial inscription of the Passage is not a static one, but has
historically been driven by a territorial rationale imposed on the
Passage ever since the first colonial charters were used as avenues for
the successful imperial expansion and imposition of colonialism.** In
this context, maps of the region have reflected a dominant Eurocentric
worldview of "space" that is not very relevant to the way the very own
people of the region think about it. If "to map is to think," and thus
"to inscribe" worldviews upon space,155 then there is paramount value in
examining how non-Western conceptions of space may challenge dualistic
assumptions about the surrounding world that lie at the core of modern
spatial thinking. Antithetical to dominant maps decided upon to serve
their "makers" and to demonstrate their brute assertion of ascendancy
over a colonized "other," Inuit cartography is nowadays seeking not only
to question existing legal spatial thinking but also to reshape it from
the ground up, resisting the long colonial legacy of Arctic mapping.
This demonstrates that the NWP is not only an arena of dispute among
sovereign states, but a rather plural space that currently accommodates
different ontological visions, legal orders, and ways of being in
relation to space. **Inuit cartography thus becomes a tool of
countermapping, retelling existing narratives of space and questioning
the very understandings of maritime zones and borders, even conceptual
dichotomies among land and sea, upon which Arctic law and governance are
today premised.** Should the Arctic states decide to fully
operationalize Indigenous self-determination in accordance with
International human rights law and, thus, acknowledge the Inuit
terraqueous materialities, then the legitimacy of state sovereignty's
territorial application and cartographic representation over coastal
waters and frozen areas would be drastically challenged. Reconciling
Inuit and state spatial orders is not only about geographical accuracy
but also about upholding and respecting the rights and heritage of
Indigenous communities.]{.underline}

[Navigating the history of NWP/Inuit Nunangat throughout cartography for
the purposes of this article is thus not only about recognizing Inuit
cartography, but also about using it to obtain and promote the local
understanding of the localities, which, given the particular
relationship with nature, may also be considered good environmental
practice. **The Low-Impact Corridors Initiative holds great potential to
merge worldviews without homogenizing them. Low-impact corridors will
not solve the inter-state dispute, and will not displace either the
political map of Canada (national boundaries) or Inuit cartography.
Rather, the Initiative superimposes one on another in a way that
enriches how we conceive of space, and facilitates a synergetic reading
of a pluralistic multivision of the Arctic. Recognizing Inuit interests
on official state maps helps validate Inuit rights to these lands and
waters, enabling them to maintain their cultural heritage and
traditional practices.**]{.underline}

CONCLUSION: MAPPING THE COMPLEXITIES OF COLONIAL RELATIONS In this
article, [we have discussed some of the early modern map-making in the
Sámi areas, viewing the mapping projects as part of the larger processes
of colonialism, missionary work, and exploitation of natural resources
in Sápmi]{.underline}. [The mapping of Sámi lands and cultures played an
important role in the Swedish colonial expansion in Sápmi]{.underline}
in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and [we have argued that
the mapping projects need to be critically examined in order to better
understand the colonial histories and relations in Sápmi]{.underline}.
[Considering the centrality of land in the colonial
processes]{.underline}, as well as in the present-day Sámi
ethnopolitical and cultural revitalization movements, [maps and
map-making form an important point of contestation and conflict. In
rethinking the colonial history in Sápmi, it is also necessary to
rethink and critically examine the mapping of the Sámi areas as part of
an early modern world-making.]{.underline} For rethinking the early
modern mapping, recent research in [the field of critical
cartography]{.underline}, as discussed above, might be useful. [In the
case of Sápmi, many of the early modern maps served to incorporate the
Sámi lands into the envisioned geometry and identity of the Swedish
kingdom, leaving little or no space for the Indigenous Sámi notions of
the world]{.underline}. Furthermore, [the map-making entailed a certain
aesthetics, which was part ofthe construction and maintenance of the
Swedish imperial iconography and representation]{.underline}. [The maps
visualized lands, old and new]{.underline}, and in some cases only
wished-for, [ofthe Swedish realm]{.underline}. [Other maps, such as the
industrial maps]{.underline} discussed in this paper, also [served to
visualize a landscape of technical structures, arrangements, and
progress in Sápmi, where the resources ofthe land could be exploited by
the state and by private industrialists without having to deal with the
local Sámi people]{.underline} and their landscapes. In the seventeenth
century, Sámi communities still retained power and control over much of
their internal affairs. [Sámi knowledge of the land and its resources
was of critical importance to the expanding Swedish state.]{.underline}
In the industrial enterprises in the Sámi areas, [the Sámi population
was needed as workforce]{.underline}, especially with regard to the long
and difficult transportation of ore and supplies. From the late
seventeenth century, [the Swedish state encouraged the establishment of
new settlements in the Sámi lands]{.underline}, which gradually led to
the influx of more people[. Over time, Sámi communities lost most or all
of their power]{.underline} and control over the lands as the Swedish
state consolidated its power. [The state and the private enterprises no
longer needed the Sámi population and their knowledge of the lands in
the same way as before.]{.underline} In this article, we have focused
mostly on the seventeenth century and have not discussed the mapping of
the Sámi land and culture in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in
much detail. However, the seventeenth-century colonial history is, as we
have argued, very much relevant in present-day ethnopolitical struggles
and conflicts over land and resources in Sápmi. In many ways, the
seventeenth century formed the basis for the colonial expansion,
exploitation, and power relations to come in later centuries. As
mentioned earlier in the paper, [we wish to underline the power dynamics
involved in mapping land and culture in Sápmi and bring forth the
contested nature of map-making]{.underline}. To conclude the paper, we
therefore wish to point to some of the discussions on alternative ways
of mapping territories and resources in Sápmi, and elsewhere. In recent
research, approaches to mapping in collaboration with local and
indigenous communities have been developed, for instance, with the aid
of so-called participatory geographic information systems, or PGIS
(computer-aided mapping). Such projects have also taken place in the
Sámi regions (see, for example, Robinson and Kassam 1998; Mustonen and
Mustonen 2011; Barlindhaug 2013). Many of these projects work with
participatory, community-based, and community-initiated methodologies,
involving collaboration between local communities and professional
geographers or archacologists. Land and resources are mapped by local
inhabitants and tradition-bearers, visualizing landscapes, places,
resources, stories, and values other than those that official
cartography has produced. Furthermore, the participatory mapping is
embedded in the local communities, responding not only to the interests
of state and commercial organizations and professional cartographers and
scholars, but also to the needs and priorities of the local communities
(see, however, critical perspectives on PGIS in, e.g., Chapin, Lamb, and
Threlkeld 2005). Here, [the need to defend Sámi rights in connection
with threats to the lands in the form ofthe expansion of extractive
industries, such as mining, and other encroachments has been a central
concern, highlighting the interrelated politics of land rights and
maps]{.underline}. [The representations of Sápmi, and its boundaries in
space and time, have also been critically discussed by some scholars in
recent years]{.underline} (e.g., Ojala 2009; 2014; Svalastog 2015). In a
recent paper, Anna Lydia Svalastog has discussed [the history of map
images of Sápmi,]{.underline} as well as alternative ways of mapping
Sámi landscapes (2015). As part of Sámi revitalization processes, the
Sámi lands have been remappedor counter-mapped-by Sámi artists and
activists. [One prominent example concerns the maps of
Sápmi]{.underline} by the well-known Sámi artist Hans Ragnar Mathisen
(b. 1945). [These maps center on Sápmi, turn the world upside down, and
use Sámi place-names and Sámi storytelling as part of the
mapping]{.underline} (Lundström 2017; Stephansen 2017). [The colonial
mapping-in Sápmi and elsewhere in the world-often involved renaming of
landscape features and settlement sites]{.underline} (in Sápmi, the use
of Swedish, Norwegian, Finnish, and Russian names), and [therefore one
important element in the remapping of indigenous landscapes has been the
reclaiming of Sámi topographical and settlement names]{.underline}.
[These examples point to a possible future where map-making is
diversified and incorporates the complexities of landscapes and
relations between people and nature. They also point to the need to
recognize colonial histories in Sápmi and to discuss Sámi rights and
self-determination,]{.underline} [as well as the influence and control
of concerned Sámi and other local communities over the mapping of their
land and culture]{.underline}, [which entails political control over the
lands-as described above,]{.underline} a controversial political topic
in Sweden, and the other states in Sápmi, today. Thus, [in the attempts
to decolonize the relationships between the Swedish state and the Sámi
people, maps and map-making need to be part of the decolonization
process. Map-making can be an instrument for state and industrial
colonization and exploitation]{.underline}, but [it can also be an
instrument for local and indigenous empowerment, revitalization, and
decolonization. In this sense, newways of understanding colonial
histories and relations might be visualized and performed in the
future-not forgetting that the most important issue are not the maps as
such but the geopolitics and power relations behind the
images.]{.underline}

5.2.1 The challenges of communication: [maps as means of sharing
Traditional Ecological Knowledge]{.underline}?

Communication of knowledge can be achieved in many forms. One in
particular- [maps and other geographic visualizations- has a long
tradition of affecting (negatively) Indigenous Peoples]{.underline}
(Ojala and Nordin, 2019). [It is crucial to remember that maps are never
value-free objects, both in the selectivity of their content and in
their signs and styles of representation]{.underline}. [Maps are a way
of conceiving, articulating, and structuring the human world which is
biased toward, promoted by, and exerts influence]{.underline} upon
particular sets of social relations (Harley, 1988, p. 277), i.e. [maps
are social constructions or narratives with strong moral
implications]{.underline} (Crampton, 2001). In the context of this
article, [we can think of maps as commonly used tools for spatial
planning and key elements for onshore wind planning of
farms]{.underline} (Sklenička and Zouhar, 2018; Sotiropoulou and
Vavatsikos, 2021) and its implications[. For example, geographical
information systems (GIS) can be used to create maps that highlight the
cumulative impacts of land-use pressures on reindeer]{.underline}
(Sandström et al., 2003; Stoessel et al., 2022; Eftestøl et al., 2023).
For example, Sandström et al. (2003, p. 557) use GIS to gather and
compile information regarding land-use activities and patterns among
reindeer herders and other land users and take a "(...) novel
user-oriented effort largely based on the work carried out by the
principal end user, i.e., the reindeer herders themselves". As to be
expected, not all studies include the principal end-user, reindeer
herders. For example, Stoessel et al. (2022) do not include reindeer
herders\' perspectives in their article that maps the cumulative
pressures on the grazing lands of northern Fenno-Scandinavia. As Shaw et
al. (2022) demonstrate [there is the possibility, even with limitations,
to articulate Western systems of mapping like GIS with the communication
of TEK, in the context of natural resource planning processes, making
clear the power of maps to change the collection and dissemination of
Indigenous knowledge.]{.underline}

Classical [geopolitics remains in vogue]{.underline}. [There is no
shortage of analytical labour seeking to make sense of how physical
geography and environmental factors shape political behaviour and
decision-making]{.underline} (e.g. Black, 2015; Kaplan, 2013).
[Geographical regions such as the Arctic, allied with ongoing and
intensifying climate change, help to nourish this
worldview]{.underline}. In the past, [geographical features such as
mountains, coastlines and sea ice might have been viewed as
near-permanent and obstacle-like.]{.underline} If, u[nder climate
change, the physical geographies of the earth are changing then it is
ever more plausible to suggest that "geopolitics" needs to be taken
literally because the "geo" in geopolitics is warming, thawing, melting,
burning and so on]{.underline}. Tethered to that view of the
geographical being less deterministic, [there has been a renewed
interest in the power projection capabilities of states and their
geopolitical and media strategizing for a "new Arctic" and/or "blue
Arctic"]{.underline} (Brady, 2017; Lehtimäki et al., 2021; Nilsson &
Christensen, 2019; Zellen, 2009). [Geopolitics is considered less of a
rhetorical practice that brings together world politics together and
more of a literal, material, physical practice responding to the
geographical exigencies of the earth. This might make itself manifest in
ordering more icebreakers, carrying out more cold weather military
training or investing in critical infrastructure on land, on sea, in the
air and in outer space]{.underline} (Strawa et al., 2020).

### 2AC\-\--Perm\-\--Co-Management

#### Perm: do both as an act of co-management.

Barry Scott **Zellen** 4-19-20**22**. Dr. Barry Scott Zellen (PhD,
international relations) "Co-management as a Foundation of Arctic
Exceptionalism: Strengthening the Bonds between the Indigenous and
Westphalian Worlds", Yearbook of Polar Law Online,
<https://doi.org/10.1163/22116427_013010005> \[AY\]

Largely [as a result of Indigenous political foresight and
perseverance]{.underline} -- from the municipal level all the way up to
the international level through diplomatic bodies such as the United
Nations and more regionally-focused like the Arctic Council -- [a solid
foundation for Arctic exceptionalism has been established, buffering the
region from contending influences such as renewed nationalism and state
rivalry]{.underline}, preserving regional order even as states face off
against one another in an increasingly contested Arctic.

It was the historic 1971 passage of [the Alaska Native Claims Settlement
Act (ANCSA) -- the pioneering land treaty transferring 44 million acres
of land title and one billion dollars in compensation to Alaska
Indigenous peoples --]{.underline} that [established the foundation
stone for the emergent system of co-management and collaboration across
Arctic North America]{.underline}, a model embraced while being greatly
enhanced as Inuit land claims built upon ANCSA's foundation in the
Canadian Arctic, strengthening it by enhancing the breadth and diversity
of collaborative structures while retaining the system of Indigenous
village and regional corporations that defined ANCSA, with Inuit land
corporations gaining title to nearly one-tenth of their traditional land
base much the way the regional corporations did in Alaska, and with new
co-management structures increasingly enabling Indigenous participation
in resource management and in environmental screening and review
processes.

What started with ANCSA at the start of the 1970s would continue to
evolve and transform over the next half century, in both Alaska and
across the international boundary in the Canadian Arctic, a process
watched closely by Arctic Indigenous peoples in other regions as well as
Indigenous peoples from elsewhere in the world. [This dynamic, living,
and evolutionary process is illustrated well by Alaska's many post-ANCSA
amendments designed to correct perceived flaws in the original land
claims structure in Alaska]{.underline} (starting as early as 1976, with
more to come in 1980, 1987 -- the famous '1991 amendments', 1995, and as
recently as 2017) and in the subsistence provisions included in the 1980
Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) designed in
part to redress ANCSA's omission of subsistence protection; as well as
the 1993 federal recognition of Alaska's Indigenous communities as
tribes -- the culmination of the 1980s' tribal sovereignty movement that
spread across village Alaska in reaction to ANCSA's corporate focus --
and in the years since, in the piecemeal, multilevel effort to align
federal policy and tribal aspirations (amidst occasional resistance by
the state of Alaska) that has played out across nearly half a century.

Across the border, the process of strengthening and rebalancing the new
political economies inside land claims settlement areas has been less
piecemeal and more iterative and cumulative, with land claims accords
internally integrating these very same processes that were addressed ex
post facto outside the land claims process in Alaska, making for a
smoother and more elegant institutional process -- albeit with numerous
implementation challenges revealing the very same kinds of clashes
between traditional/Indigenous and Westphalian/state values in both
Canada and Alaska -- as reflected in the structures of the 1984
Inuvialuit Final Agreement (agreed to in principle in 1978, seven years
after ANCSA, two years after ANCSA's first amendments, and two years
before ANILCA); the 1993 Nunavut Land Claims Agreement (whose
territorial secession, to form the Nunavut Territory, took place in
1999, but which continues to experience frictions between the Inuit of
Nunavut and the federal government over two decades later); and the 2005
Labrador (Nunatsiavut) Inuit Land Claim, which opted for a more
localized ethnic government rather than a public system, rejecting the
Nunavut model owing to demographic and economic pressures from
Newfoundland and its mining and fishing interests.7

What looks to be a raw and dissonant clash in the Hegelian tradition of
separate and competing processes driven by separate branches of
government and competing levels of analysis in Alaska appears to be a
more unified synthesis in Canada. But all is not what it seems: the
Canadian process achieves synthesis largely in the absence of large
settler populations or powerful regional governments -- in northern
regions like Alaska with substantial non-Indigenous populations, like
the Yukon, Newfoundland and the northern provinces, the very same,
dissonant, dialectical clash has taken place and continues to recur. And
even in regions of Indigenous demographic predominance, there has been
resistance on implementation, insufficiency in training funds and
support, and many other clashes between the Inuit and the Canadian
federal government in Ottawa, which has at times appeared to be more of
reluctant partner (especially with regard to Nunavut implementation when
compared to the official enthusiasm that greeted its formation), and
whose reluctance suggests perhaps some second thoughts in Ottawa on the
extent of devolution in power achieved by the Inuit.

3 From Co-management to Collaborative Arctic Sovereignty:
Transnationalism as a Bridge

Despite these bumps along the road to implementation, [co-management
offers no less important a path toward synthesis of these competing
forces, with regional, largely internal 'regimes' balancing Indigenous
and non-Indigenous interests]{.underline}. States continue to
predominate in terms of material power but [Indigenous peoples command
demographic predominance in remote regions, becoming essential
stakeholders in Arctic sovereignty. It is this fundamental demographic
truth, and the minimal settler populations in the Canadian Arctic, that
has ensured the progress continued, and that Inuit empowerment
strengthened]{.underline}, even as Ottawa began to display a more
conflicted view through its foot-dragging on implementation, and
occasional assertions of a desire to streamline the highly localized
patchwork of co-management regimes into something more industry (and
federal government) friendly. Recent history presents numerous case
studies that illustrate the increasing success of co-management as a
paradigm for Arctic governance, and, perhaps paradoxically, increasing
conflicts between the very unequal parties that co-management has
structurally united.

[While co-management has experienced its share of
challenges]{.underline}, with federal foot-dragging on making
appointments to co-management boards and funding programs to which
Ottawa committed during land claims negotiations, and resistance to
decisions driven by traditional over western knowledge systems, or
cultural over economic/commercial values, [these challenges and
associated tensions are, in their own way, **proof of co-management's
success** -- establishing a hybrid governing structure to **mediate the
many differences** in values, aspirations and policies between tribes
and states. Co-management structures, in addressing and attempting to
find synthesis in the state-tribe dialectic, reflect a transformation in
the concept of Arctic sovereignty as states increasingly **root their
sovereignty in the consent of Indigenous peoples**, and as much as
possible, align their interests with them]{.underline} (not unlike how
HBC governed earlier in history, with its overlapping sovereign layers,
devolving much autonomy to its Indigenous partners and proxies while
maintaining an iron fist over its monopoly trading rights.) Modern
states have been no different, with a steadfast desire to maintain its
monopoly control over foreign and defense policy, and its economic
supremacy, even while showing accommodation on other issues.

Much literature on Arctic land claims views the relatively recent wave
of successful land claims negotiations in Arctic North America from 1971
to 2005 as the beginning of an Arctic modernization and globalization
process, but history shows a longer integration of traditional northern
economies and market economies with roots far outside the region. The
formative legacy of this extensive history of economic collaboration
tends to be understated, with 'Oil Age Eskimos' perceived to be a new
phenomenon, and Inuit economic interactions with the global oil industry
a fundamentally new era. Such a perception has been reinforced by the
successful efforts of Indigenous rights activists and jurists like
celebrated retired BC Supreme Court justice Thomas R. Berger, who
galvanized interest in and support for traditional Indigenous values
through public hearings and thought-provoking reports and books based on
those hearings that warned of a sudden, historically transformative
moment -- starting in the 1970s with Berger's Mackenzie Valley Pipeline
Inquiry, which froze economic development in the Western Arctic until
settled land claims could provide greater Indigenous participation in
that development, and repeated during the Alaska Native Review
Commission a decade later, and again two decades after that with his
Conciliator's Report on Nunavut Implementation, and then again a decade
later when he helped to save the Peel River watershed from development
efforts in the Yukon that bypassed the co-management processes
established by the Yukon First Nations Umbrella Final Agreement (UFA).

A generation after Berger's Mackenzie Valley Pipeline Inquiry
effectively blocked resource development in the Western Arctic for a
decade, the Mackenzie Gas Project (MGP) would hold a new round of
consultations in the very same communities of the region starting in
2004, now with Indigenous groups sitting at both sides of the table,
representing both the corporate stakeholders hoping to extract and
transport natural gas up the Mackenzie River to southern markets (as
one-third equity owners via the Aboriginal Pipeline Group) as well as
the local communities grappling with the effects on traditional
subsistence activities and the natural environment.8 The effort proved
successful procedurally, and in 2011 the Mackenzie Valley pipeline was
granted federal cabinet and National Energy Board approval. But by then
gas prices had collapsed, and the economics of the pipeline were no
longer attractive, so the victory was pyrrhic -- the consultation
process was now beyond doubt inclusive of Indigenous interests, as
diverse as they were, but it had consumed so much time that the
underlying market fundamentals had transformed before its favorable
conclusion, ultimately dooming the project. But it remains no less
illustrative of the tectonic shift in the Arctic's political economy
that had taken place since the first Mackenzie Valley Pipeline Inquiry
in the 1970s, and the maturation of Indigenous participation in Arctic
development.

[It was the co-management table that provided the structural model for
the Arctic Council where an observer state like China sits in the back
of the room, while the six Indigenous Permanent Participant groups sit
at the main table, next to the eight member states]{.underline}; though
decisions reside with the sovereign, [the informal influence of the
Indigenous groups is **near parity** with the member
states]{.underline}, and with close connections to their state
counterparts, [enduring policy alignments between the Indigenous groups
and their host states augment the voice of the Permanent Participants
even further]{.underline}. But at the working group level, funding
disparities limit areas of Indigenous engagement, providing more space
for observer states and NGOs to influence Arctic policy through their
technical expertise. On the whole, however, [at the co-management table,
Arctic Indigenous peoples and states not only share the stage but
increasingly **unite their voice**]{.underline}. Thierry Rodon and Aude
Therrien describe the land claims process and the consequent
institutional development of co-management boards for jointly governing
Indigenous homelands as a complex governance arrangement necessitated by
the demands for multilevel governance in the Arctic,9 and despite
complaints from numerous political and business leaders on the resulting
'Balkanization' of decision-making in the post-land claims Arctic and
ongoing efforts to streamline this process through regional integration,
[Indigenous leaders have to a large measure defended their gains and
protected existing co-management structures, with their intensely
localized geography, particularly in the ethnically diverse Northwest
Territories and Yukon]{.underline}. In Nunavut, which is ethnically
unified by its overwhelming Inuit majority population, concern is less
with a Balkanized decision-making landscape of the sort that has emerged
in the more western territories of the Canadian North and in Alaska, and
more with the Government of Canada's lackluster commitment to land
claims implementation, and what Inuit perceived to be a half-hearted
commitment to co-management in Ottawa. As a result, Arctic North
America's lands, waters and resources remain governed by a
continent-wide patchwork of co-management boards that is, by its very
nature, institutionally complex.10

This complexity is highlighted in Mark Nuttall's insightful research on
the co-management of Arctic oil and gas resources in Alaska and the
Western Arctic,11 and Claudia Notzke's pioneering research on resource
co-management across Canada,12 which chronicles both the proliferation
and increasing saliency of co-management as a governing principle for
natural resource management, even in regions without settled land
claims. Indeed, [so well-suited is co-management to resource-rich
frontier regions, it has been **decoupled from the land claims
process**, finding its way into resource-rich parts of Canada's settled
southern provinces where competing claims to the land have precluded
successful negotiation of land claims, becoming a salient micro-level of
analysis independent of land claims settlement]{.underline} -- as
evident in the emergence of "strategic co-management" systems designed
for "cooperative environmental management" of natural resource-rich
area, yielding stand-alone co-management bodies in areas of southern
Canada without settled land claims.13 Derek Armitage et al.'s 2011 study
of co-management in the Canadian Arctic demonstrates how co-management
provides a mechanism for both Indigenous peoples and governments to
learn how to be adaptive amidst "uncertainty and environmental change,"
and thus to benefit from social learning for developing adaptive
capacity for resolving complex challenges collaboratively, [resulting in
new levels of knowledge co-production that successfully **synthesize
Indigenous and western approaches** -- introducing a "collaborative
process \[to bring\] together a plurality of knowledge sources" that
both reconciles asymmetries in power and overcomes the many complexities
of multilevel governance]{.underline}.14

4 Transnationalism and Arctic Globalization: Harmonization of Indigenous
and State Interests

[Just as co-management strives to institutionalize the dynamic balancing
of competing traditional and modern values, and of tribal and state
powers, it can also help to establish a foundation for the diplomatic
balancing of Arctic interests and non-Arctic interests
alike]{.underline}. Indeed, it can serve not only as a metaphor, but an
institutional foundation, for the management of the emergent state
competition gathering steam in the Arctic. Derek Armitage et al.'s 2007
volume, Adaptive Co-Management: Collaboration, Learning and Multi-Level
Governance,15 illustrates the globalization and universalization of
co-management far beyond the Arctic region with case studies that
include both northern examples of co-management (from Alaska, Yukon,
Northwest Territories and Nunavut) as might be expected, as well as case
studies of co-management in places as diverse as Vancouver Island,
Southern Ontario and Atlantic Canada in Canada's southern provinces in
addition to Wisconsin in the USA; Belize, Barbados, and Grenada in the
Central America/Caribbean region; and Sweden in Europe. Indeed,
co-management has truly gone global. Former Yukon Premier Tony Penikett
has observed that Indigenous treaties in Canada are themselves
"inherently international because natives are transnational," even if
governments in North America still view Indigenous peoples as
"domesticated" components of their constitutional polities. To Penikett,
[land claims treaties and the many co-management structures they yielded
are "remarkable nation-building achievements," helping to offset earlier
colonial-era treaties and the "historic failures of colonizing states to
respect their treaty promises]{.underline}."16

Looking to the future, as the polar thaw drives continuing Arctic
globalization, and non-Arctic states show increasing interest in Arctic
lands, waters and resources, the strategic center of mass for engaging
in Arctic enterprises of all sorts will be the myriad co-management
structures that define the post-land claims political topography of
Arctic North America. Indeed, the Arctic Council emerged from the many
structures of multi-level and multilateral co-management developed
within the Arctic at the domestic level -- between tribes, local
governments, state and territorial governments, national governments,
economic entities, and environmental actors, both within and across
borders.

The Arctic Council, with its unique and evolving structure bringing
Indigenous Permanent Participant groups and the founding member states
together, joined by observers (both state and non-state that increase in
number and diversity over time), is well designed for the inclusion of
new voices, particularly competing voices -- after all, it was the
moderation of competing voices between tribal and settler interests
that, through the land claims process, transformed Arctic governance
into a meaningfully collaborative process that in many cases
successfully balances those voices, finding consensus despite the many
asymmetries of the actors involved. The Arctic Council is thus firmly
(and deeply) rooted in collaboration, bringing co-management to the
global stage.

On 10 September 2019, Canada's Liberal government quietly released its
long-awaited Arctic and Northern Policy Framework (ANPF). After four
years of development, the document appeared on the Crown-Indigenous
Relations and Northern Affairs website. It included no photos, maps, or
even a downloadable pdf -- just a wave of words, over 17,000 in the main
chapter alone. The single infographic that accompanied the framework's
release captured its main "highlights": [that a
"whole-of-**government**, **co-development**" process that created the
framework involved the three territorial governments, over **25
Indigenous organizations**, as well as three provincial governments. 1
This collaborative process represents the "**profound change** of
direction" that the Government of Canada highlights]{.underline} in the
opening sentence of the ANPF. 3 Iqaluit Mayor Madeleine Redfern noted
how "the [framework speaks to the fact that we need to be more
**collaborative**, more **strategic**]{.underline}. It's not a strategy
per se, other than to say we need to actually be working together."2 The
government's emphasis on collaborative governance recognizes that when
Ottawa has defined problems facing the North incorrectly or has set the
wrong priorities, with little consultation from Northerners, policy
responses have been shortsighted and ineffective. While critics have
lauded the process involved in co-developing the framework, they have
questioned the hasty release of what seems to be a partially-developed
document, coming just a day before the federal government announced
Canada's 2019 federal election. The ANPF appeared with no budget,
timelines, or clear plan to address the wide array of challenges and
issues identified. Critics have labelled the Arctic Yearbook 2019
Kikkert & Lackenbauer 2 framework a "half-baked" and "chaotic mess"4
that simply lists well-known issues and gives "lip service to addressing
the problems,"5 [while providing no "concrete" plan for action. 6 The
ANPF highlights many well-known issues that Northerners have identified
for years, including **climate change** impacts, food insecurity,
**poverty**, **health inequalities**, and housing shortages. It is
useful in reinforcing **common understandings** of these problems with
those most affected, reiterating the importance of these issues to the
general Canadian public, and setting **priorities for federal
policy**.]{.underline} [The framework also points out that the
**government** and its **Indigenous** and territorial partners have
already acted on some of the challenges and opportunities identified
during the long co-development process -- particularly through
innovative and unique **community-based initiatives**]{.underline}. The
ANPF's expressed objective, however, is to provide a "roadmap" to
[achieve the "**shared vision**" co-developed by the groups involved in
the process. If this is a roadmap, it is one with few clear directions
-- a map that identifies hazards, problems, and
opportunities]{.underline}, but does little to illuminate how the
federal government will work practically with its partners [to navigate
the complex terrain around **myriad Arctic policy** priorities and
seemingly **intractable political dilemmas**.]{.underline}

[Assessing Climate Impacts and Science Needs ]{.underline}

[Assessing the science needs of Alaska Native Tribes, communities, and
entities is an important first step in supporting the
Indigenous Peoples of Alaska as they develop and implement effective
climate adaptation strategies. Several CASC
projects have worked with Alaska Native communities to identify their
current capacity to adapt to climate impacts and determine what
information is needed to build upon this capacity. ]{.underline}

Project Example: [Community Observations on Climate Change: Arctic
Village, Fort Yukon, and Venetie,
Alaska](https://cascprojects.org/#/project/4f831626e4b0e84f6086809b/5a0b4b12e4b09af898cb70a7) 

Summary: [The Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium and the Alaska CASC
organized a series of assessments to better understand the impacts of
climate change on the Upper Yukon area of interior Alaska, including the
Arctic Village, Fort Yukon, and Venetie communities. The USGS partnered
with the Arctic Village Traditional
Council, Gwichyaa Zhee Gwich'in Tribal Council, and the Venetie Village
Council to provide support for this project, while three regional Tribal
organizations, the Council of Athabascan Tribal Governments, the Tanana
Chiefs Conference, and the Yukon River Intertribal Watershed Council,
performed the assessments]{.underline}. Through tours, interviews, data
collection, and public meetings, [project leaders identified negative
health outcomes exacerbated by climate change, such as respiratory
problems from wildfire smoke inhalation, and implemented programs to
mitigate these impacts, such as purchasing air filtration
systems.]{.underline} 

[Building Capacity ]{.underline}

The CASCs support and enhance the capacity of Alaska Native Tribes and
communities to adapt to the impacts of climate change. These efforts
support Indigenous staff in assessing their vulnerability to climate
change by providing trainings on climate science, available data
resources, and data collection techniques and by developing a system of
support that builds shared learning among communities on the front lines
of climate change. 

Project Example: [Yukon River Basin Indigenous Observation
Network](https://cascprojects.org/#/project/4f831626e4b0e84f6086809b/59efa6d0e4b0220bbd99b1b5) 

Summary: [The Alaska CASC supports the Indigenous Observation Network
(ION), a community-based project initiated by the Yukon River
Inter-Tribal Watershed Council and the USGS. Capitalizing on existing
USGS monitoring and research infrastructure, ION investigates changes in
surface water geochemistry and active layer dynamics throughout the
Yukon River Basin. ION is one of the largest Indigenous water quality
networks in the world and has enabled the first assessment of long-term
changes in water movement and chemistry over a large geographic
region. ]{.underline}

Project Example: [Alaska Tribal Resilience Learning
Network](https://akcasc.org/aktrln/) 

Summary: [Alaska Tribal communities are experiencing rapid changes on
the lands and ecosystems they live and rely on. Responding to these
rapid changes requires ongoing learning to adapt. The Alaska Tribal
Resilience Learning Network provides a space for Alaska Tribes and
Indigenous communities to share knowledge, learn from one another,
build upon and improve solutions successful in other Tribal communities,
and leverage the skills and expertise of the CASC science
community. ]{.underline}

[Understanding the Effects of Climate Change
on Culturally-Important Resources ]{.underline}

[The CASCs partner with Alaska Native Tribes to assess the impacts of
climate change on food, water, and other culturally important resources
to improve understanding of how the abundance and distribution of
these resources might shift over time and to identify priority
management activities. ]{.underline}

Project Example: [Vulnerability of Subsistence Systems in the
Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta,
Alaska](http://www.usgs.gov/center-news/vulnerability-subsistence-systems-yukon-kuskokwim-delta-alaska)

Summary: [Subsistence hunting provides a critical source of food for
Alaska Natives and is foundational to Arctic Indigenous cultural
practices and way of life. Yet shifts in seasonal weather patterns,
permafrost thawing, and sea level rise are forcing Indigenous peoples in
the Yukon Kuskokwim Delta to alter their traditional practices. This
study, authored by researchers at the USGS, the Alaska CASC,
and partners at the U.S. Forest Service and Yukon River Inter-Tribal
Watershed Council, explored the vulnerability of subsistence practices
in the Cup'ik village of Chevak and the Yup'ik village of Kotlik. They
found that environmental changes affected hunters' access to important
resources such as moose and that late thaws reduced success in bird and
fish harvests. ]{.underline}

[Incorporating Traditional Knowledge
into Adaptation Planning ]{.underline}

[Traditional and local ecological knowledge can provide significant and
unique information about the natural world that might not otherwise be
readily available through Western science. Several CASC projects with
Alaska Natives focused on gathering Traditional Knowledge and including
them in local climate adaptation planning. ]{.underline}

Summary: [Wild berries are a valued traditional food
for the Chenega Bay, Eyak, Nanwalek, Port Graham, Qutekcak, Tatitlek,
and Valdez Tribes of the Chugachmiut Tribal Consortium in the Chugach
region of south-central Alaska. From 2008 to 2012, wild berry
populations in the Chugach region were decimated by an unexpected
outbreak of moths, thought to have been brought about by shifting
climate conditions. A project supported by the Alaska and Northwest
CASCs used remote sensing imagery, field data, and
local Tribal Knowledge to create maps and models to help Tribal managers
identify prime areas for berry restoration. The resulting products are
helping Tribal forest managers and local landowners target their berry
restoration efforts where they are most likely to be successful and
protected from future insect outbreaks, contributing to the
reestablishment and future resilience of wild berry
populations.]{.underline} 

#### [DO BOTH]{.underline}. The [action]{.underline} of the plan doesn't commit to any political or ideological stance.

The goals and requirements for membership and expected behavior of
members during the recruitment process and after admittance into the
revolutionary party differ widely from those of the mass organization.
Party members must be of one mind and move in lockstep with one another
politically and ideologically. This is a part of the Democratic
Centralism our party adheres to. Proper planning and preparation are
valued in both the party as well as the mass org. However, it is in the
mass org where the people will begin to embrace these values and, with
each passing success, be filled with the revolutionary consciousness and
confidence that has been stolen from them by this system. The various
PSO collectives and the National Secretariat, when it has been
established, should absolutely work from a plan of action that will
accurately reflect the current conditions. [A **plan**]{.underline} of
action [is **distinctly different** from a political line]{.underline}.
[Having and working according to a plan **doesn\'t require political or
ideological unity**]{.underline}.

[We can all plan to go **skating**]{.underline} this weekend. [We can
lay out the **time**]{.underline}, [the **location**]{.underline}, [and
who all will be **attending**]{.underline}. [Those responsible
for]{.underline} the [planning]{.underline} of this outing [could be
communists]{.underline}, [anarchists]{.underline},
[Democrats]{.underline}, [Republicans]{.underline},
[Christians]{.underline}, [Muslims]{.underline}, [etc]{.underline}. [And
we can still have a **very successful event**]{.underline}. And that is
because [this plan only requires **programmatic unity**]{.underline},
[meaning that we only have to agree on the **overall idea**]{.underline}
of skating this weekend [and how we will **logistically carry this
out**]{.underline}. [We **do not have to be of one mind** politically or
ideologically for this to happen]{.underline}. It is much the same with
the PSO and our 10 Point Program. One does not have to be Maoist or even
a communist to participate. [One simply needs to be in unity with the
ideas]{.underline} that people should have food, shelter, education, and
be allowed to be free of police brutality and terror, etc.

A comrade asked in reference to this analogy, \"[But doesn't everyone
have a **reason** for doing that]{.underline} \[skating\]
[event?]{.underline} [And for not going to the park or the movies
**instead**?]{.underline} [And then wouldn\'t those reasons
**influence** what they do or don\'t do in the future?]{.underline} [It
seems that]{.underline} the [belief]{.underline} that people should have
food, shelter, education, and be free of police brutality and terror [is
**political** and]{.underline} that [those beliefs inform what they are
all are doing]{.underline}.\" They went on to say that \"PSO may not
have to have full ideological and political unity on the level of a
Party, but don\'t we have to have something, even if it\'s a lot less
comprehensive?\"

Yes! And that \"something\" is unity with the 10 Points. Which was
designed to meet the people exactly where they are at, and are things
that almost everyone in the oppressed communities can agree on despite
one\'s political or ideological views. Those 10 points and people
wanting to have access to those things are very much political ideas (as
is every other issue in society, as politics is defined as simply
concentrated economics or the very human desire to have food, shelter,
clothing, or resources with which to procure these things for ourselves
and our families/communities). But [something being political in
**nature** and people\'s **stances** being political]{.underline} - as
every stance is political, even the decision to be apolitical - [**does
not mean** that we all must **share the same political** or
**ideological line** or even **need** to]{.underline}, [in order to
**effect change**]{.underline} on a programmatic level, which again, is
what the PSO is about.

Let\'s take the skating scenario a bit further. All of the [people
involved]{.underline} would definitely [have their **own reasons** for
agreeing to go skating as opposed to engaging in some other
activity]{.underline}. And [yes]{.underline}, [their reasons would be
**political** as is **everything**]{.underline}. [But those politics or
motives could **very well differ** from the others in the
group]{.underline} who agreed to go skating. So [while everyone who is
involved in]{.underline} the [planning and execution]{.underline} of
this outing [is political and their decisions to be a part]{.underline}
of this skating group [are political]{.underline}, [they **would not all
need to be unified around the same political ideology** to come up with
a **successful plan**]{.underline}.

[Some]{.underline} people [may have chosen skating for
**exercise**]{.underline} because they value physical fitness over the
other options, [some may]{.underline} have chosen to go because they
[enjoy the **nachos**]{.underline} served in the skating rink\'s food
court; and [others may be]{.underline} going because they were
**[bored]{.underline}** and this seemed like something easy and fun to
do; and [still others may]{.underline} have beef with the rink\'s owner
because they take issue with the condition of the rink, and believe that
the rink should be run by and for the community, and [hope to **win
support** from the other skaters for a political action]{.underline} at
the rink. That last group would be the party. [We will many times
**unite programmatically** with people whose politics are **different**
from ours as long as the contradictions aren't
**antagonistic**]{.underline}, [with the hope of winning the other
groups to a **deeper political understanding** or of gaining **partial
demands** that will **lay the groundwork** for later **more complete**
or **revolutionary gains**]{.underline}. [We will lay plans with these
groups]{.underline} that in many cases will be successful [but this is
**not the same** as adhering to a **cohesive political** and
**ideological line**]{.underline}.

Institute - Center for Circumpolar Security Studies,

苗

The [history of the Arctic is one of colonization, oppression of
language and culture, exploitation of natural resources, and
depopulation]{.underline}. These issues are largely the result of
decisions made outside the Arctic without the participation or consent
of the people living there and with little regard for the existing
cultural and natural value. [The **future of the Arctic** must be
**driven and guided by young leaders** and **Indigenous peoples** with a
strong connection to the region.]{.underline}

The [most important factor for a better future for the Arctic is to put
**young experts** from the Arctic in **leadership roles** related to the
region]{.underline} and **[include them in the knowledge
creation]{.underline}** that is the basis for decision-making processes.
Re[gional youth collectives in northern Sweden and Norway have
articulated this demand in their visions for the futur]{.underline}e,
see Sweden's Youth 2030 Movement1) and Norway Youth Panel's Arctic White
Paper.2[) Contributions such as these emphasize that youth leadership in
the region can only be achieved by letting young leaders emerge from
Arctic communities]{.underline} and making the Arctic an attractive
place for young people to settle down and live their lives.

is in this context that the 2023 Arctic Policy Hackathon3) -- organized
by The Gordon Foundation, Global Affairs Canada, and the Arctic Mayors'
Forum -- brought together young leaders from Arctic Indigenous and local
communities across northern Canada, Alaska, Greenland, Iceland, Finland,
Norway, and Sápmi/Sweden. We met in Reykjavík to examine how to keep the
next generation of leaders in Arctic communities and produced a set of
policy recommendations.4) Our ideas emerged from conversations with one
another based on our respective experiences across the Arctic. While we
drew inspiration from some localized examples, we set out to create
broad new ideas that could resonate across the region. This article is
my contribution on what it will take to keep the next generation of
leaders in the Arctic, based on the group's policy recommendations.

In the policy recommendations authored by the group of young Arctic
leaders at the Hackathon we attempted to answer these questions through
a set of policy recommendations organized into three themes:

Culture and community

Sustainable development

Holistic wellness

Culture and Community

[Leadership roles in the Arctic must prioritize local youth, Indigenous
people, and minority groups]{.underline}. This requires succession plans
with mentorship and training, reduced credential barriers, and
recognition of local expertise as equal to formal qualifications, as
exemplified by First Alaskans Institute.5) or Aqquimavvik Arviat
Wellness Society.6) [Initiatives such as these work to advance local and
Indigenous]{.underline} [groups in the Arctic through leadership
development, community engagement, and **integration**
**between**]{.underline} **[traditional knowledge and modern
approaches]{.underline}**. Community [development based on
young]{.underline} and Indigenous [expertise]{.underline} with [strong,
local ties]{.underline} to the different regions in the [Arctic is
fundamental in securing inclusive and **representative leadership for
the** **Arctic**.]{.underline}

[Governments, companies, and international entities have huge interests
in the region and their actions can determine the future of thousands of
Indigenous and Arctic people]{.underline}. Many, if not most of these
actors' [**main power centers lie outside the Arctic,** in parliaments,
headquarters, or board rooms]{.underline}. It is important that the
Arctic is a part of the international community[, and **we welcome
cooperation** and **co**-**creation** with these **wielders of
power,**]{.underline} but it [is crucial to ensure the involvement of
the people of the region. Indigenous and Arctic youths must be given
leadership roles within the international entities and companies that
are involved in the development of the Arctic and **co-determination
must be a priority**]{.underline}. These leadership roles could be
achieved through recruitment of young professionals from the region,
establishing local and regional advisory boards or reserving board seats
at the executive level being given to representatives from the
communities.

The [rights of oppressed groups must be a key pillar in the development
of the Arctic]{.underline}. Increasing exposure to diverse populations
and perspectives, through awareness and learning opportunities led by
youth for their community, such [as public awareness campaigns
(2SLGBTQQIA+, gender identity) is vital]{.underline}. Creating more
opportunities for positive interactions will create a sense of safety
and belonging in lives and communities. Additionally, creating safer
spaces will allow for acceptance and inclusion of diverse multicultural
identities, promoting a holistic sense of community that is attractive
and welcoming to all, for instance, Samtökin '78, the National Queer
Association of Iceland has an extensive refugee welcoming program.7)
This [will not only **make the lives of those living in the Arctic
better** but will also **increase the attractiveness of the region** to
young people around the world.]{.underline}

[Sustainable Development]{.underline}

Whereas in the past, the [economic value created in the Arctic was for
the most part dependent on the extraction of natural
resources]{.underline},8) this is **[not sustainable]{.underline}** in
the long run and creates very little lasting value for the communities
in the region.9) [The **Arctic's future** must focus on **exporting
knowledge**, **innovation**, and **expertise** to create enduring value
for its people.]{.underline}

[Arctic-focused research and innovation hubs should be established in
key regions through **public-private partnerships**]{.underline},
**[concentrating on renewable energy technologies]{.underline}**,
**[climate adaptation solutions]{.underline}**, and **[sustainable
fisheries management]{.underline}**. These centers must also [launch
programs]{.underline} to [train local]{.underline} [youth]{.underline}
and [Indigenous people in emerging fields such as green
energy]{.underline}, [digital technology]{.underline}, [and sustainable
agriculture, fostering a skilled and innovative workforce.]{.underline}

[Policies]{.underline} must [ensure a significant portion of
Arctic-based projects are locally owned, **supported by tax incentives
f**]{.underline}or companies that prioritize local shareholders and
**[reinvest profits into communities.]{.underline}** Additionally,
**[grants and low-interest loans]{.underline}** [should be provided to
Indigenous entrepreneurs to develop businesses aligned with Arctic
values]{.underline}, including **[ecotourism]{.underline}**,
**[artisanal crafts]{.underline}**, and **[renewable
energy]{.underline}** **[ventures]{.underline}**, [which will strengthen
local economies]{.underline}. Companies carrying out operations in the
Arctic should be, to a larger degree, required to hire workers locally
and ensure that important positions are held by people who are a part of
the community.10)

[Legislation should mandate that all major Arctic development projects
**publish detailed impact assessments** outlining affected territories,
resources, and communities.]{.underline} **[Regional
councils]{.underline}** comprising local community representatives,
[Indigenous groups, and youth must review and approve these projects to
ensure diverse perspectives guide decisions]{.underline}. Digital
platforms offering real-time updates on project goals and progress will
further enhance public scrutiny and feedback.

A portion of [revenues from Arctic resource **extraction and
development**]{.underline} [projects]{.underline} must be
**[reinvested]{.underline}** into [community infrastructure, education,
and cultural preservation initiatives]{.underline}. Additionally, a
regional investment fund managed by Arctic community representatives
should be established to support long-term projects that align with the
region's sustainable development goals.

By focusing on these **[concrete initiatives]{.underline}**, the [Arctic
can transition to a sustainable economy rooted]{.underline} in
[innovation and inclusivity]{.underline}. Transparent governance, local
empowerment, and strategic investments will ensure the region's growth
benefits its people and preserves its cultural and natural heritage for
future generations.

Holistic Wellness

There is a [lack of accessible, culturally-relevant, and socially
cohesive mental health and medical]{.underline} care [services in the
Arctic, particularly for Indigenous and marginalized
groups]{.underline}.11) This includes critical areas like mental health
support, cultural programs,12) housing assistance, employment aid, and
rehabilitation services.13) To address these gaps, mobile health units
and telemedicine platforms should be deployed to bridge distances in
sparsely populated areas. [Community health initiatives, such as
culturally informed **mental health workshops** and **wellness centers**
led by local practitioners, must be prioritized]{.underline}.
Governments and stakeholders [should provide funding for these services
to ensure they are tailored to the specific needs of Arctic
populations.]{.underline}

The [quality of and access to education (including **cultural ways of
education**]{.underline}) in the Arctic is [limited]{.underline}. This
[leads to people leaving the region to pursue their own
education]{.underline}, or the education of their children.14) To
improve educational outcomes and retention, [Arctic-specific training
programs for educators should be]{.underline} established, [focusing on
cultural safety, anti-racism, ethics, technology,]{.underline} and
[innovative teaching methods.]{.underline} Additionally, creating
partnerships with local communities to develop bilingual and culturally
relevant curricula can help [preserve Indigenous languages and
knowledge]{.underline}. Building satellite schools or offering hybrid
learning options can expand access to education in remote areas.

[**Climate change** poses **severe challenges** to **living sustainably
in the Arctic**,]{.underline} affecting health, safety, and cultural
practices.15) To combat these effects, [**substantial investments**
should be directed toward **community-led adaptation
projects**]{.underline} such as **[sustainable housing
design]{.underline}**s that [withstand harsh climates]{.underline} as
for example has been suggested in Qaanaaq in Greenland and [renewable
energy installations in remote]{.underline} [villages]{.underline}.16)
Establishing [Arctic-led research facilities on **emission reduction**
**and climate resilience**]{.underline} can [position the region as a
global leader in green technology]{.underline}. For example, wind and
solar energy projects tailored for Arctic conditions could reduce
dependency on imported fossil fuels, [while promoting local expertise in
green energy solutions.]{.underline}

The [**development of the Arctic** must honor its natural and cultural
values while creating new opportunities.]{.underline} Community
ownership in **[development projects,]{.underline}** such as [co-managed
renewable energy farms or cultural tourism ventures, can ensure that
benefits remain within the region]{.underline}. Young leaders must play
a central role in these efforts by participating in policy discussions
and contributing to knowledge production. [Initiatives like **leadership
fellowships** and **Indigenous youth councils** should be
**established** to **empower** the **next** **generation** to guide
Arctic policy and innovation.]{.underline}

#### Youth engagement in Arctic scenario planning is key to developing skills that allows us to shape policy in the real world.

While [many different groups should be considered in scenario
exercises]{.underline}, we [highlight the importance of youth
engagement]{.underline} (see also Davison & Hawe, Citation2012; Glendøs
& Berliner, Citation2017; Kral, Salusky, Inuksuk, Angutimarik, &
Tulugardjuk, Citation2014; MacDonald, Cunsolo Willox, Ford, Shiwak, &
Wood, Citation2015; MacDonald, Ford, Willox, & Mitchell, Citation2015;
Ulturgasheva, Rasmus, & Morrow, Citation2015). Youth [perspectives have
been identified as a poorly developed strand in the study of Arctic
human developmen]{.underline}t (Karlsdottir & Jungsberg, Citation2015;
Larsen & Fondahl, Citation2014). Furthermore, [young people]{.underline}
have [demonstrated]{.underline} both an interest and [legitimate stake
in being part of discussions about the future]{.underline} (Cost,
Citation2017; Karlsdottir & Jungsberg, Citation2015). For [research
about potential future developments in the Arctic to be more
relevant]{.underline}, it will be [critical to understand their
priorities, aspirations, obstacles, and life paths]{.underline}. These
factors shape young people's individual futures, affect the viability of
Arctic cultures, languages, traditional activities, and communities, and
influence the capacity to navigate climate change and other external
pressures that shape environments and societies (e.g. Kowalczewski &
Klein, Citation2018; MacDonald, Cunsolo Willox, et al., Citation2015;
MacDonald, Ford, et al., Citation2015; Ulturgasheva, Rasmus, Wexler,
Nystad, & Kral, Citation2014). We [furthermore argue that working with
youth in participatory scenario exercises and workshops engages them in
shaping the future of their societies]{.underline}. Identifying factors
that youth consider pivotal could support relevant action and may thus
help sustain local human capital over time (Cost, Citation2017;
Karlsdottir & Jungsberg, Citation2015; MacDonald, Cunsolo Willox, et
al., Citation2015; Ulturgasheva et al., Citation2015). [Thinking about
the future can also be a useful complement to compulsory education and
other learning processes]{.underline} (e.g. social learning,
co-production of knowledge, or vocational training) (Cost,
Citation2015).

Jonathan **Howard 20**, Assistant Professor of English and African
American Studies at Yale University, Ph.D. in English from Duke
University, "To See the Earth before the End of the Antiblack World,"
Souls, Vol. 22, No. 2-4, 2020, accessed 06-28-2025,

I've said I want to speak a word of black life; and no one has cleared
more theoretical ground for such a word, and so, for the skewed study of
black life as a genuine largeness, than Fred Moten. While certainly no
stranger to black death or antiblackness, Moten's black study is a party
more often than it isn't. He makes the bias of his black study plain
when he outlines his desire in Black and Blur to "subordinate by a
measure so small that it constitutes measure's eclipse, the critical
analysis of anti-blackness to the celebratory analysis of
blackness."Footnote49 Jared Sexton once heard Moten state "measure's
eclipse" numerically, detailing in "The Social Life of Social Death" how
[Moten]{.underline} once "[remarked to the effect]{.underline} that [he
always wants his writing to be comprised of 49.99% critique and 50.01%
celebration]{.underline}."Footnote50 [This delineation of black study
into the "celebration of blackness" and the "critique of anti-blackness"
yields another compelling example of black ambivalence]{.underline}. And
just as we observed of the cooperation between the testaments of black
life and death in Sharpe's black study[, the "critique of
anti-blackness" and "celebration of blackness" are]{.underline}, for
Moten, [not oppositional, but complementary operations that combine to
**produce black study**]{.underline}. Thus, he explains that the "rich,
rigorous, powerful, and utterly necessary analytic of anti-blackness"
actually enables the celebration of blackness; and that this
celebration, in turn, is "done not to avoid or ameliorate the hard
truths of anti-blackness but in the service of its violent
eradication."Footnote51

This delineation of black study offers a framework that bonds the
witness of our forked-tongued tradition together. But beyond serving as
just another example of black ambivalence, the subordination of critique
to celebration in Moten's black study also raises important questions
about the nature of the relationship between blackness and
anti-blackness. That there could be even marginally more blackness to
celebrate than antiblackness to critique pulls blackness out from under
anti-'s totalizing shadow. It leads us to question whether
"anti-blackness" is the first, only, and exhaustive word of black study,
whether the only blackness to speak of is that which gathers under
anti-'s orthographic shadow. When we take part in "the devotional
practice that is given in recitation of the sentence 'blackness is x,'"
have we been misspelling blackness?Footnote52 Leaving out a silent
"anti-"? Is there any word we can speak for blackness that does not
always already presume this prefix, which is nothing but the grammatical
sign of blackness' existence within what Frank Wilderson has theorized
as a broader "grammar of suffering"?Footnote53 [Does blackness have any
life outside of the anti-black "world]{.underline} that was going to
kill" Equiano?

Of course, in .02%, we are talking about a black lining thinner than
silver's. But razor thin as it is, its sheer excess is enough to put
significant pressure on the understanding of antiblackness as that which
"precedes and exceeds" blackness. It introduces the possibility that
this apparent relation can, by another frame, appear inverted, such that
[blackness rather "**precedes and exceeds**" anti-blackness, and is
**not diminished** by anti-blackness' capacity to occlude. By
establishing blackness]{.underline} (and by extension black life) [as
excessive, the .02% margin by which Moten subordinates the "critique of
anti-blackness" to the "celebration of blackness" models and
invites]{.underline} such [ambivalence as is **ultimately skewed** in
the direction of black life]{.underline}.Footnote54 But what grounds are
there to justify this sense of "the largeness that is black life?" And
are they quite so substantial as that which the antiblack world
furnishes to the thought of black death?

Perhaps [we can pursue the grounds of .02%]{.underline} in the nearly
nothing interval of "soon" that elapses between Equiano's initial
"astonishment" at the sight of an unknown ocean and his "terror" upon
boarding the slave ship.

> The first object which saluted my eyes when I arrived on the coast was
> the sea, and a slave ship, which was then riding at anchor, and
> waiting for its cargo. These filled me with astonishment, which was
> soon converted into terror when I was carried on board. I was
> immediately handled and tossed up to see if I were sound by some of
> the crew; and I was now persuaded that I had gotten into a world of
> bad spirits, and that they were going to kill me.Footnote55

Notwithstanding the terror of the antiblack world that was going to kill
him, I am struck that the very "first thing that saluted" Equiano, even
prior to the slave ship, was the sea. And that when he saw it, he was
astonished. That this astonishment was "soon converted to terror," in a
conversion which mirrors Equiano's own conversion into cargo---and thus,
the Black subject of the nonhuman hold---suggests an interval so short
as to be almost negligible. Especially when considered beside the sheer
scale of the antiblack world, and all there is proportionally to say
about something on the scale of a world when held up against a moment,
here and already gone. The agenda for black study that Equiano's record
of the beginning would seem to set is the study, critique, and
overturning of this world. And I am certainly about that life. But here
is where I stumble, felled perhaps too long in the passing interval of
"soon." It's Equiano's "astonishment" that gets me, again and again and
always. That there was, that there could be, astonishment. Then, in the
time of astonishment, for a moment, but only for a moment, the Earth
gathers, dancing.

Equiano did not jump to see the Earth before the end of his world and
the beginning of ours. But he did see it. And he was astonished. Just
prior to being "saluted," or hailed in the Althusserian sense, by the
slave ship---"Hey you there! Hey, cargo!"---to discovering that he
really was the cargo for which the ship was waiting, and in this way
being interpellated as black, Equiano was greeted by the blue face of an
overwhelmingly blue planet. What if, compelled by such astonishment, we
fall deep into the fleeting interval of soon? What would it mean to
think the dawning of blackness in Middle Passage as not reducible to the
"social death" hailed in the salute of the slave ship? What if, instead,
we think blackness as not just responding also, but first, to the
hailing waves of the astonishing sea? "Hey you there! Hey, earthling."
What if, as our original antiphony, blackness dawns in the ongoing
response of black ecological life to the hail of a blue planet?

[The study of black life as a genuine largeness begins when
we]{.underline}, with Equiano and an innumerable cloud of witnesses,
[stop to **behold the Earth before the end of the antiblack
world**]{.underline}. [This Earth still hails and is hardly as much
world as it appears on its surface]{.underline}, which is so much more
ocean than not. Or else do we suppose that whiteness has managed to
straightjacket the planet so utterly that its definition is no longer
possibility, as the narrator of Invisible Man once averred?Footnote56

If, as Ed Roberson explains, the "nature poem occurs when an
individual's sense of the larger Earth enters into the world of human
knowledge," and if the "main understanding that results from this
encounter is...that the world's desires do not run the Earth, but the
Earth does run the world,"Footnote57 then what would it mean for a
larger sense of the Earth to enter black studies? Or, to invoke a
beautiful line of Roberson's poetry that I can't stop thinking about,
how might we endeavor, "to see the Earth before the end of the
\[antiblack\] world?"Footnote58 And what would happen to our
understandings of black life as that which is insisted from the
totalizing grounds of black death, if we shift our critical frame from
the world to the Earth, as our era of climate crisis seems to demand?
Indeed, [if by "social death," black studies]{.underline} has [arrived
at its most complete understanding of what it means to be black in and
relative to the world, it is yet left to the field to attend ever more
robustly to what it means to be **black on and in relationship to the
Earth, that exceeds the world**. The necessity of this vector of black
study is all the more apparent in the light of]{.underline} a [**global
ecological crisis** that has illuminated the]{.underline} (Human)
[social **life of the world as a still deeper death**]{.underline}. So,
[if what we want is not only apocalypse, but an apocalypse we might live
in, then **even more than social death, we must learn to study and
celebrate what**]{.underline}, by another frame, **[can be perceived as
the largeness that is black ecological life. Because after the end of

### Fiat Good---Freedom Dreaming---2AC

#### Fiat is [freedom dreaming]{.underline}. The optimistic imagination of role-played scenarios of policy change is [more empowering]{.underline} than negativistic [critique]{.underline}.

**Fernández, et al, 24**---Ethnic Studies Department, College of Arts &
Sciences, Santa Clara University (Jesica Siham, with Rashida Govan, Ben
Kirshner, Tafadzwa Tivaringe, and Roderick Watts, "Youth Community
Organizing Groups Fostering Sociopolitical Wellbeing: Three
Healing-Oriented Values to Support Activism," Youth 2024, 4(3),
1004-1025, dml)

[Freedom is anchored in the cultivation of **hope** and people
exercising their freedom to challenge oppression]{.underline}. [To
**envision possibilities** for freedom is to acknowledge and affirm that
change is **possible** and that both hope and action must go **hand in
hand**]{.underline} to make just change a reality. [**Imagining** and
therefore **working** to create a future where all people can heal and
thrive **beyond mere survival**]{.underline} characterizes the third
healing-oriented value, which [is **freedom dreaming**]{.underline}.
Robin D. G. Kelley \[65\] describes "freedom dreaming" as [**imagining
alternatives** to oppressive conditions]{.underline} of inequity,
violence, and trauma. Freedom dreaming [can help youth harness their
skills]{.underline}, [capacities]{.underline}, [and tools to move toward
**actualizing** change]{.underline} \[66\]. [To support political
action]{.underline}, [young organizers must practice **envisioning** the
future and **reimaging** the present]{.underline}. For example, asking
young organizers to reconsider what a school environment without police
and policing could be; instead of having police or security officers in
schools, they have access to counselors, mentors, and healing-centered
practitioners. Asking youth to question the way things are is in
alignment with freedom dreaming.

[Political action]{.underline} within YCO settings [was **most
sustained** when freedom dreaming was a part of their organizing
strategies]{.underline}. For example, young organizers described their
motivations for joining a campaign, as the following excerpts from EE
and PJU illustrate:

Well, my participation with EE is helping me pursue my dreams. It makes
me pursue my dreams in a way that EE is fighting for equal education.
... For example, if I don't have enough money to go to university, they
say: "You can talk to us. What can we do for you to go to university?"

---EE, Interview

At a PJU "accountability meeting" with the school district, youth
participated by introducing themselves using the same general phrase:
"My name is \[name\], I'm in \[grade in school\], and I'm pre-college.
Not pre-prison!"

---PJU, Fieldnote

[The process of transformation often **begins** with]{.underline} asking
for help or seeking resources to pursue one's dream, as well as changing
or challenging the dominant, often oppressive scripts. This is
consistent with Gutiérrez's \[67\] notion of "social dreaming", or
[**engineering social design experiments** with
alternatives]{.underline} \[68\]. In other words, [it relates to holding
dreams for a **collective** or on behalf of a broader set of social
others]{.underline}, a community, or a group of people. These personal
dreams are fundamental to fostering collective dreams. Within YCO, young
organizers are encouraged to dream as individuals, and then supported in
seeing these individual dreams as threaded together toward the
collective dreams, which is in line with Kelley's \[65\] process of
imagining alternatives. Freedom dreaming therefore involves questioning
and addressing the inequities within people's environments, their own
lives and relationships, or the settings and contexts wherein
communities are situated. [**Collectively visualizing** a campaign
victory]{.underline}, [**strategizing** how to make that
possible]{.underline}, [and **identifying** who the power players
are]{.underline} what stories, testimonies, and actions [will be **most
compelling** to leverage change]{.underline} are all elements of freedom
dreaming in practice.

As a healing-oriented value, freedom dreaming is oriented toward
transformation instead of repair or reform. In this regard, communities
impacted by inequities are involved in re-imagining and enacting change
as they wish to see it in their lives. For example, reconsidering the
culture of schooling to be more affirming of students' experiential
knowledge and seeing students and their communities flourishing are
examples of freedom dreaming that many young organizers voiced. The
following interview quotes by two young organizers with Coleman
Advocates demonstrate this point:

We've been trying to speak and get people angry about stuff. I feel like
anger is the fire to start it all up to make them passionate about
something. Because if they're not passionate about something, then it'll
just---like, the flame will just burn out, right? But if you're really,
if you're heated and you're like, "Wow, that's an injustice! This is
happening. Wow! I can't believe that. I want to make this change,
because I don't want to see my children go through this. I don't want to
see the next generation go through this. I'm tired of going through
this, myself." I think that's where it all starts, so yeah.

---Coleman Advocates, Interview

I guess that little spark could just explode into being something
awesome. You know, like a little bud blooming into becoming a flower.
Probably doing rallies at schools and---just spreading the word
throughout the city and getting youth organized would probably increase
the numbers of people coming to \[Coleman Advocates\], yeah. And
probably not just having YMAC \[Youth Making a Change, Coleman
Advocates\] based here, like, after school---probably have more offices
around the city or the school even, you know? Have them have their own
classroom at every school in the San Francisco Unified School District.

---Coleman Advocates, Interview

Young organizers' [dreams are **not naïve** or **utopic**]{.underline}
by any means. Instead, [their dreams are anchored in their
**experiences**]{.underline} as young organizers who firmly believe they
deserve better; they deserve equity, freedom, dignity, and liberation.
[These dreams are **possible** to actualize if people in positions of
power were activated to **care for** or **recognize** the root causes of
the inequities]{.underline}, which YCO supports [through **sustained
political action**]{.underline}.

Freedom dreaming, consistent with spiritual activism, is about building
a critical consciousness to take the necessary actions toward change.
Reflecting on the words of poet Jayne Cortez, "somewhere in advance of
nowhere", Kelly purports, "[Without **new visions**]{.underline}, [we
don't know what to **build**]{.underline}, [only what to **knock
down**]{.underline}. [We not only end up **confused**]{.underline},
**[rudderless]{.underline}**, [and **cynical**]{.underline}, [but we
forget that making a revolution is not a series of **clever maneuvers**
and **tactics** but a **process** that can and must transform
us]{.underline}" \[65\] (preface xii). [Political action]{.underline},
[when approached through the **healing-oriented value** of freedom
dreaming]{.underline}, [can help young organizers develop a **deep
understanding** of the mechanisms of power and oppression as well as
their sociopolitical wellbeing to **sustain themselves**
emotionally]{.underline}, [mentally]{.underline}, [and even physically
in their organizing]{.underline}, as one young organizer notes in their
interview:

Well, I think I've never been a very tolerant person. Every time someone
comes to me with a problem, I'm able to sit down and listen, even though
I'll cry, (I think that some of them think I'm a very emotional person).
Now I'm able to listen to people and give advice that they use, because
some of them would report back that, "You know what, I've used---I've
taken your advice on what you said the other day, and the result of that
came out to be like this." \[...\] Yeah, I can now analyze stuff and
listen because I've been equipped---I'm more tolerant. I think, again,
the scenario at our school of not having teachers, I was then, at the
time, forced, because we didn't want to be radical about this whole
issue of forcing the government to bring back our teachers. Then I was
forced to think of the things that I want to see happen to me and my
peers if we don't have teachers and then we are happy about that. At
first, I didn't take this seriously, that we don't have teachers. It was
fine at first. Then, I realized that I came to school to study. Now, if
there are no teachers at school, then why am I coming to school? That
was, in some way, negative, because it was going to go on and go on and
go on, and then maybe I would end up saying, "I will not go to school."

---EE, Interview

[Understanding oppression]{.underline}, much like dreaming alone, [is
**not enough** to bring about change]{.underline}, [which is **needed**
for healing]{.underline}. Both a [critical consciousness]{.underline} of
root causes [must be facilitated **alongside** the avenues to **engage
actions** that can allow for dreams to **take shape** in the real
world]{.underline}.

YCO created a range of [activities]{.underline} that [contributed to
young organizers' freedom to dream by]{.underline}, for example,
[**role-playing different scenarios** of how they would express their
needs and demands in front of leaders]{.underline}. Through reflections,
discussions, trainings, and workshops, as well as skits, reading
circles, and artistic expression, [youth **cultivated their
envisioning** of what **political actions** they would engage and what
they desired to see **actualized**]{.underline}. The following
demonstrates these moments among young organizers at EE:

Well, the only message that I would like to get across, is the fact that
[when one **puts oneself in the shoes** of the other and **feels the
pain** that others are going through and is able to help]{.underline}, I
think it is the uniqueness of one's journey [that gives one the
potential to contribute so much]{.underline}. ... Because at the end of
the day South Africa will not perish. It will have leaders. It will have
people who are willing to do this \[organizing\]. It will have lawyers.
It will have people who have confidence in themselves because of these
youth programs. You find that 80 percent---okay, you find that maybe, 60
percent of the learners in schools do not want to hold themselves in
such programs. I don't know why they feel like that, but they just don't
want them. You find that those who involve themselves in such \[YCO\]
programs, find it easier to think outside of the box. They have
confidence and they are go-getters. They're willing to fight for what
they want. ... Equal Education is grooming us to be leaders. It's
grooming us to be people who have knowledge. If you lack knowledge, you
perish.

---EE, Interview

Young organizers learned about topics relevant to their everyday lives
for the purpose of asking questions about them, crafting solutions, and
taking action to see those solutions realized. Such opportunities were
often facilitated through activities to help young organizers envision
what is possible when change happens. [Activities that fostered their
imagination were **valuable moments** for learning in **community** with
others]{.underline}. At times, [the activities]{.underline} included
youth engaging difficult emotions, such as anger, nervousness, and
vulnerability, as well as courage, joy, and hope.

Young organizers saw the relevance of their activities to their lives
and those of their peers, and this helped frame their campaigning
strategies. The relevance of the issues in youth lives [motivated them
to **continue** their actions and organizing]{.underline}. [It also
helped them foster **radical hope** and persistence to **remain
engaged** in political action in a way that was **sustainable** to their
wellbeing]{.underline}, as the dialogue among young organizers at
Coleman Advocates demonstrates:

Each youth was seated around the couches, and each one responded by
stating their name and their response to the prompt. Among some of the
responses were: organizing for a "better future," "for change," "to be a
leader," to "show \[others\] we can be somebody," "struggle for change,"
turning "anger into action." One young organizer talked about organizing
as an outlet, that she was tired of getting angry and started to
organize as a way to get that anger out and channeling it into to action
to make something happen. Additional responses included organizing to
address: "oppression," "change inequalities," "taking action instead of
waiting around to see things happen," "family" \[...\] "wanting to make
a change," and "the government isn't gonna care \[for us/people\]." Once
some of these responses were gathered, Tina transitioned into the
icebreaker and mentioned that some of the reasons for why we organized
are tied to who we are and the lives we live "struggles we go through."
And another young organizer added "the next best thing to freedom is a
struggle for justice."

---Coleman Advocates, Fieldnote

As this fieldnote demonstrates, young organizers' agency and voice were
fostered through activities that called them to reflect on why they
organize as well as what their hopes or dreams are. Furthermore, the
range of learning and leadership roles young organizers often took on
within YCO settings supported their development as spiritual activists
and freedom dreamers. YCO settings provided supportive and collaborative
environments where healing-oriented values of collectivized care,
spiritual activism, and freedom dreaming were possible.

[Freedom dreaming as a healing-oriented value that young organizers
develop]{.underline} within YCO settings [has **long been put into
practice** by communities of color or people who are impacted by
systemic inequities]{.underline}. [**Abolitionists** who lead
emancipatory struggles and **civil rights** efforts]{.underline}, for
example, [engaged in freedom dreaming]{.underline} as part of their
movement \[69,70\]. [Youth and women of color on the
frontlines]{.underline} of these efforts [were]{.underline} perhaps
[fueled by an **unwavering radical hope** for liberation for themselves
and future generations]{.underline}. [Forward thinking]{.underline},
[anchored in a recognition of the present struggle with a critical
reflexive understanding of the past]{.underline}, [enables]{.underline}
people to bridge healing with political action. In this way, it
describes what Miller and Powers' \[71\] note as [the **restoring of
wellbeing**]{.underline}, [whereby the activation of a just future
fosters a **meaning** or **purpose** in life in relationship with others
who share that dream]{.underline}. The anticipation of a just, free, and
liberatory life suggests that [healing happens when hope in action is
activated and supported]{.underline}.

[Recent scholarship purports that developing a **radical vision** of
possibilities is **necessary** for restoring individual and community
wellbeing]{.underline} \[72\]. Relatedly, [having a **practical vision**
of possibilities can help]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} it
[can]{.underline} even [**increase collective action** among communities
of color]{.underline}. To support the political action of youth,
Ginwright \[25,27,73\] asserts that settings must align their values or
practices with healing. Furthermore, issues of power, history, identity,
culture, and collective memory must be integrated into settings where
learning, health, and wellness can and must be fostered. [Freedom
dreaming involves]{.underline} looking back and forward while [attending
to the urgencies of **redressing** systems of power and oppression that
produce inequities in the present and infusing political action with
radical hope]{.underline}. As Kelley \[65\] describes, [freedom dreaming
is]{.underline} "[**making visible** a new society]{.underline}, a
peaceful, cooperative, loving world without poverty and oppression" (p.
196), one that is unbounded and limitless to imagination.

6\. Conclusions

YCO supports political action among young organizers by providing them
with opportunities to develop, experience, engage, and practice values
associated with wellbeing. We describe these as healing-oriented values
of collective care, spiritual activism, and [freedom
dreaming]{.underline}. We demonstrate how these values provided young
organizers with meaningful moments for reflection on their concerns and
needs, alongside opportunities [for political action]{.underline}. The
facilitated opportunities for shared reflection, dialogue, and action
within YCO [can help cultivate]{.underline} young organizers' leadership
and [capacities for **sustained sociopolitical wellbeing**]{.underline}.
The three healing-oriented values we illustrated via our data show how
YCO practices can support youth sociopolitical wellbeing in relation to
[political action for liberation]{.underline}. We believe that the
pursuit of liberation is, or [can be]{.underline}, in and of itself, [a
pathway toward **healing**]{.underline}. Justice-centered work is
founded upon building a better world for ourselves, others, and those to
come, as well as the environment---a point that Kendall's vignette made
clear and several other organizers also expressed. In effect, Kendall
underscores the importance of belonging, specifically of [building
**solidarity** and connecting with others for the **greater
good**]{.underline}. In turn, this experience, or interconnected
practices of collective care, spiritual activism, and freedom dreaming,
[held implications for]{.underline} their [developing sociopolitical
wellbeing and]{.underline} ongoing process of [healing]{.underline}.

Personal and collective wellbeing for youth can be fostered through
varied activities and sources of support. Participation in YCO, however,
is not to be understood as a substitute for forms of mental health
support, such as therapy or medication, which may be right for a youth
in need of resources. What the examples from our study show is how
[organizing can be a **support** for]{.underline} young organizers'
[wellbeing]{.underline}, specifically [by exercising **agency** to
address institutional and systemic harms]{.underline}. In providing
opportunities for experiencing and enacting collectivized care,
spiritual activism, and [freedom dreaming]{.underline}, YCO [settings
became important spaces to build **learning communities** for the
development of sociopolitical wellbeing]{.underline},
[which]{.underline} is essential to sustain action for just change. YCO
[offered **scaffolding** to less experienced]{.underline} young
[organizers]{.underline}, [which enabled them to
participate]{.underline}, even if they were initially nervous or shy.
Because of the culture of care, the acknowledgement of the work as
rooted in something greater than the individual---freedom dreaming---and
the deep desire for change or an otherwise more just world, which is in
resonance with spiritual activism, young organizers' sociopolitical
wellbeing was fostered. When young organizers take the mic, as speakers
at a rally or stakeholder meeting, for example, they often use a script
or notecards, and over time they develop their confidence in public
speaking and leverage their experiences, emotions, and support system to
sustain their political action alongside their wellbeing. [These links
are **key** to nourishing]{.underline} a relational process of healing
and the transformation of oppressive conditions of inequity and violence
\[2\].

YCO settings that practice healing-oriented values can help youth
overcome the challenges that come with activism and movement-building.
When provided with support, youth can lead [**organizing efforts** and
**campaigns** that]{.underline} further [reinforce **collectivized
care**]{.underline}, **[spiritual activism]{.underline}**, [and
**freedom dreaming**]{.underline}. Participating YCO groups demonstrated
relational practices that affirmed the dignity and humanity of oppressed
youth and their communities. Trust, intergenerational relationships, and
mutual support contributed to sustained youth participation over time.
[These qualities provided a safe]{.underline}, [intellectual space
for]{.underline} dialogue on ideas, **[debate]{.underline}**, and
reflection. One common practice was to try to apply a more egalitarian
or democratic set of norms related to power differences based on age. As
young organizers, they tended to be intentional about the relevance of
age as a social category and how age should be considered for
organizational decision-making. YCO used terms such as
intergenerational, youth-adult partnership-oriented, or youth-centered,
each with slightly different meanings, to characterize their approach.
Young organizers' experience of voice and power often contrasted with
their experiences in school, a point that Kendall expressed in the
opening vignette. These examples, along with the healing-oriented values
we observed, were anchored in a YCO culture of belonging, forming
friendships and family-like relationships, self and collective love, and
an affirmation that what they experienced was shared among other members
of their organizing group or movement. Most importantly, within YCO
settings, freedom dreams of radical hopes for change, sustained by
collectivized care, and spiritual activism were intertwined.

Participating in YCO offered learning environments [that enabled young
organizers to **translate** reflection]{.underline},
[research]{.underline}, [and dialogue into **political
action**]{.underline}. Young [organizers]{.underline} like Kendall,
among others whose voices we featured engaged in YCO, [developed a
**critical understanding** and **analysis** of their social context and
**core skills** for leadership]{.underline}, [community
engagement]{.underline}, [and democratic participation]{.underline}.
[These findings are **consistent with prior research**]{.underline} on
the impact of community organizing and civic engagement experiences
\[36,74,75,76\]. Additionally, there was diversity in strategies for
engaging and mobilizing youth at varied sites, particularly across
nations. [The **international scope** of our research study]{.underline}
was a strength, and it [attests to the value of this work]{.underline}.
This diversity is important because it can contribute to new strategies
for YCO to use. To further explain, certain educational practices in EE
that helped young organizers like Kendall learn about their connection
to historical struggles and building a national movement may be of
interest to youth and YCO outside of South Africa. Similarly, [the
ability]{.underline} of YCOs such as PJU and Coleman Advocates [to
achieve **new**]{.underline} state and city
**[legislation]{.underline}** dismantling the school-to-prison pipeline
[is **important** for groups that wish to make **institutional impact**
and **systemic policy change**]{.underline} \[77\].

[Our study's findings underscore the importance of]{.underline}
healing-oriented values in YCO [settings that]{.underline} help foster
opportunities to [facilitate youth **political action**]{.underline},
**[activism]{.underline}**, [and **voice**]{.underline}, alongside
sociopolitical wellbeing. [Participation]{.underline} in movements for
justice, rights, and dignity, while certainly presenting challenges to
young organizers, like burnout, [can]{.underline} also
[offer]{.underline} meaningful [opportunities]{.underline} for them [to
develop the capacities]{.underline}, [skills]{.underline},
interpersonal/introspective [insights]{.underline}, [and relational
networks to **prevent burnout**]{.underline}---[or at the very
least]{.underline}, [**recognize** it and seek out **support** before it
compromises one's health]{.underline}. We have offered this paper as an
invitation to ongoing dialogue and theoretical and empirical research on
the intersections of youth sociopolitical development, YCO, and
wellbeing. The three interconnected healing-centered values we offered,
which young organizers put into practice, show how young organizers
engage these to support political action. Moreover, these values also
help cultivate young organizers' socioemotional awareness, which is
needed for long-term engagement in justice-centered work.

Marks Adam)

A second [approach to]{.underline} [make room for emerging and future
socioeconomic alternatives]{.underline} [involves analyzing narratives
and discourses of the future and their potential to enable or disable
possibilities for just outcomes]{.underline}. Andrew S. Mathews and
Jessica Barnes (2016) argue that [the future is a site of
struggle]{.underline}, [one that is constantly being made in the present
through policy making and political action]{.underline}. Haarstad,
Sareen, and Wanvik (2023) explore [the potential of aspirational goals,
such as Norway\'s Zero Growth Objective, to shape and articulate
present-day climate politics. While some goals may seem lofty or even
impossible, they argue **that a vision of an ideal future can help
prefigure more just outcomes**]{.underline}. However, as Kasia Paprocki
(2019) points out, narratives of ruined futures---of climate-related
threats, such as sea-level rise along the rural coasts of
Bangladesh---are powerful tools used by elites seeking to dispossess
farmers of their lands. [Implicit in Paprocki\'s work, we argue, is the
affirmation that narratives of possible futures]{.underline}, [where
lives can flourish despite climate impacts, is equally as important for
what we see as the promise of speculative political
ecology]{.underline}. Along these lines, we are [also inspired by the
work of Black Geographies, and of abolitionist geographies
specifically]{.underline}, which, [through their critique of the
carceral system and the prison-industrial complex that drives it,
presents visions of a future that exists outside of the confines of the
violence of racial capitalism]{.underline} (Gilmore 2007, 2022).
Further, this scholarship revisits historical injustices---of land
stolen from Black farming families, for example (Heynen 2016)---[and
aims to create conditions for more equitable, reparative pathways for
communities impacted by destructive socioecological
relations]{.underline} (Heynen and Ybarra 2021; Lewis 2023).

In sum, we argue that [**leaning into speculation** is a generative
means of theorizing and analyzing how past and present conditions shape
the contours of the future. Here, we want to acknowledge, and reiterate,
that much of political ecology\'s strength is in its grounded approach
to empirical knowledge production]{.underline}. We [do not see
speculation as dismissive of or lacking empirical analysis]{.underline}.
[Rather, many speculative approaches described here depart from rich
empirical analyses]{.underline} [of past and present socioecological
relations that shape the current environmental and climate crises and
its uneven outcomes, as well as from lived experiments of more desirable
socioecological configurations]{.underline}. Moreover[, drawing from
fields like queer theory and speculative fiction, we see speculation as
**a means of creating empirical analysis**,]{.underline} [similar to how
climate model predictions are treated as empirical evidence of future
climate scenarios]{.underline}. **[Speculation]{.underline} [is a tool
to engage]{.underline}** [with "important **questions of potential that
are often dismissed** because they are not as empirically legible as
typical political ecology scholarship"]{.underline} that tends to focus
on histories of the present (Harris and Santos 2023, 3). The work of
engaging directly in the politics of imagination is a critical first
step toward a more critical version of speculation.

Conclusions---doing speculative and experimental political ecologies:
reparative, proactive, and creative knowledges

In this paper, we have explored the potential of a political ecology
that engages socioecological relations more experimentally and
speculatively. We have shown that complementary theoretical
frameworks---from Diverse Economies to Feminist analyses of Science,
Science Fiction, Black Geographies, Queer Theory, and Multispecies
Ethnographies---[open up **intellectual spaces** to experiment with new
modes of critique **within political ecology scholarship**.]{.underline}
Crucially, [these **theoretical perspectives**]{.underline} have the
potential to **[generate new registers of consciousness that make room
for hope, possibility, survival, resistance, and
creativity]{.underline}**. Concurrently, we have argued that [some of
these intellectual stands are already informing experimental and
speculative political ecology.]{.underline}

To conclude, we highlight what we see as the potential of a political
ecology that engages with experimentation and speculation by returning
to our initial question on the performativity of political-ecological
knowledge. Following Sedgwick\'s and Latour\'s "critique of critique,"
we ask [what knowledge generated through speculative and experimental
approaches does]{.underline}. Specifically, [we consider what these
approaches add to understandings of socioecological relations and to
political-ecological praxis.]{.underline} [First]{.underline},
[experimental and speculative approaches]{.underline} **[are
critical]{.underline}** [for laying the foundations of a future-oriented
and reparative mode of critique that **illuminates emerging and future
possibilities** of alternative worlds]{.underline}. Steven Cork et al.
(2023, 26) claim that **[actualizing fundamental
transformations]{.underline}** in socionatural relations [**requires**
enhanced abilities]{.underline} [to "imagine pathways toward
alternative, preferable futures."]{.underline} Yet, they note that
[contemporary societies]{.underline} are sometimes unequipped with the
cognitive and psychological skills needed to imagine different futures,
particularly when it comes to "possibilities not encountered
before---and the possible pathways toward achieving them." Experimental
and [speculative]{.underline} [approaches leverage the power
of]{.underline} [stories]{.underline} and storytelling,
[imagination]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} [creativity]{.underline}
[to "engage directly in the politics]{.underline} **[of expanding
imaginative]{.underline}, [perspectival, and political
capacity"]{.underline}** (Harris 2022; Harris and Santos 2023, 524).

[Second]{.underline}, the quest for reparative critique is entangled
with its [potential to transform and carry material change. Engaging
with questions about the possible, alternative,]{.underline} [and
desirable futures contributes to questioning assumptions about the
inevitability]{.underline} [of]{.underline} [current and future
socionatural configurations]{.underline}. Concurrently, centering
research on desired futures can strengthen commitments to these futures
by provoking stakeholders' reflections on how to achieve them and,
potentially, reconfigure decision-making around these aspirations (Smith
and Vasudevan 2017; Heynen and Ybarra 2021; Pelling et al. 2023;
Willemin and Backhaus 2021).

[Third]{.underline}, while maintaining a strong focus on generating
theory from rigorous empirical work, [speculative and experimental
approaches]{.underline} [reconfigure research and praxis within
political ecology]{.underline}. For instance, speculative political
ecology scholarship proposes that [the act of speculation]{.underline}
[is a form of research both because it is often grounded in rich
empirical analyses of past and present socioecological configurations
and because it **generates data on desired futures**]{.underline}.
Speculative [political ecologies]{.underline}, [therefore]{.underline},
[allow for new ways of pluralizing knowledge that center on desired
socioecological futures, rather than "just" on past and present
configurations]{.underline}. Similarly, [performative
epistemologies]{.underline} are [grounded on a research process that
also involves enacting socioecological interventions]{.underline}.
[Questions regarding how to navigate the relationship between critique
and activism have always been at the center of political ecology debates
(Blaikie 2012; Blomley 2008; Loftus 2015). The performative
epistemologies discussed in this paper offer a range of approaches to
"**think critically** **but to also act experimentally**"]{.underline}

These issues have been discussed in particular in relation to
archaeology in the North American Arctic (see e.g. Lyons, 2013, 2016).
In Arctic Russia and Siberia, there has thus far been little explicit
discussion of the concepts of Indigenous archaeology and community
archaeology---and few projects framed in these terms---within the field
of archaeology, although some scholars have addressed these topics
recently (see e.g. Nomokonova, 2021; Shnirelman, 2020). In Siberian
Arctic archaeology, there is also a strong tradition of
ethnoarchaeological approaches, which connect archaeology and
traditional knowledge of the Indigenous Arctic populations.

[The archaeological excavations at the Nunalleq site in Alaska serve as
an example of collaborative archaeology projects.]{.underline} The
excavations, conducted by scholars from the University of Aberdeen in
collaboration with the local Yup'ik community of Quinhagak, have
revealed extremely rich finds from a pre-contact Yup'ik settlement site,
settled for the most part in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
The collaborative project set out to rescue a unique archaeological
heritage threatened by coastal erosion due to climate change as well as
to revitalize local Yup'ik knowledge and traditions (Hillerdal, 2017;
Hillerdal et al., 2019).

[The excavations at the site have uncovered exceptionally rich and
diverse finds, especially organic material, which have greatly increased
the knowledge about Yup'ik pre-contact history]{.underline}. Among the
extensive amount of organic material, one could mention the many
spectacular finds of wooden masks (Mossolova & Knecht, 2019). [Within
the Nunalleq project, educational programmes for schoolchildren have
been developed in collaboration with the local community, the aim being
to reconnect younger generations with Yup'ik cultural traditions through
the archaeological finds and to stimulate creative engagement with the
local past]{.underline} (Watterson & Hillerdal, 2020).

[The Nunalleq site illustrates that climate change]{.underline}---one of
the greatest challenges facing Arctic communities---[is also severely
affecting the history and heritage of local Arctic communities, leading
to a large-scale loss of knowledge about past times]{.underline}.
Large-scale [erosion along coastlines, as well as the melting of
permafrost and glaciers]{.underline} (see e.g. Hollesen et al., 2018),
[has deteriorated and destroyed enormous amounts of archaeological
remains, especially organic artefacts, in the Arctic
regions]{.underline}. This damage will continue in the coming years,
prompting more archaeological monitoring, surveys and rescue excavations
in the affected areas. [The Nunalleq project illustrates the urgent need
for archaeological investigations to examine historical sites in the
Arctic and Subarctic threatened by environmental and climate
change]{.underline}. The project [also underlines the importance of
local community engagement and involvement for the monitoring and
protection of archaeological heritage threatened by climate
change.]{.underline}

[Community-based archaeology and heritage initiatives are becoming
increasingly debated in Sámi contexts as well]{.underline}. In Sweden
and Norway, South Sámi archaeology has been an especially controversial
field of archaeology, with discussions on the possibilities and problems
of ethnic interpretations of prehistoric archaeological remains,
especially from the Iron Age (Ojala, 2009: 141--164; Zachrisson et al.,
1997). As mentioned earlier, there have been several court cases in the
South Sámi region, in which the rights of Sámi villages to reindeer
grazing lands have been contested. Archaeological arguments have also
been used in the court proceedings. As the deep history of the South
Sámi population in their present-day territory has been questioned, the
interest in archaeology as a way of exploring and engaging with one's
own history has increased. [Several collaborative projects have been
carried out involving archaeologists, museums and local communities,
such as local Sámi villages]{.underline} (the organizational unit for
reindeer herding in Sweden). [These projects have focused on mapping
cultural landscapes and documenting traditions, land use, significant
places and resources, place-names as well as archaeological
remains]{.underline} (Ljungdahl & Norberg, 2012; Norberg & Fossum, 2011;
Norberg & Winka, 2014).

Another example of a community-based heritage initiative is Árrangádde
at Ájtte---the Swedish Sámi and Mountain Museum in Jåhkåmåhkke/Jokkmokk,
northern Sweden. It was a project that sought to generate discussions
and exchange of knowledge and experiences across generations centring
around Sámi sites with hearths (árran in North Sámi). The work aimed to
connect Sámi traditional knowledge with young people's everyday life and
featured archaeological expertise on the archaeological remains (Nutti &
Kuoljok, 2014). The hearth sites are not only archaeological resources
for investigating past times, but also part of living traditions. In
this way, the initiative opened up new perspectives on the hearth, one
of the most common ancient remains in Sápmi and the northern parts of
Fennoscandia (see further about hearth sites in Sápmi in Hedman, 2003;
Halinen & Olsen, 2019).

[Archaeological mapping projects using Participatory GIS (Geographical
Information Systems) have also been developed as a tool for local
communities to map and visualize landscape resources and significant
places, for instance, in Sámi communities]{.underline} in northernmost
Norway (Barlindhaug, 2013). [This can be seen as part of a movement of
alternative mapping, or counter-mapping, of histories and resources, one
providing more dynamic and complex landscape perspectives, in contrast
to the long tradition of colonial mapping and map-making in
Sápmi]{.underline} (cf. Ojala & Nordin, 2019).

In a study of Swedish contract archaeology in Sápmi (which takes place
in connection with construction or other land development affecting
archaeological sites), Charina Knutson has examined how the
international debates on collaborative and community-based archaeology,
as well as international agreements such as the United Nations
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples mentioned above, have
been received and incorporated in Swedish archaeology in Sápmi (Knutson,
2021). The results of her study show that the international debates and
the UNDRIP have affected contract, or rescue, archaeology in the Swedish
part of Sápmi to a very limited extent---much less than research-driven
archaeology. She argues that more discussion on this topic is needed
among archaeologists and heritage authorities and institutions in
Sweden.

According to this narrative, [the political agency of the Global Arctic
is no longer Arctic]{.underline}: "Thus, it is possible to say that [the
future development of the 'globalized' Arctic is no longer in the hands
of Arctic actors alone, whether we like it or not]{.underline}"
(Heininen & Finger, 2018, 200). [Political and economic development of
the Arctic is increasingly intertwined with politics beyond the
region]{.underline}, and [its governance is decentralized, taking place
locally, nationally, regionally and globally]{.underline}. In the Global
Arctic, [political agency is internationalized beyond the
region,]{.underline} and [diversified to include a wide range of actors,
both states and non-state actors, with their own interests as regards
the region and their particular imaginaries]{.underline} (Corry, 2017;

For some commentators (see, e.g., Brody 1976), [colonialism in the
Arctic is synonymous with continuing mistreatment of the region's
indigenous peoples]{.underline}, though national and regional conditions
vary widely, and [his- torical processes of exploitation and
expropriation do not map easily or coherently onto a "colonial
present"]{.underline} (Gregory 2004) [that replicates the injustices of
the past]{.underline}. Indeed, [to identify the Arctic region as
"indigenous" may itself be seen as an injustice]{.underline} insofar as
[the circumpolar Arctic is home to groups, both indigenous and not,
"with varying identities that straddle and challenge state
boundaries]{.underline}." 65 "[The]{.underline} \[popular\] [image of
the Arctic as]{.underline} bounded by geography and climate and as [a
homeland exclusively for indigenous peoples is \[therefore\] not only
\[dangerously\] myopic]{.underline}," warns the Canadian political
scientist Lisa Williams, [but demonstrably false]{.underline}. 66 As
Williams also suggests, [well-meaning attempts to view the Arctic as an
indigenous homeland have not generally proved empowering]{.underline},
at least [in policy terms, for the region's indigenous peoples;
rather]{.underline}, "[not only the geographic]{.underline} \[\...\]
[boundaries, but also the subjectivities of indigenous peoples have
become]{.underline} \[infl exibly\] [attached]{.underline} \[\...\]
[to]{.underline} particular [spatial con- fi gurations]{.underline} and
controlled [within the boundaries of nation-states]{.underline}." 67 As
Williams goes on to suggest, [Arctic peoples and regions continue to be
marginalised in terms of international politics]{.underline} even as
they are appropri- ated as key national symbols; and [they persist in
being deemed strategically vital even as they are routinely categorised
as a "problem]{.underline}" to the mainte- nance and effi cient
administration of the nation state. 68

31.1 Against Neocolonialism

[We have become **increasingly attuned** to the **necessity of asserting
our rights** when dealing with]{.underline} transnational corporations
and [powerful state actors,]{.underline} and such [**actors** have in
turn become **increasingly aware** of the **necessity** of taking our
rights into account]{.underline} (Wilson 2016; Papillon and Rodon 2017).
[**Foreign capital** and **expertise** is **not in itself
bad**]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} it is [**vital** to ensure that
foreign-led and financed economic activities in the Arctic **serve the
needs of Arctic peoples** as well in order to prevent becoming caught up
in neocolonial processe]{.underline}s. From mining companies and fishing
interests to government authorities based in distant seats of power, [we
**must seek** to simultaneously be open to the world and **avoid
becoming** a **passive** cog in the great machine of global capital and
realpolitik.]{.underline}

The globalisation of corporate power is accompanied by a globalisation
of risk and of concern for Indigenous peoples and the future of the
Arctic. [As the world awakens to the dangers of climate
change]{.underline}, increasing attention is being paid to scientific
research into the Arctic, [research]{.underline} that -- though **[often
well-meaning]{.underline}** -- is also often [embedded in metropolitan
mindsets]{.underline}, which ultimately [reinforce]{.underline} existing
power [structures]{.underline}, priorities, and dependencies. Each new
scientific report produced from the metropole highlights new challenges
for Arctic peoples while advancing ever-more technocratic discourses and
globalist solutions. People the world over are at last becoming aware of
how important the Arctic is to them, yet this [growing
recognition]{.underline} is [not guaranteed]{.underline} to [result in
greater influence for Arctic peoples]{.underline}; it might just as
easily result in renewed metropolitan efforts to control developments in
the region to suit state or globalist interests -- perhaps at the
expense of those who make the Arctic their home. Indeed, [international
focus on climate change may]{.underline} in some cases [be politically
convenient for powerful actors]{.underline} rather than ideally suited
for improving the lives of those in the affected regions (Kelman et al.
2015; Baldacchino and Kelman 2014).

[We **require** **knowledge**, **research**, and
**resources**]{.underline} [from]{.underline} [outside the
region]{.underline} if we are [to undertake]{.underline} sustainable
[development]{.underline} and **[take advantage]{.underline}** of the
**[changing conditions]{.underline}**. However, [care must]{.underline}
be [taken]{.underline} to [avoid buying into]{.underline} or submitting
to a [neocolonialisation]{.underline} of the Arctic. Images of melting
glaciers and starving polar bears may galvanise the wider public and
power holders to action in a manner that is not beneficial to Arctic
peoples.

The peoples of the Arctic are not responsible for having produced global
environmental threats, yet **[metropolitan society]{.underline}** [calls
upon us to forego]{.underline} economic [development]{.underline} and
extractive industries, [take]{.underline} **[symbolic action against
global challenges,]{.underline}** and **[stand at the
vanguard]{.underline}** [of a new era of 'conspicuous
sustainability']{.underline} (Grydehøj and Kelman 2016). [Such efforts
to persuade us to turn our lands and seas into nature preserves, to
transform our traditional territories into a form of World Heritage and
present the Arctic as a treasure belonging equally to the world as a
whole]{.underline}, are ultimately requests that we who have been so
long exploited and so thoroughly dispossessed further sacrifice
ourselves for the continued wellbeing of those who have proven unwilling
to make sacrifices. [**Effective efforts** to **preserve** Arctic
**environments** and **revitalise Arctic livelihoods** should take
**precedence over symbolic** **action** and 'conspicuous sustainability'
that provides little real benefit]{.underline} (Grydehøj and Kelman
2016). **[We do not ask to live from the charity of metropolitan
benefactors]{.underline}**. [We do not wish]{.underline} [to be the
realisation]{.underline} [of]{.underline} metropolitan visions of happy,
[hardy Northerners]{.underline} in need of patronage from the forces of
global capital. **[The last thing we want is to be a canary in the
coalmine, a cautionary tale]{.underline}** (Farbotko 2010).

#### Arctic policymaking is key. Collective Arctic action that engages with state actors allows for a ruptural break from neocolonialism and guides the stolen capital of the West back into Arctic control, especially over contingent issues like climate crisis.

31.2 A New Era of Arctic Cooperation

[If we are to guide change in the Arctic]{.underline} rather than merely
become victims of it [or take on roles designed to appeal to
metropolitan sensibilities]{.underline}, it is [necessary to **accept**
that **change** is occurring and then **commit to managing
it.**]{.underline} The Arctic is home to many peoples, who possess
diverse sets of needs. Yet [we are **united** by a number of shared --
if not **universal** -- interests]{.underline}, which can be supported
through **[collective action]{.underline}**, whether [through **formal
bodies** that can **engage with sovereign** **states** or through
looser, more flexible coalitions of actors]{.underline}. What is clear
is that [Arctic sustainability depends on long-term
governance]{.underline} across national borders
[transcending]{.underline} [single]{.underline} [state,
corporate]{.underline}, or even [ethnic interests]{.underline}, in light
of the **[remarkable interdependence]{.underline}** of Arctic peoples
and environments surrounding their shared sea.

[As Arctic peoples]{.underline}, [we]{.underline} [must]{.underline}
[identify what we really want]{.underline} so that we can begin
**[setting common targets]{.underline}**, planning for and
**[implementing strategic actions]{.underline}**, and **[taking on
strategic responsibilities]{.underline}**. By [creating a true Arctic
community]{.underline}, one that works at [multiple levels of
**formality** and through multiple channels]{.underline}, we can at last
truly gain a voice (Plaut 2012). [An openness to informal
political]{.underline} [organisation]{.underline} [must]{.underline}
[complement a **dedication** to constructing **strong** institutional
foundations for **Arctic policymaking** that reflects shared values and
priorities]{.underline}. As we work to define our own ethnic and
national identities, [we should seek to locate these within a wider
Arctic identity]{.underline}, one that can [enrich]{.underline} --
rather than overshadow -- our [localised values]{.underline}. Such a
multifaceted, **[pan-Arctic]{.underline}**
**[policymaking]{.underline}** platform could [strengthen our ability to
engage with non-Arctic actors]{.underline} ([including]{.underline}
metropolitan interests within **[states]{.underline}** [that possess
Arctic territory]{.underline}), which are both [affecting and affected
by changes taking place within the Arctic]{.underline}. This contrasts
with current regional bodies and institutions, which often take a broad
state-centric perspective (for example, the Arctic Council and the
Barents Euro-Arctic Council) or a narrow focus on Indigenous interests
(for example, the Inuit Circumpolar Council and the Indigenous Peoples'
Secretariat): Both such perspectives are necessary and important, but
the former places agency in the hands of the metropole while the latter
risks creating false divisions between Arctic communities, erroneously
grouping the interests of Arctic non-Indigenous peoples with those of
the metropole.

Arctic economic, societal, cultural, and political development must be
led by Arctic peoples themselves, working to develop peaceful and
constructive relationships at the community, state, and other levels. A
sense of a shared stake in the Arctic can even help foster better
relationships between Indigenous peoples and former colonisers,
supporting a decolonial Arctic politics that regards all Arctic peoples
as equal -- understanding the consequences of historic injustice without
perpetuating ethnic and political animosity. Understanding today's
Arctic and envisioning a future Arctic requires acknowledgment that,
across much of the North, "the institutional and ideological
interference of the colonial period directly or indirectly, subtly or
overtly, continues to influence political thought and economic agendas"
(Nadarajah and Grydehøj 2016: 442; see also Grydehøj 2016).

[These **must not**, however, be **decisions made by a local
elite**]{.underline}. It is [important]{.underline} that the
[entire]{.underline} [population]{.underline} of the Arctic be [involved
in the move toward sustainable]{.underline} regional
[development]{.underline} and come to [understand the benefits to
**collective action** and **collective development.**]{.underline} At
the same time, [desired development]{.underline} outcomes [must be
localised]{.underline}; [no longer]{.underline} can it be
[acceptable]{.underline} for Arctic actors to [pursue]{.underline}
[competitive]{.underline}, **[zero-sum games against one
another]{.underline}**. At the same time, as [we recognise that shared
development may require certain shared sacrifices]{.underline}, we must
draw the line at sacrificing some communities solely in favour of
others.

31.3 Arctic Research and Education

This kind of [regional awareness and bottom-up policymaking]{.underline}
[requires]{.underline} enhanced knowledge on the part of Arctic peoples
and an **[improved connection between science and
policymaking]{.underline}**. [Education]{.underline} is
[key]{.underline} to this, with actors such as UArctic working to [build
local capacity through education]{.underline}. Yet it is important to be
conscious of neocolonial forces within education systems and to prevent
the development of an Arctic cultural elite that is distanced from
knowledge of ordinary communities across the region. Development
planning is increasingly driven by systemitisation, data collection, and
technocratic discourses, which often combine to privilege metropolitan
interests and expertise, leading to local suspicion of development and
planning in general (Pugh 2013, 2016).

Without denying the importance of 'evidence-based policymaking', it is
necessary to recognise that, in today's world, not all kinds of evidence
are treated equally. In particular, the experiences of Arctic Indigenous
peoples, who have centuries or millennia of experience living in close
interaction with nature, can contribute lessons in flexible livelihoods
and adaptability to harsh and changing environments (e.g. Pearce et al.
2015). [**Climate change**, for example, will have serious and possibly
even disastrous repercussions in some parts of the world, but this
change will need to be **dealt with**, and its effects on Arctic
environments and peoples may not be straightforwardly
negative]{.underline}. It is vital that Arctic policy breaks free from
the crippling strictures of neoliberal risk, vulnerability, and
resilience discourse (Evans and Reid 2014). [**Scientific research** and
**evidence-based policymaking** that is sensitive to Arctic conditions
may reach quite different conclusions than research and **policymaking**
with a metropolitan orientation]{.underline}. The scientifically and
technocratically motivated drive toward 'modernisation' asks Arctic
Indigenous peoples to submit to a developmental model that has proved
environmentally calamitous on the global scale and that has been applied
elsewhere with such poor results in earlier periods of decolonisation.
Involvement of Arctic peoples in Arctic research is a necessary but
insufficient condition for truly locally oriented research: The
framework, expectations, and design of the research must itself be
decolonised.

[Arctic peoples require an emancipatory and decolonial system of
research and education]{.underline}, which [neither turns its back on
knowledge and cutting-edge scholarship nor find itself trapped in
preconceived notions regarding the creation of colonial]{.underline} (or
postcolonial) [subjects]{.underline}. **[Scientific]{.underline}**
**[research]{.underline}** itself -- from the humanities, social
sciences, and natural sciences -- [should be undertaken by or in close
engagement with people from a diverse range of communities]{.underline},
who can both contribute their own perspectives to the wider scientific
world and better communicate findings to their own communities (Mulligan
and Nadarajah 2008). [**Greater investment** in Arctic science is
**critical for achieving Arctic sustainability** -- but only if this
science has firm roots in Arctic communities.]{.underline}

Arctic peoples share a number of cultural values but also possess
cultural distinctions from one another, which produces a rich seam of
traditional and Indigenous knowledge that can be drawn upon in
developing Arctic research and education. [**Truly Arctic research** and
**education does not** **involve** **rejecting science** or **Western
learning**;]{.underline} it instead [**involves** the **investment** of
such knowledge with local values in order to better serve local
needs.]{.underline} To paraphrase Grant McCall (1994), Arctic studies
must consider Arctic peoples on their own terms, not on those of
metropolitan well-wishers, development workers, or political
authorities.

31.4 Towards an Arctic Awakening

Global change is producing new challenges for peoples of the Arctic, but
it is also bringing us closer together. We cannot simply draw the line
at the individual community, ethnic group, nation, or even state: It is
vital for us all to get engaged with the shared Arctic project. By
grasping the necessity of change, we can enter a new era of regional
stability, shared purpose, and political power.

**[Change is coming.]{.underline}** We may find it daunting, yet [it is
up to us, the peoples of the Arctic, to say:]{.underline} [**We will
no** **longer be passive observers** of our development but **will take
charge of our futures.**]{.underline}

#### Writing off legal frameworks as products of colonialism prevents their usage to solve real world problems now. The EU can be used to protect the Sámi people.

Potential of an EU internal Indigenous Peoples Policy

[Coloniality]{.underline} in an EU context is [often only understood as
a legacy of the EU Member States]{.underline} while the
**[EU]{.underline}** [itself is **framed** as a post-**colonial**
project]{.underline}. Following Hansen and Jonsson34) though, the EU
needs to address its own colonial legacy and present more critically.
[Although the authors focus on entanglements between the history and
present of EU integration and the African continent]{.underline}, they
still hold an [interesting angle for the case of the Sámi
People]{.underline}. An [EU internal Indigenous Peoples
Policy]{.underline} could [support]{.underline} in **[addressing
colonial legacies]{.underline}** [internally through strengthening
Indigenous Peoples' right to **participate in EU
policy-making**.]{.underline} Early in the policy cycle process, an EU
internal perspective featuring a rightsholder [concept in
consultation]{.underline} and [participation fora]{.underline} could
help to [counter current dynamics of "judge-made law and only applying
law]{.underline}"35) that often only in a last step decide on the
compliance of development projects with national and international law.
Furthermore, setting a rights-based standard and policy framework at the
EU level could [also assist in addressing the issue of capacity on the
side of Sámi organisations]{.underline}. By [including Indigenous
Peoples' representatives]{.underline}, in our case Sámi representatives,
**[early in policy-making processes]{.underline}**36) and by
[**facilitating** meaningful and **rights-based
participation**]{.underline}, policy [outcomes]{.underline} [run less
the risk of being perceived as unjust and can reduce the probability of
cases being brought to court]{.underline}. A relevant angle could be
[setting rights-based standards]{.underline} in an EU internal
Indigenous Peoples Policy on [permitting processes that could be
implemented at the national level]{.underline} to **[better
ensure]{.underline}** [Sámi rights to **self-determination** already at
a higher governance level]{.underline}. For instance, the [EU could
develop targeted guidelines on the implementation of
policies]{.underline} in the field of renewable energy and mining,
stronger safeguards for EU funding and decision-making in the European
Investment Bank and guidelines for Environmental Impact Assessments and
Strategic Environmental Assessments addressing Sámi rights. Moreover,
[the Commission could **establish dialogues** with the Member States to
**raise** **awareness** on **Sámi rights** to land and
resources.]{.underline}

Against the backdrop of insights and experiences from the local,
regional and national level regarding 'dialogues',37) these [dialogues
need to acknowledge Indigenous Peoples as rightsholders
different]{.underline} from [other actors to better protect Indigenous
Peoples' rights to self-determination]{.underline}. Although the EU
neither designs the processes in the national context nor permits
licences, it still has an [agenda-setting power]{.underline} [using
"moral discourses of climate change mitigation]{.underline}"38) through
developing overarching policy frameworks. Thus, applying a rightsholder
[concept]{.underline} in EU policy-making could also [**strengthen**
**Indigenous**]{.underline} [**Peoples'** **rights** throughout the
governance levels]{.underline}, [underlining]{.underline} the relevance
of an [EU internal Indigenous Peoples Policy as a
framework.]{.underline}

However, currently the EU policies concerning the Arctic and Indigenous
Peoples cannot achieve their full potential on both the goal of
decarbonisation and on respecting the rights of Indigenous Peoples.
[Through an EU internal policy, **rights cannot only be protected but
can thrive**.]{.underline} Such a [policy cannot only support
rightsholders but also stakeholders,]{.underline} Member States and the
EU in fulfilling the legal commitments and in actually acting on
Indigenous Peoples' rights and knowledge systems. [This also includes
acknowledging that consultations can lead to a decision not to proceed
with development]{.underline} [projects]{.underline}, securing space for
both Indigenous livelihoods and other developments. [EU decisions, even
if]{.underline} [applied nationally, regionally, or locally, strongly
impact the Sámi People]{.underline}. Due to the Sámi's rights, including
the right to self-determination, which need to be ensured by all actors
at different governance levels following inter alia ILO No. 169 and
UNDRIP, not only the nation-states but also the EU needs to consult with
the Sámi People on issues that affect their right to
self-determination[. Current examples from **Sápmi** demonstrate the
**significant impact of EU policies**]{.underline} on [Sámi livelihoods
and the ne**ed to properly protect Sámi rights** to self-determination
under the green transition]{.underline}. **[Sámi
rightsholders]{.underline}** all over Sápmi, whether in Fovsen, Giron or
elsewhere, [could be **better protected** by streamlining Indigenous
Peoples' rights into EU policy-making]{.underline}. However, such an
internal perspective should not be considered a panacea. We understand
it as [a **first** but relevant **step** because it could link existing
policies while stressing a rightsholder concept.]{.underline} An EU
internal Indigenous Peoples policy could also contribute to
**[addressing the EU's colonial legacies]{.underline}** [and design more
meaningful dialogues with Indigenous Peoples beyond the case of the Sámi
people.]{.underline}

Conclusion and Outlook

In this article, we presented the rightsholder concept as a potential
tool to streamline Indigenous Peoples' rights into EU policy-making.
[Court cases and insights from research with Sámi representatives who
participated in consultation processes at lower governance level
s]{.underline}how that the [stakeholder concept applied to participation
does not, in practice, protect the rights of Indigenous
Peoples]{.underline}. Sámi representatives do not assess "dialogue"
processes as meaningful, which in many examples leads to so-called
judge-made law when rightsholders go to court. Dialogues remain
superficial, one-sided and often do not take into account Sámi
Indigenous knowledge.

[For nation-states and the EU as a whole, these legal uncertainties can
hamper the implementation of the European Green Deal.]{.underline} For
the Sámi People, [these legal means are linked to long processes that
decide if and how Sámi rightsholders can continue with their traditional

Of the above-referenced elements, [one of the most **misunderstood
aspects** of resurgence is the notion of **turning away from the
state**]{.underline}. For example, Anishinaabe scholar Sheryl Lightfoot
mistakenly conflates critical engagement with settler colonialism and a
centering of Indigenous nationhood with "pessimism" when describing
resurgence, concluding that "the pessimism traps together work to
foreclose any possibility that there could be credible openings of
opportunity to negotiate a fairer and just relationship of co-existence
with even the most progressive state government."13 Additionally,
Political Scientist Michael [Murphy]{.underline} somehow [treats
resurgence as being detached **from relationality**]{.underline}, [and
erroneously contends that resurgence theorists advocate]{.underline}
"\...[a wholesale retreat from **state institutions**]{.underline}\..."
[which]{.underline} "\...[runs the risk of]{.underline} increasing the
[**vulnerability** of Indigenous communities]{.underline}."14

However, when discussing resurgence in theory and in practice, and the
notion of turning away from the state, it becomes clear that resurgence
does not constitute a "wholesale retreat from state institutions."
According to Yellowknives Dene scholar Glen Coulthard:

> [Does it require that we vacate]{.underline} [the field of **state
> negotiations** and participation entirely?]{.underline} Of course not.
> **[Settler-colonialism]{.underline}** has [rendered us a radical
> minority in our **own homelands**]{.underline}, and [this
> necessitates]{.underline} that [we continue to engage with the state's
> legal and **political system**]{.underline}. What our present
> condition does demand, however, is that we begin to approach our
> engagements with the settler-state legal apparatus with a degree of
> critical self-reflection, skepticism, and caution that has to date
> been largely absent in our efforts.15

As Coulthard discusses above, [turning away from **the state** does not
mean **complete disengagement**]{.underline}. It does, however, entail a
decentering of the state and other colonial entities by consciously
recentering Indigenous nationhood and land-based governance. It also
recognizes the limitations of certain strategic engagements with the
state, such as a rights-based discourse.

Another mistaken conclusion that stems from the above-mentioned
misunderstandings of a "wholesale retreat from state institutions"
relates to Indigenous agency. According to Lightfoot, "[By
overlooking]{.underline} and/or [discounting Indigenous agency and not
**even considering**]{.underline} the [possibility that Indigenous
peoples **could themselves** be calculating]{.underline},
[strategic]{.underline} political [actors in their **own
right**]{.underline}, and **[vis-à-vis states]{.underline}**, the
[pessimistic lens of the resurgence school unnecessarily]{.underline},
[unproductively and **unjustly limits**]{.underline} the [field of
possibility for Indigenous **peoples' decision-making**]{.underline},
thus actually countering and inhibiting expressions of Indigenous
self-determination."16

[When]{.underline} discussing how an [exclusive focus on the **rights
discourse**]{.underline} can [distract **Indigenous
peoples**]{.underline} from their inherent responsibilities to land,
community and culture, [resurgence theorists do not foster]{.underline}
a [wholesale rejection of **these strategies** as Indigenous peoples use
all available means of mobilization to pursue and enact their
**self-determining authority**]{.underline}. [Considering]{.underline}
possible [limitations]{.underline} of these various strategies [is much
different than denying **Indigenous agency**]{.underline}. For example,
I contend that \"When addressing contemporary shape- shifting
colonialism, the rights discourse can only take struggles for Indigenous
decolonization and resurgence so far.\"17 There is systematic exclusion
and violence taking place despite the appearance of a \'most progressive
state government\'.

A [resurgence-oriented critique]{.underline} of a rights-based discourse
[suggests that a careful]{.underline}, [**nuanced approach** to human
rights is warranted and]{.underline}, [when engaging in **rights-based
forums**]{.underline}, [one should understand]{.underline} the
[limitations of]{.underline} the **[rights-based approach]{.underline}**
for achieving particular community objectives relating to mobilization
to strengthen self- determining authority. In an attempt to identify
perceived \'credible openings\' relating to Indigenous struggles for
self-determination, the [prescriptive approaches]{.underline} of Murphy,
Lightfoot, and others [run the risk of minimizing a **multiplicity of
Indigenous forms** of agency and worldviews relating to **resurgence and
nationhood**]{.underline}. [Given]{.underline} the [diversity
of]{.underline} approximately [**5,000-8,000** Indigenous nations\'
experiences]{.underline}, perspectives, beliefs, and practices, [it is
**problematic**]{.underline} and a bit presumptuous [to
characterize]{.underline} Indigenous [actions that decenter]{.underline}
the [state as pessimistic or as **somehow misguided**]{.underline}.

For example, the United Nations\' Declaration on the Rights of
Indigenous Peoples (**[UNDRIP]{.underline}**), in so-called British
Columbia (Canada), [highlight]{.underline} the [diverse strategies that
**Indigenous peoples** employ when asserting]{.underline} their
[**self-determining** authority]{.underline}. UNDRIP, which was adopted
by the UN General Assembly in 2007, is the most comprehensive Indigenous
rights instrument in effect today. Although Canada initially voted
against the Declaration (along with Australia, New Zealand and the
United States), it reversed its position (once there was a change in
administration) and removed its permanent objector status in 2016,
promising future implementation of UNDRIP.18 On November 26,2019,
province of B.C. legislators unanimously passed the United Nations
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples Act (UNDRIPA).19 While
this is an important moment toward the implementation of Indigenous
rights in B.C. and in Canada, the provincial Minister of Indigenous
Relations and Reconciliation emphasized that UNDRIPA would not give
\"legal force and effect\" to UNDRIP and would not immediately change
Indigenous-related law in B.C..20 Aside from UNDRIP, the United
Nations\' Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (CERD),
of which Canada is a signatory, issued the following statement in
December 2019:

> \...calls upon the State party to immediately halt the construction
> and suspend all permits and approvals for the construction of the
> Coastal Gas Link pipeline in the traditional and unceded lands and
> territories of the Wet\'suwet\'en people, until they grant their free,
> prior and informed consent, following the full and adequate discharge
> of the duty to consult;21

Neither the passage of UNDRIPA nor the CERD appeals to Canada had any
noticeable impact in supporting the Wet\'suwet\'en hereditary chiefs\'
eviction notice to CGL on January 5,2020, despite the inter- national
and local documentation that CGL was on Wet\'suwet\'en territory without
their free, prior and informed consent. With the ink barely dry on the
recently-passed UNDRIPA, B.C. Premier John Horgan announced the CGL
project would proceed regardless of the eviction, informing the media
that \"the rule of law applies.\"22 While Wet\'suwet\'en hereditary
chiefs continue to seek a conversation with B.C. and federal officials
over the implementation of UNDRIP on their territory, they have
witnessed the limitations of a rights dis- course in protecting their
relationships to the land and CGL\'s dis- regard for free, prior and
informed consent. In the words of Freda Huson and others acting in
solidarity with the Wet\'suwet\'en: \"Reconciliation is dead.\"

[Turning away from the state in the above example involves exposing the
illegitimate and **unjust foundations** of]{.underline} the **[state\'s
authority]{.underline}**. In evoking the \"rule of law,\" [Horgan
demonstrated]{.underline} the [**contradictions** embedded
in]{.underline} his [understanding of **UNDRIPA** as well as **ongoing
violations**]{.underline} of Wet\'suwet\'en law. By decentering state
authority and centering Wet\'suwet\'en law, one can begin to see where
energies can best be directed to promote meaningful justice,
accountability, and resurgence. The Wet\'suwet\'en evicted CGL, in part,
to protect their homelands from further encroachment by industrial camp
workers and to prevent violence to their community. As Coulthard points
out, \"[It is only by privileging and **grounding ourselves** in these
**normative lifeways** and resurgent practices that we have a **hope**
of surviving our **strategic engagements** with the colonial state with
integrity and as **Indigenous peoples**]{.underline}.\"23 Resurgence is
about [regenerating **our lifeways**]{.underline}, relational
responsibilities, [and **sustainable pathways**]{.underline} so that we
approach engagements with states and other colonial actors from a
strength-based perspective.

[Diverse community strategies]{.underline} for Indigenous language
revitalization, [which is a **critical aspect** of community
resurgence]{.underline}, [demonstrate that multi-faceted approaches are
employed to **achieve resurgence** through]{.underline} state and other
**[institutional engagements]{.underline}**. With the goal of promoting
language speakers, there are multiple ways for teaching the language to
learners. For example, public schools may offer language programs that
are helpful in facilitating speaking and writing skills. Additionally,
Indigenous nations may offer in-person or online courses to help those
learning the language. Museums, non-governmental organizations, and
other state funded agencies may serve as resources for language
acquisition and development. [Government grants]{.underline} may be
[available to assist in teaching **Indigenous languages**]{.underline}
at the community level. International rights-based documents, such as
UNDRIP, may provide the legal basis to advocate for Indigenous language
resources. Online forums, applications, and groups can also be utilized
for language speakers. And there are other community- driven approaches
to language resurgence that may not require funding and are done more
informally in everyday settings, such as ceremonies and feasts.

[All of the above exemplify different **forms of engaging** with the
state and other entities while maintaining a focus on **language
revitalization**]{.underline}. In this same respect, just as language is
centered in the above discussion, resurgence prioritizes the
strengthening of Indigenous nationhood, which can be enhanced through
multiple pathways involving state engagement but are ultimately
community-driven processes. According to Estes, \"Indigenous nationhood
is often misunderstood as an exclusive project - the sole aspiration of
just Indigenous peoples - or as confined within narrow definitions of
the nation-state.\"24 In other words, Indigenous nationhood doesn\'t
flourish in isolation - its grounded in multiple relationships that help
generate community health and well-being. As Simpson aptly states,
\"Resurgence cannot occur in isolation. [A **collective conversation**
and mobilization is critical to **avoid reproducing** the individualism
and **colonial isolation**]{.underline} that [**settler colonialism**
fosters]{.underline}.\"25 Spaces of Indigenous resurgence can [open up
anywhere that community exists and can flourish within **multiple
contexts**]{.underline}.

As the complexities of the above discussion on language revitalization
demonstrate, while turning away from the state is a strategic
orientation and positioning, it is not an abandonment of relations with
state actors; instead it is a reaffirmation of Indigenous \"radiating
relationships with plant nations, animal nations, insects, bodies of
water, air, soil, and spiritual beings with whom we share parts of our
territory.\"26 Turning away is also a way to act in contention with
aspects of state coercion that may attempt to align Indigenous nation
priorities with longer-term state goals via the politics of recognition.
According to Coulthard, there is a great danger when gearing Indigenous
peoples\' goals toward a \"recognition-based approach to reconciling
Indigenous peoples\' assertions of nationhood with settler-state
sovereignty via the accommodation of Indigenous identity-related claims
through the negotiation of settlements over issues such as land,
economic development, and self-government\"27

The [politics of recognition]{.underline} is [undergirded by **settler
colonialism**]{.underline}, which is [premised on]{.underline} settler
[populations attempting to dominate **Indigenous
landscapes**]{.underline} and seascapes in order to maintain a permanent
presence on the land at the expense of Indigenous nations and peoples.
Settler colonialism as \"a structure, not an event\"28 is a collective
of shape-shifting entities that employ state coercion to govern through
overlapping structures of domination \"intrinsically shaped by and
shaping interactive relations of coloniality, racism, gender, class,
sexuality and desire, capitalism, and ableism.\"29
[Consequently]{.underline}, [acting in contention with **settler
colonialism** entails]{.underline} \"the [disruption of **intersecting
forces**]{.underline} of power [such as colonialism]{.underline},
[heteropatriarchy and capitalism]{.underline}.\"30 Despite
shape-shifting colonial efforts to erase Indigenous peoples from
settler-dominated landscapes, Kanaka Maoli scholar J. Kehaulani Kauanui
describes the inherent dynamics of \"enduring Indigeneity\" in which
Indigenous nations and peoples \"exist, resist, and persist.\"31
According to Kauanui, \"Understanding settler colonialism as a structure
exposes the fact that colonialism cannot be relegated to the past, even
though the past-present should be historicized.\"32 Shape-shifting
[colonial entities are more than just states]{.underline} - [they are
institutions]{.underline}, such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs)
and multinational corporations (MNCs) and other forms of power that are
exerted against Indigenous peoples and their complex relationships. From
this deep and ongoing history with settler colonialism, [Indigenous
peoples are]{.underline} \"**[enduring]{.underline}**\" [because they do
not center **colonial institutions**]{.underline} in their everyday
lives [while also identifying new ways to **expose and
challenge**]{.underline} these [**ever-changing** coercive power
dynamics]{.underline}.

So what does it actually mean to turn away from the state amidst a
backdrop of ongoing colonization? First, it means truly coming to terms
with the fact that Indigenous bodies \-- men, women, girls, trans,
two-spirit, and queer people \-- are viewed by colonial powers as,
according to Mohawk scholar Audra Simpson, \"a direct threat to their
sovereignty and governmentality.\"33 The violence that occurs on
Indigenous lands also takes place on Indigenous bodies in distinct ways.
Second, turning away from the state by centering Indigenous nationhood
does not entail an unwillingness to engage with the settler state; quite
the opposite. As political theorist Michael Elliott points out:

> \...spaces of resurgence are structured not on but for the principle
> of reciprocity. They presuppose Indigenous centricity and authority,
> and in doing so figure settlers as guests: if they are to remain
> welcome, settlers are under requirement to adapt their behaviour to
> meet with conditions of hospitality that they have no say in
> determining.34

[The process of turning away from the state actually invites **settler
engagement**]{.underline} regarding solidarity movements and addressing
injustices. [Amidst discomfort and unease with the **current colonial
system**]{.underline}, [settlers\' responses]{.underline} can [set the
tone for protecting and **expanding sites** of Indigenous
resurgence]{.underline}. This is [certainly the case with]{.underline}
the [**Wet\'suwet\'en** in 2020 as settlers were asked to help
**blockade railways**]{.underline} and convey demands to politicians and
policymakers regarding the eviction of the RCMP and CGL from
Wet\'suwet\'en homelands. Third, amidst resurgence movements, there is
often an attempt to engage with the state on multiple levels to generate
accountability, solidarity, and, where appropriate, to seek recourse
from global forums. [This can take the form of]{.underline} invoking
**[UNDRIP]{.underline}**, the
**[I]{.underline}**nter-**[A]{.underline}**merican
**[C]{.underline}**ommission on **[H]{.underline}**uman
**[R]{.underline}**ights, the **[C]{.underline}**onvention on
**[B]{.underline}**iodiversity, the **[C]{.underline}**onvention on the
**[E]{.underline}**limination of **[R]{.underline}**acial
**[D]{.underline}**iscrimination, as well as the [UN Permanent Forum on
**Indigenous Issues**]{.underline}. With the realization that these
forums have limits in terms of achieving resurgence aims, Indigenous
nations make careful decisions about where to direct their time and
energy. Fourth, [in **turning away** from the state]{.underline},
**[Indigenous nations]{.underline}** may [initiate **collaboration** and
occasionally **treaty-making** between themselves to conduct their **own
forms** of diplomacy with other **Indigenous nations**]{.underline}.35
These international actions can sometimes render the state redundant in
terms of the mutual recognition of Indigenous nations and the exercise
of self-determining authority, both of which pose a credible threat to
the legitimacy of state governments.

#### Despite small population sizes, the Inuit have achieved [effective]{.underline} political engagement .

**Duguid 20** (Danielle Duguid ,MA in Political Science and Anthropology
at the University of Albany 5-20, \"\"How Political Engagement Helps
Indigenous Communities in their Fight for Rights\" University at Albany,

DOA: 7-14-2025//St. Marks Adam)

While there are difficulties for most minority groups in the political
realm, those that make up a small portion of the population have a much
more limited range of options for actions to take. For example, the
Mayans who make up a majority have engaged in international appeals in
the past with their advocate Rigoberta Menchú, along with ethnic voting
and local representation. This contrasts with the Inuit who have most of
their accomplishments through direct national or international appeals.
Following this trend, [it appears that smaller communities would be more
prone to choosing international appeals. While work at the domestic
level may be difficult for any indigenous group regardless of population
percentage because of discrimination, it is virtually impossible for
smaller ethnic groups. This is not because of formal barriers like
restrictions of voting rights, but just based on logistics.]{.underline}
[However, **this does not mean that the ways of political engagement**
**used by small indigenous groups are any less effective** than methods
of larger groups]{.underline}. While there is not a measure to quantify
effectiveness or success for these different methods in this paper, [the
international appeals that the Inuit favor seem to work
well]{.underline}. Partially [because of work by the Inuit, Canada has
switched its position from a non-signer of the United Nations
Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People to supporting the
declaration.]{.underline} The [Inuit have also successfully managed to
get seats on international organizations and have been a clear and
ever-present voice at organizations like the United
Nations]{.underline}. In fact, it [could be argued that these
international measures are **more effective** than the domestic means.
Through creating a lot of noise, the Inuit have managed to represent
themselves on an international panel, the Arctic Council]{.underline}.
While there are still downfalls, such as they have not secured voting
rights in that organization, [the Inuit still have succeeded in bringing
their problems to an international audience and manage to represent
themselves while doing so]{.underline}. The unfortunate situation is
that often, forms of political engagement only work when it is in the
reigning government's interest to grant rights to the indigenous
population. This has often been a second priority compared to economic
or political development and is often used as a PR stunt. While this
reality creates doubt about the benefits of attempting to fight back and
become an advocate, it [still stands that any progress the group can
make would be beneficial. With the use of domestic or international
means of political engagement, governments have a difficult time pushing
groups to the side when their voice is strong]{.underline}. The
[benefits of working through domestic efforts, like the Mayans and
Quechua do, is that it is more difficult for their governments to shut
down these efforts without suppressing democracy. While this has
happened before, it calls into question human rights abuses and creates
another range of international problems for the
administrations.]{.underline} [When groups make international appeals,
it brings attention into a state, which has resulted in them wavering
and granting requests (Coates & Holroyd, 2014). This has been the case
with both Mayan and Inuit]{.underline}. [Through any of these methods of
political engagement, indigenous communities are staring their
governments down and demanding change]{.underline}. With methods like
local parties, voting, or international appeals, these groups have
succeeded in creating change to better their political situation. [The
**best way to succeed is through legitimate, political
means**]{.underline}. Even in situations where oppression is widespread,
or the percentage of population is very low, these [cases prove that it
is possible to use political engagement to **create**
**change**.]{.underline}

#### Inclusion of Indigenous people in policymaking leads to more [just]{.underline} policies that ensure [sustainability]{.underline}.

The culmination of this paper will be an argument from belonging. This
argument has an intermediate conclusion, and a final conclusion. The
intermediate conclusion is that [a sense of belonging not just to the
Earth\'s surface, but to a larger region of space is going to become
**indispensable** if we want to understand the deeper human significance
of our expansion into space]{.underline}. The final conclusion is that
**[Indigenous inclusion can and should help to inform the
development]{.underline}** of such a sense of belonging. For simplicity,
"inclusion" will be used as a placeholder for Indigenous participation
and engagement with a variety of governmental and non-governmental
bodies involved in space activities. As the theme concerns belonging,
the argument will also be rather philosophical, and so it concerns the
background to policy discussions more than a specified program of
action. What is said will be consistent with several policy approaches
just so long as they are shaped by a concern for the relevant kind of
inclusion. While [the argument is]{.underline} philosophical, it is
nonetheless [geared to set out a pragmatic reason for strengthening
Indigenous inclusion over the long term]{.underline}. And [this
pragmatism may help to reinforce a sense that the view set out could
make its way into the shaping of policy, or otherwise contribute to
answering questions such as "What advantages are there to building
Indigenous inclusion into policy?" One answer will be, "We end up with
**policy that is more just**."]{.underline} [Another will be, "We end up
with policy better **geared to the long term**]{.underline}." By which,
I mean the period of time during which key features of our identity will
be reshaped as beings who may belong, and feel at home, not only on the
surface of the Earth, but elsewhere also. This elsewhere need not be
everywhere, or even make us multi-planetary, just so long as it is
expansive enough to require a shift in ideas about who we are.

#### [Empirics prove]{.underline} --- Indigenous communities are [uniquely successful]{.underline} in legal activism and [reappropriate]{.underline} western politics with traditional knowledge to [avoid assimilation]{.underline} and [ensure sovereignty]{.underline}.

[Native participation in the **defense of Alaska** would provide a
powerful unifying force]{.underline}, stimulating the movement for
Native rights as the dynamic social transformation of the U.S. Civil
Rights movement flowed north into Alaska, [culminating in the historic
1971 passage of the **Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act** (ANCSA), the
pioneering land treaty transferring **44 million acres** of land title
and \$1 billion in compensation to Alaska native]{.underline}s, a model
embraced and later enhanced as Inuit land claims were negotiated across
the entire North American Arctic, [with Inuit gaining title to nearly
**one-tenth** of their traditional land base]{.underline}, and new
co-management structures enabling a joint approach to managing natural
resources, land access, and economic development. (Zellen, 2008) By the
time the Inuvialuit of Canada's Western Arctic settled their land claim
in 1984, based on their Agreement-in-Principle (AiP) negotiated in 1978,
they had greatly advanced the land claims model, favoring Native
traditions that ANCSA had, in its original form, overlooked.

Indeed, the early years of ANCSA implementation were famously described
by former B.C. Supreme Court justice and prominent land rights advocate
Thomas R. Berger as dragging Alaska Natives "kicking and screaming" into
the twentieth century, and many Native corporations approached the brink
of bankruptcy, forced to monetize their net operating losses in a last
desperate bid to stay in business. (Berger, 1985; Zellen, 2008;
Sillanpaa, 1988) A new cottage industry of northern investment, legal,
and policy advisors emerged -- sometimes to the benefit of their
clients, but often not -- a problem that would persist across the entire
Arctic region as land claims transferred large cash settlements to
northern beneficiaries of settled claims. In addition to the
corporatization of village Alaska, ANCSA's original design also had
major structural flaws that nearly proved fatal to the land claims
experience, including a 20-year moratorium in transferring shares in
Native corporations to non-Natives, which many feared would inevitably
result in the dilution of Native ownership, known as the "1991 time
bomb," which necessitated amending the original land claims legislation
in the years that followed. (Sykes et al., 1985; Worl, 1988)

While critics of the land claims process are correct to point out these
original structural flaws and the assimilating pressures introduced by
new corporate structures, [the land claims model has nonetheless proved
**resilient and adaptive**, as Native corporations **matured and their
boards**, managers and shareholders found ways to better **balance
traditional and modern values**, learning from their crash course in
capitalism as they went]{.underline} -- [so today the Native
corporations represent a **huge economic force** not only in the state
of Alaska but across all of Arctic North America.]{.underline}

[Rather than **forcibly assimilating** a reluctant Native community into
a new market culture, Natives instead **reimagined** the land claims
model as their own, infusing it with a deep commitment to the
preservation and revitalization of **traditional values** in balance
with **economic modernization**, pushing back against ANCSA at the
local, regional, state, and circumpolar level.]{.underline} Thus the
Inuvialuit land claim which followed ANCSA across the international
boundary in Canada's Western Arctic would entitle the 3,000 Inuvialuit
(many recent descendants of Inupiat settlers) living in six communities
to 35,000 square miles of land; co-management of land and water use,
wildlife, and environmental assessment; wildlife harvesting rights;
financial compensation of \$45 million in 1978 dollars (and departing
from ANCSA, inflation-adjusted to a more bountiful \$162 million) for
lands ceded to Canada; a share of government royalties for oil, gas, and
mineral development on federal land; government commitment to meaningful
economic participation in any development in the settlement area; and
the formation of new national parks in the settlement area that further
protected their land base from development, while (also departing from
ANCSA) allowing subsistence activities unhindered (which in turn
inspired the U.S. federal government to finally address, and in essence
federalize, subsistence in its 1980 Alaska National Interest Lands
Conservation Act (ANILCA). (Zellen, 2008)

[This revised model has remained largely intact in subsequent
comprehensive **land claims**, from **Nunavut** to **Nunatsiavut** to
the east, and in the many **Dene** and **Yukon First Nation** settlement
areas to the south of the Inuit homeland, showing great endurance as a
model for **northern development** from which there has been no
retreat.]{.underline} While augmented with new tools for achieving
increasing levels of self-governance, the land claims treaty structure
continues to embrace collaborative (and adaptive) co-management of lands
and resources, and to balance the inherent tensions between market
economies and traditional subsistence.

While constitutionally distinct, the steady evolution from Home Rule to
Self-Rule in Greenland mirrors the achievements of Natives in Alaska and
the Canadian Arctic, leveraging the long and enduring foundation of
economic integration to assert and achieve political gains, and to
strengthen the role of Natives in governing their homeland. The range of
governing institutions has, as a result of this complex jurisdictional
landscape of Arctic North America, proliferated in form and in number:

¬ At the municipal level of government, there is the North Slope Borough
in Alaska, a vast municipality that sustains itself through property
taxation of the Prudhoe Bay oil facilities, a borough larger in size
than many of America's original 13 states that governs a population of
just 6,000---with hundreds of millions of dollars in property taxes to
build world-class infrastructure and provide modern government services
in a region that had historically lacked such essentials as schools and
hospitals; as well as the neighboring Northwest Arctic Borough, with
fewer resources and thus less regional economic development. (NARF,
1975; NARF, 1988)

¬ At the territorial level, there is [the vast Nunavut Territory,
governing one-fifth of Canada\'s landmass, created through the
**peaceful secession** of the Eastern Arctic from the old Northwest
Territories]{.underline}, and home to some 30,000 people, almost
entirely Inuit, scattered across 28 villages in an area larger than
Western Europe---and a source of much of Canada\'s future natural
resource wealth and strategic waterways. (Gerhardt, 2011)

¬ And at the tribal/indigenous level, there is [the Inuit government of
Nunatsiavut in northern Labrador]{.underline}, which has a unique Inuit
constitution that governs its 2,000 Inuit residents living in six
villages in a traditional manner, [**rejecting a public governance
model** in favor of one more distinctively tribal in nature]{.underline}
(owing to the demographic predominance of non-Natives in Newfoundland
and Labrador, making a public model inherently risky there in contrast
to Nunavut, which enjoys Inuit demographic predominance)

As shown by these innovations in collaborative northern governance,
[indigenous culture has become **increasingly recognized** not as a
fault line of conflict, but as a new and **viable boundary line** for
political institutions]{.underline}, providing a foundation for
political stability across regions, transcending national boundaries.
The experience across the Arctic suggests that with foresight and
innovation, and a willingness to redraw political boundaries through a
commitment to the principles of co-management and further jurisdictional
developments (from the establishment of regionally self-governing Native
municipalities like the North Slope Borough to the secession of Nunavut
from the Northwest Territories to create a self-governing Native
territory) to better reflect indigenous identity and fulfill Native
aspirations for autonomy, [it is possible to create stable frontier
region **free of war**, with durable and effective mechanisms for
**mediating tribe-state disputes** before they explode into violent
domestic or regional conflagrations]{.underline} as we see in other,
less collaborative corners of the world.

[By the last decades of the twentieth century, if not before, it became
clear that Indigenous peoples and communities were not comfortable with
a governmentcentric approach to Indigenous affairs]{.underline}.
Canadian authorities opened negotiations on modern treaties in the early
1970s and, over the following 30 years, signed agreements with
Indigenous peoples across much of the territorial North, northern Quebec
and Labrador. [These sweeping agreements provided substantial cash
settlements, resource revenue arrangements, Indigenous roles in
environmental management and the approval of natural resource projects
and, most importantly, substantial scope for Indigenous self-government.
Negotiating the treaties took years and drained Indigenous financial and
political resources; implementing the agreements provided to be a
formidable challenge on its own, requiring extensive and ongoing
engagement with both the government and the court. In Canada, Indigenous
people also won a series of major court victories, particularly the 2004
Supreme Court decisions in Haida and Taku, that gave them sharply
increased authority, under "duty to consult and accommodate" provisions,
over natural resource development on their traditional territories
(Alcantara 2007).]{.underline}

#### Their advocacy is wrong -- indigenous groups have made significant progress within governmental institutions within arctic decision-making that creates a unique avenue for change -- they totalize!

[Perhaps the most significant long-term change in Indigenous affairs in
the Far North rests with regional engagement in
policy-making]{.underline}. For generations, in a classic Arctic
manifestation of colonial governance, policy was developed in southern
capitals and imposed, typically with little or no consultation, on the
Indigenous peoples in the North. For generations, the governance of
Arctic, especially in the American Arctic, regions was marked by neglect
or disinterest. After World War II, welfare-statism took hold, perceived
by governments and southern peoples as acts of generosity and as a
commitment to bringing the Indigenous peoples of the North into the
national mainstream. Indigenous peoples pushed back against the
intrusions of the state, but with a decline in traditional economies and
the dislocations associated with major resource development, population
growth and major infrastructure projects, along with the expansion of
southern and international cultures, brought substantial and
external-imposed changes into the North. [The battle lines were many
including stopping or changing large-scale development, fighting for the
recognition of Indigenous rights, coping with linguistic and cultural
change and managing the aggressiveness and cultural weight of
non-Indigenous peoples in the North.]{.underline} At the same time, in
many areas resources were limited, including an overstretched leadership
cadre, few local-controlled funds and limited government support.
[Paternalism proved resilient and national governments resisted efforts
to accommodate Indigenous aspirations]{.underline}. Over time, the
combination of Indigenous self-determination, national and international
political developments, growing non-Indigenous support for Indigenous
aspirations and new legal, political and treaty arrangements, as well as
international law, resulted in dramatically different approaches to
Arctic governance and management. Through processes that varied by
country and region, [Indigenous peoples became more actively involved in
issues of national and Indigenous governance,]{.underline} implying
policy influence and interchange, as well incorporation of indigenous
perspectives into mainstream political arrangements (Broderstad 2014).
There were many aspects to this change, ranging from treaty
negotiations, self-government agreements and self-governance
arrangements to Indigenous educational and training programs, natural
resource management and socio-cultural programming. The central
development in Indigenous governance has been the emergence of the
co-production of policy and political partnerships across the Arctic.
From the Arctic Council, where Indigenous representations work closely
with national government representations, through national and regional
government collaborations with Indigenous authorities, co-production of
policy has emerged as a major force for governance transformation. The
concept is relatively straight-forward. [With the processes varying
between countries, Indigenous organizations and institutions work with
national and regional governments to identify areas for policy
development, agree on general program and policy parameters, develop
collaborative policy-making and implementation processes, and monitor
the policy activity.]{.underline} The most successful early examples
came largely in wildlife and land management, but governments
increasingly realized the folly of proceeding without full and sustained
indigenous engagement. In almost all areas of Arctic public policy, from
health care and education to economic development and climate change
initiatives, Indigenous peoples are engaged, to a greater or lesser
extent, on policy design and development. The arrangements are less
pronounced in Russia, where national authority remains extremely strong,
but are central to policy efforts in Greenland and the Canadian North.
Across Scandinavia, the Saami Parliaments in Finland, Norway and Sweden
stand out as prominent political institutions of Saami-state interaction
and enhanced institutionalization. None of the Saami parliaments have
any legislative power. But it is fair to say that the actual influence
of the Norwegian Saami Parliament in relation to national political
institutions is more comprehensive compared to the two Nordic siblings.
In Norway, consultations have become the main mechanism in the
governance of Saami affairs. As emphasized by the Norwegian Saami
Parliament, the right to self-determination is more than the right to be
consulted. Simultaneously, the right to be consulted is a central
element of implementing self-determination on areas affecting both Saami
and others. [In Alaska, community engagement is notable in areas related
to economic development, energy infrastructure and education. Across the
Arctic, in one of the most important transitions in recent history,
Indigenous peoples and communities have become increasingly involved in
the co-development of public policy and the general management of
government programming. Colonialism dies hard, as history has shown, and
there are profound policy-making challenges that remain. But the Far
North has produced, largely at the insistence of Indigenous peoples, a
"laboratory" for the understanding of Indigenous re-empowerment. That
the process remains far from complete and quite uneven across the
Circumpolar World, there are promising signs that Indigenous engagement
in policy production and, indeed, the coproduction of Arctic policy at
the regional, national and international levels can produce substantial
improvements in Indigenous conditions.]{.underline}

Legal milestones: Significant, but fragile

[For decades, Inuit communities have warned global governments of the
existential threats that they face---threats that also have global
repercussions. For example, **Inuit organizations play a key role in
international efforts** seeking to regulate chemical substances,
including the **Stockholm** **and Minamata Conventions**, as well as the
**Arctic Council** and the **International** **Maritime
Organization**.]{.underline} Thanks to their historic and contemporary
efforts, as well as the [broader mobilization of Indigenous and allied
voices across the country, we are beginning to see meaningful shifts in
how laws are developed,]{.underline} especially in terms of whose voices
are included in decision-making processes. [In a notable step forward,
Canada passed its first environmental justice law last year. This law
provides a crucial tool for advancing the wellbeing of Arctic
communities by requiring that environmental decisions made by the
Canadian government take into account local realities, Indigenous
knowledge and the systemic inequalities]{.underline} that affect health,
food security and the broader human environment. Another [significant
victory for the right to a healthy environment was recently secured
through the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. For Arctic
communities, the recognition of this right under federal law provides a
critical legal foundation to demand environmental policies and programs
that reflect their unique living conditions]{.underline}, address the
persistent pollution threatening their health and the need to protect
the ecosystems their ways of life depend on. [Through this legislative
reform, the federal government has also acknowledged that certain
communities---especially Indigenous, racialized and remote ones---are
disproportionately affected by environmental damage.]{.underline} While
imperfect and still insufficient, these changes to the law pave the way
for a more equitable transformation of our public policy. [**The Arctic
must be fully included in -- and benefit from -- this evolving legal
landscape**.]{.underline} Whether in terms of plastic pollution,
chemical pollution, climate change or biodiversity loss, Arctic
communities experience a disproportionate share of the environmental
harms. **[These legislative reforms can and must be leveraged to protect
the North's fragile ecosystems, uphold the rights of Indigenous Peoples
and support communities in their fight against environmental and climate
injustice.]{.underline}**

The role of research in building justice

[Researchers have a vital role to play in this context.]{.underline} By
documenting environmental inequalities, generating localized data and
centering Indigenous knowledge, [research conducted in true partnership
with Indigenous communities can serve as a powerful catalyst for
advocacy, policy change and transformative action. By drawing on new
**legal frameworks** such as the environmental justice law or the right
to a healthy environment, scientists **can help shape public policy**,
**support community-led advocacy and co-develop** **solutions grounded
in the lived realities of the North**.]{.underline}

[Inuit are in the best position to inform the world of the ways in which
climate change is impacting their homeland]{.underline}. The
relationship to and understanding of the land that accompanies thousands
of years of living sustainably in the Arctic is a perspective that Inuit
hold, and one that is vital to our international understanding of how to
approach Arctic governance. In Canada, [Inuit have achieved considerable
ability to participate in governance on the matters that affect them
most. This has culminated over decades of Inuit determination to be
included in these policy and governance matters.]{.underline} This
[level of **engagement between Inuit and the Government of Canada,
facilitated by these Inuit organizations, shows how powerful and
effective Indigenous organizations can be in achieving Indigenous
self-determination**]{.underline}. Of course, the nation-state also has
to be willing to engage with these organizations, in this case being the
Government of Canada. [Canada has recently shown their commitment to
work with Indigenous groups in Canada's Arctic and Northern Policy
Framework]{.underline} (2019). This level of commitment towards
collaboration does not exist in every nation-state around the world,
often making it difficult for Indigenous organizations to achieve the
level of collaboration they desire. Nonetheless, [this example of
collaboration between Inuit and the Government of Canada demonstrates
the decision-making capabilities that can arise out of Indigenous
organizations' fight towards self-determination.]{.underline} At the
international level, [Inuit have been involved in policymaking through
the Inuit Circumpolar Council, a Permanent Participant on the most
influential governing body for the circumpolar region, the Arctic
Council.]{.underline} At the state level in Canada, [Inuit have been
involved in policymaking through the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, the
national association for Inuit in Canada.]{.underline} Finally, the four
Inuit land claim agreements that exist in Canada have also contributed
greatly to Inuit ability to participate in policymaking and governance
decisions affecting the Canadian Arctic.

These [**Inuit organizations are excellent examples of the potential and
ability that organizations have to facilitate Indigenous sovereignty
within a settler colonial state**.]{.underline} The [success of these
organizations may very well be a model that other Indigenous groups
around the world can follow.]{.underline} The organizations discussed
throughout this paper and undoubtedly many more Indigenous organizations
all around the world create and develop policy solutions for the issues
that they understand best. [These representative organizations and the
reports they create should always be consulted and discussed in the
making of any relevant policy.]{.underline} Organizations like those
discussed in this paper are crucial pieces in facilitating the
conversation between Indigenous groups and the states in which they
reside.

### 2AC\-\--AT: IR Links

#### IR isn't intrinsically Western. Rejecting it wholesale falls for the [essentialism trap]{.underline} and [reinforces]{.underline} the status quo.

**Barnett and Zarakol, 23**---Professor of International Affairs and
Political Science, Elliott School of International Affairs, George
Washington University; Professor of International Relations at the
University of Cambridge (Michael and Ayşe; "Global international
relations and the essentialism trap," International Theory, Volume 15,
Issue 3, 428-444, dml)

First, as noted above, essentialism provides a 'common sense' for the
practice and theorization of world politics. Essentialized categories
are almost required for those who want to understand strategic and
instrumental action.Footnote 48 [Any time categories of analysis are
invoked]{.underline}, [there is also]{.underline} necessarily a moment
of **[reification]{.underline}**, of fixing meanings. Indeed, [by
naming]{.underline} 'Global **[IR]{.underline}**' [as a]{.underline}
'**[thing]{.underline}**' [that displays certain]{.underline}
'**[tendencies]{.underline}**', [we could be]{.underline} read as
**[essentializing]{.underline}** our object of enquiry, [even as we
**critique** advocates of]{.underline} Global IR for [doing]{.underline}
just [this]{.underline}. [The same can be said of many other terms we
invoke]{.underline}: '**[mainstream]{.underline}**' [IR]{.underline},
'**[the West]{.underline}**', [and more]{.underline}. However, there is
a major difference between recognizing that naming objects involves 'as
if' assumptions about their intersubjective meaning and relative
stability, and resting claims, whether descriptive, interpretative or
explanatory, on the essential properties of these objects. [The
assumption that countries and regions have]{.underline} '[**radically
different** histories and political theories than that of the
**West**]{.underline}' [relies on claims about **homogenous
units**]{.underline} that are inscribed within unique historical points
of origin that, in turn, generate singular, or at least distinctive,
cultural packages -- and, hence, different theoretical
traditions.Footnote 49 Of course, lived experiences are hugely important
to the creation of lifeworlds -- [place matters]{.underline}.
[And]{.underline} equally importantly, [many]{.underline} of the [units
of analysis]{.underline} that are examined in world politics [are stable
and]{.underline}, oftentimes, highly [resilient]{.underline}: religions,
states, racism, and more. [But this does not make them
**static**]{.underline}: [religions are **reconfigured**]{.underline},
[the character of states **ebbs** and **flows**]{.underline}, [racism
takes **diverse forms** across time and place]{.underline}. And these
shifts are not just the product of interactions between units. Rather,
they are generated by the interplay between peoples, belief-systems,
forms of governance, modes of exchange, and more. A relational
understanding of 'things' does not deny the importance of enduring
patterns or relatively stability within objects of analysis. [It would
be **impossible**]{.underline}, [and **nonsensical**]{.underline}, [to
claim that states]{.underline}, [regions]{.underline}, [and similar
entities were **not meaningful categories** of analysis]{.underline}. A
mix of relational social theory and global history can help both to
disrupt 'common sense' essentialism,Footnote 50 however, and serve as an
alternative way of examining the space opened up by Global IR.

Second, [essentialism is **hard to dislodge** because of disciplinary
logics]{.underline}. Disciplines have material, institutional, and
epistemic resources [that **reinforce the status
quo**]{.underline}.Footnote 51 IR is no exception. As noted above, IR
also often adopts features of radical challenges that help to maintain
its legitimacy. At present, Global IR is [mixing a more radical
normative agenda with a conventional ontology]{.underline}. This [leaves
it **vulnerable to cooptation** as a kind of disciplinary]{.underline}
'**[diversity plan]{.underline}**'. For example, [a
**core**]{.underline} aspiration of Global IR is to recover the agency
of actors in the Global South. The [**point** is]{.underline} well-made:
[Western IR scholarship has written history as if the **only actors that
mattered** were **Western**]{.underline}. By placing non-Western
traditions on an equal footing with Western concepts and
theories,Footnote 52 it is argued, IR can be 'reimagined' as a site of
'plural universalism': many civilizations within one world.Footnote 53
However, [this is a **thin form of globalizing** in which representation
emerges from the **sum of its parts** rather than]{.underline} the
[deep-rooted]{.underline}, [entangled histories]{.underline} that forge
global order. The papers in this symposium outline an agenda premised on
a more consistent link between ethical intent and ontology, with the
potential to develop Global IR in novel directions. We hope to replace
an 'add and stir' strategy with a 'global all the way down' approach
that deepens the remit of the Global IR project.

The third dynamic driving Global IR towards the
[essentialism]{.underline} trap is the way in which its advocates
contain a particular form of standpoint epistemology. Standpoint
epistemology is rooted in the notion that worldviews emerge from
positionalities: what we think derives from where we stand.Footnote 54
This view [lies at the **heart** of attempts to think IR from
**different starting points**]{.underline} -- from a distinct
positionality, it is argued, comes a distinctive set of
interests.Footnote 55 This assumption also lies at the heart of
decolonial scholarship, which rests on a geo-epistemological standpoint
underlining cultural dissonance. In both cases, identities shape both
how actors act in the world and how we, as observers, see it. [If
actors]{.underline} '**[know]{.underline}**' [the world through their
**positionalities**]{.underline} (geography, race, class, gender,
political alignment, and so on), scholars also 'know' the world through
[these contexts]{.underline}. Positionalities [are
**inescapable**]{.underline}. The question then becomes: what forms of
knowledge production are adequate once the centrality of positionality
to worldviews is recognized? Standpoint theory valorizes 'insider'
perspectives for very good reasons -- it helps to empower peoples and
communities who have been silenced by hegemonic practices and reveals
that these practices are themselves perspectival. Yet [when]{.underline}
'**[insider]{.underline}**' [positions become the **only way** in which
valid scholarly knowledge production operates]{.underline},
[then]{.underline} it follows that only Chinese scholars can teach and
research about China, only Muslims about Islam, only white men about
white men, and so on.

In this way, [we return to the **essentialism trap**]{.underline}, one
[in which the authorization to take part in conversations]{.underline}
about 'insider' concerns [is **restricted** to]{.underline}
'**[insiders]{.underline}**' who can be identified, [through
**preordained positionalities**]{.underline}. In such cases, it is often
geography that denotes 'authentic' subjectivity. And this subjectivity,
in turn, represents the limits of our communities. To reiterate: there
are sound reasons why standpoint epistemologies are mobilized to certify
lived experiences that have been violently suppressed through
exploitation. But in scholarship, [there is a need for
**caution**]{.underline}, not least [because this positionality can
serve as a form of]{.underline} 'primitivism' that rests on the
**[idealization]{.underline}** of a supposed 'prelapsarian
innocence'.Footnote 56 [It can also be **vulnerable to cooptation** by
powerful elites]{.underline}, [becoming deployed in tandem with claims
to authority that rest on notions of **cultural
authenticity**]{.underline}, [something made more likely by trends
towards **authoritarianism**]{.underline} of various kinds.Footnote 57
[The **unintended consequence**]{.underline} of a movement seeking to
open up the discipline to more diverse voices then [could be to sustain
political forces that promote **narrow**]{.underline}, even
**[chauvinistic]{.underline}**, [agendas]{.underline}. In IR\'s current
operating environment, claims around 'pluralism' can lead towards
closure rather than openness.

Whatever important work standpoint theory does politically, therefore,
we do not think it should serve as the only basis for the scholarly
project of Global IR. [To see positionality]{.underline}, whether around
geography or culture, [as the **start**]{.underline} -- [and
**end**]{.underline} -- [of conversations about]{.underline} Global [IR
is]{.underline}, we think, [a **limited vision**]{.underline} of the
project\'s potential. The challenge is to represent diversity without
essentializing difference. The articles in this symposium take up this
challenge by identifying both distinct experiences and the deep
connections between social sites 'at home' and 'over there', the
'foreign' and the 'domestic', the 'East' and the 'West', 'metropole' and
'colony'. Standpoint epistemologies can occlude these connections and
the wider dynamics they are embedded within. This symposium inverts this
approach, seeing connections as the basis of units. The foundations of
this approach lie in a relational ontology.

Escape velocity: relationalism and global history

Relationalism takes many forms, from the familiar (some varieties of
constructivism) to the avant-garde (quantum-inspired
hyperhumanism).Footnote 58 Although the differences between forms of
relationalism are considerable, all relational approaches recognize that
relations are prior to and produce entities. Tilly\'s processual
sociology, for instance, is pitched against the presumption of 'coherent
durable monads' to the neglect of 'contingent, transitory connections
among socially constructed identities.'Footnote 59 According to Tilly,
bad habits have been passed down by his generation:

We learned and in turn taught a practice of this sort: (1) assume a
coherent durable, self-propelling social unit; (2) attribute a general
condition or process to that unit; (3) invoke or invent an invariant
model of that condition or process; (4) explain the behavior of the unit
on the basis of its conformity to that invariant model.Footnote 60

For Tilly and other relational thinkers, this procedure will not do.
Emirbayer makes clear what is at stake: 'whether to conceive of the
social world as consisting primarily in substances or in processes, in
static 'things' or in dynamic unfolding relations.'Footnote 61
Relational thinkers do not argue that interests, goals, and identities
cannot be stable. Rather, their position is that, however stable, these
entities are forged relationally and subject to ongoing logics of
reproduction and contestation. [The West]{.underline}, for example, [is
**not a fixed entity** that existed prior to its engagement with the
non-Western world]{.underline} -- [transboundary relations between
Western and non-Western societies led to a **change** in their
organizing logics]{.underline}, [positions]{.underline}, [and sense of
the world]{.underline}. Similarly, [the idea of the West and the
institutions that support it are **regularly reassessed**]{.underline},
**[contested]{.underline}**, [and **reproduced**]{.underline}. It is an
entity-in-motion. Against claims of constancy, relational accounts
stress the ways in which traditions are always living.

Relations may be fleeting or enduring, deep or superficial, direct or
indirect, mono- or multi-directional, interpersonal or impersonal. To
assess their significance, [we need to know **which** relations matter
and **when**]{.underline}, **[where]{.underline}**, [and **how** they do
so]{.underline}. This directs attention to sites where relations cohere
(e.g. borders), actors that direct relations (e.g. powerful polities),
gaps where relations are sparse or reversible (e.g. extractive regimes),
and historical moments when relations break or global integration is
either stopped or reversed (e.g. aspects of contemporary world
politics). This symposium, therefore, seeks to identify patterns of
connections: the structural entanglements, premised on asymmetrical
power relations, which generate processes of historical development.
Relations, hypothetically speaking, can be egalitarian, but most social
relations that concern IR are defined by inequality and hierarchy. Our
concern is with the ways in which relations generate systems of
stratification: racial, epistemic, geographic, and more.

Despite this shared concern with hierarchical patterns of global order,
the symposium offers a major challenge to the use of essentialism and
its auxiliary claims in Global IR. Against essentialism, it replaces the
starting point of units as entities-with-fixed-attributes with the
notion of units as entities-in-motion. Against substantialism,
relational approaches argue that it is connections between social sites
that produce the entities that are often treated as having an essence:
cultures, geographies, nations, regions, civilizations, and more. In
contrast to internalism, relationalism stresses the entanglements
between 'inside' and 'outside' that are generative of historical
development. Against methodological nationalism, this approach points to
the ways in which actors and units are nested within broader scales.
Taken together, these moves have two main components: first, the papers
in this symposium identify the ways in which historical processes are
boundary-crossing; second, they theorize these boundary-crossing
connections as patterns of entanglements. The result is an interest in
systems of stratification. A relational starting point leads, in turn,
to a focus on transboundary connections, structural entanglements, and
systems of stratification.

The aim of Global IR is to use the openness of the contemporary
conjuncture to reform or recast core components of the discipline: its
forms of epistemic certification, its geographical range, its conceptual
grids, and more. We want this project to succeed. However, for this to
happen, we think that Global IR must avoid the gravitational pull
presented by the essentialism trap. This symposium sets out some ways in
which this trap might be avoided and articulates another way of
advancing Global IR.

The first article, by Barkawi, Murray, and Zarakol, analyses the
underlying power dynamics that have pulled the Global IR project in
potentially problematic directions. It argues that both American and
Global IR share a Eurocentric spatial imaginary, one that was a product
of Western expansion and empire. [Insisting that geographical
representation]{.underline} -- geo-epistemology -- [is the **solution**
to the problem of Eurocentrism]{.underline} (or American bias)
reproduces the very problems Global IR seeks to address, and
**[traps]{.underline}** Global [IR in **essentialist
representation**]{.underline}. The second article extends this analysis
by examining the ways in which proponents of Global IR read IR\'s
disciplinary history. Focusing on India, Bayly shows how a relational
sociology of disciplinary knowledge, rooted in imperial knowledge
complexes, provides an account of disciplinary IR as 'global at birth',
a globality that has subsequently been occluded in favour of a more
essentialist reading of a singular birth story. Also deploying insights
from global history, the third article, by Hui, questions if students of
historical Asia who challenge Western IR for 'getting Asia wrong' do
'get Asia right'. The paper de-essentializes 'China\'s hegemony' by
disaggregating the concept of 'China' and examining the multivocal and
contradictory reactions of China\'s neighbours in the full universe of
China\'s relevant relations across Asia. The final article, by Barnett
and Lawson, demonstrates one way of achieving the relational escape
velocity discussed above by providing a reappraisal of one of the
central theoretical concerns in contemporary IR: the notion of global
order. The symposium closes with a series of critical reflections on its
main themes by Pardesi, Çapan, and Yunis.

Recognizing that we have been here before is important in terms of
analysing what is at stake in contemporary debates about Global IR. It
is equally important for attempts, such as ours, to generate alternative
ways of theorizing the global. Each of the papers in this symposium
therefore rests on a shared sense of critique (essentialism and its
auxiliary assumptions) but develops its own particular remedy
(relational accounts premised on transboundary connections, structural
entanglements, and systems of stratification). [The
takeaway]{.underline} from the symposium [is not]{.underline},
therefore, [a **single**]{.underline} '**[solution]{.underline}**' [for
where IR theory]{.underline} in general, or Global IR in particular,
[should go]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} rather [a series of
openings]{.underline} through [which IR theory can use]{.underline} the
current crisis [**productively** rather than as another means of
**closure**]{.underline}. But the symposium promises more than this. It
argues that [**engagement** with]{.underline} global history, alongside
a relational ontology, helps to provide theoretical resources --
connections, entanglements, stratification -- that can underpin Global
[IR\'s research agenda]{.underline}. It is an agenda, we think, that [is
**rich in possibilities**]{.underline}.

There are currently [197 renewable energy
projects](https://indigenouscleanenergy.com/ice-projects/) associated
with Indigenous communities in Canada; however, [very few are controlled
by Indigenous
communities](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629620304722).
Renewable energy, or clean energy, is energy that is naturally derived
and processed from resources like water, wind, and sunlight. This energy
is "[replenished at a rate that is equal to or faster than the rate" at
which the resources are
consumed](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/our-natural-resources/energy-sources-distribution/renewable-energy/about-renewable-energy/7295).
Indigenous engagement in renewable energy projects is motivated by
several factors, including economic development, self-determination, and
climate change adaptation.

Renewable energy is recognized as an economic opportunity by, and for,
Indigenous Peoples. [The ]{.underline}[Cowessess Renewable Energy
Storage Facility](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sgynxHnSQbY&t=61s)[ is
one example of a First Nation-owned renewable energy project that
contributes to the economic sustainability of the nation. The facility
harnesses energy from both solar power and wind power, and as such, is
referred to as a hybrid facility. This project was developed
by ]{.underline}[Cowessess First
Nation](https://www.cowessessfn.com/)[ in 2013, and in partnership with
the ]{.underline}[Saskatchewan Research
Council](https://www.src.sk.ca/)[; it provides enough power for 340
homes. SaskPower, the power authority in Saskatchewan, is contracted to
buy electricity from the project for 20 years, with profits going to
Cowessess First Nation. In addition, the project ]{.underline}[supports
Indigenous businesses and trains and hires members of the First
Nation](https://www.wd-deo.gc.ca/eng/19965.asp)[ to sustain the
project.]{.underline}

[In another example, the ]{.underline}[Pic Mobert First
Nation](https://www.picmobert.com/)[ (population 350) owns 50% of
the ]{.underline}[Gitchi Animki Hydroelectric
Project](https://icenet.work/videos/juliannappaul/project-videos/4110/regional-power-and-pic-mobert-first-nation-white-river-gitchi-animki-hydroelectric-project#:~:text=The%20Gitchi%20Animki%20Hydroelectric%20Project,Bezhig%20and%20Gitchi%20Animki%20Niizh.)[ located
in White River, Ontario. The Pic Mobert First Nation also operates
the ]{.underline}[two generating stations of
18.9-megawatts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgsQk0qT--g)[ that were
constructed with band members, in partnership with Regional Power
Incorporated. The project generates revenue that benefits the community
and ]{.underline}[has been supplying energy to the province of Ontario's
power
grid](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/first-nations-renewable-energy-projects-1.4348595)[ since
2016.]{.underline}

[A primary motivator for Indigenous-owned-and-operated renewable energy
projects is ]{.underline}[energy
autonomy](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364032112004716)[,
a form of self-determination. Also referred to as energy
self-sufficiency, energy autonomy, reflects a community's ability to
generate, store, distribute, and sustain an energy system locally,
without the need of external intervention. In turn, some Indigenous
communities are ]{.underline}["participating in renewable energy
development as a way to assert their collective rights to land and self
determination."](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629620304722)[ The ]{.underline}[20/20
Catalysts
Program](https://indigenouscleanenergy.com/ice-2020-catalysts/)[ is one
way that Indigenous communities are supported to learn and build
knowledge and skills in developing community-based renewable energy
projects.]{.underline}

[Indigenous-led renewable energy projects and associated infrastructure
projects, like energy-efficient housing, can contribute to climate
change adaptation efforts. A
recent ]{.underline}[report](https://icenet.work/attachment?file=qrecQf4HdFgB4OHm6gR5yQ%3D%3D)[ by
the ]{.underline}[Indigenous Clean Energy (ICE)
Network](https://indigenouscleanenergy.com/)[ calls for energy
efficiency as a catalyst for a future that embraces clean energy as
foundational to Indigenous health. Financing the construction of energy
efficient homes and the retrofitting of older homes to be energy
efficient is proposed by ICE as a crucial component to both climate
adaptation and sustainable development, by reducing energy emissions,
and by facilitating job creation for Indigenous people.]{.underline}

[Fostering reconciliation](http://asharedfuture.ca/)[ through renewable
energy projects demands ]{.underline}[free, prior, and informed
consent](http://www.fao.org/indigenous-peoples/our-pillars/fpic/en/)[ and
financing to ensure that ]{.underline}[more Indigenous communities
control their own
projects](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214629620304722)[,
both during and after the development phase.]{.underline}

Despite the risks associated with renewable energy developments, on a
smaller scale, the [adoption of]{.underline} **[wind]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[hydropower]{.underline}** technologies
[in]{.underline} Canada's [Indigenous communities has
proven]{.underline} **[transformative]{.underline}**, offering a
sustainable alternative to diesel-powered facilities plagued by
contamination issues.19) In Canada, there are over 170 [remote
Indigenous communities]{.underline} that [rely]{.underline} primarily
[on diesel]{.underline} for electricity,20) but aging facilities are
[causing]{.underline} "[brownouts]{.underline}," [leading
to]{.underline} **[numerous issues]{.underline}**, [such as]{.underline}
[water boil advisories and non-functional water treatment
facilities]{.underline}. For instance, in 2022, [Iqaluit experienced
a]{.underline} **[two-month boil water advisory]{.underline}** due to an
aging diesel fuel tank leaking into the city's water supply.21)

There are some instances, especially within Canada, in which [wind and
hydropower]{.underline} have [significantly increased]{.underline} the
[sustainability of many **Arctic communities**]{.underline}, such as the
[Pic Mobert First Nation]{.underline} in Ontario. The community [owns
50% of the Gitchi Animki Hydroelectric Project]{.underline}, [or the
Henvey Inlet First Nation wind partnership]{.underline}, the largest
partnership in Canada which creates jobs and brings in millions of
dollars annually for the community.22) Indigenous led [projects have the
potential to create both the ability to trust in the longevity
of]{.underline} a [power]{.underline} source, [and]{.underline} in many
instances, [benefit from]{.underline} **[socioeconomic
assets]{.underline}** [if communities decide to own and operate their
systems]{.underline} independently.23) These [processes]{.underline} can
[give communities]{.underline} more [autonomy]{.underline}

[Position: Green transition as a driver of change The Arctic has the
potential to play an important role in the green transition, as
illustrated in the four fingerprints. Both as an important provider of
resources (material and energy), and as assistance to meet the climate
goals agreed upon in the 2015 Paris Agreement by making it easier to
replace fossil fuels with renewables as well as providing carbon
storage.]{.underline} Meanwhile, changes also bring opportunities and
green transition can be a driver of change in the Arctic -- to improve
quality of life, well-being, and support the local livelihoods in Arctic
communities. For the peoples of the Arctic, there is a need for both
sustaining the good life while being part of a global green transition
moving away from fossil fuels dependency. [Green transitions, if managed
well, can be of particular importance to the continuation and
proliferation of Indigenous cultures, as we learned from NWT. However,
other settings we have identified include how the concept can offer a
"promise" about being green and transformative without being binding or
committing to local needs or agendas.]{.underline} As FAI scholars, we
would like to encourage a green transition informed by the knowledge and
expertise that already exists within the local communities, also make
sure to connect local communities across the Arctic regions as to be
inspired by each other (instead of flying consultants up from the
south). [There are many good examples across the Arctics - like our
fingerprints - that can be beneficial for building multipurpose and
multiuser infrastructure fit for Arctic citizens. Takeaways from our
field trips, observations, and document analysis conducted in various
places in the Arctic on the current position is: 1. The Arctic has a new
strategic role because of the green transition, 2. Arctic communities
lack physical as well as policy infrastructure for a successful
transition, 3. Green transition is not "a one size fits all" in the
Arctic; different communities have different opportunities as well as
requirements when it comes to green transition, 4. There is a knowledge
gap both in terms of what Arctic communities need from a transition, and
how these needs best could be met, and 5. Green transition can become an
important driver of change in the Arctic.]{.underline}

### AT: Biopolitics

#### Biopolitics don't actually exist and the concept is flawed

**Solis & Moya 20**, Angel Octavio Alvarez Solis is professor of
philosophy at the university Iberoamericana in Mexico City. Moya holds
an M.A. in philosophy from the same university. "Against Biopolitics:
Compensation and Confinement: Entombing the Academic Left", September 25
2020,, https://publicseminar.org/essays/against-biopolitics/

[Perhaps due to its successful discursive dissemination, there are few
thinkers --the less judicious or the most reactionary ones-- who have
questioned Michel Foucault's late ideas. These disputes about the
"truth" of biopolitics culminate in such paroxysm that critique has
become a continuous theological diatribe. Everyone is engaged in an
amendment or a commentary on the grand biopolitical text: Paul B.
Preciado disputes Roberto Esposito; Esposito corrects Jean-Luc Nancy;
Nancy revises Giorgio Agamben; Agamben adjusts Foucualt, and so on,
until any of us --any average reader-- finds oneself accepting that the
virus is a product of biopower.]{.underline} However, if we pause the
time of the event, [if we take a step back from the totalizing demand of
biopolitics, we may envisage that the **biopolitical vocabulary disables
any outside and all exits**. As a good compensatory theory, biopolitics
is an anthropological diagnosis. As a good theology, biopolitics
substantiates life and kidnaps its own subject matter: life, whether it
is one's own, the life of others, or life in its constitutive
fragility.]{.underline}

I am probably exaggerating and not all biopolitics amounts to
confinement. The demand for confinement is probably compatible with
ungovernable life. Indeed, maybe the intensification of absolute control
over life is just beginning to constitute a new world order. Every
crisis has its own doubts, exaggerations, and prophecies. But crises are
also measures of time, indicators, and thresholds. The pandemic is
undoubtedly a threshold. A threshold that doesn't open up a future
because the future is the mode of time currently in jeopardy, so we have
no options or decisions to make about it. [Therefore, the problem is
that if biopolitics is defined as the sovereign administration of life,
it is precisely because, ultimately, life cannot be administered. The
sovereignty of the body is a liberal illusion. Life is always
ungovernable. As Ariadne's thread, biopolitics weaves its sovereign
arguments to construct the garment of confinement.]{.underline}

[**Due to the latter, biopolitics sets up subjectivity in a permanent
state of war:** a subjectivity articulated as a phármakon that is
capable of carrying within it both evil and salvation.]{.underline} A
gnostic subjectivity. A subjectivity that cures and poisons. A
subjectivity with friends and enemies. [A subjectivity which is at war
with itself and with the world because its isolation "saves lives" and,
even if "contaminated," has no other choice but survival]{.underline}.
That the possibility of a virus lives within each of us implies that
everyone bears the accelerated death of others and oneself. Biopolitics
transforms us into Poe's red masque or into Melville's Bartleby: forms
of anguish that cover the death drive. Biopolitics is always
necropolitics.

Biopolitics occludes the right to death. Biopolitics ensures that life
--just as death-- is a political act, that burying our dead is a
political activity and, in such a total capture of existence, we find
one of the greatest obstacles to live again. Not even the dead are safe
from the exercises of sovereignty. The dead deserve to be outside
statistical expropriation. This is why Giambattista Vico, the
philosopher of the Italian plague of 1656, was not wrong when he claimed
that, no matter how barbaric or civilized, every human form of life
possesses religion, marriage and burial. The loss of the burial rite is
the victory of biopolitics. The number trumps the name. The right to
bury our dead is the first and last locus of resistance against
biopolitical closure. The tomb is the last testimony of life, of our
life. [**Therefore, biopolitics cannot be used to exit biopolitics**. We
must avoid the biopolitical temptation of Antigone's oblivion because,
as María Zambrano reminds us, "Antigone's tomb is our own obscured
consciousness."]{.underline}

[Biopolitics forecloses the possibility of learning to live amongst
specters, amongst the "non-living," amongst the "dead" or the "nor
living nor dead,"]{.underline} because its aim of governing all life
penetrates the fantasy that life is more important than death: the death
of anyone, the death of our beloved, the death of the unknown.
[Biopolitics is not interested in tombs but in morgues, it does not
imagine cemeteries but death pits, it does not project lives but counts
deaths.]{.underline} Finally, [as a psychic structure, biopolitics is
not capable of governing life nor generating a sense for
survival]{.underline}. As a theory, [biopolitics does not explain how
the life of the dead is possible, nor does it consider the importance of
burial for life itself]{.underline}. Maybe [it can only envision the
politics of death as a statistical extension of
populations]{.underline}. [**Biopolitics does not conceive of an outside
where not all life is political and not all death is a political
issue**. **Biopolitics is, ultimately, academia's mode of confinement**.
For this reason, slightly fragile and untimely, **biopolitics is the
compensation of the academic Left in order to avoid contemplating its
own tomb** and realizing that, for a long time, it has carried the virus
of sad passions within itself.]{.underline}

### 2AC\--Consequentialism

#### Refusing to consider [consequences]{.underline} makes them [complicit]{.underline} in the structures they critique.

**Zembylas, 25**---Professor of Educational Theory and Curriculum
Studies at the Open University of Cyprus (Michalinos, "Decolonial
pathways in education: Walter Mignolo, epistemic delinking, and the
risks of ethno-essentialism," Globalisation, Societies and Education,
February 3, 2025, DOI: 10.1080/14767724.2025.2459110, dml)

In his critical analysis of intellectual decolonisation, Moosavi
(Citation2020) cautions that while decolonisation efforts are essential,
they come with notable limitations. In particular, he identifies five
such **[limitations]{.underline}** that [can **undermine** the
effectiveness of decolonisation efforts]{.underline}: [the tendency to
**oversimplify** decolonisation as a **straightforward**
task]{.underline}; [the risk of **essentialising** or **appropriating**
the Global South]{.underline}; [the failure to recognise the **varied**
and **complex** nature of marginalisation within academia]{.underline};
[the pitfalls of **nativism**]{.underline}, which may elevate certain
cultural knowledge uncritically; [and **tokenism**]{.underline}, [which
can **reduce** decolonisation to **superficial gestures** rather than
**meaningful change**]{.underline}. Moosavi argues that [identifying
these pitfalls is **critical**]{.underline}, [as certain approaches to
intellectual decolonisation may **inadvertently perpetuate** the **very
coloniality they aim to dismantle**]{.underline}, thereby
[**reinforcing** power hierarchies and marginalisation rather than
**subverting** them]{.underline}. His insights serve as a reminder that
decolonisation must be approached thoughtfully and critically, ensuring
it is grounded in genuine inclusivity and avoids replicating reductive
or exclusionary practices.

Similarly, Naicker (Citation2023) warns that decolonial theory's
'[exclusively and moralistically exclusionary anti-Westernism begins
**mirroring** the rightist tendencies it sought to locate **solely**
within a **fabricated Western essence**]{.underline}' (237).Footnote1
Although such a sweeping critique risks oversimplifying decolonial
theory, it raises important concerns about the potential pitfalls of an
epistemic approach to decolonisation, particularly regarding its
reliance on identity politics. [When decolonial discourse **primarily**
focuses on **rejecting** Western frameworks **without** self-reflection
on the **consequences** of such move]{.underline}, [it risks becoming
**entangled** in the **same exclusionary impulses** it seeks to
challenge]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} critique points to a crucial
tension in decolonial thought: how can scholars engage in meaningful
anticolonial work without reducing the complexities of colonial power
relations to a binary opposition between 'the West' and 'the non-West'?

One reason I prefer the term 'anticolonial' (Sefa Dei and Lordan
Citation2016; Zembylas Citation2024) over 'decolonial' is because it
[underscores the need to embed **historical awareness** and **political
engagement** into decolonial work]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}
approach [challenges scholars to go **beyond** a strictly epistemic
focus]{.underline}, [asking]{.underline} instead [whether
our]{.underline} decolonisation [efforts address **material** realities
and power structures that perpetuate colonial legacies]{.underline}.
[While epistemic decolonisation **critiques** Western knowledge
hierarchies]{.underline}, [it often **stops short** of engaging with the
**political** and **material mechanisms** that reproduce these
hierarchies]{.underline}. [This raises an important
question]{.underline} for decolonial scholarship in education: [Are
scholars at risk of **inadvertently reinforcing** essentialist or
exclusionary narratives that may align with nationalist or authoritarian
agendas?]{.underline}

Future investigations into anticolonial thought in education should
therefore consider several critical questions. How can scholars ensure
that decolonial work does not become co-opted to support
ethno-essentialist or exclusionary politics, as seen when nationalist
discourses appropriate decolonial language to advance their own
hegemonic ends? How can decolonial scholarship in education remain open
to plural voices and multiple narratives without devolving into
uncritical nativism? Additionally, how might we address the complex
interplay between local and global forms of oppression without reducing
anticolonial thought to a simplistic dichotomy between 'the West' and
'the non-West'? [Addressing these questions may allow education scholars
to develop anticolonial approaches that not only **critique** epistemic
colonialism]{.underline}, [but also **actively challenge** political and
material structures that **hinder** collective liberation and social
justice]{.underline} through educational policies and practices [in
**different** political contexts]{.underline}.

[In a separate document, an RCMP officer states that arrests would be

[Wet'suwet'en people and their supporters set up the Gidimt'en
checkpoint in December 2018 to block construction of the pipeline
through this region of mountains and pine forests 750 miles north of
Vancouver.]{.underline}

[On 7 January, RCMP officers -- dressed in military-green fatigues and
armed with assault rifles -- ]{.underline}[descended on the
checkpoint](https://thetyee.ca/Analysis/2019/01/08/LNG-Pipeline-Unistoten-Blockade/)[,

[The checkpoint lies 22km east of a camp operated by a house group of
the Wet'suwet'en called
the ]{.underline}[Unist'ot'en](https://unistoten.camp/)[, which has been
at the center of the struggle against the pipeline.]{.underline}

[The camp is one of several instances where Indigenous people in British
Columbia have reinhabited ancestral territory that falls outside of
demarcated reservations, in what they refer to as
"reoccupation".]{.underline}

[Unist'ot'en spokesperson Freda Huson (Howilhkat) said that the RCMP's
militarized posture during the raid was consistent with a long history
of colonial violence.]{.underline}

["In our experience, since first contact, RCMP have been created by the
federal government to dispossess ]{.underline}[Indigenous
peoples](https://www.theguardian.com/world/indigenous-peoples)[ of their

of my people to support Coastal GasLink in invading our

[Police records seen by the Guardian include transcripts from police
strategy sessions, reports filed after the raid and audio and video
files.]{.underline}

[One document noted that the Wet'suwet'en possessed "firearms for
hunting/sustenance" but police intelligence indicated that there was "no
single threat indicating that \[land defenders\] will use
firearms".]{.underline}

[An RCMP spokesperson declined to comment on the specific content of the
documents, saying they were merely carrying out a December 2018
injunction against people who interfere with the CGL
pipeline.]{.underline}

["During the planning for the enforcement of the court-ordered
injunction, the RCMP took the remote location of the Morice River Bridge
into account and ensured that enough police officers were present in the
area to keep the peace," the spokesperson said. "We also took into
consideration the unpredictable nature of what we could face in the
remote area, and so we moved additional police resources including
members of the tactical and emergency response teams to provide
support."]{.underline}

Mackinder's geopolitics became a practice of "visualizing and surveying
global space with a view that writes."23 [Since critical geopolitics has
a radical, anti-imperial agenda,]{.underline} the [use of maps could be
misconstrued as condoning a Western imperialist agenda]{.underline}.
[Maps are an important tool in geopolitics]{.underline} and essential
when attempting to explain global conflict, [but they are studiously
avoided in critical geopolitics]{.underline}. Let's look again at
Roberts, Secor, and Sparke's critique of Thomas Barnett's "Pentagon's
New Map." According to Barnett the areas within the lines in Figure 1
represent parts of the world that are "disconnected," i.e., they lack
the rule of law, a robust judiciary, functioning institutions, a working
infrastructure and high speed internet connections. It is here where the
US is fighting terrorists, pirates, drug smugglers, gun runners, and
human traffickers. These are also the places where the US military has
deployed most often since 1990 (Figure 1, Appendix A). Barnett calls
this part of the world the "Gap." The "Core" in Figure 1 consists of
those states outside the "Gap." This core constitutes most of the Group
of 20 states (G-20). Barnett, unknowingly, identified the G-20 as
constituting the global "Core," and, in fact, the G-20 is the core of
the global economy. The G-20 constitutes 90% of global GDP, 85% of
global trade, and 75% of global population.24 Barnett argues that the
disconnect in the Gap fosters terrorism and repressive regimes. His
advice to the Pentagon is that by shrinking the Gap, the Core could
increase their security and reduce terrorism. Barnett specifically
states that neo-liberalism has the potential to shrink the gap -- which
is anti-anti-geopolitics. Roberts, Secor, and Sparke argue that
Barnett's neo-liberal, pro-globalisation argument, like modernity and
development before it (and let's not forget Marxism), is a totalising
discourse that presents the false idea that free trade is the path to
world peace and prosperity. To Roberts, Secor, and Sparke, "The map is
both that which is to be explained and the explanation itself,
descriptive of the recent past and predictive of future action. For
Barnett, the map reveals an indisputable pattern from which geopolitical
knowledge can be read."25 It is "binary" and Barnett seems intent to
create the Gap as a continuous area. There is no "Gap in the Core and no
Core in the Gap; no details that might disrupt his Mackinderesque bands
of homogenized planetary difference."26 [Again the few maps employed by
critical geo-politicians are the ones they critique]{.underline} -- in
the Geopolitical Reader it was Mackinder's map of 1904, and now it's
Barnett's map of 2003. [Political scientists and economists don't seem
to have any problems analysing conflict at a global scale, i.e.,
"Mackinderesque," but in critical geopolitics any attempt to map the
world at the global scale is usually dismissed as "Mackinderesque" and
therefore imperialist, racist, sexist, and deterministic]{.underline}.27
[According to critical geopolitics, after one hundred years, geographers
are still getting their maps wrong]{.underline}. Roberts, Secor, and
Sparke go on to say that the "Gap thus represents a (f)rigid and torrid
zone, both wretched and resistant." They continue by stating the
audience for Barnett's map is just "one more incarnation of the
masculine authority figure, the hetero-patriarchical savior \... (read
Mackinder)."28 [Even if their critique is correct, it is tautological
because just as the map "is that which is to be explained and the
explanation itself" the critique of the map is that which is to be
critiqued and the critique itself]{.underline}. In their conclusion
there is no alternative geopolitics provided, but simply a critique of
how the map was purportedly used to persuade people in power to invade
Iraq and advance a neo-liberal, Western imperial agenda. [Rather than
simply critiquing the 2,000-year-old Greek latitudinal zonation model,
critical geopolitics could include more nuanced environmental hypotheses
such as]{.underline} those presented in Jeffrey Sach's [European
Mortality Index]{.underline}; Jared Diamond's [founder crop
hypothesis]{.underline}; Fareed [Zakaria's explanation of the rise of
Europe; or]{.underline} Jim Lee's [eco-regional approach to global
conflict]{.underline}.29 [Yes, the Greek model was simplistic and
(f)rigid, but there have been real advances in physical and economic
geography over the last 2,000 years]{.underline}, which brings us to our
third critic -- radical geopolitics is anti-environmental.

**The alternative cannot solve it so long as it requires the judge's
affirmation.**

Psychoanalysis adds another significant dimension here: the reason why
[intersectional identity politics appeals]{.underline} in today's
multicultural world is **[because of the subject's
enjoyment]{.underline}** (jouissance) **[of it]{.underline}** --
enjoyment in Lacanese denoting the excessive pleasure derived from
something to the point of irrationality (Lacan, 1998: 183--4). 4
Accordingly, under a multicultural regime, [the subject is **seduced by
the prospect of** social and political **recognition and
recovery**]{.underline} (Thakur, 2020: xx--xxi; Žižek, 2006: 309).
[Intersectionality's libidinal reward can be seen in]{.underline} a
range of current socio-political occurrences: the (liberal) benevolence
of granting rights and [**rescuing** and rehabilitating **oppressed
voices**; the]{.underline} corresponding **[thrill of being recognized
by claiming identity]{.underline}** or minority rights; **[the self-
righteousness of asserting]{.underline}** one's oppression and
'**[victimhood]{.underline}**'; [and]{.underline}/or **[the narcissism
of acknowledging one's]{.underline}** personal guilt and
**[complicity]{.underline}** in social injustices. Of particular note is
'privilege theory' (Applebaum, 2011; Kimmel and Ferber, 2016), which,
while [bringing attention to privileged subject positions and
complicity]{.underline} in homophobia, patriarchy, or racism,
[can]{.underline} sometimes [create an atmosphere of **surveillance**
and **disciplining**]{.underline} ('privilege checking') [of both self
and other]{.underline}. As Zalloua (2020) notes, [there is]{.underline}
'[a kind of illicit satis- faction]{.underline} -- an unconscious
enjoyment -- not only [in]{.underline} exposing the blind spots \[and\]
. . . **[rhetorical disciplining]{.underline}** of others, but in your
own self-discipline, in your perceived suffering. . . . At its base
level, [privilege theory provides you]{.underline} with [the **fantasy
of intervention and action**; it offers you criticism]{.underline}
([attention to subjective violence]{.underline}) **[without
critique]{.underline}** ([occluding]{.underline} objective \[i.e.
[systemic]{.underline}\] [violence]{.underline})' (pp. 36, 18). [So
invested can people become in identity]{.underline} (their own and that
of others) [that they can get **bogged down in battles over recognition
and self-policing**]{.underline}.

[The libidinal complement]{.underline} to intersectional identity
politics thus [reinforces the culturalization of liberal democratic
politics. **Real social problems**]{.underline} (discrimination,
marginalization, racialization, inequality) **[are pressingly raised,
but]{.underline}** only **[superficially]{.underline}** or partially
[**acted upon**. People enjoy and publicize their critical
self-awareness, their empathy with the oppressed, and their]{.underline}
seemingly [progressive]{.underline} and humanitarian
[politics]{.underline}, but **[without taking any meaningful
action]{.underline}** (**[confronting]{.underline}** the **[systemic
barriers to]{.underline}** inequalities, **[or demanding collective and
material rights]{.underline}**, not simply individual civil and cultural
rights). [We feel good about naming our complicity in global
inequality]{.underline}, or **[we get off on surveilling others' lack of
'political correctness']{.underline}**, but [this only ends up
**reinforcing** the particularity, fragmentation, and depoliticization
that capitalist liberal democracies count on]{.underline}.

**The alt's refusal of humanism poisons its potential.**

Catton and Dunlap (1978), among others, have challenged the social
sciences to engage in the urgent task of dismantling the \'human
exceptionalism paradigm\'. Since then, myriad bodies of
transdisciplinary sciences and activism have constructed important
alternatives to the Enlightenment ontology of nature as primordial,
autonomous, and mechanistic, open to human extractivism (cf. Goldman and
Schurman, 2000). In [the non-human turn]{.underline}, this [is often
translated into the need to \'de-centre the human\']{.underline}. We
strongly identify with movements fighting against states' and elites'
exceptionalist claims to having the right to destroy the planet and
accumulate \'natural resources\'. At the same time, however, we warn
activists and academics of the need for caution regarding how
popularised non-human and RoN/RoR policy debates ontologically and
generically tend to de-centre the human. One main reason is that
[human]{.underline} (elite) [groups certainly are exceptional in how
they have radically transformed the human/non-human milieux]{.underline}
(Grusin, 2015; Büscher, 2021). [This demands that we address the **roots
and impacts of this exceptionality, instead of \'ontologising it
away\'**]{.underline}. It also asks for political contestation and the
devising of strategies to make particular classes responsible.
[De-centring the human in policy and activist currents may]{.underline}
tend to [**create binaries** between \'generalised humans\' and
\'generalised non-humans\'. These]{.underline} binaries may [blind us
not just to the exceptionally destructive capacities of some humans and
their inventions, but also to the exceptional suffering of
others]{.underline}. At the same time, it might blind us from
recognising the exceptionally creative capacities that humans have for
reversing the transformation, not just of their own environments, but of
the planetary system as a whole.

[In]{.underline} mainstream [water policies]{.underline}, for instance,
[de-centring humans' exceptional agency has led to **overlooking** the
**complex lived realities of riverine families, livelihoods, meanings,
values, identities, and rights systems**. These policies]{.underline}
have [constructed their own river dwellers and water users, with
identities that conveniently fit the models and policies]{.underline}
(Roa-García, 2014; Hoogesteger, 2015; Hidalgo-Bastidas et al., 2018). In
this way, [they justify **dramatic interventions**]{.underline} (e.g.
Nixon, 2009; Sanchis-Ibor et al., 2017; Lynch, 2019; Aubriot, 2022;
Duarte-Abadía, 2023; Heikkinen, 2024). The [mainstream nature-science-
policy nexus **takes exceptional agency away from \'targeted human
beneficiaries\' and simplifies their ontological diversity in line with
expert notions**. It]{.underline} thereby [produces policy models that
**depoliticise their deeply political choices while dehumanising the
people they affect**]{.underline}. In fact, [they perceive and construct
abstract \'equals\' rather than recognising highly differentiated and
plural realities]{.underline}.

Brackel et al. (2023) provide a common illustration. Communities
affected by the Manila Bay Sustainable Development Master Plan
(elaborated by Dutch and Pilipino \'experts\') were reduced to \"people
in PowerPoint pixels\". These people, who would soon be displaced,
disappeared from view through the \'upscaling perspective\' of
hydro-territorial transformation programs (cf. Melsen et al., 2018).
[Actively de-centring the human, and]{.underline} thereby [constructing
ignorance, helps to \'rationally\' intervene in the complex water world.
This **de-humanises water reality**. Rather than revealing]{.underline}
the [on-the-ground realities, **only governable subjects and objects
appear: an empty space for constructing and ordering rivers, water
users, and identities**]{.underline}.

[This picture is the contrary of what the posthuman]{.underline} and
non-human [turns intend to accomplish]{.underline}. Nevertheless, [in
de-centring the human]{.underline}, many dam removal
[campaigns]{.underline} in North America and Europe tend to
[misrecognise]{.underline} the peasant [communities]{.underline} who
build their livelihoods on the small and medium- sized dam systems --
dams whose removal they project will \'enliven rivers\' and re-centre
nature (for critical reflections, see Sneddon et al., 2017; Drapier et
al., 2023; Harrington and Cantor, 2024). Hommes (2022: 604) shows how
communities along Spain's Mijares river fiercely contest dam removal
that would dry out a local irrigation canal: \"Destroying the Toranes
Dam is damaging this natural, territorial, and social ecosystem in which
we live, it is destroying an organised community \[in reference to the
irrigation community\]\". Another illustration is how RoN policy
advocates may unwittingly collaborate in new enclosures of riverine
commons (Duarte-Abadía et al., 2023). For instance, in the Andean
wetlands of Tungurahua, Ecuador, campesino-indigenous communities deploy
territory-situated conservation practices, but international
conservation agencies threaten them with RoN-based court cases that
could take away their ancestral governance rights if they fail to comply
with PES-based conservation schemes (pers. com. Juan Hidalgo-Bastidas,
10/04/2024). In parallel, RoN and RoR policies de-centring the human may
invisibilise powerful interests. Kinkaid (2019: 561), for instance,
shows how RoN imposition on the Hindu-religious rivers Ganges and Yamuna
by India's right-wing Hindu-nationalist government may lead to the
violent expulsion of Muslim and Dalit river dwellers (labelled
\'unclean\' tannery polluters of the sacred rivers) while leaving the
overall environmental status quo unchallenged.

In general, Büscher posits that, [for the purpose of understanding how
capitalism has made humans alienate themselves from
non-humans]{.underline}, \"\[...\] [it **makes little sense to decentre
the human**]{.underline}\" (2021: 7). [Because we live in increasingly
alienated interrelationships, we have to **re-emphasise
our**]{.underline} (**[human]{.underline}**) [**bonds with and
dependence on the rest of life**. This pays **genuine attention to the
agency, life worlds, and exceptional potential of highly divergent water
commons and collectives**]{.underline}. This [re-centring
would]{.underline} also [challenge any de-contextualised and detached
prescription of the diverse identities and nature of human and non-human
collectives]{.underline}.

### 2AC\-\--AT: anti-state alts

**The state will [inevitably assert itself]{.underline}, and [direct
action]{.underline} techniques are [insufficient]{.underline} to
resist.**

Michael **Murphy 19**, Ph.D. Political Science, McGill University; M.A.
Political Science, University of Western Ontario; Professor, Faculty of
Indigenous Studies, Social Sciences and Humanities, University of
Northern British Columbia, 2019, "Indigenous Peoples and the Struggle
for Self-Determination: A Relational Strategy," *Canadian Journal of
Human Rights*, 8(1), pp. 67-102,
https://cjhr.ca/indigenous-peoples-and-the-struggle-for-self-determination-a-relational-strategy/

Additionally, [not all **Indigenous peoples**]{.underline} are [opposed
to participating in **state institutions**]{.underline}. Some are, but
many others maintain that participation is a crucial means of shaping or
influencing state policies that impact their rights, interests and
well-being.21 Beyond this purely functional rationale for Indigenous
participation, [**evidence** from **multiple
jurisdictions**]{.underline}, including **[Australia]{.underline}**,
**[New Zealand]{.underline}**, [Canada]{.underline}, the
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates and [Latin American
countries sugges]{.underline}ts that [many Indigenous people
value]{.underline} their [engagement with]{.underline} the political,
social, and educational [institutions of the **wider
society**]{.underline}. [These **Indigenous peoples**
embrace]{.underline} their [status as **state citizens**
and]{.underline} as [citizens of their own]{.underline} self-determining
Indigenous [communities]{.underline}. Similarly, there is no consensus
among Indigenous peoples regarding the compatibility of Indigeneity and
the pursuit of capitalist modes of economic development. Many Indigenous
communities have adopted and modified capitalist economic development.
As a result, they have reaped significant economic benefits, but also
augmented their capacity to advance some of their key social, cultural
and political objectives in the process.22

Perhaps [the biggest weakness of a **resurgence approach** lies
in]{.underline} its [response to the **power imbalance** that profoundly
shapes **Indigenous-state relationships** worldwide]{.underline}. [While
this]{.underline} approach [accurately diagnoses]{.underline} the
severity of this **[power imbalance]{.underline}** -- what Coulthard
refers to as the "sheer magnitude of discursive and nondiscursive power
we find ourselves up against in our struggles" -- ultimately it fails to
offer a convincing strategy for counteracting its effects, and for
advancing an extraordinarily ambitious program of Indigenous economic
and political independence.23 A [strategic withdrawal from the
state]{.underline} may very well [aid the process of
**self-decolonization**]{.underline}, but [it will not stop state
judicial and legislative bodies from asserting their jurisdiction over
**Indigenous territories**]{.underline}, governments and economies. [Nor
will it stop state policy **governing activities**]{.underline} (e.g.
**[resource extraction]{.underline}**, industrial development,
**[environmental review]{.underline}**) [on lands]{.underline} adjacent
to Indigenous communities from continuing to impact Indigenous
territories, environments and well-being. Finally, [it will not change
the fact that many Indigenous communities will continue to be
**dependent on the state**]{.underline} for economic support, programs
and services and the building and maintenance of public
infrastructure.24

Indeed, [a wholesale retreat]{.underline} from state institutions [runs
the risk of increasing the vulnerability of **Indigenous
communities**]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} would [occur by ensuring
that **Indigenous people** have **no voice**]{.underline}, and thus, no
influence in those very same institutions (e.g. courts, legislatures,
constitutional forums, resource consent and co-management bodies) that
significantly impact their rights, interests and well-being. [Although
direct action can be an effective tool for advancing or defending
**Indigenous interests**]{.underline}, [past experience suggests that it
is **no magic bullet** in the struggle for
**self-determination**]{.underline}. Direct action campaigns are
difficult to sustain over longer periods of time because they sometimes
aggravate internal community divisions and alienate outside sources of
support and solidarity, frequently achieve only limited objectives and
in many cases, fail outright.25 The [limitations of direct action are
even more apparent for **smaller Indigenous communities** that lack
financial and **organizational resources**]{.underline} as well as
external allies. However, even in countries like Bolivia and Ecuador
where very large, well-organized and resourced Indigenous social
movements have made significant advances towards self-determination,
there is a perception that direct action on its own is inadequate to
achieve the desired scale of reform. This [perception led Indigenous
activists to pursue parallel and complementary **institutional routes**
to advance their goals]{.underline} -- most notably, **[electoral
politics]{.underline}**.26 Therefore, it is [crucial to understand both
the **advantages and limitations** of direct action]{.underline}, and to
acknowledge that this approach is [more effective as]{.underline} part
of a **[broader]{.underline}**, [multi-pronged strategy of]{.underline}
advancing **[Indigenous self-determination]{.underline}**.

#### Anti-statism performs an [ethical]{.underline} and [existential failure]{.underline} by abandoning the [ethical pursuit of revolutionary power]{.underline} through the [nation-state]{.underline}.

(Amelia, "Nothing's More Precious Than a Hole in the Ground," Australian
Humanities Review 71 (May 2023), dml) \[language modifications denoted

A Western turn away from internationalism and towards critiques of power
cannot be traced back to a single point: one cannot place it simply as a
result of, say, the New Left insurgencies, Foucault or indeed fractures
within or around the Soviet or Sino-Soviet projects. In our time [a
**great contradiction** has arisen between ethical
minoritarianism]{.underline}, in itself not a bad thing, [and any notion
of commanding the **machinery of state** through which
some]{.underline}, but not all, [of these ethical conundrums can be
resolved]{.underline}. [To frame]{.underline} the climate [crisis
through the lens of **individual** or even **generational** guilt and
argue it should be addressed through an **ethics of care** risks
**obscuring** both its material and historical **foundations** and its
potential **remedies**]{.underline}. John Frow, writing on the 'agents'
that hold some power over the 'transmission of a world' laments that
they are 'nation states, political parties, ... and only in the last
instance a citizenry with a stake in a future world' (26). Yet [it is
**vital** at this juncture that we **do not abandon** the idea of a
**nation** with a responsibility]{.underline} for its citizenry, or a
political party with responsibility [for the **future**]{.underline}.
[The globe is **not solely constituted** by]{.underline} multi-party
[democracies held hostage to fossil capital with a disenfranchised and
economically privileged citizenry]{.underline}. [In]{.underline} those
[other nations]{.underline}---marginalised and blacklisted as they might
be by Northern centres of capital and imperial power---[there are
**models worth considering**]{.underline}.

A [hostility to states and nations]{.underline}, while understandable in
the specific Australian sub-imperialist context, [**does not hold up**
to theoretical scrutiny if our horizon is equality]{.underline}: global,
intergenerational and otherwise. Samir Amin, for instance, notes how
[an]{.underline} '"**[anti-state]{.underline}**" [strategy]{.underline}'
[unites **perfectly** with the capitalist's strategy to **reduce**
actions by the state to **redistribute wealth** and **regulate
corporations**]{.underline}, [and instead **reduce** the state's role to
its **policing** functions]{.underline} (27). At this late stage of
ecological catastrophe, [the **mass extinctions** and **depredations**
of our **planet**]{.underline} under capitalism [demand]{.underline},
[as an **ethical imperative**]{.underline}, [**large-scale changes**
that can be **only** enacted on the level of the **state** and
**international blocs** with sufficient **organisational capacity** and
**drive** to bring such changes to fruition]{.underline}. Likewise, [a
total **antagonism** to]{.underline} '**[nation]{.underline}**' **[does
not get us anywhere]{.underline}**. Expressions of Australian
nationalism typically operate along state-sanctioned lines and celebrate
invasion, colonisation and genocide. This is because Australia is not
Indigenous-led, and because it remains, in real economic and political
terms, shackled to an old empire (Britain) and dependent on the new one
(the United States). However, [to have a **wider view**]{.underline},
[informed by the **histories** of anti-imperialism and decolonisation in
**Asia**]{.underline}, [**Africa** and **Latin America**]{.underline},
[is to be aware of the **crucial role** of national liberation movements
in successful struggles against colonial rule]{.underline}. [Nation can
be the **only thing** that stands between a group of people and their
exploitation by imperialist powers]{.underline}. [Nations can be
**revolutionary**]{.underline}, [such as the national liberation fronts
in **Southern Africa**]{.underline}, [nations can be
**Indigenous**]{.underline}, [as with **First Nations**]{.underline}. [A
discourse without sufficient nuance on the question of nation
**ignores** how]{.underline}, [in contemporary geopolitics]{.underline},
[it is on the level of **nation** that military and economic imperialist
endeavours are met with the **most significant
resistance**]{.underline}. [Being unequivocally against
nation]{.underline}, to quote Amin, '[encourages the **acceptance** of
the role of the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [as **military superpower** and **world
policeman**]{.underline}' (27).

Unfortunately, the fall of the USSR and [historical
mistakes]{.underline} of socialism [have encouraged]{.underline},
generally speaking, a [drawing inward]{.underline} among Western
leftists, [towards **individual ethics** and away from the **ethical
pursuit of power**]{.underline}. The turn of the left away from
international solidarity and towards capitalism and compromise can be
read sociologically. Radhika Desai notes how the major parties of the
left within bourgeois capitalist states are today commandeered by a
professional managerial class of neoliberal converts, whereas their
counterparts in earlier eras had been socialists and Marxists. The
result is a left that mistakenly 'attributes the prosperity of the major
capitalist powers to capitalism's productive vigour, not their
imperialism, and refuses to contemplate how to organise production in
socialist societies and how to do so against the inevitable opposition
of imperialism's remaining bastions' (Desai). [Comprehending the
**textures** of imperialism is **key**]{.underline} here. [If we view
the world **solely** through a lens cut by the **US imperial
core**]{.underline}, [we will]{.underline} be blind to
\[**[ignore]{.underline}**\] [geopolitical material forces and
context]{.underline}, [we will not]{.underline} see
\[[know]{.underline}\] [what empire **does** nor will we comprehend the
**alternatives** outside it]{.underline}. [If we **actually want
transformation** within]{.underline} Australia and [the centres of
imperial capital]{.underline} it subordinates itself to, [it is
**imperative** to look and learn from **alternative models** being
practiced in the world]{.underline}. [At the very least we can learn
**what not to do**]{.underline}, [and recognise the **vast
difficulties** of the challenge ahead]{.underline}. [For the sake of the
**planet** and our **species** we need to ask]{.underline}: what is it
that we can learn from countries that in their post-revolutionary phases
have not only built barricades of resistance to the US world order, but
also made significant achievements at home? [Is]{.underline}
intergenerational [justice possible **without** geopolitical
materialism?]{.underline}

#### We're anti-anti-state.

**Gordon, 24**---Associate Professor of Political Science and Africana
Studies at University of Connecticut (Jane Anna, "Creolising the
State?," Theoria, Volume 71: Issue 181 (Dec 2024), dml)

In Statelessness and Contemporary Enslavement (2020), I offered a brief
defence of the state in what I preliminarily termed an
**[anti-anti-statism]{.underline}**. I formulated it this way to
[acknowledge that]{.underline}, [given the **active complicity** of
states in the production of **statelessness** and]{.underline}
conditions that foster [contemporary **enslavement**]{.underline}, [it
is **not hard** to recognise the appeal of **anarchistic**
approaches]{.underline} amongst some of the most politically committed.
As was true in the first quarter of the twentieth century, contemporary
[states appear as primarily **predatory** and
**kleptocratic**]{.underline}, [either **unable** or **unwilling** to
counteract]{.underline} the [precariousness]{.underline} created by
current political economic developments and their violently xenophobic
expressions.

Still, I argued, as indispensable as [these insights]{.underline} are,
they [must be mobilised to formulate a **viable
anti-anti-statism**]{.underline}. After all, [conceiving global
responses to developments that have made vulnerability highly lucrative
**must involve governments** and **political
institutions**]{.underline}. What is more, in most versions
[anti-statism rests on a **logical circularity** in which political
institutions that are **not liked** are synonymous with **states** while
responsive]{.underline}, [legitimate ones are called **something
else**]{.underline}. [Rather than letting the exploitative
instantiations of the state or instances of state capture **monopolise**
and **exhaust** the term]{.underline}, [the state must also include the
deeply imperfect **New Deal** government]{.underline} of Franklin D.
Roosevelt [and experiments in **Caribbean socialism** that
produced]{.underline}, amongst other outcomes, the free medical training
offered by [the **Cuban healthcare system**]{.underline}. Surely
'**[states]{.underline}**' [include neo-fascist varieties]{.underline},
[political institutions that expand human freedom]{.underline}, [and
everything in between]{.underline}. If so, [the question is **not**
whether we are **for** or **against** states but about the **kinds** of
political institutions we need and **how** they are
constructed]{.underline}. As Alix Olson and Alex Zamalin write: 'If
democracy is intended to be enacted by the people, then the state itself
is ours to reimagine and those desires are to be collectively acted
upon' (2024: 151).

This observation informs a second pragmatic one. [We **cannot cede**
existing states to those with **no aversions** to most of the globe
living in unsustainable conditions of unfreedom]{.underline}. [This
refusal is not achieved only through interacting with states through
**established channels**]{.underline}. [It also entails engaging in
activities that make it **politically dangerous** for such bodies **not

[**assemblage** of forces]{.underline}.' The resulting 'cacophony

#### Nation-states [inevitable]{.underline}.

**Malešević, 23**---Full Professor and Chair of Sociology at the
University College, Dublin (Siniša, "The Many Faces of Nationalism,"
Nationalities Papers, First View, doi:10.1017/nps.2022.114, dml)

Only [**twenty years** ago]{.underline}, many scholars interpreted
nationalism as an ideology experiencing gradual and inevitable decline.
Social and political [theorists]{.underline} from Ulrich Beck and
Anthony Giddens to David Held and Zygmunt Bauman [were **adamant** that
globalization had **dissolved** the borders of nation-states and
that]{.underline} "old style [nationalism]{.underline}" [had become
**obsolete**]{.underline} (Giddens Reference Giddens2002, 18). Even as
an astute thinker as Hartmut Rosa (Reference Rosa2013, 203--4) could not
escape this type of reasoning, as he wrote about the ever increasing
"denationalization" of societies and the "loss of the national state's
function in the age of globalization." Today, the focus has shifted in
the opposite direction and many scholars speak about the resurgence,
revival, return, renewal, or re-emergence of nationalism (Tamir
Reference Tamir2019; Hazony Reference Hazony2018; Judis Reference
Judis2018). For example, Tamir (Reference Tamir2019, 3) writes how "the
reemergence of nationalism has taken the world by surprise" while Hazony
(Reference Hazony2018) points to the "return to nationalism" that is
exemplified by "the British vote for independence and a nationalist
revival in the United States." The 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine has
further intensified this view of nationalism's "re-emergence."

However, there is nothing new to these types of pronouncements, as
[intellectuals have been **writing off** nationalism since its inception
and have]{.underline} then [just as often been]{.underline} [**regularly
surprised** by its]{.underline} "sudden" and "unexpected"
[periodic]{.underline} "**[revival]{.underline}**." From Rosa Luxemburg
and Karl Popper to Friedrich Hayek, political [theorists have
**habitually dismissed** nationalism as a temporary anomaly bound to
disappear soon]{.underline} (Malešević Reference Malešević2019, 1--5).
As [this **does not happen**]{.underline}, many intellectuals express
astonishment every time nationalism becomes highly visible in public
discourses. Hence the focus usually shifts towards finding the immediate
causes of something that is in fact a longue durée phenomenon and, as
such, requires structural and historical explanations.

The classical scholarship on nationalism demonstrated a long time ago
that [such dismissive proclamations have **no foundation in historical
reality**]{.underline} (Gellner Reference Gellner1983; Anderson
Reference Anderson1983; Smith Reference Smith1986). Nationalism
developed quite late as a sociological phenomenon, but [once it took
hold of state power its growth was **largely continuous**]{.underline}.
[Nationalist doctrine has managed to **replace** competing ideological
discourses of state legitimacy]{.underline}, [including the divine
origins of monarchs]{.underline}, [imperial creeds]{.underline}, [and
the]{.underline} notion of a [civilizing mission]{.underline}, among
many others. From the end of WWII, [nationalism has gradually attained
many **hegemonic features** and has become the **dominant form** of
political legitimacy]{.underline} in the contemporary world. [In
addition to **acquiring state power** and **enveloping official
institutions** and **non-state organizations**]{.underline}, [this
ideology and social practice has **penetrated civil society**
and]{.underline} the inter-personal networks of **[everyday
life]{.underline}**. The [scholarship]{.underline} on everyday
nationalism [clearly indicates how **embedded** nation-centric thinking
is]{.underline} our daily practices (Fox and Iddriss, Reference Fox and
Miller-Idriss2008, Skey and Antonsich Reference Skey and Antonsich2018,
Knott Reference Knott2016). Hence [nationalism **never** experienced a
significant decline]{.underline}. Instead, [over the last **two hundred
years** one could witness an **incessant proliferation** of nationalism
across the globe and within different social strata]{.underline} of
individual societies. As I have argued before, [the historical
trajectory of nationalism has been shaped by **nearly
continuous**]{.underline} organizational, ideological, and
micro-interactional [grounding **across** time and space]{.underline}
(Malešević Reference Malešević, Höhne and Meireis2020, Reference
Malešević2019, Reference Malešević2013). [The **relative invisibility**
of this grounding]{.underline} and the lack of aggressive language in
the public discourse [have prevented many]{.underline} commentators
[from **adequately assessing** the actual strength of nationalist
penetration in everyday life]{.underline}. Thus, as [nationalism **never
went away**]{.underline}, [**nor** it was in **decline**]{.underline},
it could not experience a "re-emergence" or "return." [The recent
proliferation of aggressive nationalist discourses does not indicate
its]{.underline} "**[revival]{.underline}**," [it only makes ongoing
nationalist practices **more visible**]{.underline} in the public space.
In this sense, nationalism resembles the proverbial iceberg: many pay
attention to its tip when there is a threat of direct collision, even
though the iceberg has been there before and much of it remains
invisible to the human eye.

One of the reasons why intellectuals tend to regularly downplay the
significance of [nationalism]{.underline} is that this phenomenon [has
**many faces**]{.underline}. Nationalism has protean features
[that]{.underline}, like a chameleon, [can **easily adapt** to its
surroundings]{.underline}. Scholars have traditionally invoked the image
of the Roman god Janus to pinpoint the two contradictory faces of
nationalism - as a force of collective solidarity, but also as a
mechanism of group aggression against those that do not belong to the
nation (Nairn Reference Nairn2005). However nationalism has many faces
-- [it is a **multifaceted** political ideology]{.underline}, [a
**habitual form** of everyday practice]{.underline}, [and a **very
plastic** type of modern subjectivity]{.underline}.

[Nationalism is]{.underline} a **[flexible]{.underline}** discourse
[and]{.underline} social practice that [can coalesce with far right and
far left ideologies but can also accommodate moderate positions **across
the political spectrum**]{.underline}. Nationalist ideas are the
cornerstone of such ideologically diverse movements as the far right
Reconquete! in France and Finns Party in Finland, and far-left groups
such as the Catalan Candidatura d'Unitat Popular or the United Socialist
Party of Venezuela. Similarly nationalist principles feature prominently
in center right parties such as the Conservatives in the UK, Forza
Italia, or the Croatian Democratic Union, and in the center left
parties, such as Scottish National Party, the Bulgarian Socialist Party,
or the Danish Social Democrats.

Even more importantly, [nationalism is not just a **political
ideology**]{.underline}, [it is also a **social practice** that is
**integral** to many activities and processes present in a **variety**
of social organizations and outlets of everyday life]{.underline}. For
example, [nationalist practices are often promoted by **religious
organizations**]{.underline} (i.e. Serbian Orthodox Church, evangelical
Christian movements in the US, or the Jewish Home organization in
Israel.) Nationalist ideas can also underpin **[civil society
activities]{.underline}** (from ethnic minority NGOs and cultural
heritage associations, to national sport societies such as the GAA in
Ireland and Basque pelota clubs), **[private corporations]{.underline}**
(from selling distinct national products such as BMW and Guinness, to
promoting national tourist destinations such as the Taj Mahal or Hagia
Sophia), [and different **social institutions**]{.underline} (such as
masonic lodges, veterans' associations, or even nursing homes.)

[Nation-centric practices are also **integral** to everyday life and
habitual interactions]{.underline} between friends, family members,
neighbors, peers, and clan and kinship-based groups. For example,
wedding celebrations in the Balkans are often accompanied by patriotic
songs and the waving of national flags, while in Denmark birthday
parties regularly feature Danish national symbols, such as the
Danneborg. The intimacy of friendship is also often interwoven with the
shared experience of fervent cheering for one's national teams in
various sporting competitions. In this sense, [nationalism has become a
meta-ideological doctrine and social practice that
**infuses**]{.underline} many aspects of [everyday life]{.underline} in
the contemporary world. Hence to better understand this complex
phenomenon, it is necessary to explore these many faces of nationalism.

Economic and political development in Alaska were the initial areas to
find new directions in the first four decades of the twenti-eth
century[. Yet as development progressed, the contradictions be-tween the
promise of American democracy and its reality became painfully apparent
with the treatment of Native Alaskans. Alaska's towns and harbors
expanded in the years leading up to and follow-ing World War
I.]{.underline} Fairbanks was established in 1901. In 1914, An-chorage
was initially a landing site for supplies to build the Alaska Railroad.
Completed between 1915 and 1923, the new railroad linked the port of
Seward on the south coast with Fairbanks, more than three hundred miles
north.20 [As more settlers moved to Alaska, they came into contact with
the majority of the Indigenous population.]{.underline} By the end of
World War I, many of the legal categori-zations that had existed
previously, and had protected some people, were no longer recognized.
Children attended schools operated by the Bureau of Indian Affairs or
churches run on its behalf, and many schools exhibited an intolerance
for Native cultures and be-liefs, including abusive tendencies, as
existed in the rest of the United States. The Nelson Act of 1905 allowed
for exclusively white schools. [After World War I ended, the anti-Native
prejudice prevailed.21At the turn of the century, efforts at
organization and advocacy emerged within the Indigenous community,
although politics were not the original intent of the most prominent
among them. Formed in 1912 by Tlingit and Haida Indians, the Alaska
Native Brotherhood (ANB) and its auxiliary, the Alaska Native Sisterhood
(ANS), sought to educate and acculturate Alaska Natives as well as
advance the social and political interests of the territory's Eskimos,
Aleuts, and other Native Americans.]{.underline}22 The early leadership
of the organizations made advocacy for Native rights and legitimacy
their priority. In the interwar period, the Alaska Native Brotherhood
targeted issues connected to the fish trap as a unifying issue for the
pursuit of Native interests. [In 1921, their leader, William Paul, went
to Washington to testify on the issue and was elected to the territorial
legislature in 1924]{.underline}---the year all Native Americans were
granted citizenship. [The advance of the Alaska Native Brother-hood's
work in the 1920s and Paul's leadership is significant be-cause it
marked the first time that a Native Alaskan made their own case, on
their own behalf, to the federal government.23]{.underline}In the years
that followed, [the groups faced considerable opposition---particularly
with respect to extending citizenship and the franchise to Indians in
Alaska]{.underline}.24 [They also faced obstacles re-lated to the
original terms of the Alaska accession.]{.underline} For example, in
1934, [Congress passed the Indian Reorganization Act, which rec-ognized
the right of Indians to self-determination. The act also in-cluded a
fund for Indian business. However, the act excluded Alaska because there
had been no treaties or reservations there]{.underline}.[25The Alaska
Native Brotherhood worked with the Interior Depart-ment and Bureau of
Indian Affairs officials, as well as Alaska's new delegate to Congress,
to fashion legislation that would bring the act to Alaska and remedy the
discrepancy.]{.underline} In 1936, the Franklin D. Roosevelt
administration passed the [Alaska Reorganization Act]{.underline}, which
did so, albeit with some modifications.26

**Saying Western imperialism is the root of all evil sanctions violence

Postcolonialism added to this critique its own universal based on
Orientalist criticism: **[Western imperialism is always to
blame]{.underline}**. As Edward Rothstein opined in the New York Times,
[any act against the West by a postcolonial power cannot be viewed as
anything but a **reaction** to a previous imperial act by the West. We
cannot]{.underline} then [condemn the World Trade Center attack, since
Western hegemonic behavior is the]{.underline} fundamental [cause of
terrorism, and the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}, against which
this act was directed, [is the most powerful Western hegemonic
power]{.underline}. The rhetoric of postcolonialism and its call for
[the rule of relativism enabled us to **blame the victim** and **justify
terror**]{.underline}. Rothstein, a mere journalist, questioned whether
such relativism should play any role in the face of destruction that
called for a \"transcendent ethical perspective\" (Rothstein 2001). We,
as readers of recent literary criticism, are usually far removed from
such moral concerns. In fact, we might even find the logic in play here
commonplace and conventional. What could be a more disturbing indictment
of the state of theory today?

The [Occidentalist rhetoric]{.underline} exhibited in these responses
reflects the school of thought that [views the **U**nited **S**tates as
the **source of all evils**]{.underline} ([from the price of beef in
France to AIDS in Africa]{.underline}). This world vision offers certain
advantages. For one, [it allows some countries **to avoid accepting
responsibility for their actions**]{.underline} (Revel 2003:61). [By
attributing **all moral failings** and **grotesque intellectual errors**
to the **U**nited **S**tates as the **monster scapegoat**]{.underline},
certain [nations can **absolve themselves** of their own moral errors
and mistakes. If America becomes **the Great Satan, all the little
Satans pale in comparison**. America can]{.underline} thus exist to
[console]{.underline} Europe and [the world for its own
failures]{.underline} (Revel 2003: 158---59) [among which we can count
its **complacency and**]{.underline} indulgent [**complicity
in**]{.underline} Communist and post-Communist
**[genocides]{.underline}**.

As a number of new imperial historians of Britain have stressed, these
scientists effectively strengthened the connections between
settler-originated constructions of race and metropolitan middle-class
constructions of other kinds of 'internal' social difference (Hall
1996; Hall and Rose 2006). In Hunt's view, the brain of the 'Negro' was
much like that of the European woman or child, and in the view of many
contemporaries, both shared certain characteristics with those of
criminals, Celts and the labouring poor, none of whom were
differentiated through their relations with nature in a metropolitan
context (Bolt 1971). Long-held settler representations, such as those
that were reformulated for metropolitan consumption by Knox and Hunt,
became more powerful in Britain because they articulated a language of
inherent difference in which the relations of British class and gender
could now be more conveniently framed. They helped establish, as Ann
Stoler puts it, 'a "mobile" discourse of empire that designated
eligibility for citizenship, class membership, and gendered assignments
to race' (Stoler 1995, 127--8).

Although, as I have argued, both Anderson and I emphasise in practice
those sets of relations on colonial frontiers that gave rise to racial
discursive shifts in the nineteenth century, there are important
postcolonial questions hinging on the distinction between the different
kind of discursive relations that Anderson emphasises, and those that I
have tried to track above.

Anderson argues that

it is not an issue of extending humanity to ... negatively racialised
people, but of putting into question that from which such people have
been excluded -- that which, for liberal discourse, remains
unproblematised. (2007, 199)

I fear, however, that if we direct attention away from histories of
humanism's failure to deal with difference and to render that difference
compatible with its fundamental universalism, and if we overlook its
proponents' failed attempts to combat dispossession, murder and
oppression; if our history of race is instead understood through a
critique of humanity's conceptual separation from nature, we dilute the
political potency of universalism.

[Historically, it was not humanism that gave rise to racial innatism, it
was the specifically anti-humanist politics of settlers forging new
social assemblages through relations of violence on colonial frontiers.
**Settler communities became established social assemblages in their own
right specifically through the rejection of humanist interventions.**
Perhaps, as Edward Said suggested]{.underline}, [we can learn from the
implementation of humanist universalism in practice, and insist on
its *potential* to combat racism, and perhaps we]{.underline} can insist
on the contemporary conceptual hybridisation of human--non-human
entities too[, without necessarily abandoning all the precepts of
humanism]{.underline} (Said 2004; Todorov 2002). [We do not necessarily
need to accord a specific value to the human, separate from and above
nature, in order to make a moral and political case for a fundamental
human universalism that can be wielded strategically against racial
violence.]{.underline}

[Nineteenth century humanitarians' universalism was fundamentally
**conditioned by** their belief that British culture stood at the apex
of a hierarchical order of civilisations. From the mid-nineteenth
century through to the mid-twentieth century, this ethnocentrism
produced what Lyotard describes as 'the flattening of differences, or
the demand for a norm ("human nature")']{.underline}, that 'carries with
it its own forms of terror' (cited Braun 2004, 1352). The intervention
of Aboriginal Protection demonstrates that humanist universalism has the
potential to inflict such terror (it was the Protectorate of Aborigines
Office reincarnated that was responsible, later in the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries, for Aboriginal Australia's Stolen Generation, and
it was the assimilationist vision of the Protectors' equivalents in
Canada that led to the abuses of the Residential Schools system). But we
must not forget that humanism's alternatives, founded upon principles of
difference rather than commonality, have the potential to do the same
and even worse.

In the nineteenth century, Caribbean planters and then emigrant British
settlers emphasised the multiplicity of the human species, the absence
of any universal 'human nature', the incorrigibility of difference, in
their upholding of biological determinism. Their assault on any notion
of a fundamental commonality among human beings has disconcerting points
of intersection with the radical critique of humanism today. The
scientific argument of the nineteenth century that came closest to
post-humanism's insistence on the hybridity of humanity, promising to
'close the ontological gap between human and non-human animals' (Day
2008, 49), was the evolutionary theory of biological descent associated
with Darwin, and yet this theory was adopted in Aotearoa New Zealand and
other colonial sites precisely to legitimate the potential extinction of
other, 'weaker' races in the face of British colonisation on the grounds
of the natural law of a struggle for survival (Stenhouse 1999).

Both the upholding and the rejection of human--nature binaries can thus
result in racially oppressive actions, depending on the contingent
politics of specific social assemblages. Nineteenth century colonial
humanitarians, inspired as they were by an irredeemably ethnocentric and
religiously exclusive form of universalism, at least combatted
exterminatory settler discourses and practices at multiple sites of
empire, and provided spaces on mission and protectorate stations in
which indigenous peoples could be shielded to a very limited extent from
dispossession and murder. They also, unintentionally, reproduced
discourses of a civilising mission and of a universal humanity that
could be deployed by anticolonial nationalists in other sites of empire
that were never invaded to the same extent by settlers, in independence
struggles from the mid-twentieth century. Finally, as Whatmore's
(2002) analysis of the Select Committee on Aborigines reveals, they
provided juridical narratives that are part of the arsenal of weapons
that indigenous peoples can wield in attempts to claim redress and
recompense in a postcolonial world.

[The politics of humanism in practice]{.underline}, [then, was riddled
with contradiction, fraught with particularity and latent with varying
possibilities. It could be *relatively* progressive and liberatory; it
could be dispossessive and culturally genocidal.]{.underline} Within its
repertoire lay potential to combat environmental and biological
determinism and innatism, however, and this should not be forgotten in a
rush to condemn humanism's universalism as well as its anthropocentrism.
It is in the tensions within universalism that the ongoing potential of
an always provisional, self-conscious, flexible and strategic humanism
-- one that now recognises the continuity between the human and the
non-human as well as the power-laden particularities of the male, middle
class, Western human subject -- resides.

In her appraisal of Anderson's work, Nash points to an urgent
contemporary political imperative, concerning the human genome project.
The project provides a resource for strengthening post-humanism's
critique of anthropocentrism, since it has 'confounded ideas of human
genetic distinctiveness and sophistication relative to other animals' by
finding a smaller specifically human genome than expected' (Nash 2008,
465). However, and as in the early nineteenth century, it is not so much
our understanding of human--non-human relations that matters in the
construction of race, but the political uses of the genome project's
findings about variability among humans. As Nash points out,

the narrative of shared human origins 'out of Africa' and accounts of
the genetic unity of humanity are accompanied by a new insistent focus
on the small amount of genetic variation within humanity. The thrust of
this is to supplement the study of the human genome in general with the
study of human genome variation. Most problematically and most
controversially, much of this work is focused on exploring human genetic
variation between those located in the broad conventional categories of
race, or uses racial or ethnic groups in sampling and mapping global
human genetic diversity. So the move to declare the redundancy of race
in light of new knowledge of the human genome has been swiftly followed
by a resurgence of interest in genetic differences between old
categories of race. (2008, 465)

Demarcations between human races thus continue, as a result of the
political entanglements of subordination, inclusion and exclusion,
regardless of evidence about human--nature boundaries. As Saldanha
recognises, given the material, phenotypical basis for ideas of race,
'when understood as an immanent process, it becomes clear that, though
contingent, race cannot be transcended, only understood and rearranged'
(2006, 9). If we are not to use the principle of human universalism,
stripped as far as possible in the light of colonial history of its
colonising prescriptions, to combat persistent innatist demarcations,
however, then what are we to use?

The legacy of humanism may be 'an obstacle, an ideology, a myth'
(Badmington 2004, 1344), and the notion of 'the human' may have to be
redefined contingently and strategically as a moral category rather than
a biological category discrete from the non-human,5 but it may be a
necessary political fiction, providing a resource for the construction
of a new cosmopolitanism (Mignolo 2000), or even, in Fanon's words, a
'new humanism' founded in human immanence rather than transcendence
(Alessandrini 2009; Fanon 1967, 7; Pithouse 2003; Murdoch 2004). We need
a universality of human worth without assuming a universality of either
human biology or culture, and perhaps the best way to achieve this
within a new cosmopolitan humanism is, as Saldanha puts it, not to
'eliminate' race (cf. Gilroy 2000), but to proliferate it -- to direct
its 'many energies''at multiplying racial differences so as to render
them joyfully cacophonic' (Saldanha 2006, 21). The universalism of what
Saldanha calls 'a thousand tiny races' (Saldanha 2006, 21) constituting
humanity may have to exist alongside, and in acknowledged tension with,
the deconstruction of the anthropocentrism that isolates all these races
from 'nature'.

**The 'human' is not collapsing, and posthumanism is conceptually
useless.**

Given that Braidotti remains firmly embedded in a poststructuralist
framework, it is far from clear why she wishes to hold on to the concept
of 'the subject'. Granted, owing to the Foucauldian presuppositions
underpinning her approach, [it makes sense]{.underline} for her [to
advocate a posthumanist]{.underline} and post-anthropocentric
[conception of]{.underline} '[subjectivity]{.underline}'. Indeed, as she
affirms, '\[b\]y "posthumanizing" subjectivity, it can be re-positioned
as a dynamic convergence phenomenon across the contradictions of
posthumanism and post-anthropocentrism'.240 Thus, subjectivity exists
within a spatiotemporally contingent field of tensions. More
specifically, '[posthuman subjectivity]{.underline}'241 can be conceived
of as 'a process of becoming in its own immanence and not in binary
oppositional terms'.242 It [is in a **permanent state of
flux**]{.underline}, and [its multilayered constitution does not follow
a binary, let alone monolithic, logic of functioning]{.underline}. At
the same time, it is irreducible to the 'Homo Universalis of
Humanism'243 and the 'Anthropos of anthropocentrism',244 since it is 'a
structural relational capacity'245 that defies the rigid logic of a
fixed sense of 'human nature' or 'human essence'. For Braidotti,
subjectivity is 'both post-personal and pre-individual',246 in that it
finds itself situated in a dynamic, and largely unpredictable, process
of 'constant negotiation with multiple others and immersed in the
conditions that it is trying to understand and modify, if not
overturn'.247 On this view, amo[ng the key features of human
subjectivity are malleability, negotiability, unpredictability,
multiplicity, contingency, and]{.underline} -- above all --
[relationality]{.underline}.

A noteworthy problem with this account of subjectivity, however, is
that, [despite its advocate's **nominally anti-essentialist stance**, it
**relies on effectively essentialist**]{.underline} -- or at least
quasi-essentialist -- **[assumptions about]{.underline}** the very
nature of **[what it means to be]{.underline}**
'**[human]{.underline}**'. For the aforementioned charac[teristics are
**constitutive elements of any human creature**]{.underline} -- that is,
they are traits that are inherent in our species-specific condition.

[This reflection takes us to]{.underline} Braidotti's conception of
'[the subject]{.underline}' [in general]{.underline} and her conception
of 'the posthuman subject' in particular. She maintains that
'\[p\]osthuman subjects are a work-in- progress'248 and that,
furthermore, 'they emerge as both a critical and a creative project
[within the posthuman convergence]{.underline} along posthumanist and
post-anthropocentric axes of interrogation'.249 One may legitimately
object, however, that at least the first part of this statement applies
not only to (post-)human but also to non-human subjects. [By definition,
all living beings are]{.underline} '[a work-in-progress]{.underline}',
[in]{.underline} the sense [that they are **constantly developing
and**]{.underline}, as spatiotemporally situated beings, [responding to
different, and incessantly evolving, environments and historical
circumstances]{.underline}.

This leads us to another issue, namely the question of 'we'. Who are
'we'?250 Braidotti claims that posthuman subjects 'explore the
multifaceted and differential nature of the collective "we"'.251 In
other words, the 'we' to which she is referring cannot be reduced to a
monolithic, let alone transcendental, entity; rather, given its
relational constitution, we are dealing with a multilayered and highly
differentiated form of 'we', whose posthuman constitution is indicative
of the posthuman era. According to Braidotti, '"\[w\]e" are in the
process of becoming posthumanist and post- anthropocentric'.252 We do so
as embodied and embedded selves, since 'we are deeply steeped in the
material world'253; and we do so as transversal selves, since 'we
connect \[with\] but also differ from each other'.254 Bonded by our
'ontological relationality',255 we are -- in vitalist terms --
'variations on a common matter'.256 Yet, paradoxically, 'we differ from
each other all the more as we co-define ourselves within the same living
matter -- environmentally, socially, and relationally'.257 [Just as we
share our ontological relationality with all other living beings, we
differ from each other due to our context-dependent
specificities]{.underline}.

One of the main problems with this approach, however, is that [the
notion of]{.underline} '[we]{.underline}' that lies at its core [is both
**vague** and **presumptuous**]{.underline}: it is vague because [it is
not clear whether it comprises all or only some living
beings]{.underline}; at the same time, [it is presumptuous because the
contention that we are all in the process of becoming
posthumanist]{.underline} and post-anthropocentric [is **far-fetched**.
If we include non-human agents]{.underline} in our definition of 'the
subject', then [the question arises whether all]{.underline} zoe-based
[beings]{.underline} (including animals, seeds, cells, and plants) --
and, indeed, all geo- and techno-based forms of existence -- [can be
included]{.underline} in this category. If the answer is 'yes', then we
are faced with an inflationary conception of 'the subject', which, owing
to its denotative elasticity, fails to do justice to the
species-constitutive distinctiveness of human life.

Of course, one may come to Braidotti's defence by insisting that one of
the principal aims of her project is to undo the boundaries between
different kinds of 'subject' and 'subjectivity' (notably 'human',
'inhuman', 'posthuman', and 'non-human') and that, in some instances,
the 'we' she envisages is more or less clearly defined.258 After all,
she urges us to 'think of ourselves as planetary subjects, rather than
as global agents'.259 Crucially, the types of subject she has in mind
include both 'the human and \[the\] inhuman inhabitants of this
planet'.260 [If]{.underline}, however, [we]{.underline} -- effectively
-- [include **every form of existence**]{.underline} (that is,
'[human']{.underline}, '[inhuman']{.underline},
'[posthuman']{.underline}, [and 'non-human']{.underline}) in our
definition of 'subject' and 'subjectivity', then [these terms **lose
conceptual force**, since, in an omni-onto-epistemological fashion,
**they refer to everything and nothing**]{.underline}.

[Even if]{.underline}, in a narrow sense, [we reserve the]{.underline}
concept of 'the [subject]{.underline}' [for members of our species, it
seems erroneous to assume that all human beings are]{.underline} going
through the process of [being converted into posthuman(ist)]{.underline}
and/or post-anthropocentric [actors]{.underline}. Ironically, the
intersectional divisions to which Braidotti rightly draws her readers'
attention are the very reason that -- to use a modified version of an
Orwellian aphorism -- some human actors are more (or less)
posthuman(ist) and/or post-anthropocentric than others. [Human actors
are **divided by key sociological variables**]{.underline} ([such as
class, ethnicity, gender, age, and 'ability']{.underline}). [Our
position in the world, including our access to socially relevant
resources, is **shaped by these variables**]{.underline}. Braidotti's
[critical theory]{.underline} of society [needs to emphasize the fact
that the degree to which actors have]{.underline} ([or have
not]{.underline}) [become posthuman(ist)]{.underline} and/or
post-anthropocentric [**depends on** the **social positions** they
occupy and the social dispositions they acquire within the social
universe. Otherwise, the]{.underline} bold [proposition that we have
been witnessing the rise of 'a new collective subject]{.underline}, a
"we-are-(all)-in-this-together-but-we-are-not-one-and-the- same" kind of
subject',261 [is **of merely rhetorical, rather than substantive,
relevance**]{.underline}.
