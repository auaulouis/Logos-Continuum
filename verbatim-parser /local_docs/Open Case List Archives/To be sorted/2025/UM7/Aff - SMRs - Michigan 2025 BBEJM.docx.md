[**[Under]{.mark}** the [Arctic **ice** lies]{.mark} an **extremely
[carbon-rich]{.mark}** [environment]{.mark}]{.underline}. Over thousands
of years, plants in the Arctic have absorbed carbon dioxide (CO2) from
the air to grow, before being buried under snow and ice during the
winter, becoming part of the soil. If this perennially frozen ground
thaws---as it is now, as a result of climate change---ancient plants are
uncovered, alongside plant-eating microbes that break them down.

[This [releases]{.mark}]{.underline} two main climate-warming greenhouse
gases: [[**CO2**, and]{.underline}]{.mark} even more **[potent
[methane]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Seasonal thawing in the Arctic is normal. The region has very cold
winters and warmer summers. Every year, the top, "active layer" of soil
thaws and refreezes, exchanging methane and CO2 with the atmosphere. But
today, those methane and CO2 [[emissions]{.mark} have **greatly
[increased]{.mark}**[, as]{.mark} human-caused climate **[warming
causes]{.mark}** the [**active layer** to grow
deeper]{.mark}]{.underline} and deeper, [[digging into]{.mark} the
"**[permafrost]{.mark}**" below]{.underline}. The Arctic is warming four
times faster than the world average,1 and as a direct result, methane
emissions from the Boreal-Arctic region (which includes the Arctic as
well as some areas a bit further south) have increased by 9 percent
since 2002.2 Some areas have become an annual CO2 source, meaning more
CO2 is released during the year than plants can absorb during the short
summers.

[The [**scale** of]{.mark} these [emissions is **so large**]{.mark} that
[they]{.mark} are likely [to]{.mark} create a **[feedback
loop]{.mark}**]{.underline}, says Kyle Arndt, a research scientist
focused on the Arctic at the Woodwell Climate Research Center. The extra
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will [[make]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[planet **warm faster**]{.mark}, which then [causes]{.mark} more of the
[**Arctic** to **thaw**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

But this feedback loop is not like an "on or off" switch, which, once
flipped, will eventually release all the carbon buried in the Arctic.
It's more like a dimmer switch, where every fraction of a degree the
planet warms causes more permafrost to thaw. And that means that
everything we do to reduce warming---by choosing clean transportation
and electricity, for instance, instead of those run on climate-warming
fossil fuels---will keep more permafrost stable and frozen. "Any amount
of reduced, human-caused emissions that we can do means reduced
emissions from the Arctic," says Arndt.

Exactly how much methane release we can prevent is hard to say.
Scientists understand very well how methane is released from the Arctic,
but they are still working out how fast it may happen. Thawing into the
permafrost "is on a one-way trajectory right now," says Arndt. "We do
expect to lose a good amount of the permafrost area by the end of the
century due to warming."

Arndt says this [**thawing [permafrost]{.mark}** is often [**not
accounted** for in **global**]{.mark} **climate
[models]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which means climate plans based on these
models may underestimate future warming. Scientists are also working to
better understand a phenomenon called "**[[abrupt]{.mark}
thaw]{.underline}**," where [[permafrost thaws]{.mark} **very
[quickly]{.mark}**]{.underline}. That [[leads to]{.mark} **landslides**
and [ground **collapse**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as ice suddenly turns to
water, [[releasing **large**]{.mark} **amounts** of **[methane]{.mark}**
suddenly]{.underline}. Arndt says scientists still can't predict how
much this will happen or exactly where.

But we can be sure that, if we do nothing more to halt climate change,
the [**[Arctic]{.mark}** will become a **gigantic** source of
**g**reen**h**ouse **g**ases]{.underline} over the next century, says
Arndt. At current rates of warming, the region, which includes part of
Russia, Greenland, Canada, Scandinavian countries, and Alaska, [is [on
**pace** to **contribute**]{.mark} as much [**methane** and
**CO2**]{.mark} to the atmosphere [as a **large**, **industrialized**
country]{.mark}]{.underline}.3

#### Black carbon in the Arctic is [especially detrimental]{.underline} to global warming -- the tipping point is [now]{.underline}. 

Dr Sian **Prior'3-31** - Lead Adviser to the Clean Arctic Alliance with
over 25 years of experience (\"Black Carbon and the Arctic: What is
Happening, and What Comes Next?\", Clean Arctic Alliance,
https://cleanarctic.org/2025/03/31/black-carbon-and-the-arctic-what-is-happening-and-what-comes-next/,
3-31-2025, Accessed 6-28-2025)//Ilake-EO

The [Arctic]{.underline} is [warming **four times faster**
than]{.underline} the [rest of the planet]{.underline}, and rapidly
[approaching the point where]{.underline} such as the [**loss of sea
ice** and melting of the Greenland ice sheet, are affecting ocean
circulation patterns in the North Atlantic.]{.underline}

[**Black carbon** is solid particulate matter]{.underline} -- which we
call soot -- [produced by]{.underline} the [incomplete burning of fossil
fuels in]{.underline} the [engine combustion chambers]{.underline} and
[then ejected into the]{.underline} [atmosphere]{.underline}. This [soot
absorbs sunlight and]{.underline} by [warm]{.underline}ing the
[surrounding atmosphere]{.underline} [becomes a]{.underline} powerful
short-lived climate pollutant, aka **[super pollutant]{.underline}**.
Although black carbon is not a greenhouse gas, these [emissions form
"shipping's second largest **cause of global warming**]{.underline}"
after carbon dioxide, and makes up around one-fifth of international
shipping's already considerable climate impact.

Overall, [black carbon contributes more than **three thousand times**
the climate warming impact of]{.underline} the same mass of [CO2
i]{.underline}n the atmosphere over a 20 year period. In its recent 6th
Assessment Report, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
[(IPCC) doubled]{.underline} the [estimate of the warming potential of
black carbon on **snow and ice**]{.underline} compared with the 5th
Assessment Report due to a better understanding of its impact on snow
forcing.

After they are emitted from ship exhausts, black carbon particles are
suspended in the atmosphere, where they absorb heat from the sun.
[When]{.underline} the [particles fall to]{.underline} earth -- or in
this case, [the Arctic]{.underline}, this black soot falls onto white
ice or snow, where [it lowers the]{.underline} reflectivity -- or
[albedo]{.underline}, [causing a **detrimental absorption**
of]{.underline} more [heat and]{.underline} thus **[accelerates
melting]{.underline}**. The **[feedback loop]{.underline}**
[continues]{.underline} [when the snow or ice melts]{.underline},
exposing darker areas of land and water which absorb further heat from
the sun, thus [reducing the reflective capacity of the planet's polar
ice cap.]{.underline}

[More heat in the polar systems equals **increased
melting**]{.underline}. While this seems obvious, scientists are seeing
ever more clearly the alarming consequences.. [Declines in sea ice
extent and volume]{.underline} are [lead]{.underline}ing
[to]{.underline} a burgeoning [social and environmental
crisis]{.underline} in the Arctic, while cascading changes are impacting
global climate and ocean circulation. [Scientists have]{.underline}
[high confidence]{.underline} that [processes]{.underline} are [nearing
points beyond]{.underline} which [**rapid and irreversible changes**
with serious implications for humanity]{.underline}, and research shows
[within the next decade]{.underline} we will start to [see periods when
no Arctic summer sea ice is formed]{.underline}, and that "[preparations
need to be made for]{.underline} the [increased **extreme weather**
across the northern hemisphere]{.underline} that is likely to occur as a
result."

[One of the **[biggest]{.mark} remaining
[unknowns]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in modeling]{.underline}]{.mark} the
effects of [climate change [is]{.mark} the]{.underline} impact of
[**thawing [permafrost]{.mark}** in the Arctic]{.underline} region,
[[which]{.mark} could [unleash **large quantities** of]{.mark}
climate-**warming [methane]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While this has been
known for decades, [[there is **so much**
uncertainty]{.underline}]{.mark} about the details [[that]{.mark}
present **climate [models]{.mark}** [do not include]{.mark} this effect
-- [and]{.mark} thus could be **seriously [underestimating]{.mark}** the
**[rate]{.mark}** of global warming, [and]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[**[intensity]{.mark}** of measures]{.underline} needed to control it.

Experts spoke about this issue in a June 11 Harvard Climate Action Week
panel moderated by Henry Lee, the Jassim M. Jaidah Family Director of
the Environment and Natural Resources Program with the Belfer Center at
Harvard Kennedy School. To open the discussion, Lee asked the panel "Why
should anyone living in the temperate areas in our planet worry about
permafrost thaw in the Arctic?"

John Holdren, former co-director of the Office of Science and Technology
Policy in the Obama administration and now a research professor at
Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, answered that "one
reason is that it is the emissions from society's activities in the
temperate regions, above all, that are driving global climate change.
And global climate change is happening three to four times faster in the
Arctic than in the world on average. And if the world doesn't slow down
its emissions at a greater rate that is happening today, all that is
going to get worse."

What's more, Holdren added, "[there are **[feedbacks]{.mark}** from it
getting **worse faster** in the Arctic, which]{.underline} in turn [will
[**accelerate** climate]{.mark} change [worldwide]{.mark}]{.underline}."
The [[feedbacks]{.mark} [have]{.mark} to do with **[vast
amounts]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- the [exact [extent]{.mark} of [which
are **unknown**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [of **[methane]{.mark}** gas
that [is **frozen** into]{.mark} the **Arctic [permafrost]{.mark}**.
As]{.underline} the global climate warms up, [this permafrost [**thaws**
and releases]{.mark}]{.underline}, in addition to [**[carbon]{.mark}**
dioxide, **[methane]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a potent if short-lived
greenhouse gas. [This [causes]{.mark} even **more [warming]{.mark}**,
thus **[thawing more]{.mark}** permafrost [and **releasing**]{.mark}
**even [more]{.mark}** methane, and **so on**]{.underline}.

key to our planet's survival,"
https://www.weforum.org/stories/2019/01/4-reasons-why-the-arctic-is-key-to-our-planets-survival/\]

While our planet contains five oceans - the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian,
Arctic and Southern (Antarctic) - it is the [Arctic Ocean]{.underline}
that [is]{.underline} **[most susceptible]{.underline}** [to climate
change]{.underline}. In fact these changes are happening in front of our
eyes; we have lost over half the Arctic summer sea ice already.

There are four reasons why [the]{.underline} **[[Arctic]{.mark}
Ocean]{.underline}** [is]{.underline} [distinct]{.mark} from other
oceans and [**[critical]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}
]{.mark}[our]{.underline} **[planet's [survival]{.mark}]{.underline}**:

First, while this relatively small (by ocean standards) marine
environment holds only 1% of the world's ocean volume and occupies only
3% of the world's ocean surface area, [its [impact on]{.mark}
the]{.underline} **[global [climate]{.mark} system]{.underline}**
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} **[disproportionately]{.underline}**
[[large]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Second, though small in area, [it scoops up over]{.underline}
**[10%]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} global [river runoff and claims
twenty of the world's 100 longest rivers]{.underline}.

Third, [the Arctic marine domain comprises about a]{.underline}
**[third]{.underline}** [of the world's coastline]{.underline}.

And fourth, [the Arctic Ocean contains]{.underline}
**[one-quarter]{.underline}** [of the world's continental shelf,
of]{.underline} **[immense]{.underline}** [socio-ecological
importance]{.underline}.

On all counts, the little Arctic Ocean holds its own on the global
stage.

Despite its importance, the Arctic Ocean sometimes goes missing from
public ocean-talk as more 'local' marine issues take centre stage. A key
point for non-experts is to recognize that the [[Arctic]{.mark} Ocean
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} different from other oceans and it is
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} **[critical [driver]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[of the]{.mark} global]{.underline} **[[oceanic conveyor
belt]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For example, [the [**Gulf Stream** and
**North Atlantic Current**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} strongly [[regulated by]{.underline}]{.mark}
processes that occur in [the [Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Arctic
Ocean is remote to many of us, but its influence can be felt everywhere.

How do we know this? [Oceanographers have robust]{.underline}
**[scientific evidence]{.underline}** [on the role the Arctic plays
within our planet]{.underline}. For instance, the global hydrological
cycle determines the distribution of water around the planet -- and
affects food and water security globally. This cycle begins in warmer
climates, with the equatorial trade winds and mid-latitude westerlies.
It is refined and shaped by the global distribution of land masses that,
in the northern hemisphere, collect precipitation and direct it poleward
through massive rivers. These [rivers introduce]{.underline} substantial
amounts of [fresh water into the]{.underline} upper layers of the
[Arctic Ocean]{.underline}, providing the required conditions for an ice
cover to form, and [[regulating]{.underline}
**[nutrient]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[supplies]{.underline}**
[[and]{.underline} **[biological productivity]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

But [these dynamics are undergoing]{.underline}
**[unprecedented]{.underline}** and worrying [changes]{.underline} that
are already visible. Jonathan Smith, producer of Blue Planet II,
reflected on the new realities of filming in the Arctic Ocean: "We were
all set and ready to film but we needed two major things -- walrus and
ice. I had expected that walrus may be hard to find, but I did not
expect it to be hard to find ice in the Arctic.... the crew were all
commenting how surprisingly warm it was." They were not mistaken. Over
many years, scientists have been recording changes in global
temperature, hydrological cycles and sea-ice cover. These changes have
all had significant and eminently observable effects on the Arctic
Ocean. Over the past two decades alone, [summer sea-ice
coverage]{.underline} in the Arctic Ocean has [decreased by]{.underline}
about **[seven million]{.underline}** [square kilometres to
just]{.underline} over **[3 million]{.underline}** [square
kilometres]{.underline}. This loss represents a surface area larger than
all but about a dozen countries in the world.

However, [the [Arctic]{.mark} Ocean]{.underline} is not just a passive
victim of anthropogenic change: it also [[drives]{.underline}
**[disruptions]{.underline}** [back to the]{.underline} **[global
system]{.underline}**]{.mark} in ways that were overlooked even a decade
ago. Though the exact mechanisms are still debated, [Arctic sea-[ice
loss]{.mark}]{.underline} may be [[affect]{.underline}]{.mark}ing both
[ocean]{.underline} **[[currents]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} mid-latitude **[[weather]{.mark}
patterns]{.underline}** along our southern borders. And the processes
occurring in the Arctic play a vital role in connecting the Pacific and
the Atlantic. The fabled Northwest Passage is more than a destination
for explorers and commercial ship traffic; [the Arctic is an
oceanographic freight train that]{.underline} **[ties
together]{.underline}** [and influences other maritime regions and the
global **climate system**]{.underline}.

Worryingly [there are big [changes in Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}
sea[-[ice]{.mark} cover]{.underline}, **[freshwater
supply]{.underline}**, **[nutrient]{.underline}** [availability
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[underwater]{.underline}** light
**[[climate]{.underline}]{.mark}** which are [taking place at
an]{.underline} [**accelerated pace**, [with]{.mark} associated [shifts
in]{.mark}]{.underline} **[seawater [chemistry]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} [**biological activity**, and alterations
to]{.underline} [**[habitat]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[food-web]{.underline}**]{.mark} [structure that are
[affect]{.mark}ing [the]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[entire
ocean]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [Ocean [waters are
growing]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**more acidic**]{.mark}, and]{.underline}
**[[oxygen]{.mark} concentrations]{.underline}** have [decreased by
nearly]{.underline} **[8%]{.underline}** over the past 50 years alone.
From this perspective, it seems inevitable that the ongoing and rapid
[changes in the]{.underline} physical environment of the marine [Arctic
[will push]{.mark} existing]{.underline} [socio-[ecological
systems]{.mark}]{.underline} - small and large - **[[beyond tipping
points]{.underline}]{.mark}** and into new regimes.

What this means is that [temperature, pH and oxygen changes [lead
to]{.mark}]{.underline} [**species [extinctions]{.mark}**[, threatening
**fisheries** and **food security**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In addition,
the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently issued a
new report card on the health of the Arctic ocean, which conlduded: "The
report card calls marine microplastics an 'emerging threat' in the
Arctic, and it notes that a recent global survey shows that the Arctic
Ocean has higher concentrations of microplastics than any other ocean
basin in the world." When German scientists found 11,000 particles of
microplastic in one litre of melted sea ice from the remote Arctic,
everyone began to understand how widespread and serious this is.
Unbelievable as it may sound, the plastic soup has now reached Arctic
waters.

#### Arctic SMR deployment is key to arctic sustainability.

https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/energysource/expanding-nuclear-energy-to-the-arctic-the-potential-of-small-modular-reactors/\]

With increased emphasis on achieving political and technological
solutions to climate change, many **[experts]{.underline}** in the
global community [are turning]{.underline} their focus [to]{.underline}
the virtually **[emissions-free]{.underline}** [power produced
by]{.underline} **[nuclear]{.underline}** [reactors]{.underline}. The
continued development of small modular reactors (**[SMRs]{.underline}**)
[offers]{.underline} a [potential]{.underline} opportunity [to
overcome]{.underline} many of the [hindrances presented by]{.underline}
**[larger]{.underline}** nuclear power [plants, including]{.underline}
high **[costs]{.underline}**, [complex]{.underline} [**supply chains**,
large]{.underline} physical [**infrastructure**, and]{.underline}
**[unsuitability]{.underline}** [in harsh]{.underline}
[**environments**, such as the]{.underline} **[Arctic]{.underline}**.
The Biden Administration and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson have both
signaled that SMRs have a key role in combatting carbon emissions and
meeting increased energy demand. More recently, several Canadian
provincial governments have joined forces with private corporations to
conduct feasibility studies for the deployment of SMRs in the far north.
**[SMRs]{.underline}** [present a]{.underline} **[vital]{.underline}**
[opportunity for]{.underline} **[energy]{.underline}** [production in
the Arctic, where energy]{.underline} **[needs]{.underline}**
[are]{.underline} **[more demanding]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[difficult]{.underline}** to meet [due to]{.underline} the region's
[**low temperatures**, low]{.underline} **[population]{.underline}**
density, [and]{.underline} **[inaccessibility]{.underline}**. While
other energy sources such as natural [gas and oil are]{.underline}
abundant in the Arctic, their exploitation is [not]{.underline}
**[sustainable]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} often [comes at
a]{.underline} **[high cost]{.underline}** to local communities and the
environment. While nuclear energy is not a new technology, recent
advancements like SMRs present a promising solution to challenges
associated with traditional nuclear power and fossil fuels, as well as
along with high-polluting diesel generators used in the Arctic.

Arctic nations have explored the viability of nuclear energy production
in the region for years. Despite high electricity production
capabilities, [traditional nuclear]{.underline} power plants [entail
**complicated**]{.underline} waste disposal [operations and
have]{.underline} more recently [come under]{.underline} increased
**[scrutiny]{.underline}** over safety concerns and broader public
perception issues, especially in Europe. In contrast, [SMRs
are]{.underline} **[smaller]{.underline}**, [easily deployed
in]{.underline} almost [**any environment**, and feature]{.underline}
**[extensive]{.underline}** [passive]{.underline} [**safety features**.
They also use a set design framework and have extended]{.underline}
[**fuel cycles**, which reduces]{.underline}
**[challenges]{.underline}** [associated with]{.underline}
**[spent]{.underline}** nuclear **[fuel]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[lowers]{.underline}** the [likelihood of]{.underline}
**[radiation]{.underline}** escaping containment.

[The Arctic]{.underline} currently [suffers from a]{.underline}
**[dearth]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} **[renewable]{.underline}**
[electricity generation, despite]{.underline} **[copious
opportunities]{.underline}**. Roughly **[half]{.underline}** [of
the]{.underline} [Arctic's populations live in]{.underline} [**remote
locations**, requiring]{.underline} **[off-grid]{.underline}**
[systems]{.underline}; consequently, approximately 80 percent of Arctic
communities depend exclusively on diesel generators for electricity.
Despite the region's abundance of natural resources, most diesel [fuel
is]{.underline} [**imported**, threatening]{.underline} **[energy
security]{.underline}** [with]{.underline} both increased
**[costs]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} the likelihood of
**[shortages]{.underline}**. While wind, solar, and hydropower are also
viable green alternatives to fossil fuels, each comes with its own
disadvantages in comparison to SMRs. **[Wind]{.underline}** [turbines
are]{.underline} **[not]{.underline}** yet [adapted to]{.underline} the
**[harsh]{.underline}** [Arctic **conditions**]{.underline} [with
persistent temperatures below]{.underline} -- **[forty
degrees]{.underline}** [Celsius]{.underline}. They likewise carry an
environmental impact related to land use and interference with wildlife,
especially migratory birds. **[Solar]{.underline}** energy systems also
[require]{.underline} **[extensive land]{.underline}** to reach higher
levels of production, [and]{.underline} their [effectiveness
is]{.underline} **[limited]{.underline}** [in the Arctic]{.underline}
[**winter**. Hydropower requires]{.underline} **[large]{.underline}**
[initial investments and may have]{.underline} **[severe]{.underline}**
[environmental impacts]{.underline}, especially if a large storage lake
is necessary. [SMRs can]{.underline} **[overcome]{.underline}** all
[these challenges given their]{.underline} **[low]{.underline}**
[start-up]{.underline} [**costs**, use of]{.underline}
**[uranium]{.underline}** ([which is]{.underline}
**[abundant]{.underline}** [in the Arctic), and]{.underline}
**[minor]{.underline}** environmental **[footprint]{.underline}**.

Nevertheless, installing SMRs in the Arctic comes with its own set of
unique challenges. SMRs for commercial use are currently restricted by
regulatory regimes that are far more accustomed to licensing
conventional nuclear power plants. [SMRs]{.underline} also generate less
power than conventional nuclear plants and require a connection to the
electrical grid to transport electricity from the reactor to the
end-user. However, they [can be deployed on the sites of **retiring**
coal]{.underline} [or diesel-fired power **plants**]{.underline}. For
example, in the Canadian North, diesel plants serve many communities in
Nunavut. Yet thirteen out of seventeen are at the end of their usable
lives. **[Closing]{.underline}** [these plants and installing
SMRs]{.underline} that can take advantage of existing switchyards and
turbines [have the potential to **reduce**]{.underline} initial
**[costs]{.underline}**, [which could]{.underline} in turn [be used to
**expand**]{.underline} [the]{.underline} electrical [grid
to]{.underline} more **[remote]{.underline}** [settlements]{.underline}.

As a result of the 2019 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the
Pentagon initiated Project Pele which commissioned two companies to
design SMRs for its remote operating bases. The research and development
project required the companies design and build a one to five megawatt
reactor that can last at least three years and be rapidly redeployed and
removed. The project---under which BWXT Advanced Technologies and
X-Energy will develop prototypes to be evaluated by the Pentagon---has
the potential to pave the way toward the adoption of transportable
microreactors critical to supplying clean, affordable power to remote
communities with limited access to an electrical grid. The Pentagon
plans to make a full evaluation in 2022 to determine whether to proceed
to limited production.

Humans living in the Arctic have in recent centuries built their
residences, businesses, and other infrastructure atop permafrost, which
served as a sort of perpetual foundation. Now, [[as climate change
proceeds, permafrost is collapsing]{.mark} across the North, destroying
water systems, roads, buildings, and pipelines and leading to
contamination of areas humans use. [Permafrost collapse generates new
lakes that can join up with surface streams and carry microbes into the
ocean]{.mark}]{.underline}. Open-pit mines, eroded bluffs, and sinkholes
expose ancient organic matter. In addition to bacteria and viruses,
fungi, lichens, and even nematode worms have been revived from
permafrost. [So while there is some reason to avoid panic about zombie
microbes, [humans]{.mark} do [face]{.mark} the [possibility of meeting
up with the vast, newly exposed microbial storehouse released from
permafrost]{.mark}.]{.underline} Potential pathogens could move into and
out of the Arctic in multiple ways. [[Ships' ballast water transports
invasive species]{.underline}, [including microbes.]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[Animal carriers]{.mark},]{.underline} especially rodents like beaver,
rats and rabbits, bring southern pathogens like giardia, rabies,
toxoplasmosis, and hantavirus northward, while marine mammals and birds
migrate great distances north and south, [[traversing the Arctic,
Pacific and Atlantic oceans distributing bacteria]{.underline}]{.mark},
viruses and fungi. [And as resource extraction rises, more workers move
between weeks-long shifts in the Arctic to urban areas in more southerly
regions, often using air transport.]{.underline} [[Mora compared]{.mark}
several [centuries']{.mark} worth [of climate change data]{.mark} with a

that]{.mark}]{.underline} [[climate influences infectious

between disease and person," he says. This happens where people are
forced to migrate into new environments because of "hurricanes, floods,
and heat waves." Also, Mora found, [[pathogens can become

survive year-round and [disasters degrade]{.mark} both [public

#### SCENARIO 2\-\--ENERGY TRANSITION:

#### SMR's are the [future of nuclear energy]{.underline} -- enabling [global transition]{.underline}.

[Nuclear energy]{.underline} stands [poised to serve as a **cornerstone
of the global transition** to a low-carbon future]{.underline}. Unlike
intermittent renewable sources such as wind and solar, [nuclear power
provides **reliable**, large-scale baseload electricity]{.underline}
[that can **stabilize energy grids** and complement clean energy
portfolios]{.underline}. Recent policy and industry developments
underscore this renewed momentum.

By 2050, nuclear energy capacity is expected to triple globally to meet
net-zero emissions targets, as pledged by 22 countries at COP28 in Dubai
in December 2023. Since the initial pledge at COP28, six additional
nations have joined the declaration at COP29 in November 2024. The
planned restart of the Palisades nuclear power plant in Michigan, which
was shut down in 2022, and Unit 1 of the Three Mile Island nuclear power
plant, which was not involved in the 1979 accident but was shut down in
2019 due to economic challenges, is expected by mid-2028. Reports
indicate that the Duane Arnold nuclear plant in Iowa, which ceased
operations in 2020, may also pursue a restart.

This unprecedented trend would mark the first time in U.S. history that
decommissioned [nuclear plants are]{.underline} brought back online,
[enabled by **federal and bipartisan** political support]{.underline}.
According to recent reports, due to the unexpectedly slow expansion of
renewable energy in Germany, [there is a vocal and growing movement to
restart]{.underline} some of the country's 11 shutdown [nuclear power
reactors]{.underline}.

Emerging nuclear technologies offer promising pathways for overcoming
many legacy challenges associated with traditional nuclear energy.
[Small modular reactors]{.underline} **[(SMRs)]{.underline}** promise to
[reduce costs,]{.underline} construction timelines and land use while
[enhanc]{.underline}ing [safety features through passive cooling and
underground containment]{.underline}. Additionally, advanced reactor
designs --- such as molten salt, gas-cooled and thorium-fueled systems
--- are being developed for greater efficiency and reduced waste
generation. [These innovations]{.underline} could **[revolutionize the
energy landscape]{.underline}** in the coming decades [by providing
nearly limitless, **carbon-free power** with minimal safety and waste
concerns]{.underline}.

### Solvency\-\--SMRs\-\--2AC

1\. Introduction

The [[Arctic]{.mark} region['s **socioeconomic diversity** and]{.mark}
**[varying]{.mark} [development]{.mark} strategies** among Arctic states
[underscore]{.mark} the [complexity of addressing climate
change]{.mark}]{.underline} challenges. [[Central to this]{.mark}
challenge [is]{.mark} the **[adoption of]{.mark} renewable** and
**[low-carbon energy]{.mark}** solutions]{.underline}, a transition
reliant on the presence of robust industrialisation and ground
infrastructure. However, [a critical [factor that complicates]{.mark}
this transition [is]{.mark} the [**off-grid nature** of]{.mark} many
[Arctic]{.mark} [communities]{.mark}.]{.underline}1 [Despite existing
challenges, there is **[growing interest]{.mark}** in renewable and
low-carbon energy]{.underline} within the Arctic region, [driven
by]{.underline} the [dual objectives [of achieving **economic savings**
and **safeguarding**]{.mark} **[the environment]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Recognising the pivotal role of local perspectives in the formulation of
sustainable energy policies, [it is essential to acknowledge the need to
tailor these policies to address the unique needs and circumstances of
Arctic communities.]{.underline} In this context, both renewable and
[**[nuclear energy solutions]{.mark}** are increasingly being considered
as [part of]{.mark} the transition towards [achieving **net-zero
emissions**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Applying the context of the energy
transition towards net-zero in Canada, this study examines how nuclear
energy development projects in the Arctic may affect the environment and
livelihoods of Arctic residents, mapping both the challenges and
opportunities associated with such initiatives.

[Small Modular Reactors (**[SMRs]{.mark}**]{.underline})
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} increasingly being [viewed as part of
**low-carbon energy transition** in a climate change [solution]{.mark},
especially [in **remote Arctic regions**]{.mark}]{.underline},2 [[where
they]{.mark} can [provide a **stable energy load**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
This article explores the role of SMRs as part of an energy transition,
using Canada as a case setting. Canada's proactive adoption of SMRs as a
component of its strategy for decarbonisation is substantiated by its
well-established nuclear supply chain complemented by robust technical
and production capabilities.3Significantly, Canada's relevance in the
Arctic context is underscored by its Indigenous population, comprising
First Nations, Métis, and Inuit communities. This study employs
qualitative data from public sources, including government publications,
Indigenous-led organisations' media, and webinar transcripts, to explore
stakeholder views on SMRs in Canada, particularly in the context of
Arctic energy transitions. It is essential to note that this research
aims to gauge publicly available vocal perspectives surrounding SMRs in
Canada, and not to speak on behalf of Indigenous communities.

### Solvency\-\--Arctic Black Carbon\-\--2AC

#### [Small modular reactors]{.underline} in the [Arctic]{.underline} are [key to]{.underline} mitigating the [impacts]{.underline} of black carbon. 

- This is the most sus card in the world

Thad W. **Allen et al'17** (Christine Todd Whitman, Esther Brimmer;

In recent years, U.S. Arctic strategy has included clean energy
measures, such as increased solar and wind generation, to displace some
diesel demand in remote communities. The Task Force supports these
measures but is concerned that implementation and funding will lessen
over time. Although it would take years to recoup the investment costs,
this burden is an inherent part of shifting to a more sustainable
economic platform. Further, Alaska has become a leader in developing
innovative, off-grid renewable energy technologies---the Alaska Center
for Energy and Power and the Alaska Renewable Energy Project being prime
examples---and could become an exporter of knowledge and know-how. The
Task Force finds that [the Arctic could serve as an **incubator for
energy innovation**]{.underline}. [Greater use of renewables would
reduce dependence on **costly diesel fuel**]{.underline},
[which]{.underline} [produces harmful emissions]{.underline} and has
detrimental effects on health. [New technological developments in
nuclear energy]{.underline}, [such as **small modular
reactors**]{.underline}, [also offer an opportunity]{.underline} [for
**economic development** in the region while **reducing dependence on
fossil fuels**]{.underline}. ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS The Arctic is a
remarkable region, encompassing vast areas of intact marine and
terrestrial habitats, some of the roughest seas in the world, an extreme
and variable climate, diverse human cultures whose traditions are
closely tied to the bounty of the land and sea, and abundant wildlife.
The rich Arctic environment attracts significant wildlife to the region,
including millions of birds from every continent each year, bowhead
whales from the Bering Sea, and gray whales from Mexico. As the Arctic
sea ice declines, resources that were once remote and difficult to
access are becoming increasingly accessible, opening not only the way to
new commerce but also new risks. For instance, ship hulls and holds, in
addition to sewage and other discharge from these vessels, can carry
invasive species into Arctic waters. In 2004, member states adopted the
IMO's International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships'
Ballast Water and Sediments. Having received sufficient ratifications,
the measure enters into force on September 8, 2017. Additionally, noise
from passing ships can disorient marine mammals and make them change
their routes. Changing migration patterns, in turn, affect the animals
and the Alaska Natives who harvest them. As economic activity in the
region increases, the Task Force finds that [the United States will need
**sustained policies** supported by scientific data]{.underline} and
evaluation to support culturally and environmentally sensitive economic
development. The sea is a major focus of environmental conservation
efforts, but the air in the Arctic matters as well. Thawing permafrost
releases carbon and methane, both greenhouse gases. A pound of methane
can trap twenty-five to thirty-three times more heat than a pound of
carbon dioxide.57 Norway has already developed technology for methane
capture, and the United States should follow its example and invest in
state-of-the-art methane capture technology as well. In 2015, [the
Arctic Council created an experts group to monitor]{.underline}
implementation of the council's framework for [**action on black
carbon** and methane]{.underline} by its members. The Task Force
recommends [that Arctic Council members urge]{.underline} observer
[states to **adopt the framework**]{.underline}.58 At some oil and gas
production sites across the world, natural gas is burned off or
"flared," releasing more than three hundred million tons of carbon
dioxide annually, as well as black carbon, into the atmosphere.59 The
Task Force supports the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030
initiative, which brings together governments, oil companies, and NGOs
and calls for natural gas to be conserved or used but not wasted by
flaring.

### Internal\-\--Climate Change\-\--2AC

#### Black carbon effects are [unmitigated]{.underline} -- results in [unrestrained accelerated climate change]{.underline} and [irreversible]{.underline} tipping points.

**[Black carbon]{.underline}**, a pollutant [emitted from the incomplete
combustion of fossil fuels, biomass and waste, sits]{.underline}
uniquely [at the centre of **climate and health crises**]{.underline}.
Black carbon [emissions affect **global warming**, snow and ice
melt,]{.underline} [monsoon and weather patterns]{.underline}, [flood
risk, heat stress]{.underline} and [public health]{.underline}. The
potential [benefits of reducing]{.underline} the [emissions]{.underline}
are [felt]{.underline} most [strongly close to the source]{.underline}.
The dual nature of black carbon as a climate and air pollutant has
[resulted in neither of these fields taking full ownership]{.underline}.
Therefore, [black carbon remains]{.underline} largely **[absent from
mainstream climate and health agendas]{.underline}**.

[Reducing black carbon emissions]{.underline} is [**critically
important** for fast climate mitigation]{.underline} and [**building
resilience** to the effects of climate change]{.underline}. The most
significant [effects of black carbon]{.underline} emissions are [on
sensitive cryosphere ecosystems that are subject to **irreversible
climate tipping points**]{.underline}. [Black carbon deposition on snow
and ice accelerates]{.underline} the [melting of]{.underline} the
[Arctic]{.underline}, the Himalayan and the Andean glaciers as well as
other cryosphere regions. Midlatitude black carbon emissions warm the
surrounding air, which is then transported poleward and contributes to
Arctic warming. Black carbon emissions in Asia and Africa have
contributed to more unpredictable monsoons that decrease water and
energy security, reduce agriculture productivity and cause catastrophic
flooding. Black carbon and other dark aerosols also worsen the impact of
heatwaves, which are getting more frequent in this warming climate

#### Action on black carbon is [lacking]{.underline}

Climate policy has emphasised action on carbon dioxide (CO2) and other
well-mixed greenhouse gases that are vital climate warming species, and
these species are the focus of international target setting and
agreements. Conversely, [attention on black carbon has
**lagged**]{.underline}. Only a [small number of countries have
incorporated black carbon targets]{.underline} within their nationally
determined contributions (NDCs), and [black carbon is **not part** of
any climate protocol]{.underline}, [revealing a **significant gap** in
climate strategy]{.underline}. On the other hand, air quality guidelines
focus on PM2.5, nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and other
pollutants to reduce air pollution. PM2.5 is composed of many species,
primarily sulphates, nitrates, organics, black carbon and dust. Thus,
reductions in NOx and SO2 can lead to reductions in PM2.5, and this has
been the focus of many successful air quality interventions (for
example, fuel sulphur standards). The World Health Organization has
highlighted the potential impact of black carbon on health and calls for
more studies but has not set guidelines for black carbon, and so
national and regional air quality standards do not specifically target
black carbon. Regional compacts, such as the Gothenburg Protocol,
acknowledge black carbon as a crucial constituent of PM2.5 but do not
mandate emissions reporting, and its applicability is geographically
confined.i Therefore, [despite its **role in climate
change**,]{.underline} awareness, funding and [action on black carbon
has **lagged behind** other pollutant species]{.underline}. Scientific
complexity has caused uncertainty and stagnation, meaning specific and
widespread action on black carbon in the form of targeted regulation and
mitigation actions has not materialised. Meanwhile, [black carbon
emissions are rising]{.underline} in many places [and]{.underline} are
[not diminishing quickly enough in others]{.underline}. This is [despite
the **ready availability of fuels and technologies** that can rapidly
reduce black carbon emissions;]{.underline} it is technically feasible
to reduce global emissions by 70% by 2030 from 2016 levels.1 The need
for mitigation is immediate and urgent. Hence, this policy brief: •
Provides an update on the latest scientific understanding regarding
black carbon and its role in climate change, public health and
resilience. • Highlights practical solutions and strategies to reduce or
eliminate black carbon emissions. • Outlines a set of targeted
recommendations for governments and funding bodies to ensure fast and
widespread adoption of interventions to reduce black carbon emissions. •
Calls for more research to reduce remaining uncertainties in our
understanding of the multifaceted impacts of black carbon

#### Solving black carbon in the Arctic is [key to solving]{.underline} warming.

[**Black carbon** and methane are]{.underline} short-lived [climate
pollutants that are contributing to **atmospheric
warming**]{.underline}. In addition, [black carbon that falls on snow
and ice accelerates]{.underline} the melting of these reflective
surfaces --consequently accelerating [the impacts of **global warming in
the Arctic**]{.underline}. [Black carbon]{.underline} and methane
[emissions]{.underline} also [contribute directly to air pollution that
harms human health.]{.underline}

[Arctic States are **uniquely positioned** to slow Arctic warming caused
by **emissions of black carbon**]{.underline}. Despite generating just
ten percent of global black carbon emissions, [Arctic States are
responsible for **30% of black carbon's warming effects** in the
Arctic]{.underline}, due to the greater warming impact of local emission
sources. Action by non-Arctic states is also important, as black carbon
emissions can be transported large distances from their source to Arctic
regions.

3.5.4. Environmental

[The [**absence** of lit]{.mark}erature related to the environmental
impacts [of SMRs is **notable**]{.mark}]{.underline} in this regard.
This may be [due to the obvious [**lack** of an operating plant that can
be a subject for **study**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For comparison's sake,
we may cite the study of Wang et al. (2019), who conducted a life cycle
analysis, including examinations of acidification potential,
eutrophication potential, photochemical ozone creation potential, and
human toxicity potential of wind energy, nuclear power (large reactor),
and hydropower. The study showed that wind power had the highest global
warming potential at 28.6 ± 3.2 g CO2-eq/kWh, followed by nuclear power
at 12.4 ± 1.5 g CO2-eq/kWh and lastly, hydropower at 3.5 ± 0.4 g
CO2-eq/kWh \[87\]. Boldon et al. (2015) conducted a similar study for
wind power and SMRs, noting that they fall within the range for an LR
\[66\]. Moreover, Carless et al. (2016) showed that the GHG emissions of
SMRs are similar to those of LRs \[80\]. Figure 9 shows a graph
comparing the results from these different authors. The [studies are
understandably largely based on projected quantities of materials since
[there are]{.mark} virtually [no SMRs on **commercial**
operations]{.mark} as yet]{.underline}.

Figure 9. LCA Results according to various authors.

As far as greenhouse gas emissions are concerned, studies have been
clearly made with respect to the entire plant in consideration. However,
it will be of equal importance what the environmental effects of such
modularity can have in either implementations i.e., of modularizing the
production process of a single plant, or the modularization of the power
producing capacity. In the former case, one can surmise the increased
cost of transporting the modular parts of a plant to the assembly area.
In the latter case, a nuclear plant with multiple SMRs would possibly
have more structural elements incorporated to secure each reactor.

[With the ever-[increasing **concern** for]{.mark}
environmentally-[sustainable tech]{.mark}nologies, these studies carried
out as accurate as possible are [important for]{.mark} the
decision-making process for [**newcomer** countries to]{.mark} avoid
making that trade-off of the environment for development. It is
important that before a country [make]{.mark}s [a decision to
choose]{.mark} a certain technology path, in this case [SMRs]{.mark},
they **know** the environmental impact it may have even [before
**embarking** on it]{.mark}]{.underline}. This breaks a circular notion
that in order for one to know the environmental impact, we need to build
the plant first, but to choose what plant to build, we need to know what
the environmental effects are. The LCA has to be conducted from the
whole plant-design level as early as possible.

Islands and Remote Regions

[**[S]{.mark}**mall **[m]{.mark}**odular
**[r]{.mark}**eactor**[s]{.mark}** have several unique characteristics
that]{.underline} reportedly [[provide]{.mark}
**advantages**]{.underline} in several sectors. [One unique
characteristic of SMRs is their ability to provide a relatively large
amount of [**emission-free** energy]{.mark} relative to their physical
footprint, which can be advantageous [for areas]{.mark} which are
[**difficult** to connect to]{.mark} national and international
**[grids]{.mark}** and have smaller space to generate energy
domestically, [in]{.mark} particular islands and **[remote
regions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is estimated that worldwide more than
730 million people live on islands, ranging from densely populated
islands such as Great Britain and Taiwan, to more remote and lower
population islands such as Iceland, Hawaii, and Nauru.35 [It can be
[difficult to provide]{.mark} islands with [electricity]{.mark};
electric grids situated on a nation's mainland often do not extend
[to]{.mark} islands without substantial cost, or the islands may only be
connected by [a]{.mark} single grid connection (which can make the
island or [remote region vulnerable to significant power
disruption]{.mark}). Additionally, direct generation of electricity on
islands can be difficult, particularly on islands with high
**population** density, inconsistent **weather** patterns, and/or
limited **infrastructure**]{.underline}.36

Similar to islands, [[getting electricity to]{.mark} remote regions on
the mainland such as [the **Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline}, densely
forested inland regions in South America and central Africa, desert
regions in the Middle East and North Africa, and the steppes of central
Asia [[has]{.mark} been [proven difficult]{.mark} for electricity
generators.]{.underline} As the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has
noted, [**[SMRs]{.mark}** are beneficial due to their ability to
[provide power]{.mark} to isolated and/or remote areas [where]{.mark}
large [plants cannot be supported]{.mark} (i.e., lack of infrastructure)
[or]{.mark} the amount of power that large reactors could produce would
not be warranted (i.e., [not enough **demand**]{.mark})]{.underline}.37
As stated above [the **[first]{.mark}** commercially installed [SMRs
have been placed in]{.mark} a remote region. Specifically, SMRs were
deployed on a floating barge off [Russia's Arctic Coast]{.mark} in
2021]{.underline}.38 [These SMRs [provide electricity to]{.mark} the
northernmost city in **[Russia]{.mark}** (Pevek), [removing the need
for]{.mark} it to receive heat and electricity from a nearby
[coal]{.mark}-fired power plant]{.underline}.39 [[SMRs]{.mark} likely to
come online globally [over the **next**]{.mark} several
**[years]{.mark}** further [illustrate this]{.mark}
use-case]{.underline};40 [such as the SMRs under construction on the
tropical island of Hainan, in the southernmost province off **China's**
coast]{.underline}.41 Reportedly, [countries]{.underline} with highly
forested areas (Brazil), desert regions (several Gulf states and
Argentina), and flatlands in central Asia (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan,
Armenia) [are [**all** look]{.mark}ing in[to SMRs]{.mark} as a way [to
support **local**]{.mark} electricity [generation]{.mark} in remote or
difficult-to-reach regions [without]{.mark} having to rely on [coal-
or]{.mark} natural [gas]{.mark}-fired power plants or imported
[energy]{.mark} (all of [which are]{.mark} generally
**[expensive]{.mark}**)]{.underline}.42

On January 20th, Donald **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** returned to the
White House as president, [[marking]{.mark} a **[new chapter]{.mark}**
for U.S. energy policy]{.underline}. [With **growing concerns** over
energy security]{.underline}, the future of [decarbonization,
and]{.underline} global [competitiveness, [**nuclear energy** sits at
a]{.mark}n important **[crossroads]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

While [Trump]{.underline} has historically [championed deregulation and
energy independence]{.underline}, [[his positions]{.mark} on nuclear
power [have been **inconsistent**]{.mark}]{.underline}---[at times
supportive, yet often [**vague** or
**contradictory**]{.mark}]{.underline}. But [there are some clear
advocates for nuclear]{.underline} power [in his inner
circle]{.underline}. His pick to lead the Department of Energy, Chris
Wright, is notably pro-nuclear. Wright, a longtime oil and gas
executive, served on the board of directors of Oklo, a microreactor
company, prior to his confirmation. Vice-President J.D. Vance publicly
supports nuclear energy---framing it as a reliable and innovative energy
solution. And Elon Musk, a long-time supporter of nuclear power but a
relative newcomer to Trump's entourage, has publicly advocated for
nuclear power in an interview with Trump himself.

Overall, [[there are **solid signs** for a **pro-nuclear**]{.mark} Trump
**[administration]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Trump's campaign
website includes a commitment to modernizing the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission (NRC), keeping existing nuclear plants operational and
investing in small modular reactors (SMRs). Subsequently, a commitment
to shifting energy policy from Biden's climate-centric priorities to a
focus on energy security and competitiveness---as already seen in the
pullout from the Paris climate agreement, the pause of IRA and IIJA
funds, and the declaration of a "national energy emergency"---will
likely privilege nuclear energy in the Trump administration. These signs
are now solidified by one of Trump's most recent executive orders to
establish The National Energy Dominance Council, in which Trump has set
his sights specifically on SMRs.

[But]{.underline} [while Trump's rhetoric about \"**rapid approvals**\"
and nuclear modernization **sounds promising**, it is **unclear** how
they will translate into]{.underline} [action]{.underline}. The
[[biggest challenge]{.underline}]{.mark} at this moment [[remains
**uncertainty**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Signals]{.mark} from
key]{.underline} political [figures]{.underline} and campaign promises
[[offer **optimism**]{.underline}]{.mark} for new nuclear development,
[[but]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[lack]{.underline}]{.mark} of [detailed
policy **commitments** and [clarity]{.mark}]{.underline} on execution
[[leaves stakeholders **grappling**]{.mark} **with
questions**]{.underline}. Will his administration support or even expand
programs like the Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) and
those building a domestic nuclear fuel supply chain? How will regulation
change at the NRC? Will incentives from the Inflation Reduction Act
(IRA) remain intact or be carved up under a Republican majority? Will
policy and workforce changes undermine the implementation and execution
of the "energy dominance" agenda? Can the nuclear industry actually make
significant headway under this administration?

[The [industry]{.mark}]{.underline} is optimistic but [has already
[**put the brakes**]{.mark} on several projects [due to
**uncertainty**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [A rapidly [changing landscape
doesn't encourage]{.mark} **[investment]{.mark}**]{.underline} in an
80-year asset. [[Until]{.underline}]{.mark} at least some of these
[questions are answered and [policy stabilizes]{.mark}]{.underline},
announcements and PR may accelerate, but [**real progress** will
**slow**]{.underline}.

Continued approval and execution of programs in DOE is critical.
Alternatively, efforts to cut agency employment---a priority of the
newly created Department of Government Efficiency---will slow down the
federal support that the industry desperately needs. [**Federal
funding** and incentives]{.underline} aimed at new projects [could **aid
deployment exponentially**]{.underline}. However, budget priorities are
non-specific and the administration is not likely to advocate for
federal handouts. These [contingencies]{.underline}---coupled with
remaining indecision, implicit policies, and implied long-term goals for
nuclear energy---[could **[delay critical progress]{.mark}** if not
addressed swiftly]{.underline}.

In short, the **[tone]{.underline}** from key figures in the
administration [**is promising** for nuclear energy]{.underline},
[but]{.underline} the lac[k of specificity and **Trump's track record**
of **unpredictability** leave much up in the air.]{.underline}
[Unpredictability is not what the nuclear sector needs]{.underline} to
get moving [and may negatively impact]{.underline} private
[investment]{.underline} in nuclear more than good policy can encourage
it. [[The **next few months** will be]{.mark} critical in determining
whether this moment becomes [a **turning** **point** or a **missed
opportunity** for nuclear energy in the]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates.

[[Arguments Against SMR]{.underline}]{.mark} Skepticism

Across this work, [arguments [are]{.mark} leveled against different
[**blends** of nuclear **skepticism** which]{.mark}]{.underline},
typically, [[infer from the **most unfavorable** past cases of
large]{.mark}-scale [nuclear]{.mark} projects [to **blank judgments**
about]{.mark} the **alleged [incapacity]{.mark}** of SMRs]{.underline}
to be delivered within time and budget -- see section 1.3. However,
[[the **very concept** of SMR]{.mark} has [crystalized as a response
to]{.mark} the **intrinsic [challenges]{.mark}** of the nuclear
industry]{.underline}. As noted by Flyvbjerg and Gardner (2023),
large-scale NPPs are "the products of a staggering number of bespoke
parts and systems that must all work, and work together, for the plant
as a whole to work," which fundamentally turns them into one-of-a-kind
products. By contrast, [SMRs are predicated on **standardization**,
**modularization**, and **replicability** in factory setting. [There
is]{.mark} certainly [**nothing preordained** about
their]{.mark}]{.underline} economical
[[impracticality]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[It is also frequent for nuclear [skeptics]{.mark} to [**dismiss** SMRs
based on]{.mark} unfavorable]{.underline} LCOE [[comparison]{.mark} with
**renewable** energy sources. Although this is an important fact in
today's clean energy transition,]{.underline} we have argued
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} LCOE [[does not capture the]{.mark} entire
[value that]{.mark} a **[zeroemissions]{.mark}**, **dispatchable**,
**[baseload]{.mark}**, yet partly **flexible** electricity source
[brings]{.mark} to the power system. [Such value]{.mark}]{.underline} --
especially [[in]{.mark} power systems of]{.underline} high renewable
shares, limited or low flexibility resources, and [[limited grid
capacity]{.underline}]{.mark} -- may [[justify]{.mark} **public
[support]{.mark}** for SMRs]{.underline}. Finally, on a more ideological
line, [[SMRs are depicted as]{.mark} a [socio-cultural]{.mark}
phenomenon ("**technofideism**"), by which decision-making elites lend
unwarranted credence to the promises of technology, impervious to
evidence. However, [there is **no empirical ev**idence
against]{.mark}]{.underline} the economic and safety case of [[SMRs.
Their]{.mark} definitional [features]{.mark} have repeatedly come out as
solutions to [**improve** the]{.mark}]{.underline} track record of the
[[nuclear industry]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Figure 7 suggests [[**rapid deployment** of SMRs over the next
decade]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, total installed capacity of
SMRs in 2035 varies from about 16 GWe in the LowTech-SMR case to 500 GWe
in the HighTech SMR case. [Much of these deployments [occur in
**developing regions**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Figure 8). [Rapid [economic
**growth** coupled with]{.mark} the need to achieve the stringent
[**climate goal** lead to]{.mark} a [substantial deployment of SMRs in
regions]{.mark}]{.underline} such as China and India, [especially in the
case [with no]{.mark} new investment in **[large
reactors]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While the results of this modeling
exercise suggest the potential for very high deployment rates for SMRs,
this is under the assumption that deployment is dependent on relative
prices alone. In reality, however, several factors, apart from the ones
described in Section 2.3 could constrain the expansion of SMRs and pose
challenges for fast up-scaling, particularly in the near term.

ADVANTAGES OF SMRs

The [**accelerated** pace of R&D into [SMRs]{.mark} has]{.underline}
resulted in [several benefits that are **inherently linked** to the
small and modular design of the systems. SMRs have a **lower** initial
capital **investment**, greater **scalability** and siting
**flexibility** for locations unable to accommodate more traditional
larger reactors. They also have the potential for enhanced **safety**
and **security** compared to earlier designs, and their deployment can
help [**drive** economic **growth**]{.mark}]{.underline}. These benefits
are highlighted below.9

Modularity and Lower Capital Investment

We\'ve already discussed how [the size of SMRs [allows for]{.mark} more
[flexibility]{.mark} in how and where these systems can be
deployed]{.underline}. As the technology continues to advance, [SMRs are
anticipated to require limited on-site preparation, which will
significantly **[reduce]{.mark}** the typical lengthy [**construction**
times]{.mark}]{.underline} associated with larger nuclear units. It is
expected that the ability to transport prefabricated modules to their
required locations will lower project capital costs and ultimately
reduce costs associated with their deployment. As the demand for energy
increases, additional modules can be incrementally added, increasing the
duration of the system\'s life cycle.

Greater Siting Flexibility and Efficiency

[[Ensuring]{.mark} adequate grid [**infrastructure** to]{.mark} deliver
electricity to **[remote locations]{.mark}** remains a significant
challenge in [reducing]{.mark} greenhouse gas (**GHG**) [emissions and
meeting]{.mark} our **energy [security]{.mark}** [needs]{.mark}. SMRs
can provide power in locations where larger traditional units are not
needed or **lack** the **infrastructure** to support a large unit,
including smaller electrical markets, remote areas, smaller grids, sites
with limited water and acreage, or unique industrial applications. SMRs
can also be used for **[replacement]{.mark}** power [at]{.mark} aging or
[retiring]{.mark} fossil-fueled [generation sites]{.mark}. Likewise,
SMRs can [**supplement** existing]{.mark} industrial
**[processes]{.mark}** or generation sites with a carbon-free emitting
energy source]{.underline}. When used with other generation sources,
such as renewable and fossil-fueled energy, [SMRs can **[leverage
resources]{.mark}** and produce higher efficiencies and multiple energy
end products [while increasing **grid resiliency** and
**security**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Some advanced SMRs can produce higher
temperature process heat for either electricity generation or high
energy-intensive industrial applications.

Increased Safeguards

[SMRs include increased [safeguards]{.mark} and security requirements as
part of the "security by design" engineering process applied to new SMR
design]{.underline}. DOE indicates that new SMR design facility
protection systems include "barriers that can withstand design basis
aircraft crash scenarios and other specific threats,"10 and [further
"[provide]{.mark} safety and potential **[nonprolif]{.mark}eration
[benefits]{.mark}** to the United States and the wider international
community."]{.underline}11 DOE further states that "most SMRs will be
built below grade for safety and security enhancements, addressing
vulnerabilities to both sabotage and natural phenomena hazard scenarios.
Some SMRs will be designed to operate for extended periods without
refueling."12 [With the ability to be manufactured and fueled within a
factory, then sealed and transported to a location, advanced SMRs could
be returned to the factory at the end of their life cycle for defueling,
thereby **[minimizing]{.mark}** the transport and handling of **[nuclear
material]{.mark}**]{.underline}. According to DOE, [advanced SMRs "based
on non-light water reactor coolants could be more effective at
dispositioning plutonium while [minimizing]{.mark} the [wastes]{.mark}
requiring disposal."]{.underline}13

Industry Growth and Economic Development

[The [increasing use]{.mark} of any technology [**results** in increased
economic growth]{.mark}. It is anticipated that [**mass manufacturing**
SMRs]{.mark}]{.underline} will reduce the cost per kilowatt of
electricity equal to current generation sources. SMR proponents say that
a factory approach to manufacturing could help the sector cut costs and
remain competitive as the costs of renewables decline. With the
existence of both domestic and international markets for SMRs, DOE is
hopeful that as the development of standardized SMR designs takes hold,
US companies will have an increased presence in the global energy
markets.14 [As with any technology, the increased use of SMRs [**will**
provide]{.mark} the necessary **incentive** to increase manufacturing
capacity to meet demand, resulting in **[further]{.mark}** growth of
both domestic and international sales of SMR units. Coupled with the
deployment of SMR units to replace retiring power plants or meet growing
electricity generation needs, this will result in **[significant
growth]{.mark}** in domestic manufacturing, the tax base, and factory,
construction and operating jobs]{.underline}.

We agree that more powerful countries are likely to have more influence
on the long-term future than less powerful ones, and that a country's
economic [[development is a]{.mark} **strong [indicator]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} its **tech**nological and **geopolitical [power]{.mark}**.
However, this]{.underline} does not mean that developed countries matter
morally more than developing ones. Rather, it [underscores the
importance of global development]{.underline}---the process of low- and
middle-income countries becoming high-income ones. Similarly, although
workers in high-income countries generally have higher labor
productivity, a large component of this is the place premium. That is, a
worker's productivity increases---sometimes by a factor of 15 or
more---when they move from a poor country to a rich country, simply
because they are being paid more for the same work. Once again, [this
speaks to the **import**ance of **global development** and helping
people **escape poverty**]{.underline}. This essay describes why it's
important for the long term future for everyone to be in a relatively
high-income country, and what it might look like for global development
to be a longtermist issue. [Global [development benefits]{.mark} the
**long-term [future]{.mark}** by increasing diversity in **global
institutions** and [reducing]{.mark} civilization's [vulnerability
to]{.mark} **global [catastrophic risks]{.mark}** [like]{.mark} **armed
[conflict]{.mark}** [and **pandemics**]{.mark}]{.underline}. What is
global development? Effective altruists regularly talk about "global
health and development" as a category of ways to do good. However, it's
clear now that development drives health much more than health drives
development. Global development is the process by which low- and
middle-income countries turn into high-income countries. The best modern
example of this are the Asian countries of South Korea, Taiwan, Japan,
and China. These have been compared with other Asian countries that were
thought to be "tiger cubs" in the '90s such as the Philippines and
Thailand in the book How Asia Works, by Joe Studwell. In this book, Joe
lays out a recipe for development. Here's the summary from Bill Gates:
Create conditions for small farmers to thrive. Use the proceeds from
agricultural surpluses to build a manufacturing base that is tooled from
the start to produce exports. Nurture both these sectors (small farming
and export-oriented manufacturing) with financial institutions closely
controlled by the government. Importantly, in South Korea, Taiwan,
Japan, and China, these steps were taken by relatively uncorrupted
leaders who made it their life's work to develop their home country.
Other countries unable to develop had leadership who were swayed by the
neoliberal free-market thinking pervasive at the World Bank and IMF at
the time, or who were otherwise too corrupt or incompetent to stay true
in delivering their development strategy. Global development is
important for the long-term future In an EA Forum post, Beckstead
defines three types of benefits that an intervention can have: proximate
benefits, benefits from speeding up development, and trajectory changes.
Global development would have immediate benefits for people alive today:
economic development in low-income countries means that fewer people
would experience poverty, illness, hunger, and violence. Speeding up
development is speeding up the process by which countries become
high-income, so it would ensure that people realize these benefits
sooner. But most of the benefits of global development are through
trajectory changes that affect the long-term future. We argue that
[global development creates significant **long-term benefits** through
this route. Global development can also lead to **trajectory changes**
in the global political environment that would **not** happen if the
development timeline were **slowed down**, since such changes can be
**locked in** over time]{.underline}. Global development increases
diversity in global governance One of the main ways global development
benefits the far future is through its impact on diversity and inclusion
in world institutions. [[As countries get richer]{.mark}, their [people
get]{.mark} **better [educated]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} thus better placed
to [participate in **institutions**]{.mark}]{.underline} with great
decision-making power over the world, such as multinational
corporations, governments, and international organizations. Increasing
the diversity of decision makers in [global institutions
**[improves]{.mark} the quality** of **world [governance]{.mark}**[,
which]{.mark} enables humanity to better **[navigate existential
risks]{.mark}** and other **global challenges**]{.underline}. Diversity
in global institutions improves their efficacy in two ways. First,
socially diverse groups outperform homogeneous groups at decision-making
because they deliberate more carefully and pay more attention to facts.
They also innovate more because diverse group members bring unique
perspectives. Second, it improves value alignment between these
institutions and humanity as a whole. It has been proposed that humanity
should engage in a "long reflection" to decide what is ultimately of
value before making potentially irreversible decisions regarding its
future. For such decisions to reflect the values and needs of all of
humanity, as many people as possible should be able to participate
meaningfully in the global institutions making these decisions.
[Currently, about **689 million** of the 8 billion people worldwide live
in **extreme poverty**, and they **cannot** participate meaningfully in
world governance]{.underline} as long as their basic needs are not met.
2.9 billion people lack Internet access, which is an important
communication channel through which people make their voices heard on
global issues and influence global institutions. Internet adoption is
uneven across social groups: for example, women, people in rural areas,
and people over age 25 are less likely to have Internet access. These
disparities are especially pronounced in the 46 UN-designated Least
Developed Countries (LDCs). Another barrier to diversity in global
governance is the structure of institutions such as the United Nations,
which is not designed to represent the general will of humanity. UN
institutions represent the will of states---especially the five
permanent members of the UN Security Council: the United States, the
United Kingdom, France, Russia, and China. Although a diverse group of
countries have voices in the UN, their citizens do not, especially in
the case of authoritarian states. Global development reduces existential
risks [**Another** important way in which global development improves
the long-term future is by **reducing existential risks**, particularly
risks from [**pandemics** and **political
instability**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 80,000 Hours estimates that the risk
of a biological existential catastrophe in the next 100 years is about 1
in 1000. [[Poverty]{.mark} makes communities more susceptible to
[spread]{.mark}ing infectious **[diseases]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For
example, a study of Monrovia, Liberia, in 2014 found that people living
in slums who caught the Ebola virus spread it to an average of 3.5 times
more people than people living in rich neighborhoods. This is because
these neighborhoods are overcrowded, contaminated, and lacking in
sanitation and health care infrastructure. Also, malnutrition weakens
the immune systems of poor people, thereby making them more vulnerable
to disease. [Raising national [income improves]{.mark} **population
health** and enables countries to **invest more** in **[public]{.mark}
health [infrastructure]{.mark}**, which makes populations more
[**resilient** to]{.mark} potentially **[catastrophic
pandemics]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [**Global [poverty]{.mark}** also
[causes **existential risk** through]{.mark} its negative effects on
**[international security]{.mark}**. Many developing countries,
particularly weak states, are caught in a **vicious cycle** of poverty,
**corruption**, and **political instability**]{.underline}: "Inept,
corrupt, or weak governance fosters poverty; widespread poverty makes
effective, equitable governance more difficult to achieve; and when weak
governments fail to improve their people's lives, their legitimacy
suffers." [[Weak states]{.mark} often [**engender terrorism** and
**crime**]{.mark} because they are unable to maintain law and order in
their territories]{.underline}. Global development in practice There are
two general ways [to increase the living standards]{.underline} of
people around the world. The first is reducing barriers to immigration
to high-income countries so that more people from low-income countries
can move to them, take advantage of the place premium, and send money
back to their countries of origin. The second is to [pursue policies to
increase the productivity of low-income countries so that their people
are better off.]{.underline} Reducing barriers to migration Opening up
borders in high-income countries does not decrease opportunities for
those in high-income countries (although it may stress city
infrastructure if not planned well). Matthew Yglesias writes about a
six-month period in 1980 where 125,000 Cubans left the Cuban port of
Mariel and arrived in Florida (a 7% increase in the labor workforce).
These immigrants weren\'t particularly skilled, but no decreases in
natives' wages occurred. Yglesias explains that immigrants increase the
quality and variety of goods and services available, instead of
competing for native workers' jobs. Furthermore, when the supply of
hired help is increased, some college-educated women who might have
otherwise been stay-at-home moms are more likely to work. Immigrants
also send money back home: for example, according to the Central Bank of
the Philippines, between 1975 and 1994 Filipino overseas contract
workers sent remittances totaling \$18.196 billion (for comparison, the
Philippines is currently \$46B in debt to the World Bank, IMF, etc.).10
Closing the digital divide is also one way to gain some of the benefits
of open borders, by opening up opportunities for jobs in high-income
countries that can be done remotely to people in lower income
countries.11 Catch-up growth [Economic growth improves quality of life
better than public health interventions]{.underline}. However, it is
difficult for a country to increase its income unless the country\'s
leadership is both dedicated to this cause, and following the correct
strategy towards development. As pointed out by a report from Rethink
Priorities last year, land redistribution (the first step of developing
a country according to How Asia Works) is unlikely to happen without
some kind of major turmoil (such as a country gaining independence) as
landowners have political power, even if landowners are vastly
outnumbered. Here are some examples of organizations pursuing catch-up
growth in low- and middle-income countries: The World Bank and IMF
provide loans and advice to low and middle income countries for
development. Depending on the income of the country, the loan may not
have to be repaid. The Gates Foundation provides entrepreneurial
support. Newer organizations working on the problem include Growth Teams
and the Charter Cities Institute. Entrepreneurs such as Sierra Juice and
Jaza Energy contribute by providing jobs and increasing production value
of exports. Interestingly, investment in non-hydro renewable energy has
actually tipped to be greater in low- and middle-income countries than
in high-income countries, now that solar has become cheaper. The Center
for Global Development advocates for rich-world policies that benefit
low- and middle-income countries. Other organizations engage in
activities such as microloans, which are shown to benefit the recipient
as long as the microloan is not used to fund people joining multi-level
marketing schemes. Organizations like Grameen America should stop
allowing the loans to be used for this purpose. Overall there are many
more initiatives meant to alleviate poverty than to encourage the
economic development and democratic power necessary to end it. [Given
that government-led development is hard without a people in power
dedicated to and capable of executing development strategy]{.underline},
**[the mechanism by which [development happens]{.mark} is [by successful
businesses giving]{.mark} people stable [jobs]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
especially jobs that upskill workers in their career. Conclusion While a
naive application of longtermism might lead one to think that low-income
countries are less important than high-income countries, this view is
facile because it ignores the fact that countries can and do develop
over time. Rather, longtermism speaks to the importance of developing
low-income countries into high-income ones. [Global development improves
the long-term future of humanity by improving global governance and
decreasing civilization's vulnerability to catastrophic risks. This
makes global development a pressing longtermist issue.]{.underline}

[While the [U.S.]{.mark} has [coasted on]{.mark} its
[laurels]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[with nuclear energy]{.mark} production
not changing]{.underline} much [in over 30 years, **[Russia
continues]{.mark} its**]{.underline} gradual [**[climb]{.mark} upward**
[and **exports many reactors**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [while [**China is
investing heavily**]{.mark} in civilian nuclear tech and boosting its
atomic power generation]{.underline} at home. [Beijing [plans to build
24]{.mark} new [nuclear]{.mark} power [plants]{.mark} by
2030]{.underline}, [bringing]{.underline} the [total]{.underline} up [to
**60**, **[overtaking the U.S.]{.mark}** with its old reactor
fleet]{.underline}. [For comparison]{.underline}, the U.S. has 93
operational nuclear power plants in total, and [in the same period as
China's building spree, the **U.S. added 2** with none under development
now.]{.underline}

[This [decline is **by choice**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The
U.S.]{.underline} certainly used to [have the technical and financial
resources to compete with Russia and China in these fields]{.underline},
but the political will to pursue nuclear power (despite its
overwhelmingly green characteristics (zero CO2 emissions, and its
exemplary safety record in North America) has been lacking. The
notorious Three Mile Island accident in 1979, killed, injured,
irradiated, or harmed zero people. Meanwhile, ballooning costs and the
nightmare that is America's byzantine environmental review and
permitting processes resulted in the last nuclear power plant arriving 7
years late and 17 billion dollars over budget. It's little surprise the
U.S. is falling behind in many nuclear areas. "A generation of Americans
were scared by Three Mile Island, and the nuclear industry became a
political and environmental target", said Jack Edlow of Edlow
International, a company that specializes in the global transportation
of nuclear materials and has been in the nuclear industry for 55 years.

[The [average age of]{.mark} a nuclear [reactor in]{.mark} the [U.S. is
**40 years old**]{.mark}, meaning Russia and China have been able to
take advantage of]{.underline} (often [American]{.underline}) [research
into **better reactors**]{.underline}. [The [emerging tech]{.mark}nology
[of **S**]{.mark}mall **[M]{.mark}**odular
**[R]{.mark}**eactors]{.underline} (SMRs) and advanced generation four
reactors [[are]{.mark} being [embraced **far quicker in China** and
**Russia**]{.mark} than in the U.S.]{.underline}

[[SMRs]{.mark} are]{.underline} a [popular]{.underline} option [to
[advance **clean** and **safe production**]{.mark}, as they
address]{.underline} [multiple concerns about nuclear
power]{.underline}. [The [ease of assembly and transport]{.mark} of SMRs

risks due to]{.underline}]{.mark} their anticipated [[**reduced rate of
accidents** and **lack of meltdown**]{.mark} [potential]{.mark} due to
innovative tech]{.underline}nology. Additionally,
[environmental]{.underline} and aesthetic [concerns are addressed by the
ability of SMRs to be placed in remote areas, or
underground]{.underline}. [Despite]{.underline} the [promise
of]{.underline} SMRs and platitudes from [the DOE]{.underline} on the
subject, [[investments in SMRs **lag far behind** what is
needed]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Russia and China dominance in SMR's [expands international soft power]{.underline} and [leverage over developing countries]{.underline}.

Some analysts remain skeptical of SMRs' novelty and point to the history
of expensive, over-budget conventional nuclear projects. But [[China and
Russia]{.mark} believe they will **[transform]{.mark} the [energy
market]{.mark}**: with huge investments]{.underline}, [by
2030]{.underline}, [[China]{.mark} hopes to [export 30 reactors
to]{.mark} its [B]{.mark}elt and [R]{.mark}oad [I]{.mark}nitiative
partner]{.underline} countrie[s]{.underline}, [and [Russia]{.mark} aims
to [capture **20 percent** of]{.mark} the [global]{.mark} SMR
[market]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[As]{.mark} the world's [electricity
demand rises, so will the **strategic value**]{.mark} of nuclear energy,
which offers **far greater power density** than other
sources]{.underline}: just one uranium fuel pellet produces as much
energy as a ton of coal, 149 gallons of oil, or 17,000 cubic feet of
natural gas.

NUCLEAR FALLOUT

The [comprehensive financing packages and [efficient production that
Beijing and Moscow]{.mark} are [offer]{.mark}ing [make nuclear
power]{.mark}]{.underline} much more [[accessible]{.mark} [for]{.mark}
developing [nations]{.mark}]{.underline}. But [these
agreements]{.underline} also [[risk creating **long-term
dependence**]{.mark}, [ensuring that]{.mark} buyer [countries remain
**indebted to China and Russia**]{.mark} and reliant]{.underline} on
their operational expertise [for decades]{.underline}. [[Despite this
threat]{.mark} of dependence]{.underline}, emerging economies---as well
as developed [countries]{.underline} that want to generate more nuclear
power---[[have **few compelling alternatives**]{.mark} to Chinese and
Russian nuclear energy]{.underline}. The [[American]{.underline}]{.mark}
company NuScale Power has signed agreements to deploy SMRs in Ghana and
Romania, but the projects remain in the planning phases. Another
American company, Westinghouse, is helping Poland build its first
nuclear power plant. But these [efforts **lag far behind** those made by
Beijing and Moscow.]{.underline}

Although some unique efficiencies help centralized, statist governments
fast-track nuclear energy projects, [[there is no]{.mark} inherent
[reason why the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} and its
allies [[cannot]{.mark} support the development, production, and export
of reactors at a rate that [compete]{.mark}s [with]{.mark} their
**[authoritarian counterparts]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [From the 1960s
through the 1990s, the United States supplied much of the world's
nuclear manufacturing, reactor designs, and supply chain expertise.
China's and Russia's]{.underline} ambitious, [state-backed funding
models]{.underline}, however, [have **edged out U.S.
companies**]{.underline}. U.S. government policy bears some
responsibility: export laws have erected onerous barriers to countries
interested in purchasing U.S. reactors. [Before the United States
transfers nuclear technologies and materials to another country, it
demands that the partner country sign a peaceful nuclear energy
cooperation agreement]{.underline}, referred to as a 123 agreement. Such
agreements [adhere to **strict nonproliferation
safeguards**]{.underline}, but Washington often seeks additional
commitments---such as requiring partners to forgo enriching their own
uranium or reprocessing spent fuel that can make U.S. technology less
attractive to potential buyers.

Furthermore, U.S. regulatory inefficiencies act as a bottleneck to
progress. For instance, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission often
takes five years or more to approve a reactor project and imposes
burdensome fee structures on applicants. Kairos Power's Hermes reactor
is the only licensed SMR actively under construction in the United
States; this slow pursuit of SMRs reflects long-standing institutional
challenges at the NRC, including an internal culture that has struggled
to align with innovation.

[The [race]{.mark} to provide advanced nuclear power [is not
simply]{.mark} a [symbolic]{.mark} technological competition. It [is a
**geopolitical struggle for influence** and **economic
competitiveness**]{.mark} in a rapidly electrifying world. [Beijing and
Moscow will]{.mark}]{.underline} steadily [[gain more **soft power**
as]{.mark} the [countries]{.mark} [with]{.mark} which they have nuclear
energy [deals]{.mark}]{.underline} are incentivized to [**[align]{.mark}
with [their]{.mark} [economic ambitions]{.mark}** [and **political
ideals**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is [happening already: for instance,
Rosatom is expanding Hungary's nuclear power capacity; nuclear energy
now generates about 44 percent of the country's
electricity.]{.underline} [After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022,
Hungarian Prime Minister]{.underline} Viktor Orban [vehemently opposed
including Russian nuclear power in]{.underline} the EU's
[sanctions]{.underline} on Russian nuclear energy, [achieving an
**exemption**]{.underline}.

[In the future, [countries could]{.mark}]{.underline} even [use their
[leverage]{.mark} over]{.underline} the [[reactors]{.underline}]{.mark}
they build [[to **coerce** or **punish** buyer nations by]{.mark}
**turning the reactors off or [seizing them]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Such
a [threat is]{.underline} hardly [without precedent]{.underline}. [In
2014, Russia shut off its gas supplies to Ukraine for months after
annexing the Crimean Peninsula, causing **economic** and **social
disruption**]{.underline}. Unlike fossil fuels, [[electricity cannot be
stockpiled, making]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[shutdown]{.underline}]{.mark} of a nuclear power plant [[devastating
for]{.mark} a nation's [power grid and economic
stability]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is]{.mark} not the only country
[falling behind]{.mark}]{.underline}. Other major powers with advanced
nuclear industries have not done enough to offer the accessible
financing and turnkey project models that developing countries need. The
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development requires its
member states to impose higher interest rates and longer repayment
durations for nuclear projects than China and Russia do. And [most
multilateral development finance institutions, such as the World Bank,
refuse to help fund the construction of nuclear plants.]{.underline} All
[these barriers **[force developing nations to turn to Chinese and
Russian]{.mark}** nuclear [export]{.mark}
program[s]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The [[manipulative]{.mark} tendencies of the [**BRI** came to
light]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2017 [when accusations of "**[debt trap
diplomacy]{.mark}**" surfaced against China]{.underline}. [On paper, the
BRI funds major infrastructure projects in developing
countries]{.underline} while other developed countries hesitate to lend
a helping hand. [In reality,]{.underline} the [**unsustainable
[loans]{.mark}** these countries acquire [are **used as leverage**
by]{.mark} the [Chinese gov]{.mark}ernment]{.underline}. In other words,
[by binding developing countries to large amounts of debt, China gains
the ability to [demand]{.mark} large [**equity stakes** in]{.mark}
valuable]{.underline} [ports, airports, and long-standing [geopolitical
alliances]{.mark}]{.underline}, to say nothing of nuclear infrastructure
projects. For instance, in 2017, [Sri Lanka was unable to "service its
\$1.1 billion package of loans" to China]{.underline} in order [to
finance]{.underline} the construction of "[the Hambantota
Port.]{.underline}" [As a result, China received majority control of the
port]{.underline} on a 99-year lease along with majority access to
strategic infrastructure that acts as a foothold in the Indian Ocean, to
Sri Lanka's detriment. Clearly, even smaller infrastructure projects
under China's BRI raise concerns about debt-for-equity swaps, where
financial sovereignty is compromised in favor of Chinese ownership.
However, [these [**concerns are amplified** in]{.mark} the context of
**[nuclear projects.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

The [sensitive [process]{.mark} of the "Nuclear Dragon" [forces]{.mark}
a **BRI [country's dependency on China]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Firstly,
the [process of constructing the nuclear power plant takes about ten
years]{.underline}; after its completion, the [units operate
for]{.underline} around [60]{.underline} years. Second, [the supply of
fuel, maintenance of the plant, disposal of spent fuel, and training of
personnel are all dependent on China.]{.underline} [Lastly, shutting
down the reactor is extremely difficult]{.underline}, especially due to
the need to dispose of the spent fuel. Therefore, [[as]{.mark} soon as
[the agreement is signed]{.mark}, the [recipients]{.mark}]{.underline}
of the nuclear BRI [[become **trapped in a**]{.mark} **nearly
[hundred-year alliance]{.mark}** with China]{.underline}. [As countries
inevitably turn to China, its [influence]{.mark} threatens to
**[undermine]{.mark} the [balance of power]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Consequently, [[as China's share of]{.mark} the [nuclear market rises,
its control over]{.mark}]{.underline} shaping the [**rules and
[norms]{.mark}** in global nuclear governance rises]{.underline},
**[[threaten]{.mark}ing global nuclear cooperation]{.underline}**. The
increasing possibility of China's broadened role thus threatens [global
security regarding **[nonproliferation]{.mark}** and the status quo of
nuclear exportation]{.underline}. Therefore, the [extended period of
dependence]{.underline} on Chinese expertise and resources [[pose
significant risks to the **national security**]{.mark}]{.underline} and
autonomy of developing countries. [The consequences of a debt-for-equity
arrangement]{.underline} in such scenarios could [lead to a prolonged
loss of control over critical energy assets and infrastructure, deeply
**embedding external influence** in national security
matters]{.underline}.

Beyond the economic and geopolitical implications, the [[BRI's]{.mark}
approach to [nuclear projects introduce]{.mark}s **[profound
environmental]{.mark} security [risks]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[Developing countries]{.underline}, especially, [have
expressed]{.underline} their [interest in nuclear reactors]{.underline},
with 41 of them being BRI countries. [Nuclear power]{.underline}, while
offering significant energy outputs, [comes with]{.underline} inherent
[[challenges]{.mark} that [are **exacerbated**]{.mark} **under the BRI's
framework**]{.underline}. Considerable amounts of [BRI [projects
**destroy ecologically sensitive areas**]{.mark} to make room
for]{.underline} roads, rails, power plants, and other
[infrastructure,]{.underline} often [leading to major]{.underline}
unintended [consequences]{.underline}. The construction of a hydropower
project in the Batang Toru rainforest in Indonesia is a prime example.
To make room for the BRI-led construction, deforestation led to flooding
in farmlands and threatened wildlife such as the Tapanuli orangutan--
the rarest great ape species. [The environmental consequences are not
limited to immediate ecological disruptions; they]{.underline} also
[[encompass **long-term hazards** associated with **nuclear waste
management**]{.mark} and the potential for catastrophic
events]{.underline}. Additionally, [many BRI countries **lack the
resources**]{.underline}, [**regulations**, and **tech**nology to handle
nuclear reactors safely and responsibly]{.underline}. Therefore, the
"[[Nuclear Dragon]{.mark}" [**heightens the risk** of mishandling
nuclear tech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology [[and **radioactive
waste**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[make]{.mark}s]{.underline} their [**[proliferation]{.mark}** to rogue

**one nuclear launch** is]{.mark} nuclear **war**,]{.underline} [and
likely human **[extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline} and [there [are **no
mitigating**]{.mark} and adaptable [technologies available that]{.mark}
can **[preserve human societies]{.mark}** amidst a nuclear
conflict]{.underline}. [[Rising distrust in]{.mark} the]{.underline}
U.S.-led [nuclear [nonproliferation]{.mark} regime]{.underline} will
surely [[lead to]{.mark} more [states **seeking** nuclear
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}. The examples of [**Iran**, **North
Korea**, and Syria]{.underline} illustrate. [the danger posed by WMDs
proliferating to **aggressive, unstable** states and terrorist
organizations.]{.underline}

The current nuclear nonproliferation regime under the Nonproliferation
Treaty ([[NPT]{.underline}]{.mark}) will have to [[contend
with]{.underline}]{.mark} an increasing number of
**[[challenges]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the coming years. [Many
[members]{.mark}]{.underline} of the international community
[[question]{.mark} the [commitment of nuclear weapon]{.mark} states [to
disarmament]{.mark}]{.underline}, which has led to the creation of the
Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons(TPNW) \[1\] . The TPNW has
been criticized by the United States as divisive to the broader
nonproliferation regime \[2\]. While the TPNW is a sign of an effort to
speed up the process of abolishing nuclear weapons, rational deterrence
theory suggests that, today's international security landscape, in part,
depends on the presence of nuclear weapons for stability. Well known
nuclear scholars such as Matthew Kroenig posit that, at least for the
moment, the world is a safer place with the United States retaining its
vast nuclear capabilities \[3\]. In essence, the [slow steps taken by
nuclear weapons states towards disarmament]{.underline},
[hinders]{.underline} their [ability to limit]{.underline} the
[proliferation of **nuclear weapons**]{.underline}. As this process
continues, it is possible that [more [states **abandon**]{.mark} the
[prospect of nuclear arms]{.mark} [reduction]{.mark}]{.underline} and
[seek to **acquire WMDs** themselves]{.underline}. Amidst the uncertain
future of the nuclear nonproliferation regime, [[new]{.mark} potential
nuclear [weapons]{.mark} [states]{.mark} are
**[emerging]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[North Korea]{.underline}]{.mark}
has [spent]{.underline} most of its [recent history]{.underline} first
**[acquiring nuclear weapons]{.underline}** and [then [building up its
**nuclear arsenal**]{.mark} and delivery systems]{.underline}. Likewise,
[**[Iran]{.mark}** has [sought a nuclear arsenal]{.mark} to contend
with]{.underline} its regional rival [Israel and]{.underline} the
[United States]{.underline}. Part of the [**[difficulty]{.mark} in
[dealing]{.mark}** [with rogue]{.mark} states]{.underline} is that [each
will [require]{.mark} a [different diplomatic
approach]{.mark}]{.underline}. While a proponent of deterrence might
argue that mutually assured destruction will ensure global stability,
[North Korea's nuclear capabilities coupled with]{.underline} its
[belligerent rhetoric]{.underline} towards its neighbors, such as South
Korea and Japan, as well as the United States, [is nevertheless
**concerning**]{.underline}. In addition, [the anti-U.S. and
anti-Israeli contingent in Iran]{.underline} that
[characterizes]{.underline} much of its foreign policy underscores why
[the potential for them to acquire nuclear weapons]{.underline} should
be particularly concerning \[4\]. The role of nuclear weapons as a
coercive tool suggests that there is a wide array of aggressive
behaviors for which both states can use nuclear weapons without even
launching them \[5\]. Additionally, [rogue states]{.underline},
particularly North Korea, that [are]{.underline} seemingly [on the brink
of collapse]{.underline} could [[fall victim to]{.mark} the '**[use them
or lose them']{.mark}** logic]{.underline}. According to this logic, the
North Korean leader may feel compelled to use his arsenal if his demise
is in sight.

In addition to being problematic and destabilizing states, [Iran and
North Korea are]{.underline} both [on the United States list of state
sponsors of **terrorism**]{.underline} \[6\]. Another prominent member
of that list, Syria, has used chemical weapons against its own
population in a civil war, which involves the terrorist group ISIS
\[7\]. [[Links between **WMDs and terrorism** pose]{.mark} a
[significant **danger**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [because]{.underline} most
[terrorist]{.underline} groups [do not have a clear territory where a
counter nuclear strike could occur]{.underline}, [which
calls]{.underline} into question [whether **deterrence** would
hold.]{.underline} [[Terrorist actors and rogue
states]{.underline}]{.mark} that do not have civilian control over their
military and [have less sophisticated command]{.underline} and control
systems [are more likely to [fall **victim to nuclear
accidents**]{.mark}]{.underline} \[8\]. Each of these situations will
require a unique diplomatic strategy to address the danger of
proliferation. What we know for certain is that the spread of WMDs to
unpredictable states such as Iran, North Korea, and Syria is a threat to
the international security landscape, to the national security of the
United States and its allies, and an impediment to the end-goal of
disarmament. [Until the nuclear nonproliferation regime]{.underline} can
more effectively wed the concepts of deterrence providing temporary
stability and a viable path to nuclear zero, [[nuclear
cooperation]{.mark} will continue to [fracture]{.mark}, leading [more
states]{.mark} to **[seek nuclear weapons
programs]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

tool of diplomatic engagement**]{.mark}]{.underline} in Europe. [The
U.S.-Romanian strategic partnership, in deploying the first European SMR
facility]{.underline} in Doicești in 2029, is [a **significant
milestone** in transatlantic energy cooperation]{.underline}. [[As
more]{.underline}]{.mark} European [[nations express interest in SMR
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology in their quest [for safe, secure, and
affordable energy, the [U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [can **[maintain its edge in]{.mark}

[Small modular reactors [represent a **transformative approach**]{.mark}
to nuclear energy [because]{.mark} [of]{.mark} their [**scalability**
and **flexibility**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The miniaturization of nuclear
reactors is not new. It has been used as early as the 1960s for military
purposes in submarines and aircraft carriers. The contemporary SMR
concept took shape in the early 2000s, with several companies from the
United States, Russia, the People's Republic of China (PRC), Argentina,
Canada, and South Korea pursuing parallel development paths. [One of the
early commercial contributors in the United States, NuScale Power, began
the work on design]{.underline} in the 2000s [and partnered with the
Department of Energy in 2013]{.underline}. NuScale became the first
company to receive approval from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission
for small modular reactor design in 2020.

[Unlike traditional nuclear power plants built on-site, [SMRs]{.mark}
are [designed in factories]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}
innovative process [[**reduces construction time**]{.mark} and
[**costs**, improves **control**]{.mark} **mechanisms,** [and enhances
**accessibility**]{.mark} [for]{.mark} a wide range of utilities and
[countries]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Their modularity allows for capacity
expansion, which makes them more **adaptable** to the energy needs
of]{.underline} diverse [communities]{.underline}. Modern [SMRs have a
[capacity of]{.mark} up to **[300]{.mark}**]{.underline} megawatts
(**[[MW]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [per unit [and incorporate]{.mark}
passive safety [systems for maintaining **safe
conditions**]{.mark}]{.underline} without external power. Their
[[smaller size]{.mark} [makes them **suitable** for
replacing]{.mark}]{.underline} aging [[coal]{.mark} plants and
integrating]{.underline} them [with renewable sources while maintaining
grid stability]{.underline}. [These [characteristics make SMRs
attractive for countries]{.mark} that want [to **accelerate**]{.mark}
**their [transition towards clean energy]{.mark}**]{.underline} without
over-reliance on the unpredictable nature of renewable energy.

[The]{.underline} United States ([[**US)-India** nuclear
coop]{.underline}]{.mark}eration that [now [includes]{.mark} **joint
design** and **manufacturing** of]{.underline} Small Modular Reactors
(**[[SMRs]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [marks]{.underline} [a significant
milestone in their **civil nuclear partnership**]{.underline}. In
pursuit of [joint development and potential deployment]{.underline}, in
May 2025, the US Department of Energy authorised an American firm,
Holtec International, to jointly develop SMRs with its Indian
counterparts. Though [these]{.underline} [reactors are considered part
of India's clean energy program, their [**dual-use**]{.mark} purpose of
[potential applicability in **naval propulsion**]{.mark} makes
SMRs]{.underline} a [[**strategically sensitive**
tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nology. Likewise, the [potential for modular
deployment creates challenges for the verification regime]{.underline}.
This authorisation for the indigenous production of nuclear reactors in
India [would]{.underline} not only [undermine norms of the global
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Regime]{.underline} (NPR) but [also
[exacerbate]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[fragility of **strategic
stability** in **South Asia**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[India]{.underline}]{.mark} already enjoys access to Russian nuclear
markets, and it has [[long sought]{.mark} assistance from its Western
partners]{.underline}, [especially [the US]{.mark}]{.underline}. Such
[transfer of dual-use tech]{.underline}nology [and authorisation of
development and deployment by the US [allows India to **capitalise** on
**nuclear exchanges** without]{.mark}]{.underline} taking into
[consideration their **legal** and **[safeguard
obligations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Until now, the [US has
allowed]{.underline} its [firms to export nuclear equipment to India;
however]{.underline}, with this deal, the [US has authorised India to
produce nuclear components domestically]{.underline}.

[Assistance]{.underline} by the US for India's clean energy objectives
and strengthening of the US-India partnership [must not be]{.underline}
done [at the **expense of global** non-prolif]{.underline}eration
**[norms]{.underline}**.

By successfully capitalising on the Nuclear Supplier Group (NSG) waiver
of 2008, India has signed 14 civil nuclear agreements with multiple
states, including South Korea, Kazakhstan, Canada, France, the United
Kingdom (UK), Japan and Australia. Given India's Civil Liability for
Nuclear Damage Act (CLNDA, 2010), the US remained largely excluded from
India's reactor market. The NSG waiver enabled India to capitalise on
global nuclear commerce despite being a non-Nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty (NPT) signatory. [India has **not signed** the]{.underline}
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (**[CTBT]{.underline}**) [and has
not adopted a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the]{.underline}
International Atomic Energy Agency (**[IAEA]{.underline}**); still, [the
US-India strategic partnership enables India to gain access to the
global nuclear market]{.underline}

[Novel designs and flexible [**deployment** of SMRs
raise]{.mark}]{.underline} new [**[regulatory challenges]{.mark}** that
may]{.underline} [[not]{.underline}]{.mark} [be]{.underline} fully
[[addressed by **conventional frameworks**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[Preferential treatment for India is **[eroding]{.mark}**]{.underline}
the [normative foundations of NPR]{.underline}. As per Article 1 of the
NPT, nuclear weapon states are not allowed, even indirectly, to
facilitate non-nuclear weapon states in acquiring nuclear weapons.
[India is not a signatory to the NPT]{.underline}, and it
[does]{.underline} [not comply with IAEA safeguards]{.underline}. New
Delhi is [expanding]{.underline} its [nuclear fissile material beyond
the oversight of the international regulatory framework]{.underline},
like the IAEA. As far as the inspection of Indian nuclear facilities is
concerned, the IAEA inspection regime is concerned with only the
scrutiny of civil facilities. India's specific safeguard agreement
(INFCIRC/754) forbids inspection of nuclear facilities like fast breeder
reactors and naval propulsion development. [Lack of universal compliance
undermines the **[essence of NPR]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[questioning]{.underline} the selective [applicability of regulatory
frameworks]{.underline} like the IAEA and NSG. This selective approach
has [[**set the stage** for **norm erosion** and **unequal
enforcement**, increasing **crisis instability** in South
Asia]{.underline}]{.mark}. Conventional [[**asymmetries** between
Pakistan and India]{.mark} are already
[augmenting]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [amidst]{.underline}]{.mark} [India's
[**doctrinal shifts** and]{.mark} **[aggressive]{.mark}** strategic
[posturing]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The [US-India civil-nuclear cooperation]{.underline} currently [involves
the sharing of tech]{.underline}nology, [but with the signing of the SMR
deal, exceptionalism will become a new norm]{.underline}. This
[unprecedented move will [lead other states to seek similar entitlements
from NPR]{.mark}]{.underline}. In such a scenario, the [burden of
compliance and restraint will remain unevenly enforced]{.underline}.

Therefore, [there is a [need to reinforce NPR through]{.mark} principles
of equity and transparency]{.underline}. [Geopolitical considerations
must not take precedence over]{.underline} principles of
**[[universalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Extra-regional architects and
enforcers should not grant an exceptional attitude to one actor.
[[**Nuclear privilege** from the US]{.mark} for]{.underline} its
strategic [partners like India [raises serious concerns for **regional
stability**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Access to peaceful nuclear
tech]{.underline}nology [should be undertaken with legal obligations in
a universal manner]{.underline}. In pursuit of [extending the rule of
law over nuclear weapons]{.underline}, all states should [adhere
to]{.underline} the principles of the [NPR]{.underline}. [Strategic
exceptions for partners risk the stability of overall efforts for
disarmament and non-proliferation]{.underline}.

U.S.]{.mark} national **[interests]{.mark}** regardless of

the PRC committed to selling 30 overseas nuclear reactors to its Belt

launch of cost-competitive SMRs. [From a [Great Power

Drawing insights from the productive Romanian-U.S. strategic
collaboration in SMR deployment, the new Trump administration may
explore different policy avenues for bolstering SMR diplomacy in Europe.
This may include leveraging U.S. strategic partnership with the Three
Seas Initiative format, composed of countries in Central and Eastern
Europe that are seeking to improve connectivity in transportation,
energy, and digitalization. Such diplomatic engagements in 'minilateral'
frameworks, like the Three Seas Initiative, are essential to promote
U.S. leadership in nuclear energy and identify new partners for SMR
deployment. Furthermore, [the United States must [empower allies]{.mark}
to speak more persuasively to their citizens [about]{.mark} the benefits
of [SMR]{.mark} technology [to mitigate]{.mark} potential
[disinfo]{.mark}rmation campaigns [from **geopolitical rivals**]{.mark},

and **challenges** [in]{.mark} terms of **[nuclear

[**[resistance]{.mark}** of SMRs compared to larger]{.underline} nuclear

GCC = global climate change

The [**[continuously growing]{.mark}** global carbon dioxide
[emissions]{.mark}]{.underline} (CO2) [and the accumulation of this gas
in the atmosphere have **[ushered]{.mark}** a global [climate
change]{.mark}]{.underline} (GCC), [the **[most
pressing]{.mark}**]{.underline} environmental [[issue of the]{.mark}
21st [century]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change has issued [several [warnings on]{.mark} the expected
**[calamities]{.mark}** of the GCC]{.underline} (IPCC, 2007) as well as
strategies to mitigate the effects of GCC (IPCC, 2022). [It is [**widely
accepted** that]{.mark} one of the **[most effective]{.mark}** ways to
reduce the global CO2 emissions and lessen the effects of GCC [is to
transition]{.mark} the electricity generation industry from fossil fuels
[to]{.mark}]{.underline} renewables, with the addition of [[nuclear
energy]{.underline}]{.mark}, which does not produce CO2 (Michaelides and
Michaelides, 2020; Aszodi, ´ et al., 2023). [Nuclear energy
may]{.underline} also [be used]{.underline}, with or [**[without
renewable]{.mark}** energy [sources for]{.mark} the
production]{.underline} of an energy carrier, such as hydrogen (Khan et
al., 2022) or a hydrogen compound such as ammonia, methanol or ethanol
which is easier to transport (Michaelides, 2025). A recent review on
this subject (El-Emam et al., 2024) advocates the [use of nuclear energy
in integrated energy systems for the decarbonization of the energy
industry and the [**mitigation** of GCC]{.mark}]{.underline}. The review
provides insights into the design of such nuclear-renewable system
combinations, considering regional or national demand and supply
situations. The recent roadmap by the International Energy Agency (IEA,
2023) and the more [recent reports on the growing electricity generation
industry and GCC mitigation]{.underline} (IEA, 2024) [emphasize the
importance of nuclear energy in [reaching **net-zero** emissions]{.mark}
by the year 2050]{.underline}.

Nuclear power generation started with smaller pilot-type reactors in the
1950 s to reach the large reactors of today that generate electric power
in the range of 1,000 to 1,600 MW and take advantage of economies of
scale in their operation. However, [there are hundreds of **sm**aller
nuclear **r**eactor**s**, built for use in **naval vessels** as well as
those built for sources of **neutrons**. Because of this, the
engineering community has the knowhow and some experience in the design
and operation of]{.underline} what are sometimes called Small Modular
Reactors ([[SMRs]{.underline}]{.mark}), [that]{.underline} have
significantly lower capacity to generate electric power and [may be
[used to supply **smaller** and more **isolated**]{.mark}
**communities** and **[regions]{.mark}** with electricity. However, the
design and [operation]{.mark} of future commercial SMRs [will **differ**
from]{.mark} both [current]{.mark} research [reactors]{.mark} and navy
reactors]{.underline}. In addition, licensing and some new technology
will also be needed to make commercial SMRs a reality. One should
consider that [the [further development of]{.mark} an [SMR industry
would **revitalize**]{.mark} the US [nuclear]{.mark} industry [and
would]{.mark} [be a **huge stimulus** for]{.mark}]{.underline}
high-salary job **[[growth]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Rosner and Goldberg,
2011). [It is characteristic of the importance of nuclear energy in
mitigating the GCC that, in the third decade of the 21st century, the
energy plans and roadmaps of [**most nations** consider]{.mark} the use
of]{.underline} large or [**[sm]{.mark}**aller nuclea**[r]{.mark}**
reactor**[s]{.mark}** to assist their decarbonization plans]{.underline}
(Kannan and Turton, 2016; Kehbila et al., 2021; Koivunen and Hirvijoki
2024; Morones-García and François, 2024). There are also several
researchers that advocate nuclear energy [[as the **only solution** to
clean, renewable energy]{.underline}]{.mark}, without the addition of a
great deal of solar and wind energy (Rehm, 2023).

As "Oppenheimer" looks set to blow the box office competition away in
theaters this month, this decade [Americans will see the **utilization**
of **[sm]{.mark}**all nuclear **[r]{.mark}**eactor**[s]{.mark}** as the
[**key** to]{.mark} a **[sustainable]{.mark}** and clean [energy]{.mark}
future. Small nuclear reactors offer **numerous** advantages like
**[efficient]{.mark}** power [generation, low]{.mark} carbon
[**emissions** and]{.mark} potential **[versatility]{.mark}** that make
them a key component in achieving a [renewable]{.mark} energy
**future**]{.underline}.

[Solar, wind, and hydropower]{.underline} are equally vital to an "all
of the above" energy solution, but they
currently [[have **limitations**]{.mark} such as intermittency and land
requirements]{.underline}.

[Small nuclear reactors are designed to produce electricity **more
efficiently** compared to their larger counterparts]{.underline} used in
traditional nuclear power plants. [The compact [size allows for]{.mark}
better **heat** management and the utilization of advanced **cooling**
techniques, resulting in a [higher **conversion**]{.mark} of nuclear
energy to electricity. This increased **efficiency** helps [maximize
power]{.mark} output [with]{.mark} fewer resources and
**[reduced]{.mark}** environmental [impact]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Small nuclear reactors generate electricity through **[nuclear
fission]{.mark}**, which produces **significantly [lower]{.mark}**
carbon [emissions]{.mark} compared to fossil fuel-based power plants. By
[replacing]{.mark} conventional [plants]{.mark} with small nuclear
reactors, considerable emissions can be **[mitigated]{.mark}**, making
them a **major contributor** to de[carbon]{.mark}ization efforts. This
transition would aid in [**combating** climate change]{.mark} while
[maintaining]{.mark} a **[reliable]{.mark}** source of
[energy]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Another advantage of small nuclear reactors lies in their versatility
and scalability. The small [size]{.mark} of these reactors [allows for
easier **integration**]{.mark} into existing power grids and built
environments]{.underline} (which are human-made or modified structures
that provide people with living, working, and recreational spaces),
reducing the need for large-scale transmission infrastructure and
minimizing aesthetic impact. Moreover, small nuclear reactors [can be
deployed in a variety of applications, [including **remote
power**]{.mark} generation]{.underline}, district heating, water
**[[desalination]{.underline}]{.mark}** and even hydrogen production.
[This versatility [provides]{.mark} a [**flexible** and **adaptable**
framework]{.mark} for **integrating** nuclear power into diverse energy
systems]{.underline}.

Safety is a paramount concern when it comes to nuclear power. Small
nuclear reactors, with their advanced designs, incorporate improved
safety features compared to older and larger nuclear reactors. They
employ passive safety mechanisms, such as inherent shutdown
capabilities, to prevent accidents and eliminate the need for external
power or operator intervention. Furthermore, they operate at lower power
levels, minimizing the potential consequences of any catastrophic event.
These [enhanced safety measures, coupled with rigorous regulatory
[oversight]{.mark}, ensure that small nuclear reactors can be used with
confidence and **[reduce]{.mark}** the **[risks]{.mark}** associated
with nuclear power]{.underline}.

Of course, when utilizing nuclear power, nuclear waste must be
addressed. [Small nuclear reactors offer potential benefits in **waste**
management compared to traditional large-scale reactors. These reactors
can utilize advanced fuel cycle options, such as recycling, which can
reduce the volume [and]{.mark} prolong the lifespan of nuclear
[waste]{.mark}. Additionally, they produce relatively smaller quantities
of waste due to their reduced power output. Proper management and
end-of-life considerations can **limit** the environmental **impact**
and ensure a **responsible** approach to nuclear energy]{.underline}.

Small nuclear reactors are a crucial component in our pursuit of a
renewable energy future. Their enhanced efficiency, reduced carbon
emissions, versatility and scalability make them a valuable addition to
the energy mix. Furthermore, their advanced safety features and
potential waste management advantages lay the groundwork for responsible
and sustainable deployment of nuclear power.

By harnessing the benefits of small nuclear reactors alongside other
renewable energy sources, we can create a resilient and low-carbon
energy system, paving the way toward a cleaner and brighter future for
generations to come.

#### The window for climate mitigation is [rapidly]{.underline} closing, and renewables don't solve. [Only]{.underline} SMRs can ensure energy [security]{.underline} and [curb]{.underline} Chinese advancements while [decarbonizing]{.underline} the industry.

1.1 A Nuclear Revival

[[With]{.mark} the **ambitious** [climate pledges]{.mark} by world
governments [and]{.mark} the [**limited timeframe** for]{.mark}
impactful [climate mitigation]{.mark} actions, [nuclear power]{.mark}
has again come to [the]{.mark} **fore** as a [clean, safe, and
innovative choice]{.mark}]{.underline}. Besides, [the Russian invasion
of **[Ukraine]{.mark}** in February 2022 has [raised]{.mark} major
**energy [security]{.mark}** [concerns]{.mark}, especially in Europe.
This has [highlighted nuclear]{.mark} technology [as a]{.mark} source of
[**decarbonized**, reliable]{.mark}, and dispatchable [power,
against]{.mark} a backdrop of import dependence and market
**volatility** for fossil fuels, on the one hand, and increasing
flexibility [challenges]{.mark} coming [with]{.mark} the rapid expansion
of [renewable]{.mark} energy [sources]{.mark}, on the other
hand]{.underline}.

However, [with a track record marred by massive delays and budget
overruns, the [global]{.mark} nuclear [industry]{.mark} has seen a
[loss]{.mark} of **[credibility]{.mark}** regarding its ability to
deliver new power plants on time and on budget. Nuclear power plants
([NPPs]{.mark}) [are **complex**]{.mark} and **expensive** to build,
with long lead times. Recent history offers several cases of troubled
projects, with delays of more than a decade, cost overruns of (tens of)
billions of dollars and protracted legal disputes]{.underline}. Among
the most obvious examples are the EPR-based projects in Flamanville
(France), Olkiluoto (Finland) and Hinkley Point C (Somerset, England),
as well as Plant Vogtle (Georgia, U.S.) -- seven years behind the
schedule and \$20 billion over budget -- and, most extremely, the failed
Monju NPP (Japan).

There are 428 operational nuclear reactors worldwide, as counted by the
World Nuclear Association (WNA), totaling a capacity of 394,308 MWe and
covering 10% of the global power generation. The power output of 2021
was 2,653 TWh, a figure that has seen little changes over the past 25
years. [New NPPs have [opened mostly in **China** and closed in
West]{.mark}ern countries, where investments have been directed
predominantly towards green power generation]{.underline}. Moreover,
several European nations have outright banned nuclear power plants, as
public support for the industry had ebbed to the point of making it
politically unpalatable.

[And yet, within and outside [Europe]{.mark}]{.underline}, countries
with nuclear traditions, [as well as some new entrants, have recently
made **bold [pledges]{.mark}** [for **revived**]{.mark} national
[nuclear]{.mark} programs]{.underline}. In 2022, France, where about 70%
of power generation is derived from NPPs, decided to allocate €1 billion
of public funding to support the construction of six new reactors of a
new generation, possibly followed by eight further units (WNA, 2023a).
In Japan, where the Fukushima disaster of 2011 prompted a drastic
reduction of nuclear power to as low as 1% of total production, the
decision was made in 2022 to ramp up nuclear power generation to 22% of
total by 2030 and to add a new 1.2GW advanced light water reactor by the
mid-2030s (Kabakci, 2022). In South Korea, nuclear power is set to
increase from 27.4% in 2021 to 34.6% in 2036 (World Nuclear News, 2023).
In Ontario, Canada, which is home to all but one of the country's 19
nuclear reactors, the expansion of the Bruce Power NPP has been recently
announced -- the first large-scale Canadian nuclear investment in more
than three decades (Heinzl, 2023) -- alongside four small nuclear
reactors (SMRs) to be built at the Darlington site, slated to come
online between 2034 and 2036 (Ontario, 2023).

[These plans **[pale]{.mark}** in comparison [to China's]{.mark} nuclear
ambitions]{.underline}. With 53GWe of operational reactors and 22GWe
under construction, the country plans to reach 70GWe gross of nuclear
capacity by the end of 2025 (WNA, 2023b). Worldwide, about 100 nuclear
reactors with a total gross power of about 100GWe are planned or already
on order, mostly in Asian growing economies (WNA, 2023c).

[All in all, "about [**30 countries** are considering]{.mark}, planning
or starting nuclear power [programs]{.mark}," ranging from advanced
economies to developing nations, [across **all
continents**]{.mark}]{.underline} (WNA, 2023c). According to IEA's 2023
World Energy Outlook, nuclear power generation will increase by 50%
globally between 2022 and 2050 (from 417 GW, in 2022, to 620 GW, in
2050) in the STEPS scenario, based on the "latest policy settings,
including energy, climate and related industrial policies". Alternative
scenarios show even more accelerated nuclear grow for 2050 -- 770 GW
(Announced Pledges Scenario, APS) to 900 GW (Net-Zero Emissions
Scenario, NZE). [The growth is to come mainly from China and the
emerging economies, whereas the advanced countries will focus on
lifetime extensions and new NPPs to replace retired capacities. "While
large-scale capacities are the dominant form of
technologies]{.underline} (including advances reactors designs), [there
is an [increasing interest in]{.mark} **s**mall **m**odular
**r**eactor**s** in the **long term**]{.underline}." (IEA 2023, 126).

In Europe, 16 EU member states met in Paris on 16 May 2023 for the
"nuclear alliance:" Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic,
Finland, France, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Slovenia,
Slovakia, Estonia, Sweden, with Italy as an observer and the UK as a
guest. In a joint declaration, a target was set for reaching 150GW of
installed nuclear capacity in Europe by 2050, including the deployment
of a new generation of nuclear technology: the [small modular
reactors]{.underline} (**[[SMRs]{.underline}]{.mark}**) (Ministère de la
Transition Énergétique, 2023).

1.2 Enter SMRs

Prospects of a new kind are promised by the SMR technology. Before we
define and differentiate SMRs in section 2, let us just characterize
them broadly for now as a new generation of small-capacity nuclear
reactors (maximum 300MW per unit), modular and factory-made,
standardized and simplified, with a broader range of target applications
and lower system integration costs. True, at this stage, SMRs are still
mere designs of various maturity levels, in different stages of
regulatory approval, and back to different extents by state support
schemes and contractual commitments. However, if at least some SMR
ventures manage to eventually deliver on significantly reducing the cost
of deployment compared to conventional nuclear plants, with designs
approved and constructed within budgets and timelines, then [this new
nuclear technology generation is [**sure** to make a]{.mark} valuable
contribution to a [**decarbonised** and **resilient**]{.mark} energy
[system]{.mark}]{.underline} -- albeit only starting around 2035 in a
market-significant manner.

#### Warming triggers extinction. Tipping points and knock on effects overwhelm defense.

Our focus will largely be on [[climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}. This
is because it [[is the **most**]{.underline}]{.mark} well-researched and
[visible contributor to **[global]{.mark}** ecological
**[risk]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Yet, it cannot be easily disentangled
from our other planetary boundaries. This analysis should be seen as a
partial and likely conservative overview. For this chapter I will use
the definitions for terms such as catastrophic and existential risk that
are outlined in our previous paper Climate Endgame.

The state of the science

[Uncertainty, **tail-risks**, and **tipping points**]{.underline}

For many ecological risks, it appears that the more we know, the worse
the threats appear.

For climate change, the best indication for this is a change in the
'reasons for concern' across [consecutive **[IPCC]{.mark}** assessment
**reports**]{.underline}. The IPCC [[identifies]{.underline}]{.mark}
five 'reasons for concern': unique and [threatened ecosystems;
**frequency** and **severity** of extreme weather events]{.underline};
global distribution and balance of impacts; total economic and
ecological impact; and [**[irreversible]{.mark}**, large-scale,
**[abrupt transitions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. These are intended to be
indicators to inform the world of how close we are to "dangerous
anthropogenic interference with the climate system", the central mission
of international climate policy.3 These reasons for concern are
determined by IPCC authors as a reflection of expert opinion, and
underpin the famous 'burning embers' diagram. The diagram shows, in a
thermostat fashion, at what temperature the risk of these different
concerns is. Over time, [with **each** successive report, the
**[risk]{.mark}** levels]{.underline} for any given temperature [[have
**risen**]{.underline}]{.mark}. That is, these reasons for concern have
become more worrisome, even at lower temperatures, as the science has
progressed.4 In the fifth Assessment Report (AR5), all of the reasons
for concern were 'high' or 'very high' likelihood for just 2--3°C of
warming.5

Tipping elements in the Earth System have followed the same trend as the
reasons for concern. That is, over time [the likelihood of crossing
tipping points]{.underline} at low levels of warming [has been
rising.]{.underline} Tipping elements refer to [when [warming]{.mark}
breaches a **critical threshold**, causing]{.underline} a
[change]{.underline} in one part of the climate system to [[become
**self-perpetuating**]{.mark}, resulting in]{.underline} potentially
[significant]{.underline} Earth System [impacts]{.underline}. This
includes **[[Artic]{.underline}]{.mark}** Winter [Sea
[ice]{.mark}]{.underline} [collapse [and]{.mark} dieback of [the
**Amazon**]{.mark}]{.underline} Rainforest. The most recent assessment
of evidence on tipping elements found that out of 16 tipping elements,
[six are at a **high likelihood** of being tipped at]{.underline}
1.5--[2°C]{.underline} of global heating. This includes events such as
the die-off of low-latitude coral reefs, as well as the long-term
collapse of the West Antarctic and Greenland Ice Sheets. Hence, even the
ambitious goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial
temperatures would likely activate multiple tipping elements.6

The study of tipping points and regime shifts in ecosystems has
progressed significantly, leading to new insights.7 We now have nascent
findings suggesting that such [radical changes]{.underline} often [occur
in a domino]{.underline} effect.8 For climate change, this has been
termed [[a]{.mark} ['tipping **cascade'**]{.mark}]{.underline}.9
Moreover, it appears that the larger and more complex the ecosystem, the
[more rapid and complete]{.underline} its potential
[collapse]{.underline}. Such lessons are not causes for comfort.

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED NONE OMITTED\>\>

There is more mixed news on equilibrium climate sensitivity. Climate
sensitivity refers to the response of the climate system to a doubling
of greenhouse gas concentrations. Since approximately the 1970s and 80s,
such a response has been estimated to be between 1.5--4.5°C---that is,
until the most recent sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the IPCC. AR6
reports a narrower likely range (66--100%) of 2.5--4°C and very likely
range (90--100%) of 2--5°C. The upside of this is that high
sensitivities of \>4°C are less likely than previously expected. The
downside is that the IPCC is now 'virtually certain' (99--100%) that
climate sensitivity will be above 1.5°C, since all lines of evidence run
strongly against these lower levels of warming.11 Unfortunately, a
climate sensitivity of greater than 4.5°C, while unlikely, could not be
ruled out as lower levels have been. These findings echo a major study
on climate sensitivity in 2020, which used a Bayesian approach with
multiple strands of evidence.12 These new findings imply that a doubling
of greenhouse gas concentration (which could occur this century) would
run an 18% chance of causing 4.5°C or more of warming. This echoes
earlier estimates of surprisingly high likelihoods of disturbingly high
temperatures. Wagner and Weitzman estimate that under a concentration of
700 parts per million (ppm) (which falls within a mid-high scenario),13
there is an approximately 10% chance of exceeding 6°C by the end of the
century (note that this would be slightly lower under the latest ECS
estimates).14 Temperatures this high last occurred 50 million years ago
and have never been experienced by hominids.15 Such rapid warming is
geologically unprecedented, and a rise that is an order of magnitude
faster than what occurred during the worst mass extinction event: the
End-Permian Extinction. In the slightly longer term, even more radical
pulses in heat may be possible. One basic model found that stratocumulus
cloud decks may abruptly be lost, causing \~8°C global warming, with CO2
concentrations that could be approached by the end of the century.16
This 8°C would be additional to the previous level of warming needed to
trigger this tipping point. Other studies have shown the potential for
strong cloud feedbacks to push rapid and irreversible warming.17 Over
the past decades, knowledge of catastrophic climate change has risen
alongside---but not kept pace with---global emissions. Unfortunately,
the higher-end warming scenarios that matter the most are those we know
least about. One recent study, text-mining IPCC reports, found that
there was a significant mismatch between coverage of different levels of
warming and their likelihood. Similarly, a recent survey by Nature of
234 IPCC authors found that over 60% of people surveyed expected warming
of 3°C or above by the end of century.18 However, in existing assessment
reports, less than 10% of the mentions of temperature rise refer to 3°C
or above.19 IPCC reports have given disproportionate attention to lower
temperature scenarios (2°C or lower) relative to their likelihood and
impact. This trend is increasing over time, with each subsequent
Assessment Report covering extreme temperature rise less.20 Indeed, the
IPCC notes in its 2014 Fifth Assessment Report that there have been few
quantitative investigations of the global impacts of warming above
3°C.21 Regardless of their likelihood, the higher impact of these
scenarios makes them even more vital to robust decision-making under
uncertainty. The gap between likely scenarios and our knowledge is
disconcerting. One of the glimmers of hope over past decades has been
some limited progress in emission reductions. The falling prices and
increasing deployment of renewable energy has made the worst-case
emissions scenario (previously RCP8.5, now SSP5--8.5) increasingly
unlikely.22 This should not be grounds for complacency. High
temperatures and extreme impacts can still be reached even with lower
anthropogenic emissions. That is because emissions concentrations are
reflective not just of human emissions, but also the reaction of the
Earth System. Moreover, there is still substantial uncertainty over
greenhouse gas trajectories. Cumulative emissions to date have most
closely tracked the RCP8.5 scenario.23 Longrun changes in technology,
energy demand, and economic growth are all highly uncertain and will
have a significant impact on how much carbon is released. One study
using an expert survey and econometric modelling found that annual
economic growth rates of 2.1% (with a standard deviation of 1.1%) over
the next century were plausible. These high growth rates yield a \>35%
likelihood that emissions would exceed the RCP8.5 pathway.24 Moreover,
even the best super-forecasters of geopolitical events cannot make
accurate predictions for events over a year away.25 We need to maintain
a healthy skepticism over our ability predict what the world's
geopolitical and energy systems---and, hence, our emissions---will look
like in a century. Despite some improvements, the overall emissions
picture remains dire. Assuming full implementation of the climate
pledges under the Paris Agreement (nationally determined contributions,
or NDCs), emissions will have increased by 13.7% in 2030 relative to
2010.26 One of the least discussed and most important obstacles is the
reality of delay. Previous studies have found that the delay in
undertaking emissions reductions is the largest influence on the costs
and likelihood of meeting a given target.27 This is an 'emerging
consensus' across climate economics.28 The main impediment is the
lock-in of fossil-fuel-intensive infrastructure. Delay to date has been
primarily due to one key factor: the fossil-fuel industry and the
wealthy who benefit from a fossil-based economy. We should be careful
not to tie climate risk solely to the level of warming. Under the right
conditions, climate change could have catastrophic impacts, even at just
2°C of warming.29 When thinking through extreme climate risk, we need to
consider not just emissions and the associated level of warming, but
also the impacts, social vulnerability to these impacts, and the
response of domestic and international communities.30 Complex ends:
Cascading crises and risks Extinction is complicated. Each of the five
mass extinction events throughout the phanerozoic history of Earth has
involved a complex of different factors including oxygenation, volcanic
eruptions, asteroid strikes, and food web cascades. One of the few
common imprints is climatic change. Global warming likely played a
central role in each mass extinction event, perhaps even the Late
Ordovician (previously assumed to be a cooling event).31 Fast-forward to
human history: while we have no account of Homo sapiens going extinct,
we do have a record of states, empires, and kingdoms crumbling,32 as
well as the extinction of other hominid species.33 It is always a
confluence of vulnerabilities, exposures, responses, and hazards---and
one that frequently has the fingerprint of climatic change.34 The
science of climate change and other global ecological threats has
progressed considerably since 2004. Perhaps the greatest shift in the
field has been away from thinking about a list of individual ecological
hazards, towards thinking about how systems transform and fail. We are
slowly realising that, like mass extinction events and societal
collapses, ecological catastrophe will not be a simple affair. Instead,
these 'Anthropocene risks' involve human-driven processes that interact
with interconnected global socio-ecological processes and have complex,
cross-scale relationships. The study of such risks necessitates a new
approach to governance that includes an appreciation of justice,
inequality, and the agents driving us towards disaster.35 Global
ecological threats are increasingly thought of as a study of complex
systems. Earth Systems science is evolving as a discipline and is
increasingly thought of as a set of interconnected 'planetary
boundaries'.36 Climate is only one of these boundaries and is
accompanied by stratospheric ozone depletion, biosphere integrity, novel
entities, ocean acidification, freshwater use, land system change,
biochemical flows, and atmospheric aerosol loading. Each boundary is
linked to a different planetary sub-system that could be pushed into
instability by human pressures. The study of regime shifts in smaller
ecosystems---such as pollinator communities,37 and coral reefs38---takes
a similar approach. These are matters of systemic risk:39 systems can
change rapidly into a new state (like a vibrant coral reef transforming
into an algaedominated environment) based not just on single hazards,
but the structure of the system, internal feedbacks, and sets of
interacting stressors. This systemic view is not just restricted to
ecology, but has also become commonplace in studying financial crashes
and societal crises more broadly.40 Such a lens has not only highlighted
concern over potential 'tipping points' in the Earth System,41 but also
the chance of irreversible changes. For instance, relatively small
levels of warming locking the world into far higher temperatures and a
'Hothouse Earth' trajectory.42 Similarly, irreversible loss of the West
Antarctic ice sheet will likely occur at approximately 2°C and the
current ice configuration will not be regained even if we lower
temperatures back to present levels. Risk comes not just from the
potential changes in the Earth, but also from human responses. The IPCC,
in its sixth assessment report, has explicitly recognised this, defining
risk not only in terms of impact, but also responses. This is a new,
state-of-the-art complex risk assessment: a consideration of hazards,
vulnerabilities, exposures, and responses.43 Alongside these
determinants of risk, we need to better understand how risks could
cascade, including across sectors, countries, and even systems. The most
obvious and dramatic example of a response risk is geoengineering:
large-scale interventions into the Earth System to mitigate the effects
of climate change. Carbon dioxide removal (or 'negative' emissions)
through direct air capture of greenhouse gases, afforestation, or
reforestation would be the lowest risk option, but appears unlikely. It
would require a herculean effort to develop and deploy the technologies
and infrastructure needed for large-scale negative emissions within
decades. Instead, the lowest-cost and most likely option is also the
riskiest: stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI). SAI involves injecting
particles into the atmosphere to reflect sunlight. One recent risk
assessment of SAI suggested that the largest threat comes from 'latent
risk': abrupt warming that would accompany the deactivation of the SAI
system. Currently there are no clear mechanisms for the direct
ecological impacts to be catastrophic, although these cannot be ruled
out due to the nature of the Earth System. SAI would provide several
stressors to the global system, including through changing disease
patterns and precipitation, as well as the potential for political
conflict, but these are all understudied. The largest contributor to
risk from SAI is that another catastrophe---whether it be nuclear war, a
solar flare, or mass pandemic---would knock out the system, leading to
warming that would otherwise takes decades, rushing in within years.
Hence, SAI shifts the risk distribution. The median-case scenarios are
potentially less severe than the impacts of climate change. But the
worst case is intensified. SAI, if it is used to cover significant
amounts of warming, would constitute a planetary sword of Damocles.44
Large amounts of warming and monumental Earth-engineering may not be
needed to trigger catastrophe. Historically, minor climatic
perturbations and droughts appear to have contributed to the dissolution
of dozens of empires and kingdoms, ranging from the Bronze Age world
system to the Khmer Empire, Western Roman Empire, and Assyrian Empire.45
Yet many proved resilient to similar stresses. For instance, the Mayan
city-state of Caracol experienced two similar droughts during its
lifespan, one of which it navigated with few signs of breakdown, and the
other which coincided with a rapid and enduring crisis. The largest
difference appears not to be the severity of the drought, but that
Caracol was riven by warfare and inequality when it hit the second
time.46

\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUME\>\>

[[Risk cascades]{.underline}]{.mark} still largely [exist
under]{.underline} a fog of [uncertainty]{.underline}. Studies currently
suggest that [climate change can **worsen** and trigger **conflicts**
under]{.underline} conditions such as [weak governance]{.underline} and
ethnic divisions,47 although we do not know how this relationship could
morph under higher temperatures. Similarly, temperature does seem to
have an innate and often non-linear relationship with economic growth48
and even population spread and density. It has been suggested that
humans, much like other species, have a fundamental climatic
niche---that is, a specific climate envelope of approximately 13°C (mean
annual average temperature) that the majority of human population and
urban areas have developed within over millennia.49 Perhaps the best
study to date on risk cascades and feedbacks used 41 studies to
empirically sketch the links between climate change, [**[food
insecurity]{.mark}**, and societal collapse]{.underline} (population
loss through conflict, mortality, and emigration).50 Other researchers
in global catastrophic risk have also begun putting forward frameworks
for more complex risk assessments,51 including for climate change52 and
international governance.53 For now, far greater attention and research
is needed on these systemic effects, such as [climate triggering
[conflict]{.mark}, **political change**, or]{.underline} even
[**[financial crises]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Indeed, understanding 'societal fragility' is a key part of the Climate
Endgame research agenda, alongside exploring long-term extreme Earth
System states, modelling mass mortality and morbidity, and undertaking
integrated climate catastrophe assessments, which include climate change
alongside a host of other catastrophic threats and vulnerabilities.30

An existential end?

Could global environmental collapse cause human extinction? This leads
us to the central question: could combined ecological crises cause this
to be humanity's final century? Few have been bold enough to directly
broach the question. There have been many prophesied warnings,
especially within the collapse literature, but no truly comprehensive
scientific assessments. Questions of catastrophe are not directly
addressed by any relevant, international scientific institutions, such
as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) or
Intergovernmental Panel on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES).

Many individual papers have mentioned the catastrophic potential of
climate change. [**[Peer-reviewed]{.mark}** academic
**[studies]{.mark}**]{.underline} have [[referred
to]{.underline}]{.mark} global [[warming as]{.mark} an]{.underline}
"[**[existential]{.mark}** threat]{.underline}",5 "beyond catastrophic"
(for above 5°C),54 and "an indisputable global catastrophe" (for above
6°C).55 While the impacts of climate change alone seem capable of
causing a global catastrophic risk, the authors never spell out how the
world would fall from such impacts to mass mortality. Importantly, the
gloomy terms are never defined, leaving it unknown as to whether the
authors believe that certain levels of warming could plausibly lead to
human extinction. These are no studies nor proofs of existential risks
from climate change, but rather indications of a lack of shared
terminology.

In lieu of sustained scientific attention, the most poignant
examinations have come from popular books. Mark Lynas in Our Final
Warning concludes, based on a large-scale review of the existing
scientific literature, that 4°C could threaten a global collapse, and
5--6+°C could unravel into human extinction.56 David Wallace-Wells in
The Uninhabitable Earth guesses that, in contrast to the title, the
Earth will not become uninhabitable, and humans will survive foreseeable
levels of warming.57 Toby Ord in The Precipice suggests a 1 in 1000
chance of climate change resulting in an existential catastrophe.58
William MacAskill in What We Owe the Future suggests that "it's hard to
see how even this could lead directly to civilizational collapse".59 The
assessments by existential risk scholars---Ord and MacAskill--- have
been the least convincing thus far. Ord uses an unworkable, ambiguous
definition of existential risk.60 He defines an existential risk as one
that "threatens the destruction of humanity's longterm potential".
However, what our potential is depends on one's values. Ord suggests
that we minimise existential risks first and then determine "our
potential" through a "Long Reflection". This would essentially be a
centuries-long worldwide philosophical conversation. This strategy
creates a paradox: we are supposed to minimise risks to a concept that
we cannot define until after we have reduced those risks. It is
difficult---if not impossible--- to assess climate change using this
definition, as Ord doesn't explicitly state his values, nor what "our
potential" is. His analysis misses much of the most recent science and
does not sufficiently consider 'indirect' impacts. Moreover, the chapter
does not cogently answer the question of whether climate change will
result in human extinction. Instead, after roughly estimating the direct
impacts, Ord concludes that they will not make the entirety of Earth
uninhabitable. This is an entirely different question to the likelihood
of climate change causing human extinction. Ord's use of a precise
numerical figure is also largely baseless. As noted earlier, even groups
of the best super-forecasters making predictions on clearly defined
questions have little accuracy after 12 months.61 MacAskill's analysis
is also riddled with problems. Like Ord, he suffers from definitional
problems. He defines 'civilisational collapse' as society losing the
ability to create most industrial and post-industrial technologies.62
This has little relation to more common definitions of societal
collapse. It also assumes that we know the full range of potential
industrial and post-industrial technologies. Worse still, like with
Ord's analysis, it replaces the question of whether climate change will
cause civilisational collapse with an easier one: will climate change
make large-scale agriculture on Earth impossible? MacAskill concludes
no. Once again, this is a different question. In short, the coverage of
climate change by the most prominent existential risk scholars has been
simplistic and disappointing. While brave, the conclusions of
Wallace-Wells and Lynas are ultimately individual guesses with multiple
shortcomings. WallaceWells is unclear about how he reaches his
conclusion. Lynas relies on geological studies and the analogous example
of the End-Permian Extinction. His more pessimistic assessment appears
the most compelling. It has the most thorough grounding in the
literature and, in the face of deep uncertainty, relies on the most
reliable and relevant geological precedents. This is astute, given that
studies suggest that mass extinction events work by a threshold effect
for temperature or carbon that we look likely to exceed. One analysis
from 2021 found that warming of 5.2°C would likely result in a mass
extinction event, even without considering the other anthropogenic
impacts on the Earth.63 Another study suggested that the threshold for
carbon release to result in a mass extinction event would be crossed by
most IPCC scenarios by the end of the century (assuming a 50%
uncertainty range, we may have already crossed this precipice).64 Yet,
these investigations suffer from the same problem, one that plagues the
entire study of global catastrophe and human extinction: a lack of
proven or reasonable tools and methods for discerning when a crisis
could spiral into global calamity. Few attempts have been made, with the
notable exception of the societal collapse and climate review conducted
by Richards et al., which does attempt to cautiously trace out some
pathways from impacts to conflict and mass mortality.65 Notably, these
deal only with climate change and not the broader, reinforcing web of
ecological crises, which has received less attention. The short answer
is that we do not know whether climate change or anthropogenic
ecological disruption could spiral into human extinction. However, this
is true for all the suspected causes of human extinction. Climate and
ecological crises do appear to have one of the most concerning profiles,
given their range of impacts, as well as their role in past
mass-extinction events and periods of historical turmoil. There are
enough reasons to take this question of human extinction from ecological
breakdown seriously. For now, while uncertainty remains, it seems
improbable that human actions could extinguish the biosphere. Another
mass-extinction event is plausible, but complete annihilation of the
biological realm is likely not. Barring science fiction, the only
semi-plausible direct route for human activities to terminate all
biological life is the triggering of a runaway greenhouse effect. Lynas
has suggested that such a scenario is possible, if there are hidden,
extreme positive feedback loops in the climate system, an enormous,
profligate use of fossil fuels, and increasing solar radiation.66 Some
basic modelling of the climate system has suggested that a runaway
greenhouse effect is plausible.67 This is further supported by recent
modelling of potential cloud feedbacks leading to a moist greenhouse.68
However, these studies are based on high-level models with many
assumptions. The current scientific consensus is that any hellish
mechanism--- which could lead to a furnace Earth, complete with
evaporated oceans--- is highly unlikely. In 2009, the IPCC reported, in
its 31st meeting, that a "runaway greenhouse effect" analogous to Venus
appears to have virtually no chance of being induced by anthropogenic
activities.69 Whether this view continues to hold, given the new
modelling outcomes, is unclear. For now, while extinguishing the entire
web of life seems far less likely than causing human extinction, it is
an outcome that cannot be entirely ruled out. If humans were to go
extinct, it is likely that global ecological collapse would be one of a
series of drivers. Imagine a world where, in 2075, we have reached 4°C
of warming. The climate system was more sensitive than expected, and new
energy-hungry machine learning algorithms led to higher-than-expected
energy demand. After a category 6 hurricane hits New York City, NATO
(led by the US) deploys a global stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI)
system. This enflames international tensions and stokes domestic unrest
in societies already awash with disinformation driven by deep-fakes and
other high-level machine learning applications. A nuclear war breaks out
and the ensuing nuclear winter knocks out the SAI system. The few
billion survivors emerge from nuclear winter to be faced by soaring
temperatures as the Earth warms by 4.5°C in the space of decades.
Sources of sustenance beyond agriculture, such as marine fish stocks,
have been significantly affected by transgressing other planetary
boundaries such as ocean acidification, biosphere integrity, and
biogeochemical flows. The rapid changes in temperature cause significant
changes in wildlife distribution, triggering new zoonotic pandemics.
Simultaneously, the unplanned emergency evacuation of one biosafety
level 4 (BS4) facility just prior to the nuclear conflict led to the
release of a modified version of the previously defeated smallpox virus.
The survivors are ingenious and resilient but fail to recapture the
right industrial technologies required to put an SAI system back online.
Many have intentionally turned away from industrial technologies after
the fall. Those that try are faced with the problem of energy return on
investment: easily accessed fossil-fuel reserves have already been
depleted and the leftovers are too costly to use at scale. After a long
fight, the final sapien takes her \[their\] last breath. She is a Māori
woman, living on the outskirts of modern-day Dunedin (New Zealand). Her
body, riddled with the scars of an altered smallpox strain and signs of
malnourishment, finally gives out. Humanity is extinguished. This is one
speculative and indicative example of an extinction scenario. Yet it
touches on an important point. That is, asking the question of 'is
climate change or ecological breakdown an existential risk?' is
ultimately simplistically misleading. No single hazard is an existential
risk. In the scenario outlined above, a global society marked by high
levels of equality, international cooperation, and adaptive technology
could have potentially weathered the same ecological conditions. Whether
our combined global environmental crises could spiral into extinction
depends on human responses and wider trends and vulnerabilities (such as
inequality). Climate change and planetary boundaries challenge the
traditional, simplistic approach of thinking of existential risk as a
simple set of disconnected hazards. Indeed, no single hazard is likely
to result directly in human extinction. The search for one single event
to kill us all will lead us to science fiction.70 We should instead
think of the overall level of risk that arises from any particular
socio-economic system (such as the current fossil-fuel-driven,
globalised, capitalist economy). Answering the question of whether
climate change is an existential risk is a futile inquiry until we
develop reasonable definitions of existential risk, a topic we turn to
next. Limits to growth as an existential saviour and threat Can we grow
into catastrophe, collapse, or even human extinction? There is a rising
scholarly debate over whether continued economic growth is compatible
with living on Earth---or even desirable. This debate dates back to at
least the 1970s with the publication of the Club of Rome's Limits to
Growth report.71 The report relied on a computerbased systems model,
which was (at the time) state-of-the-art. The model attempted the
ambitious task of modelling the global economy. Repeated runs of the
model led to a chilling observation: any simulation with continued,
unabated population and economic growth eventually led to a global
collapse in industrial output and population. A study conducted some 30
years later ran the model again with updated data, finding that it
fitted trends over the last three decades remarkably well.72 The Limits
to Growth thesis has been a source of heated debate. Proponents of the
'degrowth' approach argue that, to date, no country has decoupled
material consumption from economic growth,73 that limiting warming to
1.5°C or 2°C will require contractions in energy demand (and likely
economic activity) which are incredibly challenging to achieve alongside
continued economic growth, that infinite growth is impossible on a
finite planet,74 and that growth brings neither happiness nor human
flourishing.75 Critics argue that degrowth ---even if combined with
redistribution---will condemn the world to low living standards,76 that
absolute decoupling between emissions and economic activity is already
proving possible,77 and that the limits to growth will lie well beyond
Earth due to the inexhaustible resource of human ingenuity. The debate
is likely unresolvable: no amount of empirical evidence can falsify the
potential power of future innovation and invention. Similarly, no amount
of evidence can verify the Limits to Growth trajectory until we are
amidst a collapse. Strangely, even if the notion of Limits to Growth is
incorrect, the very idea of it could be an existential risk according to
the traditional definition. This is due to the traditional definition
being odd and idiosyncratic. The canonical definition of existential
risk labels it as a risk that will "annihilate Earth-originating
intelligent life or permanently and drastically curtail its
potential".78 The definition was later refined and specified to mean any
threat that prevents the stable attainment of 'technological
maturity'79---that being the maximum, feasible control over the
environment (including the entire universe) and level of economic
productivity. Technological maturity is not usually envisioned as an
Earth-bound enterprise, but an endeavour of space colonisation by a
post-human species.80 Thus, an existential risk is anything that
threatens this techno-utopian future, including a technological or
economic plateau. Under this classical definition, the idea of Limits to
Growth is an existential risk: if it is correct then continued growth
trends could result in catastrophe, as indicated by the modelling study.
Yet, regardless of whether the thesis is true or not, if we act to limit
human activities and stay within planetary boundaries, we would also
face an existential risk under the canonical definition by not reaching
a techno-utopian future. This says much more about the flaws and
problems of these definitions of existential risk than it does about the
desirability of limiting economic growth or the validity of the limits
to growth idea. If we are going to have a mature, scientific field then
we need better definitions. We should start by splitting out questions
of existential ethics (what humanity's potential is, and the value of
different longterm futures) and extinction ethics (the goodness or
badness of human extinction) from the study of global catastrophic and
extinction risk.81 Existential risk cannot be tied to one idiosyncratic
view of the future nor such vagaries as 'our potential'. We also need to
have a more refined concept of risk. Risk is not a single hazard like a
biologically engineered pandemic. It is the likelihood of an adverse
outcome, given exposure to certain conditions. For instance, we should
think of extinction risk as the overall likelihood of humans going
extinct in a particular period, and extinction threats as major
contributors to this overall level of risk. The 2022 Climate Endgame
paper puts forward a set of definitions reflecting this way of thinking,
and a suggested full spectrum of calamity from global decimation risk
through to human extinction.30 Hope in the heat: Responsibility and
responses Responsibility: Tragedy of the elite, not the public The
responsibility for most ecological crises is concentrated. From the lens
of national emissions, just ten historical emitters account for over 75%
of cumulative international emissions.82 For extraction, just six
countries and one region of 18 countries account for over three quarters
of fossil-fuel reserve.83 Similarly, there is growing evidence that
material consumption and consumption norms for wider society are driven
by a narrow supper-affluent elite.84 The influence of the wealthiest is
not just in norms, but also direct carbon inequality. Recent research
from Oxfam suggests that the richest 1% of individuals globally emit
more than double that of the poorest half of humanity. From 1990--2015,
the cumulative emissions share of the richest 1% and 10% of the world
were 15% and 52% respectively. The skewed distribution for
responsibility exists in areas outside of emissions.85 One recent
analysis suggests that the corporate financing of the deforestation of
the Amazonian Basin is enabled by a handful of key investment firms.86

\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUME\>\>

The lack of policy responses is also a concentrated affair. For climate
change, a collection of organisations and [individuals funded by [the
fossil-fuel **industry**]{.mark} has]{.underline} deliberately
**[[undermined]{.underline}]{.mark}** public [trust in]{.underline}
climate [**[science]{.mark}** and strangled the policy
response]{.underline}. For decades, the fossilfuel industry has [funded
scientists and firms]{.underline}---and even set up fake community
groups---[to muddy the science of climate change]{.underline}. These are
the well-funded and well-documented 'Merchants of Doubt'.87 This was
combined with the [**suppression** of]{.underline} in-house [climate
**research** from]{.underline} several [fossil-fuel
giants]{.underline}.88 [[Through]{.underline}]{.mark} other actions,
such as [[**lobbying** and political
**subterfuge**]{.underline}]{.mark}, the fossil-fuel industry has played
a central role in [**delaying** and distorting **efforts** to reduce
emissions]{.underline} over the past three decades.89 Exxon, through the
International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association
(IPIECA), has coordinated efforts across the industry to both discredit
the science and stop international climate policy since the 1980s.90
Neither emissions nor the lack of a policy response can be easily tied
to the global public. The idea that 'we are all to blame' was, instead,
part of an intentional rhetorical strategy from ExxonMobil and others to
shift responsibility to consumers.91 The threat is not humanity writ
large. Rather, it is from a small, powerful band who overwhelmingly
profit from the global machinery of extraction. It is largely a matter
of public risks and private benefits.

Why is responsibility important? Does identifying, or targeting, the
culprits behind ecological devastation bring us closer to solutions?
Yes, of course it does. Across different risks and risk determinants
(hazards, vulnerabilities, exposures, and responses), there are often
common drivers.92 Striking these common roots is a far more effective
long-term solution than attempting to grapple with the symptoms. This is
not just true for climate change. For all anthropogenic catastrophic
hazards, the responsibility is concentrated, and the powerful producers
(the 'Agents of Doom') of these threats have played a starring role in
thwarting societal responses.93 Ironically, these actors also tend to
disproportionately benefit from the execution of emergency powers during
crises.94 Addressing risk will ultimately mean dealing with and
curtailing the political power of these actors. This should be a source
of hope. The concentrated nature of responsibility means interventions
should be easier to target and implement. It also means that reducing
catastrophic risks could have the co-benefit of creating a more equal
world.

The co-benefits of avoiding global ecological catastrophe

Global catastrophe is rarely a matter for optimism. For anthropogenic
hazards, such as advanced algorithmic systems and synthetic biology, the
hyped benefits are disconnected from their risk mitigation. They are
dual use, and a common view is that we will either self-capitulate with
them or achieve technological salvation. However, there may be many
co-benefits from not developing certain technologies. For example,
avoiding the rapid development and deployment of AI systems would not
just avert fears overreaching unaligned superintelligence, but also
nearer-term concerns over surveillance and disinformation. However, this
is rarely discussed and is usually dismissed as being impossible or not
worth the loss of the potentially beneficial applications.

Ecological risks represent a different matter altogether. They are an
area where risk mitigation does not just involve building a safer world,
but also one with greater welfare and health. This is the increasingly
convincing story told by the 'co-benefits' literature. It is an area of
study that has swelled since the publication of Our Final Century. The
message from most studies is that the mitigation of environmental
problems---most notably climate change---yields many benefits, including
improved health, economic performance, employment, and energy
security.95 Once these benefits are accounted for, the economics
fundamentally shift: avoiding climate change is likely to result in net
economic benefit, regardless of the warming averted. The same calculus
applies to ecosystem services. Estimates of global ecosystem services
place their value at equal to or greater than double global GDP---for
instance, approximately \$125 trillion in 2011,96 a finding that should
be entirely unsurprising given that all economic activity is dependent
on a functioning Earth System.

Most actions to cut emissions are 'no-regrets' options. This is
uncontroversial and well known for measures such as energy efficiency.97
What is less widely known, but increasingly clear, is that this holds
for a much greater suite of actions, including vehicle electrification
and renewable energy. Overall, decarbonization already appears cheap,
and the projected costs tend to fall with each new assessment due to the
plummeting price of renewable energy.98 When the co-benefits and
co-harms are included in an economic analysis, then optimal climate
policy---which could be compatible with 2°C or 1.5°C, depending on our
risk adversity and how we value human health---becomes an automatic net
benefit.99 There are other potential trade-offs that we must be
cognisant of, including the loss of marginalised workers in the
fossilfuel sector, disproportionate impacts on indigenous communities
for resource extraction, and the potential for resource exhaustion. This
has led to calls for a just transition.100 This is an admirable and
necessary approach. Nonetheless, the potential downsides of
decarbonisation are still far less disturbing and costly than
fossil-fuel extraction.

The net benefit of mitigation is largely due to the dark, externalised
costs of fossil fuels, most notably on human health. According to one
estimate, in 2012, particulate matter from the combustion of fossil
fuels caused approximately 10.2 million excess deaths. In 2018, such
deaths account for approximately 18% of global deaths.101 This is only
mortality. The cost is even higher when lost productivity and sickness
are considered. These overall health costs are enormous. Even in the US,
the health costs of coal-fired power are likely 0.8--5.6 times the value
added to the economy.102 Globally, the health effects of fossil fuels
could justify a carbon price of \$50--380.103

[There are]{.underline} also a range of [other]{.underline} potential
[advantages]{.underline} that are rarely included in naïve cost-benefit
calculations. Chief among these is [avoiding the geopolitical
quagmire]{.underline} caused [by]{.underline} fossil-fuel supply.
[[Securing **oil**]{.mark} supply]{.underline} has been [a]{.underline}
suspected [**cause** of]{.underline} many [military **interventions**
[in the Middle East]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} including the Iraq
War.104 [These have had dramatic]{.underline} knock-on
[effects]{.underline} politically and socially, whether it be
contributing to the rise of ISIS or potentially [[trigger]{.mark}ing
**[new wars]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Even without these costly and
corrosive excursions, the price of securing oil is high. The US alone
spends a minimum of \$81 billion on protecting its oil supply chain.105
Decarbonisation will bring about its own set of geopolitical challenges,
including the potential of new [races]{.underline} for---and conflict
[over]{.underline}---precious **[Earth metals]{.underline}** and
minerals that will fuel the transition to renewable energy, but these
[will likely be far **less** toxic and **dangerous** than]{.underline}
that of [fossil fuels]{.underline}.

The vessel Akademik Lomonosov---named after an 18th-century Russian
scientist, and anchored off Russia\'s Arctic coast---is a surprising
place [to find the **future** of nuclear energy]{.underline}. Yet for
now, the barge is home to the world\'s only operating small modular
reactor (SMR), a nuclear plant that produces enough electricity to power
a city of about 100,000 people.

[[SMRs are]{.mark} a relatively **nascent** concept]{.underline}, but
judging by the backers lining up behind it, that won\'t be the case for
much longer. Newly elected US President Joe Biden has already signaled
that [they have a **[key]{.mark}** role [to]{.mark} play in
the]{.underline} world\'s biggest economy\'s US\$2 trillion [investment
in [clean energy]{.mark}]{.underline}, while UK Prime Minister Boris
Johnson has also said he\'ll pour money into the concept. And it\'s not
just governments; companies including EDF---the world\'s biggest
operator of atomic plants--- and Rolls-Royce are championing the future
role of the SMR.

[SMRs are now [gaining the **attention** of governments]{.mark} and
power providers across the world [because]{.mark} of the **optionality**
they offer. [They]{.mark} can [provide **reliable**]{.mark} energy in
the form of both [electricity and heat]{.mark}. The heat can help
**[lower]{.mark}** the **[emissions]{.mark}** from carbon-intensive
industries such as steel [and]{.mark} cement making, while the power
[offers **baseload energy**]{.mark} that can help [underpin]{.mark} more

The SMR [offers a [**step change** from]{.mark} the [existing]{.mark}
world of [nuclear]{.mark} power]{.underline}.

In 1954, the Soviet Union started the world\'s first nuclear power
plant, sending nuclear-generated electricity to a power grid, [creating
a whole new industry]{.underline} that promised [[to deliver]{.mark} a
[never-ending supply of **reliable** power]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet
that dream has faced challenges to deliver on its potential. Despite
nuclear being a safe, carbon-free source of energy, the [[cost]{.mark}
and [scale]{.mark} of projects, along with major
[incidents]{.mark}]{.underline} at Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and
Fukushima, have [[threatened to undermine the industry]{.mark}. However,
the arrival of the [SMR offers a **solution**]{.mark} to many of these
**issues**]{.underline}.

400 nuclear power reactors are in operation around the globe

The case for nuclear

[[Nuclear reactors]{.mark} generate virtually **emission-free** power,
which means they can play a crucial role in global efforts to lower
emissions and [reach]{.mark}]{.underline} the Paris [**[climate
goals]{.mark}**. The global power sector accounts for approximately
one-third of global emissions, with the burning of fossil fuels still
the dominant source]{.underline}. The role of renewable energy

Introduction

[Renewables are considered by many to be the solution to global warming.
Yes, they can contribute. However, [without advanced nuclear energy, we
will **not solve** global **warming**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Nuclear]{.mark} energy [is **much safer** than]{.mark} solar and wind
[renewables and has a **lower**]{.mark} life cycle carbon
**[footprint]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The disadvantage of nuclear is its
long-lived nuclear waste. To decay to a nominal background level, legacy
spent nuclear fuel requires tens of thousands of years. This paper
argues for [advanced nuclear]{.underline}, whose [[much smaller amount
of]{.mark} nuclear **[waste]{.mark}**]{.underline} (about 1% of legacy)
[will decay to background levels]{.underline} in about 400 years \[1\].

It is important to note that [legacy nuclear waste has **minimal risk**
associated with it]{.underline} \[2\]:

• [There is not much of it]{.underline}. All the nuclear fuel waste
generated thus far, on the planet, could be stacked onto one football
field to a height of about 30 feet.

• [It is a solid, in small pellets contained in metal rods, stored
inside ultrastrong 50-ton containers. With advanced nuclear, this
minimal risk is reduced further]{.underline} (Table 1).

[[Solar and wind are **not really** renewable]{.mark} on a 200-year
timescale. [Neither is legacy nuclear]{.mark} via current landbased
uranium mining.]{.underline} Arguments have also been made that [legacy
nuclear is not safe]{.underline}.

[[Advanced nuclear]{.mark} technology [is **far safer**]{.mark} than
legacy nuclear. The current widespread **[fear]{.mark}** of nuclear,
which [is]{.mark} based on legacy nuclear accidents, is
**[unwarranted]{.mark}**]{.underline} \[11\]:

\[TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMMITTED\]

• There were no deaths and no negative health effects from the trivial
radiation release from the Three Mile Island accident. • At Fukushima,
one power plant worker involved in recovery died. There were no deaths
or incidents of medical harm to any member of the public from radiation
exposure. Four years later, thorough medical examinations were given to
evacuees from the designated exclusion zone and many concerned residents
from outside the exclusion zone. Nearly a third of a million children
who were age 18 or less at the time of the accident were screened for
thyroid issues. The rate of thyroid anomalies in Fukushima children was
less than in other children in Japan. • Chernobyl was a poorly designed
light water boiling reactor susceptible to thermal runaways. Reported
fatalities ranged from 50 at Chernobyl to several thousand offsite
\[12\]. Following the Chernobyl accident, other Russian RBMK designs
were modified to improve safety. Some RBMK plants have been shut down
but not all. No nuclear plants have been built with this design outside
of the Russian federation \[13\]. Advanced nuclear technology There is
only one naturally occurring fissile isotope, Uranium-235 (U235). In a
nuclear reactor, U235 atoms split and produce heat. There are two
naturally occurring fertile isotopes, Uranium-238 (U238) and Thorium-232
(Th232). They will not split until they first transmute to fissile
isotopes via neutron capture, which does not occur to a significant
extent in a legacy reactor. In an advanced reactor, U238 and Th232
transmute to fissile isotopes Pu239 and U233, which then split to
produce heat. As with any new technology, there are challenges
associated with Th232, including the production of a small amount of
U232 contaminant in the transmutation of Th232. The decay of U232
produces very penetrating gamma rays. These gamma rays are hard to
shield, requiring more expensive spent fuel handling and/or reprocessing
\[14,15\]. Key distinctions between legacy technology and advanced
technology: 1. A legacy reactor is designed at about 2000 psig. An
advanced reactor is designed at near-ambient pressure as the normal
boiling points of heat-transfer media exceed 1200 °C. A huge gain in
safety. 2. A legacy reactor operates at about 290 °C. An advanced
reactor operates at 550--750 °C, creating a much larger temperature
difference with the environment, which allows more options for passive
decay--heat removal systems. A huge gain in safety. 3. Advanced reactors
operating at 550--750 °C allow for industrial process heating \[16,17\].
4. Most legacy fuel is U238, which becomes nuclear 'waste' in legacy
reactors. In advanced reactors, U238 transmutes to Pu239 that 'burns'
along with U235, resulting in a waste volume of less than 1% of that
from legacy reactors. A huge gain in safety. 5. 'Waste' from legacy
reactors requires tens of thousands of years to decay. Waste from
advanced reactors requires about 400 years. A huge gain in safety. 6.
Advanced reactors operate with a negative temperature coefficient. They
are not susceptible to thermal runaway such as what happened at
Chernobyl. Advanced reactors passively shut down if the reactor
temperature gets too high. A huge gain in safety. Are solar and wind
renewable? Solar and wind have renewability problems due to planetary
mineral resource limits \[8\], the social impact of mining those
resources \[18\], and mineral recycling challenges at end of equipment
useful life \[19\]. We are disingenuous if we do not look at least 200
years into the future. Psychologists say that a human is sincerely
concerned with his/her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren.
Beyond those three generations, most humans do not care what happens to
distant progeny. I may have great-grandchildren born as far out as my
100th birthday in 2050, and they might live 100 years. Our action plan
must be at least 200 years out. Owing to the variability of solar and
wind, 100% 'renewable' plans depend on energy storage. Battery storage
is the hope. Lucas Bergkamp, Editor of Road to EU Climate Neutrality by
2050, does not hold that view. "You cannot, in the near future at least,
have an energy storage system that will allow you to power a whole
country through batteries," he told EURACTIV, saying another energy
source, such as nuclear or fossil fuels, will be needed to provide
baseload electricity \[20\]. Advanced nuclear energy Rehm 3

39:100878 Solar is challenged in far northern latitudes. Earth's 'center
of population' latitude is 25.92 degrees north. At that latitude, solar
irradiation on the winter solstice is reduced by 35%. One-fourth of
Earth's population lives above 36.37 degrees north latitude,
corresponding to a reduction of solar irradiation by 50% on the winter
solstice \[21,22\]. Sunlit hours also drop with increasing latitude. As
the earth heats up, the population will undoubtedly shift farther north,
exacerbating the solar energy 'solution'. Fewer people will live in
areas that are good for solar generation of electricity. A nuclear plant
can operate anywhere. But is not nuclear too costly? Nuclear is a better
choice than solar and wind on both a land requirement basis and a
consumer cost basis \[20\]. Overly optimistic views of solar and wind,
coupled with an unfounded fear of nuclear, are leading many to shutter
legacy nuclear plants. The United States currently has 296 GW of nuclear
energy capacity. If we do not keep these plants open through license
renewals, we will lose 50 GW of nuclear capacity by 2030, 150 GW by
2040, and nearly all of it by 2050 \[23\]. We must not shut down legacy
nuclear plants.T Advanced nuclear energy is truly renewable Although
proven uranium reserves only give legacy technology 90 more years,
advanced technology is good for thousands of years. Uranium ore contains
100 times more U238 than U235. Advanced nuclear can theoretically
provide 9000 years of renewable energy from those reserves at today's
energy demand, and that is not taking into account the legacy nuclear
'waste' now safely stored, which can become fuel for advanced reactors.
Advanced technology can be commercially viable in the United States by
the 2030s. In 2001, nine nations formed the Generation IV2 International
Forum (GIF) \[24\] to develop sustainable, economic, safe, reliable,
proliferation-resistant, and physically protected nuclear reactors.
Founding GIF countries include Argentina, Brazil, Canada, France, Japan,
the Republic of Korea, the Republic of South Africa, the United Kingdom,
and the United States. Subsequently, Switzerland (2002), Euratom (2003),
the People's Republic of China (2006), the Russian Federation (2006),
and Australia (2016) became members. There are now two operational
advanced reactors, one in Russia and one in China. The Russian BN-800
reactor, a sodium-cooled fast breeder reactor, in Zarechny, was
connected to the grid in December 2015 \[25\]. China's high-temperature
pebble-bed modular reactor HTR-PM was connected to the grid in December
2021 \[26\]. The United States is lagging, but work is underway to catch
up. US Department of Energy (DOE) made two awards to build advanced
reactors by 2027 \[27\], one to TerraPower \[28\] on Natrium technology,
and the other to Xenergy \[29\]. TerraPower is working to commercialize
three technologies, the molten chloride reactor, the Traveling Wave
Reactor, and the Natrium reactor that is a sodium fast reactor
incorporating the design features of the Traveling Wave Reactor. Natrium
is its premier technology, which will be demonstrated at the Naughton
coal-fired power plant in Kemmerer, Wyoming, which is retiring in 2025.
X-energy has a moving pebble-bed high-temperature gas reactor (HTGR)
design that will have 220 000 graphite pebbles with
TRIstructural-ISOtropic (TRISO) particle fuel. They expect a 60-year
operational life \[30\]. How about thorium? Per the Thorium Energy
Alliance \[31\]: • Because liquid fluoride thorium reactors (LFTRs) burn
virtually all of their fuel, 83% of the waste products are safe within
ten years and the remaining 17% become safe after 300 years. • LFTRs can
be used to burn legacy nuclear 'waste'. • Thorium is the 36th most
plentiful element in the earth's crust. It is four times as common as
uranium. • LFTRs have no refueling outages. They are continually
refueled and continually remove waste product. • LFTRs can be
factory-produced, allowing for lower costs and shorter commissioning
timetables. Kirk Sorensen, Founder of Flibe Energy, details the many
LFTR benefits in a short video, those benefits being safety, a 100-fold
decrease in waste generated, and immense quantities of thorium on the
planet \[1\]. China is a leader in thorium. Experts say that China could
be the first to commercialize thorium technology. An experimental
thorium reactor in Wuwei could result in an operational 300 + MW thorium
reactor by 2030 \[32\]. Centrus Energy Corporation and Clean Core
Thorium Energy are working on an advanced nuclear fuel that combines
thorium with high-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU). The new fuel is
called Advanced Nuclear Energy for Enriched Life (ANEEL). ANEEL has less
than 20% U238, compared with more than 94% in LWR fuel. HALEU is itself
enriched to between 5% and 20% U235 \[33\]. 2 Advanced nuclear
technology is Generation IV. 4 Impact of Climate Change Current Opinion

2022, the Norway-based marine group Ulstein announced a concept design
for cruise ships using a thorium Molten Salt Reactor \[34\].here are
significant advantages of molten salt reactors and hot-salt storage. A
molten salt reactor has its nuclear fuel dissolved in fluoride salt or
chloride salt. The Terrapower/Southern fast reactor is molten chloride.
The Moltex design is a molten chloride fast reactor. Kairos Power has a
fluoride salt reactor design. Flibe's salt is Li2BeF4 salt that has a
melting point of 459 °C and a normal boiling point of 1430 °C \[35\].
Molten salt allows a design with a secondary hot-salt loop with storage
and a separate 'power block' cycle to produce power-on-demand from the
stored hot salt, allowing load following functionality as delivery of
heat is controlled by a hotsalt pump. As the power block is not coupled
to the reactor, it can be built to non-nuclear standards. The salt in
the loop is a nitrate salt in common use in concentrated solar power
plants \[36\]. Although molten salt reactors hold much promise, there
are challenges, the most significant being the risk of corrosion in
reactor structural materials from high-temperature molten salt. A
considerable amount of development work remains to be done on salt redox
potential measurement and control tools in order to limit the corrosion
rate \[37\].

Abstract

[The [decarbonization of the energy industry is]{.mark}]{.underline} one
of [the **[key]{.mark}** pillars [in the reduction of]{.mark} greenhouse
gas **[emissions]{.mark}** in the atmosphere. The energy

(**[[SMRs]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [[are]{.mark} considered an

energy]{.mark} that is comparable to other **renewable** energy

established in the full adoption of and investment in SMRs in developing
nations. A state-of-the-art review of the SMRs is proposed, involving
key issues on technological, economic, environmental, and
socio-political aspects. Methods of aggregating these factors in order
to determine a country's suitability to invest in SMRs have been
explored, while also determining specific areas needing improvement.

Keywords: small modular reactors; multi-criteria decision making;
nuclear energy; state-of-the-art review 1. Introduction Sustainable
Development Goals (SDG) of the United Nations number 7 seeks to ensure
affordable and clean energy for all. The proposed roadmap aims to phase
out coal by 2030 in developed countries that are members of the
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). This goal
was also extended to developing countries, non-OECD, by 2040 \[1\]. This
phase-out process will nonetheless require support, especially for
developing countries. The UN also highlights the fact that about 733
million people lack access to electricity, the majority of whom are in
underdeveloped regions \[2\]. Moreover, SDG 13, which tackles climate
change and its impacts on society, highlights the problems of unabated
rise in greenhouse gas emissions which is attributed to higher economic
activity and sets a target to decrease emissions by 2050. It is
uncontestable that many developing countries require a large increase in
energy supply to fuel their attainment of high-income status. That
growth, when left to the usual fossil-fuel based technologies of energy
production, will make the environmental targets set by the UN
unachievable. Many different technologies have been developed and
invested in in recent years to present an alternative to fossil fuels
such as solar, wind, bioenergy, tidal, and hydro, among others. One of
the alternative energy sources is nuclear energy. Recent technological
advances in nuclear power engineering can potentially replace
fossil-fuel-based power plants as base load providers. While nuclear
energy has been harnessed for energy production since the 1950s \[3\],
plants typically built up to now are large in capacity due to large
capital investments and long construction times. This is a significant
concern especially for a developing country. In addition, the
construction of large reactors (LRs) has seen an overall increase in
capital costs, especially in recent decades \[4\]. This makes it more
challenging for developing countries to acquire this technology and
establish firm foundations for nuclear power plants (NPP). Cooper (2010)
identifies an increase in overnight capital cost from USD 1000 kW for
NPPs built in the early 1970s to USD 5000 kW--USD 6000 \$/kW (all in
2008 dollars) for NPPs built in the early 1990s. Earlier studies have
been done that show that this would lead to cost escalations to as high
as USD 10,000 kW, as far back as 2009 \[5\]. On the other hand, recent
advances in this field have led to the proposed design and construction
of small and medium reactors (SMRs) or small modular reactors. Nuclear
power plants with SMRs have an equivalent electric power generation of
less than 700 MWe. A modular construction method also renders an
advantage, especially in subsequent expansion plans due to economies of
scale. This will make repeated production of SMRs less time-consuming
and less costly \[6\]. However, the decision to start a nuclear program
for energy purposes is not an easy one to make. The choice of technology
is often affected by concerns other than technological factors such as
efficiency and availability. Social issues, economic sustainability, and
environmental stability also influence decision-makers and the community
regarding adoption of NPP. In a webinar organized by the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on 29 April 2021 on the United Arab
Emirates' agenda leading to the introduction of nuclear energy into its
power grid, his excellency Mohamad Al Hammadi, the CEO of Emirates
Nuclear Energy Corporation, emphasized that the key element to success
of its nuclear program was the long-term energy policy that was
envisioned at the time together with its continued government support.
Their journey took them 13 years, which were not entirely focused on
technological aspects of the program, but included social aspects such
as education and social acceptance \[7\]. Nuclear energy is a concern
for many people as witnessed in high-profile incidents such as
Three-Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima. Locatelli et al. (2014)
examined the positive contribution of nuclear energy, particularly of
small modular reactors (SMRs), to employment. However, the impact of the
not-in-my-backyard behavior was noted as a potential hindrance to the
widespread deployment of nuclear energy \[6\]. This attitude brought the
issue of the social acceptance of nuclear energy to the fore. It is an
important social issue that arises from perceived safety concerns that
must be addressed to ensure the technology's sustainability. Iyer et al.
(2014) studied the environmental impact of SMRs and observed that
technological preference and institutional inertia in existing
regulatory frameworks create path dependencies. Preference for proven
technologies also influences decision-making since public information on
the country's technological development along with approval by early
adopters encourages investment. On the other hand, a lack of information
would create uncertainties over nuclear energy's performance and
long-term viability. Other concerns would include safety, waste
disposal, proliferation and terrorism \[8\]. Glaser et al. (2013)
determined proliferation risks of SMRs in relation to its resource
requirements. Integrated Pressure Water Reactors (PWRs), due to their
lower burnup of fuel in comparison to LRs, would have higher
requirements for uranium ore and enrichment services, thus increasing
their proliferation risk by about 45% \[9\]. The question of
environmental impact, especially on the locality where the plants will
be built, is significant as well. This accountability weighs heavily on
the decision-makers, as these decisions will have effects far into the
future. Current reviews on SMRs focus on technological advances being
made in relation to problems the industry is trying to solve. These
reviews briefly touch on other topics that may be related to these
problems. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of
literature centering on issues that accompany the decision to invest in
an SMR, such as those mentioned previously: technical, economic,
socio-political and environmental considerations, and ways in which
these have been used together to determine a country's readiness to
adopt this technology. 1.1. Small Modular Reactors According to the
IAEA, Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) "are newer generation reactors
designed to generate electric power typically up to 300 MW, whose
components and systems can be shop fabricated and then transported as
modules to the sites for installation as demand arises" \[10\]. This
definition provides the key characteristics of SMRs that set them apart
from LRs. Being small, they have much smaller capacities than LRs on a
per module basis and in their construction methods. Being modular, SMRs
contain all the functions and safety features, built-in, to function as
any LR would and are connected to components of typical power-generating
equipment and machinery. On the other hand, the construction of LRs has
seen an overall increase in capital costs, especially in recent decades,
making it harder for developing countries to acquire this technology and
to establish a firm footing in its economic progress. Cooper (2010)
points out an increase in overnight capital costs from USD 1000 kW for
NPPs built in the early 1970s to USD 5000 kW--USD 6000 \$/kW (all in
2008 dollars) for NPPs built in the early 1990s. Studies have been
conducted showing that this will lead to a cost escalation to as high as
USD 10,000 kW. Lovering et al. (2016) examined this trend by compiling
data on nuclear power plants completed up to 2015. The study showed
increases of between 50 and 200% in overnight construction costs for the
USA, France, West Germany, and Canada, while milder variations of
between −17% and 33% were seen for the same costs in Japan, South Korea,
and India \[4\]. While the cost of renewable energy, such as solar PV
and wind energy, have gone down considerably in the last decade, they
consistently suffer from lower utilization due to a lower load factor.
For solar PV, they range from 10 to 25% while wind energy has a range of
21% to 43%. In contrast, thermal and NPPs have an 85% load factor, thus
providing a better return for a limited time investment \[11\]. For this
reason, it is not wrong to think that nuclear energy can actually have
its space in any country's energy mix due to the continuous availability
of energy supply for as long as the fission chain reaction is active.
1.2. Types of SMRs IAEA classifies SMRs that it has on record into six
different types, as is shown in Figure 1. Land-based water-cooled SMRs
are plants that utilize various configurations of light water reactors
and heavy water reactors that are seen in large power plants sited on
land that are in operation today. Marine-based water-cooled SMRs, on the
other hand, are deployed in a marine environment either through a
barge-mounted floating power unit or immersible underwater power unit.
The first SMR operationalized commercially, KLT-40 S, is deployed in
Pevek, Russia for commercial operations of this type. Another type of
SMR is the High-temperature Gas cooled SMRs that provide high
temperature heat which can be used for electricity generation,
industrial applications, and cogeneration. Fast Neutron Spectrum SMRs,
on the other hand, are designs that make use of a fast neutron spectrum
with different coolant options, including sodium, heavy liquid metal,
and helium gas. Molten Salt SMRs, meanwhile, have low-pressure
single-phase coolant systems that eliminate the need for large
containment, a high temperature system that results in high efficiency,
and a flexible fuel cycle. Finally, Micro-sized SMRs are those that
generate electrical power of up to 10 MWe \[10\]. Using the above, one
may see the different criteria in which SMRs may be classified,
according to power, coolant type, neutron energy, and location. Energies
16 03224 g001 550 Figure 1. SMR classification scheme from the IAEA.
Rowinski et al. \[12\] provide a slightly different classification
scheme of SMRs based on generation, neutron spectrum, and coolant. This
scheme is seen in Figure 2. Light Water Reactors (LWRs) are the most
common nuclear designs in the world; these use light water or normal
water as their primary coolant, and most such designs include an
integrated pressurized reactor. A subtype is the pressurized-water
reactor (PWR), which uses two coolant loops, one maintained at a high
pressure and another at a lower pressure. The high-pressure water flows
to a steam generator, where it transfers its thermal energy to the lower
pressure water of a secondary system where steam is generated. The steam
then drives turbines, which spin an electric generator. Heavy Water
Reactors (HWR), on the other hand, use heavy water as a moderator to
control the fissile reaction, with the possible use of light water as a
coolant with fuel using natural or slightly enriched uranium. This
reactor subtype allows for refueling during the reactor operation. The
Supercritical Water Reactor (SCWR) is a reactor type that uses steam in
supercritical conditions, i.e., above 22.064 MPa, with 647 K as a
coolant pumped to the core and then directed to the turbine. This will
result in an increase in efficiency and competitiveness of the power
station. The Liquid Metal Cooled Reactor (LMCR) is a fast reactor that
uses liquid metal as a coolant, without the need for a moderator due to
the use of fast spectrum of neutrons. There are two main approaches to
the design, loop, and pool concept. Under this type are found the
sodium-cooled reactors, lead reactors, and lead bismuth reactors. This
technology can be used as a breeder for nuclear fuel, essentially
closing the nuclear cycle and lessening the issue surrounding nuclear
wastes. Gas Cooled Reactors (GCRs) use gases like helium or carbon
dioxide as a coolant with graphite blocks as a moderator; GCRs represent
the oldest approach to nuclear energy production. Energies 16 03224 g002
550 Figure 2. Classification scheme by technological generations. 1.2.1.
Modularization Modularization can be defined as the "process of
converting the design and construction of a monolithic or stick-built
plant to facilitate factory fabrication of modules for shipment and
installation in the field as complete assemblies" \[13\]. This process
provides economic benefits such as ease of production arising from a
standard factory environment as opposed to on-site fabrication that
requires an investment in on-site fabrication equipment that may possess
lesser capabilities/capacities than factory-based ones. This would
provide the benefit of faster and cheaper production of these modules.
These modules can be assembled on-site in smaller footprints that also
allow for easier (and less expensive) logistics options. Modularization
also increases the prospects of standardization of modules that would
allow for the mass production of these components. The degree of
modularization can also be chosen---they can be completely modularized,
where all modules are fabricated in factories and assembled into
"supermodules" in an assembly area and finally installed as is expressed
in Figure 3. Lesser degrees of modularization may involve on-site
fabrication of some of the parts and assembled in the assembly area
prior to final installation \[14\]. Energies 16 03224 g003 550 Figure 3.
Modularization of production processes of a SMR. However, another form
of implementation of modularization in SMRs to achieve savings is
through the deployment of smaller reactor vessels that can be
interconnected at a later time when the conditions are right. When all
SMR units have been connected, the power plant produces power according
to the sum total of all operating SMR units. Figure 4 shows a possible
scheme of modularization. Energies 16 03224 g004 550 Figure 4.
Modularization of an SMR power station/s. In both cases, there are
advantages to construction that are discussed in the succeeding
sections. 1.2.2. Co-Siting Economies While the first module suffers from
the diseconomy of scale arising from its lower capacity, it is balanced
by the reallocation of fixed costs from this first plant unit to
subsequent units due to their production at the same site. Benefits
arise from placing two or more SMR units in the same area such as
savings from the acquisition of land rights, which would have been spent
in the construction of the first unit \[14,15\]. Co-siting also allows
the sharing of costs, such as training of personnel for the same types
of plants, spare parts, and upgrades. 1.2.3. Learning and Construction
Schedule Due to modularization, SMRs can also potentially harness
learning to reduce significantly the cost of production. Through the
experiences and learning obtained during the construction process and
the use of tools in delivering a product, efficiency and effectiveness
can be improved, which is realized in reduction in costs \[16\]. Through
modularity, it is hoped that SMR manufacturers (and component
manufacturers) can reap the gains obtained from having learned to make
and made the first components, allowing for a more streamlined and
efficient way of fabricating every succeeding component. The concepts of
first-of-a-kind (FOAK) and nth-of-a-kind (NOAK) are important, where the
FOAK are the products that are produced in the first iteration while
NOAK are the iterations that occur much later in the product cycle where
learning gains tend to be much smaller. Moreover, the more immature a
technology is, the more learning can be gained \[17\]. Several methods
of calculating gains obtained through learning have been devised. Among
these methods are those proposed by the NETL \[17\], Wilton \[18\], and
the Nuclear Energy Agency \[19\]. Modularization also affords the
nuclear power plant an early construction completion and an early start
to energy production and sale, due to the smaller-sized modules that can
be produced \[20\]. With an early start, cash inflow may offset the
costs of capital that are incurred in the much longer time frame
required by a fully-functioning LR. Moreover, the capacities can ramp up
together with the growing demand for electricity over time. 1.3.
Bibliometric Survey A bibliometric analysis was carried out using
VOSViewer. Data on articles and reviews were culled from the SCOPUS
database on 10 March 2021 using a combination of keywords related to the
subject. A target number of 300 was set to narrow down the themes into
which further precision can be achieved. After the VOSViewer map was
created, significant branches or thematic areas were identified to
further determine the keywords that can be used to filter the literature
that must be reviewed to make a comprehensive overview of the topic. The
keywords used to make the initial search in SCOPUS were "SMR" and
"Nuclear". The resulting bibliographic data were used in the VOSViewer
application, which resulted in the network map as shown in Figure 5.
Four major color groups were observable: the red contained themes
related to fuel technology; the yellow referred to issues of safety; the
blue nodes tackled issues of heat transfer; and the green nodes were
related to issues of the economics of this particular technology.
Energies 16 03224 g005 550 Figure 5. Network map for "SMR" and
"Nuclear". 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Large Reactors NPPs operate
very similarly to fossil-fuel based plants where the main difference
lies in the manner in which thermal energy is produced. While in
fossil-fuel based plants, energy is released through the combustion of
coal, oil, or gas; meanwhile, energy is released through a nuclear
fission reaction in a reactor vessel in an NPP. The energy is used to
boil water that will be used to produce electricity through a normal
Rankine cycle. Figure 6 shows a simplified scheme of electricity
production in a nuclear power plant. Energies 16 03224 g006 550 Figure
6. Major components of a nuclear power station. 2.2. Sustainability
Triple Bottomline The Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), through their
reporting standards, pushes for a higher level of responsibility of
entities for their impacts. These reporting criteria are encapsulated
into three main areas: economic, social, and environmental, as seen in
Figure 7. These same criteria are contained in the so-called
"sustainability triple bottom-line" that was coined by John Elkington in
1994 and which is synonymous with sustainability assessment, 3 E impact
assessment (equity, equality, environment), extended impact assessment,
and sustainability appraisal methods \[21\]. Considerations of
technologies or projects in these three broad criteria enable a
broad-based assessment of its effects from a larger perspective; e.g., a
lack of understanding of the harmful effects of coal combustion on the
environment may lead to deleterious effects on the health of individuals
in the long run (social), or the destruction of infrastructure resulting
from climate change. Energies 16 03224 g007 550 Figure 7. Sustainability
triple bottom-line framework. 2.2.1. Economics Through the same database
search, keywords relating to economic issues were sought. Primarily for
this study, the combination of "SMR" and "Nuclear" and "Economics" was
used to survey the literature available on the economics issues
surrounding this technology. Typically, the literature would cover
issues related to life-cycle costs, which includes the resulting
levelized cost of electricity, overnight capital investment costs, and
the operating costs. Together with these are the important features of
SMRs that make them attractive from an economic perspective, such as
modularity, learning, co-siting, and its effects on construction
schedules. 2.2.2. Environment The Scopus database was also searched for
literature using the keyword combination "Small Modular Reactors" AND
"Nuclear" AND "Environment", restricted to journal and review articles.
This combination of words served to limit the literature to those
studies that revolved or touched on the issue of environmental issues
related to SMRs. 2.2.3. Socio-Political Finally, the Scopus database was
also searched for literature on social issues that are related to SMRs
in order to complete the analysis that would be required by the
Sustainability Triple Bottomline. For this search, the keyword
combination of "Small Modular Reactors" AND "Nuclear" AND "Social" was
used, limited to journal and review articles. Individual articles that
were not related to nuclear power generation were removed. 2.3. Metrics
in Techno-Economic Modelling 2.3.1. Technology Readiness Levels In the
process of selection of a particular type of technology for an
application, the US Department of Energy instituted a Technology
Readiness Assessment scheme that determines the "Technology Readiness
Level" or maturity of a particular technology. On the other hand, the
IAEA also tracks the different stages in the development of SMRs
following its own scheme. Table 1 shows a compatibility matrix of the
two different schemes as presented by the US DOE and the IAEA. Higher
TRL levels translate to a higher readiness for a technology to be
adapted for use. Table 1. Measures of technology readiness. Table 2.3.2.
Life-Cycle Costs In this section, terms related to the economics of the
construction of nuclear reactors are defined in order to give clarity to
the succeeding review. The capital costs can be distinguished between
two types: Capital Expenditure (CAPEX)---also called the overnight cost,
or the overnight capital cost (OCC), sums the base construction cost,
together with the other owner's costs and contingencies. It is also
called the overnight costs, because the time value of the costs is not
considered, i.e., as if the plant had been constructed overnight in an
instant \[13\]. CAPEX=Construction Cost+Owner's cost+Contingency+Core
Costs (1) Capital Cost, on the other hand, includes the time value of
money or the interest that would have been incurred during construction
\[23\]. Other terms that are defined the same way are the Total Capital
Investment Cost (TCIC). Capital Cost=CAPEX+Interest (2) The O & M
(Operations and Maintenance) costs sum up the expenses related to the
technical, administrative, managerial, and supervisory actions taken to
ensure that an item, such as a plant, is in its proper state so that it
carries out its functions as needed \[24\]. These costs are thus called
the O & M costs. The Operating Expenditure (OPEX) is a combination of
fixed OPEX that pertains to ensuring that the plant is able to generate
energy, and variable OPEX which relates to the costs needed to directly
generate a certain amount of energy that can come in the form of labor,
fuel, disposal, as well as the consequent decommissioning of the plant
\[24\]. OPEX=Fixed O & M+Variable O & M+Fuel+Decommissioning (3) It is
worth noting the importance of decommissioning costs, which at this
point has been highly neglected in studies. Noguchi indicated the
current cost of USD 91 billion of the ongoing decommissioning work on
the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant that suffered a meltdown in
the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami in Japan in 2013 \[25\].
While the aforementioned decommissioning costs are those for a
catastrophic accident such as that of Fukushima, decommissioning costs
play a minimal role for reactors, as they are spread over the entire 60
year lifetime of the plant \[26\]. The Nuclear Energy Agency
approximates the cost of decommissioning for LRs at \$0.01 to \$0.16 MWh
depending on the discount rate. This is for a plant whose
decommissioning cost is equivalent to 15% of the construction cost
\[11\]. Another useful concept that employed in the comparison among
various renewable and non-renewable energy technologies is the levelized
cost of electricity (LCOE) as obtained from a prospective project. The
LCOE compares the overall cost of a project considering its lifetime,
the energy produced during the same lifetime, and the discount rate that
provides a window to the present value of the costs and the electricity
generated. Equations (4) and (5) express this concept, where 𝐸𝑡 is the
sum of all electricity generated throughout the time period 𝑡 being
considered, and 𝑟 as the discount rate. LCOE=NPV of Total Costs over
lifetimeNPV of Electrical Energy Produced over Lifetime (4)
LCOE=∑CAPEX+OPEX(1+𝑟)𝑡∑𝐸𝑡(1+𝑟)𝑡 (5) 2.3.3. Environmental Assessment One
of the most important tools used currently to assess the environmental
impact of a particular technology or product is the life-cycle
assessment (LCA). This technique assesses the environmental impacts,
specifically energy use and CO2-equivalent emissions, during each stage
of a product's life from cradle to grave, which includes raw material
extraction, construction, operations, decommissioning, and disposal. The
LCA methodology can use varying approaches such as end-point modelling,
midpoint modelling, or a combination \[27\]. 2.4. Major Components of an
SMR SMRs replicate in many ways the major components found in LRs that
power nuclear power stations. These are found at the heart of the
station in the reactor vessel where the fuel cores that fuel the chain
reaction are located. This chain reaction produces large amounts of heat
that is used to generate steam and eventually power a turbine to produce
electricity. Note that this is largely similar to any fossil fuel plant
where the only major difference is the source of heat which comes from
the combustion of the said fossil fuel. Figure 1 shows a schematic
diagram of the major components of a nuclear power station. For an SMR
whose reactor vessel is modular, parallel connections can be made
between these vessels that may combine to power a common turbine and
generators that produce power. 3. Comprehensive Review of SMRs 3.1.
Technology In this section, recent developments in relation to the
technological implementations of SMRs are reviewed. Schaffrath et al.
provide us with an overview of the core design developments of SMRs.
Following this summary are technological trends that are attached to the
base design of SMRs in order to heighten its attractiveness as a
technological alternative to other alternative energy sources. There are
currently 72 ongoing SMR development projects at various stages of
completion and intended deployment \[10\], with Argentina, China, and
Russia being the countries at the most advanced stages of development.
Table 2 presents the number of SMR projects at different stages of the
project cycle. Only three have been operational, with only one among
them for commercial operations. The KLT-40 S entered into full
commercial operation in May 2020 and is currently deployed in Pevek,
Russia on a floating nuclear power plant. Table 2. Status of SMR
Projects. Table There has been significant progress with regard to SMR
basic designs. Schaffrath et al. make note of the trends in SMR designs
that facilitate modular construction and of which the major components
are small enough to be produced in a production line and transported
on-site as a single unit. This eliminates the logistical problem of
transporting large components to less populated sites which in many
developing nations, would mean less accessibility arising from smaller
roads. With regard to PWRs, integrated designs have been made in order
to "modularize" them, at the same time introducing safety improvements
by eliminating the need for installation of long lines that carry
potential for accidents. Among the components integrated into this type
of design are the core, pressurizer, steam generators, and main coolant
pumps within the reactor pressure vessel \[28\]. In terms of core
designs, SMR cores will have a fuel cycle of typically two to ten years
before the need for refuelling. This need for refuelling would generally
imply a shutdown, but due to the modular nature of this design the
plant's operation can continue because of the presence of other
operating SMRs. This downtime may be planned and can also minimize the
power required to be supplied while these units are being refuelled
\[28\]. Shirvan and Forrest (2016) presented an alternative concept for
the construction of an organic simplified nuclear reactor for offshore
underwater deployment. Such a reactor would be moderated by graphite,
zirconium hydride, and organic coolant. The conceptual design would
provide a power density of 40 kW/L and a reduction of the reactor hull
size by 40% compared to the PWR designs that can potentially reduce
capital costs \[29\]. On sea-based SMRs, Lee et al. (2015) noted the
progress made on the design and construction of ocean nuclear power
plants that can take the form of floating power plants, gravity-based
structures, and submerged types. The ocean nuclear power plants are
notable for the enhanced safety features that they possess against
tsunamis or earthquakes and their passive cooling systems that are
superior to land-based systems \[30\]. In addition, Santinello et al.
(2016) studied the heat transfer capability of the concept SMR Flexblue,
which is a subsea-based nuclear power unit operating up to 100 m deep
and several kilometers from the shoreline. Such a design concept
provides a certain measure of safety against extreme natural events,
such as earthquakes, tsunamis, etc. A 2D CFD was carried out to confirm
its heat transfer capacity, but further work has to be done from a 3D
approach \[31\]. Testoni et al. (2021), noted the progress made in the
area of microreactors, which are SMRs that have a power output in the
range of 1--20 MWe. The advantages of its small size, the simplicity of
the plant layout, and the fast on-site installation are balanced by its
disadvantages from limited fuel availability, heightened security, and
proliferation process. From an economic point of view, microreactors may
not compete with power plants but rather with those of similar scale,
such as diesel generators and renewable sources in microgrids \[32\].
Zheng et al. (2018) adopted a market-guided design approach to determine
the most appropriate SMR technology considering safety, cost, fuel
availability, and profitability. Among the Gen IV reactor concepts, the
thorium-based reactor presented the most promise with the advantages
offered by thorium. The material is abundant and cheap and offers better
proliferation resistance and reduced long-term radiotoxicity from
transuranic elements \[33\]. Tak et al. (2015) studied the potential of
an ultra-long cycle on a compact liquid metal-cooled fast reactor,
assessing its operational aspect as well as the material performance.
The breed and burn strategy allows for a longer core life with just the
addition of fertile fuel. Ideal fuels were characterized as being of
high thermal conductivity and expansion characteristics, with thorium
given special mention. Meanwhile, sodium is identified as a good coolant
material \[34\]. Bromley (2021), carried out lattice physics
calculations to determine the reactor physics characteristics of
advanced fuel lattices that use hydroxides as coolants and moderated by
graphite and other types of metal hydroxides. The calculations showed
the suitability of hydroxides as coolants and/or external moderators
that can lead to performance improvements for very small and compact
SMRs \[35\]. In order to understand more clearly the behavior of the
coupling of multiple SMRs, Dong et al. (2018) developed a software model
deployed in Matlab to study the open-loop and closed-loop dynamics of
the said plant operation. This model allowed the determination of the
dynamics of each unit under different scenarios including that of power
stepping and large-range power ramping. This will also allow the future
development of operation and control strategies of a nuclear power plant
\[36\]. Hussein (2021) recalled some ideas that can be revisited given
the increasing interest in SMRs. On PWRs, since its idea revolved around
its compactness, the idea of retrofitting fossil-fueled power plants to
take advantage of existing infrastructure and grid connectivity can be
revisited. On HTGRs and Molten Salt Reactors, the research behind these
have existed since the 1960s and therefore should not have any issues
regarding confidence in its technology. On Liquid Metal Cooled Fast
reactors, it was recommended that monitoring of cooling flow be made in
order to detect any flow blockage, as had happened in older generation
reactors \[37\]. Maccari et al. (2021) used the software code ASTEC,
allowing the simulation of the expected main thermal-hydraulic phenomena
that drives the accident sequence through nodalization so that the
system's response may be properly evaluated. The code successfully
simulated the thermal-hydraulic coupling between containment, the RPV,
and passive safety systems, and consequently, the RPV depressurization
and core cooling \[38\]. Trikouros (2011) hypothesized that because
there is a variety of reactor designs, the regulatory structure should
allow for flexibility (technology-neutral) but with the required degree
of safety assurance (risk-informed) \[39\]. Gao et al. (2021) developed
a factorial optimization based SMR siting model in order to deal with
complexities associated with optimizing the siting schemes. The model
took into account certain risk levels depending on the needs, such as
GHG reduction or economics \[40\]. Safety is an important cornerstone in
NPP design, especially when the potential impact in terms of life,
property, and damage is high. Core cooling designs have been adopted as
design principles in Gen III/III+ reactors in order to enhance the
safety features of SMRs. Among them are the reduction of the power
density of the cores, and the use of passive cooling features of the RPV
exterior to ensure retention of the core melt inside the RPV \[28\].
Zeliang et al. (2020), reviewed the current state of PWR designs being
deployed. Configurations characterized by enhanced safety systems and
better reliability are made through simpler designs and reduced number
of components that consequently reduces the sources of accident
initiators. Among these inherent design characteristics are the use of
taller vessels, a larger coolant inventory, lower core power density,
and a larger surface to volume ratio. In addition, Hidayatullah et al.
(2014) discussed the different expected benefits and possible
impediments that SMRs face in its implementation. Among the most
important benefits is safety arising from its already wide safety
margins. However, changes are needed in terms of adequate emergency
planning infrastructure and changes in existing laws and regulations. In
terms of technology, efficiency through technology, automation and
potential for cogeneration were highlighted as key drivers for its
success \[41\]. Schaffrath et al. also point out that an electrical
power output of around 200 MW is low enough to have passive safety
features, via free convection, condensation, and evaporation, that allow
decay heat to be removed, which can be a key characteristic to avoid
severe accidents with core melting \[28\]. Cooling capacities of such
systems can be up to 72 h, although some may even be designed with an
infinite heat sink such as air or water \[42\]. The resulting reduction
in power density and increased safety features allows for a reduction in
emergency planning zones. SMR designs also allow for partial or total
immersion in an underground water wall to increase resilience against
pressure waves such as those experienced by the Fukushima power plant
\[10\]. Yin et al. (2018), modelled a severe accident occurring in an
SMR to determine the core thermal hydraulic response. Results were
obtained on the temperature distribution of the fuel pellets, the fuel
cladding, flow rate of the coolant, and hydrogen mass change over time,
which will be useful for evaluating the safety feature of SMRs and the
residual risks they pose \[43\]. Carless et al. (2018) estimated the
effects of a large lateral surface area-to-volume ratio which is
characteristic of SMRs in the radioactivity of areas surrounding it in
the event of a loss-of-coolant-accident. The study shows a radioactivity
level of 104 ft-3 compared to LRs that are 40--50% higher. This method
can be used for developing a regulatory basis for emergency planning
zones for iPWRs \[44\]. Peakman et al. (2018) investigated the safety
performance of a molten salt micro-reactor compared to a solid moderator
material and conventional solid UO2 fuel. The study showed that the
microreactor's reactivity coefficients were mostly negative, thus
exhibiting acceptable safety performance \[45\]. Fakhraei et al. (2020)
highlighted the potential for instability in SMRs, whereby a station
blackout may cause instability in the primary system for heat removal.
New methods were proposed in utilizing a safety injection tank and using
riser valves to guarantee the stable flow and decay heat removal during
this coping time in the blackout period \[46\]. Research has been done
as well on SMRs' potential to overcome its continuous energy generating
properties, especially when electricity demand is low through
polygeneration. Serra et al. (2009) define polygeneration as the
"combined production of two or more energy services and/or manufactured
products, seeking to take advantage of the maximum thermodynamic
potential (maximum thermodynamic efficiency) of the consumed resources"
\[47\]. To this end, the literature culled in this area examined various
ways in which by-products of the production process of nuclear energy
can be used in order to generate other types of services that would make
this technology more attractive. A basic schematic diagram of how these
services can be combined with an SMR is found in Figure 8. Energies 16
03224 g008 550 Figure 8. Schematic diagram of polygeneration with a SMR.
In the whole context of economics, this would add a different revenue
stream that would further enhance the value of the technology and set it
apart from far simpler renewable energy technologies. SMRs are more
suitable for cogeneration than LRs, because it is possible to switch
some of the SMRs for the cogeneration, and, consequently, SMRs can run
at their full nominal power and maximum conversion efficiency \[48\].
Through polygeneration, issues related to nuclear energy's limitation as
a base load supplier of electricity may also be addressed. Ingersoll et
al. (2014) carried out parametric studies on designs of a 160 MWt
NuScale small modular reactor plant to simultaneously supply electricity
and heat for desalination purposes. The result was an eight-module plant
model that could produce water at 190,000 m3/day and feed electricity to
the main grid between 227--348 MW at an estimated capital cost of USD
1.8 billion \[49\]. Locatelli et al. (2017) conducted a review to
examine the technical and economic feasibility of employing nuclear
power plants as load following options, instead of base load providers
through cogeneration. It was proposed that desalination, district
heating, and the hydrogen production process can be optimized with SMRs
in periods of lower electricity demand by dedicating some SMRs in the
same plant to electricity production and the rest to the cogenerative
process \[50\]. Locatelli et al. (2018) conducted a techno-economic
analysis of using SMRs as a load-following plant by cogeneration with
hydrogen production, using AWE, HTGR and SI technologies. The AWE
technology would provide a profitable scenario at prices greater than
EUR 0.40 Nm3 for hydrogen, while having a low electricity price. HTSE
would be profitable at EUR 0.30--0.45 Nm3 while maintaining an
efficiency degradation rate of 5--10% per year. SI would be potentially
economically feasible at a lower level of EUR 0.30 Nm3 due to its
thermal-only requirement \[51\]. Frick et al. (2019) demonstrated a
design of an SMupled with thermal energy storage to allow nuclear power
to act as a load follower to respond to the variable power supply
demands through the day. The system bypassed steam for ancillary
applications that effectively allowed the reactor to operate
continuously at 100% capacity \[52\]. Wang and Yin (2020) developed a
combined solar-nuclear system for the production of electricity and
desalination of water utilizing a 530 MWth PWR SMR and a concentrated
solar power (CSP) system. The resulting system achieved an output of
electric power of 258.4 MW and electric efficiency of 35.2% at 900 Wm2
of direct normal irradiance (DNI) \[53\]. Ghazaie et al. (2020) studied
various hybrid desalination schemes coupled to SMRs to determine the
best configurations for operation. The study showed that steam from the
low-pressure turbine can be extracted to supply the hybrid desalination
plants, while a part of the relatively hot water of the SMR condenser is
used as feed water for the desalination plant. This setup was seen to
decrease the environmental impact due to lesser feedwater requirements
and a decreased overall cost of between 6.4% and 7.6% \[54\]. Using a
multi-objective optimization study, Baker et al. (2018) showed that in a
hybrid energy system using a 300 MW SMR, a wind generator, a battery,
and a reverse osmosis plant, increases in LCOE caused by higher
volatility in demand and increases in LCOE may be stabilized by the use
of flexible loads. Such flexibility is introduced by such hybrid systems
that can offset costs related to its investment \[55\]. 3.2. Economics A
key consideration of the literature about cost is that there has so far
only been one nuclear power plant employing SMRs that has entered into
commercial operation. Moreover, this unique power plant is operating as
a floating SMR. This is coupled with the fact that the majority of SMR
projects are in the developmental stages. Therefore, the literature as
observed generally seeks to create models and make reasonable estimates
of the cost of SMRs, in the absence of real world costs of SMRs, using
the aforementioned concepts on modularization, co-siting, and learning,
as well as some cost figures that may be inferred from reference nuclear
power plants. This area also serves as a highly important component in
the comparison among long-term investments in non-fossil fuel energy. It
is noted how the costs of other renewable sources of energy have
considerably lowered in the last decade, and studies in the area of
costs will help newcomer countries decide whether to focus its energies
on a particular set of technologies. An important measure of a
technology's attractiveness is its LCOE. To recap, the LCOE compares the
overall cost of a project considering its lifetime, the energy produced
during the same lifetime, and the discount rate that provides a window
to the present value of the costs and the electricity generated. Agar et
al. (2018) used an analytical hierarchy planning method to assess the
rankings provided by nuclear cost experts in determining the most
important cost requirement for SMRs. The factors identified in the study
were externalities, project financing, plant availability, construction
schedule, and direct costs, which showed a marked difference in
importance across different cost experts, e.g., utility owner and
funding agencies \[56\]. Lokhov et al. (2013), analyzed the economics
and market prospects of SMRs. The study found that SMRs can be availed
of with an LCOE of USD 45--80 MWh at a discount rate of 5%; however,
markets will require a large scale serial production in factory
conditions and a large initial order to maintain its competitiveness
\[57\]. Aydogan et al. (2015) compared the advantages and disadvantages
of different types of SMRs then under extensive research and
development, putting side by side its different specifications,
including its cost. While SMRs lose its economies of scale to standard
reactors, they become competitive against nuclear reactors when they
take advantage of their modularity, reaching costs equivalent to
conventional sources of energy such as natural gas at around \$5000 kW
\[58\]. Black et al. (2019) incorporated detailed cost data of a major
developer of SMRs using a cost accounting framework to calculate its
construction cost and compare it with conventional large scale nuclear
power plants. The specific methodology resulted in a cost of \$3465 kW
for the SMR as opposed to a much more expensive \$5587 kW for a
large-scale reactor. The detailed cost analysis show also that the
reduced capitalized indirect costs prove the importance of reaping the
benefits of modularity to achieve a better cost per kW for SMRs \[59\].
Another way of evaluating the economic attractiveness of a power plant
is through its TCIC. To recap, the TCIC is the sum of the overnight
capital cost and the interest during construction. Shropshire (2011)
created a model examining the scenarios in which SMRs can be
economically viable using a target LCOE of EUR 45 MWh. SMRs would
compete well where existing nuclear reactors are being decommissioned,
where there is no option to accommodate an LR due to the grid size, or
where there are high fuel or carbon cost uncertainties in small
distributed markets \[60\]. Abdulla et al. (2013) examined the different
expert assessments on the cost of light water small modular reactors.
For a 45 MWe SMR, the cost can range from USD 4000 to 16,300 kWe for a
45 Mwe reactor, and between USD 3200 and 7100 kWe for a 225 MWe reactor
with a 2 year earlier delivery than a standard large reactor \[61\].
Boarin and Ricotti (2014) studied the influence of modularization,
co-siting, design savings, and learning effects on the competitiveness
of SMRs in comparison with standard LRs using a discounted cashflow
analysis, given a specific investment scenario. It confirmed that when
multiple units on the same site are deployed, benefits on fixed costs
from learning on the construction process and co-siting may be exploited
while design modularization and simplification account for the cost
reduction of each single SMR unit. Individual SMR costs decrease from
EUR 5200 kWe to EUR 4000 kWe as more units are produced and the
increased cost of capital e.g., cost of debt = 7% and cost of capital =
15% makes SMRs more attractive than LRs, as they are able to make
returns while a portion of the plant is already in operation \[15\].
Vegel and Quinn (2017) carried out an economic evaluation of SMRs
including the direct and indirect costs, scaling factors, and,
especially, the regulatory fees as required by the governing regulator
of the United States. The flat fee structure for each reactor would
dampen the economic attractiveness of SMRs; therefore, a linear scale
was proposed in order to cater to the growing need of smaller plant
designs \[62\]. Maronati et al. (2020) employed a cost differential
approach to estimate the cost of building a 983 MWe SMR. With a base
case of 4090 kWe for a scaled-down standard PWR, a corresponding SMR can
cost between 5.84--13.02% less, while scaling the same SMR up to the
standard PWR can result in a saving of 11.12--17.89% due to advances in
modularity and construction technologies \[63\]. Lloyd et al. (2021)
studied the effects of modularization on the transport and construction
costs of SMRs using already-available large PWR nuclear construction
cost and schedule data. The study showed that modularization can
decrease the construction costs of SMRs by as much as 45% from \$9855
kWe to \$5470 kWe in comparison to a reference large plant built at
\$6100 kWe \[64\]. Authors have also estimated a potential reduction in
costs on a percentage basis. Zhang and Sun (2007) examined the economic
potential of a modular reactor nuclear power plant as compared to a
single-unit large nuclear power plant, assuming the same plant capacity.
The study concluded that a 2 × 250 MWth modular plant can have a 5%
higher specific cost than an equivalent 458 MWth plant. Costs for the
modular plant can be reduced if engineering and construction are managed
well to reap the benefits of modularization and mass production \[65\].
Boldon et al. (2015) assessed the sustainability of a platform for
nuclear-renewable energy integration consisting of an SMR plant and wind
turbine combined with hydrogen production via electrolysis, using
criteria such as cost, environmental impact, and societal implications
using a sustainability factor. Modularity could account for up to 40% of
savings, plant configuration between 15 and 17%, and NOAK between 1 and
6%, while co-siting is highly dependent on the proportion of costs that
are indivisible among multiple units \[66\]. Ford et al. (2017) compiled
data on shipbuilding, nuclear development and decommissioning,
transmission cost, material cost, and water withdrawal to estimate the
potential cost of floating SMRs. It was found that floating NPPs would
cost 1.5--2 times as much as those that are based on land due to the
possibly more stringent requirements that may be imposed on them based
on a quality perspective \[67\]. Maronati et al. (2018) used a bottom-up
approach to calculate the total capital investment cost of building an
SMR, using a part-breakdown structure approach and supply chain data,
while varying the degrees of modularity employed in its construction.
The methodology showed that with the use of off-site factories to
produce modules, the total investment cost can be reduced by up to
23.64%; the use of an assembly area can reduce it by 8.26% and 29.95%
lower if both approaches were used, compared to a stick-built
construction method \[68\]. Locatelli et al. (2014) studied the distinct
features of small modular reactors and their construction to identify
their potential benefits over standard LRs and the conditions that allow
them. Through synergistic advantages in learning and construction time
offered by modularity, SMRs can offer better internal rates of returns
at capacities between one and three GWe with a gap of 1.5--2 years
between construction of modules over equivalent LRs \[6\]. Liman (2018)
proposed a methodology to assess the financial feasibility of modular
reactors that take into account the right time to construct further
additional modules and to shut it down given certain electricity price
conditions. The model showed that in the sample case of 10 out of 12
modules of a NuScale reactor that were constructed ahead of the
remaining two, there was an NPV of at least EUR 300 m \[69\]. Mignacca
and Locatelli (2020) reviewed the research landscape on the economics of
SMRs, which is considered to be what is hindering its development. The
review points out that there is a lack of a standard approach in the
economic evaluation of SMRs for comparison and a more holistic approach
considering the costs at a program or strategy level of a country
\[70\]. 3.3. Socio-Political In the same review by Locatelli et al.
(2014), the contribution of SMRs to employment was highlighted as a
positive effect on society; however, the impact of the
not-in-my-backyard behavior was cited as a potential hindrance to the
widespread deployment of SMRs \[6,71\]. From this, the issue of social
acceptance of SMRs and nuclear energy is brought to the fore and is an
important social issue that arises from the perceived safety concerns
that must be addressed to ensure the technology's sustainability. In
addressing this, Upadhyay and Jain (2016) examined the concept of
modularity in the context of SMRs, where it is used to mean the
construction of simpler and safer reactors that can be factory
manufactured, transported, installed, and scaled up as permitted by the
economic environment. This would result in improvement in the perception
of safety in the construction and performance of SMRs \[72\]. Budnitz et
al. (2018) also highlighted the inherent safety features that SMRs
possess, such as having less thermal energy production per reactor
(module), easing the need for cooling, especially after an accident or
shutdown, and the risk of a core meltdown and release of radioactive
material. However, the inherent safety features are not enough to
influence countries to invest in this technology due to a lack of a
safety culture that is embedded, especially in newcomer countries,
making imperative the need for structures that respect the rule of law
and for a strengthening of the current international nuclear safety
regime that was initiated through the international Convention on
Nuclear Safety (CNS) \[73\]. Aside from social acceptance arising from
safety issues, Ramana and Mian (2014) studied the perceived promises of
SMRs in solving four essential problems, including social ones, of cost,
waste, proliferation, and safety. Through this study, some tradeoffs
were observed to be necessary in choosing a particular technology in
order to address one or the other problem, depending on what was deemed
more essential in that particular country; for example, when integrated
PWRs can have increased safety features, smaller sizes and lower fuel
burnup, it comes at an increased cost per kW, a larger volume of waste,
and increased proliferation risk. Other technologies such as HTGRs and
neutron-fast reactors were investigated and observed with the same
tradeoffs \[74\]. Ramana and Agyapong (2016), also cautioned against
overreliance on the argument that SMRs are the most attractive nuclear
technology for developing countries. The case of Ghana showed that other
factors, such as the confluence of internal and external political
forces led to its adoption of large nuclear power plants, contrary to
the conventional wisdom of adopting SMRs for its development level
\[75\]. Moreover, Sovacool and Ramana (2015) criticized the apparent
rhetoric surrounding SMRs that tends to overemphasize the perceived
benefits this technology this will bring to the world, thus setting
aside the problems that its commercialization brings. Caution was urged
in adopting those positions based on the aforementioned rhetoric rather
than strategic choices and social practices \[76\]. Another important
social factor looks inwardly to the internal capabilities of the country
in adopting SMR technology. Iyer et al. (2014), in evaluating the
scenarios in which SMRs can contribute towards climate mitigation
targets, saw that SMRs can truly make an impact in this regard but
observed that technological preference and institutional inertia that
manifests itself in existing regulatory frameworks create path
dependencies. Preference for proven technologies also influences
decision-making, since public information on technology development and
approval on the part of early adopters would encourage investment, while
the lack of information would create uncertainties over performance and
long-term viability. Other concerns would include safety, waste
disposal, proliferation, and terrorism \[8\]. Prasad et al. (2014)
examined the various issues that affect the proliferation issues that
SMRs carry with them on the basis of its design: on fissile material
inventory, core-life, refueling, burnup, digital instrumentation and
controls, underground designs, sealed designs, enrichment, breeders,
excess reactivity, fuel element size, coolant opacity, and sea-based
nuclear plant designs. The study notes that SMRs will continue to
contain critical masses of fissile material that will require stringent
safeguard inspections. With designs that foresee up to 30 years of core
life, lesser access to the core will enhance safeguards against
proliferation. Due to the high burnup of nuclear fuel in SMRs, the
reliability of spent nuclear fuel for weapons purposes declines. Digital
instruments and control increase the possibilities of greater ease and
accuracy of autonomous monitoring. Underground and sealed designs also
make SMRs more difficult, costly, and challenging to access. Higher
enrichment levels are also required for SMRs, thus making them more
subject to proliferation. All in all, the designs may solve issues
related to proliferation or exacerbate them, highlighting the need to
introduce safeguards into their designs, accompanied with revisions in
regulatory regimes \[77\]. Glaser et al. (2013) determined the
proliferation risks of SMRs in relation to their resource requirements
using results from neutronics calculations. Integrated PWRs, due to its
lower burnup of fuel in comparison to LRs, will have higher requirements
for uranium ore and enrichment services, thus increasing its
proliferation risk by about 45% \[9\]. Zhang et al. (2019) employed an
SMR site selection model based on a fuzzy approach, considering climatic
and social factors. In using such a model, the social factors of
population density and municipality distribution were used, considering
the proximity of the SMR site to the population or municipality to be
closer to the ideal solution \[78\]. Overall, Hanna et al. (2019) in
analyzing the research landscape of four different low-carbon
technologies for energy production, pointed out that there is a lack of
depth in the field of social issues. It was found that public and
stakeholder perceptions are mentioned but not explored in depth, thus
needing further study in addressing the aforementioned issue in order to
aid the transition into the adoption of this technology \[79\]. 3.4.
Environment Overall, the search for substitutes for coal and other
fossil-fuel based energy is motivated by the long-term effects of these
sources of energy on climate change that are usually measured in terms
of g CO2 equivalent. Thus, an important criterion for assessing the
environmental sustainability of a technology is through this measure.
Boldon et al. (2015) combined several independent studies in order to
estimate the global warming potential of SMRs. The study involved
scaling a 1000 MWe nuclear plant and obtaining GWP values of 51 g
CO2-eq/kWh, 2.3 g SOx/kWh, and 0.08 g NOx/kWh. In the same study,
figures for wind energy were also obtained, and 12-g CO2-eq/kWh-wind
median value was estimated for a wind farm with 30% availability of land
generation with a 20-year lifetime \[66\]. In a separate study, Carless
et al. (2016) compared the GHG emissions of a 300 MWe SMR nuclear plant
to a Gen II and a Gen III 1000 MWe nuclear plants through an LCA that
combines process chain analysis (PCA) and an economic input output
method. The SMR had a 9.1 g CO2-eq/kWh, and the Gen III plant had a 8.4
g CO2-eq/kWh, both of which were better than the Gen II plant at 13.6 g
CO2-eq/kWh. Although the SMR measured higher than the Gen III plant, it
enjoys other technological advantages such as efficiencies in
construction, operation and maintenance, and decommissioning \[80\].
3.5. Analysis 3.5.1. Technology Significant progress has been seen in
many different areas of the technology aspect of SMRs. The amount of
research going on in this field, as well as the number of ongoing
projects in different types of SMR technologies show the interest and
the progress being made in this area. New variations are being proposed
that go beyond the earlier defined classes of SMRs, such as those of
subsea-based SMRs and organic SMRs. However, as earlier mentioned, there
has only been one SMR in commercial operation; thus, the overall
confidence in any given technology cannot be given the
"tried-and-tested" mark since even in the technology readiness index,
virtually none of them would make it to TRL 9. However, there is no
reason to doubt the feasibility of these technologies since they have
been spun off from already tried-and-tested technology. Zeliang et al.
(2020) confirm that iPWR-type SMRs are based on proven technologies,
since they are taken directly from existing commercial PWR reactors
\[81\]. The concepts behind the technologies stand for themselves; what
are being developed are detailed design elements that address the
necessary requirements for the plant to run, such as cooling, safety,
instrumentation, etc. With good reason, a clear area of research
concerns the safety aspects of the SMR. With events that gain popular
traction such as grave accidents like the Fukushima Power Plant and the
Chernobyl nuclear plant, the issue of safety runs highest among issues
in the minds of the public that affect the SMR's acceptability in their
eyes. Thus, the interest in addressing these safety concerns are
paramount in order to ensure the commercial success of a specific SMR
technology. The previously cited research shows significant effort in
this regard has been made: from materials research, disaster-modelling,
and plant design. Another key area found in the literature is the
potential for SMRs to be used in tandem with other technologies in order
to harness synergies through cogeneration. Several technologies have
been tested to work together with SMRs, and those that have emerged as
the most promising ones are hydrogen production, water desalination, and
district heating. With these possibilities for cogeneration, the SMRs
can be used for other purposes, thus maximizing the use of the heat
generated, contributing to more revenue streams. Moreover, studies have
also shown that with these possibilities of cogeneration, SMRs can be
used as a load-follower, rather than just a provider of baseload
electricity supply. This means that the SMR can adapt to fluctuations in
electricity demand by diverting the heat that would otherwise be used
for electricity generation to other productive activities such as those
mentioned earlier, i.e., hydrogen production, water desalination, and
district heating. SMRs were also studied in connection with the use of
other forms of renewable energy such as solar and wind turbines. These
studies show that together, they can respond to the demand for a
fluctuating electricity supply, with a competitive cost and with a
lesser carbon footprint. 3.5.2. Economics Table 3 presents a summary of
the various studies that have been conducted regarding the TCIC of SMRs.
Table 4 shows the studies that estimated the reduction in costs of the
use of SMRs. Table 5 summarizes the data on estimated LCOE at which SMRs
can provide energy. These figures can be used to compare with other
technologies, such as wind energy and solar PVs in order to assess its
economic suitability. Table 3. TCIC cost estimation of various authors.
Table Table 4. Estimated percentage reduction in TCIC by various
authors. Table Table 5. LCOE estimate of various authors. Table The
above studies have largely concentrated on one-time capital costs
associated with the construction of SMRs using TCIC or LCOE as a
methodology. On the other hand, studies relating to opportunistic
evaluation of costs depending on changing conditions that can
potentially alter it in the future were not performed as often. This
risk-based approach that considers the myriad of factors that can affect
decision-making in the present can prove advantageous for policy-makers
and investors. Techniques such as real options can be utilized to
present scenarios that are particular to any given context. 3.5.3.
Socio-Political Table 6 summarizes key socio-political factors
identified with SMRs. Among the most important social issues surrounding
the installation of SMRs, being a subset of nuclear power plants in
general, is the issue of social acceptance, i.e., whether the population
where the SMR will be cited are in favor of its installation, at a
regional or national level. Table 6. Summary of socio-political issues.
Table This is even more important in light of the recent high-profile
accidents that have happened such as those of Fukushima, Three-Mile
Island, and Chernobyl. Lei et al. (2013) noted the decrease in public
support for the building of nuclear power plants in a region in China by
as much as 41%; however, it was concluded that such behavior may differ
across different cultures \[85\]. Other authors have made other
observations: Table 7 shows the change in opposition to nuclear power
post-Chernobyl in various countries. Despite all these observations,
nations have continued to pursue nuclear technology for power. Table 7.
Changes in opposition to nuclear power in select countries
post-Chernobyl. Table While Germany has decided to terminate the use of
nuclear energy generation by 2022, many countries have decided to
continue pursuing the planning and construction of newbuild NPPs, such
as China, Finland, France, Hungary, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, United Arab
Emirates, United Kingdom, the USA, and Russia \[28\]. Needless to say,
the issue of social acceptance is important since these are associated
with mental health problems, trust in public officials, and ultimately,
attitudes toward nuclear power generation \[82\]. It is worthwhile to
note as well that in spite of the perceived decrease in public support
for nuclear power in China post-Fukushima, Zhan et al. (2021) noted that
China still sees nuclear energy playing a big role in its energy
development, with SMRs to be deployed by 2025 and synergized with the
use of renewable energy by 2030 \[86\]. The danger of nuclear
proliferation and terrorism also was brought to the fore by several
authors, indicating the potential of such a technology being used for
ends not congruent to the development of society, such as instilling
terror through the ease of access to materials that can be used for
weapons of mass destruction. Certain types of technology can promote
nuclear proliferation. Internal and external political forces can also
be at risk, which can come in the forms of pressure or interest groups
from within and without of the country as highlighted by Ramana and
Ahmad (2016), in the case of Jordan \[83\], where apparent pressure from
Russia enabled its investment on LRs, contrary to its parallel plan of
acquiring SMRs. Together with the above is the institutional inertia
that can resist (or promote) the adoption of new technologies such as
SMRs. Path dependencies on technologies may restrict the adoption and
may also indicate existing regulations that may hinder new technology
adoption. Related to institutional inertia is the importance placed on
safety by both workers and managers that are translated into codified
safety regulations, as well as generally accepted practice or behaviors
\[73\]. Another important social issue is the current development level
of a given society or country. Various indicators have been proposed in
this area: financial and economic criteria, e.g., GDP, electric grid,
technology, and infrastructure \[84\]. However, other social indicators
may also have to be considered in order to evaluate the readiness of a
society to adopt technology such as educational level and the
appropriate skillsets. 3.5.4. Environmental The absence of literature
related to the environmental impacts of SMRs is notable in this regard.
This may be due to the obvious lack of an operating plant that can be a
subject for study. For comparison's sake, we may cite the study of Wang
et al. (2019), who conducted a life cycle analysis, including
examinations of acidification potential, eutrophication potential,
photochemical ozone creation potential, and human toxicity potential of
wind energy, nuclear power (large reactor), and hydropower. The study
showed that wind power had the highest global warming potential at 28.6
± 3.2 g CO2-eq/kWh, followed by nuclear power at 12.4 ± 1.5 g CO2-eq/kWh
and lastly, hydropower at 3.5 ± 0.4 g CO2-eq/kWh \[87\]. Boldon et al.
(2015) conducted a similar study for wind power and SMRs, noting that
they fall within the range for an LR \[66\]. Moreover, Carless et al.
(2016) showed that the GHG emissions of SMRs are similar to those of LRs
\[80\]. Figure 9 shows a graph comparing the results from these
different authors. The studies are understandably largely based on
projected quantities of materials since there are virtually no SMRs on
commercial operations as yet. Energies 16 03224 g009 550 Figure 9. LCA
Results according to various authors. As far as greenhouse gas emissions
are concerned, studies have been clearly made with respect to the entire
plant in consideration. However, it will be of equal importance what the
environmental effects of such modularity can have in either
implementations i.e., of modularizing the production process of a single
plant, or the modularization of the power producing capacity. In the
former case, one can surmise the increased cost of transporting the
modular parts of a plant to the assembly area. In the latter case, a
nuclear plant with multiple SMRs would possibly have more structural
elements incorporated to secure each reactor. With the ever-increasing
concern for environmentally-sustainable technologies, these studies
carried out as accurate as possible are important for the
decision-making process for newcomer countries to avoid making that
trade-off of the environment for development. It is important that
before a country makes a decision to choose a certain technology path,
in this case SMRs, they know the environmental impact it may have even
before embarking on it. This breaks a circular notion that in order for
one to know the environmental impact, we need to build the plant first,
but to choose what plant to build, we need to know what the
environmental effects are. The LCA has to be conducted from the whole
plant-design level as early as possible. The research of Hussein (2020)
also suggested the retrofit of coal-fired power plants for SMRs
especially for iPWRs. This presents an interesting field of research on
environmental impact since many elements of the plants may be re-used.
Understandably, the plant's specification has to be upgraded in order to
conform to safety requirements and will have to be considered in any LCA
to be conducted in this regard \[37\]. 3.5.5. SMR Features Compared with
LRs All the previous sections have given us important characteristics of
an SMR and compare it with an LR. As SMRs have a small power capacity,
they have potential to be deployed in remote areas as stand-alone plants
and as parts of a small grid which will make LRs economically
unfeasible. Due to the advantages afforded by modularization, similar
plants can enjoy cheaper manufacturing and construction costs that can
arise from learnings from previous production cycles. Modularization
also allows for smaller logistical costs, as modules can be transported
from factory to site as one single unit. On the other hand, the first
unit is expected to be the most expensive. Thanks to the smaller plant
capacity and size, the first unit of a series of SMRs can be made
available to produce energy, thus reducing the capital needed to
construct the plant compared to a similarly sized LR. If capital costs
are lower, developing communities will be able to access this technology
and hasten their development. From a cost point-of-view, SMRs can be
comparable to LRs if enough of them are made to take advantage of the
aforementioned learnings. In terms of technology and designs, design
integration in a module allows for compact features, thereby reducing
the risk of accidents arising from major plant components. Their smaller
size also allows SMRs to be constructed on mobile units such as ships,
or to be built underground to minimize exposure to environmental
hazards. There will also be considerably lesser logistical issues dues
to their size In terms of socio-political aspects, since both types of
plants are nuclear-based, they will both suffer the same public
acceptance issues. Both require extensive information and education in
order to improve the level of public acceptance. On the other hand, SMRs
will seem to suffer security-related issues due to their potential for
proliferation coming from their comparatively smaller amount of fuel.
However, because of the smaller size of SMRs, where investment may be
made by stakeholders "closer-to-home", there is a democratization of
renewable energy development that can insulate one from external
political powers. The literature has also shown that LRs and SMRs have
comparatively similar potential environmental impacts, thereby giving a
much cleaner alternative to fossil-fuel based plants. 3.5.6. Models of
Renewable-Energy Readiness Indices Having seen the progress in
scientific research related to specific issues on SMRs, the question is
how they all fit together in giving decision-makers a complete picture
of all these issues, together with the advantages and disadvantages of
the technology. Some studies have been carried out in combining these
elements to determine the readiness of countries to invest in this
technology, starting with those related to renewable energy in general.
Hawila et al. (2014) assessed the readiness of North African countries
to adopt renewable energy technologies. The model adopted factors and
sub-factors related to infrastructure, institution and human capital
using a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) technique coupled with the
weighted sum method for the final renewable energy-readiness assessment
\[88\]. Mondal et al. (2015), adopted an approach similar to that of
Hawila et al. to study the RE-readiness of the Gulf Cooperation Council
countries, incorporating a different set of criteria that were found to
be missing in the previous study. A similar MCDM technique was used,
employing the equal weights method to assign the weightages to the three
pillars of infrastructure, institutions, and human capital. Finally, the
weighted sum method is employed to obtain the final RE-readiness index
\[89\]. Black et al. (2015) consolidated 15 criteria to assess each
country's readiness for SMR adoption \[84\]. Table 8 compares this set
of criteria with those employed by the two previous authors. While the
study is comprehensive in terms of the technological and economic
aspects, these do not consider many socio-political criteria as
enumerated in the preceding sections. In addition, local environmental
costs and monetary costs with which a country can construct SMR plants
are not included in the construction of its index. Black et al. used the
AHP method to determine the scores from different countries, using data
obtained from public databases. The studies related to energy readiness
indices thus far performed have shown that the use of MCDM techniques
may be used for this purpose. This shows its flexibility in being used
for different sets of criteria. Table 8. Criteria for readiness indices
for RE/nuclear energy. Table 4. Challenges and Future Direction There is
a large amount of literature in terms of technology and the economics of
SMRs. All these serve to make SMR technology attractive as a means to
meet the energy demands and the environmental targets. On the other
hand, as highlighted by some authors, there is a need to expand on
studies related to the social issues surrounding SMRs and how they
affect their feasibility. On the economic aspects, the use of LCOE and
TCIC have been extensively explored with several authors estimating a
reduction in costs as more SMRs are installed. However, due to the
modular nature of SMRs, consideration of the decisions to proceed with
further additions of modules arising from uncertainties in all these
factors must be carefully weighed, considered, and presented to
decision-makers. These factors may include those that have been
discussed, such as technological maturity of new designs, environmental
aspects, political situations, public perception, etc. Today's
widespread concern for sustainability issues demand a careful look into
the aforementioned issues. Technologies that are not ready to be
deployed run the risk of being environmentally catastrophic. In turn,
these technologies may not provide what they promise, such as a low
carbon footprint, or worse, may fail during operation, requiring
contingencies that may be significantly worse than if the SMRs were not
deployed in the first place, or that may render the investment
financially unsound in the long run. Similarly, a lack of consideration
of environmental impact, from cradle-to-grave prior to deployment, may
directly contribute to environmental effects such as greenhouse gases
and radiation exposure. External political situations have to be weighed
as well. An even bigger concern is public perception which can lead to
unexpected extreme situations such as psychological impact and social
unrest. From a positive point of view, a good public perception of the
technology can enable greater participation and thus better
implementation of such projects. A financial model must be constructed
that takes into consideration these uncertainties arising from different
factors identified. This is especially important for newcomer countries
that are more often than not financially challenged and, therefore, need
careful consideration of multiple factors. Several options evaluation
techniques employed in renewable energy investment can be used to
improve the decision-making from an economic point of view. Most papers
reviewed have employed a time-value based approach such as the net
present value. New techniques such as the real-options approach can be
used since it considers varying conditions throughout the life cycle of
the plant. Hürlimann (2018) also proposed using explanatory, sequential,
and mixed-methods approaches to evaluate investments that take into
account quantitative and qualitative findings \[90\]. From a
socio-political perspective, measurements must be made with regard to
institutional readiness for nuclear adoption. The presence of
institutions such as oversight, safety, education, etc., may increase
the probability that further investments in SMRs may be made. These
institutions help engender reliability and trust in the technology among
the public. Moreover, with strong institutions, foreign investors in
energy generation will also see this as a positive environment that will
help protect their own investments. While difficult, it is certainly
doable to determine what indicators can be used in order to objectively
measure these factors. In addition to the aforementioned criteria, among
the various socio-political criteria that have been used in studies in
this area are the Doing Business Index, Corruption Perceptions Index,
and a country's infrastructure ranking as provided by independent
organizations. With a more objective measurement of these factors,
better studies may be made that can enhance the use of indices in
measuring overall readiness of countries in investing in this
technology. Uncertainties arising from political forces can upset the
priorities that a country may have and, thus, never reach the promised
costs this technology would bring. The reality of security risks such as
war and nuclear proliferation can also influence further investments in
SMRs. As highlighted, some have raised the issue of higher enrichment of
nuclear fuel and increased deployment of nuclear fuel, especially to
remote regions, present security risks arising from nuclear
proliferation \[77\]. On the other hand, as seen in recent history, the
Zaporizhia NPP built in the Ukraine is the largest NPP in Europe and was
made a target by Russia in the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war \[91\]. With
smaller capacity reactors spread over a geographical region, each NPP
(SMR) could lessen its attractiveness as a military target due to the
lesser potential impact to the energy supply and as a tool for political
ends. Thus, a careful balancing of interests based on these concerns has
to take place to come to a right decision. There are also many
environmental issues that need further study in considering whether a
country, or more specifically, a certain locality is a suitable site for
construction of SMRs. As earlier discussed, there is not much available
literature on using LCA for SMRs or a network of SMRs and its advantage
over LRs or other alternative RE sources in the long term. LCA studies
incorporating electricity distribution can comparatively study all these
types of energy sources. The recent accident in Fukushima highlights
specific environmental issues that need further study, such as
resistance to specific natural disasters like earthquakes, tsunamis, and
typhoons. To this end, several possibilities have been identified that
can address such environmental hazards such as floating nuclear power
plants or those that are build underground, together with their
concomitant risks. Modelling of such types of SMRs can be explored as
opposed to standard land-based and above-ground SMRs. More sophisticated
MCDM techniques may also be developed in order to assist countries in
making that critical decision to invest in this technology. This may
involve computational intelligence methods that enable more precise
decision-making. These methods can give rise to indices or mapping tools
that are not just at the country level but that can deep-dive into
specific areas being considered for SMR projects. A systems dynamics
approach can also be used in order to allow policymakers to pinpoint
what must be done in order to ensure maximum benefits may be reaped from
investing in SMRs in a particular place or time. This may also find use
among countries currently using nuclear power to choose the best site
for erecting a SMR or a series of them. Such MCDM techniques should
incorporate more real-world criteria such as those discussed earlier.
Some studies have been carried out using such MCDM techniques on other
types of renewable energy. Hawila et al. (2014) assessed the readiness
of North African countries to adopt renewable energy technologies
adopting factors and sub-factors related to infrastructure, institution
and human capital \[88\]. The researchers used an MCDM technique coupled
with the weighted sum method for the final renewal energy (RE)-readiness
assessment. A similar study was made by Mondal et al. (2016) to examine
the RE-readiness of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, using a
different set of criteria missing in the previous study. It used an
equal weights method to assign the weightages to these three pillars:
infrastructure, institutions, and human capital. Finally, the weighted
sum method is employed to obtain the final RE-readiness index (Mondal et
al., 2016) \[89\]. Black et al. (2015) consolidated 15 criteria to
assess each country's readiness for SMR adoption. While the study is
comprehensive in terms of the technological and economic aspects, these
do not consider many socio-political criteria as the succeeding
literature will show. In addition, local environmental costs and
monetary costs with which a country can construct SMR plants are not
considered in its index. Black et al. used the AHP method to determine
the scores from different countries, using data obtained from public
databases (G. Black et al., 2015). The studies related to energy
readiness indices thus performed have shown that MCDM techniques may be
used for this purpose. They show their flexibility in being used for
different sets of criteria. At this point in time, real-world studies
have been scarce due to the fact that there have been very few SMR
installations around the world. In order to give credence to their
claims to economic and environmental benefits, data must be carefully
collected and studied over the next few years in order to obtain a
clearer picture and steer development towards an attractive technology
solution for supplying energy.

5\. Conclusions

The effort to mitigate the effects of carbon-based energy sources must

One of the [viable]{.mark} nuclear [power]{.mark} generation

small modular reactors]{.underline} ([[SMRs]{.underline}]{.mark}). For
this reason, a state-of-the-art review of SMRs was performed to document
the advancement of this technology amid the various concerns identified

[[Nuclear]{.mark} energy [has been in use for]{.mark} several
**[decades]{.mark}** in various parts of the globe, and [it has

Various financial analyses have shown from a theoretical point of view

[[Substantial]{.mark} and [rapid decarbonization]{.mark} in the coming
decades will be [necessary to prevent climate change]{.mark} from
surpassing 1.5 °C of warming by 2050]{.underline}. As part of these
pathways, global industrial emissions will need to be reduced by 65--90%
from 2010 levels, yet few low-emission alternatives to fossil fuels are
technologically or economically viable Hard-to-decarbonize industrial
processes requiring above 300 °C such as those present in chemicals
production, petroleum facilities and metals manufacturing pose the
greatest challenges [[Technologies]{.mark} such as hydrogen, biofuels,
electrification and concentrated solar power all offer possible avenues
but [are limited by]{.mark} economics, [geography]{.mark}, readiness
level or lifecycle energy inputs^.^]{.underline}

[Advanced nuclear reactors such as small modular reactors
([SMRs)]{.mark} could [provide]{.mark} a [non-geographically limited
low-carbon opportunity for decarbonization]{.mark}]{.underline}. These
reactors are designed to have outlet temperatures reaching a possible
850 °C, range up to 300 megawatt-electric (MW~e~, which accounts for the
conversion efficiency from the reactor output heat measured in
megawatt-thermal (MW~t~)) and are designed to be modular and mass
manufacturable. With some designs having outlet temperatures up to
850 °C without augmentation, [[SMRs could]{.mark} [address]{.mark} [88%
of emissions for the largest industrial facilities]{.mark} and [21% of
total industrial emissions in the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}. Dozens of SMRs are in the design phase
globally, with at least two designs planning for operation by 2030.
Partnerships between SMR manufacturers and industrial companies indicate
industrial interest in SMRs. Waste heat from conventional large-scale

2.4.1. Demand for Electricity is Growing

[[U.S.]{.mark} electricity [**demand** is **growing**]{.mark} for the
first time in over a decade]{.underline}. Goldman Sachs estimates that
[electric **load** will grow by 2.4% in the U.S. from 2022 to
2030]{.underline} \[122\]. This expected load growth is being spurred by
data centers, the electrification of vehicles, other residential
electrification, industrial process electrification, and manufacturing
reshoring (See Figure 16). Regionally, the electric grid is operated by
ISOs, which control the electric grid and the wholesale electricity
market in their regions. Most of Indiana is in MISO, which spans 15
states throughout the Midwest and South of the U.S. and Manitoba,
Canada. According to MISO, [energy **[consumption]{.mark}** will grow by
1.7% per year from 2023 through 2030, a big change compared to the 0.2%
annual **growth rate** over the prior decade]{.underline}. MISO analysis
predicts that [energy consumption [will increase even further]{.mark},
to 3.9% per year between 2030 and 2040]{.underline}. Load Zone 6, which
includes the parts of Indiana and Kentucky in MISO's territory, has an
above-average expected growth rate, with an annual 2.1% increase in
energy consumption expected between 2023 and 2030. This is partly due to
an above-average data center load growth in Indiana. Parts of
Northeastern Indiana are in another ISO, PJM. PJM's territory extends
throughout 13 states in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest U.S. PJM's load
forecast for 2024 shows an expected increase of 1.6% per year for summer
peaks over the next 10 years and an increase of 2.3% per year of total
energy consumption over that same period. PJM's Western Zone, which
includes Indiana and most of the PJM territory west of central PA, has a
slower-than-average load growth, with PJM Western only projected to have
a 0.6% annual increase in the summer peak load. \[123\]

2.4 Grid Integration

[[Nuclear energy]{.mark} has **several benefits** including 24/7
**availability**, **capacity** factors above 90%, and load following
**capability** making it [**well-suited** to meet]{.mark} the needs of a
[**decarbonized** grid]{.mark}. The unique qualifications of nuclear has
[led to]{.mark} a [**resurgence** in interest]{.mark} in the U.S. and
**[globally]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In April of 2023, the U.S.
Department of Energy (DOE) Nuclear Loan Program Office's Liftoff report
(2023) stated:

U.S. domestic nuclear capacity has the potential to scale from \~100
Gigawatt (GW) in 2023 to \~300 GW by 2050---driven by deployment of
advanced nuclear technologies. [Power system decarbonization modeling,
regardless of level of renewables deployment, suggests that the [U.S.
will need]{.mark}]{.underline} \~550--770 GW of [**[additional]{.mark}**
clean, firm [capacity to reach net-zero; nuclear]{.mark} power is one of
the **few [proven]{.mark}** options [that could deliver]{.mark} this at
scale, while creating highpaying **jobs** with [**concentrated**
economic **benefits** for **communities**]{.mark} most impacted by the
energy transition]{.underline} \[119\].

In December 2023 at the COP 28 UN Climate Change Conference, [the U.S.,
along with **[25]{.mark}** other **[countries]{.mark}**, [pledged to
triple]{.mark} the [nuclear capacity]{.mark} by 2050,
**[acknowledging]{.mark}** the **importance** of nuclear in reaching
global [climate goals]{.mark}]{.underline}. Bloomberg New Energy
Finance's New Energy Outlook 2024 likewise estimates that nuclear
capacity will increase from 377 GW in 2023 to 1,025 GW in 2050 in their
Net Zero by 2050 scenario \[120\]. The IEA's Net Zero Roadmap for 2023
includes more than doubling nuclear generation capacity globally by
2050; from 417 GW in 2022 to 916 GW in 2050 \[121\].

### 1AC\-\--Scenario\-\--Water Scarcity

#### Only nuclear expansion can solve water scarcity. 

**Steel '18** \[William; October 1; reporter covering renewable energy,
water and cleantech industries, citing experts from the IAEA;
"Nuclear-Powered Desalination,"
https://www.waterworld.com/articles/iww/print/volume-18/issue-5/features/nuclear-powered-desalination.html\]

[[As]{.mark} the [pressures of water security become]{.mark} more
[acute]{.mark} around the world, **the [significance of
desalination]{.mark}** as means of ensuring potable water supplies [has
never been greater]{.mark}]{.underline}. [But with the expected growth
of global desalination capacity comes a problem: **[processes remain
heavily reliant on fossil fuels]{.mark}**]{.underline}. According to the
Global Clean Water Desalination Alliance, [global installed desalination
plants emit some 76 million tons of CO2 per year, an amount expected to
reach around 218 million tons by 2040.]{.underline} Clear alternatives
do exist, namely ambitions and projects for desalination via renewables.
Still, [with emissions and water security high on the global agenda,
another solution presents itself in the form of **[nuclear-powered
desalination]{.mark}**. It's not a new idea --- **[it's well documented
as a feasible, reliable and efficient]{.mark} solution** for process
integration with desalination technologies of several
flavors]{.underline}. **[A [key strength of nuclear power]{.mark}
plants]{.underline}** (NPPs), [aside from technical
maturity]{.underline}, **[[is]{.mark} their [capacity to supply]{.mark}
either thermal or electrical [energy]{.mark}, or both, to respective
desalination processes, [at varying scales]{.mark}.]{.underline}** "[We
can think of [nuclear]{.mark}-powered [desal]{.mark}ination in terms of
two main applications. One is to serve [**make-up water
resource**s]{.mark} for the plant; the other is to **[produce potable
water]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [Both applications have already been
demonstrated," said Ibrahim Khamis from the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA) department of nuclear energy.]{.underline} Precedent
notwithstanding, Khamis explained that "[nuclear-powered desalination of
potable water isn't currently widespread or deployed at large
scale."]{.underline} A notable exception was the now-offline Aktau plant
in Kazakhstan. A flagship nuclear desalination plant pioneered by the
Russian nuclear industry, Aktau was commissioned in 1967 and operated
for 40 years, supplying Aktau's population (over 150,000 people) and
industry with fresh water. A few examples of nuclear-powered
desalination in operation do exist. "Only recently we've moved from a
few thousand cubic meters daily production to tens of thousands cubic
meters daily production being built --- it's scaled up but not greatly,"
said Claus Mertes with leading desalination consultancy DME on the state
of global nuclear desalination. He continued: ["[India, Pakistan, Iran
and China already have nuclear]{.mark}-powered desalination [capacity,
although **not at the scale that nuclear power could easily
achieve**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- say 1 million cubic meters per day.
We currently see plants with 10,000-15,000 cubic meters daily production
using multi-effect distillation with thermal vapor compression
(MED-TVC), reverse osmosis (RO) or multi-effect distillation (MED)
processes. These plants are in operation today, and several have plans
to increase production capacities."

#### That causes nuclear war.

We Have Been Warned

The most recent United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
report warned of increasingly intense droughts and mass water shortages
around large swaths of the globe.

But even more conservative organizations have been sounding the alarm.
"[[Water insecurity]{.mark} could **[multiply]{.mark} the risk of
[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}," warns one of the World Bank's reports
on the issue. "[**[Food]{.mark} price [spikes]{.mark}** [caused]{.mark}
by droughts can **[inflame]{.mark} latent [conflicts]{.mark}** and
**drive [migration]{.mark}**. Where economic growth is impacted by
rainfall, episodes of droughts and floods have generated waves of
migration and **[spikes]{.mark} in [violence]{.mark}** within
countries]{.underline}."

Meanwhile, a study published in the journal Global Environmental Change,
looked at how [**"hydro-political issues"** --- including **tensions**
and potential **conflicts** --- could play out in countries expected to
experience water shortages coupled with [**high populations** and
**pre-existing**]{.mark} **geopolitical
[tensions]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The study warned that [these factors could [**combine** to
increase]{.mark} the likelihood of water-related tensions ---
potentially **[escalating]{.mark}** into **[armed
conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} in cross-boundary river basins in places
around the world by 74.9 to 95 percent. This means that [in some places
conflict [is]{.mark} **practically [guaranteed]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[These areas include]{.underline} regions situated around primary rivers
[[in **Asia** and]{.mark} **North [Africa]{.mark}**. Noted rivers
include the Tigris and Euphrates, the Indus, the Nile, and the
Ganges-Brahmaputra]{.underline}.

Consider the fact that 11 countries share the Nile River basin: Egypt,
Burundi, Kenya, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Uganda, Rwanda, Sudan, South Sudan,
Tanzania and the Democratic Republic of Congo. All told, more than 300
million people already live in these countries, --- a number that is
projected to double in the coming decades, while the amount of available
water will continue to shrink due to climate change.

[For those]{.underline} in the US [thinking]{.underline} these potential
[conflicts will only occur in distant lands]{.underline} --- [think
again. The study]{.underline} also [warned of a]{.underline} very
[**high chance** of these "hydro-political interactions" in]{.underline}
portions of the [**southwestern** US and **north**ern
**Mexico**]{.underline}, around the Colorado River.

India and Pakistan

Potential [tensions are particularly worrisome in **India** and
**Pakistan**]{.underline}, which are already rivals when it comes to
water resources. For now, these two countries have an agreement, albeit
a strained one, over the Indus River and the sharing of its water, by
way of the 1960 Indus Water Treaty.

However, [[water]{.mark} claims [have been central to]{.mark} their
ongoing, burning dispute over]{.underline} the
[[Kashmir]{.underline}]{.mark} region, [[a
**flashpoint**]{.underline}]{.mark} area there for more than 60 years
and counting.

The aforementioned treaty is now more strained than ever, as Pakistan
accuses India of limiting its water supply and violating the treaty by
placing dams over various rivers that flow from Kashmir into Pakistan.

In fact, a 2018 report from the International Monetary Fund ranked
Pakistan third among countries facing severe water shortages, This is
largely due to the rapid melting of glaciers in the Himalaya that are
the source of much of the water for the Indus.

To provide an idea of how quickly water resources are diminishing in
both countries, statistics from Pakistan's Islamabad Chamber of Commerce
and Industry from 2018 show that water availability (per capita in cubic
meters per year) shrank from 5,260 in 1951, to 940 in 2015, and are
projected to shrink to 860 by just 2025.

In India, the crisis is hardly better. According to that country's
Ministry of Statistics (2016) and the Indian Ministry of Water Resources
(2010), the per capita available water in cubic meters per year was
5,177 in 1951, and 1,474 in 2015, and is projected to shrink to 1,341 in
2025.

Both of these countries are nuclear powers. Given the dire projections
of water availability as climate change progresses, [**nightmare
scenarios** of **[water wars]{.mark}** that could [spark **nuclear
exchanges**]{.mark} are now becoming **possible**]{.underline}.

reactors [represent a paradigm shift in nuclear energy generation,
promising enhanced safety features, reduced capital costs, and a more
flexible approach to deployment]{.underline} compared to traditional
large-scale nuclear power plants. This article explores the
transformative potential of SMRs, delving into their technological
underpinnings, economic and geopolitical implications, and their
[**crucial** role in shaping a sustainable energy future]{.underline}.
The [[rising]{.mark} **global [interest]{.mark}** [in SMRs]{.mark} is
[fueled by]{.mark} their [potential to address]{.mark} several critical
[energy challenges]{.mark} simultaneously]{.underline}. Their smaller
size and modular design allow for factory fabrication and
transportation, significantly reducing on-site construction time and
costs, a major advantage over conventional nuclear projects often
plagued by delays and cost overruns. This [modularity]{.underline} also
[offers greater [flexibility]{.mark} in deployment, making SMRs
[suitable for]{.mark} a wider range of applications, from powering
[**remote communities** and]{.mark} industrial facilities to [providing
**grid stability** and]{.mark} supporting [decarbonization]{.mark}
efforts in established grids]{.underline}. Furthermore, [SMRs are
designed with advanced [safety features]{.mark}]{.underline}, often
incorporating passive safety systems that rely on natural forces like
gravity and convection to cool the reactor core in the event of an
incident, [[minimizing]{.mark} the risk of [accidents]{.mark} and
[enhancing **public confidence**]{.mark}. The development and deployment
of SMRs are also [attracting]{.mark}]{.underline} significant investment
from both public and private sectors, recognizing the potential for
[**[economic growth]{.mark}** and job creation]{.underline} within the
advanced nuclear industry. [Governments worldwide are implementing
policies and regulatory frameworks to support SMR development,
recognizing their strategic importance in achieving energy security and
climate goals]{.underline}. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has
highlighted the potential of [SMRs]{.underline} to [play a significant
role in meeting global decarbonization targets, particularly in sectors
with hard-to-abate emissions. For [investors]{.mark}, SMRs represent a
**[promising]{.mark}** opportunity in the clean energy sector, with the
potential for [**long-term** returns]{.mark} driven by growing demand

realizing the full potential of SMRs requires addressing key challenges,
including streamlining regulatory processes, ensuring robust supply
chains for fuel and components, and fostering public understanding and
acceptance of this innovative technology. This article will further
examine these aspects, providing a comprehensive overview of the SMR
landscape and its implications for the future of energy.

Understanding SMR Technology: A New Generation of Nuclear Reactors

Small Modular Reactors, or [[SMRs]{.underline}]{.mark}, [represent a
significant **[depart]{.mark}**ure [from **tradition**]{.mark}al
large-scale nuclear power plants, primarily distinguished by their
reduced size and modular construction]{.underline}. These advanced
nuclear reactors are engineered to produce electrical power outputs
typically ranging from a few megawatts to around 300 megawatts, a stark
contrast to the gigawatt-scale capacities of conventional reactors. This
[[size reduction]{.mark} is not merely a scaling down of existing
technology; it involves innovative design principles that facilitate
factory fabrication, [enabling]{.mark} a more [streamlined and
cost-effective]{.mark} manufacturing [process]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
modular nature of SMRs allows for their construction in controlled
factory environments, followed by transportation to the deployment site,
which [significantly [reduces]{.mark} on-site construction time and
associated **[costs]{.mark}**, a major barrier for traditional nuclear
builds]{.underline}. This approach also [[allows]{.mark} for greater
**flexibility** in deployment locations, making nuclear energy
**[access]{.mark}**ible [to]{.mark} a broader **range** of
[communities]{.mark} and industries]{.underline}. The modular design
also allows for incremental deployment, adding modules as needed to
match growing energy demands, [an approach that is particularly
[attractive for investors]{.mark}]{.underline}. Various SMR designs are
under development, each employing different technologies and offering
unique advantages. Pressurized water reactors (PWRs), a well-established
technology, are adapted for SMR applications, leveraging the existing
knowledge base and infrastructure. Boiling water reactors (BWRs) are
another common design choice, known for their simplicity and efficiency.
However, the field of [SMRs]{.underline} is also pushing the boundaries
of nuclear technology with the development of molten salt reactors
(MSRs), which [offer enhanced safety features and the potential for
greater fuel efficiency]{.underline}. These advanced reactor designs are
exploring innovative cooling mechanisms, fuel cycles, and safety
systems, representing a significant leap forward in nuclear technology.
The [**[diversity]{.mark}** in SMR designs also [allows]{.mark} for
greater flexibility in meeting specific energy needs, from electricity
generation to industrial process heat and
**[desalination]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The innovation in SMR technology
extends beyond reactor design to include advanced materials, digital
control systems, and remote monitoring capabilities, [all contributing
to safer, more efficient, and more reliable operations. These
advancements are crucial for **[addressing]{.mark}** the challenges
associated with nuclear energy, including **[waste]{.mark}** management
[and **prolif**]{.mark}**eration** [concerns]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Furthermore, the [development and deployment of SMRs are not just about
technological innovation; they also have significant implications for
energy policy, investment strategies, and the **global transition** to
sustainable energy. The potential of [SMRs]{.mark} to [provide clean,
reliable, and affordable energy]{.mark} is [attracting]{.mark}
**significant [interest]{.mark}**]{.underline} from both public and
private sectors, driving investment in research, development, and
deployment. [As the global community grapples with climate change and
the need for secure energy supplies, SMRs are emerging as a promising
solution, offering a pathway to a more sustainable and resilient energy
future. The [**regulatory** frameworks]{.mark} and policies surrounding
SMRs [are **evolving**]{.mark} to accommodate the unique characteristics
of these technologies, balancing the need for safety and security with
the imperative [to **accelerate**]{.mark} their
[deployment]{.mark}]{.underline}. The development of standardized
licensing processes and international cooperation are critical for
ensuring the safe and widespread adoption of SMR technology, making it a
key component of the future of energy.

Advantages of SMRs: Safety, Affordability, and Accessibility Small
Modular Reactors (SMRs) present a paradigm shift in nuclear energy,
offering a range of advantages over traditional large-scale nuclear
power plants. Their inherent safety features, often based on passive
systems, minimize the risk of accidents by relying on natural forces
like gravity and convection for cooling, rather than complex active
systems. This enhanced safety profile, coupled with smaller size and
modularity, significantly reduces capital costs and construction
timelines, attracting investment and accelerating deployment. For
instance, NuScale Power's SMR design leverages natural circulation for
cooling, eliminating the need for large pumps and reducing the
probability of a core meltdown. This modular approach also allows for
factory fabrication and transportation, streamlining on-site
construction and minimizing project risks, ultimately contributing to a
more predictable and cost-effective energy solution. SMRs are
particularly well-suited for remote locations and smaller grids,
expanding access to clean and reliable energy for communities previously
reliant on fossil fuels. Their flexible deployment options make them
ideal for powering remote mines, military bases, or isolated
communities, promoting economic development and energy independence.
Furthermore, SMRs offer the potential for non-electric applications,
such as desalination, district heating, and process heat generation for
industrial processes, further diversifying their utility and
contributing to sustainable resource management. This versatility
positions SMRs as a key technology in addressing climate change by
providing a carbon-free energy source for a wide range of applications.
The lower upfront capital costs associated with SMRs also reduce the
financial barriers to entry for smaller utilities and developing
nations, promoting wider access to nuclear energy and supporting global
decarbonization efforts. From an investment perspective, SMRs represent
a compelling opportunity, with their modular design reducing
construction risks and offering the potential for faster return on
investment. Government policies and regulations play a crucial role in
shaping SMR deployment, with streamlined licensing processes and
supportive regulatory frameworks being essential for accelerating the
adoption of this transformative technology. The development and
deployment of SMRs also stimulate innovation in related fields, such as
advanced materials, manufacturing techniques, and digital control
systems, creating new economic opportunities and driving technological
advancements. As the world transitions to a cleaner energy future, SMRs
hold the potential to be a key player in achieving global climate goals,
enhancing energy security, and fostering sustainable economic growth.
The reduced land footprint required for SMRs compared to conventional
nuclear plants minimizes environmental impact and enhances public
acceptance, making them a more palatable option for communities
concerned about land use and visual impact. International collaboration
is essential for accelerating SMR development and deployment, sharing
best practices, and addressing common challenges related to safety,
security, and waste management. These partnerships are fostering a
global SMR ecosystem, driving innovation and ensuring the responsible
and sustainable advancement of this promising technology. Addressing the
Challenges of SMR Deployment While Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) hold
immense potential to revolutionize nuclear energy, their deployment is
not without challenges. Navigating the regulatory landscape presents a
significant hurdle. The licensing processes for SMRs, while anticipated
to be more streamlined than those for traditional large-scale reactors,
still involve complex procedures and stringent safety evaluations by
organizations like the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in the United
States. This can lead to extended timelines and increased development
costs, potentially hindering the pace of SMR deployment. International
harmonization of regulatory frameworks could expedite the licensing
process and facilitate global SMR adoption. Public perception and
acceptance remain paramount for the successful integration of SMRs.
Addressing public concerns regarding nuclear safety, waste disposal, and
potential environmental impacts requires transparent communication,
community engagement, and accessible educational resources. Building
trust and fostering open dialogue with stakeholders are essential for
gaining public support and ensuring the social license to operate.
Effective waste management strategies are crucial for the long-term
sustainability of SMRs. Although SMRs generate less waste than
conventional reactors, the development of robust and secure waste
disposal solutions, including advanced recycling technologies and
geological repositories, is vital. International cooperation and the
sharing of best practices in waste management can further enhance the
safety and efficiency of these processes. Concerns about nuclear
proliferation and the potential misuse of SMR technology require careful
consideration. Implementing robust safeguards and security measures,
along with international agreements and monitoring mechanisms, are
essential to mitigate these risks. Transparency and collaboration among
nations are crucial for ensuring the peaceful and responsible
development of SMR technology. Integrating SMRs into existing power
grids presents technical complexities. Their smaller scale and modular
nature require adjustments to grid infrastructure and control systems to
ensure stable and reliable electricity supply. Investing in grid
modernization and developing advanced grid management technologies are
essential for seamless SMR integration and maximizing their potential
benefits. The economic viability of SMRs is a key factor influencing
their widespread adoption. While SMRs offer potential cost advantages
through modular construction and factory fabrication, achieving
competitive electricity prices requires careful cost management,
efficient supply chains, and supportive government policies. Investment
in research and development, along with public-private partnerships, can
drive down costs and accelerate the commercialization of SMR technology.
The future of SMRs depends on addressing these challenges effectively.
By fostering innovation, streamlining regulations, engaging with the
public, and developing robust safety and security protocols, the
transformative potential of SMRs can be unlocked, paving the way for a
cleaner, more sustainable, and secure energy future. The Global SMR
Landscape: A Race to Innovation The global landscape of Small Modular
Reactor (SMR) development is rapidly evolving, marked by substantial
investments and collaborative efforts across several nations. The United
States, for instance, is actively pursuing SMR technology through
initiatives like the Department of Energy's Advanced Reactor
Demonstration Program, which aims to accelerate the commercialization of
innovative designs. This includes support for companies developing both
light-water and non-light-water SMRs, reflecting a strategic push
towards a diverse nuclear energy portfolio. Similarly, Canada's
commitment to SMRs is evident through its national SMR roadmap,
emphasizing the technology's potential for both on-grid and off-grid
applications, particularly in remote communities and industrial sites.
This initiative is not just about energy generation; it's also about
fostering regional economic growth and technological leadership. China,
with its ambitious nuclear power expansion plans, is also heavily
invested in SMRs, viewing them as a key component of its energy strategy
to meet rising demands while reducing carbon emissions, highlighting the
crucial role of SMRs in addressing climate change. Russia, a
long-standing player in the nuclear sector, continues to advance its SMR
designs, leveraging its existing nuclear infrastructure and expertise to
maintain its position in the global nuclear market. These diverse
approaches highlight a global race for innovation in the SMR space,
driven by the need for reliable, clean, and secure energy sources. These
are clear signals of the potential SMRs hold for the future of energy.
The development of Small Modular Reactors is not confined to
government-led initiatives; numerous private companies worldwide are
contributing to the innovation ecosystem. Companies are actively
developing diverse SMR designs, ranging from advanced light water
reactors to molten salt reactors and high-temperature gas-cooled
reactors. These designs offer varying characteristics in terms of fuel
type, safety features, and operational parameters, reflecting a broad
spectrum of technological approaches to SMR development. International
collaborations are becoming increasingly important, with joint ventures
and partnerships forming to share knowledge, resources, and expertise.
Such collaborations are crucial for accelerating the pace of innovation
and facilitating the commercialization of SMR technology. These joint
efforts also play a key role in standardizing regulatory frameworks and
addressing concerns related to nuclear safety and security. The
investment landscape for SMRs is also dynamic, with venture capital,
private equity, and government funding playing crucial roles in
financing research, development, and deployment projects. Investors are
increasingly recognizing the potential of SMRs to address the global
energy transition while generating attractive returns, driving further
financial interest in the sector. The regulatory landscape for SMRs is
also evolving, with agencies in various countries working to establish
clear and efficient licensing processes. These regulatory efforts are
essential for ensuring the safety and security of SMR operations while
also providing a predictable pathway for commercial deployment. Policy
makers are also playing a key role, implementing measures to incentivize
SMR development and deployment, recognizing their role in addressing
climate change and achieving energy security. These efforts are paving
the way for the wider adoption of SMR technology as a key component of a
sustainable energy future. This diverse array of activities demonstrates
that the future of energy will be significantly influenced by SMRs.

Economic and Geopolitical Implications of SMRs

The widespread adoption of Small Modular Reactors
([[SMRs]{.underline}]{.mark}) [presents a paradigm shift in energy
production, carrying profound economic and geopolitical
implications]{.underline}. Beyond the [immediate benefits of job
creation and **localized** economic **growth**, SMR deployment has the
potential to reshape global energy markets and [redefine
**i**]{.mark}**nternational [r]{.mark}elations**. SMRs [offer]{.mark}
nations a pathway to [energy independence]{.mark}, reducing reliance on
volatile fossil fuel markets and [enhancing]{.mark} **energy
[security]{.mark}**. This stability becomes particularly crucial in a
world grappling with climate change and seeking sustainable energy
solutions. For investors, the SMR sector represents a burgeoning
opportunity, **[attracting capital]{.mark}** towards innovative
technologies with **long-term growth** potential. The modular nature of
SMRs allows for phased deployment, aligning with evolving energy demands
and [reducing]{.mark} **financial [risks]{.mark}** associated with
large-scale conventional nuclear projects]{.underline}. Furthermore,
SMRs can be integrated into existing grid infrastructure with greater
flexibility than traditional reactors, facilitating a smoother
transition to cleaner energy sources. [The economic benefits extend
beyond electricity generation. [SMRs]{.mark} can be [utilized
for]{.mark} district heating, [**desalination**, **hydrogen**
production]{.mark}, and other industrial applications, creating
diversified revenue streams and [supporting]{.mark} **local
[industries]{.mark}**. This versatility positions SMRs as a
[**cornerstone** of]{.mark} future [sustainable energy]{.mark}
ecosystems. From a geopolitical perspective, SMR deployment can
[shift]{.mark} the [**balance of power** in i]{.mark}nternational
[r]{.mark}elations. [Nations with]{.mark} access to [SMR]{.mark}
technology [gain a **strategic advantage** in energy security,
**reducing**]{.mark} their **[vulnerability]{.mark}** to geopolitical
pressures related to energy resources. This can [lead to]{.mark} greater
energy independence and **[influence]{.mark}** on the global stage. The
export of SMR technology and associated services can also create new
economic partnerships and **alliances**, [fostering]{.mark}
international **[cooperation]{.mark}** and development]{.underline}.
However, the geopolitical implications of SMRs also require careful
consideration. The proliferation of nuclear technology, even in the form
of smaller reactors, raises concerns about nuclear security and the
potential misuse of sensitive materials. International cooperation and
robust regulatory frameworks are essential to mitigate these risks and
ensure the peaceful and responsible development of SMR technology. The
development and deployment of [[SMRs are]{.underline}]{.mark}
intrinsically linked to policy decisions and regulatory frameworks.
[**Governments** play a **crucial** role in fostering innovation,
streamlining licensing processes, and establishing safety
standards]{.underline}. Incentives such as tax credits, research grants,
and loan guarantees can accelerate SMR development and deployment,
driving private sector investment and creating a competitive market for
SMR technologies. International collaboration on regulatory
harmonization can further facilitate the global adoption of SMRs,
ensuring consistent safety and security standards worldwide. [The future
of energy security and the fight against **climate change** are
**intertwined** with the successful development and deployment of SMRs.
These advanced reactors offer a viable pathway to **[a]{.mark}**
cleaner, more sustainable, and secure energy future, with far-reaching
economic and geopolitical consequences for nations and the global
community as a whole]{.underline}.

The Future of SMRs: A Path to Sustainable Nuclear Energy

The future of Small Modular Reactors ([SMRs]{.underline}) hinges on a
confluence of factors, including continuous technological advancements,
robust regulatory frameworks, and strong public-private partnerships.
These advanced reactors [represent a potential paradigm shift in energy
production, offering a sustainable and]{.underline} potentially
[**game-changing [solution]{.mark}** [to climate change]{.mark}. To
fully realize the transformative potential of SMRs]{.underline},
concerted efforts across research, development, policy, and investment
are crucial. Research and development efforts must prioritize safety
enhancements, increased efficiency, and improved cost-effectiveness. For
instance, exploring innovative materials for reactor construction and
developing advanced fuel cycles can significantly enhance SMR
performance and safety profiles. Examples include accident-tolerant
fuels and high-temperature gas-cooled reactor designs, which offer
inherent safety advantages and increased thermal efficiency. [Government
policies and regulations will play a crucial role in shaping SMR
deployment and fostering a sustainable nuclear energy future. [**Clear**
and **streamlined**]{.mark} regulatory [**pathways** are essential for
attracting investment and accelerating SMR
deployment]{.mark}]{.underline}. International collaboration on
regulatory harmonization can further expedite the licensing process and
facilitate global SMR adoption. Furthermore, targeted policies such as
tax incentives, loan guarantees, and carbon pricing mechanisms can
create a favorable market environment for SMRs and incentivize private
sector investment. Public-private partnerships are essential for driving
innovation and commercialization. Collaborations between government
agencies, research institutions, and private companies can leverage
expertise and resources to accelerate SMR development and deployment.
Successful examples include the public-private partnerships supporting
the development of NuScale's SMR design in the United States and
Terrestrial Energy's Integral Molten Salt Reactor in Canada. [Investing
in SMR technology represents a strategic opportunity to address climate
change and enhance energy security. SMRs offer a scalable and flexible
source of clean energy that can decarbonize various sectors, including
electricity generation, industrial processes, and district heating.
Their smaller size and modularity make them ideal for remote locations
and developing countries, expanding access to reliable and sustainable
energy sources. Moreover, SMRs can contribute to a more **diversified**
energy **portfolio**, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and enhancing
national energy independence]{.underline}. Public perception and
acceptance remain critical for the successful integration of SMRs.
Transparent communication and public engagement initiatives are
essential to address concerns about nuclear safety, waste management,
and proliferation risks. Educating the public about the advanced safety
features of SMRs and the benefits of clean nuclear energy can build
trust and foster greater acceptance. Ultimately, realizing the full
potential of SMRs requires a holistic approach that encompasses
technological innovation, regulatory frameworks, public-private
partnerships, and proactive public engagement. [By fostering a
**supportive ecosystem** for SMR development and deployment, we can
**[unlock]{.mark}** a path towards a [sustainable nuclear energy
**future** that addresses climate change, enhances energy security, and
drives]{.mark} economic [growth]{.mark}]{.underline}.

1\. Introduction

[In recent years, there has been [**widespread interest** in
SMRs]{.mark}]{.underline} (small modular reactors). These would generate
between 10 and 300 MWe of electricity, with power levels much smaller
than those of reactor designs that are now standard \[1e3\]. [These
reactors are aimed at solving some of the multiple problems plaguing the
nuclear industry and allow the possibility of using nuclear power
[in]{.mark} **market niches** that have previously been difficult to
enter. These market niches include **[developing countries]{.mark}**
with smaller electric grids, **[remote locations]{.mark}**, water
**desalination**]{.underline}, and industrial heat supply \[4e6\].

There are a very wide variety of SMR designs with distinct
characteristics that are being developed. Many of them are light water
reactors, the leading reactor-type that is currently deployed around the
world,1 but there are also many designs that are radically different
(Table 1). Several countries are developing and planning to construct
SMRs, including the United States, Russia, China, France, Japan, South
Korea, India, and Argentina. [Many [expect the SMR **market** to be
**large**]{.mark}. One widely cited assessment]{.underline} from 2009
[concludes that there could be between 43 and 96 small modular reactors
(SMRs) in operation around the world by 2030]{.underline} \[8\]. In
2006, Advanced Systems Technology and Management, Inc., a management
consulting company, projected that [SMRs will capture [**30 percent** of
the future market]{.mark} for nuclear reactors]{.underline}, which it
estimated at around 1000 GW; assuming "an average SMR size of 300 MWe,
this implies some 1000 units by 2050" \[9\]. For the United States, the
Energy Policy Institute in Idaho projected a "moderate case" involving
about 150 SMRs and a "disruptive case" involving about 550 units by 2030
\[10\]. [Though these figures are only tentative projections, the
[belief]{.mark} that there will be a substantial market for SMRs seems
to be widely held [by]{.mark} policy makers in **[many
countries]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There are, of course, many who are
skeptical of this proposition \[12,13\].

Further, [the general expectation is that the [**first movers** will
have]{.mark} a considerable [advantage in]{.mark} capturing the
[global]{.mark} SMR [market]{.mark} and this would help create domestic
jobs in the design and manufacture of these technologies]{.underline}.
Partly for this reason, many countries have provided substantial
government support for the development of such reactors. In the United
States, for example, the Department of Energy has offered up to \$452
million to support engineering, design certification, and licensing of
two SMR designs. However, most of these countries also realize that
there are multiple vendors offering such products. [The
U.S.]{.underline} Department of Commerce's International Trade
Administration, for example, [sees]{.underline} "[**intense** foreign
**competition**]{.underline}, primarily by state-owned or statealigned
enterprises" [as a significant challenge or obstacle]{.underline}
\[14\]. Likewise, South Korea also stresses "export competitiveness"
because of "intense competition among nuclear suppliers" \[15\].

There are multiple challenges that confront vendors of SMRs \[16\], with
an important one being their licensing. While not strictly necessary for
exports to other countries, [the general expectation is that each SMR
design should be [licensed in]{.mark} one or more countries, typically
their [**"home" country** as the **first step** to
deployment]{.mark}]{.underline}.4 This, in turn, is based on the
assumption that [[countries]{.mark} may be [**more hesitant** to
purchase]{.mark} a [SMR when the design has not received its
**originating** nation's]{.mark} regulatory stamp of
**[approval]{.mark}**]{.underline}.5 The IAEA (International Atomic
Energy Agency) offers the following recommendation to countries
considering their first nuclear power plant: "[Choosing a nuclear
reactor design that is [finalized]{.mark} and frozen, particularly one
that has undergone licensing [review]{.mark} in other countries, can
**[minimize]{.mark}** project **[uncertainties]{.mark}**. While some
modifications may be needed due to local regulatory requirements or due
to the special characteristics of a site, a complete design helps to
ensure that the project will be **within budget** and
**schedule**]{.underline}" \[18\].

### Solvency\-\--Alaska Key\-\--2AC

#### An Alaskan SMR pilot program [cements national security]{.underline} and [spills up to other Arctic regions.]{.underline} 

\-\--BE CAREFUL SINCE THIS CARD IS TALKING ABOUT AN ARCTIC PILOT PROGRAM
THAT ALR HAPPENED

**Air Force '6/11**. The US Air Force (\"Microreactor pilot reaches
major project milestone\",
https://www.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/4213048/microreactor-pilot-reaches-major-project-milestone/,
6-11-2025). Accessed 6-29-2025 by NT-RM.

"This [[**microreactor pilot**]{.mark} could [position Alaska]{.mark}
and the nation [at the **forefront of energy
innovation**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [[leading us to]{.mark}
a]{.underline} new [era of [safe]{.mark}, secure, [and reliable
energy]{.mark}]{.underline}," said Secretary of the Air Force Troy
Meink. "[It has the potential to shape future approaches to [**powering
national security** infrastructure]{.mark}, [especially in the
**Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline}---[[where]{.mark} energy [reliability is
vital]{.mark}]{.underline} in the face of evolving threats."

This [initiative]{.underline} is rooted in key legislative and executive
initiatives, including Section 327 of the 2019 National Defense
Authorization Act and the 2021 Executive Order 13972, which [promotes
[s]{.mark}mall [m]{.mark}odular [r]{.mark}eactors for national defense
and space exploration]{.underline}. Additionally, the announcement
[[supports]{.underline}]{.mark} the current administration's commitment
to [accelerating [American energy production, strengthening
**national**]{.mark} **energy [security]{.mark}**, and the expansion of
advanced nuclear energy technology for national security]{.underline}
(EO 14154, Unleashing American Energy, EO 14156, Declaring a National
Energy Emergency, and EO 14299, Deploying Advanced Nuclear Reactor
Technologies for National Security). 

[[Microreactors]{.mark} are next-generation nuclear energy systems,
[capable of]{.mark} safely [producing **1-50**]{.mark}]{.underline}
megawatts ([[MW]{.underline}]{.mark}) [of reliable, continuous
electricity [without]{.mark} requiring [connection to]{.mark} the
[commercial grid]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Designed for safety and
security]{.underline}, [these]{.underline} compact [reactors [can
operate for **years without refueling**, ensuring **uninterrupted
energy** supply at]{.mark}]{.underline} almost [[any
location]{.underline}.]{.mark} 

#### Alaska is the [ideal]{.underline} deployment ground and DAs are thumped by [small scale]{.underline} models.

[[Eielson]{.mark} AF [Base]{.mark} was [named]{.mark} as a military
installation [to]{.mark} site and **[demonstrate]{.mark} the
[feasibility]{.mark}** [of a]{.mark} [microreactor]{.mark}]{.underline}.
This is being done to demonstrate the capability of an MR to supply
power in the event that the base's main source of power goes offline
(Ellis, 2022). Currently, Eielson AF Base uses a 70-year-old, 15 MW
coal-fired heat and power plant, with diesel fuel for back-up (Ibid).
The request for proposals reflects a call for construction of a facility
to [accommodate an MR that would generate up to 5 MW and operate for 10
years, until its fuel is spent]{.underline}. "The plan calls for
construction to begin in three years and for the reactor to begin
generating power in 2027" (Ibid). The MR will be licensed by the U.S.
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and commercially owned and operated. This
initiative reflects actions for the Microreactor Pilot Program that were
initiated in response to the Fiscal Year 2019 National Defense
Authorization Act requirement to construct and operate an MR by the end
of 2027 (Sec. of the Air Force, 2022).

Alaska - Remote Communities, Studies, and Legislation

[[Alaska has **unique energy needs**]{.mark}, with remote communities
reflecting considerably]{.underline} [higher electricity
costs]{.underline}. Compared to the December 2022 national average power
cost of 15 cents/kWh, the weighted average residential rate before the
Power Cost Equalization (PCE) [Program support was paid in Alaska
equaled]{.underline} 47 cents/kWh (EIA, 2023; AEA, 2023) (see also Nome
Energy Overview for more discussion of PCE costs). [These
[challenges]{.mark} have [spurred]{.mark} **communities** and **[energy
cooperatives]{.mark}** in the region [to look for]{.mark} more
[**cost-effective** solutions]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the early 2000s,
the remote village of Galena studied the potential for installing a
small nuclear reactor with Toshiba corporation, but the technology and
regulation were not ready (Interviews, 2022-2023; Chaney et al. 2008).
Since then, many new SMRs have been developed and are being examined as
options across the U.S. and abroad. Copper Valley Electric Association
near Glennallen, Alaska is exploring the possible deployment of a MR.
The University of Alaska Fairbanks has been watching the development of
the technology, especially availability to permit and deploy (Rhode,
2022). Copper Valley Electric has partnered with Ultra Safe Nuclear
Corporation to assess the technical feasibility of a 10MW microreactor
facility, considering cost, operations and social acceptance regionally
(Ultra Safe Nuclear, 2022). In May 2022, [Alaska also passed significant
legislation through SB 177 which designated the Department of
Environmental Conservation to permit nuclear reactors rather than the
Legislature, in the [hopes of helping]{.mark} Alaskan
[communities]{.mark} to **[reach]{.mark} [net-zero carbon]{.mark}
goals**]{.underline} (Segall, 2022). (See also Policies Section).

Nuclear Executive Orders

On May 23, 2025, [President [Trump issued]{.mark} **four
[E]{.mark}xecutive [O]{.mark}rder[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}, entitled
\"**[[Reinvigorating]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [Nuclear Industrial
Base]{.underline}\", \"Reforming [[Nuclear]{.mark} Reactor Testing at
the Department of [Energy]{.mark}]{.underline}\", \"Ordering the Reform
of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission\", and \"Deploying Advanced Nuclear
Reactor Technologies for National Security\", [[which]{.mark} intend to
**broadly [expand]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} [support]{.mark}]{.underline}
the production and [[use of nuclear energy]{.mark}]{.underline} with the
goal of [reestablishing the United States as a **global leader** in the
sector]{.underline}. The Executive Orders mandate multiple governmental
agencies to identify the current state of nuclear fuel, waste disposal
and uranium conversion capacity, and recommend policies to improve these
capabilities, reduce regulation where possible, and provide for
government funding of nuclear projects and their related supply chains.
[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} Executive [[Orders also
**mandate**]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[acceleration of the
**licensing**]{.mark} **approval** [process]{.mark} for new nuclear
reactors]{.underline} and the creation of a pilot program for reactor
construction and operation.

[[These]{.mark} Executive [Orders]{.mark} demonstrate]{.underline} the
[**importance** the current administration places on
nuclear]{.underline} energy, which is considered crucial to [[support
energy **intensive industries**]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly [data
centers for **artificial intelligence**]{.underline}. According to the
International Energy Agency, \"China and the United States are the most
significant regions for data center electricity consumption growth,
accounting for nearly 80% of global growth to 2030, with a consumption
increase of around 240 TWh (up 130%) compared to the 2024 level\".^1^

Adapting the legal and regulatory framework to accelerate the
development and deployment of nuclear technologies and increase the use
of nuclear power in the energy mix has become a national priority in the
United States.

Strengthening and Financing the Nuclear Fuel Cycle

As nuclear has made a dramatic comeback these last few years after
decades of disinterest, the nuclear sector needs to rebuild not only its
supply chain but also its workforce. These last few years have seen a
resurgence of innovation through the development of numerous new
reactors by historic nuclear vendors (i.e. Westinghouse and GE-Hitachi),
national laboratories (i.e. Idaho and Oak Ridge) and start-ups (i.e.
Holtec, NuScale, Last Energy and X-Energy). According to the
International Atomic Energy Agency (\"IAEA\"), over 20 small modular
reactor (\"SMR\") designs are currently under development in the U.S.,
and around 15 SMR start-ups have been established---highlighting the
vibrant innovation driving the American nuclear sector.

The \"[[**Reinvigorating** the Nuclear Industrial Base]{.mark}\"
Executive Order]{.underline} includes provisions that [[strengthen
**education**]{.mark}**al** pathways [in the industry and
increases]{.mark}]{.underline} potential [[funding of nuclear
projects]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Executive Order [directs the
Secretary of Energy]{.underline}, through the Loan Programs Office of
the Department of Energy (\"DOE\"), [to prioritize making available
resources]{.underline} for restarting closed nuclear power plants,
increase power output of operating nuclear power plants, complete
construction of nuclear reactors that were prematurely suspended,
construct new advanced SMRs, and improve the nuclear fuel supply chain.
By the end of this year, the Secretary of Energy and the Administrator
of the Small Business Administration must prioritize funding for
qualified advanced nuclear reactor technologies through grants, loans,
investment capital, funding opportunities, and other available support.
In this respect, the DOE is also instructed to prioritize work with the
nuclear energy industry to facilitate 5 gigawatt of power uprates to
existing nuclear reactors and have 10 new large reactors with complete
designs under construction by 2030. [[One of the **latest
initiatives**]{.mark} to fund the nuclear sector]{.underline} has been
the DOE\'s Generation III+ SMR program^2^, which [is [intended to fund
up to]{.mark} US\$ [**900 million** for]{.mark} the [deployment of
**advanced** nuclear reactors]{.mark}]{.underline} by scaling the
production and deployment of reactors to stimulate nuclear industry.

#### They possess economic and technical advantages enabling deployment.

**Iyer '14** \[Gokul, Nathan Hultman, Steve Fetter, Son Kim; July 6;
Earth Scientist at JGCRI and University of Maryland; Energy Economics,
"Implications of small modular reactors for climate change mitigation,"
vol. 45\]

From an [**economic** standpoint]{.underline}, the smaller size of the
**[[SMR]{.underline}]{.mark}** means a potential loss of economies of
scale in generation associated with large reactors, but [[**promises**
future economies]{.underline}]{.mark} of scale [[in **manufacture** and
**deployment**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Recent expert elicitations have
reported higher overnight (capital) costs for SMRs compared to GW-scale
Gen II and Gen III systems (Abdulla et al., 2013; Anadon et al., 2012;
Anadón et al., 2013). Nevertheless, [[SMRs have]{.underline}]{.mark} a
[**number** of [technical and economic
**advantages**]{.mark}]{.underline} compared to large reactors (Carelli
et al., 2010; Ingersoll, 2009; Kessides and Kuznetsov, 2012; Kuznetsov,
2008; Rosner and Goldberg, 2011). First, unlike large reactors, [SMR
[designs are]{.mark} **[compact]{.mark}**]{.underline} because a number
of [components such as steam gen]{.underline}erators,
[pressurizer]{.underline} and reactor coolant pumps are integrated
within the reactor vessel itself rather than outside of the reactor.
Most [SMR designs [incorporate]{.mark} passive
**[safety]{.mark}**]{.underline} features2 [[that **reduce**]{.mark} or
**eliminate**]{.underline} the [[risk of fuel damage]{.mark} and
radiation]{.underline} releases related to loss of coolant or loss of
coolant flow. In addition, other features of the SMR such as a larger
surface-to-volume ratio and reduced core power density, facilitate
easier removal of heat and the use of advanced passive features (Bae et
al., 2001; Carelli et al., 2004; IAEA, 2009). SMRs also [have a [smaller
fuel inventory]{.mark}]{.underline} which [[reduces]{.mark} the
[maximum]{.mark}]{.underline} possible [[release during]{.mark} an
**[adverse event]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Kessides, 2012).

Second, because of their smaller sizes, [SMRs]{.underline} would
[[require reduced **construction** times]{.underline}]{.mark} and
[[therefore **smaller**]{.mark} interest
**[payments]{.mark}**]{.underline} during [construction]{.underline}
(Abdulla et al., 2013). In other words, [SMRs]{.underline} are [[likely
to be financially **less risky**]{.underline}]{.mark} compared to large
reactors. Third, [the [modularity]{.mark}]{.underline} of SMRs [[permits
**scaling**]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[power plant]{.underline}]{.mark}
to larger sizes [[based on]{.mark} [**incremental** needs]{.mark} for
energy]{.underline} and [compatibility]{.underline} with the [electrical
grid infrastructure]{.underline}. Modularity offers other benefits not
only by [[reducing]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**front-end** investment
and]{.mark} [facilitating]{.mark}]{.underline} initial
[[deployment]{.underline}]{.mark} but also [**enhancing** temporal and
spatial **flexibility**]{.underline} in investment. The latter feature
is an important distinction from large reactors because it creates an
option value: under uncertainty in future electricity prices, investment
in large reactors is very risky as a large portion of the investment is
sunk and irreversible. On the other hand, in spite of higher overnight
costs, the modularity feature of [SMRs [offers]{.mark}]{.underline} a
[[**better control** over market risk]{.mark} to
**investors**]{.underline} (as investment can be split more easily to
match market demand) and so the risk premium is lower(Gollier et al.,
2005).

Finally, [SMRs [can be **mass produced** in]{.mark}]{.underline} a
[[factory]{.underline}]{.mark} and shipped to the site. [Mass
[production could facilitate]{.mark}]{.underline} and [accelerate
**[cost reductions]{.mark}**]{.underline} due to learning. Empirical
evidence on cost reductions due to increasing capacity in the nuclear
industry is mixed. In the past, several scholars found evidence of
learning and experience spillovers leading to a lowering of costs in the
nuclear industry (Lester and McCabe, 1993; Zimmerman, 1982). On the
other hand, other scholars argued that increased construction times due
to increased size and complexity of reactors coupled with new
environmental, health and safety regulations led to escalating capital
as well as operating and maintenance costs (Cantor and Hewlett, 1988;
Hewlett, 1996; Joskow and Rose, 1985). Similar findings have been
reported by more recent studies that emphasize that the site-specific
nature of deployment makes standardization difficult, so cost reductions
have not been achieved and are not likely in the future (Cooper, 2010;
Grübler, 2010; Hultman and Koomey, 2007; Hultman et al., 2007). However,
in the case of SMRs, several scholars argue that cost savings can be
achieved through off-site fabrication of modules (which facilitates
standardization), as well as learning-by-doing through the production of
multiple, simple modules with shorter construction times (Abdulla et
al., 2013; Kessides, 2012; Rosner and Goldberg, 2011). In addition,
Rangel and Lévêque (2012) used detailed data for French reactors and
argued that while overall experience did not translate into lower costs,
some [[gains]{.mark} were [achieved due to]{.mark}]{.underline} the
[[**construction** of]{.mark} standard]{.underline} [[reactor
types]{.underline}]{.mark}. This finding is relevant to SMRs, which are
likely to be co-sited and the same type of reactors are likely to be
produced in larger numbers (Abdulla et al., 2013; Carelli et al., 2010).
In the subsequent section, we discuss some of the policy rationales put
forth by SMR proponents for promoting the deployment of SMRs.

designs, more advanced, propose novel features and rely less on
well-tested equipment and processes, which is likely to lengthen the
licensing process.

2.4 Value Proposition

NEA (2021, 24-26) has delineated three kinds of benefits of [[SMR
deployment]{.underline}]{.mark} that, together, [[compose]{.mark} the
[**value** proposition]{.mark} of nuclear investments [and]{.mark}, as
such, are likely to [constitute the **business case**]{.mark} for
SMRs]{.underline}.

2.4.1 Financial Benefits

[Due to **[lower capital costs]{.mark}**, SMRs are more affordable than
their classical counterparts, which [translate]{.mark} in[to
**reduced**]{.mark} **capital [risk]{.mark}** to investors [and access
to]{.mark} more [diversified]{.mark} sources of
**[funding]{.mark}**.]{.underline} SMRs promise to reduce the costs of
financing, thanks to a lower cost per MW of installed capacity and
shorter construction timeframes compared to large-scale NPPs. Then,
because of their scalability (i.e., ability to add modules), SMRs can be
built with less upfront investment. At the same time, [modularity
[allows for better **management** of]{.mark} financial [risks]{.mark},
thanks to higher availability of financial sources and to adjustment of
demand on the power market]{.underline}.

### Solvency\-\--AT: Costs\-\--2AC

#### SMRs are economically viable, reduced manufacturing costs rely on aff deployment. (others studies are wrong bc they only consider factors in isolation) 

**Vanatta et al 24** -- William Stewart, Michael Craig, and Max Vanatta,
University of Michigan School for Environment and Sustainability, Ann
Arbor Doctorate in Resource Policy and Behavior advised by Dr. Michael
Craig. Research centered on a) the energy transition, combining policy,
technology, and equity lenses to understand the future of the power
system and b) economically decarbonization of high heat industrial
industries. "The role of policy and module manufacturing learning in
industrial decarbonization by small modular reactors," Nature Energy
Journal, IS10, pg. 77--89.//ATarnas

https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-024-01665-w

Thus, [the [decarbonization]{.mark} of industrial heat [with SMRs will
hinge on]{.mark} two factors: [the techno-economic potential of
SMR]{.mark}s in decarbonizing industrial heat processes, [and]{.mark}
the [ability]{.mark} of SMRs [to realize capital cost reductions with
increasing deployment.]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}By jointly
considering these factors, [[SMR deployment pathways]{.mark} in industry
[can be established]{.mark}, [in which economically viable SMR
deployments]{.mark} beget cost reductions that [make other deployments
economically viable]{.mark}.]{.underline} Yet, [[existing studies only
address these factors in isolation]{.mark}.]{.underline} Initial
technological evaluation studies have found that SMRs of varying designs
do have potential in industrial heat applications without consideration
of
economics[4](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-024-01665-w#ref-CR4)^,^[20](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-024-01665-w#ref-CR20).
Further studies address the techno-economic potential of SMRs assuming
fixed capital
costs[3](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-024-01665-w#ref-CR3)^,^[27](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-024-01665-w#ref-CR27).
These studies find that, [when in competition with other fuels such as
natural gas or other low-carbon fuels, SMRs can offer the most
profitable pathway]{.underline} when delivered natural gas is at or
above US\$8 per metric million British thermal unit (MMBtu). Other
studies evaluate possible learning rates for SMRs either to quantify the
necessary deployment volume required to reach parity with other
technologies[28](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-024-01665-w#ref-CR28) or
to isolate the potential differences with NPPs benefitting from their
scale and
design[23](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-024-01665-w#ref-CR23).
Neither of these studies considers the techno-economic potential of SMRs
with specific consumer contexts, which is ultimately what will drive SMR
deployment and learning.

Here, we integrate these factors to achieve two goals: (1) to identify
techno-economically viable deployment pathways for SMRs in industrial
process heat decarbonization and (2) to quantitatively examine the
effect of various policies in driving long-term SMR deployment. [We find
that [there is]{.mark} modest to [substantial potential for SMR]{.mark}
deployment in providing industrial process heat,]{.underline}
[but]{.mark} [[deployment]{.mark} [varies]{.mark} [greatly
with]{.mark}]{.underline} natural gas price, [[policy
incentives]{.mark}, first-of-a-kind (FOAK) cost escalations and ability
to learn within factories.]{.underline} From 2021 US industrial average
natural gas prices of US\$6 per MMBtu to liquified natural gas benchmark
prices of US\$10 per MMBtu, 7--55 gigawatt-thermal (GW~t~) of SMRs could
be profitably deployed if projected FOAK costs are met. Of this
deployment, 2--24 GW~t~ rely on module manufacturing learning within a
factory, although FOAK cost escalations associated with pioneer plants
could substantially reduce or eliminate our estimated SMR deployment
potential.

### Solvency\-\--AT: Trump Circumvents\-\--2AC

#### The plan is [popular with Trump]{.underline}. He sees nuclear energy as a core component of [national security]{.underline}, [leadership]{.underline}, [business opportunities]{.underline}.

Donald [[Trump]{.mark} has [signaled that **energy leadership**
will]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[be a **core component** of its]{.mark}
foreign and security policy [strategy]{.mark} in his second
term]{.underline}. Although the two presidencies' views could not be
more different on accelerating the clean energy transition, [advancing
**[SMR diplomacy]{.mark}**]{.underline} in Europe [[serves]{.mark}
critical [U.S. national interests **regardless of
ideology**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [strategic rationale [focuses on
**economic**, **geopolitical**, and **tech**]{.mark}nological
**[leadership]{.mark}** factors]{.underline}. [From an economic point of
view, the]{.underline} European [SMR [market is a **significant
commercial opportunity** for]{.mark} American
**[companies]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [As]{.underline} European [nations
seek to reduce carbon emission]{.underline}s and commit to do so in the
National Energy and Climate Plans submitted to the European Commission,
[the demand for SMRs is likely to **grow substantially.**]{.underline}
[Geopolitically, SMR diplomacy serves as a **powerful tool** to
strengthen the transatlantic alliance and help **reduce Europe's energy
dependence** on regimes whose strategic agendas run counter to U.S.
national interests, such as [Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}. One must also
take into account that the [PRC committed to selling 30 overseas nuclear
reactors to its **Belt and Road Initiative partners** by 2030
and]{.underline} that [[Beijing]{.mark} is leading in the launch of
cost-competitive SMRs. From a **[Great Power Competition]{.mark}**
perspective, advancing [SMR leadership]{.mark}]{.underline} in Europe
[would [allow the U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited
[[S]{.underline}t]{.mark}ates [[to **shape**]{.mark} **international
[norms]{.mark}** [and **safety**]{.mark} **protocols**, [while
**maintaining**]{.mark} **the [edge]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the

With nineteenth-century power dynamics resurgent, the former U.S.
diplomat Mary Thompson-Jones's recent book, America in the Arctic,
offers a timely and informative narrative of how the United States
acquired and maintained its status as an Arctic power. After a largely
successful history of building a U.S. presence in the Arctic,
Thompson-Jones warns, [[Washington]{.underline}]{.mark} is now [[paying
**insufficient**]{.mark} [**attention** to a]{.mark} region that has
become]{.underline} a [[**focus** of the world]{.mark}'s great
powers]{.underline}.

Even in the short time since America in the Arctic was written, [new
developments]{.underline} have [raised the stakes]{.underline}. After
taking office, Trump trained his sights on potential Arctic
acquisitions, making frequent, controversial references to Canada as
"the 51st state" and vowing that the United States would "get"
Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark, "one way or another."
[[Cooperation]{.mark} between Russia and China]{.underline}, meanwhile,
has been [[growing since]{.mark} their]{.underline} 2022 [[announcement
of]{.mark} an "**u[nlimited partnership]{.mark}**]{.underline},"
[which]{.underline} in the Arctic has [translated to
**[joint]{.mark}**]{.underline} scientific, space, and [**[military
op]{.mark}eration[s]{.mark}**,]{.underline} including coast guard and
naval patrols. And Washington's recent outreach to Moscow has introduced
a wildcard: should talks yield some kind of grand bargain, the
[resulting **[geopolitical realignment]{.mark}**]{.underline} could
[[change the game]{.underline}]{.mark} entirely.

Whatever happens, a [[**contest** over]{.underline}]{.mark} critical
**[[minerals]{.underline}]{.mark}**, maritime
**[[routes]{.underline}]{.mark}**, fisheries, [natural
**[resources]{.mark}**,]{.underline} seabed [**[mining]{.mark}**,
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} satellite
**[[comm]{.underline}]{.mark}**unication[**[s]{.mark}** is
[coming]{.mark}]{.underline}, and the [U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is not ready]{.underline} for it. For years,
[Russia and China]{.underline} have been [preparing to take advantage
of]{.underline} new Arctic shipping [routes]{.underline},
**[improving]{.underline}** their undersea **[military]{.underline}**
and scientific **[capabilities]{.underline}**, and [honing]{.underline}
their [hybrid warfare tactics]{.underline} while U.S. attention has been
elsewhere. To compete, the [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [will its]{.underline} [[need to
**dramatically increase**]{.mark}]{.underline} military, economic,
scientific, and diplomatic **[[presence]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the
Arctic, in close cooperation with U.S. allies. If Washington does not
resolve the deficiencies and contradictions of its Arctic strategy soon,
it may find that it has already lost the new great game.

MEET THE CONTESTANTS

Thompson-Jones provides a rich history of the United States' experience
in the Arctic, including its active role in shaping the Arctic policies
of Canada, Denmark (via Greenland), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia,
and Sweden, incorporating memorable vignettes from each Arctic country.
A former U.S. diplomat who served in Canada, Thompson-Jones conveys her
deep admiration for the people who live in the Arctic and her
appreciation of the unrelenting effects of climate change, the desire
for security, and the value of friends and allies "when the ice breaks,"
as the Inuit proverb goes. The book closes with a stark---and
accurate---lament of Washington's distinct lack of ambition in its
recent Arctic policies. Thompson-Jones, writing before the U.S.
presidential election last year, recommends that future leaders increase
their focus on climate change and multilateral diplomacy in an expansive
Arctic strategy. That advice, unfortunately, quickly became outdated
with the return of Trump.

More likely to suit the sensibilities of the U.S. president is
Thompson-­Jones's suggestion that the United States have what she calls a
"Longyear moment"---a reference to a Midwestern industrialist named John
Longyear, who in 1901 sailed to the Svalbard archipelago in the sea
north of mainland Norway and "saw iron ore and big possibilities." In
1906, Longyear founded the Arctic Coal Company and sought to build and
sustain an industrial presence in the Arctic, with the eventual support
of the U.S. government. Thompson-Jones writes that this venture
represented a "profound conceptual shift" in U.S. approaches to the
Arctic, ushering in an era of heightened ambition.

Over a century later, the [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[needs to pursue "big possibilities]{.underline}" in the Arctic once
again if it is [to compete with]{.underline} its rivals, [Russia and
China. All]{.underline} three players [are invested in the
region]{.underline}, but in different ways. For Russia, which holds vast
swaths of Arctic territory, the region is vital to its military and
economic survival. For China, the Arctic represents an opportunity to
diversify its global economic interests. And [for the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, which secured its Arctic
presence with the 1867 purchase of the territory of Alaska from
Russia---a sale that Dmitry Rogozin, Russia's former deputy prime
minister, has described as a "betrayal of Russian power status"---the
[region is a]{.underline} northern [frontline of defense]{.underline}.

The Arctic animates Russian President Vladimir Putin's geopolitical
strategy. He seeks to develop a maritime passageway, the Northern Sea
Route, that traverses Russia's northern coastal waters and is dotted
with new port infrastructure linked by rail to the country's sub-Arctic
regions. A new fleet of Russian icebreakers would escort registered
vessels along the route, which would facilitate the export of Russian
natural resources and the east-west transit of Chinese goods. In that
kind of large-scale project, Thompson-Jones traces echoes of a brutal
legacy: the savagery of the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin's Arctic
infrastructure campaign, in which roads, railways, and mines were built
by prisoners and forced laborers, many of whom died during the
construction. One road was known as "the Bone Road" because so many
workers were buried in its foundation that "there is one body for every
meter of road."

Putin's economic and military buildup in the region is less ruthless
than Stalin's but similarly ambitious, driven by Russia's chronic sense
of insecurity and fear of losing control over its territory. After the
collapse of the Soviet Union, Arctic military bases were closed, damaged
infrastructure was left unrepaired, and many Arctic populations, cut off
from state subsidies, moved elsewhere. Today, Russian authorities are
trying to prevent a further deterioration of the Arctic population by
delaying residents' requests to leave. Polar gulags are also the
preferred place to send political prisoners who threaten the government,
such as the opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who died under suspicious
circumstances in one such prison in 2024. Russia is constructing and
refurbishing Arctic military bases, in part to improve its monitoring
capabilities as commercial activity increases along the Northern Sea
Route. The sudden appearance of Russian flags, crosses, and Orthodox
priests across not just the Russian Arctic but also, worryingly, the
Norwegian High North are declarations of Russia's past, present, and
future ownership.

\[FIGURE OMITTED\]

China joined the Arctic game more recently. Despite lacking Arctic
territory of its own, China has declared itself a "near Arctic" state on
the basis of fifteenth-century maps and its interest in Arctic
governance. Beginning in 2004, when it established its first research
station on Svalbard, it has used scientific cooperation to boost its
Arctic presence and knowledge. Later, China pursued business ventures
with Canada and the Nordic states, but these countries were wary of its
investment terms---and under pressure from Washington---and slowly
restricted Beijing's access. Another opening came with Russia's invasion
of Ukraine in February 2022. As Moscow faced the loss of its European
markets, the end of its partnerships with Western energy companies, and
wartime budgetary limitations, it welcomed Chinese investment as a way
to fill the gap. China increased funding for Russia's liquefied natural
gas projects in the Arctic and related infrastructure development along
the Northern Sea Route, expanding its commercial presence in the region.

For its part, the United States has been an Arctic economic power since
it acquired Alaska to secure access to the territory's natural
resources. It first attempted to purchase Greenland in 1868 for the same
reason. (Further attempts to acquire the island---in 1910, 1946, and
2019---had a mix of economic and security motives.) After World War II,
the United States expanded its Arctic presence through a network of
regional alliances and infrastructure projects. In the 1950s, it built
the Distant Early Warning Line, a string of radar stations that
traversed Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Iceland, and the Faroe Islands and
remained operational until 1993 to defend against a potential Soviet
missile attack. In cooperation with Canada, the United States
constructed the Alaska Highway and created an integrated air defense
system known as NORAD. Together with NATO allies, U.S. forces patrolled
the waters and airspace of the North Atlantic, particularly around
Greenland, Iceland, and the United Kingdom, to detect Soviet, and later,
Russian nuclear submarines and bombers.

The [[Arctic]{.mark} remains [**vital** to U.S]{.mark}. **economic** and
**security [interests]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Anchorage,
[[Alaska]{.underline}]{.mark}, is [[home to the]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**fourth-[busiest]{.mark}** cargo **[airport]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
the world. Nearly [[all]{.mark} of the **[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates' **[[radar]{.underline}]{.mark}**
systems **[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** ground-based missile
[**[interceptors]{.mark}** are [located in the
state]{.mark}]{.underline}, whose high latitude enables earlier
detection of incoming threats. Recent [bilateral defense
agreements]{.underline} with all five Nordic countries and the accession
of Finland and Sweden to NATO, in 2023 and 2024, respectively, have
[strengthened collective defense in the Arctic]{.underline}. But
[[Washington]{.underline}]{.mark} has [**[neglected]{.mark}** its **[own
capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the region. U.S. military
[[officials]{.underline}]{.mark} often [[decry]{.underline}]{.mark} the
**[[lack of]{.underline}]{.mark}** port and [aviation
**[infrastructure]{.mark}**, icebreakers, satellites, sensors,
and]{.underline} cold-weather equipment and [training]{.underline} that
are [[necessary to defend]{.mark} Arctic
[territory]{.mark}.]{.underline}

THE GAME BOARD

The prize that Russia, China, and the United States are all after is
control. As the American aviator Billy Mitchell quipped in 1935,
"[[Whoever holds Alaska]{.mark} will [hold the world]{.mark}."
[**Control** of Arctic]{.mark} land offers]{.underline} several
advantages. Crossing over polar regions

that]{.underline} cargo [vessels]{.underline}, air[planes]{.underline},
undersea [cables, or]{.underline} intercontinental ballistic [missiles
[must travel]{.mark}]{.underline} to reach their destinations. The
**[[region hosts satellite]{.underline}]{.mark}** ground
[**[stations]{.mark}** and orbital **[launch
sites]{.mark}**]{.underline} that are [[important to]{.mark} both
civilian and [military
op]{.mark}]{.underline}eration[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}. High-latitude
communications [[infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}, although limited,
is [[vital for tracking]{.mark} vessels, monitoring weather, and
integrating]{.underline} surveillance [[systems]{.mark}. Arctic lands
and seabeds]{.underline} also [hold]{.underline} [**vast** quantities
of]{.underline} critical **[minerals and]{.underline}** energy
**[resources]{.underline}**, and [Arctic waters]{.underline} are
[becoming an]{.underline} [increasingly important source of
food]{.underline} as warming ocean temperatures compel fish to swim
north seeking cooler waters.

With more than 70 advanced nuclear reactor projects in various stages of

Working closely with the reactor vendors and with relevant offices at
the U.S. departments of Defense (DOD) and Energy (DOE), the Nuclear
Energy Institute this week published a road map laying out the actions
needed to ensure the successful deployment of a first-of-a-kind
micro-reactor at a domestic defense installation by the end of 2027.

"Small reactors are one of the most promising new nuclear technologies
to emerge in decades," NEI Director of New Reactor Deployment Marc
Nichol said.

"**[Energy]{.underline}** [is important to our]{.underline} [**national
security**; it must be]{.underline} **[reliable]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[resilient]{.underline}** so that it's there when
our men and women in uniform need it. [Micro-reactors can
enhance]{.underline} our **[military capabilities]{.underline}** [by
providing]{.underline} that **[resilient energy]{.underline}**."

The Pentagon has been interested in small nuclear reactors for nearly a
decade, as robust and reliable power sources for military installations
within the territorial United States and overseas. The very small
"**[micro-reactor]{.underline}**" designs now emerging from companies
like General Atomics, NuScale Power LLC, Oklo Inc., Westinghouse
Electric Co. and X-energy LLC [are]{.underline} particularly **[well
aligned]{.underline}** [with]{.underline} **[DOD's]{.underline}** [needs
for energy]{.underline} **[security]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[resilience]{.underline}**.

[Micro-reactors]{.underline}, like Westinghouse\'s eVinci, [are
easily]{.underline} **[transportable]{.underline}** [and do]{.underline}
**[not]{.underline}** [need]{.underline} **[refueling]{.underline}**
[for]{.underline} **[years]{.underline}**. \[Image: Westinghouse\]

[In contrast with]{.underline} the **[large]{.underline}**
[nuclear]{.underline} **[reactors]{.underline}** in operation all over
the world that have a generating capacity of about 1,000
megawatts-electric (MWe), [micro-reactors]{.underline} are typically
less than 10 MWe in size. These smaller reactor designs
[are]{.underline} **[well-suited]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}
**[transportation]{.underline}** to [and]{.underline}
**[installation]{.underline}** [at **remote**]{.underline} [military
**bases**, where they can provide]{.underline} both [electricity and
heat for]{.underline} **[years]{.underline}** at a time
[without]{.underline} [**refueling**. They are capable of
operating]{.underline} **[independently]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}
external [electricity]{.underline} **[grids]{.underline}** [that could
be]{.underline} **[vulnerable]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}
[**threats**, natural and otherwise, in areas where DOD bases
operate]{.underline}.

[Micro-reactors are]{.underline} thus [capable of providing]{.underline}
the **[resilient energy]{.underline}** [the military needs,
providing]{.underline} primary **[power]{.underline}** [under normal
and]{.underline} **[emergency conditions]{.underline}** [and enhancing
DOD's range of]{.underline} [**operations**, endurance,]{.underline}
**[agility]{.underline}** [and mission assurance]{.underline}.

"Ultimately our goal is resilience," said Troy Warshel, director of
operations at the Pentagon's Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary
for Operational Energy at NEI's Oct. 4 press event on the publication of
the road map.

"And what does resilience mean for the Department of Defense? It means
for our critical missions, when we flip the switch---there's power. ...
We see nuclear energy as a huge potential partner in achieving our
resilience goals."

As a reflection of DOD's interest in this technology, the 2019 National
Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) that Congress passed in August directed
the secretary of energy to report to Congress within a year on the
requirements and components needed for a pilot program to "site,
construct and operate at least one licensed micro-reactor that provides
resilience for national security infrastructure at a DOD or DOE
facility."

NEI's technical report, "Road Map for the Deployment of Micro-Reactors
for U.S. Department of Defense Domestic Installations," provides
guidance and input for the pilot program. The road map outlines the
timelines and challenges for deploying the first micro-reactor at a
domestic DOD facility and recommends actions to ensure its installment
by Dec. 31, 2027, as prescribed in the NDAA.

Among NEI's recommended actions for DOD, DOE and industry are:

**[DOD]{.underline}** [should]{.underline} **[identify]{.underline}**
[the host]{.underline} **[installation]{.underline}** [and

While the road map focuses on domestic defense installations,
micro-reactors are equally suitable for forward operating bases
overseas. For these applications, the Pentagon also is interested in
micro-reactors for their potential to eliminate the need for fuel
resupply.

"Unleash us from the tether of fuel," Secretary of Defense James Mattis
is reported to have said when he was lieutenant general of the Marine
Corps in Iraq in 2003.

"The Pentagon is constantly developing new technologies to prepare for
its future challenges," Nichol added. "These **[advanced

Besides reactors for electricity generation for civilian grids,
[nuclear]{.underline} **[reactors]{.underline}** [have]{.underline} also
[been]{.underline} found [useful for]{.underline} [**military
platforms**, especially]{.underline} on [**sea**-going]{.underline}
[**vessels**, giving them]{.underline} **[greater power]{.underline}**
[for a longer time]{.underline}. In fact, nuclear power plants for
maritime applications began evolving in the United States in the 1940s.
The United States and Soviet Union have had nuclear powered submarines
since the early 1950s.1 [Unlike]{.underline} the
**[diesel]{.underline}**-electric powered
**[sub]{.underline}**marine**[s]{.underline}** [which have to surface
frequently to breathe]{.underline} air to run the generators for
charging the batteries, **[sub]{.underline}**marine**[s]{.underline}**
[with nuclear propulsion are]{.underline} **[independent]{.underline}**
of such requirement. The [much more]{.underline}
**[efficient]{.underline}** power [generation]{.underline} also [allows
higher]{.underline} **[speed]{.underline}** [and **long periods** of
**operation** without having to **refuel**]{.underline}. In fact, [they
may **not** be refuelled for their **entire** operational
**life**]{.underline} [of]{.underline} typically around **[25
years]{.underline}**. Even the most advanced electric batteries used in
the relatively newer diesel submarines can at best remain submerged for
just a few days at slow speed. This figure could reduce to just a few
hours at high speeds.2 The design of marine-type reactors is quite
different from the electricity generation reactors used for the national
power grid supply.

This paper examines the military applications of nuclear power plants.
It examines their historical dimension, their present status and likely
future applications.

Small Nuclear power Reactors

The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) defines 'small' as under
300 Megawatts electric (MWe), and up to about 700 MWe as 'medium'.3
[There is interest in **small** nuclear power **reactors**
for]{.underline} both **[military]{.underline}** and civil
[applications]{.underline}. For long, [the navy has been
using]{.underline} **[nuclear]{.underline}** powered aircraft
**[carriers]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[sub]{.underline}**marine**[s]{.underline}**. [There is]{.underline}
also [interest for]{.underline} both **[military]{.underline}** and
civilian [uses for]{.underline} **[portable]{.underline}** small [power
plants]{.underline} for use [in]{.underline} **[remote
locations]{.underline}**. While [small reactors]{.underline} require
special technologies, they [are]{.underline} **[less cost]{.underline}**
[intensive]{.underline}, especially for transmission. Experience from
nuclear powered submarines is available already. Some of these have been
generating less than 190 MW power. [Greater **demand**]{.underline}
[would also mean]{.underline} **[economy]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}
**[scale]{.underline}**. Modern [small reactors are]{.underline} being
designed to be **[modular]{.underline}**. Tere are also very small units
which are about 15 MWe, especially for remote communities.

Military Small Power Reactors

For long, the US Army has been using mobile and static [small
reactors]{.underline}. These were meant to [power]{.underline}
**[remote]{.underline}** [air/missile]{.underline} [defence radar
stations in]{.underline} **[Alaska]{.underline}**,
**[Greenland]{.underline}**, [and Antarctica, for providing
electricity]{.underline} and heating. A merchant ship called Liberty was
converted into the first experimental Floating Nuclear Power Plant
(FNPP) in mid-1960s.Te truck-mobile, and air-transportable plant was of
the size of a standard shipping container. It was operated in the Panama
Canal Zone from 1968-77.4

The US [armed forces are looking at]{.underline}
**[reducing]{.underline}** [power]{.underline} **[supply
vulnerabilities]{.underline}** [and operating]{.underline} [**costs**,
and]{.underline} also reducing [petroleum dependence]{.underline}. [Mini
Nuclear Power Plants]{.underline} (**[MNPPs]{.underline}**) [would be
**portable**]{.underline} by truck or large C-17 class aircraft [and
operate]{.underline} **[unrefuelled]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}
10-**[20 years]{.underline}**. More recently, [they have been looking
at]{.underline} mobile Small Modular Reactors ([**SMRs**)
for]{.underline} **[rapid response]{.underline}**
[scenarios]{.underline}. [These will be relevant in the case
of]{.underline} an electrical **[grid attack]{.underline}**
[or]{.underline} for [augmenting]{.underline} **[power]{.underline}**
[requirements]{.underline}. These would also be handy during
Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) operations. The
reactors should need minimal operating crew. The smaller ones, weighing
less than 40 tons, could generate around 10 MWe for around three years
without refuelling. Safety and reliability will be crucial. Fairly tight
installation and shutdown timelines have been specified by the
Department of Defence (DoD). The environmental impact has been factored
in. In March 2021, the DoD announced that "Project Pele5 " was on track,
and full-power testing of the mobile reactor was expected in 2023.
Outdoor mobile testing of the prototype micro-reactor is likely in 2024.
US firms, such as NuScale, are also working on a
**[floating]{.underline}** version of an **[SMR]{.underline}**. These
[could be used for]{.underline} the **[power]{.underline}**
[requirements of coastal areas]{.underline} when anchored close to the
shore. There are other SMR projects by Canadian and Japanese frms.
Rolls-Royce has been developing naval reactors since the 1950s, and is
also working on small test reactors.

[**[Resilience]{.mark}** is a [primary requirement]{.mark} for
DoD]{.underline}. Resilience is defined in the 2018 NDAA as "the
[[ability to]{.underline}]{.mark} avoid,
**[[prepare]{.underline}]{.mark}** for, **[[minimize,
adapt]{.underline}]{.mark}** to, [[and **recover**
from]{.underline}]{.mark} anticipated and [[unanticipated]{.mark} energy
[disruptions]{.mark} in order to ensure energy]{.underline} availability
and reliability [sufficient]{.underline} to provide [for]{.underline}
mission assurance and [readiness]{.underline}, including task critical
assets and other mission essential operations related to readiness, and
to execute or rapidly reestablish mission essential requirements." The
2018 NDAA also defines energy security as "having assured access to
reliable supplies of energy and the ability to protect and deliver
sufficient energy to meet mission essential requirements.'' [Energy
resilience must be achieved in a manner that does not negatively impact
the mission]{.underline}. Generation sources that minimize usage of
land, air and water resources, including site access for fuel receipt
and storage, will enhance the installation's ability to focus on mission
critical activities.

[Currently]{.underline}, DoD [[installations **rely** ]{.mark}**almost
entirely** [on the grid]{.mark}, which **is [highly
vulnerable]{.mark}**]{.underline} to prolonged outage from a variety of
threats, [[placing]{.mark} critical [missions at **unacceptably high
risk**]{.mark}]{.underline} of extended disruption. Backup power is
often based on diesel generator sets with limited on-site fuel storage,
undersized for new Homeland defense missions, not prioritized to
critical loads and inadequate in duration and reliability. This is
[according to]{.underline} a Defense Science Board Task Force on
[DoD]{.underline} Energy Strategy that also [found]{.underline}
"critical [national security and Homeland defense missions are at an
unacceptably high risk of extended outage]{.underline} from failure of
the grid."9

DoD Instruction 4170.11, Installation Energy Management, provides policy
direction to ensure energy resilience at military installations. Each
military branch appears to address energy resilience differently, for
example the Army contextualizes resilience in terms of energy security,
while the Air Force contextualizes resilience in terms of energy
assurance. Efforts to enhance resilience also appear to focus along the
lines in which resilience has been contextualized. 10 While the detailed
scenario and capability requirements necessary to provide resilience at
DoD installations are not known and may be unique to each facility,
there are a number of considerations that appear to be universally
important. These include minimization of outages due to maintenance and
failures, being robust against natural and man-made threats, the ability
to quickly restore critical operations, and having secure access to the
source, delivery and on-site storage of fuel. More detailed requirements
for resilience for Air Force Installations are contained in a 2017 RAND
report.11

[[Micro-reactors offer]{.mark} the ability to **assure [energy
resilience]{.mark}**]{.underline} at DoD installations.
[Micro-reactors]{.underline} can [[operate]{.underline}]{.mark} 24 hours
a day, 7 days a week, **[[365 days a year]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and
are being [designed to operate [for **several years** without]{.mark}
the need to [shutdown]{.mark}]{.underline} for refueling. Micro-reactors
are being [[designed to protect against]{.mark} severe natural phenomena
as well as]{.underline} man-made [**[physical and cyber]{.mark}**
security **[threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and many are being designed
with the ability to operate in island-mode and include black-start
capabilities. Micro-reactors are also being designed to be able to
adjust output to meet changes in demand.

Micro-reactors will be able to provide heat and other products, such as
desalinated water and hydrogen that can meet the needs of DoD
installations. [[Micro-reactors]{.underline}]{.mark} can [also
**[enhance]{.mark}**]{.underline} DoD's [[use of **new
tech**]{.mark}**nologies**, [such as]{.mark}]{.underline} advanced
[[computing]{.mark}, "big data]{.underline}" analytics,
[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}rtificial [[i]{.underline}]{.mark}ntelligence,
[autonomy]{.underline}, [robotics, [directed energy, hypersonics, and
biotech]{.mark}]{.underline}nology. The very technologies that ensure
the U.S. will be able to fight and win the wars of the future.12

#### SCENARIO 1\-\--ARCTIC WAR:

#### Russian and Chinese [ambitions]{.underline} in the Arctic are [undeniable]{.underline} and [increasing]{.underline}, that sets the stage for conflict.

**Murkins '24** \[Sydney; December 3; Master of Arts in Security
Studies, USMC; "The Future Battlefield is Melting: An Argument for Why
the U.S. Must Adopt a More Proactive Arctic Strategy,"
https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/future-battlefield-melting-argument-us-must-adopt-more-proactive-arctic-strategy/\]

The [growing **partnership** between **[Russia]{.mark}** and
**[China]{.mark}**]{.underline} provides early warning signs that the
region could [become a site of [**future**
conflict]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 2021 Russia and China renewed their
[20-year-old Sino-Russian **Treaty**]{.underline} of Good Neighborliness
and Friendly Cooperation, a move described as "an act of friendship
against America."^9)^ Moreover, both Russia and China have [deep
**historic**]{.underline} and [economic **ties**]{.underline} to the
Arctic. NATO's expansion to include [Finland and Sweden have increased
tensions]{.underline} in the region, while both Russia and China have
expressed their disapproval of NATO's increasing presence in the
Arctic.^10)^ However, despite feeling antagonized by NATO's actions,
Moscow and Beijing may not have the economic and military capacities to
reshape the current international rules-based order in the Arctic in the
near term.

Despite being the only non-NATO member in the Arctic, [[Russia
**controls**]{.mark} over [53 **percent**]{.mark} of the
Arctic]{.underline} coastline, making it a [[**decisive**]{.mark} player
in the future]{.underline} of the region.^11)^ Yet, Russia's [Arctic
[**ambitions**]{.mark} are not new]{.underline}. Russia's connection
with the Arctic can be [traced back to the sixteenth
century]{.underline}, beginning with its conquest of Siberia, which was
part of a larger [initiative]{.underline} to [search for **resources**
and **trade routes**.]{.underline}^12)^ As the nation matured, its
[Arctic ambitions]{.underline} did as well. During the Cold War, the
[Soviets [established]{.mark} both a [**nuclear** and
**naval**]{.mark}]{.underline} presence on the Kola Peninsula to project
[power against the U.S. With the **collapse**]{.underline} of the
[Soviet Union]{.underline}, [Russia]{.underline}, as the de jure
inheritor of the Soviet nuclear arsenal, [did not abandon]{.underline}
its desire to be an [[Arctic **power**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

As the [Russian **[economy]{.mark}** recovered]{.underline} in the early
2000s [[under]{.mark} Vladimir [Putin]{.mark}]{.underline}, Russia
[began **[posturing]{.mark}** for Arctic [**supremacy**,]{.mark}
[reopening]{.mark}]{.underline} multiple Soviet-era [military
[bases]{.mark}]{.underline}, modernizing its navy, and
[[developing]{.mark} new **[hypersonic]{.mark}
missile[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} designed to [evade U.S. sensors and
**defenses**]{.underline}.^13)^ Moreover, in August 2022, [Moscow
announced]{.underline} that it would [**refocus** its military power on
the **Arctic** and **Nordic**]{.underline}
[region]{.underline}.^14)^ According to Colin Wall, a research associate
at Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, "The
[[military **balance**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the [Arctic [is **heavily
weighted** towards Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}." Furthermore, the
International Institute for [Strategic Studies and Reuters cite that
Russia's bases]{.underline} inside the Arctic Circle [[outnumber
NATO's]{.underline}]{.mark} by roughly a third.^15)^ Russia's
**[remilitarization]{.underline}** of the [Arctic and its
**revitalized**]{.underline} strategic [partnership with
China]{.underline}, provides both countries with the [means to
[challenge]{.mark} the **current [Western]{.mark}**]{.underline}
rules-based [international [order]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Although [China's Arctic history]{.underline} does not mirror Russia's
centuries-old presence in the north, Beijing's desire for Arctic
[**supremacy** has **rapidly evolved**]{.underline} over the past
century. China's involvement in the Arctic began in 1925 with the
signing of the Svalbard Treaty, providing a legal basis for China to
conduct non-military activity, such as [scientific
**exploration**]{.underline}, [resource **extraction**]{.underline}, and
**[fishing]{.underline}** in the Arctic.^16)^ However, [[China's
**rationale**]{.mark} **to operate**]{.underline} in the region [extends
beyond scientific exploration]{.underline}.

In 2018 China released its first Arctic White Paper, which asserts that
it is a "Near-Arctic State."^17)^ [China [employs]{.mark} a dual
**narrative**]{.underline} to [explain]{.underline} its
[aims]{.underline} in the Arctic. Externally, Beijing appeals to foreign
audiences by [advocating for]{.underline} the [safeguarding of
**[international interests]{.mark}**]{.underline} and promoting
sustainable [Arctic [develop]{.mark}ment]{.underline}. However, this is
juxtaposed against the narrative it promotes for domestic audiences,
which [emphasizes [**competition**]{.mark} for resources]{.underline}
and China's [desire [to become a]{.mark} "polar **[great
power]{.mark}**]{.underline}."^18)^ The Svalbard Treaty has currently
enabled [China to [shroud]{.mark} its [military
activity]{.mark}]{.underline} and influence in the Arctic as scientific
exploration and global cooperation. But it is becoming clear from its
growing partnership with Russia and increasingly aggressive military
action in the Arctic that China's intentions to reshape the
international system extend well beyond the Indo-Pacific. The
[[U.S.]{.mark} and [NATO]{.mark} would be wise to [**recognize** China's
aims]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Arctic.

The [historic ties of Russia and China]{.underline} and their Arctic
ambitions reveal that the Arctic is [likely to be an
**arena**]{.underline} for future [strategic competition]{.underline}.
Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine has temporarily bolstered the West's
position in the Arctic, as previously neutral Finland and Sweden joined
NATO. Finland's accession into NATO not only increased the NATO-Russia
land border by over 650 percent and moved the defense alliance a mere
250 miles from St. Petersburg, but it also [contributed to [**creating**
a divided Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}, where nearly half belongs to NATO
[while]{.underline} the [remaining half is **Russian**
territory]{.underline}.

#### Conflict escalation is [inevitable]{.underline}\-\--strong Alaskan infrastructure [deters]{.underline} attacks and projects [power]{.underline}.

**Forsyth '18** \[Michael; February; Col. US Army, COS Alaskan NORAD;
Military Review, "Why Alaska and the Arctic are Critical to the National
Security of the United States," no. 12\]

[[Alaska's]{.underline}]{.mark} Geostrategic [Importance]{.underline}

"Alaska is [[the **most strategic** place on
**earth**]{.underline}]{.mark}," stated Brig. Gen. Billy Mitchell in
testimony before Congress in 1935.^3^ The reason for this bold statement
is that [Alaska is the **closest** U.S. location to]{.underline} the
center of the [**Northern** Hemisphere]{.underline} (see figure 1). The
state is singularly [closer to many national capitals]{.underline} in
the hemisphere than most points in the lower forty-eight states. This
makes [Alaska the [**perfect** power projection
**platform**]{.mark}]{.underline} for the United States from a [military
standpoint]{.underline}. Further, because Alaska sits astride the
[Bering Strait **chokepoint**]{.underline} and the [Great Circle
Routes]{.underline} between North America and Asia as can be seen in
figure 2, it is [[**critical** to]{.mark} our **economic** and [national
**security**]{.mark}]{.underline}.^4^

The [**air** lanes and **sea** lanes]{.underline} of the [Great Circle
Routes are [**heavily** trafficked]{.mark}]{.underline} by shipping
companies because they [shorten the distance]{.underline} between the
two continents, [saving **time** and **money** for
shippers]{.underline}. Consequently, the city of Anchorage and Alaska
are at the center of existing commercial shipping lanes between East and
West. Anchorage, at roughly the halfway point between the major commerce
centers of North America and Asia, is [an **important** hub for such
international **corporations**]{.underline} as Federal Express and
DHL.^5^ Moreover, many nations such as [[China and Russia]{.mark} are
**routinely** [making use]{.mark}]{.underline} of these routes
[[for]{.mark} their [economic **benefit**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

However, while [Alaska is **critical** to intercontinental
**[shipping]{.mark}**]{.underline} now, [emerging routes]{.underline}
due to [**shrinking** ice impediments could [raise]{.mark}]{.underline}
the state's [economic stature [to]{.mark} even [**greater**
heights]{.mark}]{.underline}. The retreat of ice coverage in the Arctic
Ocean has [opened up]{.underline} the [potential for **shipping**
[along]{.mark} the **[N]{.mark}**orthern **[S]{.mark}**ea
**[R]{.mark}**oute]{.underline} and the [**fabled** Northwest
Passage]{.underline} (see figure 3).^6^ The Northern Sea Route
[[parallels Russia's]{.mark} Arctic [coastline]{.mark}]{.underline}, as
much of it is within the country's exclusive economic zone. In the past
few years, shipping along this route has increased, topping out with
seventy-one passages in 2013.^7^ [Moving goods along [this route cuts
off **thousands** of miles]{.mark}]{.underline}, saving money on [fuel
costs and insurance]{.underline} (since there are no pirates along this
route).^8^ Moreover, Russia is facilitating passages through the use of
its large icebreaker fleet, making her an [**indispensable** player in
shipping]{.underline} through the High North while profiting from such
transit by charging fees for services akin to a toll.^9^

Thus, the emerging [Northwest Passage has recently become a possibility
for shippers]{.underline}. For centuries, explorers and adventurers
sought a route from Europe to Asia across Canada's High North. Most of
these individuals failed in this attempt, but now the dream is nearing
reality. In 2017, the luxury cruise liner *Crystal Serenity* made a trip
through the Northwest Passage starting from Seward, Alaska, and
terminating in New York City.^10^ While much of the
[**[N]{.mark}**orthwest **[P]{.mark}**assage remains difficult to
navigate]{.underline} due to remaining heavy ice pack, continued [ice
**retreat** could make this route **[feasible]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
the future. Alaska's position on the east side of the Bering Strait
places the state in a central position on the choke point of both
routes. However, with [increasing human activity]{.underline}, it is
[**[inevitable]{.mark}** that [disagreements]{.mark}]{.underline} among
nations making [claims in the area will arise as [competition **heats
up**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Again, [[Alaska]{.mark}'s
location]{.underline} thrusts her to the forefront of strategic
calculations that [the United States must]{.underline} make to [[deal
with]{.mark} emerging **[geopolitical]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
geoeconomic [[circumstances]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Incidentally, what makes the Great Circle Route good for shipping also
makes it the [**preferred** [route for]{.mark}]{.underline} the
employment of [**[missiles]{.mark}** aimed at North
America]{.underline}. As previously noted, this route shortens the
distance between the two continents. Just as shippers prefer the route
because the reduced distance saves time and money, the [same principle
of distance holds true]{.underline} for ballistic missiles. [Potential
**[adversaries]{.mark}** could [fire]{.mark} weapons]{.underline} along
this trajectory to close the distance more quickly while
[[lessening]{.mark} the potential for **[early
warning]{.mark}**]{.underline} to their attacks. Thus,
[[Alaska]{.mark}'s location]{.underline} makes the state a
[**[critical]{.mark}** [component of]{.mark}]{.underline} the nation's
[ballistic [missile defense system]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### It's [critical]{.underline} to Alaskan airpower\-\--which underpins power projection in the [Arctic]{.underline} AND [Indo-Pacific]{.underline}.

As I went for a run yesterday, that\'s 100 degrees colder than it was
for my run yesterday just to put that in perspective. Could you imagine
if it was 100 degrees hotter? [[When you look at **energy**]{.mark}
and]{.underline} the [**ability to sustain** the fight]{.underline}.
When you [[talk about]{.mark} the [mission of]{.mark}]{.underline} the
354th Fighter [[Wing]{.underline}]{.mark}, uniquely [[postured between
North]{.mark}ern Command [and Indo-Pacific]{.mark}]{.underline}
Command[, [we have a **no-fail** mission]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[Whether that\'s putting fighters airborne to protect]{.underline} the
[Alaskan A]{.underline}ir [D]{.underline}efense
[I]{.underline}dentification [Z]{.underline}one, accomplishing our
number one priority for the DOD of homeland defense [or **projecting
power** into]{.underline} the [Pacific, it\'s no fail]{.underline} with
our F-35s. Something that we demonstrated last July when we launched
four F35s direct into the CAP, off the first island chain. Executed a
30-minute vulnerability period and then landed into Kadena.

[That\'s the [ability to **project power**, in Eielson closer
than]{.mark}]{.underline} where they sit in [[Hawaii]{.mark}, to the
fight]{.underline}, to the first island chain, [[to]{.mark} the
[Korea]{.mark}n Peninsula, so]{.underline} extremely important
[it\'s]{.underline} a [[no-fail]{.underline}]{.mark} mission. We can\'t
just survive when it\'s -50, we have to thrive. [[What we do
with]{.mark} that [now is]{.mark}]{.underline} the central heating and
power plant. Think of [a **[1950s]{.mark}** era **[coal]{.mark}-fired
power [plant]{.mark}**]{.underline}. One of the great things is I get a
locomotive to basically haul around coal.

But this is such a [**[critical]{.mark}** piece to]{.underline} our
[[infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}. We just [recently put
in]{.underline} a \$600 million campus for [the F-35]{.underline}, the
ability to operate that aircraft [in the Arctic]{.underline}. You think
about [the [ability for]{.mark} that [mission to

**[reliable]{.mark}** heat and]{.underline} reliable
**[[electricity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. We have a great team of
professionals that sustain and maintain that capability.

But as you mentioned, we did have an [**[outage]{.mark}** for a certain
period in]{.underline} time, and luckily for us it was in October.
Though the temperatures were more mild, but you can imagine when you\'re
seeing -40, how quickly that [[can **affect an installation**]{.mark}.
One of the advantages]{.underline} that [we\'re [looking]{.mark} to, is
[to **increase** our **resiliency**]{.mark}]{.underline} at Eielson Air

The Geopolitical Imperative: Why [the **Military** Needs]{.underline}
**[Nuclear]{.underline}**

[The Arctic is a]{.underline} **[frontline]{.underline}**
[of]{.underline} 21st-century [**geopolitics**. Permafrost degradation,
extreme weather, and logistical challenges make]{.underline} **[energy
supply]{.underline}** [to remote]{.underline} **[military
bases]{.underline}** [a]{.underline} **[national security]{.underline}**
[priority]{.underline}. Oklo\'s 5 MW microreactor, capable of running
for a decade without refueling and operating off-grid, directly
addresses these risks. [The Air Force\'s **pilot project**]{.underline}
at Eielson---paired with plans for a 75 MW reactor by late
2025---[aligns with a]{.underline} broader [strategy to reduce reliance
on]{.underline} **[fossil fuels]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[vulnerable]{.underline}** [energy]{.underline}
**[grids]{.underline}**.

But this is just the start. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) has
identified microreactors as critical to its goal of achieving net-zero
emissions by 2030 while maintaining readiness. With Russia and China
expanding Arctic military presence, U.S. **[bases]{.underline}** [must
be]{.underline} **[energy-independent]{.underline}** [in one of
the]{.underline} **[harshest environments]{.underline}** on Earth.

#### SMRs are key to military bases.

**[S]{.underline}**mall **[M]{.underline}**odular
**[R]{.underline}**eactor**[s]{.underline}** [are]{.underline} a new
generation of nuclear power plants designed to be [**smaller**, more
**flexible**, and **easier** to deploy]{.underline} than traditional
reactors. Typically generating up to 300 megawatts of
electricity---compared to over 1,000 megawatts for conventional
plants---[SMRs can be built]{.underline} in factories [and]{.underline}
**[shipped]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[remote
locations]{.underline}**. [This]{.underline}
**[modularity]{.underline}** [makes them]{.underline}
**[ideal]{.underline}** [for]{.underline} areas like [the]{.underline}
**[Arctic]{.underline}**, [where large-scale infrastructure is
**impractical**]{.underline} due to isolation, extreme weather, and
logistical constraints.

In the Arctic, **[energy reliability]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}
[**critical**. Military]{.underline} **[bases]{.underline}**
[need]{.underline} **[uninterrupted]{.underline}** [power for
operations]{.underline}, while towns require electricity and heat to
sustain life in subzero temperatures. [Renewable sources
like]{.underline} **[wind]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[solar]{.underline}** [are]{.underline} **[inconsistent]{.underline}**
[in this environment, and]{.underline} **[diesel]{.underline}**
[generators]{.underline}, though widely used, [are]{.underline}
**[expensive]{.underline}** [and emit significant]{.underline}
[**g**reen**h**ouse **g**ases]{.underline}. [SMRs]{.underline}, with
their ability to provide steady, low-carbon energy, [could transform
the]{.underline} region's **[energy landscape]{.underline}**.

Canada's Energy Challenge in the Arctic

The Canadian [Arctic]{.underline} spans vast, sparsely populated
[territories]{.underline}, including Nunavut, the Northwest Territories,
and parts of Yukon. Many of its communities, often Indigenous, [rely on
diesel generators flown or shipped in at]{.underline} **[great
expense]{.underline}**. For example, a town like Iqaluit, with a
population of about 8,000, spends millions annually on fuel, and power
**[outages]{.underline}** [are]{.underline} [common during
storms]{.underline}. **[Military bases]{.underline}** like CFS Alert,
located on Ellesmere Island near the North Pole, [face]{.underline}
similar [issues]{.underline}, **[compounded]{.underline}** [by
their]{.underline} **[strategic importance]{.underline}** [in
monitoring]{.underline} **[Arctic sovereignty]{.underline}**.

[Diesel dependency is not just a]{.underline} [**financial
burden**---it's an environmental one. Transporting fuel
emits]{.underline} **[carbon]{.underline}** dioxide, [and]{.underline}
burning it [releases]{.underline} **[pollutants]{.underline}** [that
harm the]{.underline} **[fragile]{.underline}** [Arctic]{.underline}
**[ecosystem]{.underline}**. As Canada aims for net-zero emissions by
2050, replacing diesel with cleaner alternatives is a priority. [SMRs
could]{.underline} meet this need by [deliver]{.underline}ing
**[consistent]{.underline}** [power]{.underline} and heat,
[reducing]{.underline} both **[costs]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[emissions]{.underline}**.

Canada's Push for SMRs

Canada has a strong foundation in nuclear technology, with over six
decades of experience through its CANDU reactors. Building on this
expertise, the government launched the SMR Roadmap in 2018, followed by
the SMR Action Plan in 2020. These initiatives involve collaboration
with industry, utilities, and Indigenous groups to explore SMR
deployment. The goal is twofold: decarbonize remote regions and spur
economic growth.

The Arctic is a key focus. Natural Resources Canada sees SMRs as a way
to power northern communities and support industries like mining, which
is vital for extracting minerals such as rare earth elements. For
instance, [a single]{.underline} **[SMR]{.underline}** [could
supply]{.underline} **[electricity]{.underline}** and district heating
to a town of several thousand, **[slashing]{.underline}** energy
**[costs]{.underline}** [and improving **reliability**]{.underline}.
[Military bases could]{.underline} also [benefit, gaining
energy]{.underline} **[independence]{.underline}** [and
reducing]{.underline} **[vulnerability]{.underline}** [to
**fuel**]{.underline} [supply **disruptions**]{.underline}.

#### Arctic military bases are limited by fuel availability challenges and costs.

Indeed, [infrastructural]{.underline} **[challenges]{.underline}** will
[hamper any effort to sustain]{.underline} **[military
operations]{.underline}**. There are only a few permanent military bases
in the Arctic, and **[resupply]{.underline}** [options are]{.underline}
**[scarce]{.underline}**. Unlike in other military theaters, [Arctic
forces must operate with a high degree of]{.underline}
[**self-sufficiency**, relying on prepositioned]{.underline}
**[supplies]{.underline}** [and strategic]{.underline}
**[airlifts]{.underline}** [to maintain]{.underline}
**[readiness]{.underline}**. Overland [transport is a major]{.underline}
**[challenge]{.underline}** as [ice, snow and a lack of]{.underline}
developed [roads make]{.underline} [movement difficult]{.underline} and
slow. The region's remote nature also affects communication networks,
which will require an increased dependence on satellite-based systems
and high-frequency radio for secure and effective military coordination.
Yet even these are problematic because of the poor conductivity of
frozen ground and the magnetic and solar phenomena in the region. Then
there is the issue of cybersecurity. Arctic-based networks are
vulnerable to attack and have limited access for timely repair and
support. All [this makes the region extremely]{.underline}
**[expensive]{.underline}** [to operate in]{.underline}.
[Transporting]{.underline} **[fuel]{.underline}**, food and supplies [to
Arctic bases requires **extensive**]{.underline} [logistical
**planning** and financial]{.underline} **[investment]{.underline}**.
[Nations]{.underline} with Arctic interests will [have to weigh the
economic feasibility of]{.underline} long-term **[military
presence]{.underline}** in the region, [balancing]{.underline}
**[national security]{.underline}** priorities [with]{.underline} the
**[financial costs]{.underline}** [of Arctic deployment]{.underline}.

Logistics and Remoteness:

[The Arctic is]{.underline} **[vast]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
[**sparse**ly populated, making]{.underline} regional travel,
[**transportation** and]{.underline} **[logistics]{.underline}**
[challenging. The **remote**]{.underline} [location and]{.underline}
**[lack]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} **[infrastructure]{.underline}**
[mean]{.underline} that [accessing the area can be]{.underline}
**[expensive]{.underline}** [and logistically]{.underline}
**[complex]{.underline}**. [Limited transportation options]{.underline}
can [hinder]{.underline} the timely [delivery]{.underline} of supplies
and equipment. [Keeping a]{.underline} **[military base]{.underline}**
fully [stocked with]{.underline} **[fuel]{.underline}** and other
necessary supplies [is a]{.underline} **[complex]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[arduous]{.underline}** [task]{.underline} adding to
the existing support requirements of existing civilian communities. The
isolation, weather and darkness pose additional potential for strain on
mental health. Regional military bases should operate under
arctic-theatre specific guidelines that address the unique challenges of
living and defending the great northern expanses of Canada.
Historically, the Canadian Northwest Passage has been more navigable
than the Russian Northern Sea Route, which runs along the Russian Arctic
coast, due to harsher ice conditions and less developed infrastructure.
However, the status quo is changing with the Russian northern passage
now more open as the climate warms and Russia invests in its Arctic
infrastructure.

Limited Resources and Environmental Sensitivity:

The Arctic, like everywhere on Earth, has a finite amount resources, and
establishing [a permanent]{.underline} **[base]{.underline}** [requires
careful planning for]{.underline} the **[sustainable]{.underline}** [use
of]{.underline} available [resources]{.underline}. Classified as a
desert due to its lack of precipitation, a consistent water supply is
key to any project in the Far North. Additionally, **[energy
sources]{.underline}** and waste management [must be considered to
ensure any base is **viable**]{.underline} [long-term]{.underline}
**[without]{.underline}** [negatively impacting the
**fragile**]{.underline} [Arctic]{.underline}
**[ecosystem]{.underline}**.

Science from the University of Western Ontario; Security Distillery,

https://thesecuritydistillery.org/all-articles/the-meltdown-nuclear-relations-in-the-arctic\]

[Nuclear **[multipolarity]{.mark}** in the Arctic [is unstable]{.mark}
because it no longer falls within the traditional **[game theory]{.mark}
matrix**]{.underline}, and [there is an [increased risk of **nuclear
action** due to]{.mark} a larger [number of]{.mark} nuclear [actors
and]{.mark} significant **regional [tension]{.mark}**]{.underline}
\[22\]. [**[Preemptive]{.mark} nuclear [strikes]{.mark}** [are more
prevalent]{.mark}]{.underline} in multipolar nuclear politics [[due
to]{.mark} a greater **[perception]{.mark} of threat** from other
actors]{.underline} \[23\]. Though China promotes itself as a No First
Use (NFU) state, meaning that it will not strike unless struck upon in a
nuclear capacity, [Russia has threatened to strike first]{.underline},
[and America's position on **NFU** is vague]{.underline} \[24\]. NATO is
a nuclear deterrent organisation in the Arctic region, only Sweden is
not yet a full NATO member and Finland has just recently gained NATO
membership \[25\]. In multipolar deterrence, [regional
[conflicts]{.mark} are more [likely to escalate into **total**]{.mark}
**nuclear [warfare]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and de-escalation relies on
political bargaining as opposed to rationality modelling. Thus, it is
unclear how political bargaining will take place in an increasingly
polarised Arctic \[26\].

Though the U.S., China, and Russia have all acceded to or ratified the
Treaty of the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NNPT), both Russia
and the U.S. have backed out of data-sharing obligations under the New
START treaty \[27\]. [This **breakdown in communication** between Arctic
actors]{.underline} due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and Russia's
recent threat to use nuclear weapons against the U.S. [indicates that
[future]{.mark} regional [disputes]{.mark} over Arctic
**resources**]{.underline}, **[navigation]{.underline}**, [and
**territory** may [give rise to nuclear crises]{.mark}]{.underline}
\[28\].

CONCLUSION

[[Climate change]{.mark} in the **Arctic**]{.underline} has rendered the
region more accessible to its actors; this [has [inflamed
tensions]{.mark} between the **NATO** bloc and **Russia**]{.underline}
over territorial disputes and Russia's war in Ukraine and between China
and Russia due to diverging economic development goals \[29\]. As
temperatures warm, [the [region]{.mark} may [become a **nuclear
flashpoint**]{.mark} that cannot be analysed using classic deterrent
models]{.underline} \[30\].

#### SCENARIO 2\-\--AIRPOWER:

#### The arctic is critical for global air power projection and military readiness. 

**Wilson '19** \[Heather and Gen. David Goldfein; January 9; Secretary
of the U.S. Air Force; U.S. Airforce Chief of staff; Defense News, "Air
power and the Arctic: The importance of projecting strength in the
north,"
https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2019/01/09/air-power-and-the-arctic-the-importance-of-projecting-strength-in-the-north/\]

Almost a decade before the Japanese invaded the Aleutian Islands, Gen.
Billy Mitchell advocated building airfields, telling Congress: "[Whoever
holds]{.underline} **[Alaska]{.underline}** [will hold the]{.underline}
**[world]{.underline}**." Even then, the Arctic was strategically
important, and Mitchell's words **[underscored]{.underline}** the [role
of]{.underline} **[air power]{.underline}** [in the region]{.underline},
[where minimal]{.underline} **[infrastructure]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[extreme climate]{.underline}** severely
**[limit]{.underline}** [how militaries can operate]{.underline}.

Fast forward 75 years, and [the Arctic has become even]{.underline}
**[more]{.underline}** [important]{.underline} to the nation. [Both
a]{.underline} **[northern approach]{.underline}** [to the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, [as well as
a]{.underline} **[critical location]{.underline}** [for
**projecting**]{.underline} [American]{.underline} [**power**, its
geo-strategic significance is **difficult** to]{.underline}
**[overstate]{.underline}**. [Key]{.underline} **[defense
assets]{.underline}** [dot the landscape. The]{.underline} **[Air
Force]{.underline}** [operates most of our]{.underline} **[Arctic
locations]{.underline}** --- [from]{.underline}
**[fighter]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[tanker
bases]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[space-tracking]{.underline}**
[systems and]{.underline} **[radar]{.underline}** [sites that
detect]{.underline} **[aircraft]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[missiles]{.underline}** [coming over the poles]{.underline}.

One way to view the region's growing importance: By 2022, [Alaska will
be home to more]{.underline} **[advanced fighter jets]{.underline}**
[than any place on Earth]{.underline}.

At the end of the Cold War, many considered the Arctic to be a secure
border, whose frigid expanse acted as an extra layer of homeland
defense. Today, **[tech]{.underline}**nological
**[advancements]{.underline}** [by]{.underline} potential
**[adversaries]{.underline}** [are making this once forbidding border
increasingly]{.underline} **[porous]{.underline}**.

[The Arctic has]{.underline} **[valuable]{.underline}** natural
**[resources]{.underline}** [including]{.underline}
**[r]{.underline}**are **[e]{.underline}**arth
**[m]{.underline}**etal**[s]{.underline}**, [fish proteins, and up
to]{.underline} [**one-fifth** of the world's]{.underline}
**[oil]{.underline}** and natural **[gas]{.underline}** reserves. The
U.S. is far from alone in seeing the region's value.
**[Russia]{.underline}** [is securing its economic **interests** in the
north]{.underline}, which makes up about 20 percent of its gross
domestic product, [and]{.underline} is **[rebuilding]{.underline}**
[its]{.underline} **[military presence]{.underline}** in the region.
**[China]{.underline}** [considers the Arctic as part of
its]{.underline} **[B]{.underline}**elt and **[R]{.underline}**oad
**[I]{.underline}**nitiative [and]{.underline} is [establishing
a]{.underline} **[presence]{.underline}** [through]{.underline} economic
**[leverage]{.underline}** [with other Arctic nations]{.underline}.

Responding to these changes in June, then-Defense Secretary James Mattis
stated: "[America's got to]{.underline} **[up]{.underline}**
[its]{.underline} **[game]{.underline}** [in the Arctic]{.underline}."
The Air Force is now developing a comprehensive Arctic strategic vision,
ensuring our ability to fulfill the objectives of the new U.S. National
Defense Strategy. [We must be ready to]{.underline}
**[defend]{.underline}** our **[security interests]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[deter aggression]{.underline}** [by]{.underline}
**[major powers]{.underline}**.

The Air Force is exploring ways to modernize our more than 50
**[radars]{.underline}**, many co-managed with Canada, that cross the
top of North America and [form an]{.underline} **[essential
part]{.underline}** [of protecting the U.S. and Canada from]{.underline}
**[missile]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[bomber
attacks]{.underline}**. [Northern bases are key]{.underline} [**staging
locations**, allowing aircraft to]{.underline} **[quickly]{.underline}**
[reach]{.underline} **[any location]{.underline}** in the Northern
Hemisphere. [The Air Force]{.underline} also recently [upgraded
critical]{.underline} **[space-surveillance]{.underline}**
[assets]{.underline} in Thule, Greenland, the northernmost U.S. base in
the world. Meanwhile [we continue to]{.underline}
**[train]{.underline}** [and equip for]{.underline}
**[cold]{.underline}** [weather]{.underline}
**[op]{.underline}**eration**[s]{.underline}**, managing the Defense
Department's oldest polar survival school [and retaining]{.underline}
the **[capacity]{.underline}** [to]{.underline} **[land]{.underline}**
[on]{.underline} **[ice]{.underline}** with unique, ski-equipped
aircraft.

Completing these missions is not without challenges. [The region poses
difficulties with]{.underline} **[extreme cold]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[unpredictable]{.underline}** [weather]{.underline},
short construction seasons, [and]{.underline} extended periods of
**[darkness]{.underline}**, in addition to aurora and space weather
phenomena that inhibit radio and satellite communication.

These demands make the Arctic a region where alliances and partnerships
are all the more vital. In addition to our enduring partnership with
Canada, the Air Force is looking at opportunities to expand
relationships with other Arctic allies --- especially through exercises
--- by sharing weather, communications and reconnaissance data, as well
as trading operational best practices.

The [casualties in the Arctic]{.underline} during World War II
[highlighted]{.underline} the **[perils]{.underline}** [that result from
a]{.underline} **[lack]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}
**[readiness]{.underline}** [for operating in]{.underline} [**extreme
conditions**. Many are calling for increased]{.underline}
**[attention]{.underline}**, including Congress. The 2019 National
Defense Authorization Act requires an updated Defense Department Arctic
Strategy outlining the roles and missions of each military service in
the region. World events and history suggest [it's time to move out
smartly to protect our **vital**]{.underline} [national]{.underline}
**[interests]{.underline}**.

#### SMRs are key to air bases. 

\-\--Not Arctic specific and not very great.

There Be Light,\" Air & Space Forces Magazine, 8-27-2021,

Widespread [power disruption scenarios]{.underline} are
[forcing]{.underline} the [Air and Space Forces to
**re-imagine**]{.underline} critical **[threats]{.underline}**. A [storm
bearing down on]{.underline} an Air [Force]{.underline} base
[brings]{.underline} wind, rain, lightning, and the [possibility of
**rolling blackouts**]{.underline}, but backup generators may not be
enough to keep operations going. Add a cyberattack on the electrical
grid or nearby oil and gas pipelines, and the path to recovery could
take weeks---or longer.

Such nightmare scenarios keep Michael Wu up at night. "A [determined
adversary]{.underline} ... would want to **[time]{.underline}** those
\[**[cyber]{.underline}**\] attacks [when you're already recovering
from]{.underline} what's going to be a more [**tumultuous** and
**different** strategic environment]{.underline}," said Wu, a senior Air
Force adviser for energy resilience under the previous administration

[In such a situation]{.underline}, the [[Air]{.underline}]{.mark} Force
[[and Space Force]{.mark}'s [capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline} would
[[face **severe challenges**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Without power, how
can a digital service operate? [Without electricity, can an advanced
sensor network be as comprehensive as it needs to]{.underline} be?

"If you look at the [core missions the [Air Force]{.mark}]{.underline}
executes, they are [**[absolutely tied to]{.mark}** uninterrupted
[access to **electricity**]{.mark}]{.underline}," said Wu. "[Whether
that's space]{.underline}, whether [that's unmanned
aircraft]{.underline}, whether [that's any of our
i]{.underline}ntelligence, [s]{.underline}urveillance, and
[r]{.underline}econnaissance capabilities---those are
[[missions]{.underline}]{.mark} that are **[[tied
to]{.underline}]{.mark}** uninterrupted [[access \[to
**power**]{.underline}]{.mark}\] ... [[on domestic
installations]{.mark}]{.underline} that are [supporting
operations]{.underline} worldwide."

Several times in the course of the past few years, that access to
uninterrupted power has been challenged, both by increasingly severe
weather and bad actors in cyberspace. Experts are hoping these incidents
will be a wake-up call for the Air Force and the public in general to
make sure their power systems are resilient enough to bounce back from
crises.

ENERGY IN A MODERNIZED AIR FORCE

"[Every]{.underline} Department of [the Air Force mission starts and
ends on an installation]{.underline}," wrote Mark A. Correll, deputy
assistant secretary of the Air Force for environment, safety, and
infrastructure, in May 19 testimony to the Senate Appropriations
subcommittee on military construction. "[Installations are weapon
systems]{.underline}."

As new technologies emerge and the Department of the Air Force
modernizes, more and more missions can---or must be---accomplished or
supported from bases within the U.S., especially for a service like the
Space Force.

"Nowadays, \[with\] intel, data-driven operations, UAVs---the
installations in the United States and the global infrastructure that
supports the forward deployed soldiers and Airmen and the planes and the
infrastructure are actually operational assets, not strategic," said
retired Army Maj. Gen. John G. Ferrari, now a nonresident senior fellow
at the American Enterprise Institute. "They are part of the
warfight---for better or worse."

As part of the warfight, [[installation's]{.mark} strengths and
[**vulnerabilities** are amplified]{.mark}]{.underline}, especially in
the context of a modernizing Air Force. One [[key]{.mark} vulnerability
[is]{.mark}]{.underline} USAF's **[[reliance on
electricity]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

"We are just simply more and more connected as a society," Wu said. "And
those connection points create new alliances and dependencies on
electricity---in particular, communications networks, but on critical
infrastructure generally."

Disrupt any one of those connection points in a particular Air Force
mission, and it "can have cascading impacts on other parts of the
mission that may be miles away," the service's Installation Energy
Strategic Plan, released in January 2021, acknowledged. And the threats
to those connection points are becoming both more frequent and more
potent, experts say.

SEVERE WEATHER

In particular, [severe weather events]{.underline}, which scientists
believe [are becoming more frequent]{.underline} due to climate change,
have [wreaked havoc and caused billions of dollars in
damages]{.underline} as of late. There was the near-total destruction of
Tyndall Air Force Base, Fla., by Hurricane Michael in 2018, the massive
floods at Offutt Air Force Base, Neb., in 2019, and most recently,
Winter Storm Uri in early 2021, which impacted 28 Department of the Air
Force installations across the U.S., including several that experienced
interruptions to power or water service.

[One of the bases affected]{.underline} during the winter storm was
Minot Air Force Base, N.D. In his written testimony to the Senate
Appropriations subcommittee, Correll said that the storm [caused a
portion of the base's missile field to lose power]{.underline} and rely
on backup generators to operate. It's [not the first time]{.underline}
Minot's [nuclear silos have been impacted by
weather]{.underline}---severe flooding in 2011 prevented access to seven
launch facilities.

Such events take money, manpower, and time to recover, and missions can
be affected as equipment is damaged or units must relocate.

The threat of severe weather and climate change is particularly acute in
certain areas, said David R. Haines, Senior Fellow for Climate Security
at the American Security Project.

"Those \[bases\] that are most at risk tend to be those who are out
West, where there is potential damage from wildfires and droughts, and
those that are on the coast, where they can be damaged by rising sea
levels, floods---including sunny day flooding---and, obviously,
hurricanes," Haines said. "Talking about Tyndall, that's probably the
poster child for climate damage---\$3 billion worth of damage."

As required in the fiscal 2020 National Defense Authorization Act
(NDAA), the [Air Force conducted initial assessments]{.underline} of the
threats posed by severe weather and other natural disasters [at more
than 90 installations,]{.underline} said Secretary of the Air Force
spokeswoman Sarah Fiocco. As part of those assessments, the Air Force
categorized the individual risk level from each climate threat to each
base.

"Roughly [10 percent of the hazards identified as risks were categorized
as Extremely High or High,]{.underline} 25 percent as Medium, and the
remainder as Low," Fiocco said.

Those [assessments]{.underline} have [already made an
impact]{.underline}. The Air Force acting [assistant secretary for
energy,]{.underline} installations, and environment, Jennifer L. Miller,
[told]{.underline} a [congressional panel]{.underline} in July that
rebuilding [plans]{.underline} at Offutt and Tyndall have been [adjusted
to account for the threats]{.underline}, and moving forward, each base
will update its master plans with the results of the assessment within a
planned five-year cycle.

CYBER THREATS

[Nature isn't the only threat,]{.underline} however. As the military has
developed the capacity to strike globally from its home bases,
[adversaries and bad actors]{.underline} have [gained the ability to
reachback via the internet]{.underline}.

"We've now spent 70 years building the infrastructure \[in the U.S.\]
under the assumption that nothing can happen to it," said Ferrari, who
served as a branch chief for contingency operations for the Joint Chiefs
of Staff. "And in many ways, our belief in that northern, southern,
eastern, and western moats, if you will, is our Maginot line. It gives
you the illusion of defense, and we haven't realized that really, the
borders, they don't matter anymore."

France's Maginot Line was built as a bulwark against German aggression
after World War I and was expected to be unbreachable. A generation
later, Germans invaded by another route, and France surrendered in days.

When the [[Colonial Pipeline]{.underline}]{.mark} was [shut down
earlier]{.underline} this year by a ransomware attack that [[caused
**fuel shortages**]{.underline}]{.mark} and panic up and down the East
Coast, the [Defense [Department got a glimpse of]{.mark} what that
[risk]{.mark} looks like]{.underline}. While there was no impact on the
military's mission capability at the time, Ferrari said it [showed the
**risk [of an "existential threat]{.mark}**]{.underline}," especially
[when combined with other attacks or crises.]{.underline}

"If somebody's going to the trouble of taking out your electric grid,
and hey, by the way, there's no electricity, and the fuel pumps, the
pipelines don't work, and you can't move fuel, and now you've got
Colonial Pipeline and now you don't have fuel, so how long are your
generators going to last?" Ferrari said. "The outcome becomes
exponentially worse when you're dealing with both of those at the same
time."

'POSSIBLY MONTHS'

In 2016, then-Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James issued Air Force
Policy Directive 90-17, establishing a "framework for energy and water
resources management." James made it Air Force policy that every
installation should be able to "power any infrastructure identified as
critical to the performance of mission essential functions independent
of the utility grid" for at least seven days or until the mission could
be relocated.

Five years later, the office for Energy, Installations, and Environment
released its Installation Energy Strategic Plan, acknowledging that many
of its planning scenarios were based on energy outages lasting one to
seven days.

However, in the context of increasingly severe and potentially long-term
threats, especially ones that can build off one another, experts and
officials are expanding their time frames.

"Folks who are operationally planning in the Air Force and who are aware
of, and really cognizant of, the potential risks and threats that the
Air Force and the rest of our nation face, I think, are thinking on the
weeks and possibly months scale," said Wu, who now runs Converge
Strategies, aimed at promoting energy security with military and
civilian partners. "Because that's real."

Air Force Instruction 10-208 Continuity of Operations (COOP), issued in
2018, establishes guidelines for continuity of operations plans and
requires command-wide COOP programs to consider the possibility of
primary power outages lasting "seven, 30, or greater than 90 days."

[[In]{.mark} the [context of a few hours]{.mark}]{.underline} or days,
[diesel-powered [generators are]{.mark}]{.underline} a
[[viable]{.underline}]{.mark} backup option; but [for long-term outages,
fuel can become scarce]{.underline}.

"Backing up critical facilities with [**diesel** generators]{.underline}
is [[simply **not up to the challenge** in]{.mark} the [long
term]{.mark}]{.underline} of the widespread power disruption scenarios
that we're now considering," Wu said.

Indeed, the service's Installation Energy Strategic Plan does account
for the possibility of more long-term disruptions. Both natural
disasters and cyber attacks are listed as potential causes for outages
that could last for upward of three months. In such scenarios, other
courses of action will have to be employed.

POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS

As part of the fiscal year 2021 National Defense Authorization Act,
Congress required the Secretary of Defense to ensure by fiscal 2030 that
99.9 percent of the energy load required for critical missions on
installations be available.

Within that mandate, though, was no one particular way to accomplish
that goal that the department will have to follow. That's as it should
be, experts agreed.

"It's definitely got to be more tailored," Haines said, "which is, I
believe, why the NDAA put the stipulation in that says you need to make
your own energy on the base, but they didn't say, 'Here's how you have
to make it,' because in different places you're gonna have different
advantages."

As an example, Ferrari cited Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in
Southern California which has harnessed methane gas from a nearby
landfill to install a microgrid that allows the base to operate even
when blackouts strike the area.

Microgrids---small energy systems connected to the larger utility grid
but capable of disconnecting and running on their own when needed---are
a key part of the energy resilience puzzle, many believe. A number of
Air Force installations have already either installed microgrid controls
to their energy systems or have plans to do so.

Another [[potential **solution is**]{.mark}]{.underline} small modular
reactors (**[[SMR]{.underline}]{.mark}**)---[nuclear power plants
reduced in size [to be]{.mark}]{.underline} more [[compact, less
costly]{.underline}]{.mark}, [potentially]{.underline} even
[[portable]{.underline}]{.mark}. President J. Donald Trump issued an
[executive order]{.underline} in the final days of his term directing
the Defense Department [to **[promote SMR r]{.mark}esearch [and
d]{.mark}evelopment** [for national defense]{.mark}]{.underline}, and
Miller told a congressional panel that she has "[great interest" in the
idea.]{.underline}

"We're just getting underway on the pilot program but we're excited to
see what capabilities that provides us for our CONUS installations and
then the potential to have those be mobile for other locations," Miller
said.

#### Arctic Airpower underpins [deterrence]{.underline} AND allied [cooperation]{.underline}.

**Wilson '19** \[Heather and David Golfein; January 9; President of the
University of Texas, Ph.D. in International Relations from Oxford
University; Former Director of the Joint Staff; Defense News, "Air Power
and the Arctic: The Importance of Projecting Strength in the North,"
https://www.defensenews.com/opinion/commentary/2019/01/09/air-power-and-the-arctic-the-importance-of-projecting-strength-in-the-north/\]

[The]{.underline} U.S. [**Air Force**]{.underline} has been [flying over
the **Arctic** for]{.underline} more than [a half century]{.underline}.
Often forgotten, the United States' first-ever mass airlift and aerial
bombing campaigns were conducted there during World War II's
Thousand-Mile War along a remote chain of Alaskan islands.

Almost a decade before the Japanese invaded the Aleutian Islands, Gen.
Billy Mitchell advocated building airfields, telling Congress: "Whoever
holds Alaska will hold the world." Even then, [the Arctic]{.underline}
was [strategically **important**]{.underline}, and Mitchell's words
underscored [the role of air power in the region]{.underline}, where
[[minimal **infrastructure** and]{.mark} extreme
**[climate]{.mark}**]{.underline} severely [[limit]{.mark} how
[militaries]{.mark} can operate]{.underline}.

Fast forward 75 years, and the [[Arctic]{.mark} has become even more
important]{.underline} to the nation. Both a northern approach to the
United States, as well as [a **[critical]{.mark}** location [for
projecting]{.mark}]{.underline} American
**[[power]{.underline}]{.mark}**, its geo-strategic significance is
difficult to overstate. Key defense assets dot the landscape. [[The Air
Force **operates** most]{.underline}]{.mark} of our [[Arctic
**locations**]{.underline}]{.mark} --- [[from
**fighter**]{.underline}]{.mark} and tanker [base**[s]{.mark}** [to
**space**-tracking]{.mark}]{.underline} systems [[and **radar**]{.mark}
site**[s]{.mark}** that detect]{.underline} aircraft and
[missiles]{.underline} coming over the poles.

One way to view the region's growing importance: By 2022,
[[Alaska]{.underline}]{.mark} will be [[home to more advanced
**fighter**]{.mark} jet[**s** than any]{.mark} place [on
**Earth**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

At the end of the Cold War, many considered the Arctic to be a secure
border, whose frigid expanse acted as an extra layer of homeland
defense. Today, technological advancements by potential adversaries are
making this once forbidding border increasingly porous.

Responding to these changes in June, then-Defense Secretary James Mattis
stated: "America's got to up its game in the Arctic." The Air Force is
now developing a comprehensive Arctic strategic vision, ensuring our
ability to fulfill the objectives of the new U.S. National Defense
Strategy. [[We must]{.underline}]{.mark} be ready to
[defend]{.underline} our [**security** interests and [deter
**aggression**]{.mark}]{.underline} by major powers.

The Air Force is exploring ways to modernize our more than 50 radars,
many co-managed with Canada, that cross the top of North America and
form an essential part of protecting the U.S. and Canada from missile
and bomber attacks. Northern bases are key staging locations, allowing
aircraft to quickly reach any location in the Northern Hemisphere. The
Air Force also recently upgraded critical space-surveillance assets in
Thule, Greenland, the northernmost U.S. base in the world. Meanwhile we
continue to train and equip for cold weather operations, managing the
Defense Department's oldest polar survival school and retaining the
capacity to land on ice with unique, ski-equipped aircraft.

Completing these missions is not without challenges. [The region poses
**difficulties** with extreme]{.underline} cold and unpredictable
**[weather]{.underline}**, [short **construction** seasons, and
extended]{.underline} periods of **[darkness]{.underline}**, in addition
to aurora and space weather phenomena [that inhibit]{.underline} radio
and satellite **[communication]{.underline}**.

These demands make the Arctic a region where [**[alliances]{.mark}** and
partnerships [are]{.mark}]{.underline} all the more [**[vital]{.mark}**.
In addition to]{.underline} our enduring partnership with
**[Canada]{.underline}**, the Air Force is looking at opportunities to
[expand relationships with **other** Arctic allie**s**]{.underline} ---
especially through exercises --- by [sharing]{.underline} weather,
communications and reconnaissance [**data**, as well as
trading]{.underline} operational [best **practices**.]{.underline}

The casualties in the Arctic during World War II highlighted the
**[[perils]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [[result from]{.mark} a [lack of
**readiness**]{.mark}]{.underline} for operating in extreme conditions.
Many are calling for increased attention, including Congress. The 2019
National Defense Authorization Act requires an updated Defense
Department Arctic Strategy outlining the roles and missions of each
military service in the region. World events and history suggest it's
time to move out smartly to protect our vital national interests.

#### Air superiority stops [extinction]{.underline}. 

**Birkey '24** \[Douglas; June 13; Executive Director for the Mitchell
Institute for Aerospace Power Studies, Master's in International
Relations from Georgetown University; Air and Space Forces, "Past is
Prologue: Learn from History and Invest in Combat Airpower,"
https://www.airandspaceforces.com/opinion-past-is-prologue-invest-in-combat-airpower/\]

As world leaders gathered at Normandy last week to mark the 80th
anniversary of the D-Day invasion, it is important to recall that
[**America** was **not ready** for]{.underline} that [war]{.underline}.
It took two and a half years to generate the combat power necessary to
invade Europe, plus another year to finally defeat Nazi Germany. Victory
was far from certain during key phases of the conflict.

Today, [[America is]{.mark} once again [inadequately postured to
**confront**]{.mark}]{.underline} burgeoning national [security
[challenges. **China**]{.mark} is building up forces]{.underline}
aggressively [[in]{.mark} the [Pacific; **Russia**]{.mark} is making
gains]{.underline} in its war [[on **Ukraine**]{.mark};
**[Iran]{.mark}** is [pursuing **nuc**]{.mark}]{.underline}lear
ambition**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and proxy wars; **[North
Korea]{.mark}** is [threatening **nuclear war**]{.mark};]{.underline}
and [**[n]{.mark}**on-**[s]{.mark}**tate
**[a]{.mark}**ctor**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} continue to
[**[destabilize]{.mark}** key [regions]{.mark}]{.underline}. However,
post-Cold War budget cuts, two decades of strategic distraction in
Afghanistan and Iraq, and a succession of aggressive budget cuts have
yielded a set of U.S. military capabilities and capacity that fall short
of what the threat environment demands. This is especially true for
[**[Air Force]{.mark}** fighters and bombers]{.underline}---two
[[**foundational** elements of]{.underline}]{.mark} U.S. national
**[[security]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The [ability to achieve **[air superiority]{.mark}**]{.underline} when
and where it is [needed [is an **essential** condition for
any]{.mark}]{.underline} successful [military
[operation]{.mark}]{.underline}, regardless of domain. That is why Air
Force fighters are so important.

Likewise, [a commander's [ability to]{.mark}]{.underline} take the
[[fight]{.underline}]{.mark} to [the enemy [**depends**
on]{.mark}]{.underline} America's [**[long-range]{.mark}** attack
[capability]{.mark}]{.underline}---[which is predominantly]{.underline}
an [**Air** Force]{.underline} bomber mission. [[They **strike**
targets]{.underline}]{.mark} deep behind enemy lines, [[disable
**c**]{.mark}ommand-**[and]{.mark}**-**[c]{.mark}**ontrol]{.underline}
networks, [eliminate **production** centers, [and
damage]{.mark}]{.underline} materiel, logistics, and enemy [**combat**
[forces]{.mark}. Bombers]{.underline}, in addition to submarines and
land-based ICBMs, also [[comprise]{.underline}]{.mark} one leg of
[America's **[nuclear triad]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Combined, [air
superiority]{.underline} and long-range attack [[**deter**
adversaries]{.underline}]{.mark} in times of peace [and yield
war-winning effects]{.underline} during conflict.

[Both air superiority and long-range attack]{.underline} missions [are
**established** military imperatives]{.underline}. In
**[W]{.underline}**orld **[W]{.underline}**ar **[II]{.underline}**,
[allied forces would not have made it past]{.underline} the landing
[beaches]{.underline} had they been under attack from the sky.
Long-range strikes played a crucial role throughout the war, degrading
the German war machine with debilitating attacks against petroleum
refineries, production facilities, rail lines, and more. The reason the
war in Europe ended just eleven months after D-Day was that air power
had already inflicted so much damage over the years, that ground forces
were fighting an already degraded opponent.

[The same was true [in]{.mark}]{.underline} Operation **[[Desert
Storm]{.underline}]{.mark}** in 1991. A monthlong [air
campaign]{.underline} set conditions such that ground forces
[needed]{.underline} just [96 hours]{.underline} to bring Saddam Hussein
to his knees.

Today, [in **[Ukraine]{.mark}**, neither]{.underline} side [controls the
sky,]{.underline} and neither can mount a strategic air attack campaign.
[As a result, fighting is bogged down]{.underline} in modern-day World
War I-style trench warfare. [This is the **price** nations pay if they
cannot control]{.underline} the **[sky]{.underline}** and use that
dominance to project decisive strikes. Surface forces slaughter each
other for incremental daily gains measured in meters.

Following such a course is a recipe for disaster. Yet
[given]{.underline} the [**precarious** state of U.S.
airpower]{.underline} today, [it could be what is **in store** if the
U.S. faces]{.underline} a **[major power]{.underline}**, especially
China, in combat in the future. Lacking major investment today,
commanders will lack the capacity and capability they will need to fight
a peer foe.

The decay began after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, when the
Pentagon cut Air Force combat capacity by half. In continued over the
decades that followed, as fighter and bomber inventories shrank and
nonstop operational demand in the Middle East, the Balkans, and
elsewhere burned out remaining aircraft. At the same time, key fighter
and bomber modernization programs were cut short. America built less
than half the F-22s required, halted B-2 bomber production at 21, slowed
F-35 production, and flew aircraft into their sixth decade and beyond.
Fiscal caps imposed by the 2011 Budget Control Act strained Air Force
fighters and bombers to the core.

Air Force leaders sounded the alarm six years ago, declaring that "The
Air Force is too small for what the nation is asking us to do." Yet
still the cuts continued.

Now, [[with **threats** on the rise]{.underline}]{.mark} around the
globe, [the nation faces a choice: [modernize or
**risk**]{.mark}]{.underline} the nation's future
**[[security]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Said more bluntly, America may lose
its next major war it fights for want of capable, properly sized combat
airpower.

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

To avert this outcome, modernization is essential. This includes: Buying
more F-35 and B-21 aircraft as rapidly as possible Developing and
fielding autonomous, uncrewed Collaborative Combat Aircraft (CCA)
Building the Next Generation Air Dominance (NGAD) family of systems
Investing in modern munitions in volume Fixing the chronic pilot
shortfall Stop shortchanging operations accounts so that personnel are
adequately trained, and mission equipment is sustained at a high level
of readiness. A credible force can deter war, but a hollow force---one
that lacks the capacity to fight a peer adversary---invites risk.
Adversaries know when America is weak and will opportunistically push
against our interests. However, modernization requires resources, and
that funding is in short supply given new budget caps, continued high
inflation, and the sheer scale of modernization necessary to reset
decades of neglect. The factors risk seeing an already a fragile set of
Air Force combat airpower capabilities grow more precarious. The Air
Force reduced its fiscal 2025 procurement budget request by \$1.6
billion versus fiscal 2024, because the resources simply were not
available in the topline dictated by the Pentagon. According to experts,
the defense budget caps amount to a \$47 billion cut to the Department
of Defense in fiscal 2025 versus previously planned toplines. Nor are
things set to improve any time soon. Secretary of the Air Force Frank
Kendall explained: "You're going to see our five-year plan ... and what
you're going to see is that life gets a lot harder as we get past '25."
Given what is at stake, Congress must repeal the budget caps and
prioritize Air Force modernization. The joint force simply is not viable
without what Air Force fighters and bombers bring to the fight. Nor can
these deferred bills be ignored forever. As Senate defense
appropriations subcommittee Chairman Sen. Jon Tester (D-Mont.) knows
well, the cost of postponing necessary investments is always higher:
"Either pay me now or pay me later," he has said. "It's going to cost a
hell of a lot more later." Ranking member of the Senate Armed Services
Committee Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) is calling for higher defense
spending. "Our current defense investment does not meet the moment," he
said, releasing a plan that deserves serious bipartisan attention. "The
emerging Axis of Aggressors is undermining U.S. interests across the
globe." On top of more funding, the Department of Defense also needs to
embrace cost per effect analysis to ensure money received is directed
towards achieving best value. It comes down to investing in systems that
deliver the greatest effect at the lowest cost, thus buying more defense
capability and capacity for each dollar invested.

\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUME\>\>

There is significant room for improvement in this regard. Consider the
long-range strike mission. While deep attack is officially and
traditionally an Air Force mission achieved with bomber and fighter
aircraft[, the Pentagon has funded]{.underline} the [[**Army** and
**Navy**]{.mark} to [develop]{.mark} long-range
[missiles]{.mark}]{.underline} that will cost \$50 million per shot---an
unsustainable figure given that aim points in a major theater war will
likely exceed six figures. Stealthy penetrating [**[fighters]{.mark}**
and bombers [can]{.mark} achieve **greater** effects [at a **fraction**
of]{.mark} that [cost]{.mark}, return]{.underline} to base, [and do it
again]{.underline} the next day.

Nor is this the only example. [Consider]{.underline} the
[**inefficiency** of the **Army** trying to develop its own]{.underline}
organic **[i]{.underline}**ntelligence, **[s]{.underline}**urveillance,
and **[r]{.underline}**econnaissance capability,
[comprising]{.underline} both [aircraft]{.underline} and satellites, [to
guide]{.underline} those high-priced [long-range
**missiles**]{.underline}. The Space Force, meanwhile, is developing
that same capability for the entire joint force.

In his remarks commemorating the D-Day anniversary, President Biden
noted that "There are things that are worth fighting and dying for:
Freedom is worth it; democracy is worth it; America is worth it; the
world is worth it---then, now, and always."

While some might call that sentimental hyperbole, the lessons of the
past tell us otherwise. World War II put existential realities on the
line. [[**China**, **Russia**]{.mark}, and the **rest** of]{.underline}
the [threats we face [pose]{.mark} severe
**[risks]{.mark}**]{.underline} today.

[As we]{.underline} once again [face [these **challenges**]{.mark}, some
of them]{.underline} truly **[[existential]{.underline}]{.mark}**, let
us resolve to rise to the occasion as did our nation nearly a century
ago. [[We must]{.underline}]{.mark} invest now to [**[ensure]{.mark}**
American **[air superiority]{.mark}** and long-range strike
capability]{.underline} are there when we need them.

#### Falling back greenlights Chinese [adventurism]{.underline} in the Indo-Pacific\-\--nuclear war. 

**Harpley '24** \[Unshin; August 9; reporter at Air and Space Forces

and Management at Yale University, and Rebecca Pettyjohn, Adjunct

Studies; Air and Space Forces, "US 'Ill-Equipped' to Handle Nuclear
Escalation with China: Experts,"
https://www.airandspaceforces.com/us-nuclear-escalation-china-experts/\]

[[The U.S. is]{.underline}]{.mark} currently
"[**[ill-equipped]{.mark}**"]{.underline} [[to manage **nuclear
escalation**]{.mark} scenarios]{.underline} in the Indo-Pacific [with
**China**]{.underline}, both in the current security environment and in
a potential conflict, experts argue in a new report.

Andrew Metrick, Philip Sheers, and Stacie Pettyjohn from the Center for
a New American Study authored the research report, funded by the
Pentagon's Defense Threat Reduction Agency.

"The United States is currently ill-equipped in its concepts and
capabilities to manage escalation risks [[in]{.mark} the]{.underline}
emerging **[[Indo-Pacific]{.underline}]{.mark}** era," the authors write
in the report. "Relying on submarines and dual-capable fighters and
bombers for signaling and employment, the U.S. may encounter issues
related to platform vulnerability, signaling visibility, and
conventional warfighting."

**[[Tensions]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the region [[remain
**high**]{.mark}---[China]{.mark} is building up]{.underline} its
[nuclear **arsenal**]{.underline} at a rapid rate [and]{.underline}
continues to claim it [[will take Taiwan by
**force**]{.underline}]{.mark} if necessary.

In the event of conflict, especially a protracted one, Metrick, Sheers,
and Pettyjohn warn that conditions could be such that "nonstrategic
[[nuclear]{.mark} weapons [use is]{.mark}]{.underline} both
**[[appealing]{.underline}]{.mark}** to the PRC [[and **difficult** to
manage]{.underline}]{.mark} for the United States."

So-called tactical nuclear exchanges may not lead to full-scale nuclear
war, with smaller, less devastating nuclear weapons used in precision
strikes rather than widespread destruction. In this scenario, [it [is
**crucial**]{.mark} for]{.underline} the [U.S. t[o
demonstrate]{.mark}]{.underline} a [strong commitment
through]{.underline} something "incredibly visible" by effectively
deploying nuclear assets to maintain
**[[deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the authors argued.

"When we're talking about intra-war deterrence, you need to be willing
and able to use theater non-strategic nuclear arms to show your
adversary that you have skin in the game, to demonstrate credibility,"
Metrick said during an Aug. 8 event. "What [[that]{.underline}]{.mark}
probably [[looks like]{.underline}]{.mark} is working with [[the **Air
Force**]{.underline}]{.mark} and others, to think about how you [put the
right [**platforms** with]{.mark}]{.underline} the [right
**[capabilities]{.mark}** in]{.underline} the [right
places.]{.underline}"

The Pentagon has made several moves aimed at signaling deterrence in the
Indo-Pacific this year. It is [[rotating]{.underline}]{.mark} advanced
[fighter [**aircraft** to bases]{.mark}]{.underline} in Japan [and
adjusting its force **posture**]{.underline}, temporarily [relocating
**[F-16s]{.mark}**]{.underline} closer to North Korea, and boosting
cooperation with nations like the Philippines and Australia. [The
U.S.]{.underline} also often [deploys [bomber
**aircraft**]{.mark}]{.underline} and nuclear-powered submarines
[for]{.underline} joint [multilateral exercises]{.underline} with
regional allies. While calling these efforts "important," Anderson said
[**more** is needed to effectively convey]{.underline} nuclear
**[deterrence]{.underline}** messages.

"You see [the **bomber**]{.underline} sometimes [accompanied
by]{.underline} allied [fighter **aircraft**]{.underline}, and that
[[sends a]{.underline}]{.mark} really [[strong]{.underline}]{.mark} and
useful **[[signal]{.underline}]{.mark}**," said Anderson. "But beyond
capabilities, I would just also note ... the importance of mechanisms
like the MO link---the Moscow-Washington hotline, something that we
don't have an exact equivalent of with the Chinese."

#### Absent air dominance, China will [invade Taiwan]{.underline}\-\--[nuclear war]{.underline}.

of Denial: Why Deterring China Requires New Airpower Thinking,"
https://warontherocks.com/2023/04/in-defense-of-denial-why-deterring-china-requires-new-airpower-thinking/\]

Dowding employed an airpower strategy known today as **[[air
denial]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in which a military force [aims to deny
**operational freedom**]{.underline} to an adversary's air force without
necessarily being able to control that airspace. [Applying this
**asymmetric strategy**]{.underline} today [[could]{.mark} succeed in
**[deter]{.mark}**ring a **Chinese [invasion]{.mark}** [of
**Taiwan**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Air denial is not a new strategy, but neither is an alternative based on
air superiority and penetrating strikes. It is a way to use the U.S. Air
Force and surface-based air defenses to increase Chinese Communist Party
perceptions of the uncertainty and risks inherent in an invasion without
potentially provoking nuclear escalation. This approach is controversial
to many in the Air Force because this strategy upends decades of Air
Force doctrine. But that doctrine was based on using aviation
offensively, which may be unwise in a Taiwan scenario.

In War on the Rocks, Caitlin Lee recently presented an updated version
of the Gulf War paradigm for deterring a Chinese invasion of Taiwan ---
and argued against our preferred strategy of air denial. She argued that
in a future conflict next-generation combat drones should operate inside
the range of China's air defense missiles to "sense and detect invasion
forces and kill targets of opportunities" so crewed assets can "deliver
firepower at volume." She rejects air denial as a viable alternative
approach for air combat. She called this approach "unproven" and
fundamentally flawed.

The future of U.S. Air Force strategy is a debate worth having,
particularly given the high stakes. While Lee is correct to call on the
Air Force to field a better mix of crewed and uncrewed systems, we
nonetheless remain unconvinced by her objections to making air denial a
core mission. Instead of trying to symmetrically match (or even
overmatch) China, [**air [denial]{.mark}** [pits]{.mark} **U.S.
[strength]{.mark}**]{.underline}, that it is on the strategic defensive,
[[against China's]{.mark} main [**weakness**, that it has to go
on]{.mark} the **[offense]{.mark}** to **seize Taiwan**]{.underline}.

Deterrence by Denial Versus Air Denial

The policy debate about conventional deterrence in the Indo-Pacific
employs two distinct usages of the term "denial" --- "deterrence by
denial" and strategies of "denial." The former term originated in the
nuclear deterrence literature to distinguish between "deterrence by
punishment" and "deterrence by denial." Deterrence by punishment
threatens to impose unacceptable costs if an attack occurs. Deterrence
by denial relies on convincing an adversary that an attack is
"infeasible or unlikely to succeed."

The 2022 National Defense Strategy stresses deterrence by denial,
calling on the Department of Defense to "develop **[[asymmetric
approaches]{.underline}]{.mark}** and optimize our posture for denial"
in order "to **[[deter aggression]{.underline}]{.mark}**, especially
[where]{.underline} potential [adversaries could act to rapidly **seize
territory**]{.underline}." The debate in the Air Force is how to begin
to implement this approach. There are two schools of thought. The first
views **[[air dominance]{.underline}]{.mark}** and the ability to defeat
China's air force [as a [**necessary condition** for
**deterrence**]{.mark}]{.underline}. "[[Unless]{.mark} the]{.underline}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates and
its allies [[can]{.mark} achieve]{.underline} the [strength]{.underline}
necessary [to [defeat]{.mark}]{.underline} both
**[[Chinese]{.underline}]{.mark}** aggression in Asia [[and **Russian
aggression**]{.underline}]{.mark} in Europe [in]{.underline} near
[simultaneous time frames]{.underline}," Lt. Gen. David Deptula (ret.)
argues, "[[we cannot]{.mark} hope to **[deter]{.mark}** our
**rivals**.]{.underline}"

To deter China, some analysts argue, the United States needs to credibly
threaten to sink China's invasion fleet inside the first island chain
"within 72 hours." Doing so would require the Air Force to "not just
gain air superiority," as David Ochmanek argues, "but to actually reach
into this contested battlespace ... and find the enemy and engage" its
forces. To attain this type of air superiority, U.S. forces would have
to attack China's formidable integrated air defense systems, including
key targets on the mainland such as air bases, radar sites, air
defenses, and possibly command-and-control facilities.

This approach confuses deterrence by denial with the ability to
completely and quickly defeat an adversary. It assumes threatening
military defeat is the only way to deter an adversary, rather than a way
--- and not necessarily the best way --- to posture the Air Force for
deterrence by denial. Moreover, it is anything but an "asymmetric
approach" against a peer or near-peer competitor, given it seeks to
directly combat China's strengths rather than attack its
power-projection weaknesses.

The strategy of **[[air denial]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in contrast,
would [focus on [**limiting** China's]{.mark} ability to
gain]{.underline} and exploit **[[air superiority]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[in offensive military operations]{.underline}. [Air denial]{.underline}
draws upon the British naval theorist Julian Corbett's distinction
between military strategies of control, aimed at securing freedom of
action within a military domain, and strategies of denial, which seek to
[prevent an adversary from gaining]{.underline} such
[control]{.underline}. Chinese military writings consistently make the
point that offensive amphibious and maritime operations are unlikely to
succeed without air superiority --- a supposition supported by the fact
that modern [**[amphibious
op]{.mark}**eration**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} have [[succeeded only
**14 percent** of]{.mark} the [time **without** air superiority]{.mark}.
It would]{.underline} thus [be prudent to try and create **doubt**
in]{.underline} Chinese leader [Xi]{.underline} Jinping['s]{.underline}
mind about China's ability to attain air superiority in such a
contingency.

An air denial strategy economizes force by employing sufficiently large
numbers of smaller, cheaper weapons in a distributed way. The air
defender aims to survive the initial enemy air and missiles strikes and
then keep the airspace contested. A doctrine of "volumetric defense"
underwrites air denial. This concept employs defense in depth --- both
laterally (planar distance, or range) and vertically (altitude) ---
which forces an air attacker to penetrate into what Air Combat Command's
Gen. Mark Kelly described as "layer upon layer upon layer" of air
defense systems. The U.S. Navy employs a similar "layered air defense"
approach to protect its carrier battle groups, effectively creating a
bubble of denial around the carrier through the employment of weapons at
different ranges and altitudes.

While combatants have posed high- and low-altitude air threats in past
wars, the difference today is that the combination of technological
advancements and declining costs is increasing the mobility, range,
density, and expendability of modern air defense systems. This opens new
and more effective ways for the defender to contest both the lateral and
vertical airspace. Volumetric defense consists of a mix of different
cyber effects, sensors, platforms with air-to-air missiles, and
surface-mobile long- and medium-range surface-to-air missiles. These
systems defend the approaches from the "blue skies," where high-end
fighters and bombers typically operate. To avoid these dangers,
adversary aircraft could try to fly low to evade radar detection.
However, this tactic will send them directly into a thick inner layer of
air defenses, protected by thousands of anti-aircraft guns, missiles,
drones, and rockets.

Each of these layers is mutually supportive but not entirely dependent
on the others, making it much harder for an attacker to defeat
volumetric defense. To gain air superiority, China's military would need
to defeat every layer of the defense, covering both different ranges and
altitudes. As long as the United States and its allies maintain an air
defense "force in being," however, the airspace would remain contested
above China's invading forces. This threat bolsters deterrence by
denial.

In her piece, Lee suggests that an air denial strategy would rest mainly
on the use of "large numbers of small, short-range, inexpensive
\[commercial\] drones" and warns, "the outcome of America's next war
won't be decided by quadcopter dogfights." This is not what we argued in
War on the Rocks or elsewhere. We maintain that surface-based air
defenses constitute the foundation of an effective air denial strategy,
even though other services currently have primary responsibility for air
defense and the ownership of systems like the Patriot and Terminal High
Altitude Area Defense. Given the centrality of air defense and denial to
the future of air control, the Department of Defense should reconsider
existing service roles and missions. It should also move to develop and
field smaller and more mobile systems with shorter redeployment times
--- equivalent to their Russian and Chinese counterparts --- in order to
make them harder to find and kill. At the same time, swarms of
lower-cost drones might open additional possibilities for air defense.
Like barrage balloons in World War I and II, swarms of drones could be
used to "mine" the low-altitude airspace as a point defense measure or
as a means of channeling attacking aircraft into narrow flight
corridors, forcing them to run a gauntlet of surface-to-air missiles and
other air denial weapons.

Contests for air control are growing both more complex and challenging
than in the past, when the outcome of air-to-air battles turned mainly
on the high-end fight occurring in the blue skies between attacking
formations and defending fighters. This was the case in the 1940 Battle
of Britain or between attacking aircraft and surface-to-air missiles in
most conflicts since the Yom Kippur war in 1973. Instead, to gain air
superiority against today's air defenses, an attacker has to defeat
every layer of air defense, covering both different ranges and
altitudes. The United States and its allies ought to exploit the
defender's advantage.

Air Denial Is a Proven Strategy

The [**Air Force** faces]{.underline} the [challenge of devising a
strategy [to **deter**]{.mark} Chinese]{.underline} [**military
[aggression]{.mark}** [under]{.mark} the **[nuc]{.mark}**lear
[**shadow**.]{.mark} War with China over [Taiwan]{.mark} could [**lead**
to]{.mark}]{.underline} a [**[nuc]{.mark}**lear
**[exchange]{.mark}**]{.underline}, particularly if Washington strikes
targets on mainland China, prompting China to retaliate in kind. [U.S.
**[airpower]{.mark}**]{.underline} strategy therefore [[needs
to]{.underline}]{.mark} effectively [**[deter]{.mark}** a Chinese attack
**[without]{.mark}**]{.underline} committing the United States to
mainland strikes and [[risking]{.underline}]{.mark} a [**dangerous
[escalation]{.mark}** at the outset of a **conflict**]{.underline}.
Whereas air denial meets both criteria for deterrence success, a
strategy oriented around offensive air superiority and large-scale,
deep-penetration strikes both lacks credibility and increases escalation
risks.

\<\<\<RELEVANT FOR ADVANTAGE 1\>\>\>

[To address]{.underline} the existential **[challenge of
climate]{.underline}** change [and reduce]{.underline} carbon dioxide
[emissions]{.underline}, the [U.S. military should build and
**operate**]{.underline} modular nuclear [**reactors** to power
its]{.underline} domestic [bases]{.underline}. Along with reducing its
impact on climate change, this would also [prepare]{.underline} the
[military services to operate **forward-deployed** nuclear
**reactors**]{.underline} in support of combat operations.

Although addressing climate change and reducing the emission of
greenhouse gases is a multifaceted challenge, one of the most critical
aspects is producing electrical power without releasing carbon dioxide.
Electric power production was the source of 25% of greenhouse gas
emissions in the United States in 2020. There is a growing push for
using renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. However,
without significant technological leaps, these do not offer a realistic
path to greenhouse gas-free electricity at the scale needed.\
\<\<\<RELEVANT FOR ADVANTAGE 2\>\>\>

Nuclear power is a well-proven technology that offers carbon
dioxide-free electricity. One of the [[main
**objections**]{.underline}]{.mark} to the expansion of nuclear power in
the U.S. is based on the perception that it [is
**[danger]{.mark}**]{.underline}ous. This is primarily based on the
historical cases of Three Mile Island and Chernobyl. [[In
reality]{.mark},]{.underline} there have been [[very **few
safety**]{.mark} **[issues]{.mark}** with nuclear power]{.underline}
since it first came into use in the 1950s.

Some countries have embraced nuclear power, such as France, which
produces 70% of its electricity from nuclear power. The new [[modular
reactors]{.underline}]{.mark} are [[even **safer**]{.mark} than existing
reactors]{.underline} and, according to some experts, **[[do not pose
any threat]{.underline}]{.mark}** of a meltdown. For example, Bill Gates
wrote about the TerraPower reactor design that
"[[accidents]{.underline}]{.mark} would literally be [[**prevented by**
the laws of **physics**]{.underline}]{.mark}."

The U.S. military has a long history of using nuclear energy. It is well
known that the Navy operates nuclear-powered ships and submarines, but
the Army also had a nuclear power program from 1954 to 1976. This
program operated small nuclear reactors both domestically and at
deployed locations. So there is a strong historical foundation of safe
operations of nuclear power reactors to build upon.

In addition, there are existing nuclear power programs that could be
expanded. In 2022, the Pentagon announced that it was designing and
building a mini-nuclear reactor under Project Pele. The [Air
Force]{.underline} also announced that it [plans to operate]{.underline}
a [modular reactor at Eielson Air Force Base]{.underline} in Alaska,
with "demonstration and operational testing" expected to start in 2027.
These [projects]{.underline} are both good starts but are [focused on
microreactors at very remote or overseas locations]{.underline}. These
programs should be expanded to include larger modular reactors housed on
bases throughout the continental United States.

Along with reducing the department's carbon footprint,
[[modular]{.underline}]{.mark} nuclear [[reactors]{.underline}]{.mark}
could [[increase]{.mark} the military's **[combat
capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This has been recognized by the
Pentagon and is one of the driving factors behind Project Pele. The
[ability to operate and deploy nuclear reactors]{.underline} could be
[[vital in]{.mark} [supporting operations]{.mark}]{.underline} during a
high-end global conflict. The [[military]{.underline}]{.mark} is
[[becoming more **reliant**]{.mark} **on**]{.underline} electrical
**[[power]{.underline}]{.mark}** as we develop systems such as
directed-energy weapons and electric-powered combat vehicles. The U.S.
military has had relatively uncontested logistics access during all of
its conflicts since World War II due to air and sea power superiority,
which has given us the ability to control vital lines of communication.

However, it should be assumed that [potential
[adversaries]{.mark}]{.underline} in the future will [[have the ability
to **disrupt**]{.underline}]{.mark} lines of communication, particularly
on [bulk **[shipments]{.mark} like** fuel **[oil]{.mark}**.
Modular]{.underline} nuclear [[reactors]{.underline}]{.mark} would
**[[reduce]{.underline}]{.mark}** the U.S. military's
[**[reliance]{.mark}** on fuel shipments]{.underline} and
[[ensure]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**[availability of]{.mark}** the
**[energy]{.mark}** needed for]{.underline} high-tech combat [systems.
[Developing]{.mark} and operating]{.underline} the
[[capability]{.underline}]{.mark} domestically would
[[provide]{.underline}]{.mark} the military training and
[[**experience** needed to operate]{.underline}]{.mark} nuclear
[reactors]{.underline} in support of overseas operations.

\<\<\<RELEVANT FOR ADVANTAGE 1\>\>\>

By building and operating modular reactors to power U.S. domestic bases,
the military could help address the existential challenge of climate
change by reducing the department's carbon footprint. [Since the
military has a **long history** of operating]{.underline} nuclear power
[reactors and has high **security**]{.underline} --- and often remote
bases to house them --- there may be [less public **pressure**
against]{.underline} building [military nuclear power
facilities]{.underline} than there would be against the immediate
expansion of civilian facilities.

Furthermore, [once]{.underline} the [military developed a **safe** track
record of operating]{.underline} modular nuclear [reactors]{.underline},
that could be used to [**support** the further development of
**civilian**]{.underline} nuclear power [facilities]{.underline}. If
this were successful, it could have a much larger impact on the nation's
overall greenhouse gas reduction.

[[Solar and wind]{.underline}]{.mark} power sourcing
[[cannot]{.underline}]{.mark} adequately [[meet]{.mark} the]{.underline}

[[in]{.mark} time of [crisis]{.mark}]{.underline} or war -- that is,

[[only]{.mark} [available tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline} that can meet
the needs of the DOD and increase U.S. energy security, I submit,
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} nuclear power14 -- especially in the form of

reactors]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

\[FIGURE OMITTED\]

Small Modular Reactors

Nuclear energy capabilities are the "all the above" option to meet DOD
needs15 and are not new a new concept the United States military. The
U.S. Navy is well known for its use of nuclear energy production on
ships and submarines. For the past 70 years, the Naval Nuclear
Propulsion Program has operated over 500 reactor cores, with 98 in
service today,16 while never experiencing an accident. From 1954 to
1977, the U.S. Army Nuclear Power Program also operated eight reactors,
five of which were portable.17

[Recent]{.underline} technological [**advances and signals**
from]{.underline} the commercial [market]{.underline} have [spurred a
**renewed investment** into nuclear energy]{.underline} production with
a variety of sizes and capabilities. Large, conventional reactors
already provide robust energy solutions for civilian grids. However,
Small Modular Reactors ([[SMRs]{.underline}]{.mark}) can [provide the
DOD the opportunity to [right-size]{.mark} energy
production]{.underline} to its energy requirements. DOD [interest in
SMRs originated from]{.underline} two vulnerabilities outlined in a
decade-old report: [**[dependence]{.mark}** of U.S. military bases
**[on]{.mark}**]{.underline} fragile civilian [**[grids]{.mark}**,
[and]{.mark} the **[challenge o]{.mark}f**]{.underline} safely and
reliably [**[supplying]{.mark}** [energy]{.mark}]{.underline} to service
members [in **forward** operating locations]{.underline}.18

SMRs can generate roughly one-third the capacity of traditional reactors
but their smaller footprint can be sited on locations not suitable for
large plants.19 Moreover, they can be built in waves, or incrementally,
to match the changing needs of an installation. SMRs weigh 20-40 tons,
can be transported by truck or plane, and can be installed in under 72
hours.20 More importantly, they can safely, efficiently, and cleanly
power military bases entirely independently of any public grids
vulnerable to attack or outage.

Currently, for instance, the DOD is pursuing a pilot program in SMR
technology called "Project Pele." This [[reactor]{.underline}]{.mark}
model is [designed to be [resilient to]{.mark} external
[hazards]{.mark}]{.underline} such as weather and kinetic attack,
[[and]{.mark} resilient against]{.underline} nuclear weapons
[[proliferation]{.underline}]{.mark} in unauthorized hands. 21 (Members
of the National Guard and Army Corps of Engineers will be charged with
assembling, moving, and operating the reactor.) A decade in the making,
the Project Pele reactor is not intended for forward use on the
battlefield.22 It is well-secured and utilizes spent fuel or
low-enriched uranium, making it less likely to cause proliferation
because such material would require further enrichment in order to be
usable in a nuclear weapon.

While the DOD should be commended for moving forward with a potentially
critical program, however, [[**regulatory** timelines]{.mark} and costs
for licensing]{.underline} are [[still]{.mark} [causing
**uncertainty**]{.mark}]{.underline}.23 Despite the U.S. having operated
modular nuclear reactors in the past, and the Navy's resounding success
in nuclear propulsion, the [regulatory process]{.underline} in this
industry can [[require up to **15 years**]{.mark} for approvals,
construction, and completion]{.underline}.24 Under its new leadership,
the [[DOD]{.underline}]{.mark} should [focus on **[streamlining]{.mark}
[operations]{.mark}** to [ensure]{.mark}]{.underline} opportunity for
[key [strategic advantages]{.mark} are not missed]{.underline}.

The U.S. is not alone in this quest. France, China, South Korea, and
Russia are all pursuing similar technology. In fact, China is currently
developing 16 non-naval SMR-type power reactor designs and Russia four,
while the U.S. is producing only one.25 [[If the]{.mark} DOD and
[U.S]{.mark}. government [fail]{.mark} to lead]{.underline} (or at least
to keep up) in this sector, we [[risk]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[standards]{.mark} being **[set by adversaries]{.mark}** and the
[industry]{.mark} being **largely [controlled overseas]{.mark}**, not to
mention]{.underline} our [[failing to ensure]{.mark} [adequate
power]{.mark} sourcing for U.S. military installations. Foreign
domination]{.underline} of this arena would [mean]{.underline} that
[[design]{.mark}s might **[not]{.mark}** be **[optimal]{.mark} for
U.S.**]{.underline} military **[applications]{.underline}** --
[or]{.underline} that [foreign [suppliers]{.mark} might **[prohibit
sales]{.mark} to U.S.**]{.underline} military
end-**[users]{.underline}** -- and that [expertise]{.underline} will be
[dominated by foreign companies]{.underline}.26 The DOD is on the right
track with Project Pele, but its programs should expand to include not
just SMRs but also very-small modular reactors (SMRs) for use on
forward, remote, or expeditionary bases, as well as larger modular
reactors for permanent, large military bases in the United States.

3.4 Resilience\
[SMRs can provide a **resilient** energy source]{.underline} inside the
fence line [for **military** installations]{.underline}. SMRs could
deliver primary, redundant, or emergency power to respond to [and
**minimize** the disruption of the energy supply]{.underline}. SMRs
could [supply **long-term** energy without off-base
**resources**]{.underline}.

[Two use]{.underline} cases that may be [of interest to the Air Force
are]{.underline} the [ability]{.underline} of the SMRs [to **black
start** and operate in **island mode**]{.underline}. [SMRs can
supply]{.underline} reliable [electricity for]{.underline} months or
even [**years** without **external** fuel]{.underline} supplies.
[This]{.underline} capability [would enable the **Air Force** base to
execute **critical** missions or extended operations at **remote**
locations]{.underline} without using other resources. SMRs [eliminate
the **logistical** tail associated with]{.underline} operating
[**fossil-fuel** generation]{.underline} sources inside the fence line.
[This]{.underline} capability [could **conserve**
resources]{.underline}, such as drivers to haul fuel, in hazardous
operating conditions or after catastrophic events.

3.4.1 Black Start\
**[Black start]{.underline}** describes the capability to
[restart]{.underline} the external [power]{.underline} distribution grid
[should it go **offline**]{.underline} (black). [Some]{.underline} SMRs
may have the capability to [restart the **grid**]{.underline}. 10 CFR 50
Appendix A contains nuclear power plant safety requirements for
redundant independent, power systems. These regulations require nuclear
reactor plants to have emergency diesel generators to provide
electricity to cool the nuclear fuel after the reactor stops operating,
unless a vendor demonstrates that their design does not require
alternating current electricity for safety-related systems and requests
a specific exemption to the NRC regulations. The diesel generator can
provide electricity to the systems to restart the SMR, if it is offline,
independently of the external grid. Once the SMR is restarted, it can
supply electricity to the local power buses and restart the distribution
grid.

3.4.2 Island Mode

**[Island mode]{.underline}** operation [is the]{.underline} grid
operating [**condition** where a]{.underline}n electricity [generator
supplies **power**]{.underline} to its loads and a limited number of
dedicated loads [while being **isolated**]{.underline} from transmission
grids or other loads. [This]{.underline} configuration
[powers]{.underline} the SMR's own electrical systems as well as the
**[mission]{.underline}** loads [of an Air Force base using its
**own**]{.underline} dedicated [grid]{.underline} or the existing grid
when it is isolated from the normal power distribution grid. This
**[insulates]{.underline}** the [Air **grid**]{.underline} [Force
base's]{.underline} and loads [from **further** power
disruptions]{.underline} affecting the larger transmission or
distribution grids.

[[Resiliency]{.underline}]{.mark}

The [[threats]{.mark} facing]{.underline} the U.S. [military [are
**substantial**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, the number of military
installations that are tied to civilian critical infrastructure
[[creates]{.underline}]{.mark} not only [**[direct
vulnerabilities]{.mark}** for the **DOD**]{.underline}, but may also
place civilians at risk as a sort of "collateral damage" if and when
[[adversaries]{.underline}]{.mark} seek to [[impede
operations]{.underline}]{.mark} at military facilities by crashing U.S.
civilian grids. 27 Adversaries such as
**[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[Iran]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and [**[No]{.mark}**rth
**[Ko]{.mark}**rea]{.underline} seem to view U.S. [electrical grid
vulnerabilities]{.underline} as offering them a [potential **asymmetric
advantage**]{.underline} in time of crisis or conflict, and they have
offensive cyber and other capabilities that could be used against those
grids. They might, for instance, calculate that a war of critical
infrastructure attacks would impede us more than it would impede them,
that we would be unwilling to attack their civilian electric grids in
response, or simply that causing [domestic **confusion**]{.underline}
and **[disruption]{.underline}** in the United States is their best way
to **[[hobble]{.underline}]{.mark}** U.S. [military
[mobilization]{.mark}]{.underline} against them overseas. Attacks on
American critical infrastructure might be [felt likely to]{.underline}
discredit the U.S. Government, [distract]{.underline} the public and
[military]{.underline} from military operations, or simply represent an
[[**easy** means of retal]{.underline}]{.mark}iation. 28
[[Removing]{.mark} DOD [installations]{.mark}]{.underline} [[from
the]{.mark} [public]{.mark}]{.underline} grid would thus
[[lessen]{.underline}]{.mark} the [**national [security]{.mark}**
[impact]{.mark}]{.underline} of such disruptions if they were to occur,
and would help [protect American civilians]{.underline} from being
caught up in such problems by [reducing]{.underline} the
[incentive]{.underline} for an opponent to attack [civilian electricity
sources]{.underline} in the first place.

Enhancing [[electrical **resiliency**]{.underline}]{.mark} for military
operations might also contribute not merely to [[**disincentivizing**
adversary aggression]{.underline}]{.mark} against U.S. civilian
infrastructure, but [[also]{.underline}]{.mark} to
[**[deter]{.mark}**ring [it]{.mark}]{.underline}. By removing military
functions from the civilian grid, the [United States]{.underline} would
be **[signaling]{.underline}** to adversaries that [[hampering]{.mark}
U.S. civilian [grids]{.mark}]{.underline} would thereafter be [[viewed
as]{.underline}]{.mark} a direct [[attack on]{.underline}]{.mark}
American **[[civilians]{.underline}]{.mark}** that has no military
rationale -- and hence as a dramatic escalation, even a war crime.
Additionally, building a [capable [energy resource]{.mark}]{.underline}
for DOD facilities that [has [**robust** cyber
defenses]{.mark}]{.underline} would make clear that any adversary that
did attack the U.S. civilian grid would face an [American military
unimpeded by]{.underline} any [loss of electrical power]{.underline} at
its most important facilities. The U.S. would thus be in better position
to "[deter by denial]{.underline}" (because grid attacks would be less
effective in achieving their goals) as well as to "deter by punishment"
(because civilian grid attacks would elicit a more effective military
response).

nuclear security in the Arctic. [[Despite this, **Moscow remains

Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused NATO of militarizing the
Arctic through increasingly frequent crisis response exercises. Yet
[Russia]{.underline} is guilty of the same. Its [new foreign policy
concepts and doctrines call the Arctic "a vital area for ensuring our
national interests in the global ocean," and [Moscow]{.mark} has
[warned]{.mark} that [it will use **"any means necessary**" to secure
its interests there]{.mark}.]{.underline} Those means include the
Northern Fleet, whose ships regularly---and conspicuously---traverse the
Arctic Ocean, training to counter Western submarines. Particularly
crucial to Russia's plans is its fleet of nuclear submarines, which has
become significantly more active in northern waters in the past decade.
The fleet consists of twelve strategic nuclear submarines carrying up to
192 nuclear-capable ballistic missiles, twenty-four nuclear submarines
armed with cruise missiles, and ten special-purpose nuclear submarines,
with another twelve nuclear submarines under construction or nearly
ready for commission[. The [Arctic i]{.mark}s also a [testing ground
for]{.mark} new [nuclear-powered]{.mark}, nuclear-[armed
weapons]{.mark}---[from the Burevestnik cruise missile to the Poseidon
torpedo---contributing]{.mark} to]{.underline} both [[regional
tensions]{.underline} and]{.mark} the [[risk of radiation
accidents]{.underline}]{.mark}. That [**[risk is growing]{.mark}**, not
only [because of Russia's military activities]{.mark}, [but]{.mark}
[also]{.mark} because of [its]{.mark} [increasing economic activity in
the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rosatom, [the state nuclear company,
operates the eight-ship nuclear icebreaker fleet]{.underline} that is
key to the Northern Sea Route, along which [36 million tons of cargo
were transported in 2023]{.underline}, up from 4 million in 2014. That
number is expected to reach 270 million tons in 2035, while the
[[nuclear icebreaker fleet is to expand by seven more
vessels.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Investing at the top of the world isn't easy. The remoteness of the
region, and a lack of basic infrastructure means the Arctic is simply
not wired into the rest of the global trade system. Arctic financial
data are scarce. But the global asset manager Guggenheim Partners has
shed some light on what's likely to come next in the Arctic. They've
spent the last seven years studying the region and the last three
amassing a database of 900 planned, in-process, finished, cancelled and
desired Arctic infrastructure projects.

Some of the projects reflect grand ambitions to upgrade national,
industrial and social systems. Others are smaller scale and meant to
connect remote places into larger patterns of trade. Taken together,
they would require as much as \$1 trillion in investments.

Arctic," The War Horse, 11/19/2020,
https://thewarhorse.org/military-arctic-new-cold-war-with-russia-and-climate-change/

[One]{.underline} of the [great]{.underline}est [risk]{.underline}s,
**[according to Niklas Granholm]{.underline}**, [is]{.underline} that
the Arctic region will undergo a "Balkanization" like what occurred in
Eastern Europe after the fall of the Soviet Union. Granholm is the
deputy director of studies at the Swedish Defence Research Agency, and
he points to the Faroe Islands calling for self-rule from Denmark,
Scotland clamoring for independence from the United Kingdom after
Brexit, and the resurgence of troubles in Northern Ireland as indicators
that more fragmentation and [political division in the Arctic could
lead]{.underline} to less cooperation or even [hostility]{.underline}.
[Paired with]{.underline} the [great-power competition among the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [Russia]{.underline}, [and
China]{.underline}, [any]{.underline} **[Balkanization of the
region]{.underline}** [would]{.underline}, in Granholm's words, [be a
"double whammy]{.underline}" [and]{.underline} could make [the
Arctic]{.underline} much more [combustible.]{.underline}
"[What]{.underline}ever **[happens in the Arctic]{.underline}** **[won't
stay there]{.underline}**," he said. ["It]{.underline} **[will
escalate."]{.underline}** Is this the beginning of a new Cold War? The
new Norwegian radar system undermines Russia's ability to launch a
retaliatory nuclear strike from its submarine fleet in the Arctic, New
York Times reported, and that bothers Russia, according to Lt. Col.
Tormod Heier, a faculty adviser at the Norwegian Defense University
College. Because it upsets the strategic nuclear balance between the
United States and Russia, the new radar system establishes a blow to
Russia's last indisputable claim to great-power status. "There is a new
Cold War," Heier told the Times, adding that [the risk of nuclear war
was]{.underline} **[much higher now]{.underline}** than in the old Cold
War "[because Russia is]{.underline} so much **[weaker,]{.underline}**
[and because of that much]{.underline} **[more dangerous and
unpredictable]{.underline}**." In recognition of the threats posed by a
new Cold War, [the Pentagon released an updated National Defense
Strategy]{.underline} in January 2018. While the document makes no
specific mention of the Arctic, it recognizes the threats posed by
great-power competition (especially as it relates to America's eroding
competitive edge) and clarifies that potential [conflict with Russia and
China]{.underline} [had supplanted terror]{.underline}ism **[as the
biggest threat]{.underline}** to American national security. To achieve
this end state, the United States must confront three risks that, if
they materialized, would stand in the way. First, bad actors could use
the Arctic as a staging ground for an attack on the U.S. homeland.
Second, [states like Russia and China could challenge]{.underline} the
[rules-based]{.underline} international [order in the
Arctic]{.underline} [in ways]{.underline} that could [lead to
conflict.]{.underline} Third, but not least, tensions, competition, and
conflict in other parts of the world could spill over into the Arctic.
Three months later, the U.S. Coast Guard released its own strategy for
the Arctic, which called for funding to upgrade ships, aircraft, and
unmanned systems operating in the region. Admiral Karl Schultz, the
Coast Guard's commandant, told the Washington Post that the goal should
be to return the Arctic to a "peaceful place where we work to cross
international lines here with partner nations that share interests in a
transparent fashion." Projecting sovereignty, he continued, will help
expedite that return. But all these plans have failed to persuade
decision makers to establish new organizational structures designed to
address changes in the Arctic wrought by climate change and the rush to
exploit the region's natural resources. The plans do not include any
substantive plans to guide the construction of infrastructure needed in
the region, nor do they detail how resources will need to be reallocated
to mitigate risks and help the United States reach its desired end
state. They provide a vision for the future, but they do not provide a
road map on how to get there. **[Russia won't back down]{.underline}**
In late August 2019, a Russian submarine emerged from the icy waters
near the North Pole and fired a Sineva-type intercontinental ballistic
missile capable of carrying a nuclear warhead. That same day, another
Russian submarine in the Arctic Circle launched a Bulava-type
intercontinental ballistic missile from beneath the surface of the
Barents Sea. One missile hit a remote corner of Russia's Pacific coast,
and the other landed on the Kanin Peninsula. Twelve years after Russia
planted its flag on the seabed below the North Pole, this demonstration
of its military capabilities in the Arctic can be seen as its latest
attempt to assert its sovereignty in the region. [Against]{.underline} a
broader [backdrop of]{.underline} [distrust and diminished
comm]{.underline}unication [across the U.S.-Russia divide]{.underline},
[there exists]{.underline} a [risk]{.underline} [that]{.underline}

**[misinterpretations]{.underline}** [could escalate]{.underline} in[to

### Airpower\-\--North Korea\-\--1AC/2AC

#### It's [necessary]{.underline} for a credible, survivable [deterrent]{.underline}\-\--that stops North Korean [first-use]{.underline}. 

**Hughes '23** \[Zach; August 9; Commander of the 25th Fighter Squadron
at Osan Air Base, Republic of Korea, U.S. Air Force senior pilot; War on
the Rocks, "Facing Down an Arsenal: Considering Agile Combat Employment
in Korea,"
https://warontherocks.com/2023/08/facing-down-an-arsenal-considering-agile-combat-employment-in-korea/\]

In March of 2023, commuters in South Korea had a front-row seat to an
unexpected airshow: an armada of U.S. and Korean attack and cargo
aircraft unceremoniously landing on the highway in front of them. These
aviators demonstrated their ability to survive and operate even after
their primary airfields succumbed to a North Korean missile attack.
Meanwhile, airmen from Osan Air Base deployed dispersed detachments of
fighter aircraft and support personnel. Led by junior officers and
sergeants, these dispersed teams continued to generate exercise combat
sorties despite significant logistical hurdles, intermittent
communications, and artillery bombardment from a simulated adversary.
Begun as an experiment, these events grew to something more: a
demonstration of what a survivable, credible deterrent might look like
in Korea.

In the past five years, the U.S. Air Force has reoriented its focus
toward a potential conflict with China, the "pacing threat" outlined in
the 2022 National Security Strategy. To better prepare for combat
against an adversary like China, the Air Force has adopted agile combat
employment: a doctrine of dispersing combat aircraft to numerous bases,
greatly complicating Chinese targeting. Unfortunately, the same urgent
"problem framing" has not informed a similar look at another
Indo-Pacific flashpoint: [[a]{.mark}n increasingly [**belligerent** and
nuclear]{.mark}-armed **[No]{.mark}**rth
**[Ko]{.mark}**rea]{.underline}. Recent North Korean bellicosity ---
and South Korean assertiveness in response --- [[warrants]{.mark}
continued intellectual [**investment** in]{.mark}]{.underline} how to
position [U.S. forces]{.underline} in this part of the world. 

The North Korean threat has changed, and now the same operational
[**problems** driving the **[A]{.mark}**ir **[F]{.mark}**orce to adopt
[**agile** combat]{.mark}]{.underline} employment against China are
present [in **[No]{.mark}**rth **[Ko]{.mark}**rea:
**[long-range]{.mark}** precision fires with the potential to
**[overwhelm]{.mark}** hardened air [bases]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Fortunately, the [**A**ir **F**orce can]{.underline} address these
concerns by [explor]{.underline}ing a modified version of [**agile**
combat employment in Korea]{.underline}. Furthermore, Korea has some
advantages that offset the challenges normally associated with agile
combat employment, including assured allied support, robust lines of
communication, and prepositioned war materiel. 

[[Airpower]{.mark} is]{.underline} the United Nations Command's
[**[greatest]{.mark}** asymmetric [advantage, a **deterrent**]{.mark}
that has [maintained peace for **seventy years**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
This deterrent [should be [**survivable** to remain
**credible**]{.mark}]{.underline}, requiring fresh thinking in the face
of new threats. Using the same harsh logic applied to the rest of the
Pacific, the Air Force will likely conclude that [**agile** combat
employment is the [**key** to keeping **airpower**]{.mark} in Korea
**[credible]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

A Growing Threat: The Need for Agile Combat Employment Experimentation
in Korea

Over the past three decades, both China and Russia have invested
in precise long-range fires with the capability to disrupt any buildup
of regional airpower --- especially the kind of massive buildup used
in Operation Desert Storm. While not singularly decisive, such weapons
are sufficiently precise and numerous to make any concentration of
combat aircraft at major bases prohibitively costly. Russia
demonstrated lethal examples of such standoff weapons against Ukraine,
while the establishment of the independent People's Liberation Army
Rocket Force signaled China's focus on long-range missiles.

[It is **crucial** not to **underestimate** these threats]{.underline}.
A recent open-source wargame pitting the United States against China
found that the U.S. Air Force stood to lose up to 700 combat aircraft in
three weeks in a conflict over Taiwan, and 90 percent of those aircraft
were destroyed on the ground. The same wargame concluded that further
investment in aircraft dispersal was urgently needed. Recognizing that
its preferred, highly efficient "mega base" construct was becoming
extremely vulnerable, the U.S. Air Force adopted agile combat
employment as its best mitigation.

[The **same logic** underlying]{.underline} aircraft dispersal in a
conflict against [**China** is present in **[No]{.mark}**rth
**[Ko]{.mark}**rea]{.underline}. The Korean People's Army has the
[**[largest artillery]{.mark}** force]{.underline} in the world and has
recently been outfitted with new 300mm multiple-launch rocket systems.
These systems have "negligible" circular-error-probable (likely miss
distance) and [can probably [range **all**]{.mark} major
[bases in]{.mark} the **[northern]{.mark}** half of **[So]{.mark}**uth
**[Ko]{.mark}**rea]{.underline} --- [[including]{.underline}]{.mark}
those that host **[[U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark}** combat
[airpower]{.underline}. This is to say nothing of the nuclear-capable
cruise and ballistic missiles fielded by the Korean People's Army
Strategic Force. Additionally, unlike China, [**[No]{.mark}**rth
**[Ko]{.mark}**rea could]{.underline} employ a deadly combination of
conventional and chemical weapons. These precise conventional systems
could degrade any chemically protected shelters, allowing chemical
weapons to [[cause **major** disruptions]{.mark} to an
**airbase**]{.underline}. Furthermore, North Korean leader
[**[Kim]{.mark}** Jong Un has indicated that he [**intends** to use
**nuclear**]{.mark} weapons [**first** in]{.mark} a [conflict
with]{.mark} the **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline}.
The consolidation of U.S. combat power in a small handful of bases in
South Korea is a tempting target for a nuclear strike. Finally, North
Korea has the largest special operations force in the world, with over
200,000 troops deployable from an armada of aircraft, submarines, and
hovercraft. [These **forces** would]{.underline} create a "second front"
in South Korea, and one of their **[[target]{.underline}]{.mark}**s
would likely be [major **[airbases]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Even a few
infiltrators on a flightline of densely packed aircraft could wreak
havoc, as tragically unfolded at Camp Bastion, Afghanistan, in 2012.

The geography of East Asia is a key potential variable increasing both
the probability and impact of a US conflict with the PRC or North Korea
expanding to simultaneous conflicts with both---particularly given the
increasing ranges of modern sensors and weapons systems.

THE DIAGNOSIS

The [risk of conflict with]{.underline} the People's Republic of
**[China]{.underline}** (PRC) [or]{.underline} **[No]{.underline}**rth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea---[especially]{.underline} the potential for
**[[simultaneous escalation]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[involving]{.underline} **[both]{.underline}**---[[poses a **serious
threat**]{.underline}]{.mark} to the United States and its interests.
[This threat is [heightened by]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[possibility
of]{.mark} either adversary resorting to]{.underline} limited
[**[nuclear attacks]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

[A]{.underline} **[[two-front war]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in Asia [could
unfold]{.mark}]{.underline} even [[without]{.underline}]{.mark} close
[[coop]{.underline}]{.mark}eration [between **Beijing** and
**Pyongyang**]{.underline}. Dysfunctional coordination or
misunderstandings could just as easily lead to conflict. Furthermore,
[with]{.underline} both **[China]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[No]{.underline}**rth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea [developing
greater]{.underline} incentives and **[capabilities]{.underline}**
[for]{.underline} limited **[nuclear attacks]{.underline}**, the [[risk
of]{.mark} a **[nuc]{.mark}lear [war]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in East
Asia [is rising]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Deep-seated organizational and cognitive biases have been obstructing
the ability of the United States and its allies to anticipate
simultaneous conflicts with China and North Korea. Such biases also
impede their preparations to manage such escalation and to counter
limited nuclear attacks.

US and allied capabilities, command-and-control arrangements, and
military posture are currently unsuited to provide a robust military
response in the case of a two-front war and/or a limited nuclear war in
East Asia. [Simultaneous conflicts]{.underline} with both adversaries
[would impose]{.underline} **[severe]{.underline}** [operational and
strategic challenges on]{.underline} the **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [and]{.underline} its [allies
and]{.underline}/or their [employment of **nuclear
weapons**]{.underline}.

THE PRESCRIPTION

[[If]{.mark} a **US [conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} [with one adversary
in East Asia [doesn't **end quickly**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [it is
likely to **widen**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

The United States and its allies should reconceptualize planning for
aggression by either the PRC or North Korea as marking the start of an
Indo-Pacific campaign that also requires deterring---and potentially
defeating---the other possible adversary.

The **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates and South Korea
[should shift]{.underline} their [focus to]{.underline} a broader
priority of protecting South Korea from aggression---encompassing
**[deterrence]{.underline}** [of PRC aggression in addition to North
Korean aggression]{.underline}.

Resolve: The Evolution of Airpower,"
https://warontherocks.com/2021/08/from-desert-storm-to-inherent-resolve-the-evolution-of-airpower/\]

The capabilities of contemporary U.S. airpower have allowed American
leaders to intervene in international conflicts while limiting risk to
U.S. ground troops, thereby reducing opposition from those wary of
putting U.S. boots on the ground. At times, [**[American]{.mark}**
leader**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} have [[employed **airstrikes**]{.mark}
because they wanted [to "**do something**" and appear
strong]{.mark}]{.underline} during a crisis,
**[[whether]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [attacks [**succeeded** or
not]{.mark}]{.underline}. But airpower is not without risks. Even with
increased precision, modern technology, and stringent measures, airpower
cannot avoid civilian casualties. It also is not a sure means for a
swift and decisive victory, as the recent resurgence of ISIL fighters
has shown.

The Siren Song of Airpower

There are important differences between full-blown air campaigns and
bounded strikes, such as those on Iranian targets in Iraq and Syria or
recently against the Taliban, in terms of the theory for how [[airpower
will]{.underline}]{.mark} achieve the desired effect. Moreover, they
[[**differ** in]{.mark} the longevity and
**[intensity]{.mark}**]{.underline} of air operations. [In]{.underline}
the [**Gulf War** and]{.underline} during [**Inherent Resolve**, U.S.
leaders]{.underline} correctly [applied airpower]{.underline} to achieve
the operational aims of liberating illegally seized territory. In both
cases, the United States sought to produce a durable outcome --- the
liberation of Kuwait, and the liberation of Iraqi and Syrian territory
from ISIL rule.

In contrast, the goal of the recent strikes in Iraq and Syria is less
clear. They were a proportional response to Iranian proxy attacks on
U.S. facilities and forces in the Middle East, but the linkages of very
discrete attacks on these particular targets to broader outcomes is
tenuous. Instead, these strikes appear to be another half-hearted
attempt at punitive or coercive diplomacy through airstrikes, which have
historically failed to have the intended effect due to the limited
nature of the attacks and the unclear links to goals.

Already, the Biden administration may be finding this out the hard way.
Despite the strikes being intended as a deterrent measure, they have
failed to halt attacks on U.S. equities in the region. The [recent
**airstrikes** were **promptly** met by]{.underline} the very type of
[drone attacks]{.underline} on a U.S. facility in Baghdad the
administration sought to halt.

During the withdrawal of American forces from Afghanistan, the
**[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark}** administration [[employed
airstrikes]{.mark} to "**do something**" as Taliban]{.underline} forces
[have captured [city after city]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
Initially, these strikes may have been to encourage the Afghans to
"fight for themselves" as Biden has exhorted. This halfhearted support
has failed to turn the tide in Afghanistan. Although a much more
aggressive air campaign launched earlier could have blunted the
Taliban's offensive, alone it would not have defeated the Taliban. As
the war against ISIL demonstrated, American airpower can halt an
offensive, but it alone cannot liberate captured territory. A capable
ground force is also needed. Yet, after 20 years of trying and billions
of dollars invested, the Afghan military did not emerge as this partner
and airpower alone will not liberate Afghanistan from the Taliban.

Airpower is an "unusually seductive" form of military power because of
its immediate effects, distance from the battlefield, and relatively
low-risk application. But [[there are **right** and **wrong** ways to
apply airpower]{.mark}. Using **[advanced]{.mark}**]{.underline}
airpower [[capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} in an operation [with clear
tactical **goals**]{.underline} --- as evidenced by the Gulf War and
Inherent Resolve --- may [[achieve]{.mark} battlefield
**[victories]{.mark}** and support foreign policy aims]{.underline} with
limited risk to U.S. forces. Employing airpower as a form of coercion in
one-off strikes without a precise operational objective, or merely as a
way of demonstrating action, is less impressive.

Presidents and their advisers should be mindful that, although
innovations in warfighting may achieve tactical and operational aims,
they do not guarantee strategic success. Today, although the Islamic
State's so-called caliphate has been destroyed, groups of well-financed
fighters remain active, and the airstrikes against these targets
continue. The combined effects of air and landpower can curb threats to
regional stability, but they cannot defeat ideology.

At present, it appears as though the [[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark}
administration has [[**seized** on airpower]{.mark} as the **preferred
tool**]{.underline} to do something --- even if it fails to achieve its
purported goal --- as opposed to doing nothing. But this approach has
failed to deter further Iranian proxy attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq or
to keep the Taliban from taking Kabul. Such actions appear mainly
intended to appease domestic critics who accuse Biden of being weak on
Iran or abandoning Afghanistan. Moreover, airpower not tied to broader
objectives that align with national interests risks unintended
consequences, which may undermine the administration's longstanding
plans to reduce the U.S. military presence in the Middle East and
Afghanistan, and distract from the Pentagon's efforts to focus on China.

#### The [alternative]{.underline} is [air denial]{.underline}\-\--that has [zero]{.underline} credibility, greenlighting [hotspot escalation]{.underline}.

Pape's entire book rests on [[the idea of **denial**]{.mark} as an
effective tool]{.underline} to coerce. Denial only "works" if it
effectively coerces. Denial's effectiveness is often measured relative
to the timing of an adversary's capitulation. [**[Surrender]{.mark}**
long [before]{.mark}]{.underline} a decisive [[victory]{.mark} should be
viewed as a]{.underline} major [success]{.underline}, and surrender
shortly before a decisive victory should be considered a minor success.
By this logic, a surrender only after a decisive victory should be
viewed as a coercive failure.\[5\] Denial is a form of coercion that
uses "military means to prevent the adversary from achieving its
political objectives or territorial goals."\[6\] In contrast to denial's
military focus, punishment is a form of coercion that imposes costs on
the civilian population to a level that forces national concession. In
WWII, denial was ineffective in both the European and Pacific theaters
because surrender only occurred after decisive victories. In the Korean
and Vietnam Wars, denial worked sometimes. However, [[the **resounding
message**]{.mark} from history [was]{.mark}]{.underline} that the
cumulative effects of synchronized **[[air]{.underline}]{.mark}**, land,
and sea [campaigns [led to **decisive victories**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Pape's bias against strategic bombers created tunnel vision which drove
him to evaluate air operations in isolation from other related
operations. As a result, Pape's conclusions have little practical value.
[Pape's]{.underline} strategic [argument is that **airpower** has
four]{.underline} possible [strategies]{.underline} for achieving
coercion: [**decapitation**, **punishment**, risk, and
**denial**]{.underline}.\[7\] He explains how decapitation and risk do
not work, and punishment is immoral and ineffective, so only denial can
succeed in conventional wars.\[8\] As an unintentional critique,
military strategist Mark Clodfelter explains that [positive
**goals**]{.underline} are military goals that [can be "achieved
**only** by applying **military force."**]{.underline} Negative goals
are military goals that are "achievable only by limiting military
force"\[9\] Pape's conclusion -- that denial can work, but strategic
bombing is not the best way to achieve denial -- can be interpreted as
two negative goals: 1) do not use decapitation, punishment, or risk, and
2) do not use strategic bombing to achieve denial. In the same way that
negative goals restrict military operations, Pape's double-negative
provides a narrow concept of what not to do and communicates very little
about what militaries should do.

Analyzing Pape's Argument

Even without negative goals, [[the]{.mark} cumulative [effects of
**joint op**]{.mark}eration**[s]{.mark}** [proved **decisive**
in]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[European theater]{.underline}]{.mark} in
WWII, but denial still did not work. The Anglo-American Combined Bomber
Offensive (CBO) pursued both denial and punishment campaigns. The US
Army Air Force conducted a strategic bombing denial campaign against the
German military-industrial base.\[10\] Simultaneously, the British Royal
Air Force conducted a strategic bombing punishment campaign against
Germany's 58 largest population centers.\[11\] Most historians agree
that, when analyzed in isolation, the CBO failed to effectively degrade
German production or coerce the German government to capitulate. Both
people and buildings proved more resilient than punishment and
industrial web theories suggested. However, by attacking both cities and
industrial centers, the CBO forced the German Luftwaffe to focus on
national defense and hold aircraft in reserve, away from the
front.\[12\] Holding aircraft back to defend the homeland decreased
German capacity to repel the Allied invasion of Normandy and drastically
reduced air support to the Germans fighting on the Eastern Front against
the Soviet Union.\[13\] As a result, the American, British, and Canadian
ground forces gained a strategic foothold in mainland Europe, and the
Russians completed their march to Berlin.\[14\] Strategic bombing as a
form of independent airpower was not decisive. Still, while not
effectively coercive, lethal airpower supported a strategic land
objective, and the cumulative effects of independent air and land
operations resulted in decisive military victory.

The Germans had many opportunities to surrender before the first week of
May in 1945, but they did not surrender until the Red Army held the
German capital of Berlin. This provides the primary argument against the
effectiveness of denial in the European Theater in WWII. Denial is a
form of coercion, and coercion seeks surrender before decisive
victory.\[15\] The German military\'s total defeat before its surrender
meant Pape's conceptualization of denial did not work, and arguably,
both denial and coercion failed in the European Theater in WWII. After
analyzing a single theater of a single war, Pape's conclusions about
both denial strategy and strategic bombing are on shaky ground.

[In [the **Pacific**]{.mark} Theater]{.underline} in WWII, much like in
the European Theater, [strategic bombing was **effective**]{.underline},
but [punishment]{.underline} rather than denial [brought about the end
of the war]{.underline}. Specific strategic bombing efforts included the
American firebombing of Tokyo, which resulted in an estimated 100,000
civilian casualties.\[16\] While there are conflicting accounts of
whether firebombing was a denial strategy focused on the Japanese
cottage industry or a punishment strategy focused on the Japanese
people, the bombing was effective enough to drive one-seventh of Tokyo's
population out of the city.\[17\] Another strategic bombing effort
involved B-29s conducting aerial mining of Japan's major ports and
waterways. Because Japan's people were so dependent on imports for
survival, the sea mines had surprisingly devastating effects.\[18\]
Ultimately, in the Pacific Theater, strategic bombing was effective.

The combination of firebombing and mining decimated the Japanese economy
to the extent that LeMay thought the Japanese would have surrendered in
two weeks even without using the atomic bombs. Despite numerous
opportunities to surrender, the Japanese did not capitulate until the US
dropped the nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\[19\] The Japanese
people experienced incredible hardship and devastation. In the end, the
civilian-focused punishment strategy rather than a denial strategy
brought the Japanese to surrender.

In 1946, Bernard Brodie stated somewhat prophetically, "Thus far, the
chief purpose of our military establishment has been to win wars. From
now on, its chief purpose must be to avert them. It can have almost no
other useful purpose."\[20\] In the 30 years following WWII, the fear of
another world war coupled with the unprecedented destructive power of
nuclear weapons ushered in wars with new limits -- negative goals. These
negative goals had significant implications for denial strategy,
coercion, and the effectiveness of airpower. As explained by ethicist
Lawrence Freedman, "The UN forces had prohibited using nuclear weapons
and respected Chinese and Soviet territories as sanctuaries -- which
proved a problematic set of conditions for achieving victory."\[21\]

[In the [**Korean Wa**r]{.mark}, air-based **denial**]{.underline}
efforts [could **not bring**]{.underline} the [Chinese and North Koreans
to the **peace** table]{.underline}. The US strategic bombing efforts in
North Korea failed at first because the US insisted on applying the
industrial web theory to a non-industrialized nation.\[22\] The US
bombed major North Korean cities and carefully selected strategic
targets, including rail yards, chemical plants, and oil refineries.
Still, the North Koreans persisted in combat, supported by Chinese
ground forces and Chinese airmen flying Russian-provided MiG-15s.
Strategic bombing could not have done more than it did in North Korea.
Even when no significant structures remained standing in North Korea,
airpower was still perceived as inadequate because it had not ended the
war.\[23\] Despite the physical devastation, the Chinese and the North
Koreans only came to the peace table after a two-year United
Nations-backed punishment campaign.\[24\]

\<\<TEXT CONDNSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

The analysis of WWII and the Korean War already demonstrated the issues
with the quality and consistency of Pape's conclusions about the
effectiveness of strategic bombing. Pape was right that strategic
bombing was not the best way to achieve denial, and Pape was wrong about
the general ineffectiveness of strategic bombing. However, Pape's
observations about strategic bombing are superfluous to the more
critical arguments about whether denial is effective and whether
military-based coercion is a realistic option against nuclear powers. At
the beginning of the Korean War, the international perception of the
destructive capability of nuclear weapons instigated the introduction of
negative goals. As the nuclear age progressed, mutually assured
destruction and adversaries' ability to retaliate with nuclear weapons
perpetuated the normalization of negative goals. Reality, including
Russia's recent invasion of Ukraine, indicates the nuclear age
fundamentally changed how the US engages (or rather does not engage)
adversaries, especially nuclear powers like Russia. Pape's Argument in
the Russia-Ukraine-NATO Context In the geopolitical context of 2022,
Russia has actively defied US and NATO deterrence efforts.\[25\] In
2015, after Russia annexed Crimea, war scholar Hugo Spaulding predicted
that Russian President Vladimir Putin would likely seek to overthrow the
Ukrainian government or blur the geographic boundaries between Russia
and Ukraine to buffer the perceived threat posed by NATO.\[26\] As if in
fulfillment of Spaulding's prophecy, on 24 February 2022, Russia again
invaded Ukraine. In a globally broadcasted speech announcing the Russian
"special military operation," President Putin's stated goals were to
"demilitarize and denazify" Ukraine.\[27\] It is difficult to tell
whether Putin's stated goals are transparent or whether other agendas
are at play, so Putin's perceived goals vary amongst scholars and
theorists. What does not vary is that the absolute destruction the
Russians imposed on Ukrainian cities and people appears most synonymous
with a punishment strategy. Putin attacking Ukraine just as the
Ukrainian government sought NATO membership is simultaneously a
deterrence success and deterrence failure. As articulated by Benjamin
Jensen, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, Russia's invasion is a NATO success because the NATO alliance
deterred Putin from direct aggression toward NATO member states. For the
time being, the conflict is limited to Ukraine, a non-NATO state.
However, the invasion is also a failure because the NATO alliance did
not deter Putin from attempting territorial conquest in Europe.\[28\]
Since deterrence failed, the US and its NATO allies now face a strategic
problem -- how to coerce Putin to stop territorial conquests in Europe.
US and NATO responses to Russia's attack on Ukraine provide evidence to
further dismantle Pape's argument for the separation of conventional and
nuclear deterrence and coercion. To date, US and NATO nations' support
for Ukraine consisted of sanctions on Russia and weapon shipments to
Ukraine.\[29\] Despite Ukrainian President Zelensky's repeated requests
for a NATO-enforced no-fly-zone over Ukraine, no NATO nation, including
the US, has attacked Russian military assets.\[30\] US and NATO
hesitation is rooted in the perceived risk of escalation.\[31\] The
prevailing concern is that Russia and three NATO member-states -- the
US, the UK, and France -- are nuclear states, and that any intervention
risks escalation that might result in nuclear retaliation.\[32\]
Benjamin Jensen explains that "When nuclear states compete, the rungs of
the escalation ladder quickly bring states to a point of no return
beyond which nuclear weapons lose their deterrent value and become a
means of inflicting pain to force capitulation."\[33\] NATO's nuclear
concerns gain some substance because Putin has already demonstrated a
willingness to inflict significant pain to force Ukraine's capitulation.
Ultimately, the perceived Russian nuclear threat has had a tangible
effect on NATO and US decisions to employ even conventional forces.

\<\<PARAGRAPH BREAKS RESUME\>\>

[[If the **US** and]{.mark} its]{.underline} NATO [[**allies cannot**
engage in]{.underline}]{.mark} conventional [[**kinetic**
combat]{.underline}]{.mark} to coerc

e Russia, [Pape\'s]{.underline} academically-focused
[**[attempts]{.mark}** to divorce politics and nuclear weapons from
conventional coercion theory **[failed]{.mark}**]{.underline}.\[34\]
Using conventional denial strategies to coerce nuclear powers was
unrealistic or dishonest. Nuclear and conventional coercion and
deterrence are undeniably linked, and adversaries' nuclear capabilities
can negate the military instrument of power ([including conventional
**airpower**]{.underline}). While Pape may be right that strategic
bombing is not the best way to achieve denial, analysis of his argument
as well as changes in the character of war before and after the nuclear
age indicate Pape's conclusions about denial and strategic bombing have
little practical value.\[35\]

Nuclear weapons changed the character of war between nuclear powers.
Now, [**rather** than risk nuclear **retaliation**]{.underline} or
mutual destruction, [nuclear powers]{.underline} (and alliances like
NATO with nuclear-armed states) [**avoid** direct force-on-force
**combat**]{.underline}, especially within the national boundaries of
nuclear powers, thus [blunting the **usefulness** of denial
strategies]{.underline} in major conflicts. When coercing a
nuclear-capable adversary, the cumulative effects of all the instruments
of power -- particularly the economic and information instruments --
result in better outcomes than the independent use of the military
instrument. This also applies to independent airpower and denial-focused
coercion efforts.

Conclusion

Pape's work was an essential nail in the coffin of the US Air Force
bomber myths; however, the usefulness of Pape's argument ends
there.\[36\] **[[WWII provided]{.underline}]{.mark}** one [[example of
**denial failing**]{.mark} to coerce an enemy [and]{.mark} one example
of **[punishment succeeding]{.mark}**]{.underline} in coercing the
enemy; the Korean War provided an instance of strategic bombing being
deemed ineffective even when no buildings remained intact in an entire
country. Of these outcomes, only the Korean War supports Pape's argument
about the ineffectiveness of strategic bombing. While [[strategic
**bombing** can be **effective**, denial is
difficult]{.underline}]{.mark} to achieve, [[especially in]{.mark} the
**[nuclear age]{.mark}** or]{.underline} when [employing independent
**airpower**]{.underline}. Although denial is inconsistently effective
at achieving coercion, denial is the right thing to do, especially when
contrasted with punishment and risk strategies. As Carl von Clausewitz
postulated, using military forces to stop political objectives is the
most fundamental purpose of war.\[37\]

#### It caps global war from [deterrence gaps]{.underline}, [fog of war]{.underline}, AND [infrastructure breakdown]{.underline}.

**Robinson '24** \[Tim; July 12; Editor-in-Chief of Aerospace; Royal
Aeronautical Society, "Air Power and Deterrence,"
https://www.aerosociety.com/news/air-power-and-deterrence/\]

As noted above, this year's event comes at a highly critical time for
those involved in delivering military force via the air domain. First,
off [the war in [**Ukraine** continues]{.mark} into]{.underline} its
[second year [with]{.mark}]{.underline} ongoing [[**missile** and
**drone**]{.mark} attack**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}, survival of
Ukrainian AF against the odds and rise of the drones
[[highlighting]{.mark} the **[importance]{.mark}**]{.underline} and role
[[of **air power**]{.underline}]{.mark} in a peer-on-peer conflict.
Indeed, Russia's aggression has managed to shift two previously
non-aligned nations, Finland and Sweden, into joining NATO -- bringing
serious firepower to the alliance's Northern Flank.

In the Middle East, the ongoing spillover from Israel vs Hamas and
Yemen, including a mass Iranian missile/drone strike in April and an
ongoing Houthi anti-shipping campaign in the Red Sea has also focused
minds on the need for credible air defence. Meanwhile, [[in
**Asia**]{.mark}-Pacific, [China's sabre rattling around **Taiwan**
and]{.mark}]{.underline} its wider [territorial
[claims]{.mark}]{.underline}, coupled [[with]{.mark} military
**[modernisation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and a slowing economy [has
seen]{.underline} US Chinese [relations deteriorate]{.underline}, with
Washington now keen to assemble a group-of like-minded nations to
balance Beijing's ambitions -- even if some of this may be symbolic
compared to the US's overwhelming military power. International defence
agreements and programmes such as AUKUS and GCAP thus play a part in
connecting European nations such as the UK and Italy with Asia-Pacific
security.

Domestic politics and air power

The RAF is looking to its next-generation Tempest fighter - part of the
wider GCAP/FCAS effort. (BAE Systems)

Domestic politics and elections this year are also set to influence the
debate and discussion about defence, rearmament and air power's role in
this. In the UK, a new government has already hit the ground running in
terms of defence, announcing it aims to reset defence and security
relations with Europe, commit to the 2.5% defence spending increase and
conduct a strategic defence review in the next 12 months. Buried in this
too, is an ambition to reform MoD procurement and deliver more value for
money for the taxpayer.

Meanwhile, the prospect of a second Donald Trump administration in the
US is also focusing minds on both sides of the Atlantic, given his
threats to disengage from NATO and its so-called \'freeloaders\'. As
this in being written, a NATO Summit is taking place and European
leaders are already pledging to boost defence spending. While there is
understandably much rhetoric about the dangers that a Trump Presidency
may pose to NATO's cohesion, privately some experts concede that this
also may provide an historic opportunity for Europe to finally gets its
act together on defence cooperation.

Finally, technology too is accelerating, driven by innovation stemming
from conflict and the wider commercial world - whether it is in
[[**AI**, **drones** or **spaceflight**, present]{.underline}]{.mark}ing
[new opportunities and **[challenges]{.mark}** for air]{.underline} and
space [practitioners]{.underline}. How will, AI, for example change the
battlespace? Will drones replace crewed combat aircraft? How many
collaborative combat aircraft (CCA) or 'loyal wingman' are actually
needed?

And, as modern nations become ever more dependent on space, how can
[[air]{.underline}]{.mark}/space forces [[protect]{.underline}]{.mark}
and [defence]{.underline} this [[critical
**infrastructure**]{.underline}]{.mark} in orbit? Only earlier this
year, for example, the US warned that Russia had launched a
nuclear-capable counter-space weapon into orbit, potentially altering
the balance of power in this new domain.

Conference themes

What can NATO learn from new members like Sweden and Finland? (Saab)

All the above then, are set to feed into this year's GASCC agenda --
which takes as its theme this year 'Deterrence, Interoperability and
Integration'. While deterrence, for many, conjures up images of nuclear
missiles it is important to remember that the wider use of deterrence
includes conventional forces - and being strong enough to survive,
inflict more cost to the enemy and eventually win. 'Fly, fighter and
Win' then, is the new mantra. Part of
**[[deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}** in this case can be the simply be
[demonstrating the ability to **survive** and [not make]{.mark} any
[enemy **worth trying**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Said Air Vice Marshal Tim
Jones, Assistant Chief of the Defence Staff (Capability and Force
Design), RAF: "We chose deterrence possibly just to say out loud what
everybody else was thinking."

**[[Air power]{.underline}]{.mark}**, he observes, is [[particularly
**relevant** in deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark} in [being able
[to]{.mark} quickly **[break]{.mark}** or interrupt [the **escalation**
ladder]{.mark}]{.underline} -and thus [deterring]{.underline} an
[adversary from further escalation]{.underline}. "It has a unique place
that [air power]{.underline} in being [able to send [a]{.mark} very
**[quick message]{.mark}**]{.underline}". One example of that might
arguably be the combined Iranian drone/missile strike on Israel in
April, that saw Israel, US, UK and even Arab nation coordinate air
defences to prevent major loss of life in what was a state-on-state
attack.

[Another benefit]{.underline} of air power as related to deterrence,
says AVM Jones, [is]{.underline} that of
**[[attribution]{.underline}]{.mark}**, particularly [[in]{.mark} this
era of **[hybrid war]{.mark}**fare]{.underline}. By virtue of its
[ability to]{.underline} '[see over the horizon']{.underline} whether by
spyplanes, satellites or drones, [air]{.underline} and space [power is
able to **[reveal]{.mark}**]{.underline} [the true
**[intentions]{.mark}** and dispositions]{.underline} of adversary
forces, [[attribute '**grey zone**' behaviour]{.mark} and
bring]{.underline} it [into the **open**.]{.underline}

On survival and resilience, one highlight of the conference is expected
to be a session from the Nordic [[**air** forces]{.underline}]{.mark} --
who will share their lessons on Agile Combat Employment (ACE) that are
now being rapidly shared across other NATO members -- [[boost]{.mark}ing
[**interoperability** and combat power]{.mark} across]{.underline} the
**[alliance]{.underline}**. Says AVM Jones: "One of the obvious ways in
which we tend to look to the Nordic chiefs for inspiration is in terms
of ACE. Interestingly, as a feature of deterrence the ability to get out
of the way of the threat and therefore make it not worth the effort
trying, is a key part of what we are rediscovering in terms of the way
we operate, but also the operational mindset that flows through that as
well."

### Airpower\-\--AT: Terror\-\--2AC

#### Terrorism [isn't]{.underline} existential.

3\. The terrorist mastermind. A close cousin to the nuclear rogue is the
terrorist mastermind, busily concocting elaborate and highly destructive
plots to bring the world to its knees. People like
[[Osama]{.underline}]{.mark} bin Laden [and]{.underline} Islamic State
leader [Abu]{.underline} Bakr al-Baghdadi have [[made
**extravagant**]{.mark} and **dire [threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but
the good news is that [[they]{.mark}'ve [never come close to toppling
a]{.mark} foreign [government, winning millions]{.mark} of followers,
[or threatening]{.mark} our way of [life]{.mark}]{.underline}. I don't
deny that some terrorist groups have devised and executed successful
assaults --- of which the 9/11 attacks were by far the most damaging ---
but a word like "mastermind" conjures up images of Dr. Evil-style
villains who will inevitably outwit our feeble efforts to stop them and
unleash fearsome destruction on an innocent world. In fact, as John
Mueller and others keep reminding us, [**the vast [majority]{.mark}** of
contemporary terrorists [are **incompetent**]{.mark}
**misfits**]{.underline}, and [[even the]{.underline}]{.mark} very
[[best]{.mark} of them **fall well [short of]{.mark} evil
[genius]{.mark}**[. They]{.mark}]{.underline} can and do [[stage
**small**]{.mark}**-scale [attacks]{.mark}** [that cause
**modest**]{.mark} **amounts of [harm]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but
[they]{.underline} have [repeatedly show]{.underline}n
[themselves]{.underline} to be [[**incapable** of **orchestrating
complicated op**]{.mark}eration**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} that could
actually bring a stable country to its knees. There have been serious
terrorist attacks in Boston; London; Paris; Brussels; Orlando, Florida;
and several other places in recent years, for example --- yet in each
case, these societies proved resilient, and they are thriving again
today. Or just look at New York City, which suffered the worst single
attack ever and has since fully recovered. Terrorism is a problem, the
lives lost to it are an unfortunate tragedy, and those who employ it are
dangerous criminals. [A few terrorists are moderately clever; most are
not. None rises to the level of a "mastermind," and **[none
poses]{.mark} an [existential threat]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Reporters,
pundits, and speechwriters should drop this term from their lexicon,
because this particular animal doesn't exist. Fortunately.

### Airpower\-\--China\-\--2AC

#### Airpower is key to [overtaking]{.underline} Chinese A2/AD. 

**Bowie '23** \[Christopher; March 10; Non-resident Senior Fellow at the
Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, Former Associate
Director of the National Security Studies program at RAND; Center for
Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, "Air Power Metamorphosis Rethinking
Air Force Combat Force Modernization,"
https://csbaonline.org/research/publications/air-power-metamorphosis-rethinking-air-force-combat-force-modernization\]

This report aims to stimulate a discussion and debate over current Air
Force modernization plans for its combat force. Given the [[**central**
role of **air power**]{.mark} in future joint operations]{.underline}
and the threats posed by our primary strategic competitor, a
[**[change]{.mark}** in direction [appears **necessary** to
maintain]{.mark} an [**effective** deterrent]{.mark} and
warfighting]{.underline} force. The suggestions outlined in this study
would yield a significantly different future combat force, one that
appears better suited to the nation's geo-strategic needs while also
offering significant operational, logistical, and budgetary advantages.

[**Changes** in the **geo-strategic** environment are **driving** the
need to **alter course**]{.underline}. U.S. national security strategy
has identified [**China** as the United States' **primary** strategic
competitor]{.underline}, particularly after Russia's disastrous
incursion into Ukraine, which has shattered assumptions of the combat
effectiveness of its conventional military. For the past three decades,
[**[Chinese]{.mark}** leadership has [watched]{.mark} the
**[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates **[project power]{.mark}** in
regional conflicts [using]{.mark}]{.underline} a highly successful
concept of operations---land-based and carrier-based fighters to gain
[**control** of the **[air]{.mark}**]{.underline}, airlift and sealift
to deploy ground forces, and fighters and bombers to strike from the air
in coordination with ground force thrusts. The People's Liberation Army
(PLA) has responded with a set of anti-access/area denial capabilities
aimed at disrupting this approach. It is fielding a growing force of
ballistic and cruise missiles combined with medium bombers and naval
combatants to strike American and allied forward airfields, aircraft
carriers, and surface ships. In addition, [**[China]{.mark}** is
[deploying advanced **air defenses**]{.mark} to defend against U.S.
**air power** and [fielding]{.mark} advanced **[fighters]{.mark}**
equipped with **long-range** missiles [to attack]{.mark} our
**[refueling]{.mark}**]{.underline} and intelligence aircraft. [This mix
of capabilities **[threatens]{.mark}** to undermine [U.S. **power
projection**]{.mark}]{.underline} capabilities [[and
**deterrence**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Western Pacific.

[[Given]{.mark} the [**vast** distances and **limited
basing**]{.mark}]{.underline} options in the Pacific, the
[**[A]{.mark}**ir **[F]{.mark}**orce [**must** increase]{.mark} its
[**long-range** capabilities]{.mark} to enable operations from a
**wider** array of bases]{.underline} located at greater ranges from
Chinese offensive systems. This study outlines a proposed reshaping to
increase long-range power projection capabilities in a "worst case"
scenario; Air Force budgets remain flat over the next 15 years and all
force structure trades take place within the Air Force. Increases in Air
Force funding---either from larger defense budgets or an increase in the
Air Force's share of the budget---would support a wider range of options
and reduce risk.

### Airpower\-\--AT: Extends Wars\-\--2AC

#### Airpower [shortens]{.underline} wars.

**Pietrucha '15** \[Mike; August 19; retired colonel in the United
States Air Force; War on the Rocks, "Airpower may not win wars, but it
sure doesn't lose them,"
https://warontherocks.com/2015/08/airpower-may-not-win-wars-but-it-sure-doesnt-lose-them\]

[[**Airpower** was]{.mark} an [**essential** supporting force in
**Europe**]{.mark}]{.underline}, but it was the supported force in the
Pacific. [The story of]{.underline} the
**[[Pacific]{.underline}]{.mark}** War [is one of]{.underline} naval and
**[airpower]{.underline}** used in a campaign [[designed to
**isolate**]{.mark} Japan]{.underline}, \[**[degrade]{.underline}**\]
~~cripple~~ its [logistics]{.underline}, and eventually advance airbases
for direct air attack against Japan. [Airfields were]{.underline} the
[key terrain]{.underline} in the Pacific. Every operation revolved
around them. The maritime interdiction campaign, conducted primarily by
submarines and aircraft, defeated imperial Japan and starved its forces
into submission. The aerial delivery of two atomic bombs in August 1945
punctuated the reality that [Japan was]{.underline} completely
[**supine** before American airpower]{.underline}. Airpower alone did
not win [the]{.underline} Pacific [[War]{.underline}]{.mark}, but it
[[was **terminated** by]{.mark} [air]{.mark}power]{.underline} without a
single infantryman having to dash ashore on Japan's main islands.

The Pacific War settled that [[airpower]{.mark} could **[end]{.mark}
wars**[, and]{.mark}]{.underline} soon after proved that it could [also
help **[avoid war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. When the Soviets closed rail
and road routes to West Berlin there was no ground option short of war
to prevent starvation. Instead, the Allies conducted a massive airlift
that supplied Berlin for a year. The Berlin airlift expanded the art of
the possible, and airpower's ability to deliver humanitarian aid remains
a key foreign policy tool today.

The Korean War marked the beginning of a 40-year trend during which
ground forces held terrain while air forces conducted deep operations
and interdicted enemy supply lines. Airpower enabled MacArthur to
justify the daring Inch'on landing to a wary president on the assurance
that invested forces would be "completely self-sustaining because of our
absolute air and naval supremacy." This conflict also marked the last
time any deployed U.S. forces were subject to attack by hostile
aircraft. When America's political objectives must be earned with
military power, [air superiority is a]{.underline} necessary
[**prerequisite** to joint success.]{.underline}

The Limits of Landpower

The war in Vietnam was marked by French and American use of troops to
pacify populations. [**Vietnam** would reveal]{.underline} the
[Achilles' heel of]{.underline} conventional [landpower]{.underline}:
Once spilt, blood shed abroad imposes new political imperatives and
begins eroding public support. Vietnam would not be the last time an
enemy force simply outlasted the United States to achieve a strategic
victory. For the North Vietnamese, **[[landpower]{.underline}]{.mark}**
was an effective military option that the United States [could only
[apply]{.mark} at **[extreme cost]{.mark}** in blood, treasure
and]{.underline} popular [support]{.underline}.

[Landpower in [Vietnam]{.mark}]{.underline}, even when well supported
from the air, [[was **insufficient**]{.mark} to achieve
U.S]{.underline}. policy [aims]{.underline}. Even when poorly applied,
as [in Operation **[Rolling Thunder]{.mark}**, airpower
[provided]{.mark}]{.underline} escalation and [**[reprisal]{.mark}**
options that were]{.underline} otherwise [unavailable]{.underline}.
Applied in earnest [in 1972, **[aerial mining]{.mark}** of North
Vietnamese]{.underline} ports [[shut down]{.underline}]{.mark} all
seaborne **[[commerce]{.underline}]{.mark}**, while [Operation
Linebacker]{.underline} I [shattered]{.underline} the People's Army of
[North Vietnam's **logistics** and offensive capacity]{.underline} ---
effectively ending North Vietnamese hopes of a unilateral military
resolution. By October 1972, the United States had negotiated a
framework it could agree to for conflict termination, but it would take
Operation Linebacker II in December 1972 to demonstrate sufficient U.S.
resolve for President Nguyen Van Thieu of South Vietnam.

After Vietnam, air and naval power became the instruments of first
resort when military force was required. Operation Nickel Grass in 1973
kept the Israeli Defense Force in the fight against Soviet-backed
Egyptian and Syrian forces in the face of mounting losses. Operation
Eldorado Canyon struck Libya in response to terrorist attacks,
Operations Just Cause in Panama and Urgent Fury in Grenada were
spearheaded with airborne assault. Time and time again, U.S. air and
naval forces constituted a preferred option for deterring an enemy, and
the rapid movement of aviation was used to punctuate American commitment
to our allies around the globe.

The Modern Case: Desert Storm and Aftermath

"Both psychologically and physically, it must have been terrible to be
on the receiving end of Coalition air power. From the start of the war
the dilemma facing Iraqi troops was acute: they got hit if they stayed
in their fortifications, they got hit if they fired their heavy guns,
they got hit if they moved, and they got hit by Iraqi execution squads
if they tried to cross over to us ... It was clear that the 38-day air
campaign had done far more damage than we had imagined. There was little
fight left in the Iraqi divisions facing our troops. Indeed, they must
have realized the war was over."

--- Gen. Khaled bin Sultan, Commander, KSA Defense Force

[Operation **[Desert Storm]{.mark}** highlighted [airpower]{.mark}
when]{.underline} coalition air [forces [dismantled Iraq]{.mark}'s
military [in **40 days**]{.mark}]{.underline} of around-the-clock
attack. Ground forces remained essential because [airpower prevented
Iraqi forces from moving and necessitated]{.underline} that [they be
pushed out]{.underline} of Kuwait. The punishment imposed from the air
ensured that when the 100-hour ground maneuver did occur, coalition land
forces faced an enemy force that was out of communication, pinned down,
cut off, already well below fighting strength, and totally ignorant of
enemy force disposition. The victory played out exactly as the designers
of the AirLand Battle doctrine had hoped it would, with air setting up
highly lopsided battles that mechanized ground forces could quickly
dominate.

[The real **[milestone]{.mark}** for airpower [was]{.mark}]{.underline}
the aftermath of [the **[Gulf War]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The coalition
that gathered to push Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait had no appetite for
an occupation of Iraq (wisely, as it turned out) but did not want to
allow him to mass forces to the north or south to threaten regional
neighbors or commit domestic atrocities. Operation Provide Comfort
started out as a humanitarian operation to support Kurdish refugees and
morphed into an air containment effort, where airpower was used to
monitor and constrain an Iraqi army still able to slaughter civilians.
The no-fly zone (NFZ) in the north kept Iraqi forces from the "green
zone," allowing establishment of a Kurdish autonomous region. The NFZ in
the south overlaid a "no-drive zone" to prevent large-scale repression
against Iraq's Shia population around Basra --- too late for many. In
effect, the United States relied on airpower to frustrate a rogue
nation's capacity to threaten neighbors, and to give comfort and
protection to vulnerable populations.

This was [repeated in the **[Balkans]{.mark}**, without]{.underline}
American or NATO [ground forces. Operation [**Deny Flight**
enforced]{.mark}]{.underline} a [NFZ over Bosnia, carried out air
support]{.underline} missions for the United Nations Protection Force,
[and protected]{.underline} the [[**humanitarian relief**
effort]{.mark}]{.underline} of Operation Provide Promise. It was capped
by Operation Deliberate Force, which brought about conflict termination
in Bosnia and forced the Serbs to the bargaining table at Dayton. Four
years later [Operation [Allied Force demonstrated
**unambiguously**]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[airpower could win]{.mark}
a war]{.underline} --- successfully achieving political objectives
through force, under admittedly limited conditions.

Nearly a decade of NFZ enforcement, punctuated occasionally with
airstrikes, generated no U.S. combat casualties and no readiness crisis,
and didn't jeopardize the ability of the United States to meet defense
obligations elsewhere. Neither Bosnia nor Kosovo descended into civil
war, and Saddam Hussein remained relatively in check. While substantial
damage was done to Serbian infrastructure in Operation Allied Force, the
damage did not lead to a government collapse, and the relatively few
civilian casualties, while tragic, never undermined the execution of
NATO airstrikes. [Airpower [provided **flexible**]{.mark} policy
[options]{.mark} that [allowed]{.mark} the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [to **[adjust]{.mark}** rapidly [to]{.mark}
changing [conditions]{.mark} and force]{.underline} the Milosevich
government [to **end** the conflict]{.underline} on NATO terms. All this
was accomplished without the involvement of ground forces, within
existing basing constraints, and comparatively cheaply with no long-term
expenditure for wounded veterans.

Iraq and Afghanistan: Unpalatable Outcomes

[In]{.underline} the immediate [aftermath of **[September
11]{.mark}**]{.underline}, 2001, [the [country]{.mark}]{.underline}
again [[turned to **air**]{.mark}**power**]{.underline}. Operation
Enduring Freedom began four weeks after the attacks. The effort to
target Al Qaeda and the Taliban forces combined airpower, indigenous
Northern Alliance forces, and U.S. special operations forces, along with
regular soldiers and Marines providing security for forward airfields.
[By the end of **November**, the [Taliban
**evacuated**]{.mark}]{.underline} their last stronghold, ceding power
in Afghanistan, and a week later they abandoned their last Afghan border
town. The Taliban government of Afghanistan was gone, paving the way for
the installation of an interim government.

With the arrival of the United Nations-authorized International Security
and Assistance Force (ISAF) a cycle began where security and
reconstruction efforts needed to show rapid progress. Frustrated
expectations became justification for more combat forces, combat
support, and contractors. NATO fueled the effort with money, enabling
corruption, and the presence of ISAF reinvigorated an agile enemy that
stubbornly resisted "defeat." Thirteen years later, conditions in
Afghanistan are no better and arguably worse than they were in December
2001, despite a substantial ground effort that cost the United States
20,000 combat casualties and over \$700 billion and counting.

[In **[Iraq]{.mark}**, the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [[moved]{.mark} from]{.underline} an effective,
[**air**-only containment policy [to]{.mark}]{.underline} a
[**[ground]{.mark}** invasion]{.underline} and occupation. [The
[outcome]{.mark} [has been]{.mark} intensely
**[unfavorable]{.mark}**]{.underline} for the United States; even a long
occupation and substantial training effort was [**unable** to
generate]{.underline} a policy [success]{.underline}. Today, Iraq is a
de facto Iranian client, unable to defend its own territory, and a
breeding ground for extremists who have been honed by constant conflict.
Twelve years after the invasion, conditions in Iraq and the region are
not only worse, but much worse. In place of a relatively inexpensive
containment strategy --- the annual cost for enforcing both NFZs over
Iraq was between \$1--2 billion annually --- the United States engaged
in a prolonged occupation that resulted in over 35,000 U.S. casualties
(almost 5,000 of them fatal), cost more than \$800 billion, and left
Iraq unable to provide its own security. In addition, combat operations
in Iraq created a cadre of seasoned fighters that dispersed throughout
the region, with catastrophic effects in Yemen and Syria. Until recently
in these conflicts, airpower was relegated to a supporting role,
providing aerial fires in support of a strategy that sought to engage
the enemy in close combat, rather than keeping him at arm's length.

### Airpower\-\--2AC/1AR \-\--Ext

#### Air power enables [proportional]{.underline} de-escalation [below]{.underline} the nuclear level. 

**Singh '22** \[Jasjit; September 2022; Executive Director of SelectUSA,
former Senior Director at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; Caps India,
"Some Aspects of our Wars in Future,"
https://capsindia.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Jasjit-Singh-1.pdf\]

In spite of the above factor, a largely stalemated war would leave us
with the problem of how to impose our will on the enemy. Hence, [[the
need to apply]{.mark} **punitive [force]{.mark}**]{.underline} for
political-military effects [but [with]{.mark} significantly [**reduced**
risk of **escalation**]{.mark} to nuclear]{.underline} levels would
remain. this [can be **[achieved by]{.mark}** calibrated use of **[air
power]{.mark}**]{.underline} and naval forces.

Sub-Conventional Wars: Proxy wars at the sub conventional levels,
especially through religious extremist/jihadi terrorism, present another
type of milieu, especially where such a war is being waged from a
sanctuary state possessing nuclear weapons and a competent conventional
military power. this is the type of war that the superpowers with
eyeball-to-eyeball military confrontation and a stockpile of over 66,000
nuclear weapons resorted to in third countries during the Cold War,
making sure that a direct military confrontation was avoided.

Political Constraints: It needs to be recognised that regardless of the
type of war we get engaged in, political constraints would be an
inevitable and important factor in the employment of military forces. It
would be difficult to forecast such constraints in advance since the
leadership in a parliamentary democracy is subject to many pressures and
changes. Political constraints of different types and extent were a
regular factor in every war India had to fight in the past. Some of them
appear to have been conditioned by debatable reasons. For example, the
restriction on the Indian Air Force (IAF) from taking offensive action
against the solitary fighter squadron in east Pakistan appears to have
had no rational reason though it was justified later that such an attack
would alienate the population \[even when the Chief of the Air Staff
(CAS) had clearly affirmed to the Prime Minister (PM) and Defence
Minister that civilian targets would not be attacked by the IAF\]. this
forced the IAF to remain on the defensive which in the absence of
adequate radar cover became inadequate and we lost a large number of
aircraft and some lives on the ground. the presence of nuclear weapons
with both our major adversaries is likely to increase rather than
decrease political constraints, and is more difficult to predict.

In view of the foregoing, it is important that a balance of military
necessity and political compulsions and aims is achieved through regular
dialogue between the political and military leadership on a continuing
basis.3 In a way, the establishment of the Defence Committee of the
Cabinet (DCC) and the location of the Chiefs of Staff Committee (CoSC)
in the Cabinet Secretariat (with a Military Wing to provide secretarial
support) was the logical institutional arrangement which has not been
available since the mid-1950s. It is ironic that the Cabinet has an
Accommodation Committee but not a Defence Committee! the Cabinet
Committee on Security (CCS) is useful, but given the range and
priorities of security challenges, it can hardly provide the
institutional dialogue necessary between the political and military
leadership for the complex nature of future wars and development of our
military capabilities toward the desired goals.

Reaction of Dominant Powers: Received unquestioned wisdom states that
the international community, especially the dominant powers, would
inevitably intervene in any war we get involved in.4 But the reality is
that this may not necessarily happen except when they perceive the
likelihood of the situation moving toward a nuclear exchange. Hence,
much will depend upon the circumstances of the war, the way we fight
that war, and our diplomatic efforts and posture on a continuing basis
before, during and after the war. Here we face another disjunction in
terms of the gap between the military leadership and our diplomats,
essentially because the Ministry of Defence has, over time, become an
unnecessary buffer between the military and Ministry of external Affairs
for this purpose. Unfortunately, we see the gap between the soldiers and
diplomats even in most of our embassies.

Legitimacy for Application of Military Power: one of the most important
factors that now affect the use of military power in wars is the purpose
for which it is applied and whether this is seen as legitimate or not.
this is not merely the issue of a just war; rather, it implies that the
legitimacy would depend upon how domestic opinion sees the war. this
legitimacy is easier to achieve when reacting to an aggression (nuclear
or conventional military attack), as we have seen in the past. But if
India wants to initiate a punitive war (even in retaliation to a major
terrorist attack), it would have to pay serious attention to the issue
of legitimacy and the extent of this may well also influence the
reactions of at least a part of the international community. Here the
media and elites dealing with public information play a critical role in
generating the legitimacy of a particular political-military vector or
undermining it.

[Military **[tech]{.mark}nology** [has been
advancing]{.mark}]{.underline} almost
**[[dramatically]{.underline}]{.mark}** in recent decades. Superior
technology, from the days when the stirrup and gunpowder were invented
as the then Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) has historically been a
major factor in warfare. But mere possession of superior technology
weapons and equipment does not necessarily provide success in wars. Some
issues that need consideration are:

Empirical evidence in history clearly proves that superior technology by
itself does not lead to victory; rather, [it [is force **employment**
that tilts]{.mark}]{.underline} the [balance [between victory and
defeat]{.mark}]{.underline}. Force employment obviously also implies how
Empirical evidence in history clearly proves that superior technology by
itself does not lead to victory; rather, it is force employment that
tilts the balance between victory and defeat. technology is synergised
with strategy and tactics in relation to those of the enemy. Here the
scope for a false sense of superiority/inferiority by either side, going
by what technology promises (rather than how it is employed), can have a
significant impact on the outcome. During the 1965 War, the Indian Army
and Air Force were highly sensitive to the higher technology weapons and
equipment acquired from the United States and absorbed by the Pakistan
military. But during the war, after the initial setbacks, the Indian
Army and Air Force succeeded in achieving an unambiguous victory over
the higher technology armed Pakistan military forces although they
fought well.

[Operational impact of technological advancement]{.underline} requires
rigorous and objective assessment. the trends in technology and warfare
are inexorably moving toward non-contact warfare. their effects are most
obvious in the technology intensive components of military power. Hence,
[[**air** dominance]{.underline}]{.mark}, both in the air-to-air as well
as the air-to-surface dimensions [[provides]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[**capability** for air]{.mark} forces [to play a **crucial role** in
warfare. Precision strike]{.mark}]{.underline} (which rests crucially on
accurate and timely air intelligence) at increasingly longer ranges
[[provides **capabilities**]{.mark} that were [not possible
earlier]{.mark}]{.underline}. Similarly, naval power is becoming an
important factor in warfare because of the expansion of its operational
effectiveness due to modern technology. this is not to suggest that
naval forces would replace the land forces in their primary role with
"boots on the ground." Here we need to be very careful in drawing the
right lessons from wars in the past two decades which have been fought
with the heavy advantage of technology, **[[air
power]{.underline}]{.mark}** and naval capabilities on one side only,
[[providing]{.mark} dramatic [**advantages** and freedom of
action]{.mark}]{.underline} with air and naval dominance. However, in
our case[, air dominance would have to be **contested**]{.underline}

\<\<TEXT CONDENSED, NONE OMITTED\>\>

Preserving this critical U.S. advantage is essential but not inevitable.
Under development for more than a decade, the Next Generation Air
Dominance (NGAD) Family of Systems will serve as the foundation of
future U.S. air superiority. The NGAD portfolio will probably include a
sixth-generation air superiority fighter, a network of partnered
uncrewed Collaborative Combat Aircraft, and a collection of cutting-edge
technologies optimized for both air-to-air and air-to-ground combat. The
NGAD fighter, likely crewed, will replace the F-22 Raptor, which
originated at the end of the Cold War, before the widespread use of
modular architectures, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and the latest
munitions and electronic technologies. The plane will be the first U.S.
air superiority fighter designed for Pacific-wide combat operations,
which require greater range and payload than the F-22 or other available
fighters. The Next Generation Adaptive Propulsion program could provide
the plane with adaptive cycle engines that could automatically switch
between high-performance thrust-maximizing and fuel-efficient
range-extending flight. Greater use of composite materials will also
boost the plane's range by making it lighter. Each NGAD fighter
reportedly will control about half a dozen CCA drones. Unlike the
largely autonomous drones envisaged by the Pentagon's Replicator
initiative, the auxiliary CCA systems will primarily support and extend
the crewed fighter missions, operating as human-machine teams. Though
much of the work on the NGAD suite remains classified to prevent China
and other malign actors from exposing their technologies through cyber
espionage, these "loyal wingman platforms" will likely operate both
semi-autonomously and as "drone swarms" to overwhelm adversaries.
Equipped with modular packages, the multi-mission drones will provide
critical capabilities such as counter-EW, sensor fusion, diversionary
decoys, and air defense suppression.

**overcome**]{.mark} adversaries'
**[countermeasures]{.mark}**]{.underline} as they become evident. Should
China or some other adversary unexpectedly display a novel anti-air
weapon, AI-empowered human-machine teams would quickly negate them.

From a longer-term perspective, the [crewed plane and the uncrewed
drones will be upgradable]{.underline} through a spiral development
process in which their open architectures will be [continuously
**enriched** with new capabilities]{.underline} as they are developed.

[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} capability could [prove [**critical** to
outmatch **China**]{.mark}, which is]{.underline} also [applying **AI**
advances to its military]{.underline} forces and developing a NGAD-like
fighter suite. Seeing their evident advantages, other European and Asian
countries are also planning to develop sixth-generation planes.

Ironically, the greatest immediate threat to the NGAP is not China but
the U.S. Congress, which enacted the 2023 Fiscal Responsibility Act and
repeated continuous resolutions. Whereas the latter compels the military
to make arbitrary cuts, the latter makes sustaining long-term
cutting-edge programs onerous.

Suppliers need sustained funding to invest in the people and projects
required for the research and development of large, forward-looking
technological superiority programs like the NGAD.

Air Force leaders have warned that congressional budget cuts might force
it to make "tough decisions" on NGAD. While Congress has dealt the Air
Force a bad hand, the Air Force cannot pull the plug on this critical
initiative.

Establishing a "National Land-Based Deterrence Fund" would, along with
the National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund, would help preserve both
indispensable strategic deterrent forces along with critical
conventional capabilities.

As the Strategic Posture Commission report noted, a vital means of
avoiding a nuclear war is to enhance U.S. conventional capabilities.

Without the NGAD, other platforms, such as **[[older

**AK = Alaska, MR = Micro reactors**

[Energy system changes are similarly driving a strong tide of interest
in **new energy options** for **[AK]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As a fossil
fuel-producing state with high per capita consumption, Alaska's energy
shift is already observed, for example, with the Prudhoe Bay [[oil
field]{.mark} that is now **[in decline]{.mark}**]{.underline} (see
Appendix A). [[Natural gas]{.underline}]{.mark} has maintained output
for on-shore production, while [off-shore has]{.underline} [[declined
by]{.mark} more than a **[factor of three]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Ibid.). Meanwhile, [[only **one coal mine**]{.mark} is in
operation]{.underline}. While many [rural communities using
microgrids]{.underline} continue to [rely on **diesel**]{.underline},
[renewable energy sources have **gained shares** recently]{.underline}
in the energy mix. [**[Interest in MRs]{.mark}**]{.underline} for remote
locations [[began]{.underline}]{.mark} in the early 2000s[,]{.underline}
[but the technology and regulatory processes were **not in
place**]{.underline}. [Since that time, the **[technology]{.mark} has
[advanced]{.mark}** and several [users]{.mark} from local utilities and
the UA]{.underline}, [[are **taking**]{.mark}
**[interest]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The state appears receptive, as the
AK legislature passed nuclear friendly legislation (Senate Bill 177) in
May 2022. Eielson Air Force Base was also announced as a site for a MR
project. For more details on historical and current energy trends within
the state, see Appendix A.

[[Alaska is]{.mark} also [home to **energy-intensive
industries**]{.mark}. A [market assessment]{.mark} of Interior regions
of AK]{.underline} (see Appendix C) [[details]{.mark} the
economy]{.underline}, relevant industries, and background for state
regions that include the Fairbanks North Star Borough, Denali Borough,
Yukon -Koyukuk Census Area, and the Southeast Fairbanks Census Area.
[The assessment then focuses on **core energy-consuming** industries in
AK, including: the military]{.underline} (four defense installations),
[hard **rock mining** for coal and gold]{.underline}, the [oil and gas
sector]{.underline} (including Trans-Alaska Pipeline System and three
refineries) and [higher education]{.underline} (UA system consisting of
three campuses). Researchers analyze each industry and [recognize that
**[cost]{.mark}** [and **availability**]{.mark} of
energy]{.underline}---[both heat and power---[are
**intrinsically**]{.mark} **[tied to]{.mark} economic [growth]{.mark}**
in the region]{.underline}. [However, energy in the region is at a
**crossroads** with decarbonization and fuel availability]{.underline}.
How [[energy choices]{.mark} take shape within the state could
substantially [impact]{.mark} **economic [opportunities]{.mark}** and
growth, **[energy security]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark} **energy
[burdens]{.mark}** in the area]{.underline}.

Specific to the Interior Alaska mining industry assessment (see Appendix
C), context is provided for energy production in terms of the regulated
industry and the Golden Valley Electric Association service area,
contracting with independent power producers and non-electric
applications for heat. A case study is presented for hard rock mining
that provides an example of large-scale energy users (e.g., coal, gold
mining), whereby the mines may act as both energy consumers and
suppliers. The mining companies are examined from the perspective of ESG
goals, drivers, and detractors for alternative energy adoption,
highlighting the possible economic trade-offs (e.g., job losses, lower
revenues) associated with shifts to new energy technology. Value-added
product development (i.e., manufacturing, processing) in Alaska is
identified as key to mines and the regional economy, however the
feasibility is limited by energy cost.

[[for]{.mark} **[baseload power replacement]{.mark}**]{.underline} due
to [reduced reliance on coal, diminishing natural gas resources in the

Distributed systems are considered that can cogenerate heat for space
heating and industrial processes, be co-located with large energy users
to help moderate adoption of intermittent energy sources, and provide
mobility for future relocation to accommodate mine production cycles.
Implications for mines to disconnect from the grid and options to manage
system changes, such as use of a sleeved power purchase agreement for
grid-tied industrial users, are also explored[.]{.underline}

More targeted analysis of the coastal region around Nome, AK (see
Appendix A), then assesses the diversification potential for a
deep-water port, graphite mining and related economic prospects with
energy mix adaptations. The analysis finds that Nome is in the early
stages of constructing a deep-water port. [A [prospective]{.mark}
**[graphite mine]{.mark}**, if constructed, [would serve]{.mark} as
**[an important source]{.mark}** for a national graphite supply
chain]{.underline}. The study emphasizes how high energy prices and
limited fuel shipping months per year present a very strong case for
looking beyond diesel options. This study integrates historical and case
analysis with interviews of stakeholders from across sectors to shed
light on the background, feasibility, and perceived interest in emerging
economic development over the next 5--10 years around Nome. Increased

MINING IS RIPE FOR MICROREACTORS

[Experts estimate that mining accounts for]{.underline} between 4% and
[**7% of worldwide g**reen**h**ouse **g**as emissions and around **3.5%
of all energy** consumed]{.underline}. And yet, the [[mining industry is
**essential to meeting climate** ]{.mark}**change [goals]{.mark}**
[because it provides]{.mark}]{.underline} the [minerals such as lithium,
cobalt and **[r]{.mark}are-[e]{.mark}arth [e]{.mark}lement[s]{.mark}**
[necessary to]{.mark} produce batteries, wind turbines, solar panels,
nuclear reactors and other **[zero emissions
tech]{.mark}**nologies.]{.underline}

"We're recognizing that [[mining]{.underline}]{.mark} might be [[a
**ripe area** for]{.mark}]{.underline} use of these
[**[microreactors]{.mark}**," said David Shropshire, a nuclear energy
economist]{.underline} at INL. "[The [cost of]{.mark} getting the
[fossil fuel]{.mark} and storing it [is **really expensive**]{.mark}.
Fuel [shortages]{.mark} at the mine [due to **extreme weather**]{.mark}
are [another concern]{.mark}]{.underline}[."]{.mark}

Shropshire explores the economics of nuclear mining as part of the
INL-led Emerging Energy Markets Analysis initiative. The initiative is a
collaboration among INL, the University of Alaska, Boise State
University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of
Michigan, the University of Wyoming and the University of Utah. It helps
states and regions transition to clean energy technologies, including
nuclear energy.

[Microreactors could be a **good opportunity** for the mining
industry]{.underline}, said Halle Cogley, an INL intern who grew up in
five different mining towns. Her mother, father and brother still work
in the industry.

["A [lot of mines are **moving toward renewable energy**]{.mark} to cut
down on emissions, [but **solar and wind aren't**]{.mark} always
**[reliable]{.mark}**," she said. "A [microreactor]{.mark} could
**[solve those problems."]{.mark}**]{.underline}

ELECTRIFICATION

[The next generation of simple, reliable microreactors comes as the
mining [industry]{.mark} explores the benefits of **[replacing fossil
fuel-powered equipment]{.mark}** such as excavators and haul trucks
[with **electric alternatives**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Electric mining equipment [would]{.mark} not only **[reduce]{.mark}
fuel [costs]{.mark}** and **[emissions]{.mark}**, but also **maintenance
costs** and the **need for ventilation** in tunnels. Electrifying mines
would also **improve noise** and **air quality** for workers [and
help]{.mark} the mine **[meet environmental
regulations.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

"[[It's a **perfect storm**]{.underline}]{.mark}," Shropshire said. "[In
the mining industry, there's a general move toward electrification and
away from fossil fuels. And there's a **lot of interest** [in using
**microreactors to generate that electricity**]{.mark}."]{.underline}

#### SMR's are [key]{.underline} in the Arctic. [Compact size]{.underline}, [flexible construction]{.underline}, and [ease of transport]{.underline} enable them to [reduce energy costs]{.underline} of Alaskan communities.

1.3.1 Small and Modular

[While there are dozens of designs]{.underline} being proposed and
[under development for [SMRs]{.mark}, the [common denominator]{.mark}
among them]{.underline} all [[is]{.mark} their [**small size** and
**modularity in construction**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [**[Fewer]{.mark}
materials** and [**resources** related to]{.mark} the **construction**
and **[operation]{.mark}** of a SMR [are necessary]{.mark}]{.underline}.
In terms of human resources, the [SMR could [require **as little as 15
people** to operate]{.mark}, while larger power plants
require]{.underline} between 900 to **[1,400 people]{.underline}**
(Chitumbo 2019). At about one-third to one-fourth the size of a
traditional nuclear power plant (Figure 1-4), [[major components]{.mark}
of SMRs]{.underline}, such as the reactor vessel, steam supply and
cooling system, [are expected to be **[small enough to be factory
produced]{.mark}**. The reactor vessel itself will be compact enough to
be transported by boat, truck or railway]{.underline}. NuScale's SMR
measures 65 ft (19.8 m) tall and 9 ft (2.75 m) in diameter, and its
containment vessel measures 76 ft (23.2 m) by 15 ft (4.6 m) in diameter
(NuScale Power 2020b).

[[Modularity enables **efficient** and **consistent
production**]{.underline}]{.mark}, as well as decommissioning, [in a
controlled factory environment [as opposed to]{.mark} the **[variability
of]{.mark} an [outdoor construction]{.mark} site**]{.underline}.
Countries, particularly newcomers and **[[emerging nuclear
countries]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[can]{.mark} incrementally build
nuclear resources as it [introduces]{.mark} nuclear power. [SMRs]{.mark}
enable the **standardization** of components and design, creating
**economies of mass production**]{.underline}, rather than economies of
scale often sought in large nuclear power plants. "[[While
typical]{.mark} large [reactor projects]{.mark} can [take]{.mark} up to
[10 years or more]{.mark} to build, [SMRs]{.mark} should be able to be
[built in **far less time**]{.mark}]{.underline}, perhaps in as little
as three years" (Zabielski 2018). Theoretically, a multi-unit SMR
facility could be constructed on a staggered schedule, which would lower
the risk of cost and schedule overruns for each unit, allowing for
phased financing.

[The [compact nature]{.mark} of SMRs [make]{.mark}s [them **suitable for
remote locations**]{.mark}, where SMRs do **not require a large power
grid** and can be attached to other modules to increase emission-free
power supply.]{.underline} This is [especially relevant for countries
with smaller electrical grids]{.underline}, where SMRs would be
compatible with existing power grids or [where [SMRs would be]{.mark}
able to provide [an **off-grid alternative**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
**[Remote and rural areas]{.underline}** [often rely on diesel
generators]{.underline}, [although]{.underline} the cost of fuel and the
transportation of fuel can be [costly]{.underline}. "[[In remote
communities]{.mark}, [such as **Alaska**]{.mark}, [where]{.mark} the
[fuel]{.mark} to run generators [is **costly to deliver**]{.mark},
[electricity prices can be]{.mark} up to [**16 times higher**
than]{.mark} the [national average]{.mark} and can consume up to **half
the income** for a household]{.underline}," Caponiti explained (American
Nuclear Society 2020).

The **[F]{.underline}**ood and **[A]{.underline}**griculture
**[O]{.underline}**rganisation of the United Nations has
[advised]{.underline} that "**[the [sustainability of
fisheries]{.mark}]{.underline}** and aquaculture [is [a]{.mark}
fundamental]{.underline} [[condition for **food
security**]{.underline}]{.mark} and nutrition." [[With]{.mark} more
than]{.underline} [[3]{.mark} **[billion]{.mark}**]{.underline} people
[[dependent on fish]{.mark} as a]{.underline} [significant part
of]{.underline} their [diet [and]{.mark} with the world's
[population]{.mark} projected [to grow]{.mark}]{.underline} by 33% [by
2050]{.underline}, requiring production of 70% more food to meet demand,
[**[a threat to fish stocks]{.underline}** [is a threat to **global food
security**]{.underline}]{.mark}. With more than 50% of the world's
population living in coastal communities, 1.7 billion people living in
poverty in major fishing nations and given the World Food Program's
projected doubling of the number of people suffering from acute hunger
to 265 million, due to COVID-19, [the **sustainable**]{.underline}
[consumption of fish should be]{.underline} **[a global nutritional
priority]{.underline}**.

Sustainable seafood is a safer, healthier protein option

"Studies have found that switching proteins from red meat to seafood
reduces the risk of heart disease, cancer and diabetes, and
micronutrients like those found in wild-caught fish are important in
preventing prenatal and maternal mortality, growth retardation, child
mortality, cognitive deficits and reduced immune function," says
Jacqueline Savitz of Oceana. [[Fatty fish]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[help to [control]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[inflammation]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in the body,
[supporting]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[immunity]{.underline}**
[in]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[fight against]{.underline}]{.mark}
viruses such as **[[COVID]{.underline}]{.mark}**-19. Given recent
findings about Zoonotic (animal borne) diseases, sustainably sourced
fish is also a safer protein option. According to the FAIRR
collaborative investor network, the vast majority of emerging infectious
diseases in humans are transmitted from land animals due to conditions
such as "high stocking density, indoor confinement, chronic stress,
lowered immunity and live transport \[which\] create the perfect
environment for deadly diseases to mutate and spread rapidly."

Sustainable fisheries are better for the economy

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, global per capita
fish consumption reached a record of 20.5 kilograms per person in 2020,
presenting a tremendous economic opportunity for the 260 million people
worldwide whose livelihoods depend on the fisheries sector. Resilient
fish stocks and a healthy ocean environment are critical in the support
of these livelihoods. According to a 2018 article in the journal,
Science, rebuilding fisheries sustainably "could increase global fishing
yields by \~15 per cent and profits by \~80 per cent."

Seafood is also a cost-effective protein source. "When you look at how
much fish protein you get per dollar invested compared to all the other
animal proteins, fish is a good business decision. Wild seafood is a
truly renewable resource," says Savitz.

Sustainable fisheries are better for the environment

"Wild fisheries produce modest amounts of greenhouse gases and help to
support the marine environment whereas land-based agriculture is one of
the most significant drivers of climate change and habitat destruction,"
says Savitz. Sustainably managed fisheries also reduce the need for
clearing arable land, which is on the decline in both developed and
developing countries, and requires virtually no freshwater.

"Further, unlike other protein sources, sustainable fishing does not
pose a biodiversity risk," continues Savitz. "On land, you might have to
cut down a biodiverse forest to raise livestock. Sustainable fisheries
are actually aligned with biodiversity. [[When **sustainably**
managed]{.underline}, [seafood]{.underline} ]{.mark}[populations
**[rebound]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and abundance
**increases**]{.underline}. There are dozens of examples of this around
the world, but you do not need to look any further than the U.S. haddock
fishery, which was in dire straights until it was properly managed.
Norway's herring and [**[Arctic cod populations]{.underline}**
[are]{.underline}]{.mark} two other [[examples]{.mark}."]{.underline}

With COVID-19, there has been warranted concern around whether countries
will be able to meet their Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.

Sustainable fisheries are at the core of SDG 14 -- Conserve and
sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable
development. Sustainable fishing practices also directly contribute to
eight other Sustainable Development Goals: SDG 1 -- No Poverty, SDG 2 --
Zero Hunger, SDG 3 -- Good Health and Well-being, SDG 5 -- Gender
Equality, SDG 8 -- Decent Work and Economic Growth, SDG 10 -- Reduced
Inequalities, SDG 12 -- Responsible Production and Consumption and SDG
13 -- Climate Action.

"[[Restoring]{.underline}]{.mark} ocean [[fisheries
addresses]{.underline}]{.mark} biodiversity loss on land and in the
water, freshwater depletion, climate change, economic growth and
development, [**[human health]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[world
hunger]{.underline}**]{.mark}," says Savitz. "That's why [fish is the
perfect protein]{.underline}."

[The [global]{.mark} [demand for]{.mark} [graphite]{.mark} has
**[tripled]{.mark} in size** between 2015 and 2020]{.underline} and [is
forecasted to reach **1.9 million tonne**]{.underline} [by
2028]{.underline}. Within this, [the market for battery-grade graphite
is expected to be **US\$14 billion** by 2025]{.underline},
[[with]{.mark} [a]{.mark} compound [**annual growth rate** of
26%]{.mark}]{.underline} (Miller, 2020; Benchmark Mineral Intelligence,
; Clark, 2018; European Carbon & Graphite Association, 2018; Leyland,
2019). One of the main drivers for these market increases is the
increase in demand for electric vehicles (EVs) (Zhang & Fujimori, 2020).

[[Graphite]{.mark} [is]{.mark} an **[essential]{.mark} material** used
[for **EV battery**]{.mark} anodes [and]{.mark} [will]{.mark} likely
**[remain]{.mark}** [as]{.mark} [the preferred]{.mark} material for this
purpose]{.underline} (Asenbauer et al., 2020; Wurm et al., 2018).
Graphite is the [[third most]{.mark} [abundant]{.mark}
material]{.underline} (by weight, at cell level[) [in]{.mark} the
**[lithium-ion batteries]{.mark}**]{.underline} (LIBs) [deployed in the
EVs]{.underline}; there is more graphite than lithium in an LIB battery.
For example, a Tesla Model S [[requires]{.underline}]{.mark} [[as much
as]{.mark} **[54 kg]{.mark}** of graphite]{.underline} (Tesla S)
(Graphit Kropfmühl GmbH, 2019; Olson et al., 2016).

[There is [continued focus]{.mark} [on]{.mark} the **[environmental
performance]{.mark}** of **e**]{.underline}lectric
**[v]{.underline}**ehicle[s]{.underline}, with life cycle assessment
(LCA) being the key methodology used to assess this (Hawkins et al.,
2013). A critical component of completing an LCA is the life cycle
inventory (LCI), which describes the material, energy, waste, and
associated environmental flows for a product or service system.
Environmental Product Declarations (EPD), described as type III
environmental declarations under ISO 14025 and the European Commission's
Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) are both used to facilitate
broader use of LCA and as tools supporting external communication and
public procurement (Del Borghi et al., 2020), and to limit the
methodological variability of LCAs (Zamagni, 2008). Development of a
type III environmental declaration for any product relies on pre-defined
product category rules (PCR).

At the same time, [this]{.underline} **[[EV
rev]{.mark}olution]{.underline}** [is heralding]{.underline}
**[a]{.underline}**nother **[[benefit]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that's
often overlooked]{.underline}---**[[clean]{.mark}er
[air]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[and]{.underline}
**[health]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[ier people]{.underline}**.
[[By]{.underline} **[eliminating]{.underline}**]{.mark} the
[[particles]{.mark} and gases like]{.underline} **[NO2]{.underline}**
[spewing from]{.underline} car [tailpipes and]{.underline} truck
[exhausts, [EVs]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[slash]{.underline}**]{.mark}
the ambient levels of **[[air pollutants]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that
have been linked to]{.underline} hundreds of thousands of early deaths
annually around the world from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases,
cancer, and other [illnesses]{.underline}. "[If we make a]{.underline}
**[widespread transition to EVs]{.underline}**, we can
[expect]{.underline} **[reduced]{.underline}** premature [mortality
and]{.underline} **[improved]{.underline}** asthma [outcomes,"
says]{.underline} Susan **[Anenberg]{.underline}**, director of the
Climate and Health Institute at George Washington University in
Washington, DC. Crops and vegetation will benefit as well.

Yet the details---including the types of EVs and where they're
driven---matter. Trucks are worse offenders than cars. And in some
places, more EVs could cause a rise in ground-level ozone, the main
ingredient of smog. There's even some question as to whether EVs will
increase particulate pollution, if extra weight due to batteries speeds
tire wear. [The]{.underline} **[[benefits are
clear]{.underline}]{.mark}**, but the caveats will require attention
from scientists, engineers, and policymakers. "We are moving headlong
into a world of electrified transport, but some of the implications of
this move remain unresolved," says numerical modeler Daniel Horton,
leader of the Climate Change Research Group at Northwestern University
in Evanston, IL.

Chemical Reactions

To get answers, researchers are using a combination of complex modeling,
real-world monitoring, and detailed epidemiological studies. The initial
inputs are data on the amount of particulates and gases emitted into the
air from cars, point sources like power plants and factories, and even
home furnaces. These are compiled into a National Emissions Inventory
and updated every few years. Modelers like Horton then compute how those
pollutants are blown by winds and transformed by chemical reactions to
calculate the levels and types of air pollution at any given time and
place.

Once the models compute baseline levels of air pollution, researchers
can explore how much the amounts would drop by switching to EVs. They
add up the health gains based on decades of epidemiological results,
which show how the incidences of diseases and premature deaths vary
among places with different levels of air pollution, and put a dollar
value on those benefits using medical costs and economists' calculations
of the value of a year of life.

This process is not an exact science. Each step has uncertainties, from
the accuracy of the pollutant emissions data to the complexity of the
air chemistry. The models are computationally expensive, prompting
trade-offs between the complexity of the meteorology and chemistry, and
the resolution---the size of the areas for which pollution levels are
calculated.

Clear Health Benefits

The [results]{.underline} also [[depend on]{.underline}]{.mark}
assumptions about the **[[rate and extent of]{.mark} EV
[adoption]{.mark}]{.underline}**, notes Erin Mayfield, assistant
professor of engineering at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, "but
[the models do help in narrowing]{.underline} down [the [range]{.mark}
of potential benefits---and]{.underline} [**[consistently]{.underline}**
[show]{.underline}]{.mark} [that the [benefits]{.mark} of widespread
adoption [are]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[large]{.underline}**]{.mark}."
Princeton's *Net-Zero America* report, which Mayfield worked on,
estimates that switching entirely to EVs powered by renewable or other
zero-carbon electricity would avoid up to 170,000 premature deaths and
\$1.5 trillion in damages (mostly from the avoided deaths) by 2050 (1).
The 2035 Report 2.0 from Energy Innovation and the University of
California (UC), Berkeley, estimates 150,000 avoided deaths and \$1.3
trillion in lower environmental and health costs by 2050 (2). "I [don't
think there is]{.underline} **[any doubt]{.underline}** [that if we
electrify vehicles]{.underline} and green the grid, [we are going to
see]{.underline} **[tremendous]{.underline}** [health
benefits]{.underline}," says Horton. Even with an electricity grid like
today's, in which 61% of power is generated by burning fossil fuels,
swapping out just one-quarter of all vehicles for electrics would avoid
nearly \$17 billion in damages, Horton's modeling shows (3). A grid with
more renewable energy inputs will further enhance the health benefits.

**[[Norway]{.underline}]{.mark}** [provides a]{.underline} **[real-world
[example]{.mark}]{.underline}** of what's possible. About 80% of new
cars sold now are fully electric (and another 10% are plug-in hybrids)
and are powered by an electricity grid that is already very green (91.8%
hydropower and 6.4% wind). As a result, between 2000 and 2020, the
[emissions of [particles]{.mark}]{.underline} under 2.5 micrometers in
size (a particularly dangerous type known as PM2.5)
**[[plunged]{.underline}]{.mark}** [by nearly]{.underline}
**[[three-quarters]{.underline}]{.mark}**, according to Statistics
Norway.

Sales of EVs in the United States are way behind Norway's, but are
accelerating. They hit 6% of the total in the third quarter of 2022, up
from 2.2% in the third quarter of 2020. Energy Innovation predicts that
the tax incentives in the recently passed IRA will lift sales to 22 to
29% of all new cars in the United States by 2030, depending on factors
like the share of purchases that qualify for credits (the act stipulates
certain "made in America" requirements), up from a projected 21% without
the incentives (4). "The impact of the IRA might be small in the near
term, but I think [the numbers will be]{.underline}
**[big]{.underline}** [on the]{.underline} **[health and climate
benefits]{.underline}** [within]{.underline} 10--12
[years]{.underline}," says David Wooley, executive director of the
Center for Environmental Public Policy at UC Berkeley's Goldman School
of Public Policy in California.

Since the turn of the century, [global [deaths]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[attributable to air pollution]{.underline}**]{.mark} [have
[increased]{.mark} by more than half, a development that]{.underline}
researchers say [[underscores the]{.mark} impact of pollution as
the]{.underline} ["**[largest existential threat]{.underline}** [to
human and planetary health]{.underline}]{.mark}."

The [findings, part of a]{.underline} **[study]{.underline}** published
Tuesday in The Lancet Planetary Health, [found that pollution was
responsible for]{.underline} an estimated **[9 million
deaths]{.underline}** [around the world in]{.underline}
**[2019]{.underline}**. Fully half of those fatalities, 4.5 million
deaths, were the result of ambient, or outdoor, air pollution, which is
typically emitted by vehicles and industrial sources like power plants
and factories.

The number of deaths that can be attributed to ambient air pollution has
increased by about 55 percent---to 4.5 million from 2.9 million---since
the year 2000.

Deaths from ambient air and chemical pollution were so prevalent, the
study's authors said, that [they]{.underline} **[[offset]{.mark} a
[decline]{.mark}]{.underline}** [in the number of deaths [from
other]{.mark} pollution [sources]{.mark}]{.underline} typically related
to conditions of extreme poverty, including indoor air pollution and
water pollution.

variety of environmental effects:

**[[Acid]{.mark} [rain]{.mark}]{.underline}** is precipitation
containing harmful amounts of nitric and sulfuric acids. These acids are
formed primarily by nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides released into the
atmosphere when fossil fuels are burned. These acids fall to the Earth
either as wet precipitation (rain, snow, or fog) or dry precipitation
(gas and particulates). Some are carried by the wind, sometimes hundreds
of miles. In the environment, acid rain **[damages trees and
causes]{.underline}** **[soils and water bodies to
acidify]{.underline}**, **[making the water]{.underline}** **[unsuitable
for]{.underline}** some fish and other **[wildlife]{.underline}**. It
also **[speeds the decay of buildings]{.underline}**, statues, and
sculptures that are part of our national heritage. Acid rain has damaged
Massachusetts lakes, ponds, rivers, and soils, leading to damaged

**[[Eutrophication]{.underline}]{.mark}** is a condition in a water body
**[[where]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[high concentrations]{.mark} of
nutrients]{.underline}** (such as nitrogen) [**[stimulate]{.underline}**
**[blooms of algae]{.underline}**,]{.mark}
**[[which]{.underline}]{.mark}** in turn can **[[cause]{.mark} [fish
kills]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[and loss of]{.underline}**]{.mark}
plant and animal **[[diversity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Although
eutrophication is a natural process in the aging of lakes and some
estuaries, human activities can greatly accelerate eutrophication by
increasing the rate at which nutrients enter aquatic ecosystems. Air
emissions of nitrogen oxides from power plants, cars, trucks, and other
sources contribute to the amount of nitrogen entering aquatic
ecosystems.

Haze is caused when sunlight encounters tiny pollution particles in the
air. Haze obscures the clarity, color, texture, and form of what we see.
Some haze-causing pollutants (mostly fine particles) are directly
emitted to the atmosphere by sources such as power plants, industrial
facilities, trucks and automobiles, and construction activities. Others
are formed when gases emitted to the air (such as sulfur dioxide and
nitrogen oxides) form particles as they are carried downwind. For more
information on haze, visit the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
(EPA) Visibility Web page: http://www.epa.gov/oar/visibility/.

Effects on wildlife. **[[Toxic pollutants in the
air,]{.underline}]{.mark}** or deposited on soils or surface waters, can
**[[impact wildlife]{.underline}]{.mark}** in a number of ways. Like
humans, animals can experience **[health problems]{.underline}** if they
are exposed to sufficient concentrations of air toxics over time.
Studies show that air toxics are contributing to **[birth
defects]{.underline}**, **[reproductive failure, and
disease]{.underline}** in animals. Persistent toxic air pollutants
(those that break down slowly in the environment) are of particular
concern in aquatic ecosystems. These pollutants accumulate in sediments
and may biomagnify in tissues of animals at the top of the food chain to
concentrations many times higher than in the water or air.

**[[Ozone depletion]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Ozone is a gas that occurs
both at ground-level and in the Earth\'s upper atmosphere, known as the
stratosphere. At ground level, ozone is a pollutant that can harm human
health. In the stratosphere, however, **[[ozone]{.mark} [forms a layer
that protects]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[life on
earth]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[from]{.underline}]{.mark}** the sun\'s
**[[harmful]{.underline}]{.mark}** ultraviolet (UV)
**[[rays]{.underline}]{.mark}**. But **[[this \"good\" ozone
is]{.underline}]{.mark}** gradually **[being]{.underline}**
[**[destroyed]{.underline}** **[by]{.underline}**]{.mark} man-made
chemicals referred to as **[ozone-depleting
[substances]{.mark}]{.underline}**, including chlorofluorocarbons,
hydrochlorofluorocarbons, and halons. These substances were formerly
used and sometimes still are used in coolants, foaming agents, fire
extinguishers, solvents, pesticides, and aerosol propellants. Thinning
of the protective ozone layer can cause increased amounts of UV
radiation to reach the Earth, which can lead to more cases of skin
cancer, cataracts, and impaired immune systems. UV can also damage
sensitive crops, such as soybeans, and reduce crop yields.

Crop and forest damage. **[Air pollution]{.underline}** can **[damage
crops]{.underline}** and trees in a variety of ways.Ground-level ozone
can lead to reductions in agricultural crop and commercial forest
yields, **[reduced growth and survivability]{.underline}** of tree
seedlings, **[and increased plant susceptibility to]{.underline}**
**[disease]{.underline}**, **[pests]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}**
other environmental stresses (such as **[harsh weather]{.underline}**).
As described above, crop and forest damage can also result from acid
rain and from increased UV radiation caused by ozone depletion.

#### Ozone depletion is [existential]{.underline}\-\--spreads [pandemics]{.underline} and kills [food security]{.underline}.

Susan **Hunt 19**. Editor at Ozone Depletion, Instructor at the
University of Sutherland, MA from the University of Sutherland. "What
Will Happen to Life on Earth if Ozone Depletion Continues?" 9-3-2019.
http://www.ozonedepletion.co.uk/what-will-happen-life-earth-if-ozone-depletion-continues.html

Most [**[scientists]{.mark} are [agreed]{.mark}** that
**[without]{.mark} the earth's [ozone]{.mark} layer**[, we would]{.mark}
**all [cease to exist]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

That's one of the main reasons that global ozone levels are now
constantly monitored and worldwide research is taking place into ozone
depletion.

Land and Water Life Would Suffer

[**[Without]{.mark} the [ozone]{.mark} layer's protection** from the
sun, [**people, animals and plant life** would be **destroyed**]{.mark}.
**Even [underwater life]{.mark}** [would not be safe since UV]{.mark}
rays [can **penetrate**]{.mark}]{.underline} clear
**[[water]{.underline}]{.mark}** to a certain depth before being
absorbed.

Of course, the actual effect on mankind of less ozone depends on the
extent to which it is depleted. Experts believe that for every 1% drop
in ozone protection, there is an increase of around 2% in UV-B rays
which get through to the planet's surface.

Good News

However, research carried out for the United Nations Environmental
Programme showed that ozone levels had not fallen further between 2002
and 2005, thanks to initiatives such as the Montreal Protocol.

One of the greatest problems with ozone is that we need the "right"
amount to maintain life as we know it today. Too little and life on
earth could be wiped out -- but too much and we won't receive the amount
of sunlight that we need. (Some scientists are now concerned that global
warming will lead to much higher levels of ozone which could block out
too much sun).

It is widely known that [rates of [**skin cancer** are linked to
UV]{.mark}-B exposure]{.underline} -- which is one of the reasons that
it's so important to use suncream and to make sure that children are
protected from the sun. (Latest research suggests that you are more at
risk from just two or three instances of extreme sunburn than from
prolonged but limited exposure such as sunbathing.)

Increase in Disease

However, [increased exposure to the sun's radiation can also cause
**blindness** and cataracts and, alarmingly]{.underline}, some experts
now believe that [the amount of **[protection]{.mark}** we receive [from
**vaccinations**]{.mark} (for diseases such as measles) [could be
**reduced**]{.mark} in people exposed to higher levels of UV-B
rays]{.underline}.

Depending on the level of exposure to the sun, [effects can range from
**premature ageing** to certain kinds of **skin cancer**]{.underline}.
Over the past decade there has been a large increase in the number of
people developing skin cancer but this could be attributed to the rise
in the popularity of sunbathing over the past quarter-of-a-century
rather than simply to reduced ozone levels.

Our Food Chain

[Many [**biological systems** are damaged by]{.mark} exposure to
[UV]{.mark}]{.underline}-B and [[research has shown]{.mark} that [its
effects are **proportional**]{.mark}]{.underline} [to the time and
intensity of exposure]{.underline} and of course, [small and delicate
organisms are much more vulnerable to damage]{.underline} than larger
species, such as humans.

[[Exposure]{.mark} to higher levels of UV-B can **[stunt]{.mark} the
[growth and photosynthesis]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} a **variety of
[crops]{.mark}** such as maize, rye and sunflowers [and]{.mark} can also
affect the [**reproductive capacity** of **aquatic life**. Many
are]{.mark} **already [under UV]{.mark}-B [stress]{.mark}**[, and
if]{.mark} their [exposure]{.mark} is **further
[increased]{.mark}**]{.underline} [then [we]{.mark} could [see
**disruption** of]{.mark}]{.underline} some **[[food
chains]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

### 1NC\-\--AT: Electric Vehicles

#### EVs are [inaccessible]{.underline}, [prohibitively expensive]{.underline}, and [emissions-intensive]{.underline}\-\--while some [are inevitable]{.underline}, only [using less]{.underline} can facilitate [net-zero]{.underline}.

Fantasy," Real Clear Energy,
https://www.realclearenergy.org/articles/2023/11/21/the_biden_administrations_ev_goals_are_an_expensive_fantasy_994010.html)

[[For **gas**]{.mark}oline **vehicles**, [the price]{.mark} you see [at
the]{.mark} gas [**pump** covers]{.mark} the [cost of
**extracting**]{.mark}, refining, and transporting]{.underline} the
gasoline, [[but the same **cannot be said** for]{.underline}]{.mark} the
cost of charging [[an **EV**. EVs require]{.mark} **new
[charging]{.mark}**]{.underline} infrastructure, [[and]{.mark} their
large **power draw** increases the **[strain]{.mark}** on [electricity
**infrastructure**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As our research highlights, a
typical EV charging overnight at home consumes as much power as several
homes, and an EV charging at a fast-charging station in 30 minutes
consumes as much power as a small to medium-sized grocery store. A few
extra EVs in the neighborhoods are manageable, but widespread EV
adoption will require significant and expensive grid upgrades.

Adding insult to injury, EV owners alone aren't shouldering these
increased electricity costs, which average \$11,833 per vehicle over 10
years. Until a utility starts charging EV owners for the extra
infrastructure costs to serve them, those costs are shared among all the
utility's customers. Residential electricity costs across the U.S. have
risen 20% over the last three years, and a rapid forced adoption of EVs
will only make this problem worse.

Direct federal and state subsidies provide EVs with another \$8,984 per
vehicle over 10 years, including the widely publicized \$7,500 federal
tax credit in the so-called Inflation Reduction Act and smaller state
subsidies for EVs. All these subsidies, of course, are borne by the
American taxpayer.

President Biden's expensive green pipe dream is not without irony.

While Biden administration claims that these draconian EV mandates are
necessary to combat climate change, the widespread adoption of EVs in
the developed world would have negligible effects on global emissions
and climate. For starters, if EVs are able to displace all the carbon
emissions from U.S. passenger cars, that would only cut out 20% of U.S.
carbon emissions. Our calculations show that even if the U.S. eliminated
all of its carbon emissions by 2050, the effect on global temperatures
in 2100 would only be 0.08 degrees Celsius.

But EVs will not even get us that far because they don't cut carbon
emissions much---if at all---compared  to gasoline vehicles. As pointed
out by Mark Mills in a recent op-ed in Real Clear Energy, it is nearly
impossible to measure an individual EV's emissions. While driving an EV
itself does not directly produce emissions, the emissions to generate
the electricity used to charge EVs vary widely depending on location.

[[EV **batteries**]{.mark} also [require **fossil fuels** to
produce]{.mark}]{.underline}, and many components of EV batteries are
made in emissions-heavy China. The [[emissions]{.mark} resulting [from
**mining** and **processing**]{.mark} the materials]{.underline} used in
the battery are largely unreported, and the emissions during EV
production [[could]{.underline}]{.mark} potentially [be enough to
**[wipe out]{.mark}** the **[emissions saved]{.mark}** by not combusting
gasoline]{.underline}.

A recent study by Volvo attempts to quantify some of these factors, and
the result is not rosy for EVs. The lifetime emissions of the electric
version of the Volvo SUV at the center of the study are only a third
less than the emissions of the gasoline version, and that is when it is
charged on the carbon-light European grid. Different assumptions could
lead to an EV emitting more carbon than its gasoline counterpart. The
obvious conclusion is that without rapid reductions in carbon emissions
from the electric grid, an equally Herculean task to EV mass adoption,
EVs will continue to produce significant carbon emissions.

Emissions from gasoline vehicles are projected to decline 20% over the
next decade, and hybrids, which nearly double the fuel efficiency of a
gasoline vehicle with a battery that is 50-100 times smaller than an EV
battery, would actually produce the least amount of lifetime emissions.
But the net-zero advocates are needlessly demanding all EVs---or
nothing.

EVs would also have little impact on levels of actual pollution in U.S.
cities, like soot and smog, because the U.S. is already a world leader
in clean air. When the number of passenger cars on the road fell by half
during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, there was no
measurable impact on air quality in the U.S. Our air pollution levels
are so close their natural state that weather has a far greater impact
on pollution levels in most U.S. cities than the emissions from our
vehicles.

[The [reality is, **EVs** are **not going away**]{.mark} any time soon,
[but **neither** are **cars**]{.mark} in general. [Americans
are]{.mark}]{.underline} still **[[driving]{.underline}]{.mark}**
at nearly [[the **same rate**]{.mark} they were
[before]{.mark}]{.underline} the **[[COVID]{.underline}]{.mark}**-19
pandemic---[more than [**3.2 trillion** miles]{.mark} total
**[annually]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Even the addition of a few hundred
million [**[new EVs]{.mark}** over [the next
decade]{.mark}]{.underline}, up from 20 million today, [[will
**only account**]{.mark} for]{.underline} approximately 10-[[**20%**
of]{.mark} all]{.underline} passenger [[vehicles
**globally**]{.underline}]{.mark}.\[GU1\] \[GU2\] \[3\]  Currently, 90%
of EVs in the U.S. are purchased as a second or third car, usually in
addition to a gasoline vehicle. If the U.S. were to adopt the
[Biden]{.underline} administration's preferred number [EVs,
[consumers]{.mark} would [have to **purchase** EVs]{.mark} at a
scale]{.underline} and velocity [[**10 times**
greater]{.underline}]{.mark} and faster [[than **any**]{.mark}
new]{.underline} model [[car **in history**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[Even **this isn't enough**]{.underline}]{.mark} to achieve the left's
dystopian net-zero goals. The International Energy
Agency forecasts \[GU4\] [the [**number** of]{.mark}]{.underline} global
[[households **without a car** needs to rise]{.underline}]{.mark} from
45% today [[to **70%** to achieve **net-zero**]{.mark} by 2050. That's
right---[70%]{.mark} of people]{.underline} around the world [[must
**not** have a **car**]{.underline}]{.mark} to meet the global elite's
climate goals. Most of [the]{.underline} 45% of [households]{.underline}
who do not own cars [are in **developing** world and
**crave**]{.underline} the kind of [personal **mobility**]{.underline}
we enjoy [in the **U.S.** and in **Europe**]{.underline}, but net-zero
will require them to remain confined forever or to rely solely on
government-owned transit. Even the developed world will have to cut its
driving dramatically. In California, regulators predicted \[GU5\] that
the state's emissions goals will require Californians to both buy EVs
and reduce miles driven by 25%.

### 1NC\-\--AT: Lithium Batteries

#### No lithium shortages -- African Markets, Consumer Preferences, and Market Slowdown Solves

**Homes**, Andy 7-11-**24** Senior metals columnist who previously
covered industrial metals markets for Metals Week and was EMEA
commodities editor at Knight-Ridder (subsequently Bridge). Started up
Metals Insider in 2003 and sold it to Thomson Reuters in 2008, he is
author of 'Siberian Dreams' (2006) about the Russian Arctic (After
another boom and bust, where next for lithium? \| reuters. (n.d.).
https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/after-another-boom-bust-where-next-lithium-andy-home-2024-07-11/)

LONDON, July 11 (Reuters) - [Lithium boom has turned to lithium bust
over the last two years as a wave of **new supply** overwhelms
**weaker-than-expected** demand for electric vehicle (EV)
batteries]{.underline}.

The CME contract for lithium hydroxide has collapsed from a 2022 high of
\$85,000 per metric ton to \$11,930. The CME carbonate contract was
above \$40,000 when it began trading in July 2023 and has since slumped
to \$12,850.

[Lithium has **been here before**. There was a similar boom-bust cycle
in 2016-2017 but the difference this time is that no-one seems to be
expecting a speedy recovery.]{.underline}

The [short-term outlook is for]{.underline} [prices to trundle along at
the lows as the market digests surplus material]{.underline}.

The longer-term picture is more positive as governments force the
transition to electric vehicles but there will be no return to the giddy
heights of 2022 in the next 10 years, according to analysts at BMI, a
Fitch Solutions company.

Don\'t be too quick to write off either lithium or the electric vehicle
sector, though. The current price bust has been exacerbated by one-offs
on both the supply and demand sides of the equation.

[TOO MUCH SUPPLY]{.underline}

Lithium producers view their product as a bespoke chemical tailored to
battery-makers\' tight specifications rather than as a generic
commodity.

[Yet lithium\'s price behaviour is that of any other commodity, periods
of **high pricing encouraging** over-production which must then be
weeded out by periods of low pricing.]{.underline}

That pattern is currently playing out as producers trim output and defer
expansion plans in reaction to the new much lower price reality.

One little-discussed element of the current glut, however, is the surge
in artisanal mining (ASM) in Africa, particularly in Nigeria and
Zimbabwe.

[Research house CRU estimates that artisanal miners accounted for almost
two-thirds of African lithium supply in 2023 with volumes nearly
equivalent to the global market surplus last year.]{.underline}

African shipments of ore and low-grade concentrates accounted for a
quarter of China\'s total lithium imports in the first quarter of this
year on a metal contained basis, according to CRU.

Chinese entities are heavily involved in formalising artisanal supply
which is centred on previous tin and tantalum mining areas.

However, ASM is particularly price sensitive. The current wave of
independent production began when the price of spodumene ore was still
above \$6,000 per ton at the start of 2023. It is now closer to \$1,000,
challenging the economic viability of all but the richest of deposits.

More formalisation may result but as the cobalt market has learnt, ASM
can be a very significant and very fast-moving swing component of the
overall supply picture.

[TOO LITTLE DEMAND]{.underline}

Compounding lithium\'s price weakness has been a downgrade in
expectations for EV sales as the Chinese market matures and the Western
market loses some of its recent momentum.

[The EV revolution has hit a **slow patch** but is far from going into
reverse.]{.underline} BNP Paribas, for example, is still expecting
global sales growth of 23% this year, equivalent to over 18.7 million
vehicles.

[What has changed, however, is the product mix. Sales of pure battery
vehicles are **flat-lining**, while sales of hybrid gas-electric
vehicles are booming, even in China.]{.underline}

[Chinese sales of plug-in hybrids jumped by 90% year-on-year in April
and May, while those of pure electric vehicles rose by a comparatively
modest 10%, according to BNP.]{.underline}

This may be good news for the broader energy transition but it\'s not so
good for lithium since many hybrids use a nickel hydride battery with no
lithium, the bank notes.

Hybrids, once viewed as a mere stepping stone on the journey from
internal combustion to fully electric engines are proving remarkably
popular with consumers worried about charging infrastructure and the
relatively high cost of pure battery vehicles.

Automakers are responding. Stellantis [(STLAM.MI), opens new
tab](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/STLAM.MI), which saw
hybrid sales grow by 41% year-on-year in Europe in the first half of the
year, plans [to
expand](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/stellantis-expand-hybrid-vehicle-line-meet-growing-demand-2024-07-09/) its
line of affordable hybrid vehicles to 36 models in Europe by 2026.

So too are governments. [The Joe Biden administration has [rowed
back](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/plug-in-polluters-how-bidens-emissions-rules-go-soft-hybrid-trucks-suvs-2024-06-06/) on
its target of converting two-thirds of new vehicles to battery electric
vehicles by 2032, allowing auto-makers to step up production of hybrids
instead.]{.underline}

[FULL CHARGE AHEAD]{.underline}

[The automotive energy transition is still in full swing but is not
matching the exuberant forecasts made a couple of years
ago.]{.underline}

There is now too much lithium supply and too much battery capacity
relative to consumer demand for electric vehicles.

The slowdown could easily reverse.

[One critical facilitator will be the build-out of EV **charging
infrastructure**, a sector which has attracted **far less investment**
than battery manufacturing.]{.underline}

Car buyers in Europe and the United States are choosing hybrids because
of range anxiety and they will continue to do so until they see more
charging points.

[The second key factor is price, with electric vehicles **still more
expensive** than traditional cars everywhere outside of
China.]{.underline}

[Just as high lithium prices were]{.underline} [good news for
**producers** but not **battery-makers**]{.underline}, current low
prices are bad news for the lithium sector but very good news for
consumers in the form of lower battery prices.

[Lithium-ion battery packs registered a 7% increase in price between
2021 and 2022, breaking a long-running downtrend, according to the
International Energy Agency. High lithium prices were matched by bull
markets in other battery inputs such as cobalt, nickel and
graphite.]{.underline}

[Battery prices are now tumbling as prices for lithium and other
materials fall.]{.underline}

[The average Asian nickel-cobalt-manganese battery cell price fell to
\$90 per kilowatt hour in May, according to analysts at Benchmark
Mineral Intelligence. That was the lowest since 2021 and a long way off
the March 2022 peak of \$166.]{.underline}

[**[Global markets]{.mark}** have affected and **[transformed]{.mark}**
[Indigenous economies]{.mark} across the world]{.underline}. Indigenous
communities are [[under]{.mark} **[increasing pressure]{.mark}** [to
**conform** to]{.mark} a global market economy]{.underline} in the form
of [[profit-driven]{.mark} activities such as **[logging]{.mark}**,
**[mining]{.mark}**, hydropower, and **[oil]{.mark}** [and
**gas**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Today's Indigenous economies demonstrate
a continuum where priorities are sliding from market]{.underline} (fully
monetized) [to subsistence]{.underline} (nonmonetized) activities. This
sliding was captured schematically in the following work: "A Conceptual
Framework of [[Arctic]{.mark} Economies]{.underline} for Policy-making,
Research, and Practice" (Larsen et al., 2019). The framework allows one
to visualize the push and pull among various factors affecting Arctic
economies. Between these theoretic ideas lie mixed economies that
combine both monetized and partially monetized aspects of economic
development. It is this conscious prioritization of monetary and
nonmonetary features that Indigenous communities strive to balance and
sustain.

The objective of this article is to explicate the various types of
[[Indigenous economies]{.underline}]{.mark} on the continuum between
subsistence and market [[across]{.underline}]{.mark} three Arctic
countries---Russia, Finland, and the United States
(**[[Alaska]{.underline}]{.mark}**). We aim to [identify strategies of
developing Indigenous economies and the approaches that various
stakeholders use to balance the for-profit and nonprofit goals of
Indigenous communities' economic activity]{.underline}. The core idea is
to demonstrate that some features of Indigenous economies are a crucial
part of Indigenous culture and help sustain the traditional way of life
and interaction with the market economy in a changing environment. In
other words, we discuss the interaction between culture and economy.

As the methods of our research, we employed context analysis of Russian,
American, and Finnish legislation and strategies, case studies, and
contextual interviews with representatives of governments and Indigenous
communities.

Theoretical approaches to Indigenous economies and methodology of the
research

[Indigenous economies refer to the traditional and local structures of
Indigenous peoples]{.underline}. These [[structures]{.underline}]{.mark}
may [[include]{.underline}]{.mark} a [variety of **[land]{.mark}**-
[and]{.mark} **[marine-based]{.mark}**, small-scale economic
[activities]{.mark} and practices as well as]{.underline} [sustainable
resource management]{.underline} (Kuokkanen, 2011). Indigenous economies
are difficult to define because of their [uniqueness and
diversity]{.underline}; there is no definition that applies to all.
Although it is difficult to define a single structure, we can assume
that Indigenous [economies are]{.underline} a [combination of organized
communal, family, and individual activities]{.underline} of aboriginal
peoples living on their traditional land and aiming to satisfy their
need to lead a traditional way of life, including consumption needs, in
a modern world that is increasingly imposing on the Arctic. In general,
the Indigenous economy includes vital economic, social, cultural, and
spiritual dimensions.

[The recent Arctic Human Development Report describes [Indigenous
communities]{.mark} as ones that **[maintain subsistence]{.mark}**
production [within]{.mark} [**traditional social** structures]{.mark},
**[exploit new economic opportunities]{.mark}**, [and create]{.mark}
increasingly [complex **socioeconomic dynamics**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Poppel and Kruse, 2010; Larsen and Fondahl, 2015). [The key principles
of Indigenous economies that differentiate them from other economic
models are subsistence, environmental awareness, that is, **awareness
of** the **[consequences]{.mark}** of their activities]{.underline}
(Nath, 2009), [[and]{.mark} [rational use]{.mark} [of]{.mark} **[natural
resources]{.mark}** as a proven and historical way to survive in harsh
Arctic conditions with limited nature's capacity as compared to lower
latitudes]{.underline} (Lavrillier and Gabyshev, 2017). Furthermore,
reciprocity is defined as reflection on land-based worldviews founded on
active recognition of kinship relations that extend beyond the human
domain (Kuokkanen, 2006; Lasimbang, 2008). Indigenous economies are
contingent upon a stable and continuous relationship between the human
and natural worlds (Kuokkanen, 2011), a crucial link existing between
Indigenous economies and Indigenous traditional knowledge. [Indigenous
knowledge and practices have historically been an integral part of
Indigenous economies that reflect their social, economic, and
environmental values and aspirations]{.underline}. Hunn (1999) notes
that Indigenous or traditional ecological knowledge "is a consequence of
subsistence-based production[." Indigenous peoples continue to
**[rely]{.mark}** [on]{.mark} their [traditional practices]{.mark}
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[sustainable use]{.mark}** of renewable
resources]{.underline} although [this dependence occasionally [puts them
at risk]{.mark} [of being **adversely affected**]{.mark} [by
**industrial activities**]{.mark} [and **market
effects**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[In [remote communities]{.mark}, fueling an electric generator is **so
expensive** that some people [spend **half their income on
energy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[In]{.underline}]{.mark} states like
[[Alaska]{.underline}]{.mark}---[which is home to **hundreds of remote
communities**]{.underline}---[[micro-reactors]{.mark} would
[enable]{.mark}]{.underline} these [communities to [power]{.mark} their
way of life [at a **lower cost** while **protecting the
climate**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[M]{.mark}icro-[r]{.mark}eactors]{.underline} "[could be [a **perfect
fit**]{.mark}]{.underline} throughout our state," said Sen. Lisa
Murkowski (R-Alaska). "As the name suggests, these [smaller reactors can
be right-sized for dozens of Alaska communities and will have
**[off-grid capability]{.mark}** that could [solve the challenge of
providing **clean**, **affordable energy** in our remote
areas]{.mark}]{.underline}."

Remote Communities Need Electricity Too

[In the best case, to run a **[diesel generator]{.mark}** in rural
Alaska or]{.underline} other [remote regions, you get a fuel delivery by
tanker truck]{.underline}. More challenging is delivery [by barge in the
brief window when the sea is ice-free and conditions allow
it.]{.underline} Finally, you can fly the fuel in [by tanker plane,
burning jet fuel to supply diesel fuel]{.underline}. In Arctic Village,
near the center of the state, the protocol is for the pilot to buzz the
settlement first to warn snowmobilers to stay off the road that crosses
the single runway.

[In the coldest part of winter, you]{.underline} may [have to burn some
of the fuel to keep the remainder warm, so]{.underline} that [it doesn't
turn into a gel that can't be pumped]{.underline} into the engine.

[After all that]{.underline} effort, [the [cost]{.mark} of a
kilowatt-hour [can be]{.mark} nearly [**10 times higher** than]{.mark}
what [electricity]{.mark} sells for [on]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[big
grids]{.mark} of the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and
Canada. [This high cost forces families to **reduce their energy
consumption**]{.underline}; in fact, they use only 20 percent of the
energy that the average customer in Alaska uses.

[In the end, if all goes well, you still have]{.underline} an
[electricity [source]{.mark} that [is **dirty** and
**expensive**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[M]{.mark}icro-[R]{.mark}eactors]{.underline} Can [[Provide **Clean**,
**Reliable Energy**]{.mark} and More]{.underline}

[There is a better way]{.underline}, according to 15 nuclear companies
that are working on [micro-reactors]{.underline} , which range from
major industrial corporations to startups. [These]{.underline} reactors
[[would be **factory-built** and **shipped**]{.mark} in by truck, barge
or even plane and have an output approximately 1,000 times smaller than
the grid-based machines that are running today]{.underline}.

[And they would share]{.underline} a characteristic of the grid-based
reactors: [**fuel security**. [Big]{.mark} power [reactors]{.mark} stop
to [refuel every 18 months]{.mark} to 2 years]{.underline}, [[but
m]{.mark}icro-[r]{.mark}eactors]{.underline} could [**[run for a
decade]{.mark}**]{.underline} or so [between refueling]{.underline}.

[[Between]{.mark} the [savings]{.mark}]{.underline} in diesel fuel plus
fuel delivery [[and]{.mark} the value of [fuel security]{.mark},
micro-reactors [present a **major benefit for residents**]{.mark} and a
**significant commercial opportunity**]{.underline}.

Micro-reactors are also able to provide additional benefits beyond
electricity.

"[In Arctic communities, they could use more heat energy than electric
energy]{.underline}," said Marc Nichol, director of new reactors at the
Nuclear Energy Institute. "[The beauty of
[m]{.mark}icro-[r]{.mark}eactors is that they [can **provide both heat**
and **electricity**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and where vehicles are either
electric or run on hydrogen fuel---also able to be produced by
micro-reactors---[this [allows **complete independence** from
petroleum-based fuels]{.mark}]{.underline}[."]{.mark}

Micro-Reactors Are Cost-Competitive

How much would the [micro-reactors cost]{.underline}? NEI has released a
report that says the price would be [**far less** than what people in
remote communities pay now]{.underline}, though still higher than
grid-based electricity. [For remote communities, micro-reactors [could
reduce the cost]{.mark}]{.underline} to produce a kilowatt-hour [of
electricity [by **30 percent or more**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The economic drivers are different from those of a diesel generator. The
cost of interest charges is a bigger factor for micro-reactors than
diesel generators. Interestcost depends on who the buyer is. In general,
the cost of capital is higher for investor-owned utilities, and lower
for those that are co-ops or municipally owned.

Loan guarantees also could allow a lower interest rate.

The [generator's projected lifetime can also affect cost. Often the
calculation is done assuming 40 years, but power reactors on the grid
are now demonstrating that they can **run far longer**.]{.underline}
[Another factor is how many micro-reactors are deployed. Doing something
once can be expensive, but in the second or third round, **costs come
down sharply**]{.underline}.

But [in all cases, [analyses show that m]{.mark}icro-[r]{.mark}eactors
in remote locations can]{.underline} be competitive with diesel
generators, and [**[offer many]{.mark} other [benefits]{.mark}** that
are [**not provided by other energy sources**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

**Smith '6-16** \[Alexander; June 16; NBC News, "How Israel\'s Iran
strikes might supercharge the global nuclear arms race,"
https://www.nbcnews.com/world/middle-east/israels-iran-strikes-might-supercharge-global-nuclear-arms-race-rcna213200\]

Israel says it first bombed Iran to stop it from being able to produce
nuclear weapons and the "existential threat" they would represent. But
the **[conflict]{.underline}** may in the long run serve the opposite
purpose: **[illustrating]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}
**[Tehran]{.underline}** [and other **nuclear-aspirant**]{.underline}
[nations that]{.underline} **[nuclear weapons]{.underline}** [are
essential in **shielding** them against attack]{.underline}.

[Countries such as]{.underline} **[No]{.underline}**rth
**[Ko]{.underline}**rea [already pointed to]{.underline}
**[Libya]{.underline}**, whose leader, Moammar [Gadhafi, gave up
his]{.underline} nascent weapons [program]{.underline} [but was
toppled]{.underline} anyway in 2011 after a NATO intervention. That's
one of the reasons Pyongyang has developed its own arsenal --- which is
believed to have San Francisco and other U.S. cities within range --- to
protect itself against attempts at Western-backed regime change.

"If you look at the last five or six years, [you've got a repeated
series of incidents that demonstrate **nuc**lear weapon**s** are a
**really**, really **powerful deterrence**]{.underline}," said Robert
Kelly, a professor specializing in nuclear proliferation at South
Korea's Pusan National University.

[As **Iran** just found out, "if you don't have them, you get
**bombed**]{.underline}," he said.

Kelly is among the expert watchers who worry that [Israel's attack on
Iran will **trigger prolif**erat]{.underline}ion both
"**[horizontal]{.underline}**" --- [nuclear states building more weapons
--- and "**vertical**]{.underline}" [--- nonnuclear states trying to get
them]{.underline}.

[That would accelerate an **existing trend**]{.underline}, according to
watchdogs such as the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute,
the Sweden-based weapons monitor known as SIPRI.

"The signs are that [a new **arms race** is **gearing up**]{.underline}
[that carries much more **risk** and **uncertainty** than the last
one]{.underline}," SIPRI Director Dan Smith said in a statement Monday
as his group released the findings of its 2025 yearbook.

[Cold War adversaries **America** and **Russia**]{.underline} [are both
**modernizing** their]{.underline} **[weapons]{.underline}**, [while the
**fastest**]{.underline} [warhead **production** is happening in
**China**,]{.underline} SIPRI said. Meanwhile [**India** and
**Pakistan**]{.underline} have [developed]{.underline} [new systems,
with their decadeslong **enmity** almost spilling over into
**conflict**]{.underline} earlier this year.

In terms of potential new members of the nuclear club, "the most obvious
is **[Iran]{.underline}** itself," Kelly said. "As soon as this war is
over, I think [it's]{.underline} pretty [clear they're going to go back
and]{.underline} **[build]{.underline}** [these things
again]{.underline}. I'd be really shocked if they didn't."

That chimes with what former U.S. officials told NBC News this weekend:
[there could be a scenario in which Israel's **strikes** prompt Tehran
to **rush** toward building a **bomb**.]{.underline}

[That could start]{.underline} what experts call [a "**cascade**"
effect]{.underline}.

A **[nuclear]{.underline}**-armed **[Iran]{.underline}** [would cause
great **anxiety**]{.underline} [in Israel]{.underline} --- which is
estimated to have around 90 nuclear weapons, although it has never
publicly admitted this.

But [it would also provoke grave fears in Iran's]{.underline} historical
Sunni Muslim [adversaries, such as **Saudi Arabia**]{.underline},
despite a recent tentative rapprochement.

"Although Saudi Arabia does not possess weapons of mass destruction,
**[Saudi]{.underline}** officials have [expressed]{.underline} that
[they will]{.underline} [acquire]{.underline} **[nuc]{.underline}**lear
weapon**[s]{.underline}** [if their regional rival,
**Iran**]{.underline}, [does]{.underline}," according to the Nuclear
Threat Initiative, a nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C.

Meanwhile **[No]{.underline}**rth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea [will likely
see Israel's strikes as a **ringing validation**.]{.underline}

They \"must be patting themselves on the back right now," Decker
Eveleth, an analyst at the Washington nonprofit CNA Corporation focusing
on Pyongyang's weapons program, posted on X. Israel's bombardment "is
precisely the sort of air campaign" North Korea "anticipated for decades
and the reason why they wanted nuclear weapons," he said.

[There is growing **jitteriness**]{.underline} [among **America's
allies**]{.underline}, too, after President Donald
**[Trump]{.underline}** has [repeatedly questioned]{.underline}
[Washington's]{.underline} postwar [commitment]{.underline} to defending
them. That has "[created]{.underline} additional
**[uncertainty]{.underline}**," SIPRI said, and [calls]{.underline}
[for]{.underline} these countries [to develop their own
**arsenals**]{.underline}.

**[So]{.underline}**uth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea was [always told it did
not need its own]{.underline} [weapons]{.underline} because it was
protected by Washington's "nuclear umbrella." Now --- [after
Trump]{.underline} openly [suggested]{.underline} that [it]{.underline}
might [have to pay **billions**]{.underline} of dollars for U.S.
military support --- South **[Koreans]{.underline}** increasingly [want

The end of nuclear transparency in Iran

[Iran's **suspension** of **coop**]{.underline}eration [with the
**IAEA** [marks]{.mark} the [**end** of]{.mark} **[nuclear
transparency]{.mark}**]{.underline} provided by agency inspections in
the country since 1974. Thanks to this transparency, we knew, prior to
June 13, the exact amount and locations of Iran's fissile material
stockpiles --- which could not have been diverted to military uses
without being noticed by the IAEA. Now, due the Israeli and U.S.
attacks, this knowledge has been lost.

Israel --- whose goal appears to be to weaken and remove the Iranian
government, rather than just its nuclear program --- is likely to push
for additional military actions. [That [Iran's **nuclear capabilities**
were,]{.mark} predictably, [**not** all **destroyed**]{.mark} by the
military strikes, makes it **difficult** for Washington to **restrain**
Israel even if it wishes to do so]{.underline}. [This points to the
**open**-ended **aggression**]{.underline} that experts have long warned
would result from attacks against Iran's nuclear facilities.

[Apart from]{.underline} its **[perception]{.underline}**
[that]{.underline} the **[IAEA]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}
politically **[biased]{.underline}** [in favor of Israel and Western
countries, Iran's decision to suspend cooperation with the agency
arguably reflects a concern that nuclear **transparency** might
**undermine** its **interests**]{.underline}. By indicating the location
of nuclear materials and facilities that survived the war, IAEA findings
could be used to facilitate future Israeli and U.S. military targeting.

Demonstrating the flawed logic of aggressive counterproliferation, [the
[war]{.mark} on Iran could be seen as a **[perfect argument]{.mark}**
for Tehran [to]{.mark} [**leave** the **NPT** and develop a

(MENAFN- The Conversation) In the wake of recent strikes by Israel and
the United States on Iranian cities, military sites and nuclear
facilities, a troubling paradox has emerged: [[actions intended to
**prevent** Iran from acquiring **nuc**]{.mark}lear weapon**[s]{.mark}**
may actually]{.underline} be **[[accelerat]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing
[[its **pursuit**]{.underline}]{.mark} of them [[and]{.mark}
**[encourag]{.mark}**ing]{.underline} **[[other
countries]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to **follow suit**]{.underline}.

On June 13, Israel launched Operation Rising Lion , a military campaign
aimed at dismantling Iran\'s nuclear program. The operation began with a
series of co-ordinated strikes targeting Iran\'s top nuclear scientists,
senior military officials and key members of the Islamic Revolutionary
Guard Corps.

Despite establishing air dominance, Israel did not possess the
capability to destroy Iran\'s most heavily fortified nuclear
facilities - especially the Fordow enrichment site, which is buried deep
within a mountain.

On June 21, the U.S. carried out major airstrikes targeting Iran\'s
critical nuclear sites at Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan. Using B-2 stealth
bombers equipped with bunker-busting bombs, the operation aimed to
cripple Iran\'s deeply fortified nuclear infrastructure.

Three days later, Iran and Israel agreed to a ceasefire , bringing the
12-day conflict to an end. While both sides declared aspects of the
campaign successful, the war marked a dangerous escalation in regional
tensions and raised renewed concerns over the future of nuclear
nonproliferation and security in the Middle East.

negotiations

The U.S. has consistently asserted that Iran must never be allowed to
acquire nuclear weapons. In 2006, Iran was subjected to international
sanctions after the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reported
the government was not in compliance with its nuclear energy
obligations.

Under former president Barack Obama, the U.S. government pursued a
diplomatic path, culminating in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of
Action (JCPOA). Under the deal, Iran agreed to limit uranium enrichment
to 3.67 per cent and allow intrusive IAEA inspections. In exchange, it
received relief from some international sanctions.

In 2018, U.S. President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the
JCPOA, despite IAEA reports confirming Iran\'s compliance . This
decision undermined diplomatic trust and prompted Iran to scale back its
commitments under the deal.

The Biden administration sought to revive the JCPOA, but Iran demanded
binding guarantees that future U.S. governments would not again
withdraw - an assurance Biden could not provide.

In the aftermath, [[Iran]{.mark} significantly **[escalated]{.mark}**
its [nuclear]{.mark} [activities]{.mark}. According to IAEA reports ,
[Iran has more than **400**]{.mark} **[k]{.mark}**ilo**[g]{.mark}**rams
of **[enriched uranium]{.mark}** to 60 per cent - an amount that, if
further refined to 90 per cent, [could]{.mark} be sufficient to
[produce]{.mark} 10 to **[12 nuc]{.mark}**lear weapon**[s]{.mark}**
.]{.underline}

[[Iran]{.mark} has long [used]{.mark} its nuclear [program as a
**bargaining chip**]{.mark}]{.underline} in negotiations with the U.S.
While Iranian officials have maintained their program is purely
peaceful, the country produces more highly enriched uranium than it
needs for domestic power generation . Enriching uranium has been a way
for Iran to raise pressure on the U.S. to lift sanctions.

The second Trump administration resumed negotiations for a new nuclear
deal aimed at imposing stronger constraints on Iran\'s nuclear program.

Although five rounds of negotiations were held, a sixth round scheduled
for June 15 was disrupted when Israel conducted a military strike on
Iran two days earlier. The attack escalated tensions and derailed the
diplomatic process, further complicating the possibility of reaching a
renewed agreement.

(Joe Klamar/AP) Strikes could lead to nuclear proliferation

Although Trump claimed the [U.S. [strikes]{.mark} had"obliterated"
Iran\'s nuclear program, initial **intel**ligence
**[assessments]{.mark}** were more cautious, [noting]{.mark} significant
**[damage]{.mark}** but **[not]{.mark}** total **[destruction]{.mark}**
.]{.underline}

Although it maintains ambiguity about its nuclear program , Israel is
seen to be the only country in the Middle East to possess nuclear
weapons. It has taken military action to prevent other countries in the
region from developing nuclear programs.

In 2007, Israel bombed a suspected nuclear reactor under construction in
Syria. In 1981, Israeli fighter jets bombed a nuclear reactor in Iraq .

The Israeli government may have calculated that airstrikes could also
effectively work against Iran. However, the difference is that Iran\'s
nuclear program is far more advanced than Syria or Iraq\'s were. While
the recent strikes may have set the program back by two years , Iran
retains the knowledge and capacity to rebuild.

Ironically, [the Israeli and U.S. **[strikes]{.mark}**, which aimed to
eliminate Iran\'s nuclear capabilities, may instead
**[encourage]{.mark}** Iranian officials [to **accelerate**]{.mark}
their [efforts.]{.mark} Following the war, [Iran ended]{.mark} all
**[co-op]{.mark}**eration [with the IAEA]{.mark} ,]{.underline}
expelling inspectors and cutting off access to its nuclear sites.
Without IAEA personnel on the ground, it has become extremely difficult
to monitor or verify the scope of Iran\'s nuclear activities.

[**[Bombing]{.mark}** Iran\'s nuclear **[facilities]{.mark}** each time
it advances its nuclear program [is **not**]{.mark} a
**[sustainable]{.mark}**]{.underline} strategy. Israel had hoped that a
decisive military strike would trigger widespread unrest and potentially
lead to the Iranian government\'s collapse.

Instead, [the opposite occurred: the [Iranian public **rallied**]{.mark}
[around the **flag** ,]{.mark} perceiving the attack as a **blatant
violation** of national **sovereignty**]{.underline}. As a result, the
[government **strengthened** its domestic **legitimacy** and further
**suppressed** political **opposition**]{.underline}.

For now, Iranian officials have maintained that they do not intend to
develop a nuclear weapon. However, the [Iran]{.mark}ian [parliament is
**[preparing]{.mark}** legislation [to **withdraw** from the]{.mark}
**N**uclear **[N]{.mark}**on-**[P]{.mark}**roliferation
**[T]{.mark}**reaty]{.underline} , of which Iran is currently a
signatory.

[[Exiting]{.mark} the [treaty]{.mark} would [remove]{.mark} a major
legal and diplomatic [**constraint** on]{.mark} **Iran\'s
[pursuit]{.mark}** [of **nuc**]{.mark}lear
weapon**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Should Iran decide to go down that
path, it would likely trigger a nuclear arms race in the region.

[**[Saudi]{.mark} Arabia** has [indicated that if Iran builds]{.mark} a
**[nuc]{.mark}**lear weapon, [it will]{.mark} seek to [do the
same]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The most effective way to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons is
through sustained diplomacy and a renewed nuclear agreement. A credible
deal that includes robust verification mechanisms and IAEA inspections
and sanctions relief remains the most viable solution.

[Military [strikes]{.mark}]{.underline}, by contrast, tend to
**[backfire]{.underline}**, [and will]{.underline} likely
[**[reinforce]{.mark}** the **[belief]{.mark}** in Iran - and
[elsewhere]{.mark} - [that only a]{.mark} **[nuc]{.mark}**lear
**deterrent** can **[shield]{.mark}** them [from]{.mark} **external

[Donald **[Trump]{.mark}** has [signaled]{.mark} that [energy
leadership]{.mark} will also be a **[core component]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} its **[fo]{.mark}**reign and security **[po]{.mark}**licy
[strat]{.mark}egy in his second term. Although the two presidencies'
views could not be more different on accelerating the clean energy
transition, advancing SMR diplomacy in Europe [serves critical
U.S.]{.mark} national **[interests]{.mark}** regardless of
ideology]{.underline}. The strategic rationale focuses on [[economic,
geopolitical,]{.mark} and [tech]{.mark}nological [lead]{.mark}ership
factors]{.underline}. From an economic point of view, the European SMR
market is a significant [commercial opportunity]{.mark} for American
companies. [As]{.mark} European nations seek to [reduce]{.mark} carbon
[emissions]{.mark} and commit to do so [in]{.mark}
the **[[N]{.underline}]{.mark}**ational
**[[E]{.underline}]{.mark}**nergy and **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**limate
**[[P]{.underline}]{.mark}**lans submitted to the European Commission,
the [**[demand]{.underline}** for SMRs]{.mark} is likely to [grow
**[substantially]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [Geopolitically, [SMR
**diplomacy**]{.mark} serves as a **[powerful tool]{.mark}** to
[strengthen]{.mark} the [**transatlantic** alliance]{.mark} and help
[reduce]{.mark} Europe's [energy]{.mark} [dependence on]{.mark} regimes
whose strategic agendas run counter to U.S. national interests, such as
**[Russia]{.mark}**.]{.underline} One must also take into account that
the PRC committed to selling 30 overseas nuclear reactors to its Belt
and Road Initiative partners by 2030 and that Beijing is leading in the
launch of cost-competitive SMRs. [From a [Great Power
Competition]{.mark} perspective, advancing [SMR lead]{.mark}ership in
Europe would [allow]{.mark} the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [to
**shap**]{.mark}**e** [**international** norms]{.mark} and safety
protocols, while [maintaining]{.mark} the [edge of]{.mark} the
high-skilled workforce in the American [**nuclear**
industry]{.mark}. ]{.underline}

Drawing insights from the productive Romanian-U.S. strategic
collaboration in SMR deployment, the new Trump administration may
explore different policy avenues for bolstering SMR diplomacy in Europe.
This may include leveraging U.S. strategic partnership with the Three
Seas Initiative format, composed of countries in Central and Eastern
Europe that are seeking to improve connectivity in transportation,
energy, and digitalization. Such diplomatic engagements in 'minilateral'
frameworks, like the Three Seas Initiative, are essential to promote
U.S. leadership in nuclear energy and identify new partners for SMR
deployment. Furthermore, [the United States must [empower allies]{.mark}
to speak more persuasively to their citizens [about]{.mark} the benefits
of [SMR]{.mark} technology [to mitigate]{.mark} potential
[disinfo]{.mark}rmation campaigns [from **geopolitical rivals**]{.mark},
like the **[PRC]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

2.2 General Attributes of Small Nuclear Reactors

[One of the reasons that [**small nuclear reactor** tech]{.mark}nology
has attracted interest]{.underline} [domestically and internationally
[is]{.mark} that they are [designed to overcome]{.mark} **specific
[concerns inherent ]{.mark}**[to]{.mark} legacy **[nuclear
energy]{.mark} tech**]{.underline}nologies. Broadly stated, [these
[include **enhanced safety features** and]{.mark} shorter permitting and
development timelines]{.underline}. From a safety standpoint, [small
reactors [have an **advantage**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[over
conventional]{.mark} nuclear [power plants]{.mark}]{.underline} [by
incorporating both passive and inherent **safety features** such
as:]{.underline}

1\. **[Passive cooling]{.underline}**. Historically, many of [the [most
notable]{.mark} nuclear power [accidents]{.mark} have [involved]{.mark}
some [failure in]{.mark} the [reactor cooling]{.mark}. This has [led
to]{.mark} a **[meltdown]{.mark}**]{.underline} of the containment
vessel [and]{.underline}/ or fuel and a [release of radioactive material
into the environment.]{.underline} Even though most nuclear plants have
multiple redundant safety features to prevent such an event from
occurring, they rely on active safety features and availability of
electric power to operate. [In contrast]{.underline}, many [[small
reactors rely]{.mark}]{.underline} mostly or entirely [on [passive
safety]{.mark} features [and are **not at risk** ]{.mark}**of
catastrophic failure**]{.underline}. [Instead, the coolant circulates
through the nuclear core by natural convection, eliminating the need for
pumps and]{.underline} thus [**greatly reducing the risk** of an
accident involving a containment breach.]{.underline}

2\. **[[Advanced Fuels]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In addition to reactor
cooling, many [small reactors are designed to use novel fuel
configurations that further [reduce the potential for **environmental
contamination**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, [many developers plan
to use]{.underline} "**[[TRISO]{.underline}]{.mark}**" (TRi-structural
ISOtropic) particle [fuel]{.underline}. Each TRISO particle includes a
uranium fuel kernel that is enclosed within three layers of carbon and
ceramic-based materials. The [entire particle [is]{.mark}
tiny ]{.underline}--- about the size of a poppy seed --- [and
**[virtually indestructible]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They are [designed
to [withstand temperatures well beyond]{.mark} those that will be
encountered during]{.underline} normal [operation or]{.underline} under
[[any **worst-case scenarios**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

3\. **[Factory built]{.underline}**. [[Conventional]{.mark} nuclear
power [plants were]{.mark}]{.underline} traditionally [[built on
site]{.mark}, [which introduced possibilities for human error]{.mark} in
construction]{.underline} and fabrication. [[SMRs]{.underline}]{.mark}
and MNRs [[are]{.mark} designed to be [assembled]{.mark} and tested [in
a factory under **controlled processes**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In
addition to **better quality control**, factory assembly
enables]{.underline} series fabrication with [faster production times at
a **lower unit cost**.]{.underline}

4\. **[Below-grade installation]{.underline}**. In many
[[SMR]{.underline}]{.mark} and MNR [[design]{.underline}s]{.mark}, the
reactor [is [intended to sit below]{.mark}]{.underline} grade [in a
**[seismically robust housing]{.mark}** that is an integral part of the
reactor design]{.underline}. The [[system is
**inherently**]{.underline}]{.mark} seismically [[**stable** and less
likely to be damaged by]{.mark} [any]{.mark} **[natural]{.mark}
phenomena [hazard]{.mark} scenarios**]{.underline}. [Below grade
installation can]{.underline} [[also]{.underline}]{.mark} [[reduce
vulnerabilities to **sabotage** or **terrorist attacks**]{.mark}, since
the reactor is **less accessible**.]{.underline}

Terrorism,"

Nuclear Proliferation

In an influential book, Graham Allison argues that "no new nuclear
weapons states" should be a prime foreign policy principle, and analyst
Joseph Cirincione very much agrees, insisting that nonproliferation
should be "our number one national‐​security priority."5

[[There are]{.mark} good [reasons to **avoid
alarmism**]{.mark}]{.underline} in this area, however. First, [the pace
of nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration [has been]{.mark} **far
[slow]{.mark}er** than has been **commonly predicted** primarily because
the [weapons convey **little advantage**]{.mark} **to their
possessor**]{.underline}. Second, [the **consequences** of such
[prolif]{.mark}eration that **[has]{.mark} taken place** have
[been]{.mark} **substantially [benign]{.mark}**]{.underline}: [those who
have acquired the weapons have "used" them simply to **stoke their
egos** or to **deter**]{.underline} real or imagined
**[threats]{.underline}**.6

And thirdly, the costs of anti‐​proliferation policy have been very
substantial: the number of people who have died as a consequence of
dedicated efforts to contain nuclear proliferation runs well into six
figures.

Pace

Alarmists have been wrong for decades about the pace of nuclear
proliferation. [[**Dozens** of]{.mark} **technologically
[capable]{.mark}** [countries have **considered**]{.mark} obtaining
nuclear [arsenals, but **very few have done
so**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Indeed, as Jacques Hymans has pointed
out, even supposedly optimistic forecasts about nuclear dispersion have
proved to be too pessimistic.7 Thus, in 1958, the National Planning
Association predicted "a rapid rise in the number of atomic powers ...
by the mid‐​1960s."8 A few years later, C. P. Snow sagely predicted,
"Within, at the most, six years, China and several other states \[will\]
have a stock of nuclear bombs," and John Kennedy observed that there
might be "ten, fifteen, twenty" countries with a nuclear capacity by
1964.9

As part of that forecasting, it has generally been assumed that nuclear
weapons would be important status --- or virility --- symbols;
therefore, all advanced countries would want to have them in order to
show how "powerful" they were. Thus, France's de Gaulle opined in the
1960s, "No country without an atom bomb could properly consider itself
independent," and Robert Gilpin concluded that "the possession of
nuclear weapons largely determines a nation's rank in the hierarchy of
international prestige."10 In Gilpinian tradition, some analysts who
describe themselves as "realists" have insisted for years that Germany
and Japan must soon come to their senses and quest after nuclear
weapons.11 [Such punditry has gone astray in part because the pundits
insist on **extrapolating** from the **wrong cases**]{.underline}. A
more pertinent prototype would have been [Canada]{.underline}, a country
that **[could]{.underline}** easily [have had nuclear weapons by the
1960s but **declined to make the effort**]{.underline}.12 In fact, over
the decades, [[a **huge number**]{.mark} **of countries** capable of
developing nuclear weapons have **[neglected even to consider the
opportunity]{.mark}** --- for example, Canada, Italy, and Norway ---
even as Argentina, Brazil, Libya, South Korea, and Taiwan have **backed
away from** or **reversed** nuclear weapons programs, and Belarus,
Kazakhstan, South Africa, and Ukraine have actually **surrendered** or
**dismantled** an **existing nuclear arsenal**]{.underline}.13 Some of
that reduction is no doubt due to the hostility of the nuclear nations,
but even without that, the Canadian case seems to have proved to have
rather general relevance.

To begin with, as Stephen Meyer has shown, [there is no "**technological
imperative**" for countries to **obtain nuclear weapons**]{.underline}
once they have achieved the technical capacity to do so.14 Moreover,
like military prowess in general, [the weapons have **not proved** to be
crucial status symbols]{.underline}. As Robert Jervis has observed,
"India, China, and Israel may have decreased the chance of direct attack
by developing nuclear weapons, but it is hard to argue that they have
increased their general prestige or influence."15 How much more status
would Japan have if it possessed nuclear weapons? [Would anybody pay a
**great deal more attention** to Britain or France if their arsenals
held 5,000 nuclear weapons, or would anybody pay **much less** if they
had **none**? Did **China** need nuclear weapons to impress the world
with its **economic growth?**]{.underline} Or with its Olympics? As
Jennifer Mackby and Walter Slocombe observe, "[Germany,
like]{.underline} its erstwhile Axis ally, [[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark},
[has become powerful because of its **economic might** rather than its
**military might**]{.underline}, [and its **[renunciation of
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}** may even have **[reinforced]{.mark}
its [prestige]{.mark}**]{.underline}."16

[**[Decades of]{.mark} alarmist [predictions]{.mark}** [about]{.mark}
proliferation **chains**, **[cascades]{.mark}**, **dominoes**,
**waves**, **avalanches**, **epidemics**, and **points of no return**
[have proved]{.mark} to be **[faulty]{.mark}**. The
[proli]{.mark}feration of nuclear weapons [has been]{.mark} **far
[slow]{.mark}er than routinely expected** because, insofar as most
**[leaders]{.mark} of most countries**]{.underline} ([even **rogue
ones**]{.underline}) have [considered acquiring the weapons, they have
come to [appreciate]{.mark} **several defects**]{.underline}: [the
[weapons are **dangerous**]{.mark}, **distasteful**, [**costly**,
and]{.mark} likely to **[rile the neighbors]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Moreover, as Jacques Hymans has demonstrated, [the [weapons have]{.mark}
also [been]{.mark} **[exceedingly difficult to obtain]{.mark}** for
**administratively dysfunctional countries** like
**Iran**]{.underline}.17

Consequences

Although we have now suffered through two‐​thirds of a century during
which there has been great hysteria about the disasters inherent in
nuclear proliferation, [the consequences of the proliferation that
**has** occurred have been **substantially benign**]{.underline}. [The
few [countries]{.mark} to [which]{.mark} the weapons [have proliferated
have **quietly kept them in storage**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and haven't
even found much benefit in **rattling them** from time to
time]{.underline}. And [even the **deterrence value** of the weapons has
been **questionable**]{.underline} --- [the major Cold War
participants]{.underline}, for example, [scarcely needed visions of
mushroom clouds to conclude that any replication of World War
II]{.underline}, with or without nuclear weapons, [was a **decidedly bad
idea**]{.underline}.18

Moreover, [[there has **never** been a]{.mark} **militarily
[compelling]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- or even minimally sensible ---
**[[reason]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to **use the
weapons**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [particularly because of an
**inability** to **identify suitable targets**]{.underline} or ones that
could not be attacked about as **[effectively]{.underline}** by
conventional munitions. And [it is difficult to see how nuclear weapons
**benefited their possessors** in specific military ventures.
Israel's]{.underline} presumed [nuclear weapons **did not restrain** the
Arabs from attacking in **1973**]{.underline}, nor did Britain's prevent
Argentina's seizure of the Falklands in 1982. Similarly, the tens of
thousands of nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the enveloping allied
forces did not cause Saddam Hussein to order his occupying forces out of
Kuwait in 1990. Nor did possession of the bomb benefit America in Korea,
Vietnam, Iraq, or Afghanistan; France in Algeria; or the Soviet Union in
Afghanistan.

Other analysts have sounded a much less alarmist tone, however. Some
scholars even suggested that **[a]{.underline}**n Iranian [[bomb]{.mark}
held great potential for **[stabilising]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[an]{.underline} **[unbalanced]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[volatile]{.underline}** [Middle East]{.underline} (Waltz, 2012).
Closer to the mainstream of Western strategic discourse, various experts
have argued that [[despite]{.mark} the **[risks]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[of proliferation, nuclear weapons, and the **[deterrent]{.mark}** they
provide]{.underline} should get (more) credit for
**[[contribut]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing, in combination with other
factors, [[to]{.mark} what has been labelled 'the]{.underline} **[[Long

1945]{.underline} (Gaddis, 1999, p. 268--271; Gavin, 2012a, p. 164;
Acton 2010, pp. 16--17). Still others have contended that [because
nuclear **[prolif]{.mark}**eration [is]{.mark} such a **[rare]{.mark}**
phenomenon, [and]{.mark} since **[robust]{.mark}
nonprolif**]{.underline}eration [[measures]{.mark} **tend** to
be]{.underline} [**[disrupt]{.mark}**ive, [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[net]{.mark} destabilising [effect]{.mark}]{.underline}** [of new

[and, therefore,]{.underline} **[manageable]{.underline}** (Mueller
2010, pp. 95--99; Hymans 2013, pp. 293--296).

The question of whether nuclear proliferation has stabilising or
destabilising effects is not just fascinating for scholars of the
nuclear age, but also highly consequential for practical policy issues.
For in order to debate the merits of particular policy choices -- such
as preventive military strikes against nuclear facilities, grand
bargains with potential proliferators or complete nuclear disarmament --
we need to understand first how the spread of nuclear weapons impacts
regional and global security.

The chapter proceeds in three steps. The first section provides the
foundation for the other parts by summarising what we know about
empirical patterns of proliferation and the utility of nuclear weapons
for statecraft. The second section then engages the literature on the
consequences of proliferation, focusing in particular on how
proliferation has influenced international stability. The final section
explores whether some states have been more affected than others, and
what measures these states have taken to prevent proliferation, or at
least mitigate its negative consequences.

Patterns of nuclear proliferation and the utility of nuclear weapons

Nuclear proliferation is commonly defined as the spread of nuclear
weapons to states that did not previously have them. Within a broader
conceptual framework that is rarely used by scholars, yet popular in the
arms control community, this diffusion of nuclear weapons to additional
states is labelled horizontal proliferation. It is conceptually
accompanied by the notion of vertical proliferation, which refers to
qualitative improvements and increases in the number of nuclear weapons
in the stockpiles of existing nuclear weapon states. In accordance with
the typical usage of the term in the scholarly debate, this chapter
focuses only on how the horizontal proliferation of nuclear weapons
affects international stability.

One important empirical pattern that has shaped how nuclear
proliferation is understood concerns the way in which nuclear weapons
have spread. [The word]{.underline} **[['spread']{.underline}]{.mark}**
[appears to suggest that the **established**]{.underline} nuclear
[powers have]{.underline} [**provide**d]{.underline} [other interested
nations with (at least a few) operational nuclear warheads.]{.underline}
**[Yet such transfers have [never]{.mark} been
[undertaken]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [Certainly, states that sought
nuclear weapons have often received]{.underline} significant
**[assistance]{.underline}** from other nations (Schofield, 2014;
Fuhrmann, 2012), [sometimes in the form of]{.underline} highly sensitive
**[tech]{.underline}**nologies (Kroenig, 2010).
[Nonetheless,]{.underline} since **[all]{.underline}** these transfers
[[remained]{.underline}]{.mark} **[well [below]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[the]{.underline} **[[weapons]{.mark} threshold]{.underline}**, nations
seeking nuclear weapons always had to build them indigenously. Hence,
[in reality, the spread of nuclear weapons has meant that merely the
**ambition**]{.underline} [to possess a nuclear arsenal has
spread]{.underline} to additional states, each of which then had to
pursue that goal primarily through indigenous efforts.

[Importantly, since a state's national [efforts]{.mark} to turn
its]{.underline} **[desire]{.underline}** for nuclear weapons
[into]{.underline} **[reality]{.underline}** [naturally
[span]{.mark}]{.underline} several (and sometimes **[many)
[years]{.mark}]{.underline}**, nuclear **[prolif]{.underline}**eration
[must be conceived of as a]{.underline} **[process]{.underline}**, as
opposed to just a single step (Meyer, 1986). This point is reinforced by
the fact that **[[29]{.underline}]{.mark}** out **[[of
39]{.underline}]{.mark}** states [[that]{.mark} have]{.underline}
**[[embarked]{.underline}]{.mark}** [upon that path]{.underline} (Müller
and Schmidt, 2010, p. 157; Mikoyan, 2012; Santoro, 2017)
[have]{.underline} **[[not acquired]{.mark} a]{.underline}** nuclear
**[arsenal]{.underline}**. Hence, a lot of nuclear proliferation
activity has been undertaken by nations that did not ultimately become
nuclear weapon states. Three patterns explain this situation.

First, [[owing]{.underline}]{.mark} not just [[to]{.mark}
the]{.underline} **[[tech]{.mark}nological]{.underline}**, but also the
[**[institutional]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[managerial
challenges]{.underline}**]{.mark} [of the task]{.underline}, some
[[nations]{.mark} simply **[failed]{.mark} in their
efforts**]{.underline} to build the bomb (Hymans, 2012;
Braut-Hegghammer, 2016). Second, a few countries have chosen a nuclear
'hedging' strategy, intentionally confining their efforts to developing
the technological capability to build an arsenal quickly while
refraining from exercising that option (Narang, 2016--17, p. 134).
Third, [[several]{.mark} states have **[undertake]{.mark}**n a '[nuclear
**reversal'**, **abandoning**]{.mark}]{.underline} [their]{.underline}
nuclear [weapons [activities]{.mark}]{.underline} before developing
nuclear explosive devices (Müller and Schmidt, 2010).

#### Even if ambitions are immediately triggered, the impact is slow and reversible

Other analysts have sounded a much less alarmist tone, however. Some

stabilising an unbalanced and volatile Middle East (Waltz, 2012). Closer

Gavin, 2012a, p. 164; Acton 2010, pp. 16--17). Still others have
contended that because nuclear proliferation is such a rare phenomenon,
and since robust nonproliferation measures tend to be disruptive, the
net destabilising effect of new nuclear countries is quite small and,
therefore, manageable (Mueller 2010, pp. 95--99; Hymans 2013, pp.
293--296). The question of whether nuclear proliferation has stabilising
or destabilising effects is not just fascinating for scholars of the

it**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The reason is **obvious**: [**several
decades** of]{.mark} pessimistic proliferation [forecasts based on
**falling dominoes**]{.mark} were [proved **embarrassingly
wrong**]{.mark} by **history**]{.underline}. Moeed Yusuf notes that if
all the "first tier" suspects for nuclear acquisition identified in such
reports had become weapons states there would be nineteen nuclear powers
today (Yusuf 2009: 61). Instead, as noted above, [the number of
**technically capable** nuclear states has **grown**, while the number
of weapons states has **remained small**.]{.underline} Moreover, [there
was relatively little variation in the number of states in the
"exploration" or "pursuit" phases of nuclear programs during the Cold
War, **[despite]{.mark}** instances of [prolif]{.mark}eration [that
**ought to have caused domino behavior**]{.mark}]{.underline}. After the
Cold War, [[there has been a **striking decline in nuclear
interest**]{.mark}, as more states abandon their programs and fewer
states initiate new ones]{.underline} (Miller 2014a: 10--11).

The judgment of scholars has been scathing. Yusuf concludes that "an
evident shortcoming of historical predictions was their inability to
accurately estimate the pace of developments ... [the majority of
\[potential nuclear dominoes\] **never even came close** to **crossing
the threshold**]{.underline}. In fact, most did not even initiate a
weapons program" (Yusuf 2009: 61). John Mueller suggests that
projections of falling nuclear dominoes "have shown a want of prescience
that approaches the monumental---even the pathological ... \[[fear of a
**nuclear tipping point**]{.underline}\] [continues to flourish despite
the fact that it has **thus far proven** to be **almost entirely
wrong**]{.underline}" (Mueller 2009: 89). Francis [Gavin finds
**[no]{.mark}** "**[compelling ev]{.mark}idence** [that a]{.mark}
nuclear proliferation [chain reaction will **ever
occur**]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Gavin 2009: 18). A two-volume study led
by William Potter and Gaukhar Mukhatzhanova cites a
"[**[consensus]{.mark}** [among]{.mark} the case study
[authors]{.mark}]{.underline} ... [that [nuclear]{.mark} weapons [spread
is neither **imminent** nor **likely**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to involve
a]{.mark} process in which one country's pursuit of nuclear weapons
leads to a '**[chain reaction]{.mark}**' involving other
states]{.underline}" (Potter and Mukhatzhanova 2010: 337--338).

Research also suggests that [even where security concerns matter for
proliferation, their influence is more **diffuse** and
**complex**]{.underline} [than is **generally believed**]{.underline}.
Thus, [even where proliferation causes security fears, it **may not
beget more proliferation**]{.underline}. Phillip Bleek's [[**statistical
analysis** suggests]{.underline}]{.mark} that [nuclear
[acquisition]{.mark} by regional competitors [has]{.mark} **only a
modest effect** on state **exploration** of nuclear programs and [**no
impact** on whether they **pursue**]{.mark} **or acquire [an
arsenal]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In contrast, a state's history of
conventional military disputes with its rivals strongly impacts all
three phases of nuclear development (Bleek 2010: 177). Bleek interprets
these results to mean, in part, that states seek nuclear weapons for a
particular sort of security---deterring attack, not because of security
competition in general. That conclusion is consistent with other recent
studies (Sechser and Fuhrmann 2013: 173--195). Thus, Bleek concludes
that his "[findings **strongly contradict** the conventional '**reactive
proliferation**' wisdom that **underpins widespread predictions** ... of
proliferation **cascades**, **dominoes**, **tipping points**, and the
**like**]{.underline}" (Bleek 2010: 179).

[**Proliferation [alarmists]{.mark}** may occasionally grant that
countries principally obtain a nuclear arsenal to
**counter**]{.underline} real or [**perceived threats**. But many **go
on** to [argue]{.mark} that [the]{.mark} newly [nuclear country
will]{.mark} then [use]{.mark} its [nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s to
**dominate the area**]{.mark}]{.underline}. That argument was repeatedly
used with dramatic urgency for the dangers supposedly posed by Saddam
Hussein, and it is now being applied to Iran.

[Exactly **how** that domination business is to be carried out is
**never made clear**]{.underline}.19 But [the notion apparently is that
[should an **atomic**]{.mark} **Iraq**]{.underline} (in earlier
fantasies) [or **North Korea** or **[Iran]{.mark}**]{.underline} (in
present ones) [**[rattle]{.mark}** the occasional rocket]{.underline},
[[other countries]{.mark} in the area,]{.underline} suitably
intimidated, [[would]{.underline}]{.mark} supinely **[[bow to its
demands]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [**[Far more likely]{.mark},** any
[threatened states will make **common**]{.mark} **cause** with each
other [and]{.mark} with other **concerned countries** against the
threatening neighbor. It]{.underline} thus [seems overwhelmingly likely
that if a **nuclear Iran** brandishes its weapons]{.underline} to
intimidate others or to get its way, [it will find that those
threatened, rather than **capitulating**]{.underline} to its
blandishments [or **rushing off** to build a **compensating arsenal of
their own**]{.underline}, [will **[ally with
others]{.mark}**]{.underline} ([including conceivably
Israel]{.underline}) [[to **stand up to the

[It is sometimes]{.underline} [said]{.underline}, or implied, [that

Summary

[[As]{.underline}]{.mark} some [[state governments explore nuclear
power]{.mark}\'s role]{.underline} in a transition away from fossil
fuels, [state legislatures continue to debate questions of safety and
waste storage]{.underline}. [Although safety concerns may prompt states
to assert authority over nuclear power, [**federal law severely limits**
the extent]{.mark} to which [states can regulate]{.mark} [nuclear
power]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The [Supreme Court]{.mark} has expressly
[held that]{.mark}, while states retain authority over \"questions of
need, reliability, cost, and other related State concerns,\" [**federal
preemption** prevents states from **regulating radiological safety
aspects** of]{.mark} nuclear power [production]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Whether a state law may regulate a part of the nuclear power lifecycle
will depend]{.underline} principally [on whether the [state law]{.mark}
or regulation in question [is **preempted by the A**]{.mark}**tomic
[E]{.mark}nergy [A]{.mark}ct**]{.underline} (AEA). Although there is
\"no one crystal clear distinctly marked formula\" for determining
whether a state law is preempted by federal law, [the Supreme Court has
established three general classes of preemption: **express preemption**,
**conflict preemption**, and **field preemption.**]{.underline} In each
instance, \"the question of preemption is one of determining
Congressional intent.\"

Many legal disputes surrounding federal preemption of state regulation
of nuclear power have centered on field preemption. [Under existing
Supreme Court precedent,]{.underline} an analysis of whether a state law
is preempted under the AEA requires a consideration of both the purpose
and the effect of the state law in question. Thus, [[any state law that
is grounded in]{.mark} **radiological safety concerns** or has a
\"direct and substantial\" effect on the safety of nuclear plant
\"[**construction** and **operation**]{.mark}\" [falls within the field
**exclusively occupied by the U.S. N**]{.mark}uclear
**[R]{.mark}**egulatory **[C]{.mark}**ommission (NRC) [and]{.mark}
therefore [would be **preempted**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

enclave doctrine provides a little known, but potentially powerful,
defense for employers that perform work in federal enclaves because
often [[**only federal law** will apply]{.mark} in those

performed in federal enclaves is significant because *state* employment
laws may give rise to more plaintiff-friendly remedies and longer
statutes of limitations than their federal counterparts. Significantly,
the doctrine has been recognized to preclude state law wage and hour
class actions. In addition, because the doctrine gives rise to federal
law claims exclusively, it may form the basis to remove a lawsuit from
state to federal court.  

This article provides an overview of the federal enclave doctrine,
including practical considerations for the employment law practitioner.

What Is a Federal Enclave?

[A federal enclave is territory, **transferred by a state through
cession** or **consent** to the United States, over which the federal
government has acquired **exclusive jurisdiction.** Once the [federal
government]{.mark} exerts exclusive jurisdiction over a territory, it
can [choose whether state or federal law will govern]{.mark}. The
[source of]{.mark} the federal enclave [doctrine is **article I, section
8, clause 17 of the**]{.mark} **U.S.
[Constitution]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which provides that:

[Congress shall have **power** .]{.underline} . . [to exercise exclusive
Legislation in all Cases whatsoever over such District\[s\]]{.underline}
. . . as may, [by **Cession** of particular States]{.underline} . . .
become the Seat of the government of the United States, and [to exercise
like authority over all Places **purchased** by the Consent of the
Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of
Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, Dock-Yards, and other **needful
Buildings.1**]{.underline}

[For much of the atomic age, the United States led the world in
developing and deploying nuclear technologies]{.underline}. Despite
building the world's largest fleet of reactors---99 of which remain
operational---and seeding most of the designs built worldwide, [US
commercial nuclear development has **dramatically slowed**]{.underline}.
[Indeed, the nuclear power industry now faces
unprecedented]{.underline}---arguably
**[existential]{.underline}**---**[challenges]{.underline}**. The
nation's demand for electricity has decreased, and the power
distribution grid is rapidly becoming decentralized. [Nuclear power is
having **trouble competing**]{.underline} in current deregulated energy
markets dominated by low-cost natural gas and renewable energy sources.
[The industry hasn't been able to build new power plants within budget
and in a timely manner, as recent **efforts in South Carolina** and
**Georgia illustrate**]{.underline}. There are concerns about safety,
waste management, and nuclear proliferation. And efforts to develop
advanced reactors that might meet these challenges have lagged. The
industry can't afford major research and development, and efforts by the
Department of Energy, once a prime mover in reactor development, have
been moribund as a result of inadequate funding and leadership.

[The decline of nuclear power creates **huge challenges** for important
US]{.underline} policy [goals]{.underline} on two fronts. [First,
**national security** experts are debating the consequences of a world
where **China** and **Russia** become **preeminent in
nuclear**]{.underline} science and **[tech]{.underline}**nology, thus
[diminishing the ability of the United States and other western
countries to **set the rules**]{.underline} for controlling access to
nuclear material and technology. In addition to deploying existing
designs domestically and exporting them, [China and Russia have
extensive and **well-financed programs** to develop the next generation
of advanced]{.underline}, non-light water [reactor
concepts]{.underline}, many of which were first demonstrated decades ago
in US national laboratories. Unfortunately, [neither of these countries
has displayed a commitment to maintaining]{.underline} and strengthening
[the **international control regime.**]{.underline}

Second, despite the challenges it faces, [nuclear power remains a
**proven low-carbon tech**]{.underline}nology. [Many energy]{.underline}
and climate [experts think that without a portfolio of low-carbon energy
options that includes]{.underline} at least some [nuclear power, the
nation and the world will be **hard pressed** in coming decades
to]{.underline} sufficiently **[cut emissions]{.underline}** of the
warming greenhouse gases that drive climate change. But those
assessments do not reflect nuclear power's grim realities on the ground.

[Often when US industries have found themselves in especially dire
straits, they have suggested]{.underline} intimate **[cooperation
between the]{.underline}** Department of Defense (**[DoD]{.underline}**)
[and technology vendors to restore their vitality. In the case of
nuclear power, **national security arguments**]{.underline} are being
offered to justify diverting large sums of public money [through DoD to
**catalyze the development** and **deployment** of small modular reactor
(SMR) tech]{.underline}nologies. Such arguments have flowed from a
variety of sources, including the director of research and development
at Southern Company; defense-focused organizations such as the Center
for Naval Analyses, Defense Science Board, and National Defense
University; clean energy experts at Sandia National Lab; and
organizations such as Third Way that include nuclear advocacy as part of
their clean energy program.

Two decades ago, some in the industry recognized that continuing to
build large, complex reactors made little sense. Companies proposed
shifting to a class of smaller systems: small modular reactors with a
nominal power output of less than 300 megawatts of electricity. Their
costs would be both more affordable and more predictable---assuming they
managed to exploit factory fabrication and modular construction, the way
airliners and gas turbines have---somewhat ameliorating nuclear power's
steep economic cost. [In the United States,]{.underline} more than [30
companies are pursuing SMR variants. Most face **monumental
challenges**, lacking as they do the **resources** or **experience** to
proceed. None has a guaranteed order]{.underline} book [that could
underpin the commercialization of either a reactor or its manufacturing
infrastructure. The Department of Energy is helping]{.underline} one
vendor develop a light water SMR plant in Idaho and may consider signing
a power purchase agreement for some of the electricity it generates. It
may also support another project in Tennessee by the same company.
[Despite these efforts, some observers see **DoD as the only institution
capable** of providing a **large enough market** to justify **commercial
production**, at least in the **short term**]{.underline}.

At what cost?

Spending and actions around the world on [**mitigating** climate
change]{.underline} have [**failed** to meet]{.underline} U.N.-set
goals, fueling [[DOD\'s **growing concern**]{.underline}]{.mark} and
attempts to model [[future **instability**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

As the **[[consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}** of climate change
[[grow]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [[required]{.mark} **financial
[response]{.mark}**]{.underline} will also [[grow]{.underline}]{.mark};
military action in the Arctic is one of those consequences.

Although there is no bipartisan support to curb emissions, there is
[[**bipartisan** support]{.underline}]{.mark} for [[responding
to]{.mark}]{.underline} the melting Arctic and
**[[Russian]{.underline}]{.mark}** and China\'s
[[presence]{.underline}]{.mark} with military capability -- though
Arctic spending is not specifically categorized as climate spending in
the National Defense Authorization Act, the bill that funds everything
from soldiers to aircrafts for the DOD.

**[[Less than 1%]{.mark}]{.underline}** -- or about \$3.1 billion --
[[of]{.underline}]{.mark} the funding in this year\'s more than \$850
billion [[NDAA]{.underline}]{.mark} is [[allocated]{.underline}]{.mark}
specifically [[for **climate**]{.underline}]{.mark} change measures.
Those [climate-change **funds**]{.underline} mostly comprise
**[infrastructure investments]{.underline}** for base
**[resiliency]{.underline}** and vehicle electrification projects, among
others.

But that number doesn\'t reflect the full extent of climate change\'s
impact on DOD spending. The unprecedented warming in the Arctic caused
by climate change presents a [**potential** for]{.underline} much,
[[much more **spending**]{.underline}]{.mark} on climate [[due
to]{.underline}]{.mark} the United States\' [[gap in
**readiness**]{.underline}]{.mark}. That gap concerns California
Democratic Rep. John Garamendi, the previous chair of the subcommittee
on readiness, for the passage of the NDAA \'23.

\"The fact is the [[Navy has **no vessels**]{.underline}]{.mark} that
are [[capable]{.underline}]{.mark} of operating in ice and therefore we
**[[cede control]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the Arctic [[to
**China**]{.underline}]{.mark} and **[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
both of whom have [extensive icebreaking fleets]{.underline}, including
Russia with nuclear powered icebreakers,\" he warned.

\"We\'re [[way]{.mark}, **[way behind]{.mark}**]{.underline}. \... We
may, much [to my **disappointment**]{.underline}, have to do a long-term
lease of icebreakers from other countries and repurpose them for our own
Coast Guard and military. And that\'ll come into \[the next\] NDAA.\"

The most recent DOD spending bill requires a report detailing the
feasibility of Navy Destroyers outfitted with icebreaking capability for
the Arctic --- the current ships, without icebreaking hulls, cost well
over \$1 billion each to construct; the 2022 NDAA authorized \$4.9
billion for 3 destroyers.

[**[Ships]{.mark}**, **[aircraft]{.mark}**, **[supplies]{.mark}**,
[infrastructure]{.mark}]{.underline}, soldiers and more [[all **come
into play**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the consistent calls from the White
House, Congress and experts when discussing America\'s response to the
warming Arctic. All of that [[must]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[be
tailored to]{.underline}]{.mark} the conditions of [[the
**Arctic**]{.underline}]{.mark}, including the complicating [[issue
of]{.underline}]{.mark} building on **[[thawing
permafrost]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- the land is sinking as it warms.

None of this is cheap.

[Favorable Public Opinion]{.underline} and **[Bipartisan
Support]{.underline}** is [on the Rise]{.underline}

When I was in the Senate 20 years ago, [public attitudes on nuclear
energy]{.underline} were for the most part negative. That [has
**dramatically changed**.]{.underline} According to a 2024 survey, [the
percentage of Americans who "strongly]{.underline}" or "somewhat
[support" nuclear power rose from 49% to **61%**]{.underline} between
2018 and 2022. While support dipped slightly in 2023, it rebounded to
55% in 2024, reflecting a growing recognition of nuclear power's role in
energy security and climate action.

[**Concerns** over safety, waste disposal, and nuclear proliferation
have **steadily declined**]{.underline}, though cost remains a primary
public concern. However, the [**momentum in policy** as reflected in
last week's executive orders and last year's ADVANCE Act]{.underline},
[investment]{.underline} (see below with private sector commitments),
[and innovation suggest that affordability challenges will be
**mitigated** in the coming years.]{.underline}

In the Senate I learned that [policy frequently **follows public
support**]{.underline}, and that support is especially impactful if it
is bipartisan. [Bipartisan support for nuclear power is **stronger than
ever**]{.underline}. The same 2024 survey found that [**56%** of
Democrats and **62%** of Republicans support nuclear
expansion]{.underline}, [a rare point of **political
agreement**]{.underline}. This was seen in the passage of the ADVANCE
Act last July, which received significant support from both parties. In

The Pele Program's goal of [deploying **MNPPs** to **FOBs**]{.underline}
also [faces **substantial** regulatory hurdles]{.underline} -- at home
and abroad -- [that]{.underline} could [**delay** or **derail**
it]{.underline}. Domestically, the Pentagon envisions at least three key
regulatory milestones: (1) DOE safety approval and testing of one or
more prototype reactors at INL or ORNL by 2023;84 (2) a deployment
demonstration starting in 2024, lasting perhaps until 2027, encompassing
airlifting at least one MNPP with fresh fuel to a remote domestic
government facility, possibly in Alaska, operating the reactor, and then
return airlifting the reactor including its irradiated fuel;85 (3) an
NRC licensing process of about three years, to enable commercial
entities to operate such plants and potentially provide electricity to
the Army via power-purchase agreements. The first milestone is ambitious
enough -- entailing the design, safety review, and construction of at
least one entirely new reactor within four years of the initial contract
award -- but it could be the most plausible of the three steps, because
its challenges are mainly technical not political. DOE's regulatory
procedures involve less public input than do the NRC's, thereby
expediting the process -- although at greater risk of subsequent
technical and political challenges.\
The second milestone, [**airlifting** a reactor to and from a
**domestic** installation]{.underline}, may be
**[unprecedented]{.underline}** and could [face **political
obstacles**]{.underline}. This demonstration is deemed necessary to
avoid making guinea pigs of Army troops, the host country, and any
overflight countries when the first actual deployment occurs. In the
demonstration, the [outbound flight of the reactor would be
**controversial**]{.underline} due to [concerns that]{.underline} a
[**crash** into]{.underline} a body of [water]{.underline} could
[initiate a **chain reaction**]{.underline} in the fresh fuel composed
of HALEU, which is enriched to a considerably higher level than
traditional nuclear powerplant fuel. Even [greater **controversy** would
arise from the **return** flight]{.underline}, [containing hundreds of
kilograms of **highly radioactive** spent fuel]{.underline}, including
plutonium and cesium-137. In the past, domestic ground shipment of spent
nuclear fuel has occurred, [but air transport would pose **different**
and]{.underline} potentially much [**greater** dangers]{.underline}.\
[**Previous** attempts to airlift]{.underline} over the United States a
single component of spent nuclear fuel, plutonium, [have provoked
**intense** public **opposition**]{.underline}. In 1975, the Scheuer
Amendment (P.L. 94-79) was enacted, banning such shipments until
development of a transport cask that could survive a simulated air
crash. The NRC certified a small cask in 1978 for a maximum of only 2 kg
of plutonium, and in 1981 an even smaller cask for amounts up to 40
grams.86 Since that time it does not appear that civilian plutonium has
been flown over the United States in substantial quantities. In 1987,
planned [plutonium air shipments from **Europe** to **Japan** sparked
**controversy**]{.underline} due to anticipated refueling in Washington
state or Alaska. In December of that year, the U.S. government responded
by enacting the Murkowski Amendment (P.L. 100-203), banning such flights
until rigorous certification procedures including an actual crash test
of a cargo aircraft,87 which never took place, so the plutonium
ultimately was transported by sea instead. Interestingly, Sen. Frank
Murkowski of Alaska led the successful campaign in 1987 to block
plutonium air transport into and out of his state, due to fears of
radioactive contamination from an accident, but now Alaska is considered
a prime candidate for test deployment of the MNPP including air shipment
of plutonium.

[Hewett is among a [growing contingent of **liberals**
]{.mark}**embracing nuclear power**]{.underline} as a complement to
solar, wind, and other renewable energy sources. [**Strong [majorities
of Republicans]{.mark}** [and **independents**]{.mark} also [favor
nuclear power]{.mark}, [creating a]{.mark} **surprisingly [bipartisan
issue]{.mark}** in a partisan age.]{.underline}

Today's newsletter explains why both parties have gotten more bullish on
nuclear --- and why it still faces opposition.

[The [liberal case]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Even factoring in the climate costs of building and fueling power
plants, nuclear power [is a]{.mark} **far [cleaner source of
electricity]{.mark}** than oil, natural gas, or coal.]{.underline}
[It]{.underline} also [skirts]{.underline} some of [the downsides of
renewables]{.underline}, such as the acreage required to scale up solar
power, [Hewett said.]{.underline}

It may [[better fit the political zeitgeist]{.mark}, too.]{.underline}
President **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** has called renewable energy a
"scam" and tried to block the construction of coastal windmills. But he
has also signed executive orders aimed at quadrupling US nuclear energy
output over the next 25 years. His [**[budget]{.mark}** would
[**reorient funding** for clean energy toward nuclear
power]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [where his House-passed tax bill would
quickly phase out Biden-era]{.underline} credits for [renewable energy,
it keeps them around]{.underline} longer [for nuclear.]{.underline}

["The **political winds** are at the back of the nuclear industry
now,"]{.underline} Hewett said.

Hewett also argues that [nuclear energy, despite its reputation,
is]{.underline} relatively **[safe]{.underline}**. Yes, there have been
three major accidents over the past four decades, including Three Mile
Island in Pennsylvania, Chernobyl in the Soviet Union, and Fukushima in
Japan. Chernobyl's death toll is disputed, but estimates from the World
Health Organization and others put it in the thousands, mostly from
radiation-induced cancers years after the meltdown. That's a small
fraction of the global deaths each year from extreme heat, more intense
storms, and other consequences of climate change and air pollution from
fossil fuels. [Relatively [new reactor designs]{.mark} could also
**[reduce the risk of accidents]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The conservative case

[Many [Republicans]{.mark}]{.underline} doubt the science of climate
change and prefer fossil fuels to renewable energy; some of their
[**[enthusiasm for nuclear power]{.mark}** may [simply reflect disdain
for]{.mark} liberals]{.underline} [like those who tried to block
Seabrook]{.underline}, said Andrew Cline, who leads the Josiah Bartlett
Center for Public Policy, a free-market think tank in New Hampshire.
"[There's a lot of people on the right who just associate [windmills and
solar panels]{.mark} with Vermont hippies]{.underline}."

But Cline also argues [nuclear power is **[more reliable]{.mark}**
than]{.underline} those [other methods. Solar panels need daylight and
turbines need wind to generate electricity; nuclear power plants can
**operate continuously.**]{.underline}

[[**National security** is another motive]{.underline}]{.mark}. The US
mines little of the uranium it uses to fuel its 53 operational nuclear
plants. But even [importing it [would reduce the]{.mark} country's
[dependence on foreign oil]{.mark}.]{.underline} "[[Some]{.mark} of the
**[conservative affinity]{.mark} for nuclear power** [is that
it's]{.mark} sort of a **[patriotic]{.mark}**, rah-rah American
thing]{.underline}," Cline said.

Especially after the Second World War, and [until the collapse of the

USSR, the end of state subsidies, and outmigration of polar residents
(and in particular the male working age population), shift work has
become more widespread in petrochemical and other extractive industries.
