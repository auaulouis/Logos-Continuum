[Both stratospheric [aerosol injection]{.mark} and [marine cloud
brightening]{.mark} are widely criticized as [pos]{.mark}ing [enormous
hazards]{.mark} on top of climate change itself, while simply
[address]{.mark}ing the [symptoms]{.mark} [not]{.mark} the
[cause]{.mark} of climate change.]{.underline} Stratospheric aerosol
injection---to be delivered to the stratosphere by means of hoses,
cannons, balloons, or planes---[would [alter]{.mark} the [global
hydrological cycle]{.mark} [with]{.mark} [enormous unpredictable
effects,]{.mark} likely leading to [massive]{.mark} [droughts]{.mark} in
major regions of the planet.]{.underline} It is feared that it [could
[shut down the Indian monsoon system]{.mark} [disrupting]{.mark}
[agriculture]{.mark} for as many as 2 billion]{.underline} There are
also worries that it might affect photosynthesis and crop production
over much of the globe. (9) [The [injection]{.mark} of sulfur particles
into the atmosphere [could]{.mark} contribute to [deple]{.mark}tion of
[the ozone layer]{.mark}]{.underline}. (10) Much of the extra sulfur
would end up dropping to the earth, leading to acid rain. (11) Most
worrisome of all, stratospheric aerosol injection would have to be
repeated year after year. At termination, the rise in temperature
associated with additional carbon buildup would come almost at once with
world temperature conceivably rising by 2-3° C in a decade---a
phenomenon referred to as the "termination problem."(12)

As with stratospheric aerosol injection, marine cloud brightening would
drastically affect the hydrological cycle in unpredictable ways[. For
example, it could generate a [severe]{.mark} [drought]{.mark}
[in]{.mark} the [Amazon]{.mark}, drying up the world's most vital
terrestrial ecosystem with incalculable and catastrophic effects for
Earth System stability.]{.underline} (13) Many of the dangers of cloud
brightening are similar to those of stratospheric aerosol depletion.
[Like other forms of SRM, it would do [nothing to stop ocean
acidification]{.mark} caused by rising carbon dioxide
levels.]{.underline}

The first form of CDR to attract significant attention from economic
interests and investors was the idea of fertilizing the ocean with iron,
thereby boosting the growth of phytoplankton so as to promote greater
ocean uptake of carbon. There have been a dozen experiments in this area
and the difficulties attending this scheme have proven to be legion. The
effects on the ecological cycles of phytoplankton, zooplankton, and a
host of other marine species all the way up to whales at the top of the
food chain are indeterminate. Although some parts of the ocean would
become greener due to the additional iron, other parts would become
bluer, more devoid of life, because they would be deprived of the
nutrients---nitrate, phosphorus, and silica---needed for growth. (14)
Evidence suggests that the vast portion of the carbon taken in by the
ocean would stay on the surface or the intermediate levels of the ocean,
with only a tiny part entering the ocean depths, where it would be
naturally sequestered. (15)

Among the various CDR schemas, it is BECCS, because of its promise of
negative emissions, which today is attracting the most support. This is
because it seems to allow nations to overshoot climate targets on the
basis that the carbon can be removed from the atmosphere decades later.
Although BECCS exists at present largely as an untested computer model,
it is now incorporated into almost all climate models utilized by the
IPCC. (16) As modeled, BECCS would burn cultivated crops in order to
generate electricity, with the capture and underground storage of the
resulting carbon dioxide. In theory, since plant crops can be seen as
carbon neutral---taking carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and then
eventually releasing it again---BECCS, by burning biomass and then
capturing and sequestering the resulting carbon emissions, would be a
means of generating electricity while at the same time resulting in a
net reduction of atmospheric carbon.

BECCS, however, comes into question the moment one moves from the
abstract to the concrete. The IPCC's median-level models are projected
to remove 630 gigatons of CO2 from the atmosphere, around two thirds of
the total emitted between the Industrial Revolution and 2011. (17) This
would occur on vast crop plantations to be run by agribusiness. To
remove a trillion tons of CO2 from the atmosphere as envisioned in the
more ambitious scenarios would take up a land twice the size of India
(or equal to Australia), about half as much land as currently farmed
globally, requiring a supply of freshwater equal to current total global
agricultural usage. (18) The costs of implementing BECCS on the imagined
scales have been estimated by climatologist James Hansen---who
critically notes that negative emissions have "spread like a cancer" in
the IPCC climate models---to be on the order of hundreds of trillions of
dollars, with "minimal estimated costs" ranging as high as \$570
trillion this century. (19) [The [effects of BECCS]{.mark}---used as a
primary mechanism and [designed to]{.mark} avoid confrontation with the
present system of production--- would therefore be a massive
[displace]{.mark}ment of small farmers and [global food
production.]{.mark}]{.underline} Moreover, the notion that the forms of
large-scale, commercial agricultural production presumed in BECCS models
would be carbon neutral and would thus result in negative emissions with
sequestration has been shown to be exaggerated or false when the larger
effects on global land use are taken into account. BECCS crop
cultivation is expected to take place on vast monoculture plantations,
displacing other forms of land use. Yet, biologically diverse ecosystems
have substantially higher rates of carbon sequestration in soil and
biomass than does monocrop agriculture. (20) An alternative to BECCS in
promoting carbon sequestration would be to promote massive, planetary
ecological restoration, including reforestation, together with the
promotion of agroecology modeled on traditional forms of agriculture
organized around nutrient recycling and improved soil management
methods. (21) This would avoid the metabolic rift associated with
agribusiness monocultures, which are less efficient both in terms of
food production per hectare and carbon sequestration.

Another commonly advocated technofix, [carbon capture and sequestration
([CCS]{.mark}),]{.underline} is not strictly a form of geoengineering
since it is directed at capturing and sequestering carbon emissions of
particular electrical plants, such as coalfired power plants. [However,
the promotion of a CCS infrastructure on a planetary scale as a means of
addressing climate change---thereby [skirt]{.mark}ing the [necessity of
an ecological revolution]{.mark} in production and consumption---is best
seen as a [form of]{.mark} planetary [geoengineering]{.mark} due to its
immense projected economic and ecological scale.]{.underline} Although
carbon capture and sequestration would theoretically allow the burning
of fossil fuels from electrical power plants with no carbon emissions
into the atmosphere, the scale and the costs of CCS operations are
prohibitive. As Clive Hamilton writes in Earthmasters: The Dawn of the
Age of Climate Engineering, CCS for a single "standard-sized 1,000
megawatt coal-fired plant....would need 30 kilometers of air-sucking
machinery and six chemical plants, with a footprint of 6 square
kilometers." (22) Energy expert Vaclav Smil has calculated that, "in
order to sequester just a fifth of current \[2010\] CO2 emissions we
would have to create an entirely new worldwide
absorption-gathering-compressiontransportation-storage industry whose
annual throughput would have to be about 70 percent larger than the
annual volume now handled by the global crude oil industry, whose
immense infrastructure of wells, pipelines, compressor stations and
storage took generations to build."(23) Capturing and sequestering
current U.S. carbon dioxide emissions would require 130 billion tons of
water per year, equal to about half the annual flow of the Columbia
River[. This new gigantic infrastructure would have to be placed on top
of the current fossil-fuel infrastructure---all in order to
[allow]{.mark} [for]{.mark} the [continued burning of fossil
fuels]{.mark}. (24)]{.underline}

A Planetary Precautionary Principle for the Anthropocene

[If [today's]{.mark} planetary ecological [emergency]{.mark} is a
product of centuries of war on the planet as a **[mechanism of capital
accumulation]{.mark}**, fossil-capital generated geoengineering schemes
can be seen as gargantuan projects for **[keeping the system going by
carrying this war]{.mark}** its ultimate level. [Geoengineering]{.mark}
under the present regime of accumulation **[has the sole objective of
keeping the status quo intact]{.mark}**---[neither]{.mark}
[disturbing]{.mark} the dominant relations of [capitalist]{.mark}
[production]{.mark} [nor]{.mark} even [seeking]{.mark} so much as to
[overturn]{.mark} the fossil-fuel industry with which [capital]{.mark}
is deeply intertwined.]{.underline} [**[Profits, production, and
overcoming energy]{.mark}** [poverty]{.mark} in the poorer parts of the
world thus **[become justifications for keeping the present
fossil-capital system going]{.mark}**, [maintaining]{.mark} at all cost
[the existing capitalist environmental regime]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
Promethean mentality behind this is well captured by a question that Rex
Tillerson then CEO of Exxon Mobil Corporation asked---without a trace of
irony---at an annual shareholders meeting in 2013: What good is it to
save the planet if humanity suffers?(25)

The whole history of ecological crisis leading up the present planetary
emergency, punctuated by numerous disasters---from the near total
destruction of the ozone layer, to nutrient loading and the spread of
dead zones in the ocean, to climate change itself---serves to highlight
the march of folly associated with any attempt to engineer the entire
planet. The complexity of the earth system guarantees that enormous
unforeseen consequences would emerge. As Frederick Engels warned in the
nineteenth century,

Let us not...flatter ourselves overmuch on account of our human
victories over nature. For each such victory nature takes its revenge on
us. Each victory, it is true, in the first place brings about the
results we expected, but in the second and third places it has quite
different, unforeseen effects which only too often cancel the first.(26)

[In the face of uncertainty, coupled with an extremely [high]{.mark}
[likelihood]{.mark} [of]{.mark} inflicting incalculable [harm]{.mark} on
the Earth System, it is essential to [invoke]{.mark} what is known **as
[the Precautionary Principle]{.mark}** whenever the question of
planetary geoengineering is raised.]{.underline} As ecological economist
Paul Burkett has explained, the strong version of the Precautionary
Principle, necessarily encompasses the following:

1)  The Precautionary Principle Proper, which says that if an action may
    cause serious harm, there is a case for counteracting measures to
    ensure that the action does not take place.

2)  [The [Principle of Reverse Onus]{.mark}]{.underline}, under which it
    is the **[[responsibility]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[of]{.mark} those
    supporting an action to show that it is not seriously
    harmfu]{.underline}l, thereby **[[shifting the burden of proof off
    those potentially harmed by the action]{.underline}]{.mark}** (e.g.
    the general population and other species occupying the environment).
    In short, it is safety, rather than potential harm, that needs to be
    demonstrated.

3)  The Principle of Alternative Assessment, stipulating that no
    potentially harmful action will be undertaken if there are
    alternative actions available that safely achieve the same goals as
    the action proposed.

4)  All societal deliberations bearing on the application of features 1
    through 3 must be open, informed, and democratic, and must include
    all affected parties. (27)

[It is [clear that geoengineerin]{.mark}g promoted [in]{.mark} a
[context]{.mark} [of a capitalist regime of maximum accumulation]{.mark}
[would be ruled out]{.mark} completely [by]{.mark} a strong
Precautionary Principle based on each of the [criteria]{.mark} listed
[above]{.mark}.]{.underline} There is a near certainty of extreme damage
to the human species as a whole arising from all of the major
geoengineering proposals. [If the onus were placed on status quo
proponents of capitalist geoengineering to demonstrate that great harm
to the planet as a place of human habitation would not be inflicted,
such proposals would fail the test.]{.underline} Since the alternative
of not burning fossil fuels and promoting alternative forms of energy is
entirely feasible, while planetary geoengineering carries with it
immense added dangers for the earth system as a whole, such a technofix
as a primary means of checking global warming would be excluded by that
criterion, too. Finall[y, [geoengineering]{.mark} [under]{.mark} the
[present]{.mark} [economic]{.mark} and social [system]{.mark} invariably
[involves]{.mark} some [entity from the power
structure]{.mark}]{.underline}---a single multi-billionaire, a
corporation, a government, or an international
organization---[[implementing]{.mark} such [action]{.mark} ostensibly on
behalf of humanity as a whole, while [leavi]{.mark}ng [most affected
parties]{.mark} worldwide [out]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the [decision-making
process]{.mark}]{.underline}, [with hundreds of millions of people,
perhaps [billions of people, paying the environmental costs,]{.mark}
often [with their lives]{.mark}]{.underline}. In short, [geoengineering,
particularly if subordinated to the capital accumulation process,
violates the most sacred version of the Precautionary Principle, dating
back to antiquity: First Do No Harm.]{.underline}

[Eco-Revolution as the Only Alt]{.mark}ernative

As an extension of the current war on the planet, a regime of climate
geoengineering designed to keep the present mode of production going is
sharply opposed to the view enunciated by Barry Commoner in 1992 in
Making Peace with the Planet, where he wrote: If the environment is
polluted and the economy is sick, the virus that causes both will be
found in the system of production.(28)

There can be no doubt today that it is the present mode of production,
particularly the system of fossil capital, that needs to change on a
global scale[. In order [to stop climate change,]{.mark} [the world
economy must quickly shift]{.mark} to zero net carbon dioxide
emissions.]{.underline} This is well within reach with a concerted
effort by human society as a whole utilizing already existing
sustainable technological means---[particularly when coupled with
necessary changes in social organization to reduce the colossal waste of
resources and lives that is built into the current alienated system of
production]{.underline}. [Such [changes]{.mark} could not simply be
implemented from the top by elites, but rather would [require]{.mark}
the [self-mobilization of the entire population]{.mark}, [inspired
by]{.mark} the [revolutionary actions of youth]{.mark} aimed at
egalitarian, ecological, collective, and socialized
solutions---recognizing that it is the world that they will inherit that
is most at stake.]{.underline}

[Today's necessary [ecological revolution would
include]{.mark}]{.underline} for starters: (1) an [emergency moratorium
on]{.mark} [econ]{.mark}omic [growth]{.mark} in the rich countries
coupled [with downward redistribution of income]{.mark} and wealth; (2)
radical [reductions]{.mark} [in]{.mark} greenhouse gas
[emissions]{.mark}; (3) rapid [phase-out of]{.mark} the entire [fossil
fuel]{.mark} energy structure; (4) substitution of an
[alt]{.mark}ernative [energy]{.mark} infrastructure based on sustainable
alternatives such as solar and wind power and rooted in local control;
(5) [[massive]{.mark} [cuts in]{.mark} [military]{.mark} spending with
the freed-up economic surplus to be used for ecological
conversion]{.underline}; (6) promotion of circular economies and
zero-waste systems to decrease the throughput of energy and resources;
(7) building effective public transportation, together with measures to
decrease dependence on the private automobile; (8) [[restoration of
global ecosystems]{.mark} in line [with]{.mark} local, including
[indigenous, communities]{.mark};]{.underline} (9) transformation of
destructive, energy-and chemical-intensive agribusiness-monocultural
production into agroecology, based on sustainable small farms and
peasant cultivation with their greater productivity of food per acre;
(10) institution of strong controls on the emission of toxic chemicals;
(11) [[prohibition]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the [privatization of
freshwater]{.mark} resources]{.underline}; (12) [imposition of strong,
humancommunity-based management of the ocean commons geared to
sustainability]{.underline}; (13) institution of dramatic new measures
to protect endangered species; (14) [strict [limits imposed on]{.mark}
excessive and [destructive consumer]{.mark} marketing by
[corporations]{.mark}]{.underline}; (15) [[reorganization of
production]{.mark} [to break down current commodity chains]{.mark}
geared to rapacious accumulation and the philosophy of "Après moi le
déluge"; and]{.underline} (16) [the [development of]{.mark}
[more]{.mark} rational, [equitable]{.mark}, less wasteful, and more
collective forms of [production]{.mark}]{.underline}.(29)

Priority in such an eco-revolution would need to be given to the fastest
imaginable elimination of fossil-fuel emissions, but this would in turn
require fundamental changes in the human relationship to the earth and
in the relationship of human beings to each other. A new emphasis would
have to be placed on sustainable human development and the creation of
an organic system of social metabolic reproduction. [[Centuries of
exploitation]{.mark} and expropriation, including divisions on the basis
of class, gender, race, and ethnicity, [would have to be
transcended]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The historical logic posed by current
[conditions]{.mark} thus [points]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the necessity of a
long ecological revolutio]{.underline}n[, putting into place a [new
system of sustainable human developm]{.mark}ent aimed at
[addressing]{.mark} the totality of [needs of human]{.mark} beings
[as]{.mark} both [natural]{.mark} and social [beings]{.mark}: what is
now [called **ecosocialism**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Link(s) \-\-- Extractivism

#### Extractive activity in the arctic is a form of resource colonialism that sustains post-industrial capitalism

Helsinki. "Energy development in the arctic: Resource colonialism
revisited". 2018. Handbook of the International Political Economy of
Energy and Natural Resources.

The [natural wealth of the Arctic]{.mark} [is immense]{.mark}. According
to the US Geological Survey, an estimated [13 percent]{.mark} of the
world's [undiscovered oil]{.mark} and [30 percent]{.mark} of [gas
resources]{.mark} are located beyond the Arctic Circle (USGS 2008).
[Mining companies]{.mark} operating in the Arctic are
[extracting]{.mark} a wide variety of minerals, including coal, copper,
diamonds and gemstones, gold, iron ore, lead, nickel, palladium, uranium
and zinc. The Arctic Ocean also contains valuable fish stocks, such as
cod, Arctic char and flatfishes. Given the receding icecaps, which holds
out the promise of easier access to a diversity of Arctic resources, the
global economic landscape has been expected to extend further towards
the High North (Young 2011). Many [countries]{.mark}, including
non-Arctic states, are now [considering]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark} as a
[viable]{.mark} future [source of large-scale energy]{.mark} supplies
[and **[valuable minerals]{.underline}**]{.mark} (Jakobson and Lee
2013). These economic opportunities are sometimes juxtaposed against
concerns over the [degradation of the Arctic's natural
environment]{.mark}, which is [intensifying]{.mark} as the [climate
warms]{.mark} and which, in turn, highlights the need for sustainable
development as a means of protecting the Arctic environment and
improving socio-economic well-being (Einarsson et al. 2004). The
question informing this chapter is, therefore, how possible it is to
pursue sustainable development underpinned by the logic of expansive
commercial resource exploitation? This chapter will focus on the
intertwined politics and economics of Arctic energy to show how ongoing
Arctic developments have been shaped by expectations, decisions and
events taking place outside the Arctic region. It will examine the
incorporation of the Arctic into the international political economy by
framing contemporary [Arctic energy development as resource
colonialism]{.mark}. Resource colonialism is understood here as
[economical]{.mark}ly driven discourses, programs and [policies]{.mark}
that [promote extractive activity]{.mark} on the periphery and are
administratively backed up by an ideology from the center concerned with
the expansion of state power (Young 2001). The origins of new global
resource colonialism can be traced back to historic activities and
interests that have nurtured asymmetrical power relations in the Arctic
resource arena over the past four centuries (Stuhl 2016). This
discussion will reveal how current resource colonialism discourse, or a
totality of ideas, beliefs and practices, that conceives the Arctic as a
space simultaneously 'empty, but full' (Bridge 2001), inherently
contradicts those environmental narratives that inform contemporary
Arctic sustainability discourse DEFINING THE ARCTIC There are many ways
that the 'Arctic boundary' can be drawn on the map and this adds a
degree of complexity to analyzing, governing and understanding the
Arctic political economy. In physical geography the area above the
Arctic Circle (66° 34' N) is commonly defined as the Arctic region,
whilst the northern limit of tree growth (the Arctic tree line) and the
average daily summer temperature below 10° C are among alternative
delimitation criteria used in natural sciences (Smithson et al. 2002).
In global politics, the Arctic usually denotes the circumpolar
territories belonging to the eight Arctic states: Canada, Finland,
Greenland (Denmark), Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United
States. In terms of human geography, the Arctic is inhabited by about 4
million people residing in the area of the Circumpolar North, consisting
of the islands and parts of the continent surrounding the Arctic Ocean.
The Arctic Council, an intergovernmental forum established in 1996 in
order to promote cooperation, coordination, and interaction among the
Arctic states, has adopted a pragmatic governance approach to defining
the Arctic region: the working groups of the Arctic Council create
boundary lines relevant for their particular mandate. For example, the
Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program (AMAP) defines the Arctic in
respect to the area where it carries out environmental monitoring under
the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy, whereas the Arctic Human
Development Report (AHDR) defines a boundary based largely on northern
political units providing relevant socio-economic data.1 Defining the
Arctic is pivotal to establishing a governance regime and structuring
future developments (Koivurova 2010), and it is significant that most
Arctic states have adopted their own definitions of the Arctic zone. The
sub-Arctic territories, or the most northern territories of the eight
Arctic countries, are often included within the 'Arctic region' when it
comes to political matters due to their socio-ecological
characteristics: cold temperatures, darkness, remoteness, and scarce
population. For instance, the US Congress has decreed that all of the
Bering Sea, which extends southward to about 53° N, is part of the
Arctic for internal US planning and budgeting purposes (NOAA, n/d).
According to the Finnish definition, although Finland has no coastline
on the Arctic Ocean, much of its territory lies north of the Polar
Circle, and the whole of Finland takes a keen interest in the Arctic
region as far as the economy, skills and competence, education and
training and research are concerned (VNK 2013). In Russia, a law
defining the southern border of the Arctic Zone was passed in 2014,
enumerating the territories based on administrative units (regions,
provinces, cities) (Presidential Decree 2014). These definitions are
central to domestic discussions over Arctic resource development as they
touch upon issues of land use and land rights, conflicts between local
indigenous populations and the expansive strategies of national and
international energy companies (Stammler and Wilson 2006). Apart from
defining how far the Arctic stretches southwards, the sub-sea rights and
maritime boundaries in the Arctic Ocean represent another strategic
matter for the Arctic littoral states. These issues are regulated by the
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea 1982 (UNCLOS), which all
Arctic states except the US are parties to. Each Arctic state that has
ratified the UNCLOS has a right to claim jurisdiction over a larger area
of the Arctic by demonstrating that its continental shelf extends
further than 200 nautical miles from its shores, which gives the rights
to potentially valuable sub-sea exploration. To make a claim, a country
must submit bathymetric, seismic, and geophysical data to the United
Nations Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf (UNCLCS).
Claims have already been submitted by Russia, Canada, Denmark
(Greenland) and Norway. The International Seabed Authority is
responsible for the administration of extraction from the seabed outside
of the coastal states jurisdiction. At the time of writing, Autumn 2016,
no decision from the UNCLCS on current claims was available. These
multiple, complex definitions of the Arctic demonstrate that often the
term 'Arctic' tends not to convey a strictly defined geographical
knowledge, but rather is used to suit specific scientific or political
purposes at points in time. Defining the scope of the Arctic can be seen
as an attempt to impose social or political order upon the physical
space, but it is also linked to identifying the properties of this space
and constructing its image. The romantic Western imaginaries of the
Arctic as a space for exploration and mastery over nature have been
gradually complemented by narratives of the Arctic as a vulnerable
environment that needs to be protected and preserved (Doel et al. 2014).
In addition, a variety of Arctic communities have their own definitions
and understandings of their homeland (Huggan 2015). Indeed, local
representations, including indigenous peoples and settlers from other
regions, demonstrate diverse and often conflicting interests and images
of the Arctic and its future (Brody 1976; Nuttall 2000). Thus, the
Arctic as a space can be grasped through a range of asymmetrical power
relations revealed by such representations as resourcefulness (right to
conquer and subjugate, exploration, appropriation), remoteness (from the
main centers of consumption, finance, decision-making), and
traditionalism (cultural domination and acculturation, development,
modernization). However, through the lens of resource colonialism
incurred by these representations the Arctic appears largely as a global
resource base. As the next section will show, in the most recent
iteration of [Arctic resource colonialism]{.mark}, the estimates
provided in the US Geological Survey (USGS 2008) [gave rise to]{.mark} a
[world-wide Arctic energy hype]{.mark} (see, for example, Emmerson
2010). 3. ARCTIC RESOURCE ENDOWMENT According to the latest evidence,
humans may have entered the Arctic as long ago as 45,000 years in order
to hunt mammoth (Pitulko et al. 2016), and ever since have continued to
inhabit the area. For many centuries people living in the Arctic engaged
with traditional livelihoods, such as reindeer herding, hunting and
fisheries, and most of the Arctic indigenous communities continue
similar lifestyles today (Nuttall 2000). Yet Arctic riches have also
been attracting people from other places to come and try their luck in
harvesting this natural wealth and the continuity and persistence of
their interests can be captured through considering the history of
Arctic exploration as a part of human energy history. The history of
active Arctic **[[exploitation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in [itself a form
of resource colonialism]{.mark}, was started by Europeans during the
late Middle Ages when they discovered the wealth of Arctic marine
mammals whilst searching for new routes to the riches of the Far East
through the Northeast and Northwest passages (Duarte and Wassmann 2011).
In the middle of the 16th century demand for whale oil grew in Europe,
driven by industrial growth that heavily relied on whale oil as an
illuminant in lamps and as candle wax. Europeans hunted Arctic whales,
walruses and seals for their fur, blubber, skin, and meat so
extensively, that 'from 1669 to 1800, 86,644 whales were killed by
English, Dutch, and German whalers in the seas around Jan Mayen and
Spitsbergen', bringing the population of bowhead whales in the North
Atlantic to the verge of extinction within two centuries (Avango et al.
2014: 20). The shift away from renewable sources of energy continued in
the 19th century, when kerosene from coal (coal oil) and from petroleum
steadily replaced whale oil. Mining in the High North also dates back to
the early modern period, when Scandinavian kingdoms moved northwards to
explore and exploit raw materials (mainly, silver and copper) propelled
by economic and political interests (Naum and Nordin 2013). The real
boom started, however, in the 19th century when the Klondike Gold Rush
brought prospectors and adventurers from all over the world to Alaska
and the Yukon. In the Swedish Arctic, open pit iron ore mining began at
Kiruna in the 1890s and during the same time, as international coal
prices peaked, the first attempt to mine coal for commercial purposes
was made on Svalbard at Bohemanflya in the Isfjorden (Avango et al.
2011; McGhee 2005). Gold, iron ore and coal were not the only desired
resources: in the latter parts of the 19th century, oil prospectors
started their activities in Alaska. Oil production in Alaska dates as
far back as 1911, when the Chilkat oil company built a small topping
plant at Katalla Slough (Naske and Slotnick 2014: 150). By the mid-20th
century, commercial oil and gas production had been pursued in the
Arctic zone of the Western Siberia (Tazovskoe field), Alaska (Prudhoe
Bay Field), and Canadian Arctic Archipelago. During this time, developed
and many developing countries almost completely switched to nonrenewable
sources, primarily hydrocarbons and coal, to meet their energy needs
thereby intensifying demand for fossil fuels and significantly expanding
hydrocarbon industries. This has had particular implications for the
Arctic region, not least a growing appetite for Arctic fossil fuel based
resources. According to the most recent US Geographical Survey
estimates, the Arctic could contain 90 billion barrels of oil, 1,670
trillion cubic feet of recoverable natural gas, and 44 billion barrels
of natural gas liquids (USGS 2008). More than 70 percent of undiscovered
natural gas is thought to exist in three main areas -- the West Siberian
Basin, the East Barents Basins, and Arctic Alaska, and almost 84 percent
of these resources are expected to be offshore. Until recently, only
onshore oil and gas deposits in the Arctic have been explored. Yet
indications given by USGS 2008, together with expectations of sea ice
retreat caused by climate change and high oil prices, peaking at almost
USD150 per barrel in July 2008, have accelerated interest in the
development of the Arctic shelf. Commercial interest in Arctic
hydrocarbons has extended far beyond Arctic states to include interest
from China, Japan, South Korea, India and other Southeast Asian states,
where energy demand has increased by more than 50 percent between 2000
and 2013 (EIA 2015). Until 2015, Russia, Norway and the US were widely
preparing for exploration and production activities in the Arctic
offshore regions, but the oil price fall since late 2014, and the Paris
Climate Agreement at COP21 in December 2015, appear to have somewhat
reduced expectations of large-scale hydrocarbon development in the
Arctic. At the same time, however, interest in Arctic marine
bio-resources has also been growing (Wolman 2016). Whereas 90 percent of
all biomass is in the sea, up until now the use of marine resources has
been marginal. In the future, however, marine animals and plants may
become the primary source of materials for the production of food,
drugs, (bio)fuels, materials and cosmetics (Hoag 2009). The Arctic Ocean
also has significant potential for renewable energy generation,
including use of tidal currents and wind. Thus, one way or another, the
Arctic remains high on the agenda for future energy development, and
both Arctic and non-Arctic states pursue research and development that
could enable harvesting the potential of the Arctic. Whereas such global
interest in Arctic resources is by no means new, the scale and dynamics
of globalization in the Arctic is increasingly intensive (Heininen and
Southcott 2010). For the past four centuries, access to the Arctic has
meant access to [natural resources]{.mark} and, at each given point in
time, the Arctic supplied raw materials that fueled accelerating
historical industrialization in Europe, and later in the North America,
and Soviet Union. The [logic of resource consumption]{.mark} from
deposits distant from the industrial centers that [transform them into
commodities]{.mark} is also, arguably, the primary logic of
globalization as a process of 'materio-spatial expansions and
intensifications, which are driven by historically reiterated economies
of scale made possible by technology' (Bunker and Ciccantell 2005: 9).
The perception of the [Arctic as a global resource base]{.mark} that has
been perpetuated for centuries not only allows for the integration of
the Arctic into the global economy, but also [accentuates resource
colonialism as]{.mark} a set of [economic strategies underlying
post-industrial **[capitalism]{.underline}**.]{.mark} However, if the
questions of Arctic energy development are both economic and political
in nature then important questions remain about who should benefit from
Arctic resource development and who should decide upon the future of
Arctic exploration particularly in relation to the need to maintain the
sustainability of its environment.

Since the sixteenth century and particularly since the Second Industrial
Revolution at the end of the nineteenth century, the [development of
resource frontiers]{.mark} worldwide has 2 M. M. BENNETT
[hastened]{.mark}. This acceleration has been [enabled by]{.mark}
political, economic, and technological [arrangements]{.mark}
[that]{.mark} have become increasingly complex in order to [extract
resources from]{.mark} more challenging and remote [areas such as the
Arctic]{.mark}, a region that can be categorized alongside extractive
spaces like the Amazon, Western Australia, and Mongolia. While such
areas have alternately been [called extractive frontiers]{.mark} (Barsh,
1994; Bebbington & Bebbington, 2011; Priest, 2005), [resource
peripheries]{.mark} (Barton, Gwynne, & Murray, 2008; Hayter, Barnes, &
Bradshaw, 2003; Potter, 2009), [and extreme peripheries]{.mark} (Bunker,
1984), these concepts all [emphasize]{.mark} the [economic primacy
of]{.mark} [extraction]{.mark} and distinct linkages between these areas
and the global economy, even though it is often recognized that
frontiers are heterogenous spaces (Barney, 2009; Ferguson, 2005). Bunker
(1984) characterizes [extreme peripheries]{.mark} [as]{.mark}
'[regions]{.mark} [whose economic ties to]{.mark} the world [capitalist
system are based]{.mark} almost exclusively [on the exchange of
extracted commodities']{.mark} (p. 1020). Similarly, Friedmann (1996)
conceptualizes resource frontiers as formed when the primary reason for
invading the thinly populated margins of the national territory is not
to establish a more or less permanent rural settlement but [to]{.mark}
prospect for, extract, and [export resources]{.mark}, such as minerals,
timber, and hydroelectric power [for the benefit of the
industrial]{.mark} heartlands of the [world]{.mark}. (p. 2) As edges,
peripheries, and liminal spaces, frontiers are typically defined in
relation to somewhere else, usually a core, heartland, or metropole.
Barney (2009) defines resources frontiers as relational spaces not fully
incorporated into the networks of global production and consumption,
while Cleary (1993) and Jepson (2006) see the frontier as a peripheral
region absorbed into or incorporated by expanding capitalist economies.
[External market demands]{.mark} have [motivated Arctic extraction on
land]{.mark} at least since the Siberian fur trade began in the
sixteenth century and at sea since European whaling expeditions set off
for Svalbard in the seventeenth century. One could argue that the
[Arctic resource frontier]{.mark} arose even earlier in the ninth and
tenth centuries, when ivory was exported from Iceland and Greenland to
continental Europe (Frei et al., 2015). Regardless of when the Arctic
resource frontier opened, its linkages with the global economy have
concretized since the end of the Cold War through the construction of
long-distance fixed infrastructures like the Yamal-Europe pipeline
(Saxinger, 2015) and the forthcoming extension of the Canadian highway
system to Tuktoyaktuk, on the shores of the Arctic Ocean. Intricate
global supply chains have also formed such as the shipment of nickel and
copper concentrates onboard a Japanese-built icebreaker via the
Northwest Passage to China from a Chinese-owned nickel mine in northern
Quebec (Nunatsiaq News, 2014). Paradoxically, even as a resource
frontier becomes more connected to the core, its [reliance on extracting
and exporting resources]{.mark} may [cause]{.mark} its relative
[economic peripheralization]{.mark}. Such peripheralization through
connection characterizes the development of places such as Siberia,
termed 'Russia's North Asian colony' (Forsyth, 1994), and Canada under
the British. There, although the exploitation and export of primary
products like fur and later timber promoted national development, it
also caused Canada's ultimate peripheralization relative to the
metropole, Britain (Innis, 1930/1999, 1933). Similar processes may be
occurring within the Arctic on a global scale as the region's fossil
fuels, minerals, and fish are exported to markets worldwide. Realizing
the contemporary importance of resource frontiers within world markets,
Hayter et al. (2003) call for their relocation to the core of theorizing
within economic POLAR GEOGRAPHY 3 geography. They argue, '[Resource
peripheries]{.mark} are [significant for understanding globalization
as]{.mark} a contemporary stage in [capitalist development']{.mark} (p.
19), since [natural resources]{.mark} are crucial for [ensur]{.mark}ing
the future of [global industrial capitalism]{.mark}. Yet Hayter et al.
(2003) only mention in passing one of the key drivers of remote resource
extraction: cities in the global core. Indeed, the term 'resource
periphery' underplays the centrality and connections of resource
frontiers to continued urban growth. While humans have settled in and
altered sparsely uninhabited environments since time immemorial, the
emergence of backward linkages between them and the metropolis and state
is precisely what makes frontiers developments of the modern era
(Richards, 2003). The 'expansion of a metropolitan economy into regions
that had not previously been tightly bound to its markets, and the
[absorption of new peripheral areas into a capitalist orbit']{.mark}
(Cronon, 1991, p. xviii) [underscore]{.mark} the [inseparability of
urbanization from frontier expansion.]{.mark} Whereas urbanization and
the advance of industrial technology were accelerating globally during
the Cold War, they exercised a diminished impact on Arctic extraction
compared to the dominance of military and geostrategic imperatives. This
is not to say that export-oriented resource extraction did not occur in
the Cold War Arctic: even the USSR exported resources from its northern
regions like diamonds from Yakutia and gas from Urengoy (Jensen, Shabad,
& Wright, 1983). But overall, northern extraction was more limited in
scope and scale. It is only since the Cold War ended that global markets
have refocused on the Arctic's raw materials (Doel, Wråkberg, & Zeller,
2014), a shift accompanied by renewed imaginings of virgin frontiers.

In seeking to make sense of the Arctic and its importance during the
first two decades of the twenty-first century, historians and others
turned to the notion of [[extractivism]{.mark} as [a **framing concept**
for]{.mark} these]{.underline} [[transformations]{.mark} wherever they
occurred]{.underline}. It was [never meant to indicate a predetermined
form or stage of development]{.underline}, nor is it the only way one
can imagine responsible resource extraction in the future. Indeed, the
["wastelanding]{.underline}" (Voyles, 2015[) and [environmental
racism]{.mark} that has frequently been the [result of mining
projects]{.mark} in different world regions, and [certainly in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} (Keeling & Sandlos, 2009; Wilson & Stammler,
2016; Kuokkanen 2019), are just some of several potential results of
these activities. So, while alternatives exist, [why are [destructive
consequences of mining **so hard** to avoid]{.mark}?]{.underline}

Part of the reason lies in the deeper historical roots to extractivism
and how it has played out in colonial contexts around the world. [In the
Arctic, [extractivism is underlain by]{.mark} a particular
socio-cultural [orientation toward]{.mark} the [northern
environment]{.mark} that conceives it [as a distant]{.mark} storehouse
of [resources and an extractive frontier]{.mark}.]{.underline} This
perspective has roots (particularly in the European Arctic) in deeply
religious and cultural attitudes toward nature in addition to the
[[incentives provided by]{.mark} the global [manifestations of]{.mark}
European **[capitalism]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Even as we are [moving
into an economy that has already started [de-coupling wealth and
economic growth from]{.mark} the use of [traditional]{.mark} mineral and
fossil-based [resources]{.mark}, resource [extraction in the Arctic is
still caught in the **extractivist**]{.mark} **paradigm** [following
**long historical** lines]{.mark}]{.underline} (McCannon, 2012;
Josephson, 2014; Nuttall, 2017). What we see in the [Arctic is a pattern
of extractivism that keeps [reinventing itself in new guises]{.mark},
[adapting to changing circumstances]{.mark}, and increasingly in tension
with multiple actors and with demands for less intrusive, genuinely
consultative, socially just, and more sustainable
solutions]{.underline}. How and when will this prevailing Arctic
extractivism transform, if not discontinue? Will new extractivist
patterns emerge in industries such as tourism, energy production,
strategic minerals, and marine protein farming, or are other development
pathways possible?

Changing human--nature relationships requires rethinking historical,
cultural, and religious definitions of [[Man's superiority on
Earth]{.mark} and the [perceived human "right" to its
resources]{.mark}]{.underline}. In contrast to ["nature," "resources" is
a [redefinition of "natural things]{.mark}" into objects that are
somehow [deemed more or less useful]{.mark} for humans, and which in the
[capitalist era can be monetized]{.mark}]{.underline}. What these
objects are and what their value is, even that they constitute
"resources," objects of extraction, has changed with time and will
continue to do so (De Gregori, 1987; Bridge, 2009).

Already, the Early Modern revolution of natural philosophy has
legitimized the sense that [Man's destiny is to [**dominate and
exploit** a nature]{.mark} "out there," a [mechanized]{.mark} nature [in
which humans had no part]{.mark}.]{.underline} Man replaced God and put
himself in a position beyond nature. This represented no shift from the
Judeo Christian tradition, however, as Man was seen also in biblical
times as being the steward of Creation, and the benefactor of all goods
that could be drawn from it (as in for instance Genesis 2:19). The
combination of the Christian anthropocentric notion of the world, where
Man is regarded as God's representative on Earth, and the Athenian focus
on the nature of Man and his ability to make sense of the world
constructed a reality where "Christianity absorbed the anthropocentric
dominance views of Platonic-Aristotelian Greek philosophy" (Sessions,
1977: 486). This, in turn, helped pave the way for the future
rationalization of man's utilization of the resources of the planet.
Influential feminist thinkers (e.g., Merchant, 1980) have argued that it
would be reasonable to ascribe the subsequent appropriation of the
natural world to the premise that the observing and acting human subject
was firmly placed -- both epistemologically and morally -- outside of
nature. In a colonial frame of mind, "nature" thus turned into objects
of value ("resources") or "marvelous possessions" (Greenblatt, 1991)
that could be controlled, owned, and exploited.

More recent and more secular ideas about land and resources followed
that underlay colonial extractivist philosophy in the broadest possible
traditions of political theory: Locke on labor, property, and the
[[ethics of resource appropriation]{.underline}]{.mark}; Marx on labor,
[[transformation of nature]{.mark}, and [existential freedom]{.mark}.
The [ethical and philosophical foundations of]{.mark}
[extractivism]{.mark} are found in the very [core of Western ideas of
modernity]{.mark}, and the Arctic is no exception.]{.underline} Over
time, they coalesced into broad [developmental [narratives]{.mark} that
became [embedded in extractivist thought]{.mark}, in the **[physical
domination]{.mark}** of landscapes and its riches, and [in]{.mark} the
relations [to]{.mark} the [people who inhabited it]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Bridge, 2009; Richardson & Weszkalnys, 2014).

These [ideas [sharpened under]{.mark} industrial
[colonialism]{.mark}]{.underline}, resting on an assumption of virtuous
[[transformation of]{.mark} raw [materials to goods and societal
value]{.mark} with little harm of any kind]{.underline}. The
[[unquestionable harm wrought on local communities was justified]{.mark}
with progressivist ideologies]{.underline}, articulated by several
thinkers and, as extraction grew, by theorists of **[[resource-centered
imperialism]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Hobson, 1902) and ideas about
"control of the tropics" (Kidd, 1898), which also included ["control of
the Arctic.]{.underline}" One of the key arguments in this literature
was that since Indigenous populations neither would nor could exploit
natural resources at this scale, it was both the right and a duty of the
"civilized peoples" to do so. Civilization, as articulated by John A.
Hobson, a progressive British economist and in fact a critic of
imperialism, was ultimately characterized by a [[**supreme capacity** to
extract and develop natural resources]{.mark}.]{.underline} According to
this early version of the "gospel of efficiency" (Hays, 1959), wealth
was going to spread across society, including, presumably, the far
north, perceived by the most [wishful visionaries as the [future epitome
of human civilization]{.mark}, [justifiying]{.mark} continued
[hopes]{.mark} and projects [to populate, promulgate, and excavate the
Arctic]{.mark} in a noble "northward course of empire"]{.underline}
(Stefansson, 1922).

[Impacts on nature and on cultures, [transforming]{.mark} both [beyond
recognition]{.mark}]{.underline}, were in the [extractivist ideology
considered largely favorably.]{.underline} "Landscape scars" (Storm,
2014) were the [terraformed evidence of progress in an extractivist
version of the "improvement of the world" idea that had been an
[ultimate **legitimizing imaginary** to guide]{.mark}]{.underline}
British [[imperialism]{.underline}]{.mark} since the seventeenth
century, long referring to agriculture and plantation economics, but in
the nineteenth century [turning decisively industrial and resource
oriented]{.underline} (Gascoigne, 1998; Drayton, 2000). Similar ideas
were advanced in French colonial thought (Rosenblum, 1988).

#### Neoliberal structures are [dependent on the extraction of resources]{.underline}---the rise of [fossil capitalism]{.underline} in the arctic means is inextricably linked to the fabrication and escalation of the climate crisis. Climate movements cam confront green and gray capital schemes to dismantle fossil capitalism structures [and]{.underline} solve the climate crisis.

Shades of capital The climate strike movement's relationship to capital
becomes crucial when considering that the climate and ecological crisis
are predicated upon and driven by fossil capital[. [Fossil
capital]{.mark}, here, denotes both a specific social relationship
between [capital, labour, and fossil]{.mark} fuels, as well as the
[process of fossil-fuelled capital accumulation]{.mark} itself[,]{.mark}
both of which have become constitutive of broader capitalist social
relations]{.underline} since the 19th century. According to Andreas
Malm: At a certain stage in the historical development of capital[,
[fossil fuels become a necessary material substratum for the production
of surplus-value]{.mark}.]{.underline} But they are not merely necessary
as leather for boots, raw cotton for cotton textiles or iron ore for
machines: [they are [utilised across the spectrum of commodity
production as the material that sets it in physical
motion]{.mark}.]{.underline} Other sources of mechanical energy are
pushed to the fringes, while [capital expands in leaps and bounds,
energised by fossil fuels.]{.underline} These have now [become the
general lever for surplus-value production]{.underline}.Footnote37 In
other words, [[any]{.mark} rapid [transition away from fossil
fuels]{.mark} would [pose a significant threat to the stability of the
cap]{.mark}italist system]{.underline}. [Abandoning most existing fossil
fuel infrastructure -- a necessary component of any meaningful response
to the climate crisis -- would expectedly translate into stranded
assets, a grave accumulation crisis, and the unraveling of many of the
social relations that sustain the economic and political status
quo]{.underline}. Most seriously affected by this transition would be
**[[gray capital,]{.underline}]{.mark}** capital that is [directly
[invested in the extraction of fossil fuels and related
industries]{.mark}]{.underline} (such as automobile and heavy
industries). While [gray capital constitutes the most powerful class
fraction within currently existing fossil capitalism, [its very
existence would be threatened by]{.mark} a rapid [transition]{.mark}
away from fossil fuels.]{.underline}Footnote38 Faced with this prospect,
[gray capital has remained staunchly committed to various forms of
climate denial and delay for decades.]{.underline} It has been
extraordinarily successful with this strategy: As of today, most
anthropogenic carbon in the atmosphere has been emitted after the
in-house scientists of Exxon Mobil and Shell first alerted their bosses
to the dangers of global heating more than a half a century ago. [Even
in the decades to come, **[the exploration and exploitation of fossil
fuels is poised to continue just as if the news of the climate crisis
had long been debunked as a hoax]{.mark}**. On the inverse, however,
this also means that any climate movement aspiring effectively address
to climate crisis would have to find a way to directly confront gray
capital, whether]{.underline} through pressuring states to rein in the
power of the fossil fuel industry or otherwise. On first sight, [green
capital seems to be an ally in this struggle]{.underline}. It represents
those sections of capital who have more to lose than to gain from
upholding the gray capitalist status quo. Rising prices for food,
energy, and other raw materials, the rise in frequency of natural
disasters, or migration flows and violent conflicts give an indication
of the gravity with which [an [escalating climate crisis could impact
capital accumulation]{.mark} and the convenience of life even in the
otherwise sheltered realm of suburbia.]{.underline} Faced with this
prospect, green capital is committed to various projects and proposals
that center the modernization of capitalism and the mitigation of the
worst effects of the climate crisis. Such green modernization would
entail abandoning certain sectors of the fossil-fuel based gray economy
and the opening up of new "greener" areas of accumulation to sustain
profits. As Lasse Thiele observes: Tragically, from a macro-capitalist
perspective, a Green Economy scenario may still be preferable to the
accelerated doomsday trajectory of "gray" capitalism -- but
"progressive" factions of the transnational capitalist class, including
the GE \[Green Economy\] institutions, have been unable to effect a
passive revolution in the shape of thoroughgoing ecological
modernization against the resistance of the "gray" factions.Footnote39
Its effective opposition to gray capital has made the climate strike
movement an attractive strategic ally for green capital. There is little
doubt, however, that even the "ecological" modernization of capitalism
as envisioned by the prophets of a greener capitalism would have
devastating consequences for people and planet. Not only has the
actually existing green economy been spectacularly unsuccessful in
mitigating dangerous global heating. Even more concerningly, as Thiele
has argued, it tends to take the form of an economy of additionality --
adding to rather than substituting the fossil economy's dirty
base.Footnote40 Its policies of choice -- carbon trading and carbon
pricing -- in effect amount to attempts at greening fossil capitalism
rather than replacing it. While the [[interests of green capital may
**superficially** seem to converge with the climate strike movement's
cause]{.mark},]{.underline} its voiced opposition to gray capital is not
to be confused with an actual opposition to fossil capitalism itself.
[To the [contrary]{.mark}, the rhetoric of ecological modernization
espoused by many green parties, NGOs, and bus[inesses]{.mark} may even
[help to lend legitimacy to continued fossil fuel extraction]{.mark} by
d[eeming it necessary to guarantee a capital-friendly "transition." The
marketing of fossil gas as a "transition fuel" epitomizes this
dynamic.]{.mark} In the context of the real existing fossil economy,
then, [green capital turns out to be yet another shade of grey,]{.mark}
no matter how progressive it may present itself.]{.underline} The
climate strike movement's unresolved relationship to green capital has
contributed greatly to its inability to force governments to implement
policies that would result in immediate and tangible emissions
reductions (let alone bringing about a climate revolution that would
abolish fossil capitalism). Such reductions would in the short term only
be imaginable by way of some form of economic contraction and thus
neither in the interest of gray, nor of green capital. Instead, the
movement's most significant political outcome, intended or not, has been
a strengthening of the forces of ecological modernization who are
envisioning a long-term, capital-friendly transition away from fossil
fuels that would be inevitably associated with new forms of
externalization and appropriation.

Last month, climate scientists announced that Arctic sea ice had shrunk
to its smallest surface area since satellite observations began in 1979.
An ice-free summer in the Arctic, once projected to be more than a
century away, now looks possible just a few decades from now. Some
scientists say it may happen within the next few years.

The loss is hugely significant because [Arctic sea ice]{.mark} reflects
most solar energy into space, helping to keep the Earth at a moderate
temperature. But when the ice [melts]{.mark} it reveals dark waters
below, which absorb more than 90 percent of the solar energy that hits
them[, leading to faster warming]{.mark} both locally and globally.

Peter Wadhams, professor of ocean physics at Cambridge
University, [warns](https://truthout.org/blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2012/09/21/arctic-sea-ice-what-why-and-what-next/) that
the Arctic may be ice-free in summer as soon as 2015. Such a massive
loss would have a warming effect roughly equivalent to all human
activity to date. In other words, a summer ice-free Arctic could double
the rate of warming of the planet as a whole. No wonder that leading
NASA climate scientist James
Hansen [says](https://www.news24.com/SciTech/News/Planetary-emergency-due-to-Arctic-melt-20120920) bluntly:
"We are in a planetary emergency."

In a comprehensive [blog
piece](https://truthout.org/blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/2012/09/21/arctic-sea-ice-what-why-and-what-next/) on
the Scientific American website, Ramez Naam points out that:

The reality of changes to the Arctic has far outstripped most
predictions. Only a few years ago, in the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change report, the bulk of models showed the Arctic ice cap
surviving in summer until well past 2100. Now it's not clear that the
ice will survive in summer past 2020. The level of sea ice we saw this
September, in 2012, wasn't expected by the mean of IPCC models until
2065. The melting Arctic has outpaced the predictions of almost everyone
-- everyone except the few who were called alarmists.

As well as global warming from carbon dioxide (CO2), there is the
additional risk of warming from methane (CH4) being released into the
atmosphere. Huge quantities of methane are locked up in land permafrost.
But even vaster quantities exist as methane hydrates frozen below the
shallow waters of the Arctic Ocean's continental shelves. Naam warns:

If even [10% of the northern permafrost's]{.mark} buried carbon were
[released as methane]{.mark}, it [would have a heating effect]{.mark}
over the next decade equivalent to ten times all human greenhouse
emissions to date, and over the next century equivalent to roughly four
times all human greenhouse emissions to date.

That's just the methane on land, trapped in the permafrost. If the
methane hydrates buried on the Arctic continental shelves were to be
released, that would have a warming effect equivalent to *hundreds of
times the total human carbon emissions to date.*

Although Namm says "we are probably not in danger of a methane time bomb
going off any time soon", recent observations show that Arctic methane
is being released into the atmosphere. And there is [scientific
controversy](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18120093) over
how serious and how rapid this release is.

In summary, Naam points to a triple whammy effect:

1\. Warming from the greenhouse gases we are currently emitting.

2\. Warming from the loss of ice and permafrost in the Arctic, and the
exposure of dark water and dark land below.

3\. Warming from the release of more carbon into the atmosphere as the
permafrost and the Arctic sea floor methane begin to melt.

The [situation is]{.mark} already [dire]{.mark}. According to [a new
report](https://in.reuters.com/article/2012/09/25/climate-inaction-idINDEE88O0HH20120925) commissioned
by twenty governments, more than 100 million people will die by 2030 if
the world fails to tackle climate change. Five million deaths already
occur each year from [air pollution, hunger and disease as a result of
climate change]{.mark} and carbon-intensive economies. [This death
toll]{.mark} would likely [rise to six million a year by 2030]{.mark} if
current patterns of fossil fuel use continue. More than 90 per cent of
those deaths will occur in developing countries.

On a sane planet, action would have been taken long before now to limit
the risk. But, as Greenpeace International head Kumi
Naidoo [notes](https://www.news24.com/SciTech/News/Planetary-emergency-due-to-Arctic-melt-20120920),
fossil fuel industries have been working hard to corrupt the political
process:

Why our governments don't take action? Because they have been captured
by the same interests of the energy industry.

As we noted in
an [alert](https://www.medialens.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=657:climate-crisis-the-collapse-in-corporate-media-coverage&catid=24:alerts-2011&Itemid=9) last
year, a Greenpeace study titled *Who's Holding Us Back?* reported:

The [corporations]{.mark} [most]{.mark} [responsible]{.mark} [for
contributing to]{.mark} climate change [emissions]{.mark} and profiting
from those activities are campaigning to increase their access to
international negotiations and, at the same time, working to defeat
progressive legislation on climate change and energy around the world.

Greenpeace added:

These polluting corporations often exert their influence behind the
scenes, employing a variety of techniques, including using trade
associations and think tanks as front groups; confusing the public
through climate denial or advertising campaigns; making corporate
political donations; as well as making use of the "revolving door"
between public servants and carbon-intensive corporations.

Unsurprisingly then, meaningful action on tackling climate change is
nowhere on the political agenda.

**Drilling to Oblivion**

Around the same time that a record low in Arctic sea ice was being
recorded, a new report from the UK's House of Commons Environmental
Audit Committee [urge]{.mark}d [a halt to all oil and gas drilling in
the Arctic]{.mark}, at least "until new safeguards are put in place."
Committee chair Joan Walley MP said:

The shocking speed at which the [Arctic sea ice is melting]{.mark}
should be a [wake-up call]{.mark} to the world that we [need to phase
out fossil fuels]{.mark} fast. [Instead]{.mark} we are witnessing a
[reckless gold rush]{.mark} in this pristine wilderness [as big
companies and governments]{.mark} make [a grab for]{.mark} the world's
last [untapped oil and gas reserves.]{.mark}

Caroline Lewis, member of the committee, warned that "the [race to carve
up the Arctic]{.mark} is [accelerating faster]{.mark} than our
regulatory or technical [capacity to manage it."]{.mark}

But the record of [corporate capitalism]{.mark} [shows]{.mark} that
powerful [industrial forces]{.mark} will do all they can to [lobby
governments to allow]{.mark} for [continued economic
exploitation]{.mark} of the planet's resources. According to the US
Geological Survey, [within]{.mark} [the Arctic Circle]{.mark} there
[are]{.mark} some [90 billion barrels of oil]{.mark} -- [13 per
cent]{.mark} of the planet's [undiscovered oil reserves]{.mark} -- and
[30 per cent]{.mark} of its undiscovered [natural gas.]{.mark} The [race
for corporate profits]{.mark} is now on, with Shell already [committed
to a "multi-year exploration program" in the Arctic]{.mark}.

The receding Arctic ice is a "business opportunity" for those wishing to
exploit newly available shipping routes. Cargo that now goes via the
Panama Canal or the Suez Canal will, in many cases, have a shorter
Arctic route, ensuring "efficiency savings" for big business.

Companies are also licking their lips at the prospect at getting their
hands on vast deposits of minerals as Greenland's ice cap recedes.

"For me, I wouldn't mind if the whole ice cap disappears," said Ole
Christiansen, the chief executive of NunamMinerals, Greenland's largest
homegrown mining company, with his eyes on a proposed gold mining site
up the fjord from Nuuk, Greenland's capital. "As it melts, we're seeing
new places with very attractive geology."

A good example of the [psychopathic mind-set at the heart of corporate
capitalism.]{.mark} Science writer Peter Gleick responded incredulously
on Twitter: "25 foot sea rise?" For that is indeed the catastrophic
scale of global sea level rise that would occur with the melting of the
Greenland ice sheet.

These [three events]{.underline} that occurred in the Arctic Zone are
[closely linked to the climate change and the beginning of]{.underline}
the so-called '[Antropocene epoch']{.underline}. The '[Holocene
epoch']{.underline} , the predecessor of the 'Anthropocene', [created a
friendly climate for humans to evolve within and its
biodiversity]{.underline} helped by [bringing the stability of the
entire ecosystem.]{.underline} However, [Earth]{.underline} started to
[[lo]{.mark}se i[t]{.mark}s [balance]{.mark} [due
to]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[anthropogenic factor]{.underline},
[entering]{.underline}]{.mark} [the '**[Anthropocene]{.mark}**
epoch']{.underline}, a [new]{.underline} unofficial geologic [[era
o]{.mark}f]{.underline} colossal [[human-]{.mark}driven
[transformations]{.mark}]{.underline} (Baichwal 2019). Now, the
international community is called upon to [face the [environmental
challenges]{.mark} of the unavoidable **[climate change]{.mark}** [and
**global warming**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The holistic [environmental
degradation]{.underline} as the [sequent of the 'Anthropocene
epoch']{.underline} is the [result of the binary structure **Capitalism
versus Climate**]{.underline} (Heininen 2016, pp.4-6).
[Capitalism]{.underline} is not considered as a part of the ecology, but
it [involves ecology]{.underline}, because its [system **integrates
power**, **capital and nature**]{.underline}. The arrangement of these
relationships through capitalism [concluded to the separation of humans
from the web of life]{.underline}. The [**[degradation]{.mark}** [of
human and nonhuman things revealed]{.mark} an **[ecological
crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which [[cannot be
ignored]{.underline}]{.mark}, since [[c]{.mark}limate [c]{.mark}hange is
a daily live changing event]{.underline} with [[extreme
intensity]{.underline}]{.mark} and frequency.
'[Capitalocene']{.underline}, as this epoch was characterized by Moore
and Patel (2020, p.62), [[exposed]{.mark} the [risks and the
consequences of]{.mark} the [subjugation of human and extra-human
life]{.mark}]{.underline}. Undoubtedly, [previous human civilizations
transformed the environment, but never before through the [fragmentation
of]{.mark} the [interdependence between nature and
society]{.mark}]{.underline} [(]{.mark}p.63).

The [Arctic Circle]{.underline} is considered an [index of climate
change]{.underline} because it is the reg[ion affected mostly and
earlier by the pollution emerging in the industrialized parts of the
world]{.underline} (Tiroch, Wasum-Rainer & Winkelmann 2011, pp.345-346).
In 2015, a [ship]{.underline} of Greenpeace named 'The Arctic Sunrise'
observed, [during operations]{.underline} in the Arctic, that the [rate
of melting of the ice was doubled]{.underline}, resulting in a [massive
discharge of double ice than befor]{.underline}e. Moreover, it is
detected that the [glaciers are shrinking backwards more quickly than in
the previous decades]{.underline} (Avgeropoulos 2011). The first
indication of the anthropogenic impact on the environment was revealed
at the most remote region and the most unique ecosystem of all, the
Arctic. The [danger is now well-established]{.underline}, since the
[permanently locked ice is releasing with a speed of change that exceeds
any in the last 10.000 years]{.underline}. Summer sea ice has been
reduced by 40% in forty years, making the [human imprint truly
profound]{.underline} (Fothergill, Hughes & Scholey 2020). It is
believed that the melting of the Arctic ice will [unbalance the world
ecosystem]{.underline} in such an irreversible way that it may result in
the [disruption of the stream of the Gulf of Mexico,]{.underline} which
will [convert the Northern regions of Europe to uninhabitable and
generate a huge influx of environmental refugees]{.underline} (Palter
2015).

There is no definition of the Arctic Circle that is universally accepted
from a spatial perspective. Some definitions are related with the Arctic
Ocean, which is the smallest one in the world. The Arctic Ocean has an
extent of 140 million of square kilometers and it constitutes only 3% of
the world's total ocean surface area. Its distinctive characteristic is
its extensive continental shelf, which covers the largest space of all
the oceans and reaches a width of 1.200 kilometers in Siberia. This
exact element triggers the difficulties of an agreement between the
Arctic states concerning the demarcation of their boundaries (Marshall
2019, pp.337-338). Other definitions are land-based, which creates even
more complexities to the delimitations between the Arctic states. The
leading criterion is the natural borders, but the range of definitions
is huge. The Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program (AMAP)3 clarifies
that territories below the Arctic Circle, such as Greenland and the
Faroe Islands are also considered parts of the Arctic zone.
Nevertheless, if someone takes into account the extreme climatic
conditions as criterion, then the whole Siberia and large parts of
Canada can also be classified as Arctic. Additionally, Arctic is not
only a geographical space, but a political one. The five states, known
as the Arctic Rim, which have coastal Arctic waters, are the United
States of America, Canada, Denmark, Norway and the Russian Federation.
The two of them, the United States of America and Denmark are not
geographically contiguous with the mainland, but they are included
because Alaska is part of the North American continent and Greenland is
an isolated component of the Kingdom of Denmark (Laruelle 2014,
pp.12-15).

The [Arctic had been a central area of conflicts for]{.underline} the
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates of [A]{.underline}merica
[and]{.underline} the [Soviet]{.underline} regime [during the Cold
War]{.underline}. This fact could potentially add the region in the list
of 'hot' or 'frozen' conflict zones. Nowadays, the
[[Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark} is [presented as the **[new 'Wild
West']{.mark}**]{.underline}. The reason behind the [rise of
competiveness]{.underline} between the Arctic states is the
[[**abundance** of natural resources]{.underline}]{.mark} that are
[[expected]{.mark} to be [revealed through]{.mark} the [melting]{.mark}
of the [permafrost]{.mark}]{.underline}. Furthermore, the [warming of
the Arctic will lead to the opening of new sea routes]{.underline}.
Hence, these two **[[significant economical
potentials]{.underline}]{.mark}** of the region [introduce the [new gold
rush of the 21th century]{.mark}]{.underline} witnessed in the Arctic
region. Consequently, a [[vicious circle]{.mark} is created and
[resource competition]{.mark} is [escalated]{.mark} entering a new
area]{.underline} of the Arctic Great Game (Markowitz 2020, pp.45-47).
On the contrary, some of the [[voices of]{.mark} the [indigenous
peoples]{.mark}]{.underline} living in the Arctic [[speak out]{.mark}
the [**immorality** **of** the **destruction**]{.mark} of the
environment]{.underline} in the name of perpetual wealth seeking.
Indigenous peoples [oppose to the holistic degradation of their
environment]{.underline} in the name of their socioeconomic development
and independence. As they contend: '[[We do not want **our environment
to pay** for our freedom]{.mark}']{.underline} (Avgeropoulos 2011).

Russia is believed to be the least known but the most determined Arctic
player. The country rules the region geographically and has conquered it
historically very early leading the Arctic order in strategic issues.
Geographically, Russia encompasses half of the Arctic coastline, 40% of
the land area beyond the Arctic Circle and three quarters of the Arctic
indigenous populations. Economically, 20 percent of the country's gross
domestic product (GDP) is originated north of the Arctic Circle.
Historically, Russia is the first European power that explored the
Arctic and controlled its land, natural resources and sea routes. The
[[significance]{.mark} of the Arctic area [for Russia]{.mark} is that it
is above all a [domestic issu]{.mark}]{.underline}[e]{.mark}, since it
is an [[economic resource]{.underline}]{.mark}, an [[opportunity]{.mark}
for the [regional development of Siberia]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[new]{.mark} population [settlement]{.mark} and the [evolution
of]{.mark} the [Russian human capital]{.mark}]{.underline} (Laruelle
2014, pp.22-24)

Over a short period since the 1970s, [[indigenous
peoples]{.underline}]{.mark} have been [[developed into a substantial
power]{.underline}]{.mark} and a [[foundation for international
standards setting]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[transnational
linkages]{.underline}]{.mark} and the [[interplay]{.mark} between
[intergovernmental and nongovernmental]{.mark}
organizations]{.underline}. As the [[development]{.mark} of the
indigenous]{.underline} [peoples' [concept
increases]{.mark}]{.underline}, the [[international
disputes]{.underline}]{.mark} over its meaning and implications
[[receive greater legal significance]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
indigenous groups of peoples living in the Russian Arctic are numerous
and their [[human rights]{.mark} situation is [directly affected by the
climate change]{.mark}]{.underline}. Those groups [face multi-year
domestic problems]{.underline}, since they are being [[**neglected**
ever since]{.mark} the [disintegration]{.mark} of the
[Soviet]{.mark}]{.underline} regime. Their [[role as
habitants]{.underline}]{.mark} of the Arctic area, where [climate is
consecutively changing]{.underline}, is
**[[essential]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in the legal and political
context]{.underline} (Kingsbury 1998, pp.414-415).

[The crux of the Anthropocene is]{.underline}, first and foremost, [one
of scale]{.underline}. At first blush it might seem prescient to
attribute to all of humanity the power of a major geological force, but
as a globally defined epoch, [the Anthropocene requires that we consider
the entire global population]{.underline} (and its ancestry) as both
signifier of the sort of geological agency needed to force an epochal
shift and receiver of whatever conditions emerge from such agency[. The
[Anthropocene concept necessarily]{.mark} also [scales up extinction
discourse]{.mark}: the sixth great [extinction encompasses the whole
planet]{.mark}]{.underline}, and so it stands to reason that [humans
become subject to the same globalizing processes]{.underline}. The
[[specter of]{.underline} **[apocalypse]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[[emerges]{.mark} [from]{.mark} the fear that]{.underline} modernity and
its concomitant [[assumption of human exceptionalism are coming to an
end]{.underline}]{.mark}.48 This is not to say that [humans routinely
imagine their future extinction,]{.underline} no matter how bad the news
gets (and humans, incidentally, fall into the "least concern" category
on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's red list), but
the idea takes on greater weight in the face of the anthropogenic
climate crisis.49 [We are now an epoch­ defining species,]{.underline}
and that demands a certain introspection into what species­ being
actually entails. Dipesh [Chakrabarty argues that [this involves a need
to decolonize the term]{.mark}]{.underline}---­ as empire builder and
colonizer, [the West has claimed its history as a sort of [universal
truth]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[obscuring the histories and voices of
the colonized]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and has become [synonymous with
humanity as a whole]{.underline}.50 [[But species thinking in a time of
**capitalist globalization**]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[Western hubris
is bound to become mired in universalist tropes]{.underline}]{.mark},
which must be overturned through attention to scale.51 [The
[perpetrators of Anthropocene dominance]{.mark} and destruction
[are]{.mark} [not the same people who **reap the disastrous
effects**]{.mark}.]{.underline}52 [[To speak of extinction]{.mark}---­
the end of humanity]{.underline}---­ **[[is a
privilege]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[afforded to]{.mark}
those]{.underline} [for whom such a possibility is a long way
off]{.underline}, or even avoidable if one happens [to [be]{.mark}
[rich]{.mark} enough]{.underline}.53 For those [people whose **[lives
are already threatened by climate change]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[extinction might take the form of smaller, but no less devastating,
events.]{.underline}

"[To periodize the Anthropocene is]{.underline} already [to
assume]{.underline} a future world in which human presence on Earth has
been reduced to a lithic layer," states Richard Grusin.54 This viewpoint
assumes that the [Anthropocene will end only when humans as a species
do]{.underline} (a viewpoint I am reluctant to share, as it leaves
little room for imagining a better world) and places the human
extinction event squarely in the future.

Indeed, [the purely prescriptive definition of
**extinction**]{.underline}---­ **[that every last human on Earth will
die]{.underline}**---­ [validates this statement]{.underline}. But when
we begin to draw on other temporalities and scales, a different picture
emerges, one that considers [[extinction as a heterogeneous
patchwork]{.mark} that [does not merely coalesce at a single
poin]{.mark}t in time but also is [arranged discontinuously over
time]{.mark}]{.underline}. In particular, scholars and activists have
drawn attention to [**[Indigenous groups whose lands have been
systematically colonize]{.underline}**d,]{.mark} and to whom
[apocalypse]{.underline}---­ in the sense of the [[destruction of their
livelihoods]{.underline}]{.mark} and cultures---­ means [something much
more immediate]{.underline}.55 Many [Indigenous cultures
have]{.underline} already [experienced]{.underline} the [epochal shift
of ecological destruction and genocide associated with normative notions
of apocalypse in the Anthropocene]{.underline}; the idea of
**[[extinction as a purely theoretical future event, therefore, becomes
a fallacy.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### Profit incentive drives capitalist exploitation and makes destruction of nature inevitable.

Surplus value is the crux of the matter. The theory of surplus value
divides conventional economics, in which capital is a productive factor,
from Marxist theory, in which capital exploits workers to generate a
profit. Surplus value is simply the difference between the value of
output and the value of the labor (power) required to produce it. The
trick, for Marx, was to show that [at equilibrium, where every commodity
exchanges at its rightful value, [surplus value is]{.mark} still
[realized by the capitalist]{.mark}]{.underline}. The necessity of a
surplus is clear: employers would not produce anything if the return
were less than the cost. [**[No exploitation, no profit]{.mark}**. This
[applies]{.mark} equally [to]{.mark} labor and [nature]{.mark}. That
ploughman\'s horse had better produce more in grain than it consumes or
it will be put out to pasture; and the same is true of the wage
worker.]{.underline} The horse and the ploughman or the chemist and her
polymers do more work than they cost, and the difference goes to the
employer. [[Surplus value is a \"free gift\" of extra work time to the
capitalist, who exploits both labor and nature.]{.underline}]{.mark} In
a labor-nature value theory, surplus value is a joint product of labor
and nature working together. [The surplus work is still measured by the
difference between the value embodied in the output and the value of the
inputs]{.underline} (costs of reproducing workers, materials, energy,
etc.). Given this, I find it curious that Moore insists that nature is
not exploited by capital directly, even though he agrees that
[[nature]{.mark} is \"[central to]{.mark} the [production]{.mark} of
surplus value\"]{.underline} (Moore 2015, 93n9). While there\'s no
separate accounting of the surplus extracted from [nature, the free work
it does is embodied in surplus labor time and hence surplus
value.]{.underline} Marx used surplus value as the key to unlock the
mysteries of capital. [Because [surplus value]{.mark} is the [basis for
profits]{.mark}, [capitalist]{.mark}s [have every interest in
exploiting]{.mark} labor and [nature to extract the maximum
amount]{.mark}]{.underline} of surplus value. The simplest route to
obtaining a higher rate of surplus value is \"absolute\" surplus value,
or extending the working day without improving the methods of
production. [**[Absolute exploitation has been ruthlessly applied
everywhere capitalism has taken root]{.mark}**, and Marx was at his most
caustic in denouncing the way industrialists worked people into an early
grave.]{.underline} А second path to making more profit is what Marx
called \"relative\" surplus value. In this case, the value of labor
reproduction falls due to rising productivity in consumer goods sectors,
which lowers the value of labor inputs. The same insight can be applied
to all inputs, including materials and energy. But [why do individual
[capitalists]{.mark} introduce technical change with such a passion? The
firm that [innovate]{.mark}s gains an [extra measure of profit
over]{.mark} its [competitor]{.mark}s]{.underline} (better sales or
lower unit costs), [and one that [fail]{.mark}s [to adopt newer]{.mark}
and better [methods will be driven out]{.mark} of business [over
time]{.mark}. This drive for innovation lay at the root of the
industrial revolution]{.underline}, as both Marx (1967a) and Schumpeter
(1939) argued; [the unrelenting search for better technologies is the
reason why capitalism has been such a dynamic and expansionary
system]{.underline} (Von Tunzelmann 1995).

#### The exploration and/or development done by the plan harms the environmental fragility of the Arctic and accelerates capitalist extractivism.

**[In]{.underline}** the **[[extractive rushes that
follow]{.underline}]{.mark}**ed many of the **[[resource
discoveries]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Indigenous people and northern
settlers found work at the margins of the mining economy, some of it
[**tie**d up **with** **militarization and
securitization**]{.underline}. **[[Effects]{.mark}
[were]{.mark}]{.underline}** mixed but **[often
[negative]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Typically, [**Indigenous** land-based
**economies** were **eroded**, and **communities** **were** **ravaged**
by introduced diseases **and** their traditional **livelihoods** were
**disrupted**.]{.underline} [**[From]{.mark}** the turn of the
millennium **[2000]{.mark}**, **[a]{.mark} more than decade-long [global
"commodities super cycle" drove resource extraction]{.mark}** even
further **[with]{.mark}** an already existing prospect of increased
direct sea routes between expanding Asian economies and **[Arctic basin
minerals and fossil fuels]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Arctic Indigenous
populations, like Indigenous populations elsewhere, are split in their
positions on mineral and fossil fuel resource extraction. Nonetheless,
concerns are deep over extraction practices and their low ethical
standards and over the The Extractivist Paradigm long-term impacts on
Indigenous communities (Lertzman & Vredenburg, 2005; Anaya, 2013; Wilson
& Stammler, 2016). The acknowledgment of losses of independence, agency,
rights, and ownership and control of lands and resources has led to
questions of redress and compensation. Can losses and "scars" (Storm,
2014) in the past be acknowledged so they could "heal" in the future
(Tsosie, 2007)? Could consultation and revenue-sharing (Nuttall, 2017)
be a way to continue extraction and at the same time build community?
This will be another theme of crucial importance for the current volume:
the ethical and [culturalemotional dimensions of
**[extractivism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Each of these histories
**[[is]{.underline}]{.mark}** important, moving, and rich in detail, and
there will be many instances in this volume where we will encounter
individual features of them, because they are also often profoundly
different[, **[linked]{.mark}** as they are **[to legal frameworks and
economic structures]{.mark} firmly [set by national conditions]{.mark}
in the past and the present [over the]{.mark} huge [circumpolar
space]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In particular, this is true of the five
Arctic coastal states -- Norway, Denmark, Russia, Canada, and the United
States -- where boundary zones, such as the Bering Strait, often
brutally underscore the national differences (Dadykina et al., 2017;
Demuth, 2019). From the Early Modern period we find many other nations
also tapping into northern resources (Netherlands, Great Britain, Spain,
Portugal, and Japan), particularly in marine resources that were more
accessible and required less geopolitical muscle, especially around the
disputed territory of Spitsbergen and the high North Atlantic (Bravo,
2006; Avango et al., 2014). Long distance engagement happened to a
smaller extent in terrestrial mining, but was still considerable.
Swedish geo-entrepreneurs and British mining companies were active in
Spitsbergen/Svalbard mining at an early stage, supported in Sweden by
scientists who shaped the politics of prospecting (Wråkberg, 1999;
Jones, 2008; Avango et al., 2014, p. 23), and fueled in Britain by a
"myth of superabundance" (Macadam, 2011, chapter 4), especially of coal
(Avango et al., 2011; Kruse 2016). More recently, China has entered into
mining projects in Greenland and renewable energy production in Iceland.
India, Korea, Japan, and some EU member states claim they can contribute
with technology, logistics, transport, and industrial wherewithal as
resources in the region are becoming more accessible (Hara & Coates,
2014). In this ambition, they make active use of history and precedent,
claiming past Arctic presence through research or historical mining or
whaling (Paglia, 2018). Deregulation has made prospecting a global
market, and transnational companies, often based in Canada and
Australia, operate on multiple sites across the polar cap, except in
Russia, which upholds its resource nationalism on oil, gas, and minerals
stringently (Baev, 2008; Koch & Perrault, 2019). Russia is also very
active in Arctic marine **[[extractivism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as is
Norway (Dale, Bay-Larsen, & Skorstad, 2018) (Figure 1.1). These
variations across time and space are important and will be highlighted
in the chapters of this book. However, it is essential to observe that
there is at the same time a common pattern for the entire region, namely
the [**[dependence]{.mark}** **[of]{.mark}** its extractive industries
on **[developments]{.mark}** elsewhere, around the entire world[, **for
capital, regulation**]{.mark}**, often [labor]{.mark}, [and]{.mark}
[above]{.mark} [all]{.mark} [demand and markets]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
This underscores how well these industries align with Acosta's
articulation and how well they fit the overarching Anthropocene
extractivist paradigm[. **[Arctic
extractivism]{.underline}**]{.mark}[**, its emergence, [and]{.mark}
especially [its]{.mark} recent [growt]{.mark}**[h]{.mark}, post-1989 --
both real and anticipated, sometimes hyped -- **[are]{.mark}
[synchronized]{.mark} [with]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [expansion of
globalizing industrial capitalism]{.mark} [and its
institutions]{.mark}**, and [**especially** **with**]{.mark} its recent
[**acceleration** **and**]{.mark} with [**resource**
**extraction**]{.mark} extending to, and integrated [with, the]{.mark}
aforementioned "[planetary mine]{.mark}]{.underline}." Its geophysical
and environmental impacts in the Arctic itself follow the general
pattern of the Anthropocene elsewhere (ACIA, 2004; Lenton, 2012; Carson
& Peterson, 2016[**). External [demand motivates]{.mark} this [rush for
resources, and markets and consumption]{.mark} elsewhere [swing the
Arctic into its hyper-extractivist role on the world]{.mark} scene**,
figuring, once again, largely [as a resource frontier]{.mark}, boosted
by coastal states and large geopolitical actors such as
China.]{.underline} The Arctic is in this respect part of a much bigger
whole. But it is a significant part because **[[its properties of being
rich in a plurality of extractive resources -- from marine mammals to
strategic minerals to fossil fuels]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- are extreme
by most standards, especially if resource density is compared to
demography and presence of cities and agriculture. [**The
[Arctic]{.mark}** **is** sparse in population and **vulnerable** **to**
**[climate change]{.mark}**, trebling global average **[temperature
rise]{.mark}**, **[and]{.mark}** **rapidly losing summer [sea
ice]{.mark}** (NSIDC, 2020). This [makes **Arctic global processes

**[Arctic]{.mark}** **itself** into [**a** **looking glass through which
the workings of the contemporary world can be seen and**]{.mark}, vice

oversize version.** The **Arctic Anthropocene may be small in numbers,
but it is big in scale, impact,**]{.mark} **[and]{.mark} as a
[specter]{.mark}** (Figure 1.2)]{.underline}. Is Arctic extraction
sustainable? As the world is looking for a transformation away from
fossil fuels and toward a more strategic position vis à vis minerals,
this question must be asked more critically and profoundly than before.
At any rate, the extractivist paradigm is in change and, at least
potentially, in a critical state. The Arctic is therefore a key place in
a key moment to study global resource extraction. The world is destined
to undergo a deep transition from a fossil fuel-based economy to
something that may turn out to be a paradigmatically different phase of
world history (McNeill & Engelke, 2014). The transition will have an
impact on most extractive industries, although in different ways that we
do not yet know. Some industries will likely benefit from the change --
wind and solar power, strategic minerals. Others will likely suffer as
coal does already in many parts of the world, and oil probably will in
the not too distant future. Greenland, an area larger than Europe, with
very large potential resources (USGS, 2008) has already announced it
will no longer allow oil prospecting, and in 2021 a national election
pivoted around the issue of mining (McGwin, 2021). [Indigenous
economies, based on fishing, herding, hunting, and tourism, face an
uncertain future.]{.underline} **[With]{.underline}** the transformation
come not only economic change, political upheavals, or sustainability
challenges but also concerns about social justice as global needs grow
and renewable energy projects end up interfering with Indigenous rights
to herd, while carbon and other natural resource footprints remain
grossly unequal and widening (Alvaredo, 2018). [**Extractivism and the
Anthropocene complement each other** in a lock step fashion. The latter
is largely defined by the impact of mankind on the geological scale and
defined by stratigraphic traces of a certain magnitude and persistence.
**The extractivist paradigm**, on the other hand, can be **defined as
the generic practice**]{.underline} Figure 1.2. Mining in the High
Arctic: The Diavik diamond mine in Canada's Northwest Territories,
approximately 300 kilometers northeast of Yellowknife and 220 kilometers
south of the Arctic Circle. and the economic and ideological
legitimation for the processes that actually create and reinforce the
Anthropocene impact. [The **[extractivist paradigm draws]{.mark} the
[focus]{.mark} [toward]{.mark} the [agential dimensions of the
Anthropocene]{.mark} and [not]{.mark} [just its quantified impacts and
consequences]{.mark}**, such as the transgression of planetary
boundaries or the wounds that extractivist activities left on the
planet**. It [brings to the fore]{.mark} [the need to recognize the
cumulative impact and the consequences for]{.mark} those at the
frontline**. So, the frame here is that extraction is an overarching
driver **[of]{.mark}** the Anthropocene, which also means that it is the
parts of humanity that have been part of **[extractivism]{.mark}** that
are rising to become of particular interest, as the hotspots of global
change. The agency of extractivism, both through demand and consumption,
on the one hand, and through capital and much of the physical extraction
labor has come from particular strata of the world, and only to a
limited extent from inside the region]{.underline}. This has been a
persistent pattern for centuries. **[Extractive
[industries]{.mark}]{.underline}** thus carry a lot of responsibility
for a particular **[[view of the world as an object of
extraction]{.underline}]{.mark}** and the extension of this activity
**[to [include]{.mark} not just [minerals and energy]{.mark} but [also
the various geo-spherical element]{.mark}s [such as the biosphere, the
atmosphere, the lithosphere, the cryosphere, and the hydrosphere. The
technosphere]{.mark} (Haff, 2014) [performs the work required,
and]{.mark} it too now [extends to the Arctic]{.mark}, making its
previous exceptionalism less exceptional]{.underline}**.

With their deep shafts, vast pits, slag heaps and dumps, mining projects
viscerally manifest the destructive and creative power of capitalism.
[**Growing [alarm over]{.mark} the [climate]{.mark} crisis [and]{.mark}
widespread [environmental degradation has not changed the fact that
extractive industries remain]{.mark} central to powering economies and
societies. They sit [at the heart of capitalist enterprise]{.mark}, a
foundational act of "double-alchemy" as "raw geology is liquidated into
energy and money[", creating flows of wealth and waste]{.mark}**
(Bridge, 2015). **[These]{.mark} flows [may be reconfigured by attempts
to replace fossil fuel with green energy,]{.mark} [but]{.mark} they will
not cease in the foreseeable future; [mining and extraction remain
central to]{.mark} the ["green" plans]{.mark} of many
countries**]{.underline} (Jerez et al., 2021; Verweijen and Dunlap,
2021; Voskoboynik and Andreucci, 2021). This special section considers
the profound entanglement of extractive projects with wider capitalist
projects, bringing together articles analysing a variety of political
struggles over extraction amidst capitalism as an "institutionalized
social order" (Fraser, 2017) that articulates differently across time
and space. The articles trace struggles around industrial-scale mining
projects at a variety of scales, from national-level discussions about
the articulation of sovereignty over resources, local protests over
land, jobs and development projects, to individual and family projects
of self-making. They engage with literature in anthropology, geography
and cognate disciplines that, especially since the boom in mining
investment at the turn of the century and the subsequent commodity
"supercycle", has analysed the continued expansion of large-scale mining
in the Global South, consequences of neoliberalization, and the
profoundly unequal geographies of resource production and consumption
(Ballard and Banks, 2003; Bridge, 2004; Bebbington et al., 2008; Kirsch,
2014; Phelps et al., 2015; Conde, 2017; Frederiksen and Himley, 2020;
D'Angelo and Pijpers, 2022). Together, the collection emphasizes that
mining projects are dependent on wider "conditions of possibility" that
enable capitalism more broadly: historical layers of exploitation and
dispossession, the national and international legal coding of capital,
and states' claims to represent the public good and control the
legitimate use of force (Fraser, 2014, 2017; Emel et al., 2011).
Secondly, it demonstrates how mining projects are assembled amid
capitalism, "co-produced" by actors inside and outside mining companies
amid profoundly asymmetric power relations. Their assemblage relies on
multiple government techniques; E. Lochery demands continual work and
investment from a range of actors at different geographical scales.
Mining projects, and the government techniques they involve, are "caught
in different power constellations and timescapes" of capitalism
(Rubbers, 2021, pp. 7--8; Bear, 2015; Bear et al., 2015; Le Billon and
Sommerville, 2017; Li, 2007a). Recognizing the entanglement of mining
projects with wider, historically constituted political orders has
implications for how we model the politics of mining capital, the
spatiality of mining projects, as well as mining projects' impact on
processes of life- and subject-making. Recent work has enriched our
understanding of companies' multi-scalar role in governance, tracing how
they have invested in reshaping the modalities of their engagement with
local, national, and transnational governance, and the range of violent
and "quieter" tactics they employ to manage protest and project
themselves as moral corporate citizens (Frederiksen and Himley, 2020;
Himley, 2013; Rajak, 2011; Benson and Kirsch, 2010; Welker, 2014;
Verweijen and Dunlap, 2021). [However, **[mining]{.mark}** companies
**[are not the only actors involved in]{.mark} this [struggle
over]{.mark} the [wider normative topography and social
imagination]{.mark} of mining**. The case studies in this issue pay
attention to [how **extractive projects are framed, appropriated, and
resisted by a multiplicity of actors, examining how the (re)discovery of
minerals, promises of investment, and the work of mining companies all
enter into political struggles on multiple scales**]{.mark}. Mining
projects do not work in isolation. [They]{.mark} [are]{.mark}
[integral]{.mark} [to]{.mark} wider political assemblages---[projects of
statehood, empire-building,]{.mark} national and subnational economies,
and transnational relationships of trade, finance, and migration
(Klinger, 2017; Riofrancos, 2017).]{.underline} This introductory
article provides a wider conceptual context to the case studies
discussed in the articles. In situating mining projects within wider
political assemblages, I engage with Fraser's (2014, 2017) "expanded
conception of capitalism" , which understands capitalism as an
institutionalized social order in which production and exchange are
enabled by "non-economic" conditions of possibility. **[She builds on
scholarship showing how past and present [processes of expropriation,
dispossession, oppression, and "inclusionary control]{.mark}" (Verweijen
and Dunlap, 2021[) enable capitalist extraction]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(Marx, 1981; Hall, 1980; Harvey, 2003). At the same time, she maps
"further hidden abodes" , beyond the exploitation of labour in
production, that enable capitalism: social reproduction, the use of
nature as an input and waste dump, and the establishment of a system of
law by public powers. [**[Capitalism]{.mark}** depends on these
processes, but **its "[orientation to endless accumulation threatens to
destabilize the]{.mark}se very [conditions of its possibility]{.mark}**"
(Fraser 2017: 157). Beyond Fraser's emphasis on capitalism's background
conditions and tendency towards crisis, I borrow from scholarship
arguing that **[capitalist extraction depends on]{.mark}** constituting
an outside (Mezzadra and Neilson, 2019). The limits and boundaries of
what is deemed outside or other become crucial to the function of
capital, as **[spaces to be enclosed and reordered in the quest for
extraction]{.mark}. Rather than a literal outside, it is the process of
othering and categorizing, mapping divisions and divides, [that is a
central feature of a]{.mark} wider capitalist system---or ["capitalist
world ecology"]{.mark}** , to borrow from Moore (2015).]{.underline}
This introduction explores three ways to contextualize extraction amidst
wider power constellations and timescapes of global capitalism. Firstly,
I focus on how [**[extractive industries]{.mark} simultaneously [power
capitalism]{.mark} [and]{.mark} undermine the conditions of its
possibility---their operations [reveal]{.mark}ing the power but also
[the]{.mark} "[constructedness]{.mark}" [and]{.mark} "palpable
[fragility]{.mark}" [of capitalism]{.mark} (Fraser, 2017; Tsing, 2000).
T[his fragility requires constant management focused on "making,]{.mark}
translating[,]{.mark} suturing[, converting and linking diverse
capitalist projects]{.mark}**["]{.mark} (Bear et al., 2015). I **address
the work that goes into m[aintaining extraction through the production
of policies, templates and tools on a transnational scale]{.mark}---what
Caramento in this issue terms "blueprints" for governing mineral
extraction[. The patterns of confiscation, expropriation and
exploitation central to capital's search for surplus provoke conflict
and struggle]{.mark}**]{.underline}; in response mining companies have
worked with governments and international organizations to manage,
redirect, and repress protest. The The Extractive Industries and Society
11 (2022) 101137 work to protect and expand capitalist extraction has
involved varied reforms aimed at redistributing mining rents and
projecting companies as not just economic but moral actors committed to
sustainable development. The second section of this introduction
considers the spatiality of mining projects, focusing on two terms
central to depictions of the geography of capitalist extraction since
the neoliberal turn: the frontier and the enclave. Unpacking these two
concepts demonstrates the work that goes into linking sites of present
or future extraction to national projects and global markets; mining
projects are justified in the name of the greater good and "abstracted"
from their social and spatial contexts (McAfee, 1999). As the articles
demonstrate, the work of making frontiers and enclaves today does not
literally incorporate territories previously "outside" capitalism.
Rather, mining projects are assembled in historically constituted
terrains shaped by past and present capitalist projects and practices of
forced and wage labour, commoditization and dispossession. The politics
of mining projects are refracted through that history and myriad
projects of government, placemaking and individual and collective
personhood. The third section asks how contextualizing mining projects
amid wider power constellations and timescapes of capitalism affects the
conceptualization of life-making and self-making in the shadow of
extraction. The articles in the special section describe how a variety
of actors inhabit, endure, manage, and critique tensions inherent to
mining and related struggles over social reproduction, the annexation of
nature, and governance and regulation. They recount experiences and
testimonies of those subject to domination through exploitation and
expropriation amid terrains shaped by past and present capitalist
investment. Subject-making is profoundly contextual, contingent, and
unstable.

**of** **cargo, drilling equipment, and petroleum and extend the
seasonal periods in which**]{.mark}]{.underline} such
**[[op]{.underline}]{.mark}**eration**[[s are
feasible]{.underline}]{.mark}**. 22) This environmental opening would
presumably bring down some of the most uncompromising regional barriers
to entry. But if **[[these quickly changing qualities are to be
exploited for their rent-generating
possibilities]{.underline}]{.mark}**, states and firms must know how
best to begin. Emel and Huber (2008, page 1398) point out that
attracting energy investment increasingly depends on states providing
free exploration data or financing private firms\' exploratory
activities to compensate for the geological uncertainties. To this end,
the scientific expeditions to the Arctic seafloor may offer some initial
clues as to the geological potential of particular regions. In a more
explicit case, the US Geological Survey recently completed its first
probabilistic assessment of all undiscovered oil and gas deposits north
of the Arctic Circle. It estimated that the region holds the following
amounts of the world\'s undiscovered resources: 30% of natural gas (1669
trillion cubic feet), 20% of natural gas liquids (44 billion barrels),
and 13% of oil (90 billion barrels) (USGS CARA Assessment Team, 2008).
23) Framing these quantities in probabilistic terms appears to be a
targeted attempt to provide firms with quantifiable justification for
pursuing new exploration. [The long-sought **[possibility of large-scale
shipping through Arctic passages]{.mark}** (see figure 4) also
**[brings]{.mark}** with it [**new** **source**]{.mark}**s**
**[of]{.mark}** DR I. Here, it is physical processes that are changing
the areas qualities and **[rent potentials]{.mark}**. **[Today\'s
shipping seasons]{.mark}** through the Northern Sea Route and Northwest
Passage **[last]{.mark}** between **[six weeks]{.mark}** and two months

Earlier onset dates for spring **[melt]{.mark}** and later fall freeze
may **[add]{.mark}** week**s** or [**months** **to this
window**]{.mark}. 25) **[Routes through Arctic waters]{.mark}** can cut
thousands of miles off of traditional transoceanic shipping voyages in
the Northern Hemisphere, **[increas]{.mark}ing [delivery throughput and
decreasing fuel expenditures]{.mark}**[. **States**]{.mark} like Russia
and Canada thus **[have an interest in controlling routes in their
territorial waters for]{.mark} the purposes of [regulation,
taxation]{.mark}, or both**. The Northern Sea Route, which reduces the
shipping distance from Europe to Asia by up to 40% (Krauss et al, 2005),
will be the first to benefit from decreasing ice cover. But similar
climatic conditions may have diverging consequences contingent upon
geography,]{.underline} 26) For example, due to decreasing stability of
multiyear ice and the resultant increase in iceberg production, the
Northwest Passage and the Canadian Archipelago may remain effectively
locked up for much of the year in the near term. However, a Russian
floating dry dock was successfully towed through the Northwest Passage
to the Bahamas in 1999, demonstrating the navigability of the passage
for large vessels and precarious cargo, and in the summer of 2006 seven
ships-including cruise ships carrying tourists--- successfully traversed
the entire Passage (Huebert, 2003; Struck, 2006). Just as the rents on
agricultural lands depend on the quantity and quality of land under
cultivation, [the [a**ttractiveness of new opportunities for both oil
and shipping are modulated by** ]{.mark}**the global political economy
of oil-that is to say, the [relative cost of oil from other
sources]{.mark}. [Price spikes]{.mark} in 2007 [made cost-cutting
measures indispensable in the transport sector while increasing the
potential return]{.mark}** [**on**]{.mark} new, capital-intensive
**[exploration and drilling]{.mark}** in the petroleum
sector]{.underline}. Amidst complaints of stagnating capacity and
political risks in the petro-states of the Middle East, Africa, and
South America (cf McNulty, 2007) and financial speculation in the midst
of the global economic downturn that drove oil prices to nearly \$150
per barrel, the Arctic once again became an attractive site for
exploration and development of both oil and gas fields. In 2009,
however, the price of oil sharply declined to below \$40 per barrel.
Although the price has been steadily rising since then, it is not a
foregone conclusion that the Arctic will remain an attractive location
if global demand stagnates. The degree to which the oil industry finds
the region attractive also depends on its political and technological
access to other, potentially cheaper sources such as tar sands, oil
shale, and new discoveries in temperate climates. Likewise, in the
shipping industry, it is unclear how high the savings in fuel costs
would need to be to offset the considerable costs and risks associated
with shipping through Arctic waters (where icebreakers will still be
required despite the melt, and where marine insurance premiums are high)
(Young, 2009a). Further complicating issues, a future global climate
regulatory regime could dramatically increase costs and regulations in
both industries. Ironically, a tax on emissions might encourage
fuel-saving voyages through the Arctic while making Arctic energy
extraction economically unrewarding. Regulations or economic incentives
for low-carbon \'green tech\' energy development could also divert
capital that otherwise would have been invested in developing Arctic
drilling technology or financing explora-tion. Finally, the
hypervisibility of Arctic ecological change in the global media could
pose a reputational risk for energy companies operating in the region,
particularly for those attempting to establish themselves as leaders in
renewable energy alternatives. 27) The global media currency of the
region also raises the stakes involved in managing fallout from
accidents such as oil spills, which are more likely to occur in icy
waters. 4.3 Monopoly rents on \'security\' While images of a desperately
vulnerable Arctic propagate through global environmental circles,
political leaders in the region are attempting a different
reconfiguration of image politics. Regardless of whether the US
Geological Survey predictions of recoverable reserves are accurate, 28)
the Arctic supply is of critical symbolic and strategic importance. As
when Arctic hydrocarbons in Prudhoe Bay first captivated the ambitions
of the Western energy industry in the late 1960s, the current global
supply picture is haunted by the specters of political instability and
overzealous landlord states prone to nationalizing hydrocarbon reserves.
Countries able to offer politically stable access to reserves with the
backing of the state are specially positioned to garner a sort of
monopoly rent. The government of neoconservative Canadian Prime Minister
Stephen Harper, for one, has grasped the political potential for growth.
2) It has adopted a new strategy for branding Canada- the world\'s fifth
largest energy exporter-as a uniquely \'safe\', reliable, and democratic
energy source that operates according to free-market principles, \"not
self-serving monopolistic political strategies\" (Harper, 2006). The
strategy plays up the country\'s energy-rich North, while
differentiating it from state-interventionist Russia, Middle Eastern
OPEC-controlled sources, and notoriously \'unstable\' African countries
increasingly courted by the Chinese. 4.4 Capital, technology, and fixed
investments Classically, a second kind of differential rent arises from
the increased productivity resulting from the application of capital. In
short, investments that improve the qualities of the \'land\' demand
their own return, a fact that has not eluded entrepreneurs in the
Arctic. [Thanks to **[neoliberal reforms and climatic changes, investors
are engaged in a wave of anticipatory development on both sides
of]{.mark}**]{.underline} a third trans-[[**Arctic route**,]{.mark}
dubbed the Arctic Bridge. The route connects the ports of Murmansk,
Russia, and Churchill, Manitoba, where rail lines begin and stretch as
far south as Monterrey, Mexico. The voyage from Murmansk to Churchill
takes roughly half the time of the typical route from Murmansk through
the St Lawrence to Thunder Bay, Ontario (eight versus seventeen days)
(Krauss et al, 2005). **[Recent]{.mark}** rounds of denationalization
and infrastructural **[privatization]{.mark}**]{.underline} in [Russia
and Canada have **[left]{.mark}** both **the** Murmansk Shipping Company
(as of yet, the only operation outfitted for trans-**[Arctic]{.mark}**
shipping from Murmansk) and the **[port]{.mark}** of Churchill
**[and]{.mark}** its associated [**railways** **in the hands of
entrepreneurs**]{.mark}]{.underline}. American investor Pat Broe\'s
railroad company OmniTrax purchased the port of Churchill from Canada in
1997, paying only 10 Canadian dollars at auction; earlier it bought 810
miles of denationalized rail track in Manitoba for \$11 million (Krauss
et al, 2005). Again, much like the territorial claims of states, these
investments are conjectural; although they may put their owners in ideal
positions to extract rents and profit from an Arctic boom, this is far
from assured. Although wheat producers ship many hundreds of thousands
of tons of grain annually from Churchill to Murmansk and other buyers in
Europe, the port had not received any Russian shipments until October
2007, when a Russian vessel delivered fertilizer purchased by a group of
Saskatchewan farmers (Friesen, 2007). Churchill\'s port is open only
from July through November, but boosters say it could have a longer
season if insurers would recognize that ice conditions have changed and
reconfigure their maritime policies accordingly. 30) They also project a
bright future for the port as an importer of Eurasian oil and gas,
though current shipments are limited to bulk dry commodities and
agricultural machinery. Increased energy exploration and extraction
bring with them a demand for more infrastructure in the form of ports,
ships, storage facilities, and pipelines. The ocean\'s iceberg-filled
waters also pose unique demands and opportunities for the ship
construction industry to produce double-hulled tankers and icebreakers,
which can cost millions more than ordinary seafaring ships (Madslien,
2005). Deep-water drilling rigs destined for the Arctic must be
specially equipped with ice-breaking capabilities, high wave
stabilization, and insulation from polar temperatures. One such ship was
recently ordered for \$942 million, roughly \$500 million more than the
going rate for temperate deep-water rigs (Mouawad and Fackler, 2008).
The financial apparatuses of export/import banks, credit, and insurance
must also be extended to facilitate these developments. Arctic pursuits
require greater outlays of financial capital to fund long-term
infrastructure and exploration projects, and the costs to insure these
ventures are especially high given the high risk of environmental
disaster and damage to equipment. 5 Conclusion: precarious coincidence
and emergent properties \"\[Elvery participator knows that the
thunderstorm will come sooner or later, but every one expects that the
lightning will fall on the head of his neighbour, after he himself shall
have had time to collect the golden rain and store it up safely. Après
moi le déluge! is the battle-cry of every capitalist and of every
capitalist nation.\" Karl Marx (1967 \[1867\], page 269) Whether these
investments will succeed in terms of accumulation remains to be seen. At
this juncture it is difficult to determine whether the contracts to
develop the region will generate productive capacity or are overly
optimistic speculation. Since rent is paid to landowners from the
surplus value accruing from production, if any rents are to be realized,
production must actually occur. A tremendous number of factors must
coalesce, including physical environments, successful energy exploration
and extraction, supportive governments, and permissive climate and/or
carbon regimes. Even [if impressive economic returns result from the
current investments being made in the Arctic, a theoretical accounting
of accumulation by degradation would be incomplete if it stopped with
the observation that the externalities put \'to work\' for capital in
the Arctic may combat a profit squeeze on the supply side by lowering
costs and decreasing turnover times. Although this may well be true in
the short term, its simplicity is economistic]{.underline}. The entire
Arctic conjuncture depends on a rather precarious coincidence of
commodity prices, international regulatory regimes, entre-preneurialism,
territorial sovereignty, and fundamentally uncontrollable physical
processes across many operational scales. This final factor is, in my
view, the most likely to derail the recursive cycling of factors of
production, accumulation, and external costs diagramed in figure 2
above. For myriad reasons, there is no just [[doing business\' in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}, be it construction or energy or banking.
The turnover times of capital must be somehow reconciled with the
materiality of the Earth\'s turnover times ---annual cycles of
temperature, melt and freeze, light and dark ---that reach their
extremes at the poles. Here, more so than in many other places,
biophysical nature must be a party to the process of expanded
reproduction, and it is not always an agreeable or predictable
ally-particularly as it becomes more environmentally degraded through
the cycles of accumulation by degradation. These possibilities and
perils for capital in the Arctic **[[require an engagement
with]{.underline}]{.mark}** the argument that
**[[capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** will always manage to accumulate
its way through crisis, barring human extinction (of Clark and York,
2005; Foster, 2002). The Arctic case demonstrates that, for the time
being, segments of capital may be able to instrumentalize these
externalities to hold down production costs, all the while reorganizing
themselves as multistrategy energy companies with corporate visions
\'Beyond Petroleum. The question of how long this pattern can go on is,
of course, the crucial one, which I think depends largely on properties
of climate and biogeochemical systems that are as of yet unknown. (3L)
Much of the debate regarding the inevitability (or not) of an
environmentally sourced economic crisis for capitalism turns on
divergent spatial and temporal scales at which crisis is defined: the
tensions between short-term versus long-term profitability, sectors
versus capital as a whole, regional versus global ecological debts, and
so on. I find the infinite regress of this argument to be unrewarding,
particularly given the pressing need to grapple with the possibility of
nonlinear, emergent behaviors of socionatural systems. I find it
untenable to simply assume that capital will continue to be logistically
able to exploit uneven development, and that nature will keep behaving
in essentially predictable and manageable ways-for example, that carbon
sinks will continue to uptake excess atmospheric COz and that the
terrestrial biosphere will not transition from a carbon sink to source
(cf Joos et al, 2001).

#### Diseases cause extinction

[Invading [infectious diseases]{.mark} can, in theory, [lead to the
extinction]{.mark} of host populations]{.underline}, particularly if
reservoir species are present or if disease transmission is
frequency-dependent. The number of historic or prehistoric extinctions
that can unequivocally be attributed to infectious disease is relatively
small, but gathering firm evidence in retrospect is extremely difficult.
[Amphibian chytridiomycosis and Tasmanian devil facial tumour disease
[(DFTD)]{.mark} are two very different [infectious disease]{.mark}s that
are [currently threatening]{.mark} to cause
[extinction]{.mark}s]{.underline} in Australia. [These provide an
unusual opportunity to investigate the processes of disease-induced
extinction]{.underline} and possible management strategies. Both
diseases are apparently recent in origin. [Tasmanian [DFTD]{.mark} is
entirely [host-specific]{.mark} but potentially [able to cause
extinction because transmission depends weakly,]{.mark} if at all, [on
host density.]{.mark}]{.underline} Amphibian chytridiomycosis has a
broad host range but is highly pathogenic only to some populations of
some species. At present, both diseases can only be managed by
attempting to isolate individuals or populations from disease.
Management options to accelerate the process of evolution of host
resistance or tolerance are being investigated in both cases.
Anthropogenic changes including movement of diseases and hosts, habitat
destruction and fragmentation and climate change are likely to increase
emerging disease threats to biodiversity and it is critical to further
develop strategies to manage these threats.

1\. Introduction

[The [role of infectious disease in]{.mark} the history of [human
society]{.mark} is [well known]{.mark}]{.underline}. In contrast, until
the pioneering work of Anderson and May \[1--4\] in the late 1970s, the
perception among most ecologists was that 'well-adapted' parasites do
not harm their hosts. The role of infectious disease as a driver of host
population dynamics was therefore underappreciated, and infectious
diseases or parasites were rarely considered as significant extinction
threatening processes.

In theory, however, [simple [models show]{.mark} that parasites and
[infectious diseases]{.mark} may]{.underline}, in some circumstances[,
[be capable of]{.mark} being significant contributors to
[extinction]{.mark}]{.underline} \[5\]. From first principles, a
population declines when there are more deaths than there are births and
extinction occurs when there continue to be more deaths than births even
as the population declines towards zero. It is therefore necessary to
first distinguish between situations in which infectious disease may
reduce population size to such an extent that other factors may lead to
extinction and cases in which infectious disease contributes to there
being an excess of deaths over births even in a vanishingly small
population.

Since 2018, fresh scientific knowledge has further [reinforced the
perception of how much faster [capitalism]{.mark}'s inherently expansive
mode of functioning [is destroying]{.mark} our bountiful biosphere and
changing [the]{.mark} stable [climate]{.mark} of the last twelve
millennia that has made mankind's material and spiritual journey during
the Holocene possible**. A [global environmental collapse is]{.mark}
slowly [unfolding]{.mark} [and]{.mark} its first unequivocal [signs
are]{.mark} already [here]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Since the beginning of
the twenty-first century, **[we have [experienced]{.mark} the
[most]{.mark} [lethal heatwaves, droughts, hurricanes, floods, and
wildfires ever]{.mark} recorded]{.underline}**. We are witnessing
accelerating defaunation and species extinctions in all taxonomic
groups, less fertile soils, desertification, growing food insecurity,
sea level rise at an unexpected speed, and the emergence of millions of
people who fall into a new category of refugees -- climate refugees. We
are also suffering unprecedented sanitary crises, with increasing
antibiotic resistance and the cancer burden jumping to 18.1 million new
cases in 2018, up from 12.6 million cases in 2012 (+44%), more
threatening pandemics such as Covid-19, more devastating plagues such as
Africa and Asia and South America's recent locust outbreak, more
widespread pollution, intoxication, and hormonal disturbances. This new
world is accurately portrayed not only by the flourishing dystopian
fiction of the last decades, but also, and with even darker tones, by a
growing sum of converging scientific data and projections.
[**[Acceleration]{.mark} is maybe the [most defining feature of our
time]{.mark}**. In 2018, I drew attention to the fact that **what had
been previously expected to occur only at the end of the century was
then expected by mid-century**. These imbalances include a **[global
warming]{.mark} of at least [2 °]{.mark}C [above]{.mark} the
[pre-industrial]{.mark} period,** the disappearance of several tropical
forests, the transition of the eastern and southern parts of the Amazon
forest to a savanna vegetation, **the [first iceless September in the
Arctic]{.mark}, [extensive thawing of land]{.mark} and seabed
[permafrost]{.mark}, [global]{.mark} mean [sea level rise]{.mark} of
over 50 cm** (above the 2000 level), and **large-scale extinctions** of
species]{.underline}. This English edition shows that the possibility of
these occurrences is now being projected for the second quarter of the
century. viii The historical cycle of twentieth-century capitalism's
relative material success pertains to... the twentieth century. The
world of which our parents and grandparents were beneficiaries has
ended. [GDP growth rates are now steadily decreasing and, most
importantly, economic growth no longer translates into a better quality
of life**. [No]{.mark}**]{.underline} significant **[[social improvement
is possible]{.mark} [in a]{.mark} rapidly [deteriorating]{.mark}
[environment]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The so-called ["[emerging"
economies]{.mark}, such as those of India and China, are typically
[trapped]{.mark} in a devastating machine that is, in reality,
[making]{.mark} [them]{.mark} [sink]{.mark} more [deeply]{.mark}, and
before other countries, [into]{.mark} [extreme]{.mark} levels of
[pollution]{.mark}, very serious public [health]{.mark} [crises]{.mark},
[lethal]{.mark} [climactic anomalies]{.mark}, and acute water
scarcity]{.underline}. Their high growth rates have, in short, put them
at the forefront of the environmental nightmare with which our planetary
society is contending. The truth is that the curve measuring
environmental costs against the economic benefits of capitalism has
irreversibly entered into a negative phase. Despite this, there are
still those who argue that global warming, deforestation, biodiversity
loss, pollution, and increasing intoxication of organisms are the price
to pay for economic growth. They persist in the belief that states and
corporations can be "educated" to have a more environmentally
sustainable behavior. L'éducation fait tout hails the long-living
enlightenment tenet\... Most are also deluded by the empty words of the
Kyoto Protocol, the Paris Agreement, the Sustainable Development Goals,
the Aichi Biodiversity Targets, and the New York Declaration on Forests
(NYDF), among other texts that delight diplomats who are experts at
negotiating new targets to reduce devastation, as long as they do not
undermine the growth plans of corporations and their governments.
Proceed on the path of GDP growth and fit back into the biosphere,
thanks to the miraculous formulas of "sustainable capitalism"! Not many
escape this magical thinking. But the few who do, know that any given
quantity that grows at 2% rate per year doubles every 35 years, or every
23 years if it grows at 3% yearly. They also know that [there is
[no]{.mark} [available or future tech]{.mark}nology capable of
[allowing]{.mark} for [more]{.mark} indiscriminate [economic growth
without]{.mark} having a further [impact]{.mark} [on]{.mark} the
[biosphere]{.mark} [and]{.mark} on a [climate]{.mark} that is already
transitioning towards an additional 1 °C above the current averages.
I]{.underline}n short, these few people know that [there is [no
longer]{.mark} a [chance of escaping]{.mark} a cascade of
[socioenvironmental disasters]{.mark} unless we radically redefine the
meaning and purpose of economic activity, reduce social inequality, and
enforce democratic control of strategic investments]{.underline}. This
means putting a new economy at the service of reducing environmental
impact[. This also [means]{.mark} [investing]{.mark} [in]{.mark}
widespread sanitation infrastructure, in local and organic agriculture,
and in public policies of demographic [degrowth]{.mark}, beginning with
the right to free and state-assisted access to all forms of
contraception and termination of unwanted pregnancies. In the history of
mankind, there is no record of a rupture in the growth paradigm, nor of
changes of this magnitude and at such speed. There is no record because
such rupture and such changes have never been necessary. Now, they are.
It is not a question of underestimating the extreme difficulty of
putting this program into practice. **But nothing can be considered
impossible when what is at stake is the fate of our societies, if not
our species.**]{.underline} The few who perceive the causal
relationship, in essence a very simple one, between corporate expansion
and environmental collapse in a Preface to the English Edition ix finite
world are growing in number and in persuasion. And they are beginning to
have a weight on the balance. Not yet, it is true, on the balance of
political power, but at least on the balance of ideas, and especially in
the growing conviction that capitalism's obsolete economic and political
recipe will not offer a way out of the impasse and challenges posed by
the Anthropocene. A new radicalism of philosophical thought and
political action is required in our times. We need a recovered
confidence, reborn from the ashes, that we, as a society, are capable of
overcoming capitalism in the direction of a new social contract founded
on a natural contract, as proposed by Michel Serres, among others. No
social justice project is politically conceivable in a scorched Earth.
This book seeks to raise a more acute awareness of the extreme gravity
of our situation. Its aim is also to add more evidence to the fact,
already highlighted by two or three generations of scholars, that
["[sustainable capitalism" is a contradiction]{.mark} in terms.
[Capitalism is the disease]{.mark}]{.underline}. It cannot offer,
therefore, any credible therapy to mitigate the ongoing environmental
collapse. We are, of course, guided by science, but the question of
whether societies will be able to significantly mitigate this collapse
is not a scientific one. "Rather it is a question," as pointed out by
Damon Matthews and colleagues (2018), "of what we believe human
societies to be capable of achieving." The ultimate hope of this book is
to contribute in some way so that this belief does not falter among its
readers. São Paulo, Brazil Lui

[Capitalist agriculture]{.underline} and the global pollinator crisis

According [to many scientists]{.underline} and environmentalists [[the
Earth is in the midst of a mass extinction]{.underline}
[event]{.underline}]{.mark}, sometimes referred to as the 6th mass
extinction3 (Barnosky et al. 2011). Although the Earth has experienced
several mass extinction events in its history, this is the first event
triggered by the actions of one species -- humans -- and the only one to
occur since the evolution of humans (Barnosky et al. 2011). A mass
extinction event is deemed to have occurred (or be occurring) when the
rate of extinction is accelerating much quicker than the background
rate.4 In the history of the Earth, mass extinctions have been caused by
catastrophic events that cause global climatic changes and occur over
short geologic times (but very large spans of time in human terms) of
one to a few million years (Barnosky et al. 2011). [The 6th mass
extinction event, thus far, [includes extinctions and endangerments of
small numbers of species]{.mark}]{.underline}, but it [also includes
defaunation of many species. **Defaunation**]{.underline} is an
important, but sometimes overlooked, concept in understanding the global
biodiversity crisis because it signals that in addition to some species
facing extinction, many species who do not risk extinction or
endangerment are, nevertheless, experiencing a decline in their overall
population (Weis 2018). This [mass defaunation of animal
species]{.underline} is [coupled with a sharp increase in numbers of
livestock animals, who are numerous but unhealthy, living overwhelmingly
miserable lives]{.underline} (Weis 2018). When examining the
biodiversity crisis, it is important to understand that the presence of
large populations of domesticated animals, in the billions for pigs and
chickens (Weis 2018), is not an indication that these animals are
flourishing. [The global pollinator crisis must be situated in the
context of this larger crisis in biodiversity.]{.underline}

[[The global pollinator crisis occurs in the context of a widespread
defaunation of insect populations]{.mark}]{.underline} (Wagner et al.
2021), that in influential environmental writer George Monbiot refers to
as an "insectageddon" (2017). Although many scientists have argued that
this term, and some studies about insect decline, are alarmist, other
scientists are highlighting the seriousness and uncertainty of insect
decline. As Jereoen van der Sluijs, a professor of theory of science and
ethics of natural sciences at Bergen University points out,

Although this term has been criticized as being overly alarmist and
unsubstantiated by data, [entomologists warn that [insects are indeed
disappearing before we even have data]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Of]{.mark}
the approximately 5.5 million [insect species]{.mark}, about [90% has
not even been named]{.mark}]{.underline}, nor have their roles in
ecosystems been mapped. No global scientific monitoring of insect
abundance in the past and present exists and there are no plans for
systematic global monitoring in the near future. (2020, emphasis added)

This [[**uncertainty** about actual]{.mark} insect [populations
makes]{.mark} insect [decline]{.mark} especially
[troubling]{.mark}.]{.underline} The extent to which their numbers are
dwindling is relatively unknown, and for some species will remain
unknowable. While [some species of insects]{.underline}, especially
those that live in eusocial colonies such as [honey bees, termites, and
ants, are relatively well-studied]{.underline} and well-understood by
scientists, most species of insects are unstudied. Adding to this
complication is that there are many species of insects who have never
been classified by scientists, especially those that live in tropical
areas of the world (van der Sluijs 2020). [If a baseline population has
not been established for some insect species, then [it is difficult to
know the extent to which their numbers are
dwindling.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Despite this limitation [there have been some [troubling]{.mark}
longitudinal and review [studies that indicate that]{.mark} [populations
of insects are in **steep decline**]{.mark} (]{.underline}Habel et al.
2019; Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckuys 2019; Lister and Garcia 2018; Hallmann et
al. 2017). [A longitudinal [survey in Germany]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Hallmann et al. 2017) was conducted in a nature reserve [located
amongst landscapes of capitalist agriculture, and may in[dicate how
**capitalist agriculture affects species of insect**]{.mark}**s** in
terms of both the diversity of species and the abundance within
species]{.underline} (Hallman et al. 2017). The researchers posited
[that [the estimated **76% ying insect biomass decline over almost 30
years was a result of the practices of capitalist
agricultur**]{.mark}**e**]{.underline}, especially the [use of systemic
pesticides]{.underline} (Hallman et al. 2017). Sánchez-Bayo and Wyckuys
(2019) likewise argue that the **[[main driver of widespread insect
declines is the intensification of agriculture]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
Another longitudinal survey conducted in Puerto Rico at a nature reserve
not located near intensively managed agricultural landscapes, indicated
that [a decline in arthropod biomass]{.underline}, which they estimated
had fallen 10 to 30 times since the 1970s, [was possibly due to
human-caused climate change]{.underline} (Lister and Garcia 2018). Both
studies are contested among scientists with some arguing that
longitudinal surveys were not as rigorous as they should be and that the
claims being made were unnecessarily alarmist (Schowalter et al. 2021;
Saunders et al. 2020). Some scientists have called for a cautious
approach to proclaiming a widespread decline in insect populations,
arguing that better funded scientific studies are needed. However, with
lack of a baseline for most species of insects, there are few ways to
truly know whether insect populations are in decline, if not through
imperfect longitudinal studies. It should be noted that [[the decline of
insect populations]{.underline}]{.mark}, [like biodiversity loss more
generally and the risk of climate change, [is not an issue of **mere
scientific interest**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Insect decline,
biodiversity loss]{.mark}, and climate change dramatically [affect all
life]{.mark} on earth, including all humans]{.underline}. **[[Ecological
destruction]{.underline}]{.mark}**, manifested in climate change and
biodiversity loss, **[[requires political action as well as massive
societal transformation]{.mark}s]{.underline}**. [In order for massive
societal transformations to occur on the necessary scale there **[must
be a sense of urgency about the multiple, intersecting crises faced by
all life]{.mark}** on Earth.]{.underline}

### Impact\-\--Bees\-\--2NC

#### Capitalism leads to the [commodification of pollination]{.underline} that lead to [further bee decline]{.underline} \-\-- biodiversity and agriculture [extinction]{.underline}.

4\. The [commodification of pollination]{.underline}

In North America, [[concern for pollinators has been mounting since the
early 2000s]{.underline}]{.mark} when [almost 40 percent of the honey
bees in the United States disappeared,]{.underline} in addition to
reports from Canada and Europe of millions of hives lost (Kosek, 2011;
Van Engelsdorp et al., 2008). The phenomenon, named Colony Collapse
Disorder (CCD), has since breached apiculture\'s borders [to become part
of the mainstream narrative]{.underline} (Klein & Barron, 2017b). While
CCD events have decreased in recent years, concern for the overall
health of honey bees continues to grow. Yet, often, [the [doomsday-style
messaging]{.mark} we hear about the loss of bees is not about the
overall value of all bees to ecosystem]{.underline}s; [rather it [is
about the impact]{.mark}]{.underline} on human well-being and what it
may mean [[for human food sources and other economic
measures]{.underline}]{.mark} (Phillips, 2020).

Similar to the naïve imaginary of the family farm and happy cows (Riley,
2015), we also inhabit an imaginary of happy bees as \"hard-working
hive-dwellers\" making honey from foraging \"in flowery meadows\",
flitting from flower to flower with their chubby, cartoonish yellow and
black striped bodies (Colla, 2018, para. 3). This pollinator idyll,
often presented and perpetuated by corporate players in the industrial
food system, serves as a powerful form of visual storytelling (Riley,
2015).

The 2019 IPBES assessment noted that [the monetary value of nature\'s
contribution to people is an estimated US\$24.3 trillion in the
Americas]{.underline} alone. In terms of pollinators, at least [[75
percent of food crops and 90 percent of flowering plants depend]{.mark}
to some degree [on]{.mark} animal [pollination]{.mark}]{.underline}
(IPBES, 2019**[[). The loss of diversity]{.mark} and abundance [of
insects is leading to an]{.mark} [ominously increasing pollination
problem]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In addition, the [[loss of pollinators
could result in a loss of]{.mark} between US\$235 billion and [US\$577
billion]{.mark}]{.underline} [[in annual global crop output]{.mark}
(]{.underline}IPBES, 2016).

[One of the [threats]{.mark} [to effective bee conservation is]{.mark}
the **[co-optation of conservation efforts into]{.mark}** the
**[commodification of pollination]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A [[key
impact]{.underline}]{.mark} of this co-optation **[is [\"the
subordination of wild bees to the capitalist penetration and
financialization]{.mark}]{.underline}**\" of pollination services
provided by the managed honey bee (Marshman et al., 2019, p. 3).
[[Scientists]{.underline}]{.mark} and conservationists alike find
themselves repeatedly [[explain]{.mark}ing]{.underline} that [there are
more bees than honey bees in [an]{.mark} [effort]{.mark} to draw
attention and conservation efforts [to]{.mark} the [lesser known wild
bee species]{.mark}]{.underline} (Breeze et al., 2011; Colla & MacIvor,
2017; Fellows, 2017).

There is a [growing literature]{.underline} in biology, ecology and
entomology emphasizing the [threats to pollinator
populations]{.underline} (Alger et al., 2019; Biesmeijer et al., 2006;
Chan et al., 2019; Colla & MacIvor, 2017; Forister, Pelton & Black,
2019; Hallmann et al., 2017; IPBES, 2016; Sanchez-Bayo & Wyckhuys,
2019). [[Yet]{.underline}]{.mark}, there is little research on the human
dimensions of bee conservation, particularly in the urban context, and
thus we know little about the relationship(s) between people and
pollinators, particularly the non-Apis species. In existing examples of
social science research in this area, [[managed honey bees]{.mark} still
[often dominate the conversation]{.mark}]{.underline} (Lorenz, 2016;
Maderson & Wynne-Jones, 2016).

Animal pollination, including pollination by bees, is credited with
pollination services worth hundreds of billions of dollars annually.
[The [gravity of bee declines cannot be stated enough:]{.mark} insect
pollinators [contribute]{.mark} significantly [to]{.mark}
[diet]{.mark}ary micronutrients, global
[agriculture]{.mark}]{.underline} (rural and urban) (Steffan-Dewenter,
Potts & Packer, 2005), and **[provide [cultural]{.mark},
[medicinal,]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [educational
value]{.mark}]{.underline}** as well as [contribute to [health]{.mark}
and well-being]{.underline} (Waliczek & Zajicek, 2016). Insects enable
pollination of angiosperms (the flowering plants that produce seeds),
which produce food and resources for non-human animals (National
Research Council, 2007), utilize carbon dioxide, provide oxygen, help
purify water, and reduce soil erosion (USDA, n.d.; Government of
Ontario, 2019). However[, the commodification of pollination and the
[use of bees as livestock dilutes conservation]{.mark} efforts
[by]{.mark} [perpetuating a unidimensional view of
pollination]{.mark}.]{.underline} **[[Conserving biodiversity is of
utmost importance]{.underline}]{.mark}** (IPBES, 2019), and yet
**[[financial and industry interests are threatening bee diversity by
prioritizing honey bees rather than diversifying efforts for all
pollinating insects.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

4\. Expansion of drug control through repression and violence

Throughout the 20th century, [there [were various types of
violence]{.mark} ca[rried out in favour of]{.mark} modern [drug
control]{.mark} with global dimensions.]{.underline} This violence had
different manifestations and intensities over time and space, and it
would likely be impossible to document its full inventory. However, we
can identify some parameters that make it possible to understand its
reproduction in most societies around the world. These [parameters were
forged over more than a century, going through a period marked by
**different forms of [racism]{.mark}**, religious prejudice, disputes
between [social]{.mark} [classes]{.mark}, and **[gender
disparities]{.mark}** of all kinds.]{.underline} It had also witnessed
violent nationalisms interspersed with **[[colonialist and imperial
domination, consecutive industrial revolutions]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
enormous urban development, and migratory flows
(Buxton [Citation2006](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23337486.2020.1868060?casa_token=hQVRv_wqvLoAAAAA%3AoVWJPEUzqR2Su3kLpxo65ABfjf_tpPj4K-GKToZBEVHVaGncV0MKxI-eYuLxgbaEAp6r0ccCLJtd),
18). In general, [the main burden of violence and [prejudice]{.mark}
stemming was [shouldered by the]{.mark} poorest and [most vulnerable
populations]{.mark}]{.underline}, historically
[stig[matized]{.underline}]{.mark} [[as responsible for bringing]{.mark}
the 'addiction' of [drugs]{.mark} [to the]{.mark} so-called [orderly
society]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Musto [Citation1999](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/23337486.2020.1868060?casa_token=hQVRv_wqvLoAAAAA%3AoVWJPEUzqR2Su3kLpxo65ABfjf_tpPj4K-GKToZBEVHVaGncV0MKxI-eYuLxgbaEAp6r0ccCLJtd),
219--229). In other words, the [violence conducted in the name of modern
drug control]{.underline}, [focused on the behaviour of certain social
groups,]{.underline} dialogues intimately with these socio-political
issues that have local expressions, responding to interests and power
disputes of domestic groups, sometimes with transnational action.

But, even admitting that several local repressions appeared long before
the establishment of the international drug control, it is impossible to
deny the dynamism and expansion of a violent drug control approach in
most countries after the 1960s. This is [[due to multilateral
initiatives]{.mark} [through]{.mark} the [U.N.]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the
internationalization of the 'war on drugs' model carried out by the

levels in his analysis using the concept of [[police
power]{.underline}]{.mark}. For him, police power goes far beyond the
police institution *per se* and must be understood 'in terms of the
broad range of powers through which social order is fabricated and
subjects constituted -- the police power -- [exercised by a range of
agencies of policing situated throughout the state and the institutions
for administering civil society']{.underline}

On the other hand, it offers a justification for investing against
political opposition movements, controlling the so-called dangerous
classes by incarceration, and obtaining new technologies of violence and
repression to fight this war. In short, [the police power of the war on

Tantalizing in its promise as a silver bullet' for
**[Indigenous]{.underline}** [sustainable]{.underline}
[development]{.underline}. When done 'right', tourism can generate

**[capitalist]{.underline}** [economic]{.underline} activity without
drastically **[damaging]{.underline}** [cultural]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [ecological]{.underline} [systems]{.underline}. This
study examines

spaces of confluence and divergence in Barrow, Alaska between current
tourism and the values of its Indigenous people, the Inupiat. It
considers the scenario of increased tourism in the future and identifies
local visions for expanding tourism in a culturally appropriate manner.
Key ideas for future development include increasing regulation of cruise
ship tourists and enhancing capacity to host high-end tourists. The
study reveals [conflicting]{.underline} [views]{.underline}
[about]{.underline} [using]{.underline} subsistence
[hunting]{.underline}, [fishing]{.underline} and [whaling]{.underline}
activities [as tourism]{.underline} [attractions]{.underline}, and
concludes that the ability of leaders in Barrow to support Indigenous
values through tourism highlights an opportunity and need for a research
agenda focused on exploring the relationship between capitalism and its
alternatives within tourism destinations. The political leadership of
Barrow--- a primarily Indigenous coastal community located in the US
Arctic at the northernmost point of Alaska---wants ^to^ develop more
tourism in order to diversify their oil dependent economy. This desire
is laid out in Soaring to the Future: Barrow

Comprehensive Plan 2015-2035, an official

planning document recently completed collaboratively by the major local
governing bodies of Barrow for he purpose of providing a unified
direction for future development (North Slope Borough \[NSB\], 2014).
The plan goes into detail

describing a vision for the next two decades for tourism in Barrow.
While the parties involved with the creation of the comprehensive plan
(i.e., regional municipal governments, Native governments, and Native
corporations - all of which are

52 explained further later) would not claim that it represents the views
of every individual in Barrow, the plan nonetheless presents a clear and
nuanced intention to increase tourism and its related businesses. The
plan is likely to be

implementable given the political clout of the authoring parties. From a
theoretical framework based on the paradigm of sustainable tourism
(Bramwell, 2011; Bramwell & Lane, 1993; Butler, 1999; Clarke, 1997;
Farrell & Twining-

Ward, 2005; Hunter, 1995, 1997; Jamal & Camargo,

2014; Liu, 2003; Lu & Nepal, 2009; Muller, 1994; Sharpley, 2000),
Barrow's goals for tourism development appear positive--- a
[locally]{.underline}-[led]{.underline},
[community]{.underline}-[vetted]{.underline} effort to

promote [economic]{.underline} [diversification]{.underline} through
tourism, in a manner that is [environmentally]{.underline} and
[culturally]{.underline} [sensitive]{.underline}.

However, theoretical insights derived from research on Indigenous
tourism (Butler & Hinch, 2007; Bunten, 2008, 2010,

2011; Honey, 1999; Johnston, 2000, 2006; Notzke, 1999; Robinson, 1999;
Sofield, 1993; Turner, Berkes, & Turner, 2012; Zeppel, 2006) and from
research

taking a radical political economy approach to tourism (Bianchi, 2009,
2011; Britton, 1982a, 1991; Mosedale, 2011; Shepherd, 2002; Weaver,
2013), on the other hand, would likely advise a [cautionary]{.underline}
[approach]{.underline} to tourism development. These latter realms of
theory contend that ~tourism~, especially in [Indigenous]{.underline}
[communities]{.underline} where [close]{.underline} ties
[to]{.underline} l[ocal]{.underline} [ecosystems]{.underline} have been
identified by the communities [as]{.underline} [culturally]{.underline}
[essential]{.underline}, can [lead]{.underline} [to]{.underline}
**[undesirable]{.underline}** **[impacts]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} [outcomes if]{.underline} ~processes\ of\ development~
are [dominated]{.underline} [by]{.underline} outside forces and
subjected to the [global]{.underline} [economic]{.underline} imperative
[for]{.underline} [profit]{.underline} maximization through social-

ecological [commoditization]{.underline}. Given the apparent tension
between the need for sustainable economic [development]{.underline} in
the US Arctic on the one hand [and]{.underline} [the]{.underline}
**[risks]{.underline}** that are known to be associated with ~tourism~
development on the other hand, what should be made of the expressed
desire of Barrow's political leadership, which is primarily Indigenous,
to expand tourism in their community?

What do they know that makes them confident that they can
[avoid]{.underline} the common pitfalls of tourism? What lessons can be
drawn from the Barrow

case for the field of [sustainable]{.underline} [tourism]{.underline}?
To address these questions, this study is contextualized by presenting a
social-ecological overview of Barrow, Alaska. Three area

s of related but distinct tourism studies literature--- sustainable
tourism, Indigenous tourism, and the radical political economy of
tourism--- are then reviewed to build

a theoretical framework for the Barrow study. Bunten's work on
Indigenous capitalism through tourism (2008, 2010, 2011) emerges as a
key theoretical concept. Stud y methods and findings are discussed. In
conclusion, the implications of this case within the broader geographic
context of Alaska and within the broader theoretical

context of sustainable tourism is considered. It is argued that Barrow's
apparent capacity to channel the forces of [global]{.underline}
**[capitalism]{.underline}** into lessexploitative,

community-oriented goals points towards the need for further research in
the area of capitalism's alternatives (Gibson-Graham, 1996) in tourism

destinations. explained further later) would **[not]{.underline}** claim
that it [represents]{.underline} the [views]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} individuals ~in\ Barrow,\ the\ plan\ nonetheless~

presents a clear and nuanced intention to increase tourism and its
related businesses. The plan is likely to be implementable given the
political clout of the [au]{.underline}thoring [parties.]{.underline}
The first step in analyzing the convergences and divergences between
tourism and Inupiaq values in Barrow is to establish what is meant by
Inupiaq values. Inupiaq values are codified and appear as written lists.
Participants at the workshop explained that the purpose of creating
these lists is to establish and promote a common set of
historically-rooted cultural values that are central to Inupiat
identities. Lists are constructed by different community groups, usually
through deliberative discussion, and vary slightly from one another.
Moreover, the values are somewhat flexible in terms of interpretation.
Nonetheless, different lists present the same general 67themes and have
been integrated into the mission and statements of Inupiaq
organization--- such as the regional and village corporations--- and are
widely available online to the public. For the purposes of this article,
I draw on the 12 core values utilized by NSB, as this is a manageable
list that is posted in many public spaces throughout Barrow (Table 2.1).
Inupiaq values are generally community-oriented and differ significantly
from the individualistic, hyper-rational, and ceaselessly ambitious
values of capitalism, which makes it somewhat surprising that local
Indigenous leadership has expressed the desire to increase tourism - a
capitalistic phenomenon. During the workshop, participants were asked to
identify and rank factors that affected the health and sustainability of
their communities by allocating ten small round stickers to pieces of
paper displaying different options. From a grouping of 46 wide-ranging
factors, Inupiaq Values and Transmission and Recognition of Traditional
Knowledge were voted to the top by a wide margin. This result, as well
as the discussions that took place about these factors, suggests a
widespread and explicit agreement that the maintenance and practice of
these values are essential to the wellbeing of communities in northern
Alaska, including Barrow. 2.3.2.2 Tourism in Barrow The second step in
analyzing the convergences and divergences between tourism and Inupiaq
values in Barrow is to understand what tourism currently entails.
Quantifying tourism in Barrow is an inexact science. The State of Alaska
conducts regular surveys of visitors to thetate, which are somewhat
helpful in building a picture of Barrow's tourism. During the 12 month
period from October 2013 to September 2014, total visitor spending in
the state was estimated at \$1.83 billion, with around 1% (or \$25
million with rounding) taking place in the Far 68North---a vast area
encompassing Barrow and numerous other small rural communities (McDowell
Group, 2015). Similarly, total visitor industry-related employment in
Alaska was estimated at 38,700 jobs with around 1% (or 300 jobs with
rounding) being contributed in the Far North (McDowell Group, 2015).
Visitor volume in Alaska has hovered just below 2 million visitors per
year in the recent past (McDowell Group, 2015) and, while the number for
the Far North is not provided, it could be estimated at 1% (or around
20,000 visitors per year) based on the estimates of other metrics. This
estimate is not unreasonable given enplanement data from Barrow's
airport. Enplanement numbers have shown a steady increase from just over
35,000 individuals in 2003 to nearly 45,000 enplanements in 2012 (PDC
Inc., 2013). Enplanements include both visitors and local residents
traveling through the airport. Barrow is not accessible by land (except
via ice-road and snow machine in the winter) but multiple interviewees
explained that visitors are increasingly arriving via ship. While
numerical estimates are not available for ship-borne visitors, interview
and internet data reveal multiple incidents every summer of both large
cruise ships and small private vessels making port calls in Barrow,
although the total number of ship-borne visitors is perhaps two orders
of magnitude less than those traveling by air. A local government
official reported, "We do get tourism ships up here.. .seven are so far
scheduled to come to Barrow this summer." Clearly, there are significant
numbers of visitors coming and going on a regular basis. Interview and
observational data reveal that the attractions drawing tourists to
Barrow are many and span the categories of nature/geographic tourism,
Indigenous-cultural tourism, and western-historical tourism (Table 2.2).
Birding is a major draw, as a hotel employee emphasized, "We have a lot
of birding groups, a lot of birders!" Motorized terrestrial tours are
offered by independent operators and by one hotel, and are generally
marketed as either 'comprehensive 69tours' or 'wildlife photography
tours'. The handicraft industry is well developed, with artisans selling
their wares at multiple locations and, as one hotel employee mentioned,
through social media. There are tour businesses located in the southern
portion of Alaska (in the cities of Fairbanks and Anchorage) that run
tours to Barrow. Built photo opportunities include a sign reading
'Welcome to Barrow, Top of the World', a whalebone arch with traditional
whaling boats, and a memorial for American humorist Will Rogers and his
pilot Wiley Post, whose small aircraft crashed in Barrow in 1935. Barrow
currently has three hotels, with a total of 105 rooms. Other
tourism-related infrastructure includes six restaurants, three grocery
stores, a furrier that sells souvenirs, a post office, a hospital, a
bank, abundant taxis, and one espresso shop. Quantifying the number of
visitors and their motivations more closely is an important area for
future research that would provide currently-lacking baseline data.
2.3.2.3 Spaces of Confluence and Divergence The largest hotel in Barrow
is the Top of the World Hotel--- a newly constructed, 70 room facility,
owned and operated by ASRC. The hotel supports Inupiaq values in two key
ways. First,because ASRC is a Native corporation, the profits derived
from the operation of the hotel are redistributed to Inupiat via their
status as corporate shareholders. It stands to reason that this income
source helps Native individuals finance cultural activities, such as
subsistence, which require the use of money to buy supplies (see Nuttall
et al., 2009, for an authoritative discussion of Arctic mixed
economies). Through this redistribution of surplus value, Barrow has
managedto avoid major drawbacks of tourism development that Bianchi
(2009, 2011) and Britton (1982a, 1991) warned about---the extraction of
profits by outside interests. This hotel is unquestionably 70not a
foreign chain dropping into an exotic destination to maximize profits.
With much of the profit going directly back to community residents, I
contend that the largest hotel in Barrow ismore like a social
cooperative than a conventional private corporation. Second, Top of the
World Hotel has taken extensive steps to promote education about Inupiaq
culture. A non-Inupiaq hotel employee explained, "One of the values that
is really prevalent up here is the sharing, the generosity, the
authenticity. They share their culture." The hotel's efforts include:
offering a van tour of Barrow with an Inupiaq guide; giving its
restaurantIn Inupiaq name (Niggivikput, meaning our place to eat);
having a section in its visitors' guide called 'Our Alaska Native
Heritage'; collaborating with Inupiaq dancers to support paid
performances for guests; and implementing a photographic story telling
strategy in the hotel. The common spaces of the hotel are adorned with
photographic collages of Inupiat performing cultural activities (Figure
2.1). The collages overlap historic and contemporary photos to
communicate that the Inupiat identity is rooted in the past but firmly
established in the present as well, I was told. These type of tourism
activities are examples of ways that Barrow's Inupiat control their
Indigenous commodified persona, to invoke Bunten's concept (2008). The
capacity of the Barrow's Inupiat to control their own cultural
representation within tourism is further evidenced by the Inupiat
Heritage Center, a museum and community center funded by NSB. The main
exhibit is called 'The People of Whaling', and presents material
artifacts from historic and contemporary Inupiat life, which range from
a sealskin whaling boat to a mesh basketball jersey (Barrow's high
school mascot is the Whalers). The museum explains each of the 12 core
Inupiaq values and includes a life-size replica of a bowhead whale.
Additional museum themes include the diversity of local wildlife, the
Inupiat struggle for selfgovernance, the importance of elders, and
promotion of traditional handicrafts--- all themes that 71resonate with
specific Inupiaq values. It is my interpretation that the museum is an
example of Indigenous capitalism (i.e., NSB's taxation of oil and gas
infrastructure) being channeled into the promotion of cultural values
through the education of visitors. Cultural festivals constitute another
space of confluence between Indigenous values and capitalism through
tourism, as evidenced by tourism media and interviews. The official
visitor's guide to Barrow--- a map and informational brochure available
for free throughout the community---encourages visitors to attend three
different festivals throughout the year, including Nalukataq in in June,
which marks the end of spring whaling with food sharing and a blanket
toss. A hotel employee explained that, "Nalukataq is open to the
community and \[the organizers are\] very generous. In fact, they
encourage me to bring our tourists." She suggested that the festivals
provide opportunities to showoff aspects of Indigenous culture that
bring pride. This suggests that Inupiaq festivals have retained their
cultural authenticity, while simultaneously serving as tourism
attractions. Capitalism has not turned them into reified commodities,
which corresponds with previous literature on the subject (e.g., Cohen,
1988). Handicrafts are a key feature in some definitions of Indigenous
tourism (Smith, Butler, & Hinch, 1996) and are prevalent in Barrow. The
Inupiat Heritage Center contains a handicraft workshop and provides
community members with equipment to fashion their items. Handicrafts are
sold directly from the workshop by the artisans, and also at other
locations around town. Handicrafts are primarily made from animal parts
(e.g., whale baleen, walrus ivory, fur) that the artisans collect or
purchase from Native hunters. The handicraft market within Barrow
provides an opportunity for direct transfer of cash from visitors to
artisans, and is open to any Native person wishing to participate, I was
told. The handicraft trade allows an opportunity for selfemployment,
which counteracts the tendency within capitalistic tourism of employee
72exploitation by the owning class (Bianchi, 2009, 2011; Britton, 1982a,
1991). In interviews, artisans spoke frequently of learning their craft
from their elders. In this way, tourism-supported handicrafts enhance
the transmission of cultural knowledge. However, the number of jobs
provided for Inupiat through Barrow's tourism industry is miniscule
compared to the number of jobs offered by the main employers---local
government and Native corporations. As a government official put it, "No
one needs to do tourism." Moreover, tourism-related employment and other
financial benefits are split between Indigenous and non-Indigenous
persons (such as taxi drivers that also serve as tour guides and the
owners of non-Native hotels and retreatants). Research suggests that
non-Indigenous tourism entrepreneurs in Barrow can create resentment
among Native residents, and therefore mark a key space of divergence
between capitalism and Inupiaq values.

While some [Indigenous]{.underline} leaders **[expressed]{.underline}**
ambivalence towards tourists, viewing [them]{.underline} as slightly
annoying but tolerable due to their limited numbers, others expressed

**[frustration]{.underline}** [about]{.underline} [tour]{.underline}
companies based outside ~of\ Barrow\ bringing\ people\ into\ town~,
**[utilizing]{.underline}** the community's [resources]{.underline}, and
leaving

quickly, without benefits flowing to Native stakeholders. "It's not a
great advantage financially to have people come up in the morning and
leave in the afternoon," suggested an interviewee.

Other concerns expressed by interviewees included non-guided tourists
violating residents' privacy (e.g., by peeking through windows).
Instances such as these show how the **[profit-seeking]{.underline}**

**[imperative]{.underline}** of the global tourism system
[conflicts]{.underline} [with]{.underline} **[Inupiaq
values]{.underline}** in [as]{.underline} far as it drives
[external]{.underline} [entrepreneurs]{.underline}

to [capitalize]{.underline} [on]{.underline} the resources ~that~

The [Indigenous]{.underline} [peoples]{.underline} of the North have
embraced Western institutions while remaining [closely]{.underline}
[tied]{.underline} to their historic [cultural]{.underline}
[roots]{.underline} (Vanstone, 1960). [Their]{.underline}

[models]{.underline} of land and [resource]{.underline} use foster
[both]{.underline} [local]{.underline} [economic]{.underline}
[progression]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [conservation]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} [environmental]{.underline} [policies]{.underline},
striving [to]{.underline} [achieve]{.underline} the major goal of
combined [sustainable]{.underline} [development]{.underline} and
[sustainable]{.underline} harvests through a
[long]{.underline}-[term]{.underline} [approach]{.underline} (Fow,
2012). [Global]{.underline} [markets]{.underline} have
[affected]{.underline} and [transformed]{.underline}
[Indigenous]{.underline} [economies]{.underline} across the world.
Indigenous communities are under [increasing]{.underline}
**[pressure]{.underline}** to [conform]{.underline} to a
[global]{.underline} market [economy]{.underline} in the form of
**[profit]{.underline}**-**[driven]{.underline}**
**[activities]{.underline}** such as l[ogging]{.underline},
[mining]{.underline}, [hydropower]{.underline}, and oil and gas. Today's
Indigenous economies demonstrate a continuum where priorities are
sliding from market (fully monetized) to subsistence (nonmonetized)
activities. This sliding was captured schematically in the following
work: "A Conceptual Framework of Arctic Economies for Policy-making,
Research, and Practice" (Larsen et al., 2019). The framework allows one
to visualize the push and pull among various factors
**[affecting]{.underline}** **[Arctic]{.underline}**
**[economies]{.underline}**. Between these theoretic ideas lie mixed
economies that combine both monetized and partially monetized aspects of
economic development. It is this conscious prioritization of monetary
and nonmonetary features that [Indigenous communities strive to balance
and sustain.]{.underline} The objective of this article is to explicate
the various types of Indigenous economies on the continuum between
subsistence and market across three Arctic countries---Russia, Finland,
and the United States (Alaska). We aim to identify strategies of
developing Indigenous economies and the approaches that various
stakeholders use to balance the for-profit and nonprofit goals of
Indigenous communities' economic activity. The core idea is to
demonstrate that some features of [Indigenous]{.underline}
[economies]{.underline} [are]{.underline} a [crucial]{.underline}
[part]{.underline} [of]{.underline} [Indigenous]{.underline}
[culture]{.underline} and [help]{.underline} [sustain]{.underline} the
[traditional]{.underline} [way]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
[life]{.underline} and interaction with the market economy in a changing
environment. In other words, we discuss the interaction between culture
and economy. As the methods of our research, we employed context
analysis of Russian, American, and Finnish legislation and strategies,
case studies, and contextual interviews with representatives of
governments and Indigenous communities. Theoretical approaches to
Indigenous economies and methodology of the research
**[Indigenous]{.underline}** **[economies]{.underline}**
[refer]{.underline} [to]{.underline} the traditional and local
structures of Indigenous peoples. These structures may include a
[variety]{.underline} [of]{.underline} [land]{.underline}- and
marine-based, [small]{.underline}-[scale]{.underline}
[economic]{.underline} [activities]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
practices as well as **[sustainable]{.underline}**
**[resource]{.underline}** **[management]{.underline}** (Kuokkanen,
2011). [Indigenous]{.underline} **[economies]{.underline}**
[are]{.underline} difficult to define because of their uniqueness and
diversity; there is no definition that applies to all. Although it is
[difficult to]{.underline} [define]{.underline} a single structure, we
can assume that [Indigenous]{.underline} [economies]{.underline} [are
a]{.underline} [combination]{.underline} of [organized]{.underline}
communal, [family]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
[individual]{.underline} [activities]{.underline} of aboriginal peoples
living on their traditional land and aiming to satisfy their need to
lead a traditional way of life, including consumption needs, in a modern
world t[hat is increasingly imposing on the Arctic. In general, the
Indigenous economy includes vital]{.underline} [e]{.underline}conomic,
social, cultural, and spiritual dimensions. The recent Arctic Human
Development Report describes Indigenous com[munities as ones that
maintain subsistence]{.underline} [production within traditional social
structures, e]{.underline}xploit new economic opportunities, and create
increasingly complex
~socioeconomic\ dynamics\ (Poppel\ and\ Kruse,\ 2010;\ Larsen\ and\ Fondahl,\ 2015).\ The\ key\ principles\ of~
Indigenous economies that differentiate them from other economic [models
are subsistence, environmental awareness]{.underline}, that is,
awareness of the consequences of their activities (Nath, 2009), and
rational use of natural resources as a proven and historical way
~to\ survive\ in\ harsh\ Arctic\ conditions\ with~ limited nature's
capacity as compared to lower latitudes (Lavrillier and Gabyshev, 2017).
Furthermore, reciprocity is defined as reflection on land-based
worldviews founded on active recognition of kinship relations that
extend beyond the human domain (Kuokkanen, 2006; Lasimbang, 2008).
Indigenous economies are contingent upon a stable and continuous
relationship between the human and natural worlds (Kuokkanen, 2011), a
crucial link existing between Indigenous economies and Indigenous
traditional knowledge. Indigenous knowledge and practices have
historically been an integral part of Indigenous economies that reflect
their social, economic, and environmental values and aspirations. Hunn
(1999) notes that Indigenous or traditional ecological knowledge "is a
consequence of subsistence-based production." Indigenous peoples
continue to rely on their traditional practices and sustainable use of
renewable resources although this dependence occasionally puts them at
risk of being adversely affected by industrial activities and market
effects. Several main characteristics of the economic activities of
Indigenous peoples can be identified. The first one is the peoples'
ability to adapt to and thrive in environmental conditions that many,
who are not Indigenous, would find exceedingly challenging. The specific
economic activities that have resulted from this relationship are
reindeer herding, fishing, gathering, and hunting. Second, Indigenous
economies are tied to their specific territories. Reindeer herders, for
instance, have wandered along their routes for many centuries, and some
Indigenous peoples continue to fish and hunt in the areas of their
ancestors (Novikova, 2013). ~The\ third\ characteristic\ is\ the~
rootedness of economic activity in the social norms and perceptions of
Indigenous peoples. Today, these perceptions may be a mixture of Western
and Indigenous rules and values (Bunikowski, 2015), but certain social
norms still govern the existence of Indigenous peoples, and their
economic activities have prevailed over the centuries (Gladun and
Zakharova, 2020). The use of natural resources in economic activities is
closely related to the traditional ideas of Indigenous peoples about
nature (Stammler, 2005). Fourth, a typical feature of Indigenous
economies is their connection with certain forms of social organization.
As a rule, the main economic unit of an Indigenous population [is the
extended family or community]{.underline}. This social structure is
often maintained in a transition toward market relations (Stammler,
2005; BurnSilver et al., 2016). The fifth feature is the use of
Indigenous peoples' specific knowledge in conducting business
activities. This includes knowledge of wildlife migration routes, local
climatic conditions, hunting and fishing, processing collected
resources, adapting to natural disasters, and so on. The traditional
knowledge is associated not only with practical skills but also with
folklore legends (Martynova and Novikova, 2011). The sixth typical trait
is linked with the culture and life of Indigenous peoples. Their
economic activities are closely intertwined with their language,
folklore, way of life, and crafts (Poppel, 2006). Therefore, the
preservation of the traditional economic activities of Indigenous
peoples is directly associated with the preservation of their culture.
Even when they are related to new types of economic activity instead of
traditional ones, cultural aspects continue to play a key role and
influence decisions. For example, ecological and ethnographic tourism by
others than Indigenous that increases on the lands of Indigenous peoples
is only possible by exploiting the elements of Indigenous culture,
whereas tourism based on companies owned by Indigenous presents the
links between culture and a way of life that combines historical
connections with a conscious acknowledgment of modernizing and
preserving the culture into the future. In our article, we discuss
various types of Indigenous economies. Generally, economists distinguish
three main types: subsistence, redistribution, and market economies
(Stigler, 1941; Polanyi and Maclver, 1944). We use the concept of market
economy to refer to marketbased relations where goods and services are
monetized. The concept has been applied as the opposite of planned
economy, where production is centrally planned, prices centrally set,
and goods are distributed by the state. Based on this classification, we
have identified three main types of Indigenous economies: subsistence
economy, state-supported economy, and market relations. The first case
is a situation where Indigenous people live mainly by the products of
their households and use of natural resources (hunting, gathering,
reindeer herding, and fishing; Poppel, 2006; Larsen and Huskey, 2015).
In a state-supported economy, Indigenous communities' lives are
considerably influenced by governmental subsidies and target programs
(Filant, 2017), although this support should be understood to exist on a
continuum. Finally, a smarket economy presupposes the successful
inclusion of Indigenous people in market relations where their main
income derives from the sale of their products on the market (Stammler,
2005). Subsistence is the [intrinsic]{.underline} value [of
Indigenous]{.underline} economy, [identified both as an
econo]{.underline}m[ic and a social system, encompassing]{.underline}
[various spheres of life that often are inseparable fr]{.underline}om
one another. It means that at the center of traditional Indigenous
economic activity is [not]{.underline} **[competition]{.underline}** or
the exchange of products and services for profit but the sustenance of
individuals, families, and the community. The surplus is shared at
numerous festivals and ceremonies that maintain the social cohesion of
the community but also bring prestige to those who give and share their
wealth (Kuokkanen, 2011). Although a subsistence economy that is not
dependent on any market or monetized features more than likely does not
exist today, the aspiration continues to play a significant economic,
social, and cultural role in many Indigenous communities. According to
various estimates, subsistence economy accounts for 30%--80% of all
production and income in many northern Indigenous communities (Wolfe and
Walker, 1987; Langdon, 1991; Elias, 1995; Elias, 1997; Dinero, 2003).
The progress of economic development in the Arctic and the related
Western influence on Indigenous structures have
**[significantly]{.underline}** **[altered]{.underline}** the
**[traditionally]{.underline}** **[sustainable practices
of]{.underline}** the Arctic's **[Indigenous]{.underline}**
**[peoples]{.underline}** (Sonnenfeld, 1957; Fow, 2012). Numerous
studies demonstrate that Indigenous subsistence economies have been
intertwined with market economy based on wage-labor relations for a long
time (Sonnenfeld, 1957; Hosmer, 1999; Dinero, 2003; Meeks, 2003;
O'Neill, 2005). The involvement of Indigenous peoples in market
relations means that they begin to extract natural resources and harvest
products mainly for sale. As a rule, Indigenous peoples sell
traditionally made products (fish, venison, antlers, meat, and skins of
wild animals) both locally and internationally, depending on country.
The least developed area of Indigenous economy is ethnological or
ecological tourism. In addition, Indigenous people can be employed by
companies and receive a regular salary which is usually used for motor
boats, all terrain vehicles (ATVs), satellite phones, fish and meat
processing equipment, and fuel. However, in many cases, Indigenous
people have difficulty entering the market. Often, they live in less
accessible areas where market infrastructure is undeveloped. Their
products are not competitive with those of large companies. They don't
have enough resources to turn their system into a market economy and
lack the necessary knowledge and skills to organize their enterprises or
get jobs ~for\ which\ they\ qualify.~ Finally, the complicated
relationship between Indigenous peoples and market relations can be
**[problematic]{.underline}** in that full employment can remove and
distract one from a traditional way of life (Huskey, 2005; Larsen and
Huskey, 2015).

Through this approach, I will argue that the [key [concepts of "**Arctic
hype**]{.mark}" and "**[Arctic paradox]{.mark}**" [need to be seen in a
new light]{.mark}]{.underline}. These key concepts [relating to Arctic
politics are explored in the context of catastrophic
changes]{.underline}, which are somewhat present in non-social
scientific studies (which the first part of the chapter assesses), yet
are [[practically **absent**]{.mark} [from social scientific studies on
resource]{.mark} rushes]{.underline}. I argue that due to the [[rapidly
cascading **global ecological crises**]{.underline}]{.mark}, which will
[**[affect]{.mark}** the [Arctic **faster**]{.mark} than most
places]{.underline}, it is [much [less likely]{.mark} that the [foreseen
"untapped potential]{.mark}" of [resources]{.mark} will be [available
for extraction]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact, the [[destruction]{.mark}
of existing [oil and gas pipelines]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[due to
permafrost melting]{.mark}, and [riskier]{.mark} [sea routes and]{.mark}
[offshore extraction due to]{.mark} unexpected
[storms]{.mark}]{.underline}, may well [prove to be much more vital
processes in defining the contours of extraction than the will to
extract]{.underline}. Thus, the "[[Arctic hype]{.underline}]{.mark},"
which refers to [claims **[over-exaggerating]{.mark}** the [potential
untapped resources]{.mark} and boon]{.underline} provided for global
resource extraction by the Arctic (Finger & Heininen 2019), [may be
over, or face major narrative transformation]{.underline}. The "[[Arctic
paradox]{.mark}"]{.underline} refers to the [[receding ice]{.mark}
sheets and the [opening]{.mark} of [maritime
passages]{.mark},]{.underline} supposedly [[opening]{.mark} up
[possibilities for further extraction]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Paradoxically, these ecological changes are [[caused]{.mark} partially
[by]{.mark} the [increased extraction and its
emissions]{.mark}]{.underline} and other disturbances in the
environments. Hence, the "Arctic paradox" may also be [under major
narrative transformation]{.underline}. This is [probable if the Arctic
[changes **do not provide**]{.mark} the [possibility for furthering
extractive capacities]{.mark}]{.underline}, but instead [[**force**
existing investment projects to discontinue]{.underline}]{.mark}. This
would mean [[shutting down extractive areas and depopulating]{.mark}
those Arctic [towns]{.mark} that have [become **exceedingly
dangerous**]{.mark} due to, for example, [massive methane
releases]{.mark}, and other [changes forcing rapid changes in]{.mark}
the [lived environments]{.mark} of the Arctic]{.underline}. This kind of
rendering of prior land uses, such as extensive reindeer herding, is
[[already happening]{.mark} in some places]{.underline}, as the record
snow cover in Lapland in 2020 showed. The [[Sámi people]{.mark} had
great [difficulties]{.mark} in their [reindeer
herding]{.mark}]{.underline} as the reindeer could not get at the lichen
under the snow, and had to be feed-lot fed. These kinds of
[[abrupt]{.mark} yet ever more typical [weather disrupt]{.mark}ions
affect [existing livelihoods]{.mark} and lived
environments]{.underline}, the kind of land uses, and the ways of life
that are possible. Sámi spokespersons have said that [[if reindeer
herding ends]{.underline}]{.mark}, that will be [[**the end** of their
traditional culture]{.underline}]{.mark}, [lifestyles, and
languages]{.underline}. This chapter will explore these transformations
in and through the Arctic in the interface of climate crises, ecological
collapses, resource extraction and global land grabbing.

I will first explain the key biophysical changes in which the land and
resource rush in the Arctic is currently situated, to emphasize that
these [[issues should not be studied]{.mark} as happening [in]{.mark}
some sort of [vacuum]{.mark}]{.underline} [[where capital
investments]{.mark} can [freely flow]{.mark} to places [around the
world]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [[environmental, technical]{.underline},
[political]{.underline}]{.mark}[, and [economic difficulties]{.mark} of
[extraction are reviewed]{.mark}]{.underline}. These include [studies on
[infrastructural]{.mark}]{.underline} [[damages]{.mark} and
costs]{.underline}, which are mostly [[**neglected** by
government]{.mark} policies]{.underline}, but are starting to be taken
more seriously by would-be investors. After this, the social responses
and resistance to Arctic resource grabbing are explored, and the varied
forms and trajectories that Arctic regions are likely to experience are
assessed. The study is primarily based on a literature review that
unites different strands of scholarship to make a transdisciplinary
argument, while basing this knowledge on personal field research on
mining and other types of resource frontiers globally and in Finland.
The conclusions connect the current situation to a demand for
incorporating politics at the current tipping points and also connect
ecological crises much more closely to existing social scientific and
other studies on global land grabbing and other issues.

The [[**Difficulties** of Resource Extraction Amid **Climate
Catastrophes**]{.underline}]{.mark}

Global temperature rises have led to a [[rapid increase]{.mark} in
[permafrost temperatures]{.mark}]{.underline} [around the
world]{.underline}, and this has caused [[fast-expanding permafrost
thawing]{.underline}]{.mark} especially in the Northern Hemisphere
(Biskaborn et al. 2019). The degradation of the permafrost system has
been dramatic between the 1970s and 2018 for example in the Western
Russian Arctic (Vasiliev et al. 2020). This thawing of the permafrost
has [**[already passed a tipping point]{.mark}** and will [continue for
hundreds of years even if the emission]{.mark} of greenhouse gases by
humans were [immediately halted]{.mark}]{.underline} (Randers & Goluke
2020). The [[methane]{.mark} and other [greenhouse gases]{.mark} that
the [Arctic thawing]{.mark} is now [releasing]{.mark} will **[further
accelerate]{.mark}** this process]{.underline}, making
[[developments]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the near [decades **unstable**
for]{.mark} an [assumed continuation of extraction]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Scientists have warned that this [[process]{.mark} will be [further
increased]{.mark}]{.underline} as there are [very [few signs of
decreasing emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}; instead the [focus has
[shifted toward net-zero targets in the **distant
future**]{.mark}]{.underline} and [[dubious offsetting schemes]{.mark}
and other [false solutions to address the climate
crisis]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g.
https://www.climatechangenews.com/2020/12/11/10-myths-net-zero-targets-carbon-
offsetting-busted/). The potential of [[carbon]{.underline}]{.mark} that
will be [[emitted from]{.underline} [permafrost thawing is
massive]{.underline}]{.mark}, estimates running from [[260 to 360
billion tonnes of carbon]{.underline}]{.mark}, a considerable part of
[which will [thaw **abruptly** and **not
gradually**]{.mark}]{.underline}, these abrupt emissions greatly
[[increasing]{.mark} the [release projections]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Merritt et al. 2019). Just a tiny fraction of this emission potential
would have **[[catastrophic impacts]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Smith 2011).

There are a few studies which have started to incorporate the
aforementioned situation into their prognoses, although the vast
majority, based on my review, suggests that most analyses are oblivious
to these facts, or ignore them. Hjort et al. (2018) claims to be the
first study [detailing the fundamental]{.underline} infrastructure which
is [at risk]{.underline} across the Northern Hemisphere permafrost area
[due to climate changes]{.underline}. They argue that [[by 2050, about
69% of the pan-Arctic infrastructur]{.mark}e]{.underline} that is
[[essential to human life]{.mark} in these conditions]{.underline},
including [[housing]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[transport]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [[industry
facilities]{.underline}]{.mark}, will be [in [areas of high potential
for]{.mark}]{.underline} [[permafrost thaw]{.mark} near the
surface.]{.underline} They also note that [[even if the Paris
Agreement]{.mark} target is [reached]{.mark}]{.underline}, most [[Arctic
infrastructures]{.mark} would be [at risk]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
includes such [central extractive infra- structures]{.underline} as the
1,590-kilometer [[Eastern Siberia--Pacific Ocean oil
pipeline]{.underline}]{.mark}, 1,260 kilo- meters [of [gas
pipelines]{.underline}]{.mark} [originating [in]{.mark} the
[Yamal-Nenets region]{.mark}]{.underline}, and 550 kilometers of the
[[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]{.underline}]{.mark} (Hjort et al. 2018).
This suggests that especially [[hydrocarbon
extraction]{.underline}]{.mark} will become [[**extremely
diffic**ult]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[too costly]{.underline}]{.mark}, or
[[socio-**environmentally** **hazardous**]{.underline}]{.mark}, 225
Markus Kröger as the constant thawing will [require re-building the
pipelines]{.underline}. As the costs of merely trying to upkeep the
existing industrial structures, buildings and essential logistics of
extraction are [extremely high]{.underline}, there will be [[fewer
funds]{.mark} for expansion projects]{.underline}. For example,
Streletskiy et al. (2019) estimate that [[by 2050]{.underline},
[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} will need to [[spend over 100 billion
USD]{.underline}]{.mark} to [[sustain]{.mark} its [existing
infrastructures]{.mark}]{.underline} that will be [[damaged by
thawing]{.underline}.]{.mark} [Producing cheap commodities]{.underline}
that [rely on]{.underline} [massive infrastructures]{.underline}, such
as hydrocarbons, is thus likely to be hard, even
[impossible]{.underline}. Moreover, the [situation]{.underline} will
become [even worse due to the [currently rapidly decreasing
funding]{.mark} given to hydrocarbon expansion projects]{.underline},
and the [[massive and rising costs]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [[lowering
returns]{.underline}]{.mark}, that the [[pumping]{.mark} of [oil and
gas]{.mark} in the Arctic would produce]{.underline}. Similarly,
[[slurry pipelines]{.mark} for pumping minerals]{.underline} with water
are likely to be [[unfeasible]{.mark} in the Arctic]{.underline}. A more
[likely]{.underline}, and [less costly]{.underline},
[outcome]{.underline} in the [worst thawing regions]{.underline} is for
the [people]{.underline} now living in extractive towns' old buildings
which are collapsing to be [moved to other regions,]{.underline} where
[upkeeping infrastructure will be less costly]{.underline}, and where
the rapidly cascading effects and risks of thawing are less likely. This
suggests that [very large areas of [Siberia and North
America]{.mark}]{.underline} would become more akin to wasteland than
usable targets for land grabbing, as [[invest]{.mark}ing]{.underline}
would be far [[**too risky** and **short-lived**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

These barriers set by climatic catastrophes are [[not limited to
land]{.underline}, but [also affect the seas]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[Coastal]{.underline} and [offshore operations]{.underline}]{.mark}
will [[suffer from]{.mark} increasing [storms and drifting
ice]{.mark}]{.underline}, which already make the situation so perilous
that, along with other factors such as the unavailability of funds, or
close enough ports, make other Arctic seas except the
Norwegian-controlled Barents Sea highly unlikely, even impossible sites
of expanding drilling (Eliasson 2017). The [[melting
perennial]{.underline}]{.mark} and [multi-year Arctic ice]{.underline}
will not only [rai[se sea levels]{.mark}]{.underline}, [but will lead to
[**extinction**s of microorganisms dependent on
ice]{.mark}]{.underline}. This will lead to [[**dramatic existential
problems** for Arctic life]{.underline}]{.mark}, [including the many
[fishing and hunting dependent populations]{.mark}]{.underline} (Dodds &
Nuttall 2019).

There is a case to be made to claim that Karl Marx is the greatest
critic of capitalism as an economic system and has influenced socialist
movements worldwide. Even today his arguments are with us in a lot of
scholarly texts and give us a nuanced view over capitalist development
and how it creates inequality on a massive scale and exploits the
laboring class for profit for the capitalist class. It's evident that
[in the 21st century we live with a strong focus on human rights,
[sustainability and environmental focus]{.mark} that **[we need another
system that is sustainable moving forward]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In my
theoretical part I have used Marxist theory both by Gramsci and Lenin to
illustrate that the capitalist class often controls the state through
what Gramsci calls the cultural hegemony of the state. That makes the
task at hand much greater. Because not only do [we [need to tackle an
economic system built on eternal growth and exploitation. A socialist
movement will also have to combat the capitalist hegemony of the
state]{.mark}. This is important if we ever are to be able to get a more
**[humanistic democratic development]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Because the
structure of the state and its democracy is often made to serve the
capitalist class. I'd like to showcase [an example from Norway. Norway
has the largest sovereign oil fund in the world now numbering 19000
billion kroner. And at the same time extinguishing poverty would cost 13
billion kroner, compared to the grand sum of the oil fund. It is just an
example to show why [capitalist led development isn't
sustainable]{.mark} and why [we need socialism]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Kerala model of development The first year of my bachelor studies here
at Oslo Met we did fieldwork in different parts of the Global South. My
group got assigned India, and we went to one of the most southern states
called Kerala on the south tip of India. There we did research on the
livelihoods of local fishermen in the city of Kollam. We were there for
approximately 3 weeks before we had to go home due to the corona
pandemic which made the airports close. Kerala is a very interesting
state when it comes to development in India. Its neither the richest nor
the most populous state in India. [But [if you measure development using
the]{.mark} Human Development Index ([HDI]{.mark}) which is the way one
should measure it. [Kerala scores higher]{.mark} than all the other
states of India on par with European and western countries. They [have
been able to achieve these results by having]{.mark} a more [egalitarian
focus on redistribution]{.mark} [and]{.mark} on [social
welfare]{.mark}.]{.underline} What's interesting about this example is
the fact that in Kerala they have had a mix of rule by the Indian
Communist Party and the Indian Congress Party almost exclusively.
[**[That's why they have been able to have a stronger focus on
redistribution and social welfare]{.mark}.** This example proves that
[electing Marxi]{.mark}sts to positions of power leads to a [more
sustainable]{.mark} [human]{.mark} [dev]{.mark}elopment]{.underline}.
Which is one of my main arguments in this thesis as it seeks to
discursively change power relations in favor of the laboring class. It's
also interesting to note that the education system is of such quality
that a lot have access to education which allows them to work abroad and
send back remittances to their families. [**The [results are so
remarkable from]{.mark} this development that people have started to
call it the [Kerala model of development]{.mark}**. And this development
has been a[chieved without foreign capital,]{.mark} aid]{.underline} and
limited economic growth (Smukkestad, 2013, pg 192). UNDP reports confirm
the importance of which political parties or policies that run society.
They show that even with a low median income it's possible to fight
poverty and inequality. For a comparison in the India state of Bihar the
share of poor people is around 80 percent while in Kerala its 13
percent. Kerala has had radical socialist parties in power for long
periods of time (Eriksen, 2017, pg 25). Another fact about Kerala is
that Norway had its first aid project there. Norway was helping the
fishermen in Kerala with technology and money transfer, new boats etc,
the project started in 1952 (Eriksen, 2017, pg 298). Zapatistas of
mexico I would like to discuss the [[Zapatista]{.mark} army of national
liberation]{.underline} (Ejèrcito Zapatista de liberaciòn National,
**[EZLN]{.underline}**) because [they [have a decolonial anti-capitalist
project]{.mark} of liberation from the Mexican state.]{.underline} The
EZLN goes back to 2002 when Emiliano Zapata organized an agrarian
revolutionary movement in the south of Mexico. Their rallying cry was:
"Tierra y Libertad!" which can be translated as Land and Freedom! The
Zapatistas go back to the Mexican revolution of 1910-20 and is organized
around small rural indigenous villages. Whereas as the military wing the
EZLN started on 17 November. 1983. It's a strict military [[organization
with hierarchies and structure but]{.mark} at the same time **[its
direction is decided by revolutionary indigenous communities of the
Zapatistas community]{.mark}**. It only [acts on consultation]{.mark} of
the Zapatistas community,]{.underline} which is to say [it's quite
[democratically run]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The EZLN is comprised
of volunteering soldiers that fight for self-defense of the Zapatistas
community. Their aim is to eventually put down their weapons if a
peaceful resolution is achieved (Levi & Mohammed, 2022, Pg 84). One
could argue that [the Zapatistas project is **[decolonial and
anti-capitalist in its nature]{.mark}**]{.underline} and that's why I am
using them as [an example on how [development can be done in another way
than the market liberal]{.mark} one. I]{.underline}n 1983 a handful of
volunteers headed to the southern jungle of Chiapas to start a guerilla
detachment with the aim of bringing forth a socialist state. They had
support of other dissident Marxists, proletarian socialists and
liberation theologists. The movement has in a large part been influenced
by Maya culture and indigenous groups (Levi & Mohammed, 2022, Pg 84).
The movement Zapatismo in its current form have indigenous worldviews
and ways of being. [This helps define the Zapatismo movement as highly
democratic since its [organized by local indigenous
groups]{.mark}]{.underline}. (Levi & Mohammed, 2022, Pg 85) [The
indigenous population of Chiapas have withstood 5 centuries of ongoing
colonial violence, land dispossession and exploitation. That's the
reasons why the indigenous peoples organized into the Zapatismo
movement. [In the face of]{.mark} all this [exploitation]{.mark} in the
name of capitalism the workers, [farmers and indigenous people organized
to fight back]{.mark}]{.underline}! In 1994 The North Atlantic Free
Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was signed and came into effect. The effects and
ramifications of NAFTA was so severe for the farmers and local
indigenous peoples that the Zapatistas named this agreement a "Death
Certificate" for indigenous People. (Levi & Mohammed, 2022, Pg 85). The
[NAFTA agreement eliminated price controls on domestic
products]{.underline}, for example coffee. It's also resulted in Mexico
flooding over in American produced corn which was subsidized thereby
directly affecting all small farmers and production in Mexico. This
[resulted in uprooting thousands of working poor and farmers from their
farms and homes.]{.underline} Alongside NAFTA the Mexican government
amended their article 27 of the constitution that resulted in land
privatization and stopped the possibilities for communal land holding.
[Many indigenous Mexican farmers and food producers were ousted from
their communities and lost their livelihoods. Urbanization followed as
the disposed moved to the cities and sought employment there. These jobs
were exploitative sweatshops and warehouses. Labor conditions in these
places could be hazardous and dangerous]{.underline} (Levi & Mohammed,
2022, Pg 85). [These types of jobs were increasing due to foreign
investment and capital]{.underline}. I am going to illustrate the main
point here with a quote: "Its key to note here that \`free trade\` and
the growing presence of transnational corporations represent direct
threats to the livelihood strategies and ways of being for peasants and
indigenous people, which is true not only in the context of Central
America, but also all over the world." (Levi & Mohammed, 2022, Pg 86).
[Other Mexican workers and peasants had no other choice than to try to
cross the border to create a better life. With the border enforcement of
the USA this was no easy task and many endured dehydrations and faced
interment in camps. In the light of this power struggle with a
political/economic consortium of technocrats and Neoliberals, the
Zapatistas chose to fight back]{.underline}. Their slogan was "Against
Neoliberalism, for Humanity!". In 1994 on the eve when NAFTA was to take
effect in 1994 insurgents from EZLN came out from their hiding places
and fought back against this economic system. Seeing how the system was
rigged against them the Zapatistas declared that enough was enough (Levi
& Mohammed, 2022, Pg 86). The fighting lasted around 12 days, but it
showcased the Zapatist movement globally. This garnered support for
their movement, and one could say it was a political event they took
advantage of. When the fighting stopped there were attempts on a
peaceful resolution trough the San Andrès Accords. This treaty mandated
that the Mexican government must recognize the rights, culture, land and
dignity of the indigenous peoples. Eventually the negotiations stalled
and eventually failed due to the Mexican state. The government tried to
offer amnesty to the Zapatist fighters but continued to militarize. The
Zapatistas responded to this offer of 66 amnesty by issuing their own
statement. Il Showcase parts of it here to give the reader a clearer
notion of what this conflict was about. (Levi & Mohammed, 2022, Pg
86-87). "Why do we need to be pardoned? What are we pardoned for? For
not dying of hunger? For not accepting misery in silence? For not
accepting the historic burden of disdain and abandonment? For having
risen up in arms after we found all other paths closed? For not heeding
the Chiapas Penal Code, one of the most absurd and repressive in
history? For showing the rest of the country and the whole world that
human dignity still exists even among the world's poorest peoples? For
having been carefully prepared before we began our uprising? For
carrying guns into battle rather than bows and arrows? For being
Mexicans? For being mainly Indigenous people? For calling on the people
of Mexico to fight by whatever means necessary for that which belongs to
them? For fighting for freedom, democracy and justice? For not following
the example of previous guerilla armies? For refusing to surrender? For
not giving up? For not selling out? For not betraying are cause? Ho must
ask for Pardon -- and who can grant it? (Levi & Mohammed, 2022, Pg
87-88)." Their impassioned response and disrespectful answer to the
state's offer of amnesty illustrate well what the Zapatistas are
fighting for but also why they are fighting. Since that time the Mexican
government and the paramilitaries have been leading a counter insurgency
against the Zapatistas. (Levi & Mohammed, 2022, Pg 88)." [The Zapatistas
have been [focused on building **their movement**]{.mark}**,** true
education and praxis but also [by working together as a
community]{.mark}.]{.underline} One could say their education is both
decolonial and anti-capitalist in its nature. [The Zapatistas main aim
is to protect the indigenous peoples, and they aim to fight all forms of
oppression. By building up their communities the Zapatists are
protecting themselves and indigenous peoples from capitalism and
colonialism. The Zapatistas are practicing [reciprocal]{.mark}
[dignity]{.mark} and [aiming to live in collective
harmony]{.mark}.]{.underline} (Levi & Mohammed, 2022, Pg 88)." Zapatista
education is rooted in political struggle, it gives them an awareness of
injustice and a focus on social transformation. One can compare this to
Paulo Freie's pedagogy of the oppressed. Because the Zapatistas focus on
how the poor and indigenous peoples often are targets of subjugation and
domination. One of their famous cries is \`Tierra y Libertad !\` which
can be translated into land and freedom. This is because the indigenous
peoples need land to survive on and therefore one could say the movement
is land based (Levi & Mohammed, 2022, Pg 89)." An important point in
education which the Zapatistas focus on is that education is not
politically neutral. Particularly when poverty and oppression are
created by capitalist exploitation and state power. [They have
established their own separate autonomous schools to further their
vision and solidify their break with the state]{.underline}. Education
plays a pivotal role in a rebellious movement like the Zapatistas, One
could argue that the Zapatistas are embodying the spirit of revolt
through their focus on education. It's important to note that it's not
only that the Zapatistas have broken with the state but also it is an
outright rejection of capitalist profit logic and neoliberal ideas.
(Levi & Mohammed, 2022, Pg90)." Zapatist education features what we can
consider as normal courses writing, math and science but also there is a
heavy focus on the revolutionary history of Mexico which illustrates why
a focus on political education can benefit the movement. [The education
also focusses on teaching about the different indigenous languages and
customs of the different Zapatista regions.]{.underline} In this master
thesis my focus has been on how we can see if capital-centered
development is sustainable. I have included different theoretical
extracts to illustrate different sides of capitalist-led development and
how it affects the broader world and development. One of the main
aspects my initial research shows is that a lot of [**[development
\[now\] is led by the rich and powerful for the rich and
powerful]{.mark}.** One of the central themes in capital-led development
is capital accumulation. It is [rarely about what is moral and
ethical]{.mark} for society as whole.]{.underline} 68 I have added
Marxist theory in this thesis to show how the capitalist class controls
society through their hegemony and are able to influence the working
classes to their own benefit. Lenin's critique of the democratic states
as a machine for capitalism gives us a valid perspective. This is
because the elites are pushing the idea that democracy will always lead
to better development for society as whole. Most people unfortunately do
not realize that democracy is a system that supposedly gives people the
same right to vote and participate. At the same time the voting system
is being rigged to keep the ruling class in power. This can be done by
several means, both by gerrymandering the system itself and with the
amount of capital needed to run for office. Lenin claims that any
society who has private ownership of land and production keeps the
laboring classes in subjection. It is a very valid critique of
capitalist led development. [[Progress cannot be measured in growth
either as the capital class claims]{.mark}. We have [a lot of]{.mark}
[other indicator]{.mark}s who can [tell]{.mark} us [if people live
longer and are happier]{.mark}. This is more important than economic
growth that mainly benefits the rich and elites. Economic growth is also
essential for capitalist-led development to work. It can almost be seen
as a foundation and driver of capitalist-led development. [In this
development the accumulation of wealth is important]{.mark}. This can be
seen as a hegemonic discourse or a paradigm in the 21st
century]{.underline}. [[The state's role is central when we think of
development]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is because the national states
are formed around ethnic lines to serve the interest of its population.
Yet many fail to realize that the state has multiple purposes and aims[.
The state can dictate national development even in a time of history
when we have a global economic system of mostly free trade and
unfettered capitalism. At the same time most, states have a dual purpose
both by being a tool for capitalist growth and on the other hand serving
the people by being a national state. That is why we see examples of
[states]{.mark} having a large natural resource revenue, for instance,
oil, gas, minerals, or other resources. They are [willing to invest a
lot of capital into the extraction of these resources]{.mark} but are
[not]{.mark} always [willing to provide basic services]{.mark} like
health services or a proper educational system.]{.underline} This is
because for them it [is more economical to use money to increase natural
resource extraction.]{.underline} I think this is a clear example of the
duality of the state's role and Gramsci's idea about the cultural
hegemony of the state is relevant here. An important note is that all
austerity policies governments have implemented after the financial
crisis have mainly been helping countries with deficits while keeping
the population equally poor. I mean there is no point in a rich state to
do this if large parts of society remain poor. This is one of the main
critiques against capitalist-led development, that always takes
capital's side and never helps the workers with a reduction of work
hours, more pay, or better pensions. At the same time this development
is keeping the Global South in poverty so that the Global North can
extract resources they need for global economics. I have written about
changes in the international development sector after Donald Trump took
office in the USA for the second time. The effects these changes are
having around the world spells disaster for international development as
it has been since the Bretton Woods negotiations after the Second World
War. I have illustrated that these changes impact many aid organizations
around the world, even those in Norway. One could argue that the fact
that Trump was reelected as president is a result of capitalism and
money in politics in the US. This is why oligarchical development is bad
for development as whole. First, it puts too much power in the hands of
the oligarchs, and they make bad decisions on behalf of society. As the
aid changes show these decisions made in the US are hampering world
development in the Global North but especially in the Global South. In
the Global North people who are working in the aid sector lose their
jobs. Whereas in the Global South people who are dependent on
international aid lose access to this, and that could be anything from
food and water deliveries, funding for education and schooling and help
with mine clearing in former conflict areas. At the same time the
Ukraine war is still ongoing, Trump has been trying to force the parties
to talk peace. These discussions have not been fruitful and for many of
us who watches the news in the west it seems like Putin and Russia is
not willing to stop the fighting. From a humanitarian point of view this
war is counteractive to sustainable development. First, because of the
suffering the war leads to in Ukraine and Russia but also because the
only one who profits from this war is the US military industrial
complex. One could argue it is a result of capitalist-led development.
At the same time the war is drawing on resources that are being sent as
military aid instead of as bilateral or multilateral aid to the Global
South. I have also discussed Trumps trade wars in this thesis. The
reason it is very important is that it shifts the macroeconomic
situation and makes the world more unstable. On the one hand, our
economic system is global, and we are all dependent on it in some way or
another. On the 70 other hand, the nations of the world need a stable
economic system to coexist and trade with each other, especially if we
aim to develop the Global South. This economic instability could also
lead to more conflicts between nations for example USA and China which
would have far reaching consequences for the rest of the world. At the
same time, we have seen that the stock market and global finance markets
are tanking due to Trumps economic policy which affect the whole world.
The main point in this thesis has been to show how [[capitalist-led
development is failing]{.mark} both [humanity and the world.]{.mark} The
hegemonic economic system's only feat is to make the rich and powerful
richer at the cost of workers and the planet. The system thrives on
exploiting both natural resources and people in its search for
profit.]{.underline} The UN sustainable report shows very clearly that
we are regressing on many of the SDG targets and that emissions are
increasing globally. It is easy to see that this does not line up with
the Brundtland commission's definition of sustainability. I think
Selwyn's 10 points for democratic development go in the right direction.
It is essential that workers get more power over society than they have
today. That is why the solution would be to work for a Marxist
revolution any way one can. Preferably through democratic and peaceful
means. I have also discussed Gramsci and his theory about hegemony and
showed with Marxist theory how most democratically states are
essentially trapped in a capitalisms hegemonic grip and are in large
part controlled by the bourgeoisie in most parts of the world. For real
humanistic democratic development to work this must change. The one
thing the working class can do to fight this system is to organize
unions and political parties and fight back! As Selwyn points out,
[capital interests are often in stark contrast to workers' interests. It
is not as simple as only about workers and capitalists. I mean **the
planet itself is at stake and it is currently forming the basis for all
human life.** **If we let the [capitalists destroy the planet in their
search for profit, we can stop talking about development at
all.]{.mark}**]{.underline} That is why [development studies in general
must become more sceptic of accepting the capitalist logic that comes
from the hegemonic capitalist grip of the state.]{.underline} What [is
the alternative to this unsustainable development]{.underline}? I would
like to think that there [must be a path to socialism]{.underline}.
There are some aspects that make this road a bit difficult, and I will
elaborate on these. The first but main problem we have today is that
people lack class consciousness because of the how they are trapped in
this hegemonic capitalist culture. To combat this, **[[we will have to
break the cultural hegemony and ensure that people are
educated]{.mark}]{.underline}** 71 **[either through schools, unions or
political parties]{.underline}**. The text I have used for **[Zapatists
is applicable in this sense. The Zapatists have gone far in creating
their own education system based on indigenous knowledge and working as
a collective, they have also broken with the hegemonic grip of the
state.]{.underline}** Perhaps this could be an opportunity for some
parts of the world like one could envisage states in the Global South
delinking from the global economic system. Essentially, it is important
that states in the Global South can fend for themselves without losing
all their raw material to Global North. [The other aspect is that the
s[ocialism]{.mark} we have seen [in history]{.mark} mostly inspired by
the Russian revolution has [not been democratic or led to better
development]{.mark}]{.underline}. One could say there were some good
things with the Soviet system. For instance, how people were entitled to
housing pensions and a working health system. Some would argue that
women had better reproductive rights in East Germany then they have
today, and social housing was a thing in Berlin where they had Karl Marx
Allee and other projects. It is interesting to think of a reality where
people were not afraid of investment barons that would throw them out or
speculate in housing because in DDR there were none. (People's World,
2019) I am using this example to emphasize that some aspects of society
worked for workers and the people. Yet in a free democratic society we
are totally dependent on a free independent press that objectively gives
us news from the world. Freedom of expression is essential in a
democratic society. These were things that essentially were missing in
the Soviet system and often also are quite unfree under capitalism. The
great crux with capitalism is that it is presented to us as great
freedom. Most of our media is controlled by different interest
organizations and many of them are also owned by the rich and powerful.
For a society to function properly, it is therefore important that we
have a truthful and independent media that gives us a fair
representation of what is happening in the world. Another aspect is that
these Soviet states were not democratic and were controlled by a
powerful elite that held all power in society. If we are to succeed with
a democratic path to socialism in our current time, it is important that
we ensure that the state is run democratically for the people. Freedom
of expression and the right to organize free labor unions will have to
be guaranteed to ensure that the workers and people feel that democracy
has value for them. As I stated in the background chapter, I am an
elected politician for the Norwegian Red party. It is therefore not a
secret that I advocate for a more socialist Marxist development for
society 72 and the world as whole. [[We need a shift]{.mark} in policy
from capitalist-led development [to a more socialist humanist
development]{.mark}. Capitalism thrives on creating inequality and
expropriating wealth and resources from the world and its people. The
idea is that socialist development will help create a more egalitarian
development that has a larger focus on helping the poor and not
expropriating as many resources from the globe we live on]{.underline}.
It will help develop the Global South because more resources will be
diverted to help the Global South develop. More resources for
development will increase multilateral and bilateral aid cooperation
with the Global North. A new development paradigm would have to be
anti-capitalist, and by that, I mean not letting the rich and powerful
dictate development policy as we have seen in the US with the USAID cuts
from the current government and oligarchs. Since the neoliberal shift in
the 1980's too much power has been given to market liberal policy makers
who have shifted the world's focus away from sovereign national states
and towards focusing only on capitalist growth and economics. Tax cuts
have been given to the richest portion of society by the idea that
socalled trickle-down economics will benefit all. At the same time many
development thinkers as I have shown in the thesis have both debunked
the growth paradigm of capitalism but also pointed out that we need
redistribution and not growth! [This is why politics matter in
development because it is an alternative that lets the population vote
as a means of sharing power. It is a clear alternative to a revolution
by any class in society]{.underline}. Yet Lenin points out that most
nations calling themselves a democratic state are essentially trapped in
the capitalist shell. That is why it is important to support democratic
socialist movements around the globe because it is the only way to stop
the development we have under capitalism where more and more power is
concentrated among the rich and powerful. Marxism is thus the only
answer to today's power concentration under capitalism. We should aim to
organize unions, build and vote for political parties that want to break
with this capitalist hegemony that we live in. One the one hand because
it impacts development and on the other hand from a climate
perspective**[. [If we do not break with this economic system, it might
be the end of this world as we know it. We only have this one planet and
if the capital interests are allowed its pursuit of eternal economic
growth, we might not have a planet left.]{.mark}]{.underline}** In this
thesis I have illustrated several of the SDGs and the 2030 agenda. The
UN report shows that the world is severely off track to reach the 2030
agenda. One could argue that this 73 is not strange in a world where we
do not prioritize aid to Global South because the world is busy with
capitalist growth mechanics and wars that are draining resources away
from development. What is great about the UN report is that it gives us
very clear statistical data on how the current situation is and what
needs to be done to improve development for the Global South. We have
probably had 70 years of this development so why are things not better
than they are today? That is why I point out that we live in a
capitalist hegemony where other factors draw focus away from
development. [We [must build]{.mark} a Marxist [socialist movement that
is better able to care for the planet and the people who live on
it]{.mark}. A system that does not thrive on exploitation of the
laboring class and the planet.]{.underline} At the same time, a system
that gives people more freedom and free time. It is important that
people have time to care for their children, pursue a political career
or work creatively with the arts. Those are just a few examples, but the
logic is [clear capitalism is directly contradicting humans' freedom on
this planet. I have shown in my research that most of the GDP growth
goes to the capital class. Which essentially means most people are
locked to an economic system that they do not profit from and are also
not good for development globally.]{.underline}

The Climate emissions we experience in our time are adversely affecting
the Global South more than the Global North. Even so the documented rise
in temperatures by the UN is affecting our planet in ways that
irreversibly will change it for the worse. Since the early 1900's
glaciers around the world have been melting. [[Capitalism is the direct
cause for this with its emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse
gas emissions]{.mark}]{.underline} that are responsible for increasing
emissions. It would also be wrong to say that this is caused by human
activity when we all know these emissions are tied to the economic
system itself (WWF). Melting ice and glaciers will lead to increasing
sea levels. In turn this will result in coastal land erosion and lead to
more frequent storms like hurricanes and typhoons. [[Greenland and the
Antarctic ice sheets are today the largest contributors to rising sea
levels due to the rising temperatures]{.mark}. How fast these ice sheets
melt will determine how fast the water levels will rise]{.underline}.
Alarmingly if the Greenland ice glacier alone melts it will account for
a 20feet increase in water levels which would be catastrophic for
coastal zones around the world. I will use a quote by the WWF to
illustrate how bad the situation is: "[[Even if we significantly curb
emissions in coming decades, more than a third of the world's remaining
glaciers will melt before the year 2100]{.mark}. When it comes to sea
ice, 95% of the oldest and thickest ice is already gone" (WWF).
Scientist predictions are that the arctic could be ice free in the
summer as soon as the year 2040 if emissions keep going at the current
level.]{.underline} An interesting fact with development studies is the
thought that we are to develop the Global South up to the level of
development in the Global North. That will put more strain on the energy
sector as more people will have access to higher living standards.
Especially if we look to the large populations of India and China. The
UN states that 65% of emissions stem from coal carbon emissions and that
Co2 emissions are at a critical level for temperature rise.

the case. After surveys of the history and practice of the general

illustrative recent manifestations, the proactive general strike seems a
viable nonpartisan national policy instrument.much from our own labor
history and from the general strike incidents and purposes in other
nations

A SYNOPTIC HISTORY OF THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF THE GENERAL. STRIKE
Broadly speaking, a [[general strike is]{.mark}]{.underline} a \"strike
by a large num-ber of workers in different industries, which aims to
paralyze a nation\'s or region\'s economy and government for political
or economic purposes.\"22 It is the [[embodiment of dissatisfaction with
the status quo.]{.underline}]{.mark} General strikes can take many
forms. In the United States, our tradition of business unionism in the
capitalist political economy dictates a largely economic perspective. In
other countries, however, the general strike has also been uti-lized
more broadly as a political instrument to lead public and labor
coalitions against, for example, the racist apartheid regime in South
Africa?3 and against communism in Poland during the Solidarity era a
quarter century ago.Historically, the general strike l has been closely
associated in the United States with syndicalism,\"a revolutionary
political movement that aims by the general strike and direct action of
labor unions to overthrow parliamentary democracy and estab-lished a
corporate society with general control in the hands of trade unions and
workers\' cooperatives.\"25 [[General strikes]{.mark}]{.underline} can
generally be categorized as either [[revolutionary attempts at radi-cal
change in society]{.underline}]{.mark}, or as reformist initiatives for
more incre-mental political or economic change.The latter is the only
workable, viable conceptual and practical architecture possible in the
United States. The major catalyst for the success of any strike is broad
and leep public sympathy and support for the particular labor union\'s
predicament.Ultimately, the success of a general strike depends largely
on the degree of organization. In the past, most general strikes failed
because they were not well organized. The modern general strike first
originated in France in 1887. The Montlucon Congress of the National
Federation of Syndicats considered it as a labor weapon, with antecedent
roots in the French and Industrial Revolutions. The French govern-ment
offers a simple rule for distinguishing general strikes from
conventional labor strikes: concerted labor action against several
enterprises simultaneously is considered a general strike A. The United
States The first general strike in the United States took place in1919
in Seattle.During a year where the Boston police and New England
telephone employees separately struck, the Seattle strike was remarkable
because sixty thousand workers partici-The strike was initially called
by metal trade workers in Pocal shipyards, as the workers were bitterly
disappointed after expecting a post-war wage increase following two
prior years of federally imposed wage controls. The local and national
press denounced the strike as Bolshevism. The general strike ended
unsuccessfully after one week.While strike activity was minimal in the
early 1930s due to the Great Depression and the virtual collapse of
business activ-ity,3° in 1934, militant strike activity in Toledo, San
Francisco, and Minneapolis affected most major industries.31 Toledo,
Ohio witnessed the strike against Auto-Lite, a spark plug manufacturer
that was one of the largest regional employers at the time. The strike
began as a conventional economic labor dispute, with fears of layoffs
due to industrial changes. Initially, the strike was not significant
beyond the interests of the workers and Auto-Lite. A judicial
injunction, however, provoked violence between strikers and the police.
It captured public attention on the eve of the enactment of the National
Labor Relations Act in 1935. strike resulted in the establishment of a
conventional collective bargaining relationship with
Auto-Lite.Meanwhile, a general strike occurred in 1934 in San
Fran-cisco.33 It began on the shipping docks and was led by Harry
Bridges, a labor organizer from Australia. The strike by the
International Longshoremen\'s Association (ILA) concerned wages, working
conditions, coast-wide bargaining rights, and the establishment of
union-controlled hiring halls. Initially, it began as a conventional
labor strike. On May 9, twelve thousand long. shoremen went on strike;
thirty-five thousand more workers from eight additional maritime unions
joined the strike by May 23.34 When two strikers were killed during
pitched street battles with police on July 5, 1934-\"Bloody
Thursday\"---it was transformed into a general strike. Throughout San
Francisco and Oakland. virtually every union joined in support of the
dockworkers. Many of the economic labor demands of the longshoremen
ultimately were met, and the parameters of the ILA labor contracts on
the West Coast were effectively set for several decades. Harry Bridges
was repeatedly prosecuted for alleged communism. Meanwhile, on the East
Coast, the textile industry encoun-tered the [[general strike of
1934]{.underline}]{.mark}.Due to [[deteriorating
working]{.underline}]{.mark} [[conditions]{.mark} and widespread
elimination of jobs, a strike that commenced [in New England
]{.mark}]{.underline}eventually [affected the textile industry from
Maine to Alabama]{.underline}.36 Over 170,000 workers struck in the
South, with most strikers concentrated in North Carolina.Despite the
large population of workers involved, the organizers did not organize
adequately or direct the strike. Rather than striking simultaneously,
they struck Southern mills after having first struck the Northern
textile mills, allowing Southern manage-ment, police, and authorities
precious time to better prepare to withstand the strike. Due to poor
organization, the east coast strike ceased after three weeks. Many
strikers were subsequently blacklisted in the industry.

Nevertheless, there were some [[positive
ramifications.]{.underline}]{.mark} President [Roosevelt and the
Democratic Party [recognized the political influence of the
South]{.mark} for the first time since Reconstruction.The strike
[offered lessons in solidarity for]{.mark} seemingly [culturally
disparate Northern and Southern workers]{.mark}.]{.underline}From 1936
to 1937, the successful sit-down strike by the United Auto Workers Union
(UAW) against General Motors Corporation (GM) in Flint, Michigan
captured world attention. It remains the single most critically
important labor conflict in the history of the United States. The sheer
numerical and economic enormity of the strike was like no other before
it.38 [[Flint, Michigan]{.mark}]{.underline} was a vital center for auto
manufacturing, with ten GM facto-ries. The [[workers demanded better
wages and conditions]{.underline}]{.mark}, and GM recognition of the
UAW. The sit-down strike began in December, 1936; the workers remained
at their posts in the workplace after their shift, making further
production impossible[[.The sit-down strike had numerous
advantages]{.underline}]{.mark} over conventional picketing outside the
workplace. Since the workers were indoors together, this increased
morale and deterred potential strikebreakers from taking their
jobs.Settlement talks began in Detroit in January 1937. In mid-February,
a settlement was reached; GM recognized the UAW, and [[hourly wages were
increased]{.underline}]{.mark}. More than 136,000 workers were idled
during the [[sit-down strike, costing GM an estimated \$175 million in
lost revenues]{.underline}]{.mark}.Yet like the West Coast dockworkers
in 1934, the Flint autoworkers in 1937 [[achieved employer recognition
of their union]{.underline}]{.mark} and set the broad terms for their
collective bargaining and labor management relationship for the balance
of the century.

During a protest on the evening that Wisconsin's state senate passed its
notorious union-busting bill, many union members and their supporters
chanted ["general strike!" They were not just venting about assaults on
wages, benefits, and union rights. They were considering what it would
take to stop the attacks.]{.underline}

[Workers around the world --- in the U.S. as much as anywhere --- have
often found the [general strike]{.mark} to be [a powerful weapon for
improving their conditions or defending their
rights]{.mark}.]{.underline} Can those pages from history be today's
playbook for the toilers itching to fight back?

Labor history 101. A [[general strike]{.mark} encompasses workers from a
broad range of occupations and [shuts down]{.mark} the delivery of [all
private and public goods]{.mark} and services in an area]{.underline},
such as a city or state. They usually occur at a time of heightened
economic tension, when employers are demanding big concessions from
labor, or even trying to destroy unions. Sometimes [a defensive
[struggle of one union can spread]{.mark} as other unions --- as well as
non-union workers, students, and the broader community --- [join the
fray to express solidarity]{.mark} and broaden the demands of the
struggle to include their issues.]{.underline}

Many of these titanic battles have erupted on U.S. soil. The "Great
Upheaval" of 1877 started as a railroad strike against wage cuts that
spread from the east coast to the Midwest. Entire communities joined in,
challenging the power of banks, manufacturing corporations, and even
state and local governments. Federal troops pulled out of the South
after Reconstruction quelled this uprising. But the nationwide
wage-cutting craze was slowed considerably.

During the 1919 Seattle General Strike some 60,000 workers walked off
the job in support of striking shipyard workers. Organized by the
Central Labor Council, the strike brought city businesses to a
standstill. For five days workers' committees operated everything, from
mass strike kitchens to essential services such as hospital deliveries.
An [historic lesson was taught --- [the working class can run
society]{.mark}.]{.underline} And without the bosses!

In the depth of the Great Depression, in 1934, there were general
strikes in San Francisco, Minneapolis, and Toledo. [Industrial
[unionism]{.mark} was [proving its mettle]{.mark}, and unions used
audacious tactics, including sit-down strikes and roving pickets. When
bosses compelled local governments to launch crackdowns or even summon
the National Guard, many workers, both [employed and unemployed, came to
the defense of strikers]{.mark}.]{.underline} It was the ferocity and
tenacity of those fighters that pressured Congress to pass the National
Labor Relations Act in 1935, establishing the collective bargaining
rights that so many are trying to preserve today.

[Glimpses of a better world. The [strikes]{.mark} above [showed]{.mark}
working [people]{.mark} the [tremendous power they have]{.mark}, and
inspired them [to imagine a better world, where exploitation is not
inevitable]{.mark} and unending.]{.underline}

Unfortunately, these lessons are lost on many current labor officials.
In Wisconsin, leaders of large teachers and public employee unions have
reined in mass protest and put the kibosh on any talk of a general
strike, instead focusing all energy into electoral recall campaigns
intended to get more Democrats into office.

Embattled unionists and their community allies don't need another pile
of promises from politicians. So what can a general strike deliver?

For starters, [such [a strike can demand]{.mark} from the government
[real solutions to]{.mark} the economic [crisis]{.mark}. It can
[declare]{.mark}: "It is time to create jobs for all, insure the
survival of poor people, and provide quality public services like
healthcare, childcare and education. [It can be
done]{.mark}]{.underline} --- end the wars and tax the rich and
corporate profits NOW! And hands off our collective bargaining rights!"
[[When the working class doesn't show up for work]{.mark}, thereby
[bring]{.mark}ing [the economy and all profit making to a]{.mark}
screeching [halt]{.mark}, these reasonable demands more [easily
penetrate]{.mark} the [pro-corporate]{.mark} skulls of the
[politicians]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Also, [the [general strike]{.mark} can [unite]{.mark} all the
[toilers]{.mark}. Public and private sector unions, students and
workers, public employees and the people who need the services they
provide, the employed and the jobless --- [all]{.mark} can [come
together]{.mark} and [build solidarity that]{.mark} will [last long
after]{.mark} the big [strike]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### There is popular support for a General Strike now

**Brecher '25** \[Jeremy Brecher, 4-8-2025, \"What would a general
strike in the US actually look like?\", Waging Nonviolence,
https://wagingnonviolence.org/2025/04/what-would-general-strike-in-the-us-look-like/\]

Something is in the air: [A perception that [American democracy]{.mark}
and livable conditions for working people may [only be saved by]{.mark}
the kind of [large-scale nonviolent]{.mark} direct [action]{.mark}
variously [called "general strikes,]{.mark}]{.underline}" "political
strikes," or, as I will refer to all of them, "social strikes."

Calls for mass disruptive action are coming from unlikely places, like
[Anthony Romero, executive director of the ACLU, an organization
normally associated with legal action through the courts. When
[Romero]{.mark} was asked in a recent interview what would happen if the
Trump administration systematically defied court orders, he
[replied]{.mark}, "Then [we've got to take to the streets]{.mark} in a
different way. [We've got to shut down this
country]{.mark}."]{.underline}

[Similarly senior Democratic [Rep. Jim McGovern said]{.mark}, "[We
can't]{.mark} just sit back and [let our democracy]{.mark} just [fall
apart]{.mark}. What [we need]{.mark} to think about are things like
maybe [a national strike across this country]{.mark}."]{.underline}

Some in organized labor are also entering the fray. Sara Nelson, head of
the Association of Flight Attendants, recently said that American
workers --- [no matter what they do or what sector they are in --- now
have "very [few options but to join together]{.mark} to organize [for a
general strike]{.mark}." (She led the organizing for a national general
strike that successfully deterred Trump's attempt to shut down the
government in his first term.)]{.underline}

Meanwhile, online, there are even more ad hoc efforts demonstrating the
tactic's appeal right now. For instance, [[more than 300,000
people]{.mark} have [signed]{.mark} cards pledging [to participate in a
general strike]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Calling for general strikes is a staple of the radical toolkit. (I've
made questionable efforts to call two or three myself over the past
half-century.) But [[why has the idea of]{.mark} such [mass
actions]{.mark} suddenly [appeared]{.mark} on the lips of such a wide
range of people[?]{.mark} There are three principal
reasons:]{.underline}

[[1.]{.mark} The wide range of [people being harmed by]{.mark} the
[MAGA]{.mark} juggernaut gives credibility to actions based on wide
public participation.]{.underline}

[[2.]{.mark} The [demolition of]{.mark} key [institutions of
democracy]{.mark}, constitutionalism and the rule of law is threatening
to [leave few alternatives to]{.mark} popular
[uprising]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[3.]{.mark} The fecklessness of the leadership of the Democratic Party,
as sublimely illustrated by Sen. Chuck Schumer's [passage]{.mark} in
March [of]{.mark} the devastating [MAGA budget]{.mark}, has [led to
despair about resistance]{.mark} within the institutions of
government.]{.underline}

These inescapable realities are forcing people to think in unaccustomed
ways.

I use the term [["social strikes"]{.mark} to [describe]{.mark} mass
actions people take to exercise power by [withdraw]{.mark}ing
[cooperation]{.mark} from and [disrupting]{.mark} the [operation of
society]{.mark}. The goal of a [social strike]{.mark} is to
[affect]{.mark} not just the immediate employer, but a [political
regime]{.mark} or social structure.]{.underline} Such forms of mass
direct action provide a possible alternative when institutional means of
action prove ineffective. [In all their varied forms they are based on
Gandhi's fundamental perception that "[even the most powerful cannot
rule without the cooperation of the ruled]{.mark}."]{.underline}

### Alt\-\--Ecosocialism

#### Ecosocialism is the only alternative.

One major challenge to the reinstatement of expansionary fiscal policy
that is being advocated globally to deal with the recession emerging
from the Covid-19 crisis is that [[we are]{.mark} simultaneously [faced
with]{.mark} a huge and unprecedented [ecological crisis.]{.mark}
T]{.underline}he [[world]{.underline}]{.mark}

economy [[has reached]{.mark}]{.underline} a stage where to stop
[[global heating and climate change,]{.mark}]{.underline} the goal of
[[accelerated economic growth must be replaced by]{.underline}]{.mark} a
more [[sustainable approach]{.mark} to development]{.underline} (Singh,
2008, 2008a, 2020; Castree, 2010). When the 1929-33 crisis was resolved
by the expansionary fiscal policy inspired by Keynesian economic policy,
there was neither the theoretical knowledge of the environmental
consequences of economic policy nor the material reality of the scale of
climate change which is being witnessed

now. One line of thought that recognises the enormity of global climate
change suggests that instead of the traditional expansionary policy, our
present era needs a green expansionary policy or Green Keynesianism.
Such a green expansionary or a Green Keynesian policy would entail a
drastically changed transport system, energy policy, housing policy and
creation of what are called green jobs. Undoubtedly, many of these green
policies have positive elements because one could say that [[green
capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark} is better than ungreen and dirty
capitalism, but this approach [[is evasive on]{.underline}]{.mark} the
mode of [[production-environmental destruction]{.underline}]{.mark} link
(Singh, 2020). It does not recognise that [[capitalism is]{.mark}
essentially a profit-driven economic system and is therefore [inherently
destructive]{.mark}]{.underline} of the environment.This profit-driven
system is based on exploitation of natural resources (O'Connor, 1998)
and continuously needs multiplication of consumer wants to generate the
market for the commodities produced by the use of natural resources
(Panayotakis, 2011). A [[fundamental alt]{.underline}]{.mark}ernative to
environmentally destructive capitalism [[is]{.mark} the vision of
[ecological socialism]{.mark}]{.underline} (Singh, 2010, 2010a, 2014,
2020). That vision, on one hand, does not entail the need for a welfare
state because the necessity for the welfare state arises out of
inequalities in capitalism where the poor and the disadvantaged need to
be cared for in some way but, on the other hand, implies welfare for all
because there would not be a division between the privileged few and the
underprivileged many in the eco-socialist society. However, that goal is
a long term one or a medium term one, and in the journey towards that
goal, the strengthening of the welfare state is desirable because the
idea of the welfare state recognises the institution of community and
the collective effort required in responding to some needs of the
community. Dearlove and Saunders (1984, 319) have rightly pointed out
that "The Welfare State represents a "Trojan horse" within the citadels
of capitalism in that it rests firmly on a set of values which are
fundamentally opposed to those of capitalism". Both neoliberal austerity
and Keynesian welfare/stimulus stratagems are two different forms of
governance of capitalism in response to different phases/cycles of
capitalism. The competition between them is only on which one is more
efficient, i.e. which one generates higher and maximum possible economic
growth. Both are, therefore, anti-ecological. However, from a social
equity point of view, the neoliberal austerity paradigm is far more
inegalitarian than the Keynesian welfare/stimulus one. Eco-socialism is,
therefore,[[sharply critical of neo-lib]{.mark}eral
austerity]{.underline} paradigm but has some degrees of affinity with
the ecologically modified Keynesian welfare paradigm as a basis for
building egalitarian future (Singh, 2020). Eco-socialism is emerging as
a new historically [[necessary response]{.mark}]{.underline} to the
challenges of [[environmentally destructive growth and increase in
poverty]{.mark}]{.underline} both in the developing capitalism economies
as well as in the developed capitalist economies. The programme of the
Green New Deal is the transitional path to eco-socialism (Singh, 2020).

### Alt\-\--Climate Strike Movement

#### The alternative is an inter-relational climate strike movement. Empirically, all general strike movements are rooted in climate activism--collectivizing feminist, decolonial, union movements under the umbrella of a climate strike is the best way to resist fossil capitalism. The alt solves climate change and dismantles the colonial and patriarchal foundations of neoliberalism.

A long history of the climate strike Let us then define [**[the climate
strike]{.mark}**]{.underline} normatively as a kind of strike action
that temporarily [**[disrupts]{.mark}** capital accumulation in the
[fossil-]{.mark}fuelled [capitalist system]{.mark}]{.underline} [which
has [caused]{.mark} and [continues to fuel the climate]{.mark}
[crisis]{.mark} **[in order to achieve social and ecological
improvements]{.mark}**]{.underline}. From this point of view, it would
follow that [[many forms of strike actions under capitalism could
effectively be called climate strikes, **even if not deliberately
organized as suc**]{.mark}**h**]{.underline}.Footnote45 Historically,
many victories over fossil capital have been won through various forms
of strike action -- including industrial action, feminist, anti-colonial
anti-racist strikes -- during which workers used their ability to
interrupt the otherwise incessant process of capital accumulation to
achieve political and economic concessions for themselves and others.
From this perspective, the climate strike is only the latest of
countless -- often more successful -- attempts to defeat fossil capital
through strike action. A thorough and systematic elaboration of this
long history of the climate strike unfortunately exceeds the scope of
this article, though it promises to reveal many important lessons for
today's climate strike movement. However, a mere anecdotal glance at the
histories of industrial action, anti-racist and anti-colonial strikes,
feminist strikes, and school strikes already brings to light some
important ways in which all of these struggles converge in their
opposition to fossil capitalism. Industrial action Given the complex
relationship between labour unions and the climate justice movement
today, it bears remembering that the origins of the modern labour
movement predate those of the fossil fuel industry and that many of the
[[earliest modern labour strikes were directed at preventing the
roll-out of fossil fuel infra]{.mark}structure. Consider the [first
modern]{.mark} industrial [general strike]{.mark}]{.underline}, the
English [general strike of 1842]{.underline}. The strike, which began as
a local labour dispute in the textile industry of Stalybridge near
Manchester and soon spread to other parts of the country, was fueled by
a range of concerns including rising bread prices and anger about the
increased use of steam engines in the textile industry. The workers
rightly feared these developments would lead to redundancies and health
hazards. Chanting slogans such as "Stop the smoke!," the strikers
engaged in the mass sabotage of steam engines by way of removing of
bolts and plugs from the machines' water boilers. [This destruction of
machinery,]{.underline} Malm argues in Fossil Capital, [was not
incidental, but rather constitutive of the strike,]{.underline} which
became popularly known as Plug Plot Riots.Footnote46 After months, the
strike was eventually defeated and its leaders mercilessly prosecuted,
marking a decisive victory for the emergent fossil capitalist class. As
Malm points out[, the ability to react to militant labour action
represented a major motivation for mill owners to shift their source of
energy from waterpower to steam energy in the first
place**.**]{.underline} Although water remained the cheaper source of
energy for much of the 19th century, the switch to steam power [[allowed
capitalists to move their mills from the countryside]{.mark} to the
city, where labour was more abundant and where greater police and
military resources were available to qualm
unrest.]{.underline}Footnote47 [Faced with successive triumphs of fossil
capital, the focus of militant labour activism in the Global North soon
shifted to the fossil fuel industry itself.]{.underline} The growing
systemic importance of coal meant that organized coal workers in
conjunction with railway and shipping workers could effectively shut
down the entire economy through coordinated strike actions. As Timothy
Mitchell contends in Carbon Democracy, it was the collective bargaining
power of the workers in coal mining, railways and shipping that
accounted for the effectiveness the great general strikes in Western
Europe and North America in the late 19th and early 20th
century.Footnote48 Within decades, large general strikes in England,
Germany, Belgium, the United States and elsewhere prompted the
widespread adoption of universal suffrage, the eight-hour workday, the
right to form labour unions and political organizations, and social
insurance programs such as unemployment insurance and public retirement
pensions. The eventual decline of the age of general strikes in the
Global North, Mitchell suggests, was marked by the gradual shift from
coal to oil and gas as the primary source of energy first in the United
States and later in Western Europe.Footnote49 Unlike coal, the
extraction of oil does not require a large workforce, which makes it
harder for organized labour to intercept. Moreover, oil is usually
transported through pipelines and on large tankers rather than on
railways, which also makes it harder to affect its distribution through
targeted strikes. Along with other factors, the pivot from coal to oil
and gas significantly contributed to weakening of the labour movement,
paving the way for the neoliberal revolution of the late 20th century
and an unprecedented expansion of the carbon economy. While it may
initially seem counterintuitive to think about the Plug Plot Riots or
the great general strikes as [climate strikes,]{.underline} both
constitute instances of [re[sistance to fossil capitalism and attempts
to retain democratic control over the means of
production]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In this sense, the dilemma
faced by the climate strike movement today is but a permutation of the
challenge striking workers have confronted for almost two centuries: how
to exert collective leverage most effectively in a global energy system
specifically designed to enable capital accumulation unimpeded by
organized labour and democratic control. Anti-racist and anti-colonial
strikes Even older than the modern labour movement is the struggle
against the colonial and racist structures of exploitation, which had
enabled the industrialization of the North in the first place. It was
this resistance in its various forms, including slowdowns, running away
(marronage), sabotage, or even armed uprising that made decolonization
and the abolition of slavery historical possibilities at all. This
argument has been famously made by W. E. B. DuBois, who in Black
Reconstruction argued that formal emancipation in the United States was
achieved through a "general strike" in which the "black
worker ... transferred his labour from the Confederate planter to the
Northern invader," thereby tipping the balance of the civil war in
favour of the Union: As soon, however, as it became clear that the Union
armies would not or could not return fugitive slaves, and that the
masters with all their fume and fury were uncertain of victory, the
slave entered upon a general strike against slavery by the same methods
that he had used during the period of the fugitive slave. He ran away to
the first place of safety and offered his services to the Federal Army.
So that in this way it was really true that he served his former master
and served the emancipating army; and it was also true that this
withdrawal and bestowal of his labour decided the war.Footnote50 The
[[DuBoisian general strike,]{.mark} formal [emancipation]{.mark} in the
United States, [and]{.mark} the advent o[f fossil capitalism were
related in a variety of ways]{.mark}.]{.underline} On the one hand, as
Jean-Francois Mouhot suggests, steam power strengthened the moral case
for abolitionism by changing the perception of labour in industrialized
societies, facilitating the widespread distribution of abolitionist
pamphlets via the steam-driven press, and bolstering the economic and
infrastructural might of the Northern states during the US civil
war.Footnote51 On the other hand, emancipation enabled the large-scale
transfer of labour power from the declining plantation economy into the
fossil fuel sector. As Kathryn Yusssof has pointed out, the
industrialization of the United States and the growth of its coal and
steel industry were fed by the labour power of enslaved "free" African
Americans.Footnote52 Among the largest convict labour companies were the
Alabama Iron Ore and Tennessee Coal and Iron companies, which in turn
supplied the coal mines of the U.S. Steel Corporation, set to become
time the world's largest corporation and the paragon of American
industrialization. [In the United Kingdom, the abolition of slavery in
the Caribbean 1833 was linked to a taxpayer pay out of £20 million in
"compensation" to former slave owners, which in turn was used to finance
a significant share of fossil fuel infrastructure. The complex
entanglements between fossil economy, colonialism and racism also shaped
the great anti-colonial general strikes of the 20th
century]{.underline}. Across the world, contestations over the fossil
fuel industry were at the centre of independence struggles, whether in
Baku, where an oil workers' strike played an important role in the first
Russian revolution of 1905, or in the Caribbean, where Trinidadian oil
workers spearheaded the 1937 region-wide labour unrest.Footnote53 In
Palestine, the 1936--1939 Arab revolt, the "most sustained anticolonial
uprising against the British in the twentieth century," featured mass
sabotage of the strategically important Kirkuk-Haifa pipeline, and in
South Africa, the 1946 African Mine Worker's strike heralded decades of
resistance to Apartheid.Footnote54 The increasing dependence of the
Global North on access to oil provided the working class of the South
with unprecedented political power. One of the first countries to openly
challenge the power of Western fossil capital was Mexico, where pressure
by the local oil workers union led to the government's decision to
nationalize the oil industry in 1938.Footnote55 The creation of Mexico's
state-owned oil company, PEMEX marked a watershed in the history of oil,
paving the way for a wave of nationalizations in the following decades.
In the latter half of the 20th century, the Middle East replaced Latin
America as the world's second-most-productive oil region after the
United States, which in turn greatly increased the region's workers'
political power and provided a material base to the growing political
force of Arab Nationalism. Governments in Iraq, Algeria, Syria and Libya
were able to pursue policies independent of the region's superpowers. In
Iran, Britain and the United States had supported the overthrow of Prime
Minister Mossadegh in 1953 after he had nationalized the country's oil
industry, only to see another major revolution in 1979, in which oil
workers again played a central role. Even Saudi Arabia, a staunch ally
to the United States, was able to gradually take ownership of its oil
and gas, culminating in the full nationalization of Saudi Aramco in
1980. However, as Mitchell contends[, the structural design of 20th
century fossil capitalism made it easier for governments to channel
working class pressure into various resource nationalist political
programs that left the broader imperialist world system
intact]{.underline}: As Europe switched from coal to oil, the earlier
successes of its miners and railway workers proved much harder to
replicate for the oil workers of Dhahran, Abadan and Kirkuk, or at the
pipeline terminals and refineries on the coasts of Palestine and
Lebanon. ...  The demands of oil workers for labour rights and political
freedoms could be translated into programmes of nationalisation, while
production cartels could restrict supply so that gluts of oil throughout
most of the twentieth century could be transformed into a vulnerable
"strategic resource" that needed imperial armies and vassal states to
protect it. These and many other socio-technical features of the oil
industry made it increasingly difficult to build mechanisms of more
democratic politics out of the production of oil.Footnote56 The triumph
of US-led fossil imperialism thus precipitated what Adom Getachew has
called the "fall of self-determination" in the 1970s. Getachew writes:
The differences among the Third World states became starkly visible at
the height of the oil crisis. While OPEC functioned in important ways as
a model for the kinds of commodity associations other developing nations
hoped to create and signalled what the power of collective action in the
international sphere might accomplish, the hike in oil prices and the
accompanying spike in food prices proved to be particularly painful for
the developing world.Footnote57 Wherever social movements refused to be
co-opted into political projects amenable to fossil imperialism, they
could expect to face violent repression. A case in point is the history
of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni People (MOSOP), a movement
advocating for self-determination in Nigeria's Ogoniland, where oil
extraction by Shell had led destroyed the livelihood of many
communities. In 1993, the movement mobilized more than 300 000 Ogoni in
one of the largest demonstrations in the history of the country.
Actively supported by Shell, the Nigerian government reacted with brutal
force, hanging nine Ogoni leaders on questionable charges and displacing
tens of thousands in a brutal military operation.Footnote58 As these
examples show, the [[trajectory of anti-colonial and anti-racist
struggles is intimately intertwined with the history of fossil
capitalism.]{.underline}]{.mark} Again, the climate justice movement
today faces a challenge that has long been faced by movements in the
Global South: how to [break up a fossil imperialist world order based
upon the incessant exploitation of natural resources in favor of a
global system built on the principles of solidarity, self-determination,
and ecology.]{.underline} Feminist strikes In a very different way, the
[[women's strike movement]{.mark}, too, [constitutes a struggle
against]{.mark} [fossil]{.mark} [capital]{.mark}.]{.underline} Grounded
in a feminist critique of the labour movement, whose conception of the
"general strike" overlooked the centrality of women's work as well as
reproductive labour, radical organizers in the 20th century began
advocating for specifically feminist strikes. As the Italian feminist
Mariarosa Dalla Costa wrote in 1974: We've never seen a general strike.
We've only seen men, generally men from the big factories, come out on
the streets, while their wives, daughters, sisters, mothers, went on
cooking in the kitchens.Footnote59 [The most well-attended of all the
women's strikes of the 1970s took place in Iceland, where feminist
groups were able to mobilize up to 90 percent of the country's
women]{.underline} for a national Women\'s Day Off on October 24, 1975.
The strike brought the country to a standstill, with schools, shops,
nurseries, and fish factories closing. Reportedly, it also left many men
overwhelmed with housework. A rally in the center of Reykjavik was
attended by 25,000 people, more than a tenth of the Icelandic population
at the time.Footnote60 Although the immediate effects of the strike are
disputed, the day is said to have paved the way for a number of
progressive reforms, as well as the election of Vigdis Finnbogadottir,
the world's first democratically elected female president, in 1980. More
recently, the feminist strike movement has seen a revival, notably in
the 2016 All-Polish women's strike against the criminalization of
abortion and in the #NiUnaMenos protests in Argentina and across Latin
America. In the years prior to the pandemic, annual international
women's strikes on March 8 -- explicitly inspired by the women's strikes
of the 1970s -- were held in over fifty countries.Footnote61 [The
[struggle against capitalist patriarchy]{.mark}, as many have pointed
out, [is also one against fossil capital]{.mark}, which [relies wherever
possible on patriarchal social relations to facilitate capital
accumulation.]{.mark} A prime example of this interplay is the
staggering rate of gendered violence associated with man camps,
temporary accommodation complexes housing predominantly male workers
employed in the fossil fuel industry.]{.underline} By turning the hard
work of planet-wrecking into an expression of sexualized power, [[fossil
capital continues to produce forms of masculinity]{.mark}
t]{.underline}hat are quite literally toxic.Footnote62 This logic
extends into the sphere of consumption, where many environmentally
damaging behaviours such as driving, or meat consumption are marketed in
heavily gendered ways. Unsurprisingly, (white) men are more likely to be
climate change deniers than women.Footnote63 On the other hand,
capitalism's specific gendered division of labour also accounts for the
fact that the impacts of the climate crisis are disproportionately felt
by women and non-binary persons, who are more vulnerable to the direct
effects of famine, drought, and natural disasters. Therefore, [the
feminist movement, too, shares an important strategic dilemma with the
climate strike movement:]{.underline} How to [tackle a system of fossil
patriarchy that relies on patriarchal violence to foster accumulation,
while systematically de-valuing the work and in particular the
reproductive labour performed by women and non-binary
persons.]{.underline} School strikes A long history of the climate
strike would certainly be incomplete without reference to the legacy of
[[the school strike]{.underline}]{.mark} itself. The school strike is a
protest form as old as the school as a modern institution: reports of
students striking against flogging and corporal punishment hark back to
the 17th century. As Philip Ariès shows in Centuries of Childhood, these
early school strikes could reach a massive scale, including violent and
often armed school uprisings in which school buildings were damaged and
teachers attacked.Footnote64 With the onset of industrialization, school
strikes often took inspiration from the labour movement, such as in
England, where student strikes often coincided with industrial action.
In Germany, students established student councils along with the
workers' and soldiers' councils that were formed during the 1918
revolution.Footnote65 School strikers were also often at the forefront
of anti-colonial and anti-racist movements. In South Africa, for
example, the 1976 school strike in Soweto against the imposition of
Afrikaans as the language of instruction turned into an uprising and one
of the defining moments of the anti-Apartheid movement. In the United
States, students played a major role in the success of Memphis
Sanitation Strike of 1968, one of the first movements to explicitly link
racial justice and environmental concerns and widely considered a
constitutive moment of the environmental justice movement. The strike
was led by the overwhelmingly Black workforce of the Memphis Department
of Public Works; it had been sparked by the death of two of their
colleagues, and included demands for higher wages, better workplace
safety and the recognition of the sanitation workers' union. High school
and college students soon joined the daily workers' daily marches. A
march on March 28 saw tens of thousands of students skip school in a
mass act of civil disobedience.Footnote66 Larry Payne, a student
striker, was murdered by the police during the demonstration and became
a martyr of the movement. At first glance, the history of the school
strike may seem less obviously related to fossil capitalism than the
previously discussed strike traditions. However[[, students]{.mark} have
long been [at the forefront]{.mark} of social and [ecologic]{.mark}al
[struggles]{.mark} directly [aimed at capital]{.mark} -- a promising
history when considering the challenges faced by today's climate strike
movement.]{.underline} (In)conclusion: **[[the climate strike as horizon
for future climate justice organizing]{.underline}]{.mark}** If only
anecdotally, these examples illustrate how [[different strike
traditions,]{.mark} such as industrial action, anti-colonial and
anti-racist strikes, feminist strikes, and school strikes [share common
ground]{.mark} with the climate strike movement in their opposition to
fossil capitalism. A [maximally effective anti-capitalist climate
strike,]{.mark} it would seem, could **[combine]{.mark} aspects of [all
these different strike traditions,]{.mark}** [striking different spheres
of fossil capitalist accumulation in **a globally coordinated and
synchronized manner.**]{.mark}]{.underline} This is anything but a new
idea -- plans to extend and widen the climate strike frame have been
present in the movement-internal discourse since the first climate
strikes were held. As one Fridays for Future organizer from Stockholm
put it in the early phase of the movement: "It would be so great if
something like all of Stockholm went on strike. If we get the unions on
our side. If all the bank people don\'t go to work. Then there\'s a
problem."Footnote67 So far, attempts to win over unions and other
actors, such as during the September 2019 earth strike mobilization,
have largely proven unfruitful. Therefore, the climate strike remains in
many ways an unfinished project, a horizon, whose [present appearance
should not limit the scope of our imagination.]{.underline} One [source
of inspiration could be]{.underline} the appropriation of elements [from
other strike forms]{.underline}[:]{.mark} How would, for example, a
climate strike post for instance, look like? How about a climate union?
Or even a climate hartal? [A successful broadening of the climate strike
format might even require abandoning the term "climate strike" in favour
of a more open framing]{.underline} (some have suggested the term strike
for life in this context). In any case, **[[future actions]{.mark} could
[draw one of the greatest strengths of the existing climate
strike]{.mark} [movements]{.mark}, the ability to [organize]{.mark} and
coordinate its [actions globally]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [The
[movement]{.mark} and its [leadership]{.mark} have **[developed]{.mark}
and professionalized [significantly]{.mark}** since 2019, **[gathered
valuable organizing]{.mark}** **[experiences]{.mark}**, and [**forged
connections** with **other social movements**]{.mark}]{.underline}
during the pandemic. In Switzerland, climate strikers have already
collaborated with the women's strike and some of the country's labour
unions. In Singapore, they have organized in support of local delivery
riders, and in India, Fridays for Future has supported the largest
farmer's movement in history. Admittedly, winning over other social
movements to participate in a kind of climate general strike would
require an immense organizing effort and involve tedious negotiations
between different actors over framing, dates, and demands. In a
situation with real time constraints, and in which no other political
project has gotten close to radically [challenging the global hegemony
of extractive capitalism,]{.underline} let alone replacing it, **[[it
certainly would be worth a try.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

### Alt\-\--General Strike

#### A General Strike will upend the capitalist system

**Hoffman '11** \[Steve Hoffman, June 2011, a county labor council
delegate for Wash. Federation of State Employees Local 304 in Seattle,
\"The general strike in US history: What it is and why it\'s still
needed\", Freedom Socialist Party,
https://socialism.com/fs-article/the-general-strike-in-us-history-what-it-is-and-why-its-still-needed/\]

During a protest on the evening that Wisconsin's state senate passed its
notorious union-busting bill, many union members and their supporters
chanted ["general strike!" They were not just venting about assaults on
wages, benefits, and union rights. They were considering what it would
take to stop the attacks.]{.underline}

[Workers around the world --- in the U.S. as much as anywhere --- have
often found the [general strike]{.mark} to be [a powerful weapon for
improving their conditions or defending their
rights]{.mark}.]{.underline} Can those pages from history be today's
playbook for the toilers itching to fight back?

Labor history 101. A [[general strike]{.mark} encompasses workers from a
broad range of occupations and [shuts down]{.mark} the delivery of [all
private and public goods]{.mark} and services in an area]{.underline},
such as a city or state. They usually occur at a time of heightened
economic tension, when employers are demanding big concessions from
labor, or even trying to destroy unions. Sometimes [a defensive
[struggle of one union can spread]{.mark} as other unions --- as well as
non-union workers, students, and the broader community --- [join the
fray to express solidarity]{.mark} and broaden the demands of the
struggle to include their issues.]{.underline}

Many of these titanic battles have erupted on U.S. soil. The "Great
Upheaval" of 1877 started as a railroad strike against wage cuts that
spread from the east coast to the Midwest. Entire communities joined in,
challenging the power of banks, manufacturing corporations, and even
state and local governments. Federal troops pulled out of the South
after Reconstruction quelled this uprising. But the nationwide
wage-cutting craze was slowed considerably.

During the 1919 Seattle General Strike some 60,000 workers walked off
the job in support of striking shipyard workers. Organized by the
Central Labor Council, the strike brought city businesses to a
standstill. For five days workers' committees operated everything, from
mass strike kitchens to essential services such as hospital deliveries.
An [historic lesson was taught --- [the working class can run
society]{.mark}.]{.underline} And without the bosses!

In the depth of the Great Depression, in 1934, there were general
strikes in San Francisco, Minneapolis, and Toledo. [Industrial
[unionism]{.mark} was [proving its mettle]{.mark}, and unions used
audacious tactics, including sit-down strikes and roving pickets. When
bosses compelled local governments to launch crackdowns or even summon
the National Guard, many workers, both [employed and unemployed, came to
the defense of strikers]{.mark}.]{.underline} It was the ferocity and
tenacity of those fighters that pressured Congress to pass the National
Labor Relations Act in 1935, establishing the collective bargaining
rights that so many are trying to preserve today.

[Glimpses of a better world. The [strikes]{.mark} above [showed]{.mark}
working [people]{.mark} the [tremendous power they have]{.mark}, and
inspired them [to imagine a better world, where exploitation is not
inevitable]{.mark} and unending.]{.underline}

Unfortunately, these lessons are lost on many current labor officials.
In Wisconsin, leaders of large teachers and public employee unions have
reined in mass protest and put the kibosh on any talk of a general
strike, instead focusing all energy into electoral recall campaigns
intended to get more Democrats into office.

Embattled unionists and their community allies don't need another pile
of promises from politicians. So what can a general strike deliver?

For starters, [such [a strike can demand]{.mark} from the government
[real solutions to]{.mark} the economic [crisis]{.mark}. It can
[declare]{.mark}: "It is time to create jobs for all, insure the
survival of poor people, and provide quality public services like
healthcare, childcare and education. [It can be
done]{.mark}]{.underline} --- end the wars and tax the rich and
corporate profits NOW! And hands off our collective bargaining rights!"
[[When the working class doesn't show up for work]{.mark}, thereby
[bring]{.mark}ing [the economy and all profit making to a]{.mark}
screeching [halt]{.mark}, these reasonable demands more [easily
penetrate]{.mark} the [pro-corporate]{.mark} skulls of the
[politicians]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Also, [the [general strike]{.mark} can [unite]{.mark} all the
[toilers]{.mark}. Public and private sector unions, students and
workers, public employees and the people who need the services they
provide, the employed and the jobless --- [all]{.mark} can [come
together]{.mark} and [build solidarity that]{.mark} will [last long
after]{.mark} the big [strike]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### There is popular support for a General Strike

**Brecher '25** \[Jeremy Brecher, 4-8-2025, Jeremy Brecher is a
historian and author of books on labor and social movements, \"What
would a general strike in the US actually look like?\", Waging
Nonviolence,
https://wagingnonviolence.org/2025/04/what-would-general-strike-in-the-us-look-like/\]

Something is in the air: [A perception that [American democracy]{.mark}
and livable conditions for working people may [only be saved by]{.mark}
the kind of [large-scale nonviolent]{.mark} direct [action]{.mark}
variously [called "general strikes,]{.mark}]{.underline}" "political
strikes," or, as I will refer to all of them, "social strikes."

Calls for mass disruptive action are coming from unlikely places, like
[Anthony Romero, executive director of the ACLU, an organization
normally associated with legal action through the courts. When
[Romero]{.mark} was asked in a recent interview what would happen if the
Trump administration systematically defied court orders, he
[replied]{.mark}, "Then [we've got to take to the streets]{.mark} in a
different way. [We've got to shut down this
country]{.mark}."]{.underline}

[Similarly senior Democratic [Rep. Jim McGovern said]{.mark}, "[We
can't]{.mark} just sit back and [let our democracy]{.mark} just [fall
apart]{.mark}. What [we need]{.mark} to think about are things like
maybe [a national strike across this country]{.mark}."]{.underline}

Some in organized labor are also entering the fray. Sara Nelson, head of
the Association of Flight Attendants, recently said that American
workers --- [no matter what they do or what sector they are in --- now
have "very [few options but to join together]{.mark} to organize [for a
general strike]{.mark}." (She led the organizing for a national general
strike that successfully deterred Trump's attempt to shut down the
government in his first term.)]{.underline}

Meanwhile, online, there are even more ad hoc efforts demonstrating the
tactic's appeal right now. For instance, [[more than 300,000
people]{.mark} have [signed]{.mark} cards pledging [to participate in a
general strike]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Calling for general strikes is a staple of the radical toolkit. (I've
made questionable efforts to call two or three myself over the past
half-century.) But [[why has the idea of]{.mark} such [mass
actions]{.mark} suddenly [appeared]{.mark} on the lips of such a wide
range of people[?]{.mark} There are three principal
reasons:]{.underline}

[[1.]{.mark} The wide range of [people being harmed by]{.mark} the
[MAGA]{.mark} juggernaut gives credibility to actions based on wide
public participation.]{.underline}

[[2.]{.mark} The [demolition of]{.mark} key [institutions of
democracy]{.mark}, constitutionalism and the rule of law is threatening
to [leave few alternatives to]{.mark} popular
[uprising]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[3.]{.mark} The fecklessness of the leadership of the Democratic Party,
as sublimely illustrated by Sen. Chuck Schumer's [passage]{.mark} in
March [of]{.mark} the devastating [MAGA budget]{.mark}, has [led to
despair about resistance]{.mark} within the institutions of
government.]{.underline}

These inescapable realities are forcing people to think in unaccustomed
ways.

I use the term [["social strikes"]{.mark} to [describe]{.mark} mass
actions people take to exercise power by [withdraw]{.mark}ing
[cooperation]{.mark} from and [disrupting]{.mark} the [operation of
society]{.mark}. The goal of a [social strike]{.mark} is to
[affect]{.mark} not just the immediate employer, but a [political
regime]{.mark} or social structure.]{.underline} Such forms of mass
direct action provide a possible alternative when institutional means of
action prove ineffective. [In all their varied forms they are based on
Gandhi's fundamental perception that "[even the most powerful cannot
rule without the cooperation of the ruled]{.mark}."]{.underline}

### AT: Transition Wars

#### No violence - Peaceful transition to degrowth 

**Nicoson 21'** \[Nicoson, C., Postdoctoral Researcher at Sutherland

climate resilient peace: an intersectional and degrowth
approach. Sustain Sci 16, 1147--1158 (2021).
<https://doi.org/10.1007/s11625-021-00906-1>\] pjang

How [can peace be climate resilient?]{.underline} How [[can peace and
environmental sustainability be advanced
simultaneously]{.underline}]{.mark}? To address these questions, [I
develop a new conceptual and theoretical framework for climate resilient
peace [through degrowth]{.mark}. This paper calls for stronger
consideration of **[positive conceptualizations of peace and of
intersectionality and degrowth in pursuit of peace and
resilience]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Not only does climate change make
planetary limitations more salient, but it also highlights rising
inequalities. [In light of this, [peace necessitates
transforming]{.mark} societal [power structure]{.mark}s that are both
[driving climate]{.mark} change [and influencing]{.mark} people's
[experience]{.mark}s of climate impacts]{.underline}. Addressing
imbalanced power structures then is key to understanding and fostering
climate resilient peace. This paper conceptualizes climate resilient
peace based on an intersectional understanding of positive peace,
highlighting that peace depends on the negation of structural violence
experienced at the intersection of political and social identities. In
relation to this, I argue that [a process of climate resilient peace
must address underlying power structures influencing people's experience
of climate harms, and driving climate change so as to mitigate further
damage]{.underline}. [This paper demonstrates such **[a process through
degrowth, wherein growth is no longer the central economic goal,
exemplifying]{.mark} social and ecological [means for disrupting]{.mark}
structural [violence]{.mark} within climate limitations**]{.underline}.
I discuss and give examples of three key [degrowth
processes---[redistribution, reprioritized care economies, and global
equity---as opportunities to foster peace in a changing
climate]{.mark}.]{.underline} This framework, thus, contributes a new
approach to climate resilient peace that addresses challenges of both
social and environmental sustainability.

#### No transition wars\-\--the alt is a recentering of communal ideals

**Polleit '23** \[Thorsten Polleit., 2-16-2023, Professor of Economics
at the University of Bayreuth and President of the Ludwig von Mises
Institut Deutschland, \"10. A Destructive Ideology: Democratic
Socialism\", Mises Institute,
https://mises.org/online-book/global-currency-plot/10-destructive-ideology-democratic-socialism\]

[Once the democratic [socialists]{.mark} have [found support for]{.mark}
their [demands]{.mark}, the way ahead is virtually preprogrammed. If one
has regarded partial expropriation as correct and good, then no
principled reason can be raised any more against ever further tax
increases.]{.underline} If an initial income tax of, say, 20 percent is
levied, then over time it will become 25, 30, 35, 40 percent, or more.
These small [[steps lead]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the [progressive
expropriation]{.mark} of income earners and to an ever-[greater
redistribution of income]{.mark} and wealth based on political
considerations, which increases the power of the state and the groups it
favors. Private [property]{.mark} then [exists only formally]{.mark},
but [no longer in economic terms]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus, from the
point of view of democratic socialism, property is property by grace of
the state; it is fiat property.

Democratic socialism finds its intellectual basis in cultural Marxism
(or neo-Marxism). It has grown out of the Marxist-Leninist insight that
the hoped-for revolution does not emanate from the working masses, but
that instead the basis for the transformation of society must be created
by the intellectuals. [The [goal]{.mark} is [not sudden violent
overthrow, but a]{.mark} creeping [peaceful upheaval]{.mark}---through
the [change of values, culture, and beliefs]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the
[people]{.mark}. In this way, the [masses, denuded of meaning]{.mark}
and disoriented, are [ultimately]{.mark} to effectively [fall
into]{.mark} the clutches of [communism]{.mark}.]{.underline}

After decades of persistent preparatory work (the "march through the
institutions"), [cultural [Marxist]{.mark} [intellectuals]{.mark} today
[occupy]{.mark} many [key positions in politics]{.mark}, administration,
art, and culture.]{.underline} They can be found especially in schools
and universities, popularizing their ideas, which are veiled in the garb
of democratic socialism. New group conflicts are constantly being
stirred up and talked up---whether it is a question of gender or
nationality---which unsettle people and deliberately confuse them, until
emotions reach psychotic proportions.

Political globalism relies on democratic socialism. Its aim is to direct
and determine in an authoritarian way all relations between people from
different continents. According to them, [it is [not]{.mark} the [free
market]{.mark}, the division of labor, and free trade [that]{.mark}
should [determine what is produced]{.mark} and consumed when and where,
but [rather]{.mark} these [decisions should be influenced]{.mark} or
made [by]{.mark} an [ideological]{.mark} and political creative [will.
Political globalism receives support]{.mark} not only [from]{.mark} the
[political left]{.mark}.]{.underline} Large companies in particular are
expressing their support---because they hope to be able to influence the
political process in their favor.65

Democratic socialism has---and this can be shown with the a priori
theory of action---negative consequences for the material prosperity and
morality of society. Here are a few examples. Taxing company profits
reduces the return on investment: it is lower compared to a situation in
which entrepreneurs are not taxed. This makes investing less attractive.
The capital stock is growing less strongly than it actually could, and
consequently future real wage increases will be lower than they would
otherwise be.

[The incentive to work, to engage in productive activity, decreases
because the cost of not working decreases. Under [democratic
socialism]{.mark}, one can [ultimately]{.mark} earn ([transfer]{.mark})
[income]{.mark} [without having]{.mark} to [offer]{.mark} a [marketable
service]{.mark}.]{.underline} All you have to do is elect a government
to power that will give you the desired benefits. The bill has to be
paid by the taxpayers, the productive people---who then have a reduced
incentive to be productive. The material prosperity of the economy as a
whole will therefore be lower compared to a situation where there is no
taxation.

### AT: Cap inevitabe

#### Capitalism isn't inevitable\-\--it's not human nature

**Oduor '21** \[John-Baptiste Oduor, 6-10-2021, Editor and critic of the
Jacobin magazine, \"Capitalism Is Not Natural : Indybay\", Indybay,
https://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2025/04/10/18875324.php?\]

[[Right-wingers defend capitalism as]{.mark} a system [necessitated by
human nature, but]{.mark} the [market emerged out of specific historic
conditions]{.mark} [-- it isn't hardwired into our
species]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Adam Smith, the great theorist of early capitalism, remarked in The
Wealth of Nations that

[Nobody ever saw a dog make a fair and deliberate exchange of one bone
for another with another dog. Nobody ever saw one animal by its gestures
and natural cries signify to another, this is mine, that yours; I am
willing to give this for that.]{.underline}

The implication here is, of course, that what Smith famously referred to
as 'truck, barter and exchange' are traits unique to humans. [[Private
property]{.mark} and, [with it, exchange and sale of this
property]{.mark}, are [features]{.mark} as [natural to human
beings]{.mark} as walking or talking[. If these traits are unique to
humans]{.mark}, then, the argument goes[, capitalism is itself merely a
generalization of these characteristics]{.mark} on the level of society
as a whole, and therefore capitalist society is the one in which human
nature is finally given free rein.]{.underline}

[For critics of capitalism[, this kind of jump]{.mark} --- [from]{.mark}
a vaguely plausible [generalization about human]{.mark} [nature to an
assertion about]{.mark} the [necessity of a whole system]{.mark} of
social relations --- has always [seemed a bit too
quick]{.mark}.]{.underline} It might be one thing to grant that people
sometimes act and think according to market principles, but it is
another claim altogether to say that people have always structured their
society around this logic.

[What distinguishes capitalism from mere market activity is, as the late
[Marxist political theorist]{.mark} Ellen Meiksins Wood
[observed]{.mark}, that [capitalist society]{.mark} is a society in
[which social relations are 'embedded in the economy']{.mark} rather
than the 'economy being embedded in social relations.']{.underline} What
she meant by this is that we cannot account for the complexity of the
capitalist mode of production merely out of a set of potential human
motives and desires. [[What is distinctive]{.mark} about capitalism
[is]{.mark} [not simply]{.mark} that [the human tendency]{.mark} to
'truck, barter and exchange' reigns supreme, but that [people are
compelled to govern their]{.mark} whole [lives in]{.mark} a
transactional and [commodifying way]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is not a
matter of mere choice but of compulsion.

### AT: R/C/Cap Bad

#### Only modern capitalism is corrupt, reverting to desirable roots of capitalism key to solve myriad of global issues\-\--climate change, poverty, etc.

**Park '19** \[Donghyun Park; April 2019 (04/2019); Principal Economist

PhD in Economics from UCLA; Asian Development Review; Why Global
Capitalism Is Broken and How It Can Be Fixed;

[[Capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark} is, no doubt[, **[far from
perfect]{.mark}**]{.underline} and must bear some blame for global
problems. But our [central argument]{.underline} is that it is [not
capitalism]{.underline} per se [but the [**grotesquely deformed**
capitalism]{.mark} of the [21st century]{.mark} that is
**[failing]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [More specifically,
[capitalism]{.mark} has been **[hijacked by]{.mark}** the **[financial
industry]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which is [no longer the valuable tool
of capitalism that channels capital to entrepreneurs and
companies]{.underline}. Instead it has become a **[[self-serving
leviathan]{.underline}]{.mark}** whose **[[blind pursuit of
profit]{.underline}]{.mark}** [almost **[wrecked]{.mark}** the world
[**economy** in 2008]{.mark}]{.underline}. Critically, that greed-crazed
frenzy, more frightening than a school of Amazon River piranhas
devouring a fish to its bare bones within seconds, was made [possible by
[cozy ties between]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[financial industry]{.mark}
and the [government]{.mark}]{.underline}, whose [[implicit
guarantees]{.mark} [encourage banks]{.mark}]{.underline} to
[[take]{.mark} undue]{.underline} [[risk]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[safe
in]{.mark} the [knowledge]{.mark} that [tax payers will bail
them]{.mark} out]{.underline} if things went wrong. [Instead of
serving]{.underline} [entrepreneurs and firms]{.underline}, many of [the
[financial industry]{.mark}'s so-called [innovations **fatten**]{.mark}
its **[own pockets]{.mark}**,]{.underline} but [[**add little value**
to]{.mark} the [economy]{.mark}]{.underline} and [[**jeopardize**
financial **stability**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [[US]{.mark} subprime
[mortgage crisis of 2008]{.mark}]{.underline}, which [[morphed
into]{.mark} the [Global Financial Crisis]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[underlined]{.mark} the [industry's]{.mark} unlimited [potential for
damage]{.mark}]{.underline}.

But the good news is that there is still [[**plenty of hope** for
capitalism]{.mark} to [return to]{.mark} its
[roots]{.mark}]{.underline}. Capitalism's [[current woes do not begin
and end with the financial industry]{.underline}]{.mark}. In fact,
[**[reforming]{.mark}** the [financial **industry**]{.mark}]{.underline}
is a [[good]{.mark} place]{.underline} to [[start reforming
capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [[twisted 21st- century
capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark} of the financial industry
[[dominating]{.underline}]{.mark} the [real
[economy]{.mark}]{.underline} [[must give way to]{.mark} the
[original]{.mark}, benign, socially desirable [capitalism]{.mark} of the
financial industry [serving]{.mark} the real
[economy]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Good capitalism]{.mark} is [vibrant
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline} in which greed and the [[profit motive
**encourage innovative**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[risk-taking]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[profit-seeking]{.mark}
[entrepreneurs]{.mark} to [create new]{.mark} and [better
products]{.mark}]{.underline}, to [invest in new and better
technologies]{.underline}, and to [[hire more
workers]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[devote]{.underline}]{.mark} in their
[[training]{.mark} and re-training]{.underline}. Therefore,
[[reinstating]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[weakened links
between]{.underline}]{.mark} the financial industry and the real economy
is vital to restoring the health of capitalism. A [[healthy
capitalism]{.mark}, in turn, is **[crucial to tackling]{.mark}**
humanity's **[greatest contemporary challenges]{.mark}**]{.underline},
like [[environmental destruction]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[youth
unemployment]{.underline}]{.mark} and [[chronic
poverty]{.underline}]{.mark}. At a deeper level, the [[root
cause]{.mark} of capitalism's current slump]{.underline} is [[stifling
government regulation]{.underline}]{.mark} and
[[interference]{.underline}]{.mark} that [stands [in]{.mark} the [way of
private enterprise and entrepreneurship]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Revamping]{.underline}]{.mark} the [financial industry]{.underline} so
that it serves the real economy rather than itself is, for sure, [a
[**major priority** for **fixing**]{.mark}
**[capitalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. But the [bigger]{.underline}
[priority]{.underline} is to [get government and government bureaucrats
off the back of private business]{.underline} so that
[entrepreneurs]{.underline} can [take risks]{.underline} and go about
doing what they do best --- creating useful new products and
technologies, jobs, and wealth. Paradoxically, the government was asleep
at the wheels when it came to regulating the financial industry, which
needs to be tightly regulated, while it was [overregulating]{.underline}
the [real economy]{.underline} and the [risk-taking
entrepreneur]{.underline}s [who create wealth and jobs]{.underline}. In
other words, [governments]{.underline} were giving a [free pass to the
likes of hedge funds]{.underline}, which crea[te little social
value]{.underline}, while **[handcuffing]{.underline}** the likes of
Steve Jobs, who generate plenty of **[social value]{.underline}**.

In truth, capitalism is not even remotely in any slump. [[What passes
for capitalism today]{.underline}]{.mark}, the same capitalism that is
[[widely and **unfairly criticized**]{.mark} as the [root cause]{.mark}
of all]{.underline} of mankind's problems, is [not]{.underline}
[capitalism at all]{.underline}. Today's capitalism is [so [**far
removed** from]{.mark} the [benign original]{.mark} vision]{.underline}
of Adam Smith --- [individual greed [promoting]{.mark} the [social
good]{.mark} and [driving human progress]{.mark}]{.underline} --- that
he would barely recognize it if he came back to life. The [visible,
meddling, and corrupt hand of the government]{.underline} has [pushed
aside the invisible, entrepreneurial, and wealth-creating]{.underline}
hand of the [market]{.underline}. Across vast swathes of the world, the
[only]{.underline} growth industry is the government industry. [But
notwithstanding]{.underline} the [wishful self-delusion of politicians
and bureaucrats]{.underline}, the [[government]{.mark} industry [does
not create useful]{.mark}]{.underline} [new]{.underline} products and
[[tech]{.underline}]{.mark}nologies, and it most certainly [does not
create wealth and jobs.]{.underline} Far worse, [[government
interference suffocates wealth]{.underline}]{.mark}- and job-creating
entrepreneurship and brings economic progress to a rude stop.

The [[runaway growth]{.mark} of the government industry]{.underline},
which **[[squeezes]{.underline}]{.mark}** the very [[**life out**
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[private sector]{.underline}]{.mark}, is
indeed cause for [[deep concern]{.mark} and [alarm
about]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[future prospects of
capitalism]{.underline} [and mankind]{.underline}]{.mark}. No country
ever got rich by expanding the government, and no country ever will.
Conversely, [[no country ever got rich by suffocating its private
sector]{.underline}]{.mark}. Moreover, the [[world]{.underline}]{.mark}
will [[not solve]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[myriad urgent
challenges]{.underline}]{.mark} --- from [climate change]{.underline}
and [environmental destruction]{.underline} which threaten us and our
children and grandchildren, to the [inhumane poverty]{.underline} which
[[still enslaves]{.underline}]{.mark} far too many of our
[[fellow]{.underline} [global citizens]{.underline}]{.mark}, to the
[bleak employment prospects]{.underline} of millions of youths
[in]{.underline} both [rich and poor]{.underline}
[countries]{.underline} --- by [adding]{.underline} yet [more foot
soldiers]{.underline} to its already-bulging army of government
bureaucrats. [[Tackling global problems
**requires**]{.underline}]{.mark} less, not more, government, and what
the world needs is **[[more]{.underline}]{.mark}**, not less,
[[capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Capitalism]{.underline} is not part
of the problem, but a **[[central part of the
solution]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The New Method of Controlling Disorder This should not be a surprise:
they had a similar interest during the first liberal age as well. But
this is also evidence of the triumph of pragmatism over principle. After
all, [a critical aim of the neoliberal program was reducing the bloated
public sector]{.underline}. "Spending is out of control," complained
David Osborne, a prominent advocate of leaner government, in 1993. "The
public is frustrated, angry, disgusted, and ready for change. . . . We
are in for a decade of excruciating pain at state and local levels." 149
However, American police forces did not feel this pain. The Department
of Justice estimates that public expenditure on policing by all levels
of American government more than tripled, even after adjustment for
inflation, between 1982 and 2009. A 2002 Justice Department study found
that the number of police officers employed in major American cities
increased by 17 percent between 1990 and 2000. In New York City alone,
the uniformed force increased from thirty-one thousand to forty thousand
officers in that decade. 150 New York Michael Bloomberg later boasted
that he had "my own private army in the NYPD, which is the
seventh-biggest army in the world." New York City's preoccupation with
policing was partly a byproduct of free-market policies. As barriers to
trade collapsed, manufacturers fl ed the city for lower-cost
jurisdictions. The city lost three-quarters of a million jobs in
manufacturing between 1966 and 2009. (Many other cities had the same
experience.) As the sociologist Alex Vitale has noted, the loss of so
many factory jobs lead to problems of poverty and urban decay that the
city government, confronting a decline in tax revenues, could not
address. 152 The result was an increase in homelessness and petty crime.
The city's economic recovery depended on the expansion of tourism,
finance, and other services. This meant closer attention 70 The End of
Protest to the city's "urban brand"---the image that it projected to the
world that made it attractive to tourists and professionals. "If a city
is perceived as violent and unsafe," one specialist on urban branding
explained, "obviously the city must combat crime and violence. . . .
Solving the problem of crime improves a city's image." 153 So New York
City's police force expanded even as other municipal services were cut
back. At the same time, the police force adopted a strict policy of
making arrests for minor offenses that contributed to the perception of
disorder. This was "a new philosophy of urban social control," wrote
Vitale, "that emphasized [the centrality of [maintaining order through
aggressive]{.mark} [zero tolerance policing]{.mark}]{.underline}." 154
[The [neoliberal]{.mark} era also saw a **[sharp rise in contributions
from the U.S]{.mark}. federal government [toward]{.mark} the cost of
[police services]{.mark}.**]{.underline} This happened despite the
larger drive for reduction of federal spending. In 1996, President Bill
Clinton famously announced that "the era of big government is over." But
Clinton also signed laws to pay for the addition of 150,000 police to
American streets. In 2000 the Clinton White House claimed that it had
increased funding for state and local law enforcement by 300 percent
since 1993. Later, the federal government also began to routinely
provide additional funding to cities hosting "national special security
events"---such as the summit on free trade in the Americas held in Miami
in 2003 and the economic summits that were scheduled for Washington in
2008, Pittsburgh in 2009, and Chicago in 2012. The money was used to
defray the cost of bolstering police numbers, and also to improve
capabilities that remained long after the event itself. The cities of
Tampa and Charlotte received \$100 million from the federal government
to support policing for the 2012 Republican and Democratic conventions,
both designated as special security events. Much of that money was spent
on facilities and equipment, including communications and surveillance
gear, a new command center for the Charlotte police force, and for the
Tampa Police Department, an armored vehicle custom-built for urban
operations. Spending on police services in Britain increased throughout
the neoliberal age as well. The Thatcher government was ruthless in
reorganizing many parts of the British public sector, but not the
police, whose [services were recognized to be **essential to contain
labor unrest and inner-city rioting**. The [police]{.mark},
says]{.underline} P.A.J. [Waddington, "were [in the front line of a
social revolution]{.mark}."]{.underline} 155 After the unrest of the
early 1980s, the Thatcher government made a public commitment to
increase police numbers and pay. Between 1988 and 1998, expenditure on
British policing increased by 33 percent, even after adjustment for infl
ation. 156 The advent of a Labour government in 1997 did not reverse
this trend. On the contrary, the government of Prime Minister Tony Blair
tried to prove its toughness on law and order by launching another
"decade of record investment in policing." The growth in expenditure
happened, a recent study concludes, "because there was a political
consensus . . . instead of any systemic profi ling of need or impact
analysis." By 2011 it could be safely concluded that British police have
"never been better resourced . . . \[with\] more offi cers than ever
before." 157 Not only were there more police offi cers in Britain and
the United States: they were better equipped for crowd control than ever
before. Protesters who confronted police in the United States around
1970 usually saw offi cers who were dressed for normal duty, except with
the addition of a light helmet. By the early 2000s, the standard outfi t
for crowd control had changed dramatically. It was not unusual for
police at major protests to wear Kevlar helmets, full visors, chest
protectors, hard shell shin guards, and heavy boots. Many carried
truncheons and polycarbonate shields, and a supply of nylon disposable
handcuffs to restrain protesters quickly. Today we know what to call
this equipment: riot gear. That phrase was unknown in the United States
and Britain before the 1970s. It became a commonly used term in Britain
the early years of the Thatcher government and more familiar in the
United States throughout the 1990s and 2000s. Police forces also
acquired "nonlethal" technologies to intimidate and disperse crowds.
British police fi rst launched CS gas canisters against rioters in 1981.
CS gas proved less dangerous than other kinds of tear gas or vomiting
gas and quickly became a familiar element of public order policing
around the world. Pyrotechnic grenades were used to confuse crowds with
a loud bang and dazzling light. In more extreme circumstances, police fi
red plastic bullets or bean-bag rounds to incapacitate dangerous
elements of a mob. At the G20 summit in Pittsburgh in 2009, police
experimented with sonic cannons, which disabled protesters with focused
bursts of pain-inducing sound. The arsenals of [major [police
forces]{.mark} in the United States]{.underline} and United Kingdom
became so well-stocked in the neoliberal age that some critics
complained the police were [being **[transformed into paramilitary
services]{.mark}. Police forces also [followed the military
model]{.mark} as they improved their [capacity]{.mark} [to maintain
centralized command over]{.mark} personnel who were deployed to contain
[large]{.mark} [crowds]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Written procedures for
handling crowds became more detailed, special training was increased,
and communications systems were upgraded. At the same time, police
forces developed better procedures for obtaining help from neighboring
municipalities when they were at risk of being overwhelmed. The British
government established a National Reporting Center to improve the
coordination of responses to severe unrest in 1984. In the United
States, the federal government's role in orchestrating security for
major events was formalized in a 1997 directive issued by the Clinton
administration, and then by federal law in 2000. We can see that the
neoliberal age, like the fi rst liberal age, produced substantial
changes in policing capacity in both the United Kingdom and the United
States. Police forces were bigger and better equipped, and more
sophisticated about the use of force. A more coherent doctrine of
"public order policing" emerged. (That phrase gained currency after the
1980s.) As in the fi rst liberal age, a central theme within this
doctrine was the control of territory for the purpose of preventing
disruption. 158 One common tactic was relocating contentious events to
remote locations. After the debacle in Seattle in 1999, the WTO held its
next meeting in Qatar, a small authoritarian state in the Persian Gulf.
In 2004, the United States chose to host the G8 summit on a privately
owned island on the coast of Georgia. In 2010, Canada held the meeting
of G7 fi nance ministers in a distant Arctic settlement. The 2012 G8
summit was originally planned for Chicago but later moved to the
presidential retreat at Camp David, Maryland. If meetings could not be
moved to remote locations, a second best solution was to create a de
facto island within a city itself. Authorities in Quebec City prepared
for a 2001 summit on free trade by surrounding the city center with a
security fence that was more than two miles long. Italian officials used
a similar barrier to isolate Genoa's center during the G8 meeting later
in 2001. For the 2007 G8 summit, the German government surrounded the
seaside resort of Heiligendamm with seven miles of fencing, eight feet
tall and topped with barbed wire. For the 2009 G20 summit, Pittsburgh's
central business district was also enclosed by metal fences---and by
some estimates, guarded by more police than there were protesters. As in
the first liberal age, the control of public space was made easier by
changes in law. In 1986, the British government adopted a new Public
Order Act that expanded police authority to impose restrictions on
gatherings and marches if they seemed likely to cause serious
disruption. In the United States, meanwhile**[, city governments
[used]{.mark} their existing [authority to regulate the time, place, and
manner of protests more aggressively]{.mark}.]{.underline}** For
example, the city of Miami anticipated a 2003 free trade summit by
tightening its municipal ordinance on marches and gatherings to prevent
a repeat of Seattle's troubles. Similarly, the city of Chicago prepared
for the 2012 NATO and G8 meetings by making municipal regulations on
protests more restrictive and increasing penalties for violations.
American cities often attempted [to [confine]{.mark} protests [to
"demonstration zones"]{.mark} that were isolated and easily
policed.]{.underline} A federal judge described the demonstration zone
that was created for the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston:
The overall impression created by the DZ \[Demonstration Zone\] is that
of an internment camp. . . . The city has chosen . . . a place that was
recently a construction site, not just on the wrong side of the tracks
but literally under them. Between the overhead tracks, which provide
very low clearance in many parts, and the multiple layers of fencing,
mesh and netting, the DZ conveys the symbolic sense of a holding pen
where potentially dangerous persons are separated from others. 159
[Police forces [invented]{.mark} other techniques for containing
protests. One of the most controversial methods, known as
[kettling]{.mark}, involved the use of concentrated police power to
corral protesters into a secure area, where they could be held for hours
and then gradually released in small numbers. T]{.underline}he technique
was devised in Germany in the late 1980s and imported into Britain and
the The New Method of Controlling Disorder 75 United States in the
mid-1990s. A police offi cial in New York City told the criminologist
Luis Fernandez how the technique was applied during protests at the
World Economic Forum in 2002: [We had a [system]{.mark} [of barricaded
streets that]{.mark} we [built]{.mark}. This is a system where we [put
people in pens]{.mark}, metal barricades. We make these large boxed-in
areas where we know people are going to end up. We design breaks so that
not everyone is in the same place . . **. [We do this systematic enough
that we can control the crowd]{.mark}.**]{.underline} We build one, fi
ll it with people, section it off, and then we build another, and so on,
until the entire crowd is contained in neat boxes. 160 Kettling was used
during at the G20 summit in London in 2009. Four thousand protesters
were held for seven hours in an attempt to prevent "disruption and
disorder" from spreading throughout the city's financial district. 161
The containment continued until major financial institutions had closed
for the day. "The police managed the crowd by keeping them penned in
like sheep," one demonstrator complained. 162 Police forces also
intensified surveillance of protest activities. In 1999, the British
government established a national police unit to gather intelligence on
protests that threatened violence and disruption. After the 2003 free
trade summit, Miami Police described how they had monitored protesters:
Confidential surveillance grids were devised to keep tabs on developing
threats during demonstrations and marches. The intelligence component
established a confi dential number of permanent fixed grids around the
downtown area. . . . Officers in undercover roles were assigned to the
grids. . . . The function of each grid offi cer was to monitor the area
for any radical group activities and to fi le an immediate report to the
Operations Center by phone or radio while still maintaining their
undercover role. 163 **[[Surveillance]{.mark} was made easier by the
[increased use of]{.mark}]{.underline}** closed-circuit television
**[([CCTV) to monitor public spaces]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In 2011 it
was estimated that there were almost 2 million CCTV cameras watching
public spaces in Britain, and perhaps 30 million in the United States.
After the 2011 London riots, police gathered so much footage from CCTV
cameras that it would have taken one individual more than seventeen
years to watch it all. The processing of CCTV footage was simplified by
computerized [facial recognition technologies]{.underline}---but these
technologies only worked if faces were visible to surveillance cameras.
After the 2011 riots, the British government quickly proposed a new law
to [[limit the wearing of masks by protesters]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Pittsburgh's mayor also proposed an antimask ordinance during
preparations for the 2009 G20 summit. New York City police revived a
nineteenth-century antimask law during the Occupy protests in 2011. Many
of these changes in police capacities and tactics were a direct response
to changes in the character of unrest in the neoliberal age. **[As major
[unions]{.mark} [declined]{.mark} in influence, so too did
[forms]{.mark} of [mass protest]{.mark} that had a certain kind of
internal structure and self-discipline]{.underline}**. New kinds of
unrest---such the nonhierarchical, network-based forms of protest that
were celebrated after Seattle---came to the foreground. As the
sociologist P.A.J. Waddington suggested, these were more fluid forms of
disruption in which a **[mass of [people lacked clear leadership]{.mark}
and either the capacity or will to impose order on
itself]{.underline}**. Police forces compensated for this change by
developing new techniques that imposed discipline on the crowd. 164
Politicians and security officials justified the ratcheting up of
discipline by [[remind]{.mark}ing the [public of the danger of the
uncontrolled crowd]{.mark}]{.underline}. That is to say, they refi ned
the language of crowd control, just as they had in the first liberal
age. The specter of Seattle was raised over every subsequent economic
summit, and major media, attracted by stories of potential conflict,
helped to stoke public anxieties. A civilian panel appointed to
investigate the handling of protests at the free trade summit in Miami
in 2003 observed: For several months preceding the \[summit\], the local
media devoted considerable coverage to violent protests and wanton
vandalism that had taken place in other locations where international
economic conferences were held. . . . Repeated television images of
violent protests at such events contributed to an apprehension that
similar chaos and violence would befall the City of Miami. 165
Increasingly, protesters complained that they were routinely treated by
police as potential adversaries. An independent report on the G20 summit
in Toronto in 2010 observed that "[police were seen \[by protesters\] to
be treating all demonstrators [as threats to public safety]{.mark}. For
the most part, this was accurate. . . . \[One senior police offi cer\]
continually [referred to crowds as
'protesters/terrorists]{.mark}]{.underline}.'" 166 An important effect
of new policing tactics, another study concluded, was to [[convey the
messages that protests are "a matter of violence, aggression, and
imminent general danger.]{.underline}"]{.mark}

the consequences of all the recent punish the rich rhetoric on the

progressive:

In fact, the top half of income earners currently pay 97% of all federal
income taxes. Indeed, the ever-reviled "1%" pay 37% of all income taxes,
despite earning just under 20% of national income. That's almost twice
their share.
