Secretary of the Air Force Troy Meink, who holds a doctorate in
aeronautical and astronautical engineering, Air Force Chief of Staff
Gen. David Allvin, and Space Force Chief of Space Operations Gen. B.
Chance Saltzman highlighted the critical need for investments to address
current challenges and future threats, especially from strategic
competitors like China.

\"The Department of the Air Force is at an inflection point,\" Meink
said. \"We are engaging in a fast-paced race for technological
superiority against a well-resourced, strategic opponent.\"

[Speaking about the increased pace of modernization, Allvin stressed the
urgency of ensuring airpower dominance.]{.underline}

\"We now operate in a world where the \[People\'s Republic of China\] is
not only rapidly modernizing its military, but doing so with a clear
intent to coerce its neighbors and reshape the international order,\"
Allvin said. \"The United States must maintain airpower dominance if we
are to safeguard our security, deter aggression, and prevail in
conflict.\"

[Key modernization initiatives highlighted during the testimony included
the development of the F-47 Next Generation Air Dominance fighter jet
platform, the Collaborative Combat Aircraft, and crucial upgrades to
existing platforms like the F-35 Lightning II and F-15 Eagle
fighters.]{.underline}

Allvin detailed the innovative acquisition strategy for the F-47,
designed to avoid costly delays experienced with previous platforms.

\"We now have more control over the project,\" he said. \"[Upgrades can
come at the speed of software, not hardware, allowing us to rapidly
integrate advanced systems,]{.underline} benefiting both taxpayers and
warfighters.\"

On the topic of nuclear modernization, Meink and Allvin emphasized the
[priority of the Sentinel intercontinental ballistic missile system, the
B-21 Raider long-range strike bomber and revitalization of the B-52
Stratofortress fleet, essential to strategic deterrence.]{.underline}

When asked about the Sentinel program\'s timeline and budget stability,
Meink explained the Air Force would \"balance ... requirements to
generate readiness today with the imperative to rebuild our military
capabilities to continue deterring adversaries tomorrow.\"

Saltzman spoke about the significant growth and increasing importance of
the Space Force, underscoring its role in America\'s broader strategic
defense posture.

\"Space has become the backbone of our national security, and today\'s
joint force relies on the assumption that space power will be available
when needed,\" he said.

Addressing new mission responsibilities, including critical space-based
elements of the Golden Dome missile defense initiative, Saltzman warned
of the increasing gap between resources and mission demands.

\"Despite dramatic rises in threats and increasing importance, the Space
Force has experienced shrinking resources,\" he said. \"This disconnect
creates risk for our nation.\"

The Air Force also faces significant readiness challenges, particularly
with maintaining aging aircraft fleets. Allvin noted mission capability
rates, with older aircraft like the F-16 Fighting Falcon achieving
approximately 62% mission readiness, still below ideal targets. [He
emphasized the necessity for sustained investment in modernization to
maintain operational readiness and effectiveness.]{.underline}

[Personnel issues, including recruitment and retention, were also
highlighted]{.underline}. Meink and Allvin cited challenges stemming
from budgetary pressure and emphasized the need [for enhanced support
structures to ensure service members and their families are adequately
cared for.]{.underline}

\"Our airmen and guardians are our greatest asset,\" Meink said. \"We
are committed to enhancing recruiting, expanding training opportunities
and strengthening family support structures to ensure we maintain our
nation\'s competitive edge.\"

In response to congressional concerns regarding strategic
vulnerabilities, particularly the potential overconcentration of U.S.
military assets in locations like Guam, Allvin assured the committee the
Air Force is actively diversifying its posture to improve resiliency.

\"[Guam is not the ultimate destination for Indo-Pacific posture,\"
Allvin said, describing ongoing efforts to distribute forces across the
region.]{.underline}

Wrapping up their testimony, the leaders reiterated their commitment to
maintaining superiority across air and space domains amid evolving
threats, requesting continued support from Congress to ensure U.S.
readiness today and strategic advantages tomorrow.

\"No other service can match what the Air Force delivers: effects
anywhere on the globe, at any scale, on minimal notice,\" Allvin
concluded. \"With your support, we can ensure the Air Force remains the
cornerstone of American power through the 21st century.\"

Cybersecurity Fortification Technological leadership is meaningless
without security and resilience. [Cyber threats, intellectual property
(IP) theft, and supply chain vulnerabilities jeopardize U.S.
competitiveness. Without robust security measures, China will continue
to exploit American innovations to gain a competitive edge. One of the
most critical defenses against cyber threats is cryptographic
innovation. Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs), tokenization, and distributed
data storage provide multilayered safeguards for sensitive data. These
technologies should be integrated into national cybersecurity strategies
to protect financial transactions, healthcare records, AI model
integrity, and other sensitive data from foreign exploitation.
Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs): ZKPs allow information verification
without revealing the data itself, ensuring security and privacy. This
cryptographic innovation is essential to countering China's cyber
espionage efforts and protecting classified information. Tokenization:
Tokenization replaces sensitive data with randomized tokens, preventing
adversaries from gaining actionable insights. Even if a token is
intercepted, it holds no value without access to the secure token vault.
Distributed Data Storage: This approach fragments and encrypts data
across multiple decentralized locations, ensuring that a cyberattack
must compromise multiple systems to retrieve complete data, reducing the
risk of catastrophic exposure.]{.underline} The security of the U.S.
software and hardware supply chain is another fundamental pillar of
national defense and economic resilience. Without stringent protections,
adversarial nations like China will continue exploiting vulnerabilities
to compromise critical systems, introduce backdoors, and steal
proprietary innovations. The U.S. must ensure that all components of its
technology ecosystem---hardware, firmware, and software---adhere to
rigorous security standards to mitigate foreign threats and supply chain
attacks. [One essential measure is the mandatory adoption of the
Software and Hardware Bill of Materials (SBOM and HBOM) across all
federal procurement processes]{.underline}. These measures enhance
transparency and accountability, ensuring that technology components
undergo rigorous vetting and remain free of hidden exploits. By
enforcing this standard, the U.S. can significantly reduce the risk of
supply chain vulnerabilities that state-sponsored cyber threats could
exploit. Additionally, robust firmware security measures must be
mandated to safeguard critical infrastructure components. Firmware is
often an overlooked attack vector yet remains a prime target for
adversarial actors seeking persistent access to essential systems.
Federal agencies must collaborate with private industry partners to
develop hardened firmware security standards and ensure all
government-contracted hardware meets strict cybersecurity requirements.

#### CP solves

**Richberg 20** \[Jim; Fortinet's CISO for the Public Sector leverages
his 35 years' experience driving innovation in Government cybersecurity,
threat intelligence, and cyber strategy & policy, ; 4-29-2020; \"AI,
machine learning and automation in cybersecurity: The time is now\";
GCN;
https://gcn.com/articles/2020/04/29/ai-automation-for-cybersecurity.aspx\]

The [Government Accountability Office states]{.underline} that [the
federal government needs a qualified, well-trained cybersecurity
workforce to protect]{.underline} vital IT [systems]{.underline}, and
one senior cybersecurity official at the Department of Homeland Security
has described the talent gap as a national security issue. The scarcity
of such workers is one reason why securing federal systems is on GAO's
High Risk list. Given this situation, [chief information security
officers]{.underline} who are looking for ways to make their existing
resources more effective [can make great use of automation and
artificial intelligence to]{.underline} supplement and [enhance their
workforce.]{.underline} The overall challenge landscape Results of our
survey, "Making Tough Choices: How CISOs Manage Escalating Threats and
Limited Resources" show that CISOs currently devote 36% of their budgets
to response and 33% to prevention. However, as security needs change,
many CISOs are looking to shift budget away from prevention without
reducing its effectiveness. An optimal budget would reduce spend on
prevention and increase spending on detection and response to 33% and
40% of the security budget, respectively. This shift would give security
teams the speed and flexibility they need to react quickly in the face
of a threat from [cybercriminals]{.underline} who [are outpacing
agencies' defensive capabilities. When breaches are inevitable, it is
important to stop]{.underline} as many as possible [at the point of
intrusion]{.underline}, but it is [even more important to detect and
respond to them before they can do serious damage.]{.underline} One
challenge to matching the speed of today's cyberattacks is that [CISOs
have limited personnel and budget resources.]{.underline} To overcome
these obstacles and attain the detection and response speeds necessary
for effective cybersecurity, [CISOs must take advantage of AI, machine
learning and automation. These]{.underline} technologies [will help
close gaps by correlating threat intelligence and coordinating responses
at machine speed. Government agencies]{.underline} will be able to
[develop a self-defending security system capable of analyzing large
volumes of data, detecting threats, reconfiguring devices and responding
to threats without human intervention.]{.underline} The unique
challenges Federal agencies deal with a number of challenges unique to
the public sector, including the age and complexity of IT systems as
well as the challenges of the government budget cycle. [IT teams for
government agencies]{.underline} aren't just protecting intellectual
property or credit card numbers; they [are]{.underline} also [tasked
with]{.underline} protecting citizens' sensitive data and [national
security secrets.]{.underline} Charged with this duty but constrained by
limited resources, IT leaders must weigh the risks of cyber threats
against the daily demands of keeping networks up and running. This
balancing act becomes more difficult as agencies migrate to the cloud,
adopt internet-of-things devices and transition to software-defined
networks that have no perimeter. These changes mean government networks
are expanding their attack surface with no additional \-- or even
fewer---defensive resources. It's part of the reason why the Verizon
Data Breach Investigations Report found that government agencies were
subjected to more security incidents and more breaches than any other
sector last year. To change that dynamic, [the typical government set-up
of siloed systems must be replaced with a unified platform that can
provide wider and more granular network visibility and more rapid and
automated response.]{.underline} How AI and automation can help [The
keys to making a unified platform work are AI and automation
technologies]{.underline}. Because [organizations cannot keep pace with
the growing volume of threats by manual detection and response, they
need to leverage AI/ML and automation to fill these gaps. AI-driven
solutions]{.underline} can learn what normal behavior looks like in
order to [detect anomalous behavior]{.underline}. For instance, many
employees typically access a specific kind of data or only log on at
certain times. If an employee's account starts to show activity outside
of these normal parameters, [an AI/ML-based solution can detect these
anomalies and can inspect or quarantine the affected device or user
account until it is determined to be safe or mitigating action can be
taken. If the device is infected with malware]{.underline} or is
otherwise acting maliciously, [that AI-based tool can also issue
automated responses. Making these]{.underline} tactical [tasks the
responsibility of AI]{.underline}-driven solutions [frees security teams
to work on more strategic problems, develop threat intelligence or focus
on more difficult tasks]{.underline} such as detecting unknown threats.
IT teams at government agencies that want to implement AI and
[automation must be sure the solution they choose can scale and operate
at machine speeds to keep up with the growing complexity and speed of
the threat.]{.underline} In selecting a solution, IT managers must take
time to ensure solutions have been developed using AI best practices and
training techniques and that they are powered by best-in-class threat
intelligence, security research and analytics technology. Data should be
collected from a variety of nodes \-- both globally and within the local
IT environment \-- to glean the most accurate and actionable information
for supporting a security strategy. Time is of the essence Government
agencies are experiencing more cyberattacks than ever before, at a time
when the nation is facing a 40% cybersecurity skills talent shortage.
Time is of the essence in defending a network, but time is what
under-resourced and over-tasked government IT teams typically lack. [As
attacks come more rapidly]{.underline} and adapt to the evolving IT
environment and new vulnerabilities, [AI/ML and automation are rapidly
becoming necessities]{.underline}. Solutions built from the ground up
with these technologies will help government CISOs counter and
potentially get ahead of today's sophisticated attacks.

### 2NC\-\--AT: No Early Detection\-\--Cybersecurity Adv CP

#### It ensures early detection for efficient measures

**Hewes 23** \[Mitchell Hewes; decade of experience securing critical
infrastructure---especially in nuclear science and technology ; June
2023; \"How Artificial Intelligence Will Change Information and Computer
Security in the Nuclear World\"; IAEA;
https://www.iaea.org/bulletin/how-artificial-intelligence-will-change-information-and-computer-security-in-the-nuclear-world;
Accessed 7-24-2025\]

[Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies could
potentially revolutionize the world, ushering in unprecedented progress
and innovation by transforming how we create]{.underline}, consume and
use information. As AI technologies become increasingly sophisticated,
they will transform industries, streamline processes and may even impact
how we live our lives. [The nuclear sector is no exception, and the
benefits of AI can be expected in many processes and operations in
nuclear and radiological facilities.]{.underline}

At the same time, AI's rapid advancement also brings with it a multitude
of risks. Malicious actors may use AI to launch more advanced and
targeted attacks or exploit it to compromise the integrity of networks,
systems and sensitive information in nuclear and radiological
facilities.

Benefits for information and computer security

The IAEA is preparing for the transformations brought about by AI by
fostering international cooperation in the area to ensure all countries
can benefit from the opportunities while also preparing to mitigate the
risks. Through mechanisms such as Technical Meetings and coordinated
research projects (CRPs), the IAEA is supporting the development,
awareness and application of AI techniques, as well as countermeasures
and defence against malicious actors.

Perhaps the [most significant advantage of AI in information and
computer security is the reduced reliance on human analysis and
intervention. AI-enabled systems can operate 24/7 to monitor networks
and systems for threats. By automating these tasks, nuclear security
professionals have the time to focus on more strategic tasks and respond
more efficiently to incidents when they occur.]{.underline}

"The adaptive learning capabilities of AI can be harnessed to enhance
information and computer security by swiftly identifying threats and
automatically providing human experts with the information they need to
coordinate response activities," said Fan Zhang, an assistant professor
at the Georgia Institute of Technology in the United States of America,
who participated in a CRP to support research in strengthening computer
security. "It will not replace the workforce, but rather establish
resources and insights that will make early detection and response in
computer security realistically achievable."

By leveraging advanced machine learning algorithms, [AI may also help
nuclear and radiological facilities sharpen their defences against
cyberattacks by identifying anomalous data in computer
systems.]{.underline} AI-supported security systems can continuously
monitor and analyse vast amounts of data to determine if any activity is
anomalous to the facility's normal operation. Cyberattacks may feed fake
data to maliciously mislead the operators of nuclear facilities. In this
case, [AI-supported systems can be harnessed to alert those running a
nuclear power plant to even the slightest variation from normal
operations.]{.underline} By offering heightened situational awareness,
AI also allows for the [early detection of criminal actions and prompts
the necessary incident response.]{.underline}

## Deterrence

Thinking About Deterrence: The Nuclear Dimension; Heritage Foundation;
https://www.heritage.org/asia/report/evolving-chinese-thinking-about-deterrence-the-nuclear-dimension;
Accessed 7-22-2025; RS\]

[Recommendations]{.underline} [for U.S. Policy Responses China's focus
on a more limited nuclear deterrent]{.underline} [poses a different
challenge]{.underline} than that of the Soviet Union during the Cold
War. The U.S. has less to fear from a disarming Chinese first strike
aimed at eliminating America's own nuclear deterrent, since China has a
much smaller nuclear inventory. At the same time, however, China poses a
threat separate from President Vladimir Putin's Russia, which has
retained a far larger nuclear arsenal. American security calculations
must take into account the potential threats China may pose directly to
the U.S., to U.S. allies such as Japan, the Philippines, and South
Korea, and to the special relationship with Taiwan. China's increased
assertiveness in the South China Sea raises the potential for
miscalculation and friction there. American security planners need to
take these issues into account in responding to the growing Chinese
challenge in the nuclear realm, as the U.S. needs to deter not only
possible action against the American homeland, but also against key
allies and friends. Consequently, [modernizing and improving the
American nuclear deterrent improves U.S. regional
credibility]{.underline}; conversely, strengthening America's regional
presence reduces the likelihood of a conflict that might escalate to
nuclear proportions. For these reasons, the U.S. should implement
several moves. [Maintain a Modern Nuclear Enterprise]{.underline}. At
present, [the American nuclear triad is comprised of land-based
Minuteman ICBMs manufactured in the]{.underline} [1960s]{.underline};
[B-52 bombers]{.underline} [older than many of their crew
members]{.underline}; [a handful of stealthy B-2 bombers]{.underline};
[and the]{.underline} Ohio-class ballistic-missile submarine [(SSBN)
fleet]{.underline}. The complex of [labs]{.underline} and facilities
[that produce and maintain the nuclear weapons needs]{.underline}
[modernization]{.underline} [as well]{.underline}. The Obama
Administration had promised to spend some [\$85 billion]{.underline} on
this complex in exchange for Republican votes for the New START Treaty.
That [support must be sustained in order to ensure the credibility and
long-term viability of the American nuclear deterrent]{.underline}. The
Trump Administration is currently undertaking a Nuclear Posture Review,
which will examine a variety of modernization efforts as well as nuclear
weapon policies, including the new Columbia-class SSBN, the B-21 bomber,
and a new ground-based nuclear missile. [To cope with the modernizing
Chinese and Russian militaries]{.underline}, as well as North Korea and
potentially Iran, [the Administration and Congress must fund the nuclear
force modernization effort]{.underline}. As important, [they need to
sustain funding for modernizing the nuclear complex, including the
national laboratories]{.underline}, regardless of the New START Treaty.
[Integrate Additional Deterrent Elements]{.underline}. With the end of
the Cold War, the U.S. downgraded the role of tactical nuclear weapons.
In 1992, the U.S. withdrew its tactical nuclear weapons from the Korean
peninsula. The emergence of the North Korean nuclear threat raises the
question of whether that de-emphasis should continue, or if the U.S.
should consider redeploying tactical nuclear weapons to the Pacific
theater. This does not have to be permanent deployment in Korea or
Japan---the regular exercising of redeployment of tactical nuclear
weapons could underscore the broader commitment, while also allowing
political signaling in time of crisis. [An]{.underline} [expansion of
missile defense capabilities]{.underline} [could]{.underline}
[complement]{.underline} [American tactical nuclear
capabilities]{.underline}. An [adversary would then have to deal with
the uncertainty of the effectiveness of any nuclear attack, while also
being confronted with a range of possible]{.underline} n[uclear
ripostes]{.underline}, both tactical and strategic. As in the Cold War,
[the objective would be to establish "escalation dominance," so that no
adversary would ever think that they could dominate one or another
rung]{.underline} [of the nuclear escalatory ladder]{.underline}.
[Maintain the Credibility of American Commitments in the
Pacific]{.underline}. Since its founding, [the U.S. has had ties to the
Asia--Pacific region, including military, security, economic, and
political commitments]{.underline}. [It is in the American interest to
prevent any hegemon from dominating this region]{.underline} [with its
substantial markets and resources]{.underline}. In the Information Age,
when many of the world's microchips and hard drives comes from the
region, [this importance has been heightened]{.underline}. [The U.S.
must maintain a robust forward posture to deter any adversary from
trying to dominate the region.]{.underline} The lack of freedom of
navigation operations (FONOPS) in the South China Sea for three years
(2012--2015) is but one example of a self-inflicted, sucking chest wound
of degraded credibility. The impact of sequestration on American
training and forward presence is another. [American forces must make
their presence known again]{.underline}, such as the recent FONOPS in
the Spratlys area, [in order to put away any misimpressions of American
abandonment of the region. Maintain the Visibility of the American
Commitment]{.underline}. The U.S. is at the center of a network of
friendships and alliances with a variety of nations spanning the entire
[western Pacific]{.underline}. [This is a key strength]{.underline}---as
these alliances are matters of choice, not coercion---which [merits
regular attention]{.underline}. This includes [preserving close
coordination]{.underline} [and cooperation with long-standing allies
like]{.underline} [Australia]{.underline}, [Japan]{.underline},
[the]{.underline} [Philippines]{.underline}, [South Korea]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} [Thailand]{.underline}, [as well as friends
like]{.underline} [New Zealand]{.underline}, [Singapore]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} [Taiwan]{.underline}. [Regular military
exercises]{.underline} [are one means of demonstrating this commitment,
as are regular political visits by senior leaders]{.underline}, [whether
to individual countries or to regional forums such as Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
[A]{.underline}ssociation of [S]{.underline}outh[e]{.underline}ast
[A]{.underline}sian [N]{.underline}ations meetings. In addition,
[strengthening trade ties]{.underline} [with the region helps reinforce
the economic pillar of the multi-faceted relationship]{.underline}. None
of the elements can be taken for granted. Leaders from both sides of the
Pacific must ensure that they explain to their nations the importance of
these relationships. In doing so, they will garner public support, which
makes for stronger relationships. [The strengthening of these
relationships can help avoid misimpressions of the extent of American
and allied resolve and strength]{.underline}.

The [pathogens that cause most emerging infectious diseases]{.underline}
in humans [originate in animals,]{.underline} particularly wildlife, and
then [spill over into humans.]{.underline} The accelerating frequency
with which humans and domestic animals encounter wildlife because of
activities such as land-use change, animal husbandry, and markets and
trade in live wildlife has created growing opportunities for pathogen
spillover. The [risk of pathogen spillover]{.underline} and early
disease spread among domestic animals and humans, however, [can be
reduced by stopping the clearing and degradation of tropical and
subtropical forests, improving health and economic security of
communities living in emerging infectious disease hotspots, enhancing
biosecurity in animal husbandry, shutting down or strictly regulating
wildlife markets and trade, and expanding pathogen
surveillance]{.underline}. We summarize expert opinions on how to
implement these goals to prevent outbreaks, epidemics, and pandemics.

[Multiple approaches can be used to address spillover caused by tropical
and subtropical forest clearing and degradation.]{.underline} Integrated
policies with increased enforcement aim to remove incentives for
deforestation while respecting rights of Indigenous Peoples and local
communities (IPLCs). Brazil successfully demonstrated this approach in
the Amazon Basin. In 2004, [the government of Brazil, working with
international donors, provided sufficient funds to put into action
policies that resulted in a 70% reduction in annual
deforestation]{.underline} (18). After 2012, policy enforcement weakened
and deforestation rose, demonstrating that sustained commitment is
crucial for success[. Agricultural production increased while the policy
was in effect, suggesting reduced deforestation did not affect economic
development]{.underline} (18--20). Of note, nearly 50% of intact forests
in the Amazon Basin are in Indigenous territories, and deforestation
rates on these lands are lower than elsewhere (21).

[Regulatory and market-based measures can establish standards that
affect international supply and demand for products and lead to
decreased deforestation.]{.underline} For instance, Europe is
considering restricting imports of commodities such as soybeans, beef,
cocoa, and palm oil if production is linked to deforestation (22). In an
example of market-based measures, \>30 financial institutions with
trillions of US dollars in assets have pledged to end investment in
activities linked to deforestation (23).

[Payment for ecosystem services gives landholders incentives to maintain
or increase forest cover on their lands, thus enhancing levels of
ecosystem services provided by those forests]{.underline} (24). Success
of this strategy has varied across implementation sites; better outcomes
might be achieved by focusing on local or regional scales, using in-kind
contributions rather than cash payments, and emphasizing equity (24).

[Community-designed interventions provide local services, such as
healthcare, to IPLCs living within and near forests to minimize reliance
on deforestation to generate income]{.underline}. For example,
communities in Indonesian Borneo were heavily engaged in local illegal
logging partly because of high healthcare costs (25). When supported to
design their own solutions, IPLCs chose to build a medical center and
start an alternative livelihood program (25). After those solutions were
put in place over a decade, at a total cost of US \$5.2 million, the
percentage of households relying on illegal logging decreased by 90%,
forest regrowth increased by 21,000 hectares, and US \$65 million in
carbon loss was averted (25). Similar models have been successfully
replicated in Madagascar and Brazil.

activities might involve intentional (e.g., wildlife trade) or
unintentional contact with wildlife (26[). Such areas make up only 4% of
global area (10% of tropical area), but account for 60% of global
spillover risk (26).]{.underline} Thus, community-designed interventions
to decrease human and domestic animal contact with wildlife probably
represent the best means to reduce virus spillover in these areas. [Many
communities in emerging infectious disease hotspots lack access to
healthcare, sustainable livelihoods, food security, and
education]{.underline} (27). Improving health and economic security are
often high priorities for these communities, creating alignment between
local needs and global pandemic prevention priorities.

[Actions to reduce local risk for zoonotic diseases can be
simple.]{.underline} For example, Nipah virus infection risk can be
[reduced by covering the shaved areas of palm tree trunks and sap
vessels, thus preventing contamination with excrement of bats that feed
on these palms (28). Where contact cannot be eliminated, improved
practices, such as better sanitary practices during wildlife butchering,
can minimize spillover (29).]{.underline}

Community-designed interventions to reduce human--wildlife contact and
decrease spillover risk have not been widely implemented. However,
projects in several countries, such as in Indonesia (as described in the
previous section) and in Uganda, show that changing relationships
between communities, forests, and wildlife are possible and beneficial
(25,30). A project in Manombo Rainforest, Madagascar, aims to put in
place community-designed conservation initiatives and collect metrics
over 10 years to assess effects on biodiversity and wildlife and human
health (A. Emerson et al., unpub. data). [More projects specifically
targeting spillover risk in emerging disease hotspots are needed as
proofs of concept (31). Such pioneering projects should include
measurement of spillover within target communities to enable thorough
outcome assessments (32).]{.underline}

[The World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) defines biosecurity in
animal husbandry as "a set of management and physical measures designed
to reduce the risk of introduction, establishment and spread of animal
diseases, infections or infestations]{.underline} to, from and within an
animal population" (33). Several zoonotic viruses, including highly
pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus, 2009 pandemic influenza
A(H1N1) virus, Nipah virus, and Middle East respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (MERS-CoV), have emerged from wildlife reservoirs into
humans via commercial animal industries (5,34--36).

Improving biosecurity in animal husbandry [requires management measures,
such as quarantining new animals and vaccinating animals against endemic
disease, and physical measures, such as enclosures that separate farm
animals from each other and from wildlife]{.underline} (37). However,
backyard flocks and large-scale commercial industrial systems face
challenges in implementing biosecurity (38). Standard biosecurity
recommendations are rarely tailored for extensive production systems in
resource-limited settings, and translating recommendations into local
languages requires time and knowledge of local perceptions of disease
(37,38). [Commercial industrial systems require major investments in
biosecurity measures to counteract zoonotic disease transmission
risks]{.underline} posed by raising a high density of genetically
homogeneous, single-age animals, especially when animal welfare is
suboptimal (39).

In addition to biosecurity challenges, humans also have major effects on
disease incursion into and spread within backyard and commercial
industrial systems. Underfunded animal health and extension services,
which contributes to ineffective livestock disease surveillance, and
chronic household food insecurity (i.e., lack of regular access to
sufficient safe and nutritious food), drive risky husbandry practices
and household food choices such as consumption of sick animals or
animals that died of disease (40,41). Two global institutions mandated
to oversee animal disease prevention and control recognize these
challenges: the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
(FAO) and WOAH. In April 2022, FAO and WOAH signed an agreement with the
World Health Organization and the United Nations Environment Program to
sustainably balance and optimize the health of humans, animals, plants,
and the environment and released the One Health Joint Plan of Action to
improve prevention, prediction, detection, and response to health
threats (42,43). This partnership will require engagement and support
from national and local agencies and organizations.

Biosecurity could be greatly enhanced through [investments in public and
private animal health services, identification of animal illnesses of
public health concern by animal holders, and interventions to address
these (26,44). Benefits of this approach include decreased pathogen
transmission between wildlife and domestic animals, enhanced disease
surveillance sensitivity via increased producer trust in services, fewer
greenhouse gas emissions through efficiency, and improved food
security]{.underline} (37,40,45,46). This approach is fully compatible
with the described community-designed interventions and could be
implemented by the same project teams, saving costs. Emerging infectious
disease hotspots are among the highest priority areas for reducing
spillover risk associated with animal husbandry. Therefore,
community-designed interventions and animal husbandry projects should be
integrated into any One Health pandemic prevention framework.

Controlling vaccine-preventable diseases in domestic animals also should
be prioritized. Vaccination benefits communities and domestic animals
through reduced illness and death from vaccine-targeted disease.
Vaccination also reduces the spread of emerging infectious diseases
because diagnosis can be delayed when emerging infectious diseases have
similar clinical signs to vaccine-preventable diseases. For example,
identification of highly pathogenic avian influenza in chickens
frequently is delayed in areas with low Newcastle disease vaccination
rates (45,47). Similarly, control for outbreaks of African swine fever
(ASF), a disease with no effective vaccine, is hampered by low
vaccination rates against classical swine fever (CSF) because the
diseases have similar clinical signs, making ASF differentiation
difficult in herds not vaccinated against CSF (48). In China, a 2019
pork shortage caused by ASF might have increased consumer demand for
wildlife, thereby increasing the risk of pathogen spillover (2).

[Legal and illegal wildlife markets and trade pose a high risk for
emergence, amplification, and transmission of zoonotic
pathogens]{.underline}, as observed with mpox virus, SARS-CoV-1, and
probably SARS-CoV-2 (2,3,5). Wildlife trade is driven by demand for
animals as food and pets and for skins, traditional medicines, and
ornaments. For pandemic prevention, the primary focus should be live and
freshly butchered wild birds and mammals because those pose the highest
risk for spillover. Furthermore, [prevention should focus on commercial
wildlife markets and trade but should prioritize the rights of
IPLCs,]{.underline} who are often dependent on wildlife for food and
livelihoods. Addressing wildlife markets and trade that lead to pathogen
spillover will require investments in 4 areas.

First, [policy reform to restrict or close legal commercial wildlife
markets and trade is needed. New legislation and amendments to existing
laws should aim to end the sale of live and freshly butchered wild birds
and mammals for commercial purposes;]{.underline} such reforms are
consistent with recommendations released in 2021 by the World Health
Organization (49). Several countries have taken these steps. For
example, China banned farming, hunting, trading, and consuming
terrestrial wildlife in the context of COVID-19 in February 2020 (50).
In March 2020, Gabon banned sale and consumption of pangolins and bats
(51).

Second, [legislation and enforcement need to reflect efforts to address
illegal wildlife markets and trade. Law enforcement, judicial, and other
agencies mandated to stop illegal activities and bring criminals to
justice should have budgets for staffing, equipment, training,
enforcement, and judicial activities.]{.underline} In addition, they
should have sufficient legal mandates to [use all available
investigative approaches and be held to the highest integrity standards
to eradicate corruption.]{.underline} Although pathogen spillover is
indifferent to the legality of individual animals in trade, [increased
vigilance to combat wildlife trafficking remains a
priority.]{.underline}

Third, programs focusing on local communities and the rural poor need to
be implemented to reduce dependence on wildlife markets and trade for
income[. Partnerships between local communities and governments will be
crucial to provide incentives for robust and sustainable income streams
that do not depend on wildlife markets and trade.]{.underline}

Fourth, to end the purchase and desirability of live wild birds and
mammals, government leaders and experts need to lead behavior change
efforts that apply behavioral science, psychology, economics, and social
marketing best practices. Civil society and academia have capacity to
find solutions. Several projects are underway, but more effective and
sustainable efforts could benefit from public institutions leading or
co-leading scale-up programs. In numerous countries, wildlife
consumption, especially in urban centers, is not required for food
security; rather, wildlife is consumed as a luxury, as a status symbol,
or for perceived health reasons. In China, the price for wildlife is
generally 2- to 5-fold higher than for pork, the most common animal
protein source in the country, and even higher for exotic, endangered,
or illegally obtained species (52,53[). Reducing urban demand for
wildlife will have a positive effect on IPLCs by reducing economic
incentives to those supplying the trade and leaving more wildlife for
IPLC subsistence needs.]{.underline} A strategy to ensure recognition
and support of IPLC rights is vital, but that support must not be used
as a smokescreen to continue business-as-usual in commercial markets and
trade.

[Pathogen surveillance platforms that include coordinated multisectoral
efforts can increase their effectiveness (54).]{.underline} In this
context, pathogen surveillance refers to various ongoing active and
passive systems for collecting and reporting data on exposures or
infections at the human or animal population level; [the frequency and
severity of disease caused by a given pathogen; and the evolution of
microbes circulating in natural reservoirs and additional hosts (55).
Integrated surveillance systems provide insights into zoonotic
pathogens]{.underline}, such as Ebola virus, in their ever-changing
natural reservoirs, as well as data on spillover into domestic animals
and humans, which can [inform targeted pandemic prevention,
preparedness, and response strategies]{.underline} (56,57). For example,
25 years of data showed that Hendra virus spillover from bats to horses
increased during periods of environmental stress; this finding provides
evidence for using forest restoration as an ecologic countermeasure to
reduce future spillovers (58).

[Systematic wildlife surveillance will require substantial veterinary
medical capacity and massive strengthening of multisectoral,
decentralized, laboratory networks to support molecular and serologic
screening of animal and human samples]{.underline}. Laboratory-based
surveillance should include pathogen-specific molecular and serologic
diagnostic assays and unbiased high-throughput screening tools (59,60).
As whole-genome sequencing platforms and near real-time genomic
sequencing for examining viral evolution and epidemiology become more
common and field applicable, investments in bioinformatics capacity to
[analyze genomic data will become increasingly vital.]{.underline}

For humans, data can be extracted from several primary sources,
including health information systems, sentinel surveillance sites, and
repeated standard household surveys, to monitor for pathogen emergence.
Such systems could be extended to wild and domestic animal populations.
Many human febrile illnesses in low-income countries never reach the
health system and are not thoroughly evaluated; thus, many viral
infections are never diagnosed (61,62[). Routine diagnostic systems for
traditionally undiagnosed illnesses could be improved by increasing
libraries of pathogens found in wild and domestic animal
populations.]{.underline} However, limited access to diagnostic testing
is not just confined to low-income countries; even countries like the
United States experienced challenges that hampered disease control
efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic and mpox epidemic (63,64).

Mounting evidence suggests that zoonotic pathogen spillover occurs more
frequently than previously known. A study of exposure to batborne
SARS-related coronaviruses suggested that ≈66,000 persons are infected
with SARS-related coronaviruses annually in South and Southeast Asia
(65). High rates of pre--COVID-19 SARS-related coronavirus exposure also
were observed in Sierra Leone (66). This evidence underscores the need
to improve surveillance for zoonotic pathogens that have pandemic
potential.

Evidence suggests that zoonotic [(animal origin) coronaviruses have
caused]{.underline} three recent emerging infectious disease
([EID]{.underline}) outbreaks: severe acute respiratory syndrome
([SARS]{.underline}), Middle East respiratory syndrome
([MERS]{.underline}), and the current coronavirus disease 2019
([COVID-19]{.underline}) pandemic. In the search for an intermediate
host for SARS coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19), studies
have identified SARS-CoV-2--like strains in bats (1) and pangolins (2),
but these do not contain the same polybasic cleavage site that is
present in SARS-CoV-2 (3). It is unknown what the intermediate host for
this spillover event was because to date there are no international or
national conventions on pathogen screening associated with animals,
animal products, or their movements, and capacity for EID diagnostics is
limited along much of the human-wildlife interface. EID risks associated
with the wildlife trade remain the largest unmet challenge of current
disease surveillance efforts. Although viruses represent a fraction of
∼1400 known human pathogens, they place a disproportionate burden on
global health (4). Around [89% of the 180 recognized RNA viruses with
the potential to harm humans are zoonotic]{.underline}. Coronaviruses
are only the tip of the spillover iceberg: HIV came from nonhuman
primates, Ebola came from bats, and H5N1 and H1N1 influenza strains came
from birds and pigs, respectively. Indeed, 60% of EIDs are zoonotic in
nature, and more than 70% of these have an origin in wildlife (5).
Unchecked exploitation of wildlife---whether for sustenance or profit,
legal or illegal---puts humans in direct contact with myriad unfamiliar
species. Increased contact occurs in the global practice of bushmeat and
game hunting and in wildlife farms, which often unsustainably and
illegally supply wildlife for consumption or trade (6). Imported,
hunted, and farmed wildlife then reach a common endpoint, wildlife
markets. There, animals endure debilitating and immunocompromising
conditions that promote disease transmission: packed cages, poor
biosecurity, and unhygienic shedding of animal excreta (7). Direct
human-wildlife contact, mixing of nonendemic wildlife species, and
limited health and safety standards are all criteria for a zoonotic
hotspot. Many wildlife markets around the world meet these criteria, yet
disease surveillance in them is largely absent. More broadly, although
the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES)
regulates international wildlife trade on the basis of species\'
endangered status, only a few countries use strict veterinary import
controls, and there are no global regulations on pathogen screening
associated with the international trade in wildlife. [Pathogen
biosurveillance and how humans interact with wildlife are at the crux of
EID risk management and response.]{.underline} After bats were
identified as likely reservoirs for a range of zoonotic events (such as
Hendra, Nipah, SARS, MERS, and Ebola) (8), surveillance of a single cave
in southwest China between 2011 and 2015 revealed 11 novel coronaviruses
(9). From 2015 to 2017, of 1497 people tested in the surrounding Yunnan,
Guangxi, and Guangdong districts, nine (0.6%) were positive for prior
bat coronavirus antibodies, and 265 (17%) reported SARS- or
influenzatype symptoms associated with contact with poultry, carnivores,
rodents, shrews, or bats (10). These findings, formally reported in
September 2019, provided a warning about the risk of zoonotic
coronaviruses that was neither heard nor heeded. The COVID-19 pandemic
is evidence that bridging the gap between research and response is
critical to anticipating and mitigating future spillover events.
PREDICT, the intermittently federally funded offshoot of the 2009 United
States Agency for International Development (USAID) Emerging Pandemic
Threats program that partially financed the study of bat coronaviruses
(10), screened 164,000 animals and humans and detected 949 novel viruses
in zoonotic hotspots across 30 countries between 2009 and 2019. The
Global Virome Project---a collaboration between experts in global health
and pandemic prevention---aims to sequence all animal virus strains over
a 10-year period, with a projected cost of \$1.2 billion. Both projects
share stakeholders, and although their missions are likely to adapt to a
post--COVID-19 world, one of their stated goals includes strengthening
existing laboratory capacities along the human-wildlife interface. But
are there sufficient numbers of animal pathogen reference laboratories?
According to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) (11), there
are 125 reference laboratories certified to screen for one or more
target pathogens (and not for broad pathogen surveillance). Their global
distribution does not reflect EID risks. Southeast Asia, Africa, and
Central and South America carry the burden of EID risk, yet 78 (62%) of
reference laboratories are in Europe and North America; only 33 (26%)
are in Asia (14 in China and 8 in Japan), with 12 (34%) spread between 7
countries; 3 (∼2%) are in Africa; 4 (∼3%) are in Australia, and 8 (∼6%)
are in South America. Although this does not account for laboratory size
or screening methods and capacity, it is evident that [many regions with
zoonotic hotspots lack testing facilities with the capability of
conducting disease surveillance.]{.underline} Markets selling live
animals, including wildlife such as this slow loris at the Borito Market
in Jakarta, Indonesia, are hotspots for zoonotic spillover and should be
monitored to better manage emerging infectious diseases. What can be
done to mitigate future zoonotic EIDs? Centralized biosurveillance
efforts produce results but are expensive, maintained by a select few
countries, and subject to political whims, as evidenced by the 2019
shift in funding for PREDICT, a recent recall of U.S. National
Institutes of Health (NIH) support for the EcoHealth Alliance, and the
withdrawal of the United States from the World Health Organization
(WHO). As such, they are not immediately scalable, nor do they stimulate
widespread capacity. The international wildlife trade is a substantial
global industry in need of greater oversight. Because ill-conceived
restrictions would affect millions of people and likely drive these
activities deeper underground, further impeding regulation (12), the
first step is to establish [a more cost-effective, **decentralized
disease surveillance** system.]{.underline} It [would **empower** local
wildlife and public health professionals to test for diseases year
round]{.underline}, at source, without criminalizing public
participation in screening programs. [Such screening was not
technologically feasible after the emergence of the H1N1 influenza virus
in 2009]{.underline}, but now, [affordable modern technologies enable
quick in situ biosample processing]{.underline}, whole-genome
sequencing, metagenomics, and metabarcoding of pathogens. [This would
enable **proactive, broad, routine wildlife** pathogen screening in
remote areas rather than reactive targeted testing. Decentralized
laboratories must be able to extract genomic material and conduct
metagenomic sequencing and targeted pathogen testing if necessary. As
demand increases, individual technologies have evolved to be smaller,
simpler, and **more affordable**]{.underline}**.** Multiplex polymerase
chain reaction (PCR)--based viral enrichment protocols with portable DNA
sequencers (such as MinION) have been deployed for in situ monitoring of
Ebola virus, Zika virus, and now SARS-CoV-2 infections (13). Practical
training in applying these laboratory solutions (such as miniature
centrifuges, thermocyclers, and electrophoresis setups) is well
documented, even in remote locations (14). However, most pathogen
screening efforts that use such equipment have been in response to human
disease outbreaks. These technologies could be used to regularly monitor
entire pathogen families of increased global concern in animals and
areas with increased risk of zoonotic spillover, including wildlife
markets or farms and free-ranging high-risk taxa such as primates and
bats (15). [Local wildlife scientists and health care workers can be
trained on how to safely use facilities with broadly accessible
molecular equipment in local facilities with standard biosecurity
practices to prevent risk of pathogen **spillover** into the
community.]{.underline} Restricting such training and activities to
relatively few specialized centers impedes broad surveillance efforts.
Any animal surveillance program should integrate with testing programs
for humans to capture early zoonotic pathogen circulation between human
and nonhuman populations. Sources of zoonotic pathogens are frequently
unclear and often not possible to determine after the early stages of a
spillover event. [Monitoring could remove much of this uncertainty,
allowing molecular epidemiology to inform short- and long-term responses
on both a local and global level]{.underline}. To complement
decentralized laboratories, [a publicly accessible, centralized, curated
system for monitoring pathogens must be established]{.underline} for
three main reasons: (i) This [would provide **instant** pathogen
classifications]{.underline} based on comparative genomics, further
cross-linked to reference data on prevalence by species and region. (ii)
A centralized curated system could [alert to EID
indicators,]{.underline} including gains and losses of strains,
pathogen-specific changes in host species numbers, rapid increases in
mutation rates that may indicate pathogen spillover into a naive host,
and pathogen detection in traded animals that do not occur in wild
counterparts. (iii) For virus families that are poised to spillover into
human populations, genomic sequence data [can reveal diversity of key
pathogen proteins]{.underline} in circulating strains (for example, the
spike protein that mediates human cell entry of coronaviruses, and the
RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is important for viral replication).
Such approaches assist in identifying broad-spectrum antivirals and
vaccination targets as well as treatment-resistant pathogen variants
that pose a risk of generating future EIDs. An example of a
disease-focused public database that could be expanded is the GISAID
(global initiative on sharing all influenza data) EpiFlu repository, a
global initiative developed for sharing influenza virus sequence data
and currently also documenting SARS-CoV-2 sequences. It facilitates data
access for registered users while securing data ownership by requiring
that contributors be acknowledged in derivative research. Additionally,
the database could include report-generating features such as those in
the Zoological Information Management Software (ZIMS), used by more than
1000 Species360--accredited [zoological institutions worldwide to upload
biomedical data and compute reference ranges across multiple variables
and species. An internationally recognized standard for managing
wildlife trade on the basis of known disease risks should be
established.]{.underline} Currently, few countries consider disease risk
as a factor in regulating wildlife imports and exports, and a disease
status equivalent to CITES is lacking. Pathogen screening is also not
required nor facilitated before, during, or after translocating wildlife
products, leaving pathogen status to be declared by the shipper, who may
not have the experience to make such determinations. Because a large
number of animals naturally carry pathogens that could spillover to
humans if improperly handled, the means to identify the species for
which security standards should be enhanced, or for which trade and
consumption should potentially be prohibited, is needed. An important
caveat is that such classifications can stigmatize animals to their
detriment and incite fear-based human behaviors that may threaten
species conservation. [A decentralized network could **improve
feedback** between those who screen samples and those who curate data to
**bolster** the safety of wildlife and humans, a fundamentally "One
Health" approach]{.underline}. This would increase localized knowledge
of EID risks, provide earlier warnings and faster global responses to
spillovers, and inform wildlife trade policy[. This model is more robust
to shifting political landscapes and funding and does not ignore the
role of advanced regional research laboratories, which also provide
vital targeted pathogen screening.]{.underline} Research laboratories
can also provide samples for or generate high-quality host de novo
reference genome assemblies and expand regional capacity for biobanking,
including cell cultures, which will improve understanding of the
co-evolutionary processes that underlie pathogen-host range and
susceptibility. By giving more parties a stake in the effort,
decentralization is more likely to succeed in garnering geographically
representative participation that explicitly includes the most at-risk,
under-resourced regions.

According to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on
Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, human activities such as illegal
[wildlife trade, industrial poultry production, and]{.underline} climate
change [increase the risk of a zoonotic spillover]{.underline} --- the
transmission of diseases from animals to humans. With more than five new
infectious diseases emerging each year, there's always the threat of any
of them becoming a pandemic. When that happens, [vaccine platforms will
be **crucial** for **pandemic preparedness**. Platform technology, a
term more popular in computer science, refers to a technology that
serves as the basis for the development of multiple other processes,
applications, and technologies. Extending the definition to pharma, a
vaccine platform is any underlying technology --- a mechanism, delivery
method, or cell line --- that can be used to develop **multiple
vaccines**]{.underline}. What are the benefits of investing in platform
technologies rather than standalone vaccines? Speed is vital to slow
down the spread Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna
received emergency use approvals from the FDA, and subsequently the EMA,
within 11 months of China sharing the genome of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in
January 2020. This made them the fastest vaccines ever approved in
history. While it is true that unprecedented amounts of funding were
made available, with nearly a hundred different vaccines in the
pipeline, and that pharma companies benefited from previous research on
coronaviruses, there's more underlying the speed of the development of
these two vaccines. Both were built using messenger RNA (mRNA)
technology, and were the first approved medicines that use this
technology. Other approved Covid-19 vaccines are based on adenoviral
vector technology, as well as the more classical protein-based and
live-attenuated vaccines. The rapid development of mRNA and adenoviral
vector vaccines, when compared to other Covid-19 vaccines, highlights a
major benefit of new vaccine platforms: speed. For instance, Moderna
designed its Covid-19 vaccine in just two days. Similarly, the German
company BioNTech took just a day to design its vaccine. This is in sharp
contrast to conventional vaccines that generally take several months to
years to design. [Having multiple vaccine platforms in the race to
develop a vaccine also contributes to a **faster pandemic response**.
Surveillance studies routinely identify zoonotic viruses that are likely
to spill over to humans. These present ideal pools of candidates to
validate emerging vaccine platforms. Doing this would **speed** up
development should any of these viruses actually spill
over.]{.underline} "The idea is that once viruses are selected, vaccines
can be produced in different platforms and tested in phase I and phase
II trials with some of the produced vaccine being stockpiled," Florian
Krammer, professor at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New
York, noted in a scientific paper published in Med. "A well-prepared
infrastructure capable of producing vaccines 3--4 months into the
outbreak would have saved many lives and would likely have normalized
the situation in many geographic areas by now," he added. While that
could have prevented many deaths, the timeline of Covid-19 vaccines was
impressive nonetheless. How did pharma companies manage to design
vaccines so quickly? [The answer lies in the other major benefit of
vaccine platforms: flexibility. Vaccine platforms are **flexible** Both
Moderna and BioNTech were working on mRNA vaccines for cancers and
infectious diseases such as influenza and Zika before the pandemic. The
companies leveraged the platforms developed for these **other vaccines**
to steer their Covid-19 vaccine efforts.]{.underline}

// accessed 07-24-25 // AA

In an era marked by geopolitical shifts and crises[, the enduring
significance of transatlantic unity between the European Union and the
United States is more critical than ever]{.underline}. The recent report
on EU-US relations to the European Parliament from its Foreign Affairs
Committee (for which I was rapporteur), to be debated in plenary today,
is a timely reminder. [As the world grapples with multifaceted
challenges, the report not only underscores our shared values and
interests but also charts a course for deepening this vital partnership
in pursuit of global stability and prosperity]{.underline}. Its central
thesis is that the EU and the US must commit to a strengthened
partnership rooted in leadership, responsibility and multilateralism.
[This is essential for tackling global challenges that threaten our
common values, security and economic wellbeing.]{.underline} Tangible
benefits [Among domains where co-operation can yield tangible benefits,
foremost is digital and technological innovation]{.underline}. As
highlighted in an EIT Digital report on transatlantic relations in
June[, stronger regulatory alignment and integrated research and
development are crucial, especially in strategic sectors such as
semiconductors, pharmaceuticals, batteries and rare earths.]{.underline}
These are vital due to their vulnerable supply chains amid heightened
geopolitical tensions, particularly with China's rise and the impacts of
Russia's aggression in Ukraine. The shift in global trade dynamics
marked by the US importing more from Europe than from China in 2022
underscores the importance of the transatlantic economic relationship in
the global economic order. This is testament to the strength and
potential of our partnership, aligning closely with the values of
equitable economic growth and co-operation. [The EU-US Trade and
Technology Council (TTC) has emerged as a key vehicle for advancing
transatlantic dialogue. It provides an effective, high-level platform
for co-ordinating approaches to global-trade, economic and technological
issues, combating disinformation and supporting Ukraine.]{.underline}
The US is urged to continue its solidarity while closely working with
the EU to protect peace, security and democracy in Europe, as well as
upholding international law and the United Nations Charter. Despite
potential internal political divides, one hopes strong US support for
Ukraine will persist. [Regular consultations between the European
Parliament and the US Congress are vital in supporting the work of the
TTC, particularly in terms of policy convergence in the digital
realm.]{.underline} These discussions foster joint efforts on digital
innovation, regulation and joint standards, offering significant
benefits to both regions. Indeed, the wide range of shared interests
between the [US and the EU would greatly benefit from a more robust
parliamentary dimension. This should involve Congress, the European
Parliament and national parliaments. It should focus on foreign affairs,
trade, technology regulation, artificial intelligence and other
innovations]{.underline}. Such collaborative efforts would increase
public awareness, reinforce democratic legitimacy and enhance oversight,
improving the ability to deliver on joint initiatives. Standing together
While pursuing transatlantic co-operation [in areas of shared interest,
in parallel the EU should foster its strategic autonomy in political,
defence, economic and trade relations. Standing together against
Russia's war and supporting Ukraine's victory is increasingly crucial.
The EU and the US, along with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and
global partners, are committed to supporting Ukraine through
humanitarian assistance]{.underline}, military support and aid for
economic and social recovery and reconstruction, while holding Russia to
account. Utilising initiatives such as the European defence industry
reinforcement through common procurement act (DIRPA), the Act in Support
of Ammunition Production, and the European Peace Facility is essential
to maintain support for Ukraine. Recognising the significant
contribution of the US to European security, past and present, EU member
states must respect their commitments to defence spending. This involves
significantly increasing national investments to achieve fairer
burden-sharing with the US. Building on the third joint EU-NATO
declaration, there is a focus on enhancing EU-NATO co-operation. Areas
of collaboration include resilience, protection of critical
infrastructure, emerging and disruptive technologies, space, the
security implications of climate change, the fight against maritime
piracy and combating foreign manipulation of information and
interference. [The EU Strategic Compass adopted in March 2022
underscores the importance of partnerships, with a special focus on the
US and NATO. Ensuring complementarity with the NATO Strategic Concept is
however also crucial. This involves deepening co-operation particularly
in military mobility, cybersecurity, defence research, dual-use
infrastructure, resilience and inclusive joint exercises. NATO continues
to be the cornerstone of collective defence for its members and a
guarantor of transatlantic security. This was emphasised by the EU and
the US conducting their first joint naval exercise in March, showcasing
their combined military capabilities and commitment to regional
stability.]{.underline} The US European Deterrence Initiative plays a
pivotal role in boosting the military readiness of European allies and
deterring Russian aggression. [Since 2015, the US has invested over \$35
billion to support US troop deployments in Europe and assist in
capability development and readiness, reflecting the enduring commitment
to European security.]{.underline} Meanwhile, China's growing economic
and military presence in the Mediterranean and African countries poses
new strategic challenges. This expansion necessitates a nuanced approach
to the region's geopolitical dynamics. Spectrum of threats Transatlantic
dialogue and parliamentary diplomacy are critical in addressing a
spectrum of threats and urgent challenges. These range from climate
change and authoritarian and totalitarian regimes---including in Europe
and Asia---to the concerning situation in the middle east, global
criminal networks, and gender inequality and discrimination.
[Transatlantic dialogue aims to build bipartisan relations that will
further consolidate the relationship. It seeks to bridge the increasing
divides between urban and rural areas and to champion digital and green
transformation for sustainable modernisation.]{.underline} New
technologies such as AI, space capabilities and quantum computing
present unprecedented opportunities and challenges in defence and
foreign policy. [These necessitate a clear strategy and consensus among
EU member states and the US to harness their potential while mitigating
risks, ensuring that the technologies are developed and used responsibly
for the benefit of mankind.]{.underline} Strengthening the transatlantic
partnership is crucial to support democracy, fundamental freedoms, human
rights, gender equality, the rule of law, the rules-based international
order and multilateralism---particularly in response to growing
authoritarianism around the world. This includes implementing the recent
commitment to increase funding to the Erasmus+ programme and to double
EU support for the Fulbright-Schuman program, fostering exchanges
between US and European students and researchers. Together with our
partners in the US, it is important to demonstrate through concrete
actions that democracy can deliver significant results for individuals
and societies globally and is capable of resisting autocratic pressure
and influence, as well as other serious emerging threats. We strive to
reinforce the democratic structures that have ensured prosperity and
stability for decades on both sides of the Atlantic and globally.
Developing effective solutions to global problems that affect our
political, social and economic systems is key to this endeavour. There
is a need to reinforce the accountability and resilience of our
democratic systems, especially in the run-up to the elections next year
in both regions---particularly in light of recent attempts to meddle in
electoral processes. Enhancing transatlantic dialogue and co-operation
on policies that support democracy, human rights and the rule of law and
combat corruption and foreign interference from authoritarian regimes is
crucial. This includes addressing electoral interference, disinformation
and economic and political coercion---as well as advocating our values
globally.

## Fish Wars

### 1NC -- Fish Wars

#### The United States federal government should

#### \-\--develop climate-smart fisheries, integrate blue food security, and improve fish tracers;

#### \-\--negotiate for proactive protection of the maritime environment through the Central Arctic Ocean Fisheries agreement;

#### \-\--include IUU fishing and crime as an authorized mission set of the U.S. military;

#### \-\-\--expand ship ride agreements for the U.S. Coast Guard;

#### \-\-\--and increase funding for Maritime Safe Act of 2019.

#### Solves fish wars

**WWF Arctic 24** \[World Wildlife Fund Arctic; WWF Arctic is a leading
international conservation organization dedicated to protecting
biodiversity and addresses critical threats to the planet. They operate
in nearly 100 countries; 10-30-2024; \"The coming conflicts at the top
of the world\"; WWF;
https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/the-coming-conflicts-at-the-top-of-the-world;
Accessed 7-22-2025\]

A Brewing Storm for Arctic Fisheries

[As Arctic ice melts at an alarming rate, an ocean that was once capped
by ice throughout the year is now opening up to new
possibilities.]{.underline} The Arctic Ocean\'s diminishing sea ice
extent, with an almost 13% reduction per decade, is not just a sign of
climatic upheaval but a prelude to intensifying conflicts over newfound
resources.

Historically, fisheries conflict has increased 20-fold in recent decades
with climate change projected to shift a quarter of all fish stocks to
cooler waters and across international borders within the next decade,
the situation could worsen, positioning fish to be the next resource to
drive geopolitical competition.

Unlike other global regions where diminishing stocks lead to increased
conflict, the Arctic is experiencing disputes over changing and moving
fisheries populations and the arrival of new species. [And tensions are
already rising in the Bering Sea, especially over the pollock fishery
that straddles the U.S. and Russian border.]{.underline}

Alaska's pollock fishery, valued at nearly US\$2 billion annually and
providing nearly 30,000 U.S. jobs, is facing pressure. [Without
proactive measures, the situation could worsen, potentially resulting in
fish wars in the Arctic.]{.underline}

A Stacked Solution Set

[To address this concerning trend, collaboration across sectors and with
a diverse set of partners is foundational.]{.underline} It is essential
to leverage science to better understand climate-driven fish migration
and its impacts. WWF-US is collaborating with the world's top science,
research, and data partners to offer predictive analytics for early
warning, strategic planning, and preventative solutions. Partners
include the Environmental Defense Fund, HUB Ocean, the International
Caucus Foundation, and Ode partners.

Local leadership and adequate resources are also key to successful
solutions. WWF is developing projects in the U.S. Arctic under the
Marine Cultural Heritage Zones initiative, including the recently
announced Arctic Community Wildlife Grants program, with a focus on
locally-led efforts.

The seafood industry, and those who finance and insure them, must be
part of the solution. [This necessitates the development of
climate-smart fisheries solutions, the integration of blue food security
across development and other sectors, and the advancement of innovative
technologies for fisheries, including improved
traceability.]{.underline}

[Effective multilateral cooperation in the Arctic is critical,
including, improving fish stocks, reducing illegal, unreported, and
unregulated (IUU) fishing]{.underline}, and ultimately mitigating the
potential for conflict. Environmental peacebuilding can also play a role
in facilitating cooperation, utilizing the factors that drive fisheries
conflict for positive outcomes. For example, despite heightened tensions
due to the war in Ukraine, Norway and Russia reached an agreement on
fishing quotas for 2023 in the Barents Sea. Cooperation must continue
albeit in difficult geopolitical times.

Fisheries management negotiations can enable peaceful collaboration and
diplomacy in the right circumstances[. In the Arctic, this could include
proactive protection of the marine environment, development of fisheries
management programs that are informed by and adjust to ecosystem change,
and protection of food and job security in subsistence fishing
communities. For example, negotiations in the Central Arctic Ocean
Fisheries agreement, a legally binding instrument, present an
opportunity.]{.underline} Monitoring and mitigation measures are
currently in development; the proposed exploratory fishing should have
an independent review of the plans and data that result from them,
timely and complete reporting, and independent international observers
on board.

New Partnerships and Capacities are Needed

[The United States Congress has recognized IUU fishing as a national
security challenge due to its economic and national security
implications. Several U.S. government agencies, including the U.S.
Department of State, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, and the U.S. Coast Guard, among other agencies
throughout the U.S. governmen]{.underline}t, are working with
international partners to address this challenge.

[One immediate step to boost the efforts would be for the U.S. Congress
to provide funding for existing laws, such as the Maritime SAFE Act
adopted in 2019.]{.underline}

Addressing IUU fishing requires more than diplomatic and economic
efforts. The U.S. Coast Guard has identified crime and conflict related
to fisheries as the most urgent global maritime security challenge,
surpassing piracy. [To combat this maritime threat, the U.S. military,
in collaboration with international partners, should include countering
IUU fishing and crime as one of its authorized mission sets, including
expanding ship ride agreements for the U.S. Coast Guard. This would
enable capacity building and cooperation in the Arctic and
globally.]{.underline}

These efforts, along with conservation, diplomatic, and economic
initiatives, would have a normative deterrence impact on IUU fishing,
improve our understanding of illegal fishing activities, and help
prevent threats to the United States and global stability.

## Grid 

### 1NC\-\--Grid

#### The United State federal government should 

#### \-\--invest in renewable technology transmission across the grid; 

#### \-\--invest in long-term battery storage;

#### \-\--implement AI into renewable technology and grid. 

#### Solves for the grid. 

(United States Joint Economic Committee) **USJEC 24**, 1-18-2024, \"How
Renewable Energy Can Make the Power Grid More Reliable and Address Risks
to Electricity Infrastructure\", Joint Economic Committe,
https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/democrats/2024/1/how-renewable-energy-can-make-the-power-grid-more-reliable-and-address-risks-to-electricity-infrastructure

[Renewables are making vital contributions to the resilience of the
grid.]{.underline}

As extreme weather strains the grid and demand grows, [renewable sources
of energy are already playing a significant role in building grid
resilience]{.underline}. The Energy Information Administration projects
that renewable generation will supply nearly half of all electricity by
2050. [Already, over 1,300 gigawatts (GW) of clean electricity
generation and storage capacity are seeking interconnection to the
grid]{.underline}---enough to supply 80% of the United States'
electricity[. Thankfully, the evidence to date shows that the growing
clean power sector is also well-positioned to deal with extreme weather
events.]{.underline}

Around the country[, wind turbines, solar energy, and batteries often
buttress the grid when extreme heat or other weather events tax it the
most]{.underline}. During summer heat waves, when energy demand is
generally at its peak, renewable energy sources can stay online and keep
energy costs down for families. [High solar generation is often
correlated with peak summer loads when air conditioning units are in
heavy use. In May of 2023, solar and energy storage stepped in while 10
gigawatts of power from coal and nuclear plants]{.underline} were
offline in Texas because of heat-related failures. Grid operators from
North Dakota to Oklahoma to California set records for solar and other
renewable energy generation this summer, helping the grid power through
hot summer days. With regard to extreme cold-weather events, a Stanford
study showed that higher wind generation was correlated to the coldest
weather events, which provided additional electrical capacity for
heating needs. In general, wind and solar energy generation were found
to be complementary to each other---wind generation was generally higher
when solar generation was lower and vice versa.

A report by Energy Innovation, a [non-partisan energy and climate policy
think tank, found that "fossil-intensive grids cannot provide consistent
resilience against climate risks they are simultaneously
exacerbating.]{.underline}" Texas' Big Freeze in February 2021 is a
clear example of how f[ossil fuel electricity grids cannot withstand
climate risks. When unseasonably cold weather knocked out power
infrastructure and led energy demand to exceed available fossil fuel
energy supply]{.underline}, the resulting mass power outages led to
nearly 250 deaths. As Texas' energy grid is isolated as a matter of
policy, surrounding energy providers were unable to transfer energy to
the strained grid. Greater interconnection between regional grids allows
for more flexibility, especially in the face of extreme weather events.
This tragic example of how extreme weather can disproportionately target
fossil-fuel energy production highlights the risks to Americans' health
and well-being from an insecure power grid.

[Solar and wind energy have proven to work well in tandem, even during
extreme weather events, as solar provides energy during the day and wind
provides energy in the evening and at night, reducing intermittency
issues. Increasing battery storage capacity further mitigates
intermittency issues and increases overall flexibility and resilience.
Energy storage is already playing an important role in smoothing out
energy supply in states that have invested in large-scale
batteries.]{.underline}

Congress has taken great steps to undergird the grid, but more work
needs to be done.

Congress and the Biden administration have taken important steps to
ensure that appropriate regulation and ample funding exist to boost
renewable electricity production. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)
supercharged investments in utility-scale solar projects, wind power,
and energy storage. For individuals and families, IRA's Residential
Clean Energy Credit provides a credit for local investment in solar,
wind, geothermal, and energy storage that can complement broader grid
modernization. The DOE has also announced \$1.3 billion in funding from
the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to further develop interstate
transmission lines. [A portion of this funding will go to the Southline
Transmission Project, which connects New Mexico and Arizona grids,
enabling substantial renewable energy development opportunities and
creating new jobs in New Mexico and Arizona.]{.underline} In June 2023,
the [Department of the Interior proposed a rule making it easier for the
development of wind and solar energy projects on public lands. Further
investments in research and development of emerging long duration energy
storage technologies, such as iron-air and thermal batteries, could help
decarbonize the industrial sector, which consumes a third of the energy
produced in the United States.]{.underline}

[Though federal agencies have taken steps to facilitate permitting,
significant barriers still exist]{.underline}. Chairman Heinrich has
introduced the FASTER Act to improve upon existing transmission siting
and permitting practices without compromising environmental standards.
Legislation introduced by Senator Hickenlooper is designed to provide
flexibility and capacity sharing between grid operators across the
country. And various firms are deciding to nearshore supply
chains---bringing manufacturing processes closer to home---to avoid
snarls from extreme weather events and geopolitical crises.

Extreme weather events, which have increased in severity and frequency,
pose a significant challenge to the electrical grid and the U.S.
economy. Advanced [technologies like AI promise to play an important
role in managing increased energy demands, but they also create
vulnerabilities. Investments by Congress and the Biden administration in
renewables, grid enhancing technologies, and security protocols help
strengthen the electricity grid, secure energy infrastructure, and
protect Americans from the costs associated with extreme weather
events.]{.underline}

## Japan Proliferation

Center\", Stimson Center,

07-24-25 // AA

Japan's Nuclear Conundrum [Japan's nuclear policy, formed in the 1960s,
is anchored on four fundamental pillars]{.underline} that continue to
shape its approach to this day, as outlined by then-Prime Minister
Eisaku Sato. [First, Japan has adopted and upheld the Three Non-Nuclear
Principles, in which Japan pledged non-possession, non-production, and
non-introduction of nuclear weapons; second, in diplomacy, Japan has
advocated for nuclear disarmament through efforts to maintain the
nuclear non-proliferation regime based on the Treaty on the
Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT); third, Japan has depended on
the U.S. extended nuclear deterrence as an integral part of its security
against threats from the periphery; and fourth, the research,
development, and use of nuclear energy are limited to peaceful purposes
per the Atomic Energy Basic Act]{.underline}. These four pillars of
nuclear policy have been shaped by three key factors: the traumatic
experience of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the
security threats from neighboring nuclear powers, and energy security
concerns, as Japan's dependence on foreign energy supplies exceeds 90%,
leading it to choose the path of utilization of nuclear energy and
nuclear fuel cycle. As a result of this policy, Japan faces two nuclear
dilemmas. The first dilemma is that, w[hile promoting policies that
strongly support nuclear nonproliferation and nuclear disarmament, Japan
has pursued the nuclear fuel cycle]{.underline} to improve its energy
security, which has led other countries to view Japan as a proliferation
risk itself. [The second dilemma is that while promoting nuclear
disarmament and the realization of the ideal of a "world without nuclear
weapons," Japan relies on the extended nuclear deterrence provided by
the United States to deal with threats to its own security.]{.underline}
Since February 2022, when the Russian invasion of Ukraine began, [there
has been a lively discussion in Japan about the need to pursue "nuclear
sharing" with the United States.]{.underline} According to an opinion
poll jointly conducted by Sankei Shimbun and Fuji News Network in March
2022 indicated that nearly 85% of respondents expressed support for
discussing (not seeking) nuclear sharing. [Even though this results need
to be taken with a grain of salt given that the poll was conducted by
comparatively conservative news outlets, the result nonetheless suggests
that doubts about the credibility of extended U.S. nuclear deterrence
have increased.]{.underline} [At the same time, it also indicates that
the Japanese public is demanding a stronger commitment to the U.S.-Japan
alliance in the face of growing nuclear risks, as China and North Korea
rapidly increase their nuclear capabilities]{.underline}. On the other
hand, Japanese public opinion toward nuclear disarmament remains strong,
even as the strategic environment deteriorates with increasing nuclear
risks. In an online survey conducted in January 2023 (report
forthcoming), 70% support the idea of promoting nuclear disarmament, and
70% support Japan joining the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear
Weapons (TPNW), although the timing of this support varies. While the
Japanese government shares the ultimate goal of the TPNW, it has not
joined the treaty and has not even participated as an observer in
meetings of the parties to the TPNW, citing the lack of participation by
nuclear-weapon states. If Japan were to join the TPNW, it would result
in foregoing extended nuclear deterrence from the United States. Even if
the alliance were to survive under such circumstances, the means for the
United States to exercise its right of collective self-defense would be
severely constrained because the United States would be legally unable
to retaliate with nuclear weapons on behalf of Japan, which could
further risk its own forces and nation. [Another possible divide in the
alliance, which could arise from Japan's participation as an observer in
TPNW meetings, may be that Japan, as it continues to pursue a
nuclear-free world, may find itself in conflict between its desire to
advocate nuclear disarmament and its eagerness to strengthen its
alliance with the United States.]{.underline} As Tokyo's alliance with
Washington gets closer as the cooperation between Japan's Self-Defense
Force and the U.S. military deepens, [it becomes more difficult for
Tokyo to explain how it can advocate for a nuclear-free world on one
hand while continuing to rely on U.S. extended nuclear deterrence for
its own security on the other. For the Japanese public, however, the
psychological hurdle to the use of nuclear weapons is high. For example,
according to the aforementioned online survey, approximately half of
respondents expect the U.S. to retaliate with conventional forces in the
event of an attack on Japan]{.underline}, with nuclear retaliation being
the third choice after non-military supportive means. In other words,
while they are hesitant about the actual use of nuclear weapons, they
recognize the necessity of nuclear weapons for deterrence.

## Miscalc

### 1NC -- AI

**The United States Federal Government should**

**\-\--implement AI into NC3 systems;**

**\-\--adopt a nuclear policy to increase decision-making time.**

#### AI solves -- it provides best information and avoids human emotions

**Rautenbach 22** \[Peter Rautenbach; a summer research fellow with the
Cambridge Existential Risk Initiative, received a master of science
degree in international relations from the London School of Economics
and Political Science, where he studied the impact of emerging
technology on nuclear deterrence; September 2022; \"On Integrating
Artificial Intelligence With Nuclear Control\"; No Publication;

Accessed 7-24-2025\]

Although automation and basic artificial intelligence (AI) have been a
part of nuclear weapons systems for decades,1 [the integration of modern
AI machine learning programs with nuclear command, control, and
communications (NC3) systems could mitigate human error or bias in
nuclear decision-making.]{.underline} In doing so, AI could help
[prevent egregious errors from being made in crisis scenarios when
nuclear risk is greatest]{.underline}. Even so, AI comes with its own
set of unique limitations; if unaddressed, they could raise the chance
of nuclear use in the most dangerous manner possible: subtly and without
warning.

With Russia's recent invasion of Ukraine and the resultant new low in
Russian-U.S. relations, the threat of nuclear war is again at the
forefront of international discussion. [To help prevent]{.underline}
this conflict from devolving into a devastating [use of nuclear weapons,
AI systems could be used to assess enormous amounts of intelligence data
exponentially faster than a human analyst and without many of the less
favorable aspects of human decision-making, such as bias, anger, fear,
and prejudice]{.underline}. In doing so, these systems would be
providing decision-makers with the [best possible information for use in
a crisis]{.underline}.

China, Russia, and the United States are increasingly accepting the
benefits of this kind of AI integration and feeling competitive
pressures to operationalize it in their respective military systems.2
Although public or open-source statements on how this would occur within
their nuclear programs is sparse, the classic example of the Perimeter,
or "Dead Hand," system established in the Soviet Union during the Cold
War and still in use in Russia points to high levels of automation
within nuclear systems.

In the United States, there is a desire to modernize the aging NC3
system.3 As the 2018 U.S. Nuclear Posture Review stated, "The United
States will continue to adapt new technologies for information display
and data analysis to improve support for Presidential decision making
and senior leadership consultations."4 There is no direct mention of AI,
but this statement is in line with how AI integration with NC3 systems
could take shape. [Given competitive drivers, the desire for
modernization, and the general growth of AI technology, exploring the
ramifications of nuclear integration is rising in
importance.]{.underline}

#### The nuclear policy solves downsides of AI

**Rautenbach 22** \[Peter Rautenbach; a summer research fellow with the
Cambridge Existential Risk Initiative, received a master of science
degree in international relations from the London School of Economics
and Political Science, where he studied the impact of emerging
technology on nuclear deterrence; September 2022; \"On Integrating

https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2022-09/features/integrating-artificial-intelligence-nuclear-control;
Accessed 7-24-2025\]

[A Policy Answer for a Technical Problem]{.underline}

Despite such concerns, it is likely that the integration of AI within
the NC3 structure in the United States and other countries will
continue. Crucially, states and militaries do not want to fall behind
their competitors in the AI race.23 [Furthermore, the potential benefits
of this integration stand to stabilize many aspects of the nuclear
command system.]{.underline}

Although technical solutions may be developed to lessen the impact of
these limitations, the sheer complexity of AI machines and the pressure
to integrate them with military systems mean that these problems must be
addressed now. The heavy incentive for states to start incorporating the
technology as soon as possible means they may have to deal with
imperfect systems playing critical roles in nuclear command. In the end,
however, [the real problem is not the AI per se, but that a rushed
integration of AI with nuclear systems that does not take into
consideration that the technical limitations of current AI
technology]{.underline} and the complexity of nuclear security could
increase the risk of nuclear use.

Approaching this challenge from a policy standpoint could [mitigate the
risks posed by this integration]{.underline}. Specifically, that would
mean [adopting a nuclear policy that expands the decision-making time
for launching a nuclear weapon]{.underline}, such as by moving away from
launch-on-warning strategies or by "de-alerting" silo-based
intercontinental ballistic missiles. [By increasing the amount of time
to ready nuclear weapons for use, these policies could allow more
opportunity for leaders to assess the nuclear security-related
information being provided by the AI.]{.underline} Even if policy is not
changed, the simple understanding that these limitations exist could
lead to higher levels of training and a healthy degree of skepticism
among the people who operate and employ these

AI systems.

[AI has the potential to drastically improve safety and lower the chance
of nuclear use if integrated with NC3 systems.]{.underline} It is
essential that governments approach this integration with open eyes and
acknowledge that the AI part of the loop is not always or even
fundamentally better in its judgment when compared to its human
counterparts. This understanding will be key to harnessing AI
successfully in pursuit of a safer future.

#### 

WASHINGTON --- Two new reports from the National Academies of Sciences,
Engineering, and Medicine review the adequacy of U[.S. strategies to
prevent, counter, and respond to the threat of nuclear and chemical
terrorism and highlight the strengths and limitations of U.S. efforts to
prevent and counter threats from weapons of mass destruction
(WMD]{.underline}), particularly in a changing terrorism threat
landscape. The reports provide recommendations for government leadership
and interagency partners to better coordinate and communicate across
counterterrorism efforts and to support prevention, countermeasure,
response, and recovery programs.

Authorized through a congressional mandate in the FY2021 National
Defense Authorization Act, [the National Academies reports examine the
adequacy of U.S. strategies and capabilities for addressing
state-sponsored and nonstate actors acquiring or misusing technologies
and materials (including dual-use), and whether terrorist organizations
can gain access to the critical expertise needed to carry out WMD
attacks.]{.underline}

Both reports highlight the need for the [U.S. to look beyond a focus on
international terrorist organizations]{.underline}, as the lines among
domestic, foreign, nonstate, and state-supported terrorist groups have
become increasingly blurred. [Facilities storing nuclear materials or
toxic industrial chemicals will remain potential targets for terrorism
and insider threats]{.underline}, and the potential radicalization of
individuals at those facilities requires the strengthening of insider
threat programs.

Nuclear Threats

Nuclear Terrorism: Assessment of U.S. Strategies to Prevent, Counter,
and Respond to Weapons of Mass Destruction concludes that overall, [U.S.
efforts to counter nuclear or radiological terrorism will need renewed
focus and increased investments to keep pace with the evolving threat
landscape. Efforts to manage this risk should be expanded in a way that
can be sustained by the many federal agencies that each have unique
competencies and capabilities]{.underline}. [The report recommends that
the U.S. government reenergize the post 9/11 effort to combat terrorism
through ongoing deep collaboration and coordination across the nuclear
security community]{.underline}, with relevant domestic agencies, and
with international partners.

The committee that wrote the report does not foresee an imminent
terrorist attack with a nuclear weapon; however, several factors point
to an increasing risk of such an attack. [The trends of the past years
show that domestic and international terrorist organizations are
becoming more closely linked and difficult to
differentiate]{.underline}. With added global interest in and expansion
of the civil nuclear sector, as well as the decline of U.S. leadership
in the civil nuclear space, [the potential for these organizations to
access nuclear material is increasing. In addition, preventing smuggled
materials from entering the U.S. is challenged by ongoing supply chain
security and border management issues.]{.underline}

["For decades the U.S. has played an indispensable role in mobilizing
and sustaining global efforts to advance nuclear security]{.underline},"
said Stephen Flynn, professor of political science and founding director
of the Global Resilience Institute at Northeastern University, and
co-chair of the committee that wrote the nuclear threats report. "[The
U.S. must continue to lead, build trust, and strengthen the post- 9/11
domestic and international programs that have played an invaluable role
in successfully managing the nuclear terrorism threat to
date."]{.underline}

The report recommends that federal agencies evaluate whether the
national security community has sufficient resources to manage and
respond to the nuclear terrorism risk given that federal policy and
funding have recently moved toward a greater focus on "great power
competition" with Russia and China, which are increasingly challenging
long-standing U.S.-led security arrangements in Europe and Asia.

[In addition, federal agencies should determine whether national
anti-government and terrorist groups operating in the U.S. should be
included on the list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations.]{.underline}
The committee noted that as terrorist organizations are becoming more
transnational, the distinction between foreign and domestic has blurred
in some cases. Adding the domestic groups to the registry of foreign
terrorists with which they have ties would make it illegal to join or
financially support these domestic terrorist groups.

The report calls for a governmentwide effort, [in partnership with the
civil nuclear sector, to strengthen U.S. leadership in civil nuclear
energy commerce and enhance global standards for safety]{.underline},
security, and materials control, including leading an international
effort to enhance security in transportation and cargo. [The report also
provides recommendations for federal agencies, such as the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, to work closely with leaders at the state
and local levels to reinvigorate nuclear incident response and recovery
capabilities.]{.underline}

The report highlights how climate change mitigation efforts have
intersected with different aspects of nuclear security. As the U.S. and
other countries adapt to meet goals around carbon neutrality, nuclear
material is likely become more dispersed, requiring more expansive
international security measures.

[Beijing has expressed strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition after
the United States House of Representatives passed a bill that will grant
military aid to Taiwan and countries in the Indo-Pacific
region.]{.underline} The US House on April 20 passed four bills in a
[US\$95 billion package to boost the defense ability of Ukraine, Israel
and Taiwan]{.underline}. About \$60.84 billion of funding will be
earmarked for Ukraine to counter Russia while \$26.38 bill be used to
support Israel to defend itself against Iran and its proxies. One of the
bills consists of [\$8.12 billion for Taiwan and Indo-Pacific countries
to "counter communist China and ensure strong deterrence in the
region."]{.underline} The aid includes: [a \$3.3 billion funding to
develop submarine infrastructure, including investments in dry dock
construction; \$2 billion in a foreign military financing program for
Taiwan and other key allies and security partners in the Indo-Pacific
confronting Chinese aggression; and \$1.9 billion to replenish defense
articles and defense services provided to Taiwan and regional
partners.]{.underline} The remaining \$920 million will be spent on
strengthening US military capabilities in the region, enhancing the
production and development of artillery and critical munitions and
providing additional flexibility for Foreign Military Financing loans
and loan guarantees. Already, on February 8, the US Senate had passed
its own \$95 billion package to support Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, and
reports are that the Senate will now accept the House version and the
package will soon be submitted to US President Joe Biden for approval,
whereupon it will become law. "[The US insists on passing and signing a
bill containing negative content related to Taiwan, seriously
interfering in China's internal affairs and seriously violating the
one-China principle and the provisions of the three Sino-US joint
communiques," Chen Binhua, spokesman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of
the State Council, said Monday. "We express strong dissatisfaction and
firm opposition to this."]{.underline} Chen also said the Democratic
Progressive Party, the ruling party in Taiwan, is trying to rely on the
US and use force to seek independence but such an attempt is doomed to
failure. "[By providing military aid to Taiwan, the US is trying to stir
up a crisis and confrontation in the Taiwan Strait and related region,"
Li Haidong]{.underline}, a professor at the Institute of International
Relations of China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times in
an interview. "The US will then use the chaos and conflicts it creates
to make countries in East Asia and Western Pacific regions lean to its
side and form an alliance." Li said such a move will lead to division in
the Asia Pacific region, undermine the important foundation for the
stability of Sino-US relations and seriously damage the existing order
and security environment for shared prosperity in the Asia-Pacific
region. US commitment [The Taipei government and local media were
cheered by the newly-approved US military aid. Taiwanese President Tsai
Ing-wen thanked the US Congress for approving it.]{.underline} Taiwanese
Premier Chen Chien-jen said Monday that a peaceful and stable Taiwan
Strait is important to peace and prosperity in the world. He said Taiwan
will continue to work with like-minded countries, including the US and
all countries in the free democratic camp, to safeguard peace and
freedom in the Indo-Pacific region and make the Taiwan Strait area more
stable. The approval of the military aid for Taiwan reaffirmed
Washington's "rock-solid" commitment to helping the island defend
itself, especially when this year marks the 45th anniversary of the
passage of the US-Taiwan Relations Act, said Anny Hsiao, executive
director of the Formosan Association for Public Affairs (FAPA), a
Washington-based organization of Taiwanese Americans. [She said the US
should give up its "strategic ambiguity" on the China-Taiwan matter and
adopt "strategic clarity."]{.underline} For several decades, [Washington
has remained ambiguous about whether it will provide military support to
Taiwan if the island is attacked by mainland China. Last year, Biden
said on several occasions that the US will support Taiwan if a war
breaks out in the Taiwan Strait.]{.underline} 'Salami tactics' Xie Feng,
Chinese Ambassador to the US, delivered a speech on April 20 at the
opening ceremony of the Harvard Kennedy School China Conference 2024.
[He warned the US of the consequences of interfering with China's
internal affairs and damaging China's interests on issues related to
Taiwan, Hong Kong, Xinjiang, Xizang (Tibet) and the South China Sea.
"Applying salami tactics and crossing red lines on issues bearing on
others' core interests is just like racing cars on a cliff's edge, where
a crash is almost inevitable," he said.]{.underline} "The Taiwan
question is the most important and sensitive issue in China-US
relations. The so-called 'Taiwan independence' is a dead end, and the
one-China principle is a red line not to be crossed," he said. [He added
that it's natural for the US and China to have differences but it's also
important for both sides to properly manage their differences and
respect each other's core interests and major concerns.]{.underline}
Meanwhile, US State Secretary Antony Blinken is set to visit Beijing
from Wednesday to Friday, invited by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. A
senior US State Department official told the media that Blinken during
his China trip will convey Washington's deep concerns" over China's aid
for Russia's defense industrial base.

accessed 07-24-25 // AA

[The United States stands at a pivotal moment in the global
technological race]{.underline}, facing an increasingly assertive China
that leverages state-backed investments to dominate key industries.
[From artificial intelligence (AI) and quantum computing to
semiconductors and space technologies, the stakes go beyond economic
competition]{.underline}---a contest for information dominance resulting
in strategic and national security superiority. To maintain global
technological dominance and safeguard national security, the U.S. must
implement aggressive policies focused on innovation-driven investment,
cybersecurity fortification, and scalable infrastructure modernization
to outpace China's state-backed advancements. [Innovation-driven
Investment]{.underline} At the core of American technological leadership
is its capacity for innovation. Unlike China's state-controlled
approach, the [U.S. thrives on a dynamic ecosystem of private-sector
ingenuity, academic research, and government collaboration. However, to
sustain this edge, Washington must commit to bold investments in
foundational technologies and establish policies reinforcing the
country's role as a global technology leader. The U.S. cannot afford to
fall behind in foundational technologies such as quantum computing, AI,
advanced semiconductors, and space infrastructure. China has made
significant strides, notably with its Jiuzhang quantum computer, which
has surpassed classical supercomputers, and DeepSeek, an AI model that
rivals the most advanced generative AI systems. Without targeted federal
funding and incentives for private-sector research, the U.S. risks
losing leadership in these transformative fields. Federal investment
must focus on developing secure, scalable AI infrastructure and quantum
technologies to maintain an edge in next-generation computing. Space
technology is another crucial domain]{.underline}, serving as the
backbone for secure communications, navigation, resource mining, and
future space-based economies. China's expansion of its BeiDou [satellite
network and its lunar ambitions signal a clear bid for space dominance.
The U.S. must reinforce investments in satellite communications,
deep-space exploration, and space-based defense systems to counter
this.]{.underline} Establishing space as a recognized critical
infrastructure sector will ensure sustained funding and security to
maintain leadership in this field. [Workforce development is a critical
driver of innovation. China's substantial investment in STEM
education---producing more engineers annually than the U.S.---directly
challenges American technological leadership. To remain competitive,
U.S. education policy must proactively emphasize AI, cybersecurity, and
quantum computing across K-12 and higher education]{.underline},
ensuring a robust pipeline of skilled professionals. With approximately
300 million K-12 students in China compared to around 50 million in the
U.S., sheer numbers alone provide China with a significant
advantage---assuming education quality and standards are equal, which
they are not.

[Concrete cooperation in the following]{.underline} five [areas could
yield transformative results for the bilateral relationship in the
decades to come.]{.underline} Invest in jobs and economic opportunities
India and the United States must build an economic relationship that
creates jobs and opportunities for the people of both nations. The
United States and India must look not just at areas like high-tech, but
also at infrastructure, to expand the benefits of investment and trade
to all sectors of societies. The two nations cannot divorce the future
of the bilateral economic relationship from what each country does at
home. Both India and the United States must invest in the building
blocks of their own economies and middle classes---including health care
and education---and continue to innovate new domestic policy solutions
if they are to benefit from the bilateral economic relationship.
Recommendations Make infrastructure a key shared area of focus by
holding summits to educate institutional investors about the Indian
infrastructure market, and hosting conferences and exchanges to share
lessons about developing digital infrastructure. The United States
should also continue to help Indian cities develop their municipal bond
markets. Expand the United States-India Science & Technology Endowment
Fund (USISTEF). Start a Future of Work dialogue to refine policy
solutions that leverage the changing nature of work to create stable,
well-paying jobs and empower citizens. Build out Blue Economies by
developing web portals and co-hosting the Our Ocean conference. India
should also sign and ratify the Port State Measures Agreement and the
United States should support India's implementation of it. Encourage
federal governments and major cities and states in both countries to
create offices of international affairs to facilitate subnational
cooperation and share lessons learned. Build a clean energy future from
the bottom up As two of the world's three largest emitters of greenhouse
gases, and with intense and growing energy needs, both countries must
take concrete action to develop clean energy solutions that can boost
economic growth and prevent the worst effects of climate change. The
best way to achieve these dual goals is to invest in the infrastructure
of a clean energy future, and start from the bottom up by cooperating on
technical assistance, innovation, and capital investment in the building
blocks of energy access, such as grid modernization, energy efficiency,
and renewable technologies. Recommendations Enhance cooperation on grid
planning through regulatory cooperation and intergovernmental talks.
Enhance energy efficiency by bringing together government and private
sector experts to boost the capacity of India's Energy Efficiency
Services Limited and share lessons learned. Facilitate investments in
clean energy by hosting annual investment forums that bring together
institutional investors and clean energy sector representatives along
with government experts and regulators. De-risk investments by
developing risk-offsetting mechanisms and standardized power purchase
agreements. Continue and expand the Partnership to Advance Clean Energy
(PACE), which hosts dialogues and co-funds work in the areas of energy
research, deployment, and access. Expand the Joint Clean Energy Research
and Development Centers (JCERDC), which are four research centers with
scientific and economic merit that conduct work related to clean energy
innovation. The United States should remain party to the Paris Climate
Agreement. Cooperate in the International Solar Alliance (ISA), which
gives both countries the opportunity to jointly and profitably invest in
the energy infrastructure of several other countries. The United States
should become a full member of the ISA. Cooperate on climate modeling by
continuing U.S. programs that give technical assistance to Indian
agencies. [Create a U.S.-India security advantage in the
Indo-Pacific]{.underline} In the coming decades, the United States and
India will face difficult challenges to peace and stability in the
Indo-Pacific region. To address these emerging threats, the United
States and India must invest in greater coordinated capacity to
contribute to security in the Indo-Pacific and beyond. This requires
long-term commitments by both sides. [The United States should build on
the designation of India as a Major Defense Partner to craft a Strategic
Advantage Initiative in which the United States adopts a presumption of
support for defense cooperation with India and specific policies to make
good on this support;]{.underline} and India must take steps to make
that level of defense cooperation possible, while sharing the burden [on
security issues, such as maritime security in the Indian Ocean,
humanitarian assistance, and disaster relief. Recommendations As part of
the Major Defense Partner designation, the United States should launch a
government wide Strategic Advantage Initiative focused on developing New
Delhi's defense capabilities as a premier security contributor in the
Indo-Pacific and to ensure India has the capabilities to prevail in
contested domains. Create a U.S.-India Indo-Pacific Humanitarian
Assistance Disaster Relief (HADR) cell to plan, train for, and undertake
joint humanitarian assistance and disaster relief missions in the Indian
Ocean region.]{.underline} Indian leaders need to make a strong public
case for a more efficient, transparent, and effective defense
procurement process. India should finalize, in consultation with the
United States, [a joint defense implementation agreement]{.underline}
that [facilitates information sharing, interoperability, and technology
transfers within the two countries' comfort zones. Strengthen democratic
institutions at home and around the world]{.underline} The United States
and India, as the world's two largest democracies, each have a special
role and responsibility to live up to their founding democratic
principles. That shared effort, with all the failures and successes
implied, underwrites the bet they make on a shared future. As they work
on issues related to the internet, free speech, government transparency,
and more, the United States and India should learn lessons from one
another to strengthen democratic institutions. [They should also work
together in multilateral organizations such as the Community of
Democracies and the Open Government Partnership to share that knowledge
with other democracies and governments in transition that want support
Recommendations Start a U.S.-India track 1.5 dialogue on democracy and
technology to discuss internet governance, the impact of social media on
democracy, and the intersection of big data and privacy. Work closely
together in the Community of Democracies by co-chairing the Working
Group on Education for Democracy to produce training content and
educational materials related to best practices in democracy. Work
together to promote transparent government through the Open Government
Partnership (OGP),]{.underline} which India should join. Strengthen ties
between Indians and Americans The backbone of the U.S.-India
relationship, now and in the years to come, will be the ties between our
peoples, who drive the opportunities in business, innovation, education
and beyond. In particular, the United States and India should expand
educational, cultural, and professional exchanges and cooperation. These
exchanges will spark untold areas of bilateral cooperation in the
future. Recommendations The United States should facilitate market
conditions that incentivize more cultural and educational exchange
programs. The United States should transform the Passport to India
program into a U.S.-India Strong Foundation to increase the number of
Americans studying in India, and it should establish a J-1 visa category
for India to increase the number of Indians coming to the United States.
India should strengthen its higher education system to educate India's
next generation and emerge as a global education center, including by
developing a community college system and easing regulations to enable
more Americans and others to study in India.

[The Indian government's decision to endorse a multistakeholder approach
signals its willingness to engage U.S.-centric rules and institutions in
cyberspace. It is not born out of domestic compulsion. While
consultative processes to frame Internet policies in India leave room
for improvement, there is little appreciable demand for a
multistakeholder model at home. India's position, therefore, appears to
be strategic, hinting that the United States could have a valuable
partner at hand: a democracy that is willing to lend legitimacy to U.S.
leadership in cyberspace, provided there is no capture or control of
critical Internet infrastructure by businesses or governments. The
Buenos Aires announcement opens the door for India and the United States
to begin constructive dialogue---especially at the Track 1.5 level---on
cybersecurity, data protection and a mutually negotiated regime on
intermediary liability.]{.underline} The Narendra Modi government is on
strong footing at home, but its cyber politics will likely be influenced
by developments abroad. Revelations of U.S. surveillance on foreign
governments and political parties, and the final fate of the IANA
transition will be crucial. Just as significant will be the extent to
which multistakeholder processes accommodate emerging economies in the
development of technical standards and protocols, as well as commercial
policies relating to Top-Level Domains (TLDs). Indian negotiators are
sensitive to the Tunis Agenda's failure to fulfil its mandate, but it
remains an important political instrument that flags the digital divide
between developed and developing countries. The G77---in which India
plays a leading role---will continue to coalesce around the Tunis
Agenda. [The U.S. government should]{.underline} acknowledge this
reality, and [invest diplomatic capital towards making the December UN
high-level summit on the WSIS process a success. In the interim, both
countries would do well to pursue confidence building measures to
sustain engagement.]{.underline} India should articulate a coherent and
consistent line on its cyber politics that goes beyond the embrace of
labels. The Indian government must not only step up its interactions
with ICANN and the Internet Engineering Task Force in the policy
development process, but also nudge commercial and non-commercial
stakeholders in the country towards active participation. For its part,
[the U.S. government should eschew unilateral measures that undermine
its guardianship of Internet infrastructure.]{.underline} Prime Minister
Narendra Modi was critical of the United States' "unilateral sanctions"
against Russia, which include DNS restrictions in Crimea, though his
Russian host would have probably liked stronger words. Buffeted by
several political considerations, progress in the bilateral cyber
dialogue will be incremental. [India's recent assertions]{.underline}
nonetheless [indicate]{.underline}, perhaps for the first time, [its
intent to pursue serious and substantive Internet diplomacy with the
United States.]{.underline}

Combating what appears to some to be a wave of anti-democratic global
populism requires countries to fight back by supporting emerging and
transitioning democracies and working to reestablish democratic norms in
their own nations. [The partnership between the United States and India
can play an important role]{.underline} in this effort, [in particular
through multilateral organizations like the Community of Democracies and
the Open Government Partnership, both of which enable democracies to
work together to strengthen democratic institutions. In the Community of
Democracies -- of which the United States and India are both members --
we recommend that the two countries lead an effort to share best
practices for building democratic institutions, from a strong judiciary
to a free press, with transitioning democracies that are seeking just
this kind of assistance. Likewise, the two countries should work
together in the Open Government Partnership, which]{.underline} India
should join. The OGP [serves as a global platform for countries to
improve government transparency, and India and the United States could
share their unique experiences and challenges in building transparent
executive branch agencies, creating national budgets and providing
information on government activities to the public.]{.underline}

Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. [Austin III rebuffed criticism from
lawmakers on April 30 that the F-35 program has proved too costly and
unreliable to serve as the viable backbone of America's and allies'
future fighter fleet.]{.underline} ["I would not categorize the F-35 as
a paperweight," Austin said in response to questioning from Rep. Matt
Gaetz (R-Fla.) during a House Armed Services Committee hearing on the
Department of Defense's fiscal 2025 budget.]{.underline} "It is one of
the best aircraft in the inventory." Concerns about [the F-35 program
have once more come to the fore recently following a Government
Accountability Office report that said sustainment costs for F-35 would
rise to over \$1.5 trillion over the program's life.]{.underline} The
F-35 Joint Program Office took issue with the title of that
report---"F-35 Sustainment: Costs Continue to Rise While Planned Use and
Availability Has Decreased"---[because it said a main driver of that
increase was a fleet that would be in service longer, rather than new
unforeseen issues, noting that the Department of Defense now plans to
fly the F-35 through 2088 instead of 2077.]{.underline} Indeed, [the GAO
report stated that a key "reason for the increase in cost estimates is
the extension of the service life of the aircraft." Overall, the JPO
said the report accurately highlighted known "affordability and
readiness challenges." Austin said he did not disagree with the findings
of the GAO report. Gaetz took particular issue with the F-35's
mission-capable rate, a point he previously raised with Secretary of the
Air Force Frank Kendall and Chief of Staff of the Air Force Gen. David
W. Allvin during an April 17 hearing]{.underline}. In response to Gaetz,
Kendall said the "operational availability" rate for Air Force F-35s is
55 percent, which he acknowledged was "not a good number." [But Kendall
and Allvin disputed that the program was "failing," as Gaetz
claimed]{.underline}. Asked on April 30 by Gaetz whether the F-35 was a
"failure," Austin also said it was not. "It's a complex airframe," said
Austin, who testified alongside Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Air Force Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr. and DOD comptroller Michael McCord[.
"There are a number of reasons why a platform could be not operational
at any one given time." A major criticism of the F-35 program is
contractor Lockheed Martin's control over the intellectual property
related to aircraft, the contractor's struggle with delivering aircraft
on time, and the massive cost of the program. Kendall---the former chief
Pentagon weapons buyer---has been a vocal critic of how the program was
originally envisaged years ago, and Allvin also noted those concerns
earlier this month.]{.underline}

Analyzing [China's]{.underline} understanding of global hegemony
requires understanding not only its current foreign policy practices but
also its thousands of years of [historical memory]{.underline} and the
[notion of civilization]{.underline}. China has historically been called
the "Middle Kingdom" (Zhōngguó), and this designation has
[carried]{.underline} with it not only [a geopolitical
claim]{.underline} but also a claim [of cultural
superiority]{.underline}. This claim was embodied in the [traditional
tributary system]{.underline} that [positioned the states]{.underline}
around China [in a hierarchical order]{.underline}, and it penetrated a
wide geography during the Ming and Qing dynasties. Today's
interpretations of China's rise are often evaluated only in the context
of the post-Cold War power vacuum, ignoring this historical continuity.
However, China's quest for hegemony is not only a modern power policy,
but also a civilization-centered reconstruction project rooted in
Confucian political philosophy.

In his work "The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers," Paul Kennedy argues
that [economic power]{.underline} is [decisive in the sustainability
of]{.underline} [military and political power]{.underline}. According to
Kennedy's analysis, the [collapse]{.underline} of great powers is often
[linked to]{.underline} "[imperial overstretch]{.underline}." It is
observed that China has established a strategic balance in this context.
It is trying to continue economic development not through military
expansion but through infrastructure diplomacy, debt policies and soft
power strategies. The [B]{.underline}elt and [R]{.underline}oad
[I]{.underline}nitiative (BRI) is the most visible manifestation of this
strategy. China aims to connect not only Asia but also a wide geography
from Africa to Europe with economic networks. As Kennedy emphasizes in
his thesis, [hegemony]{.underline} is [established]{.underline} not only
[through]{.underline} [military superiority]{.underline} but also
through control of production power [and logistics
networks]{.underline}. China's railway and port investments constitute
the infrastructure of this long-term plan.

Henry Kissinger argues in his work "World Order" that
[China]{.underline} has [historically aimed to establish its own
order]{.underline} by [influencing]{.underline} its [surroundings rather
than through conflict]{.underline}. According to Kissinger, it is
[possible to say]{.underline} that [China acts]{.underline} with the
logic of "weiqi" (围棋); this game, unlike the chess of the West, is
based on siege and long-term position gains. Just like in weiqi, China
aims to gain advantage by [gradually expanding]{.underline} its area and
[reducing]{.underline} the [opponent's capacity to move]{.underline}
rather than directly confronting each other. This strategy is [clearly
observed in the militarization of the islands in the S]{.underline}outh
[C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea, the [pressure policies on
Taiwan]{.underline}, and the economic relations it has established with
ASEAN countries.

China's vision of global hegemony has been clearly
[expressed]{.underline} not only [through]{.underline} strategic moves,
but also through [official documents and policy texts]{.underline}. The
19th Party Congress Report published in 2017 [set forth China's goal of
becoming a]{.underline} "modern [socialist strong country]{.underline}"
by 2049. This goal [forms the ideological basis for]{.underline} the
[transition from]{.underline} the [revolutionary
isolationism]{.underline} of the Mao era to the active global engagement
of the Xi Jinping era. The concept of "[Chinese-style
modernization]{.underline}," frequently cited in this document, claims
to offer an [alternative development model to]{.underline} the liberal
[norms of the West]{.underline}. China aims to [establish a new
hegemonic pattern]{.underline} not only for itself but also [for
developing countries]{.underline}. 8u
