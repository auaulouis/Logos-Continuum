#### The 1AC's capitalist exploration and development of the Arctic [ensures]{.underline} nuclear war and miscalculation through resource wars.

[\"[THE NEED of a]{.mark} constantly [expanding market]{.mark} for its
products [chases the]{.mark} [bourgeoisie over]{.mark} the entire
surface of [the globe]{.mark}]{.underline},\" Marx and Engels wrote in
the Communist Manifesto. \"[It must nestle everywhere, settle
everywhere**.\"**]{.underline}

[[The struggle for natural resources]{.underline}]{.mark}\--today,
energy resources particularly\--also [[forces]{.mark} [capitalists
to]{.mark} \"nestle everywhere, [settle
everywhere.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}

But [when we imagine the dynamics of global capitalism]{.underline} 160
years after the writing of the Manifesto, [we]{.underline} usually
[don\'t think of]{.underline} either [the North or South
Pole]{.underline}\--the Arctic and Antarctic\--as a particular site of
struggle.

Yet today [[a new scramble for control of]{.mark} the two [polar regions
is unfolding]{.mark}, with [consequences]{.mark} that [could further
hasten capitalism\'s destruction]{.mark} of the planet and also
[increase the likelihood that]{.mark} the economic [competition]{.mark}
between states will [spill over into military
competition]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The backdrop to the [renewed [interest in]{.mark} [asserting territorial
claims on the Arctic]{.mark} and Antarctic]{.underline} by states such
as Canada, the United States, Russia and the United Kingdom is that
global warming, and in particular the warming of oceans, [[is]{.mark}
[leading to accelerating erosion of the ice mass]{.mark}z at both
poles.]{.underline}

Rather than seeing this as a global crisis, as any person concerned for
the fate of the planet and humanity would, [the governments who have
land claims on the polar regions see this as a terrific
opportunity.]{.underline}

Why? Because [the [retreating ice shelves]{.mark} may [open up]{.mark}
new [territory for oil and natural gas exploration and]{.mark} may also
open easier [shipping routes]{.mark}]{.underline}, including perhaps the
long-sought Northwest Passage linking the Atlantic and Pacific.

In other words, the [harmful [effects of global warming]{.mark} may
[open opportunities for]{.mark} [further accelerating]{.mark} the
harmful effects of [global warming]{.mark}.]{.underline}

\"According to the U.S. Geological Survey, [up to a quarter of the
world\'s undiscovered oil and gas may lie beneath the polar seabed\--far
more than Saudi Arabia\'s total known reserves\--along with vast mineral
wealth,\"]{.underline} Oliver Burkeman wrote in Britain\'s Guardian.

As oil becomes harder to extract and produce cheaply[, forcing oil
companies and governments to go to more difficult political and
geographic terrain to find oil and natural gas, any potential new source
of oil is tantalizing, particularly if it is not controlled by
independent political powers]{.underline} such as Hugo Chávez in
Venezuela or Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran. [This]{.underline}\--and the
opening of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge\--is [what [\"energy
independence,\" the new mantra]{.mark} [of]{.mark} Democrats and
Republicans alike, really means.]{.underline}

[Damn [the consequences for people and the planet.]{.mark}]{.underline}

AND [AS overfishing leads to a crisis in the global fishing industry,
extending control over waters beyond a state\'s boundaries to monopolize
areas of the sea that were once off limits or shared international
waters, is also a newly important goal.]{.underline}

\"The 1982 United Nations [[Law of the Sea]{.mark}]{.underline}
convention [[provides a legal framework for]{.mark} [delineating
ownership]{.mark} and economic rights [but the U.S. has yet to ratify
it]{.mark},\"]{.underline} notes Barbara Yaffe of the Vancouver Sun.
\"In accordance with the convention, [circumpolar states are busily
mapping undersea turf to establish their own claims, as yet to be
adjudicated.\"]{.underline}

[\"Britain is preparing to stake a claim to nearly one million square
kilometres\"]{.underline} of the Antarctic, Jax Jacobsen of Red Pepper
magazine reports. Jacobsen notes that Chile and Argentina, seeking to
challenge UK claims related to Falkland Islands and South Georgia,
\"have even gone so far as to fly pregnant women down to their Antarctic
research bases to strengthen their land claims\" by having \"native
\'Antarctican\'\" citizens.

Meanwhile, Canada and Russia in particular have been stepping up
military operations and staking competing claims to the Arctic.

Canadian journalist Avi Lewis, host of a new program on Al-Jazeera
called Inside USA, says, \"[The Conservative government has dashed up to
stake a claim to the market opportunity afforded by melting
glaciers\--[the tragic realization of the]{.mark} original [colonial
dream for a Northwest]{.mark} passage]{.underline}. Stephen Harper has
been striking a nationalist posture of \'standing up to big brother\' on
Arctic sovereignty\--from shipping to resource extraction.\"

And, as Oliver Burkeman writes, \"[Russia,]{.underline} in the most
audacious move so far, [dispatched a nuclear-powered icebreaker and two
submersible craft to plant a Russian flag, housed in a titanium tube, on
the seabed directly beneath the North Pole. \'The Arctic is ours,\'
declared]{.underline} lead explorer Artur Chilingarov, thereby staking
[Moscow\']{.underline}s claim to 460,000 square miles of ocean floor,
more than five times the area of Britain. [Canada]{.underline},
apparently taken by surprise, [responded by pledging a major military
build-up in the north.\"]{.underline}

Unlike the Antarctic, [the Arctic is not a nuclear-free
zone]{.underline}. So [[the risk]{.mark} of the
[Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} (and perhaps eventually also the Antarctic)
[[becoming a site for nuclear weapons]{.mark} and the passage of nuclear
submarines, with the increased risk of nuclear accident or war, [is
serious]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Indigenous communities in the Arctic are likely to be
displaced]{.mark}]{.underline} by the new settlement concerned based on
extraction of the region\'s resources and with establishing a military
presence.

[S]{.mark}tates [initiates DSM]{.mark} in the Area [despite]{.mark} its
[failure to ratify]{.mark} UNCLOS and join the ISA (US CRS, 2023). This
**[angers China and Russia]{.mark}** (Interview 6, 2024), which increase
efforts to secure control of the industry.]{.underline} Due to limited
participation from youth, indigenous, and environmental groups, indirect
benefits of deep seabeds, such as ecosystem services, capacity building,
and knowledge sharing, are deemed too difficult to measure and are
ignored. Indigenous communities with intangible deep-sea cultural
heritage "don\'t have really a forum to make \[their\] voice\[s\] heard"
(Interview 5, 2024) and must tolerate the idea that their ancestors at
the seafloor will be "cut up by giant machines" (Interview 4, 2024).
[With environmental and social injustice, society\'s acceptance of
[**DSM diminishes and protests** at sea increase]{.mark} (IISD, 2024a).
**[Rising transnational conflicts]{.mark}** between private and public

[With insufficient environmental management, deep seabed [minerals
**rapidly deplete**]{.mark}. The industry progresses before non-invasive
mining technologies develop and **[without adequate
enforcement]{.mark}** of environmental regulations.]{.underline} Without
transnational cooperation, the ISA never develops a strategy for
ensuring compliance and leaves contractor behavior unmonitored (Pickens

plumes and changes to mineral substrates, **[disrupt

**habitat degradation** limit]{.mark} the [ocean\'s ability to
**regulate climate**]{.mark}**, sequester carbon, and recycle
nutrients** (Levin et al., 2016). Without sufficient research,
[**ecosystem degradation and species extinction** cause]{.mark}
unanticipated [disruptions]{.mark} to food chains. **[Fish stocks
deplete]{.mark}** as nutrient cycling dwindles, preventing bottom-up
sustenance of marine life (Jaeckel et al., 2023). This **[disrupts the

contributes to **[strains]{.mark} on [food

[Primary locations of seabed minerals, such as the CCZ, become barren,
[underwater]{.mark} wastelands **[overrun with machinery]{.mark}** after

2024).]{.underline} No energy resources are safeguarded for future
generations, nor are cultural heritage sites for indigenous and
disadvantaged communities (Arato et al., 2024). [Environmental benefits,
such as [biodiversity]{.mark} existence values [and]{.mark} other
[ecosystem]{.mark} services, are **[sacrificed for short-term financial

[Second, that while [the]{.mark}re is currently a [scramble for]{.mark}
mineral rights and access to the [seabed]{.mark} by transnational
[mining]{.mark} conglomerates [purportedly due to]{.mark} the global
shift toward "green" technologies, [the **oceanic turn in
capitalism**]{.mark} and scholarship seems [to **fulfill a desire for a
material and intellectual**]{.mark} (blue) "[spatial fix]{.mark}."
Consequently, [this]{.mark} spatial [fix]{.mark} is a **critical current
in the development** of a contemporary depth imagination, a vision
[derived from]{.mark} both **[creative and extractive
capital]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Critical ocean studies is an
interdisciplinary method of thinking with, engaging, and submerging into
the ontological, material, political, and cultural body of the largest
part of our biosphere. Its ontological concerns might be illuminated by
Gaston Bachelard's claim that "space, vast space, is the friend of
being."4 In recent years, the field has challenged the surface-based
readings of oceanic representation, has dived deeply into complex
multispecies entanglements, and has focused more pointedly on the logic
of capital and its flows as well as its concordant militarization, from
nuclear testing to the ways in which US naval forces "secure the volume"
for the transit of oil.5 Cold War politics have been critical to oceanic
thinking; the oceanic turn in humanities scholarship was largely a
response to the enclosure of the oceans through the Truman Proclamation
of 1945 and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea
(UNCLOS), a global conversation and debate about 99 percent of the
planet's biosphere.6

An oceanic current emerged in the 1990s at the peak of the new fields of
globalization and diaspora studies. The general approach from anglophone
scholars in History, Anthropology, and Cultural Studies such as James
Clifford, Marcus Rediker and Peter Linebaugh, and Paul Gilroy was to
think in terms of the fluidity and flow of migrants, refugees, pirates,
sailors, and cosmopolitans as a vital counter-narrative to the fixity of
the ethnic absolutisms that are entrenched in the structural racism of
the nation-state.7 While they focused on the concept of the ship as a
chronotope and the flow of (heterosexual male) bodies across social and
material borders, the metaphors of fluidity were not all together new. I
argued in a book---which was very much a child of these
discourses---that the ocean was a vital and ubiquitous trope of the
flows and torrents of British expansion and trade in the 18th and 19th
century, evident in British poetry as well as travel narratives.8
[[There is a **critical link** between]{.mark} **trans[oceanic
empire]{.mark}, the rise of [capitalism, and]{.mark} the [imaginative
grammar]{.mark} of fluidity** and flow.]{.underline} In an important
book on H20, Ivan Illich argued that the concept of the circulation of
social fluids was imagined through images of blood, water, and
commodities in 18th-century Europe. By 1750, the social came "to be
imagined as a system of conduits," where the "liquidity" of bodies,
labor, ideas, raw materials, capital, and products arose as a "dominant
metaphor."9 In sum, transoceanic empire helped constitute a fluid
grammar for what Edward LiPuma and Benjamin Lee call "circulatory
capitalism."10 This liquidity was also constitutive of the discourse of
globalization, postmodernity, and what sociologist Zygmunt Bauman
famously termed "liquid modernity."11

This fluid turn was not necessarily engaged in the ontology of "wet
matter," to borrow from geographers Philip Steinberg and Kimberley
Peters.12 In other words, the oceans were spaces to be traversed by
(heteronormative) male agents, not necessarily to immerse or submerge in
a dynamic relation to nonhuman matter (water) and more-than-human
species as we see in more scholarship today.13 The oceanic turn in
scholarship after the 1990s was not just driven by the changing
mobilities of human activity but also by the largest remapping of the
planet since the Truman Proclamation which declared the length of a
coastal "cannon-shot" (200 miles) as sovereign national territory.
[[This]{.mark} created what Maltese Ambassador Arvind Pardo famously
labeled a global **["scramble for the seas"]{.mark}** which was based on
the expectation of new technologies for extracting strategic seabed
minerals like manganese. This eventually led to the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea which, when ratified by over 165 states
in 1994, [enclosed the oceanic global commons]{.mark}.14 Because this
remapping includes the sea, subsea, and airspace, this is the largest
juridical and cartographic change to the globe in human history. Just as
18th-century discourse adopted a lexicon [reflecting the fluidity of
empire]{.mark}, our [**21st-century discourse is entangled**
with]{.mark} the aquatic flows of **[neoliberal extraction and
"circulatory capitalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}." Critical ocean studies
is attentive to how the enclosure of the seas has discursive effects. In
other words, aquatic space shapes our language just as we are shaped by
the ocean, materially and ontologically. [Consequently, in this shift to
the **"blue economy"** it's not surprising that global regime changes
are reflected in the maritime grammars we use to communicate about
everything from fluidity to the **"blue humanities."**15]{.underline}\
There is precedent to this argument that geopolitical and juridical
changes impact academic disciplines as well as discourse. For example,
the late capitalist era of globalization that characterized the 1990s
"Asia Pacific pivot" led literature scholars such as Christopher Connery
to theorize the utopian discourse of the Pacific Rim in relation to the
increased visibility of transnational capital. Connery located the
emergence of Pacific Rim studies as an academic reflection of US
imperialism as it continues to fulfill its "manifest destiny" by
expanding across the Pacific toward Asian capital, reflecting a similar
teleology to that which led the US to overthrow the sovereign territory
of Hawai\`i in 1893.16 Building on the work of David Harvey, Connery
argued that: The concept of region, arising as it does within a binary
logic of difference, is a semiotic utopia, a "spatial fix" for those
faced with analyzing the always differentiating but always concealing
logic of capital. The region, less encumbered by the various ideological
or mythical mystifications that pervade the state, will be where history
and analysis takes place.17 The ocean and its disciplinary reframings
and investments also reflect a similar fixing of desire. This is a
conceptual, spatial, and neoliberal fix, as I will explain. To Harvey,
the problems of capital's excess are resolved (temporarily) through
space: "the absorption of excess capital and labor (is achieved through)
geographical expansion. This spatial fix ... entails the production of
new spaces within which capitalist production can proceed."18 Here we
see capitalism's use of the oceanic body as an accumulation strategy or
fix. Having exhausted terrestrial markets, capitalism co-creates and
adapts technologies to turn to outer space and the so-called inner space
of the oceanic realm. Yet this new era of unfixed capital, derivatives,
and speculative futures raises new formal and conceptual questions about
the oceanic turn.

In their work on Financial Derivatives and the Globalization of Risk,
LiPuma and Lee claim that we are now in an era of "circulatory
capitalism": speculative capital, circulated through risk driven
derivatives, is currently restructuring the relationship between
production and circulation by accelerating and expanding the spatial
reach of the reproduction of capital ... We are witnessing the rise of a
transformed form or new phase of capitalism in which production is (and
remains) a crucial, indispensable, but now encompassed moment of a
globalizing system that is striving toward a different type of
totality.19 [Their [metaphors of]{.mark} fluidity about "cultures of
[circulation" and **"streams of capital"**]{.mark} point toward the ways
in which technologies [help produce **the overaccumulation of
capital**]{.mark} and thus by extension, will [need a spatial
fix]{.mark}.20 That **spatial fix**, increasingly, has become [the world
ocean]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In their article "The Blue Fix," the authors Zoe Brent, Mads
Barbesgaard, and Carsten Pedersen provide a compelling argument about
the ways in which the UNCLOS enclosure created a spatial fix for
capitalism, a new frontier for raw materials and consumption. [The
[neoliberal discourse of **"blue growth, blue economy, blue
revolution"**]{.mark} as well as blue investments and blue mining [seek
to entice]{.mark} state and corporate investment in [ocean technologies
and extractive industries without addressing]{.mark} the social and
technological propensity for **[devastating ecological loss]{.mark}**.21
[This]{.mark} spatial [fix is comprised of a **"conservation
fix"**]{.mark} (ecosystems management), a "protein fix" (industrial
fisheries), and an "energy/extractive fix" (offshore and deep-sea
mining). [Their]{.mark} particular concern is the [**commodification of
the ocean** and its resources]{.mark} and the ways in which states and
corporate actors are [work]{.mark}ing [together to create a **neoliberal
blue economy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Turning briefly to an infographic
from the World Bank, we see that the blue economy is defined as a
"sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, improved
livelihoods and jobs, and ocean ecosystem health" based on the
management of renewable energy, fisheries, transportation, waste, and
tourism.

### Link---Geoengineering---2NC

#### Geoengineering encourages the technofix mentality, ignoring the systemic causes of climate change\-\--it is just another way to sustain corporate power 

Linda **Schneider** 20**18**, SftP Publishing. "Geoengineering and
Environmental Capitalism • SftP Magazine." Science for the People
Magazine, 21 Aug. 2018,
magazine.scienceforthepeople.org/geoengineering/geoengineering-environmental-capitalism/
AS

[[Geoengineering]{.mark} is an attempt to solve the problem of climate
change---a social, political, and ecological crisis---through
**large-scale technological projects**.]{.underline} This ["technofix"
mentality [lends itself to a systematic disregard of]{.mark} risk,
[adverse impacts]{.mark}]{.underline}, and unintended side-effects
associated with unproven technologies. Side effects are particularly
threatening to strained natural ecosystems and economically or
ecologically vulnerable populations.

Some consequences are fairly straightforward: the technological system
known as BECCS is meant to couple bioenergy production with Carbon
Capture and Storage
([CCS](http://www.geoengineeringmonitor.org/2018/05/carbon_capture_storage/))
technologies that bury CO2 underground. If rolled out at a
climate-relevant scale, BECCS would lead to fierce competition over land
and resources, widespread land grabs and forced displacement, and sharp
increases in global food prices.

Computer simulations have predicted other possible impacts of
geoengineering schemes on the natural world. Injecting aerosols in the
stratosphere could suppress rainfall and potentially interfere with
monsoon patterns. Carbon farm monocultures threaten to destroy natural
ecosystems at a massive scale. [Given that natural processes and systems
are complex, non-linear, and in some measure chaotic and unpredictable,
the [overwhelming **majority of effects** that **will ripple through our
global ecosystems**]{.mark} might [only become apparent after]{.mark}
[geoengineering technologies are actually deployed]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The systematic dominance of physical science and engineering
perspectives in geoengineering [research]{.mark} [e**ncourages a neglect
of social and environmental impacts**]{.mark}. This negligence is
characteristic of an approach that [addresses symptoms but leaves the
underlying conditions]{.mark} that spawned the problem [in
place]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Yet the sociopolitical and socioeconomic
implications of large-scale technological schemes to "fix" the climate
are profound: under existing global power relations, [**geoengineering
is bound to be exploited for corporate and strategic
interest**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The perfect excuse for continuing business-as-usual]{.underline}

[Finding a technological shortcut to climate change is in the interest
of those responsible for the bulk of the problem. Were the international
community to address the root causes of environmental destruction, major
pollutants would bear the political and economic costs. It is therefore
no surprise that [fossil fuel]{.mark} **[companies]{.mark}** **and their
representatives [often draw on geoengineering as part of
the "solution" to climate change]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [If pollution
can be cleaned up after the fact and global warming and other symptoms
of climate change can be technologically suppressed, then the
**[industries responsible for environmental crisis can]{.mark} [continue
business as usual.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Oil industry moguls and their representatives, such as Haroon Kheshgi at
ExxonMobil, have been at the forefront of developing geoengineering
technologies, particularly to remove CO2 from the atmosphere. Kheshgi is
also an author of the upcoming [IPCC Special Report on
1.5°C](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/sr15/), which for a broad range of
over one hundred international civil society organizations constitutes a
flagrant conflict of interest.

In many cases, **[there is [direct]{.mark} [overlap]{.mark} [between oil
industry interests and geoengineering projects branded as environmental
solutions]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), an
important enabling technology for Carbon Dioxide Removal ([CDR]{.mark}),
**[was originally developed by the oil industry]{.mark}** as Enhanced
Oil Recovery (EOR), a technique to flush out the final drops of oil from
nearly-depleted wells and reservoirs. Both fossil CCS and CCS coupled
with bioenergy (BECCS) or CO2 from the atmosphere (]{.underline}[Direct
Air
Capture](http://www.geoengineeringmonitor.org/2018/05/direct-air-capture/)[ and
CCS, or DACCS) are now touted as contributions to climate change
mitigation.]{.underline}

For a long time, geoengineering was too controversial for big
corporations to publicly endorse. Yet as Steve Horn revealed in
his [DeSmog
Blog](https://www.desmogblog.com/biochar-lobby-offsets-tar-sands-fracking-reclamation-unsettled-science) article,
"How the Biochar Industry Pushed for Offsets, Tar Sands, and Fracking
Reclamation Using Unsettled Science," powerful industries have lobbied
extensively for geoengineering initiatives like biochar.

Much remains to be uncovered about the entanglements of the fossil fuel
industry and geoengineering initiatives, but [[as geoengineering becomes
less taboo, **corporate interests are**]{.mark} [**increasingly
apparent**.]{.mark} Business magnates such as Bill Gates and Richard
Branson, the founder of the Virgin Group, have openly donated large sums
of money toward geoengineering research and
technology]{.underline}. [Private and **corporate investments contribute
to the highly undemocratic and unaccountable nature of the field of
geoengineering research** and development.]{.underline}

[Fossil fuel industries have much to lose from the socioecological
transformation and restructuring that our economies and societies
urgently need.]{.underline} [An entire mode of production---highly
polluting, highly exploitative of humans and nature---is
utterly indefensible in the face of climate change and the global social
injustice environmental degradation perpetuates.]{.underline} [In
treating some of the symptoms of climate change but not tackling the
root causes, **[geoengineering can]{.mark} [be understood as a]{.mark}
desperate [attempt to maintain a failed economic status
quo]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Engineering the climate for profit

[Geoengineering schemes are not only in the interest of fossil
fuel producers and extractive industries. They also **[promise market
expansion, commercial]{.mark} [gains and greater power for new and
emerging economic actors and corporations]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The
recent increase in registered [geoengineering]{.mark} patents and
burgeoning commercial interest in geoengineering [technologies]{.mark}
[make]{.mark} clear that [tech **entrepreneurs expect to profit from
"fixing" the climate
crisis**]{.mark}]{.underline}.[10](https://magazine.scienceforthepeople.org/geoengineering/geoengineering-environmental-capitalism/#easy-footnote-bottom-10-2190)

In the current absence of a significant carbon price or
government regulation, it is incumbent upon "carbon geoengineers" to
come up with commercially viable products made from the CO2 they
capture. Strategies to make CDR commercially viable include attempts to
use captured CO2 for Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) or, in the case of
David Keith's direct air capture company, for synthetic fuels for the
transport
sector.[11](https://magazine.scienceforthepeople.org/geoengineering/geoengineering-environmental-capitalism/#easy-footnote-bottom-11-2190) **[[These]{.mark} commercial
[goods]{.mark} might [eventually be profitable, but certainly have no
climatic benefit]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

#### Capitalist regime [turns case]{.underline}\-\--geoengineering only exists to maintain current profit-seeking motives of businesses\-\--proves to be fatal 

John Bellamy **Foster** 20**18,** American professor of sociology at the
University of Oregon. "Making War on the Planet." Monthly Review, Sept.
2018, monthlyreview.org/2018/09/01/making-war-on-the-planet/. AS

A short fuse is burning. At the present rate of global emissions, the
world is projected to reach the trillionth metric ton of cumulative
carbon emissions, breaking the global carbon budget, in less than two
decades.[1](https://monthlyreview.org/2018/09/01/making-war-on-the-planet/#en1) This
would usher in a period of dangerous climate change that could well
prove irreversible, affecting the climate for centuries if not
millennia. Even if the entire world economy were to cease emitting
carbon dioxide at the present moment, the extra carbon already
accumulated in the atmosphere virtually guarantees that climate change
will continue with damaging effects to the human species and life in
general. However, reaching the 2°C increase in global average
temperature guardrail, associated with a level of carbon concentration
in the environment of 450 ppm, would lead to a qualitatively different
condition. At that point, climate feedbacks would increasingly come into
play threatening to catapult global average temperatures to 3°C or 4°C
above preindustrial levels within this century, in the lifetime of many
individuals alive today. The situation is only made more serious by the
emission of other greenhouse gases, including methane and nitrous oxide.

The enormous dangers that rapid climate change present to humanity as a
whole, and the inability of the existing capitalist political-economic
structure to address them, symbolized by the presence of Donald Trump in
the White House, have engendered a desperate search for technofixes in
the form of schemes for geoengineering, defined as massive, deliberate
human interventions to manipulate the entire climate or the planet as a
whole.

[Not only is [geoengineering]{.mark} now [being **enthusiastically
pushed by today's billionaire class**]{.mark}, as represented by figures
like Bill Gates and Richard Branson; by environmental organizations such
as the Environmental Defense Fund and the Natural Resources Defense
Council; [by **think tanks**]{.mark} like the Breakthrough Institute and
Climate Code Red; [and by fossil-fuel corporations]{.mark} like Exxon
Mobil and Shell---it is also being actively pursued by the governments
of the United States, the United Kingdom, China, and Russia. The UN
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has incorporated
negative emissions strategies based on geoengineering (in the form of
Bio-energy with Carbon Capture and Storage, or BECCS) into nearly all of
its climate models. Even some figures on the [political left]{.mark}
(where "accelerationist" ideas have recently taken hold in some
quarters) [have grabbed]{.mark} uncritically [onto

If the Earth System is to avoid 450 ppm of carbon concentration in the
atmosphere and is to return to the Holocene average of 350 ppm, some
negative emissions by technological means, and hence geoengineering on
at least a limited scale, will be required, according to leading
climatologist James
Hansen.[3](https://monthlyreview.org/2018/09/01/making-war-on-the-planet/#en3) Hansen's
strategy, however, like most others, remains based on the current
system, that is, [it excludes the possibility of a full-scale ecological
revolution, involving the self-mobilization of the population around
production and consumption. What remains certain is that any attempt to
implement [geoengineering]{.mark} (even in the form of technological
schemes for carbon removal) as the dominant strategy for addressing
global warming, subordinated to the ends of capital accumulation, [would

action, the burden it would put on future generations, and the dangers
to living species, including our own, are so great that the only

coupled with an emphasis on agroecology and restoration of global
ecosystems, including forests, to absorb carbon
dioxide.]{.underline}[4](https://monthlyreview.org/2018/09/01/making-war-on-the-planet/#en4)[ This

Geoengineering the Planet Under the Regime of Fossil Capital

Geoengineering as an idea dates back to the period of the first
discoveries of rapid anthropogenic climate change. Beginning in the
early 1960s, the Soviet Union's (and at that time the world's) leading
climatologist, Mikhail Budyko, was the first to issue a number of
warnings on the inevitably of accelerated global climate change in the
case of industrial systems based on the burning of fossil
fuels.[5](https://monthlyreview.org/2018/09/01/making-war-on-the-planet/#en5) Although
anthropogenic climate change had long been recognized, what was new was
the discovery of major climate feedbacks such as the melting of Arctic
ice and the disruption of the albedo effect as reflective white ice was
replaced with blue seawater, increasing the amount of solar radiation
absorbed by the planet and ratcheting up global average temperature. In
1974, Budyko offered, as a possible solution to climate change, the use
of high-flying planes to release sulfur particles (forming sulfate
aerosols) into the stratosphere. [This was meant to mimic the role
played by volcanic action in propelling sulfur into the atmosphere, thus
creating a partial barrier, limiting incoming solar radiation. **[The
rationale]{.mark} he [offered]{.mark} [was that capitalist
economies]{.mark}**, in particular, **[would]{.mark} [not be able to
curtail capital-accumulation-based growth]{.mark}, energy use, and
emissions, [despite the danger to the
climate]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Consequently, [technological
alternatives to stabilize the climate would have to be
explored.]{.underline} But it was not until 1977 when the Italian
physicist Cesare Marchetti proposed a scheme for capturing carbon
dioxide emissions from electrical power plants and using pipes to
sequester them in the ocean depths that the word "geoengineering" itself
was to appear.

Budyko's pioneering proposal to use sulfur particles to block a part of
the sun's rays, now known as "stratospheric aerosol injection," and
Marchetti's early notion of capturing and sequestering carbon in the
ocean, stand for the two main general approaches to
geoengineering---respectively, solar radiation management (SRM) and
carbon dioxide removal (CDR). SRM is designed to limit the solar
radiation reaching the earth. CDR seeks to capture and remove carbon to
decrease the amount entering the atmosphere.

Besides stratospheric aerosol injection, first proposed by Budyko,
another approach to SRM that has gained influential adherents in recent
years is marine cloud brightening. This would involve cooling the earth
by modifying low-lying, stratocumulus clouds covering around a third of
the ocean, making them more reflective. In the standard scenario, a
special fleet of 1,500 unmanned, satellite-controlled ships would roam
the ocean spraying submicron drops of seawater in the air, which would
evaporate leaving salty residues. These bright salt particles would
reflect incoming solar radiation. They would also act as cloud
condensation nuclei, increasing the surface area of the clouds, with the
result that more solar radiation would be reflected.

Both stratospheric aerosol injection and marine cloud brightening are
widely criticized as posing enormous hazards on top of climate change
itself, while simply addressing the symptoms not the cause of climate
change. Stratospheric aerosol injection---to be delivered to the
stratosphere by means of hoses, cannons, balloons, or planes---would
alter the global hydrological cycle with enormous unpredictable effects,
likely leading to massive droughts in major regions of the planet. It is
feared that it could shut down the Indian monsoon system disrupting
agriculture for as many as 2 billion people. There are also worries that
it might affect photosynthesis and crop production over much of the
globe. The injection of sulfur particles into the atmosphere could
contribute to depletion of the ozone layer. Much of the extra sulfur
would end up dropping to the earth, leading to acid rain. Most worrisome
of all, stratospheric aerosol injection would have to be repeated year
after year. At termination the rise in temperature associated with
additional carbon buildup would come almost at once with world
temperature conceivably rising by 2--3°C in a decade---a phenomenon
referred to as the "termination problem."

As with stratospheric aerosol injection, marine cloud brightening would
drastically affect the hydrological cycle in unpredictable ways. For
example, it could generate a severe drought in the Amazon, drying up the
world's most vital terrestrial ecosystem with incalculable and
catastrophic effects for Earth System stability. Many of the dangers of
cloud brightening are similar to those of stratospheric aerosol
depletion. Like other forms of SRM, it would do nothing to stop ocean
acidification caused by rising carbon dioxide levels.

[The first form of [CDR]{.mark} to [attract significant **attention from
economic interests and investors**]{.mark} was the idea of fertilizing
the ocean with iron, thereby boosting the growth of phytoplankton so as
to promote greater ocean uptake of carbon.]{.underline} There have been
a dozen experiments in this area and the difficulties attending this
scheme have proven to be legion. The effects on the ecological cycles of
phytoplankton, zooplankton, and a host of other marine species all the
way up to whales at the top of the food chain are indeterminate.
Although some parts of the ocean would become greener due to the
additional iron, other parts would become bluer, more devoid of life,
because they would be deprived of the nutrients---nitrate, phosphorus,
and silica---needed for growth. Evidence suggests that the vast portion
of the carbon taken in by the ocean would stay on the surface or the
intermediate levels of the ocean, with only a tiny part entering the
ocean depths, where it would be naturally sequestered.

Among the various CDR schemas, it is BECCS, because of its promise of
negative emissions, which today is attracting the most support. This is
because it seems to allow nations to overshoot climate targets on the
basis that the carbon can be removed from the atmosphere decades later.
Although BECCS exists at present largely as an untested computer model,
it is now incorporated into almost all climate models utilized by the
IPCC. As modeled, BECCS would burn cultivated crops in order to generate
electricity, with the capture and underground storage of the resulting
carbon dioxide. In theory, since plant crops can be seen as carbon
neutral---taking carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and then eventually
releasing it again---BECCS, by burning biomass and then capturing and
sequestering the resulting carbon emissions, would be a means of
generating electricity while at the same time resulting in a net
reduction of atmospheric carbon.

BECCS, however, comes into question the moment one moves from the
abstract to the concrete. The IPCC's median-level models are projected
to remove 630 gigatons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, around two
thirds of the total emitted between the Industrial Revolution and
2011. This would occur on vast crop plantations to be run by
agribusiness. To remove a trillion tons of carbon dioxide from the
atmosphere as envisioned in the more ambitious scenarios would take up a
land twice the size of India (or equal to Australia), about half as much
land as currently farmed globally, requiring a supply of freshwater
equal to current total global agricultural usage. The costs of
implementing BECCS on the imagined scales have been estimated by
climatologist James Hansen---who critically notes that negative
emissions have "spread like a cancer" in the IPCC climate models---to be
on the order of hundreds of trillions of dollars, with "minimal
estimated costs" ranging as high as \$570 trillion this century. The
effects of BECCS---used as a primary mechanism and designed to avoid
confrontation with the present system of production---would therefore be
a massive displacement of small farmers and global food production.

Moreover, the notion that the forms of large-scale, commercial
agricultural production presumed in BECCS models would be carbon neutral
and would thus result in negative emissions with sequestration has been
shown to be exaggerated or false when the larger effects on global land
use are taken into account. BECCS crop cultivation is expected to take
place on vast monoculture plantations, displacing other forms of land
use. Yet, biologically diverse ecosystems have substantially higher
rates of carbon sequestration in soil and biomass than does monocrop
agriculture. An alternative to BECCS in promoting carbon sequestration
would be to promote massive, planetary ecological restoration, including
reforestation, together with the promotion of agroecology modeled on
traditional forms of agriculture organized around nutrient recycling and
improved soil management methods. This would avoid the metabolic rift
associated with agribusiness monocultures, which are less efficient both
in terms of food production per hectare and carbon sequestration.

Another commonly advocated technofix, carbon capture and sequestration
(CCS), is not strictly a form of geoengineering since it is directed at
capturing and sequestering carbon emissions of particular electrical
plants, such as coal-fired power plants. However, the promotion of a CCS
infrastructure on a planetary scale as a means of addressing climate
change---thereby skirting the necessity of an ecological revolution in
production and consumption---is best seen as a form of planetary
geoengineering due to its immense projected economic and ecological
scale. Although CCS would theoretically allow the burning of fossil
fuels from electrical power plants with no carbon emissions into the
atmosphere, the scale and the costs of CCS operations are prohibitive.
As Clive Hamilton writes in Earthmasters: The Dawn of the Age of Climate
Engineering, CCS for a single "standard-sized 1,000 megawatt coal-fired
plant....would need 30 kilometers of air-sucking machinery and six
chemical plants, with a footprint of 6 square kilometers." Energy expert
Vaclav Smil has calculated that, "in order to sequester just a fifth of
current \[2010\] CO2 emissions we would have to create an entirely new
worldwide absorption-gathering-compression-transportation-storage
industry whose annual throughput would have to be about 70 percent
larger than the annual volume now handled by the global crude oil
industry, whose immense infrastructure of wells, pipelines, compressor
stations and storage took generations to build." Capturing and
sequestering current U.S. carbon dioxide emissions would require 130
billion tons of water per year, equal to about half the annual flow of
the Columbia River. This new gigantic infrastructure would be placed on
top of the current fossil fuel infrastructure---all in order to allow
for the continued burning of fossil fuels.

A Planetary Precautionary Principle for the Anthropocene

[If today's planetary ecological emergency is a product of centuries of
war on the planet as a mechanism of capital accumulation, fossil-capital
generated geoengineering schemes can be seen as gargantuan projects for
keeping the system going by carrying this war to its ultimate
level.]{.underline} [**[Geoengineering]{.mark}** under the present
regime of accumulation [has the **sole objective of keeping the status
quo intact**]{.mark}---[neither]{.mark} [disturbing]{.mark} the dominant
relations of [capitalist]{.mark} [production]{.mark} [nor even]{.mark}
seeking so much as to [overturn the fossil-fuel industry]{.mark} with
which capital is deeply intertwined**. [Profits]{.mark}, production,
[and]{.mark} [overcoming]{.mark} [energy poverty]{.mark} in the poorer
parts of the world thus [become justifications for keeping the present
fossil-capital system going]{.mark}**, maintaining at all cost the
existing capitalist environmental regime.]{.underline} The Promethean
mentality behind this is well captured by a question that Rex Tillerson
then CEO of Exxon Mobil Corporation asked---without a trace of
irony---at an annual shareholders meeting in 2013: "What good is it to
save the planet if humanity suffers?"

The whole history of ecological crisis leading up the present planetary
emergency, punctuated by numerous disasters---from the near total
destruction of the ozone layer, to **[nutrient loading and the spread of
dead zones in the ocean, to climate change itself---serves to highlight
the march of folly associated with any attempt to engineer the entire
planet.]{.underline}** [The complexity of the Earth System guarantees
that enormous unforeseen consequences would emerge. As Frederick Engels
warned in the nineteenth century, "Let us not...flatter ourselves
overmuch on account of our human victories over nature. For each such
victory nature takes its revenge on us. Each victory, it is true, in the
first place brings about the results we expected, but in the second and
third places it has quite different, unforeseen effects which only too
often cancel the first]{.underline}."

[In the face of uncertainty, coupled with an extremely high likelihood
of inflicting incalculable harm on the Earth System]{.underline}, it is
essential to invoke what is known as the Precautionary Principle
whenever the question of planetary geoengineering is raised. As
ecological economist Paul Burkett has explained, the strong version of
the Precautionary Principle, necessarily encompasses the following:

(1) The Precautionary Principle Proper, which says that if an
action may cause serious harm, there is a case for counteracting
measures to ensure that the action does not take place.

(2) The Principle of Reverse Onus, under [which it is the responsibility
of those supporting an action to show that it is not seriously harmful,
thereby shifting the burden of proof off those potentially harmed by the
action]{.underline} (e.g. the general population and other species
occupying the environment). In short, it is safety, rather than
potential harm, that needs to be demonstrated.

(3) [The Principle of Alternative Assessment, stipulating that no
potentially harmful action will be undertaken if there are alternative
actions available that safely achieve the same goals as the action
proposed.]{.underline}

(4) All societal deliberations bearing on the application of features 1
through 3 must be open, informed, and democratic, and must include all
affected
parties.[27](https://monthlyreview.org/2018/09/01/making-war-on-the-planet/#en27)

[It is clear that [geoengineering **promoted in a context of a
capitalist regime**]{.mark} **of maximum accumulation** [would be ruled
out completely]{.mark} by a strong Precautionary Principle based on each
of the criteria listed above.]{.underline} [There is a near certainty of
extreme damage to the human species as a whole arising from all of the
major geoengineering proposals.]{.underline} If the onus were placed on
status quo proponents of capitalist geoengineering to demonstrate that
great harm to the planet as a place of human habitation would not be
inflicted, such proposals would fail the test. [Since the alternative of
not burning fossil fuels and promoting alternative forms of energy is
entirely feasible, while planetary geoengineering carries with it
immense added dangers for the Earth System as a whole, such a technofix
as a primary means of checking global warming would be excluded by that
criterion, too]{.underline}. [Finally, geoengineering under the present
economic and social system invariably involves some entity from the
power structure---a single multi-billionaire, a corporation, a
government, or an international
organization]{.underline}---[[implementing such action ostensibly
on]{.mark} [behalf of humanity as a whole]{.mark}, [while leaving most
affected parties]{.mark} worldwide out of the decision-making process,
with hundreds of millions, perhaps billions, of people [paying the
environmental costs]{.mark}, often with their lives. In short,
geoengineering, particularly if subordinated to the capital accumulation
process, violates the most sacred version of the Precautionary
Principle, dating back to antiquity: First Do No Harm]{.underline}.

The terms Age of Discovery or Age of Exploration describe the period
from the end of the 15th century to the eighteenth century of
contemporary history during which extensive overseas exploration by
Europeans marks, according to some scholars, the beginning of
globalization
(Abu-Lughod, [Citation1991](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1088937X.2018.1455756?casa_token=4nIEm0e-oKQAAAAA%3Af3YRqYqtWrw16QApKaDaGF7vMCcM6ZEBwVHjfODdPRBf0pVzE9EDG-IdWDhFJSQ9LPuYlvO2FA)).
[Although this specific period of world history has long before passed,
according to certain views humanity is again entering a new age of
exploration, propelled this time by human-made climate change: with the
ice-coverage in the Arctic on a continuous decline, [this **region**
]{.mark}**could [provide a new epicenter for business
activities]{.mark}**; geopolitical tensions in relation to the
control/exploitation of the newly opened maritime routes, as well as the
vast quantities of resources available in the wider region could also
arise.]{.underline} Before proceeding any further, it is necessary to
clarify that for the purposes of the analysis in hand, the 'Arctic' is
defined as the area containing the Arctic Ocean as well as the
respective territories of the States with a latitude higher than the
Arctic Circle (66°33′46.1 N); the land within the Arctic Circle is
divided among eight countries: Norway, Sweden, Finland, the Russian
Federation, the United States of America (Alaska), Canada, Denmark
(Greenland), and Iceland (where is passes through the small offshore
island of Grimsey).

[[The Arctic was, until recently]{.mark}, [considered a harsh and
unapproachable environment]{.mark}; [but]{.mark}, unprecedented [climate
change]{.mark} (e.g. significant decline of the oceanic ice cover,
rising atmospheric and ocean temperatures) [combined with technological
advances]{.mark} now available to mitigate adverse environmental
conditions, **[provide an extraordinary opportunity to
capitalize]{.mark}** on a plethora of untapped resources]{.underline}.
[The Arctic is considered a promising field for future economic
activities, such as offshore energy and exploration, tourism, fishing,
and, last but not least, maritime transport.]{.underline} The promise
for shorter voyages from Asia towards Europe and/or the Americas (and
vice-versa) is very enticing; navigation along the Northern Sea Route
(NSR) and/or the Northwest Passage (NWP) is now more feasible. [It is
therefore **[no coincidence that the Arctic region has become a site of
intense geopolitical intrigue]{.mark}** between practitioners and
spectators of geopolitics and international relations]{.underline}

Examples of recent environmental changes in 2016 alone indicate that
[the pace and scale of change is nothing short of remarkable, and this
one annual interval highlights environmental changes that continue to
occur throughout the Arctic landscape]{.underline}. [**[Arctic air
temperatures continue to rise at double the rate of the global]{.mark}
[temperature increase]{.mark}**. The average annual surface air
temperature anomaly (+2.0°C relative to the 1981--2010 baselines) over
land north of 60° N between October 2015 and September 2016 was by far
the highest in the observational record beginning in 1900]{.underline}
(NOAA, [Citation2016](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1088937X.2018.1455756?casa_token=4nIEm0e-oKQAAAAA%3Af3YRqYqtWrw16QApKaDaGF7vMCcM6ZEBwVHjfODdPRBf0pVzE9EDG-IdWDhFJSQ9LPuYlvO2FA)).
Five of the first six months of 2016 set records for the smallest
respective monthly sea ice extent since consistent satellite records
began in 1979. [Specifically, the [pace]{.mark} [of the Arctic sea ice
retreat is increasing]{.mark}, currently at 13.3% per decade compared to
the averages of 1981--2010. While major climate indicators such as
rising air temperatures and declining ice coverage continue to break
records in 2016, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)
scientists believe it is more significant that global temperature and
**[Arctic sea ice are continuing their decades-long trends of
change]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Climate
NASA, [Citation2016](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1088937X.2018.1455756?casa_token=4nIEm0e-oKQAAAAA%3Af3YRqYqtWrw16QApKaDaGF7vMCcM6ZEBwVHjfODdPRBf0pVzE9EDG-IdWDhFJSQ9LPuYlvO2FA)).

Due to such changes, it has [only been in **[recent years]{.mark} that
the [Arctic is considered]{.mark} [suitable for economic
activities]{.mark}** and a region within which maritime industries will
be able to facilitate their operations.]{.underline} This, of course,
comes as no surprise given past harsh year-long environmental conditions
that significantly hindered or even completely blocked the necessary
access and transport connections (Dalaklis &
Baxevani, [Citation2017](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1088937X.2018.1455756?casa_token=4nIEm0e-oKQAAAAA%3Af3YRqYqtWrw16QApKaDaGF7vMCcM6ZEBwVHjfODdPRBf0pVzE9EDG-IdWDhFJSQ9LPuYlvO2FA)).
Therefore, over the last couple of decades, when referring to the global
volume of maritime traffic, the total contribution of the Arctic region
was (and remains) rather small
(UNCTAD, [Citation2016](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1088937X.2018.1455756?casa_token=4nIEm0e-oKQAAAAA%3Af3YRqYqtWrw16QApKaDaGF7vMCcM6ZEBwVHjfODdPRBf0pVzE9EDG-IdWDhFJSQ9LPuYlvO2FA)).
[Also, the vast majority of its coastal areas were (and still are)
characterized by a severe lack of transportation infrastructure,
inhibiting their significant contribution to the global economic
activity.]{.underline} [But, the present environmental status within the
Arctic landscape, in conjunction with the future trajectories of sea ice
retreat **[provides a good motive for competing entities]{.mark}**
within the maritime transport sector to explore these northern routes,
also called 'Arctic Passages,' as alternatives to more traditional
transcontinental corridors.]{.underline} For those looking to explore
the once inaccessible routes of the Arctic, navigation along the NSR
and/or NWP (see also Figure 1) can now provide shorter traveling times
between Asia and Europe/the Americas compared to the traditional routes
via the Suez and Panama Canals. Furthermore, it is important to consider
that the days when navigation is possible in these northern routes are
expected to follow an increasing trend: from about 70 days (now) up to
125 in the year 2050, and as many as 160 in 2100 (Cariou &

Before moving to the next section, it is necessary to clarify that
geopolitics officially appeared as an academic discipline roughly two
hundred years ago, in a politically unstable period of history, during
which exploration of the Earth had been completed and the major powers
(of that era) focused on searching for new methods of increasing their
power and establishing further their dominion
(Dalaklis, [Citation2015a](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/1088937X.2018.1455756?casa_token=4nIEm0e-oKQAAAAA%3Af3YRqYqtWrw16QApKaDaGF7vMCcM6ZEBwVHjfODdPRBf0pVzE9EDG-IdWDhFJSQ9LPuYlvO2FA)).
The Merriam-Webster dictionary defines geopolitics as 'a study of the
influence of such factors as geography, economics, and demography on the
politics and especially the foreign policy of a state'. In order to
provide the necessary background for the Arctic in terms of geographic
details, a broad discussion of the 'Arctic Passages' is provided next.
[Additionally, under the prism of geopolitics, **[icebreakers are the
backbone of any presence in the Arctic]{.mark}**, both military and
civilian. [Icebreakers have multiple uses]{.mark}; from resupplying
isolated communities and outposts to scientific exploration, search and
rescue (SAR), [and of outmost importance for
shipping]{.mark}:]{.underline} ensuring that sea lines remain ice-free.
[Considering that ice and **[ice-pacts will remain a concern in the
future]{.mark}**, the support of icebreakers will still be needed to
facilitate the safe passage of ships. Describing the state of these
types of vessels currently available is the main aim, with a particular
focus on key state players: the Russian Federation (RF), the United
States of America (USA) and Canada. Additionally, a critical evaluation

[Comprehensive [Arctic strategies]{.mark} adopted first by Arctic, and
later by non-Arctic states, [focus on generating an]{.mark} **Arctic
[extractive economy,]{.mark}** but so far the result of these political
strategies has been [an **expansion** of **state economic activity**
through **infrastructure development**]{.mark}. In the historical
analysis of extractive industries, Bunker and Ciccantell (2005) argue
that [most]{.mark} of the grand **[extractive]{.mark}
[projects]{.mark}** would [not]{.mark} have been [possible
without]{.mark} **strong [state support]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the form
of **[infrastructure]{.mark} development**.]{.underline} [These examples
from the Arctic suggest that political issues interact **heavily** with
economic factors to determine energy transportation, such as
**[pipelines, ports, and sea-lanes]{.mark}**. This energy related
infrastructure not only incorporates the local into the global, [serving
as **means**]{.mark} **of [political influence and geopolitical
competition]{.mark},** but also has a political impact at the local
level in regional policy and planning. Since traditional lifestyles
pursued by many Arctic indigenous peoples depend on reindeer herding and
fisheries, [tensions]{.mark} are likely to [arise]{.mark} when **pasture
areas shrink** [due to **infrastructure construction**]{.mark} and
maintenance, as well as [raising levels of]{.mark} **industrial
[pollution]{.mark}** that negatively affect fish populations. Thus, a
relevant concern is that the **[construction of]{.mark} energy-related
[infrastructure]{.mark}**, as a part of large-scale industrialization of
the High North pursued by some Arctic states, may set a path for future
Arctic development that will [**directly contradict** policies aimed
at]{.mark} social and **environmental
[sustainability]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

The first wave of intensive commercial interest in Arctic oil and gas
started in the 1970s and accelerated in response to the first oil crisis
of 1973, when considerations of energy security promoted and enabled
expensive projects, such as the Trans-Alaskan pipeline.

Following the 1979 crisis, Norway opened up the north of the Norwegian
Sea for further oil and gas exploration. As already mentioned, the most
recent millennial optimism about Arctic hydrocarbon exploration can be
interpreted as a continuation of these dynamics (Avango and Högselius
2013). It was prompted by a combination of steady increases in oil
prices during the 2000s, concerns over energy security related to
tensions in EU--Russia energy relations, melting ice due to climate
change, and the promise of 'Arctic riches' after the publication of the
USGS 2008. In the past 200 years, temperatures in the Arctic have
escalated more than any other region on earth. In the interdependent
global climate system, these Arctic changes are very likely to have
detrimental effects on the rest of the world (Vihma 2014[)]{.underline}.
[Thus, [climate change is]{.mark} not only [an opportunity for]{.mark}
**large-scale [resource extraction]{.mark}** in the Arctic, [but also a
challenge to]{.mark} Arctic and [**global sustainability** which,
in]{.mark} its [turn]{.mark}, can **[reduce viability]{.mark}** for
Arctic [energy development]{.mark} (Harsem et al. 2011). In this way,
the **[recent]{.mark} spate of [interest]{.mark}** [in Arctic mineral
wealth marks a **contradictory relationship** between **energy and
environment**]{.mark}**al discourses** (Palosaari and Tynkkynen
2015).]{.underline} The ambitious international goal of limiting global
warming to below 2°C, adopted at the 2015 Paris Climate Conference
(COP21), infers a concrete need for a global energy transition. This in
turn, given the best available knowledge on the dynamics of climate
change, is incompatible with hydrocarbon development in the Arctic. Up
until today, the Arctic has been a 'net energy exporter' whilst the
local use of energy, even in the form of fossil fuels, has made only a
marginal contribution to world greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,
particularly in comparison to the use of Arctic-origin oil and gas
elsewhere in the world. Thus the Arctic has been placed at the heart of
climate debates, but effectively has little to offer the global energy
transition besides 'remaining untouched'. What makes its position more
problematic is that whether it remains untouched or not is a decision
over which 'the Arctic' itself, as the region above the Arctic Circle,
has little decision-making power.

Disconnecting Arctic from global energy flows, however, goes against the
dominant and embedded colonial logic that has promoted Arctic
exploration for the past four centuries. Resource colonialism manifests
itself not only through extending extractive frontiers, but also through
interpreting industrialization as a form of development that benefits
extractive communities by resolving economic under-development (Bunker
and Ciccantell 2005). Energy companies in the Arctic have largely
adopted a developmentalist rhetoric that views the industrialization of
the Arctic as 'bringing civilization', primarily in the form of
infrastructure, to the remote communities in the region and thereby
increasing social well-being (Tynkkynen 2016). Tynkkynen has explained
this rhetoric as a manifestation of 'energopower' (ibid.). In its
ultimate form, the argument promulgated by the energy companies suggests
that abandoning Arctic energy projects will throw the region and its
communities back into an 'underdeveloped' state and increase the
vulnerability of local communities. [However, by highlighting the role
of capital and technology as a way to ensure a balance between
socio-economic and environmental aspects of Arctic development, [this
interpretation subordinates the Arctic]{.mark} periphery [to]{.mark}
**'[the center]{.mark}'** whilst [neglecting]{.mark} the many
[**contradictions** between]{.mark} **resource [extraction and
sustainable development]{.mark}** highlighted above.]{.underline}

A different perspective on local, Arctic meanings of sustainability has
been offered by non-governmental organizations (NGOs), advocacy
coalitions and academics, who have raised concerns over the future of
the Arctic and the planet, in particular when opposing further
exploration of Arctic oil and gas resources. Through a series of public
campaigns, including the 'Arctic Sunrise' protest action organized by
Greenpeace in 2013 against Arctic drilling at the Prirazlomnaya
platform, activists attempted to draw media attention to the
controversies related to Arctic hydrocarbon exploration, and to present
distant consumers of fossil fuels with an understanding of the social
and environmental impacts of Arctic energy exploration and production.
Critical scholarship disproved the conventional accounts of
post-industrial society for their tendency 'to underrepresent the
continued significance of primary resources to the experience of
everyday life' (Bridge 2001: 2149), and demonstrated how Arctic energy
developments restrict local inhabitants, including indigenous peoples,
in carrying on with their livelihoods (Stammler 2005). At the same time,
it shows that an extreme environmentalist desire of turning the Arctic
into a global sanctuary is also not a flawless plan, as it ignores the
fact that the Arctic is home to 4 million people who want to preserve
their traditional lifestyle whilst enjoying the latest advances of
technology.

One way of re-thinking Arctic energy development in a way that is
compatible with the ideas of Arctic sustainability, rather than with
discourses from outside the region, could be through enabling a more
localised energy transition. Energy supply from renewable sources in
remote off-the-grid areas can increase the resilience of Arctic
communities, but also prevent path dependencies associated with
technological lock-ins created by large infrastructure (AREWG n.d.;
Collier 2011). Self-sufficiency through renewable energy supply would
offer an important alternative to reliance on energy infrastructures
built within large energy development projects. Remote off-the-grid
areas could benefit from renewable and hybrid (wind-diesel and
solar-diesel) energy systems if policy incentives were put in place
(Boute 2016). Currently, however, renewable energy in Arctic communities
is restricted to not more than a handful of pilot projects. It may be
assumed that in the early stages a combination of private and public
finance would be the most viable option for creating demonstration cases
and exploring future business models. Yet, who will take a lead in
pushing for Arctic energy transition remains to be seen.

This chapter has interpreted the Arctic political economy through the
lenses of resource colonialism. It has shown that over the past four
centuries the quest for natural, in particular energy, resources has
been the major driver for Western peoples to penetrate and explore the
Arctic region. Natural resource endowments have contributed to
constructing the Arctic region as a 'commodity-supply space' (Bridge
2001). Populations of whales and other marine mammals, deposits of coal,
oil and gas in the Circumpolar North have been interpreted as 'Arctic
riches' and exported as valuable commodities to distant consumer
markets. Forces driving the incorporation of the Arctic into the global
energy economy have come from outside the Arctic region and this is also
where the benefits of the Arctic exploitation were mainly felt. The
scarcity of local population has added to an image of the Arctic as a
terra nullius, a people-less space that can be understood and discovered
through geology and law. Severe climatic conditions have brought a
romantic flavor to Western narratives of Arctic development as heroic
exploration, making the High North an articulation of human bravery and
technological progress. From whale oil to offshore drilling, the
patterns of material production in the Arctic corresponded to
international energy flows, thereby embedding the history of Arctic
exploration within human energy history more broadly.

Since the late 2000s, changes in the natural environment coupled with
assessments of Arctic hydrocarbon deposits presented by geoscientists,
attractive investment packages produced by energy consultancies, and the
mounting energy needs of the developing world, have prompted advances in
policies and technologies for extraction and transportation of Arctic
resources. Discourses on energy policy articulated by actors from
outside the Arctic produced an image of the Arctic as a 'final
extractive frontier,' defining the Arctic in a resource-geographical
way. These discourses on 'Arctic riches', embedded within the broader
international political economy of energy, acted as a form of
entitlement to pursue extractive activities in the Arctic. As
demonstrated in this chapter, the concept of resource colonialism
provides a powerful tool to deconstruct the complex web of expectations
about Arctic energy futures. In particular, it shows how the remoteness
of the Arctic from industrial and financial centers that has been
previously leveraged through Arctic resource endowment has acquired a
new dimension with the ever-tighter incorporation of the Arctic into the
global energy system.

Until recently, the degree of apparent resource availability in the
Arctic has been the prime justification for public and private
investment into the large-scale industrialization of the High North.
Yet, the fact that oil and gas can be produced with greater ease and at
less expense in many other parts of the world, together with the growing
viability of alternative energy sources in the global energy mix and the
global drop in oil price, have undermined interest in Arctic energy
development. As the peripheral Arctic was becoming the global Arctic,
its image as a remote resource base increasingly came into conflict with
intensifying concerns over the environmental status of the Arctic and
the planetary consequences of Arctic climate change. With the increasing
salience of climate issues in global energy governance, Arctic
hydrocarbons are no longer considered solely as a source of energy, but
also as a source of pollution. The shift from the 'old' (extraction and
consumption of fossil fuels) to the 'new' (clean energy, carbon markets
and offsetting) carbon governance (Bridge 2011) has also impacted the
cost structure of Arctic energy, adding the cost of carbon mitigation to
already costly exploration and transportation.

[The core [controversies of Arctic]{.mark} energy development [result
from]{.mark} the **[globalization]{.mark} of the Arctic** made manifest
through its becoming [embedded within]{.mark} **[global commodity chains
and]{.mark} global [climate governance]{.mark}**. Thus we are at the
stage when the global Arctic is [simultaneously seen as]{.mark} an
**[empty]{.mark} space** [to]{.mark} be **[conquer]{.mark}ed [and
benefit]{.mark}ed** [from and, in]{.mark} strict [contrast]{.mark}, as
[a **fragile space** to]{.mark} be **[protect]{.mark}ed [and
preserve]{.mark}d**.]{.underline} The tension between these two
narratives marks a significant change in the international political
economy of energy that underpins contemporary post-industrial capitalism
and offers an entry point into conversations that frame the
energy-climate nexus as 'carbon governance' (Bridge 2011). Arguably, the
ways in which material activities will be organized in the future are
inherently connected to the political choices that prioritize the image
of the Arctic as an extractive frontier or as a global sanctuary.

Modalities of Decarbonisation and Mining

[The **mining industry**]{.underline} "sees itself as being proud to
part of the solution to climate change" and [is "**aiming** to be seen
as the '**good guys**', helping to drive the world\'s energy
transition]{.underline}" (Russell 2022). In this context, [a
"**[renewable energy]{.mark}**" **transition** [that relies on]{.mark} a
significant [expansion of **mineral** and **metal extraction** provides
a **convenient stage** on which]{.mark} mining **[companies]{.mark}**
are able to [cast themselves as]{.mark} a **[necessary]{.mark} partner**
in achieving **global sustainability**]{.underline}, a defining feature
of what Voskoboynik and Andreucci (2022) have described as [the "era of
green extractivism", [justifying **endless extraction**]{.mark} as a
**condition** for solving **climate change**]{.underline} (Dunlap and
Jakobsen 2020; Riofrancos 2019). The promise of a sustainable future
facilitated by the expansion of (critical) mineral intensive
technologies spans the political, the economic, and the environmental,
and [it underlies the "**climatization** of **extractive
industries**]{.underline}" (Buu-Sao et al. 2023). At the same time,
[these companies must contend with the industry\'s **long** and often
**violent history** of social **conflict** and environmental
**degradation**]{.underline}. [**Reputational risks** threaten the
**industry\'s growth**]{.underline}, especially as mining companies turn
their attention to deposits in Europe and North America. The Serbian
government\'s recent decision to revoke Rio Tinto\'s mining permits to
extract lithium-rich jadarite in the country\'s idyllic Jadar Valley,
for example, was precipitated by environmental protests that often
focused on Rio Tinto\'s unsavoury reputation, which is widely associated
with scandals like illegal dumping and even murder (Boffey 2021; Kleitsa
2021; Sekularac 2022). Analysis from the Serbian research firm Demostat
suggests that, as the government re-negotiates access to its country\'s
lithium reserves with companies in the future, it will likely look for a
partner "whose reputation is not damaged" ("čija reputacija nije
narušena"), at least relative to Rio Tinto\'s (Terzić 2022).

To avoid these kinds of setbacks, [mining companies have worked hard to
**embrace** and **perform** a discourse of
sustainability-as-decarbonisation through **energy storage**
solutions]{.underline} in at least three discrete but connected ways.
The first is the increasingly ubiquitous and taken-for-granted narrative
that sustainability requires more minerals and metals, and thus more
mining---"decarbonisation through mining". The second is the claim that
mining itself can become more sustainable through the adoption of
"smart", electrified operations, or what we describe as "decarbonisation
of mining". The third is an attempt to extend the lifespan of defunct
(and by extension, existing and future) mines by transforming them into
part of physical infrastructure of large-scale energy storage systems,
specifically through pumped hydro energy storage and compressed air
energy storage. This section takes each of these modalities of mine
decarbonisation in turn.

Decarbonisation through Mining

In his introduction to the company\'s 2021 sustainability report, [the
CEO of Albemarle]{.underline}, [one of the world\'s largest [**lithium**
miners]{.mark}]{.underline}, wrote that "\[o\]ur business plays an
important role in combating climate change and helping the world
transition to a green economy. Our products and services make the world
safer and more sustainable, and we pride ourselves on doing the right
things, the right way, with the right resources" (Albemarle 2022:5). The
report goes on to provide snapshots of the company\'s lithium and
bromine businesses, with headings like "Lithium---Enabling the EV
Revolution" and "Bromine---Providing Critical Minerals for
Electrification and Digitalization" (Albemarle 2022:15, 17). In 2019,
the sustainability manager of a small British mining company, Cornish
Lithium, gave a talk at TEDxTruro titled "Mining Our Way to a Low Carbon
Future". She [began her talk with a **provocation**]{.underline}: "I
care deeply about the environment, which is why I work in the mining
industry. Do you think that makes me a hypocrite? Because a lot of
people do, and I\'m getting fed up with it" (Crane 2019). Arguing that
[climate change is "the biggest environmental threat \[we have faced\]
in generations]{.underline}", she insisted that "[**low carbon
tech**nologies" are **needed** to "**combat**" this threat. "To make
these low carbon technologies, we actually need to mine more raw
materials than we ever have done in the past]{.underline}" (ibid.).
[With **no**]{.underline} obvious [**awareness** of the socio-ecological
**implications** of this massive expansion of **extractive
frontiers**]{.underline}, [she **[claim]{.mark}**ed that [humans]{.mark}
will [need to mine the **same amount** of **copper** over the next
**25 years** as we have mined over the last **5,000**]{.mark} years in
order to meet our renewable energy **targets**]{.underline}.

[Lithium companies]{.underline} like Albemarle and Cornish Lithium are
but **[two]{.underline}** examples [among **many other**]{.underline}
industry actor**[s]{.underline}** [promoting the idea that **more
mining** is necessary to achieve rapid **decarbonisation**]{.underline}.
A 2020 report from the World Bank\'s Climate-Smart Mining Facility
provided several estimates of the massive growth of mineral and metal
extraction needed to facilitate the so-called energy transition. One of
the report\'s findings was that "the relative demand for energy storage,
particularly with respect to energy storage for transportation, is
expected to rise dramatically by 2050" (World Bank 2020:35), summarising
its findings with the [observation that]{.underline} "[greater **climate
ambition** leads to greater overall **mineral demand**]{.underline}"
(World Bank 2020:62). [This [**claim** has become]{.mark} increasingly
**[ubiquitous]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Recent headlines in the Wall
Street Journal and on the BBC website, for instance, claim that "'net
zero' will mean a mining boom" (Yergin 2023) and that the "move to net
zero 'inevitably means more mining'" (Amos 2021). These [analyses
contain startling figures]{.underline}. After describing the quantities
of critical minerals and metals required to meet the UK\'s 2030 electric
vehicle plans, the BBC article goes on to claim that "\[r\]eplacing the
estimated 1.4 billion internal combustion engine vehicles worldwide
would need 40 times these quantities, and that\'s before the metal and
mineral requirements of all the wind turbines and solar farms are
considered" (Amos 2021). [Within these narratives, the
**[mining]{.mark}** industry [emerges as a **key facilitator**]{.mark}
of the energy transition, a **necessary partner** in the production of
the minerals and metals such a **transition** will
**require**]{.underline}.

\[Text Condensed, None Omitted\]

Decarbonisation of Mining Mining is a dirty industry. In addition to the
various toxic pollutants generated through extraction and refining (e.g.
as tailings), Azadi et al. (2020) estimate that "greenhouse gas
emissions associated with primary mineral and metal production was
equivalent to approximately 10% of the total global energy-related
greenhouse gas emissions in 2018". Efforts to reduce the carbon
intensity of mining have focused on electrification, but there are
several obstacles. First, many large mining sites are in remote,
inhospitable environments like deserts or hundreds of miles north of the
Arctic Circle. This means they are disconnected from national electrical
grids and rely instead on internal combustion engines to power vehicles
and generators, or even coal to power other, more energy-intensive
mining equipment like crushers, grinder mills, and smelters. Second,
mining operations have to run more or less constantly to ensure
profitability. Interruptions to energy supply can cost millions of
dollars, and the variable nature of solar panels and windmills (which
require sunlight and wind to generate electricity) makes these too risky
to use on their own. These potential obstacles for decarbonisation were
centre stage at the Electric Mine conference in 2023. Where only 150
people attended the first edition of the conference, held in Toronto in
2019, by 2023 in Tucson that number had grown to 730 participants. For
2024 in Perth, conference organisers expect yet another record-breaking
attendance. Despite the veiled scepticism with which some participants
in the Electric Mine hushed their views on the limits to electrification
efforts currently embraced by the industry, there was an undeniable
feeling that the current moment represented "a fantastic opportunity to
our industry"---a point repeatedly emphasised throughout the conference.
According to a senior sustainability manager of a Scandinavian
manufacturer of mining and infrastructure equipment, "We must be mindful
that the energy transition implies a shift from dependence on fossil
fuels to dependence on metals". As if the point might have been lost, he
immediately answers his own question: "Who will produce these metals?
It\'s us." These conversations are taking place in a context where major
consulting and engineering firms have been enthusiastically promoting
the electrification of mining operations. One of these companies is the
Swedish-Swiss engineering firm ABB, which has become one of the most
prominent actors in the mine electrification space through its eMine
suite of products and services. On its website, the eMine is explicitly
advertised as a low-carbon solution to the unsustainability of mining,
claiming that this technology "is helping mining companies around the
world create carbon emissions-free mines".4 A collection of factoids
further reinforces the idea that decarbonisation through the
electrification of mining equipment, trucks in particular, generates
significant sustainability impacts: If every truck in every mine were
electrified, every day we could remove 198,000 tons of CO2 from the air
we breathe. Electrifying a single mining truck can help save the coral
reefs by lowering the ocean\'s CO2 absorption by up to 1,000 tons a
year. Electrifying a single mining truck eliminates enough CO2 emissions
per year to save 3,000 m2 of arctic ice. Electrifying a single mining
truck eliminates the same amount of CO2 emissions per year that it would
take 46,000 trees to absorb.5 ABB\'s website features companies like the
Swedish mining company Boliden, which, by adopting ABB\'s eMine
technology, is on "the journey towards a fossil-free mine". In Tucson
2023, ABB\'s senior representatives presented the company\'s project to
"decarbonis\[e\] the mining industry 'from grid-to-wheel'". The "future
of mine electrification", for these global heads, entailed
decarbonisation and integration of renewable energies. Beneath this
shiny veneer of decarbonised mining, however, ABB makes another promise:
components of the eMine system can substantially reduce diesel
consumption (by up to 90% according to ABB\'s marketing materials),6
thus substantially reducing energy costs while at the same time
improving "mine performance". Although a Deloitte report notes that
"mine electrification and energy storage" have been "mainly driven by
liability, regulation and resource capacity, rather than by value
creation", it goes on to argue that these kinds of technological
innovations "can lower the costs, dangers and environmental impacts
associated with mining ever-deeper deposits, helping to ensure that
operations remain profitable and sustainable over time" (Deloitte
2023:11, 23). Importantly, current efforts to electrify mining
operations are anchored in the early adoption of reserve energy
solutions needed to operate in inhospitable conditions: from thousands
of meters underground to the Arctic Circle. This was the main gist of
the message brought by the principal key expert for rail electrification
and the business development manager for a large multinational
technology conglomerate to the Electric Mine conference in 2023. As the
expert put it in his presentation of trolley-assist infrastructure to
enable zero emission haul trucks, "we provide electrification solutions,
not because of the Paris accord, or the emissions goals ... it\'s in our
DNA". Although some of these electrification solutions have been
deployed for decades, sustaining the decarbonisation discourse calls for
new battery-driven power delivery, as captured in the title of one
presentation at the Electric Mine: "Trolley trucks are dead! Long live
battery trucks!" Similar industry events dedicated to energy and mining
have taken place across the world. In November 2022, Enlit Africa hosted
a week-long "digital dialogue" on the topic of power and mining,
focusing on issues like energy security and grid stability in
sub-Saharan Africa. Against this backdrop, both the analyst and the
moderator could agree that "self-generation of electricity as a positive
step ... to ensure the sustainability of mining, to grow mining, and
eventually get the economic growth we want for this country, as we know
mining is the base of our economy currently". The key to this will be
improving energy storage systems. "Battery technologies are out there,
and they are changing continuously." In addition to the well-known
lithium-ion batteries, there are vanadium redox flow batteries where the
reactants are "not diminished" like they are with lithium-ion batteries.
The challenge, however, is that the mining industry requires an immense
amount of energy storage capacity and for much longer time periods than
much of the current battery technology can provide. "We are hoping that
as the technology grows, \[the storage capacity and duration\] will
increase." Here, the moderator jumped in: "Obviously, the kind of
battery technology that you use is going to depend very much on, are you
looking for long duration battery storage, are you looking for something
just to tide you over in the course of, say, load shedding, and each one
of these battery solutions has a different purpose. You know 100
megawatts of batteries is great but it\'s not nearly enough for the
annual load or the daily load that is being seen in this country even
just within the mining sector." To the extent that the mining industry
can electrify and decarbonise its operations, energy storage emerges in
these different contexts as the most important piece of the puzzle. In
the opening session of the Enlit Africa workshop, which targeted
professionals working in the sub-Saharan African mining and energy
industries, the moderator noted that, although any organisation\'s first
step should be to "evaluate and optimise its processes and then
introduce new efficiency measures in order to reduce electricity and
energy demand", the next, and arguably much bigger, step is to introduce
new energy sources and new energy storage capabilities. Her
interlocutor, an economist and technology analyst at the Minerals
Council of South Africa, reinforced this idea. The South African public
energy utility Eskom is unable to provide the energy needed, which not
only threatens the profitability of South African mining operations, but
also threatens the health and safety of those working in the mines.
This, combined with the "skyrocketing" cost of electricity over the last
decade has meant that mines are not able to grow, new mines are too
expensive to open, and nearly half of the country\'s smelting industry
has had to close. Companies that used to operate in South Africa because
of lower energy costs are now, according to this analyst, moving to
countries like China and Malaysia. This has significant knock-on
effects, including an increase in national unemployment figures.
Decarbonisation of Mines The final modality of decarbonisation concerns
the mines themselves or, more accurately, the significant amounts of
carbon emitted during the process of excavating them. New energy storage
technologies like pumped hydro energy storage and compressed air energy
storage rely on large pits or caverns that can be filled with water, in
the case of pumped hydro, or air, in the case of compressed air. In the
former, two large pits at different altitudes are used to store water.
During peak energy production times (i.e. during the day for solar power
and when it is windy for windmills), excess energy is used to pump water
from the lower pit to the higher pit; during peak demand (particularly
during moments when more energy is demanded than produced), water flows
naturally (using gravity) from the higher pit to the lower pit,
generating energy as it passes a turbine. Compressed air energy storage
works in a similar way, using excess energy to pump air into an
underground cavern and releasing the air to spin a turbine and generate
electricity when demand exceeds the available supply. For many, these
technologies offer a way to revitalise defunct mine sits, whether an
open pit mine that can be re-appropriated as a pit to store water for
pumped hydro energy storage systems or underground mines that can be
retrofitted as the cavern for a compressed air energy storage system.
Where the electrification of mining trucks points to the "mine of the
future", these technologies are invoked as a way of addressing mining\'s
dirty past by extending the lifespan of carbon intensive mines. In
particular, they offer a solution to both the blasted landscapes and the
post-industrial malaise that are typically associated with depleted
mining sites (Dahlgren 2022; Tsing 2014). These "afterlives of
extraction" are often characterised by companies that leave local
communities to bear the burden of poorly managed toxic waste and the
sudden disappearance of a major employer (Calvão et al. 2023). When a
deposit of valuable minerals or metals is depleted (or when it becomes
too expensive to justify further investments in extraction), mining
companies will quickly cease their operations, and it can be difficult
for local and even national governments to force those companies to
sufficiently remediate the polluted sites they leave behind or
financially support the large numbers of newly unemployed locals and
those working in the service economy who depend on them. Companies like
Hydrostor (Canada) and Genex (Australia) have proposed one solution to
the problem of depleted mines, offering the option of "revitalising" old
mines as pumped hydro energy storage infrastructures. Pumped hydro is a
type of energy storage that uses either compressed air in a cavern full
of water or two pools of water at different heights to power turbines
and generate electricity. The air is compressed or the water is pumped
uphill using energy generated during peak production times (such as noon
on a sunny day for solar power) and stored until that excess energy is
needed at some other time (such as after sunset for solar power).
Proponents of pumped hydro claim that it can extend the lifespan of a
mine by giving it a second life as an energy storage infrastructure. One
project, managed by the company Genex and partially funded by the
Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA), transformed a depleted gold
mine in Queensland into a pumped hydro facility, which included the
installation of a large solar farm next to two cavernous pits. Hydrostar
also has an eye on Australia\'s abundant profusion of defunct mines,
with plans to "re-purpose the former Angas Zinc Mine at Strathalbyn \[in
South Australia\] into the 5MW / 10MWh facility by transforming the
existing mine into an air-storage cavern 240m below ground ... to
achieve emissions-free energy storage" (Energy Source & Distribution
2019). Although this technology is not new---the tech magazine Wired
published a story more than a decade ago claiming that "bottled wind
could be as constant as coal" (Madrigal 2010)---it is only recently that
the cost of renewable energy has fallen low enough to justify investing
in this kind of energy storage technology. The business case is
apparently very strong: in early 2022, the industry publication Utility
Dive reported that Hydrostor had secured \$250m from Goldman Sachs "amid
rising investor interest in long-duration storage" (Plautz 2022).
Extending the lifespan of these depleted mines by transforming them from
expensive "environmental liabilities" into useful energy storage systems
contributes to decarbonisation efforts. As Lyu et al. (2022) observed,
the construction of a mine shaft is carbon intensive, alongside numerous
other socio-ecological effects. Extending the life of a mine through its
re-appropriation as energy storage infrastructure not only helps
mitigate the lingering threat of emissions from poorly managed mines (a
problem with coal mines, in particular, where residual coal seams can
spontaneously combust), but also re-frames the substantial emissions
associated with excavation as something that can suddenly be spread out
over a much longer time period.7 Energy Storage and Green Extractivism
Energy storage plays a prominent---if not central---role in sustaining
these modalities of decarbonisation. In each of these modalities,
moreover, energy storage emerges as both an infrastructural ecology and
as a crucial medium and mediator of capitalist value. Narratives of an
energy transition that rely on "renewable" energy derived from wind and
sunshine invariably mobilise the "variability" caveat to emphasise the
pressing need for more and better energy storage capacity, essentially
to make renewable energy behave like non-renewable energy. This is
especially evident in the first two modalities, where both mining
companies and (inter)national governments insist that the energy
transition only works if there is a massive, rapid expansion of energy
storage. This narrative not only demands more mining, but justifies it,
all while offering a convenient way for mining companies themselves to
"walk the talk" by battery-powering their own operations, constructing
microgrids to green remote operations and installing batteries on
diggers, trucks, and conveyor belts. In these approaches to a
sustainable future, batteries and other forms of energy storage become
important infrastructures that make energy available when it is needed.
Minerals and metals are important components of this material
infrastructure, from the lithium inside lithium-ion batteries to the
steel and copper that encase and connect batteries to grids to the
various resources used in the production of windmills and solar panels.
But energy storage also serves as a discursive infrastructure, where a
discourse of sustainability that relies on decarbonisation through
energy storage comes to be an infrastructure itself (Rao 2023),
connecting the ecologies of extraction (lithium extraction, in
particular) to the (anti-)politics of sustainability-as-decarbonisation.
These energy storage arrangements thus become infrastructural ecologies
in two ways: materially, as a physical connection between minerals and
metals extracted from the earth, transformed into the turbines,
generators, wires, and batteries that power automobiles, homes, and
factories; and discursively, as a bridge between ever-expanding
extractive frontiers and an imaginary of a post-carbon, "sustainable"
future of both mining, energy, and society. In the first two modalities
of decarbonisation, energy storage becomes a source of untapped
financial value for mining companies. As demand for renewable energy
generation and storage grows, the demand for products that only mining
companies can produce also grows, from lithium and cobalt and manganese
to copper and aluminium. Energy storage also enhances the profitability
of companies by allowing them to shift their own operations to renewable
energy, allowing them to operate without interruption as if their
operations were still powered by the ostensibly more reliable diesel
generators, particularly in areas where national power grids are
unreliable. Discursively, this allows them to present themselves as both
sustainable (because they use renewable energy to extract) and the key
to sustainability (because the resources they extract are necessary
inputs to the technologies the sustainability transition relies on); it
facilities the climatisation of the extractives industry and its
operations (Buu-Sao et al. 2023). If the goal of for-profit companies is
to extract as much profit as possible, then energy storage emerges as a
convenient reserve of both economic and moral value that mining
companies (and perhaps mining companies alone) are well-positioned to
exploit. In the third modality of decarbonisation, the infrastructural
ecology of energy storage comes to the fore. Landscapes that have been
blasted and scarred by centuries of increasingly violent extraction
become refashioned as a potential infrastructure of a sustainable energy
future; for mining companies, these sites transform from liabilities to
new investment opportunities. The project overview for the Genex/ARENA
pumped hydro project in Queensland noted that there were in fact
numerous defunct open pit mines in the region that could be transformed
into energy generation and storage facilities. These distinctions are
not rigid. Decarbonisation through and of mining, while enhancing the
profitability of mining firms through various mechanisms, also
highlights the extent to which energy futures are entangled with
political ecologies across different spatial and temporal scales. And
while the re-appropriation of defunct mining sites as energy storage
sites is a clear example of storage as an infrastructural ecology,
inextricable from the socioecologies in which it is embedded, it also
helps mining companies make claims to their long-term economic value by
implying that not only defunct mines, but also future mines that will
eventually and inevitably become defunct, can be reappropriated as
energy storage infrastructure. This justifies continued mining, even for
metals and minerals not directly linked to the energy transition. In the
process, the earth itself becomes a repository---a store---of the metals
and minerals required by an energy transition designed to maintain the
status quo, of untapped financial value for mining companies and their
investors, and of the potentialities of sustainable futures. This
observation resonates with ecofeminist critiques of the "mastery" of
nature, where nature is seen, among other things, as feminised store of
resources for mankind to exploit through "modernity" and "progress"
(see, e.g., Plumwood 2002). More recently, theories of the "planetary
mine" have made a similar point, arguing the planet itself is
increasingly treated as a repository of minerals for human---or more
accurately, capitalist---exploitation (Arboleda 2020; Labban 2013). If
this is the status quo under capitalism, then it has been reproduced and
reinforced in recent years by narratives of eco-modernisation and green
growth, propagated by powerful industry and government ideologues who
insist that market-driven technological advances can "solve" the climate
crisis without sacrificing or undermining economic growth. Paying
attention to industry narratives around decarbonisation reveals three
modalities of decarbonisation that each revolve around energy storage.
This sheds light on the expansionary dynamics of green extractivism,
which mining companies both promote and obscure by approaching the earth
as a repository of value, materials, and futures from which only they
can successfully (which here means profitably) extract. Centring
decarbonisation helps legitimise this approach, forestalling other
approaches on the grounds that they are not taking the issue of
decarbonisation seriously enough.

Conclusion

In a moment when [**[mining]{.mark}** companies are]{.underline} moving
into the centre of global sustainability efforts, [[lauded for]{.mark}
doing what they have done with increasingly [**detrimental effects**
on]{.mark} increasingly **[vast scales]{.mark}** for **decades**, and
even **centuries**]{.underline} (see, e.g., Hilson et al. 2019; Selwyn
2022), [it is important to understand how]{.underline} the logic of
[[**green extractivism** continues to **expand**]{.underline}]{.mark}. A
key piece of the puzzle, we argue, is [the [**conflation** of
**sustainability** with **decarbonisation**]{.mark}]{.underline}, which
[[allows]{.mark} policymakers, **[corporate]{.mark}** managers, and
investors [to frame anything that]{.mark} purportedly
**[reduces]{.mark}** carbon [**emissions** as
**sustainable**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[while]{.mark}
concomitantly]{.underline} (and crucially) [framing initiatives that
fail to prioritise decarbonisation as **unsustainable**]{.underline}.
Tenuous [[**critiques** of **degrowth**]{.underline}]{.mark}, for
instance, often [[argue]{.mark} that **degrowth** theories focus too
narrowly on GDP at the expense of carbon emissions]{.underline},
[insisting]{.underline} ([[for some **baffling reason** given]{.mark}
the **empirical [evidence]{.mark}**]{.underline}) [[that **GDP** and

Imperialism and Anti-imperialism in an Era of Extractive Capitalism

The [[neoliberal "structural reform" agenda]{.mark} of the Washington
Consensus [facilitated]{.mark} a [massive inflow of **capital**]{.mark}
in the form of foreign direct investments directed [towards]{.mark}
non-traditional manufacturing, financial and high-tech information-rich
services, and [natural resource extraction]{.mark}.]{.underline} The
1990s saw a six-fold increase in the inflows of FDI in the first four
years of the decade and then another sharp increase from 1996 to 2001;
in fewer than 10 years the foreign capital accumulated by MNCs
(multinational companies) in the region had tripled (ECLAC Citation2012,
71) while profits soared. John Saxe-Fernández, a well-known Mexico-based
political economist, determined that [over the course of the decade the
inflow of FDI had netted enormous profits, reflected in the net outflow
of US\$100 billion over the entire decade]{.underline} (Saxe-Fernández
and Núñez Citation2001).

Another major inflow occurred in the first decade of the new millennium
in the context of a major expansion in the worldwide demand for natural
resources and a consequent primary commodities boom in South America
(Ocampo Citation2007). [As shown by data presented in table 1 this [boom
in the export of primary commodities in the energy sector of
fossil]{.mark} and biofuels [(oil]{.mark} [and gas), as well as minerals
and metals]{.mark}, and agrofood products primarily affected South
America, [which]{.mark} [led]{.mark} a worldwide trend [to]{.mark}wards
the (re)primarization of exports from the periphery of the system and
[the expansion of **extractive capitalism.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Table 1. Exports of primary products (percentage of total exports).

[The main targets and destination points for FDI in Latin America over
the past two decades have been services (particularly banking and
finance) and the natural resources sector: the **[exploration,
extraction, and exploitation of]{.mark}** fossil and biofuel sources of
energy, **precious [metals and industrial minerals]{.mark}**, and
agrofood products. In the previous era of state-led development, FDI had
predominantly [served as]{.mark} a [means of financing the capitalist
development of industry]{.mark} and a process of "productive
transformation"]{.underline} (technological conversion and
modernization), [which was reflected in the geo-economics of global
capital and the dynamics of capital flows at the time.]{.underline}
However, the new world order and two generations of neoliberal reforms
dramatically improved conditions for capital, opening up in Latin
America the market for goods manufactured in the North (the United
States, Canada, and Europe) and providing greater opportunities for
resource-seeking capital---consolidating the role of Latin America as a
source and supplier of natural resources and exporter of primary
commodities, a role that is reflected in the flows of productive
investment in the region away towards the extractive industries
(see table 2).

Table 2. Percentage distribution of FDI by sector in Latin America.

At the turn into the new millennium the service sector accounted for
almost half of FDI inflows, but data presented by ECLAC (Citation2012,
50) point towards a steady and increasing flow of capital towards the
natural resources sector in South America, especially mining, where
Canadian capital took a predominant position, accounting for up to 70%
of FDI in this sector (Arellano Citation2010). Over the course of the
first decade in the new millennium the share of "resource-seeking"
capital in total FDI increased from 10 to 30%. In 2006, the inflow of
"resource-seeking" investment capital grew by 49% to reach US\$59
billion, which exceeded the total FDI inflows of any year since economic
liberalization began in the 1990s (UNCTAD Citation2007, 53).

Despite the global financial and economic crisis at the time, FDI flows
towards Latin America and the Caribbean reached a record high in 2008
(US\$128.3 billion), an extraordinary development considering that FDI
flows worldwide at the time had shrunk by at least 15%. This
countercyclical trend signalled the continuation of the primary
commodities boom and the steady expansion of resource-seeking capital in
the region.

[The rapid [expansion]{.mark} in the flow [of FDI towards Latin
America]{.mark} in the 1990s [reflected]{.mark} the increased
[opportunities for capital accumulation]{.mark} provided by the
neoliberal policy regimes in the region, but in the new millennium
conditions for capitalist development had radically
changed.]{.underline} In this new context, which included a major
realignment of economic power and relations of trade in the world
market, and the growth in both the demand for and the prices of primary
commodities[, the shift of FDI towards Latin America signified a major
change in the geo-economics and geopolitics of global
capital.]{.underline} Flows of FDI into Latin America from 2000 to 2007
for the first time exceeded those that went to America, only surpassed
by Europe and Asia. [And the global financial crisis brought about an
even more radical change in the geo-economics of global capital in
regard to both its regional distribution]{.underline} (increased flows
to Latin America) [and sectoral distribution (concentration in the
extractive sector). In 2005, the "developing" and "emerging" economies
attracted only 12% of global flows of productive capital but by 2010,
against a background of a sharp decline in these flows, these economies
were the destination point for over 50% of global FDI flows]{.underline}
(CEPAL Citation2012, 5). [In the same year, FDI flows into Latin America
increased by 34.6%, well above the growth rate in Asia, which was only
6.7%]{.underline} (UNCTAD Citation2012, 52--54).

[The [flow of productive capital into Latin America]{.mark} has been
[fueled by]{.mark} two factors: high prices for primary commodities,
which attracted "[natural-resource-seeking]{.mark} investment," and the
economic growth of the South American sub-region, [which encouraged
market-seeking investment]{.mark}.]{.underline} This flow of FDI was
concentrated in four South American countries---Argentina, Brazil,
Chile, and Colombia---which accounted for 89% of the sub-region\'s total
inflows. The extractive industry in these countries, particularly
mining, absorbed the greatest share of these inflows. For example, in
2009, Latin America received 26% of global investments in mineral
exploration (Sena-Fobomade Citation2011). [Together with the expansion
of oil and gas projects, [mineral extraction constitutes]{.mark} the
single [most important source of export revenues]{.mark} for most
countries in the region.]{.underline}

This dissertation has shown that the [[U.S.]{.mark} Department of the
Interior]{.underline} [consistently and paradoxically haunted every
meaningful threshold of U.S. expansionism. It has [mapped]{.mark} an
[alternate geography]{.mark} of the Cold War]{.underline}, one that, far
from the "Iron Curtain" in Europe, [[began with material pursuits in the
American West]{.mark}, [circled the global South, and departed the
atmosphere with the launch of satellites to spy earth
resources.]{.mark}]{.underline} Although these different spatial scales,
cutting indiscriminately across political and terrestrial borders, have
never before been viewed as part of the same story, I have attempted to
show that they were, in fact, inextricably linked through the
institutional contortionism of the Interior Department. The Interior
Department pursued ever-widening resource frontiers because, in reality,
expansion was integral to its institutional continuation. Since its
origins in U.S. settler colonialism, the department functioned to bring
external lands and resources within the United States territorial body.
As the department became increasingly diversified and specialized, it
merely rerouted these functions through is different branches, including
the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Office of the Territories, Geological
Survey, and Bureau of Mines. [[As territorialization fell out of
favor]{.mark} with the rise of anti imperialist sentiment and
codification of sovereignty in the postwar era, the [Interior Department
adopted]{.mark} increasingly [clandestine methods predicated on
technical assistance to achieve the same material
ends.]{.mark}]{.underline} Thus, technocratic projects from the Point
Four program to space and ocean exploration became key arenas of the
department's extractive regimen. While Interior personnel pursued
ever-widening mineral frontiers, they never 305 ceased to target Native
American resources. Thus, [U.S. global domination and Native American
oppression were tightly linked in the Cold War.]{.underline} At the same
time, the Interior Department completed crucial spadework to further the
global reach of American capitalism. Through its burgeoning
involvements, Interior helped create an infrastructure for extraction in
nations throughout the global South. In the 1950s, this infrastructure
rather straightforwardly included pickaxes, cameras, jeeps, chemistry
labs, haulage ways, and drills, but by the 1960s and 1970s, new
technologies such as multispectral scanners, remote sensing, rovers,
satellites, and underwater drills were incorporated into Interior's
global mineral installations. [[American private capital]{.mark} came to
[rely on this infrastructure in making investments]{.mark} in an era
that spanned postwar prosperity and postindustrial malaise. The
[department]{.mark} had in reality performed this alchemy for industry
throughout its history, [help]{.mark}ing, in that earlier era, [to ready
lands expropriated from Native Americans and Mexico for capitalist
utilization and investment.]{.mark}]{.underline} Crossing political
borders and reaching into international zones like space and the oceans,
the Interior Department ultimately helped assemble the scaffolding over
which the integration of global markets and the "financialization of
everything" could unfold.546 Yet it took more than technology and
spadework for the Interior Department to unearth minerals across the
globe. [[Cultural schemas]{.mark}, too, [contributed to the]{.mark}
ultimate [scope]{.mark} and content [of]{.mark} its [mineral
exploitation]{.mark}]{.underline}. To bolster its contradictory material
interventions, the Interior Department frequently offered narratives
that anchored its actions in moral ground. In these contests for
legitimacy, minerals became key terrains of meaning. [While minerals are
ordinarily characterized as static objects of rational interest, they
are also dynamic objects of cultural debate.]{.underline} Interior thus
labored intently to narrate 546. minerals for the American public and
international audiences. Producing mineral films like The Evolution of
the Oil Industry, Interior emblazoned its favored interventionist
ideologies---resource globalism and resource primitivism---in
Technicolor images. These ideologies, rooted in resources themselves,
refuted the validity of political borders in mineral development on
grounds that minerals fell under the separate domain of nature.
Minerals, like earth of which they were a part, knew no national
boundaries. Interior consciously departed from earlier ways of narrating
minerals as "national," because anti imperialists like those behind the
film The Treasure of the Sierra Madre had similarly "nationalized"
minerals and called for entirely different ends---the protection of
resources of the global South from American and European politicians and
capitalists. The discursive boundaries of such mineral debates continued
to shift. Minerals would eventually stand as shorthand for ecological
injury, a point encapsulated in Dune, and the basis of transnational
alliance, as the Indian OPEC imaginary insisted. They had a long and
varied cultural life in the Cold War. [The [cultural life of
minerals]{.mark} helped to [expand]{.mark} and contract the [field of
possible actions in resource frontiers.]{.mark} Undoubtedly,
[minerals]{.mark}, for reasons inhering in their chemical properties,
[functioned as objects of national and private interests that galvanized
state and corporate actors to act.]{.mark} But [cultural schemas]{.mark}
were other mechanisms, [operating in tandem with political and economic
decision-making in elite spheres and grassroots organizing on the
ground, which contoured mineral development]{.mark}.]{.underline} They
consequently stand as new analytical tools that might be applied in our
attempts to understand the historical conditions calling forth or
resisting material exploitation. In short, as Secretary of the Interior
Stewart Udall explained in the epigraph opening this dissertation, 307
"imagination" was as important to opening up mineral reserves across the
globe as "their intrinsic abundance in the earth's crust."547 The
Interior Department's capacity to mobilize mineral visions in support of
its expansionist projects eventually reached an outer limit. Its
twentieth-century fight for bureaucratic power and relevance came to a
quiet, almost imperceptible, halt in the 1980s and 1990s. The Interior
Department wavered in the face of a confluence of forces funneled
through the energy crisis, including a grassroots movement that publicly
excoriated the department for centuries of deception and guile, a
federal restructuring that cast growing doubt on its ability to plan for
America's natural resource future, and a presidential administration
that sought the eradication of government regulatory functions in
keeping with the neoliberal rationale that free markets, and not
government, should order society. In and through these transformations
in the late Cold War, the Interior Department faded into increasing
obscurity. Interior could not imagine minerals in such a way as to
countervail the forces that challenged it. In its place at the Cold
War's end stood a defense industry that the Reagan and Bush
administrations helped to transform into a favored instrument for
securing U.S. mineral interests. Such militarized infrastructures
overshadowed civilian ones working to squeeze the global South for its
mineral potential. Whether in the Niger Delta or the Middle East, U.S.
armed forces mediated between local dictators and extractive giants from
Exxon to Chevron, companies Interior had long assisted with exploitation
on many Executive Files of the Federal Government, Lyndon B. Johnson
Library, Austin, TX. 308 different resource frontiers, to ensure the
flow of petroleum.548 These actions precipitated new mineral schemas of
resistance as well, this time from the global campaign of the 1990s
promoting "no blood for oil"---a rallying cry that united social
movements in opposition to the United States' Persian Gulf War and the
bloody oil politics of places like Nigeria.549 Although the Interior
Department lingers on, and the Department of the Interior building
continues to occupy two city blocks of prime Washington, DC, real
estate, its mineral technocracy has fragmented beyond recognition. As a
symbol of this shift, the Bureau of Mines, a once-influential branch of
the department with enough of a monopoly on geological expertise to
catalyze national fears of resource depletion, was abolished in 1996.550
Interior became more closely associated with preserving natural
parklands and wildlife through its National Park Service and Fishing and
Wildlife Service than for its technical know-how about extractive
capitalism. The veneer of environmental stewardship, which had often
been a solvent helping to grow Interior's more dubious investments,
powerfully shapes the public image of the contemporary bureaucracy. This
point is readily apparent when surveying the Interior Department's
Twitter and Instagram life: a catalog of luscious photographs of scenic
vistas and majestic creatures from America's national parks, tagged with
the self-styled, highly naturalized reminder that the 548 Michael Watts,

required "no filter."551 Despite these appearances and a diminished role
in mineral resource development, [the Interior Department sporadically
emerges from the shadows of U.S. extractive exploitation, a result of
its abiding capacities in resource management.]{.underline} Such was the
case in the 2011 Deepwater Horizon oil spill. In this largest spill in
U.S. history, it was the Interior Department and its Minerals Management
Service that failed to adequately regulate the BP facilities. Its
closeness with the same industries that it sought to regulate appeared,
once again, to work to the detriment of the American public.552 Looking
back on its history, the Interior Department, since its origins, had
never really been "interior." From the beginning, it was on the boundary
line between inside and outside, domestic and foreign. Through its
bureaucratic evolution, the department constantly recapitulated its
function to bring in and metabolize outside materials in new contexts.
[And this is indeed significant: when the most overtly insular arm of
[U.S. state power]{.mark} is [found to have]{.mark} abetted and at times
[led expansion]{.mark} in its many forms[---overseas imperialism,
international development, ocean and space exploration, and the
recolonization of indigenous lands in the twentieth
century]{.mark}---then distinctions between the United States and the
world seem fictive altogether. So long as the Interior Department was at
large, the boundaries of home dissipated or, rather, never settled. What
remained in place of home was a global interior.]{.underline}

the history that created that reliance [intersects with]{.mark} the
**[colonial history]{.mark}** of Alaska as a geography and its
sovereignty as a Native homeland]{.underline}. Sovereignty for
Indigenous peoples in the United States, inclusive of Alaska Natives,
can be under stood as the inherent right of a collective society to
exercise self- determination and therefore express political authority
over the ecosystems they occupy, the resources found within that
geography, its cultures and heritage, and the lives of its members
(Borrows 1997; Napoleon 2005; Whyte 2016a). [Indigenous law understands
sovereignty to mean 'the expression of regionally specific Indigenous
legal orders that demand reciprocal relations in a community reliant
upon the ecosystem, in order to shape environmental
sustainability]{.underline}' (Brewer et al. 2017). This [construction of
sovereignty ties sustainability as a concept to its **discursive use**,
specifically tied to a community's ability to maintain cohesion and
ecological food, energy, and spiritual security in the face of
environmental challenges]{.underline}. Sovereignty for Native
communities thus exists at the nexus of sustainability and
(post)colonialism -- it is the right and responsibility to mend,
cultivate, and expand social, cultural, environmental, and economic
relationships damaged by colonialism. In reference to the reading
strategy for this volume, this can be read as sovereignty should be made
sustainable in relation to environmental -- and by extension social,
economic, and cultural -- connections by Native communities. As a state,
Alaska is unique in its legal framework for Alaska Natives because of
the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), passed by the U.S.
Congress in 1971 (Berardi 2005). The Act conveyed nearly one billion
dollars and 44 million acres of land -- the most tribal lands out of all
US states -- and divided it into 12 geographic regions of common
heritage and interests. The sovereign status conferred on Native
American reservations in the lower 48 does not exist in the Alaska
context; instead, land provided by ANCSA is owned by Native- run
corporations, with the intent being that all would benefit from
resources on any given parcel of land (Resource Development Council
n.d.). Twelve regional native corporations, which encompass 229 tribal
groups, own most tribal land and their subsurface mineral rights, and as
such rank as the largest private businesses in Alaska (Resource
Development Council n.d.). According to a 2015 opinion piece advocating
for the inclusion and elevation of Native corporations into any
sustainable economic plan

, There are approximately 120,000 shareholders who hold roughly 12% of
the total land in Alaska. The concept driving ANCSA was that Native
Corporations would utilize the money and land resources conveyed to them
to engage in the capitalistic marketplace in order to provide profits to
care for the social, cultural and economic benefit of their shareholders
in perpetuity Alaska Native Corporations have done this by participating
in a wide array of business sectors, including oil and gas exploration,
development, and export. But while Alaska Native Corporations have
benefited from the development and export of Arctic petroleum resources,
for most of its history as a state Alaska Natives did not have energy
sovereignty. Energy sovereignty can be understood as the right of

In short, if sovereignty refers to power, energy sovereignty refers to
where power resides in energy affairs. At the local level of energy
generation in remote Alaska villages, this power flows from refineries
further south onto barges and aeroplanes and then out again -- energy
power lies entirely outside of the community because of the colonial
path dependency on imported diesel fuel. [[Path dependency]{.mark} is
[created by]{.mark} [the **imprinting effects of initial
conditions**]{.mark}, [**exogenous contingencie**s]{.mark}, **and
[self-reinforcing loops]{.mark}** that [lock actors into
paths]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this combination, [initial
[conditions]{.mark} are not given but are **[constructed by empowered
actors]{.mark}** who mobilize specific alignments to benefit themselves
or their position]{.underline}. What is exogenous and what is endogenous
is also not given, but depends on how those actors draw initial
boundaries. [[Self- reinforcing mech]{.mark}anism[s]{.mark} are [not
organic]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} instead are **[cultivated]{.mark}** by
actors]{.underline} (Garud et al. 2010). [[In]{.mark} [the mid-]{.mark}
[twentieth century]{.mark}, a series of 'policy- driven decisions by
non- Indigenous governments' created a path dependency for Alaska
Natives on diesel fuel for electricity, heating, and
transportation]{.underline} (Brewer et al. 2017). [[Decisions to

Perhaps the most complex manifestation of maritime temporality relates
to the ways in which industrial capitalism has over the past two
centuries radically transformed the sea\'s primordial properties. In its
ceaseless quest for both extending and intensifying the commodity
frontier, [[capitalist enterprises]{.mark} have [constantly]{.mark}
[develop]{.mark}ed new [means of appropriating marine biomass]{.mark}
and the energy deposited in the ocean\'s subsoil]{.underline} (as well,
it should be acknowledged, as valorising new renewables like wind and
wave power[) thereby substantially altering the bio-physical dynamics of
ocean life-systems. As we shall presently discuss, innovations like
steam shipping or containerisation revolutionised both the circulation
time and the rhythms of work and leisure at sea]{.underline}---what we
label logistical and life time, respectively. There are, nonetheless,
more enduring and yet unknowable expressions of deep time present in the
ways global heating is warming, acidifying and expanding the oceans,
with its corresponding implications for saltwater ecosystems, the marine
food chain, and life in coastal areas (Rohling, 2017; Rozwadowksi, 2018;
Zalasiewicz & Williams, 2014). The global ocean\'s role as a planetary
carbon sink is having well-documented and immediately recognisable
consequences for multiple sea-dependent biophysical phenomena---from
bleached coral reefs and more frequent and intense coastal storms, to
the demise of the Gulf Stream and the proliferation of marine 'dead
zones' due to eutrophication from capitalist farming.

It is, however, the unpredictable future effects of ocean acidification,
warming and expansion, and the different pace of marine carbon
absorption and release that raises the most challenging issues about
deep time and the sea, in the same ways that 'human-historical time and
the time of geology' do 'as they relate to the concept of the
Anthropocene' (Chakrabarty, 2018, p. 5). As a living
four-billion-year-old element of the Earth System, the global ocean and
its ice sheets connect geological deep time to contemporary conceptions
of historical time. Borrowing Fernand Braudel\'s famous distinction,
the longue durée of environmental change meets the human life-time of
particular conjunctures and events. The sea thus becomes a privileged
site not only for assessing the cumulative consequences of anthropogenic
climate change, but also more philosophically, in reconceptualising
notions of future life time, given the accelerating effects of positive
feedback loops and tipping points associated to ocean warming. The more
carbon is incorporated into the ocean, the more pH falls to levels that
compromise the marine ecosystem\'s capacity to calcify carbonate,
reducing the ability of organisms at the bottom of the food web to build
shells or skeletons. In a parallel set of Earth System processes, the
warmer saltwater becomes, the greater its expansion and the lighter its
volume, thereby limiting the sea\'s overturning circulation (i.e.
encouraging a noxious stratification of ocean layers). This in turn has
the effect of drastically altering the distribution of oxygen, nutrients
and biodiversity in the global ocean, as well as potentially changing
major currents, precipitation patterns, seasonal winds and cloud
cover---all of which reinforces existing marine pollution, overfishing
and proliferation of invasive species caused by the 'deadly trio' of
warming, acidification and deoxygenation present in previous global mass
extinction events. These combine with the unknowable temporality of
potential tipping points---and their interactions, such as between ice
sheet and glacier collapse and Gulf stream currents (Armstrong Mackay
et al., 2022). Tipping points are where deep geological time and life
time most obviously entwine in a death-dance that could speed-up the
generation of profound, transformative shifts in human civilisation,
including an existential threat to the current global connections that
typify our otherwise fractured species.

Such anthropogenic dynamics are inextricably connected to industrial
capitalism, and in particular the 'great acceleration' in global
greenhouse gas emissions over the past 70 years. These dynamics
illustrate how the timelines of value represented in annual profits, the
tax year, or even carbon offsets rub against the temporality of climate
change. The volumes and rhythms of maritime carbon storage and release
are difficult to compute with terrestrial conceptions of capitalist
time, even if it is the latter that fundamentally feed into the former.
As W. Jeffrey Bolster\'s magisterial 'deep' history of the North
Atlantic boreal region shows, the sea has never been a passive venue of
human activity, but itself a changing life-force that interacts in
variegated ways with different societies: 'The ocean changes daily,
seasonally, and historically, as well as over evolutionary and
geological time' (Bolster, 2014, p. 17).

Another domain where the sea becomes a protagonist of debates around
time is that of historical periodisation. [Long-distance [seaborne
trade]{.mark} [and]{.mark} the [accompanying]{.mark} concentration of
finance, [manufacture, commerce, and]{.mark} peoples in [port
cities]{.mark} have been the mainstay of historical [explanations for
the rise of]{.mark} historical [capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Arrighi, 1994; Braudel, 2002; Wallerstein, 1974). [This
'circulationist' understanding of capitalism, where the new mode of
production issued from trade in commodities and the urban accumulation
of wealth, is often contrasted to the so-called 'political Marxist'
approach associated to the works of Robert Brenner (1977) and Ellen
Meiksins Wood (1999), who insist capitalist social property relations
first emerged in the English countryside during the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries through the dual process of rural dispossession
and agricultural commodification.]{.underline} Oceanic distance is
central to these competing narratives in a number of ways. As already
noted, '[circulationists' place great emphasis on maritime
[ports]{.mark}]{.underline} (Venice, Genoa, Seville, Antwerp, Amsterdam,
London) [[enabling]{.mark} the [convergence of commercial, credit and
insurance services]{.mark} in one location, thereby also
[encourag]{.mark}ing modern, territorial [state-building]{.mark} as
crown or republic.]{.underline} [The [maritime]{.mark} networks of
[trade]{.mark}, money and merchants fostered by these nascent seaborne
mercantile empires [paved the way for]{.mark} a [capitalist world-system
structured around]{.mark} a western [Europe]{.mark}an core]{.underline},
an Iberian, Baltic and Ottoman semi-periphery, and an extra-European
tropical periphery (Wallerstein, 1974). In all this, it is the maritime
integration of geographically distant markets into a single
world-economy that acted both as cause and consequence of capitalist
development. [The oceans became in the course of the 'long' sixteenth
century (1450--1650) the arteries of a world market built on conquest
and plunder of the New World, as much as the accumulation of profit
through international trade.]{.underline}

Like all acts of historical periodisation, this conventional Eurocentric
narrative focused around the early-modern era is far from neutral. It
raises as many questions as it answers about the geographical and
environmental factors in capitalist development; factors placed front
and centre in the plethora of case-studies in environmental history
(e.g. Beinart & Hughes, 2009; Crosby, 2004; Richards, 2006). It is worth
noting, for instance, the tight interdependence between forest
management (including deforestation) in continental Europe, the British
isles, and parts of North America, and the shipbuilding that underwrote
both the Dutch commercial empire of early capitalism (Moore, 2010) and
the nineteenth-century Pax Britannica (Melby, 2012). As this example
shows, then as now, [industrial capital is always-already articulated
with commercial capital, both in seaward-facing societies and
otherwise.]{.underline} As Henry Bernstein usefully notes, are not the
'competing' circulationist and political Marxist approaches simply
'holding up a mirror to each other\'s strengths and weaknesses?' (2013,
p. 325).

A further theoretical advance is in Jairus Banaji\'s painstaking
research (2010, 2016, 2020) into the multiple expressions of commercial
capitalism across the world either side of the long sixteenth-century,
which simultaneously provincialises the European origins of capitalism
and invites reconsiderations of this mode of production that avoid what
he deems to be excessively formalistic definitions requiring extensive
free wage labour or widespread commodification as conditions of
possibility. [The co-existence of multiple temporalities on the Atlantic
slave ship that we started out with, is especially illustrative of how
[capitalism]{.mark} has from the beginning [relied on]{.mark} older
[seaborne institutions of profit]{.mark} and rule [like slavery]{.mark},
piracy or maritime insurance [which]{.mark} buttressed new social forms
like [generalised]{.mark} free [wage labour]{.mark},
[shareholder]{.mark} company [ownership or national
banks]{.mark}]{.underline} (Edwards et al., 2020). The 'oceanic turn' in
recent economic and environmental history (Armitage et al., 2017) has
further de-centred the historical geography of modernity and the sea,
demonstrating the socio-economic and political interconnections between
the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific oceans in forging the modern world
(Bishara & Wint, 2020; Sivasundaram, 2020), as well as identifying the
legacies and continuities of regional maritime histories upon the
emerging world-system first explored in classic works by
Chaudhuri (1985) and Abu-Lughod (1989).

Once again, eminently geographical phenomena such as the impossibility
of permanently populating the high seas, or the challenges associated to
accessing and controlling unruly coastlines, have produced distinctive
legal norms like 'the freedom of the seas' and unique practices of
shared or devolved jurisdiction at, or close to the sea, which Lauren
Benton (2010) has labelled 'legal pluralism' (see also Merry, 1988;
Colás & Mabee, 2010; Mathew, 2016; Pal, 2021[). As commercial
[capitalism]{.mark} [engulfed regional economies]{.mark} across the
world, [latching on to]{.mark} ancestral [seaborne trade routes]{.mark},
repurposing local maritime knowledge and technologies (Sheriff, 2010),
or [adopting]{.mark} and adapting existing [forms of]{.mark} property
rights or [labour exploitation at different ports]{.mark}
(]{.underline}Bishara, 2017), the nature of the world market was also
modified. The racialised figure of the 'Lascar' (Ahuja, 2006;
Balachandran, 2012)---a semi-indentured seafarer from South
Asia---played a critical role, well into the twentieth century, as the
'muscles of Empire' (Broeze, 1981). Similarly, British imperialism
mobilised its extra-economic blue-water power to build strategic
commercial outposts like Hong Kong or Singapore, servicing what to this
day remains a global network of offshore financial markets centred in
the City of London. [The [maritime factor in]{.mark} such experiences of
[capitalist]{.mark} [development]{.mark} therefore [complicates]{.mark}
simple [distinctions]{.mark} [between colonial and pre-colonial,
capitalist and non-capitalist]{.mark}, or indeed modern and pre-modern
in the periodisation of global capitalism.]{.underline}

#### Space exploration is an extension of capitalism's reliance on unsustainable growth---it's mutually exclusive with any anti-capitalist alternative

https://doi.org/10.1177/14748851241279679) ONBM

A straightforward Marxist materialist reading of the new space race
interrogates the political economic purposes of human activity in space:
in Marxist terms, [[space exploitation]{.mark} operates as [an extension
of]{.mark} primitive [accumulation that enables]{.mark} the expanded
[reproduction of capital]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rosa Luxemburg poses the
problem of expanded reproduction---[[a need for capitalism]{.mark} [to
realize surplus value]{.mark} in an ongoing and ever-growing
way]{.underline}---as central to any analysis of capitalism (Luxemburg,
2016). Luxemburg contends that the [expanded reproduction and
accumulation of capital requires the continual expropriation of
heretofore non-capitalist realms, and that this drives capitalist
imperialism and marks the ongoing character of what Marx called
primitive accumulation as constitutive of the capitalist
order]{.underline} (Luxemburg, 2016: 261--65; 325--30). Imperialism then
becomes the "political expression of the process of the accumulation of
capital in its competitive struggle over the unspoiled remainder of the
non-capitalist world environment" (325), and moreover is a racialized
and racializing colonial process that sutures racial domination to
capitalist violence (Issar, 2021).

More recently, David Harvey (2001) has examined the way in which
capitalism depends on ongoing "spatial fixes," in which capital
geographically expands its purview to soak up capital surpluses and
over-accumulations[. [Space exploitation]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[projects]{.mark} the [spatial fix skyward to ensure]{.mark} the
[reproduction of capital]{.mark} [through]{.mark} processes of
expansion, [primitive accumulation]{.mark}, [and imperialism]{.mark} in
space itself]{.underline}. As Victor Shammas and Tomas Holen argue,
outer space as a spatial fix "swallows up surplus capital, promising to
deliver valuable resources, technological innovations, and communication
services to capitalists back on Earth," a dynamic that "places outer
space on the same level as traditional colonization" (2019: 5). Indeed,
national and international legal regimes have adapted and been
interpreted to foster the colonial extraction of resources from
celestial bodies (Bhatt, 2023; Durrani, 2019; Singh, 2023: 97; Storr,
2021). In Luxemburg\'s terms, capitalist forces convert space into a
zone for expanded reproduction. From this standpoint, the [[political
dimensions of space exploitation]{.mark}---the SPACE Act, the
[proliferation of public--private partnerships]{.mark}, [relying
on]{.mark} [private firms]{.mark} for launches, prospects for [lunar
mining]{.mark}, and so on---[constitute]{.mark} specifically
[imperialist processes that express]{.mark} in political terms
[capitalism\'s struggle to expropriate]{.mark} not what Luxemburg calls
the "non-capitalist world environment"]{.underline} (Luxemburg, 2016:
325[), but rather [the
not-yet-fully-capitalist astronomical environment.]{.mark}]{.underline}

We need, however, more than this Marxist materialist account for
primitive accumulations and spatial fixes additionally restage settler
colonial and propertarian logics in space: the spatial
fix also facilitates an ever-expanding frontier in line with the
American settler colonial imaginary that aims to convert land (or space)
to private property, pushing manifest destiny beyond the Karman line.
Where critics, such as Rubenstein, examine the religious and
eschatological underpinnings of the settler
colonialism-to-space-colonialism trajectory (Rubenstein, 2022), we use
political theory resources to argue that the drive to exploit, traverse,
extract, settle, and colonize space projects a distinctively Lockean
notion of private property upward into the cosmos. John Locke
(in)famously justifies the appropriation of parts of nature (which was
previously given to humans in common) as one\'s private property through
the process of mixing one\'s own labor with nature: by extending the
property that some inalienably have first in their person into nature
through one\'s labor, one removes that nature from what had been held in
common and makes it their own (Locke, 1690: chap. 5). Moreover, Locke
claims that this adds value and efficiency that is greater than the
vacant void of terra nullius that for him characterizes undeveloped
nature.

Even at this very simplified level, we witness a Lockean logic becoming
more prominent in the new space race. In 2015, Congress passed and
President Obama signed the U.S. Commercial Space Launch Act of 2015,
also known as the Spurring Private Aerospace Competitiveness and
Entrepreneurship Act, or SPACE Act (Public Law 114--90). While
explicitly disavowing territorial sovereign claims over space, the Act
legislates the following:

A United States citizen engaged in commercial recovery of an asteroid
resource or a space resource under this chapter shall be entitled to any
asteroid resource or space resource obtained, including to possess, own,
transport, use, and sell the asteroid resource or space resource
obtained in accordance with applicable law, including the international
obligations of the United States. (Section 513.03)

A basic Lockean justification functions here[: [as the US]{.mark}
[citizen]{.mark} [mixes their labor and tech]{.mark}nology [with the
unclaimed "resource]{.mark}," [they become entitled to]{.mark} legal
ownership over the resource, not to mention the [profit]{.mark} derived
from the resource.]{.underline}

[[Space]{.mark} [provides an outlet]{.mark} not just [for the capitalist
necessity of opening new spaces to its forces and processes]{.mark}, but
also a Lockean outlet to terrestrial limits on territorial
expansion.]{.underline} Locke avers that his theory is more actionable
in America than England, given that England has been mostly claimed and
appropriated by the time of his writing, while he paints America as an
uncultivated expanse. This becomes especially important given his
proviso derived from natural law that "Nor was this appropriation of any
parcel of land, by improving it, any prejudice to any other man, since
there was still enough, and as good left; and more than the yet
unprovided could use" (1690: sect. 33)---never mind the indigenous
peoples living on and working on and with this so-called vacant waste
for thousands of years prior to European settlers. Space
exploitation escapes from the territorial limitation on property
acquisition by redirecting new appropriative efforts into the infinity
of the cosmos.

#### Space colonization locks in unsustainable growth and trades off with anti-capitalist solutions that tackle the root cause of climate change

4.2. [[**Capitalist realism** underpins]{.mark} the contemporary case
for **[space colonization]{.mark}**]{.underline} This section continues
the sociological examination of the case for space colonization by
drawing on Fisher's (2008) concept of capitalist realism[. The social
context of capitalist realism helps illuminate the case for space
colonization in three ways: (1) Capitalist goals inform contemporary
[justifications for space colonization]{.mark} and, more fundamentally,
the [assum]{.mark}ption that **[capitalism]{.mark}** [will carry
on]{.mark} in the long-term is **[unquestioned]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
(2) The future fantasy of space colonization deters attention from more
effective and just solutions to the ecological crisis. (3) [The case for
**[space colonization]{.mark}** is [only viable if there are **no
alternatives to capitalism**]{.mark}. In other words, when social
alternatives to capitalism are considered, space colonization as a
climate change strategy is unjustifiable.]{.underline} We discuss each
point in turn. That capitalism as a system is taken-for-granted in the
case for space colonization, and capitalist priorities inform motives to
colonize space, is not surprising when space colonization is framed as a
solution to future ecological collapse. The only climate change solution
strategies being widely adopted or seriously considered in policy
circles and international organizations are solutions in line with
capitalist goals. Project Drawdown (2021), for example, claims to offer
the most comprehensive set of solutions to minimize global warming.
Their mission is simple: "stopping catastrophic climate change --- as
quickly, safely, and equitably as possible." Yet, all their solutions
must meet five specific criteria, the second one being: "Is it
economically viable? In other words, is there a business case?" (quoted
in DiCaprio 2019). Only solutions that fit this "win-win" model are
supported. Those that might be more effective but will not result in
profits are discarded. Project Drawdown is only one example of the norm:
solutions to the ecological crisis that reproduce rather than challenge
the current social order (e.g., Foster et al., 2010; Stuart et al.,
2020a). In a paradigm where all solutions must adapt to capitalism, we
find justification for space colonization if other technological
strategies are not enough to save humanity. Indeed, although
rationalized by aspirations to save humanity, those who actually have
control over the plans for space colonization seem to be focused more on
maintaining the current system and chasing profit. [Not only could a
[space colony]{.mark} unintentionally [recreate the same social
conditions that lead to its formation]{.mark} (see preceding section),
but there is evidence that this may be precisely why space colonies
would be formed in the first place. For example, Bezos envisions the
[Moon]{.mark} as the future "[manufacturing sector of the
universe]{.mark}" (Liberto, 2019). Or take the case of keeping a Martian
colony warm: fossil fuels extracted on Earth could be burned in space
transport and at colony sites, increasing fossil fuel profits.
Relatedly, there are [plans to mine Mars]{.mark} [and the Moon]{.mark}
for minerals to increase wealth accumulation. In addition, the companies
working on space colonization projects are private companies with
"pecuniary reasons" for their projects beyond saving (some of) humanity
(Kovic, 2020: 5).]{.underline} As affluence represents a primary driver
of the existential threats humans face (Wiedmann, Lenzen, & Keyßer,
2020), it is not surprising that the primary supporters of space
exploration are billionaires trying to flee problems of the system that
lined their pockets. [The case for space colonization is not only a
social-reproduction strategy in the sense that, [if successful]{.mark},
it could **[maintain the current system]{.mark}** and even
[allow]{.mark} those **[profiti]{.mark}ng** from the current system to
continue to benefit [as Earth faces increasing
**threats**]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is also a social-reproduction
strategy because it deters attention from social alternatives that have
the potential to address the ecological crisis. Like other "false
solutions" to climate change that deter attention and resources from the
need for systemic change to reduce emissions (Stuart, Gunderson, &
Petersen, 2020b), hopes of escaping Earth's problems through a future
home on a space colony weakens the case for solving Earth's problems.
[Why not trash the planet if a Golden Ticket to live in an "outdoorsy,
fun atmosphere" on Mars awaits? In other words, the case for space
colonization is another silver bullet narrative that delays concrete
action and maintains the current system]{.underline}. Fisher would add
here that the case for space colonization further allows ideology to
escape from the contradiction that ecological collapse is built into the
basic processes of capitalism. This reality is "too traumatic to be
assimilated into the system" (Fisher, 2008: 18) and space colonization
is a comforting futuristic fantasy to flee this trauma. Our claim that
the case for space colonization is blind to social alternatives is
illustrated by the extreme techniques necessary to make Mars
colonization a real possibility, especially biotechnological alterations
of the human body. As explained by Szocik et al. (2020), because the
Martian environment is exceptionally harsh and different than Earth, we
may need to change the human genome and characteristics to be more
suitable for colonization. Mars has less gravity but much more
radiation, which could inhibit maintaining human civilizations on Mars.
Protective gear would be necessary, but sterility could still result.
Szocik et al. (2020) also explain that living in isolated conditions is
psychologically stressful and the human psyche may not be able to stand
up to the pressures. Therefore, we may need a "radical modification and
interference with 'human nature,' psychology, and anatomy" to cope with
these new conditions and we also may need to modify ethical and moral
standards (Szocik et al., 2020: 10). With all of the modification that
may be necessary, Szocik et al. (2020: 12) asks, "Is there a
sufficiently strong reason to go to space which justifies the
enhancement of future astronauts[?" In other words, it is [easier
to]{.mark} [imagine]{.mark} the **[modification of the human
genome]{.mark}** [to live on Mars]{.mark} [than]{.mark} to
[imagine]{.mark} the [end of capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline} Such
proposals are considered because changing the system continues to be an
unattractive solution and to many, a "non-starter." Kovic (2020: 5)
explains that given the potential economic gains of technological
development, space colonization "could be perceived as the more
attractive option." Green (2019: 37) makes this argument clear:
considering the relative difficulties of establishing world peace and
regulating the development of all dangerous technologies, settling on
Mars may actually be relatively easy. It certainly has fewer political
difficulties, though the technical ones remain immense. Green (2019:
37), therefore, concludes that space colonization is the
"relatively-easiest solution to the problem of saving at least some of
humanity." [[In the eyes of]{.mark} most [decision-makers,]{.mark}
[challenging]{.mark} the [dominant social order]{.mark},
[profits,]{.mark} [and wealth accumulation]{.mark} simply is [not an
option]{.mark}. Capitalism remains inevitable and
unquestioned]{.underline}: "there is no alternative." Skeptical readers
may agree that capitalism is typically taken for granted in cases for
space colonization but find this a moot point because perhaps there
really is no alternative to capitalism. The prospects for an alternative
to capitalism are grim. The concept of capitalist realism is meant to
shine light on an ideology and real social conditions. In other words,
capitalist realism does not arise from distorted beliefs, but is a
response to social conditions that (seem to) close off the possibility
for a better world. There is a genuine difficulty in imagining
alternatives to capitalism in part because there is not a functioning
political infrastructure or global social movement to alter current
conditions. In this context, [it is [tempting]{.mark} [to]{.mark} openly
[affirm]{.mark} or cynically accept the thought that the [continuation
of business as usual]{.mark} off-planet [for those who can afford
it]{.mark} really is [easier to envision than]{.mark} the far [simpler
task of altering]{.mark} the [social relations that drive climate
change]{.mark}.]{.underline} Indeed, the fact that the case for space
colonization strikes contemporary consciousness as a more realistic
strategy than transitioning out of capitalism speaks to the helplessness
and hopelessness of our times. Despite the political-economic barriers
obstructing social alternatives to the system driving climate change
(capitalism), there are alternatives, and they should be kept in
constant view. For example, the case for "degrowth" aims to keep energy
and resource use within planetary limits by purposefully limiting
material and energy throughput in wealthy countries through means such
as worker, consumer, and energy cooperatives, work time reduction,
deliberative democracy, and other means (e.g., Kallis, 2018; Hickel,
2020; Stuart et al., 2020b). Increasing economic growth is associated
with greenhouse gas emissions, does not make humans happier after basic
needs are met, and is an ecological impossibility in the long-term.
Downscaling overall material and energy throughput to avoid catastrophic
climate change is possible and can be achieved through desirable social
changes that increase equality and happiness. Some will reasonably ask,
"Could this work in the real world?" We reply to the question "Isn't
'degrowth' utopian (in the sense of unrealistic and unachievable)?" with
a different question: Why is ceasing to produce and consume for the sake
of production and consumption less realistic than space colonization? To
make the proposal for degrowth more concrete, the following strategies
are often proposed by "degrowthers" and related activists (e.g.,
"ecosocialists"): Using productivity gains to reduce the amount of time
spent at work, upscaling renewable energy through cooperative ownership
(and other forms of public ownership), and nationalizing fossil fuel
companies in order to phase out most fossil fuel extraction while
reemploying fossil fuel workers in renewable energy efforts (for
summary, see Stuart et al., 2020a). On what grounds are these proposals
unrealistic relative to space colonization? In comparison to space
colonization, work time reduction, fossil fuel nationalization, and
cooperative/public renewable systems are arguably more rational,
realistic, and just strategies to address the threat of species
extinction through ecological collapse. One reason these proposals may
seem unrealistic is that they are labeled "political" while space
colonization is considered an apological, merely "technical" approach.
We disagree with this premise. One goal of this paper is to highlight
how [[space col]{.mark}onization [is necessarily
political]{.mark}]{.underline}. From the seemingly purely technical
decisions of space scientists to the sources and allocation of funding
for colonization projects, the entire endeavor has a constant
political-economic context, though one that is typically taken for
granted, and will have social impacts. Thus, any of the questions
leveled at "political" approaches to address the ecological crisis
should also be directed toward those advocating space colonization: Is
there a guarantee that this plan can be implemented? How are you going
to gain mass support? The strategy is untested - what if it fails? Etc.
Ideological norms are another basis for deeming work time reduction,
fossil fuel nationalization, and publicly-owned renewable unrealistic.
Indeed, [capitalist realism sees all alternative models for the future
as dogmatic and dangerous]{.underline} (Fisher, 2008). Further, these
proposals go against the hegemonic notion that growth is good at all
costs. In a recent piece, Tim Jackson (2021) argues that the billionaire
space race is the "ultimate symbol of capitalism's flawed obsession with
growth" and highlights an irony: [the quest for space colonization
implicitly acknowledges that **unlimited growth is impossible**, yet
simultaneously **assumes** that the **solution** to natural limits **[is
more growth]{.mark}** (into space).]{.underline} Yet ideology always has
a social context. An accelerating capitalist "treadmill of production,"
for example, provides historical validity to that idea that "growth is
good" (Schnaiberg, 1980). A third and more serious basis for labeling
these strategies unrealistic relative to space colonization is discussed
above: the problem of real political helplessness in developing a viable
alternative to capitalism. We agree that the latter is an enormous
obstacle to forming alternative social futures. Helplessness is one
social cause of capitalist-realist ideology (Gunderson, under review).
However, the awareness of possible social alternatives, and organizing
social movements to achieve them, will remain a thorn in the side of
capitalist realism, not to mention the only route to avoid climate
catastrophe. [The [continuation of capitalism]{.mark} assumed in the
case for space colonization and capitalist priorities also explicitly
[inform motives to colonize space]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., it is
supported by some billionaires precisely because it is a mean to
increase profits). [**[Focusing on space colonization detracts
attention, resources, and energy away from]{.mark} the need to rapidly
adopt systemic [changes to save Earth]{.mark}**. The case for space
colonization is untenable when social alternatives to the structural
drivers of possible ecological collapse are considered.]{.underline}

## Impact/Sustainability

### Impact---Arctic Warming---2NC

#### Capitalism is the [underlying]{.underline} cause of Arctic climate change\-\--corporate interests fuel media and support for policies\-\--the 1AC is questionable at best. 

By David **Edwards** & David **Cromwell** 20**12**, ZCommunications;
Truthout"Arctic Ice Melt, Psychopathic Capitalism and the Corporate
Media"
<https://truthout.org/articles/arctic-ice-melt-psychopathic-capitalism-and-the-corporate-media/>
October 6, 2012 AS

Last month, climate scientists announced that Arctic sea ice had shrunk
to its smallest surface area since satellite observations began in 1979.
An ice-free summer in the Arctic, once projected to be more than a
century away, now looks possible just a few decades from now. Some
scientists say it may happen within the next few years.

The loss is hugely significant because Arctic sea ice reflects most
solar energy into space, helping to keep the Earth at a moderate
temperature. But when the ice melts it reveals dark waters below, which
absorb more than 90 percent of the solar energy that hits them, leading
to faster warming both locally and globally.

Peter Wadhams, professor of ocean physics at Cambridge University, warns
that the Arctic may be ice-free in summer as soon as 2015. Such a
massive loss would have a warming effect roughly equivalent to all human
activity to date. In other words, a summer ice-free Arctic could double
the rate of warming of the planet as a whole. No wonder that leading
NASA climate scientist James Hansen says bluntly: "We are in a planetary
emergency."

Uncompromised, uncompromising news

Get reliable, independent news and commentary delivered to your inbox
every day.

The reality of changes to the Arctic has far outstripped most
predictions. Only a few years ago, in the 2007 Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change report, the bulk of models showed the Arctic ice cap
surviving in summer until well past 2100. Now it's not clear that the
ice will survive in summer past 2020. The level of sea ice we saw this
September, in 2012, wasn't expected by the mean of IPCC models until
2065. The melting Arctic has outpaced the predictions of almost everyone
-- everyone except the few who were called alarmists.

As well as global warming from carbon dioxide (CO2), there is the
additional risk of warming from methane (CH4) being released into the
atmosphere. Huge quantities of methane are locked up in land permafrost.
But even vaster quantities exist as methane hydrates frozen below the
shallow waters of the Arctic Ocean's continental shelves. Naam warns:

If even 10% of the northern permafrost's buried carbon were released as
methane, it would have a heating effect over the next decade equivalent
to ten times all human greenhouse emissions to date, and over the next
century equivalent to roughly four times all human greenhouse emissions
to date.

That's just the methane on land, trapped in the permafrost. If the
methane hydrates buried on the Arctic continental shelves were to be
released, that would have a warming effect equivalent to hundreds of
times the total human carbon emissions to date.

Although Namm says "we are probably not in danger of a methane time bomb
going off any time soon", recent observations show that Arctic methane
is being released into the atmosphere. And there is scientific
controversy over how serious and how rapid this release is.

In summary, Naam points to a triple whammy effect:

1\. Warming from the greenhouse gases we are currently emitting.

2\. Warming from the loss of ice and permafrost in the Arctic, and the
exposure of dark water and dark land below.

3\. Warming from the release of more carbon into the atmosphere as the
permafrost and the Arctic sea floor methane begin to melt.

The situation is already dire. According to a new report commissioned by
twenty governments, more than 100 million people will die by 2030 if the
world fails to tackle climate change. Five million deaths already occur
each year from air pollution, hunger and disease as a result of climate
change and carbon-intensive economies. This death toll would likely rise
to six million a year by 2030 if current patterns of fossil fuel use
continue. More than 90 per cent of those deaths will occur in developing
countries.

On a sane planet, action would have been taken long before now to limit
the risk. But, as Greenpeace International head Kumi Naidoo notes,
fossil fuel industries have been working hard to corrupt the political
process:

Why our governments don't take action? Because they have been captured
by the same interests of the energy industry.

As we noted in an alert last year, a Greenpeace study titled Who's
Holding Us Back? reported:

[The **[corporations]{.mark} [most responsible]{.mark}** [for
contributing to climate change emissions]{.mark} [and profiting]{.mark}
from those activities are campaigning to increase their access to
international negotiations and, at the same time, working to defeat
progressive legislation on climate change and energy around the
world.]{.underline}

Greenpeace added:

[These polluting corporations [often]{.mark} [exert their influence
behind the scenes]{.mark}, employing a variety of techniques, including
using **trade associations and think tanks as front groups**; confusing
the public through climate denial or advertising campaigns; making
corporate political donations; as well as making use of the "revolving
door" between public servants and carbon-intensive
corporations.]{.underline}

[Unsurprisingly then, **[meaningful action on tackling climate change is
nowhere on the political agenda]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Drilling to Oblivion

Around the same time that a record low in Arctic sea ice was being
recorded, a new report from the UK's House of Commons Environmental
Audit Committee urged a halt to all oil and gas drilling in the Arctic,
at least "until new safeguards are put in place." Committee chair Joan
Walley MP said:

[The [shocking]{.mark} [speed]{.mark} at which the [Arctic sea ice is
melting]{.mark} [should be a wake-up call]{.mark} to the world that we
need to phase out fossil fuels fast.]{.underline} [[Instead]{.mark} we
are witnessing **a [reckless gold rush]{.mark}** in this pristine
wilderness as big companies and governments make a grab for the world's
last untapped oil and gas reserves]{.underline}.

Caroline Lewis, member of the committee, warned that "[the race to carve
up the Arctic is accelerating faster than our regulatory or technical
capacity to manage it."]{.underline}

[But the record of [corporate capitalism]{.mark} shows that [**powerful
industrial forces will do all they can to lobby governments** **to allow
for continued economic exploitation** of the planet]{.mark}'s
resources]{.underline}. [According to the US Geological Survey, within
the Arctic Circle there are some 90 billion barrels of oil -- 13 per
cent of the planet's undiscovered oil reserves -- and 30 per cent of its
undiscovered natural gas. **The race for corporate profits is now on**,
with Shell already committed to a "multi-year exploration program" in
the Arctic.]{.underline}

[The receding Arctic [ice is a "**business opportunity**]{.mark}" for
those [wishing to exploit]{.mark} newly available [shipping
routes]{.mark}. Cargo that now goes via the Panama Canal or the Suez
Canal will, in many cases, have a shorter Arctic route, ensuring
"efficiency savings" for big business]{.underline}.

Companies are also [[licking their lips]{.mark} [at]{.mark} the prospect
at getting their hands on [vast deposits of minerals as Greenland's ice
cap recedes]{.mark}]{.underline}

"[For me, I wouldn't mind if the whole ice cap disappears," said Ole
Christiansen, the chief executive of NunamMinerals, Greenland's largest
homegrown mining company, with his eyes on a proposed gold mining site
up the fjord from Nuuk, Greenland's capital. "As it melts, we're seeing
new places with very attractive geology."]{.underline}

**[A good example of the [psychopathic mind-set at the heart of
corporate capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Science writer Peter Gleick
responded incredulously on Twitter: "25 foot sea rise?" For that is
indeed the catastrophic scale of global sea level rise that would occur
with the melting of the Greenland ice sheet.

The BBC Parks the Problem

The BBC's extremely poor and biased coverage of climate change continues
to dismay seasoned observers. As Verity Payne and Freya Roberts noted on
The Carbon Brief website, the corporation's "fondness for pitting
non-experts against each other over particularly complex areas of
climate science reached surreal heights" in a recent BBC2 Newsnight
segment on Arctic sea ice loss. The encounter between Conservative MP
Peter Lilley and the Green Party's new leader Natalie Bennett eventually
degenerated into an argument over the merits of locally-sourced food.
Payne and Roberts concluded:

It's hard to understand how, over a year after the BBC Trust reviewed
the corporation's science coverage, paying particular attention to
topics such as climate change, this is what we end up with.

In fact, the BBC's awful performance is not that much of a mystery. [The
corporation has always been a reliable supporter of state and corporate
power. But particularly since the fallout from reporting the
government's "sexing-up" of discredited claims about Iraq's supposed
weapons of mass destruction, when heads rolled at the BBC, the
broadcaster has been at pains not to offend the government and allied
interests.]{.underline} [Its **abysmal failure to inform the British
public** of the coalition's effective dismantling of the National Health
Service is another key example.]{.underline}

According to former BBC correspondent and editor Mark Brayne, who was
privy to internal editorial discussions in 2010, the BBC has "explicitly
parked climate change in the category 'Done That Already, Nothing New to
Say'." Brayne added:

On climate change, that BBC journalistic urgency to be seen to be fair
now means, after a period between Al Gore's Inconvenient Truth and the
disaster of \[the 2009 UN Climate Summit in\] Copenhagen when global
warming was everywhere in the output, that the Corporation has been
bending over backwards to reflect the opposite, sceptical view.

Consider the analogy of two men at a bar, says Brayne. One man claims
that two plus two equals four, and the other that two plus two equals
six. The BBC solution to this disagreement? "Put them both on the Today
Programme, and the answer clearly lies somewhere in the middle."

The Today programme, BBC Radio 4's "agenda-setting" morning programme,
is a serial offender when it comes to irresponsible climate coverage. On
July 13 this year, veteran interviewer John Humphrys interviewed Ralph
Cicerone, president of the US National Academy of Sciences. Part of the
interview went like this:

JH: "But to say nearly every spot on the globe has warmed significantly
over the past 30 years and indeed the entire planet is warming is
different from saying it's going to continue to warm to such an extent
that we have to spend vast and unimaginable amounts of money to protect
ourselves against a catastrophe that many people, some distinguished
scientists say, isn't actually proven."

RC: "Well of course the way you've worded it, it was quite strong; 'vast
and unimaginable sums of money', I don't think I've heard anybody make
such a proposal."

Moments later, Humphrys made the idiotic assertion that: "You can't
absolutely prove that CO2 in the atmosphere is responsible for global
warming."

As climate writers Christian Hunt and Ros Donald put it politely:

If the Today programme brought this level of research and preparation to
interviewing politicians, it probably wouldn't be taken particularly
seriously.

In fact, the standard of political debate on Today, as with the rest of
BBC News, is on a similarly appalling level: routinely tilted towards
state-corporate power, and all at public expense.

Meanwhile, BBC News happily chunters along issuing a stream of articles
and broadcasts about Britain's "dreadful weather" this year and how it
has, for example, "cost rural Britain £1bn" in lost income. But you
would be hard pressed to find any links drawn between this and
human-induced climate change.

Guarding the Mythology of "Feeble Response"

Greens like to flock to the Guardian almost as though it were the house
paper of the environment movement. One recent Guardian editorial noted
that:

Pessimists in the climate change community warn that within the next
century global mean temperatures could rise by 6C. A fierce, sustained
drought in the US, with 170 all-time US heat records broken in June
alone, has already hurt world food stocks.

These are important points. But given the observed rapid changes in the
Arctic under global warming, the Guardian's pejorative use of
"pessimists" should probably be replaced with "realists". The Guardian
continued:

**[[The global response to these signals of potential calamity has so
far been feeble]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

[This hugely understates the problem. But, even more damning, **it
diverts attention from root causes**. As mentioned earlier, huge vested
interests have mounted decades-long campaigns of disinformation, fierce
lobbying and intimidation to subvert and bully governments into (a)
avoiding what needs to be done in the face of climate chaos; and (b)
providing tax breaks, subsidies and other measures to enhance rapacious
corporate practices under the guise of boosting economic "growth" and
"job creation" (newspeak terms for corporate profits).]{.underline}

Senior Guardian editorial staff seem unable to move beyond the same
anodyne waffle they have been publishing for thirty years:

Britain's "greenest government ever" has shown what it thinks of
scientific evidence, by placing a homeopathic medicine enthusiast in
charge of the National Health Service, and a reputed climate sceptic as
environment secretary. The outlook is not promising.

[The Guardian has **[almost nothing to say about the deep-rooted changes
required]{.mark} to redress the imbalance of power** in society; [or
about its own role in]{.mark} [pushing climate-damaging policies]{.mark}
and practices.]{.underline} The Guardian is a corporate newspaper
dependent on advertisers for around 70 per cent of its income. Put
simply, like other corporate media, it is part of the problem.

Media Malpractice -- Challenging the Decline in Coverage

In the US, climate blogger Joe Romm notes that the decline in corporate
media climate coverage has been well documented, both in print and the
evening news. Bill Blakemore of ABC News observes that a number of the
climate scientists "are perplexed by --- and in some cases furious with
--- American news directors." Blakemore elucidates:

"Malpractice!" is typical of the charges this reporter has heard highly
respected climate experts level --- privately, off the record --- at my
professional colleagues over the past few years.

[Complaints include what seems to the scientists a willful omission of
overwhelming evidence the new droughts and floods are worsened by man
made global warming, [and unquestioning repetition]{.mark}, gullible at
best, [of transparent]{.mark} **[anti-science propaganda credibly
reported to be funded by fossil fuel interests and anti-regulation
allies]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Blakemore adds that he has spoken with climate scientists who "agree
with those, including NASA scientist James Hansen, who charge that
fossil fuel CEOs are guilty of a 'crime against humanity,' given the
calamity that unregulated greenhouse emissions are quickly bringing on."
[With 100 million deaths from global warming predicted by 2030, the
charge is no hyperbole. Indeed this surely represents the greatest crime
in all human history. And yet governments and big business, shielded by
the corporate media, are getting away with it.]{.underline}

It probably comes as no surprise that the worst US media offenders
belong to the Murdoch stable. A study by the Union of Concerned
Scientists (UCS) shows that Fox News had been "misleading" viewers about
climate science in 93 per cent of primetime programmes that addressed
the subject over a six-month period in 2012. Fox News hosts and guests
"mocked and disparaged statements from scientists and drowned out
genuine scientific assertions with cherry-picked data and false claims."
The opinion pages of the Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal performed
slightly better: only 81 per cent of the examples studied were
misleading, according to the UCS analysis. Similar surveys of the UK
media are sorely needed. And, more to the point, action taken to
challenge this corporate media complicity in history's premier crime.

We have to re-examine our assumptions about what might be most effective
in changing things for the better. For years, left and green activists
have argued that we should work with corporate media to reach a wider
public. For a long time the argument may have seemed unassailable. But
after decades of accelerating planetary devastation and rapidly
declining democracy, the argument has weakened to the point of collapse.
By a process of carefully rationed corporate "inclusion", the honesty,
vitality and truth of environmentalism have been corralled, contained,
trivialised and stifled.

Corporate media "inclusion" of dissent has deceived the public with the
illusion of openness and change, while business-as-usual has taken us
very far in the opposite direction. Ironically, meek "cooperation" has
handed influence and control to the very forces seeking to disempower
dissent. And in the absence of serious left/green criticism, corporate
media performance has actually deteriorated.

Why should progressives help this system sell the illusion that the
corporate media offers a "wide spectrum of views" when its biased output
overwhelmingly and inevitably promotes Permanent War for resources and
war on the planet? The corporate media must be confronted with the
reality of what it is, and what it has done. It is vital that this be
highlighted to the public it has been deceiving.

While the power of the internet remains relatively open, there is a
brief window to free ourselves from the shackles of the corporate media
and to build something honest, radical and publicly accountable. Climate
crisis is already upon us, with much worse likely to come. The stakes
almost literally could not be higher.

### Impact---Biodiversity---2NC

#### Capitalist priorities incentivize bracketing out alternatives in favor of ecological destruction that is justified by gaining profit. 

**Rappel 21**\-\--Chief Executive for Gwent Wildlife Trust and
conservation ecologist with a masters in ecology (Ian, "The habitable
Earth: biodiversity, society and rewilding", International Socialism,
4/15/21, https://isj.org.uk/the-habitable-earth/) sh

[Today's biodiversity crisis is **a product of capitalism
alone**.]{.underline} This assertion is an important one to make for a
number of reasons.

The most significant interrelationship between Earth's biodiversity and
human society occurs across the human food chain---agriculture and
fisheries. At an overarching level, [all pre-capitalist social
formations---even where they caused ecological disruption and localised
extinctions---depended on a functional dialectical interrelationship
with biodiversity to maintain their means and modes of
production;]{.underline} the productivity of their agricultural soil and
wild food sources. That said, there is little doubt that our prehistoric
ancestors, both before and after the neolithic agricultural revolution
10,000 years ago, would have pushed certain species to the brink and
beyond. The global expansion of Homo sapiens in our pre-agricultural
phase coincided with extinction of megafauna---animals over 50
kg---including iconic species such as the sabre-toothed tiger in the
Americas, the woolly mammoth across northern latitudes and the moa in
New Zealand. Whether or not these incidents resulted from the actions of
our ancestors alone or the combined forces of human agency and climate
change, the ecological changes that such events provoked would have been
significant at local and regional levels. In many cases, however, the
ecological roles of these large animals were subsequently taken up by
human beings themselves as they pushed and pulled at local ecosystems to
generate their own social metabolism through the controlled use of fire,
shifting agriculture and the proactive management of woodlands, tundra
and savannah.

In the intervening millennia between the neolithic agricultural
revolution and the end of feudalism the ecological impact of human
groups would have carried at least as many benefits for biodiversity as
threats. This is because human society and culture formed one of the key
dynamics within regional ecology. [The patterns of biodiversity that
emerged through the interplay between pre-capitalist societies and
nature resulted in an ecological dynamic that enhanced biodiversity
through the constant low-level intervention of rotational subsistence
agriculture and habitat control for hunting]{.underline}. By keeping
ecological niches open that would otherwise have closed through the
natural process of ecological succession, human settlements created a
diverse mosaic of habitats around themselves. [This ecological pattern
meant that biodiversity became increasingly embedded within
anthropogenic systems and structures.]{.underline} And, because
pre-capitalist social structures and cultures varied, so too did their
attendant patterns of biodiversity.

In Europe the types of extensive agriculture historically associated
with low input farming and peasant land use appear to have been
positively beneficial for biodiversity. Figure 3 indicates a peak in
biodiversity for many taxa at these low intensity land use levels. For
certain significant taxa the biodiversity level is higher even than that
associated with the "unmanaged" conditions often presumed to replicate
original "natural" ecology. This pattern explains why land abandonment
is seen as a threat to biodiversity and why much of Europe's
conservation is geared towards replicating historic modes of agriculture
through conservation grazing and the like.11

From the 16th century, [as capitalism entered the world stage, this
diverse pattern of agricultural and semi-natural habitats became subject
to the same disruption as those human societies that were initially
touched, then subsumed]{.underline}, by an expanding global economy.
[This crucial juncture ushered in the fundamental tipping point in our
interrelationship with the rest of life.]{.underline} The conjuncture of
early capitalism and the shared evolutionary progress of human
organisation "fused early modern states (and quasi state structures such
as chartered trading companies) and markets and raised them to new
levels of capacity and efficiency. These newly powerful institutions,
acting in concert, intensified human impacts on the natural environment
in nearly every region of the world".12

[A recent historical assessment of anthropogenic changes to the Earth's
biosphere reveals the global significance of early
capitalism]{.underline}---particularly at the birth-points of capitalist
agriculture and urbanisation (figure 4).13

This graph also highlights the period from 1750 to 1900 as that in which
human purchase on the biosphere rapidly accelerates. This expansionary
phase is picked out by the author as being the consequence of
"population growth and European expansion into the Americas". There's
little doubt that these factors have been influential.14 However, the
rapid rates of planetary subjugation to human influence from 1750
onwards are more accurately located in the rapid spread of capitalism
following the industrial revolution and its application to
imperialism/colonialism, global trade and early mechanised agriculture.
Figure 4 also illustrates why conservationists' efforts to push back the
timeline of the Sixth Extinction to include pre-capitalist human history
are difficult to justify. Tim Flannery, for instance, argues: "Since our
emergence from Africa fifty thousand years ago, the sweep of human
history has been a tale of destruction that has crippled one ecosystem
after another".15 The reasons why popular scientists such as Flannery
proffer such ­historically dubious arguments will be discussed shortly.
For now it is sufficient to counter by pointing out that the Sixth
Extinction is a global event.

Before 1500---and more specifically before the industrial and
agricultural revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries---human society
simply lacked the necessary technical ability and spatial reach to
"cripple" ecosystems and threaten extinction at any significant
geographical or geological scale[. Pre-capitalist societies, in their
quest to survive, manipulated biodiversity to the best of their
abilities for sure---but their societal forms would still have been
essentially bound by the material forces of nature]{.underline}. On this
point above all, what [the preceding graph highlights is the historical
moment at which the development of industrial capitalism effectively
allowed humanity to smash through the ceiling of so-called natural
limits]{.underline}.

[Industrial capitalism created the means by which humanity]{.underline}
could initially liberate itself from nature. But by doing so on a finite
planet, this could only be [achieved]{.underline} through [the
displacement of biodiversity.]{.underline} The total percentage of the
biosphere commanded wholly for human consumption rose from 10 percent in
1750, to roughly 60 percent by the end of the 20th century. [By this
time 50 percent of the biosphere had been diverted towards capitalist
agriculture]{.underline} (croplands and rangelands). This figure
represents the high water mark for agriculture since today pretty much
all the land surface that can lend itself to farming has been
commandeered.16

#### Biodiversity loss is inseparable from capitalist production and shows a clear root cause. 

**Rappel 21**\-\--Chief Executive for Gwent Wildlife Trust and

[The trends in biodiversity loss revealed]{.underline} by the LPI point
[an ­accusatory finger at neoliberalism and the capitalist mode of
production.]{.underline} The pattern of [humanity's history of biosphere
domination]{.underline} likewise [highlights the development of
capitalism as the most significant trigger point]{.underline} for our
global domination of earth's biosphere. [Capitalism itself drives the
root causes for biodiversity loss through its emphasis on commodity
production and its own ecological patterns that substitute artificial
inputs in place of natural ecological functions.]{.underline}

Conservationists have occasionally attempted to deal explicitly with
these links between capitalism and biodiversity loss. The most radical
critiques of capitalism and its impact on biodiversity were voiced at
the high point of the anti-capitalist movement at the turn of the
century. Around this time there were calls from environmental NGOs for
the impact of poverty, inequality and multinational corporations to be
recognised as root drivers of biodiversity loss.21 A substantial World
Wildlife Fund (WWF) report from this time argued: Only by exploring and
understanding the socioeconomic factors at various levels---local,
regional, national and international---that drive people to degrade the
natural environment will we be able to change this behaviour. To find
more effective conservation solutions, we must step back and look at the
complex set of influences on local resource use that constitute the root
causes of biodiversity loss.22

In contrast, [today's calls from neoliberal environmental economists for
the commodification of nature]{.underline},23 and the definition of
biodiversity as "natural capital" by conservation NGOs such as WWF24
[can be interpreted as a rather desperate capitulation towards
capitalism]{.underline} in the hope that global corporations and nation
states will save the day by establishing formal markets in "ecosystem
services".25

Away from these mixed efforts, the prevailing narrative around the
causes of the Sixth Extinction is dominated by scientists and authors
who seek explanations in our human biology rather than our societal
anatomy. In general, these arguments follow the standard contours of
biological determinism. This school of thought locates its explanations
for patterns in human behaviour, societies and cultures within human
biology, DNA and biological evolution. Here, [as with all the other
social ills such as war and greed, our supposed "ecocidal" tendencies
are presented as unshakable genetic constituents of our species
being]{.underline}.26 Elizabeth Kolbert's position is typical: "Though
it might be nice to imagine there once was a time when man lived in
harmony with nature, it's not clear that he ever really did".27

Examples of this approach dominate the "popular science" shelves of
today's bookshops through works by leading public scientists such as
Stewart Brand, James Lovelock, Jared Diamond, Edward O Wilson and Tim
Flannery.28 That some of these authors approach such views is to be
expected (E O Wilson is the father of "sociobiology") but other more
recent converts to biological determinism have been surprising. George
Monbiot, for example, in arguing for strong links between human
prehistory and megafauna extinctions, laments: "Is this all we are? A
diminutive monster that can leave no door closed, no hiding place
intact... Or can we stop? Can we use our ingenuity, which for two
million years has turned so inventively to destruction, to defy our
evolutionary history?"29 These essentially sociobiological arguments are
compounded by their advocates' simplified interpretation of the
relationship between humans and nature. In this regard these
commentators are guilty of ecologism: "the use of ecological terminology
or simplistic interpretations of ecological concepts in support of
political or moral arguments".30

[Tackling biological determinist and ecologist arguments is important
because of their assumptions regarding human behaviour]{.underline} and
the implications of such for human-nature relations. Biological
determinism (sociobiology and its contemporary expression as
evolutionary psychology) assigns all human social and cultural behaviour
to fixed genetic and evolutionary origins.31 If this holds, [then
humanity's role as harbinger of the biodiversity crisis carries a degree
of historical inevitability since it suggests that humans are inherently
harmful for biodiversity and that human-nature relations will forever be
conflict-ridden]{.underline}. The options open to us from this are
limited: either enforce authoritarian control over the actions and the
population size of our species (Malthusianism), or hope that somewhere
deep within our genetic make-up we may hold properties that will counter
our destructive tendencies (E O Wilson's Biophilia hypothesis).32

As discussed already there are fundamental reasons why the argument that
humans have been forever destructive of biodiversity does not hold. [But
the chief problem with biological determinism stems from its
ontology.]{.underline} By placing human society and history within the
straitjacket of biological determinism, these commentators are guilty of
disciplinary ­cross-contamination. As biologist Richard Lewontin points
out, "Biology is not physics, because organisms are such complex
physical objects, and sociology is not biology, because human societies
are made by ­self-conscious organisms".33

[In 1957 America was gripped by [fears of a "missile gap]{.mark}" with
the Soviet Union. The Kremlin had stunned the world with a test flight
of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) and the launch of
Sputnik. An [American]{.mark} intelligence report [predicted]{.mark}
that by 1962, the [Soviets]{.mark} could [have 500 ICBMs]{.mark},
outstripping America's arsenal. **[When word]{.mark} of that
[leaked,]{.mark} a [political furore erupted]{.mark}.**
Eyeing]{.underline} the presidency [from his Senate seat, John F.
[Kennedy demanded action to prevent]{.mark} a [Soviet "shortcut to world
domination.]{.mark}" It was [bunkum.]{.mark} By his 1961 inauguration,
spooks had new satellite images. **The [Soviets]{.mark} actually
[had]{.mark} about [six]{.mark} ICBMs late that year, [to America's
60]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [But Kennedy stayed the course; his [rhetoric
and continued]{.mark} atomic [buildup stoked tensions]{.mark} with the
Kremlin [that erupted in the]{.mark} Cuban [missile crisis]{.mark}. As
for the prior years, Lyndon Johnson would observe in 1967: "We were
doing things we didn't need to do. We were building things we didn't
need to build."]{.underline} Military history is rich with tales of a
similar cautionary ilk: overestimating an adversary can be as risky as
underrating one. Aerial drones, cyber-espionage and high-resolution
satellite imagery promised better results. [And yet [egregious
miscalculation continues]{.mark}. Recently Western governments were
stunned by the poor performance of Russian forces in
Ukraine.]{.underline} All of which raises a high-stakes question for
America and the rest of the world: how accurate is their appraisal of
China's military power? China's armed forces, known as the People's
Liberation Army (PLA), have undergone an extraordinary transformation.
When China normalised relations with America and began opening its
economy in 1979, the PLA was an ill-equipped force designed to fight on
its land borders. Even that was not something it did well, as Vietnam
showed that year when it repelled a Chinese invasion. Today, China
boasts the world's biggest army and navy, its third-largest air force
and one of its most potent arsenals of conventional missiles, including
some that can hit America's Pacific bases. And though America and Russia
each have more than ten times as many nuclear warheads, China is
modernising its stockpile, which the Pentagon believes could double to
1,000 by 2030. The PLA has grown more active, too. It has built
artificial islands in the South China Sea and regularly sends ships and
planes to enforce maritime claims there. Its troops have clashed with
India's on a disputed Himalayan border. It has opened its first overseas
base, in Djibouti, and wants more. And it has significantly expanded
operations around Taiwan, the self-governed island that China claims and
America pledges to help defend. Alarmed by China's build-up, senior
American military commanders have warned that an attack on Taiwan could
be imminent. And yet, seen from Beijing, the PLA is still far from being
ready for war with America. To feel assured of victory in a conflict
such as one over Taiwan, it must overcome several old problems,
including a convoluted command structure, inadequate logistics and a
lack of combat experience, having not fought a war since the one with
Vietnam. It must also confront new challenges, including lessons from
the war in Ukraine, American curbs on high-tech exports to China and a
dearth of technologically skilled recruits. The PLA must also battle
what President Xi Jinping has called "peace disease", a lax internal
culture bred from decades without fighting. For much of that time the
armed forces grew notorious for their far-reaching and often corrupt
business dealings. Their most deadly engagement in the last 44 years was
with their own countrymen, in the massacre of protesters in Beijing in
1989. All this must be done in an authoritarian system that discourages
reporting problems to the top, impeding reform efforts. Since 2016 Mr Xi
has tried to modernise the PLA with its biggest overhaul in six decades,
streamlining its ossified Soviet-era structures and trying to enable
joint operations among all services. But that is taking longer than
hoped. A crackdown on indiscipline has fallen short, judging by the
sacking in July of the two top generals in the PLA Rocket Force, which
handles nuclear and conventional missiles. They are believed to be under
investigation for corruption or leaking secrets. American officials
think General Li Shangfu, who was sacked as defence minister in October,
is also in custody. This special report will examine the PLA's
vulnerabilities, rather than its strengths, and explore their
implications for America and its allies. The aim is not to portray the
PLA as a "paper tiger": the threat it poses is real.

[The goal rather is to provide balance to a public debate that has at
times resembled the more paranoid periods of the cold war, and risks
replicating that era's errors. Guessing game Like their cold-war
forebears, intelligence officers assessing the PLA often focus on
hardware. Much of it is visible from space, in parades or during
exercises. Hardware is also easy to represent in war games. But gauging
a country's capacity to use such equipment in war is far harder. So too
is assessing China's strategic intent.]{.underline} [That often involves
parsing ambiguous public remarks. A case in point is the discussion
around when China might attack Taiwan. Soon after taking power in 2012,
Mr Xi linked Taiwan's unification with the mainland to his broader goal
of "national rejuvenation" by 2049, the centenary of Communist rule. In
2017 he set the PLA a new target of being "basically" modernised by
2035. Then, three years later, he ordered it to speed progress towards
modernisation by its own centenary in 2027. American [officials
say]{.mark} they have [intelligence suggesting that Mr Xi has ordered
the PLA to have the capability to invade Taiwan by 2027. **That does not
mean he has decided to attack by then,**]{.mark} **says William Burns,
the CIA chief**. But such **[distinctions are often lost in
media]{.mark} coverage, political [debate]{.mark} and remarks from
military leaders**.]{.underline}

Take, for example, Air Force General Mike Minihan's recent warning to
his officers: "My gut tells me we will fight in 2025." The lack of
nuance is, to an extent, understandable. Mr Xi could miscalculate, as
Russia's leader, Vladimir Putin, did on Ukraine. And even if Mr Xi does
not plan to attack Taiwan by 2027, it makes sense for America to
prepare. For its military chiefs that means motivating troops, seeking
congressional funding and battling over resources between services and
regional commands. But some China hawks say America must do much more:
cut down on visas for Chinese tech students; double defence spending
(and the size of the navy); deploy a surge of forces to Asia; and
explicitly end more than 40 years of "strategic ambiguity" about whether
America would directly defend Taiwan. Many Republicans cite focusing on
China as a reason to cut support for Ukraine. And in perhaps the most
direct echo of the late 1950s, some are demanding a significant
expansion of America's nuclear arsenal. Many academic, military and
intelligence experts on the PLA---in the West and among China's
neighbours---fear that such measures could backfire.

[[If America escalates]{.mark} support for Taiwan too far[, it could
convince Mr Xi that he has to strike]{.mark}, ready or not. An American
defence splurge now might be hard to sustain and could cause
vulnerabilities later when that equipment is retired and new types of
arms are needed. Attracting China's tech talent helps to undermine its
military ambitions. Cutting support for Ukraine could hand the Kremlin a
victory that would ultimately strengthen Mr Xi. And a big American
nuclear build-up could push the world further into a new nuclear arms
race.]{.underline}

### Impact---Climate---2NC

**Extractivist logic [locks]{.underline} the Arctic into a [colonial
pattern]{.underline} of [short-term exploitation]{.underline} that risks
[irreversible]{.underline} ecological degradation.**

**Kröger,** **21** -- Professor in Global Development Studies at the
University of Helsinki. (Markus Kröger. "ARCTIC RESOURCE EXTRACTION IN
THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE CRISES AND ECOLOGICAL COLLAPSES," University of
Auckland, pg. 229-230. Accessed: 7-14-2025)//ilake-mc

The aforementioned discussion has focused on the biophysical changes
which strongly suggest that [future resource rushes in the Arctic will
not take place in the way fathomed thus far]{.underline}. The bulk of
global and Arctic resource extraction has focused on hydrocarbons. This
energy sector is also the most important due to the pivotal role it has
played and continues to play in emissions. There are, however, also
other important sectors that are also causing climatic and ecological
impacts, and are involved in land grabbing across the Arctic.
Hydrocarbon projects have been placed on Indigenous lands and
periodically put Indigenous and conservation areas at risk, as studies
in Alaska and Russia (Kumpula et al. 2011) have shown. Wilson and
Stammler (2016) have introduced a special issue around Arctic
extractivisms, arguing how [[extractivist logics]{.mark} have
[pushed]{.mark} many [locals into supporting]{.mark} [extractivist
projects]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, there are variations to this,
and [since 2016]{.underline}, [there has been significant mobilization
against extractivism in the Arctic]{.underline}, for example among the
Sámi (Kuokkanen 2019). Locals have engaged in such acts of resistance as
countermapping their territories against mining projects' mapping of
"resources," and in emphasizing the place-specific, unique qualities
which cannot be compensated if destroyed by open-pit mines (Lassila
2018; 2020). In comparison to the Global South, with its heavily
oppressive and violent polities and contexts of extraction, the Arctic
setting does seem to offer some more room for agency by locals and
would-be resistance against extractive projects, even in Russia
according to Stammler and Ivanova (2016). Yet, here as elsewhere, this
resistance does not surge aut2omatically as a response to grievances but
needs to be built by active agency and specific resistance strategies
(Kröger 2013; 2020). While I have argued here that much of the Arctic
land and resource rush remains at the level of hype and will not be
realized due to the climate and ecological collapses, there are several
existing and new projects in parts of the Arctic that are currently
expanding. [These include mining projects to secure rare earth and other
minerals for the transition to battery- based electric vehicles as a
supposed solution in a move away from hydrocarbons. The moves to expand
wind energy have been heavily criticized for the damage it causes, and
because it leads to land grabbing of Indigenous land in the Global
South]{.underline} (Dunlap & Jakobsen 2020). Lapland is now starting to
experience these conflicts related to wind farm expansion plans.
Resistance experiences of what works in the Global South, where people
have already experienced heavily violent extractive expansions and
learned how to resist them (see Kröger 2020), could be used by the
Arctic populations to resist land grabs in their region. In fact, this
is already happening, as the Arctic is becoming increasingly global, and
connected to all sorts of global politics and interactions (Finger &
Heininen 2019). Unequal economic and ecological exchange are also
affecting local communities and even states targeted for new resource
extraction in the Arctic. For example, Finland has the world's most
pro-corporate royalty and mining revenue distribution regime in the
world (Kröger 2016). [Most of the [increased interest]{.mark} in the
Arctic [as a massive untapped source of resources]{.mark} and energy
[comes from outside]{.mark} of the region, [which has led]{.mark}
scholars [to]{.mark} see the Arctic scramble as a sort of continuation
of **[resource colonialism]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Gritsenko 2018). In
this game, argues Markowitz (2020), those states which have most
abundant resources, and have tied their economies to resource rents, are
the most likely to project power to grab further resources in the
Arctic. Markowitz (2020) thus emphasizes that [this is not an [all-out
competition for]{.mark} the Arctic [resources]{.mark} -- which he, as is
the convention, sees mostly as being [made more available]{.mark} and
not less available [by climate change]{.mark}]{.underline} (unlike what
I have argued 229 Markus Kröger here) -- but state reactions vary. This
kind of setting of divisions between elites (of different countries)
does offer greater possibilities for those seeking to resist extractive
projects (Kröger 2020). The most likely outcome for the 2020--2030
period is that the earlier melting of the Arctic Ocean will result in
increased shipping, due to the vastly faster and thus cheaper sea route
to China. China will most likely try to exert more influence and
control, but Russia has the highest interest in seeking rents from
controlling the shipping lanes, and extracting more minerals, whose
loading might become easier at some port sites. These mine-port
complexes would, however, need to be located somewhere else than in
fragile and thawing permafrost areas, or otherwise these will be
literally sunk costs rather than profit-making enterprises. Some inland
mines may expand, but hydrocarbon expansion projects beyond what Russia
and Norway are preparing are unlikely, and even the proposed plans might
very well be unrealized. Greenland may see some mines opened, although
its earlier hopes of getting independence by a mining boom have been set
aside recently as local resistance to uranium and other destructive
mines has risen, and locals have come to understand that the dozens of
planned mega-mining projects would destroy existing lived environments.
This said, there has been a notable and quantifiably massive increase in
Arctic mining, which has caused the amount of waste and side rock to
increase tenfold between 2005 and 2010 in Finland for example (Kröger
2016). Nunavut in Canada has also seen expansion projects, for example,
for massive iron ore mines in the Baffin Island. Alaskan communities and
conservation sites are at constant risk, as the policies of President
Trump showed: if a similar candidate comes to power, things might change
rapidly for Alaska, with regional impacts for the Arctic. Policy studies
have therefore recommended making more lasting national and
international laws to ensure the major planetary benefits that a healthy
Arctic has been providing (Carson 2019). These include the reflection of
sunlight by snow and ice cover, whose melting should be prevented, but
is now being exacerbated by flaring in gas and oil refineries in the
Arctic regions, and black smoke from other burning processes (Isomäki
2009). However, there are not many drastic changes to these industrial
activities currently underway, as many think, there is still plenty of
time in the future to mitigate the damages. However, [[if these
activities continue unabated for too long]{.mark}, the potential changes
might come too late to have significant impact]{.underline}. [That is,
the [ecological degradation]{.mark} [might be too severe for
reversal]{.mark} if proactive action is not taken]{.underline}. French
(2019) argues that [because of the Arctic and other tipping points, it
is unlikely that there will be a chance of continuing in the old way of
first doing and then learning from one's mistakes]{.underline}, but the
paradigm should change into building on the burgeoning knowledge on the
high risks of extraction and only then exploiting (within environmental
boundaries).

#### Unsustainable. climate-driven instability make long-term infrastructure projects a [speculative hype]{.underline}.

**Kröger,** **21** -- Professor in Global Development Studies at the
University of Helsinki. (Markus Kröger. "ARCTIC RESOURCE EXTRACTION IN
THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE CRISES AND ECOLOGICAL COLLAPSES," University of
Auckland, pg. 230-231. Accessed: 7-14-2025)//ilake-mc

The most important contribution that the addition of the Arctic to the
bulk of knowledge brings is that the Arctic is not merely just one more
case of where land rushes have risen. [There are myriad opportunities to
draw broader theoretical and empirical understandings on the phenomena
included and related to global **[land grabbing]{.mark}** [due to the
unique dynamics]{.mark} [in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}; [including,
the Arctic's natural conditions, the changes in Northern polities, the
**particularity of international relations**, and the rapidly changing
interrelations between **climate**, ecological **crises**, and
ecological **collapses**]{.underline}. [The climate is warming two to
three times faster in the Arctic than the global average]{.underline}.
Permafrost melting is making extraction of minerals and fossil fuels
much more difficult, risky, and even impossible, as infra structures
that have been built with great sunk costs are deteriorating and
spreading pollution into the Arctic areas, especially in Russia but also
elsewhere. The rapidly advancing climate catastrophe can already be
observed, firsthand, in the Arctic. This can provide insights into what
kinds of dynamics can be expected elsewhere. [The [Arctic is likely to
see rapid collapses of extractive infrastructures]{.mark} [amid high
hopes for expanding]{.mark} them]{.underline}. The coming climate
catastrophe is largely neglected in current Arctic policies. [Yet,
other-than- human agency can fast and abruptly change the contours of
resource and commodity frontiers]{.underline}. Such drastic events may
offer space for positive and fast political responses. If the Arctic
reaches its tipping points, such as runaway permafrost thawing, there is
no return to the Holocene's stable climatic (and thus political)
conditions (Francis 2018). I argue that the whole social scientific
apparatus needs to dramatically shift to incorporate the politics at
these tipping points, as the current way of treating the global climate
crisis still shows a continued rise in emissions. But how long can this
continue, when major tipping points are reached and start to show their
impacts? Will these tipping point politics have radically different ways
of doing politics and understanding the role of other-than-human nature
and its role in affecting political possibilities? I argue that these
tipping points need to be further incorporated into analyses and
policies beforehand to prevent them from materializing. This chapter has
offered an example of how to incorporate existing climatic forecasting
research with social scientific studies, in this case, the current state
and future outlook of a land and resource rush and grab in the Arctic
along the lines of what has happened in the 2000s in the Global South. I
have argued that this land and resource grab is less likely in the
Arctic, [given [the rapidly changing climatic conditions]{.mark} such as
permafrost thawing [and]{.mark} the [overall unpredictability]{.mark}
[and ecological instability]{.mark} of the region]{.underline}, [which
[make]{.mark} much of the]{.underline} . [While the 2005--2020 period
did see a notable and major expansion of resource extraction and land
grabbing in many parts of the Arctic, as elsewhere around the
world]{.underline} (Kröger 2019) [due to the global commodity boom, this
tendency is likely to be at least attenuated, if not reversed, given the
rising costs, risks, and instabilities of Arctic resource
extraction]{.underline}.

[Colonization has had detrimental effects on Indigenous communities,
resulting in extensive disruptions and devastation]{.underline}. This
[has been primarily manifested through the dispossession of land, forced
resettlement, and the fragmentation of landscape]{.underline}s, which
have collectively impeded and, in certain cases, severed the essential
connections Indigenous Peoples have with their ancestral territories
(Ford et al. **2020**). The [Arctic has experienced colonization in the
past and continues to be partially colonized because of the expansion of
new commodity frontiers]{.underline} (Hanaček et al. **2022**), and the
region is viewed as a semi-colonial resource and commodity frontier
(Engerman **2003**; Körber, MacKenzie, and Stenport **2017**). [Climate
change is only one of many drivers of change. Its effects cannot be
isolated from the social, political, economic, and environmental changes
confronting present-day Indigenous and marginalized
communities]{.underline}. These impacts interact together and induce
exacerbating and cascading effects (Nakashima et al. **2012**; Naylor
et al. **2020**). Displacement and fragmentation of the land challenge
Indigenous knowledge systems and institutions, exacerbated by
environmental change. These [vulnerabilities are linked to colonization,
globalization, and development patterns, highlighting the need to
address structural challenges]{.underline} (Ford et al. **2020**). The
[impacts of climate change bear a profound connection to colonial
assumptions and practices, necessitating a comprehensive evaluation of
these assumptions and exclusion]{.underline}s. It is crucial to
recognize the wider colonial and political--economic backdrop within
which Indigenous Peoples experience the impacts of climate change
(Cameron **2012**).

The [dislocation of Indigenous communities from their ancestral lands
has had significant implications for their resilience and knowledge
systems. Younger generations are becoming less connected to traditional
knowledge due to land dispossession]{.underline}, which affects their
ability to understand and respond to environmental conditions (Ford
et al. **2020**). Young Indigenous People today spend less time involved
in subsistence activities, resulting in fewer opportunities to learn
necessary skills for safe travel and hunting in changing climatic
conditions (Pearce et al. **2015**). [Arctic Indigenous Peoples, like
Inuit in Canada, have been severely affected by colonization,
capitalism, and economic, industrial, and military drivers behind
anthropogenic climate change, resulting in climate-related risks, loss
of language, tradition, knowledge, and traditional practices, as well as
impacts on health and economic sustainability]{.underline}
(Whyte **2019**; Friedrich **2023**; Mustonen **2013**). Arctic
Political Ecology analyzes these issues to uncover and understand the
historically rooted power dynamics and social implications associated
with exploitation and climate change. It provides a thorough examination
of historical factors, cosmological beliefs, and management strategies
to gain insight into how these communities perceive and adapt to
environmental changes and how the ramifications of the historical
factors create the current vulnerability.

Arctic Indigenous Peoples have experienced significant social change
imposed by external influences such as explorers, settlers,
missionaries, and governments (Hanrahan **2012**), linking Arctic
changes with broader context of political ecology. [The resilience and
vulnerability to environmental change are socially constructed and
linked to issues of sovereignty, power, social justice, development, and
history]{.underline}. In the Arctic, this involves recognizing and
protecting Indigenous sovereignty and rights, which can include measures
like political devolution, resolving land claims, acknowledging
customary regulations and institutions, protecting Indigenous lands and
resources, and incorporating Indigenous knowledge and institutions into
resource management (Ford et al. **2020**). [Failure to address root
causes and political dynamics can lead to governance traps and harm
Indigenous Peoples]{.underline} (Morrison et al. **2020**;
Whyte **2020**; Eriksen et al. **2021**).

Political ecology suggests that [the connection between climate change
and economic interests in the Arctic is inseparable from the ongoing
local struggles against historically unjust and disproportionately
adverse socioenvironmental consequences in territories primarily
inhabited by Indigenous Peoples]{.underline} (Avango and
Roberts **2017**; Cameron **2012**). [The extraction of
commodities]{.underline} such as gold, oil, and natural gas [has
historically incurred, and continues to incur, significant social and
environmental costs]{.underline} (McDowell and Ford **2014**;
Shadian **2018**). The [extensive extraction activities, coupled with
the current climate change, pose substantial threats to the
liveliho]{.underline}ods, socioenvironmental conditions, and cultural
well-being of communities (Alvarez, Yumashev, and Whiteman **2020**).
These [threats manifest in various ways, including restricted access to
their land, loss of territorial rights, negative impacts on health,
biodiversity depletion, and the erosion of culture and identity
associated with alterations in their surrounding icescapes]{.underline}
(Herrmann and Heinämäki **2017**; Malik et al. **2024**). The Arctic has
experienced significant extraction activities on both Indigenous and
non-Indigenous lands, prompting local communities and others to resist
these activities (Kröger **2019**). [People are demanding greater
participation in addressing issues of physical exploitation and climate
change in the region]{.underline} (Nuttall **2013**), which pose
challenges to extractive industries, states, and other entities with
economic interests that endanger the environment and the traditional way
of life of local communities (Dwyer and Istomin **2009**;
Kröger **2019**; Bendixen et al. **2022**). Consequently, political
ecology is useful to conduct an analysis of socioenvironmental conflicts
in the Arctic that goes beyond specific countries and commodities to
assess the impact of economic extraction of natural resources on the
traditional ways of life and survival of affected Arctic communities
(Alvarez, Yumashev, and Whiteman **2020**; Lassila **2021**).

Indigenous governance, sovereignty, and control over lands emerged as
important features of independence, resource management,
decision-making, and the right of Indigenous Peoples to govern
Indigenous lands and celebrate and preserve Indigenous cultures in the
Arctic (Liboiron et al. **2021**; Bernauer **2019**; Cadman
et al. **2023**; Snook et al. **2022**). [Indigenous sovereignty over
their lands has played an important role in countering capitalism and
the violent enactment of colonial land relations]{.underline} that claim
access to Indigenous lands (Bankes **2020**; Liboiron **2021**; Snook
et al. **2019**). [Political ecology looks at how power dynamics affect
the distribution and exploitation of resources]{.underline} such as
fisheries, minerals, oil, and gas and evaluates external pressures from
governments, corporations[, and global markets seeking to exploit these
resources]{.underline} (Brock **2023**; Malik **2024**;
Robbins **2019**). By examining power dynamics in the Arctic, Arctic
Political Ecology can offer insights on who bears the costs and benefits
from resource extraction. Arctic Political Ecology places a strong
emphasis on environmental justice, advocating for the equitable
distribution of environmental benefits and burdens. In the Arctic, this
means recognizing Indigenous rights to self-determination, cultural
preservation, and access to resources, and control over productive
resources. The advocacy of Arctic Political Ecology for Indigenous
sovereignty, self-determination, and territorial autonomy aligns with
human rights principles, including the right to participate in decisions
affecting their lands.

The [Arctic is experiencing increased accessibility to resources due to
climate change, but this has led to negative consequences for the
environment]{.underline} and Indigenous communities (Landrum and

benefit a limited number of stakeholders and foreign investors, while
Indigenous communities]{.underline}, pastoralists, and fishermen [bear
the effects]{.underline} (Moore **2018**; Cameron **2012**). Traditional
land-use and territorial rights of Indigenous Peoples are being
undermined by extractive and industrial activities, resulting in the
displacement of common lands and traditional ways of life. Consequently,
[the extensive extraction and utilization of resources are causing
irreversible socioenvironmental damage and fueling intense conflict in
the region]{.underline} (Herrmann and Heinämäki **2017**;
Naykanchina **2012**; Keil **2014**). [The introduction of]{.underline}
wind power (characterized as [green colonialism) is perceived by some
Arctic Indigenous Peoples]{.underline} (e.g., the Sami of the Norwegian
Arctic) [as a continuation of historical processes of dispossession and
colonialism]{.underline}, which disrupt reindeer herding practices
(Soili, Tanja, and Ilari **2021**; Normann **2021**). The ecological
evidence supporting the dominant narrative and associated policy about
the Arctic pastoral landscape overlooks alternative scientific evidence,
interpretations aligned with nonequilibrium ecology, and Indigenous
knowledge of reindeer herders. Consequently, these alternative
perspectives are often ignored by government institutions regulating
caribou management (Benjaminsen et al. **2015**).

The [importance of Arctic Political Ecology is strongly linked to the
impacts of global capitalism]{.underline} and colonialism on Arctic and
Indigenous Peoples. The [influences of global capitalism and colonialism
on Arctic and Indigenous communities have had significant and
wide-ranging consequences, resulting in the commodification and
exploitation of natural resources, the displacement of Indigenous
communities, the loss of traditional livelihoods, environmental
degradation, the expropriation of homelands, and historical trauma
affecting health and well-being]{.underline} (Hanaček et al. **2022**;
Owens **2018**; Smallwood et al. **2021**; Jalata **2011**). Colonialism
and capitalism [have imposed foreign cultural norms and legal systems on
Indigenous Peoples, eroding cultural identity and
self-determination]{.underline} (Dodds and Smith **2023**;
Nuttall **2019**). The impacts of global capitalism and colonialism
intersect [perpetuating power imbalances and marginalization. These
influences have severe environmental implications]{.underline},
including pollution, climate change, and threats to traditional
subsistence practices (Owens **2018**; Hobart **2023**). Indigenous

The Arctic region is rapidly warming and experiencing vast sea ice and
permafrost loss (Landrum and Holland, 2020). The region experienced its
warmest summer on record in 2020, with the second-lowest sea ice cover,
almost reaching the lowest 2012 levels (NASA, 2020a, NASA, 2020b). [The
[sea ice loss contributes to expanding extractive activities]{.mark},
facilitating new shipping routes and, consequently, faster global
trade]{.underline} (Landrum and Holland, 2020; Saebi et al., 2020). [As
one of the remaining land regions with extensive areas of mineral
exploration and extraction potential, the [Arctic is of particular
interest to extractive industries]{.mark}]{.underline} (Boyd et al.,
2015). [The World Economic Forum Global Agenda Council on the Arctic
estimates that total mining, oil, natural gas, and infrastructure
investments will reach 1 trillion USD by 2030]{.underline} (Roston,
2016).

[However, climate change and [economic interests in the Arctic cannot be
separated from local struggles]{.mark} [against historically
unjust]{.mark} and disproportionate socio-environmental [impacts in
areas predominantly inhabited by Indigenous groups]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Avango and Peder, 2003; Cameron, 2012; Keil, 2014; Martinez-Alier,
2002). [European colonization of Arctic lands began in the mid-sixteenth
century]{.underline} (Coates, 1985). [Old and new]{.underline}
commodities (gold, oil, natural gas) were and still are extracted at
substantial social and environmental costs (Shadian, 2018).
[[Arctic]{.mark} peoples, such as [Indigenous groups]{.mark},
pastoralists and fishermen [rely on the land and its natural
resources]{.mark} (Stotts, 2017). Hence, such [large-scale extractive
**investments**]{.mark}, together with contemporary climate change,
**[pose threats to the communities\' livelihood,
socio]{.mark}-[environmental, and cultural
well-being]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Alvarez et al., 2020). [The threats
manifest in the inability of communities to access their land, their
loss of territorial rights, adverse effect on their health, biodiversity
loss, as well as the loss of culture and identity linked to changes in
their surrounding icescapes]{.underline} (Herrmann and Heinämäki, 2017;
John, 2016; Kumpula et al., 2011).

[While the term 'resource frontiers' relates to processes of land
appropriation and exploitation of nature, commoditizing resource
frontiers refers to the extensive biophysical and socio-environmental
transformation of 'underused' areas such as the Arctic today, for
extraction and trade purposes]{.underline} (Kröger and Nygren, 2020;
Moore, 2000[). As the extraction of raw materials and energy in the
Arctic increases, socio-environmental conflicts, as recorded in the
Global Atlas of Environmental Justice]{.underline} (EJAtlas), [are also
expected to increase]{.underline} (Haberl et al., 2019; Kumpula et al.,
2011; Martinez-Alier, 2015; Muradian et al., 2012). [Even if economic
growth would not occur, the extraction of materials and energy and the
disposal of waste, needed to sustain the current world economy, would
expand, because energy dissipates and materials are only recycled to a
small extent]{.underline} (Haas et al., 2015, Haas et al., 2020).
**[[The world economy is not circular; rather, it is
entropic]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Georgescu-Roegen, 1971; Martinez-Alier,
1987).

New resource and extractive frontiers bring an unequal distribution of
socio-environmental well-being for local Indigenous and non-Indigenous
peoples (Kröger, 2022; Peluso and Lund, 2011). However, opposition and
resistance at the extractive frontiers arise globally to protect land,
traditional economies and customary ways of life (Scheidel and
Schaffartzik, 2019). [This resistance against extractive
industrialization results in socio-environmental conflicts
(Martinez-Alier, 2002; Martinez-Alier et al., 2010). Such conflict is
expressed as collective mobilization against investment projects that
cause socio-environmental harm (Martinez-Alier et al., 2016; Temper et
al., 2018). Depending on the location, the actors involved, and the
socio-environmental assets at stake, conflict can take many different
forms and directions, at different stages and of differing
duration]{.underline} (Silva-Macher and Farrell, 2014).

Socio-environmental conflicts, for instance, can arise over access to
and control of land (Ribot and Peluso, 2003) through land enclosure or
its appropriation by state authorities, multinational companies, or
social elites (Robbins, 2012). [[**Conflicts often develop over**
environmental injustices]{.mark} based on class, race, gender, and
ethnicity discriminations (Pulido, 2017; Sultana, 2020). The literature
further indicates that socio-environmental conflict occurs not only as
**[resource conflicts but as a social struggle to preserve the
human-nature relationships]{.mark}** that are threatened through
extractive use and management of the environment, [by either **state or
private entrepreneurs**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Coombes et al., 2012).
Furthermore, conflict can manifest openly, with evident mobilization of
individuals and groups, and can ultimately become a social movement
(Temper et al., 2015). However, conflict can also take more latent
forms, without visible protests (Beltrán, 2015).

Through these different forms of mobilization, [people confront new
extractive frontiers, and call for new and different interpretations of
social justice]{.underline} (Schlosberg, 2013; Schlosberg and
Carruthers, 2010). [Socio-environmental resistance against resource
extraction is thus an essential component in understanding worldview
alternatives to harmful extractive trajectories]{.underline} (Brown et
al., 2010; Cressey, 2011; Kröger, 2020; Zabala, 2019). [The many
attempts to base resistance against extraction on the grounds of
ethno-territorial rights is an example]{.underline} (Kröger and
Lalander, 2016).

Activities at [extractive frontiers involve processes of occupation,
bio-physical transformation and depletion of local socio-environmental
assets]{.underline} (Muradian et al., 2012). [Large-scale extraction has
reached Indigenous and non-Indigenous lands of the Arctic -- awaking the
resistance of local communities and others to these
activities]{.underline} (Kröger, 2019; Kröger, 2016; Lassila, 2020;
Lassila, 2018). [**[People are calling for more active
involvement]{.mark}** in determining issues related to physical
exploitation and climate change in the region]{.underline} (Dorough,
2014; Nuttall, 2013) [[that **challenge extractive industries**]{.mark},
the states, and others [with **economic interests who jeopardize
the**]{.mark} **[environment]{.mark}** and the traditional way of life
of local communities]{.underline} (Dwyer and Istomin, 2009; Kröger,
2019; Naykanchina, 2012). [Thus, an analysis of socio-environmental
conflict in the Arctic beyond specific countries and commodities is
called for to gauge the impact of economic extraction of natural
resources on the traditional ways of life and survival of affected
Arctic communities]{.underline} (Alvarez et al., 2020; Lassila, 2020;
Muradian et al., 2012).

To do so, this article analyses fifty-three socio-environmental
conflicts across the entire Arctic as a single regional unit. Based on
mixed methods of descriptive statistics, regression and network
analysis, we systematically investigate protests against ongoing and
projected resource extraction in the Arctic. The main focus is on social
struggles in the context of the global economy and resource extraction
and the biophysical transformation of the region (Krausmann et al.,
2008). Further, the article, focuses on the human geographies of
resource extraction, such as land degradation, threats to cultural
traditions, the environment, and the marginalization of local
communities.

[**Corporatized [production systems]{.mark}**, set against their role in
climate change, [represent a **planetary system**]{.mark}
[attaching]{.mark} 'contemporary forms of subjugation of [life
to]{.mark} the power of [death]{.mark} (Mbembe and Meintjes 2003, 39)'.
The current excess of production is in the process of
**[bringing]{.mark} multiple species (and potentially
[humanity)]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} the **edge of [extinction]{.mark}** ‐
the death of entire species implies that [for]{.mark}
**[globalised]{.mark}, excessive [mass consumption]{.mark}**, 'Death is
therefore the very principle of excess---an anti‐economy (Mbembe, and
Meintjes 2003, 15)'.]{.underline}

The necropolitics of climate change have become absorbed as a major
feature of the apocalypticism that began in the 1990s, a 'constant and
unavoidable presence in everyday life', fashioning 'a totalising,
interlocked field of discourses and practices that encompasses the
"centre" as well as the "margins," and anti‐ politics as well as
left‐wing and right‐wing politics (Stewart and Harding 1999, 289--290)'.
[In the case of anti‐politics, despite the best efforts of governments,
international constitutions and corporate overseers of globalising
capitalism to contain understandings of change within Swyngedouw\'s
(2010) accepted capitalist order, a rapidly‐growing body of thought and
action understands that the growing **threat is systemic to globalising
capitalism**.]{.underline}

Beginning with a discussion of eschatology and how it relates to
geography in an era of growing menace from climate change, this paper
then discusses a set of geophysical pathways that are directly related
to the excess consumption and waste. The section that follows contains
an analysis of the ways in which increasing sectoral concentration and
corporate domination of the global economy lead us to a
transdisciplinary form of geography which has to follow the
physical‐social dividing line between planetary over‐production and
waste. This section gives a rough outline of eschatological geographies
including some (but not all) areas which are contained within in them,
with an invitation to discuss their wider and more detailed application.

[Each of the IPCC Assessment Reports on climate change has made it
increasingly clear that human activity contributes to global warming:
'[It is **unequivocal that**]{.mark} **[human influence]{.mark} has
[warmed the atmosphere]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} ocean and land' (IPCC 2021,
5). The concerns of the IPCC are reflected in the historical linkage
between past global climate change 'and enhanced levels of potentially
hazardous geological and geomorphological activity' (McGuire 2010,
2318).]{.underline} In the current post‐glacial period of geospheric
hazards though, humanity faces not just considerable differences in
type, time‐scale, and degree of hazards promoted by anthropogenic
warming, but critical needs in understanding the intensity of
interconnection with human actions: 'Perhaps more than any other topic
of geographical inquiry, anthropogenic climate change collapses the
dualism between nature and society, forcing us to confront their very
entanglements (Colven and Thomson 2019)'.

Whereas each IPCC report details specific physical changes and makes
reference to potential results to be achieved from anthropogenic
palliatives, little reference is made to the systemic processes of
material production, structures and actants responsible. Each climate
change factor, from vehicle fuels through beef production to
microplastics, is created by increased materiality through production
systems, a materiality which is accelerating: 'Roughly one third of all
materials that have been extracted or discarded since 1900 have been
mobilised between 2002 and 2015 only' (Krausmann et al. 2018).

[Besides [waste‐derived phenomena]{.mark} such as **[atmospheric]{.mark}
[carbon, ocean acidification and plastic]{.mark}**, recent research has
begun to mention more systemic, less visible issues extending from the
physical phenomena that are the focus of international policy. For
instance, the release of substantial amounts of fresh water from glacial
and ice‐cap release into the oceans is leading not just to sea‐level
rises, but to **[ocean‐bed deformation]{.mark}**, which may lead to
**[increases in seismic activity]{.mark}** through subduction zones. In
addition, the substantial shrinkage in polar ice is also
[leading]{.mark} to **[changes in the planetary albedo and]{.mark}
[perturbation]{.mark}** in the spin of the Earth, which itself can lead
to changes in the deformation rate and mass distribution of tectonic
plates.]{.underline} All of these impact tectonic change, volcanism and
seismicity and, as global climatological changes continue to break
records, there are signs that global warming is increasing (Xu,
Ramanathan, and Victor 2018).

Systems of material over‐production are changing the biophysical
mechanisms on which humanity depends. Current climatological threats and
the potential for a substantial worsening of intensity and frequency
urges us to think profoundly about the eschatological nature of
intensifying consumption at the global scale: 'with the most sober
assessment concerning our future and the dismissing of all kinds of
illusions such as faith in technology and progress in the face of global
problems' (Anikeeva and Taravkov 2019, 1314).

[The **[growth of]{.mark} material over‐production** characterising 21st
century [capitalism]{.mark} constructs technological advance as a
growing systemic stress. This stress [puts humanity in]{.mark} a
position where natural processes of geophysics are increasingly
punctuated by the **disruptive energies of excess human materiality**.
Despite official efforts to select socially‐distanced physical targets
to a business‐like (Carton et al. 2020) 'rather piecemeal and
technocratic approach to the management of carbon emissions' (Methmann
and Rothe 2012), climate change is an **[increasingly lethal systemic
sociotechnical issue]{.mark}** located **[within capitalism]{.mark}**,
socially acclimatized over‐production [leading to **substantial
geophysical change**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[It is increasingly the case that [climate change is **rooted**]{.mark}
[**fundamentally** in the commercial]{.mark} and sociotechnical
imaginaries forming human [behaviour]{.mark} (Szerszynski 2012),
resulting from the accelerated production, replacement and degradation
of **globally‐dominant system products**.]{.underline} Half the emitted
CO2 through production since 1850 remains in the atmosphere (Blunden and
Amdt 2020): 'despite high‐level statements to the contrary there is now
little to no chance of maintaining the global mean surface temperature
at or below 2°C (K. Anderson and Bows 2011, 20)'. [Against [this
systemic reality]{.mark} (as Swyngedouw (2010, 219) points out),
'radical techno‐managerial and socio‐cultural transformations' [are only
**permitted**]{.mark} **to be expressed [within the]{.mark} dominance of
a [capitalist order]{.mark}** that is 'acceptable beyond
dispute'.]{.underline}

Eschatological indicators of global warming have become physically more
evident since 2000; the literal, empirical indicators of possible
destruction through global warming are growing more obvious. Neither are
the limits of eschatological geography trivial; five previous mass
extinctions of life on earth have occurred and one at least, the
Permian‐Triassic extinction (The Great Dying or PTE 251.9 million years
ago) shows indications of having been caused by atmospheric changes
similar to those being created now by human productive systems.

The volcanic outpouring of carbon plus the acidification of oceans
(Clarkson et al. 2015; Penn et al. 2018) before, during and after the
PTE acted as drivers of a long‐lasting extinction. Multiple possible
kill mechanisms driven by PTE changes have been suggested; depletions in
oceanic oxygen, increases in atmospheric methane and methane clathrate
release, volcanism (Huang et al. 2011) and: 'synchronous sea surface and
atmospheric temperature increase, rapid rise in pCO2, and flooding of
shelf areas with anoxic and euxinic waters' (Burgess, Bowring, and Shen
2014: 3319).

Some of these tendencies are in operation now---the IUCN (2019) reports
that oxygen in global oceans has declined by about 2% since 1950 and the
area of ocean waters that are completely anoxic has multiplied by a
factor of four since the 1960s. The effects of climate change are
combining in coastal waters with the substantial increase in
deoxygenation in what are referred to as 'dead zones' created by human
(primarily agricultural) activity (Limburg et al. 2020) ‐ in 1960 there
were some 45 such zones, but the number has doubled every decade or so
and there are now over 700. Waste‐driven change has combined with an
increasing decline in oceanic phytoplankton since the 1800s at about 1%
of the global median per year (Boyce, Lewis, and Worm 2010) ‐
phytoplankton is critical to feeding oceanic species and operates to
maintain the carbon cycle (Falkowksi 2012); combinations of human
activities are driving substantial, lethal changes in the earth\'s
oceans.

Since the PTE, the earth has changed considerably over the last 250
million years; despite recent rapid rises in CO2 levels, current levels
are a mere fraction of those at the Permian‐ Triassic junction (Mulhern
2020). Instead of one large continent (Pangaea) there are multiple
continents, volcanic, seismic, oceanic and tectonic regimes differ
considerably and (at the time of writing) neither is 'one of the most
voluminous continental volcanic eruptions since the origin of animals'
(Burgess and Bowring 2015: 1) occurring. Nonetheless, rising rates of
atmospheric CO2 created anthropogenically are imitating the output of
PTE greenhouse gases: 'Anthropogenic activities are currently re‐leasing
about 7 Gt of C to atmosphere by burning of fossil fuels every year,
which is at least two orders of magnitude faster than the eruption of a
flood basalt province'. (Saunders and Reichow 2009).

Quantities of carbon in the atmosphere aside, the sheer geological speed
of change is already manifesting itself through primary phenomenological
events such as ocean warming and acidification, droughts, rainfall,
wildfires and global ice disappearance. In addition, 'with respect to
ocean acidification and impacts on marine calcifiers, the anthropogenic
carbon input rate is most probably greater than during the PETM, causing
a more severe decline in ocean pH and saturation state'. (R. E. Zeebe,
Ridgwell and Zachos 2016). Alongside this visible and experiential
intensification of anthropogenic climate‐changing actions however there
is also a secondary group of underlying, invisible geophysical processes
developing which has the potential to intensify planetary changes, of
which a selection is presented below:

Changes in the conventional sea level budget (SLB) of the oceans due to
ice‐melt‐induced ocean volume expansion increased to a point around 2000
where it dominated steric processes (Vishwakarma et al. 2020; Steric sea
level = variation of the ocean volume due to density changes). Whilst
ice‐melt has substantially increased oceanic volumes, resultant sea‐
level rises have been complicated by sea‐bed deformation, particularly
processes acting to deepen sea‐beds (Frederikse, Riva, and King 2017);
ocean beds are currently deforming and sinking under pressure, but only
enough to change sea‐level rises, not halt them

Human‐induced contributions to changes in ocean mass are increasingly
affecting natural ones. Since these processes have begun to be observed,
geophysical analysis has moved from more simplistic models based more
directly on sea‐level rises to relatively more sophisticated ones
incorporating sea‐bed deformation as well---it remains to be seen what
the melting of Antarctic ice sheets might contribute to this process,
alongside existing Arctic and glacial ice‐melt.

Although any tectonic effects of changes in oceans and the quantities of
water transmitted by subduction remain unknown at present, research into
the effects of water on tectonic processes already shows that 'water is
a key ingredient in the generation of magmas in subduction zones (Grove,
Till, and Krawczynski 2012)', oceanic water transported downwards in
subduction zones. At the same time, meltdown water pouring into oceans
from polar ice melt has deformed the sea‐bed, particularly in volatile
areas such as subduction zones, and could potentially affect the water
being subducted.

Substantial ice‐melt since the mid‐1990s has also contributed to the
polar drift of the planet: 'The faster ice melting under global warming
was the most likely cause of the directional change of the polar drift
in the 1990s' (Deng et al. 2021: 9). As well as polar drift, the
planetary spin shifts transmitted by climate change effects crustal
formation globally. There are therefore other means by which climate
change may be affecting the physical surface behaviours of the planet,
for instance the rotation variability of Earth:

\[QUOTE OMITTED\]

Other recent research into volcanism and the Earth\'s rotation has also
tended to support the proposal of interconnections between climate
change and volcanism, as the recent eruptions from Mount Etna show:
'Seismic activity and bursts of magma near Italy\'s Mount Etna increased
when Earth\'s rotational axis was furthest from its geographic axis,
according to a new study comparing changes in Earth\'s rotation to
activity at the well‐ known Italian volcano'.2

Further linkages between climate change and global geophysical activity
are also being analysed at the moment---the linkage between decreased
glacial activity and increased volcanism, for instance.3 Recent work
also indicates the underreporting that all volcanic activity has
received in inducing a globally complex set of effects, impacting
'probabilistic projections of global radiation, sea level, ocean
circulation, and sea‐ice variability' (Bethke et al. 2017).

Indications of large‐scale volcanic activity in the past have been
affected by geographical distance and the lack of technology,
particularly prior to 1980--1990; nonetheless, apparent increases in
volcanic activity in the new millennium are attracting attention. Recent
discussions on these increases globally also attract a degree of
contradiction---many official volcanological institutes and
organisations claim that alleged observations of increase activity
globally result from demographic, observational and technological
improvements:

\[QUOTE OMITTED\]

Nonetheless, official figures show a distinct increase in volcanic
activity over time since 1800, particularly since 1950. Researchers
working in Alaska, for instance, are convinced that the substantial
deglaciation that has happened there is responsible for increases in
volcanic activity over the last decade or so (Masih 2018). What appear
as increases in volcanic activity around the Pacific Fire Rim since
about 2000, an area with extreme vulnerability to changes in subduction
processes, have also created a debate about whether the new activity is
just part of the Rim behaving in its normal, fluctuating fashion, picked
up by new technologies, or whether the new volcanic activity is
something more.

Empirical studies show that a warming climate can result in increases in
volcanic activity due to isostatic adjustment (Pagli and Sigmundsson
2008) and that volcanic eruptions in the tropics are more likely to have
a global effect than those occurring in hemispheres (Oman et al. 2006).
Various geophysical changes have also taken place in different but
related planetary geophysical subsets, occurring at the same time as
these alleged increases in volcanicity---ocean bed deformation, ice
disappearance at the poles, increased ocean volatility through the
addition of ice‐melt water and earth spin deformation.

It is therefore a possibility that increased volcanic activity is being
driven by another, as yet unobserved combination of imbricated push‐pull
factors operating through the gravitic effects of changed planetary spin
on the 'crustal deformation rate and mass redistribution on the plate
tectonic scale'. (Sottili et al. 2015: 208). These driving mechanisms
have the capacity to interact with other complexities of global warming
such as the increased rate of spin of the planet under warming, plus the
rate of seismic/volcanic activity

The possibilities describe above, that climate change may already affect
volcanic behaviours through changes based on global responses to
ice‐melt and the increase of substantial quantities of oceanic wateras
been noted in previous literature that more specifically concerns
seismicity (McGuire 2010a). Seismicity is affected by rises and fallsin
sea‐levels;seismicity in the Pacific (for instance)is affected by rises
and declinesin the sea‐level during El Niño events (Guillas, Day, and
McGuire 2010).

As other specific examples of climate‐induced seismic changes, Heki
(2003) pointed out the seasonality of snowfall as a factor in affecting
seismicity in Japan, and Liu, Linde, and Sacks. (2009) revealed that
earthquakes in Taiwan are can be affected by atmospheric pressure
changes related to tropical cyclones. It is vital to understand the role
of these small but apparently irrelevant changes ‐ As McGuire (2010b)
put it: 'variations in the atmosphere and hydrosphere can drive very
small changes in environmental conditions that are able, in turn, to
trigger a response from the Earth\'s crust.'

Nonetheless, official bodies such as the USGS insist that 'a temporary
increase or decrease in seismicity is part of the normal fluctuation of
earthquake rates' and therefore not necessarily indicative of any
substantial change or the possibility of a forthcoming large earthquake4
: 'The ComCat earthquake catalogue contains an increasing number of
earthquakes in recent years---not because there are more earthquakes,
but because there are more seismic instruments and they are able to
record more earthquakes'---the USGS chart of the 20 largest earthquakes
in the world puts 7 of them after 2000 and 14 since 1950.

It is also the case that in the 15 years 2004--2019 'subduction zones
hosted a particularly high number of tsunamigenic earthquakes' (Romano
et al. 2020: 1) and according to researchers this flux is not
necessarily inconsistent with normal statistical fluctuations in
seismicity (Lay 2015). Other writers are more insistent on the effects
of climate change affecting seismicity:

\[QUOTE OMITTED\]

As with the recent increased frequency of volcanoes, the effects of
human activities on earthquakes are also an open debate---an in‐depth
review of the effects of openly anthropogenic activities can be found in
Foulger et al. \'s (2018) Global Review of Human‐induced Earthquakes.
Since the effects of earthquakes in terms of increasing the earth\'s
spin and exacting a particular pull re the polar axis are reasonably
known however, it can be assumed that increased planetary spin and the
effects of climate‐ induced polar drift have some effect on the current
regime of (allegedly) increasing earthquakes.

The core of eschatological geographies focuses on the 'flexible,
migratory, and unstable' (McQueen 2017, 22) nature of imminent critical
climatic events created by the dualist dispositif of consumerism and
overproduction on the one hand and the resultant geophysical impacts on
the other. These impacts are going to substantially affect critical
events of the Anthropocene; whether they will constitute an end to the
'modernist imaginary of progress and of the centrality of the human as
somehow above and separate from nature' (Chandler 2019, 656) remains to
be seen, but the possibility that they might requires urgent analysis.

Writing on climate change assesses multiple, imbricated dynamics derived
from technologized over‐production and over‐ consumption. Zizek (2010:
x) points out the ecological crisis, the biogenetic revolution, systemic
imbalances of capitalism and the growth of social diversions and
exclusions. It is nonetheless the growing biopolitical impact of
corporate technological innovation and military technology that must
concern geographers---the US military (for instance) is the 47th largest
emitter of greenhouse gases in the world, a bigger polluter than 100
countries combined5 . Current official concerns with new climate
mitigation technologies and funds committed for mitigation effectively
invisibilize the vast, complex intermingling of consumption‐promoting
and military‐based actor‐networks.

Foucault\'s 'state existing in an indefinite historicity' (Hamilton
2018: 356) has moved from the nation‐state to a corporatized form of
biopolitics and it is the increasing dominance of multi‐ and
trans‐national corporations over the remnant nation‐state that enhances
climate‐change. The Foucaultian emphasis on the State being a practice
not a thing invites inspection into increasing corporate dominance
through supranational legal agreement, the interaction and subordination
of national governmentality constituting an 'intrication of men and
things' (Foucault 2007, 97).

[It has also to be recognised that corporate [responses to]{.mark}
[climate change]{.mark} have so far been [rooted in]{.mark} **fierce
[denial]{.mark}** and (at the time of writing) depend on a mixture of
simulacra of environmental awareness, '**[greenwash']{.mark},
[indicating]{.mark} immediate [technological and financial
responses]{.mark}**, and **continued [funding]{.mark} of climate change
[denialist propaganda.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Assessing the level of corporatocracy and how to change the
determinations on climate change has therefore become essential---'For
the private sector, there is concern that the power exercised by
transnational corporations generates, and is even central to, global
environmental change (Folke et al. 2019).' Vitali, Glattfelder, and
Battiston. (2011) chose to analyse the concentration in power through
mapping TNCs, their connectivity and the power of those networks.

The researchers identified 43,060 TNCs identified by OECD definition and
made a map of ownership pathways between TNCs which indicated total or
partial control; these ownership pathways were correlated with control
through the measurement of operating revenues. The researchers
identified a core of 737 top holders controlling 80% of the value of all
TNCs and a further super‐core of 147 TNCs holding 4/10ths of the total
value of TNCs globally---75% of the total of these TNCs were financial
services intermediaries: (See Figure 1).

In the 10 years since this research was done, the global number of
financial services intermediaries has continued to shrink through
agglomeration, take‐over and subsidiarization and the connections
between these financial services intermediaries and corporations
producing all kinds of consumer goods have intensified---the global
economy is becoming more integrated (Sigler et al. 2021). Needless to
say, the anthropogeophysical pathways indicated in the previous section
are intimately connected to the excessive over‐production fomented by
these corporate actor‐networks.

The climate dynamics precipitated by the Carbon Trilemma appear
overwhelming: 'the present anthropogenic carbon release rate is
unprecedented during the past 66 million years. We suggest that such a
"no‐analogue" state represents a fundamental challenge in constraining
future climate projections'. (Zeebe et al. 2016). Nonetheless,
officially‐permitted treatment of climate change remains as a form of
hopeless 'katechontic management'---trying to keep 'global environmental
change at a tolerable level and thereby indefinitely postponing the
fatal outcome' (Rothe 2020).

### Impact---Underdevelopment---2NC

#### Capitalism drives [existential underdevelopment]{.underline}.

[Underdevelopment as a **catastrophic risk**]{.underline}

Development studies [scholars have **long** recognised underdevelopment
as a **structural** challenge]{.underline}. Walter Rodney provided a
seminal definition, emphasising how [politics and imperialism
**systematically undermined** socioeconomic progress]{.underline}. He
argued that [underdevelopment is not merely a lack of **economic
growth** but a product of **exploitation** and **entrenched global
inequalities**]{.underline}:

A second [an]{.underline}d even more [**indispensable** component
of]{.underline} modern [underdevelopment is that it expresses
a]{.underline} particular [relationship of
**exploitation**]{.underline}: namely, the exploitation of one country
by another. All of the countries named as "underdeveloped" in the world
are exploited by others; and [the underdevelopment with which the world
is now preoccupied is a product of **capitalist**]{.underline},
imperialist, and colonialist **[exploitation]{.underline}**. [African
and Asian societies were developing **independently** until they were
taken over directly or indirectly by the **capitalist
powers**]{.underline}. [When that happened]{.underline}, [exploitation
increased and the export of surplus ensued]{.underline}, [depriving the
societies of the benefit of their natural resources and
labor]{.underline}. That is an integral part of underdevelopment in the
contemporary sense. (Rodney Citation1981, 14)

Building on Rodney and the Founex Report, we argue that
[underdevelopment represents a catastrophic risk that perpetuates
poverty and worsens ecological vulnerability]{.underline}. [As climate
impacts intensify and global political dynamics hinder effective
responses]{.underline}, [underdevelopment acts as a risk
multiplier]{.underline}. [The countries most vulnerable to climate
change]{.underline} -- despite contributing the least -- [face
disproportionate impacts and systemic disadvantages]{.underline} within
global governance structures, [which often generate unintended
socio-economic burdens]{.underline} (Makomere and Mbeva Citation2018;
Mbeva et al. Citation2023; Okereke Citation2024).

Reframing [underdevelopment as a catastrophic risk links]{.underline}
development studies [to]{.underline} existential risk studies (ERS), the
latter which focuses on [extreme threats capable of causing societal
collapse or human extinction]{.underline} (Beard, Rees, and Richards
Citation2023; Beard and Hobson Citation2024; Bostrom and Cirkovic
Citation2011; Kemp et al. Citation2022; Ord Citation2020). The worsening
climate crisis -- both driven by and exacerbating underdevelopment
(Kotz, Levermann, and Wenz Citation2024; Okereke Citation2024) --
underscores the enduring relevance of the Founex Report.

### Impact---War---2NC

[[The]{.mark} idea that the globalized [free market]{.mark} constitutes
a device for world order and pacification [has been
**radically**]{.mark} **challenged** by the new and [increasingly grim
war]{.mark} [scenarios of global significance]{.mark}, notably the wars
in Ukraine and Palestine]{.underline} (Overbeek 2024; Todd 2024). The
irenicism associated with the so-called 'end of history' ushered in by
the collapse of the Berlin Wall has, therefore, inexorably lost
credibility. Even in the immediate aftermath of the Cold War, this ideal
faced continual threats as numerous conflicts erupted worldwide, as wars
in Yugoslavia. The U.S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq in the early
2000s intensified doubts despite neoconservative factions in the
American deep state framing these actions within a 'just war' rhetoric,
attempting to align them with the post-Cold War ideal of 1989 (Harvey
2003). Again, non-war but no less critical events, including the global
financial crisis of 2007--2008, the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the
crisis of Western democracies, and the environmental crisis, have
undoubtedly constituted further tests of the idea that the world market
is capable of ordering and pacifying the entire globe (Brown, 2015;
Calloni, 2023; Crouch, 2011; Mann and Wainwright, 2018; Tooze, 2021).
That this position was nothing less than an ideological cover for global
power asymmetries, or at least a pious illusion is, moreover, what has
been argued by anyone who has based their analysis on the theoretical
framework of political Realism or Marxism, [[whereby the
polemical]{.mark} element, now geopolitical, now class-based,
[constitutes the **true foundation of the global free
market**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Battistini et al., 2022), as well as
supranational institutions aimed at protecting human rights
(Scuccimarra, 2016, 236-242). While the former perspective now has a
hegemonic position within the international theoretical-political
debate, the latter is beginning to be rediscovered and discussed, albeit
minimally, within it. In this context, however, the theoretical
framework underpinning the assumed equation between free markets, order,
and peace has garnered less attention, likely because it appears
inadequate in explaining current events. This contribution takes a
different approach, proposing that isolating and analyzing the core
concepts of the theoretical framework advocating for the global market
may shed light on today's discussions around its crisis. Specifically,
the article examines Austrian marginalism, tracing its origins, major
developments and the impacts it has generated, finally asking under what
conditions it can be said to have failed today.

[[The relationship between the **liberal market and war**]{.mark} became
an explicit and systematic subject of discussion in the field of
Austrian marginalism in the early 20th century, notably in the
Privatseminar given by Eugen Böhm-Bawerk between 1905 and
1914.]{.underline} Three times minister of finance in the
Austro-Hungarian Empire, Böhm-Bawerk had been a student of Carl Menger,
who was considered the one who founded marginalist economics in Austria
in the second half of the 19th century. The latter does not constitute a
rigid doctrinal orthodoxy, but rather a set of theories elaborated
differentially by its various interpreters. Among these, the subjective
theory of value and the theory of cultural evolution are of radical
importance. According to the former, in a nutshell, the value of a
commodity is not an objective quantity that depends on the amount of
labor required to produce it, as according to classical labor-value
theory; rather, it is a subjective quantity determined from time to time
by the encounter between the different subjective valuations that
economic actors (eminently individuals, according to the assumption of
methodological individualism) attribute to it within the market,
expressed in terms of supply and demand. In other words, the value of a
commodity is its price, an emergent measure of the equilibrium that is
spontaneously produced in the market. Therefore, state intervention in
the economic field must be minimal so that it interferes as little as
possible in the dynamics of price formation, which allows the economic
calculation from which a rational economic order follows (Bonar 1888;
Roncaglia 2017). On the other hand, the theory of cultural evolution
prescribes the unreflective origin of the institutions that organize
human life, understood as undesigned artifices selected by cultural
evolution over time to coordinate the actions of individuals. Central to
the marginalist view is the belief that the liberal market constitutes
the most rational institution selected by cultural evolution since it
enables human cooperation without it being directed by the arbitrariness
of any centralized authority because it is made possible by the
impersonal and decentralized forces of the free market (Angner 2002).

Based on these arguments, the theorists of marginalism believe that any
form of economic dirigisme is potentially disruptive and identify
Marxism as one of their main polemical targets, deeming it not only an
undesirable political program but, above all, an entirely wrong
scientific framework. While Menger does not deal extensively with the
critique of Marxism, Böhm-Bawer devotes an entire volume to it published
in 1896, in which he refutes Karl Marx's Capital precisely since
marginalist principles (Böhm-Bawerk 2023). The polemic with Marxism does
not, at any rate, end in the pages of his work Karl Marx and the Close
of His System: A Criticism, but rather animates the discussions he
directed within his Privatseminar between liberal marginalists and
Marxists themselves: a situation that is perhaps only plausible if
contextualized within the very high-level cultural and scientific debate
active in early 20-century Vienna, the same one that Robert Musil
recorded, and ultimately aestheticized, in the following words, 'Kakania
was perhaps a home for genius after all. And that, probably, was the
ruin of it' (Musil 1965). Suspending judgment on the catastrophic
effects of genius, it seems complicated to deny at least the first
utterance, taking into consideration precisely the Privatseminar
discussions on the relationship between the free market and war, in
which key figures of world political and economic thought, including
Rudolf Hilferding, Ludwig von Mises, Joseph Schumpeter, Felix Somary,
Emil Lederer, Otto Neurath, Otto Bauer, Ewald, Karl Pribram, Richard
Strigl and Nikolai Bukharin, take part (Wassermann 2019).

[In Privatseminar, Hilferding defends the thesis set forth in his
monumental work Finance Capital (1910) in which he argues that [the
financialization of capital has]{.mark} as [its effect that of its
**concentration**]{.mark} **and consequent exportation** [by means of
**expansionist policies** carried out]{.mark} through **[imperialist
wars,]{.mark}** which are therefore [an effect of an economic
law.]{.mark}]{.underline} Underlying this law, there is, according to
Hilferding, the change in the organic composition of capital due to the
Second Industrial Revolution, which drives capitalists to invest in
technologies to maximize production, to the point where only a few
economic giants can sustain them, while all others must resort to
injections of financial liquidity. [From this follows an [enormous
growth in]{.mark} the importance of [the financial sector,]{.mark} in
which the same process of concentration takes place, until the latter
becomes stronger than the productive sector and, within it, competition
between financial trusts is generated, [the outcome of]{.mark} which is
[imperialism]{.mark}, that is, in the search for, [and **subsequent
military construction** of, new spaces from which to **extract
profit**]{.mark} (Hilferding, 2007).]{.underline} This is a fundamental
theory of Marxist thought, taken up and reworked (also with important
differences) by Rosa Luxemburg in The Accumulation of Capital (1913), by
Lenin in Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism (1917), as well as
by Nikolai Bukharin, who has a way of defending it not only in the work
Imperliasm and World Economy (1915) but also in Privatseminar itself.

Joseph Schumpeter and Ludwig von Mises acknowledge that monopolistic
concentration in both production and finance is a real tendency within
contemporary capitalist systems. However, they attribute this primarily
to external, non-economic factors rather than inherent tendencies within
capitalism. [For instance**[, interventionist policies]{.mark}** that
[distort competition]{.mark}, such as protectionism, often **[encourage
the formation of monopolies and]{.mark} [cartels within individual
states.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[These]{.mark} internal monopolistic
s[tructures]{.mark}, in turn, can [**lead to interstate tensions**
and]{.mark}, ultimately, to **[the outbreak of
wars]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Based on his sociological theory of
classes, elaborated in two texts, published in 1917 and 1927,
respectively, Schumpeter asserts in this perspective that war is nothing
but an atavism carried on by the imperialistic-feudal aristocratic
classes, who intend to preserve their privileges and wealth, at that
chronological height undermined by the bourgeois-entrepreneurial
classes, who have no interest in war conflict, since the condition for
their activity is the international order; they, therefore, are vehicles
of pacifism (Schumpeter 1966).

\[cf\]

Today the situation is qualitatively different. For two principal
reasons. First, the objective of the feasible [[war at the
present]{.mark} phase of historical development]{.underline}, in
accordance with the objective requirements of imperialism -- [[world
domination by capital's most powerful state,]{.mark} in tune with its
own political design of ruthless authoritarian
["globalization"]{.mark}]{.underline}(dressed up as "free exchange" in a
U.S.-ruled global market) -- [[is]{.mark} **ultimately
[unwinnable]{.mark}**, foreshadowing,]{.underline} instead, **[[the
destruction of humankind]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This objective by no
stretch of imagination could be considered a rational objective in
accord with the stipulated rational requirement of the "continuation of
politics by other means" conducted by one nation, or by one group of
nations against another. [[Aggressively imposing]{.mark} the will of
[one]{.mark} powerful [national state]{.mark} over all of the others,
even if for cynical tactical reasons the advocated war [is absurdly
**camouflaged**]{.mark} as a "purely limited war" [leading to other
"**open ended limited wars**]{.mark}",]{.underline} can therefore be
qualified only as total irrationality. The second reason greatly
reinforces the first. For [[the weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} already
[[available]{.mark} for waging the]{.underline} war or [wars of the
twenty first century [are capable of **exterminating**]{.mark} not only
the adversary but **[the whole of humanity]{.mark}**,]{.underline} the
first time ever in history. [Nor should we have **the illusion** that
the [**existing weaponry** marks the]{.mark} very **[end of the
road]{.mark}**. Others, even more [**instantly lethal** ones, might
appear **tomorrow** ]{.mark}**or the day after tomorrow**.]{.underline}
Moreover, [[threatening]{.mark} the use [of]{.mark} [such weapons
is]{.mark} by now [considered]{.mark} an [acceptable]{.mark} state
strategic device.]{.underline} Thus, put reasons one and two together,
and [[the]{.mark} [conclusion is **inescapable**: envisaging war as the
mechanism]{.mark} of global government in today's world
[underlines]{.mark} that we find ourselves at [the]{.mark} precipice of
[**absolute irrationality** from which there can be **no**
return]{.mark} if we accept the ongoing course of
development.]{.underline} What was missing from von Clausewitz's classic
definition of war as the "continuation of politics by other means" was
the investigation of the deeper underlying causes of war and the
possibility of their avoidance. The challenge to face up to such causes
is more urgent today than ever before. For the war of the twenty first
century looming ahead of us is not only "not winnable in principle".
Worse than that, it is in principle unwinnable. Consequently,
[[envisaging the pursuit of war]{.mark}, as the American
administration's]{.underline} September 17, 2002 strategic document
[does, **[make Hitler's irrationality look]{.mark} like the model of
[rational]{.mark}ity**.]{.underline}

these ventures impact Indigenous populations but to prioritize
decolonization in these spaces.

framework to analyze resource development with a focus on the United
States (US), which is considered an Arctic state by way of Alaska.
Decolonization will be defined as a concept and practice of confronting
and reversing the historic and ongoing legacies of colonialism,6)
including the structures of power that uphold inequalities.

After a brief background covering land ownership and some of the
outcomes of resource development in Alaska, this article will delve into
dynamics that reproduce and perpetuate colonial structures of power.
This analysis will feature (i) the prioritization of state and federal
interests through the idea of sovereignty and (ii) the primacy and
assumed superiority of Western knowledge and conventions and,
conversely, the disregard for Indigenous knowledge systems and
worldviews. To bridge the gap between theory and action, the article
will continually ask what it would mean to decolonize resource
development in the US Arctic. Confronting the ongoing systems and
dynamics of colonialism must be placed at the forefront of present-day
and future Arctic engagement and collaboration---not only in the US, but
throughout the region.

Background

[The United States purchased the land that is present-day Alaska from
Russia in 1867]{.underline}. [Just over a century later, in 1968, the
discovery of oil in Prudhoe Bay made the Arctic relevant at a national
scale]{.underline}.7) The commercial export of oil to the lower 48
states was now possible for the first time. [Hindering this ambition,
however, was the fact that the planned pipeline to carry the oil south
traversed lands claimed by Alaska Native populations. 'Alaska Native'
refers collectively to the Indigenous populations who have lived in
present-day Alaska for thousands of years before the arrival of
Europeans in the 1700s]{.underline}.8) This term encompasses "many
nations and tribes" and "widely diverse cultures, languages, lifeways,
art forms and histories".9) [To enable the construction of the pipeline
to the contiguous United States, land claims issues around Prudhoe Bay
were settled with the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) in
1971]{.underline}. [ANCSA extinguished Indigenous claims to nearly 400
million acres of land throughout the state in exchange for \$962.5
million and ownership of 43.7 million acres]{.underline}.

ANCSA also divided the state into twelve regions, each with an Alaska
Native Regional Corporation. The regional boundaries of the corporations
do not, however, equate to land ownership; [land in Alaska is
predominantly owned by the state and federal governments]{.underline}.
Just 10 percent of Alaska's 663,000 square miles are owned by Alaska
Native populations.10) [The Regional Corporations operate under US
corporate law to administer resources and serve the local communities.
These for-profit corporations participate in the Alaskan natural
resource industry, both directly and indirectly.]{.underline}

[[Federal Arctic policy in the US]{.mark} has tended to [emphasize the
exploitation of Arctic resources for]{.mark} US [econ]{.mark}omic
[development]{.mark}]{.underline}.11) [[Within]{.mark} [the new]{.mark}
[National Strategy for the Arctic Region]{.mark}]{.underline} (released
October 2022), [[economic development continues to receive]{.mark} a
**[strong emphasis]{.mark}**]{.underline}---alongside security---and
Arctic investments are expected to increase over the following
decade.12) In the face of this ever-growing interest in Arctic
engagement, Alaska Native communities may face new and renewed colonial
intrusion in the form of large-scale resource development.13)

Effects of resource development

[[Continual '**boom and bust'**]{.mark} [with periods of financial
growth and decline characterizes]{.mark} [resource development]{.mark}
in the capitalist system]{.underline}.14) [This [instability
prohibits]{.mark} many [communities from relying solely on economies
centered on resource extraction]{.mark}. Subsistence practices provide a
source of greater stability within what would otherwise be an unstable
extractive economy.15)]{.underline} [[Resource extraction]{.mark}
[has]{.mark}, however, had [detrimental impacts]{.mark} on the land,
water, and wildlife [that **reduce the viability of subsistence
lifeways**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Specifically, extractive activities
have been found to **increase vulnerability to biological
invasion**]{.underline},16) [bring changes to the land with built
infrastructure]{.underline},17) [and introduce the risk of
contamination, such as oil spills]{.underline}.18) [The resulting
decreased viability of subsistence practices is worsened by the threat

activities.19)]{.underline}

**Kröger,** **21** -- Professor in Global Development Studies at the
University of Helsinki. (Markus Kröger. "ARCTIC RESOURCE EXTRACTION IN
THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE CRISES AND ECOLOGICAL COLLAPSES," University of
Auckland, pg. 225-226. Accessed: 7-14-2025)//ilake-mc

Global temperature rises have led to a rapid increase in permafrost
temperatures around the world, and this has caused fast-expanding
permafrost thawing especially in the Northern Hemisphere (Biskaborn et
al. 2019). The degradation of the permafrost system has been dramatic
between the 1970s and 2018 for example in the Western Russian Arctic
(Vasiliev et al. 2020). [This thawing of the permafrost has already
passed a tipping point and will continue for hundreds of
years]{.underline} even if the emission of greenhouse gases by humans
were immediately halted (Randers & Goluke 2020). [The [methane]{.mark}
[and other g]{.mark}reen[h]{.mark}ouse [g]{.mark}ase[s]{.mark} that [the
Arctic]{.mark} thawing is now [releasing]{.mark} [will]{.mark} further
[accelerate]{.mark} this process]{.underline}, [[making **developments
in the near decades unstable**]{.mark} for an assumed continuation of
extraction]{.underline}. Scientists have warned that [this process will
be further increased as there are very few signs of decreasing
emissions]{.underline}; instead the focus has shifted toward net-zero
targets in the distant future and dubious offsetting schemes and other
false solutions to address the climate crisis (e.g.
https://www.climatechangenews.com/2020/12/11/10-myths-net-zero-targets-carbon-
offsetting-busted/). The [potential of carbon that will be emitted from
permafrost thawing is massive, estimates running from 260 to 360 billion
tonnes of carbon]{.underline}, a considerable part of which will thaw
abruptly and not gradually, these abrupt emissions greatly increasing
the release projections (Merritt et al. 2019). Just a tiny fraction of
this emission potential would have catastrophic impacts (Smith 2011).
There are a few studies which have started to incorporate the
aforementioned situation into their prognoses, although the vast
majority, based on my review, suggests that most analyses are oblivious
to these facts, or ignore them. Hjort et al. (2018) claims to be the
first study detailing the fundamental infrastructure which is at risk
across the Northern Hemisphere permafrost area due to climate changes.
They argue that [by 2050, about 69% of the pan-Arctic infrastructure
that is essential to human life in these conditions, including housing,
transport, and industry facilities, will be in areas of high potential
for permafrost thaw near the surface]{.underline}. They also note that
even if the Paris Agreement target is reached, most Arctic
infrastructures would be at risk. This includes such central extractive
infra structures as the 1,590-kilometer Eastern Siberia--Pacific Ocean
oil pipeline, 1,260 kilo meters of gas pipelines originating in the
Yamal-Nenets region, and 550 kilometers of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline
System (Hjort et al. 2018). This suggests that especially hydrocarbon
extraction will become extremely difficult, too costly, or
socio-environmentally hazardous, 225 Markus Kröger as the constant
thawing will require re-building the pipelines. [[As the costs
of]{.mark} merely [trying to upkeep]{.mark} the [existing industrial
structures]{.mark}, [buildings]{.mark} and [essential logistics]{.mark}
of extraction [are **extremely**]{.mark} **[high]{.mark}**, [there will
be fewer funds for expansion projects]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example,
Streletskiy et al. (2019) estimate that by 2050, Russia [[will need to
spend **over 100 billion**]{.mark} USD [to sustain]{.mark} its [existing
infrastructures]{.mark} that will be [damaged by
thawing]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Producing cheap commodities that rely on
massive infrastructures, such as hydrocarbons, is thus likely to be
hard, even impossible. Moreover, the situation will become even worse
due to the currently rapidly decreasing funding given to hydrocarbon
expansion projects, and the massive and rising costs, and lowering
returns]{.underline}, [that the pumping of oil and gas in the Arctic
would produce]{.underline}. Similarly, slurry pipelines for pumping
minerals with water are likely to be unfeasible in the Arctic. [A more
likely, and less costly, outcome in the worst thawing regions is for the
people now living in extractive towns' old buildings which are
collapsing to be moved to other regions]{.underline}, [where upkeeping
infrastructure will be less costly]{.underline}, [and where the rapidly
cascading effects and risks of thawing are less likely]{.underline}.
This suggests that very large areas of Siberia and North America would
become more akin to wasteland than usable targets for land grab bing, as
investing would be far too risky and short-lived. These barriers set by
climatic catastrophes are not limited to land, but also affect the seas.
Coastal and offshore operations will suffer from increasing storms and
drifting ice, which already make the situation so perilous that, along
with other factors such as the unavailability of funds, or close enough
ports, make other Arctic seas except the Norwegian-controlled Barents
Sea highly unlikely, even impossible sites of expanding drilling
(Eliasson 2017). The [[melting]{.mark} perennial and multi-year Arctic
[ice]{.mark} will not only **[raise sea levels]{.mark}**, but will [lead
to]{.mark} **[extinctions of microorganisms]{.mark}** dependent on ice.
This will lead to [dramatic **existential problems**]{.mark} for Arctic
life]{.underline}, [including the many fishing and hunting dependent
populations]{.underline} (Dodds & Nuttall 2019). These prognoses make it
clear that [not only will forecast expansions into permafrost and ice
cover areas be much more difficult than expected, even impossible, but
that the existing [logistics and extraction operations]{.mark} relying
on steady ground are also likely to be [damaged]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[Those who have invested in Arctic extraction and exploitation
permits]{.underline}, [leased land and extraction rights]{.underline},
[or have already invested in infrastructures and
operations]{.underline}, [are going to face **rising and unexpected
risks**]{.underline}. As Francis (2018: 17) notes in her Scientific
American climate change special issue article, which showcases how the
[[Arctic is changing]{.mark} much faster than predicted, coming closer
to tipping points with feedback loops, [it is time to "**prepare for the
unexpected**]{.mark}]{.underline}."

On the other hand, the GlobalArctic is really the result of global
warming and of Earth System dynamics more generally. Of course, there
was the colonization of the Arctic by the Southern powers, mainly for
reasons of minerals extraction in Alaska, Norway, Sweden and Russia. But
this did not make the Arctic global. We now know that global warming is
affecting the Arctic disproportionately more severely than any other
geographical part of the world. Also[, [global warming is the result
of]{.mark} the fossil fuel-based economy in the industrialized countries
and of the "**[Great Acceleration]{.mark}**"]{.underline} [of industrial
development [since]{.mark} the [1960s]{.mark}]{.underline}, [especially
in the emerging economies]{.underline} (Thomas et al., 2020). [[As a
**result**]{.mark} **of global warming**, the [Arctic's mineral and
energy resources have become **increasingly accessible**]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} exploration and [exploitation]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Furthermore, [[this]{.mark} process is [facilitated because of]{.mark}
more accessible maritime and land [transport routes]{.mark} in the
Arctic]{.underline}. On the maritime transport side, [this increased
accessibility of Arctic resources is facilitated because shipping
through Arctic waters leads to significant competitive trade
advantages]{.underline}. However, [the exploitation of Arctic minerals
and energy resources would not have taken place without the planet's
**[hunger for]{.mark} these very [resources]{.mark}**]{.underline};
[that is, because of the **pressure from the industrialized and emerging
economies**]{.underline}. The population in the Arctic and not even the
Arctic countries would not need to exploit all these resources. [What
happens in the Arctic]{.underline}, at least [in economic
terms,]{.underline} [is]{.underline} mostly [[the result of a
"**resource curse**]{.mark}",]{.underline} a development that is
[[similar to]{.underline}]{.mark} what happens in other resources-rich
countries in the world, such as [[Saudi]{.underline}
[Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [[Congo]{.underline}]{.mark},
[etc]{.underline}. (Murshed, 2018). In this sense, the GlobalArctic
simply means some form of "[resource colonization]{.underline}", albeit
[[on a]{.mark} much more **[massive scale]{.mark}** than in the early
twentieth century]{.underline}. Because of this massive scale, the
[[exploitation]{.mark} of the Arctic's resources is [accompanied by
equally massive]{.mark} [infrastructure developments]{.mark} in the form
of roads, ports, railways, airports, and entire cities]{.underline}
(such as mining towns and drilling platforms). Such infrastructure
developments add still other dimensions to the GlobalArctic: not only
does it make the transformation of the Arctic much more permanent, it
also has cultural consequences, as the Arctic's indigenous peoples are
increasingly also becoming minorities; this is something that goes far
beyond simple colonization. In other words, the Arctic is now global.

**[Sustainability---Jevons Paradox---2NC]{.underline}**

**Efficiency gains and rising global demand only
[intensifies]{.underline} pressure to extract. Exploitation accelerates
alongside warming which [locks]{.underline} the system into a

Development requires, among other things, non-renewable resources,
notably energy (oil, gas, coal), as well as minerals.
[Corresponding]{.underline} [resources extraction and subsequent
consumption is closely correlated with GDP and population growth and
most other indicators that measure one aspect of Development or
another]{.underline}. Not surprisingly, then, "[[global resource
extraction grew]{.mark} more or less steadily over the past 25 years,
from 40 billion tons in 1980 [to 58]{.mark} [billion tons in]{.mark}
20[05]{.mark}, representing an aggregated growth rate of
45%]{.underline}",5 and "[[is set to double again]{.mark} between 2015
and 2030]{.underline}", paralleling the Great Acceleration. In other
words, [the [Great Acceleration]{.mark} basically [reflects accelerated
fossil fuel use]{.mark}]{.underline}. This can be extended to other non-
renewable resources such as minerals, quality agricultural land, water,
fisheries, etc. [Over time, [there is significant tech]{.mark}nological
[potential for resources]{.mark} and [especially energy efficiency
gains]{.mark}]{.underline}. However, [for organizational reasons,
**[efficiency gains are never exhausted to the point that the entropy
law would allow]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Also, [[with]{.mark} population
[growth and]{.mark} the [Development]{.mark} [of]{.mark} the newly
[emerging economies]{.mark} and their raising middle-class, [there will
be **rebound effects**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Thus, over the past 25
years "the average resource extraction per capita remained almost
stable, today amounting for nearly nine tons".7 Even though this does
not really matter from an Earth Systems dynamics perspective, it is
worth mentioning that [resource extraction, resource consumption, and
resource efficiency gains are unevenly distributed among countries and
social groups. Therefore, there is potential for conflict and perhaps
even war around particularly essential resources]{.underline}.
[Considering that non-renewable resources are finite and that even
renewable resources have fixed regeneration rates, there will be
resources limitations to Development]{.underline} (Meadows et al.,
2004). In this regard, it is relevant to mention the concept of "peak
oil", but the same concept can be applied to every other non- renewable
resource. It is also not so important to precisely determine when peaks
will occur or have already occurred. The fact is that [all non-renewable
resources will eventually peak]{.underline}. In other words, [in light
of intensifying global demand, and even with current demand levels, the
[pressure for resources]{.mark}, especially some non renewable resources
will [only increase]{.mark}, **[making]{.mark} the [warming
Arctic]{.mark} [attractive for]{.mark} their [potential
extraction]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

**[Sustainability---Path Dependency---2NC]{.underline}**

**Capitalist systems are locked in a [harmful cycle]{.underline} where
sunk costs [compel]{.underline} continued resource extraction projects
in order to [recoup past expenditures]{.underline}.**

**Kröger,** **21** -- Professor in Global Development Studies at the
University of Helsinki. (Markus Kröger. "ARCTIC RESOURCE EXTRACTION IN
THE CONTEXT OF CLIMATE CRISES AND ECOLOGICAL COLLAPSES," University of
Auckland, pg. 226-228. Accessed: 7-14-2025)//ilake-mc

Despite the above and other scientific studies and local peoples'
complaints, which clearly point toward the necessity to take future and
already happening crises seriously, [governments interested in the
Arctic or situated there are mostly going in the **opposite direction**
in their policies]{.underline}. Newlin et al. (2021) note how extremely
ill-equipped current Russian regional governments are to respond to the
above challenges, due to lack of funds: they are already in heavy debt
and falling into bankruptcy. In this haphazard situation, [**[ecological
catastrophes]{.mark}** such as leakages from pipelines and factories
into rivers and elsewhere have [increased]{.mark}]{.underline}, [as
[environmental regulations]{.mark} and infrastructural investments are
**[overlooked]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The time of cheap commodities
seems to be thus already ending, as Moore (2015) has generally noted,
and as I can confirm from my studies about the Arctic and the case of
the Finnish 226 Arctic Resource Extraction in the Context of Climate
Crises mining boom, where costs of investing and operations have
exceeded the returns in the key expansion projects (Kröger 2016).
However, [governments across the Arctic still seem to push the Arctic
land and resource rush further]{.underline}. There are major Arctic pulp
investment, mining, tourism, and wind energy booms currently in Finland,
and some of these booms are also present in Norway, Sweden, Iceland and
Greenland. Instead of investing in alter natives, Russia is focusing
heavily on increasing its capacity of hydrocarbon power pro duction
(Newlin et al. 2021). The actual and political costs of these moves,
which tie the energy matrix for years to come to fossil fuels, will
increase. There also seem to be diverging resource grabbing trajectories
between the Arctic regions. The EU (2020) estimates that North America
will not engage in large-scale Arctic oil extraction as it has also less
costly and smaller-scale options. The EU (2020) Arctic Policy paper
suggests that it is much more likely that Norway and Russia will
continue their Arctic oil extraction expansion, due to sunk costs in
Norway, that being possibly the easiest option seen for GDP growth in
Russia by its current decision-makers. Staalesen (2020), assessing the
Russian energy and climate policies, shows how climate change is
recognized in Russia, but basically nothing has been done to prepare for
it: instead, expanding hydrocarbon extraction is framed as essential and
no alternatives are seen as viable. This has made many, including
Sukhankin (2020), who wonders about the Russian 2035 coal strategy
(which foresees major expansion), ask "Why does Russia ignore this
rapidly shifting reality?" This refers to Russia merely preparing to
adapt to some climate changes, but not combating them (Staalesen 2020).
Tynkkynen (2018) assesses the reasons for this. According to him, the
Russian state has a specific, hydrocarbon giant rhetoric directed toward
domestic audiences, which makes the negative effects of climate change
social ta boos. This rhetoric also exaggerates the economic potential of
Arctic industrialization and downplays the dependence on just
hydrocarbons. The practice of compensating Indigenous people for
pollution and loss of habitat in a way that merely seeks to stifle
criticism is another example of the balancing act by the Russian state
to keep the constructed hydro carbon identities alive, argues Tynkkynen.
The longer this hydrocarbon rhetoric continues, the more likely the
aforementioned predictions on the magnitude and timing of planetary
catastrophes due to climate disruptions will become. These kinds of
moves suggest that technological lock-ins are being built, based on
existing grabbing trajectories, such as in the Norwegian focus on
offshore drilling and the so-called blue economy of extracting
everything from the seabed that is possible. [The [propensity of]{.mark}
such [sunk costs]{.mark} [tend]{.mark}s [to be for invested-in projects
to be continued]{.mark}, [even if they would be]{.mark} highly
**[problematic]{.mark}**, **[unprofitable]{.mark}**, [or
**destructive**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[This is because]{.mark}
[**someone has already invested**]{.mark} in them [and]{.mark} wants --
or even [needs]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [**[to make money]{.mark}** to
pay debts, [or to **continue resource grabbing** in other
places]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Yet]{.mark}, at some point in the near
future, it is likely that [this situation of]{.mark} ever-[expanding
resource frontiers]{.mark} [for]{.mark} at least **[the past 550
years]{.mark}**, [will come to **loggerheads with**]{.mark} **the [harsh
realities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This is expected to happen faster in
the Arctic than elsewhere, as the temperature rises there are two to
three times higher than elsewhere, and the natural conditions are much
more fragile. Francis (2018: 52) calls [the Arctic the "canary in the
coal mine" for the whole earth]{.underline}. [While there are more
natural resources in the Arctic than in many other places, these are
**not available for extraction** in sensible terms]{.underline}. Besides
natural barriers, there are also particular international politics which
strongly impact the pace and style of extraction. Leroux and Spiro
(2018) note the crucial importance of inter-state competition: [if one
starts to extract, others can make use of the solutions and
technologies, and have the impetus to invest as well]{.underline}. The
Russian will to expand 227 Markus Kröger hydrocarbon extraction has been
greatly affected by Western sanctions, without which it has proven to be
impossible for Russian operators to expand oil operations in the Arctic,
as this would require extensive technological developments and Western
funds (Morgunova 2020). Nationalist agendas, such as Russia's 2007
planting of its flag by submarines on the ocean floor of the North Pole,
seem to have slowed down a joint capitalist rush to the Arctic.
[Inter-state rivalry between some Arctic nations, visible in the race
for who gets to first claim and grab sea areas has, curiously, been an
impediment to starting offshore and port-expanding projects in the same
manner as forecasted earlier]{.underline}. In this setting, imposing
greater environmental regulation has been interpreted by other would-be
Arctic extractive nations as a sign that a country would not be so
interested in expanding to the Arctic -- something that Leroux and Spiro
(2018) argue has deterred expansion thrusts. But national thrusts of
expansion remain. Besides Russia, Morgunova (2020) explains that the
will to expand into the Arctic, and citizen support for this, is high
also in Norway. This makes Norway the most likely candidate for being
the first nation to start Arctic extractive operations, as it has funds,
making what happens in Norway and its initial operations extremely
important for the whole region's future.

Why do we continue to use the term "sustainable development" when
referring to the Arctic? More precisely, [[why do we]{.mark} continue to
[believe]{.mark}]{.underline}, and make believe, [that the [sustainable
development of the Arctic is]{.mark}]{.underline} desirable, let alone
[[possible?]{.underline}]{.mark} [In order [to answer]{.mark} these
questions, [one must revert to]{.mark} the [psychoanalytical]{.mark}
[concept of]{.mark} "**[denial]{.mark}**".]{.underline} However, [such
denial is not just individual and collective]{.underline}; [it
is]{.underline} actually [cultural and even political]{.underline}: the
**[[prospect of sustainable]{.mark} [development]{.mark} [must be kept
alive]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [[especially]{.mark} in the Arctic [where
it is most **improbable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [One must revert to the
discipline of **ethno-psychanalysis** in order to explain why the term
"sustainable development" is being embraced]{.underline}.
[[Ethno-psychanalysis]{.mark} [looks at]{.mark} [the combined]{.mark}
**[psychanalytical]{.mark}**]{.underline} (and even psychiatric)
[[and]{.mark} **[anthropological dimensions]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} shared
[human belief]{.mark} systems [and]{.mark} corresponding [narratives to
explain]{.mark} institutions and ensuing social and economic
[behavior]{.mark}]{.underline} (Devereux, 1983). During the Cold War and
the corresponding threat of nuclear annihilation of humanity, authors
referred to ethno-psychanalysis in order to understand the lack of
reaction and fatalism of peoples and nation-states vis-à-vis such
threats (Richter, 2000). The continued quasi-religious belief in
Development, with science and technology at its core (Noble, 1999), is
of such ethno-psychoanalytical nature. Within this broad belief, I argue
[that the concept of a "sustainable development of the Arctic" serves at
least three functions]{.underline}, [which are as many reasons for the
exploitation of Arctic resources to continue and even to the
accelerate]{.underline}. • Firstly, the [exploitation of Arctic oil,
coal, gas, and minerals is needed to sustain Development on a global
scale]{.underline}. While the world may be able to do without Arctic oil
and coal, gas from the Arctic constitutes a significant share of global
produc tion today and has the potential to constitute an equally
important share in the future. Even if decarbonization should, at some
point in time, stabilize and hope fully even reduce the need for fossil
fuels to power Development, the exploitation of certain minerals from
the Arctic that will be necessary for the world's energy transition will
become even more urgently needed. [The exploitation of such resources
will be more acceptable if it is labeled "sustainable
development"]{.underline}, and especially will be more accepted by the
local peoples, which from the outset do not spontaneously and
necessarily see it that way. This is at least what governments and
investors hope for. However, such sustainable development will just be a
fig leaf for tradition, industrial development, which is why the concept
of "sustainable development" was invented by the UN system during the
1980s to begin with (Chatterjee and Finger, 1994). • Secondly, more
precisely, the [global investor community will need the label
"sustainable development" so it can profitably invest its
funds]{.underline}. For example, [the World Economic Forum's "global
agenda council" has developed an Arctic Investment
Protocol]{.underline}, [which "puts forward sustainability principles
similar to initiatives developed for mature economies in recent
years]{.underline}. The focus is long- term: tap the expertise of
indigenous communities and treat them as commercial partners, protect
eco-systems (even as rising temperatures change them before our eyes)
...".8 The two most valued types of such infrastructure projects in 2016
were energy (47 projects) and mining (119) projects. Interestingly, the
above- cited article features one of the major global investment funds,
Guggenheim, one of the financial pillars of the Arctic Circle
Conference, whose arguments are particularly cynical in this context:
"Guggenheim has long provided infrastructure finance, because it is an
area that can offer long-terms stable returns. That is partly why the
firm was drawn to the Arctic. ... The financial measure of opportunities
available there are difficult to estimate, but \$1 trillion may be a
solid first pass. That is the figure Guggenheim says may be needed to
get the Arctic up and running in a manner that won't deplete it in the
long run."9 It is unsurprising, then, that [the annual Arctic Circle
Conference has become the place where all stakeholders, especially
governments, investors, companies and indigenous peoples, gather to
celebrate their common belief in the sustainable development of the
Arctic]{.underline}. • Thirdly, investors will not just need the label
in order to justify the channeling of pension and other funds into
Arctic infrastructure projects. Companies will not just need to be seen
and perhaps even to be certified as being active contributors to the
Arctic's sustainable development. [The [world will]{.mark} also [need to
believe]{.mark} that energy [exploitation and mining]{.mark} in the
Arctic [equates to "sustainable development]{.mark} of the Arctic" and
that the sustainable development of the Arctic contributes to the
sustainable development at the planetary scale. This is]{.underline}
basically [because [the]{.mark} belief]{.underline}, [or [myth of
Development forever]{.mark} and for all [will have to be **maintained
at**]{.mark} **almost [any price]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[Nation-states]{.mark} will [need it]{.mark} in order [to remain
**legitimate in**]{.mark} **the [eyes of their
citizens]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [but also in order to [generate]{.mark}
the financially [resources to **sustain their
"lifestyle**]{.mark}**"**]{.underline}. [They will also need the myth in
order to **[avoid war with other nation-states]{.mark}**, [as
sustainable]{.mark} [Development has the ability to]{.mark} maintain the
[illusion of a win-win situation]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Investors]{.mark} will]{.underline} also need the myth, but even more
so they will [need the nation-states and the international economic
system to **[perpetuate this myth]{.mark}** in order [to justify]{.mark}
their behavior in front of the [people who entrust]{.mark} [them
with]{.mark} their [money]{.mark}]{.underline}. Firms will need the
myth, but even more so the nation-states to offer them the legal
framework conditions and often the active financial support to continue
to do business. Finally, for their sanity, [[people]{.mark} will [need
the myth]{.mark} of state-led and science- and technology-fueled
Development [for **ethno-psychoanalytical**]{.mark}
**[reasons]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Overall, [the **"sustainable
development of the Arctic" is just a myth**]{.underline}.
[[Believing]{.mark} in it [is **treacherous**]{.mark} [and
promoting]{.mark} it [is **hypocritical**]{.mark} and
**cynical**]{.underline}. What will it take for the myth of "sustainable
Arctic development" to become recognized precisely for what it is: a
myth, a scam, a fraud? In this sense, [the Arctic is not just a
"**laboratory of the Anthropocene**" from a bio-physical and Earth
System dynamics point of view]{.underline}. [It is also a laboratory
from an ethno-psychoanalytical point of view]{.underline}: what does it
take and especially when will the "Development emperor" be exposed as
being naked? This may never happen, and if it does, it will be too late

### Sustainability---AT: AI Solves/Sustainable AI---2NC

#### Sustainable AI is an ideology rooted in techno-determinism that inflates the capabilities of AI and relies upon capitalist and hegemonic power structures. Means it fails and creates false hope

sh

[The basis for the persistent belief in the good use of AI can be found
in the ideological discourse surrounding AI]{.underline} (see, e.g.,
Brevini, 2021a). As Feenberg (1999) has argued, technologies do not rely
solely on a socio-technical network. Instead, there exists an
ideological superstructure that plays a crucial role in the evolution of
technologies (Feenberg, 2005) -- a complete cultural horizon enriched
with narratives and visions that influence the development and use of
technologies (Feenberg, 1999, p. 87). This brings with it a shift in
perspective that requires one to zoom out from the socio-technical
(beyond-technology) to the ideological (as-ideology) perspective.^8^
This shift is tellingly captured by Sheila Jasanoff's (2015) concept of
"socio-technical imaginaries" (p. 4). She defines socio-technical
imaginaries as "a collectively held, institutionally stabilized and
publicly implemented vision of desirable futures, animated by shared
views on forms of social life and social order, attainable through and
supportive of advances in science and technology" (Jasanoff, 2015, p.
4). With this concept, Jasanoff emphasizes how technologies are at once
grounded in the practical socio-material reality of their current
applications while at the same time fueled by future visions and
forward-looking projections. Every technological advancement is
enveloped by both a socio-technical and ideological context, making it
impossible to disentangle technology from these pervasive influences.
Instead, it must always be regarded in relation to the imaginaries
attached to it. The reality of any technology is invariably shaped by
the image of what it should (not) become according to certain contexts
and particular powerful actors (Jasanoff, 2015).^9^

Regarding sustainable AI, corporate narratives and images suggest that
great potentials lie within the use of, for instance, big data,
predictive analytics, and generative AI. T[he contention is that if we
can mitigate the negative impacts of AI developments and ensure their
"ethically sound and sustainable"]{.underline} use, they bear the
potential to be "a success that leads to a better society and a
healthier planet" (Cowls et al., 2023, p. 303). This narrative [is
closely linked to late capitalist ideology and its reverence for the
power of technology at large]{.underline}. In this context, [the path
towards sustainable AI is essentially an extension of this and the
adjunct ideologies
of *techno-solutionism* and *techno-determinism*]{.underline} (Brevini,
2021a; see also Morozov, 2013).

The [techno-deterministic tale presents the future as predestined and
inevitably dominated by AI applications]{.underline}, leaving the
public, politics, and academia to discuss the challenges and
opportunities of these technologies within the confines of an already
predetermined set of possible futures. Here, [the deterministic belief
stretches between the "real" methods of machine learning]{.underline}
and deep learning [that are actually impacting societies and the
"imaginary," mythological touch that inflates the "real" effects and
lures with great promises]{.underline} (Elish & boyd, 2018). Benedetta
Brevini (2021a) calls this the always lingering and unspoken hope that
"when the artificial machine arrives -- in this future/present which is
always inevitably imminent -- it will manifest as a superior
intelligence" that will "outsmart humans" and mend all of our problems
(p. 155). The rationale behind the commitment towards sustainable AI
"always waivers between the real and the imaginary" (Elish & boyd, 2018,
p. 62) -- between what AI technologies can actually do, and what they
promise to be. This is the socio-technical and ideological imaginary of
sustainable AI: While the "real" is at the core of employing sustainable
AI, the "imaginary" already tends toward a rising future.

In this way, [artificial intelligence becomes an ideology,^10^ fueling
the belief that AI technologies can be "the solution to otherwise
intractable social, political, and economic problem]{.underline}s, and
seem to promise efficiency, neutrality, and fairness" (Elish & boyd,
2018, p. 74). In the wake of this ideology, sustainable AI occurs as the
"magic tool to rescue the global capitalist system from its dramatic
failures" (Brevini, 2021a, p. 149), [ignoring the fact that "the real"
applications,]{.underline} such as smart grids and AI in healthcare[,
are but a drop in the ocean]{.underline}.^11^ Understood as a
socio-technical imaginary, [sustainable AI thus becomes the
ideologically charged manifestation of society's collective perception
of what ought to be regarded as desirable]{.underline} -- ethically
sound and resource-friendly AI --and what is rendered as unthinkable --
a world without AI technologies (Jasanoff, 2015, p. 4).

With this ideological twist, the critical debates concerning
AI-beyond-technology are quickly hijacked by a techno-solutionist
faith---after all, everyone can get on board with ethical and
sustainable technologies. Critics and proponents alike align themselves
toward the predestined future and toward AI-as-technology's expected
influences. All of this is backed by the authority of the "scientific,
economic and political elites who control computer technology and claim
a scientifically legitimated right to decide its future course of
development." (Berman, 1992, p. 112) This is the ideological blanket
that cloaks the socio-technical imaginary of sustainable AI. Under this
cover, however, sustainable AI represents a manifestation of the current
cultural horizon, the trends and dominant ideas of modern capitalist
societies.This means that [the conception of sustainable AI contains the
very clearly observable "constraints of a technical code]{.underline}
\[that\] produces a concrete device that 'fits' a specific social
context" (Feng & Feenberg, 2008, p. 117). In other words, as Feng and
Feenberg have [elaborated, technologies always conform to the cultural
background of society. That is, all technological choices emerge out of
hegemonic power relations and specific socio-cultural
conditions]{.underline} (Feng & Feenberg, 2008). From this, it follows
that the prevailing technological choices are always contingent.
[Technological development is never the self-evident result of a "pure"
pursuit for progress]{.underline}, efficiency, or innovation. Instead,
it is always determined by a set of historically grown cultural,
economic, and political values and practices (Feenberg, 1999; Feng &
Feenberg, 2008).

This can be precisely observed in the case of sustainable AI when
considering the dimension of AI-as-ideology. The [current conception of
sustainable AI is a contingent technological choice prompted by current
hegemonic]{.underline} power relations and socio-cultural [conditions.
However, the ideologically charged socio-technical imaginary of
sustainable AI hides the fact that its supposed solutions always remain
within the historical confines of capitalism]{.underline} and simply
reinforce hegemonic imperatives (Berman, 1992). This introduces yet
another question: What are these hegemonic imperatives and the
underlying assumptions that constitute the horizon of sustainable AI?

Expanding on the aforementioned insights, this section takes a step
toward uncovering the dominant interests and ideologies that fuel the
current drive toward sustainable AI. I continue the critical assessment
which started from the AI-beyond-technology perspective and gained
further momentum by turning toward the narratives and interests
manifested in AI-as-ideology. The aim now is to deconstruct these
dominant interests and underscore their role in the contingent nature of
the prevailing technological choices (see Feenberg, 1999). By expanding
the analysis started in the previous section, I shed light on the
ideology and the driving forces behind sustainable AI. Therefore, this
section serves as the core argument of this paper: it demonstrates how
[the idea of sustainable AI is fundamentally rooted in an unsustainable
socio-cultural horizon]{.underline}. In the process, I will delve into
the connections between AI, ideology, and capitalism, with the goal of
providing a clear and concise comprehension of how they interact in the
quest for sustainable AI.

**Techno-solutionism and the promise of (super-)intelligence**

[As we have seen, the current advancements of sustainable AI are
fundamentally built on the ideological belief in AI's potential to offer
solutions, particularly in the context of sustainability and climate
challenges.]{.underline} This techno-solutionist belief can be traced
back to the very beginning of AI research and its now resurgent promise
of (super-)intelligence. The study of AI started with the endeavor to
create machines that can think or act like humans (Verdegem, 2021, p.
4). At the beginning of the 20th century, the idea of creating an AI,
according to Alan Turing (1950), involved programming a machine in such
a way that it may resemble human intelligence. Later in the 1950s, the
term "artificial intelligence" was coined to introduce a research
initiative that would attempt "to find how to make machines use
language, form abstractions, and concepts, solve kinds of problems now
reserved for humans, and improve themselves." (McCarthy et al., 1955, p.
12) This marks the initial ambition to create a true AI.

However, the advancement of the field saw these original endeavors
stretched and brought together with progress in related areas, including
logic-based computational systems, statistics, data analysis, and
database management (see, e.g., M. L. Jones, 2018; Joyce et al., 2021;
Plasek, 2016). As such, the ideal of creating an intelligent machine
became integrated with other fields, such as data science and
statistics. With this, the advancements of AI technologies became part
of the historical trajectories that have been labeled "data driven
logics" (Joyce et al., 2021, p. 2; see also Joque, 2022), "datafication"
(Cukier & Mayer-Schoenberger, 2013), a "fetishism for counting"
(Hacking, 1982), and a "culture of prediction" (Jones, 2018, p. 674).
These developments led to Cukier and Meyer-Schoenberger (2013) observing
that data-driven AI technologies may broadly be viewed as "only the
latest step in humanity's quest to understand and quantify the world"
(p. 34). Creating AI systems thus became entwined with the endeavor to
collect ever more data and knowledge about the world.In this regard,
Campolo and Crawford (2020) have observed a faith and "discourse of an
exceptional, enchanted, otherworldly and superhuman intelligence" that
may provide unprecedented access to previously inaccessible knowledge as
well as novel insights due to a "superhuman accuracy and performance"
(pp. 9, 15). Exactly these hopes for the potential of an intelligent
machine seem to express themselves particularly explicitly in the
pursuit for sustainable AI (see Brevini, 2021a as quoted above).
Specifically, w[hen using AI for climate solutions, there is an
underlying tone calling for fixes that are beyond human capabilities,
solutions that only a machine could provide]{.underline}.^12^ This call
seemingly implies that an AI with capacities beyond that of humans --
not always in the sense of a general artificial intelligence but in
terms of problem-solving and organizational skills based on massive
amounts of data -- can save humanity from the immanent catastrophe. By
virtue of it being better than humans -- that is, being better able to
make decisions and instantiate organization -- [AI systems can
supposedly help drive sustainable development]{.underline}.

The tale of techno-solutionism and the intelligent machine demonstrates
how AI-as-technology swiftly becomes AI-as-ideology. [What initially may
have appeared to be a purely technological endeavor]{.underline} -- and
what is certainly still regarded as such (see, e.g., Sætra, 2023) --
[is, in fact, infused with ideological narratives and myths]{.underline}
(see, e.g., Brevini, 2021a), with the "real" becoming the "imaginary."
[Far from being an actual solution to societal problems, sustainable AI
has become a mythological promise.]{.underline}

This [points us toward the role of capitalist dynamics within the
endeavor of sustainable AI.]{.underline} Although initially rather
opaque, [there is a close connection between AI, techno-solutionism, the
promise of (super-)intelligence and capitalist imperatives.]{.underline}
This begins with the historical trajectories of "datafication" and "the
culture of prediction," which can be partially traced to early
systematic advances in data accumulation. These advances brought the
field of data science together with the drive for efficiency of late
industrial capitalism. As Craig Robertson (2021) has highlighted, at the
end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th century, accumulating and
evaluating data became central for businesses. Data has been used to
analyze market trends and make informed decisions about investments,
production, and other activities. By collecting data on consumer
behavior, market conditions, and other factors, businesses aimed to make
predictions about how different policies and actions would impact
economic performance. The gathering, handling, analyzing, and
circulating of data became increasingly important, always with the aim
of better controlling production. Gathering data from production, sales,
finance, and even from weather and crop records became a way of making
the most efficient economic decisions. Planning based on data became
essential for running day-to-day operations, with a focus on predicting
the future to increase profits. As such, capitalist production in the
20th century came to revolve around data and efficiency: "efficiency
emerged as the goal not only of modern business but also of the economy
and society in general" (Robertson, 2021, p. 170).^13^ With this quest
for efficiency also came the pursuit of knowing what to produce and when
to produce it. In this vein, gathering data from all available sources
became a central imperative in the capitalist endeavor to plan
production efficiently, with "predicting the future \[increasingly
seen\] as the path to profit" (Robertson, 2021, p. 170).

[This model of capitalist organization became tightly linked to the
practices of data collection and analysis, as well as to the idea that
problems can be solved through technical means alone]{.underline}
(Robertson, 2021, pp. 169 -- 173). [Connected to this historical context
is the neo-liberal and techno-solutionist discourse that now warrants
the quest for sustainable AI]{.underline} (Brevini, 2023; Jonsson &
Mósesdóttir, 2023). As Feenberg (2010) recognizes, "technology is not
merely instrumental to specific goals but shapes a way of life"; vice
versa, it is also inscribed by a socio-economic horizon, specific
interests, and ideologies (p. 67; see also Goeminne, 2013). As
Jasanoff's concept of socio-technical imaginaries establishes, the
technological endeavor becomes part of and reinforces a larger
ideological frame: AI-as-technology blends with AI-as-ideology. [The use
of certain technologies, such as AI, for sustainability, is thus
warranted by an inherently capitalist horizon and its interests in
efficiency, control, and productivity]{.underline} (Feenberg, 2005,
2010). As such, one might suggest that [utilizing AI for sustainable
purposes does exactly that, securing the dominant socio-economic
interests of neo-liberal capitalism]{.underline} (Feenberg, 2005, p.
52). The next section analyzes the specifics of these interests in the
case of sustainable AI.

**Capitalist imperatives and the myth of "good" intentions**

[The pursuit of sustainable AI is not driven primarily by "good"
intentions, such as the desire to create sustainable and ethical
solutions; instead, it is first and foremost the material and
technological manifestation of a specific socio-economic
horizon]{.underline}. That is, sustainable AI is the technical solution
to problems such as climate change from a capitalist and
techno-solutionist vantage point. Having mapped the ideological
background of techno-solutionism, the following discussion details [the
capitalist influence on sustainable AI,]{.underline} which [can be
observed most prominently in the connection between data and
capital.]{.underline}

AI methods and big data practices represent essentially two sides of the
same coin. [Without data, there is no AI, and without AI applications,
there is no use for the large amounts of data collected. That is, AI
technologies correspond intrinsically to the culture of
datafication]{.underline}. Often, the belief appears to be that "the
machine \[e.g., the AI system\] consumes and learns from vast amounts of
data" and that the resulting decisions are thus "informed by objective
data and free of cognition biases and emotions" (Nishant et al., 2020,
p. 2). However, it must be recognized that [the neutrality or pure
rationality supposedly enabled by a technological system is an
ideological myth]{.underline} (Feenberg, 2005, pp. 51 -- 52). [Data has
never been neutral, and because data needs at least a minimum level of
interpretation to be meaningful at all, it never will be]{.underline}
(D'Ignazio & Klein, 2020). Indeed[, data collection embodies a certain
way of approaching, organizing, and controlling the world that is firmly
rooted in historical capitalist developments]{.underline} (see, e.g.,
Sadowski, 2019).

Present data-collecting methods can partly be traced back to the early
advent of capitalism. For instance, Silvia Federici has described how
already in the 16th and 17th centuries, during the processes of
primitive accumulation,^14^ forms of generalized and systematized data
collection started to gain traction, until they really took off in the
18th and 19th centuries. At that time, [data collection was part of "the
introduction of demographic recording]{.underline} (census-taking,
recording of mortality, natality, marriage rates[)," one of the earliest
attempts to establish new standardized modes of governance]{.underline}
and bureaucracy (Federici, 2004, p. 84). [By collecting information
about people's lives and circumstances, governments]{.underline} and
those in power [were able to identify and address potential sources of
unrest, prevent the development of large-scale social
movements]{.underline}, and maintain the status quo. [As such, the
accumulation of data corresponded to the accumulation of labor and was
early on appropriated by economic developments and capital
interests.]{.underline} Collecting data became linked to the early
evolutions of capitalist modes of organization, privatization, and labor
harnessing. This close relation between capital and data has continued
into the present day, with [data continuously used as a means of
exploitation and control]{.underline} (Federici, 2004).

From this perspective, data (at least in its current usage) is deeply
intertwined with capital interests and dynamics. Jathan Sadowski (2019),
for instance, has described the inherent drive for ever more
accumulation in the modern data economy. Emphasizing the historical
underpinnings sketched here, he explains that data is not something that
already exists in the world waiting to be discovered. Instead, it is
created for a specific purpose through the use of technology. That is,
collecting data involves selecting and measuring specific aspects of the
world that are deemed relevant while disregarding others, a selection
process influenced by certain goals and assumptions. This has
historically been the goal of controlling populations and organizing
production for efficiency. In that way, the process of accumulating and
using data is a contested process that involves making choices about
what data to collect, how to interpret it, and how to use it (Sadowski,
2019, p. 2). Therefore, [sustainable AI must always be situated within
this political economy of data accumulation and be understood as a
powerful facilitator that constantly restructures socio-material
relations.]{.underline}

This long-cultivated [historical influence of capitalist interests
within the current developments of AI technologies can more recently be
observed in the influence of large corporations.]{.underline} Again,
sustainable [AI is not the result of good intentions and well-meaning
individuals]{.underline} but instead embodies a socio-economic
rationale, [an idea exemplified by the fact that the most recent wave of
and "hype" about AI]{.underline} started around 2012. That year,
AlexNet, a deep neural network algorithm developed by a research team in
Toronto, won the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge
(Whittaker, 2021, p. 52; see also Dotan & Milli, 2019), "a benchmark in
object category classification and detection on hundreds of object
categories and millions of images" (Russakovsky et al., 2015). Even
though the methodologies of machine learning and data science had
already existed for a while and had been well researched (see, e.g.,
Wang & Raj, 2017), the success of AlexNet ushered in a new era of AI
hype. Thus, although AlexNet did not use or introduce new methods or
techniques (it relied on well-known deep learning methods), its success
still marked an opening, the start of the deep learning boom, showcasing
the capabilities of machine learning algorithms, specifically deep
learning approaches, in conjunction with large amounts of data and the
appropriate computational power (Whittaker, 2021, p. 52; see also Dotan
& Milli, 2019). Suddenly, deep neural networks were picked up across
various different domains (McQuillan, 2022, p. 13), with the term "AI"
entering usage as a marketing symbol: ["Tech companies quickly
(re)branded machine learning and other data-driven approaches as AI,
framing them as the product of breakthrough scientific
innovation]{.underline}" (Whittaker, 2021, p. 52).

Thus, [today's discourses on AI predominantly refer to an idea of
AI-as-technology, braced by the myths of AI-as-ideology, crucially
influenced by the boom and branding of tech companie]{.underline}s.
Current conceptions of AI build on broad corporate commitments to data
collection, increased processing power in the hands of these
corporations, as well as machine learning and deep learning techniques
in connection to specialized human skills (Elish & boyd, 2018, p. 61).
That is, [AI's recent rise is the result of increasing corporate
interests pushing technological advances and developing computationally
intensive algorithms to expand possibilities for collecting, storing,
and analyzing ever more data, valorizing this data, and increasing
profits. This, of course, also applies to sustainable AI]{.underline}.
The capital-backed contention is that AI technologies may provide novel
climate solutions (see, e.g., Vinuesa et al., 2020). The ideological
promises of (super-)intelligence and technological solutions derail any
further doubt about this, firmly anchoring the idea of sustainable AI
within a capitalist socio-economic horizon.

#### The Problem with Sustainable AI. Sustainable AI is a capitalist myth\-\--data driven AI ensures extraction that causes more environmental harms than it solves, it is built on the backs of corporate values, and ensures continuous commodification of humans

Returning to [the three pillars of sustainability -- economic, social,
and environmental]{.underline} -- and viewing them in the context of the
background provided here [identifies unavoidable issues for the concept
of sustainable AI. Although sustainable AI promises to provide solutions
to climate problems and other sustainability challenges, it is crucial
to recognize that this very conception originates out of historically
cultivated capitalist imperatives]{.underline}, fundamentally built on
an ideology of techno-solutionism. This marks a dilemma. Others have
shown and argued that a "[capitalist sustainable transition appears to
be a mission impossible,"]{.underline} especially [on the grounds of
"fetishizing naïve techno-solutionism"]{.underline} (Jonsson &
Mósesdóttir, 2023, p. 243). Hence[, sustainable AI may represent a dead
end for sustainability. Moreover, it may even lead us further from being
truly sustainable]{.underline} or ethically sound, as Kate Crawford
(2021) has highlighted: "[AI relies on many kinds of extraction: from
harvesting the data made from our daily activities and expressions, to
depleting natural resources, and to exploiting labor around the globe so
that this vast planetary network can be built and
maintained]{.underline}" (p. 32). All in all, [in each of the three
dimensions, sustainable AI falls short.]{.underline}

**AI is built on economic exploitation**

[AI's economic exploitation is exemplified by the data-capital
connection and the influence of big tech on AI's
developments.]{.underline} The [leading corporations prioritize
maximizing profits and gaining market dominance while
sidelining]{.underline} truly ethical and [sustainable
concerns]{.underline} (see, e.g., Srnicek, 2016). In this environment,
[data extraction and valorization are the driving imperative of the
current AI economy, which exploits and capitalizes on users]{.underline}
(see Sadowski, 2019). [Even the pipelines within which this data is
processed are built on exploitation,]{.underline} as in the case of the
underpayment and poor working conditions of data workers (Miceli et al.,
2022). For instance, OpenAI's massive success with ChatGPT was enabled
by exploiting Kenyan workers, who were grossly underpaid and had to
label toxic content and hate speech to build a safety system for the
chatbot (Perrigo, 2023). More broadly[, the economic exploitation by the
AI industry manifests in socio-economic systems of oppression and
discrimination]{.underline}: Everything from AI-based networked media to
the supply chains of digital platforms and the production of hardware
for [AI technologies relies on exploitative labor frequently drawn from
the Global South]{.underline} (see, e.g., Altenried, 2020; P. Jones,
2021). [Socio-economically vulnerable groups are particularly exposed to
and negatively affected by these effects and the implications of data
aggregation]{.underline} (for detailed work on this subject, see, e.g.,
Eubanks, 2018; Kröger et al., 2021; Mühlhoff, 2019, 2020a; Noble, 2018;
O'Neil, 2016).

**AI is built on environmental exploitation**

Benedetta Brevini has thoroughly highlighted the negative environmental
impacts of AI in her book *Is AI good for the planet?* (Brevini, 2021b).
[From energy infrastructures and the environmental costs of data centers
to the mining of rare earths and other materials for the production of
AI hardware, the extensive water consumption, and the disposal of toxic
e-waste, AI-beyond-technology is harming the environment]{.underline}
(Brevini, 2021b, pp. 63 -- 91). Besides these direct effects, [AI also
connotes other environmental harms]{.underline}. A perfect example of
this is that in 2021, Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, one of the biggest
players in AI development, traveled to space, a stunt seemingly at odds
with his company's stated aim of becoming CO2-neutral by 2040. Bezos'
rocket launch, essentially funded by the AI economy, took place at a
time in which parts of the Amazon forest -- one of the world's largest
CO2 sinks -- were starting to emit CO2 rather than absorb it (Gatti et
al., 2021). This paints an almost caricature-like picture of reality,
with the new Amazon of the AI economy superseding the old Amazon forest.

**AI is built on social exploitation**

Beyond the socio-economic impacts, [data-driven AI exploits and invades
the private lives and spheres of individuals to maximize profit and
accumulation]{.underline}. In her book *The Age of Surveillance
Capitalism*, Shoshana Zuboff (2019) describes how [Big Tech and the data
imperative are affecting the lives of individuals, endangering human
autonomy and dignity, and undermining democratic processes]{.underline}:
"Individuals \[become\] the draconian quid pro quo at the heart of
surveillance capitalism's logic of accumulation, in which information
and connection are ransomed for the lucrative \[...\] data that fund its
immense growth and profits" (p. 54). On a similar note, Thatcher et al.
(2016) have described how [data extraction embodies the colonization of
the lifeworld and an accumulation of lived experience,]{.underline} with
AI corporations extracting the (experiential) realities of individuals.
In other words, [AI drives a "commodification of parts of our lives that
have never before been commodified"]{.underline} (Törnberg & Uitermark,
2021, p. 9).

[This precludes AI -- in its current form -- being described as
sustainable. The advancements of AI technologies are built on economic,
environmental, and social exploitation, which goes to show that the
solutions offered by sustainable AI from a capitalist and
techno-solutionist standpoint are not real solutions.]{.underline}
Instead, they pertain to the very problems they seek to fix. From this
perspective, the concept of [sustainable AI seemingly carries a form of
problematic circularity, namely, the attempt to use an unsustainable
tool to achieve sustainability.]{.underline} Considering this in the
context of the background established in this paper, it becomes clear
that AI-as-ideology is being used to sell AI-as-technology as a salve
for capitalism's inherent problems, ignoring the dimension of
beyond-technology.

Sustainable AI seemingly promises that technology can fix the current
failings of societies, thereby forgetting its own problems. In other
words, the AI-as-ideology narrative suggests that AI-as-technology will
engender a better society and a healthier planet while disguising the
exploitative character of AI-beyond-technology. It seems that the system
is being asked to fix itself. Granted, [AI technologies may well provide
good climate solutions]{.underline}, such as water management systems,
efficient energy infrastructures, and traffic and transportation
solutions (see, e.g., Cowls et al., 2023; Nishant et al., 2020).
[However, as we have seen, the social, economic, and environmental costs
of these supposed solutions are considerable, meaning that the issues
associated with AI-beyond-technology cannot be brushed
aside]{.underline}. Relying on systems built on exploitation to fix the
climate crisis seems to be a trajectory doomed to eventually arrive at a
dead end. [Sustainable AI is hiding behind its ideological
visions,]{.underline} evoking AI as "a mythical, objective omnipotence,"
when, [in fact, "it is backed by real-world forces of money, power, and
data" with considerable environmental, economic, and social costs
attached]{.underline} (Powles & Nissenbaum, 2018).

#### AI to achieve sustainability will always rely on exploitation of minorities. AI is embedded with racial biases and is made using unethical labor practices

**Vargas 25**\-\--holds a Ph.D. in Mathematics and advanced degrees in
Artificial Intelligence, and AI Ethics from institutions including the
University of Iowa, the University of Texas at Austin, and the
University of Cambridge; and was a professor at Columbia before leaving
to lead AI governance at the Department of Veterans Affairs. (Nelson,
"Exploiting the margin: How capitalism fuels AI at the expense of
minoritized groups", Springer Nature, 6/6/25,
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-024-00502-w) sh

[AI doesn't operate in a vacuum; it mirrors the society that gives it
life. The tech sector manufactures tools embedded with social biases,
training AI models that 'think' like a corporation]{.underline}---which
are predominantly steered by white men \[1, p.35\]---at the expense of
ambitions and morals \[16\]. [This predilection for efficiency over
human values carries profound implications for the implementation of
AI-driven social services and their consequences for marginalized
communities.]{.underline} The rapid proliferation of automated systems
in these services raises concerns surrounding fairness, transparency,
and accountability, driven by the relentless pursuit of efficiency. In
this section, we aim to illustrate how [capitalism's influence on AI
systems consistently drives them to perpetuate disparities, whether in
terms of labor exploitation,]{.underline} unequal time burdens, [or the
erosion of minority well-being, underscoring how marginalized
communities are disproportionately affected]{.underline} across various
dimensions of AI development.

3.1 Labor tax: How underpaying minority workers fuels AI development. In
their investigative piece The Exploited Labor Behind Artificial
Intelligence, Williams, Miceli, and Gebru \[24\] expose the harsh
realities faced by gig [workers in the AI industry,]{.underline} who
[are disproportionately drawn from vulnerable populations. Big tech
players]{.underline} in the AI industry such as Amazon and Facebook
[heavily rely on these laborers,]{.underline} including data labelers,
content moderators, and delivery drivers. These workers, despite their
indispensable contributions, often endure abysmal pay, constant
surveillance, unrealistic quotas, and even safety hazards. Further
details from the investigation reveal that data labelers, responsible
for critical AI training data, can earn as little as \$1.77 per task. In
the troubling case of content moderators in Kenya, they are relentlessly
monitored to make split-second decisions, even when confronted with
disturbing content. [These workers, whose labor sustains billion-dollar
companies, are unjustly compensated.]{.underline}

Izaguirre \[9\] discussed a very recent example of labor exploitation
within the gig economy from the ridesharing giants, Uber and Lyft. In
New York, these companies are set to pay a staggering \$328 million to
settle complaints that they wrongly imposed taxes and fees on their
drivers that should have been covered by passengers. State Attorney
General Letitia James unveiled this settlement, emphasizing how Uber and
Lyft---which incorporate AI technologies for routing and pricing
algorithms---had systematically deprived their drivers of millions of
dollars in earnings and essential benefits. The drivers, akin to those
engaged in data labeling for AI models, toiled for long hours in
challenging conditions while being undercompensated. The repercussions
of such labor exploitation have wide-ranging implications, demonstrating
the persistence of these issues across different sectors of the gig
economy. These drivers, often working long hours in challenging
conditions, waited an arduous eight years for justice, emphasizing the
enduring time burden in their battle for rights--we will explore the
time dimension in the next subsection.

[Moreover, racial capitalism also rears its head in other ways in
generative media AI applications]{.underline}. Startups have built
systems to synthesize fake profile photos [by exploiting images of
minority models without consent or payment. The marginalized provide raw
material---their unvalued data and likenesses---to advance technologies
from which they do not benefit]{.underline}. An example of this is the
Argentina-based design firm, Icons8, which built generative AI systems
to synthesize fake profile photos by exploiting minority likenesses
\[8\]. Though the models' images provided core training data, they
received no payment for this labor, nor any share of the systems'
profits derived from their inputs. Once again, [capitalism fueled AI
development by commodifying bodies. The models' data and likenesses
became raw materials for tech advancement from which they did not
equally gain.]{.underline} This case provides further evidence that we
must scrutinize and address the human exploitation underlying much AI
progress.

3.2 Time surcharge: The burden on minorities to fix biased systems

In 2019, [a pivotal federal study by NIST unveiled the entrenched racial
biases within facial recognition algorithms, revealing higher false
positive rates for Asian, African American, and Native American faces
compared to white counterparts]{.underline} \[7\]. This disparity is
[not merely a technical oversight but a reflection of a broader societal
issue where fairness is often assessed through a predominantly white
lens,]{.underline} perpetuating and amplifying harmful racial
stereotypes. These algorithms, failing more frequently with Black and
Asian individuals, not only reinforce the misconception of homogeneity
within these communities but also echo Cedric Robinson's argument that
[capitalism morphs pre-existing social differences into racial
disparities, using technology to further these divides.]{.underline}

[These biases extend beyond race to gender and age, with algorithms
showing elevated error rates for women, the elderly, and the
young]{.underline} compared to middle-aged white men. Simone Browne, in
Dark Matters \[3, p. 113\], elucidates how these systems perpetuate
stereotypes, such as misclassifying Asian males as females and Black
women as men[, illustrating how AI models, like capitalism, disseminates
racial and gender stereotypes on a massive scale under the guise of
technological neutrality.]{.underline}

The case of Brandon Mayfield, as discussed by Browne, exemplifies how
biases in AI systems can have real-world consequences. A veteran and a
lawyer who had recently converted to Islam, Mayfield was erroneously
matched by FBI algorithms to a fingerprint found on a bag containing a
detonating device linked to the 2004 Madrid bombing \[3, p. 115\].
Despite being one of twenty matches, his recent conversion to Islam and
status as a veteran, both associated with prejudicial stereotypes, led
authorities to single him out. Mayfield's personal life and beliefs were
publicly exposed under a false accusation, and he remained entangled in
legal battles to clear his name until November 2010. This wrongful
identification underscores how minoritized groups not only bear the
brunt of these biases but also face a "Privacy Levy," paying a
significant personal and financial price due to prejudiced technological
systems.

This systemic bias embedded within AI technologies serves capitalist
ends in several ways. Firstly, [it perpetuates a cycle where the burden
of correcting and navigating biased systems falls disproportionately on
marginalized communities, consuming their time and
resources]{.underline}---a "Time Surcharge" [that benefits the status
quo by maintaining existing power dynamics]{.underline}. Secondly, [the
deployment of such technologies]{.underline}, especially in law
enforcement and surveillance, [opens lucrative markets for tech
companies, capitalizing on the state's desire to monitor and control,
often at the expense of those already marginalized.]{.underline} In
essence, these biased algorithms are not just products of existing
societal inequalities; [they are tools that capitalism exploits to
further entrench its dominance,]{.underline} ensuring that the costs of
innovation are borne by those least able to bear them, while the profits
accrue to those already in positions of power.

It is important to point out that the concept of a "Time Surcharge"
extends beyond the realm of AI and technological bias, reflecting a
broader systemic issue that minoritized communities face across various
bureaucratic and social systems. This enduring burden of time, as
analyzed in the context of racialized administrative burdens by Ray,
Herd, and Moynihan in Racialized Burdens: Applying Racialized
Organization Theory to the Administrative State \[20\], is often
utilized as a means to punish and control, reinforcing poor living
conditions. Similar to the [ways in which biased algorithms require
marginalized groups to navigate and correct flawed systems, these
bureaucratic processes consume excessive amounts of time, serving as
barriers that maintain social and economic inequalities.]{.underline}
These practices are [reminiscent of historical strategies designed to
disenfranchise and exploit marginalized population]{.underline}s,
perpetuating a cycle where the costs of bureaucratic inefficiency and
technological innovation are disproportionately borne by those least
equipped to handle them, while the systems in place continue to benefit
those in power.

The [development and implementation of biased AI systems are stark
manifestations of racial capitalism, where technological advancements
are leveraged to amplify and profit from racial and social
disparities]{.underline}. The need for a concerted effort to address
these biases is not just a matter of technical accuracy but of
challenging the capitalist structures that incentivize and benefit from
the perpetuation of inequality.

3.3 The wellbeing toll: How AI progress erodes minority health

The [advancement of AI technology, hailed as a cornerstone of modern
innovation, often conceals a human toll disproportionately borne by
marginalized communities]{.underline}. D'Ignazio and Klein's observation
\[4, p. 183\] that the tech industry relies on the precarious labor of
older women of color, contrasts sharply with the privileged demographics
of Silicon Valley. [This labor force, essential to refining AI
technologies, faces not just economic exploitation but significant
mental health challenges,]{.underline} as Billy Perrigo's investigations
\[17, 18\] into the conditions of data labelers reveal. [Workers engaged
in making AI systems safer endure traumatic content exposure for meager
wages, suffering profound mental health impacts]{.underline} without
adequate support. [This reality underscores a capitalist calculus where
AI progress is prioritized over the well-being of those who enable
it]{.underline}, revealing a stark exploitation that benefits
technological advancement and profit margins at a significant human
cost.

### Sustainability---AT: Arctic Sustainability---2NC

#### "Sustainable development" is not a possibility in the Arctic\-\--leads to more climate destabilization

**Finger 22**\-\--Research Professor at the Northern Arctic Federal
University, the European University Institute, and Istanbul Technical
University, with a PhD in Political Science and Government from the
University of Geneva. (Matthias, "Sustainable Development of the
Arctic?", Springer Nature, 2/25/22,
https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-81253-9_17#Sec9) sh

[The reason why "human activities" are conceptualized in a such generic
way by Earth System experts is the result of the profound
epistemological divide between the natural and the social
sciences.]{.underline} This is less the fault of the Earth System
experts than a result of the failure of the social sciences to
epistemologically acknowledge the very bio-physical foundations (and
limitations) of the economic and social activities they are studying.
This [failure has led the social scientists to believe that Development
can be sustained indefinitely into the future]{.underline} (for example,
"sustainable development["), a belief that is particularly widespread
among economists]{.underline} (Georgescu-Roegen, 1971). [As a result,
the social sciences have become a tool of (human]{.underline}, social,
economic, industrial) Development , rather than the critical analysis of
it. Yet, from an Earth Systems dynamics point of view, it is fair to say
that *"Development* *is the problem, not the solution".*^Footnote3^

[The most recent and the most obvious expression of the unsustainable
nature of Development is the so-called "Great Acceleration"]{.underline}
of the past 50--70 years (McNeil and Engelke, 2016). During this most
recent epoch -- which some equate to the Anthropocene, as shown above --
[all the main indicators reflecting threats to the habitability of
planet Earth, such as greenhouse gas emissions, population growth,
top-soil depletion, ocean acidification, biodiversity loss, global
warming, and many others more have increased exponentially.]{.underline}
Even more worrisome is that [all these indicators correlate almost
perfectly with indicators of Development]{.underline} , such as real
GDP, foreign direct investment, primary energy use, telecommunications,
transportation, and many others. Figure 17.2 graphically represents a
few of the key (socio-economic) variables measuring Development during
the past 250-plus years.

While the Great Acceleration is not limited to the above 12 variables,
it can basically be extended to almost every single variable reflecting
some aspect of industrial development , such as cell phone uptake,
chicken production, cardio-vascular diseases, obesity, healthcare
expenditures, McDonald's outlets, or global tourism for that matter. It
is probably fair to say that, from such an Earth System Dynamics point
of view, the Great Acceleration is most probably going to be very
short-lived, as such a great acceleration cannot be sustained, even if
it were to be stabilized. This is both because of input (resources) and
output (global warming, pollution) of industrial development .

As a result, it is also no longer appropriate to summarize the effects
of industrial development on the dynamics of the Earth System as
stemming simply from "human activities". A much more sophisticated
conceptualization of "human activities" is in order. Also, these "human
activities" must be put into an institutional and historical perspective
going beyond the past 50--70 years (Great Acceleration) or even
150 years (Industrial Revolution[). This Great Acceleration is merely
the last stage of a process I call "Development ", which is the result
of the co-evolution of institutions (rules) and technology (applied
science]{.underline}).

The origins of Development can be traced back to the militant
Christianization of Europe in the aftermath of the Fall of the Roman
Empire (Buc, 2015; White 1967). Christianism laid the cultural
foundation for Western technological development , which became
secularized during the protestant Reformation and the Renaissance
(White, 1968). Over the next 200 years, rationalism, the inseparable
scientific/military Revolution and the rise of the modern nation-State
on the model of the Vatican led to a mathematical understanding and from
there on to the mastery of the world, also thanks to colonization
powered by Western technology (Daly, 2014). Like manipulatory science
came to replace religion, political theology came to be replaced by
theological politics ("monarchies based on divine law"), ultimately
confusing democracy and the army during the French Revolution (for
example, "citizen-soldier") (Tilly, 1990). In the nation-State,
militarism, science (the new religion), and engineering became
inextricably interwoven to turn into the main drivers of conquest,
colonialism, Europeanization or simply annihilation of entire
civilizations paralleled by the spreading of the Christian and
nation-State-led model of Development , an argument so aptly made by
Ivan Illich (Hartch, 2015).

With the Industrial Revolution, Development became powered by
non-renewable resources (coal and later oil and gas), along with
minerals, and thus accelerated significantly. Simultaneously,
Development became equated with economic growth. The nation-state, in
addition to preparing for war, now also turned into a powerful
"Development agency". Development as economic growth was promoted since
the Second World War and for all UN Member States and citizens thereof,
as *the* historical driving force towards human progress. During the
Cold War and the period of decolonization, "fossil-fuel-powered
development " (Auzanneau, 2015) rebranded itself as something new, even
though developmentalism remains essentially rooted in the Western sense
of time, history , progress, evolution and irreversibility.
Consequently, the Western urban-industrialized society (and even more so
the American consumer society) was, after the Second World War,
considered to be the best and only model and the ultimate stage of
Development . After the Second World War, the traumatic birth of the
atomic age and the frightening long interlude of the Cold War,
Development became the new name for "peace". However, after the
unexpected auto-dissolution of the Soviet Empire, and with neoliberal
hyper-industrial capitalism being declared the winner of the Cold War,
the American Dream (happiness and opulence), or economic growth and
technological progress for all and forever, became the new religion, a
sort of "paradise" created by science, technology and the "market", yet
a market whose lease on life is granted by nation-States.

**Arctic Tipping Points**

[The cumulative and recent effects of Development now significantly
affect all dimensions of the Earth System, thus destabilizing the more
stable Holocene]{.underline}, which had given rise to the Agricultural
Revolution that allowed civilizations to emerge. CO~2~ emissions, among
other things, are [altering the chemistry of the atmosphere and
are leading to global warming. Deforestation, industrial agriculture,
and urbanization, among other things, are altering the lithosphere and
lead to biodiversity decline and loss of soil fertility.]{.underline}
Water pollution and ocean warming are altering the chemistry of the
hydrosphere and are leading to ocean acidification, biodiversity loss,
and changing ocean currents, etc. Finally, [global warming is altering
the cryosphere, thus leading to loss of polar and mountainous ice
cover.]{.underline}

The [interactions among these dimensions, and especially global warming
in the atmosphere, are triggering feedback loops]{.underline}, thus
accelerating and exacerbating the destabilizing effects of Development
on the Earth System. Some of the particularly powerful feedback loops
trigger so-called "tipping points". Tipping points define thresholds
that, if crossed, trigger runaway transformations of the Earth System,
which may or may not lead to new stable states, although none of these
were experienced by Homo sapiens during its 300,000 or so years of
existence.

Among the main currently identified tipping points, [the three most
significant ones are in the Arctic]{.underline} (Lenton, 2012). All of
them [have global warming resulting from greenhouse gas emissions as
their underlying cause:]{.underline}

- The loss of the Arctic sea ice alters the Earth's ice-albedo effect,
  thus further accelerating global warming; this tipping point already
  has the potential to trigger "run-away global warming".

- The melting of the Greenland ice sheet alters the Ocean currents, thus
  potentially disabling the ocean circulation system and in any case
  triggering unprecedented (in the Holocene) climatic effects worldwide.

- The warming of the Arctic oceans and landmass negatively affect
  permafrost, thus triggering methane release, an even more powerful
  greenhouse gas than CO~2~, and another potential trigger of runaway
  global warming.

In this first section I have shown how Development has unfolded over the
past almost 2000 years to end up in the Great Acceleration, which is now
altering Earth System dynamics and potentially triggering tipping
points. Today's most imminent such tipping points are in the Arctic.
[Instead of taking this as a warning, however, the warming Arctic is
seen as an opportunity for more Development , both of the Arctic and
worldwide. Re-branding Development as being sustainable does not change
its destabilizing effects on the Earth System's dynamics.]{.underline}
Even if it did, [the cumulative negative effects of Development until
today are unprecedented and have already destabilized the relatively
stable Earth System of the Holocene and will continue to do
so.]{.underline} The most significant indicator in this regard is
CO~2~ emissions and corresponding CO~2~ concentration in the atmosphere,
which correlates with global average temperature. Current CO~2~ levels
in the atmosphere are approximately 30 percent higher than at than at
any point during the past 800,000 years . Temperature is likely to
follow, albeit with a certain time lag, owing to Earth Systems dynamics.

### Sustainability---AT: Dematerialization---2NC

#### Dematerialization is not possible\-\--we are stuck in a world of Digital capitalism that ensures we will always prioritize production and accumulation of wealth instead of solvent alternatives

technologies. (Sy, "Digital Technologies for Sustainable Futures",

[Digital capitalism and dematerialized (green) growth 'Digital
capitalism' signals a shift towards a specific form of capitalism where
networked digital technologies form 'the central production and control
apparatus of a]{.underline}n increasingly supranational [market
system]{.underline}' (Schiller 1999: xiv). [Digital capitalism is
synonymous with the processes and practices of neo
liberalization]{.underline} (Dean 2009, Beer 2016, Williams and Gilbert
2022), which as economic geographer David Harvey outlines 'requires
technologies of information creation and capacities to accumulate, store
transfer, analyze, and use massive databases to guide decisions in the
global marketplace' (Harvey 2005: 3). Digital technologies are integral
to the logistical infrastructures required for just‑in‑time production,
and the spatiotemporal acceleration of the circuits of production and
consumption associated with globalized consumer capitalism (Berardi
2009, Crary 2013). More recently, digital capitalism is associated with
the discourses of platform (Srnicek 2016), surveillance (Zuboff 2019),
and communicative (Dean 2009) capitalism, which foreground specific
elements of contemporary digital technology's hegemonic role within
contemporary capitalism.

Digital capitalism acknowledges empirical findings indicating multiple
breaches to planetary boundaries, but its advocates adopt an
ecomodernist position (Asafu‑Adjaye et al. 2015, Latour 2016),
contending that the boundless creativity of technological innovation
will resolve these issues. Far from comprising a fundamental
contradiction of capitalist accumulation, as is claimed by eco‑Marxists
(Moore 2015, Foster 2022), the Anthropocene is understood as a business
opportunity for 'green growth'. A societal transition towards renewable
energy and nuclear power, alongside the retention of fossil fuels whose
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are offset by technologies, including
carbon capture and storage and direct air capture, is understood as an
opportunity for shrewd businesses to flourish. This will allegedly usher
in the 'good Anthropocene' (Hamilton 2016), whereby rational human
stewardship affords ecological stability alongside enduring eco‑ nomic
growth, which will be successfully decoupled from presently observed
correlations with energy use and material footprint (Wiedmann et al.
2015, Calatayud and Mohkam 2018).

[The model of technological solutionism]{.underline} (Morozov 2014,
Taffel 2018) [under‑ pinning digital capitalism has a superficial appeal
that masks the enormous risks associated with continuing attempts to
pursue ongoing compound (exponential) increases in gross domestic
product]{.underline} (GDP). This [year‑on‑year accumulation of surplus
value is integral to capitalism, but has led to ecological
overshoot.]{.underline} [Digital capitalism's appeal is rooted in claims
that 'green growth']{.underline} and technological innovation lead to a
smart, digitally mediated future, where the rapacious levels of
consumption associated with contemporary billionaires can allegedly
become a generalized state of existence for humanity. [Such claims
thoroughgoingly internalize the bourgeois ideology which equates wealth
with private commodity ownership]{.underline}. However, for immense
numbers of people for whom neoliberal austerity has produced financial
insecurity, precarity, and material hardship, the promise of a future
containing dramatically increased material prosperity alongside
successful resolutions of ecological crises is undoubtedly attractive
(Huber 2022).\
The issue is that [this position places an enormous degree of faith in
technological progress that lacks empirical evidence]{.underline}. While
some solutionist panaceas, such as Elon Musk's vision of colonizing Mars
(Kulwin 2016), are so far‑fetched that they should simply be dismissed
outright, other forms of solutionism are more plausible, but are likely
to inflict additional environmental and social harms. Nonetheless, a
lack of evidence does not guarantee failure; neo‑Malthusian arguments
that fixed natural barriers cannot be overcome have typically failed to
account for capitalism's dynamism, its struggle to overcome any apparent
limits to an ever‑increasing rate of accumulation. As Marx (1973:
334/335) argued, 'c[apital is the endless and limitless drive to go
beyond its limiting barrier. Every boundary is and has to be a barrier
for it'. This strategy of circumnavigating apparent boundaries is
discussed by ecosocialists as a metabolic shift]{.underline} (Moore
2017), whereby the consequences of the metabolic rift between capitalism
and ecology are temporarily addressed by displacing negative
socio‑ecological effects.

Metabolic shifts occur by displacing harms across time and space, or by
adopting new technologies (Saito 2023). An insightful example of the
latter is the 'resolution' of peak oil. During the
late‑twentieth‑century peak oil, denoted concern that as discoveries of
crude oil dwindled, potential shortages would hamper social development
(Bridge 2010). Rather than presenting a hard limit, however, this led to
a technological shift towards 'unconventional oil' derived from sources
such as tar sands or using techniques such as hydraulic fracturing
(commonly known as fracking). These novel methods for obtaining oil are
more energy intensive than conventional methods, meaning they are worse
in terms of contributing to climate change, and they create novel health
and environmental threats, ranging from contaminating drinking water --
including the spectacular images of flammable drink‑ ing water evidenced
in the film Gasland (2010) -- to mercury and arsenic pollution resulting
from tar sands extraction (Timoney and Lee 2009). While the 'crisis' of
peak oil was averted, significant new harms were inflicted by this
resolution.

Homologously, [the discourse of green growth suggests that an energy
transition]{.underline} (partially) [moving away from fossil fuels will
'resolve' the climate crisis.]{.underline} However, [this ignores the
harms associated with massively expanding extractive activities to
produce sufficient energy to not only replace the 85% of global energy
generated from fossil fuels]{.underline} in 2021 (Ritchie and Roser
2021) but also additionally facilitate ongoing compound growth of that
figure. This would dramatically increase the overshoot of planetary
boundaries involving biodiversity loss, land‑system change, and chemical
pollution alongside numerous localized harms associated with mining.
Further, several recent analyses indicate critical shortages of specific
metals, such as cobalt, nickel, and copper needed for a global roll‑out
of renewable technologies (Azevedo et al. 2018, Michaux 2021). While
doubts surrounding the viability of the requisite expansion of
short‑term extraction are somewhat valid, the neo‑Malthusian framing
largely neglects the possibility of shifting resource requirements,
either technologically, such as using lithium‑iron‑phosphate batteries
to reduce the need for nickel and cobalt (Zeng et al. 2022), or
spatio‑temporally, by employing deep‑sea mining to extract cobalt from
polymetallic nodules from the oceanic floor (Sharma 2017). [The latter
process displaces harms to remote and poorly understood ecosystems,
where substantial harms may cascade across oceanic
ecologies]{.underline} (Washburn et al. 2019, Bedford, McGillivray, and
Walters 2020[). This denotes a spatial shift towards harming the oceans
and a temporal shift towards harming the future.]{.underline}
Spatio‑temporal displacements do not resolve harms they real‑ locate
them, [enabling the short‑term continuation of globalized
capitalism]{.underline}, whose ongoing demands for increased extraction,
accumulation, energy, and materials are fundamentally incompatible with
a sustainable future.\
While green growth alludes to decoupling GDP growth -- growth in
quantitative exchange value -- from material use and GHG emissions,
there is no empirical evidence this decoupling can take place at the
pace required to meet international commitments surrounding climate
change in terms of GHG, or that decoupling can take place at all in the
case of material footprint (Bringezu 2015, Calatayud and Mohkam 2018,
Hickel and Kallis 2019). However, digitally enabled 'green growth'
remains the dominant discourse for addressing global ecological crises.
[Given the manifold issues associated with technological solutionism, a
key fantasy underpinning this discourse surrounds dematerialization, the
idea that digital technologies enable infinite economic growth without
corresponding increases in materials or energy.]{.underline}

### Sustainability---AT: Markets Solve---2NC

#### Climate policies under capitalism will always prioritize markets and fail\-\--attempting to solve under cap will lead to more unjust and authoritarian responses

[The few existing mechanisms of planetary climate governance are almost
all linked in some manner to the United Nations and share all its
limitations]{.underline}. Meanwhile, [the global]{.underline} or
quasi-global [economic institutions designed to ensure the stability and
expansion of capitalism]{.underline}---including the Bank for
International Settlements, the International Monetary Fund, and the
World Trade Organization---[view climate crises as mere variables in
their calculations]{.underline}. Today, capital sometimes takes climate
seriously, but [its institutions are nonetheless either opposed to or
unmotivated to pursue a true global response.]{.underline}

There are at least two related reasons this could be the case. First,
[many firms and states have actively obstructed global climate efforts,
often while feigning support, because those efforts diminish their
expected returns.]{.underline} Others have either hindered multilateral
internationalism or not bothered to help it, because existing relations
are much more amenable to their interests. [But the pursuit of profit
does not entirely explain it. Even businesses that stand to make
billions in a changing global regulatory environment]{.underline}---J.P.
Morgan, for example, has jumped enthusiastically into the carbon credit
business---[are part of an effort to render global governance a glacial,
futile process, perhaps because they are not interested in endorsing any
potentially precedent-setting framework]{.underline} at the global
scale.

The second and linked reason is that [the UNFCCC--COP process has put
virtually all our climate eggs in the market basket. All the alleged
progress trumpeted following each of the meetings]{.underline} since
Paris 2015 [has involved deepening commitments to market-based
"solutions"]{.underline} and private-sector innovation. The [principal
regulatory tools include emissions trading schemes, carbon taxes,
net-zero offsetting, and arbitrary subsidies for carbon capture
(]{.underline}which at least in Canada often fund the fossil fuel
industry's pipe-dream promises to carbon-neutralize itself). All of this
is backed by voluntary corporate ESG (environmental, social, and
governance) commitments that, [at least on the climate front, have
largely proven a waste of the paper that the annual reports are printed
on]{.underline}.

The point of these measures is to create conditions in which
self-interested market activity will solve climate change by generating
an eco-friendly variation of what it already does. But [the limits of
each of these tools makes realizing that goal impossible. Emissions
trading schemes cover only a limited amount of economic activity. Carbon
tax rates bear no relationship to actual environmental constraints. And
"net-zero" pledges often slow efforts]{.underline} to bring emissions
down, instead relying on offsets that are widely seen as a racket.

[The current best-case scenario under the market framework involves
using industrial policy to make fossil fuels
noncompetitive.]{.underline} The path to this future is paved by robust
state support for technological development and deployment. [These
schemes ultimately involve a disingenuous performance of market
competition under a regime of national state capitalism]{.underline}. If
renewables and green tech can create an industrial structure similar to
the armaments or fossil fuel industries---where firms retain the
structure of private companies but rely on direct subsidy from the
government to sustain their profits---they will clamor to participate.

This sort of [industrial policy has been portrayed as an alternative to
more indirect neoliberal climate policies, but the current framework
still enshrines private property, profit, and the "market]{.underline}"
(however non-competitive in reality)---and all their attendant
shortcomings. As the Climate and Community Project put it in a powerful
new report, the current paradigm relies on "the theory that increasing
the demand for clean energy will crowd fossil fuels out of the
marketplace. Implicit in this strategy is the assumption that fossil
fuel firms will voluntarily close their doors as they get pushed out and
exit the market in an orderly fashion. They will not."

Even if the oil majors do close up shop and reorganize for new green
markets, it will take too long. Prophets of green growth tell us over
and over of the global economy's declining carbon intensity---the level
of emissions associated with one unit of economic growth. [But if growth
accelerates, we can still have decreasing carbon intensity and rising
emissions. And we simply do not have time to sit around]{.underline} and
congratulate the business lobby while continuing to pour greenhouse
gases into the atmosphere.

The [failure of markets to solve climate change could eventually lead to
a more panicked and authoritarian response on the part of
capital]{.underline} and the world's most powerful states. [The global
political-economic system will have to confront the potential
disintegration of capitalism]{.underline}; we might say that the
relations of governance will come into contradiction with the mode of
production. There's no reason to believe this response would work any
better than the current one, and [it will be even more unjust,
prioritizing the interests of those with the capacity to determine and
enforce the rules]{.underline} (and to decide when and how they can be
broken).

In the face of this possibility, we must refuse the imposition of the
anti-politics machine that is the market. We should also [realize it is
unlikely that the climate justice movement will be able to counter any
planetary exercise of power with an equally global
response.]{.underline} Naomi Klein is right to argue that there is no
one big answer to climate change. There might not be an umbrella
politics that can articulate the beliefs of movements around the world.
Some links will form; others won't. The next fossil-fuel-sponsored COP
matters, but it is only one among many important for a for climate
politics.

Eco-Revolution as the Only Alternative

As an extension of the current war on the planet, a regime of climate
geoengineering designed to keep the present mode of production going is
sharply opposed to the view enunciated by Barry Commoner in 1992
in Making Peace with the Planet, where he wrote: ["If the
[environment]{.mark} is [polluted and the economy is sick]{.mark}, the
virus that causes both will be found in the system of
production."]{.underline} [There can be no doubt today that it is the
present mode of production, particularly the **[system of fossil
capital, that needs to change on a]{.mark} [global
scale]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In order to stop climate change[, the
[world economy must quickly shift to zero net carbon dioxide
emissions]{.mark}. This is well within reach with a concerted effort by
human society as a whole utilizing already existing sustainable
technological means]{.underline}---[[particularly]{.mark} [when
**coupled with necessary changes in social**]{.mark}
**[organization]{.mark}** to reduce the colossal waste of resources and
lives that is built into the current alienated system of
production.]{.underline} Such changes could not simply be implemented
from the top by elites, but rather [would require the self-mobilization
of the population, inspired by the revolutionary actions of youth aimed
at egalitarian, ecological, collective, and socialized
solutions---recognizing that it is the world that they will inherit that
is most at stake.]{.underline}

Today's necessary [[ecological revolution]{.mark} [would]{.mark}
[include]{.mark} for starters: (]{.underline}1) [an emergency moratorium
on economic growth in the rich countries coupled with [downward
redistribution of income and wealth]{.mark}; (2) [radical reductions
in]{.mark} [g]{.mark}reenhouse [g]{.mark}as [e]{.mark}missions; (3)
[rapid]{.mark} [phase-out of the entire fossil fuel energy]{.mark}
[structure]{.mark}; (4) substitution of an alternative energy
infrastructure based on sustainable alternatives such as solar and wind
power and rooted in local control; (5) massive cuts in military spending
with the freed-up economic surplus to be used for ecological conversion;
(6) [promotion of circular economies]{.mark} [and zero-waste
systems]{.mark} to decrease the throughput of energy and resources; (7)
[building effective public transportation]{.mark}, together with
measures to decrease dependence on the private automobile; (8)
restoration of global ecosystems in line with local, including
indigenous, communities; (9) transformation of destructive, energy-and
chemical-intensive agribusiness-monocultural production into
agroecology, based on sustainable small farms and peasant cultivation
with their greater productivity of food per acre; (10) institution of
strong controls on the emission of toxic chemicals; (11) [prohibition
of]{.mark} the [privatization]{.mark} of freshwater resources; (12)
imposition of strong, [human-community-based management]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} the ocean commons geared to [sustainability]{.mark}; (13)
institution of dramatic new measures to protect endangered species; (14)
strict limits imposed on excessive and destructive consumer marketing by
corporations; (15) reorganization of production to break down current
commodity chains geared to rapacious accumulation and the philosophy
of après moi le déluge; and (16) the [development of more rational,
equitable, less wasteful, and more collective forms of
production]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Priority in such an eco-revolution would need to be given to the fastest
imaginable elimination of fossil fuel emissions, but this would in turn
require fundamental changes in the human relationship to the earth and
in the relationship of human beings to each other. A new emphasis would
have to be placed on sustainable human development and the creation of
an organic system of social metabolic reproduction. [[Centuries
of]{.mark} [exploitation]{.mark} and expropriation, including divisions
on the basis of class, gender, race, and ethnicity, [would have to be
transcended]{.mark}. The historical logic posed by [current
conditions]{.mark} thus [points]{.mark} [to the necessity]{.mark} [of
a]{.mark} long ecological [revolution]{.mark}, putting into place a new
system of sustainable human development aimed at addressing the totality
of needs of human beings as both natural and social beings: what is now
called ecosocialism.]{.underline}

Explicitly or implicitly, [contemporary **[political
thought]{.mark}**]{.underline} often [[returns to the **trope** of the
**ship of state**]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is true also about popular
culture, where we often hear about leaders 'navigating' their
constituencies through political 'storms'. Today, that analogy often
appears in one of the two updated versions. One was advanced, for
example, by historian Dipesh Chakrabarty already in his 2009 essay The
Climate of History: Four Theses. 105 [The]{.underline} basic
**[point]{.underline}** [is that we are all **similarly
subject**]{.underline} [to the threat of **climate change**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} therefore, **[politically]{.underline}**, [we
are]{.underline} all [in the **same boat**]{.underline}. In
Chakrabarty's words106:

[[Climate change]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[refracted]{.underline}**
[through]{.underline} **[global capital]{.underline}**,
[[will]{.underline}]{.mark} no doubt
**[[accentuate]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the **logic** of]{.underline}
[**[inequality]{.underline}** [that runs through]{.underline}]{.mark}
[the **[rule of capital]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [[some]{.mark}
people]{.underline} will no doubt **[[gain]{.underline}]{.mark}**
temporarily [[at the **expense of others**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[But
the]{.mark} **whole crisis**]{.underline} [cannot be
**reduced**]{.underline} [to a story of **capitalism**]{.underline}.
Unlike in the crises of capitalism, there are no lifeboats here for the
rich and the privileged (witness the drought in Australia or recent
fires in the wealthy neighborhoods of California).

In other words, [there is something **special**]{.underline} [about the
**[climate crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline}. To be sure, [it [is not
simply]{.mark}]{.underline} [an]{.underline}
**[[economic]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[or]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[technological]{.underline}]{.mark}** [crisis]{.underline}, as some
commentators tend to think.107 As emphasized above, the climate crisis
is deeply rooted in the history of global capitalism. But
**[unlike]{.underline}** [other crises of capitalism]{.underline}, which
tend to generate the exploitation of labour and disproportionately harm
the poor, [[this]{.mark} crisis [is]{.mark}]{.underline}
[more]{.underline} **[[equally distributed]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[and]{.underline} is in fact **[ubiquitous]{.underline}**. [[It]{.mark}
therefore [puts us]{.mark} all [in the]{.mark} **same
boat**]{.underline}, which -- following Linebaugh and Rediker -- we can
call [the **['commonist lifeboat']{.mark}**]{.underline}. I suggest this
term to [highlight [an **emancipatory**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[egalitarian]{.underline}** aspect of the
**[[maritime commons]{.underline}]{.mark}** which they help us highlight
in their work on piracy.

[The second]{.underline} boat **[analogy]{.underline}** for contemporary
politics, [also]{.underline} very often invoked or **[implicitly
assumed]{.underline}**, [is that of [the **armed
lifeboat**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In his 2016 book The Great Derangement
Amitav Ghosh analyses the 'politics of the armed lifeboat'. 108
[The]{.underline} image of the [armed lifeboat [evokes a world
of]{.mark}]{.underline} multiple **[[climate
crises]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[rising sea
levels]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In this world, [[each nation
is]{.underline}]{.mark} like an armed raft, **[seeking to
float]{.underline}** [but **[aggressive]{.mark}** towards
others]{.underline}, shooting down anything that can add extra weight.
In Ghosh's 2019 novel, Gun Island, [it becomes ever clear]{.underline}er
[that [the figure of the **migrant vessel**]{.mark}]{.underline} [at sea
[is]{.mark} that [of]{.mark} such **[extra
weight]{.mark}**]{.underline}.109 [It is our **contemporary image** of
the **Zong**]{.underline}, in Turner's famous rendition: [unwanted Black
men were thrown overboard for insurance claims against the lost
cargo]{.underline}.110 For Ghosh, [the Zong is
**reenacted**]{.underline} [in]{.underline} contemporary **[migrant
drownings]{.underline}** off the Italian coast. As he points out, many
more of these than we realize are, in fact, climate migrants
(particularly from Ghosh's homeland of the Bay of Bengal).

[But [the **ocean**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**[central]{.underline}** [to the]{.underline}]{.mark} [image of the
**[commonist lifeboat]{.mark}**]{.underline} [beyond]{.underline}
questions of [migration]{.underline} (which are doubtless central both
to the commonist boat and to the armed lifeboat).
[[Consider]{.underline}]{.mark}, for example, the emergence of
**[[desalination]{.underline}]{.mark}** technologies in the context of
the climate crisis.111 Desalination is perhaps [the most
**extreme**]{.underline} and illustrative **[example]{.underline}** [of
**[commodifying seawater]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[and
**transforming**]{.underline} [it into something that is **intimately
our own**]{.underline}]{.mark}, drinking water that sustains our bodies.
[[But]{.underline}]{.mark} [as]{.underline} [[desal]{.mark}ination
remains **expensive**]{.underline}, and
**[[consumes]{.underline}]{.mark}** abundant **[energy]{.underline}**
often [dependent on **[fossil fuels]{.mark}**]{.underline}, fundamental
questions have been raised about its value as a climate adaptation
strategy.112 [Desalinated water]{.underline} may [[help nations float as
**armed lifeboats**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[These]{.underline} two [images of boats]{.underline} are central to the
task of developing a contemporary theory of political action. They [are
**countervailing metaphors**]{.underline}, each encapsulating certain
existing patterns of political action. [As such, they may help us
**better imagine**]{.underline} and articulate [what **options**
we]{.underline} may [have for **action**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
for [our]{.underline} present and **[future]{.underline}** [of
**continuously unfolding climate disasters**]{.underline}. In the
analysis of the ship of state simile above, I noted that a reading
exclusively centred on Plato's realm of ideals, may amount to an evasion
of embodied experience. The images of the armed and commonist lifeboats
may thus be objected to on the same basis: they are idealized
abstractions that do not fully capture or represent any concrete pattern
of politics. Such an objection, however, would not be entirely fair.
Rather than a philosophical account of truth beyond observable
experience, these two vessels aim to capture general categories in
observable experience. They are more in the tradition of ideal types
than along the lines of Plato's understanding of ideals.113

Coming from an international law background, it is tempting to
characterize these two figures of vessels as representing two familiar
bases for legal argumentation: sovereignty and universal principles.
Indeed, it may be that some contemporary invocations of the ship of
state metaphor are intended to advance sovereignty-based or universally
oriented arguments. But [these two images of vessels should **not** be
understood as a universalist boat for humanity and an 'armed lifeboat'
for domestic nationalism]{.underline}. In light of the longer view of
law and politics from the sea, [we should **read them** as **two
transnational options**]{.underline}. Indeed, [each corresponds to a
**different possibility** of **transnational politics**]{.underline}: [a
different **understanding**]{.underline} [of the]{.underline} space of
the **[commons]{.underline}** [and its **elimination**]{.underline},
[and a different **imagination** of the **pirate ship**]{.underline}.
The maritime perspective is transnational 'all the way down', meaning
that we are always-already in a transnational condition.

As others have pointed out, [the **[defensive
nationalism]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[reflected in the]{.mark}
**politics** of the **[armed lifeboat]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} never really projected from the confines of a
closed or unitary sovereign entity. Just like empire at its time,
**[[white nationalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** [directed at
migrants]{.underline} is thoroughly transnational and interconnected
across borders. Whether reflected in fantasies of 'replacement', 114 or
in the actions of private volunteer groups travelling to enforce
borders,115 exclusionary politics do not remain in the boundaries of
territorial sovereignty.116 The armed lifeboat corresponds to the image
of the pirate ship painted first by Schmitt and more recently by Benton.
Just like the pirates described by the two, [[today's actors]{.mark}
seeking to **protect** and]{.underline} [**[enrich]{.underline}** [the
**few**]{.underline} [in expense of the **many**]{.underline} [and the
**environment**]{.underline}]{.mark} [depend on **networks** of public
and private authorities]{.underline}. [[The **armed lifeboat**]{.mark}
is in service of forces that want to **[use
nature]{.mark}**]{.underline}, now
**[[commodified]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[and]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**[subjected]{.underline}** [to **human
rendition**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[to **save some** and **drown
others**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Similarly, the commonist lifeboat is also not available for us in any
truly universal or international way. **[[Law]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[politics]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[from
the sea]{.mark} [teach us that]{.mark} **any basis**]{.underline} we may
have [for **solidarity**]{.underline} [has to be anchored in
**[bottom-up transnationalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Contrary to the
armed lifeboat, **this transnationalism** harks back to the **image of
piracy**]{.underline} that Rediker and Linebaugh offer.117 [In this line
of analysis, **transnationalism** [means sharing **multiple racial
affinities** **without eliminating difference**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Beyond any soft vision of multiculturalism, [it]{.underline}
[reflects]{.underline} and attempts to articulate **[[cosmopolitanism
'from below']{.underline}]{.mark}**. 118

[[The law of the sea **used** to create a framework of **mutual
solidarity**]{.underline}]{.mark} among the world's seafarers, all
exposed to sudden storms and unforeseen weather damage in the maritime
space. [[What enabled **rival powers**]{.underline} [to **come
together**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and **formulate rules**]{.underline}
for mutual assistance between their ships [[was]{.mark} [a]{.mark}
**[common external enemy]{.mark}**]{.underline} [--
**[nature]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Conditions **today** are
**different**]{.underline}]{.mark}.119 And yet, the element of maritime
commons necessary for human survival can be seized upon from the
historical examples discussed above, and reapplied today in multiple
forms.

To reiterate, most actual ships are much less vulnerable to extreme
weather events. In that regard, maritime travel and human survival seem
decoupled. But as was the case for Grotius, the link between the two is
deeper and vaster that the mere reference to a legal doctrine of rescue
at sea. [You need ships to get your garments from China. But for a long
time they have been stuck, not because of any natural cause but due to
the ways in which **globalized trade** became **interconnected** with
the spread of a global pandemic.]{.underline} [People]{.underline}
across the world **[need ships]{.underline}** to get their grain. [But
they are **stuck**]{.underline}, not due to nature, but [due to war
fueled by **dependencies on natural gas**]{.underline}.120 [The threat
of **survival**]{.underline} at the background of all these crises,
namely the climate crisis, [does not come from the
**outside**]{.underline}. It is a direct result of the actions of all
the developed countries -- production, but also transportation of
course. The sea is our mirror.

The task facing us today is to take advantage of the distinct legal and
political perspective the sea presents to us in order to open up
opportunities for transnational solidarity. We might learn something
from the pirates, who applied, for the first time and most acutely, the
maritime perspective as a methodology. Presumably [[we
cannot]{.underline}]{.mark}, nor should we, **[[completely
disengage]{.underline}]{.mark}** [from the territorial perspective
available]{.underline} when standing on firm land. [But is it not
possible]{.underline}, as with Schmitt's buccaneering British Empire and
with the displaced commoners and slaves, [to utilize the
now-**internalized**]{.underline} **[exteriority]{.underline}** **[of
the maritime perspective in our favour]{.underline}**?

[If **[maritime trade]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[has]{.underline}]{.mark}
indeed [[culminated in the final **unification** of **global
space**]{.underline}]{.mark}, as per Schmitt, [the question is how this
unification can serve **[global solidarity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. How
can the maritime space [[enable mitigation of the]{.underline}]{.mark}
disastrous effects of the **[[climate threat]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[[while]{.underline}]{.mark} hopefully **[[dismantling exploitative
power dynamics]{.underline}]{.mark}** that lead to the sacrifice, now or
in the near future, of large parts of humanity?

Perhaps the best-known example of this kind of action relates to the
movement of migrants and refugees, many of whom have been uprooted due
to circumstances caused by the climate crisis.121 When asylum seekers
move across the sea to a new country, they try to help themselves.122
But they also rely on the legal assumption of unrestricted movement at
sea; and they further depend on the duty of rescue at sea, also part of
Grotius's old legacy. Writing about the duty of rescue, Grotius thought
of merchants in need of assistance during a storm.123 Today, however,
refugees and migrants trigger these duties with their bodies for other
objectives: to protect themselves from a life that may not be worth
living (including due to climate-related degradation). Groups of
rescuers and volunteers moving across the Mediterranean Sea to extend a
helping hand also frequently make use of laws that were enacted in an
era of maritime exteriority.124 They carefully choose flags with a view
to the unique system of authorities created at sea.125 They rely on
rules that were created to allow unrestricted movement for merchants and
colonialists.126

[[The **law of the sea**]{.underline}]{.mark} now [[opens]{.mark} up a
[potential for **new**]{.mark} **forms of
[solidarity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Frédéric Mégret writes about
solidarity [with **[refugees]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [but
also]{.underline} underscores how [the **maritime space**
enabled]{.underline} **[new]{.underline}** forms of
**[action]{.underline}** [for **[Greenpeace
activists]{.mark}**]{.underline} who sail the seas to protect the sea
and sea life; [and]{.underline} also, how the **[[feminist]{.mark}
group]{.underline}** Women on Waves took to sea in order [to operate
**exterritorial abortion clinics** off the coasts of countries that
prohibit abortion]{.underline}.127 [[These]{.underline}
[are]{.underline}]{.mark} all examples of commonist boats. They are
**[[not premised]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[on]{.mark} **[waiting
for]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[a]{.underline}]{.mark}n international or
**[[federalist government]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[that]{.mark} might
[bring]{.mark} **[incremental positive change]{.mark}**]{.underline}
through democratic process. [[They are premised on **doing what we
can**]{.mark} **do [now]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [moving [through the
**cracks** of **transnationalism**]{.mark}]{.underline} [to stake a
position that is **always between statism and
universalism**]{.underline}, but never firmly situated in either one.

[Some may **dismiss** this]{.underline} reference to commoner pirates
[as]{.underline} a form of **[romanticism]{.underline}**, just like
Benton does in the context of her historical work. I can only go back to
Sayyida al Hurra and Samuel Pallache, to say that **[[revolutionary
maritime politics]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[does not]{.mark} have to
**cut ties**]{.underline} from all powerful political interests [at all
times]{.underline}. This is [not]{.underline} a call [to **[exit
politics]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[but an attempt to]{.mark}
**characterize a particular kind of channel into it**]{.underline}.

All [these **actors**]{.underline}, **[migrants]{.underline}**,
[environmental **activists**]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} seaborne
**[feminists]{.underline}**, [tell us something **simple**]{.underline}:
[in the face of the **current crisis**]{.underline}, [there is a need to
**[rethink]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} basic,
[**[legal]{.underline}**,]{.mark} **[[economic]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[political]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[categories]{.underline} [of]{.underline}]{.mark} [our **[shared
living]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Moreover, there is a need to take
advantage of opportunities for action inherent in transnational
ambiguities. Perhaps it is no coincidence that political parties
experimenting with new forms of democratization have frequently returned
to the Jolly Roger.128 If we can benefit from the shifted perspective
created by the law of the sea, as pirates and slaves did, [the
**sea**]{.underline} may [provide us with new opportunities for
action]{.underline}.

Conclusion

As lawyers, [[we]{.mark} [are]{.mark}]{.underline} often
**[[accustomed]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to]{.mark} **'[seeing like a
state]{.mark}'**]{.underline}. 129 [But the **truth**]{.underline}
[is]{.underline} [we]{.underline} **[actually see]{.underline}** [is
like a **maritime vessel**]{.underline}. In this essay, I hoped to show
[[by way of]{.mark} the **[maritime perspective]{.mark}**]{.underline} I
developed, that [**[seeing like a state]{.underline}**
[is]{.underline}]{.mark} [engaging in an exercise of
**[make-believe]{.mark}**]{.underline}, in good or bad faith. [We do not
have a **truly domestic**]{.underline} [or]{.underline}
**[international]{.underline}** [vantage point]{.underline} think from,
[nor can we rely on 'methodological nationalism' as a basis for
action]{.underline}.130 [Those are **[unavailable
abstractions]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[that]{.underline}]{.mark} may be
occasionally useful, but [[do not rely on **accurate descriptions of
politics**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Oceanic
methodology]{.underline}]{.mark} may [help us [start]{.mark} **legal**
and **political studies**]{.underline} [[from a]{.mark} [more]{.mark}
**[appropriate set of assumptions]{.mark}**]{.underline} [which is
thoro**ughly transnational**]{.underline}. Analytically, [[transnational
existence]{.underline} **[precedes]{.underline}** [the **domestic
vantage point**]{.underline} [that]{.underline}]{.mark} still
**[[dominates]{.underline}]{.mark}** a lot of [legal and [political
thought]{.mark}]{.underline} (even purportedly transnational
approaches). International and [**[inter-state]{.underline}**
**[conceptions]{.underline}**]{.mark} [of]{.underline}
**[law]{.underline}** [[only come **after** transnational]{.mark} legal
[experience]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The **question**]{.underline} [we confront is **[which transnationalism
do we adopt]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [I suggest adopting [the]{.mark}
**[imagination]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of]{.mark} [a]{.mark}

But [[capitalism's]{.underline} global nature [means that
revolts]{.underline} tend to spread across national borders.
[Workers]{.underline}]{.mark} [today [share]{.mark} increasingly
[similar experiences]{.mark}]{.underline}: conditions of work, forms of
consumption, lifestyles and political cultures. [And the global
integration of production serves to transmit struggle from one country
to another]{.underline}. In 1974, for instance, resistance to the brutal
military dictatorship in Chile spread to East Kilbride, Scotland, of all
places. Workers at the Rolls Royce factory there learned that the
engines they were repairing were being used by the Chilean air force to
drop bombs on workers resisting the coup. They downed tools and refused
to work on the engines, keeping them out of the hands of the military
junta for four years.

While nationalism still has a powerful hold on the consciousness of
many, it's increasingly clear that [the real line of
[polarisation]{.mark} across the globe [is between the minority ruling
class and the majority working class]{.mark}]{.underline}. [And when
revolts break out in one part of the world, people can identify with the
causes and motivations of their struggles]{.underline}, and draw
comparisons with their own situation. "Languages remain different,"
observed UK Marxist Chris Harman in 1992, "but what they say is
increasingly the same". Harman's words ring true in every wave of
political radicalisation.

1968 is remembered as a year of global revolt, when millions of workers,
students and oppressed people drew inspiration from each other's
movements. Activists in the US were radicalised by the heroic resistance
of the Vietnamese people to American imperialism. Irish civil rights
activists emulated the militant politics of the Black Panthers. When
students and workers united to launch a massive general strike in France
in May, it taught student radicals in Australia that they needed to link
up with the power of the organised working class in order to win.

The movements of 1968 united people across superficially very different
societies. For decades, Cold War common sense had dictated that the
greatest divide on the planet was between Western liberal capitalism and
Stalinist "Communism". But in 1968, both sides of the iron curtain
exploded in revolt. The triggers for the struggles may have been
different, but they were all responses to similar issues: inequality,
exploitation and war, imposed by monstrous bureaucratic states.

[In [2011, a poor Tunisian street vendor set himself alight to protest
against police harassment]{.mark}]{.underline}. Within days, [his act
had inspired anti-government protests across the country]{.underline}.
Within weeks, [the [protests escalated into a
]{.mark}]{.underline}[regional revolt]{.mark} [that challenged regimes
[across the Arab world]{.mark}]{.underline}. [One small act tapped into
resentment]{.underline} against inequality, unemployment and state
violence [that engulfed an entire region]{.underline}. The radical wave
spread even further: at a massive demonstration against an anti-union
bill in the US city of Madison, Wisconsin, a man held up a poster with a
picture of Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak beside Republican Governor
Scott Walker. The caption read: "One dictator down. One to go". [The
[Arab revolutions went on to inspire]{.mark} the [Occupy
movement]{.mark}, which [spread to]{.mark} more than]{.underline} [80
countries]{.mark}.

[Today, more than ever]{.mark}[, insurgent social [movements]{.mark} and
working-class uprisings [are spurring action in other parts of the
world]{.mark}]{.underline}---from Hong Kong to Chile, from Lebanon to
France. One placard at a memorial for protesters murdered while
resisting the military coup in Myanmar took up Marx's incitement:
"Workers of the world unite, you have nothing to lose but your chains".

While [the [Russian Revolution]{.mark}]{.underline} is cynically held up
by capitalist ideologists as the ultimate argument against international
revolution, it [actually]{.underline} proves the opposite. It [shows
that the goal is not only necessary, but also that it's
possible]{.underline}. The news of workers seizing power in Russia,
overthrowing their capitalist government and declaring their withdrawal
from WWI, [[created shock waves]{.underline} across the planet]{.mark}.
[[Workers in Germany rose]{.mark} in revolt [a year
later]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} ending the war for good and
building soviets, a form of radical working-class democracy inspired by
the Russian example. [[This was followed by uprisings in France, Italy
and Hungary]{.underline}.]{.mark}

[The revolutionary wave spread further]{.underline}. A classified
British government report from 1919 noted a "very widespread feeling
among workers that thrones have become anachronisms, and that the Soviet
may be the best form of Government for a democracy".

The rising tide of radicalism had an impact in Australia too.
Meatworkers in the Queensland city of Townsville donned red jumpers,
stormed the local police station to free jailed unionists, and placed
the city under workers' control. The editor of the conservative
Townsville Daily Bulletin lamented: "Townsville for the last year or so
has been developing Bolshevism \... the mob management of affairs in
this city, differs very little, from the Petrograd and Moscow brand".

[The Russian [Bolsheviks]{.mark}]{.underline}, the revolutionary
working-class party that led the revolution to victory in 1917, [[didn't
just passively wait for revolutions elsewhere]{.underline}. [They
actively organised to spread the revolt]{.underline}]{.mark}. In 1919,
[they [established the Communist International]{.mark}]{.underline}, an
organisation for debate, discussion and coordination between different
revolutionary workers' parties. Revolutionaries in Russia, Italy,
France, Germany, the US, Australia and elsewhere attempted to clarify
and develop a strategy for overthrowing capitalism everywhere. In none
of these countries was there a party like the Bolsheviks, steeled in
years of organising working-class struggle to overthrow the state, and
capable of leading a revolution. But [for a number of years, workers
came close to overthrowing capitalism in several countries.]{.underline}

[[In periods of stability]{.underline}]{.mark}, when social conservatism
dominates, [[international revolution can seem like a pipe
dream]{.underline}. Defenders of the status quo actively work to
reinforce this illusion. [But history proves that]{.underline}
]{.mark}[the]{.underline} [crises]{.mark} [that the system generates are
international, and that they will]{.underline} [inevitably provoke
international resistance]{.mark}.

[Capitalism]{.underline} is a global system. It requires a global
movement to tear it up, root and branch. But it also [makes global
revolution more possible, and more likely. [The most important thing
that socialists can do]{.mark}]{.underline}, whether you live in Hong
Kong or France, Myanmar or Australia, [[is to get]{.underline}]{.mark}
stuck [[into]{.underline} organising for it today]{.mark}.

Legal imagination -- polar and otherwise -- is rather poor. It follows
the doctrines of international law which transpose state sovereign
concerns onto the international stage. As the multiple planetary crises
unfold, international law has proven unable to find adequate solutions.
In a field only responsive to crises,1) the overlapping and
interconnected planetary crises of our times might have become out of
touch. In this context, our article asks whether there is still space
for legal imagination within the field of polar law. We argue that to
come to terms with current planetary politics in the polar regions,
there is a need to re-examine the constellations of legal norms relevant
to regional governance (i.e., polar law as a normative field) and
academic discourse (i.e., polar law as an epistemic field) to assess
where they fail to answer the concerns of our times and how we, as the
community of "polar practitioners," and "polar legal scholars" find
space to speculate and expand polar legal imagination to more adequately
account for planetary governance. To open up legal imagination in this
context can materialise through a multitude of different epistemic and
normative interventions. [For instance, [a **complete
reimagination**]{.mark} of what we consider "good" "governance" for the
poles could mean to think about how normative thought and practice
account for the **myriads of more-than-human modes of existence** in the
region, **[challenge traditional hierarchical relationships]{.mark}**
between sovereign states and diverse entities, both living and
non-living and propose new modes of thinking with and **[against
normativity]{.mark}** for and in the Arctic.]{.underline}

One way we have tried to open up the space for thinking along
theoretical and material critiques of polar law and building on
experiences from three years of engagement between polar lawyers and the
Critical Legal Conference (CLC), we discuss potential alternatives to
law's interaction with Arctic existence and agency beyond conventional
state-centric legalities. [[The]{.mark}se [alt]{.mark}ernatives [force
us to acknowledge the Arctic]{.mark}(s) and the polar regions [as
non-fixed and dynamic spaces where sovereignty, legality, and
normativity are **fluid**]{.mark} **and mutable**. To conclude we argue
that thinking on speculative registers can help to **[reassemble legal
sovereignty constructs]{.mark}** in response to the poles' changing
landscapes. Expanding Arctic legal imagination to the confines of the
Earth provides an aperture to **[articulate new forms of
coexistence]{.mark}** and justice [to **pave the way for legal theory**
and]{.mark} practice to [account for]{.mark} **molecular-[planetary
concerns]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[To find out whether there is room -- at all -- for legal imagination
within the field, it is necessary to **go back to the history of polar
law** as a normative field. A history or official hagiography of polar
law is not difficult to do as it follows the lines of international and
domestic laws' evolutions for and in the poles. However, much like any
other field of international law, the historical **[principles behind
polar law are rooted in questions of sovereignty]{.mark},2) dominion,3)
colonialism,4) (over)[exploitation of natural resources]{.mark},5)
enclosure** (which is arguably linked to colonialism), and exclusion of
people (mainly in the Arctic -- again linked to the region's colonial
past and present) **and environment**]{.underline}. Again, and without
much surprise, these reflect the Arctic littoral states' modes of
governance. These frameworks have primarily been focused on the
management of polar spaces through the lens of national interests, often
prioritising and enabling states' interests of power projections,
control, and economic interests.

[In this context, [polar law has been **a**]{.mark} **reactive
[tool]{.mark}** for managing resources and delineating geopolitical
boundaries -- **[reflecting]{.mark} a certain [capitalist mode]{.mark}**
of "seeing like a state"6) through which states' managerial processes of
geographical enclosure and control [as well as]{.mark} the exploitation
of all living and non-living entities for the **[accumulation of
wealth]{.mark} become an ontological practice** to stabilise state
sovereignty both globally and domestically.]{.underline} And although
law relevant to the polar regions has since evolved (albeit slightly),
these state logics remain what ontologically frame the production of
legal norms in the region. However, as we all know, the challenges
facing the poles go far beyond the traditional states' modes of
existence. Polar geopolitics and governance is driven by ontological
framings of the regions as the terrain of states and for states -- be
them Arctic or non-Arctic.7) The multiple ecological crises unfolding in
these regions and beyond pose legal and ethical questions that cannot be
addressed by existing frameworks alone. In that regard, and as we have
said before, law -- polar and otherwise -- fails us.8) So why should we
even try to save it?

At times when there are failures of law, where the legal practice has
difficulty catching up with the factual reality, lawyers have
historically engaged in, what could be loosely termed, exercises of
legal imagination. For instance, as Koskenniemi outlines, the founding
figures of international law -- French, Spanish, British, German and so
on -- engaged in legal imagination to shape the making of international
norms and principles to transpose their own visions and understandings
of governance onto the international stage -- again as a means of
projecting their own vision of what ought to be. So at historical
junctures, these legal technicians (i.e., European lawyers) mapped their
ideal governance future with the modalities of their legal times. In
that context, they used everything at hand (e.g., theology, roman law,
raison d'état, politics, even natural science, physics and biology) as
novel frames to imagine and argue differently.9) "Legal imagining is
both specific to the time and place where it takes place and continuous
with imagining that has taken place and will occur in different places
and at different times."10) Yet, these historical modalities inherently
guide contemporary imagination through a framework of objectivity,
neutrality, and universality in legal discourse, elements that can be
traced back to international law's very inception. In other words,
international law, including polar law, continues to be influenced by a
"deeply rooted" mindset that often overlooks the dynamics of power, the
constraints on potential legal interpretations, and the universalization
of a 'particular' approach of legal speculation that reflects the
imagination of 17th and 18th century Western masculinist lawyers as well
as their own imperial and colonial projects.

Historicizing the values underpinning polar law by dismissing them as
mere 'standards of the past' in academic discourse overlooks their
ongoing influence in the 'present'. Polar law is 'present' and is far
from flawless. This stance consequently neglects the intricate and often
overt connections between modern legal knowledge and various forms of
power, including those based on race,11) class,12) and gender.13) Such
legal knowledge mirrors the cultural values associated with modernity.
It is evident in the Arctic through a range of daily challenges faced by
the region, impacting the material world, biodiversity, Indigenous
populations, and the broader future of the planet. It signifies the
outcomes of a pervasive power structure that has consistently
accompanied international law that transcends the legal orders of the
polar regions.

As outlined in the introduction, law is typically a reactive discipline;
it responds to crises, disputes, or the needs of states. This is where
speculation comes into play, but how do we speculate (as a practice)
with a focus on the polar regions? [[Speculative]{.mark} legal [praxis
invites us to]{.mark} **proactively [imagine alt]{.mark}ernative
[futures]{.mark}.** This is not just about responding to immediate
threats to the polar environments (environmental law has not managed to
do that in a century of normative developments); it is about
**[rethinking the legal frameworks themselves, questioning their
assumptions, and envisioning new possibilities]{.mark}** for polar law.
One way of doing speculation is through the concept of prefiguration, as
a means of imagining the future we want.]{.underline} In that sense,
prefiguration allows us to move beyond the confines of existing legal
systems and ask fundamental questions: what is the future of the polar
regions we want? And how do we transpose this vision of the future into
a normative endeavour? Just as the poles are transforming as a result of
the climate and environmental crises, so too must our legal concepts
become more fluid, adaptive, and interconnected[. [Traditional
categories]{.mark} like sovereignty, legality, and normativity, which
have historically been fixed and stable, [are]{.mark} now being
**[challenged by ecological instability]{.mark}**. This [demands]{.mark}
that we **[move away from static legal systems]{.mark}** towards more
adaptive legal orders, ones that can respond to molecular-planetary
concerns and ecological limits.]{.underline}

Speculative thinking is not simply a means to escape from the present.
It is a political praxis to reimagine and reconstruct legal knowledge
that can respond to the complex, entangled realities of the polar
regions. [It allows us [to **think beyond**]{.mark} the [binaries of
state]{.mark} vs. non-state actors, human vs. non-human interests, and
utilitarian resource extraction vs. environmental
protection.]{.underline} [Instead, it invites us [to]{.mark} [consider
a]{.mark} **normative [system]{.mark} that [respects Indigenous
knowledge, non-human sovereignties, and the interdependence of all life
forms]{.mark}** within these fragile ecosystems. For us, to think of
polar law on a speculative register means not just imagining future
scenarios and arguments for legal governance but an overall rethinking
of our way of polar governance itself. Speculation, in this sense, is
not just about [creating]{.mark} fictitious futures but [an **active,
creative and critical process of prefiguration**]{.mark}, as a means to
envision the kind of polar governance we want to see in the future as
both a normative and a political resituating exercise. If prefiguration
becomes a political and normative praxis, then speculative academia
becomes the venue for scholars to politicise.]{.underline}

Using prefiguration as a point of analytical departure, we asked
ourselves what is the kind of future that we want to have in the polar
regions? Polar Law, as a subset of international law, is an artefact
deeply embedded within the sociocultural paradigm of modernity and is
inevitably infected with the methodologies and ideologies of this
paradigm. The field of Polar Law as an academic discipline is riddled
with doctrinal and formalist approaches to the Arctic and Antarctic
legal issues. As international law researchers, we are often trained to
look for gaps in our polar legal realities to heal (de lege ferenda),
with almost messianic ambitions, the ills of our global collective
social and environmental factual realities. Polar law is no exception,
and black-letter methodologies abound. Even scholars whose research
involves environmental law, decolonisation or people liberation
movements, whose themes are perhaps more synonymous with a broad
understanding of 'justice', often frame their arguments through a
doctrinal lens to gain legitimacy.

As we aim to reimagine polar law in ways that are not limited to state
modes of existence but include humans and more-than-human entities alike
in this process, since August 2022 we have opened the register of
speculation to what we term a 'critical turn' to polar law. In doing so,
we contented that it was perhaps time to think of 'Critical Polar
Jurisprudence.' In this context, we have been convening two streams
annually at both the Polar Law Symposium14) and the Critical Legal
Conference (CLC). The Polar Law Symposium gathers researchers from
around the globe on an annual basis, providing a platform for the
exchange of research-based scientific knowledge on a variety of issues
pertinent to polar regions. Conversely, the CLC, which has been a
pivotal gathering since its inception in 1986, serves as a critical
venue for examining legal and political issues, through a vast array of
theoretical approaches. That said, the Critical Polar Law initiative has
emerged to bring these two together, reevaluate the assumptions commonly
held about the polar regions and to address emerging issues in polar law
through the lens of critical jurisprudence. [It aims [to **deconstruct
existing legal realities**]{.mark}, such as the premise of conceptual
**superiority of state sovereignty** and its role as the moulder of law
and life in the polar regions.]{.underline}

[Our way [to speculate and prefigure]{.mark} the future of polar law was
[to **engage on several topics**]{.mark} **from a more theoretical
perspective [with justice at the centre]{.mark}**. While theories of
justice have have recently been advanced for Arctic governance,15) thus
far our theoretical endeavours have focused on broadening this
conversation not to focus neither governance nor on the poles
specifically. In an age where planetary politics are being reassembled,
we thought it was worth addressing what lies beyond. We therefore chose
**["theorising" as a means of prefiguration]{.mark}** and practice to
assess why the polar regions can be a site of theoretical inquiries.
Along the way, we articulated thoughts around **[alternative theoretical
reassessments of polar law]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[First, we advance the term Hyperborean Legalities [to
"**summon**]{.mark} **dreamy visions of [an alternative legal imaginary
for]{.mark} the world's northernmost region**" and to analyse [the
Arctic as a **liminal space**]{.mark}, one that exists **[beyond legal
dogmatic approaches]{.mark}**. Conceptually, Hyperborean Legalities
allowed us [to **challenge the superiority of state
sovereignty**]{.mark} and its role as the moulder of law and life in the
region. The idea is [to challenge]{.mark} both the way the poles are
often imagined as empty, frozen, dark lands, and think alongside the
different shapes, forms, and **sources of [normativity]{.mark}/ies [in
the regions]{.mark}**.16)]{.underline}

Second, and building on the Hyperborea, we analysed how the poles are
portrayed as "common refuge", and "areas beyond sovereignty," yet also
as spaces where state sovereignty/ies are often ontologically reinforced
as a tool of exclusion. In this context, in mainstream legal
imagination, they become "quasi-frozen sanctuaries" where law freezes
yet governance thrives. In these perceived liminal regions with complex
legal, environmental, and social dynamics, challenging dominant
governance structures and traditional norms. These regions, with their
shifting cryospheric landscapes,17) serve as sanctuaries that bring to
light the urgent need to address climate change and reconsider the
relationship between humans and marine spaces. However, another
narrative can be storied; one where the fluidity, materiality, and
disappearance of ice18) can be thought of as a "sanctuary" that invites
a rethinking of environmental protection, legal frameworks, and the
struggle against territorial enclosures in a destabilised planetary
context. [To come back to prefiguration, [water]{.mark} in a frozen
state [can become a **source of law**]{.mark}**.** Its disappearance and
the longing for the cold help speculate a **normative future** that
cares for the human and non-human modes of existence it supports.19)
This care is not merely a passive concern but an active relational
engagement, **[recognizing]{.mark} the [interconnectedness of human and
non-human]{.mark} entities**.20) Thinking about ice as a source of law
thus allows us to leave behind landlocked state-bound legal thinking,
**[transcend the constructed ontology]{.mark} of a land-sea dichotomy**,
and think fluidilly about oceanic spaces in all their passing and
temporal physical states.]{.underline}

Lastly, it is important to acknowledge that any political and
theoretical engagements with the governance of polar regions cannot be
detached from multiple unfolding planetary crises. The pitfall of
structuring the production of epistemic and normative knowledge around
delimited geographies is that it can lead to tunnel vision where one
becomes unable to see beyond regional impacts. Much like states, polar
geographies have been carefully constructed along sovereign lines.21) To
resist the ever-creeping might of sovereign powers, it is therefore
important to prefigure polar governance as planetary politics and part
of the Earth system. As such, polar governance needs to come to terms
that nothing is polar yet everything is. In Cirkovic's words, this calls
for a "new ontological understanding of the global politico-juridical
space" that "approximate the inclusion and representation of 'everything
considered to be non-human".22) In speculating polar legal imagination,
we therefore argue that the Arctic and Antarctic regions are not merely
as amalgamates of geographies subjected to climate change and
geopolitical contestations but as conceptual spaces where the
traditional notions of sovereignty, legality, and normativity are now
unfrozen and set adrift in the open sea of speculative jurisprudence.
[In this space, [speculation]{.mark} becomes a creative endeavour that
[seeks to **articulate**]{.mark}**, enact [visions of coexistence and
justice]{.mark}** that are attuned to the specificities of the polar
ecologies and histories [and **seek new paths for legal theory**]{.mark}
**and practice in a collective reimagining** of what law can and should
be in a broader planetary context.]{.underline}

[To conclude, the aim of this article is to show that
[prefigurating]{.mark} and speculating our collective normative futures
in the polar regions **[requires a commitment to]{.mark} facing
planetary politics**. The space is wide open for legal speculation in
polar law; not only as a means to **[rethinking legal norms]{.mark} and
epistemological practices** (although to some extent it is necessary)
but as a means to speculate the kind of future we truly want; identify
and create relationships [as a **community**]{.mark} **of planetary
care.**]{.underline} At the heart of prefiguration lies a (re)centring
of justice that is not enclosed and bound by state modes of existence.
Speculating for the polar oceans means turning our thinking both onto
microscopic and planetary concerns as part of relationalities and deep
entanglements. [In this context, speculating better and more just
futures for the polar regions potentially means not thinking about the
polar regions in isolation and as a one-fit-all discipline. It invites
**the need for polar law scholarship to embrace a myriad of
disciplines**.]{.underline} Next year, we hope to launch the Critical
Polar Jurisprudence (CPJ) initiative at both the annual Polar Law
Symposium and the Critical Legal Conference, respectively. We invite you
to join us in summoning visionary alternatives for the legal frameworks
governing the poles.

1.5 Critiques of Resilience Thinking

1.5.1 Overview

Beginning around 2010, scholars from multiple fields of nature-society
research began expressing concern about resilience thinking and the
politics it animates due to its incomplete grasp of social phenomenon
(e.g., Ahlborg & Nightingale, 2012; Nadasdy, 2007). In 2008 a high-level
report called "Re-framing Resilience" (Leach, 2008) articulated the
primary problems that social researchers were having with resilience
thinking, as well as the responses of prominent resilient thinkers to
those issues. New resilience journals have emerged to highlight the
shortcomings of earlier research approaches and to better address the
social dimensions of resilience (e.g., Resilience: International
Policies, Practices and Discourses). There have even been books written
with the sole goal of deconstructing the resilience 'doctrine' (Evans &
Reid, 2014). Many of these critiques are aimed at classical
social-ecological resilience thinking, which was described above.
However, critics have also targeted a second realm of resilience
thinking. The second realm views resilience not a systemic property, but
as a psychological trait that both individuals and communities can
possess, and that should be nurtured within communities in preparation
for experiencing natural disasters (e.g., Norris, Stevens, Pfefferbaum,
Wyche, & Pfefferbaum, 2008). Critiques continue to emerge from multiple
corners of the academy but can be organized into three main categories.

The first category is a specific example of the broader post-modern
critique of the claim of science to be objective and therefore be the
holder of Truth, with a capital T. Theories from intellectual realms
such feminism and the philosophy of science argue that no human endeavor
can be truly objective or free from value judgments since all thoughts
and actions are deeply enmeshed in historical trajectories that
presuppose particular ontological and epistemological positions at the
exclusion of others, and resilience thinking is no exception. Resilience
hails from discrete lineages of western natural science and computer
modeling that posit specific and contingent (although hegemonic)
worldviews. Criticisms show how the unquestioned culture of resilience
thinking has failed to recognize and reflect on its own positionality,
inherent normativity and accordant limitations (Cannon & Muller-Mahn,
2010; Cote & Nightingale, 2012; Kirchhoff, Brand, Hoheisel, & Grimm,
2010).

The second category is similar to the first, but instead of issuing the
criticism at the culture of resilience thinkers, per se, scholars have
pointed out that [**[resilience thinking]{.mark}** has historically
**[marginalize]{.mark}**d important [concepts from]{.mark} the social
sciences]{.underline} - [such as **[power]{.mark}**,
**[agency]{.mark}**, difference, [and]{.mark} the **validity** of
**[conflicting knowledge]{.mark}**]{.underline}([s]{.underline}) - [in
the subjects it studies]{.underline}. Turner (2014) points out,
"[resilience **[scholars]{.mark}**.. .have continued to [embrace
**systems**-**modeling**]{.mark}
perspectives]{.underline}\...\[[and]{.underline}\] as a result,
resilience adherents, when reaching out to the social sciences.. .[are
attracted to approaches such as ecological **economics** and
**rational**-**choice theory**]{.underline}" (p. 619). [[By privileging
**modeling**]{.mark} approaches to social research, [resilience]{.mark}
thinking has **[miss]{.mark}**ed [the **vast bodies** of]{.mark} work on
topics such as **[identity]{.mark}**, **[culture]{.mark}**, [and
**justice**]{.mark} in the **social sciences**]{.underline}. Hornborg
(2013) puts it succinctly: "[resilience [discourse]{.mark} generally
appears to be **[ignorant]{.mark}**]{.underline} of most [[of]{.mark}
the [**tenets** of **modern**]{.mark} social
**[science]{.mark}**]{.underline}" (p. 118).

1.5.2 Radical Political Economy Critiques

1.5.2.1 Background

The third category of critique, based in theories from radical political
economy, is the one I engage most centrally in this dissertation.
Radical political economy, in brief, is meant to mean the field of study
concerned with the [[social **inequities** and environmental
**harms**]{.mark} that are [**intrinsic** to]{.mark} the
**[capitalist]{.mark} mode** of **[production]{.mark}** and
**consumption**]{.underline}, and also concerned with the
justice-related benefits of doing things differently (Foster 1999, 2002;
Harvey, 1982, 1996; O'Connor, 1988; Smith, 1984; Wallerstein, 1979).
Often associated with the writings of Marx and Engels, the political
left, and socialism, radical political economy encompasses the work of a
broad range of theorists and activists, and their critics. Despite the
diversity in the field, [the central focus of [radical political
economy]{.mark} can be understood as [the **nexus** of economic
**relations**]{.mark}, **[social power]{.mark}**, [and
**nature**]{.mark}, as [viewed]{.mark} [through a lens that values
**collective responsibility**]{.mark}, a strong interpretation of
**equality**, and a **moral obligation** to the **other**]{.underline}.

Marx's theory of historical materialism (1867/1990) rests on the
observation that capitalist modes of production divide society into two
uneven classes, and the hypothesis that the 20 labor class (workers)
will revolt against the bourgeois class (owners) and cease the means of
production when their exploitation becomes intolerable. This dialectical
relationship, whereby capitalism contain the seed of its own
destruction, forms the first contradiction of capitalism. The second
contradiction of capitalism (see O'Connor, 1991) focuses centrally on
social-ecological relations (rather than relations between the classes),
positing that capitalism sows the seeds of its own destruction through
its fundamentally unsustainable relationship with nature, founded on
capitalism's imperative for unlimited growth (and unlimited consumption
of natural resources) in a limited world. Both contradictions are
explored further below.

In the beginning, according to Marx, there was primitive accumulation---
a notion that he himself equates to the original sin of capitalism in
Capital Volume I (1867/1990). Primitive accumulation is the process by
which social classes separated, with some individuals forcefully seizing
power over the means of production (natural resources and production
infrastructure) and other individuals thus being dispossessed from land
and capital. The dispossessed, stripped of the means to produce their
own subsistence, find themselves with only their labor to sell to the
capital class in exchange for the wages they need to live and to feed
their families. The capitalists, in turn, are able to sell the
commodities the laborers produce, pay the labors the minimum to survive
(i.e., social reproduction so that they can keep working), and still
extract a profit from the process. Marx calls this profit surplus value
and the process by which it is generated exploitation. Its maximization
is the basic tenant of capitalism. What happens to the humans involved,
however, is a profound alienation from themselves, society, and nature.
Peet, Robbins, and Watts (2011) describe the process: 21

> \[I\]ncreasing \[capitalist\] socialization binds workers into a more
> extensive labor process that they do not collectively
> control\...The\... labor process loses its inherent meaning as the
> social production of human existence.. .The result is a severing of
> relations: among workers, and between workers and capitalist owners of
> production systems; between the individual and its species being;
> between producers and their products; and between producers and the
> environment on which continued existence nevertheless depends (p. 13).

When workers do not control the products of their own labor and
capitalists are unrequired to contribute labor to their own survival,
everyone loses touch with the meaning of life, which can only be
realized, according to Marx, by working as a free person for the
survival of oneself and one's species (thus the mention of species
being).

Humans' ontological status as a communal species being is replaced in
capitalist social relations by, "competitive individuals each pursing
self-interested goals" (Peet et al., 2011, p. 14). The competitive
selfishness of capitalism, "becomes an alienated force controlling
individuals rather than being controlled by them, so they are forced by
competition to do things they already know to be socially and
environmentally destructive," (p. 14) according to Peet et al. (2011).
Supporters of capitalism leave such externalities as social and
environmental damage to the logic of the market to sort out with price
signals being the guide, but, as Peet et al. (2011) write, "Market
prices do not represent social and environmental costs and long-term
consequences at all," and "As a result, market systems are
environmentally destructive and socially irresponsible" (p. 14). A
contention that is clearly backed up by the state of affairs today by,
for example, cheap oil and its ecological and social tolls. Referencing
the "energy-intensive, 22 mechanized, resource-eating, polluting"
history of capitalism, Peet et al. (2011) state, "the practical,
'efficient', competitive rationality used every day in capitalism
reverses the social and environmental rationality needed to sustain
continued social existence in the longer run" (p. 18).

Peet et al. (2011), use Marx's theory of alienation, his critique of
markets, and an lengthy examination of anthropogenic climate change to
suggest that, "something scarcely credible might indeed be happening:
'[**[normal' production]{.mark}** and consumption [**destroy**
the]{.mark} natural **[environment]{.mark}**, historical origin and
material source of human existence, to the point of
**collapse**]{.underline}" (p. 14). As Peet et al. (2011) catalog the
problems,

> [Waves of multiple global environmental [crises]{.mark} break
> with]{.underline} particular [**ferocity** on the shores of the
> **popular imagination**]{.underline}: [destruction of the rain
> forests, the disappearance of species]{.underline},
> [pollution]{.underline} from carbon dioxide emissions, [melting of the
> polar ice caps]{.underline}, the poisoning of the seas, the return of
> [nuclear proliferation]{.underline}, [global pandemics]{.underline},
> [massive oil leaks]{.underline}, and the threats of genetically
> modified organisms [[are]{.mark} regular [staples of the
> **mainstream**]{.mark} **media**]{.underline} (p. 13).

[[These]{.mark} types of environmental crises [are **social
products**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Attempted **solutions** must]{.mark}
therefore [be **social** as well]{.mark}]{.underline}. Again, Peet et
al. (2011), summarize:

> [The [destruction]{.mark} of nature\... [results from]{.mark} an
> **[alienated]{.mark} form** of the [production]{.mark} of **human
> existence**]{.underline}, [one that is]{.underline} not democratically
> controlled, that is [organized indirectly [through
> **markets**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [that is based [in]{.mark} the
> self-interested [pursuit of **profit**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and that
> has to grow to survive. [If we want to understand what is happening to
> the]{.underline} 23 [environment]{.underline}, [we have to understand
> the **origins**, **development**, structure and **dynamics** of
> **capitalism**]{.underline}\...(p. 15).

In this theory, [**[alienated human]{.mark}** being**[s]{.mark}**
[**cannot** make **environmentally rational decisions** because
**competition** drives them do the **opposite**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
"\[[Environmental degradation is not an unfortunate accident under
advanced capitalism]{.underline}," Peet et al. (2011) write, "[[it
is]{.mark} instead a part of [the **logic** of that **economic
system**]{.mark}]{.underline}\... [of various logics and
**trajectories** of **accumulation**]{.underline}--- [and the deadly
operation of markets]{.underline}---worked out the land and specific
resources" (p. 26). Recently, scholars have been working to incorporate
this type of Marxist social-ecological thinking into critiques of
resilience thinking.

1.5.2.2 The Critique

The basic critique that [**radical** political
**economists**]{.underline} have [levied on **[resilience
thinking]{.mark}**]{.underline}, is that [**resilience** is being used
as a [**conceptual tool** to]{.mark} create political-environmental
subjects that [**fit** into the **neoliberal**]{.mark} world
**[order]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Joseph, 2013; MacKinnon & Derickson,
2013; Nelson, 2014). Neoliberalism is used here to describe a set of
mental logics and public policies - brought into prominence in the 1980s
by Ronald Regan, Margret Thatcher, and other world leaders - [that
operate]{.underline} primarily [to expand free markets]{.underline},
invigorate privatization, and minimize government intervention in
production and distribution of goods and services (except for when the
interventions support neoliberal goals), or to promote the reproduction
and expansion of a particular form of contemporary capitalism (Castree
2010a, 2010b, 2011; Harvey, 2005). Proponents of neoliberalism, the
critique argues, are advancing the resilience paradigm so that 24
localities exposed to the volatility of global markets and the
environmental insecurities brought about by anthropogenic environmental
change (associated with capitalist accumulation) will be able to survive
on their own and without the aid of public support. [Resilience is being
used by powerful neoliberal actors to perpetuate a [**culture** of
**individual** and **local**-**scale responsibility**]{.mark} within a
global system that [is **inherently unstable**]{.mark} and prone to
**crisis**]{.underline}. [Resilient communities will **not** contest
neoliberalism, the critique insists, because they can affectively
**absorb** the **perturbations** it causes through **adaptation** and
transformation]{.underline}.

Neoliberalism can be understood as a hegemonic ideology operating at the
global scale in support of capitalism (Gallaher, 2009). In their
critique of resilience, MacKinnon and Derickson (2013) contend,
"[[**resilient spaces** are]{.mark} **precisely** [what **capitalism
needs**]{.mark}]{.underline} - [spaces that are periodically
**reinvented** to meet the **changing demands** of capital accumulation
in an increasingly globalized society]{.underline}" (p. 254). [By
appealing to metaphors of nature and natural systems, **resilience**
thinking **[naturalizes]{.mark}** environmental and social [**problems**
that are **not**]{.mark} **actually [natural]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[but rather a result of capitalist production and
consumption]{.underline} - one particular and historic way of organizing
society. "[The effect]{.underline}," they say, "is to naturalize crisis,
reasoning with neoliberal discourses which [[stress the
**inevitability** of **globalization**]{.underline}]{.mark}" (p. 259)
[and the environmental crises of climate change]{.underline}.
[Resilience thinking, in sum, supports **neoliberal ideology** at the
**expense** of possible **alternative modes** of political economy that
would be less socially and environmentally destructive]{.underline}.

The relationship between global-scale processes of capital accumulation
and local communities caught up in the act is central to this line of
critique. As MacKinnon and Derickson (2013) write, 25

> \[C\]oncern with the resilience of place is misconceived\... \[It\]
> locates the sources of resilience as lying within the particular scale
> in question\... By contrast, we contend that the processes which shape
> resilience operate primarily at the scale of \[global\] capitalist
> social relations (p. 255).

[[Devolving responsibility to **local places**]{.mark} to 'be
**resilient**']{.underline}, they contend, [is [creat]{.mark}ing [a
**condition** where communities become **responsible** for]{.mark}
adapting to [**global threats** but **lack**]{.mark} the [**power** to
influence the **original causes**]{.mark} of those threats]{.underline}.

The use of scale in political economic critiques of resilience is
similar to early work in political ecology. Blaikie and Brookfield
(1987) demonstrate that [**soil degradation** on **African farms**
should not be attributed to **local mismanagement**, but rather to
larger scale **capitalist** forces that effectively require
**increased** agricultural **output** from the land]{.underline}.
Resilience thinking can learn from their call for 'chains of
explanation' when analyzing systems at a single scale. [The **panarchy**
model within **resilience thinking** emphasizes cross-scale
interactions, but despite this, resilience scholars have not adequately
considered global causes (and solutions) to local problems]{.underline}.
[The resilience of communities **does not** preclude **mitigation** or
social change at **other levels**]{.underline}. To the contrary, the
resilience of communities may very well depend on global scale social
change.

MacKinnon and Derickson (2013) conclude by stating,
"\[**[P]{.underline}**\][**romoting** **resilience** in the face of the
urgent crisis of climate change and global recession actually serves to
**naturalize** the ecologically dominant systems of global
capitalism]{.underline}" (p. 266). [As an alternative]{.underline},
[they offer [a **politics of resourcefulness**]{.mark}, which they claim
[**overcomes** the **shortcomings of resilience** by promoting]{.mark}
in **local places**]{.underline}, "[genuinely [**deliberative democratic
dialogue** to develop\... **alternative**]{.mark}]{.underline} 26
[[**agendas** and]{.mark}\... meaningfully [**challenge** existing
**power relations**]{.mark}]{.underline}" (p. 263). [This is a
**promising concept** and should definitely be **pursued**]{.underline}.
However, I am interested in taking a slightly different tack. Instead of
replacing resilience with an alternative concept, I am interested in
'fixing' resilience by integrating it with radical political economy.
Unlike MacKinnon and Derickson (2013), I do not view the two as mutually
exclusive. Following recent arguments by Hornborg (2013), Cretney
(2014), and Nelson (2014), I contend that resilience can be harnessed to
promote radical projects that challenge capitalist ideology. To show how
this can work I turn to Gibson-Graham's critique of radical political
economy.

1.5.3 Capitalism with a Lower Case 'c'

Gibson-Graham's central argument is that [Marxists have
**inadvertently** strengthened capitalism by producing a **discourse**
that presents it as an]{.underline} absolute, all encompassing,
[**inescapable** phenomenon]{.underline} - [or Capitalism with a
**capital 'C'**]{.underline}. In so doing, the argument goes, Marxists
have engendered a situation where the only perceivable alternative to
capitalism is a complete and total working-class revolution. The entire
social system of the world must be replaced by a whole new system. [The
problem with this understanding of capitalism is that in light of the
failure and fall of many of the world's communist
governments]{.underline}, [the working class **revolution** seems like
an **impossible dream**]{.underline}. [In turn, Marxists]{.underline} of
all stripes [have been rendered frustrated and **empty handed** in terms
of **'solutions'**]{.underline}. "[It is the way **capitalism** has been
**'thought'**]{.underline}", Gibson-Graham writes, "[that make it **so
difficult** for people to imagine its **supersession**]{.underline}"
(1996, pp 4.)

Gibson-Graham deconstructs the radical [political economy
**[discourse]{.mark}** on capitalism]{.underline} to [[show]{.mark} that
[capitalism]{.mark} is not actually all encompassing and that
non-capitalist modes of production]{.underline} 27 [and consumption
occur all the time, all over the place, right alongside
capitalism]{.underline}. They effectively [argue for seeing the economic
field of society [as a **differentiated plane**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[with multiple types of economic relations coexisting]{.underline}.
[When one views the situation thus, it becomes clear that [a
**complete** and **total**]{.mark} working-class [**revolution** is not
the **only** viable option]{.mark} for bringing about positive
change]{.underline}. [One can [instead focus on]{.mark} the small
[**day-to-day projects** that offer **immediate realizations**
of]{.mark} the [**benefits** of]{.mark} **capitalism's
[alternatives]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

At the center of their deconstruction is their understanding of Marx's
definition of capitalism. Marx defined capitalism as a system of
production and consumption wherein the means of production are
controlled by an owning class while the production itself is provided by
a laboring class. The value of the work the labors provide is more than
they are paid for, which allows the owning class to syphon-off surplus
value in the form of profit. It is the appropriation of surplus value
(i.e., capital accumulation) by one entity away from another that
constitutes exploitation and defines capitalism. Gibson-Graham
demonstrates instances where this type of exploitation is not occurring:
self-employment (where surplus value is appropriated by the laborer);
cooperative businesses (where surplus value is appropriated by
employee-owners, consumer-owners, and reinvested into the community);
and household production (where labor is never transformed into its
monetary value form, thus providing no surplus to be appropriated).
Gibson-Graham also bring to light [the [**fluidity** of **economic
identities**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [show]{.underline}ing [how an
individual can be both an exploited laborer at their day
job]{.underline}, for example, [but an appropriator of surplus value
through the investment of their retirements funds in the stock
market]{.underline}. "[Economic sites that have usually been seen as
**homogenously** capitalist]{.underline}," Gibson-Graham explains, "[may
be [**reenvisioned** as **sites** of]{.mark} **economic
[difference]{.mark}**, where a variety of capitalist and
**non-capitalist** class **processes** **interact**]{.underline}" (1996,
p. 18). 28

Similar approaches to studying alternatives to capitalism include work
on moral economies (Scott, 1977), Buddhist economics (Schumacher, 1973),
and sharing (Gold, 2004). In sum, [**[alternatives]{.mark}** to
capitalism can be viewed as those processes of **production** and
**consumption** of goods and services]{.underline}--- [and the
**social**-**ecological relations** the processes
intimate]{.underline}---[wherein the [driving force is **not**]{.mark}
the [**maximization** of capital]{.mark} accumulation by an elite class
of owners, [but]{.mark} rather the [**maximization** of
**social**-**ecological** **well-being**]{.mark} through an **equitable
distribution** of the products of human labor]{.underline}.

Pulling away from Gibson-Graham and returning the purposes of this
dissertation, an important question emerges. If capitalism's
alternatives are still predicated on the production of surplus value
through the exploitation of labor (humans) and raw materials (non-human
environments), [do these modes of economy offer any real promise for
remedying the social and environmental impacts of capitalism and thereby
contributing to the of resilience of Indigenous communities in the
Arctic]{.underline}? On the social front, it is relatively straight
forward to see how alternative modes of production/consumption and
distribution enhance social justice and equity--- [**[surplus
value]{.mark}** is [distributed **equitably**]{.mark} among many rather
than horded by a few]{.underline}. [Similarly, on the environmental
side, we know that **[communally owned]{.mark}** natural [**resources**
can be **sustainably managed**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Ostrom, 1990). [[By
**replacing** **profit**]{.mark} maximization [with]{.mark} equitable
**[well-being]{.mark}** as the key driver of economies]{.underline}
(Figure 1.4), [alternatives to capitalism make room for decisions that
are more **ecologically sound**]{.underline} than those determined by
capitalist logic. 29

In this regard, [**[Arctic peoples]{.mark}** have continually,
[**traditionally** and **sustainably** protect]{.mark}ed [the
**environment**]{.mark}, [with a **responsibility** to]{.mark} maintain
and enhance the environment for **[future

[or]{.mark} sources of [**medicine** is **central** to]{.mark} the
communities\' **[customs]{.mark}** and cultural beliefs]{.underline}
(John, 2016). [Arctic peoples, therefore, [rely on the
environment]{.mark} not only [for]{.mark} their **[physical]{.mark}**,
but also for their [**cultural** and **spiritual needs**]{.mark},
thereby protecting and maintaining environmental and cultural
relationships]{.underline} (Krumpen et al., 2019; Kumpula et al., 2011).

In this context, [**[preventive mobilizations]{.mark}** that anticipate
potential adverse socio-environmental impacts in order to
**[protect]{.mark}** and maintain [the **environment**]{.mark} for
future generations play an important role to achieve **positive
outcomes**. According to our analysis, preventive mobilizations can play
a key role for [achieving]{.mark} the [**cancellation** of]{.mark}
**conflictive [projects]{.mark}**, [the **avoidance** of

[**prevention** of **negative project**]{.mark} impact**[s]{.mark}**,
such as **loss** of **t**raditional **k**nowledge, **practices**, and
**cultures** in the Arctic]{.underline}. However, successful preventive
mobilizations do not occur in a social vacuum but are shaped further by
structural factors of the countries in which environmental conflicts
occur. As our results have shown, the higher a country\'s dependence on
natural resource rents, the lower may be the chances for activists to
successfully stop socially conflictive and environmentally damaging
projects, arguably, because the state\'s pressure to implement
conflictive resource use projects is higher (cf. Le Billon and Lujala,
2020). This shows how colonial and current commodity frontiers shape not
only the specific places where commodities are extracted and processed,
but also the political economy of the countries in which conflicts and
mobilizations occur.

7. Conclusion

This article investigated fifty-three socio-environmental conflicts in
the Arctic region. The Arctic has been used to expand commodity
extraction frontiers, especially for metals and fossil fuels. Despite of
being located in the Global North, the Arctic frontier shares
similar political ecologies with resource and commodity extraction
frontiers in the so-called Global South. This suggests that clear-cut
distinctions for North and South do not always apply, but both
peripheral regions in the South and the North are being targeted by
extractive capital.

However, [people confront coloniality]{.underline}, weak governments,
[and **repression**, because of the harm that extractive tendencies
perpetrate on the environment and on socio-cultural
well-being]{.underline}. Correspondingly, [there is a **growing number**
of environmental conflicts across all the **Arctic** countries and
provinces]{.underline}. [[While **state**-**corporate hybrids**]{.mark}
tend to [impose]{.mark} settler colonial **relations** through
**[extractive projects]{.mark}**, interwoven in different forms of
repression, [these **projects** operate on **thin ice**]{.mark}, [as
their **socio**-**environmental impacts** are **far reaching**]{.mark},
[and resistances]{.mark} against these projects [are
**mounting**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [We observe a strong social [response

**Indigenous** communities, [from which]{.mark} a transversal movement

[[Prefigurative politics]{.underline}]{.mark}---and its cognate,
prefiguration---is one of those concepts that appear to be rather
abstruse, but whose meaning actually indicates something ordinary. [It
[refers to]{.mark} the [strategies]{.mark} and practices [employed
by]{.mark} political [activists to build **alternative futures**]{.mark}
**in the** **present** and [**to effect** political change **by not
reproducing**]{.mark} the social [structures]{.mark} that [activists
**oppose**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Prefiguration has been widely
associated with the modus operandi of the social movements that
blossomed after the 1960s, drawing on anarchist-inspired principles,
such as participative democracy, horizontality, inclusiveness, and
direct action. [Via the motto [**'another world is possible'**,
prefiguration]{.mark} is often part of activist-led social experiments
that, rather than serving clearly established goals, [create
**open-ended** ways of]{.mark} **re[imagining society]{.mark}** [and
contesting]{.mark} the **[entanglements of]{.mark}** representative
democracy, **[neoliberalism]{.mark}**, social inequality, and
globalisation.]{.underline}

Yet, before prefiguration gained prominence with the last decades'
protests against neoliberal globalisation, how did this concept come
into being? First used centuries ago to betoken a form of Christian
salvation, how did prefiguration acquire a different meaning among
political activists? What kind of politics is referred to as
prefigurative?

The 1960s witnessed the emergence of the so-called 'new social
movements' and the 'New Left'. These constituted movements that
amplified causes which spoke not only to economic and class-related
goals, but also to civil rights, ethics, and alternative ways of
inhabiting the world. Such causes include feminism, environmentalism,
the movements for gay rights, animal rights, the American civil rights
and other antiracism movements worldwide, students' movements and, since
the 1990s, alterglobalisation movements (against neoliberal
globalisation). Questioning Marxist and social-democratic forms of
political action, the prefigurative forms of activism at the heart of
these movements do not necessarily seek to mobilise every means
available to achieve a pre-established, future-oriented goal. [Instead,
they [aim to create]{.mark} a more [**egalitarian** **and inclusive**
society by **equalling**]{.mark} a movement's **[means with]{.mark}** a
movement's **[ends]{.mark}**: reaching a horizontal society
**[requires]{.mark}** building horizontal relationships between
activists in the present, which will, in turn, **[prefigure the
envisaged end.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Such movements and tactics were labelled 'new' when measured against the
paradigmatic 'old' of institutionalised activism carried out by
political parties and trade unions since at least the Industrial
Revolution. [Thinking about political [activism from]{.mark} the
perspective of **[grand narratives]{.mark}** and **ideologies**---as
well as of communist theories of comprehensive social change---has
[**stimulated** social scientists to]{.mark} regard the success of a
given mobilisation as dependent upon the attainment of certain
predetermined goals (Maeckelbergh 2011), such as a revolution that will
[**dismantle capitalism** and implement]{.mark} a **[new mode of
production]{.mark}**. Yet, seeking a revolution as the ultimate goal
often **assumes** that any **means are** valid **to reach** a more
egalitarian and **classless society**. Unlike this paradigm,
**[prefigurative politics refrain,]{.mark}** for instance,
**[from]{.mark} [using authoritarianism]{.mark}** to build a democratic
society.]{.underline}

Anthropology has shown a long-standing interest in prefigurative
politics since this concept's first links with social movements. Mostly
through the work of anthropologists-cum-activists, prefiguration has
been approached alongside themes dear to the discipline, such as social
organisation, globalisation, inequality, social change,
community-building, and the ways in which everyday lives are lived.
While political scientists and sociologists have mostly concentrated on
political strategies by drawing parallels between several cognate social
movements, anthropologists have employed participant observation to
explore particular movements, collectives, and networks. In such manner,
they have produced a nuanced understanding of how prefiguration takes
place on the ground---without losing sight of its shortcomings.

Due to ethnographers' particular attention to prefigurative politics in
Europe and the United States, the existing body of literature may convey
the idea that prefiguration thrives particularly in the Global North.
Existing analyses have also tended to focus on disruptive, contentious
politics. By contrast, fewer studies stress the pertinence of
prefigurative practices in the everyday lives of people in the Global
South, and of those who are not full-time protesters. Even fewer have
considered how right-wing activists also mobilise prefiguration. While
scholars generally agree on what constitutes prefigurative politics,
some highlight an apparent paradox when the anarchist-inspired
principles underlying prefiguration are mobilised by activists who are,
content-wise, anything but anarchists. Other scholars, in turn,
accentuate prefiguration as a political strategy that can be similarly
deployed by activists advancing progressive as much as conservative
content. Lastly, as I will discuss, several researchers have used
prefiguration as a rather problematic umbrella term to label which
movements and forms of activism have a prefigurative character and which
ones have not.

To explore the historical and current significance of prefigurative
politics, as well as its limitations, this entry analyses how this
concept and the practices it designates have come to bear relevance
among those who oppose representative democracy, build small-scale
politically organised entities as horizontal micropolities, and embody
alternative lifestyles. Questioning the seeming straightforwardness of
the divide between the new and old lefts and bringing right-wing
movements to the discussion, this entry provides anthropologists and
non-academics with a gateway to better understand the pervasive
practices that aim to turn activism into laboratories from where people
foster change by experimenting with new socialities.

The concept of prefiguration is often credited to Carl Boggs (1977) to
describe the logics and practices of left-wing movements that, mostly
since the 1960s, opposed Leninism and the working-class politics aimed
at structural reform. Yet, little did Boggs know that the term had been
previously used by Augustine in the 4th century BCE to explain a key
tenet of Christianity. [Examining the fall of lust-laden Rome,
[Augustine]{.mark} (\[1470\] 1998) [pointed]{.mark} out that, [to
enjoy]{.mark} spiritual [salvation and avoid]{.mark} collective
[perishing]{.mark}, people should resign their paganism and commit to
charity and moral integrity. Only by [prefiguring a]{.mark} divine
[beatitude]{.mark} could one near a state of holiness [to be]{.mark}
partially [enjoyed]{.mark} in the present and fully realised in the
future]{.underline} (Scholl 2016, 321; Buts 2019, 17).

Whereas Augustine heralded spiritual salvation via the earthly enactment
of God's conduct, centuries later, Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels
(\[1848\] 2015) would call for political salvation via overthrowing the
bourgeoisie and bringing an end to class struggle. [Moving [away from
prefig]{.mark}uration, [the Communist manifesto]{.mark} (1848)
[urged]{.mark} proletarians [to fight]{.mark} the monopoly of the means
of production held by the few, in a form of political salvation that
ousts reformisms and entails revolutionary macropolitical changes.
Toppling all existing social conditions, according to Marx and Engels,
makes the revolution the means to reach the ultimate end of inaugurating
a communist, classless society. Yet, [means and ends]{.mark} frequently
**[clashed]{.mark}** here: major streams of [Marxism ended up
**reproducing**]{.mark} the **[authoritarian state power]{.mark}** and
highly bureaucratic hierarchies characteristic of bourgeois society
(Boggs 1977, 5).]{.underline} Thus, Marx's anti-statist theories often
gained materiality via statist practices.

Contrasting with such statist orientations, the late 1960s and early
1970s saw the emergence of a new wave of radical politics. [With [the
May 1968 uprisings]{.mark} in France and the civil rights movements in
the US as their core symbols, the new social movements and New Left
(Epstein 1991; Polletta 2002) [reinforced]{.mark} the
[centrality]{.mark} of collective identity, civil rights, and lifestyles
in activist agendas. In the French case, the emergence of youth
mobilisations---initially associated with the fight against university
funding policies---promptly **[gained]{.mark}** the **[support of
broader society]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Via street barricades,
occupation of universities, and France's largest wildcat strikes,
protesters---factory workers, students, and feminists, among
others---built a communal agenda without having much in common. This
implied replacing each group's specific claims with broader demands,
thus turning May 1968 into an open-ended experiment of societybuilding.
Through grassroots practices collectively decided and enacted on the go,
May 1968 had a longlasting effect, enabling environmentalist,
anti-fascist, and feminist perspectives to enter into the mainstream.

Meanwhile, Italian autonomism was gaining ground since the 1950s.
Starting on factories' shop floors, the worker's autonomy movement
(Autonomia Operaia) in Italy came to involve university students, women,
artists, migrants, and other subaltern groups not traditionally
conceived as 'proletarian' (Katsiaficas 2006). While occupying
factories, universities, and abandoned buildings, autonomists sought to
enact selfmanagement and carry out everyday, small-scale revolutions by
circumventing representative decisionmaking bodies (such as corporate
boards, trade unions, governmental ministries, and political parties).
On the other side of the Atlantic, the anti-Vietnam War demonstrations
in the US succeeded in connecting students and workers, Black Panthers
and pacifists, upper-middle-class white people, feminists, church
organisations, anti-nuclear activists, and war veterans. Initially an
uprising against warmongering, this coalition orchestrated a display of
generalised political dissatisfaction despite not having a single,
unifying agenda.

[[Operating **outside**]{.mark} the **[institutional
frameworks]{.mark}** of the state, political parties, and trade unions,
these new social [**movements took shape** through]{.mark} autonomous
[activists who **organised** in]{.mark} a mostly **[non-hierarchical,
network-like manner.]{.mark}**]{.underline} They sought to break with
hierarchical and institutionalised politics [[in two]{.mark} main [ways.
First]{.mark}ly, they **[expanded]{.mark}** the **[scope of
politics]{.mark}** by [bringing to]{.mark} the [table **previously
marginalised**]{.mark} political [agendas]{.mark}. Mobilising
prefiguration as an activist strategy, the New Left underscored issues
from feminism and structural racism to drug policy reforms and
environmental issues.]{.underline} Conservative activists equally
deployed prefiguration to increase the relevance of anti-abortion and
anti-drug advocacy. [[Secondly]{.mark}, the new social [movements **gave
visibility** to principles]{.mark} according to which the political
means **[to achieve an end]{.mark}** had to be consistent with that end.
[To build a]{.mark} more [**democratic and egalitarian** society, one
had to **deploy**]{.mark} **democratic and egalitarian** forms of
**[grassroot]{.mark}s [activism]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Likewise,
building a white supremacist society means enacting 'racially pure'
small-scale communities (Futrell and Simi 2004). Such uses of the
concept have brought prefiguration to the core of post-1960s social
movements' political repertoire (Boggs 1977; Calhoun 1993).

Despite the diversity of prefigurative practices and the fact that the
movements analysed here do not constitute a homogeneous whole, these
practices tend to have in common 'the embodiment, within the ongoing
political practise of a movement, of those forms of social relations,
decision-making, culture, and human experience that are the ultimate
goal' (Boggs 1977, 6-7). [Hence, [prefiguration is a way]{.mark} for
activists [to **anticipate**]{.mark} the **[changes they seek]{.mark}**.
And while everyday micropolitical action may not trigger a revolution or
herald political salvation, [it]{.mark} may progressively **[transform
our ways of thinking]{.mark}**, behaving, [and imagining **what society
should be like.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

After its surge in the 1960s, prefigurative politics gained new momentum
in the 1990s. With the dissolution of the USSR, social movements had to
reinvent themselves beyond statism and rethink the capitalism versus
communism divide. [**[The]{.mark} 1994 [Zapatista uprising]{.mark}** in
Mexico, for instance, gathered peasants, indigenous peoples, and
marginalised urban groups in protest **[against]{.mark}** the
[**neoliberalism** imposed]{.mark} by [the]{.mark} Mexican state's land
reforms and the **[implementation of]{.mark}** the North American Free
Trade Agreement (**[NAFTA]{.mark}**).]{.underline} However, the
Zapatistas did not address the government or political parties in their
political demands: they fought for autonomy to implement by themselves
the local-level changes they envisaged (Stahler-Stolk 2010). Ultimately,
the Zapatistas managed to establish autonomous zones in the Mexican
state of Chiapas, with local communities having more say in shaping
state policies and school curricula. Twenty-four years on, in 2018, the
Zapatistas put forward Marichuy, an indigenous woman, to run for the
presidency of Mexico. Aware of the unlikelihood of her victory, the
Zapatistas aimed to use the presidential elections to highlight to the
subalterns at the margins of Mexican society that their reality can be
changed for the better, especially outside the framework of
institutionalised, representative politics (Ansotegui 2018).
[[Prefiguring alternatives]{.mark} to market-controlled globalisation
and state politics since 1994, the Zapatista uprising [**inspired
movements** that]{.mark} [would]{.mark} increasingly **[tackle global
issues]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[[Prefig]{.mark}urative [politics gained]{.mark} even wider [visibility
with]{.mark} a movement that placed neoliberal globalisation as its
nemesis: **[the 1999 protests]{.mark} in Seattle** [against]{.mark} the
austerity, deregulation, and large-scale [privatisation]{.mark} measures
laid down [by the]{.mark} Washington Consensus and advanced by
international bodies such as the World Trade Organization
([WTO]{.mark}).]{.underline} Following months of planning, the activists
and collectives loosely gathered under the Direct Action Network formed
a human barricade around the venue hosting the WTO ministerial
conference. Contrasting with the WTO's hierarchies and formalities,
protesters wore costumes, danced, carried placards, and chanted
anti-capitalist slogans, followed by marching bands performing in the
blocked streets. Violence was also present, coming from police
repression and from some protesters' tactics of fighting neoliberalism
by damaging institutional buildings, banks, and multinational
corporations. Such lack of a consensus between partisans of violent and
non-violent forms of direct action evinces the inherent diversity of
activist tactics subsumed under the label 'prefiguration'.

[While the [protesters **prevented** the WTO]{.mark} delegates from
**reaching the conference** venue, activist [crowds turned]{.mark}
[into]{.mark} a [commons]{.mark}---a free space where [people
**developed**]{.mark}, at least for a limited number of days, **[an
alternative sphere]{.mark}** of social (re)production **involving care,
education, food**, and housing (Varvarousis, Asara and Akbulut 2021).
**[Through]{.mark} general [assemblies]{.mark}**, workshops, and
encampments, [they sought to prefigure]{.mark} locally the kind of
relationships they envisaged for the world. In]{.underline} bonding with
each other through solidarity, informality, horizontality, and
inclusiveness, the activists sought to oppose, through their practices,
the formality, authoritarianism, and exclusionary character of
neoliberal organisations. [[The commons]{.mark} also **[created]{.mark}
[opportunities]{.mark}** [for radical learning]{.mark}: in a dialogical
process of horizontal education (Backer et al. 2017), activists
co-produced knowledge, learned from each other's prior political
experiences, [and **materialised alternative socialities**]{.mark}.
Keeping the movement constantly open to dialogue was their way to give
justice [to]{.mark} and **[make real their motto]{.mark}** 'another
world is possible']{.underline}.

Philippe Pignarre and Isabelle Stengers (2011) aptly illustrate the
significance of open-endedness for prefigurative politics. Inspired by
the writings of Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari (1987), the authors
argue that capitalism operates through apparatuses of capture by
creating boundaries to autonomous thinking and paralysing collective
action. In remaining open to multiple ways of imagining and rebuilding
society, the Seattle protests had a 'rhizomatic' character: for being
non-institutionalised, spontaneous, and made up of activists supporting
diverse causes, viewpoints, and activist strategies, these kinds of
protests are meant to be more resistant to capture by institutional
politics. An open letter, petition, or even a march against the WTO
conference would have constituted a more easily recognisable repertoire
for politicians and the police. It would have enabled them to enact
standard protocols to either repress or ignore such expressions of
dissatisfaction. A carnivalesque demonstration, on the other hand, shows
how resistance can also be aestheticised, making it difficult for
politicians, business people, and the police to curb the protest.

In this fashion, Seattle sought to depict neoliberal globalisation not
as an abstract, unstoppable process, but as a set of concrete austerity
and deregulation measures that can be challenged and mocked by ordinary
people. This power of the crowds was later underscored by the motto 'we
are the 99%', made famous by the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement, via
the argument according to which the majority of the world's population
cannot pay for the mistakes of the upper-class minority.

The Seattle protests also consolidated prefigurative politics not as an
'anything goes' way of showing dissatisfaction, but as a strategy in
itself (Maeckelbergh 2011). In opposing summits of the G8, NATO, and the
World Bank (Graeber 2009), the New Left draws its political action on
grassroots democracy, direct action, and the creation of alternative
micropolitical relations of power (Yates 2015a). Holding voluntary
working groups to set up tents in occupied squares, serving food to
participants, protecting them from police action, and keeping spaces of
protest clean work to turn hierarchical power relations into inclusive
and participatory practices.

[In anthropology, the prefiguration debate gained popularity mostly
through the work of David Graeber. Actively participating in
**alterglobalisation** movements and demonstrations mainly in the US,
Graeber (2002; 2009, xvii) asserts that political **activism** in the
twenty-first century will be increasingly **influenced** by **anarchist
imperatives** and practices.]{.underline} What Graeber refers to as
'anarchism' emerges directly from the left-libertarian tradition that
fosters social equality alongside individual freedom. [Expressed via
direct action, this conception of anarchism is grounded on
**prefigurative** practices that turn activist settings into
**concrete** examples of what '**real democracy** is like' and how
society can take **alternative** forms---even though such forms do not
**necessarily reflect left-wing** contents.]{.underline} Social
scientists who document how such strategies unfold in real life placed
prefiguration at the heart of their analyses of mobilisations such as
the Occupy movement (Graeber 2009; Razsa and Kurnik 2012), feminist
movements (Polletta 2002; Ishkanian and Saavedra 2019; Carmo 2019),
France's Nuit debout protests (Kokoreff 2016), the 15M movement in Spain
(Flesher Fominaya 2020), and the World Social Forums held mostly in the
Global South (Juris 2005; Teivainen 2016). Going beyond Western urban
spaces, some authors have brought anti-state forms of activism for
self-determination among Aboriginal peoples in Australia and Amazonian
indigenous peoples to this discussion (Petray and Gertz 2018).

[Prefigurative politics does not just refer to specific forms of
protests in which the very process of planning, carrying out, and
embodying political action becomes part of the message activists aim to
convey (Flesher Fominaya 2014). It also denotes direct ways of living
democracy.]{.underline} One of the most closely examined enactments of
prefigurative politics are therefore the general assemblies, which are
consensual decisionmaking spaces within occupied squares. As part of a
'generalised revolt against representation' (Tormey 2012, 136),
participatory democracy carried out by the activists/individuals
themselves has become a mechanism to counter representative democracy,
which is epitomised by political parties and elections. In general
assemblies, participants are placed in a circle to hear those at the
centre. No one must block the view of others, so that those who are hard
of hearing or far away can understand the speaker through lip reading
and body language. When the circle is too wide, participants employ a
technique known as 'the people's microphone': people gathered
immediately around the speaker repeat everything they say in unison, to
make the speaker's voice reach those at the edges without the need for
amplification devices (Deseriis 2014).

General assemblies are expected to give voice to potentially everyone:
once joining the speaking queue, participants should speak for
themselves, not as spokespersons of any collective or institution
(Teivanen 2016; Razsa and Kurnik 2012). [Interestingly, [**giving
voice** to]{.mark} the [99% starts with **empowering activists**]{.mark}
**[individually]{.mark}**, by placing autonomy [at the **core**
of]{.mark} ideal-typical [prefig]{.mark}urative [politics]{.mark}.
General assemblies and **decentralised** workshops make room [for
**direct action** and **convergence** of]{.mark} thought and
[action]{.mark}.]{.underline} For instance, middle-class
environmentalists may ask manual labourers for guidance on preparing
posters on veganism that could find broader appeal, and feminists may
advise anarchist students on how to convey their agendas in neutral
language. Workshops also propose self-reflection on the commons, raising
awareness of issues like racism or ableism among activists, as in this
2011 Occupy Boston workshop: The facilitator, a white male, began the
activity by asking for 20 diverse volunteers to line up side by side at
the front of the crowd assembled at the Occupy Boston encampment at
Dewey Square. He then issued a series of declarations: 'If your
ancestors lost land by the conquest of the U.S. government, step back;
Step forward if your ancestors gained assets through the slave trade;
Step back if your ancestors were brought here in chains to be slaves;
Step back if you or your ancestors arrived as immigrants from Latin
America, Asia, Africa, or the Caribbean'. These and other statements
produced a visible line of stratification, with mostly white
participants at the front and people of color toward the back (Juris et
al. 2012, 434-5). Opening the microphone and refusing fixed leadership
invite activists to enact horizontality and to develop a do-it-yourself
attitude. In not belonging to any institutionalised group or political
party, such activist spaces are meant to become potentially everyone's.
[[Joining these spaces involve]{.mark}s showing a **[willingness to
leave aside]{.mark}** a world driven by **discrimination,
[authoritarianism]{.mark}**[, and neoliberal practices **and setting a
'frame'**]{.mark} (Bateson 1972, 177--93) [where]{.mark}in
[**hierarchies** are]{.mark} temporarily
**[suspended]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [This frame encourages each
participant to act and express oneself not as a representative of given
political agendas, social status, or cultural backgrounds, but as
individuals who autonomously question, for instance, oppressive, sexist,
and colonialist regimes of truth.]{.underline}

Yet, building a new society from the ashes of the old entails carrying
with it some of the vicissitudes that activists try to purge from their
settings---which evinces the shortcomings of prefigurative politics.
Firstly, however globally-oriented and inclusive such movements attempt
to be, at times they reproduce gender, racial, and class segregation, as
white, richer, better-connected, and male citizens from the Global North
(Tarrow 2006: 44; Juris et al. 2012) tend to have more resources and
possibilities to afford the time to activism. Regarding horizontality,
the assemblies' open microphone is counterbalanced by how more
experienced and articulate activists often dominate these spaces.
Sometimes this may entail that marginalised and less educated people
will be less prone to talk---and, as open as the microphone might be,
less often heard (Beeman et al. 2009; Wengronowitz 2013). Ultimately,
horizontal forms of activism may thus lean towards authoritarianism,
especially on occasions when more charismatic activists become seen as
quasi-'leaders' or spokespersons of entire movements.

In addition, while the assembly format implies participatory democracy
and gives everybody a say, it means ideas will often be repeated,
frequently slowing down the pace of decisions and actions.
Paradoxically, processes aimed at consensual decision-making often
result neither in decisions nor in consensus, which either hampers the
political action or leaves the final decision to the most active and
influential activists, thus reproducing the centralised power that
prefigurative politics oppose. In a number of movements, the
open-endedness and inclusiveness that prevail in prefigurative politics
also result in the absence of a coherent overall agenda (Chomsky 2012;
Graeber 2013). Although being a feature, rather than a flaw, of these
movements, this is read by some as activists being clueless about how to
reach their goals (Lipset and Altbach 1966), resulting in movements that
may be more expressive than instrumental, privileging spectacle over
substance (Polletta 2002: 1-2).

These critiques and seeming flaws stress that creating a democratic
culture and experimenting politics differently are forcefully long-term
processes. Yet as the commons offer people solidarity and mutual
support, they may well emerge as the first steps for people to
collectively challenge the mainstream while prefiguring the new.

As the previous discussion on the open microphone suggests,
communication technologies and the media play a crucial role in
gathering people around political agendas. Just as the screening of the
Vietnam War boosted pacifist movements worldwide in the late 1960s
(Mandelbaum 1982), recent years have seen the rise of digital media as
major networking arenas triggering contentious politics.

[Several ethnographies have analysed [the **emergence of
activism**]{.mark} on digital media, particularly revolving around
hashtags (mostly on Twitter) such as **[#Ferguson]{.mark}** (Bonilla and
Rosa 2015), **[#MeToo]{.mark}** (Pipyrou 2018), and
**[#B]{.mark}**lack**[L]{.mark}**ives**[M]{.mark}**atter (Yang
2016).]{.underline} [While indexing information online, hashtags also
create mediatised spaces of peer support and solidarity when people
share about their struggles with racism, sexism, and state violence. Due
to the heightened temporality in digital media, hashtags mimic the
dynamics of face-toface activism, [enabling]{.mark} [users to
engage]{.mark} almost in real-time [with]{.mark} what happens in
in-person [protests]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Thus, [the occupation
of]{.mark} **New York's [Zuccotti Park]{.mark}, Madrid's [Puerta del
Sol]{.mark}, Athens' [Syntagma Square]{.mark}, Paris' [Place de la
République]{.mark}, and Cairo's [Tahrir Square]{.mark}** have been
[supplemented by]{.mark} the **'occupation' of** Facebook **timelines**,
YouTube channels, and Twitter feeds with **global [calls]{.mark}** [for
action]{.mark} and constant **updates** from the streets (Postill 2014;
Castells 2015).]{.underline}

[The **[Arab Spring]{.mark}** (2010-2012, beginning in Tunisia) and the
2011 [**Egyptian Revolution** offer]{.mark} a prime
[illustration]{.mark} [of how]{.mark} **digital [media enable]{.mark}**
the [**prefiguration** of]{.mark} a more [egalitarian
society.]{.mark}]{.underline} Bringing together Christians who used to
socialise primarily in church and Muslims who tended to gather in and
around mosques, the internet helped these groups find commonalities and
recognise their shared dissatisfaction with state violence and the
Egyptian government. Learning via digital media about protests taking
place in neighbouring countries in North Africa and the Middle East, a
great number of Egyptians saw their outrage matched by the hope conveyed
by activists abroad (Castells 2015). Thus, territorial activism in city
squares fed and was fed by deterritorialised activism online, amplifying
activists' voices and the reach of their support. While digital media
may usually serve mainstream purposes, they emerge in prefigurative
politics as platforms to both build activist networks and critically
rebuild communication. In this sense, digital media empower anyone to
communicate their own narratives and challenge mainstream regimes of
truth by sidestepping the mediation of journalists and the one-to-many
functioning of mass media (Castells 2008, 90).

Thinking of the arts and citizen media as prime examples of what John
Downing (2001) calls 'radical media' enables us to highlight the media's
potential to report state violence in protests and violation of human
rights in war-laden countries, as well as to give voice to those who are
systematically excluded from mainstream sources of news. In this vein,
the 1999-born Independent Media Center (IMC) was a landmark in covering
the Seattle protests in real time (Downing 2003). Through its call for
arms---'Don\'t hate the media, become the media!'---the IMC became the
forerunner of analogous grassroots initiatives producing content online
without links to corporate news outlets.

### Alt---Prefiguration---2NC---Framework/AT: Utopian Fiat

Others have warned about the colonization of planning by a 'creeping
pessimism' and an 'absence of hope for the future' (Bletter 1993, 47).
There seems to be a reluctance to imagine places that do not yet exist,
and to explore and advocate social and spatial transformations towards
better urban futures. [[The]{.mark} disastrous [**consequences**
of]{.mark} modernist **urban [planning]{.mark}** [along with
**utopia's**]{.mark} one **literal meaning** as 'no-place' appears to
have [assigned **utopian thinking** to]{.mark} the **[dustbin]{.mark}**
of planning ideas and discourses (Pinder 2022). However, while
**[modernist utopianism]{.mark}** has [lost]{.mark} its [appeal]{.mark},
'[the]{.mark} Utopian [impulse']{.mark} has [remained]{.mark} 'an
**[irrepressible]{.mark} part of human spirit'** (Sandercock 1998,
1).]{.underline} Amid the uncertainties and despairs, this utopian
impulse, as a key function of hope, helps us to see the existing
conditions not as how things are, but as how they are made to be, and
how they might be unmade. Such a capability is a vital driving force for
prefigurative planning as a collective process of performing the future
in the present.

In what follows, I sketch out the conceptual framework of prefigurative
planning by focusing on the interrelated concepts of prefiguration, the
not-yet, hope, and concrete utopia. Based on this, admittedly abstract,
framework, I suggest that prefigurative planning is a collective pursuit
of: negating the given, envisioning concrete utopias, and performing the
not-yet future in the present. I also suggest that, the space--time of
prefigurative planning is 'here and now' with relations of (un)care
cutting across its contents, processes and reflections. That, its
politics plays out in the interstices of everyday spatial practices and
combines reason with intuition and emotion. Throughout, I stress that
prefigurative planning is not about how to 'build that city on the
hill', but how not to give up the pursuit of a plural 'better cities'
with planning imagination.

Prefiguration has a long history in social movement scholarship and
activism. The use of the term can be traced back to anarchist writings
of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century (Springer 2014) and
the New Left of the 1960s / 1970s (Breines 1982) including Gramsci's
(1971) critique of the classical Marxist's abstract principles and its
focus on the structural determinants of change. In discussing how signs
of radical change are prefigured in the present, Gramsci shifted the
attention towards civil society's capacity and everyday struggles to
build the new in the shell of the old without limiting the new to the
boundaries of the old (Ince 2012). For Carl Boggs (1977, 2),
prefigurative politics is 'the embodiment, within the ongoing political
practice of a movement, of those forms of social relations,
decision-making, culture and human experience that are the ultimate
goal'. This is not simply about Gandhi's frequently cited injunction:
'be the change that you want to see', or 'practice what you preach'.
Rather, it is about 'reformulation of the means-ends distinction' (Van
de Sande 2013, 233) whereby one mirrors the other (Swain 2019). As I
discuss later, this focus on the journey instead of the destination also
distinguishes the utopianism of modernist planning from that of
prefigurative planning.

Prefigurative politics 'refers to a range of social experiments that
critique the status quo' (Cornish et al. 2016, 114) while at the same
time pursuing future 'alternative or utopic social relations in the
present' (Yates 2015, 1). Since the post-2008 social movements, such as
Occupy (Gordon 2018), it has gained a growing currency in a wide range
of literature from politics to psychology. In planning scholarship,
however, the concept has remained underdeveloped. This is intriguing
given the close affinity between prefiguration and the future-oriented
nature of planning. To close this gap, we need to critically engage with
the concept and explore its potentials for future directions of planning
theory, practice and education. With this paper, I am inviting planning
scholars and practitioners to a dialogue by putting forward a framework
for a prefigurative mode of planning that constitutes both the negation
of the given and the creation of alternatives.

Margaret Thatcher, the former British Prime Minister, summed up the
hegemonic metanarratives of our time by claiming that 'there is no
alternative' to the neoliberalised EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES 2279
capitalist order, and 'there is no such thing as a society' in the
individualized social relations. Much of the so called 'realities' of
our time are built on the taken-forgranted assumptions that, the
relentless pursuit of capitalist growth is the source of all good and
market transactions can solve all social and ecological problems. That,
profit-maximizing growth lifts everyone up and trickle-down economics
create levelled-up geographies. That, hedonistic consumption generates
happiness and wellbeing. That, the only true measure of progress is the
GDP. That, cities as 'growth machines' are better off if they roll out
financialised real estate development and become safe-deposit-boxes for
'anonymous, illicit money' (Fernandez et al, 2016:2457). And that,
public interest is served not by safeguarding social and environmental
values, but by boosting private, speculative urban development. In the
face of these entrenched assumptions, any dissenting voices are 'deemed
to be the act of lunatics, idealists and revolutionaries' (Jackson 2009,
14) and any progressive planning activity is undermined as being a
barrier to enterprise.

[[The hold of]{.mark} these [fabricated 'realities']{.mark} upon our
imagination [has been **reinforced** by]{.mark} a
**[misguided]{.mark}**, Foucauldian-inspired [argument that]{.mark} all
forms of independent action [risk being **co-opted** and]{.mark}
[**appropriated** into **neoliberal agendas** through]{.mark} a
**complex and [pervasive 'system of micro-power']{.mark}** (Foucault
2007) which [leaves little room for]{.mark} **effective
'[counter-conducts']{.mark}**. That, [it is **impossible**]{.mark} [to
change]{.mark} **anything** [without changing]{.mark} the **[capitalist
order]{.mark}**. That, [planning has become]{.mark} so [**entangled**
with this order]{.mark} that it is **[not capable of alternative
actions]{.mark}**.]{.underline} While not underestimating the power of
structural forces and neoliberal techniques of governmentality, I would
argue that succumbing to pessimisms risks engendering hopelessness,
paralyzing actions, and evoking intellectual resignation. It blinds us
to the existence of 'the cracks in the system' (Holloway 2010).
[Resisting resignation is at the heart of prefigurative planning which
is founded on **post-foundational political theories** (Marchart 2007).
Rooted in Heidegger's philosophy, one of their key tenets is that,
'**[society]{.mark} does not have, [cannot have]{.mark}, and will never
have [a]{.mark} fixed, [solid]{.mark}, and ultimate foundation or
[grounding']{.mark}** (Fearn and Davoudi 2022, 351).]{.underline} The
'sheer contingency of any social order' (Rancière,1999, 16) opens up
possibilities for prefiguring counter-hegemonic alternatives. Its
fleeting and temporary nature produces opportunities for stopping
domination from becoming a faith accompli (Scott 1990).

Exploring these openings requires a 'decolonization of the imaginary'
(Latouche 2009, 95). Negation of the given and 'disagreement' (Rancière
1999) with how things are made produce spaces for re-imagining how they
might be unmade. [Negation rejects the **positivist 'demarcation** of
what is real and what is not, what exists and what does not' (Dinerstein
2015, 62). For Ernst Bloch, whose conceptualization of hope is central
to the understanding of prefigurative planning, 'the Real is process'.
It is the mediation 'between present, unfinished past, and above all:
possible future' (Bloch 1986 \[1957\], 196). [The real]{.mark} always
**[encapsulates within]{.mark} it [the not yet]{.mark}.** 'The not yet
that inhabits [the real is **not unreal but unrealised**]{.mark}
(Dinerstein 2015, 62 original emphasis). [Negation]{.mark} exposes the
'ossified concept of reality' that [seeks to **foreclose**]{.mark} **the
[possibility of alternatives and deny the]{.mark} ontology of
['Not-Yet']{.mark}** (Bloch 1986, 196).]{.underline}

As a key constituent of prefigurative planning, negation renders visible
that which has been made invisible by techno-rationalist planning to
legitimise its 'parameters of legibility' (Vazquez 2011, 28). Denouncing
these parameters demands critically engaging with the everyday politics
of calculative and objectivized reality-fixing practices in planning.
2280 S. DAVOUDI For planning scholarship this means radical critiques of
the given, communicated through multiple media, beyond the academic
press. For planning practice, it means the refutation of calculative
practices, such as those used to account for housing land supply.
Calculative practices 'do not merely record a reality independent of
themselves; they contribute powerfully to shaping, simply by measuring
it, the reality that they measure' (Callon 1998: 23). In the case of
housing, they have turned planning into 'the supply-side of land
financialisation' (Bradley 2021, 389) in many parts of the world (see
examples in Aalbers 2016).

[[Prefigurative planning]{.mark} is as much about envisioning
alternatives as it [is about **rejecting the s**]{.mark}**tatus
[quo.]{.mark}** In the wider context of social transformation, Santos
(2004) suggests that [we need]{.mark} both a '**sociology of absences'**
and a '**sociology of emergences'**. The former makes visible that which
is 'actively **produced as non-existent** \[..\] as [a]{.mark}
**non-[credible alternative to what exists']{.mark}** (Santos 2004,
293).]{.underline} The latter helps to 'identify and enlarge the signs
of possible future experiences, under the guise of tendencies and
latencies, that are actively ignored by hegemonic rationality and
knowledge' (Santos 2004, 241). In other words, the latter helps us to
explore and identify 'the conditions of the possibility of hope' (Santos
2004, 241), and how those condition might be realized. Paraphrasing
Levitas (2013), a focus on emergences enables a return to planning's
crucial role in creation of utopia; a role that was supressed in order
for it to become a reputable social science (Davoudi and Pendlebury
2010).

Exploring the not-yet possibilities invokes hope. But, this is not
abstract and fanciful hope; it is radical and transformative hope. It is
based not on wishful thinking, but on wilful action that arises from
informed discontent with the present and invokes our 'anticipatory
consciousness' (Bloch 1986, 18). [As 'a **praxis-oriented category**'
(Levitas 1990a, 18), it urges us to **[step out of the
present]{.mark}**, 'rather than remain hopeful in it' (Wrangel 2014,
194, original emphasis). It is this 'concretely genuine hope' that
underpins Bloch's (1986, 56) philosophy of 'concert utopia'. Here,
'**[utopia is]{.mark} \[...\] [no longer 'nowhere']{.mark}**, as an
Other to real history. [It is a **constituent element of**]{.mark} **all
[human activity']{.mark}** (Bronner 1997, 166).]{.underline}

I will return to this, but first we need to remind ourselves that
utopian thinking is not new to planning. On the contrary, envisioning
better places runs through its history, motivating its early twentieth
century projects such as Garden City movements. For Ebenezer Howard, a
garden city was, above all, a 'Social City'; a cooperative, commonwealth
alternative to the capitalist cities of the time. Much of the early
modernist urban planning was also in pursuit of creating utopia. The
influential 'functional city' of the Congrès Internationaux
d'Architecture Moderne (CIAM) aspired to be 'a city of salvation' (Dear
1995, 33) in which 'the disposition of the land \[...\] will satisfy the
needs of the many as well as those of the individual' (CIAM 1933).
However, the utopia of modernist planning was an ideal end-state,
designed and executed from the top down, by an 'elitist and alienating'
agenda (Ley and Mills 1993, 268). Much of it was inspired by Le
Corbusier's EUROPEAN PLANNING STUDIES 2281 model of scrapping the old,
unplanned, irrational city, and building on a blank canvas according to
a rigid blueprint drawn by perceived all-knowing expert planners
(Davoudi and Madanipour 2012). As Bauman (2003, 15) put it, the
modernist utopia 'is a vision of predesigned world, a world in which
prediction and planning stave off the play of chance'.

We know too well, not least from Jane Jacobs (1961) powerful critique,
that the unifying prescriptions of grandiose modernist utopianism led to
the death of great American cities and left a trail of 'great planning
disasters' (Hall 1980) in towns and cities elsewhere. It is, therefore,
not surprising that by the 1990s critics proclaimed 'The End of Utopia'
(Bann 1993) and the 'death of urban visions' (Gold 1985). That, 'the
idea that history contains possibility of freedom \[...\] hardly tapped
\[...\] is stone dead' (Jacoby 1999). Imagining how we might be
otherwise has since become a more cynical endeavour than accepting the
normalized status quo. [Planning is now more at ease with accommodating
the '**normalized "today**"' rather than pursuing '**the transformation
of reality'** (Freire 2005 \[1970\], 92). From the ashes of modernist
planning, which became subject to a growing critique by feminist,
radical and indigenous planners and activists, rose different forms of
antiutopian postmodernism. While these rightly advocate a more
'incremental movement rather than cataclysmic changes' (Goldberger 1977,
257) that are akin to prefigurative panning, some are rooted in a
'complacent brand of new 'realism'' (Pinder 2022, 235) which turns away
from the negation of the present and utopic visions. The consequences of
such 'realism' are highlighted by Boyer (1994, 476):]{.underline}

[Furthermore, a distressing irony is that the collapse of modernist
utopianism has not stopped the rise of 'multiple degenerate utopias that
now surround us' (Harvey 2000, 168). These segregated, commercialized
spaces of gated communities, techno-topias and eco-topias 'instantiate
rather than critique the idea that 'there is no alternative'' (Harvey,
2000, 168). It appears that the vacuum created by the decline of
progressive urban imagination has been occupied by 'utopic
degeneration']{.underline} (Marin 1990 \[1972\]).

#### Prefigurative fiat is legitimate and inevitable. All arguments are utopian, including the 1AC---pretending otherwise [cedes imaginative terrain]{.underline} to the Right.

Prospects for a Prefigurative Strategy toward Open Utopia,"

Another reason, not yet mentioned, motivates me to urge the left to take
utopia seriously--- [[power reproduces]{.mark} itself [through
**concealing** its]{.mark} own [utopianism]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
election of Donald Trump for many has generated a mood where [utopia
seems the **farthest removed** topic for discussion]{.underline} from
current predicaments. But in fact, Trump's invocation of
"**[[ma]{.underline}]{.mark}**king America great
a**[[ga]{.underline}]{.mark}**in" [[reveals]{.mark} the power of
**utopian narratives**]{.underline}. Comparing Trump's and Clinton's
campaign slogans is revelatory, as Trump's promise of "renewal" or
"redemption" was countered with Clinton's individualistic promotion "I'm
with her." Clinton's slogan was a far departure from Democrat's recent
successful [rhetorical flourishes]{.underline} of "hope" and "change,"
buzzwords that [invite the imagination to **run wild**]{.underline}.
Clinton's campaign slogan insisted on voters identifying with the
candidate specifically. While the idea of little girls being motivated
by the presence of a powerful woman president may seem a great tool for
inspiring voters, the reality is that working class women (and the
broader working class in general) do not see themselves reflected in the
successes of upper-class white women.

At the same time, Trump did project a vision that appealed to voters,
particularly white voters, and this vision is similar to the utopianism
that lay at the founding of the U.S. America was seen as a utopian
project, the "New World" and "a shining city upon a hill" as put by the
puritan John Winthrop. Such [utopian vision]{.underline} still
[**permeates** this country]{.underline}, [and Trump tapped into its
narrative power]{.underline}. Therefore, [what we witnessed]{.underline}
in Trump's election [was [a **battle of competing utopias**]{.mark}
where reactionary utopia proved victorious]{.underline}.

[Utopia]{.underline} is invoked in reactionary political campaigns, and
[seeps into the]{.underline} "**[common sense]{.underline}**" [of status
quo]{.underline} ideology. David Harvey exposes this in his exploration
of [free market ideologies]{.underline}, with their mantras of an
"invisible hand" balancing an unfettered market and insistence that the
arc of history is progressive. "The most effective Utopians in recent
times," he discovers, "have been those of a right-wing persuasion"
(2000:176-177). But "[the utopian **rhetoric**]{.underline} of freedom,
liberty, and markets [conceals **so effectively**]{.underline} \[[their
utopian **content**]{.underline}\] [that we often find it **difficult**
to articulate the pattern of underlying coerced collaborations that
otherwise stares us **so blatantly** in the face]{.underline}" (Harvey
2000:181).

Adding to this, David Graeber points out that [modern
[bureaucracy]{.mark}]{.underline}, [itself **based** in utopian
aspirations]{.underline}, [also **[conceals]{.mark}** its [utopian
underpinnings]{.mark}]{.underline}. Graeber contends that "what
ultimately lies [[behind]{.underline}]{.mark} the appeal of [bureaucracy
is **[fear of play]{.mark}**]{.underline}" (2015:193). Play is defined
as "[the free expression of creative energies]{.underline}...[for its
own sake]{.underline}" (2015:192). [Games]{.underline}, conversely, [are
**bounded by rules** with clear objectives]{.underline}. [Following [the
rules]{.mark}]{.underline}, in games, actually [allows the player the
opportunity to **win the game**]{.underline}. Graeber contends that
"[bureaucracies [create games]{.mark}]{.underline}---they're just games
[[that are **in no sense fun**]{.underline}]{.mark}" (2015:190). By
understanding and obeying the rules of the game (the rules of governance
by administration), players can win, in essence, at the games of life.
"[[Games]{.underline}]{.mark}, then, [[are a]{.underline}]{.mark} kind
of **[[utopia of rules]{.underline}]{.mark}**" (2015:191). Therefore,
even [[in our **arguments**]{.underline}]{.mark} on democracy versus
republicanism, [[we are engaging in a **duel of
utopias**]{.underline}]{.mark}. He concludes:

\[Utopian bureaucracy has\] created a situation where the pursuit of
freedom from arbitrary power simply ends up producing more arbitrary
power, and as a result, regulations choke existence, armed guards and
surveillance cameras appear everywhere, science and creativity are
smothered, and all of us end up finding increasing percentages of our
day taken up in the filling out of forms. (Graeber 2015:205)

[Since the right **maintains power** on the basis of its utopian
content]{.underline}, [needed now is]{.underline} the generation of [a
**mobilizing conception** of utopia for our left movements]{.underline}.
Notwithstanding my previous criticisms, one very hopeful element in the
2016 election cycle appeared in Bernie Sanders ability to galvanize
people by promoting "political revolution." [[Though]{.mark} the
**[details]{.mark}**]{.underline} of his political revolution [[left
**much** to the imagination]{.underline}]{.mark}, [the real source of
[optimism is found in the **energies unleashed** by]{.mark} millions of
people in [pushing for]{.mark} **dramatic changes** in the here and
now]{.underline}. Therefore, [revolution is **back on the
table**]{.underline}, [and **[utopia fixed to revolutionary
projects]{.mark}** is precisely the direction we need to
take]{.underline}. [Generating a utopia needs to employ a radical
imagination which]{.underline} is not afraid, and indeed
**[insists]{.underline}**, [upon a **total social
revolution**]{.underline} against the totality of capitalism. [If the
left does not generate a **more inspired vision**]{.underline}, [we will
continue to be **defeated** by the utopian projects of the
right]{.underline}.

How do we find each other for the project of collective utopian
dreaming? Answering this question demonstrates the need for the [radical
imagination]{.underline}, as its incorporation [of the
**prefigurative**]{.underline} and strategic [**aligns** our shared
projects in **locating spaces** for charting revolutionary
goals]{.underline}. [This means discovering the **cracks** in
capitalism]{.underline}, [and using these cracks for revolutionary
actions that can **initiate intentional ruptures** within capitalism's
totality]{.underline}. We will find, in our movement, that [there can be
**no single vanguard** leading this campaign but a **collection** of
vanguards connecting multiple centers together]{.underline}.
Additionally, it will be apparent that [injecting democracy
into]{.underline} these centers---[these spaces]{.underline}---[will
**reorient** authority and power giving our movements a **stronger
position** in which we can deploy **more durable** revolutionary
forces]{.underline}.

The road ahead is necessarily long, [[revolution will not be a
**single**]{.mark} **momentous [event]{.mark}** [but an
**accumulation**]{.mark} of social energies]{.underline} (signaling the
importance of cracks and ruptures in the prevailing social order). We
should not mourn this fact. As noted above, oppression is not always
obvious to the oppressed, and since none of us are outside of society
this means that we are inundated today with oppressions we are probably
not even aware exist. [Revolutionary processes will allow us to gain
**deeper insights** into]{.underline} the true meaning of freedom and
liberation, where [the oppressions we are oblivious to
today]{.underline} will be the target of future generations that take
the reins of revolution. This is only possible in the action of
revolution, as the direction of tomorrow does not follow a predetermined
arc of progress; the direction is made. For us, [we need to craft
**prefigurative strategies** for moving forward]{.underline}. The
following is my attempt at sketching what this might look like in
action.

Occupy Wall Street offered a window into understanding the importance of
democratic daily life. By prioritizing the setting-up of encampments in
public parks OWS highlighted the significance of democratic process and
deliberation. Occupation was the tactic, and it was coupled with an idea
that we could use these seized spaces as democratic public spheres.
Capitalist totality seeks the privatization of all space---thus the
domination of space entirely. For occupiers, public parks were small
cracks in the advance of capitalist totality. Public space is merely the
inverse of private space---as what is not private is publically
administered by the state and thus void of democratic control. However,
the general population tends to view public spaces in a positive light,
signaling their rough belief in the need for shared and open spaces. So
[OWS filled the]{.underline} (ideological) [cracks with its own set of
**ideals**]{.underline}, [its own **utopian project**]{.underline}, [and
immediately sought to **cultivate**]{.underline} these cracks as spaces
for genuinely open participation [and]{.underline} deep democracy. In
this regard, "the space of Occupy was not only physical, but also
symbolic" (Goodewardena 2016:409).

The cracks of public parks were used to confront alienation, but they
also offered a glimpse on how to [**connect** the cracks]{.underline}.
One of the magical moments of OWS was when [it went from
being]{.underline} an **[isolated]{.underline}** protest tactic in an
obscure New York City park [to spreading like **wildfire**]{.underline}
across the country and [around the **globe**]{.underline}. Park
[occupation had a **strategic brilliance** based on its
**simplicity**]{.underline}, which ran as follows: we can turn our
public park into a site of democracy, and so can you. It invited
ordinary people from all over to engage in the same type of activity.
[No longer was it seen as necessary to **lobby one's congressperson** or
go through the **formal political channels** to be active in
politics]{.underline}, instead you could just take a walk through the
park and engage in political **[[debate]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
deliberation, and decision-making. What could be more utopian? OWS
offered a view of one way our movements [[can create]{.mark} **visible
[entry-points]{.mark}** for the public at large to enter into movement
actions]{.underline}---thus they (temporarily) seized spaces for
revolutionary (re)production. OWS offered many insights, both through
its successes and limitations, and one particular insight is on needing
to hold these spaces of revolutionary (re)production longer.

Practically speaking, these spaces could be formed by tying together
projects for community land trusts with cooperative businesses54 and
local political efforts (whether referendums, issue-oriented
[[mobilizations]{.underline}]{.mark}, etc.) all oriented toward
establishing present-day commons. Organized labor, Black Lives Matter
chapters, environmental organizations, indigenous tribes, and offshoots
of Occupy Wall Street (such as Occupy Homes) [[could **unify** around
these]{.mark} broad-based efforts]{.underline}. Indeed, contemporary
movements appear to be shifting in a direction which understands the
importance of space. Writes Kanishka Goonewardena, "the events of the
Arab Spring...and the Occupy Movement...revealed that 'space' is both an
essential mediation of politics and an unmediated object of political
struggle" (2016:408). [Spaces can become **blocs of
power**]{.underline}, interlacing land, politics, and economics with
prefigurative practices of care work and democratic social life. [[By
seizing **space**]{.underline}, [instead of
**states**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [our [prefigurative
strategies]{.mark}]{.underline} do the work of creating communities
bounded by more than their geographical or national character. They
[[create **resistance communities**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

#### Reasonability. Our model is ordered, even if not formally organized; limits and ground can be [emergent]{.underline}, not [pre-decided]{.underline}. 

**Laamanen, 22**---Associate Professor in Marketing in the Lifestyle
Research Centre at EMLyon Business School (Mikko, "Organizing
Prefiguration," *The Future Is Now: An Introduction to Prefigurative
Politics*, Chapter 13, pp. 192-195, dml)

**[[Prefigurative]{.underline}]{.mark}** initiatives contain much of
both of these foci (and **[[debates]{.underline}]{.mark}**), in that
they [**politicize** formal modalities of organizing]{.underline}.
Context and [practices for]{.underline} organizing [prefiguration are
those that **challenge** the prevailing status quo]{.underline} of the
political, cultural and economic order. [Prefigurative initiatives
[position]{.mark} themselves against repressive]{.underline}, unequal
[institutions by creating alternatives]{.underline} through inclusive,
reflexive practice [[aim]{.mark}ing [to]{.mark} **radically
[restructure]{.mark}** the social order]{.underline}, [[rather
than]{.mark} attempting to **[reform]{.mark}** it]{.underline}. Their
political acts connect to countercultural lifestyles within
purpose-built counter-institutions that organize with a horizontal
orientation and practice egalitarian modes of interacting (Dixon, 2014).
Democratic work organizations represent alternative institutions in
which internal interactions restrict administration through inclusive
decision-making practices (Kokkinidis, 2015; Jaumier, 2016).
Countercultural lifestyles foster solidarity by localizing resources and
relations in collaborative production and consumption (Forno and
Graziano, 2014; Laamanen et al, 2018; Laamanen and Wahlen, 2019; Forno
and Wahlen, this volume). Lifestyle movements as counter-institutions
are diffuse in their organizational practices, and their shared values
and moral vision(s) connect everyday acts of personal and social
transformation. Thus, [while organization may have become less visibly
manifested]{.underline}, [organizing **has not
disappeared**]{.underline}. Melucci (1996) observes how (new) social
movements wane in visibility during moments of movement latency and
visibility. During latency, a movement engages in the strategic
construction of future utopian realities; in contrast, when it is
directly confronted by the dominant ideology and institutions, it is
rendered visible. Prefiguration connects intimately with such internal
and external dynamics of organizing, moving our focus from the entity
(organization) to the acts of organizing (de Bakker et al, 2017).
[[Looking for]{.mark} organizations]{.underline}, [or those [**formal
entities** that prefigurative organizing aims to
**avoid**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[leads to]{.mark} the probable
[conclusion that formalization]{.mark}]{.underline} and oligarchization
[[are **unavoidable**]{.mark} and that prefigurative organizing will
**fail**]{.underline} (Breines, 1980). Instead, [in prefigurative
organizing]{.underline}, [organization as an entity becomes
**reimagined** and **transformed** in experimentation with the kind of
social order that is **locally preferred**]{.underline}.

This represents a dilemma for prefigurative organizing and leads to the
question: [how can]{.underline}/do/ will [participants navigate between
the **impossibility** of structure and the **impracticality** of
openness?]{.underline} Practically, [even the most anti-authoritarian
initiative may exercise **some** authority over
participants]{.underline} or decision- making [so as to coordinate
activities]{.underline}, [manage scale and sustain action]{.underline}.
[Organizing [prefiguration]{.mark} entails how participants
**[navigate]{.mark} the tension** between [structure and
openness]{.mark}]{.underline} within their initiative, [over
time]{.underline}, [by **blending**]{.underline} elements constituting a
[formal organization and]{.underline} those present in
[non-organizations]{.underline} (Laamanen et al, 2020).

Blending social order in prefigurative organizing

Maintaining social order and attempting to change it are fundamentally
questions of organizing. Ahrne and Brunsson (2011) developed a typology
of elements that represent a decided (social) order. [Decisions made
on]{.underline} membership, hierarchy, **[rules]{.underline}**,
monitoring [and **sanctions** constitute]{.underline} the
**[[formality]{.underline}]{.mark}** in an organization. In formal
organizations, [decisions on these elements are made by]{.underline}
(qualified) [decision-makers]{.underline}, [in whom]{.underline} other
organizational [members vest such power]{.underline}. [The
ensuing]{.underline} hierarchy entails an [organization of
power]{.underline} that [[**obliges** compliance]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[Membership outlines who can **legitimately participate**]{.underline}
-- [and]{.underline}, consequently, [who is **excluded**]{.underline}.
[[Rules are]{.mark} pronounced **[commands]{.mark}** that members are to
follow]{.underline}. [[Obedience is monitored and
**sanctions**]{.underline}]{.mark} ([[and
**rewards**]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[awarded based
on]{.underline}]{.mark} the monitored behaviours. In [[this
**framework**]{.underline}]{.mark}, organization is partial (not fully
formal) when decisions are made on some (but not all) of the elements;
nevertheless, even in partially organized settings, decisions are made.

[[An **emergent** order]{.mark} **counterpoints** the decided
order]{.underline}. [Participation [maintains]{.mark} a
**[form]{.mark}** of social order [while remaining
**anti-organizational**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Polletta, 2002; de Bakker
et al, 2017). [Participation respects the autonomy of
[individuals]{.mark} to [act]{.mark} towards social change]{.underline},
[[in a **self-governed**]{.mark} and **self-organized**
[manner]{.mark}]{.underline}, [within their **everyday
contexts**]{.underline} (Laamanen et al, 2018; Forno and Wahlen, this
volume). At the same time, [[**shared beliefs** and
**values**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [acknowledging one another and
recognizing correct practice **[ensures]{.mark} social**]{.underline}
([and **moral**]{.underline}) **[[control]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(Wilhoit and Kisselburgh, 2015; Daskalaki et al, 2018; Laamanen et al,
2018). Effectively, in an emergent order, [[participants]{.mark} tend to
come to [accept things as]{.mark} they are
[practised]{.mark}]{.underline}, [**[without formal rules]{.mark}** and
**decisions**]{.underline}: by contrast, [[cohesion relies on
**routine**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [**habit** [and
**adaptation**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Laamanen et al, 2019). [Emergence
in [prefigurative]{.mark}]{.underline}, lifestyle [counter-institutions
**contours action**]{.underline} in two ways. First, the
[internal]{.underline} '[**[structures]{.underline}**']{.mark} of
prefigurative organizing spaces are '[characterized by a **minimal
division** of labour]{.underline}, [decentralized
authority]{.underline}, [and an egalitarian ethos and]{.underline} ...
[decision-making is **direct** and **consensus oriented**]{.underline}'
(Polletta, 2002, p 6). Second, the configurations of authority are
'managed' through rotating responsibilities and inclusive governance
structures, such as spokes councils (Sutherland et al, 2014; Kinna et
al, 2019).

[Affiliation]{.underline}, [horizontal participation]{.underline},
[norms and values]{.underline}, [social control through mutual
observation and intrinsic motivation [are]{.mark} sources of **emergent
social order** and [**functional equivalents** to **decided order
elements**]{.mark}]{.underline} (see Table 13.1) (Laamanen et al, 2020).
In the following illustration, I draw on participatory research
engagement [in an **alternative currency community**]{.underline} -- the
Stadin Aikapankki (STAP, Helsinki Timebank) -- to demonstrate how these
elements and their blending are empirically observable in prefigurative
organizing.

#### No link to \[their offense\]. Prefigurative utopias are concrete, empirical, and debatable.

**Clarence-Smith, 22**---founding member of The Auroville Research
Platform, affiliated with the Sri Aurobindo International Institute of
Educational Research (Suryamayi Aswini, "Prefiguration and Utopia: The
Auroville Experiment," *The Future Is Now: An Introduction to
Prefigurative Politics*, Chapter 7, pp. 107-109, dml)

This forms the basis of [the conceptual differentiation]{.underline}
Bloch makes [between]{.underline} '**[abstract]{.underline}**'
[and]{.underline} '**[concrete]{.underline}**' [utopia]{.underline} (see
Bloch, 1986; Levitas, 1997), which [has significant implications for how
we **evaluate**]{.underline} utopian -- and, eventually,
'**[prefiguratively utopian]{.underline}**' (Clarence-Smith, 2019) --
[practice]{.underline}. [An **[abstract]{.mark}** conceptualization of
[utopia has **no**]{.mark} **inherent [connection]{.mark}** [with
reality]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and has contributed to the narrative that
utopian practice is a **groundless** and **futile**
endeavour]{.underline}; in Bloch's words, '\[p\]ure wishful thinking,
which has discredited utopias for centuries, both in pragmatic political
terms and in all other expressions of what is desirable; just as if
every utopia were an abstract one' (1986, p 145). By contrast, [a
**concrete** utopia articulates]{.underline}, [and is anticipatory
of]{.underline}, [the development of]{.underline}
'**[tendencies]{.underline}**' or 'latencies' [existing in the
present]{.underline} (Bloch, 1986, p 223; see also Dinerstein, 2017).

This understanding of a concrete utopia has been key to identifying a
utopian praxis, and to defining a broad range of collective practices
engaged in such praxis as being utopian. [A [concrete utopia is
**rooted** in]{.mark} and **transformative** of [the
present]{.mark}]{.underline} -- however compromised and contradictory an
evolutionary process -- [and **actively mediates** between aspiration
and present conditions]{.underline}. [[Such utopias
include]{.underline}]{.mark}, most notably, 'hope movements' (social
mobilizations for autonomy that arise from popular aspirations for
alternative paradigms to statist and neoliberal development agendas)
(Dinerstein and Deneulin, 2012) and economic experiments that prefigure
alternatives to capitalism: 'real utopias' (Wright, 2010), 'nowtopias'
(Carlsson and Manning, 2010) and 'current utopias' (Martell, 2018) such
as [[cooperatives]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[time
banks]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[participatory budgeting]{.mark}
practices]{.underline}, [reconverted factories]{.underline},
[[free]{.mark} alternative [universities]{.mark}]{.underline}, [urban
gardens [and]{.mark} do-it-yourself [collectives]{.mark}]{.underline}
(see Monticelli, this volume and also Monticelli, 2018).

In recent years, a variety of social phenomena that actively seek to
effect positive social change -- protests, practices and performances
across realms from the arts to politics -- have increasingly been framed
as utopian practice (Dinerstein and Deneulin, 2012; Cooper, 2014).
Historically, the locus of utopian practice has been intentional
communities; [these remain **significant** given their potential to
experiment with transforming societies as **whole
entities**]{.underline}, albeit at a micro level. Recently, scholars
have also started adopting the concept of prefiguration to describe
these, given that they are a radical, embodied exercise in redefining
society according to alternative values -- of the present, for the
future (Farias, 2017; Monticelli, 2018; Clarence- Smith and Monticelli,
2022).

Utopian practice and prefiguration

In my work, I further the collective theorization of utopian practice
outlined in this chapter by qualifying it as prefigurative
(Clarence-Smith, 2019). I do so given that [the practice of
prefiguration is one in which a collective **emulates in the present**
the attitudes]{.underline}, [social relations]{.underline}, [culture and
organization it envisions for the future]{.underline}, through
'experimental and experiential' means (van de Sande, 2015, p 189).
Scholarship on prefiguration emerged from and has remained focused on
political practice, with a few recent diversions, notably into economic
and environmental practices (Mason, 2014; Monticelli, 2018). I believe
prefigurative action and conceptualization stands to significantly gain
in breadth and bearing from bridging with utopian practice given that
the latter encapsulates a vast range of human activity -- from art and
technology to governance, economy and education -- that seeks to
transform human society (Cooper, 2014; Clarence- Smith, 2019).

The restrictive scope of strategic political practice is perhaps why
prefiguration is barely even conceptually associated with utopianism. A
few scholars of prefiguration mention in passing that [[prefigurative
action embodies]{.underline}]{.mark} 'utopic' or
'**[utopian]{.underline}**' **[alternatives]{.underline}** (see Juris,
2008; Yates, 2015), but rare are those who actually engage with
contemporary theorizations of utopian practice in doing so (Dinerstein
and Deneulin, 2012; Monticelli, 2018). Political practice alone,
however, is not going to construct an alternative society, while the
actors of prefigurative politics are driven precisely by the prospect of
living in one. My father, who joined Auroville in 1975, was one of the
young protestors who barricaded the streets of London in the late 1960s
and early 1970s; but unlike his friends at the time, who focused on
'[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} revolution', his [**burning
[question]{.mark}** was]{.underline}: **[[what are we going to do once
we win?]{.underline}]{.mark}** In Auroville, a multifaceted work in
progress towards a new society, he found his answer. [By
[remaining]{.mark}]{.underline} as **[[exclusive]{.underline}]{.mark}**
as it is today, [the conceptualization]{.underline} and ensuing
ethnographic focus [of]{.underline} scholarship on [prefiguration [does
a **disservice**]{.mark} to its underlying project and
potential]{.underline} (Clarence- Smith, 2019).

I do not propose that prefigurative practice should de facto be
considered utopian, or that utopian and prefigurative practices should
be indiscriminately conflated. What I do propose is that we consider
certain forms of utopian practice to be **[prefigurative]{.underline}**
-- namely, experimental [attempts to **embody utopian alternatives** to
existing practices and forms of relating and organizing]{.underline},
which [are **strategic** in that they **engage in** and **propel** an
evolution towards these alternatives]{.underline} (Clarence- Smith,
2019). Ethnographic examples of the latter are explored here in the
context of the intentional community Auroville.

### Alt---Prefiguration---2NC---AT: Prefiguration Fails

#### Prefiguration inspires radical struggle and makes resistance more effective [even when it fails]{.underline}.

**Dinerstein and Pitts, 22**---Associate Professor in Political
Sociology, University of Bath; PhD researcher on the ESRC Global
Political Economy pathway in the Department of Social and Policy
Sciences at the University of Bath and the School of Sociology, Politics
and International Studies at the University of Bristol (Ana and
Frederick, "Prefiguration and the Futures of Work," *The Future Is Now:
An Introduction to Prefigurative Politics*, Chapter 6, pp. 100-101, dml)

The previous sections exposed struggle and contradiction as essential
elements of prefiguration, foreshadowing alternative futures in the here
and now. This dimension of struggle in the prefiguration process has
been neglected by neo-anarchist scholar--activists theorizing radical
change. Regarded as a central tenet of autonomous movements, such as
Occupy Wall Street, the term '[prefigurative politics]{.underline}' has
recently been deployed to [explain the strategy]{.underline} of social
movements [to enact]{.underline}, [in the **present**]{.underline}, [the
society we want to see in the **future**]{.underline} (Maeckelbergh,
2011, this volume). [Prefigurative politics can also mean the
**experience** of creating]{.underline} horizontal and democratic
[organizations and relations that]{.underline} can serve a broader
political process, or that [embody the new]{.underline}, thus
potentially **[generating revolutionary consciousness]{.underline}**
(Raekstad, 2017).

For us, meanwhile, prefiguration is a collective process of steering
through the contradictions of the capital relation in specific,
historically contextualized struggles, which today are mainly around
issues of social reproduction. Social [struggles create]{.underline}
'**[surplus possibilities]{.underline}**' (Gibson- Graham, 2006), or
what one of us calls 'excess' (Dinerstein, 2015). Excess emerges [from
the process of **translation** of our radical praxis into the grammar of
**order** led by the state]{.underline} (Dinerstein 2015). As argued
elsewhere, 'translation' refers to the processes, mechanisms and
dynamics [through which]{.underline} autonomous [organizing
is]{.underline} either [integrated]{.underline}, invisibilized
[or]{.underline} politically [obliterated]{.underline}. The question of
translation begs the question of untranslatability: 'what is that which
remains untranslatable, outside the scope of translation? What is
excluded from its movement of incorporation?' (Vázquez, 2011, p 36).
Excess is then [an **untranslatable aspect** of]{.underline} the
prefigurative [praxis]{.underline} that is still unnamed and could even
be -- paraphrasing Bloch -- undecided material, but [constitutes both a
**threat** to capital and a **source of inspiration** for the
movements]{.underline}. These possibilities are untranslatable into
conventional social sciences epistemology. As Neary (2019) puts it, 'the
power of the focus on Marx's value-form is not simply to suggest an
alternative form of social epistemology but a radical epistemology of
the social'. This radical epistemology enables a 'prefigurative critique
of political economy' that, with Ernst Bloch, reads Marx's critique of
political economy in the key of hope, so as to grasp prefiguration as a
radical praxis against and beyond the value-form (Dinerstein, 2016, this
volume). Thus, [we see prefiguration not as the result of the
**process** of creating a new society in the present]{.underline}, [but
as the result of a **struggle** with]{.underline}, [against and beyond
the mediations of the capitalist social relations]{.underline}. The
[alternative forms]{.underline} of mediating social reproduction
[**could not have been thought** before subjects involved themselves in
prefigurative collective actions]{.underline}, focusing on and dealing
with precisely those real abstractions that mediate the creation of
possibilities both in and beyond capitalist reality. The excess that
emerges from the process of steering through real abstractions (or
mediations) is highly likely to disappoint; however, **[even in its
failure]{.underline}**, [it has an **inevitable impact** on the form of
the mediation]{.underline} -- be that the state, money or the law.

But [[capitalism's]{.underline} global nature [means that
revolts]{.underline} tend to spread across national borders.
[Workers]{.underline}]{.mark} [today [share]{.mark} increasingly
[similar experiences]{.mark}]{.underline}: conditions of work, forms of
consumption, lifestyles and political cultures. [And the global
integration of production serves to transmit struggle from one country
to another]{.underline}. In 1974, for instance, resistance to the brutal
military dictatorship in Chile spread to East Kilbride, Scotland, of all
places. Workers at the Rolls Royce factory there learned that the
engines they were repairing were being used by the Chilean air force to
drop bombs on workers resisting the coup. They downed tools and refused
to work on the engines, keeping them out of the hands of the military
junta for four years.

While nationalism still has a powerful hold on the consciousness of
many, it's increasingly clear that [the real line of
[polarisation]{.mark} across the globe [is between the minority ruling
class and the majority working class]{.mark}]{.underline}. [And when
revolts break out in one part of the world, people can identify with the
causes and motivations of their struggles]{.underline}, and draw
comparisons with their own situation. "Languages remain different,"
observed UK Marxist Chris Harman in 1992, "but what they say is
increasingly the same". Harman's words ring true in every wave of
political radicalisation.

1968 is remembered as a year of global revolt, when millions of workers,
students and oppressed people drew inspiration from each other's
movements. Activists in the US were radicalised by the heroic resistance
of the Vietnamese people to American imperialism. Irish civil rights
activists emulated the militant politics of the Black Panthers. When
students and workers united to launch a massive general strike in France
in May, it taught student radicals in Australia that they needed to link
up with the power of the organised working class in order to win.

The movements of 1968 united people across superficially very different
societies. For decades, Cold War common sense had dictated that the
greatest divide on the planet was between Western liberal capitalism and
Stalinist "Communism". But in 1968, both sides of the iron curtain
exploded in revolt. The triggers for the struggles may have been
different, but they were all responses to similar issues: inequality,
exploitation and war, imposed by monstrous bureaucratic states.

[In [2011, a poor Tunisian street vendor set himself alight to protest
against police harassment]{.mark}]{.underline}. Within days, [his act
had inspired anti-government protests across the country]{.underline}.
Within weeks, [the [protests escalated into a
]{.mark}]{.underline}[regional revolt]{.mark} [that challenged regimes
[across the Arab world]{.mark}]{.underline}. [One small act tapped into
resentment]{.underline} against inequality, unemployment and state
violence [that engulfed an entire region]{.underline}. The radical wave
spread even further: at a massive demonstration against an anti-union
bill in the US city of Madison, Wisconsin, a man held up a poster with a
picture of Egyptian dictator Hosni Mubarak beside Republican Governor
Scott Walker. The caption read: "One dictator down. One to go". [The
[Arab revolutions went on to inspire]{.mark} the [Occupy
movement]{.mark}, which [spread to]{.mark} more than]{.underline} [80
countries]{.mark}.

[Today, more than ever]{.mark}[, insurgent social [movements]{.mark} and
working-class uprisings [are spurring action in other parts of the
world]{.mark}]{.underline}---from Hong Kong to Chile, from Lebanon to
France. One placard at a memorial for protesters murdered while
resisting the military coup in Myanmar took up Marx's incitement:
"Workers of the world unite, you have nothing to lose but your chains".

While [the [Russian Revolution]{.mark}]{.underline} is cynically held up
by capitalist ideologists as the ultimate argument against international
revolution, it [actually]{.underline} proves the opposite. It [shows
that the goal is not only necessary, but also that it's
possible]{.underline}. The news of workers seizing power in Russia,
overthrowing their capitalist government and declaring their withdrawal
from WWI, [[created shock waves]{.underline} across the planet]{.mark}.
[[Workers in Germany rose]{.mark} in revolt [a year
later]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} ending the war for good and
building soviets, a form of radical working-class democracy inspired by
the Russian example. [[This was followed by uprisings in France, Italy
and Hungary]{.underline}.]{.mark}

[The revolutionary wave spread further]{.underline}. A classified
British government report from 1919 noted a "very widespread feeling
among workers that thrones have become anachronisms, and that the Soviet
may be the best form of Government for a democracy".

The rising tide of radicalism had an impact in Australia too.
Meatworkers in the Queensland city of Townsville donned red jumpers,
stormed the local police station to free jailed unionists, and placed
the city under workers' control. The editor of the conservative
Townsville Daily Bulletin lamented: "Townsville for the last year or so
has been developing Bolshevism \... the mob management of affairs in
this city, differs very little, from the Petrograd and Moscow brand".

[The Russian [Bolsheviks]{.mark}]{.underline}, the revolutionary
working-class party that led the revolution to victory in 1917, [[didn't
just passively wait for revolutions elsewhere]{.underline}. [They
actively organised to spread the revolt]{.underline}]{.mark}. In 1919,
[they [established the Communist International]{.mark}]{.underline}, an
organisation for debate, discussion and coordination between different
revolutionary workers' parties. Revolutionaries in Russia, Italy,
France, Germany, the US, Australia and elsewhere attempted to clarify
and develop a strategy for overthrowing capitalism everywhere. In none
of these countries was there a party like the Bolsheviks, steeled in
years of organising working-class struggle to overthrow the state, and
capable of leading a revolution. But [for a number of years, workers
came close to overthrowing capitalism in several countries.]{.underline}

[[In periods of stability]{.underline}]{.mark}, when social conservatism
dominates, [[international revolution can seem like a pipe
dream]{.underline}. Defenders of the status quo actively work to
reinforce this illusion. [But history proves that]{.underline}
]{.mark}[the]{.underline} [crises]{.mark} [that the system generates are
international, and that they will]{.underline} [inevitably provoke
international resistance]{.mark}.

[Capitalism]{.underline} is a global system. It requires a global
movement to tear it up, root and branch. But it also [makes global
revolution more possible, and more likely. [The most important thing

Arctic utopias

The [unknown and unexplored **[geographic peripheries]{.mark}** have
always [capture]{.mark}d the [**hopes** and
**dreams**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as well as the fears and nightmares,
[of the men at home in the core areas of international and national
power]{.underline}.1 [The question of what lies beyond [the edges of
civilisation]{.mark} has served as [a **blank canvas** and]{.mark} as a
[**catalyst** for]{.mark} stories about the **[possibilities]{.mark}**
waiting in the wild]{.underline} and unconquered corners of the world.
[These narratives are utopias]{.underline} in the broad analytic
definition of the term. [They are not mere **sources** of
**hope**]{.underline}, forms of social criticism or the products of a
distinctive literary genre, as utopias have traditionally been perceived
to be. [Rather, they are the **repositories** of **desires** generated
by certain conditions but left unfulfilled]{.underline}. In this
definition, [[**utopia** is **not** an **impossible
vision**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[It **need not** be **practically
possible**]{.mark}, [but it must]{.mark} at least [be **believed to be
so** to **mobilise**]{.mark} people to take action]{.underline}.2
[[Without]{.mark} such **[utopian narratives]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[the constitution and [mobilisation]{.mark} of political power at times
of insecurity]{.underline} and lack of natural scientific knowledge
[[would be]{.underline}]{.mark} difficult if not
**[[impossible]{.underline}]{.mark}**.3 [The world's [**northernmost**
regions are]{.mark}]{.underline} among [the peripheral areas where such
[realms of **possibility**]{.mark} have been imagined to
lie]{.underline}.

Since the dawn of the Renaissance when Ancient cartography was
rediscovered and exploration became one of the most important tools for
Western power politics, a [series of **utopian
discourses**]{.underline}, understood as expressions of the social,
technical and material desires for the unknown, [have taken hold of the
European, Russian and later the North American, conceptions of human
engagement with the Arctic]{.underline}. 4 [The [Arctic]{.mark} has been
[portrayed as]{.mark} a realm of **[econ]{.mark}omic
[prosperity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This material utopian vision of the
Arctic, which already **[mobilised]{.mark}** the [**merchants** and
**monarchs**]{.mark} of early modern Europe, consists mainly in the
promise of the **natural riches** and the open **shipping lanes** in the
North]{.underline}. It constituted power, for example, by inspiring
British expeditions seeking a northern sea route between Europe and the
Occident through the Arctic, first to the northeast in 1496 and then to
the northwest in 1553. One of the early Arctic visionaries behind the
utopian narratives was Gerard Mercator, whose polar concept influenced
much of the cartography of the sixteenth century.

> There is a straight and a short way open into the West even unto
> Cathay. Into which kingdome, if they take their course aright, they
> shall gather the most noble merchandise of all the worlde, and shall
> make the name of Christe to be knowne unto many idolatrous and Heathen
> people. (Gerard Mercator 1582^5^)

The search for shipping lanes and natural resources in the Arctic Ocean
was pursued by representatives of different nations until the Little Ice
Age, which lasted roughly from the late sixteenth until the early
nineteenth century, put a temporary halt to it. 6 The utopian narratives
of the Arctic were not, however, only linked to the spread of
mercantilism and modern political economy. With the spread of
nationalism in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the utopian
narratives of the Arctic were harnessed to serve nation-building
practices, which were part of the greater political project bound to
Arctic utopianism: the legitimisation of the domination of a territory.

In Canada, Vilhjálmur Stefansson, a Canadian Arctic explorer with
Icelandic roots, described a magnificent utopia of potential economic
development in the Arc- tic as the "Northward course of empire".7 What
is more, the country's first Prime Minister, John A. Macdonald, was, for
many, the embodiment of the Canadian past and future, the man who
defined Canada's western and Arctic frontiers, and he was therefore the
man who built the country. In the USA, after the purchase of Alaska, the
former US Treasury Secretary Robert John Walker argued for the purchase
of Greenland, as well as for the occupation of Iceland, for strategic
reasons. In Scandinavia, the Arctic explorations of the national hero of
Norway, Fridtjof Nansen, played a decisive role in the separation of
Norway from Sweden in 1905.8 At this time, the Arctic served not only as
a measure of national greatness but also as an arena for heroism and the
advancement of Western material, technological and cultural superiority.
It was thus used in the process of legitimising the expansion and
assumed superiority of Western high-modernist ideologies, and the
gradually progressing frontier of the European "useful arts", which in
the nineteenth century came to be known as technology.9 This was the
role the Arctic came to play in Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union as well.

In the Soviet Union, Stalin's dreams of "the Grand North", and its role
as one of the main scenes in the rapid modernisation and
industrialisation of the country, were captured in the first and second
Five-Year Plans from the late 1920s to the late 1930s. The primary aim
of these plans was to shift the Soviet Union's centre of economic
gravity to the north and to the east. 10

> The Arctic provided the ultimate battleground for the war against the
> environment ... The Soviet media portrayed the exploration of the
> North as a great military campaign. Glavsevmorput became an "army of

> films spoke of the "Arctic front" and celebrated every attack
> \[ataka\] and assault \[nastuplenie\]; they urged the country on to
> the final conquest \[zavoevanie\] of the Arctic. 11

The advancement of three more general political projects: legitimising
the domination of territory, the propagation of high modernist ideology
and the establishment of mercantilism, with political economy as its
successor, has created different socio- historical conditions for the
constitution and mobilisation of power through utopian narratives in the
Arctic. At specific moments, there has been a belief in the attain-
ability of these narratives, through which they have gained legitimacy
similar to that of scientific knowledge. They have, however, frequently
proven to be unattainable, incompatible with the natural constraints
that persist in the region as well as with the available technological
capacities and social possibilities. That is why, despite the recurrent
mobilisations of power for the exploration of these utopian narratives,
the Arctic of the early twenty-first century is not the glorified
materialisation of human innovation, technological advancement and
national prosperity asserted by the utopian Arctic narratives.

The economic structures in the North are narrowly based, with a strong
tendency towards monoculture. There is also a lack of stable road and
societal infrastructures within the existing settlements. 12 The
unprecedented effects of human-induced global climate change are already
visible in the region to a greater extent than in others areas of the
globe, as the Arctic will experience and has, together with the
Antarctic Peninsula, experienced the greatest regional warming in recent
decades due to climate change.13 The effects of climate change are, and
will be, most strongly felt in coastal regions, where damage from ice
activity and the flooding of structures such as bridges, pipelines,
drilling platforms and hydro- power facilities pose a major economic
threat and present serious risks for exist- ing and future
development.14 Regardless of these dire consequences of global warming,
utopian narratives of the Arctic, which focus on the promise of easier
access to the presumed riches of the North, have in fact been revived.
The Arctic utopias thus not only persist but have become integral to the
politics of the region, giving license to geopolitical projects and
constituting social and political power.

In May 2007, a private Russian expedition planted the Russian tricolour
flag on the ocean floor at the North Pole to which the Canadian
government responded aggressively stating that this was not the
fifteenth century and no one could claim territories by simple flag
planting.15 In fall 2007, satellite pictures of the Arctic Ocean showed
the Northwest Passage, for the first time since satellite monitoring in
the region began in 1978, to be completely free of ice.16 The incidents
triggered a host of academic literature in the political sciences as
well as journalistic deliberation on the new race to the Arctic and the
possibility of a looming resource war in the North.17 This debate was
heated, even though such assertions misrepresented the legal and
technical definitions of outer continental shelf delimitation. 18 The
events of 2007 nevertheless marked the re-entrance of sovereign-state
interests into the forefront of Arctic politics. In May 2008, the five
Arctic Ocean states adopted the Ilulissat Declaration, which affirmed
their commitment to the peaceful and sustainable development of the
northern territories according to international law.19 This commitment
included the costly and time-consuming mapping of the areas of the
Arctic seabed, to which the states could lay claim in their future
submissions to the United Nations Commission on the Limits of the
Continental Shelf (CLCS). 20 Further, since 2007, all of the eight
Arctic Council-defined Arctic states have adopted new official policies,
through which they discuss the developmental potential of the region and
how they will participate in its harnessing and governance.21

The [information]{.underline} we have [on the polar region is still
**insufficient**]{.underline}, largely [due to its extreme **geography**
and unpredictable weather and ice conditions]{.underline}, which is one
of the reasons why the mapping of the continental shelves of the Arctic
Ocean has been postponed until recently; the process is extremely costly
and unpredictable, and there has been no economically viable or legal
reason to do it until now.22 This also means that the [[**estimates** of
**oil** and **gas**]{.mark} deposits in the area]{.underline}, of which
the most widely quoted is from the US Geological Survey in 2008, which
states that the Arctic contains 30% of the world's undiscovered gas and
13% of its oil, [are based on **probability** and **statistics** rather
than accurate measurements]{.underline}. [The estimates [can]{.mark}
therefore [only be verified with **50% certainty**]{.mark} because they
are based on geological probabilities]{.underline}, not on actual
findings.23 It thus seems that the [desires of the early
merchants]{.underline}, monarchs and modernisers, [triggered by [the
**unknown**]{.mark} and the imaginary, [still **persist** in
**contemporary**]{.mark} vision**[s]{.mark}** of the future of the
Arctic]{.underline}. [A long-term historical analysis of the role of
utopian narratives in human engagement with the Arctic therefore offers
an excellent platform for the analysis of the conditions under which
language, meaning and social power interact]{.underline}. [The **central
problem**]{.underline} of this article [arises from the question of how
**utopian discourses** about the Arctic been **constructed**,
**communicated** and **transformed** over time]{.underline}, and how
these utopian narratives have affected the changing geopolitical
conditions of the region.

Utopianism as political practice: negating and superseding the
boundaries where the real and the possible meet The definition of utopia
that I use as the analytical framework for this article differs from
traditional distinctions in utopian theory. I do not explore utopias as
forms of social criticism, portrayals of the ideal society or
descriptions of non-places, the constructed geographies of collective
imagination. Instead, I accept the broad ana- lytic definition of utopia
suggested by Ruth Levitas. The focus of my analysis is therefore on the
exploration of the desires created by certain conditions that have been
left unfulfilled.24 Consequently, I describe utopianism in this article
as the art of the possible, and understand utopias to be a part of the
fictive sphere of social and political life that liberate and open up
spaces of action. The constitutive force of the fictive in such a
utopian mode attunes visions to the future while masking existing
realties and the sacrifices required for their attainment. 25 The
traditional core of utopia, that is, the expression of the desire for a
better way of being and living, is thus present in my work, but my
analytic emphasis is on the aspects of utopianism, which constitute and
mobilise social power: the ways in which utopias are used to harness and
express human desires to motivate them into action. 26 The utopias I
analyse in this article are therefore not necessarily grandiose projects
or the idiosyncratic vision of an ideal society; rather, they operate
more modestly within specific areas in which the process of
utopia-making is, in itself, already important. 27 When one approaches
the study of utopias from a broad analytical viewpoint, the boundary
between what is considered to be utopian and what is considered to be
practical speculation in social and political practices becomes fragile.
This approach reveals the constitution of power that is characteristic
to the act of label- ling. This mode of discursive practice does not
just posit the utopian narratives as being possible or impossible;
rather, it is, in itself, an act aimed towards the domi- nation of the
future and the unknown.28 The question in the analysis of different
socio-historical conditions under which language, meaning and social
power interact is therefore one of not only the legitimacy of power but
also the power of legiti- macy.29 One example of such power that is
noted by Ruth Levitas is the contempo- rary dream of unlimited growth on
a planet with limited natural resources, which dominates the global
political agenda. When one takes into consideration the reali- ties that
this vision hides beneath its dominant material values, the purported
project of continuing economic growth appears utopian in the pejorative
sense, without pro- viding a truly alternative vision. Levitas
highlights the idea that when viewed from this perspective, if the
commitment to growth appears to be impossible to stop, we must not only
dream, but demand, the impossible.30 At certain times in history, the
Arctic has been represented as a particular Land of Cokaygne, marking
the beginning of a hope for the transformation of the existing reality
through not only wishful thinking but also wilful action. 31 These
Arctic dreams have included the raising of hope for a better way of
traveling, growing and governing. The geographical remoteness, extreme
climate and other geographic char- acteristics have made the Arctic
especially conducive for such utopian practices as the horizons of
utopias, literary as well as political, are normally located somewhere
in the future or in the realm of the geographically unknown and
inaccessible. 32 In this article, I am especially interested in
understanding how particular ideas and forms of knowledge have made
possible, comprehensible and legitimate certain political pro- jects in
the Arctic. At the heart of my analysis are inter-subjective meanings,
which make subjective intentions possible in the first place, and the
problem of how the boundaries of a legitimate discourse are delimited.33
The goal of this research is thus not so much to explain what has
happened, but rather to understand why Arctic uto- pian imaginaries have
at certain times facilitated the mobilisation and constitution of power.
In my analysis I follow a discursive practices approach, which focuses
on contextual factors that enable and empower subordinate discourses,
histories and ideas, to become fused through argument into new
discursive modalities and alterna- tive political paradigms. My aim is
thus to illuminate the social nature of these pro- cesses and to
investigate their implications for political practices. 34 The social
construction and mobilisation of power through the imaginary in the
Arctic The first professional explorer to reach the Arctic was most
likely Pytheas of Massalia in the fourth century BC. 35 He and many of
those who followed in his footsteps in the Middle Ages did not know what
to expect in the North, and they found lands they were not in search of.
These voyages were not primarily motivated by utopian narratives of the
Arctic. 36 The first time utopian narratives of the North led to the
mobilisation of political power dates to the turn of the fifteenth and
the sixteenth centuries and the modern age of discovery.37 One of the
major sources of utopian narratives of the Arctic at that time was
Inventio Fortunata: a travel log of Nicholas, a Franciscan friar from
Oxford, from 1360, which he is said to have presented to Edward III of
England.38 Nicholas described the Arctic as the site of the Garden of
Eden, with four rivers, the Tree of Life, and a well of eternal youth.
His narratives have been identified as being a synthesis of Norse
mythology and the geographical knowledge of Norse Greenlanders of that
time.39 Based on these fourteenth century utopian descriptions of the
North, the first explorer to successfully convince British merchants, as
well as King Henry VII, of the plausibility of finding a route to Cathay
through the North was John Cabot in 1496. The situational nature of
utopias, that is the persisting political and technical conditions at
the time of their utterance, and the connection of power mobilising and
constituting utopian imaginaries of the Arctic to the three previously
mentioned larger political projects are visible in the mobilisation of
the Arctic utopia from the very beginning. 40 John Cabot's Arctic
explorations were preceded by the discovery of America in 1492, as well
as by the 1493 commissioned papal bull that divided the oceans of the
known world between Spain and Portugal, and forced the other sea powers,
England and Holland, to find other routes of commerce. 41 Cabot's
failure to dis- cover the Northwest Passage did not end the search for
it and the general exploration of the Arctic. Following Cabot, there
were many others who sought after the routes and riches of the North and
who, with stories and false maps from their journeys, contributed to the
construction, communication and transformation of the Arctic utopian
narratives.42 One of these utopian narratives that persisted for three
centuries was that of the Strait of Anian. This fictive passage to the
Pacific was introduced to sixteenth century cartography by Gaspar de
Corte Real, who sailed to the Gulf of St. Lawrence from the Azores and
mistook it for a strait. The belief in the strait persisted even though
Jacques Cartier reached the Lachine Rapids in 1535 and proved that the
strait did not exist. Moreover, the area, which is now known as the
Bering Strait, was referred to as the Strait of Anian in 1579. Because
the Bering Strait was not discovered by Western explorers until 1728, it
is uncertain whether the reference was based on lost information or only
wishful thinking. In any case, it was not until 1769 that George
Vancouver's explorations decisively disproved the myth of the strait and
the desire for this imaginary place finally conceded to reality.43 With
the advancement of history and an expanding knowledge base, the
conditions under which language, meaning and social power interact
changed. Slowly, the Arctic desires of explorers, merchants and monarchs
were harnessed to serve the advancement of the political projects of
modernity, materialism and nationalism. 44 Joseph Stalin's Soviet Union
offers an excellent example of such processes. The Arctic and our
northern regions contain colossal wealth. We must create a Soviet
organization which can, in the shortest period possible include this
wealth in the gen- eral resources of our socialist economic structure.
--Joseph Stalin, 1932^45^ The North as the guiding light in the progress
of the Soviet Union During his years in exile in Siberia, Joseph Stalin
experienced first-hand the hard- ships of living in the Arctic as well
as the relatively inefficient ways in which the Tsarist government
administered the region. The geographical remoteness of the area, and
the natural obstacles to the economic exploitation of the Arctic,
provided him with the perfect opportunity for the material
legitimisation of the grand Com- munist utopian narrative that told of
the victory of human science over the natural world.46 Consequently, the
heroes of the dozen Soviet Arctic explorations that took place between
1932 and 1939 were portrayed as representatives of the giant steps
forward in the USSR's great march towards "the shining dreamland of the
socialist tomorrow", as John McCannon describes the imagined bright
Socialist future of the time. 47 In the words of the Soviet author and
political activist Maxim Gorky from 1937: "In the darkness of the polar
night, the sun of the human intellect now shines brightly".48 Conveyed
to a public audience by means of carefully manipulated words and images,
the Arctic eventually became a vital part of Stalinist Russia's mythic
land- scape. The Bolshevik government engineered enormous increases in
Russian settlements in the North as well as in mining and
industrialisation in the region. These measures aimed to extend Soviet
power across all of its northern territories as well as to advance
Stalin's primary goal of rapid industrialisation. 49 So powerful was
this Soviet high modernist ideology and utopian propaganda at the time
of industrialisation and modernisation that it led Dr. Bruce Campbell
Hopper, a professor of political science and Soviet expert at Harvard
University, to describe the status of Soviet affairs in the Arctic in
1935 as the "Soviet Conquest of the Far North": "The search for the
Northeast Passage to Cathay, which for four centuries stirred the
imagination of European mariners, has at last ended in triumph. We seem
at the beginning of a new phase of man's relations with the North".50
Once put into action, the blueprint for this Soviet Arctic dream was
executed by forced labour-camp manpower, which included the White Sea
Canal project that aimed to build a canal that would open shipping
between the Arctic Ocean and the Leningrad region, bypassing the Barents
and the Baltic Sea. Plans for such a canal had already been drawn up by
eighteenth century Czarist merchants. The achieve- ment of this plan
thus offered Stalin the opportunity to legitimise the superiority of the
new Soviet regime over the old Czarist one, which had never been able to
accomplish it. 51 The rapid forward march towards the realisation of
Soviet Arctic dreams was to a certain extent facilitated by the nearly
limitless ambition inherent in the dominant ideology of high modernism.
This belief, which borrows from the legitimacy of science and
technology, aspires to transform nature to suit all of man's purposes.52
The other part of the socio-historical context that enabled utopian
discourses to constitute and mobilise power in the Soviet Arctic was
supported by the general conditions that also enabled Joseph Stalin to
become the leader of Russia. These conditions included the ideological
utopian fanaticism that was embedded in Marxism and its international
nature, the chaos and violence of the First Word War, Lenin's murderous
dictatorship over the proletariat, as well as the rise of historical
materialism. 53\\ In the end, the rapid rate of change combined with the
lack of planning, prim- itive technology applied too quickly and the
authoritarian role of the Five-Year Plans created more suffering than
progress in the Soviet Arctic. The White Sea Canal, for example, was
built in only 18 months by prisoners from the Gulag prison camps, and an
estimated 25,000 of them lost their lives in the process. The canal
ultimately failed to serve its purpose because it was too shallow to
begin with, and the goods in the region continued to be delivered by
rail. 54 The inheritance of unfulfilled Soviet desires is also visible
in the stranded and eco- nomically unviable cities in the Russian
Arctic. 55 As this legacy of the mobilisa- tion of Soviet Arctic desires
shows, the dreams of rapid industrialisation through collectivisation
and Soviet technology turned out to be fuelled by utopian narra- tives
more than anything else. These narratives were constructed of mythical
ele- ments that were already packed with meanings and associations that
were separate from the material, social and technical realities of the
time. 56 The grandiose Soviet geopolitical projects in the Arctic were
legitimised and mobilised more by rhetoric and ambition than by actual
accumulated knowledge from the region itself. The power and appeal of
these projects seems to have been constituted fur- ther through the
conditions of national and international political uncertainty.57 These
contextual factors enabled and empowered subordinate utopian Arctic
narra- tives to become integrated through argument into the realm of
political discourse and possible politics at the beginning of the
twentieth century in the other Arctic countries as well. In the 1920s,
the Norman Wells oil deposit was discovered in the Mackenzie River in
Canada's Northwest Territories and was labelled as "the biggest oilfield
in the world". Oil exploration in the region started in the 1920s and
returned in the 1940s, but it came to a halt both times due to
geographical and climatic obstacles.58 The Alaska Highway, initiated
after the signing of the Alaskan Highway Act between the USA and Canada
in March 1942, was publicised as a means by which to move troops and
supplies to Alaskan military bases during the Second World War; how-
ever, it was never used for this purpose. Furthermore, in 1945, Canadian
officials who were responsible for the maintenance and control of the
parts of the road built on Canadian soil discovered that the road was
virtually impassable without major reconstruction, and it remained a
military road until Royal Canadian Engineers were able to rebuild it to
meet acceptable standards for public use in 1948.59 In Finland, the
large-scale forest cuttings in Lapland after WWII, which were used in
the rebuilding of the country, were based on the calculations of forest
engineers; this large-scale deforestation subsequently led to severe
environmental damage as well as damage to forest growth in the region.
60 What makes the case of the Arctic an especially intriguing one for
the study of how language, meaning and social power interact is that
despite the obstacles that the high modernist, national and economic
projects in the Arctic have faced in past decades, the utopian desires
about the region still persist. Indeed, they continue to drive and
mobilise political power in the region. Russia's President Dmitri
Medvedev, for example, stated in a speech in September 2008, "Our first
and main task is to turn the Arctic into a resource base for Russia in
the twenty- first century".61 The Kingdom of Denmark presented the
current and future state of the North in its 2011 Strategy for the
Arctic as follows: Climate change and technological developments are
also opening new possibilities for the Arctic. Among them is increased
access to the exploitation of oil, gas and minerals, but also new
shipping routes, which can reduce costs and CO 2 emissions by freight
between the continents ... Commercial opportunities in the Arctic are
enormous, not least for the Greenland, Faroese and Danish industries,
which to a great extent already possess the skills that will be far more
in demand with the development of the Arctic region. 62 After centuries
of unsuccessful attempts to realise utopian Arctic desires, the North-
ern regions of the world continue to be described as a realm of
potential economic and national prosperity as well as an arena for
heroism and technological advance- ment. The current utopian narratives
about the Arctic seem to be rooted in the same three dominant political
projects of state dominance over territory, materialist capi- talism and
high modernist ideology as the ones discussed earlier in this article.
At a time when the main organising principle of international relations
shows signs of shifting (at least partially) from an ethos of state
sovereignty to one of globalisation, these narratives are contested by
alternative interpretations. Nevertheless, especially under uncertain
conditions, such narratives liberate and open up the Arctic for spe-
cific types of action while shutting out alternatives. One of the
strongest advocates of these historically embedded utopian visions of
the future of the Arctic in the beginning of the twenty-first century
has been Stephen Harper, who has held the post of Canada's prime
minister since 2006. "Our North, Our Heritage, Our Future"63 Practising
and defending Canada's sovereignty in its Arctic territories, as well as
Arctic security, in general, have been several of the main agendas of
the country's Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, since he identified them
as among his central campaign issues when he ran for office in the
Canadian Federal Elections of 2006.64 In his vision of the future, the
wealth, glory and power of Canada would be constituted through the
development of its northern territories. Such desires for conquest of
the geographically changing Arctic, which some interpret as representing
the first signs of the dystopic environmental degradation that will
ultimately lead to the end of the age of man on earth, were already
present in Harper's speech opening Parliament's Second Session in
2007.65 "Canadians see in our North an expression of our deepest
aspirations: our sense of exploration, the beauty and the bounty of our
land, and our limitless potential".66 The most profound element in the
definition of utopia as used in this article is clearly present in the
above quote. That is, the North as the expression of Canadians' "deepest
aspirations" and "the limitless potential", which indicate desires
created by certain conditions that are not yet fulfilled. The
development of the "new opportunities" Harper acknowledges to be
emerging across the Arctic, but which he does not specify in the speech,
will, according to the subtitle of the printed text of the address,
strengthen Canada's sovereignty and place in the world. The old project
of legitimising the dominance of a territory is also present in this
address, in which Harper announced the development of a new,
comprehensive northern strategy for Canada. Canada's New Northern
Strategy titled "Our North, Our Heritage, Our Future", which came out in
2009, highlights actions that will be taken to meet the challenges and
opportunities of a changing Canadian North, "helping the North realise
its true potential as a healthy, prosperous and secure region within a
strong and sovereign Canada".67 All of the three underlying political
projects, sovereignty, high-modernist ideology and capitalist growth
economy, which have been embedded in the formulation of desires about
the Arctic since early-modern times, are present in the strategy. We are
a northern country. The True North is our destiny -- for our explorers,
for our entrepreneurs, for our artists. To not embrace the promise of
the True North, now, at the dawn of its ascendency, would be to turn our
backs on what it is to be Canadian. --Canada's Prime Minister Stephen
Harper, August 2008, Inuvik, Northwest. 68 In this strategy, the social,
cultural and aesthetic values that are associated with the North are
present, but the underlying desire for the future of the region, and the
rea- son for the need for new attention to the Arctic, comes through as
material and eco- nomic. "From the development of world-class diamond
mines and massive oil and gas reserves, to the growth of commercial
fisheries, to a thriving tourism industry that attracts visitors from
around the globe, the enormous economic potential of the North is being
unlocked".69 The above statement aims at the domination of the future
and the unknown by rhetorically building it in the present. It becomes
appar- ent, when one is acquainted with the current material,
technological and financial realities of the region that this narrative
of the prosperous North, put forward in the Canadian Arctic Strategy,
suppresses, and which would render these aspirations unattainable and
thus utopian. In 2011, instead of increasing the funding of its northern
educational institu- tions, the Stephen Harper-led government of Canada
cuts its funding to the interna- tional and interdisciplinary University
of the Arctic by two-thirds. 70 Additionally, the Canadian Coast Guard's
Amundsen icebreaker was unexpectedly dry-docked in Quebec in January due
to cracks in four of its six engines, halting planned research trips to
the Arctic Ocean.71 What is more, Stephen Harper's plan for funding new
icebreakers continues to shift due to the changing political and
economic condi- tions. In 2005, when he was the opposition leader,
Harper promised to build three new heavy icebreakers. Two years later,
as Prime Minister, he announced that six to eight ice-strengthened
Arctic offshore patrol ships would be constructed instead. In 2010, the
navy, to whom these icebreakers were assigned, scaled back the planned
size and speed of the ships. The vessels will be capable of just 17
knots, compared with the 29 knots of Canada's two-decade-old frigates.
Their capabilities will also be limited by the decision to build them as
ice-strengthened rather than icebreaking vessels. This means that the
hulls will not be strong enough to allow for Arctic operations between
November and July.72 Nevertheless, Prime Minister Harper con- tinues to
base his narratives of the Arctic on the specific desires embedded in
the kinds of high modernist, economic and nationalist political projects
that have been discussed here, rather than acknowledging and addressing
the unravelled realities and obstacles in the way of the fulfilment of
these dreams. "Canada's North is full of economic potential and
innovators continue to unlock development possibilities that bring with
them real economic benefits and long-term jobs for local residents".73
By continuing to use this rhetoric at a time of increased economic as
well as environmental uncertainty, Harper aims to gain dominance in the
development of the future of not only the (sovereign) Arctic spaces but
also that of the natural envi- ronment and of global as well as national
politics by fabricating it with pre-existing narratives at the present.
The rhetoric he uses is a part of the larger utopia of the unlimited
growth of material wealth on a planet with limited natural resources,
where the growing usage of non-renewable energy and the geographic
location of those sources in politically unstable zones, combined with
global warming, has increased the allure of the previously economically
unviable resources in the North. The dominance of this larger utopia in
the global socio-historical context enables the constitution and
mobilisation of power through utopian narratives of the Cana- dian
Arctic. Moreover, the dynamics of the changing Arctic continue to
frequently surprise natural scientists, and the science of climate
change evolves faster than the time in which reports can be published.
When the last assessment of the Intergov- ernmental Panel on Climate
Change was released in November 2007, studies a mere 14 months later
suggested that sea-ice melt, glacier retreat and food insecurity were
all more dire than the IPCC had predicted. 74 One of the main conditions
by which utopian narratives are able to gain legitimacy in the Arctic
seems therefore, yet again, to be that of uncertainty.75

Conclusion

At certain times, in specific socio-historical conditions, [[the
Arctic]{.mark} has worked as [a **blank screen** for]{.mark} the
[projection of desires]{.mark} for the future condition of the region
that has been presented as an already existing material
reality]{.underline}. [This practice of using utopian
narratives]{.underline} about the Arctic [to constitute and mobilise
power for the actualisation of desires]{.underline} dates back to the
Renaissance, but it [remains a part of the present-day
politics]{.underline} of the Arctic as well. In fact, the construction
and [[mobilisation]{.underline}]{.mark} of utopian projections of the
Arctic in the politics of the region [has been [connected to]{.mark} the
**advancement** of]{.underline} three more general political projects:
the legitimisation of the domination of a territory, the
[[**propagation** of]{.mark} high modernist
**[ideology]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the establishment of mercantilism
with modern political economy as its successor.

The advancement of technology, especially the rediscovery of the
cartography of the Ancient world, served to legitimise some of the
utopian narratives of the Arctic as scientific knowledge early on. This
is visible in the way in which the portrayal of the Arctic based on the
stories of Nicholas of Lynn persisted in Arctic cartography for decades.
A similar belief in the power of technology, and how it could harness
nature to fulfil all human desires also played a central role in the
mobilisation of the narratives of the "Great North" in the Soviet Union.

The Arctic, however, has not been the first or the only choice for the
fulfilment of the material desires of the high-modernist ideology,
nationalism and materialism. Another condition, which has enabled the
exploration of the material possibilities in the Arctic, has been the
lack of alternatives. John Cabot convinced English merchants and the
King to invest in the search for a route to Cathay through the North in
1496 because the papal bull commissioned in 1493 had divided the oceans
of the known world between Spain and Portugal, leaving no other option
to the other sea powers of the time than of seeking a route of commerce
in the North. This con- dition is also present in the current emergence
of the Arctic into the centre of international relations. The increased
usage of non-renewable resources has made the northern resources, which
will be harder to access than most of the other large deposits, even
with less permafrost on the Arctic Ocean, more lucrative.

[The [**most important** condition]{.mark} for utopian imaginaries of
the Arctic for the purpose of **mobilising** and **constituting power**
in the region [has]{.mark}]{.underline}, however, [[been]{.mark} that of
**[uncertainty]{.mark}**]{.underline}. First, it was the uncertainty of
geography; then, it was the uncertainty of the global and national
political conditions; and finally, it was the uncertainty of the
progress of global climate change and the organisation of the future
international order. [When looking at the role utopian narratives have
played]{.underline} in human engagement [with the Arctic]{.underline}
through history, it seems that [we are yet again living in a time when
scientific [**understanding** **lags**]{.mark} far [behind]{.mark}
political **[ambitions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Thus, [the mobilisation
of political and economic support for projects in the [Arctic
depends]{.mark} heavily [on]{.mark} the [**construction** of]{.mark} a
range of **[utopian narratives]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As such,
contemporary Northern politics, including those of Canada's Prime
Minister Harper, reveal more about the prevailing desires and values in
international relations than about the material realities of the region,
just as it was with their predecessors since the fifteenth century.

## Framework

### Framework---Albert---2AC

#### Clash [link turns]{.underline} alt solvency. Refusing to compare the alt to the plan [dooms]{.underline} the transition.

**Albert, 23**---Lecturer in International Relations, SOAS, University
of London (Michael, "Ecosocialism for Realists: Transitions, Trade-Offs,
and Authoritarian Dangers," Capitalism Nature Socialism, 34:1, 11-30,
dml)

This leads to the second conjoined tendency, which is to neglect
**[difficult strategic questions]{.underline}**,
**[[trade-offs]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and
**dangers**]{.underline}]{.mark} that [[would]{.mark} likely [emerge
during the transition]{.mark} process and beyond]{.underline}. [The
majority of ecosocialists **ignore** these sorts of questions
altogether]{.underline}, while others address them more tepidly. Michael
Löwy, for example, who has done some of the finest work on elaborating
[the]{.underline} ecosocialist [alternative]{.underline}, [**does not
consider** whether there might be a **trade-off** between calls
for]{.underline} "**[democratic planning]{.underline}**" [and the
simultaneous emphasis on **biospheric limits** within which we must
constrain consumption]{.underline}. Indeed, he affirms that "nobody has
the right to tell people what their needs are" (Löwy Citation2015, 34),
but then the question of whether this may require allowing
energy-intensive modes of consumption that transgress planetary
boundaries to persist is [left **unaddressed**]{.underline}. Instead,
Löwy expresses faith that "the rationality of democratic decisions will
prevail once the power of commodity fetishism is broken" (28). This
[is]{.underline} perhaps plausible, but as Löwy himself recognizes,
there will be [a **long period of transition** in which the]{.underline}
"[[old habits of consumption would **persist**]{.underline}]{.mark}"
(34), [and]{.underline} he doesn't grapple with [the question of how
they would be **transformed** within the **requisite
timeframe**]{.underline} to avoid runaway climate change (i.e. by 2050
or shortly thereafter). Joel Kovel and Michael Lebowitz also recognize
that ecosocialism(s)-in-transition would remain marked by the defects of
capitalism for some time; thus they emphasize the importance of
democratic praxis in forging the new subjectivities and social relations
that would be needed to sustain a long-term [[revolutionary
transformation]{.underline}]{.mark}, which otherwise [[risks **lapsing**
into]{.mark} the same **[authoritarian statism]{.mark}** that has
plagued socialism **throughout its history**]{.underline} (Kovel
Citation2007, 272; Lebowitz Citation2006, 66). This is an important
insight, though it still begs the question of how a society-wide
transformation towards ecosocialist/degrowth principles might occur in
the needed time-frame. [[Given the]{.mark} possible [**intransigence**
of]{.mark}]{.underline} energy and emissions-intensive
[[consumption]{.mark} practices]{.underline}, [particularly [in a
context of]{.mark} **rising [rightwing populism]{.mark}**
[and]{.mark}]{.underline} "**[[fossil fascism]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
(Malm and Collective Citation2021), [we should **grapple squarely** with
the risk that state coercion would be **needed**]{.underline} enforce
ecosocialist degrowth in rich countries. On the other hand, if we choose
to follow the democratic will wherever it leads us, even if this entails
the perpetuation or even expansion of material-energy intensive modes of
living, then we must deal with the biospheric consequences. [Might there
be a **trade-off**]{.underline}, then, [between]{.underline} degrowth
and non-degrowth [paths to ecosocialism]{.underline}, [each with its own
set of **challenges** and **dangers**?]{.underline} Ecosocialists have
not systematically investigated these sorts of questions.

In sum, we can see that the ecosocialist and degrowth
[[movements]{.mark} have so far devoted **limited attention** to
**important strategic questions** and **trade-offs**]{.underline}
regarding ecosocialist transitions. Thus [they]{.underline} are
vulnerable to critiques like those of Matt Huber, who claims that
degrowth variants of ecosocialism [[**fail to articulate** how their
utopian aspirations could be]{.underline}]{.mark} "[**[realistically
built]{.mark}** out of the present]{.underline}" (Huber Citation2019).
Instead, Huber advocates what he calls a "scientific ecosocialism" that
eschews the emphasis on degrowth and instead endorses a "traditional
socialist politics not of limits and less, but of more" (Huber
Citation2019). Unfortunately, Huber's proposal is itself "utopian" in
that it disregards the biospheric devastation that would be entailed by
more consumption in the already over-developed global north (which I
will expand on below). However, he indicates a crucial problem that must
be addressed by the degrowth ecosocialist left: [how might an
ecosocialist vision]{.underline} based on degrowth (in rich countries)
[**win popular majorities**?]{.underline} As Hubert Buch-Hansen bluntly
states: "[the]{.underline} degrowth [project is **nowhere near**
enjoying the **degree** and **type** of support it needs]{.underline} if
its policies are to be implemented through democratic processes"
(Buch-Hansen Citation2018, 160). This is undoubtedly true, at present,
and thus [more strategic thinking about the how of transition is
needed]{.underline}. Following Sam Gindin, [[we
need]{.underline}]{.mark} "[an [**honest presentation** of the
**risks**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[costs]{.underline}**, [and
**dilemmas**]{.underline}]{.mark} [the]{.underline} \[eco\][socialist
project will face]{.underline}, [[alongside **credible
examples**]{.mark} and **promising indications** [of how]{.mark} the
[problems might be]{.mark} creatively [addressed]{.mark}]{.underline}"
(Gindin Citation2018, 14). Furthermore, as Erik Olin Wright says, [we
need to understand]{.underline} "[not simply the **obstacles** and
**openings** for strategies in the present]{.underline}, [but how
those]{.underline} obstacles and opportunities [are **likely to
develop** over time]{.underline}" (Wright Citation2010, 18).

In this sense, following Gindin and Olin Wright, [we can develop
a]{.underline} "realist" or "**[realist utopian]{.underline}**"
[approach]{.underline} to ecosocialism [that combines rigorous social
and ecological analysis with speculative imagination]{.underline},
[working through the likely **constraints** on utopian
potentials]{.underline}, [how they might be **surmounted**]{.underline},
[and the likely **challenges**]{.underline}, **[tensions]{.underline}**,
**[trade-offs]{.underline}**, [and **dilemmas** we would face even in
the **best-case** scenarios]{.underline}. No one could ever pretend to
have fully worked out answers to these problems, and the claims of
"realism" (i.e. "being realistic") can always be contested, given that
we are dealing with an inherently open and uncertain future (Wright
Citation2010). But [the difficulties of developing more realistic models
of possible futures]{.underline} and theories of systemic change [should
**not** lead us to dismiss the importance of facing them **as
rigorously**]{.underline} (and humbly) **[as possible]{.underline}**. To
this end, I will first develop a plausible (r)evolutionary scenario of
how something like ecosocialist degrowth might emerge in the coming
decades, and then think through some of the likely trade-offs and
dangers that would accompany the transition process.

### Framework---Njoya---2AC

#### Reject non-[causal]{.underline} link claims and non-[solvent]{.underline} alternatives.

**Njoya, 23**---Senior Lecturer at the University of Exeter Law School
(Wanjiru, with David Gordon, "Capitalism, Markets and Economic
Equality," *Redressing Historical Injustice: Self-Ownership, Property
Rights and Economic Equality*, Chapter 5, pp. 151-184, SpringerLink,
language modifications denoted by brackets, dml)

Yet [the [causes of inequality]{.mark} often have **no necessary
connection** to [injustice]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example if a person
has no income because he freely chooses not to work, that is not an
injustice for which reparations or retribution would be an appropriate
response. Moreover [there [are **many**]{.mark} **causes** of inequality
including environmental]{.underline}, [social and cultural
factors]{.underline}. [The [view that inequality is **presumptive
evidence**]{.mark} of injustice **[precludes]{.mark}** a **clear
[understanding]{.mark}** of the influence of these factors]{.underline}.
[Because the causes of things **matter**]{.underline}, [any
[theory]{.mark} of justice [which regards causation as **irrelevant**
**risks**]{.mark} **producing only [more
injustice]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[If inequality is **not explained** by historical legacies of
discrimination]{.underline}, [then it is important to understand what
the causes of inequality are]{.underline}. [In evaluating the **causal
links** between historical legacies and contemporary]{.underline}
economic [outcomes]{.underline}, [we may also observe that it is
**unlikely**]{.underline} to be the case [that discrimination today is
**worse** than it was in the historical era when slavery and colonialism
were rooted not only in people's **conduct** but also in **law** and
**official policy**]{.underline}. [If]{.underline} it is claimed that
[the]{.underline} economic [fortunes of marginalised races have
**declined** since then]{.underline} (a matter which may itself be
contested), [**some other explanation** must be sought for why this is
the case]{.underline}. Critical race [[theories assert that]{.mark}
persistent]{.underline} economic [[underperformance in itself is
evidence of]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[systemic
legacies]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [but this merely reasserts the claim in
dispute [**without** establishing the **causal link**]{.mark} that is
being questioned]{.underline}.Footnote 60

[That the [causes]{.mark} of things **matter** should be **clear** to
anyone with a **goal**]{.underline} he wishes \[they wish\] to pursue,
[as that [is the **only**]{.mark} rational [basis on which we can
**ascertain**]{.mark} **the [appropriate steps]{.mark} to take** towards
that goal]{.underline}. As Mises explains:

Man \[one\] is in a position to act because he has the ability to
discover causal relations which determine change and becoming in the
universe. Acting requires and presupposes the category of causality.
Only a man \[person\] who sees the world in the light of causality is
fitted to act... In a world without causality and regularity of
phenomena there would be no field for human reasoning and human action.
Such a world would be a chaos in which man \[humanity\] would be at a
loss to find any orientation and guidance.Footnote 61

[This **[does not mean]{.mark}** that [we **always** know **all**
the]{.mark} precise [causes]{.mark} of social phenomena]{.underline},
[that we can identify and measure all the factors that pertain or that
we can isolate all the influential factors some of which may have been
random chance events]{.underline}. It means that [human [action
**depends** on]{.mark}]{.underline} "[[ability to **influence the
cause**]{.underline}]{.mark}": [it is **not enough** simply to
understand in a **theoretical sense** what might be the **potential
causes** of things]{.underline}, [but it is necessary to [focus
on]{.mark} those causes in relation to which we are **able to take
action**]{.underline}.Footnote 62 This means that:

[Even when]{.underline} he \[[one]{.underline}\] [knows the causal
relation involved]{.underline}, man \[[one]{.underline}\] [**cannot
act** if]{.underline} he \[one\] is [not in a position to **influence**
the cause]{.underline}. The archetype of causality research was:
[[**where** and **how** must I interfere]{.mark} in order [to
**divert**]{.mark} the course of events [from the way it would
go]{.mark} in the **absence** of my interference in a direction which
better suits my wishes?]{.underline}Footnote 63

In other words, "[in order to act]{.underline}, man
\[[one]{.underline}\] [must know the **causal relationship** between
events]{.underline}, [processes]{.underline}, [or states]{.underline} of
affairs. And [only as far as]{.underline} he \[[one]{.underline}\]
[knows this relationship]{.underline}, [can]{.underline} his \[one's\]
[action attain the ends sought]{.underline}."Footnote 64 [It [**does not
suffice** to **observe**]{.mark} that [a]{.mark} social
[phenomenon]{.mark} exists]{.underline}. [It is [necessary to understand
the factors **responsible**]{.mark} for its existence]{.underline},
[[and the extent to which those]{.mark} factors [can be **avoided** or
**replicated**]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}as the case may require.

[It is]{.underline} therefore [important to emphasise causality in the
[**racial inequality** debates]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [debates tend
to [focus]{.mark} attention [on **describing problems** and]{.mark}
proposing preferred [solutions with **little attempt** to consider
whether]{.mark} the proposed solutions [would]{.mark} in fact
**[alleviate]{.mark}** the problem [or yield the desired
outcome]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is [especially]{.underline} the case
[in relation to arguments that take the form]{.underline} "[I have
suffered **harm** and therefore demand **compensation**]{.underline}."
In the law of tort, for example, [[questions of causation are
**important**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Compensation is payable by the
person who, having a duty of care, breached that duty and thereby caused
harm. [The [harm must be **attributable**]{.mark} to the breach of
duty]{.underline}, and not merely coincidentally or tangentially related
to that breach. The claim is [[not]{.mark} [simply]{.mark}]{.underline}
brought [[against]{.mark} whoever happens to be standing in [the
**vicinity**]{.mark}]{.underline} on grounds that he can afford to pay.

[Understanding the causal links between historical events
and]{.underline} economic [disparities also highlights the importance of
distinguishing between]{.underline} factors often referred to as
"**[lived experiences]{.underline}**" [and objective evidence of
**causation**]{.underline}. As Williams emphasises, [it is **not
enough** to show that racism **exists** or that people have
**experienced** discrimination]{.underline}. [To understand]{.underline}
the **[causes]{.underline}** of economic inequality [we must **go
further** than observing social trends]{.underline}. [The converse is
also true]{.underline}: [the [claim that there is no evidence of a
causal connection **does not**]{.mark} **amount** to a [claim]{.mark}
that historical [exploitation did]{.mark} not exist [or]{.mark} that
racial discrimination today [does not
exist]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Nor does the absence of a causal
connection]{.underline} between historical injustice and economic
outcomes [**deny** that historical injustices occurred]{.underline},
[[but questions whether]{.mark} current]{.underline} economic [[outcomes
are **attributable**]{.mark} to those injustices]{.underline}.
[Ascertaining what once existed or now exists is the **easy**
part]{.underline}. [Establishing causal relations is **more
difficult**]{.underline}.

### Alt/Framework Catch-All---2AC

#### They should be responsible for defending the [consequences]{.underline} of the alt's [material implementation]{.underline}---current economic models are [too entrenched]{.underline} to critique away without a [feasible blueprint]{.underline} for change.

**Russi and Haskell, 15**---Senior Lecturer in Sociology, Azim Premji
University AND Assistant Professor, Mississippi College School of Law
(Luigi and John, "Heterodox Challenges to Consumption-Oriented Models of
Legislation," Unbound: Harvard Journal of the Legal Left, 9:13, 2015,
dml)

The difficulty of following these critiques from American Legal Realists
and these other heterodox authors to any normative conclusion, however,
seems two-fold. On the one hand, [[to think **outside**]{.mark} of
[consumption seems]{.mark}]{.underline} in some ways [to border on a
**[theological]{.mark} aspiration**]{.underline}, [to be ushered
into]{.underline} the responsibility of [remaking society according
to]{.underline} some almost **[other-worldly dimensions]{.underline}**:
[an economic order that conceives **progress beyond
growth**]{.underline}, [a socio-political structure that allows for
systemic change **without reducing**]{.underline} the possibilities of
human **[freedom]{.underline}**, [the normative agenda to **substantiate
egalitarian relationships**]{.underline}, [a global order that
**preserves** the victories of]{.underline} industrial [capitalism while
simultaneously **transcending** its costs]{.underline} (ecological,
human, etc.). On the other hand, [[critiques of consumption]{.mark}-led
[governance]{.mark} seem both **anachronistic** and
**violent**]{.underline}. They are [**anachronistic** because
[they]{.mark} either **too readily** rely on]{.underline} the
possibilities of [the **Enlightenment [assum]{.mark}ption** that there

**[trumping]{.mark}**]{.underline} the **[politico-economic

[[individuals are **naturally willing** to **collectively do the right

[at]{.mark} **personal [cost]{.mark}** in a **consistent

**almost undoubtedly** [entail **significant** and]{.mark}]{.underline}
most likely [**intensely [hostile opposition]{.mark}** [from entrenched

more coercive** and **violent** than its advocates]{.underline} tend to
[admit]{.underline} (e.g., it is part of the very problems it claims to

over the question [[whether]{.mark} the [current]{.mark} trajectory is
occasioning a level of **[lost opportunity costs]{.mark}** that
[**warrant the effort** and **violence**]{.mark}]{.underline} most
likely [[**necessary** to enact an **alternative mode**]{.mark} of
political life]{.underline}. Furthermore, [if we **accept**]{.underline}
the proposition of [the **necessity** of coercive change]{.underline},
[it **still begs the question** to what extent its proponents within
intellectual circles are really willing to **fully participate** and
**accept** the potential costs]{.underline} of radical struggle -- [they
may]{.underline}, to put it vulgarly, simply [have **too much comfort to
lose**]{.underline}. To what extent, in short, are current left-oriented
calls within academia and policy circles merely reflecting the more
general postmodern crisis of identity versus the partisan militant
residing at any revolutionary core? [In giving **normative bite** to any
alternative model]{.underline}, as the American Legal Realist Robert
Hale pointed out, it seems undoubtedly the case that [any future system
would only find **new constraints** and **forms of violence** to sustain
its cohesiveness]{.underline}.

\[T\]he systems advocated by professed upholders of laissez-faire are in
reality permeated with coercive restrictions of individual freedom, and
with restrictions, moreover, out of conformity with any formula of
"equal opportunity" or of "preserving the equal rights of others." [Some
sort of **coercive restriction**]{.underline} of individuals, it is
believed, [is **absolutely unavoidable**]{.underline}, and cannot be
made to conform to any Spenserian formula.161

[If fundamental reform to consumer-centric governance is **inherently
violent**]{.underline} -- in that [it will **necessarily
create**]{.underline} only [**new winners** and **losers**]{.underline},
and [not without **potentially violent conflict** and

therefore [[**not** just]{.mark} a question of [**ethics** or
**political will**]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., the current distribution

**[[feasibility]{.underline}]{.mark}** of re-conceptualizing efficiency,
[both [in]{.mark} terms of [**strategy** and
**tactics**]{.mark}]{.underline}: in other words, upon what standard

trajectory [versus an **alternative**]{.mark} economic
[model]{.mark}]{.underline}), [[and how might this be **actually
accomplished**]{.underline}]{.mark}.162 To set out on such a task is
exactly the stakes of future progressive scholarship, and upon which we

### Link Turn---Nuclear Energy---2AC

#### Nuclear energy is key to socialism---it can be used to ensure sustainable energy

**Walters 13** (David Walters is a writer and the former chair of the
Holt Labor Library; 11-26-2013; accessed 7-20-2025; Breakthrough
Institute; \"The Socialist Case for Nuclear Energy;\"
https://thebreakthrough.org/issues/energy/the-socialist-case-for-nuclear-energy)
ONBM

These same [[leftists put]{.mark} their [hopes]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the
**[false]{.mark}** panacea of what has been called a "100 percent
[fossil fuel-free/nuclear-free]{.mark} carbon-free [renewable energy
economy]{.mark}." Many academic papers have been written seeking to
prove the practicality of such a project. An equal number of papers
destroy this myth]{.underline}; that is not the purpose of this essay.
Rather, consider several points about energy.

The advance of civilization has been predicated on the accessibility of
and increased per-capita use of energy, but every paper advocating
renewable energy is based on a massive reduction in per-capita energy
use. While arguing renewable energy can power a high-tech civilization
on a planetary scale, authors believe that such an endeavor itself could
be carbon-free. Consider one example: according to almost all studies,
land-based wind energy, the only kind being built in the United States,
uses 8 to 12 times the amount of concrete per unit of energy compared to
nuclear power. [Concrete uses massive amounts of dirty natural gas in
its production]{.underline}. It uses more steel, copper, and aluminum,
not to mention that far more intensive extraction-mining of rare earth
metals is required for wind generators than for nuclear power.

Because [**[wind and solar]{.mark}** energy [have]{.mark} actual [usable
energy]{.mark} production, or [capacity factors]{.mark} (CFs), [that are
**very low**,]{.mark} massive [**overbuilding** of these systems will be
needed]{.mark}.]{.underline} Nuclear energy in the United States is
around 90 percent CF; that is, 90 percent of the time, a 1,000 MW plant
produces 1,000 MWs. In some countries, it is even higher. Wind's CF on
land-based wind farms is only 33 percent. Solar is only 20 percent
because the sun is only at its useable height in the sky from about 10
a.m. to 3 p.m.

What to do? There is a lot of talk about storage, big batteries, or
using hot molten salts to store power. This can be done, but can it be
done on a genuine utility-scale basis? The costs are overwhelming, as
every solar and wind plant utilizing storage has proven. And they have
remained in the experimental stage for more than a decade.

[Nuclear is safe]{.underline}. This sounds like an outrageous claim in
light of Fukushima and Chernobyl. In fact, [the [number of
**deaths**]{.mark} per amount of energy for [nuclear]{.mark} is **[way
lower]{.mark}** [than]{.mark} it is for [fossil
fuel]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is lower than wind and solar if
installation and industrial accidents are taken into account. People
will argue about the numbers, but given what our species face with
respect to global climate change, this is the wrong argument. Those
numbers are going to be outrageous; they already are.

Fukushima could have been prevented. The capitalist board of directors
of Fukushima's operator TEPCO had its seawall only to minimum
"recommendations" when common practice in other countries, for private
or public utilities, is to build *beyond* specs. They also built their
fuel tanks for the auxiliary diesel generators powering their auxiliary
cooling system right on the water at their intake structure, rather than
locating them behind the plant up on the hill from where the video was
taken of the tsunami hitting the plant. [There would have been **[no
"Fukushima]{.mark}** accident" [had TEPCO put safety ahead of
profits]{.mark}.]{.underline}

However, there were no deaths from the accident itself (compared to the
20,000 who died from the earth quake and tsunami itself!) and many
experts believe there will likely be no fatalities because the
population was exposed to so very little radiation after the accident.

[Chernobyl, a truly horrific accident that caused 4,000 treatable
thyroid cancer incidents (a number most likely vastly underreported),
was a one-off incident.]{.underline} A converted military-style reactor
built by the U.S.S.R using a design banned in all but two countries of
the world, exploded. The explosion sent dozens of tons of fuel into the
atmosphere. There are still 10 such reactors online and yet, despite
Chernobyl and despite the collapse of the U.S.S.R., there have been
exactly zero other accidents of the type that happened there at any of
those plants. Why? The nuclear industry in Russia stepped up and
engineered out the ability of humans to cause such an accident, and
began to add large, heavy containment to existing plants and design it
into future plants. The Russians also stopped building this type of
Chernobyl-style reactor.

Even under capitalism, the nuclear industry, despite corruption, despite
the profit motive, has proved superior to the fossil fuel industry
(including both privately run and publicly owned plants) in the number
of deaths incurred through normal operations. Any comparison of fossil
fuel plants and nuclear favors nuclear technology shows this to be the
case.

[Socialists argue that, like any technology, [nuclear energy]{.mark}
would be [far better]{.mark} employed [in a democratic]{.mark}ally run,
[worker]{.mark}- and consumer-[controlled]{.mark} [public]{.mark} power
[grid]{.mark}. Of this there can be no doubt. But we are talking about
technologies that are being employed under capitalism generally. Many
developing countries are delving into nuclear energy and developing
nuclear plants or at least the safety regimes required by international
law as a prerequisite to building a nuclear grid.]{.underline}

[Countries currently building nuclear grids include China, Vietnam,
India, Pakistan, the UAE, South Africa/Azania, and many more. They do
this without influence from the "nuclear industry" or other lobby groups
but after reviewing all the alternatives.]{.underline} Some of these
same countries are also building new coal and gas plants and, at the
same time, investing massive amounts to develop wind and solar power.

France is the world's premier user of nuclear energy. The French ruling
class decided that France had to eliminate its reliance on burning oil
for power generation. In 15 years, France went from zero to 79% of its
grid powered by 54 nuclear power plants. When an electric car gets
plugged into the wall at night for recharging, or an aluminum plant is
running to produce the millions of tons of aluminum needed in a modern
society, everyone in [France knows it is nuclear, not fossil fuel,
providing the power. France has demonstrated that even a capitalist
economy can rid itself of fossil fuels if it deploys
nuclear.]{.underline}

There is nothing objectionable about wind and solar power *per se*. They
can be useful and should be deployed in a limited fashion depending on
local conditions (their ability to displace coal and gas is overstated;
they are married to both, as the experiences of Germany and Denmark,
where wind and solar power are deployed widely, have shown). But it is
nuclear power that Socialists should be fighting for: it is power on
demand 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year; and every
megawatt produced by a nuclear plant can displace, *permanently*, an
equal number of MWs produced from fossil fuels. No renewable source of
energy, save for hydro-electricity (which has limited potential) can
make the same claim. This fact alone should disqualify renewables for
serious consideration as the solution to climate change.

While massive amounts of renewable energy has been deployed in Europe,
not a single fossil-fuel plant has been phased out as a result.
[Nuclear, however, immediately displaces a fossil-fuel generation
plant]{.underline}. China, which today has 30 nuclear plants under
construction, would be building 30 coal-fired plants if the nation could
not or was not allowed to go nuclear. [[Socialists should]{.mark} not
only be [defend]{.mark}ing [the right of]{.mark} developing [countries
to build nuclear power plants]{.mark}, we should be [demanding]{.mark}
the bosses' [governments do so]{.mark}, and expand its deployment. We
should be fighting for workers governments to come to power to organize
society along the lines outlined here.]{.underline}

[[Socialists should oppose waste]{.mark} and inefficiency.]{.underline}
These problems are worse in underdeveloped countries than in the
advanced countries, but because per-capita energy use is much higher in
the latter any amount of wasted energy generally compounds already
existing problems from garbage to over-extraction of resources to
pollution, as well as climate change. We should be *for* conservation
and efficiency as a function of any rational society based on human
needs and not profit.

But this doesn't mean lowering anyone's standard of living (except the
bankers and bosses, of course[!). It really means a full-on
reorganization of our productive and consumption capacity with the goal
of raising the development level of the underdeveloped world in a
rational and democratic manner]{.underline}, no longer under the
jackboot of imperialism.

What does this mean, really, in many underdeveloped countries where only
10 percent of the population has access to electricity? Does it mean a
50-inch flat-screen LCD television? A 24-cubic-foot sub-zero
refrigerator? Central air conditioning and two SUVs in the front of a
3,000-square-foot home? Of course not. And yet, this seems to be what so
many think when they object to raising the standard of living of the
billions in underdeveloped countries to those of the West.

No[, it means this: it means the *right to generate and use
electricity*]{.underline}. The right to the ubiquitous light switch we
take for granted in the West. It means electric light available
day *and* night, whenever an individual decides he or she wants to read,
whenever a student wants to study. It means at least a small
refrigerator where leftovers can be chilled without spoiling. It means a
laptop computer and access to the Internet. It means, perhaps, a small
television. It means some air conditioning, perhaps only in one room, so
children don't suffer diseases brought on by increasing temperatures in
our world. It means an electric hotplate or stovetop so the 30,000 women
and children who die every year in India from cooking with charcoal
indoors can live. That is what energy means, and that is why we need
more of it, *a lot more*, and why it has to be carbon free. This is what
it will take to make all of Africa, India, and most of South Asia
"developed."

The antinuclear movement condemns billions of people to decades' more
energy starvation because of misplaced liberal guilt over greenhouse gas
emissions. Rather than coming up with truly better ways to produce
energy, this movement wants us to down-gear and "use less." This is why
[antinuclear idealism should be characterized as
a *reactionary* response to the climate crisis, and it explains why
Socialists who adapt to the Green ideology have lost their
bearings.]{.underline}

[Small Modular Reactors ([SMRs]{.mark}) of 30MW to 300MWs can be built
in mass production lines, lowering their cost. They can be set up in
rural parts of any country and have an electricity grid literally built
around them that [could]{.mark}, eventually, [be connected to]{.mark}
and form [a national grid]{.mark} that would enhance development and
raise people's standard of living. There are [only two things holding
this up:]{.mark}]{.underline}

1.  [[Imperialism]{.mark}, which has been breaking up countries,
    fomenting civil wars, and destroying the national economies of these
    countries.]{.underline}

2.  [The [antinuclear/Green movement]{.mark}, which views any
    development in general as harming the planet, and sees nuclear
    energy as particularly evil.]{.underline}

For Socialists to recapture the true vision of Marxism and the early
revolutionaries of the 19^th^ and 20th centuries means learning the
lessons of the downside of the development of the productive forces such
as climate change. It means using science and technology to alleviate
and reverse the environmental damage capitalism has created, so we can
live up to Marx's vision of a new society:

"Society will take all forces of production and means of commerce, as
well as the exchange and distribution of products, out of the hands of
private capitalists and will manage them in accordance with a plan based
on the availability of resources and the needs of the whole society. In
this way, most important of all, [the evil consequences which are now
associated with the conduct of big industry will be
abolished.]{.underline}

"There will be no more crises; the expanded production, which for the
present order of society is overproduction and hence a prevailing cause
of misery, will then be insufficient and in need of being expanded much
further."

### Link Turn---Ports/Shipping---2AC

####  Ports are a key component of anti-capitalist economies

Department of History and Sociology at the University of British
Columbia, Okanagan; 3-18-2021; accessed 7-19-2025; Sage Journals;

[[Ports]{.mark} play a specific and [important]{.mark} role [in modern
societies]{.mark}. As central transport hubs of commodities, people and
information, [they]{.mark} [link]{.mark} coastal cities and [places and
economies]{.mark} around the world, and, in turn, connect those same
cities and their regional hinterlands. Those transactions, additionally,
[become vehicles for channeling]{.mark} financial
[resources]{.mark}.]{.underline} The economic role of ports is in some
ways the most visible, but with it comes social, political and cultural
relevance and innovation. Ports, and port cities, in short, are urban
centers with unique dynamics, embedded in a territorially situated mesh
of laws, culture, structure and habits, but also connected regionally
and even globally by shipping routines.1

In the light of this, how is the Cold War relevant to the history of
port cities? It divided the world into different blocs and models with
different ideologies and political and economic systems, with
significant consequences for ports. Simplifying things, and leaving out
Non-Aligned states for the time being, we can describe the two blocs in
this way: states allied with the United States, which reaffirmed their
commitment to open and democratic, if unequal, societies founded on
liberal values and a free-market economy; and the Socialist Bloc, which
proposed an alternative model, founded on the planned, command economy,
the mobilization of society behind the transformation of society, the
limitation of personal rights in the interest of the collectivity,
surveillance and closed borders.

The [[history of ports in socialist states]{.mark} has been almost
entirely [neglected]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yet, certain [features of the
[Socialist]{.mark} [Bloc]{.mark} make it particularly
[intriguing]{.mark} [for the study of ports]{.mark} and port cities --
most prominently, [its rejection of]{.mark} the [free market and]{.mark}
its [desire to]{.mark} prevent or [limit contact with non-Bloc
states]{.mark}.]{.underline} Ports in socialist states were in some
respects predestined to become places of tension and contradiction,
which distinguish them from port cities elsewhere. [[In a]{.mark}
political [system that]{.mark} preferred [closed borders, ports
symbolized]{.mark} the ['gates to the world']{.mark}; in an economic
system that was thoroughly planned, [ports]{.mark} became [the main
contact point for global trade outside]{.mark} of [a planned
economy]{.mark}.]{.underline} In many ways, socialist ports were places
of exception: heightened contact with the rest of the world went hand in
hand with heightened control; the relative permeability of ports as
border regions allowed for intensified smuggling, black marketeering or
defection. Because of their permeable nature, socialist ports may also
be considered places of increased potential for political protest and
dissent.

This Forum aims to identify the specificity of [[socialist ports]{.mark}
by examining their functioning and [embedded]{.mark}ness [within
different networks]{.mark} [throughout]{.mark} the second half of [the
twentieth century]{.mark}.]{.underline} We include Yugoslavia in our
exploration of this topic, prior to the early 1960s, when it liberalized
its border regime and took on a leadership role in the Non-Aligned
Movement. Although excluded from the Socialist Bloc in 1948, it shared
many features with Socialist Bloc states, including its adherence to an
alternative ideology and political and economic system, a history of
friction with capitalist states, and highly regulated borders. We focus
on the locality (socialist ports as specific economic, political or
social sites, as spaces within cities), on the agents (e.g. national and
local authorities, workers and ship personnel within a highly
international working environment), on networks (between ports both
socialist and non-socialist, as well as the interface between ports and
other entities, such as railways) and on changes and continuities during
(economic, political, social) transformations.

Space Exploration for the People How can space exploration serve
society? [Our **[first priority]{.mark}** must be to
**[decarbonize]{.mark}** [space]{.mark} flight. Without achieving this,
the emissions that space flight generates are hardly justifiable given
the state of our planet. Like the space blanket and cochlear implant,
the applications of zero-carbon jet fuel would go far beyond the space
program that developed it]{.underline}. Commercial aviation contributes
an estimated 3.5 percent of effective radiative forcing --- a figure
that space tourism could skyrocket. [Due to the weight of batteries and
other logistical challenges, hydrogen fuel cells are considered one of
the few viable pathways to decarbonizing long-distance flight. While
some private space corporations have begun incorporating hydrogen, the
fuel production is likely emissions-intensive and the technology remains
proprietary.]{.underline} A publicly directed moonshot research program,
coupled with tight restrictions on fossil-fueled rocket launches, could
greatly accelerate the implementation of green hydrogen fuel cells in
aviation and other difficult-to-decarbonize sectors. [In addition to our
atmosphere, [we must respect]{.mark} the [sanctity]{.mark} [of orbital
space]{.mark}, which we have littered with trash]{.underline}. The
Defense Department's Space Surveillance Network currently estimates
there are more than twenty-seven thousand pieces of debris orbiting
Earth. Yet even as their own ships run a gauntlet of garbage,
billionaires are trashing space more than ever. While perhaps none match
the vanity of the Tesla Roadster, competing commercial satellite
networks like Musk's Starlink and Bezos' Project Kuiper actually pose a
much greater collision threat and are also egregious sources of light
pollution and electromagnetic interference. These redundant and
dangerous monuments to the egos of oligarchs ought to be taken down from
our skies along with other forms of space trash. Rather than granting
billions in subsidies to enable this pollution,
[**[governments]{.mark}** should instead **[collect]{.mark}** the
**[taxes]{.mark}** that corporations like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and
Virgin Galactic have evaded and use them [to create **public
sector**]{.mark} [careers]{.mark} cleaning up their mess. To the extent
that it is useful, publicly sponsored [infrastructure in private
hands]{.mark} [should be **nationalized**]{.mark} and made accessible to
all.]{.underline} The trade-offs between telecommunications
infrastructure and preservation of dark skies highlight another core
failure of NASA's past: the lack of a planetary internationalism. In
2013, the Bolivian Space Agency and the China National Space
Administration collaboratively launched the Túpac Katari 1 satellite
(TKSat 1), demonstrating how easy it could be to close the space
infrastructure gap between the Global North and South. The same year
that the United States proposed to desecrate a Hawaiian sacred site for
a telescope, [[Bolivia used space tech]{.mark}nology [to bring internet
and cell service]{.mark} for the first time [to millions]{.mark} of
Andean and Amazonian citizens.]{.underline} Since then[, [TKSat]{.mark}
1 has [boosted education]{.mark} and development initiatives and even
[helped defend Bolivian democracy]{.mark} by relaying the transmissions
of campesinos resisting the US-backed coup government in real time.
[Satellites]{.mark} can serve many other public interests, such as
facilitating research that [help]{.mark}s [scientists monitor problems
like **climate change, deforestation, and forced labor**]{.mark}. While
today's satellite infrastructure is used to commercialize communication
and fuel mass surveillance, an international consensus to treat
telecommunications and information access as public rights could instead
provide free global broadband coverage with minimal infrastructure,
[balancing scientific advancement with]{.mark} our [collective view of
the stars]{.mark}.]{.underline} Finally, a [**[socialist
vision]{.mark}** for space exploration could [enable us to reach]{.mark}
our **[full]{.mark} [potential]{.mark}** to venture into the
unknown]{.underline}. History enshrines the intrepid explorers, but the
true heroes of the space age are the workers at ground control. Yuri
Gagarin made it home safely because of his command crews stationed from
Baikonur to Khabarovsk. Apollo 13 famously called on Houston when they
had a problem. Today, many of our brightest astrophysicists and
aerospace engineers are swept up by military departments and weapons
manufacturers. We should use their talents for science and education
instead. That doesn't mean, however, colonizing Mars. The Red Planet is
a cosmic wonder, but a dreadful place for Earthlings. It has very little
carbon dioxide, and no amount of terraforming will reinstate the
magnetic dynamo that once deflected the solar winds now stripping away
its depleted atmosphere. In fact, everything we have learned from
researching Mars has reinforced the importance of protecting the fragile
atmosphere of our home planet. While piloted space flights may be useful
in some situations, we should place far more emphasis on collaboratively
building robots like the ones that have taught us about our planetary
neighbors. In today's space race, these initiatives compete for funding.
[By prioritizing **cooperation** over colonization, however, we could
pursue them all. [We]{.mark} [could]{.mark} attempt to [retrieve]{.mark}
raw [materials for green energy infrastructure]{.mark} from
decommissioned satellites [and uninhabited asteroids instead of]{.mark}
mines in [the Global South]{.mark}]{.underline}. We could search the
solar system for extraterrestrial life by flying rotorcrafts into the
hydrocarbon-rich atmosphere of Titan and boring submarines into the icy
subsurface ocean of Europa. We could strive for the first landing on
Pluto, Eris, or even beyond --- not to plant a flag, but seed a concept
of what we can collectively achieve. Visions of Hopeful Futures In his
final years of reflection on our Pale Blue Dot, astronomer Carl Sagan
pondered, "Where are the cartographers of human purpose? Where are the
visions of hopeful futures of technology as a tool for human betterment
and not a gun on hair trigger pointed at our heads?" Sagan's legacy ---
including the world's first and only interstellar mission --- offers a
glimpse of this vision. [We can choose to collaboratively probe into the
depths of the cosmos, conveying collections of human
knowledge,]{.underline} or to taxi billionaires to spend four minutes at
the edge of space[, indulging their fantasy of escaping the planet
they're poisoning with the very fuel propelling them. In either case,
the [financial]{.mark}, [intellectual, and human costs]{.mark} will be
[borne by the public]{.mark}.]{.underline} Fortunately, if there's one
thing that space exploration has taught us, it's that fate isn't written
in the stars. That happens down here on Earth

### Link---AT: Market Logics---2AC---Short

#### Market logics aren't singular or uniform, and the technical details of the plan matter [more]{.underline} for determining their impacts than our [orientation]{.underline}.

**Reamer, 23**---Lecturer, Department of Political Economy, King's
College London (Robert, "Which Markets, Whose Rationality? Markets as
Polyvalent Political Devices," American Political Science Review (2023)
117, 4, 1228--1240, dml)

Adopting the "performativity" paradigm, Caliskan and Callon (Reference
Caliskan and Callon2010) conceive of markets as assemblages, networks of
humans and nonhumans that allow for the circulation of products and the
facilitation of exchange. [[Markets]{.mark} do]{.underline}, indeed,
[[format the world]{.mark} and effect alterations in things and
actors]{.underline}, [[but **not** by]{.mark} means of the imposition of
[a **predetermined**]{.mark} **market [logic]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[What logic a market will come to have is a question to be determined by
its sociotechnical constitution]{.underline}, **[not presumed a
priori]{.underline}**. [[Differences in]{.mark} equipment]{.underline},
[[tech]{.mark}nology]{.underline}, [[laws]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and
norms will lead to **different types**]{.mark} of market arrangements
[operating according to **different laws** and entailing
**different**]{.mark}]{.underline} distributive
**[[consequences]{.underline}]{.mark}** (23--5). [Markets can be
established in a **diversity** of ways]{.underline}; [there is **no
paradigmatic instance**]{.underline}.

This complication of the typical framing of markets does not by any
means suggest that marketization is an unproblematic panacea for solving
society's complex problems. There is no doubt that market mechanisms can
differentially distribute capacities for calculation and negotiation,
resulting in important asymmetries of information and power.Footnote 16
Marketization, in its responsibilizing vein, can also neglect structural
injustice and consequential differentials in access to resources.
Indeed, Caliskan and Callon suggest that one benefit of studying
marketization from an ANT perspective is the way it draws our attention
to the various forms of "equipment" that differentially empower the
calculative capacities of agents (Reference Caliskan and Callon2010, 12;
in general, see Callon and Muniesa Reference Callon and Muniesa2005 on
"collective calculating devices"). The upshot of such research, with its
attention to the diversity of market arrangements and their inherently
political dimensions, is not that markets are uniformly beneficial,
efficient, or self-regulating. Rather, it turns our attention to the
fact that [it is often the]{.underline} "**[details]{.underline}**"
[and]{.underline} "**[technicalities]{.underline}**" [of market design
[rather than]{.mark} the]{.underline} "**[[macro]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
[questions of]{.underline} state versus market
[**[orientations]{.mark}** that are of **tremendous political
import**]{.underline} (MacKenzie Reference MacKenzie2009, 182). This
research tradition thus calls into question many of our assumptions
regarding the "stable scale" of action (33). It is often the case that
[relatively **[minor]{.mark}** and [**technical differences** in market
design]{.mark} and implementation [have **enormous consequences**
for]{.mark} determining [which agents are **empowered**]{.mark} by a
given market [and]{.mark} which are **[dominated]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

In this view, actors possess differential abilities to participate in
markets depending on the "equipment" (technological and cognitive) and
resources that they possess and on the overall structure of the market
environment with which they interact. [This makes the **provision** of
such resources and the **refashioning** of such structures an eminently
political issue]{.underline} (Callon Reference Callon, Pinch and
Swedberg2008).Footnote 17 Far from amounting to an unbridled celebration
of markets, studies of marketization discover an ambivalent reality: "it
is by affirming the autonomy of calculating agencies that markets are
able to conceal and to legitimately impose the asymmetries that develop
out of the achievement of calculative capacities" (Caliskan and Callon
Reference Caliskan and Callon2010, 13). Thus Caliskan and Callon claim
that "studying the shaping of market agencies is promising and fertile.
It enables us to grasp and to document the sociotechnical diversity of
agencies and of the forms they take, the complexity of their calculative
capacities and relations of domination which develop between
agencements" (Reference Caliskan and Callon2010, 14). [**Detailed
analysis** of markets]{.underline} as STAs [allows theorists
to]{.underline} "[**renew the analysis** of the power struggles at the
**heart** of any market]{.underline}" (12).

### Link---AT: Market Logics---2AC---Long

#### There's no such thing as a singular, overarching "market logic" and assuming there is one is [more neoliberal]{.underline}.

**Reamer, 23**---Lecturer, Department of Political Economy, King's
College London (Robert, "Which Markets, Whose Rationality? Markets as
Polyvalent Political Devices," American Political Science Review (2023)
117, 4, 1228--1240, dml)

Despite its immense influence and usefulness, however, I argue that
Polanyi's approach has also bequeathed to us a problematic theoretical
framing whose shortcomings hinder our efforts to grapple with
contemporary problems of political economy. His analysis was undoubtedly
salutary in highlighting the problematic features of economic
liberalism's violent imposition of pitiless monetary logics on societies
organized according to alternative moral economies. This line of
[criticism]{.underline}---[of]{.underline} the devastating consequences
of [attempting to reduce **all** social relationships to commodified
exchange]{.underline}---is of lasting relevance to contemporary concerns
over rampant economic inequality and the cruel responsibilization
attending the "great risk shift" of recent decades (see Hacker Reference
Hacker2006). In developing this trenchant analysis, however, Polanyi
also inadvertently reinforced some of economic liberalism's central
claims regarding the fundamental incompatibility between the logic of
the market and that of society, morality, and politics. In doing so, he
helped to erect an opposition---"the market" versus "society"---that
continues to shape debates over capitalism, liberalism, and justice.

This paper argues that the framework derived from the Polanyian
tradition [continues to structure our critical imaginations in ways that
are **severely limiting**]{.underline}. To reiterate, I wholeheartedly
affirm Polanyi's basic insight that the violent subordination of
vulnerable populations to monetary logics, supported by the coercive arm
of the state, was and is a gross violation of justice and a source of
immense suffering, immiseration, and domination. The persuasiveness of
[this analysis]{.underline}, however, [should not cause us to
**overlook** the **problematic features** of the theoretical framework
in which it is embedded]{.underline}. As a result of [this]{.underline}
framing, I argue, Polanyi's (correct) [insight that society has needs
that are independent of monetary considerations has been **expanded**
into the **more general conviction** that **markets as such** inherently
possess dehumanizing]{.underline} and/or antipolitical [logics and
should thus be opposed]{.underline} in the name of alternative logics
that are more humane and democratic. In short, [the market has
**itself** become an object of political opposition]{.underline},
calling for critique and resistance from anyone concerned with defending
freedom, equality, and humanity as choiceworthy political values.
Although Polanyi's normative judgments were surely sound,
[the]{.underline} social-theoretic [framework]{.underline} in which he
articulated them [leaves us with an **inadequate grasp** of the nature
of market forms]{.underline} (and thus with an impoverished
understanding of contemporary politics).

It is this framing that this paper seeks to explicate and contest.
Although it is surely true that the forms of commodification and
marketization that Polanyi so ably critiqued were unjust and deserving
of political opposition, [we should [resist the
**generalization**]{.mark}]{.underline} of this observation
[[into]{.mark} the **[broader]{.mark} claim** that emancipatory politics
entails [opposition to **market logics as such**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Indeed, [the **very notion** of a]{.underline} "**[market
logic]{.underline}**," I shall argue, [is **confused** to begin
with]{.underline}. As will be demonstrated below, [insightful
[work]{.mark} in economic sociology [has **questioned**]{.mark} the
coherence of the view that [anything like a]{.mark} **[singular market
logic]{.mark}** can be identified]{.underline}. In particular, new
materialist economic [sociology has developed a compelling view of
markets as]{.underline} sociotechnical [**assemblages** subject to a
**wide range** of applications and political inflections]{.underline}.
In this view, markets are best seen as devices, "sociotechnical
agencements,"Footnote 2 that recompose and redistribute forms of agency
and capacities for calculation and exchange. [The disciplinary and
[class-biased]{.mark} imposition of particular [market]{.mark}
form[s]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as those associated with the "stark
utopia" of economic liberalism analyzed by Polanyi, [[are
**one**]{.underline}]{.mark}---particularly worrisome and
unjust---[**[form]{.mark}** in which markets can be politically
constituted and deployed]{.underline}. However, [objecting to this
particular form of market imposition leaves open the question of what
other forms of market organization might be available]{.underline}, what
political projects they might play a role in advancing, and which
political values they might aid in securing.

As I argue below, the framing derived from the actor-network theory
(ANT) research tradition questions the rigid binary between "market" and
"political" logics. Drawing on the work of Michel Callon, Donald
MacKenzie, and Timothy Mitchell, I suggest that [the notion of
a]{.underline} putatively "free" [market]{.underline}---unencumbered by
politics and existing [as a purified domain of technical
calculation]{.underline}---[is itself an **ideological legacy** of the
disciplinary form of market liberalism]{.underline} critiqued by
Polanyi.Footnote 3 [[To oppose the market in the name of
politics]{.underline}]{.mark} (or society) [[is to **capitulate** to the
fantasy of]{.mark} the possibility of [a free]{.mark} and apolitical
[space of]{.mark} purely [technical calculation]{.mark} and
exchange]{.underline} (see Mitchell Reference Mitchell2002, 3--9 and
chap. 3). It is this very framing that the ANT tradition exposes as
fallacious. The ambition of economic liberalism was, in fact, to impose
a specific class-biased form of domination on a politically vulnerable
segment of society and to mask this coercive political project with the
veneer of apolitical, technical rationality and timeless economic
laws.Footnote 4

If, however, the very notion of a pure domain of technical calculation,
unencumbered by politics, is itself an ideological obfuscation, then [it
is a **mistake** to allow the framing of market versus political logics
to **ground one's resistance**]{.underline} to such disciplinary and
class-biased projects. [Recognizing that markets are infused with
politics and have a **variety** of rationalities and logics potentially
associated with them raises the question of the role that market
arrangements]{.underline}---considered not as apolitical mechanisms but
as sociotechnical agencements---[might play in an **emancipatory
politics**]{.underline}. Such a politics would remain opposed to the
form of market imposition that the Polanyian critique exposed and
criticized. However, it would maintain that [[alternative market
logics]{.mark} are **available** and might [provide **useful
resources**]{.mark} [for]{.mark} those who are intent on
[opposing]{.mark} the unjust sociopolitical dynamics associated with
contemporary [neolib]{.mark}eralism]{.underline}. [Markets]{.underline},
seen as polyvalent political tools, [prove]{.underline} to be
[**compatible** with a **much wider range** of political projects and
commitments]{.underline} than contemporary political discourse allows.

The argument proceeds in three sections. First, I explicate Polanyi's
framework through an engagement with the insightful work of Block and
Somers (Reference Block and Somers2014). I show that even their
sophisticated interpretation of Polanyi does not altogether escape the
theoretical confusions noted above. I then introduce an alternative
theoretical framework derived from actor-network theory, which is
capable of giving "the Polanyian intuition---that economics is a
political institution and a social project (Polanyi Reference
Polanyi2001)---the theoretical scheme it was lacking" (Cochoy,
Giraudeau, and McFall Reference Cochoy, Giraudeau and McFall2010).
Having presented this alternative paradigm, I then illustrate its
usefulness by showing how it can help to clarify recent debates in
political theory between neo-republican advocates of market mechanisms
and one of their most trenchant Polanyian critics.

"The Market" against "The Political"

[Much criticism]{.underline} of contemporary social and political life
involves the claim that we are, either actually or aspirationally,
dominated by the market. Wendy Brown [has]{.underline} famously
[associated neoliberalism with the desire to **marketize all domains**
of social life]{.underline} (Brown Reference Brown2015). Jamie Peck has
identified neoliberalism with an aspiration to frictionless market rule
(Peck Reference Peck2010). Wolfgang Streeck has described contemporary
capitalism as embodying the dominance of market logics over the
incompatible political logic of democracy (Streeck Reference
Streeck2014a; Reference Streeck2014b). Gerald Davis (Reference
Davis2009) has characterized the contemporary political condition of
Americans as that of being "managed by the market." In various forms and
various guises, [the dominance of markets in organizing social and
political life is decried as a **major source** of inequality and
exploitation]{.underline} in our contemporary experience. Much of this
work draws, explicitly or implicitly, on Polanyi's seminal intervention,
which identified the "stark utopia" of economic liberalism as involving
the aspiration to "\[run\] society as an adjunct to the market" (Polanyi
Reference Polanyi2001, 3, 60).

As commentators have noted, Polanyi's influential account in The Great
Transformation seems to contain an unresolved tension (see Block
Reference Block2003; Block and Somers Reference Block and Somers2014).
Over the course of the book, he frames his argument in divergent (and
potentially incompatible) ways. Thus he sometimes seems to claim that
running society "as an adjunct to the market" is practically
undesirable, as it will lead to the "demolition of society" (Polanyi
Reference Polanyi2001, 76). In this view, "the market" and "society"
have incompatible logics, so disembedding the market has deleterious
consequences. At other times, Polanyi seems to suggest that the economy
is always embedded in society. In this view, there is no such thing as
disembedding the market; even what was called "laissez-faire" was
actually "planned" and required ongoing state intervention (146--7). So
understood, Polanyi's work seems to claim that disembedding the market
is both dangerous (because society cannot bear being subjected to such a
self-regulating mechanism) and conceptually impossible (because such a
"self-regulating mechanism" is a fiction). It is not clear how these two
claims are meant to fit together.

Block and Somers have helpfully explored this ambiguity, arguing that
the second formulation, which they term the "always-embedded economy"
thesis, is Polanyi's most insightful discovery. In their view, Polanyi's
earlier formulation arises "from the Marxist conceptual framework that
had been the initial organizing framework for his book" (Block and
Somers Reference Block and Somers2014, 81). Over the course of writing
the book, his investigations caused him to move beyond this perspective
and develop the always-embedded economy thesis. Because he did not have
time to revise the book's argument before publishing, the text retains
both perspectives, despite their incompatibility (Block Reference
Block2003, 284--5; Block and Somers, Reference Block and Somers2014,
82).

Despite the thoughtfulness of this intervention, I suggest that a
similar (though somewhat more subtle) ambiguity remains even in the
analysis offered by Block and Somers. This ambiguity is evident in their
explication of the always-embedded economy thesis. When this thesis is
first introduced, it is said to involve the observation that "even
'free' market economies consist of cultural understandings, shared
values, legal rules, and a wide range of governmental actions that make
market exchange possible" (Block and Somers Reference Block and
Somers2014, 9). This, they claim, is a fundamental reality that
"\[e\]conomists deny" (9). Thus all claims to "disembed" the economy in
the name of the free market are deceptive. Although "market ideologues"
may claim that they are "setting the market free from the state," in
reality they are merely "re-embedding it in different political, legal,
and cultural arrangements, ones that mostly disadvantage the poor and
the middle class and advantage wealth and corporate interests" (9;
italics in original).

This persuasive view of embeddedness, however, is modified in their
subsequent exposition. In their later analysis of "the concept of the
always-embedded economy," Block and Somers describe this thesis as
entailing "that market societies must construct elaborate rules and
institutional structures to limit the individual pursuit of gain or risk
degenerating into a Hobbesian war of all against all" (Block and Somers
Reference Block and Somers2014, 94). The next sentence reaffirms this
viewpoint: "In order to have the benefits of increased efficiency that
are supposed to flow from market competition, these societies must first
limit the pursuit of gain by assuring that not everything is for sale to
the highest bidder" (94). Notice the subtle shift in meaning that the
concept of embeddedness undergoes in this passage. Initially, the
embeddedness thesis involved the claim that all market arrangements
(including those advocated by free market ideologues) involve different
forms of embeddedness. Yet in the second formulation, embeddedness is
identified specifically with rules and institutions that limit or
constrain profit-seeking activity. This reintroduces a normative
component into what was previously a descriptive claim. It is not simply
that markets are always embedded (in the sense that they rely on rules
and institutions) but that this embeddedness must constrain
profit-seeking activity (because the preservation of society requires
it).

This second formulation is in clear tension with the first. The first
presentation of embeddedness suggests that there is no such thing as
"the market." Markets always interact with legal and cultural
institutions that give them a particular shape. Thus, as observed above,
even "free market ideologues" are actually proposing alternative forms
of embeddedness. Yet throughout their analysis, Block and Somers also
speak of embeddedness as serving to protect society from "unmediated
market forces" (Reference Block and Somers2014, 10) and "unfettered
markets" (201). If markets are always embedded, however, such
formulations are incoherent. They imply that a disembedded market is a
real possibility (albeit an undesirable one).

This ambiguity is a legacy of the Polanyian framing with which
contemporary political theory needs to contend. Those drawing on
Polanyi, inheriting this unresolved tension, tend to shift between these
two different meanings of embeddedness. They sometimes argue that
markets cannot, as a factual matter, be disembedded (because they are
always governed by rules, institutions, etc.) and thus that the very
idea of free markets is incoherent. At other times, however, they
suggest that we should be wary of "unmediated market forces" because
they are incompatible with the flourishing of society (a claim that
relies upon the idea of an essential market logic that the first thesis
disavows). Clarifying the political nature of markets, and the meaning
of their embeddedness, is thus crucial to gaining clarity on
contemporary debates about their role in contemporary politics.

Material Markets as Sociotechnical Agencements

Much of the debate over market forms in contemporary life has been
conducted in terms of advocacy of or opposition to the free market. In
this view, markets naturally operate according to their intrinsic,
impersonal logics. Critics suggest that government intervention should
"tame" these markets, regulating away their most objectionable features
or restraining them to carve out a space for politics. Advocates hold
either that market logics spontaneously emerge in the absence of
political interference or that political intervention is necessary as a
supplement to ensure that markets function according to their true
competitive logic. Both approaches, however, participate in the
fundamental framing of markets contested in this paper. They suggest
that a natural or pure form of the market exists, prior to and outside
of political meddling.Footnote 5 They then envision forms of politics
that can either restrain or preserve the natural "logics" possessed by
market forms. Yet, as Block and Somers affirm, what is called the free
market by both apologists and critics is in fact constituted by a whole
host of political choices, conditions, and enabling devices.Footnote 6
The very designation free market is an attempt to occlude this reality,
framing the "neutral" market position as if it were apolitical and
technical and then opposing this to an "interventionist" position in
which politics contaminates or alters the logic of the market. It is
this very notion of an originary, natural market, freed from the
constraints of political judgment, that the perspective developed here
seeks to contest.

A sophisticated and productive line of thinking about this problem has
been pursued in a lineage originating with Michel Callon's Reference
Callon1998 work The Laws of Markets. There and in much subsequent work,
Callon develops a view of markets that depicts them not as abstract
mechanisms but as "collective calculating devices."Footnote 7 In this
view, [markets are collective material]{.underline}
"**[devices]{.underline}**" [that furnish agents with capacities they
would otherwise **lack**]{.underline}. [Markets establish
**equivalences** and make possible calculations that enable
**coordination** among agents]{.underline}. In this work, [markets
are]{.underline} analyzed **[not]{.underline}** as [**rigid** or
**timeless abstractions** but]{.underline} as **[concrete
material]{.underline}** "**[apparatuses]{.underline}**" [that
differentially empower agents]{.underline}, [equip them with new
capacities]{.underline}, [and reshape the world]{.underline} by
establishing equivalencies between and among what were previously
heterogeneous and qualitatively distinct entities. The upshot of this
view, he claims, is that [[it is]{.underline} "[**wrong** to talk
of]{.underline}]{.mark} laws or, worse still, of **[[the law of the
market]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [There exist [only
**temporary**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [**changing**
laws]{.underline}]{.mark} [associated [with **specific**
markets]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Callon Reference Callon1998, 47). This
implies, as a subsequent paper clarified, that "**[more than
one]{.underline}** '**[logic]{.underline}**' [**exists** for markets and
even for capitalism]{.underline}" (Callon and Muniesa Reference Callon
and Muniesa2005, 1243).

[[The view]{.underline}]{.mark} he develops [[**avoids** both]{.mark}
the]{.underline} "naturalizing" [tendencies of **[neoclassical]{.mark}
economics** [and]{.mark} the [theories]{.mark}]{.underline} of "social
construction" [which assume]{.underline}, in essence, [[that economics
is]{.mark} **purely [ideological]{.mark}**]{.underline}, akin to a
modern religion.Footnote 8 As Callon states of his initial findings, "we
have to be wary of the catch-all that socioeconomics likes to use as a
rallying cry: the market is socially constructed. What is under
construction is precisely this heterogeneous collective, populated by
calculating agencies. Society is not a starting point, a resource, or a
frame; it is, along with the market, the temporary outcome of a process
in which social sciences---economics in this case---are the stakeholder"
(Callon Reference Callon1998, 30). This observation runs like a red
thread through the subsequent research program inaugurated by the
application of ANT to the study of market processes. Markets will no
longer be considered as natural entities with rigid and timeless laws,
but neither will they be treated as merely fictitious or ideological.
Rather, markets will be seen as participating in the ongoing
"performation"Footnote 9 of the world: as sociotechnical agencements
that create equivalences, provide the capacity for "collective
calculation," and differentially distribute agency, power, and resources
(see Caliskan and Callon Reference Caliskan and Callon2010; Callon and
Muniesa Reference Callon and Muniesa2005).

This research program has been developed during the past two decades by
[a **wide array** of]{.underline} scholars with varied and fascinating
results. This vast literature is too expansive to be reviewed in detail
here.Footnote 10 Although theoretical disagreements certainly abound,
there are several shared convictions that have emerged in this
literature and are relevant to the present discussion. Most centrally,
**[studies]{.underline}** carried out on markets in their material
diversity [have led scholars to conclude that thinking in terms
of]{.underline} "**[the market]{.underline}**" [is **inherently
inadequate**]{.underline} for engaging contemporary political concerns
over the growing role of economics, finance, and markets in collective
life. Central to the tradition associated with Callon and ANT is a
concern with understanding markets not as ideological abstractions but
as "sociotechnical agencements" (Caliskan and Callon Reference Caliskan
and Callon2009; Reference Caliskan and Callon2010; MacKenzie Reference
MacKenzie2009). This means that markets are material assemblages
composed of humans and nonhumans; they link people, technologies,
knowledge, and goods in vast collectives that format the world and
create novel linkages among "actants."Footnote 11 [Markets]{.underline},
in this view, [are]{.underline} resolutely "**[material]{.underline}**,"
[and whatever calculative capacity they possess is a result of their
having been formatted in a **particular manner**]{.underline}. They are
devices that make possible distributed forms of agency, calculation, and
exchange (Callon and Muniesa Reference Callon and Muniesa2005).

The notion of agencement has a complex lineage and lacks a single,
clear-cut definition. Caliskan and Callon define the term by stating
that "action, including its reflexive dimension which produces meaning,
takes place in hybrid collectives (Callon and Law Reference Callon and
Law1995), hereafter called sociotechnical agencements (STAs).
Sociotechnical agencements are comprised of human beings (bodies) as
well as material, technical and textual devices" (Caliskan and Callon
Reference Caliskan and Callon2010, 9). Though "agencement" has often
been translated as "assemblage" in academic literature, MacKenzie points
out that this effaces a helpful play on words present in the original
French. Agencement literally means "arrangement" and thus emphasizes
questions of material and technical configuration. On the other hand,
however, the term agencement possesses an obvious etymological link to
the notion of "agency" (MacKenzie Reference MacKenzie2009, 21; see also
Callon Reference Callon, Pinch and Swedberg2008, 38). An agencement, in
other words, is a particular material configuration (a "network") of
humans and nonhumans that possesses unique capacities to act in and with
the world. Seeing the agencement as the unit of agency helps us to focus
on the relationships among actors, competences, technologies, and
knowledge that make complex forms of distributed agency possible.
Viewing markets as particular types of "sociotechnical agencements" thus
directs our attention to all of these dimensions: to the materiality of
markets; the way they rely upon combinations of technologies,
discourses, and knowledges; and the way they facilitate and embody novel
forms of action. This notion suggests that [markets]{.underline}, like
other forms of sociotechnical life, [are more **open**]{.underline},
**[polyvalent]{.underline}**, [and **flexible** than traditional
critical discourse has allowed]{.underline}.Footnote 12 It also means
that their construction, their maintenance, and the capacities with
which they equip agents are matters of deep political consequence. It
renders the development of any form of
"**[economization]{.underline}**," [including
**[marketization]{.mark}**]{.underline}, intelligible as an open process
that [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[historical]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[contingent]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and
**disputable**]{.underline}]{.mark}" (Muniesa, Millo, and Callon
Reference Muniesa, Millo and Callon2007, 3).

Caliskan and Callon (Reference Caliskan and Callon2009; Reference
Caliskan and Callon2010) have pursued some of the implications of this
way of thinking in their account of marketization. For Caliskan and
Callon, economization (of which marketization is a species) represents
an open-ended and experimental process rather than the imposition of an
abstract logic. Resisting both "formalist" (neoclassical)Footnote 13 and
"substantive" (Polanyian) readings of the "the economic," these thinkers
foreground "processes of economization," highlighting the processes
through which things become figured or qualified as economic (Caliskan
and Callon Reference Caliskan and Callon2009).Footnote 14 There is here
no essence of "the economy" or "the market" whose progressive
application (or resistance) we could hope to track (or endorse). Rather,
their analysis encourages us to ask a different set of questions,
attending to the different ways in which domains may be regarded and
configured as economized or marketized. [There is **not a singular
logic** to the market but a **cluster** of different practices and
technologies through which domains or objects can undergo
marketization]{.underline}. This involves a variety of diverse ways of
thinking and acting---with "action" here including the mobilization of
vast, heterogeneous, sociotechnical collectives.

## Impact/Sustainability

### Impact---Environment/Warming---2AC

#### Studies and data prove that market economies and free trade [solve]{.underline} the environment and emissions.

**Grafström, 24**---assistant professor at Luleå University of
Technology (Jonas, "Economic freedom and environmental performance,"
*Handbook of Research on Economic Freedom*, Chapter 23, pp. 349-353,
IEF=Index of Economic Freedom, EPI=Environmental Performance Index,
EFW=Economic Freedom of the World Index, dml)

Ibrahim (2018) studied middle-income countries and found that the
environmental benefit of international trade is materialized only if a
country has a well-functioning financial market. [Free [trade
**increases diffusion** of environmental]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nologies
[and]{.mark} **promotes [innovation]{.mark}**
[through]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example, **[knowledge
[spillovers]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[Grafström]{.underline}** (2017)
[finds that knowledge flows between countries promote the adoption of
**green technologies** and]{.underline} that [a **significant
component** of knowledge transfer occurs due to **trade**]{.underline}.
**[Amoah et al.]{.underline}** (2020) [studied **[32 African
countries]{.mark}** and [showed]{.mark} that an [increase in]{.mark}
trade freedom and business freedom]{.underline} (using the IEF)
[increases the share of [**renewables**]{.mark} in total energy
consumption]{.underline}.

The industrial layout of a country often changes as the economy
develops, from heavy labor-intensive industries to a service sector,
which is less capital-intensive (Stern 2004). [The association between
environment and economy reflects **structural change**]{.underline}:
countries transition [from an agricultural society to an industrial
economy and then to a service-oriented economy]{.underline}.
**[Jacqmin]{.underline}** (2018) [found that [**long-term price
stability** promotes renewable energy]{.mark} stability]{.underline}.
[Countries with a low industry share of GDP have **lower
emissions**]{.underline}, [while the **opposite** was true for countries
with a large industrial base]{.underline}. **[Jacqmin]{.underline}**
(2018) [studied the 28 member states of the]{.underline}
**[E]{.underline}**uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion from 2003 to 2012
[and found that freedom to trade **boosts** renewable energy
adoption]{.underline}. [**Older** research has pointed out that trade
openness can lead to more emissions]{.underline}, [but
**overall**]{.underline}, [it concludes that freer trade is **good** for
the environment]{.underline}. For example, **[Antweiler]{.underline}**
et al. (2001) [found it to reduce the concentration of emissions of
**sulphur dioxide**]{.underline}.

**[Tahir et al.]{.underline}** (2021) [studied **[South Asian]{.mark}
economies**]{.underline} over the period 1990--2014 [and found that
[trade]{.mark} openness [leads to tech]{.mark}nology [transfer
and]{.mark} long-running [development]{.mark} that led [to **reduced
emissions**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [One explanation of]{.underline} the
somewhat [**[contradictory results]{.mark}** is that what was true four
decades ago **might [not]{.mark} be [true anymore]{.mark}** since
technology has **developed**]{.underline}. [[Some countries]{.mark} that
have just opened up to trade might [have]{.mark} had [large initial
emissions but]{.mark} later [grown rich and refocus]{.mark}ed their
production and environmental regulations]{.underline}.

As seen in the review of the previous literature, the [results **vary**
a great deal]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} arguably [reflects that
the studies have been undertaken in different **decades**]{.underline},
[with different **measures** and with different

situation.

An ocular view of the EPI index [[shows]{.mark} that the
[environment]{.mark} in general [is **getting better**]{.mark} in many
countries]{.underline}. [**[One hundred]{.mark} and
[twenty-four]{.mark}** out of **180** [countries]{.mark} experienced an
[improved]{.mark} environment [in the last ten
years]{.mark}]{.underline}. Of the countries ranked 45 and above, only
Japan marginally worsened its environmental performance in the last
decade.

The average change in the index value for the countries in the best
quartile was +4.95, while the environment in the worst quartile of
countries deteriorated by an average of --0.96 on the 100-point scale.
The top 20 countries got a 4.92-point increase in their score, while the
bottom 20 on average got --1.06 points. The numbers for the countries
with the highest EPI scores are presented in Table 23.1. The countries
that improved the most among the top 20 countries were Luxembourg
(+11.6), the United Kingdom (+9) and Spain (+8.6). The countries that
fell the most among the 20 worst countries were Nepal (--10.3), Nigeria
(--6.1) and Ghana (--6.1).

While, for example, the United States is ranked as having a relatively
high economic freedom level with 7.97 in the EFW index and 74.8 in the
IEF, the country has a middle-level EPI score at 51.1. In the whole
sample, [the correlation between the EPI score and the IEF is
**strong**]{.underline}, 0.69, while the correlation with the EFW index
stands at 0.54. However, when looking at the correlation for the top 20
countries, it is weak: 0.12 for the IEF and 0.01 for the EFW index. The
same weakness can be seen among the bottom 20 countries, where there are
small negative correlations of --0.06 and --0.01. While the top
countries in the EPI ranking also, in general, have a high level of
economic freedom, their within-numbers vary a lot. Examples are France
and the United Kingdom, who are at number four and five in the EPI
ranking. Their IEF scores are 78.4 (United Kingdom) and 65.7 (France).
So, [when looking at the **whole world**]{.underline}, [a **clear
positive pattern** can be found]{.underline}, [but when looking at
subsamples]{.underline}, [the pattern is less clear]{.underline}.

Looking [at the **bottom** of the EPI]{.underline} list in Table 23.2,
[the level of economic freedom is **almost uniformly** on a much lower
level]{.underline}. In most of these countries the EPI score has
degraded during the last ten years. The variance is large where, for
example, China improved its score with 11.4 points, from a very low
level.

DISCUSSION

[Based on most]{.underline} of the previous [research and]{.underline}
the presented [data it seems like economic freedom is **positive** for
the environment]{.underline}. [It should not be expected that economic
freedom has the same effect on the environment in all cases and in all
countries at all points in time]{.underline}. [The effect]{.underline}
rather [depends on]{.underline} what **[developmental
stage]{.underline}** the country is at. During the last few centuries,
it has been observed that, [at an **early** stage of a country's
economic development]{.underline}, [a high level of environmental
degradation is common]{.underline} (Dergiades et al. 2016). [After a
certain point of economic development]{.underline}, [a **steady
decline** in environmental degradation starts]{.underline}.

[[Old]{.mark} empirical [results]{.mark} should also be [viewed with
**caution**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In the]{.underline}
19**[50s]{.underline}**, the [emerging economies]{.underline} of Europe,
then at the same GDP level as today's richer countries of Africa, [had
an abundance of coal and oil at their disposal at a low
price]{.underline}, [while solar and wind energy was nonexistent or a
novelty]{.underline}. [In **2020**]{.underline}, [renewable capacity
increased the most of all new production capacity globally]{.underline},
as more than 80 percent of all new electricity capacity added was
renewable, of which solar and wind accounted for 91 percent (IRENA
2021). [[A country that starts]{.mark} its [growth]{.mark} journey
[today has **other**]{.mark} **alternatives** to produce
[energy]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and goods are **not the same**]{.mark}
as 50 years ago]{.underline}.

Whether economic freedom is good or bad for the environment depends on
how it affects incentives, productive efforts, and effective resource
use. [Greater economic freedom can harm the environment]{.underline}
through the scale effect [as business and industries produce more goods
and more pollution]{.underline} as a result. [But]{.underline} there are
also many arguments as to why [economic freedom makes people **take
care** of the environment better]{.underline}. One way to think about
the relationship between [the [environment]{.mark}]{.underline} and the
economy [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} that of [[a]{.underline}]{.mark}
so-called **[[luxury]{.mark} good]{.underline}**, where [[demand
for]{.mark} a [better environment **rises**]{.mark} **quickly** [with
income]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Economic actors modify their behavior according to
changing]{.underline} institutional requirements but also the prevailing
**[norms]{.underline}**. Norms entice economic actors to adjust their
businesses to maintain legitimacy, and hence alter their behavior to fit
into society's expectations. Competition as a byproduct of increased
economic freedom relies on the [[consumers]{.underline}]{.mark} to
choose among products, and they [**increasingly [value]{.mark}**
[]{.mark}environment[-friendly products]{.mark}]{.underline} (Arrow et
al. 2004). [It is not surprising that countries with similar
environmental performance are **geographically close** to each
other]{.underline}, since pollution travels between borders through the
air and rivers, and large geographical areas can be affected. [Countries
close to each other]{.underline} presumably [have a dialogue about
emissions and might retaliate in different ways if they perceive that
someone is sending pollution in their direction]{.underline}. If
[[citizens can]{.underline}]{.mark} move between regions and countries
they can also [**[vote with their feet]{.mark}** and **leave**
environmentally challenged]{.underline} neighborhoods, cities, or
[countries]{.underline} (Hirschman 1970).

CONCLUSION

The purpose of this chapter was to scrutinize the relationship between
economic freedom and environmental performance. Whether economic freedom
is good or bad for the environment depends on how it affects incentives,
productive efforts, and effective resource use. Greater economic freedom
can both harm and help environmental performance. [It is a
**complicated** relationship]{.underline}, [but high economic freedom
**generally goes hand in hand** with high scores in the]{.underline}
**[E]{.underline}**nvironmental **[P]{.underline}**erformance
**[I]{.underline}**ndex.

[Economic freedom]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} the
[wealth]{.underline} that flows from it, [is **consistent**
with]{.underline}, [and **supportive** of]{.underline}, [a healthy
environment]{.underline}. [The environment usually benefits when a
larger percentage of land and property are **privately held** and
**protected**]{.underline} by a country's judicial system.
[Although]{.underline}, for example, [global carbon]{.underline} dioxide
[emissions have not decreased]{.underline},
**[g]{.underline}**reen**[h]{.underline}**ouse **[g]{.underline}**as
[[emissions]{.mark} [from developed economies]{.mark}]{.underline} such
as the EU and the US [have [fallen **despite** continued economic
growth]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Tech]{.mark}nological developments in
many economies [have contributed to]{.mark} a **sharp [decline]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark} the [prices]{.mark} of renewable energy
technology]{.underline}, [which has [improved]{.mark} the economic
[conditions for **rapidly reducing**]{.mark} carbon dioxide emissions
**[globally]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The research regarding the relationship between economic freedom and the
possible degeneration or improvement of the environment is still in its
infancy, and there are several avenues future research should take.
There is both a need for further probing into issues that have not so
far been addressed, such as discontinuities and non-linearities in the
relationship between economic freedom and the environment, and a need
for better methodology, especially taking causal inference seriously. At
present, it is hard to know whether economic freedom affects the
environment or if some of the findings reflect reverse causality. It
could also be that both variables change with economic development and
technological innovation. The latter issue points at the need for
moderation analysis -- how does economic freedom affect the environ-
ment through various channels, such as economic growth? These and other
issues should be addressed in new studies.

To end on a positive note, just over a decade ago, the first Tesla
rolled out in California around the same time as Steve Jobs presented
Apple's iPhone. The electric car was distrusted, but at the end of 2021,
more than every second new car sold in Sweden was electric or hybrid; in
Norway, the figure was 90 percent (Kane 2022; Mobility Sweden 2023).
[The question is]{.underline} not whether it will take another 12 years
before Sweden reaches Norway's level of electric cars, but [whether
within a **few decades** we will be able count the proportion of petrol
cars on **one** or **two hands**]{.underline}. [Green technological
change is happening **quickly**]{.underline}, [and to a **large extent**
it is driven by **rich** and **free economies**]{.underline}.

As Swedish author and lecturer Johan Norberg (2023a, pp. 110--111)
writes:

\[As\] low- and middle-income countries have grown faster than rich
countries [[during]{.mark} the era of [trade liberalization and]{.mark}
international [supply chains]{.mark}]{.underline}, [global [income
inequality]{.mark} has [decreased for the first time since the
**Industrial Revolution**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This is a **monumental
change**]{.underline}, [and it has been **dizzyingly
quick**]{.underline}. [Between 2000 and 2018 [the global **Gini
coefficient**]{.mark}]{.underline} (a measure of income inequality,
rated from 1 to 100) [[decreased]{.mark} from **seventy** [to **sixty**
points]{.mark}]{.underline}, thus [**[erasing]{.mark}** a [hundred-year
build-up of global inequality]{.mark} in **less than two
decades**]{.underline}.

Earlier, [trade [liberalization]{.mark}]{.underline} within the European
Economic Community (EEC) and the Organization for Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD) [[generated reductions in income
disparity]{.underline}]{.mark} among member countries. In contrast,
European [[countries that did **not**]{.mark} significantly [liberalize
trade exhibited **higher** income differentials]{.mark}]{.underline} and
little convergence (Ben-David, 1993). In recent decades,
[[globalization]{.mark} has also [led to]{.mark} a [**more equal**
distribution]{.mark} of well-being at the **global** level]{.underline},
with developing countries having experienced a catching-up process in
terms of human development (Jordá & Sarabia, 2014).Footnote 10

Global Poverty Reduction

According to Our World in Data, a Gates Foundation-funded nonprofit
website led by Oxford University economist Max Roser, [global extreme
[poverty has **declined dramatically**]{.mark}]{.underline} over the
last generation and more:

[There are more than a **billion** fewer people living below the
**International Poverty Line**]{.underline} of \$2.15 per day [today
than in 1990]{.underline}. On average, [the number declined by **47
million** every year]{.underline}, or 130,000 people each day. The scale
of global poverty today, however, remains vast. The latest global
estimates of extreme poverty are for 2019. In that year the World Bank
estimates that around 650 million people -- roughly one in twelve --
were living on less than \$2.15 a day. (Hasell et al., 2022)

For the 1800 years for which we have data, and long before, [global
[income levels **barely changed** until the Industrial
Revolution]{.mark} kick-[started **rapid**]{.mark} **economic
[growth]{.mark}**]{.underline}, halving British extreme poverty by 1850.
The economies of Western Europe and the United States grew later as they
opened their economies, followed by Scandinavia and Japan in the late
1800s. The extreme poverty rate measured as the share of humanity living
on \$1.90 a day or less (the World Bank's unacceptably low extreme
poverty threshold prior to 2022) fell from 94.4% in 1820 to 9.6% by
2015. Yet most of the Global South and East stagnated under
authoritarian and colonial rule. [Between 2000 and 2022]{.underline},
however, [**[extreme]{.mark} [poverty]{.mark}** [decreased
globally]{.mark} from **29.1%** [to **8**]{.mark}**.4[%]{.mark}** of the
world's population]{.underline}. [For the first time in
**history**]{.underline}, [fewer than **one in ten** people now live in
poverty despite a growing population]{.underline}. Even excluding China,
global poverty was reduced by almost two-thirds in this period. Poverty
in many developing regions today is lower than it was in Western Europe
in 1960 during the post-war economic boom. Only in sub-Saharan Africa is
poverty higher.

[Between 1990 and 2020]{.underline}, [**[child mortality]{.mark}**
[decreased]{.mark} from **9.3%** to **3.7%**]{.underline}, [and annual
child deaths fell [by]{.mark} almost **[7.5
million]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [**[Maternal mortality]{.mark}** also
[dropped]{.mark} **over [55%]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Average global
**[life expectancy]{.mark}** [increased]{.mark} from **64** [to]{.mark}
almost **[73]{.mark}** years]{.underline}. [Basic [**education** and
**literacy** rates **significantly increased**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[while [child labor]{.mark} has **[decreased]{.mark}**]{.underline}
(Norberg, 2023a, pp. 3--6; UNICEF, 2023; International Labor Office and
United Nations Children's Fund, 2021). The International Labor
Organization (2020, p. 34) has shown that [the share of [workers
in]{.mark}]{.underline} elementary and lesser-skilled jobs, a proxy for
[[**low incomes** and **poor**]{.mark} **working
[conditions]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [declined]{.underline}]{.mark}
[globally [by]{.mark} **over [10 percent]{.mark}age
points**]{.underline} from 1994 to 2019, with low-income countries
witnessing a 6 percentage point drop and upper-middle-income countries
(more integrated into the global economy) seeing a larger 20 percentage
point decline. Meanwhile, as Norberg (2023b) shows using ILO data, [the
number of **working poor** has **declined rapidly**]{.underline} between
1994 and 2022. [[The share of]{.mark} employed [persons living]{.mark}
in [extreme poverty]{.mark}]{.underline} (receiving an income below
\$1.90 adjusted for inflation and local purchasing power) [[declined
by]{.mark} **more than [three-quarters]{.mark}**]{.underline}, from
31.6% to 6.4%, that is, [a reduction of **over half a billion** people
despite pandemic setbacks]{.underline}. The share of workers in moderate
poverty (earning between \$1.90 and \$3.20) also declined, from over 21%
to around 12%. Extreme working poverty is strongly correlated with gross
domestic product per capita, being under 1% in upper-middle-income
countries by 2022. East Asia, the most globalized developing region, saw
an extreme poverty rate of just 0.5% in 2022. This was significantly
lower than the 38% rate for sub-Saharan Africa which has had
comparatively far less foreign investment and integration into global
supply chains.

[[Capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}, not socialism, [has been [the **most
effective**]{.mark} system [at reducing]{.mark} **global
[poverty]{.mark}** [and **hunger**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Countries
with higher]{.mark} levels of [economic freedom]{.mark} and market
capitalism tend to [have]{.mark} **significantly [higher]{.mark}** [per
capita GDP and **lower**]{.mark} **rates** of multidimensional
[poverty]{.mark}]{.underline}. Insofar [as they have shifted toward more
open trade policies]{.underline}, [**[Asia]{.mark}n**
countries]{.underline} like China, Taiwan, South Korea, and Vietnam
[have [seen some of the **fastest declines** in poverty]{.mark} in
recent decades]{.underline} (Zitelmann, 2023, pp. 11--27). [In
**India**]{.underline}, [[trade openness]{.mark} has helped [reduce
poverty among **almost all** social groups]{.mark}]{.underline}, and,
broadly, it has had limited or no impact on inequality at least in
comparison to other economic variables such as levels of technological
development (Bhagwati & Panagariya, 2012). As in Asia, where countries
that opened to the world market in recent decades registered huge
increases in living standards, [[**African** countries that]{.mark} have
liberalized and [reversed]{.mark} the **disastrous** policies
of]{.underline} "African **[[socialism]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
[[have]{.mark} had [the **greatest economic
success**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Guest, 2004; Ayittey, 2011; Robertson,
2012; Panagariya, 2019, pp. 312--315; Archibong et al., 2021).

[There is **[strong empirical evidence]{.mark}**]{.underline}, then,
[[that trade reduces poverty]{.underline}]{.mark}. [**Cross-country
regressions** show a negative relationship between trade openness and
poverty]{.underline}, and [**intra-country studies** also find that
trade reforms are associated with lower poverty]{.underline}. [Trade
[increases incomes and]{.mark} economic [growth]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[which]{.mark} in turn [reduces poverty]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
impact on inequality, however, is more mixed, with some studies finding
that trade increases wage inequality and others showing the opposite.
Overall, [while trade]{.underline} likely [contributes to]{.underline}
rising [inequality in **some** contexts]{.underline}, [other factors
appear to play a **larger role**]{.underline} (Mitra, 2016). Crucially,
it is important to emphasize that studies of China and India have shown
that the country with the greater rise in inequality, namely, China, has
grown faster and seen larger poverty reductions (Panagariya, 2019, pp.
145--160).

In the United States, [while]{.underline} international
[[trade]{.underline}]{.mark} has undoubtedly [caused **some**
dislocation of jobs and industries]{.underline}, [it]{.underline} has
greatly benefited the US economy and workforce. Free trade [has [allowed
access to **new**]{.mark} **[markets]{.mark}** that have
[helped]{.mark}]{.underline} American [[companies **grow** and **create
jobs**]{.underline}]{.mark}. US [exports have [supported higher-paying
jobs]{.mark}]{.underline} in manufacturing and services, [while [imports
provide **cheap**]{.mark}**er goods**]{.underline} ([especially
**[necessities]{.mark}**]{.underline}) [[that]{.mark}
**disproportionately [benefit]{.mark}** [lower]{.mark}- and
middle-[income consumers]{.mark}]{.underline}, thus
**[[raising]{.underline}]{.mark}** Americans' purchasing power and
**[living [standards]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Meanwhile, inward foreign
investment in the United States has lowered interest rates for
businesses and consumers while also creating jobs in American companies
and industry. Outward US investment has allowed American companies to
access customers abroad and earn higher returns that benefit the
domestic economy (Griswold, 2009).

[An **academic study** has examined the impact of trade liberalization
on poverty and income inequality]{.underline} in Sri Lanka [using a
**multicountry computable general equilibrium model**]{.underline}, with
two hypothetical trade liberalization strategies compared, namely, the
formation of a South Asian Free Trade Area and unilateral trade
liberalization. It found that while both policies would likely reduce
overall income inequality and poverty in Sri Lanka [[over]{.mark} the
**[long term]{.mark}**]{.underline}, unilateral [[trade]{.mark}
liberalization is likely to [deliver **greater reductions** in poverty
and]{.mark}]{.underline} inequality. Both policies [would lead to
**lower levels** of income [inequality]{.mark} among
different]{.underline} household groups in urban, rural, and estate
[sectors]{.underline} in Sri Lanka (Pereraa et al., 2014). In developing
countries more generally, [[multilateral trade]{.mark} liberalization
[has]{.mark} had a [**significant negative effect** on
poverty]{.mark}]{.underline}, [since it has spurred economic
growth]{.underline}, [[increased]{.underline}]{.mark} farmers'
[[incomes]{.underline}]{.mark}, [reduced trade costs]{.underline}, [and
dampened volatility in international goods prices]{.underline}, all of
which directly benefit the poor (Gnangnon, 2014).Footnote 11

### Impact---War---2AC

#### Capitalist economies and open markets cause [peace]{.underline}.

**Krieger and Meierrieks, 24**---Wilfried Guth Professor of
Constitutional Political Economy and Competition Policy at
Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg; Senior Researcher with the
Department for Migration, Integration and Transnationalization at the
WZB Berlin Social Science Center (Tim and Daniel, "Economic freedom,
peace, and violent conflict," *Handbook of Research on Economic
Freedom*, Chapter 24, pp. 359-361, dml)

How could economic freedom relate to violent conflict? More
specifically, how can economic freedom mitigate the emergence of
political violence? To answer these questions, one can [consider
conflict to be the outcome of **rational choices** by potential
participants of conflict and situations where the net gains from
violence **outweigh** the net benefits of non-violence]{.underline}.
That is, [conflict participants are expected to have **compared** the
benefits and costs of violence to the benefits and costs of non-violence
and concluded that a better outcome can be obtained through
violence]{.underline}. [On the benefit side of violence are the
**rents** that can be appropriated]{.underline}, [which must be weighed
against the **material costs** of employing violence and the **foregone
gains** from not using resources for non-violent productive
purposes]{.underline}. This rational-economic argument for the emergence
of violent conflict is mirrored in a standard bargaining framework, in
which conflicts can erupt and foreign military interventions can
increase the scope for peaceful bargaining solutions (e.g., Fearon 1995;
Rohner forthcoming). Here, [low opportunity costs]{.underline} of
conflict together with asymmetric information and commitment problems
[are **major threats** to peaceful bargaining solutions and could
ultimately induce **conflict**]{.underline} (e.g., Rohner forthcoming).
Within this framework, we expect [[econ]{.mark}omic
[freedom]{.mark}]{.underline} to reduce the risk of violent conflict if
it [affects the calculus of potential conflict participants in ways that
[**decrease** the attractiveness of **violence**]{.mark} and/or
**increase** the attractiveness of **non-violence**]{.underline}. In
detail, [there are **several pathways** from economic freedom to a
**reduced risk** for violent conflict]{.underline}.

First, economic freedom is associated with [the freedom to **trade
internationally** as well as the promotion of economic
exchange]{.underline} within a country (e.g., by removing regulations
that would complicate internal trade and exchange). Consequently,
economic freedom [creates]{.underline} economic
[**[interdependencies]{.mark}** between people and regions]{.underline}
(i.e., domestically) [as well as between countries]{.underline} (i.e.,
internationally). [These]{.underline} interdependencies, in turn, ought
to [[**disincentivize** conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}. For instance, in
a world of economic interdependencies, [economic **[bonds]{.mark}**
could be [destroyed in a war]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [making
peace and war a matter of cost-benefit calculus]{.underline}, [with the
destroyed bonds [constituting a **high cost**]{.mark} for any expected
utility-maximizing government]{.underline} (Schneider 2010). In a
similar vein, while economic freedom may allow for the substitution of
trading partners, potentially reducing bilateral interdependencies, thus
making conflict more likely (Martin et al. 2008), [multilateral economic
interdependencies within a globalized world]{.underline} (as facilitated
by economic freedom) [may lead economically invested **[third
parties]{.mark}** to [show]{.mark} their [**disapproval**]{.mark} of
bilateral conflict [by sending]{.mark} trade-based [signals of
resolve]{.mark}]{.underline} (Kinne 2014). [This holds not only for
**interstate** war but also for **internal** war]{.underline}, which
some trading partners may aim to stop through, for example,
interventions (Bussmann and Schneider 2007; Powell and Chacha 2016).

Second, [[economic]{.mark} [freedom]{.mark} is also [linked to
low]{.mark} levels of [taxation and **small
government**]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., measured as government
expenditure as a share of total GDP). [If potential participants of
conflict are motivated by a desire to capture rents]{.underline}, [a
smaller government constitutes [a **smaller prize**]{.mark} that would
have to be compared with the payoff from non-violence]{.underline}.
Consequently, for example, as shown in Kirk's (1983) model, [smaller
governments]{.underline} (as a consequence of eco- nomic freedom) [are
expected to see **less conflict** compared with larger
governments]{.underline} (where the prize of conflict is comparatively
larger).

Third, economic freedom may be conducive to economic growth and
development, e.g., as [[higher]{.mark} levels of [economic freedom
coincide with stronger **property rights**]{.mark}]{.underline};
[stronger property rights]{.underline}, in turn, [[incentivize
**innovation** and]{.underline}]{.mark} thus, ultimately,
**[[productivity]{.mark} gains]{.underline}** and economic development
(see de Haan and Sturm 2024 in this volume). Similarly, Vadlamannati and
de Soysa (2014) argue that [**sound legal [institutions]{.mark}** that
[safeguard **profits**]{.mark} create incentives [for investment
into]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}(**[civilian]{.underline}**)
[[production]{.underline}]{.mark}, [making this type of investment
[**more attractive** than]{.mark} investment into
**[warfare]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As a final example, [[economic
freedom]{.mark} may help to **[channel]{.mark}** the [struggle]{.mark}
caused [by **incompatible**]{.mark}]{.underline}
([economic]{.underline}) [[**goals** into]{.mark} a
**[competition]{.mark}** for [but not]{.mark} a **[conflict]{.mark}**
over]{.underline} mobile financial, physical or human
[capital]{.underline}; here, [economic exchange acts as a signaling and
communication device]{.underline} (O'Neal and Russett 1999; Gartzke et
al. 2001). Mobile capital, in turn, is an important input for economic
growth and development (e.g., Grossman and Helpman 1993). For instance,
Gartzke (2005, p. 32) discusses how economic freedom interacts with
international factor mobility:

Economic freedom means you can take \[your wealth\] with you. When
conditions get bad domesti- cally, capital can leave the country,
creating an economic, and thus political, drain on the society.
Obviously, governments do not want money to leave. To the degree that
sovereigns are unable to stop the flight of capital, however, they must
create conditions that favor the voluntary retention of money within
their borders.

By [fostering [economic success]{.mark}]{.underline}, higher levels of
economic freedom could thus [[make it **less likely**]{.mark} that
potentially [violent actors will]{.mark} have to [**engage in conflict**
to satisfy their greed]{.mark} for resources or accommodate their
economic grievances]{.underline}, [[given]{.mark} that [**more
resources** will be available]{.mark} to them [through the
**marketplace** in]{.mark} the process of economic
[development]{.mark}]{.underline}. The basic underlying assumption here
is that [the [probability of]{.mark} an internal and international
[war]{.mark} to occur [is a **decreasing function** of]{.mark} **per
capita [income]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g., Collier and Hoeffler 1998;
Schneider 2010).

Fourth, [[economic freedom]{.mark} may be [linked to other]{.mark}
**institutional [outcomes]{.mark}** that are [conducive to **non-violent
conflict resolution**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For instance, [a **sound
[rule of law]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} a **[crucial]{.mark}** element of
sound market institutions]{.underline}. At the same time, [an
**impartial** and **functioning judiciary** also [underpins democratic
development]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., Larkins 1996). Indeed, [economic
freedom and democracy]{.underline} are usually positively related (see
Choutagunta and Gutmann 2024 in this volume) and argued to [give
[rise]{.mark}]{.underline} -- in combination -- [[to]{.mark}
a]{.underline} ([capitalist and]{.underline}) [[democratic
**peace**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Russett 1993; Rummel 1997). What is
more, [economically free countries are [characterized by]{.mark} a
**[wide dispersion of power]{.mark}** because of market and political
competition]{.underline}. For instance, [this [may
**prevent**]{.mark}]{.underline} (small) [**[elites]{.mark}** [from
**abusing**]{.mark} their [power to start conflicts out of
**self-interest**]{.mark}]{.underline} and at the expense of not only
their enemies but also domestic non-elites.

Fifth[, [economic freedom may]{.underline}]{.mark} [also foster
**values** that are conducive to peace]{.underline}. Indeed, the idea of
doux commerce (voiced by Montesquieu and others) already emphasized the
'civilizing' potential of [economic exchange]{.underline} as such
exchange is argued to [[produce **gentleness**]{.underline},]{.mark}
[**honesty** and **understanding**]{.underline} during the
Enlightenment. In detail, [economic freedom may [promote **social
trust** and **tolerance**]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., Berggren and
Jordahl 2006; Berggren and Nilsson 2013). For instance, [large and free
markets]{.underline} (which are likely outcomes of high levels of
economic freedom) [facilitate **trust** in others because such trust
makes it more likely to engage in **voluntary transactions** and build
**long-lasting business relations**]{.underline}, especially when market
participants do not know each other (e.g., Platteau 2000).
[Trust]{.underline}, [tolerance and related values]{.underline}, in
turn, [[make it **less likely** that conflict breaks
out]{.underline}]{.mark}, e.g., because religious cleavages are less
likely to be influential (e.g., Weingast 1998).

### Impact---War---1AR

#### [STUDIES]{.underline}.

**Krieger and Meierrieks, 24**---Wilfried Guth Professor of
Constitutional Political Economy and Competition Policy at
Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg; Senior Researcher with the
Department for Migration, Integration and Transnationalization at the
WZB Berlin Social Science Center (Tim and Daniel, "Economic freedom,
peace, and violent conflict," *Handbook of Research on Economic
Freedom*, Chapter 24, pp. 362-363, dml)

A first set of **[studies]{.underline}** [consider]{.underline}s [the
effect of higher levels of economic freedom on the emergence of violent
conflict between two or more nation-states]{.underline}. For instance,
this type of conflict may take the form of a militarized interstate
dispute (i.e., the display of military force short of war by one state
explicitly directed towards another state) or a conflict that involves a
minimum level of battle deaths to qualify as a full-blown war (Anderton
and Carter 2011). [A [**number** of **empirical studies** provide
ev]{.mark}idence [in favor of]{.mark} a **[capitalist
peace]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [where sound [economic
institutions]{.mark}]{.underline} (i.e., high levels of economic
freedom) [[coincide with]{.mark} a [**reduced likelihood** of]{.mark}
militarized disputes and [wa]{.mark}rfare between
nation-states]{.underline} (e.g., Gartzke et al. 2001, Mousseau et al.
2003; Souva 2004; Mousseau 2005, 2009; Gartzke 2007; McDonald 2010). For
example, **[Gartzke]{.underline}** (2007) [[examine]{.mark}s a [**global
sample** of countries]{.mark} between 1950 and 1992]{.underline},
[[finding]{.mark} that [high levels of external openness **discourage
conflict**]{.mark} between states]{.underline}.

Consistent with our theoretical discussion above, [several
**[empiric]{.mark}al contribution[s]{.mark}** [highlight the
role]{.mark} **international [trade]{.mark}** plays in creating economic
interdependencies and wealth [that]{.mark} **[disincentivizes]{.mark}**
interstate [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., Hegre 2000; Gartzke and
Li 2003; Gelpi and Grieco 2008). International trade ought to be fueled
by high levels of economic freedom, e.g., by means of low tariffs and
low trade regulations. [Other voices emphasize the role **[sound]{.mark}
economic [institutions]{.mark}** may play in the development of
institutions and values that [promote
**equality**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [**tolerance** and **respect**
for]{.underline}]{.mark} [the rights of [others]{.mark}]{.underline}
(e.g., Mousseau 2009).

In sum, [many **empirical studies** [suggest]{.mark} that [there
is]{.mark} a **[capitalist peace]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [with countries
that are [economically free]{.mark} being [**less likely** to engage in
conflict]{.mark} with other countries]{.underline}. At the same time,
this finding points to one important aspect that is also the subject of
academic debate. How does economic liberalism (high levels of economic
freedom) interact with political liberalism (high levels of political
freedom) and how do both variables affect conflict (e.g., Schneider
2014)? In this contribution, we cannot discuss at length the nuances of
the literature on the capitalist peace vis-à-vis the democratic peace.
However, our reading of the capitalist peace literature highlights two
major points. First, [sound economic institutions appear to lead to
**less interstate conflict** independent of the effect of
democracy]{.underline} (e.g., Gartzke et al. 2001; Mousseau et al.
2003). Second, it is possible that [economic and political freedom
**reinforce** each other]{.underline}, [with both]{.underline} also
potentially [sharing a beneficial relationship with economic
development]{.underline}, [suggesting that [rich]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[economic]{.mark}ally and politically liberal [countries]{.mark} may
[see]{.mark} **especially [low levels]{.mark}** [of]{.mark}
international [conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., Mousseau 2005).

### Impact---AT: Gendered Cap Ks---2AC/1AR

#### Liberalist trade is [in-line]{.underline} with feminist goals.

**Palen 24** \[Marc-William; Historian at the University of Exeter;
"Free-Trade Feminism"; *Pax Economica: Left-Wing Visions of a Free Trade
World*; Chapter 4; EC\]

[Economic [cosmopolitan]{.mark} ranks were [swelled by]{.mark} numerous
early twentieth century **[feminist peace internationalists]{.mark}**
who [opposed]{.mark} continued **Western [colonialism]{.mark}**, from
the 'scramble for Africa', to the coercive prying open of Chinese
markets, to the US occupation of the Philippines]{.underline}. The
[feminist [fight for free trade, anti-imperialism]{.mark}, peace, and
social justice, from this economic ideological perspective, can be seen
as part of a [larger **grassroots struggle** to **overthrow the
illiberal imperial order**]{.mark}]{.underline}. They [[blamed the
**economic nationalist policies**]{.mark} of the imperial powers for
creating so many of the world's social injustices; [for fomenting
**imperial rivalry**]{.mark}; for [exacerbating]{.mark} **geopolitical
[tensions]{.mark}**; and, by the time of the First World War, for laying
the **economic foundations of global military conflict**.]{.underline}
Leading international [women's suffragists would accordingly establish a
variety of progressive international peace organizations promoting
women's empowerment, free trade, food security, and antiimperialism.
Their efforts would also **[engender]{.mark} right-wing
[opposition]{.mark}** [from **anti-feminist supporters of
protectionism**, **imperialism**, and
**militarism**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Broadly speaking, the [anti-imperial radicalism of the mostly
middle-class white women's suffrage movement remained [tempered by a
**racialized worldview**]{.mark} common at the turn of the
century]{.underline}. The suffragists' [racial blinkers were often to
constrain their anti-imperial vision and the racial inclusivity of their
organizations, for much of the early twentieth century.]{.underline}
Some even toed the imperial line, hoping that doing so would legitimate
the women's suffrage movement in the eyes of male political elites.
Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, for example, both at first
supported the turn-of-the-century US imperial project in the Philippines
on the racialized basis of the 'civilizing mission': for them 'universal
sisterhood' effectively meant 'Anglo-Saxon sisterhood'. [Leaders of
pro-suffrage organizations such as the International Council of Women,
the International Woman Suffrage Alliance]{.underline}, the Woman's
Christian Temperance Union, WILPF, and the Young Women's Christian
Association ([YWCA]{.underline}), in turn, [struggled internally with
[both]{.mark} the imperial question and **[racial
inclusivity]{.mark}**.42 Muddying the issue further is that it is not
always clear whether the common first-wave [feminist acquiescence in the
**racialized imperial order**]{.mark} demonstrated approval, or merely
an inability to conceive of a world that transcended it; for even
'imperial suffragists' such as Stanton and Anthony opposed empire when
it was shown to hinder the **expansion of women's
suffrage**.43]{.underline}

The Cobdenite left-wing of the transatlantic women's suffrage movement
stood out because its [subscribers tended to buck this racialized
pro-imperial trend. Feminist free traders numbered among the leaders of
both the early twentieth-century anti-imperialist and the civil rights
movements.]{.underline} In the United States, for example,
anti-imperialists Fanny Garrison Villard, Florence Kelley, Jane Addams,
and Ellen Winsor joined up with male Cobdenite antiimperialist
counterparts Oswald Garrison Villard, Clarence Darrow, Thomas Mott
Osborne, and Moorfield Storey to help create the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in 1909. British
free-trade feminists, including Kate and Richard Cobden's daughters,
[contemporaneously mobilized against Edwardian British **colonialism**
while also working on behalf of **aboriginal rights.**]{.underline}

The more [radical left-wing of the burgeoning women's peace movement at
the turn of the century was suffused with the Manchester liberal
doctrine]{.underline}. In 1898, German feminist Luise Zietz, head of the
Social Democratic Party (SPD)'s women's movement, argued for free trade
at the party conference in Stuttgart. Much like that of Florence Kelley
in the United States, Zietz's was a Marxist variant of Manchester
liberalism---the Marx-Manchester tradition discussed in the previous
chapter---that the SPD leadership would adhere to for years to come
because they believed that free trade would support German
democratization and the country's hungry working class, unite the
world's workers, and help curb geopolitical strife.44 Austrian peace
worker Baroness Bertha von Suttner, who in 1905 became the first woman
to be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, was a prominent advocate of women's
rights, free trade, and limiting national sovereignty to defend peace
and human rights. Upon arriving on US shores in 1904, she referred to
the officials who 'rummaged' through her belongings as 'the vandals of
the tariff'. And while attending the 1908 London free-trade congress,
she described it as being 'just like the peace congress', with 'peace
and good will' overseeing the proceedings.45 [Feminist free traders
across the English Channel were paying close attention. By the turn of
the century, the first [explicitly]{.mark} women's
**free-[trade-and-peace]{.mark} organization**, the Women's Co-operative
Guild (1883--1921), was looking to Zietz's SPD **for inspiration**
(Fig. 4.1).46]{.underline}

In turn-of-the-century Britain, Richard Cobden's friends and family
continued to [champion his liberal radical causes]{.underline} long
after his death in 1865. Within the Marx-Manchester tradition, Annie
Cobden invoked her father's memory in 1904, the centenary of his birth,
to argue for socialist land nationalization to strike the final blow to
Britain's 'feudal class', and penned the 1906 Independent Labour Party
pamphlet Richard Cobden and the Land of the People. She also landed
herself in jail that same year, thanks to her suffragette militancy;
upon her release, she went on a US lecture tour to fire up its suffrage
movement.47 Richard Cobden's great-niece Helena, orphaned at age eleven,
was brought into the progressive Cobden family fold. She attended her
first Cobden Club meeting in 1893 when she was twelve, accompanied by
her cousins Jane and Ellen. Alongside her anti-imperialist cousins, at
the age of twenty Helena also got involved in the pro-Boer South Africa
Conciliation Committee, and threw herself into the British women's
suffrage movement. Helena and her husband Francis Hirst, British
Cobdenite editor of the Economist from 1907 to 1916, worked in vain to
keep Britain from going to war with Germany in 1914. The two thereafter
oversaw the maintaining the Cobden family residence of Dunford House as
their [home base for carrying on the free-trade-and-peace
cause]{.underline}.48

Kate and Richard's daughter Jane Cobden was notable for her involvement
across the range of British women's suffrage, anti-imperialism,
abolitionism, aboriginal rights, and free trade. In 1879 she formed a
local free-trade club in Heyshot, not far from the family home in
Dunford. In 1883 she and Helen Priestman Bright Clark, daughter of her
father's ally John Bright, campaigned to include women's suffrage in the
parliamentary Reform Bill of that year. Jane then controversially ran as
a Progressive candidate for the London County Council in 1889. She and
her sisters Maggie and Nellie were outspoken in advocating for Irish
independence from the 1880s. Jane also took a lead role in opposing the
Second Boer War (1899--1902) as head of the women's department of the
Stop the War Committee, working alongside Emily Hobhouse and Josephine
Butler, daughter of prominent ACLL campaigner and antislavery activist
John Grey.49 Jane Cobden's uncompromising opposition to South African
segregationist policies got her ousted from the executive committee of
the Anti-Slavery and Aborigines' Protection Society in 1917. She also
assumed her father's free-trade anti-imperial mantle in her [opposition
to the imperial protectionist Tariff Reform movement]{.underline}
(1903--1913) (see chapter 1).50 Her publications, The Hungry Forties:
Life Under the Bread Tax (1904) and The Land Hunger: Life Under Monopoly
(1913), were in keeping with her father's radical cosmopolitan vision in
arguing for a free market to make food affordable and land accessible.51

Transcending the 'Cobden sisterhood', by the time of the First World War
Britain had become a hotbed of feminist commercial peace activism, as
more and more women's suffragists demanded free trade to further their
cause.52 Prominent among them were Emily M. Leaf, Catherine Marshall,
Eva Macnaghten, W. Gladys Rinder, Ethil Snowden, Mary Sheepshanks,
Helena M. Swanwick, and the leaders of the Women's Co-operative Guild.53
From 1919 the British Section of WILPF provided an even wider umbrella
[to unite the various wings of the British suffrage movement owing to
their shared [belief in the **pacifistic** and **emancipatory effects**
of **economic liberalism**]{.mark} on the world stage]{.underline}.54

Britain's turn-of-the-century confluence of women's suffragism with the
Liberal--Labour [politics of **economic cosmopolitanism,
anti-imperialism, and peace**, in turn, often found its reverse image
within the right-wing British antisuffrage movement]{.underline}. Women
'antis', as they were sometimes dubbed, were mostly from wealthy elite
families, and aligned themselves with Conservative policies of
protectionism and imperial consolidation.55 Australian-born Mrs. Humphry
Ward, a popular novelist and member of the prominent intellectual Arnold
family, was an early leader of the English anti-suffrage movement. An
opponent of Irish Home Rule, according to biographer John Sutherland she
also 'happily embraced Tariff Reform, and the quirky proimperialism that
was part of the package'.56 Another 'anti', Ethel Tawse Jollie, was
married to Rhodesia's first administrator, Archibald Ross Colquhoun, and
the two travelled the globe during their posting in Rhodesia, before
settling into London and Edwardian British imperial politics. Jollie
became a staunch defender of the 'natural order' of social and gender
inequalities, and fought for strengthening the British Empire through
emigration, imperial defence, imperial federation, and Tariff Reform.
She was also active in the National Service League, which advocated
compulsory military service; the Imperial Maritime League; the Women's
Unionist and Tariff Reform Association; and the Royal Colonial
Institute, where in 1914 she succeeded her husband as editor of its
journal, United Empire.57

### Impact---AT: Imperialism---2AC/1AR

#### Liberalist trade is [historically consistent]{.underline} with anti-imperialist endeavors. 

**Palen 24** \[Marc-William; Historian at the University of Exeter; "The
Anti-imperialism of Free Trade"; *Pax Economica: Left-Wing Visions of a
Free Trade World*; Chapter 2; EC\]

The exhibition's more liberal organizers well understood its [intimate
[association between]{.mark} **free [trade]{.mark}** [and
peace]{.mark}]{.underline}. For such left-leaning [liberals]{.underline}
(liberal radicals), the [festival of free trade tapped into a deep
wellspring of Enlightenment-era economic idea]{.underline}s that had
come to be known by this time as the Manchester School, or Manchester
liberalism.8 Jeffrey Auerbach concludes that 'of the ideological links
between the exhibition and the Manchester School there can be little
doubt'.9 Free trade was fast becoming a national ideology in Britain.10
And the Manchester School's staunchest left-leaning ideologues believed
that the market interdependence wrought from the worldwide adoption of
free trade would bring a panoply of riches: prosperity;
industrialization; the devolution of empires; the eradication of hunger
by expanding the global food supply and lowering food prices; and the
democratization of governments by undermining the political power of
militant mercantilist elites. For Manchester liberals, free trade thus
offered an intoxicating cure-all for an industrializing world plagued by
inefficient markets, aristocratic rule, mercantilist empires, food
insecurity, and geopolitical turmoil.

The Crystal Palace provided the ideal forum for tackling multiple
pressing left-wing issues at once. Pacifists unsuccessfully sought to
ban all weapons from the exhibits and made sure that the year's
international peace congress was held simultaneously down the road at
London's Exeter Hall. Abolitionists hoped to make the exhibition a
testament to the superiority of free-labour products. Karl Marx and
Friedrich Engels believed the Festival of Free Trade represented an
encouraging capitalist step forward in the progressive march towards
socialist revolution. Millenarian Christian evangelicals prayed that the
Temple of Peace might also provide a big tent for religious revivalism,
uniting all mankind in anticipation of Christ's imminent return.
Excepting socialist revolution, the exhibition's more [left-leaning
pro--free trade architects hoped to knit these strands together to
[create a more **peaceful** and]{.mark} **less [imperial]{.mark}
economic [cosmopolitan order]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As Richard
Cobden---the Liberal radical leader of the British free-trade movement
and one of the exhibition's organization committee members---promoted
it, the event would '[break down the barriers that have separated the
people of dif­ferent nations, and witness the **universal
republic'**]{.underline}.11

The hype heralding Hyde Park's mirrored edifice in 1851 reflected the
euphoria of the era's economic cosmopolitans, as well as the mounting
tensions between these and their economic nationalist counterparts.
Their conflict was not only over what constituted the proper path for
global economic development and integration, but also over the future
course of imperialism and war. Left-wing economic cosmopolitan idealists
represented an interdependent world order that promised peace,
prosperity, democracy, internationalism, and the devolution of empires.
[Economic nationalists instead stood for a realist view of geopolitics
wherein great power rivalry, militarism, trade wars, and colonialism
were considered necessary evils, and the Western imperial nation state
the pinnacle of civilization]{.underline}. As explored in the previous
chapter, by around 1870, the latter were winning the ideological war.
The former, finding themselves on the outside looking in, doubled down
on expanding their international grassroots organizing to counteract the
imperialism of economic nationalism. Until his death in 1865, Cobden,
the 'International Man' and 'Apostle of Free Trade', acted as the
economic peace movement's figurehead; hence the frequent use of the term
'Cobdenism' as a synonym for Manchester liberalism thereafter. Cobdenism
(and Cobden himself) called for a fundamental overhaul of foreign policy
that the wider economic peace movement would also [embrace: free trade
[coupled with **non-interventionism**]{.mark},
**[antiimperialism]{.mark}**, **disarmament**, **international
arbitration**, [and an **end to war loans**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Cobden's own opposition to formal and informal imperialism of all
stripes epitomized 'the anti-imperialism of free trade'.12 Thus from
within the belly of the British imperial beast grew a left-wing
free-trade tradition dedicated to making wars, poverty, aristocracy, and
empires obsolete.

The commercial peace movement spread from Britain to the European
continent and the United States in the years surrounding the 1851 Great
Exhibition.13 London hosted the era's first transatlantic peace
gathering in 1843, the General Peace Convention, at which a resolution
that free trade was 'one of the best securities for peace' stood out.14
That same year James Wilson founded the Economist, which became the
Manchester School's main journalistic mouthpiece amidst their shared
effort to overturn the Corn Laws, Britain's protective tariffs on
foreign grain. The 1843 peace convention and repeal of the Corn Laws in
1846 sparked a hunger for greater international organization, leading to
peace congresses in Brussels (1848), Paris (1849), Frankfurt (1850), and
London (1851). The onset of the Long Depression and the global
protectionist turn of the 1870s could all too easily overshadow how the
economic peace movement was making inroads ever further afield via the
era's tools of transport and communication: global steamship lines,
transcontinental railways, and transoceanic cables. These new
technologies may have facilitated the expansion and consolidation of
empires, but [they also [made the **pacifistic ideas** of **global
governance** and **imperial devolution** seem more feasibl]{.mark}e to
**liberal radical free traders**]{.underline}.15

The diffusion of Manchester liberalism [played an
[underappreciated]{.mark} role in making the period [between the
Franco--Prussian War]{.mark}]{.underline} (1870--1871) [[and the]{.mark}
outbreak of the [Great War]{.mark} the 'golden age' [of the **peace
movement**]{.mark} and **international organization**]{.underline}.16
According to Mark Mazower, '[Cobden's free trade movement was the
leading and unquestionably most [successful]{.mark} version of
**[radical internationalism]{.mark}** to emerge' by the mid-nineteenth
century]{.underline}.17 Over the next century, Cobdenism's popularity
[[led to the creation of]{.mark} numerous left-of centre [**grassroots
organizations** that embraced **economic cosmopolitanism**]{.mark} as a
**prerequisite for peace** and the **devolution of
empires**]{.underline}.18 London's Cobden Club, founded by Cobden's
friends in 1866 under the mantra 'Free trade, Peace, Goodwill among
Nations', [remained the unofficial headquarters of the economic peace
movement until the Great War, after which several more radical pressure
groups in New York, Boston, and Geneva would share the
burden]{.underline}. Meanwhile, from around 1910, financial backing from
some of the era's leading plutocrats-turned-philanthropists helped the
free-trade-and-peace movement stay afloat during the difficult years
between the First and Second world wars.

The [economic cosmopolitan [challenge to the **neomercantilist era's
imperialism** of **economic nationalism**]{.mark} also [gave birth to
sophisticated **modern liberal radical critiques of
imperialism**]{.mark}]{.underline}.19 The most influential came from a
panoply of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century Cobdenite
intellectuals--- prominent among them Herbert Spencer, Henry George,
Vilfredo Pareto, Frédéric Passy, Yves Guyot, J. A. Hobson, Henri
Lambert, and Norman Angell---[informing a more proactive and radical
generation of **economic peace workers**.]{.underline}20 The more
extreme economic nationalist turn that followed the First World War and
the 1929 Wall Street crash only hammered home the view that nations, [if
left to their own devices, would choose nationalism over
internationalism and [self-sufficiency]{.mark} over interdependence,
[perpetuating]{.mark} the **[militaristic cycle]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
This [realization [intensified]{.mark} the common **liberal [radical
belief]{.mark}** that only a [free-trading]{.mark} world community
regulated through **supranational governance** [could bring an end to
the economic nationalist causes of imperialism and war]{.mark}---thereby
paving a **peaceful** and **prosperous** path for global economic
development]{.underline}. The positions of Richard Cobden and other
mid-nineteenth-century liberal radical opponents of imperialism and war
would, in hindsight, appear rather modest when compared to the globalist
prescriptions being put forward by their pacifistic interwar
torchbearers. The latter would [oversee the creation of a more liberal
order]{.underline}---their long-sought Pax Economica---in the 1940s from
the wreckage of the Great Depression and the Second World War.

the preserve of public health scholars. From the climate crisis to
pandemics, [[the **underlying problem**]{.underline}]{.mark} is blamed
on the "unfairness" of neo-liberal policies, which generate inequalities
(within and between societies), resulting in continued poverty and
misery, authoritarianism, and environmental destruction. Many of the
arguments tread a well-worn path, but they [[beg]{.mark} **deeper
[scrutiny]{.mark}** and supporting **empirical evidence**]{.underline},
particularly since Labonté's main policy prescription for fighting
neo-liberal austerity seems to be degrowth, which is a euphemism for
"self-imposed austerity." In an age of fake news, where populistic
politicians everywhere offer simple solutions to complex problems, the
need of the hour is well-considered theory and empirical evidence for
guiding policy. This rejoinder, thus, will scrutinize some simple
stylized fact and assess the soundness of the broader arguments, relying
on the existing evidence in the specialized literature. There is much in
Labonté's article that is easy to agree with, and this author does not
disagree with the larger claim that many global economic and policy
processes are unfair to the poor, but what is questioned here is the
empirical basis for relying on degrowth as a solution to questions of
poverty, health, and fairness.

First, I examine the issue of how the rich and poor have performed in
the pre-pandemic world in terms of [healthy life expectancy]{.underline}
(**[[HALE]{.underline}]{.mark}**), which [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
perhaps [[the **best way** of evaluating]{.mark} population
[health]{.mark} because it assesses simultaneously how mortality and
morbidity trends have evolved]{.underline} over the last three decades
based on 369 known causes of mortality. [According to the
latest]{.underline} Global Burden of Disease [study]{.underline},
[[**all** regions of the world have seen **considerable
improvements**]{.mark} in HALE]{.underline}.2Figure 1 shows the regional
trends in HALE (all cause) for both sexes above the age of 20.

[**All** regions have increased health-adjusted life years on the
aggregate]{.underline}, and [**sub-Saharan Africa** shows the **steepest
gains** in the past two decades]{.underline}. Interestingly,
[[after]{.mark} decades of **so-called [neo-liberal
governance]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [**Latin America** and the **Middle
East** and **North Africa** have similar HALE scores as the **former
Soviet States**]{.underline}. [There is **little**]{.underline} in this
highly aggregated stylized view [to suggest]{.underline}, thus, [that
egalitarian governance structures are a **necessary condition** for
increasing healthy life and wellbeing]{.underline}. [It is **wealth**
created by good policy that allows both public and private
investment]{.underline} in health [to increase overall population
health]{.underline} standings. While public action is important for
achieving many health outcomes and human capital improvements, such as
in Singapore, [it is **[not at all clear]{.mark}** that much [could be
achieved without **growth**]{.mark}]{.underline} of incomes and myriads
private investment in health and education that happens when societies
experience growth. Fortunately, [countries such as [**China** and
**Vietnam** are following **neoliberal policies**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[and their life [improvements are **palpable**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Ultimately, levelling up the health gradient within poor countries is a
noble objective, but increasing average wealth and health standards of
the population at large is the surest path to achieving health equity.
Neither higher government spending, nor equality alone, achieves better
human health.3,4

Consistent with the specialized literature, [it is]{.underline} income
levels, or [wealth creation through **economic growth**]{.underline},
[that matter for **securing better life**]{.underline}, [not
necessarily]{.underline} the **[distribution]{.underline}** of wealth
per se.3,5,6 [There is]{.underline} by now [a **great deal** of
theoretical and empirical evidence suggesting that being open to global
**[markets]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [where societies are governed by
**capitalist institutions** and **policies**]{.underline}, [[increases
the demand for public goods]{.underline}]{.mark}, [such as health and
education [and drive **better outcomes**]{.mark}]{.underline}.7,8 At
least [one recent]{.underline}, [careful empirical [study]{.mark}
[shows]{.mark} **quite [unambiguously]{.mark}** that higher amounts
of]{.underline} foreign direct investment, and by extension [openness to
global [capital]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[is **strongly associated** with
higher HALE]{.underline}]{.mark} among the poorer countries, [even after
accounting for endogeneity]{.underline}.9 [[If]{.underline}]{.mark}
indeed such global [[capitalist forces]{.underline}]{.mark} as foreign
direct investment and trade [[associate]{.mark} strongly
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} country-level
[[inequality]{.underline}]{.mark}, and inequality reduces average
health, [we **[would not expect]{.mark}** to see [such
outcomes]{.mark}]{.underline}.10 In a footnote, Labonté acknowledges
that growth can generate better outcomes for the poor, suggesting that
the rich states should sacrifice their growth (degrowth) to allow higher
growth for the poor. This is a rather surprising idea given that
[interdependence]{.underline} of economies [is
**non-zero-sum**]{.underline}. [What the poor need are **more markets**
and **capital**]{.underline}, [which are linked intimately to
growth]{.underline} among the rich. [Today's global
slowdown]{.underline}, largely due to the slowdown of Chinese growth,
[is a sad but true reminder that [degrowth will mean **austerity by
design**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Labonté stresses "fairness," putting his faith in government
intervention for reducing inequality. Fairness, of course, is a rather
slippery concept, especially if one tries to measure it. Economists
usually use income or wealth inequality to measure fairness,
differentiating inequalities of outcome, which occurs for many reasons,
including natural causes (genes, for example) from inequalities of
opportunity (institutional, structural factors). Figure 2 shows the
trend in income inequality measured as the average Gini coefficient
between the rich and poor worlds based on after tax disposable income.11

As seen there, the sub-Saharan Africa and developing countries as a
group show higher inequality trends over the period of globalization
compared with the industrialized countries as a group. Notice, however,
that the developing countries show flatter, slightly downward trending
inequality levels over this period, while the industrialized countries
show a clear upward trend, albeit at a lower average Gini score.
Clearly, the era of globalization has affected redistribution adversely
mostly in the industrial world. However, this higher inequality is a
by-product of high economic growth. The West is rich and has the
financial and institutional wherewithal to reduce the worst harm
generated by rising inequality---the poor do not. I am certain that most
poor people living in places such as Cuba and North Korea would gladly
give up their "equality" for less self-imposed austerity.

[[Despite]{.mark} the upward trend in income [inequality among]{.mark}
the [rich countries]{.mark}]{.underline}, [it is precisely [among
them]{.mark} that the [**highest human** and **environmental health** is
found]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [one **widely recognized**
indicator]{.underline} used by global and local policy-makers,
[the]{.underline} **[E]{.underline}**nvironmental
**[P]{.underline}**erformance **[I]{.underline}**ndex, [suggests that
[being wealthy **correlates best** with]{.mark}]{.underline} local-level
[**[environmental outcomes]{.underline}**, [such as **clean air** and
**water** and the **protection of species**]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Clearly, [the rich can afford to make the right
adjustments]{.underline}.12 Again, [it is the level of wealth produced
by economic [growth]{.mark} that seems to achieve the **better
outcomes** for **humans** and the **planet**]{.underline}, not the
pursuit of equality for the sake of levelling gradients. Several
specialized [studies]{.underline} on this subject [show that greater
openness to global markets and capitalistic]{.underline} economic
[policies [produce **far better environmental
outcomes**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [particularly [when it comes to
**reducing emissions** and more efficient use of **natural
resources**]{.mark}]{.underline}.13 Regardless, [the [world's
poor]{.mark}]{.underline} are literally dying to get to that region of
the world where inequality is rising, but they [[care
about]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[absolute
improvements]{.underline}]{.mark}** to their lives and the greater hope
offered within wealthy societies [rather than]{.underline} the
**[relative deprivation]{.underline}** they will inevitably have to face
the minute they arrive there. [What would be **[most
fair]{.mark}**]{.underline} to these desperate people, thus, [[is
**better economic conditions**]{.underline}]{.mark} at home, given the
absolute lack of appetite for more open borders, particularly in the
more egalitarian societies in the West.

### Impact---AT: Root Cause Of War/Imperialism---2AC/1AR

#### "Root cause" is [reductionist]{.underline} and [empirically disproven]{.underline}.

**Cope, 25**---Visiting Researcher at Queen's University Belfast (Zak,
"Geopolitics and Anti-Capitalism: Global Power Dynamics and Left
Economics," *The Palgrave Handbook of Contemporary Geopolitics*, Chapter
55, pp. 1128-1129, dml)

Economics imperialism occurs where [economic [theories and
methods]{.mark} are [used to explain]{.mark} not just market-related
phenomena but a **far [wide]{.mark}r [range]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} social
[behaviours and events]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} and where
disciplines such as political science, sociology, and even psychology
come to be dominated by economics (Mäki, 2009). Orthodox Marxism is the
ne plus ultra of [this intellectual tendency to **[reduce]{.mark}** all
[social and political]{.mark} [affairs to]{.mark} mere **epiphenomenal
[reflections]{.mark}** [of underlying]{.mark} economic
[conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}.Footnote 4 Yet such a reductionist view
**[[does not hold up to historical scrutiny]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

For instance, transatlantic [[**slavery** was abolished
**despite**]{.mark} its [remaining **immensely
profitable**]{.mark}]{.underline}, showing the role of ideas (in this
case, a profoundly good one) as a motor force of history (Ferguson,
2002, p. 96). Likewise, [although **some** [wars]{.mark} are fought for
plainly economic objectives]{.underline}, [**many** if not
**[most]{.mark}** have been [fought for **political** and
**ideological** reasons]{.mark}]{.underline}. Renowned German American
jurist and political scientist Hans Morgenthau (1904--1980) provides
**[[several]{.underline}]{.mark}** examples of [[wars]{.mark} over the
last two centuries]{.underline} that [were [fought more for **political
dominance**]{.mark} than for purely economic gain]{.underline}
(Morgenthau, 1949, pp. 31--34). [The **historical pattern** shows that
[European governments]{.mark} typically [conceived imperialist
strategies and then summoned capitalists to support
them]{.mark}]{.underline}, [whereas [capitalists]{.mark} as a group
[were often **opposed** to]{.mark} foreign engagements that could lead
to [war]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The [middle]{.mark} classes [and business
circles]{.mark} generally have [**historically opposed** wars]{.mark}
with most businesspersons [believing]{.mark} that]{.underline} "**[[war
does not pay]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[and]{.mark} that war is
[**incompatible** with an industrial society]{.mark} that depends on
rational economic calculation]{.underline}.Footnote 5 Indeed,
[[capitalist countries]{.mark} have [shown a **marked preference**
against war]{.mark} being waged]{.underline} (Harrison, 2011).

### Sustainability---EKC=True---2AC/1AR

#### Growth [solves]{.underline} emissions and pollution---prefer [stochastic modeling]{.underline}.

**Naqvi, et al, 25**---Department of Economics, University of Wah
(Rehana, with Bandar Almohsen, Department of Mathematics, College of
Science, King Saud University, and Ayesha Sohail, School of Mathematics
and Statistics, University of Sydney, "Modeling the environmental
Kuznets Curve: A stochastic approach using economic and climate data,"
Journal of Environmental Management, Volume 373, January 2025, 123108,
dml)

As the country continues to develop, it reaches a turning point where
the negative impacts of pollution become more evident and pressing. At
this stage, the economy has grown to a level where the adverse effects
of environmental degradation cannot be ignored. [Increased [wealth and
development bring]{.mark} about a **greater [awareness]{.mark}** of
environmental issues among the population]{.underline}. [[People]{.mark}
begin to [**demand** cleaner air]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
[water]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}]{.mark} [a [healthier]{.mark}
living [environment]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is clear from Fig. 2, as
the economic growth continues to increases, [pollution]{.underline} also
increases and [reaches]{.underline} to [a **threshold point** and
then]{.underline} eventually [**decreases** as economic growth
increases]{.underline}. This statement is also clear from Fig. 3 that
due to continuity in economic growth, pollution rises and then
decreases, which is a proof of existence of inverted Environmental
Kuznets Curve hypothesis. At the initial stages of economic growth in
Pakistan, the focus is on rapid industrialization, infrastructure
development, and increasing GDP growth rate. This stage is associated
with a significant reliance on fossil fuels, such as coal, natural gas
and oil to operate transportation, industries and energy production. As
a result, the pollution increase significantly during this period.
[The]{.underline} results of **[stochastic model]{.underline}** show
that during the initial phase, for every 1000 USD increase in GDP per
capita, carbon emissions rise by 0.8 metric tons. This stage corresponds
to an aspect of the Environmental Kuznets Curve, which states that
future growth will be witnessed at higher GDP, especially in the early
periods. The dependence on fossil fuel based economies is presented in
this increase in pollution. This is further aggravated by the need for
renewable energy investment as well as the use of inefficient
technologies in the energy sector, which causes excessive carbon
emissions. The findings also reinforce the view that energy consumption
has remained a key factor in this escalating trend of energy related
emissions that could have been avoided had alternative sources been
utilized earlier. This result [is **quite similar** to]{.underline} the
results of Ang, 2007, Apergis and Payne, 2009 and Halicioglu (2009) for
their [studies on **France**]{.underline}, [**Central America** and
**Turkey**]{.underline} respectively.

[While the public pressure **increases** and people become **more
informed**]{.underline}, [the government begins to enact **stricter
environmental regulations**]{.underline}. This conclusion is in support
of the EKC hypothesis since it illustrates that [[a better environment
can be achieved]{.mark} through economic development [once a certain
level of income is reached]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Investments are made
in]{.mark} technologies that **reduce emissions**]{.underline}, [such as
[filters]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [scrubbers]{.underline},
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [more efficient [production
processes]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The **focus shifts** from]{.mark}
merely increasing [output to]{.mark} achieving sustainable growth that
minimizes [environmental impact]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the economy
grows, [[the **turning point** is]{.mark} reached at a [GDP per capita
of]{.mark} approximately **USD [4500]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This is a
**critical threshold**]{.underline} in the EKC [where pollution
decreases with increasing trend in economic growth]{.underline}. [The
model shows that]{.underline} once **[Pakistan]{.underline}** reaches
this level of GDP, it means that now it [has the]{.underline}
technological and financial [capability]{.underline} to invest in
cleaner technologies and implement stricter environmental regulations.
[This]{.underline} turning point further [points a **shift in
priorities**]{.underline}, [with the government and private sector
increasingly aiming at reducing carbon emissions through the adoption of
renewable energy sources]{.underline}, [such as solar and wind
power]{.underline}, [and other energy-efficient industrial
practices]{.underline}. The importance of the turning point is
highlighted by the fact that the shift towards greener technologies and
more stringent regulations does not happen immediately but is a gradual
process. The EKC hypothesis is supported by this finding, as it
demonstrates that economic growth eventually leads to improved
environmental quality once a certain income level is achieved. This
phase suggests that Pakistan's development path is in line with [other
emerging economies]{.underline} that [have undergone similar
transitions]{.underline} after reaching a critical GDP threshold.

[In the later stages of economic development]{.underline}, [the country
becomes **even more committed** to environmental
sustainability]{.underline}. Fig. 3, Fig. 4 illustrate that economic
[growth **continues**]{.underline}, [but with a **strong emphasis** on
green technologies and renewable energy sources]{.underline}. The
transition to renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydro power
becomes a key strategy for reducing carbon emissions.

During this stage, [the country implements comprehensive environmental
policies and invests in]{.underline} research and development of [new
technologies that enhance sustainability]{.underline}. [[The
**industrial** sector adopts cleaner production]{.mark} methods [and
energy-efficient]{.mark} [tech]{.mark}nologies]{.underline}. [[The
**service** sector]{.underline}]{.mark}, which generally has a lower
environmental footprint compared to manufacturing, also
[[expands]{.underline}]{.mark}, [contributing to]{.underline} economic
[growth **without** significant increases in pollution]{.underline}.
After reaching the turning point, the [results show a gradual decrease
in pollution levels]{.underline}. [[For every additional **1000
USD**]{.mark} [increase]{.mark} in GDP per capita]{.underline} beyond
the turning point, [[emissions decline by **0.3 metric
tons**]{.underline}]{.mark}. This shows that economic growth now leads
to improved environmental outcomes, mainly due to the incorporation of
cleaner technologies and the adoption of more sustainable practices.
This downfall in carbon emissions is [due to]{.underline} several
factors such as [improvement in energy efficient
**technologies**]{.underline}, [adopting international
**policies**]{.underline} for clean environment [and more investment in
energy efficient **sources**]{.underline}. This stage can be compared to
the factory that has now fully integrated clean technologies into its
operations. It continues to produce goods efficiently, but with
significantly reduced emissions. The emphasis is on maintaining economic
growth while protecting the environment. [[Sustainable practices are not
just an **afterthought** but an **integral part**]{.mark} of the
economic strategy]{.underline}.

The relationship between economic growth and carbon emissions is often
visualized as an inverted U-shaped curve, known as the Environmental
Kuznets Curve (EKC). This model suggests that as an economy grows,
environmental degradation first increases and then decreases after
reaching a certain level of income per capita, hence proving the
Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. [This study uses variables
such as **time**]{.underline} (in years), **[GDP]{.underline}** per
capita, [and]{.underline} carbon **[emissions]{.underline}** per capita.
**[[Stochastic]{.underline}]{.mark}** terms are explained through
**[[Wiener processes]{.underline}]{.mark}** to [[account for **random
fluctuations**]{.mark} in GDP [and]{.mark} carbon
emissions]{.underline}. The average growth rate is expected to lie in
between 1% and 5% annually, while the uncertainty in this growth ranges
from 0.5% to 2%, showing economic volatility. Baseline pollution levels
are set between 0.5 and 2 units, with pollution increasing by 0.1 to 1
units for every 1000 USD rise in GDP per capita. At the highest point of
GDP, pollution decreases by 0.05 to 0.2 units, indicating the existence
of the EKC hypothesis that economic growth initially leads to increased
pollution, but eventually results in lower emissions as GDP per capita
rises. Lastly, the uncertainty in pollution levels varies from 1% to
10%, reflecting the variability in environmental impact. This
comprehensive approach helps in understanding the dynamics between
economic development and environmental sustainability in Pakistan. The
EKC hypothesis postulates an inverted U-shaped relationship between the
level of environmental degradation and income growth. It means that in
initial stages of development, there is an inverse relationship between
pollution and GDP as the country has to develop without having concern
of environmental quality. then in later stages, pollution decreases
after reaching at threshold point, while economic development goes on.
Research by Dinda, 2004, Halicioglu, 2009, Luzzati and Orsini, 2009,
Acaravci and Ozturk, 2010 and Al-Mulali et al. (2015) proved the
observed relation among economic growth and environmental pollution
proposed by environmental Kuznets Curve and their studies show the
similar results and inverted U-shaped EKC with our study.

• Economic growth leads to increased pollution. During this phase, the
focus is on rapid industrialization and economic expansion, often at the
expense of environmental health.

• The peak of pollution is reached when the country achieves a level of
wealth that enables it to invest in cleaner technologies and enforce
stricter environmental regulations. Public awareness and demand for a
cleaner environment also drive these changes.

• Further economic growth results in reduced pollution due to the
adoption of green technologies and better environmental practices. The
economy becomes more sustainable, with growth decoupled from
environmental degradation.

The EKC hypothesis illustrates that [while]{.underline} economic [growth
can **initially** lead to environmental harm]{.underline}, [continued
development]{.underline}, [technological advancement]{.underline}, [and
increased environmental awareness can eventually lead to a **cleaner**
and **more sustainable** environment]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}
inverted U-shape curve [[provides a **hopeful outlook**]{.underline},
[suggesting]{.underline}]{.mark} [that economic [prosperity]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} environmental [sustainability are **not mutually
exclusive**]{.mark}]{.underline} but can be achieved through thoughtful
and strategic development policies.

4\. Discussion

The outcomes of this study provides a strong evidence of the presence of
the EKC hypothesis in the case of Pakistan. With the increasing trend in
economic growth, pollution initially rises, replicating the country's
dependence on fossil fuels. However, as GDP per capita reaches USD 4500,
carbon emissions begin to decline, demonstrating the effectiveness of
investments in cleaner technologies and stricter environmental policies.
This study highlights the need for Pakistan to focus on green
technologies and sustainable economic practices to achieve long-term
environmental sustainability. In a nutshell, our findings support the
Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis and [[the same pattern is
observed in]{.mark} other countries]{.underline}, Apergis and Payne
(2009) employed FMLOS on [6 countries in **[Central
America]{.mark}**]{.underline} for the period of 1971 to 2004. The
results [showed the]{.underline} presence of inverted U-shaped
[EKC]{.underline}. Similarly Zhang et al. (2017) conducted a [research
on **[ten newly industrialized nations]{.mark}**]{.underline} i.e
[Brazil]{.underline}, [China]{.underline}, [Indonesia]{.underline},
[India]{.underline}, [Mexico]{.underline}, [Malaysia]{.underline}, [the
Philippines]{.underline}, [Thailand]{.underline}, [Turkey]{.underline},
[and South Africa]{.underline}. from 1971 to 2013, the research also
[proved the]{.underline} existence of hypothetical inverted U-shaped
[EKC]{.underline}. [Another study]{.underline} conducted by Ang (2007)
showed an evidence of inverted U shaped EKC. This study [used quadratic
model specification on the data of **[France]{.mark}**]{.underline} from
1960 to 2000. Omisakin (2009) applied OLS technique on [the data of
**[Nigeria]{.mark}**]{.underline} over the time period of 1970 to 2005,
it also [showed the]{.underline} existence of inverted U shaped
[EKC]{.underline}. Hence proved that our findings are consistent with
the existing literature available on environmental Kuznets Curve.

[[With]{.underline}]{.mark} the help of [our mathematical
model]{.underline}, [where]{.underline} the two variables and their
[[stochastic equations]{.mark} with drift terms capture these dynamics
to a **great extent**]{.underline}, [[we gain **valuable
insights**]{.mark} into the relationship between economic growth and
carbon emissions]{.underline}. The drift term of type in the equation
for GDP per capita captures the average growth rate of the economy,
while the drift term of type in the equation for pollution level per
capita effectively represents the complex dynamics of increasing
emissions during early economic growth and the subsequent reduction in
emissions as cleaner technologies are adopted. These equations provide a
comprehensive framework to understand and predict how economic
activities impact environmental outcomes over time, aligning well with
the Environmental Kuznets Curve hypothesis.

2\. Literature Review

Increased [concerns about **environmental [sustainability]{.mark}** have
arisen due to]{.underline} the rise in greenhouse gas [**emissions**
and]{.underline} worsening **[environmental problems]{.underline}**
resulting from development. The relationship between economic growth,
environmental quality, and energy consumption has been extensively
studied, with the EKC being one prominent theory. However, conclusive
findings regarding this nexus remain elusive. Studies such as \[9-11\]
argued that environmental degradation is not a significant concern
during a country\'s economic development phase. On the other hand,
\[12\] suggested that C02 emissions, energy consumption, and economic
growth are interrelated, with a long-term equilibrium being reached
after approximately 11 years. Long-run analyses conducted by \[13\]
indicated that energy consumption and economic growth have a
statistically significant impact on environmental degradation.

Recent research has increasingly recognized the crucial role of energy
consumption as a determinant of environmental degradation, as
highlighted in \[14, 15\]. Energy consumption contributes to C02
emissions \[16\] and is a leading cause of environmental issues \[17\].
Similar findings regarding the long-term relationship between energy
consumption and economic growth have been observed by \[18-22\]. For
instance, \[21\] focused on leading emerging economies (South Korea,
Russia, India and China), while \[22\] examined data from 188 countries.

[Addressing the **challenge** of reducing energy consumption **per
capita** while maintaining **economic growth**]{.underline}, \[23\]
[suggested that technological **advancements**]{.underline},
particularly the adoption of energy-saving technologies, [offer
potential **solutions**]{.underline}. However, the mass adoption of
capital-driven production techniques in the industrial sector may lead
to increased C02 emissions \[24,25\].

[[Previous]{.mark} **empirical [studies]{.mark}** predominantly employed
**panel data regression** techniques but often **[overlook]{.mark}**ed
the **[c]{.mark}**ross-**[s]{.mark}**ection **[d]{.mark}**ependence
effect. Neglecting this effect can [lead to **inefficient**]{.mark} and
**inconsistent [estimates]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as discussed by
\[26\]. [Correlated effects among **regressors** can further contribute
to **[biased conclusions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Heterogeneous [models
investigating the **relationship** between energy and economic growth
are relatively **limited** compared to **other studies**]{.underline}.
For instance, \[27\] explored GDP and C02 emissions in middle-income
economies from 1980 to 2012, finding that energy consumption played a
crucial role in upper and lower-middle-income countries. \[28\],
covering the period from 1975 to 2015, examined eight developing
countries and discovered an inverted U-shaped relationship between
energy intensity and industrialization/urbanization. Additionally,
\[29\] investigated 20 OECD countries from 1870 to 2014 and identified a
link between environmental degradation and growth using various
estimators.

The [[STIRPAT]{.mark} model has been **widely used** in environmental
**studies** to analyse the **relationship** between human activities and
various **environmental issues**, including **pollution**]{.underline}.
The [[flexibility]{.underline}]{.mark} of the STIRPAT model [[is]{.mark}
one of its **[key advantage]{.mark}**s, as it [allows]{.mark} for the
incorporation, modification, and [breakdown of **various**]{.mark}
**influencing [factors]{.mark}** that are **relevant** to the
analysis]{.underline} \[30\]. Several past studies have employed the
STIRPAT model to investigate different aspects of pollution \[31-35\].
\[31\] analysed selected Asian countries and highlighted the potential
increase in C02 emissions due to carbonintensive activities and
industrialization. \[32,34\] extended the STIRPAT model in cross-country
analyses, with \[34\] exploring different fossil fuel sources and their
impact on the environment, while \[36\] identified a reduction in
emissions among 18 developed countries due to increased renewable energy
consumption and improved energy intensity. Furthermore, \[33\] studied
the relationship between population, GDP, and emissions in Taiwan,
finding that population growth had a positive effect on emissions while
GDP had a negative effect. \[35\] discussed the differential impacts of
population growth and economic growth on the environment based on a
sample of 84 countries. Conversely, \[36\] found that energy consumption
had a larger impact on environmental quality than economic growth and
urbanization in China, utilizing a spatial-temporal approach not
considered in previous STIRPAT literature. \[37\] investigated the
impact of various driving forces on C02 emissions in several prominent
ASEAN countries. The sample included Myanmar, Singapore, Malaysia,
Thailand, the Philippines and Indonesia and the data covered the period
from 1992 to 2016. The study employed panel data modelling techniques,
specifically fixed effect regression estimation, random effect
regression estimation, and pooled ordinary least squares (OLS)
estimation. The dependent variable in the study was C02 emissions, while
the independent variables among others are population, GDP, urban
population and C02 intensity. The study\'s findings indicated that GDP,
as a measure of affluence, and environmental patent count, as an
indicator of technology, were important driving factors of C02 emissions
in the ASEAN region.

Abbasi et al., \[38\] used an extended STIRPAT model to examine the
relationship between energy use, urbanization and carbon emissions in
Asian countries. The results of the FMOLS and DOLS methods confirm the
long-run direction among the variables. It is observed that energy
consumption and urbanization have a positive impact on C02 emissions and
economic output. Additionally, the study reveals that financial
development has a negative effect on C02 emissions but a positive effect
on economic growth. The Granger causality test suggests the existence of
long-run causal relationships among the variables. Considering the
interdependencies among countries, similar to our study, \[39\] employed
the AMG and CCEMG estimators within the STIRPAT framework.

3\. Data and Methodology

3.1 Theoretical Framework

The **[[IPAT]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Impact by Population Affluence and
Technology) [model]{.underline}, aimed to [[quantify]{.mark} the
**[environmental impact]{.mark}** of human-induced **economic
activity**]{.underline} \[40\]. This [model considered **three**
fundamental variables: **population**]{.underline} size (P),
**[affluence]{.underline}** (A), [and **tech**nology]{.underline} (T),
[which reflected the impact **per unit** of economic
activity]{.underline}.

= blPb2A b3Tb4e (1)

In this equation, I represents the environmental impact for a country i
at a time t. The variables P, A, T, and e represent to population size,
affluence, technology and error term, respectively. The coefficients bl,
b2, b3 and 134 quantify the influence of each variable on the
environmental impact.

However, [to **enhance** the model\'s ability for **rigorous hypothesis
testing**]{.underline}, \[41\] redefined it as the [STIRPAT
model]{.underline} by [[incorporat]{.underline}]{.mark}ing
[**[stochastic]{.mark}** element**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
[STIRPAT model **expanded** upon the IPAT framework by allowing for a
**more comprehensive analysis** of the relationships between population,
affluence, technology, and their effects on the
environment]{.underline}. It [[provide]{.mark}d a **[mathematical
structure]{.mark}** to assess the **environmental impact**, utilizing
**additional variables** and enhancing the model\'s **statistical
testing capabilities**]{.underline}. By taking natural logarithm on left
and right sides of IPAT model, the general form of the IPAT and STIRPAT
model is expressed as:

Llit Lb1 + LP b2 + LA b3 + Le (2)

The [**adoption** of the STIRPAT model facilitated more **robust**
hypothesis testing and allowed researchers to investigate the **complex
interactions** between population, affluence, technology and their
**implications** for the environment]{.underline}. By employing this
model, [scholars gained a **systematic** and **quantitative framework**
to analyze and comprehend the **environmental consequences** of human
activities]{.underline}. The STIRPAT [model has gained **significant
recognition** due to its capacity for **expansion** to incorporate
**additional factors**]{.underline}. As a result, [it has become a
**widely adopted technique** for investigating the **impact** of
pollutant]{.underline}. In a study conducted by \[42\], the STIRPAT
model was applied to examine the influence of urbanization on C02,
specifically in the case of Malaysia. Similarly, \[43\] employed the
STIRPAT model to explore the factors of C02 by conducting a study using
non-renewable and renewable energy consumption in OECD countries \[44\].

The [[EKC]{.underline}]{.mark} as shown in Figure 1 [[holds]{.mark}
**significant [relevance]{.mark}** when examining the **relationship**
between economic **variables** and **pollution**]{.underline}. Extensive
[discussions and debates have **revolved** around the concept of the
**EKC**, which suggests that countries should **prioritize** economic
growth as it is **closely linked** to C02 emissions in an **inverted
U-shaped curve**]{.underline}. This [implies that [as a
country]{.mark}]{.underline} initially [[experiences]{.mark} **economic
[growth]{.mark}**]{.underline}, there is a higher potential for an
increase in C02 emissions. However, as the country continues along this
trajectory, [with **advancements** in technology and industrial
competitiveness, [emissions]{.mark} gradually begin to
**[decline]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Consequently, [the [environmentally
**destructive effects**]{.mark} of economic growth eventually
**[diminish]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In the earlier stage of the EKC,
economic growth contributes to an expansion in the size of the economy,
leading to an increase in energy consumption that pollutes the
environment. However, in the second stage of the EKC, the effects of
technology and changes in the composition of economic growth come into
play, influencing the quantity and type of energy consumption. These
factors can have positive environmental effects, resulting in a decline
in pollution levels. The research conducted in \[45\] has been
instrumental in shaping the understanding of the EKC. Their findings
highlight the dynamic relationship between economic growth and
environmental impact. Furthermore, one of the [recent
studies]{.underline}, such as conducted in \[46\] have [further
contributed to the **discourse** surrounding the **EKC**, supporting the
idea that as economies **progress**, they can achieve a **decoupling**
of economic growth from environmental **degradation**]{.underline}.
Overall, the [EKC hypothesis underscores the **importance** of
considering the **long-term** environmental implications of **economic
development**]{.underline}.

3.2 Data Source and Description

[[In]{.mark} this [study]{.mark}]{.underline}, a [**balanced** panel
data set comprising **175 observations** is obtained]{.underline} from
the World Development Indicators for a period spanning from 1995 to
2019. The selected countries include Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia,
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam for which all the necessary
data are available. The driving forces for C02 emissions, I (metrics
tons per capita) considered are urban population, P (% of the total
population), gross domestic product, A (per capita, constant 2015 USD),
renewable energy consumption, T (% of total final energy consumption)
and an extended factor, trade openness (% of GDP). Meanwhile, GDP
squared is incorporated to test the EKC validity. Based on STIRPAT
model, the extended version of the model in the logarithm form (L) can
be written as:

LC02tt = + ß1LPOPit + ß2LGDPit + \[33LGDP 2 tt + \[34LREELt + ß5LTRDtt +
(3)

where C02 is carbon dioxide emissions, POP is urban population, GDP is
gross domestic products, REE is renewable energy, T RD is trade openness
and e is the error term. A finding that 0 and \< 0 would attest an EKC
exists.

3.3 Regression Model

The [analysis begins by conducting several **[statistical
tests]{.mark}** using STATA software to [examine]{.mark} the
**properties** of the [variables]{.mark}]{.underline}. The presence of
cross-section dependence ([CSD]{.underline}) [effect is **confirmed**
using **two different tests**]{.underline}. The [Lagrange
Multiplier]{.underline} (**[LM]{.underline}**) [test]{.underline},
developed by \[47\] and the **[Pesaran CD estimator]{.underline}**
developed by \[48\], all [confirm the **existence** of CSD]{.underline}.
After confirming the presence of CSD, the [**stationarity** of the
series is assessed using **second-generation** unit root
tests]{.underline} \[49\]. These tests account for the CSD effect when
examining stationarity. The [**null hypothesis** is formulated as **no
CSD** (correlation) in residuals]{.underline}, while [the **alternative
hypothesis** assumes **CSD**]{.underline} (correlation) [in
residuals]{.underline}. By utilizing the Pesaran CD test, we can
evaluate the stationarity properties of variables in panel datasets,
while accounting for potential cross-section dependence and
heterogeneity. This allows for a more robust analysis and accurate
modelling of the underlying data. To determine whether the variables are
integrated, \[50\] is employed. The all-panels option in the STATA
package is utilized to test the null hypothesis of no cointegration
against the alternative hypothesis of cointegration.

To analyse the relationship described in Eq. (3), heterogeneous
estimators, namely mean group (MG), augmented mean group (AMG), and
common correlated effect mean group (CCEMG) estimators, are employed.
The AMG and CCEMG estimators consider the cross-section dependence (CSD)
effect, while the MG estimator does not account for this effect. All
mean group type estimators follow a similar approach:

The MG estimator, developed by \[51\], allows for parameter
heterogeneity by separately estimating OLS regressions for each panel.
The [average of the coefficients is then **calculated** to estimate the
**mean parameters** across groups]{.underline}. This [estimator exhibits
**consistent performance** when the sample size and time-period
dimension are **sufficiently large**]{.underline}. The CCEMG estimator,
introduced by \[52\], is an extension of the MG estimator. Unlike the MG
estimator, the CCEMG estimator takes into account the CSD effect and
offers robustness against slope heterogeneity and endogeneity. Moreover,
the CCEMG estimator is robust to structural breaks, non-stationarity,
and noncointegration, even for smaller sample sizes. In the CCEMG
estimator, the average of the variables is calculated for the entire
panel, and each equation includes the average cross-section terms of
both y and x. The AMG estimator, originally introduced by \[53\] and
further developed by \[54\], is specifically designed to address both
CSD and slope heterogeneity. The AMG estimator incorporates a \"common
dynamic process\" variable. The AMG estimator is unbiased and remains
efficient regardless of the dimensions of the sample and time-period,
making it robust to changes in degrees of freedom.

4\. [Empirical Results]{.underline}

The [presence of the **[c]{.mark}**ross-**[s]{.mark}**ection
**[d]{.mark}**ependence]{.underline} (CSD) [effect [is
assessed]{.mark}]{.underline} through the utilization of CSD tests. The
[finding]{.underline} in Table 1 [indicates that the Breusch-Pagan LM
statistic **reject the null** hypothesis of no CSD effect in the ASEAN
countries]{.underline}. Breusch-Pagan LM is preferable as N\<T. These
[[results]{.mark} suggest the **existence** of the **CSD effect** in the
region]{.underline}. Due to the dependency observed, the
first-generation panel unit root test is deemed inappropriate for use.
Hence, we proceed with the second-generation panel unit root test to
account for cross-sectional unit dependence.

\[TABLE 1 OMITTED\]

The results of the panel unit-root test based on Pesaran\'s CIPS method
is presented in Table 2. After differencing, when no lag is considered,
the test statistics for all variables indicate that the null hypothesis
of a unit root in the series should be rejected. Thus, we can conclude
that the variables are integrated of order 1 or 1(1).

\[TABLE 2 OMITTED\]

Subsequently, as all variables are identified as 1(1), we proceed to
examine if there is cointegration among variables. Table 3 displays the
outcomes of the Westerlund (2005) cointegration test. The [result in the
table provides **evidence** to **reject the null** hypothesis of no
cointegration]{.underline}. Therefore, [we can **[conclude]{.mark}**
that [there is a **cointegrated relationship**]{.mark} among the
**panels**]{.underline}. Consequently, the application of heterogeneous
models is justified.

\[TABLE 3 OMITTED\]

Table 4 presents the estimation results from the heterogeneous models.
[The **coefficients** of the population, GDP, GDP square, renewable
energy and trade openness demonstrate **consistent signs** across all
three estimators, indicating the **direction** of their effects on
**environmental degradation**]{.underline}. Among the three estimators,
the CCEMG estimator exhibits the smallest Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
value of 0.0230, indicating the lowest forecast error and thus better
performance.

Focusing on the [results]{.underline} obtained using the CCEMG
estimator, it is observed that Mean LC02 (0.7558) [shows a **positive**
and **significant effect** on cross-section dependence]{.underline},
implying interdependence or similarity in the behaviour of emissions
across countries. Ignoring this effect can lead to biased and
inconsistent estimations. Regarding the main effect coefficients, trade
openness (LT RD) contributes to a significant impact on environmental
issues. The coefficient of LT RD suggests that a 1% increase in trade
leads to a 0.1049% decrease in C02 emissions. Trade openness facilitates
the transfer of technology and knowledge across borders. [[Advanced
economies]{.mark} often [invest in **r**]{.mark}esearch **[and
d]{.mark}**evelopment to [develop **cleaner**]{.mark} and more
**efficient [tech]{.mark}**nologies. [Through **trade**]{.mark}, these
[tech]{.mark}nologies [can be **transferred**]{.mark} to less developed
countries, [enabling them to]{.mark} adopt **cleaner production
methods** and **[reduce pollution]{.mark}**. For instance, the transfer
of renewable energy technologies can help countries **shift** from
fossil fuel-based energy production to cleaner and sustainable
alternatives]{.underline} \[55\]. Moreover, it is interesting to note
that the coefficients for LGDP and LGDPSQ are positive and negative,
respectively, [**[confirming]{.mark}** that an **[EKC exists]{.mark}**
among the **countries**]{.underline}.

Comparing the estimators, similar as found in \[56\], the MG estimator
(without considering the cross-section dependence effect) shows higher
RMSE compared to the estimators that consider the CSD effect (AMG and
CCEMG), further emphasizing the relevance of incorporating cross-section
dependence in the analysis.

\[TABLE 4 OMITTED\]

4\. Conclusion

This study aims to investigate the long-term factors that affect
pollution among ASEAN countries by considering interdependence and
verifying if the EKC exists. The finding from heterogeneous models
provides valuable insights into the relationship between various factors
and environmental degradation and cross-section dependence among
selected ASEAN countries. The results showed that an extended factor of
the STIRPAT model, trade openness has a significant and negative impact
on C02 emissions, indicating that increased trade can contribute to
reducing pollution levels. This suggests that international trade can
serve as a mechanism for the transfer of cleaner technologies and
practices, leading to improved environmental outcomes.

Additionally, [the presence of a **positive** and **significant**
cross-section dependence effect for **C02 emissions**]{.underline},
[suggests **interdependence**]{.underline} or similarity in the
behaviour of emissions across countries. [**[Ignoring]{.mark}** this
[effect]{.mark} may [lead to **biased**]{.mark} and **inconsistent
[estimations]{.mark}**, underscoring the **importance** of considering
**c**ross-**s**ection **d**ependence in future research]{.underline}.
The [study also highlights the **existence** of the **EKC
pattern**]{.underline}. This suggests that [as countries experience
**economic growth**]{.underline}, there is an initial increase in
**[environmental degradation]{.underline}**, followed by a [**decrease**
as they reach **higher levels** of development and implement more
**sustainable practices**]{.underline}.

[Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a key enabler of
sustainable development in the context of climate change.]{.underline}
AI [technologies possess the potential to optimize resource
allocation]{.underline}, enhance decision-making processes, and drive
efficiency across various sectors[, thus enabling a more sustainable and
climate-resilient future]{.underline} \[10\], \[50\], \[112\].

One area where [AI plays a crucial role]{.underline} is [in optimizing
energy systems and reducing greenhouse gas emissions]{.underline}
\[30\]. Machine learning algorithms can analyze energy consumption
patterns, identify inefficiencies, and recommend strategies for energy
optimization \[5\]. [By optimizing energy generation, distribution, and
consumption, AI can contribute to significant reductions in carbon
emissions]{.underline}. Additionally, AI-driven [algorithms can
facilitate the integration of renewable energy sources into existing
power grids \[]{.underline}60\], [ensuring a more reliable and efficient
transition to low-carbon energy systems]{.underline} \[1\], \[4\],
\[58\].

Furthermore, [AI aids in the development of intelligent transportation
systems]{.underline} that optimize traffic flow, reduce congestion, and
promote the use of low-emission vehicles \[2\], \[31\], \[54\]. Through
real-time data analysis and predictive modeling, AI can enhance
transportation planning and logistics, [leading to reduced fuel
consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. In the context of sustainable
agriculture, AI technologies can support precision farming
practices]{.underline}. By analyzing soil conditions, weather patterns,
and crop data, AI algorithms can optimize irrigation, fertilizer usage,
and pest control, thereby reducing water waste, chemical inputs, and
environmental impacts \[89\].

2.2. Climate change mitigation and adaptation

[AI contributes to both climate change mitigation and adaptation
efforts. In terms of mitigation, AI plays a critical role in enabling
renewable energy integration and forecasting]{.underline} \[14\],
\[15\], \[67\], \[87\], \[88\], \[91\]. [Machine learning algorithms can
analyze]{.underline} weather data, historical energy generation
patterns, and other [relevant factors to optimize the integration of
renewable sources such as solar and wind power into the
grid]{.underline} \[70\]. Accurate forecasting of renewable energy
generation helps balance supply and demand, [reducing the reliance on
fossil fuel-based energy generation]{.underline} \[45\], \[95\], \[96\].

Moreover, [AI can support climate modeling and prediction, providing
valuable insights into the impacts of climate change and guiding
mitigation strategies]{.underline} \[24\], \[27\]. Deep learning
techniques can analyze vast amounts of climate data to identify trends,
assess risks, and inform policymakers and stakeholders about potential
future scenarios. This enables proactive decision-making and the
development of effective adaptation strategies \[23\], \[52\]. In terms
of climate change adaptation, [AI technologies can assist in risk
assessment and disaster management. By analyzing historical data and
real-time information,]{.underline} AI algorithms can identify areas
prone to natural disasters such as floods, wildfires, or hurricanes.
This knowledge aids in early warning systems, evacuation planning, and
emergency response coordination, enhancing community resilience and
reducing the impacts of climate-related events \[67\], \[70\].

2.3. Net zero: concept and challenges

The concept of net zero refers to achieving a balance between the amount
of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere and the amount removed
or offset. It entails reducing emissions through various measures and
compensating for any remaining emissions through carbon removal or
offsetting initiatives. [Achieving net zero is crucial to limit global
warming and mitigate the impacts of climate change]{.underline} \[39\].
However, several challenges exist in the pursuit of net zero. One
challenge is the complexity of accurately measuring and tracking
emissions across various sectors. [AI can help address this challenge by
developing advanced monitoring systems that analyze data from multiple
sources, such as satellite imagery, sensors, and IoT]{.underline}
devices \[49\], \[106\]. AI algorithms can enable real-time emissions
tracking, ensuring transparency and accountability in emission reduction
efforts \[90\].

Another challenge is the availability and quality of data required for
effective AI-driven climate solutions. Data collection processes and
standards need to be established, and data sharing among stakeholders
must be encouraged to facilitate the development and training of AI
models \[53\]. Additionally, privacy concerns related to the collection
and utilization of personal data need to be addressed to ensure the
responsible and ethical use of AI in climate applications. Furthermore,
ensuring the fairness and impartiality of AI algorithms is essential.
Biases in data or algorithmic decision-making could perpetuate existing
inequalities or hinder progress toward achieving equitable and just
climate outcomes. Efforts must be made to mitigate bias in AI algorithms
and ensure fairness in their application \[72\], \[130\].

Energy consumption is another challenge associated with AI systems. [As
AI requires significant computational power]{.underline}, the energy
requirements of AI infrastructure and data centers can be substantial
\[43\]. [To address this challenge, efforts should focus on developing
energy-efficient AI hardware and optimizing algorithms to minimize
energy consumption without compromising performance.]{.underline} The
use of renewable energy sources to power AI systems can also contribute
to reducing their carbon footprint \[128\].

The scalability and replicability of AI-driven solutions are additional
challenges to consider. While many promising AI applications have been
developed, scaling them up to a global level and replicating their
success across different regions and contexts can be challenging
\[116\]. The availability of resources, expertise, and infrastructure
varies, requiring tailored approaches and capacity-building efforts to
ensure the widespread adoption of AI in achieving net-zero goals.
Ethical considerations also play a crucial role in the application of AI
for net zero. The potential unintended consequences of AI-driven
decisions, the impact on employment and socioeconomic factors, and the
need for transparency and accountability are important ethical
dimensions to be addressed \[101\]. It is crucial to involve diverse
stakeholders, including communities, policymakers, and experts, in the
design, implementation, and governance of AI systems to ensure that
their deployment aligns with societal values and goals.

In summary, the concept of achieving net zero requires addressing
several challenges. However, AI has the potential to be a powerful tool
in the fight against climate change. Through its application, [AI can
enable sustainable development, enhance climate change mitigation and
adaptation efforts, and contribute to the realization of a net-zero
emissions future]{.underline}. To maximize the benefits of AI in
addressing climate change, it is essential to address challenges related
to data availability and quality, energy consumption, bias and fairness,
scalability, and ethical considerations. By doing so, we can harness the
full potential of AI to accelerate the transition toward a sustainable
and climate-resilient future. 3. AI applications for net zero
Civilization has led to more energy generation across the world leading
to an increased generation of greenhouse gases. An energy conservation
method (ECM) is an official approach that is commonly used to lower the
energy consumption from sectors generating energy leading to the
emission of greenhouse gases. The energy conservation method is
digitized using modern sensor technology in the form of AI to enhance
human activities \[77\]. This approach helps to achieve a net zero
environment and to increase the efficiency, accuracy, and consistency of
the measurement and verification protocols for a sustainable
environment. \[Figure omitted\]

### Sustainability---AT: Arctic Governance Fails---2AC/1AR

**Development in the Arctic is [sustainable]{.underline} when guided by
[effective international governance]{.underline} and [goal-oriented
regulation]{.underline}.**

**Blaauw,** **13** - (Robert J. Blaauw. "Environmental Security in the
Arctic Ocean," NATO Science for Peace and Security Series, pg. 181-183.
Accessed: 7-20-2025)//ilake-mc

[[Effective **governance**]{.mark} [through]{.mark}
[Arctic]{.mark}-specific [international standards]{.mark} and adapted
national regulations and standards is [critical in]{.mark} managing and
[**mitigating risks** and **securing**]{.mark} **safe**]{.underline},
[reliable and **[environmentally responsible]{.mark}**
[development]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Decades of experience]{.mark} have
[shown that it is]{.mark} [possible to achieve]{.mark}
**[well-defined]{.mark} and [effective governance]{.mark}** [systems for
oil and gas operations]{.mark} in the Arctic]{.underline}. These systems
encourage the selection of those [upstream operators]{.underline} who
are [best able to deploy and often improve the most effective and
reliable technologies]{.underline} [-- in full compliance with
environmental regulations and guidelines]{.underline}. As we know, the
[Arctic]{.underline} is a unique environment in terms of its physical
charac teristics (extreme cold, ice, darkness, seasonal windows) and
social characteristics (indigenous people, many who still follow a full
or partial subsistence lifestyle). It [is]{.underline} also
[characterized by strong connections both physical]{.underline} (e.g.,
Arctic Ocean), [political]{.underline} (e.g., Arctic Council, global
NGOs), [and relationships among indigenous people]{.underline}.
[These]{.underline} shared characteristics and [connections]{.underline}
[are such that standards between regions must be carefully managed or
harmonized so as to not undermine our commitment to protect people and
the environment]{.underline}, avoid any pretence of being seen as
employing double standards, and create a level playing field for all. We
believe that [[Industry]{.underline} [must cooperate on]{.underline}
**[standards]{.underline}**]{.mark}, which will need to be based on the
specific local conditions, scope of the oil & gas operation, legal
requirements and rigorous risk assessment and may therefore not be the
same for all Arctic regions ("[one size does not fit all]{.underline}").
The Macondo incident likely will lead to new regulatory frameworks and
legislation in many parts of the world. [This is an opportunity to show
lasting, thoughtful leadership in this important area going
forward]{.underline}. [We encourage regulators to work together with
industry, to create a common set of goals and a timeline for new
regulations]{.underline}. It is our experience that [[**goal oriented
regulation** leads to significant and sustainable]{.mark} [performance
improvement]{.mark}]{.underline}. Continued engagement and cooperation
with various national and state regulatory authorities is hence required
to promote strong and stable policies, relevant standards on the basis
of a thorough risk assessments and a stable fiscal regime needed for an
investment climate that encourages long term development of oil and gas
projects. The Policy should be very clear: minimize the impact on the
environment, and as such, follow industry best practices and adhere to
all regulatory and legal requirements. 17.8 Economic Growth In addition
to its important contribution to world energy supplies, oil and gas
developments can also provide other clear benefits to the people of the
Arctic region -- most importantly economic growth and stability. Take
Greenland, for example: Prime Minister Kuupik Kleist (2010) stated in an
interview with a Canadian newspaper \[ 7 \] that oil and gas
developments will give the people of Greenland more muscle to reach full
financial independence from Denmark If a huge amount of oil should be
exploited, there are some basic developments that will be possible in
terms of developing our democracy, in terms of developing our
infrastructure; also in terms of making the Greenland people stand on
their own feet, both politically and economically... [Oil and gas
activities are major contributors to regional and national economies.
They are drivers of social and economic change -- with revenues from
taxes and royalties boosting the economy, new high-quality employment
opportunities and its potential to stimulate local and national
businesses]{.underline}. Shell is a supporter of a portion of this
revenue stream being shared directly with local communities. [It is
often stated that sustainable development and oil and gas do not go
together but for countries, which plan accordingly, [public]{.mark}
[revenues can form the basis for]{.mark} **major and [lasting
improvements]{.mark}** [in public services]{.mark}, such as
infrastructure and standard of living]{.underline}. In addition the [oil
and gas industry provides the opportunity to develop a strong local
industry, competing internationally, as a basis for further industrial
development]{.underline}. [Norway is a good example]{.underline} --
where [oil and gas revenues]{.underline} and spin-off industries [are
providing a lasting benefit to the nation as a whole]{.underline}. 17.9
Job Creation The arrival of a large number of foreign workers can affect
social and cultural balances in small communities. By involving the
people of the Arctic in oil and gas activities one can harness bene fi
ts while providing ways to anticipate and mitigate negative impacts. If
vocational training and capacity building is introduced early, and
operators honour their commitment to ensure local content and
employment, long-term, high-value jobs can be created. On Sakhalin
Island in the far-eastern Russia unemployment plummeted with the
development of Sakhalin II, reducing it from approximately 20% in 1999,
to only 1% in 2009. In Shell's operations in Alaska, indigenous-owned
businesses are heav ily involved in oil fi eld and other support
services. Economic activity resulting from outer continental shelf (OCS)
development in the Beaufort Sea and Chukchi Sea could generate an annual
average of 54,700 jobs nationwide, with an estimated cumulative payroll
amounting to \$145 billion (in 2010\$) over the next 50 years \[ 5 \] .
It is estimated that about 30,100 jobs would be generated from the
Beaufort OCS development and 24,600 jobs from development of the Chukchi
Sea OCS. 17.10 Conclusion Some of the non-technical risks we are facing
in the Arctic are not ones Shell can or should solve or manage alone.
[Working with others is therefore an integral part of what we
do]{.underline}. We partner up with NGOs, academia and experts, Arctic
government representatives and industry bodies not only to address
concerns about our operations, but to engage on wider environmental and
social issues. [[Given]{.mark} all of the [development pressures on the
Arctic]{.mark} from transportation to mineral resource development, [we
need to]{.mark} collaboratively [develop regulatory frameworks]{.mark}
that provide more certainty for all stakeholders]{.underline}. [A
litigious approach of "we versus them" will only result in unnecessary
delays in establishing frameworks that allow for multiple uses,
including protecting the way of life and the environment in the
Arctic]{.underline}. Lets take a look at what has happened in the Alaska
Offshore continental shelf.- is this the way to approach Arctic
development globally?. Things need to change. After 7 years and over \$4
billion in investment there were still no exploratory wells drilled.
Delays in permits to drill, ambiguous requirements and standards which
made the operating environment unpredictable proved an enormous
challenge for us as a Company. [Focussing on working together for the
good of the sustainable development of the region rather than developing
strategies for the courtroom is the way forward]{.underline}. Shell is
committed to develop a common understanding of what must be done so we
can help create frameworks that governments can readily adopt, and which
provide both industry and communities the certainty they deserve.
[Working in the Arctic is "Difficult yes, Impossible no". Yes, there are
challenges, but the rewards are also great.]{.underline}

15.3 Results from Empirical Evidence and Reviews

Recent literature argues that [there is little or **no evidence** in
terms of **absolute decoupling**]{.underline} [looking into embodied
energy in **trade**, material **consumption**, **resource** use, and
**emissions**]{.underline}.

Akizu-Gardoki et al. (2018) devise an alternative "[Decoupling Index"
that uses **126 countries'** total primary energy
footprints]{.underline} (rather than total primary energy supplies),
[taking into account embodied energy **imported** with goods and
services]{.underline}. [Within a 14-year period of analysis]{.underline}
(2000--2014), [the authors empirically show that **93
countries**]{.underline}7 [**disprove** decoupling]{.underline}; while
27 show absolute decoupling for the analysis period, with only 6
countries (ESP, ITA, HUN, GBR, JPN, and FRA) with a Human Development
Index of 0.8 above maintain absolute decoupling over time (ibid.).

Regarding global material flows covering over half a century of analysis
(1950--2010) Schaffartzik et al. (2014) reveal that although industrial
metabolic profiles stabilise over time with equal shares of [biomass,
fossil energy, and construction minerals]{.underline}; they [are
**surpassed** by other regions like **Asia**, replicating patterns of
industrial growth engines]{.underline}. However, [this does not
translate into \"per capita\" affluence or material consumption and
instead adds to the **growing bubble** of global resource use and
**extraction**]{.underline} (ibid.). On a similar note, after an
[analysis of 40 years of resource productivity]{.underline} analysis
Krausmann et al. (2017) [summarise that although some countries may be
decoupling]{.underline} in absolute terms, [this value is **cancelled
out** when **trade** is taken into account]{.underline}. Wood et al.
(2018) confirm that [**impacts** embodied in trade]{.underline},
especially regarding material goods, led by clothing and footwear, [are
**growing tremendously**, with **energy** and **GHG** emissions
**following** in a less pronounced manner]{.underline}. Wu et al. (2018)
highlight the differences in a decoupling index, where "[**developed**
countries" primarily continue to develop **high**-**tech** and
**high**-**efficiency** GDP growth drivers, whereas "**developing**
countries" have **not** undergone a **transformation** to absolute
decoupling due to a **lack** in **energy efficiency** measures,
**disorganised industrial** structures, and **absence** of]{.underline}
Information Technologies (**[IT]{.underline}**) [in capital
investment]{.underline}. These studies highlight a threefold causality:
(1) [we have **lengthened** commodity **supply chains** due
to]{.underline} the abundance of readily available transport fuel; (2)
this has been made possible by [notably shifting and **outsourcing**
more significant impacts to **developing regions** that take on primary
**extractive** and **secondary industries**]{.underline}; (3) meanwhile,
[we have bought into the promise of circularity regarding the reuse of
materials]{.underline}. Hass et al. (2015) illustrate that [circularity
is low mainly because most materials are not available for recycling in
the first place and that the **growth** of **materials injection** into
our systems **outpaces** any potential **recycling**
attempt]{.underline} (See Sect. 15.4 for more details).

Similarly, recently conducted reviews of empirical research conclude no
robust evidence regarding decoupling. (For an exhaustive literature
review of decoupling literature, see Parrique et al., 2019; Koirala et
al., 2011; Mardani et al., 2019 among others). The Decoupling Debunked
document (Parrique et al., 2019) concludes that [there is **no
indication** of **decoupling** that is **absolute**, **global**,
**permanent**, and suff**iciently fast** and **large enough** both in
terms of resources or impacts]{.underline}. Likewise, [a review of 179
decoupling articles]{.underline} (Vadén et al., 2020) that appeared
between 1990 and 2019 [concluded with **no evidence** of economy-wide,
national/international absolute resource decoupling and reckons that
"the goal of decoupling **rests** partly on **faith**]{.underline}." A
recent exhaustive review, composed of a bibliometric mapping of 835
peer-reviewed articles (published in two parts, part I (Wiedenhofer et
al., 2020) and part II (Haberl et al., 2020)) also highlight the need
for substantial advances in both theoretical and empirical research
required while also being complemented by alternative goals and
ambitions.

With unsuccessful robust and systemic evidence, reaffirming the findings
of Hickel and Kallis (2020), [absolute decoupling from resource use
**cannot** be achieved on a **global scale** against a global scale
**backdrop** of **continued** economic **growth**]{.underline}.

In terms of accounting for emissions decoupling, a recent study by the
Breakthrough Institute (Hausfather, 2021) highlights that [32 countries
have managed to demonstrate economic growth while CO2 emissions
declined]{.underline} since 2005, even when accounting for emissions
embodied in the goods consumed in a country. [However]{.underline}, they
note with caution that [these economies are already
**wealthy**-**service driven** economies and that **very few examples**
are present from **low**- or **middle**-**income** countries based on
**extractive industries** and energy-intensive **manufacturing** to
date]{.underline}. While this study can present a departure narrative of
consumption-based emissions and absolute decoupling as we switch to
clearer technologies, [we must not forget that extraction and resource
dependence remain **intact** on the **supply side**]{.underline} --
s[upplies and sinks being the **two sides** of the **same coin** of the
**decoupling phenomena**]{.underline}.

15.4 The "Not-So-Circular" Economy and Rebound Effects

The industrial economy is not as circular as claims make it be; but
rather is entropic (Georgescu-Roegen, 1971) with [the depletion of low
entropy materials from the environment, resulting in an accumulation of
high entropy wastes and exotic materials in the environment]{.underline}
(Daly, 1992; Kerschner, 2010). This, also highlighted in a review of
decoupling literature by Wiedenhofer et al. (2020), is frequently
disregarded in decoupling studies, where the phenomena itself is usually
approached from a statistical/econometric viewpoint, often overlooking
thermodynamic principles of energy and materials and their core role and
function in defining societal metabolisms.

As Haas et al. (2015) show, on a global metabolism, [**only 6%** of all
processed materials are **recycled**]{.underline}, [against the
**backdrop** of global material consumption increasing by **3.6%** in a
**decade**]{.underline} (Schaffartzik et al., 2014). These numbers only
slightly improve for the European Union amidst convincing circular
economy narratives (Haas et al., 2015). [Over half of the total solid
material throughput in economies]{.underline} (52% or 3.5 GT/year)
(Giampietro & Funtowicz, 2020) [is composed of either food or energy
inputs that are subject to **entropic decay**]{.underline} (especially
in terms of energy quality). Only when biomass is included among the
recycled solid flows, total circularity only increases to 37% (Haas et
al., 2015). The remaining 45% of materials that are used form the
backbones of social systems, becoming infrastructure and construction
and "immovables" of societies; while only a minute percent of material
flow, 3% or 0.7 GT/year, is associated with consumable and durable
products (Giampietro & Funtowicz, 2020). Moreover, [all of these
**social structures** and metabolisms come at the **expense** of
**ecosystem services** at our disposal]{.underline} (Costanza et al.,
2017), [with **water** throughput often **ignored** in stabilising
**socio**-**ecological systems**]{.underline} (Giampietro & Funtowicz,
2020).

The [**COVID**-**19**]{.underline} pandemic and confinement period [has
also been an occasion to observe **decoupling** and
**rebounds**]{.underline} (Alcott, 2005; Polimeni, 2012) within
societies adjusting to a dramatic, involuntary downscaling of
socio-economic activities due to global lockdowns. In April 2020, in
comparison to 2019 values, daily global CO2 emissions had decreased by
around 17% (Le Quéré et al., 2020). [Values exhibited in the **peak
low** of emissions during COVID-19 were equal to those]{.underline}
corresponding to 2006 values -- [14 years ago]{.underline} (Canadell et
al., 2020). However, [several months **after**, studies detected a
**rapid rebound**]{.underline} (Harvey, 2020), [and in 2021 global
energy-related **CO2 emissions** are projected to **grow** once again by
**4.8%**]{.underline} (IEA, 2021). It is often argued that [decoupling
is bound by temporal features such that decoupling is usually followed
by periods of no decoupling or even recoupling]{.underline}, [making it
a challenge for becoming a permanent and continuous matter]{.underline}
(Vadén et al., 2020; Williamson, 2021). [The notion of rebound is also
captured where in some instances, the very act of solving environmental
problems in itself spends resources and may even create additional
problems that were previously unthinkable]{.underline} (Allen et al.,
2003).

15.5 Discussion and Conclusions

Most [**empirical lit**erature and **reviews** illustrate]{.underline}
little to [**no evidence** of resource or impact **decoupling** in
absolute terms that is **extensive** and **effective enough** to be
accepted as given]{.underline}. Moreover, when externalities are to some
degree accounted for, [decoupling attempts are cancelled out by the
**impacts** and **consequences** of **trade** or the exertion of
built-in **power asymmetries** and **extractive frontiers** prolonging
the **North**-**South divide** and socio-environmental **inequalities**
in terms of benefits and burdens]{.underline} -- primary research loci
of the Ecological Economics and Political Ecology disciplines.

### Sustainability---AT: Resource Curse---2AC/1AR

**Extractive industries in the Arctic can avoid the "resource curse"
through [benefit-sharing]{.underline} and [stewardship]{.underline}.**

Accessed: 7-20-2025)//ilake-mc

[[Despite past problems]{.mark} with resource development]{.underline},
[[there is a great hope that the **paradox can be resolved**]{.mark} and
that [extractive industries can]{.mark} actually [assist]{.mark}
communities and [regions to become sustainable]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[There exists cases where]{.mark} the [resource curse has not affected
regions]{.mark}]{.underline} (Acemoglu et al., 2003; Davis and Tilton,
2005). A consensus has emerged among [the resource curse]{.underline}
researchers that the curse [[can be avoided]{.underline} [with the right
institutions]{.underline}]{.mark} (R. M. Auty, 2007; Boschini, 2013;
Pegg, 2006). "[[Localist]{.underline}" [researchers]{.underline}]{.mark}
[are detecting new sub-national, national, and international power
structures emerging that [enable communities]{.mark} [to **better
control**]{.mark} **aspects of resource
[development]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Bebbington et al., 2008; Caulfield,
2004; O'Faircheallaigh and Ali, 2008). [Even industry is realizing that
efficiency of production now requires externalities such as
environmental damage and socio economic problems be
controlled]{.underline} (ICMM, 2006).

While there is an increased belief that, properly managed, extractive
industries can actually contribute to sustainability, there is still no
coordinated effort by researchers on how exactly to do this. How can
resource extraction be best used to create successful societies? What
are the best ways to avoid the staples trap/resource curse? How can
resource extraction best contribute to the well-being of producing
regions and communities? What institutions best ensure that producing
regions and communities benefit from resource extraction? Because Canada
is a country that has been largely built on, and continues to be
dependent on, extractive industries, these questions are important for
this country. At the same time, these are complex questions that
represent a challenge of global importance. Finding answers to these
questions is the reason behind the formation of the ReSDA project.
Funded from 2011 to 2018 by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research
Council of Canada as a Major Collaborative Research Initiative, the
project is a partnership of Arctic communities and over 50 researchers
from 29 institutions and all eight circumpolar nations. [As the Arctic
is increasingly the site of extractive industry interest, the ReSDA
network is looking for ways to increase the benefits of extractive
industry developments to communities and to mitigate negative
impacts]{.underline}. This is an opportune time to undertake this
endeavour. New commodity pressures, the current state of the resource
curse debate, the search for new global standards, a seemingly more
concerned industry, increasing Indigenous control of decision-making in
the region, and the fact that various levels of government in the Arctic
are looking for new answers means that [[there is currently]{.mark} a
[great]{.mark} opportunity for [progress on this
question]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Researchers are starting to find answers
to many aspects of the central questions]{.underline}. What is
surprising is that this is being done largely in isolation from one
another. There is little comparative work. While the resource curse
literature has had a significant impact on international research
discourses, other findings are limited to much more localized
discussions. Many researchers are more focused on responding to the
immediate needs of communities they are working with and, as a result,
are isolated from the larger research discussions. This book is a first
attempt to try and tie together the research that is being done around
extractive resource development and the sustainability of Arctic
communities and region.

1\. Introduction

In a recent article in this journal **[Warlenius]{.underline}** (2023)
[takes **issue** with the emerging literature on
**degrowth**]{.underline} (Jackson, 2009, Jackson, 2017, Jackson, 2021a;
Kallis, 2018; Hickel, 2020; Hickel et al., 2022) [and declares instead
his **preference** for a '**growth-based**, **forceful** and **fast
transition'** towards a net **zero carbon economy**]{.underline}. His
case is based on three main components:

a\) An exploration of the relationship between economic growth rates and
rates of 'decoupling';

b\) A claim that degrowth scholars espouse certain maximum feasible
rates of decoupling; and

c\) A contention that decoupling is likely to be faster under growth
than under degrowth.

[This Commentary **responds** to these arguments]{.underline}. We show
first how an analysis of the relationship between growth rates and
decoupling rates can indeed provide a powerful lens through which to
arbitrate competing claims about possible futures. [Counter to
Warlenius\' claims, however, this analysis **does not
imply**]{.underline} that postgrowth scholars endorse economic collapse.
Nor does it prove that [**decoupling** is **best achieved** through
**growth**]{.underline} -- [an assertion which is relatively **common**
among proponents of 'green growth' but for which there is **limited
evidence**]{.underline}. [Counter to this claim, we identify several
reasons why a **postgrowth**]{.underline} (growth-critical) position may
be [**more likely** to achieve sufficient levels of **absolute
decoupling** than a **growth**-**at**-**all** **costs**
approach]{.underline}.

2\. The postgrowth case

Before setting out the details of our argument, it is worth clarifying
briefly the 'postgrowth case': that is the advantages that postgrowth
scholarship can bring to ecological economics -- and specifically to the
challenge of making a just transition to a net zero carbon economy.

The principal object of scrutiny for postgrowth scholars is the physical
scale of the economy, measured in terms of the material and energy
throughput of economic activity. This focus on physical scale has been
central to ecological economics since the pioneering work of Herman Daly
(1973). Degrowth is therefore most often defined as 'a planned reduction
of energy and resource use' in advanced economies (Hickel, 2020, Hickel
et al., 2022). It does not seek to reduce GDP as an objective. Nor does
it treat GDP decline as a climate mitigation lever. Nonetheless,
postgrowth scholars typically do accept that, as a result of the
structural and social changes needed to meet climate targets, continual
GDP growth may not be possible.

Consequently, a core component of postgrowth scholarship is concerned
with understanding the stability and resilience of economic systems when
positive growth rates cannot be taken for granted. As Jackson (2019a)
has pointed out in this journal, growth rates have been declining
already for some decades, particularly in the advanced economies, and
some countries are already effectively operating in a postgrowth
environment. Learning to live in this new reality -- to enable human
societies to thrive within planetary boundaries with or without economic
growth -- is going to be imperative. Postgrowth scholarship contributes
to this task.

At its simplest, the postgrowth case is very straightforward. Loosening
the assumption of growth-at-all-costs offers more degrees of freedom in
solving the problem of living within planetary boundaries. Alongside
technological efficiency and structural change as means of reducing the
carbon intensity of economic output (let\'s call this economic
decoupling), postgrowth scholars add the possibility of reducing the
economic intensity of human wellbeing (let\'s call this social
decoupling). A great deal of postgrowth scholarship is dedicated to the
broader question of social decoupling (Jackson, 2009, Jackson, 2017;
Hickel, 2020, Jackson, 2021a, Kallis, 2018).1 Most of the rest of this
paper -- like the article to which it responds -- is concerned with
economic decoupling defined as reducing the carbon intensity of economic
output.

3\. The unforgiving arithmetic of growth

In his Prosperity without Growth, Jackson, 2009, Jackson, 2017 set out
to understand what rates of economic decoupling would be needed in a
world committed to achieving its climate goals. His analysis used the
following formula (based in its turn on the well-known IPAT relationship
(Erlich and Holdren, 1971):

\[Formulas Omitted\]

By defining three out of the four terms in formula \[1\] at the end of a
target period, it is straightforward to deduce the reduction in carbon
intensity required by that date and from there to use an inverse algebra
to identify the annual decoupling rate required to meet the goal on that
timescale.2

In one scenario, for example, Jackson (2017, pp. 98--100) adopted the
population projections of the United Nations, imposed a carbon cap
equivalent to a 95% reduction in global emissions by 2050 to define,
assumed per capita income growth of 2% per annum in high income
countries (in accordance with conventional expectations of income growth
at that time) to project the GDP in 2050 and imposed in addition the
requirement that income levels across the world converge to the same
level as high-income countries by 2050, in order to satisfy a
requirement for social justice. Under those assumptions, he showed that
the carbon intensity of the economy would need to be more than 200 times
lower in 2050 than it was in 2015, equivalent to a decoupling rate of
between 14% and 15% year on year for 35 years, more than an order of
magnitude higher than the average rate of decoupling in the preceding 35
years.

Numerous [similar analyses have been carried out under differing
assumptions]{.underline} by Jackson, 2009, Jackson, 2017, Jackson,
2019b, Jackson, 2021b and others (Victor, 2008/2019, Victor, 2012,
Victor, 2023; Parrique et al., 2019). Vogel and Hickel (2023) find that
the [11 high-income countries that achieved absolute decoupling during
the period 2013--2019]{.underline} (after the financial crisis and
before the pandemic) [would require a **10-fold increase** in the rate
of decoupling during that period to remain within their fair shares of
the carbon budget for a **50% chance** of staying **under
1.5C**]{.underline}. [In short, much **higher decoupling rates** are
**needed** than have hitherto been achieved]{.underline}.

[Warlenius does not dispute the underlying argument]{.underline}.
[Rather, his results]{.underline} (op cit, Table 1) [provide a **limited
form** of '**sensitivity analysis'** around Jackson\'s original
calculations]{.underline}, [by allowing **growth rates** to **vary**
alongside decoupling rates]{.underline}.3 This analysis could usefully
have been taken further. For instance, our Fig. 1 shows the relationship
between 'allowable' growth rates and 'required' decoupling rates under
different carbon targets.

\[Image Omitted\]

This Figure can be interpreted in two related ways. On the one hand, for
each line (each carbon target) on the graph and for any given rate of
decoupling (shown on the x-axis) the y-value along the line shows the
maximum allowable annual growth rate over the period, *if that
particular target is to be met*. On the other hand, for any anticipated
growth rate shown on the y-axis, the x-value along each line indicates
the annual decoupling rate required for that target to be met.

So, for example, [to achieve a carbon target of 95% reduction by
2050]{.underline} (as defined by the green line in Fig. 1), [decoupling
rates must be above 10.5% for any positive growth rate to be allowable
over the period]{.underline}. The green shaded triangle on the upper
right of the Figure is thus the only regime on the diagram which can be
said to represent 'green growth' under the 95% by 2050 target. [At
global growth rates of **3%**, typical of conventional economic
forecasts ]{.underline}(IMF, 2023 eg), [the required **decoupling rate**
would need to be **above 13.5%**]{.underline}. [A more **stringent
target**]{.underline} (as shown for example by the (lowest) purple line
in Fig. 1), [would require annual decoupling rates in **excess** of
**16.5%** before a positive '**green growth**' rate could be
**achievable**]{.underline}.

4. Are there limits to decoupling?

The same analysis allows us to interrogate what might be needed to meet
any given carbon target if desired decoupling rates are *not* achieved.
For instance, [let\'s suppose that annual decoupling rates of only 7%
were achievable during the period between now and 2050. Then, unless the
economy contracted by **3%** annually over that period, the carbon
target would not be met]{.underline}. [The cumulative impact of such a
contraction]{.underline} (Fig. 2) [would mean that by 2050 the GDP would
be **65% smaller** than at the **beginning** of the
**period**]{.underline}. [If decoupling rates were limited to only 4%
then]{.underline} the economic contraction would be even greater. [GDP
in 2050 would be **85% smaller**]{.underline} than at the start.

\[Image Omitted\]

The two Figures provide a graphic illustration of what Jackson (2009)
has called the '[**dilemma** of **growth'**: on the one hand,
**continual** economic **expansion** is **unsustainable**; on the other,
**economic collapse** is likely to be **unstable**]{.underline}.
Nonetheless, analyses of this kind are useful. What they make clear is
that [**any binding carbon target** sets up a **non**-**negotiable**
relationship between the desired size of the economy and its consequent
need for decoupling]{.underline} -- or equivalently between the
potential for economic decoupling and the allowable size of the economy.
[The **bigger** the **economy**]{.underline} (as measured by its GDP),
[the **faster** the **decoupling rate** needs to be]{.underline}; [the
**slower** the potential **decoupling rate**, the **smaller** the
allowable size of the **economy**]{.underline} -- [if the carbon target
is to be met]{.underline}.

Ecological economists and postgrowth scholars have been pointing to this
punishing arithmetic for at least 15 years (Latouche, 2007; Victor,
2008/2019, Victor, 2012; Jackson, 2009, Jackson, 2017, Jackson, 2021a,
Parrique et al., 2019, Hickel and Kallis, 2020, Vogel and Hickel, 2023)
and probably much longer. Ecological economics itself was founded at
least partly on concerns for economic scale in the face of finite
planetary boundaries (Costanza, 1989; Daly, 1990). The broad lines of
the argument have been known for more than half a century (Meadows et
al., 1972, Daly, 1973).

It is important to note, however, that this arithmetic does not, in
itself, say very much at all about the limits to decoupling. Nor can it
be taken as an endorsement for any particular rate of economic growth --
or degrowth. Most postgrowth scholars readily accept the need for high
levels of decoupling. None that we know of suppose there are clearly
definable limits to decoupling. Nor do they propose or endorse massive
economic contractions, counter to the claim made in the Warlenius paper.
But it may be useful to explore that claim in more detail.

Specifically, [Warlenius contends that Hickel and Kallis set a '4%
decoupling limit' in their 2020 paper]{.underline} Is Green Growth
Possible? [Jackson]{.underline} (2009) [is supposed to have dismissed a
decoupling rate of 7% as 'incredible']{.underline} in his book
Prosperity without Growth. As shown in Fig. 2, such limits would imply
that carbon targets could only be met by economic contractions of the
order of 85% and 65% (respectively). On this basis, degrowth is accused
of a 'decoupling pessimism' that is 'mystifying' the climate transition.

[As it turns out, **neither** of these **specific accusations** is
correct]{.underline}. [**Hickel** and **Kallis**]{.underline} (2020)
[**nowhere** identify a **maximum limit** to decoupling]{.underline}.
[They mention the figure of 4% only as the global rate of decoupling
used in a certain set of optimistic growth-oriented modelling scenarios
developed by others]{.underline}. The point of their analysis is purely
to compare this assumption with the much higher rates of decoupling
required to limit warming to 1.5 °C or 2 °C, if global economic growth
continues at projected rates.

Counter to Warlenius\' accusation, [Hickel and Kallis conclude by
arguing that it is '**empirically feasible** to achieve green growth
within a carbon budget for 2 °C]{.underline} \[ie broadly consistent
with the 80% by 2050 target in Fig. 1\]... [if the \[global\] growth
rate is very close to **zero** and if mitigation starts
**immediately'**]{.underline}. [They make absolutely **no endorsement**
of -- and nowhere imply -- **massive contractions** in
**GDP**]{.underline} of the kind Warlenius claims they do.

The [case against Jackson is also **tenuous**]{.underline}. [The 7%
number refers to the level of decoupling required in Jackson\'s
**baseline** scenario]{.underline} (Jackson, 2009, p80) and represents
the annual decoupling rate required to achieve an 80% reduction in
carbon dioxide emissions by 2050 if growth rates in income and
population in various regions of the world followed historical patterns
(at the time). Having established this baseline, Jackson (2009: 81--2;
2017 98--101) then explored two additional scenarios designed to achieve
something like global equity in living standards. In one of these, the
GDP per capita of the developed nations was held constant while the
developing nations 'caught up'. In another, he included the possibility
of growth in the developed nations, at a level consistent with
mainstream economic assumptions at the time.4

[Nowhere does Jackson describe even these much higher decoupling rates
as 'incredible']{.underline}. [On the contrary, he argues that 'the
technological opportunities are legion' and 'the potential for change is
massive']{.underline}. [The critical point]{.underline} (Jackson, 2017,
p102, emphasis added) [is 'not whether the complete decarbonisation of
our energy systems is **technically feasible**, but whether it is
**possible** in our kind of **society'**]{.underline}. If there are
limits to decoupling, in other words, they lie at least partly in the
structure of our existing economic system.

[Warlenius\' charge seems to be drawn from]{.underline} a point later in
the book where Jackson argues [that there is in the literature 'no
credible, socially just, ecologically sustainable scenario of
continually growing incomes for a world of 9 billion
people']{.underline} (Jackson, 2009, p 86; see also Jackson, 2017, p
102) [a **conclusion** that is **still justifiable** more than a decade
after it was first drawn]{.underline}. [But the use of the word
'**credible'** in this context clearly **doesn\'t** imply that **7%
decoupling** rates]{.underline} (or indeed the much higher rates
required Jackson\'s other scenarios) are 'incredible'.

Errors in scholarship aside, what Warlenius appears to be criticising is
the increasingly popular position of 'environmental collapsism' which
does indeed argue that technological transformation is 'too little, too
late' and that only economic collapse can save the planet (Alvarez,
2022, eg). It may be a tempting position in the face of unreasonable
economic allegiance to the doctrine of economic growth. But it is
specifically not the position of the postgrowth authors Warlenius
attacks and in our view is likely to lead to immense human suffering. It
is precisely this belief which motivates our work on postgrowth
economics.

5\. Beyond growth and collapse

There is a curious point in Warlenius\' paper where, having carried out
the IPAT analysis and corroborated the harsh arithmetic of growth, he
appears to recant on the value of the analysis entirely, arguing that
'the static relations between growth and environmental impacts that is
suggested by... the IPAT equation seems fraudulent'.

It is an odd claim since \[1\] is neither a model nor even, strictly
speaking, an equation. Rather, it is what mathematicians call an
'identity'. The term on the left-hand side of \[1\] is formally
equivalent to the term on the right-hand side. This is easily seen by
cancelling out the population term

which appears both on the top and on the bottom of the right-hand side
of \[1\] and using the definition in \[2\]. What remains is:

\[Formula Omitted\]

Two things follow from this. On the one hand, the formula has nothing at
all to say about the causal relationship between growth rates and the
potential for decoupling. On the other hand, its logical power cannot be
held in dispute, either by growth advocates or by degrowth advocates. It
is a tautology, held true by definition. That is, moreover, precisely
what makes it useful. It provides an infallible sense check on heroic
claims about future growth and decoupling rate forecasts.

But Warlenius uses the claim of 'fraudulence' to argue that the IPAT
analysis should be replaced with what he calls a 'realist, dynamic
theory of decoupling'. The paper does not elaborate this theory. But we
can gain some hint of the direction of travel from the subsequent
assertion that 'growth is probably more likely than degrowth to enable
the conditions for intense climate transitions' (Warlenius, op cit p8
\[emphasis added\]). Without more detail it\'s difficult to know
precisely what the author has in mind here. But it is worth pointing to
several reasons why such a claim may be misguided.

Firstly, as Fig. 1 makes clear, the growth-based economy starts from
behind in the race for sufficient decoupling and must run considerably
faster in order to catch up. The required rate of decoupling must be
increased by whatever the growth rate is if the economy has a chance of
meeting any given target. The higher the growth rate the greater this
increase in the required rate of decoupling. Note too that this must
remain the case in perpetuity while the economy continues to grow. A
little like the Red Queen in Lewis Carrol\'s Alice Through the Looking
Glass, the growth-based economy ends up running faster and faster just
to remain (at best) in the same place (Jackson, 2021a: 40).

Secondly, the prioritisation of economic growth tends to side-line
social and environmental goals and sometimes even the goal of financial
and economic stability. At its most damaging, this tendency was
exhibited in the recent, very short lived, Truss-Kwarteng government in
the UK which managed to increase the national debt, prolong inflation,
raise interest rates and depress the housing market in a matter of weeks
during its short tenure. But the same tendency to prioritise GDP growth
over long-term sustainability or wellbeing outcomes has been visible for
decades (Stiglitz, 2009). Even when investments in low carbon or
renewable technology offer clear positive rates of return, investment
finance for the transition must still compete with unregulated financial
markets which favour speculation or short-term gain and end up
externalising both ecological and social costs (Christophers, 2021). The
reasons for this are complex and multifaceted (Jackson, 2021a: Chapter
2). But at the centre of them lies the legitimation of highly
unsustainable investment and spending decisions on the grounds of
protecting economic growth.

Thirdly, the growth-based economy generates a very particular dynamic
which sets up a positive feedback loop between consumer expectations on
the one hand and the maximisation of profit on the other (Jackson, 2017:
103--117). This feedback loop creates a 'growth imperative' at the heart
of the modern economy which has unfavourable implications for the
possibilities of decarbonising technologies and dematerialising consumer
lifestyles. It systematically pulls materials and energy through the
economic system and releases them into the environment. Ironically, it
is also poorly aligned with our understanding of human wellbeing.

It is this dynamic Jackson has in mind when addressing the question of
'whether \[sufficient decoupling\] is possible in our kind of society'.
A part of the attraction of the idea of 'green growth' is that it
appears to offer a technological way to bypass this dilemma. But in
doing so, it leaves the underlying dynamic -- and its implications for
sustainability and climate transition -- completely unexplored. By
contrast, postgrowth scholarship -- by virtue of letting go of the
allegiance to growth -- has been far more attentive to ways in which it
is possible to correct the underlying dynamic (Latouche, 2007; Jackson,
2017; Jackson, 2021a; Kallis, 2018; Victor, 2008/2019, Victor, 2023;
Hickel, 2020).

Finally, it is [as a result of this deeper analysis]{.underline} that
[the postgrowth position expands the opportunities available to the
climate transition]{.underline}. [Under growth-oriented
conditions]{.underline}, as Vogel and Hickel (2023) explain, [**green
growth** relies on '**replacing** **existing infrastructure** and
**technology**]{.underline} ... with low-carbon or low-energy
alternatives'. They note that '[This type of transition **cannot** be
done at just any desired speed, nor promptly accelerated at any desired
rate, given **available** production **facilities**, **know how**,
**labour**, material **resources**, existing **infrastructure**, and
**so on**]{.underline}.' [They conclude that the large,
**near**-**instantaneous** **acceleration** of decoupling that would be
**required** for high-income countries to achieve growth while also
decarbonizing fast enough to stay within **fair-shares** of
**Paris**]{.underline}-compliant carbon budgets [is **un**likely to be
**feasible**]{.underline}.

By contrast, the [postgrowth position does not exclude the technological
change]{.underline} or the infrastructure transition proposed by green
growth. [But it offers **in addition** the possibility of
**restructuring** the **economy** and **shifting** modal **consumption
patterns**]{.underline} -- [for instance by **scaling down** energy and
carbon intensive forms of production, switching from **private** to
**public transit**, shifting from material-intensive goods to
labour-intensive **services** and focussing on **better indicators** of
**wellbeing**]{.underline}. Postgrowth scholars argue that [reducing
unnecessary forms of production also frees up productive capacity that
can be **mobilised**]{.underline} -- [for instance through **public
works** and a **j**ob **g**uarantee]{.underline} -- [to accelerate the
transition further, leading to faster **economic decoupling** than could
be achieved in a **growth**-**oriented** **scenario** alongside social
decoupling]{.underline}. (Jackson, 2017; Kallis, 2018; Hickel, 2020;
Hickel et al., 2022; Jackson et al., 2023; Vogel and Hickel, 2023).

It is worth noting that the impact of such changes on the size of the
GDP is not straightforward to determine. It depends entirely on what
sectors change, which products and services are reduced or increased,
how provisioning systems are transformed, and how prices, demand,
investment and returns change as a result. None of this can be predicted
from the Ehrlich-Holdren formula \[1\]. But neither does the arithmetic
itself imply that a massive collapse in the GDP is implicit in the
postgrowth position. On the contrary, there are already several
postgrowth macroeconomic models and scenarios suggesting that deep
decarbonisation is possible without massive economic collapse (Jackson
and Victor, 2020; D\'Alessandro et al., 2020; Barrett et al., 2022;
Negawatt, 2022; Millward-Hopkins and Oswald, 2023). It is a shame that
Warlenius fails to engage with, or even cite, this emerging literature.

6\. Concluding remarks

In short, [there are no grounds to accuse postgrowth scholars of
endorsing economic collapse]{.underline}. On the contrary, [the
postgrowth perspective **expands** the range of **options** open to
society in **navigating** the climate transition]{.underline}. It
includes those technological efficiency options favoured by growth
advocates. It extends the possibilities for structural change to include
changes not necessarily aligned with the pursuit of growth. It also
offers an opportunity to follow the 'path less travelled' in human
progress, an invitation to relationship and meaning alongside material
sufficiency as the destination for human flourishing (Jackson, 2021a;
Kallis, 2018). This approach stands, in our view, as a vital
counterpoint to the narrow pursuit of material affluence embodied by the
growth-at-all-costs position.

[There is **no doubt** that the **climate** transition is
**daunting**]{.underline}. [But that **does not** justify **flinching**
from **hard truths**]{.underline}. [Confronting the **dilemma** of
**growth** will require a **rigorous attention** to the **ecological
limits** that define our world and to the economic and social structures
that shape and constrain our societies]{.underline}. The contribution of
a growth-critical ecological economics has been central to those tasks
over more than four decades. It will remain so over the next.

### Alt---Authoritarianism---2AC

#### The alt risks authoritarian takeover in even [best-case scenarios]{.underline}.

**Albert, 23**---Lecturer in International Relations, SOAS, University
of London (Michael, "Ecosocialism for Realists: Transitions, Trade-Offs,
and Authoritarian Dangers," Capitalism Nature Socialism, 34:1, 11-30,
dml)

The scenario sketched above highlights that ecosocialist degrowth
[transitions would most likely occur in a context of **deepening
political-economic crisis**]{.underline}, intensifying climate shocks,
and worsening insecurity for the majority of populations. A key danger,
then, is that [[even]{.mark} in [the **best-case**]{.mark} **scenario**
in which]{.underline} powerful red-green [movements **decisively shift**
the balance of power]{.underline} vis-à-vis capital and elect leftist
parties following ecosocialist platforms, [this [could lead
to]{.mark}]{.underline} "**[[authoritarian]{.underline}]{.mark}**" forms
of ecosocialism, understood as ecosocialist [[regimes]{.mark} that
institutionalize]{.underline} "**[state of emergency]{.underline}**"
[provisions such as unchecked executive power]{.underline}, [the
suspension of democratic rights and procedures]{.underline},
[restrictions on free speech]{.underline}, [and military-police
repression of dissent]{.underline} (Petras and Fitzgerald Citation1988).
[This has]{.underline} of course [been one of the primary challenges
confronting **[all]{.mark} socialist [transitions
historically]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [which [have had to fight off
external]{.mark} military [intervention]{.mark}]{.underline},
[resistance from capitalist [elites]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and
reactionary currents]{.mark} from below in order to protect
revolutionary gains]{.underline}. [[Things would be **no
different**]{.mark} for future ecosocialisms-in-transition]{.underline},
particularly [[given the]{.mark} likely contradiction between the
[**speed**]{.mark} at which]{.underline} consumption [cuts may need to
be made]{.underline} in the global north [and the **slowness** with
which]{.underline} post-materialist [cultural change would
occur]{.underline}, yet such problems have not been systematically
explored by ecosocialists and degrowth scholars. [The risks
are]{.underline} twofold: first, [that [authoritarian measures would be
needed to **enforce**]{.mark} **lifestyle [changes]{.mark}** upon
recalcitrant populations]{.underline} and "deal with the exceptional
circumstances of direct and serious threat" to the survival of
ecosocialist regimes in their early phases; [and]{.underline} second,
that such measures, rather than being temporally limited and abolished
once the "exceptional circumstances" are dealt with, [become the **new
normal**]{.underline} (94).

Quincy Saul and Andreas Malm are among the few ecosocialists who don't
shy away from this problem. Saul, for one, writes that "a period of
'emergency rule,' when the expropriators are expropriated, must be
revised for the twenty-first century, it cannot be dismissed or glossed
over" (Saul Citation2011, 58--59). Similarly, Malm suggests that
carrying out the transition in the needed time frame would require.

warlike state management of all industries ... centralized decisions on
who can consume what goods in what amounts, \[and\] punishment of
transgressors threatening the annual emissions targets ... \[which\] can
only be feasible under an exceptional regime dealing with an unheard-of
emergency (Malm Citation2015, 187)

The risk, in other words, is that ecosocialist [regimes]{.underline}
that are democratically elected in a context of unprecedented
climate-energy-economic crises [may be **forced** down an authoritarian
path in order to enforce carbon rationing]{.underline}, [enact rapid and
far-reaching transformations in land-use]{.underline}, [break through
the gridlock of dysfunctional and polarized legislatures]{.underline},
[and defend themselves against violence and sabotage from capitalist
elites and the far-right]{.underline}. [The danger is **exacerbated** by
the fact that worsening climate and political-economic
[crises]{.mark}]{.underline}, [far from **neutralizing** the threat of
rightwing populism]{.underline}, [[will]{.mark} most likely
[**intensify** ethnonationalist reaction]{.mark} and political
polarization]{.underline}. As Malm and the Zetkin Collective explain:
"the higher the temperatures, the more acute the antagonism between a
left that alone stands ready to pick up the instruments for alleviating
the crisis and a right that, for that very reason, refuses to
contemplate it" (Malm and Collective Citation2021, 286--287).
Additionally, [given that]{.underline} ecosocialist [transitions would
entail a]{.underline} "**[life-threatening situation]{.underline}**"
[for]{.underline} most if not all sectors of [[the capitalist
class]{.underline}]{.mark}, [many]{.underline} of them [[would]{.mark}
likely **[ally with the far-right]{.mark}** in order [to halt]{.mark}
such [transitions]{.mark} in their tracks and restore capitalist
power]{.underline} "**[[by any means necessary]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
(241). Thus [even]{.underline} in [the **best-case
scenario**]{.underline} in which ecosocialists are able to assume power
in core states, this [would **almost certainly** occur in a context of
**rabid far-right resistance** in alliance with global
capital]{.underline}. The risks are particularly acute in, but not
limited to, the US, where the spectacle of armed insurrectionists
storming congress to try overthrowing the 2020 presidential election
give us a taste of what ecosocialists are up against.

### Alt---Authoritarianism---1AR

#### Authoritarianism is [likely]{.underline} due to lack of mechanisms for [allocation]{.underline} or [conflict resolution]{.underline}, and it [turns alt solvency]{.underline}.

**Terzi, 22**---Economist at the European Commission's
Directorate-General for Economic and Financial Affairs, Adjunct
Professor at Sciences Po and at HEC Paris (Alessio, "Post-Growth
Dystopia," *Growth for Good: Reshaping Capitalism to Save Humanity from
Climate Catastrophe*, Chapter 3, pp. 75, dml)

[Degrowth]{.underline}, by definition, [will **reduce** available
resources and create some **scarcity**]{.underline}, albeit, according
to its advocates, only for goods or ser vices that are unnecessary or
superfluous. [The]{.underline} implicit assumption, or **[hazardous
bet]{.underline}**, [is that this would be [**voluntary**
scarcity]{.mark}]{.underline}---[that everyone]{.underline}, once free
from the iron cage of consumerism, [would **gladly embrace** it as part
of a superior mode of simple living]{.underline}.68 In this chapter we
saw that, [if this were not to happen]{.underline}, [and
the]{.underline} "**[infinite desire for more]{.underline}**" (as Daniel
Cohen calls it) [were to remain **prevalent**]{.underline}, [degrowth
[would]{.mark} likely [turn into the]{.mark}]{.underline} proverbial
**[[road to hell]{.underline}]{.mark}**, paved with good intentions.

[[Ecosocialism does not have an **allocation
mechanism**]{.underline},]{.mark} [[or a way to **assuage
tensions**]{.mark} within society]{.underline}. The problems
[[this]{.underline}]{.mark} chapter has described [[would **rapidly**
cause the]{.mark} **entire**]{.underline} degrowth [[**utopian vision**
to **unravel**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[leaving]{.mark} citizens with
some combination of perceived [misery]{.mark}]{.underline}, [social
[tension]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[autarky]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[emigration]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and welfare
reductions]{.underline}]{.mark}. [An **intricate web of rules** would be
spun up to regulate most aspects of life]{.underline}---[all [presided
over by a]{.mark} strong central [government **at high risk of turning
illiberal**]{.mark} in its efforts to shore up its ideological raison
d'être]{.underline}. [The distance between ecosocialism and
ecoauthoritarianism is **shorter than one might imagine**]{.underline}.

### Alt---Cap Inevitable---2AC

#### There's no [feasibly solvent]{.underline} alternative to capitalism.

**Beardsworth, 10**---Head of the School of Politics and International
Studies and Professor of International Politics at the University of
Leeds (Richard, "Technology and Politics: A Response to Bernard
Stiegler," Cultural Politics (2010) 6 (2): 181--199, dml)

Now, for Stiegler, the question of technics is a Greek question because
the relation between the human and the technical is explicitly posed by
the Greeks, and any thinking on technology necessarily works within this
Greek framework.5 Whatever one makes of this thesis technologically
speaking, the question of the modern and contemporary autonomy of the
economic from the social whole is nevertheless not Greek. With the end
of the Cold War, [with increasing trans-border activity of
capital]{.underline}, [goods]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}, to a much
lesser extent, [labor]{.underline}, [capital comes to **determine the
terms** in which the allocation of scarce resources is
made]{.underline}. Capital becomes, that is, general, [and [there
is]{.mark} for the foreseeable future **[no alternative]{.mark}** to
it]{.underline}.6 [**All** human beings live within the system of
capital]{.underline}, [**whatever** the particular node they live
on]{.underline}, [or conjunction they make with it]{.underline}. This
system is highly unstable and dissymmetrical with immense imbalances in
equality, natural resource distribution, financial assets, and terms of
trade. [With no alternative to capital]{.underline}, [a revolutionary
politics is **no longer tenable**]{.underline}. The ethical question
driving political innovation has, consequently, to be worked out in
terms of universally coordinated, but locally determined equilibriums
between growth, sustainability, and equity. Given economic
interdependence and the necessity of large transfers of technology and
wealth from the developed world to the developing world in the context
of climate change, **[[effective financial
regulation]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[economic
coordination]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and]{.mark} **staggered
[development]{.mark}** [present the right strategies to **tame**]{.mark}
**the [excesses]{.mark}** of neoliberal global capitalism]{.underline}.
Whether these strategies are feasible or not is at present an open
question given recent government failure to regulate risk-taking and the
evident dilemma, for developing countries, between the need for
curtailed energy use, on the one hand, and industrialization and exit
from poverty, on the other.

Now, whatever our answers to these large questions, the political
question today---'who are we?'---can only be appraised if the political
economy of a globalized world becomes the direct object of critical
attention. Only by foregrounding this object and its dilemmas will one
have any chance of critical purchase on the political challenges ahead.
In this context, Stiegler\'s [[foregrounding]{.underline}]{.mark} of
technology to promote [a **new critique**]{.underline} of political
economy [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} decisive in purpose and tone,
important in detail, but **[[misplaced]{.underline}]{.mark}** in general
intent. Stiegler is right to stress again the pertinence of the economy
for critical thought after "the supposed economism of Marxism" (2009:
29). His technologically trained focus on the alienated consumer is
important within the cognitive dimension of contemporary capitalism and
debt-led growth. But, if he is concerned to show, as a philosopher,
[the]{.underline} general lines of a re-invented critical political
economy, his [object and attention need to be **much
larger**]{.underline} than his "Greek" framework affords. Since there is
no systemic alternative to capitalism at this moment in history, [the
question]{.underline} of political economy [is]{.underline} one of
[whether **effective regulation** of capitalism is **possible** or
**not** for the world as a whole]{.underline}.

In this regard, I fear that Stiegler\'s rhetorical logic of excess
testifies to a straightforward shift of Marxist
[terminology]{.underline} (from producer to consumer) rather than a
reinvention [of]{.underline} Marxism\'s object (political economy). I
say this despite the deep interest in understanding [**cognitive
capitalism** and **consumerism**]{.underline} through Stiegler\'s
categories. To take a few examples from only the last pages of Pour une
nouvelle critique de l\'économie politique: we are witnessing the
"extreme disenchantment of the world" (2009: 88), a "generalized
proletariat \[of consumption\]" (89), the "disappearance of the middle
classes" (89), the "destruction" of social association (87), and
"lawless and faithless" elites of capitalism (88). This logic of excess
[[**ignores** the need]{.mark} today [to make **small
distinctions**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [under the canopy of **political
regulation**]{.underline}, [within the world as a whole]{.underline}.
[The art of politics today is the prudential art of **making critical
distinctions** within an economy of the same]{.underline}. "[Critical
[philosophy]{.mark}]{.underline}" [may [wish to **eschew**]{.mark} such
distinctions]{.underline}, [but [it does so at its **practical peril**
when]{.mark}]{.underline} there is no alternative to capitalism, and
when, just as importantly, [[the **mid-term horizon**
is]{.underline}]{.mark} global coordination of a world economy under
circumstances of **[[economic imbalance]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[[energy-crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and
**poverty**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[The **political questions**]{.mark} **today** [are]{.mark}
therefore]{.underline}: "[[**what kind of regulation** of capitalism is
**ethically** and **empirically appropriate**]{.mark}?]{.underline}";
"[[at **what level**]{.mark} is it appropriate?]{.underline}";
[and]{.underline} "[**what instance** should and can
decide?]{.underline}". These are vast and difficult questions for
philosophy, political science, and economics: they will occupy minds and
bodies for a long time to come. It is my belief that, [within these
questions and their distinctions]{.underline}, an engaged philosophy
(which Stiegler rightly advocates) has an important role to play. [A
generalized]{.underline} technological [reading]{.underline} of Marx
creates in this context important cultural work; but it **[does not
give]{.underline}** itself [the terms]{.underline} of a contemporary
critique of political economy.

I end this section with one example of what kinds of matter need to be
"adopted," and how. There has been much talk recently of the
[regulation]{.underline} of financial offshore centers. Such talk, when
coming from elite bodies in power, [**can** serve as a
smoke-screen]{.underline} to evade the major issue of imbalances within
the world economy as a whole (particularly the northwestern problem of
public and private debt). Worldwide coordinated investment in the real
economy remains in this context an outstanding question. **[That
said]{.underline}**, the [political [regulation]{.mark}]{.underline} of
these tax havens [[forms part of the **ongoing struggle**
against]{.underline}]{.mark} international and national neoliberal
practices, since it was financial offshore centers, starting with the
Eurodollar markets, which helped promote capital mobility at the end of
the 1970s.7 It is this capital mobility that ended the "social
democratic contract" between capital and labor at the level of the
nation-state and in the framework of the Bretton Woods international
system of fixed exchange rates. It consequently paved the way for
"disembedded" global **[capitalism]{.underline}**, widespread debt-led
growth, [and]{.underline}, under worldwide conditions of financial
contagion, massive **[[social disorientation]{.underline}]{.mark}**.8
The financial and economic crises of 2007--09 resulted from
"de-regulation" of domestic and global assets (from mortgages to complex
financial tools like swaps and derivatives). This de-regulation enabled
financial capital accumulation from the 1970s onwards. It is now
generally accepted that 60 percent of profits in the corporate sector
have been finance-based in the last ten years (Brenner 2006: 293). [To
regulate]{.underline} offshore accounts in this context [is therefore
**ideologically** and **structurally crucial**]{.underline} for the
political "adoption" of contemporary capitalism. For, owners of these
accounts have fed the recent spiral of risk-taking (a half of global
capital is estimated to lie in such accounts!), but they have continued
to refuse the social costs of (their) national public life. [The object
of concern for critical political economy is consequently **less**
the]{.underline} credit-card-**[consumer]{.underline}** (and profits
based on the capitalization of his or her external memory supports)
[than **effective regulation** of their economic causes]{.underline}.

That said, **[how]{.underline}**, in today\'s world economy, [can one
regulate these]{.underline} capital accounts? [This is the **urgent
political question**]{.underline}. To stop the businesses of nations
moving large amounts of their capital offshore to avoid domestic
taxation suggests either the necessity of global taxation or renewed
domestic regulation of capital outflow (as in the 1960s and 1970s in
"embedded" liberal states). The political cosmopolitan response---global
regulations of all international capital flows---is certainly the best
response theoretically since capital competition thrives on exceptions
to legal norms. It is however institutionally impractical given the weak
status of international rule. Nation-state fiscal policy is practical
since it can block capital displacement to more competitive national
markets. National monetary policy requires, however, clear leadership,
democratic example, and effective bureaucratic surveillance (and in the
case of the EU it is already not possible given the monetary sovereignty
of the European Central Bank). And so forth. My point is this.

[These kinds of [dilemmas]{.mark} immediately face any progressive
thinking]{.underline} of political economy today: [they [require]{.mark}
**careful [ethical]{.mark}** [and **empirical exposition**]{.mark}
**[before]{.mark}** one can make **[general critical
claims]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The regulation of financial offshore
centers is actually one of the more simple problems of global
cooperation to solve, although its structural effects will be deep
concerning finance-led growth. How much more [**conceptual** and
**empirical thinking** is needed [to work out]{.mark} market and
government motivation for **effective [climate]{.mark} change
[mitigation]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [[or]{.mark} to work
out]{.underline} long-term [the **global imbalance** between Chinese
savings and US [debt]{.mark}]{.underline} ... [Regarding these political
dilemmas]{.underline} concerning effective regulation of global capital
flows, [[I remain **unconvinced** that]{.underline}]{.mark} Stiegler\'s
[philosophico-technical [reading]{.mark}]{.underline} of the economy
[[can]{.underline}]{.mark} (1) [**properly [delimit]{.mark}**
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} economic [[problems]{.underline}]{.mark} that
need to be adopted; [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} (2) [[tease out the
**differences of approach required**]{.underline}]{.mark} to adopt
contemporary economic conditions effectively. Under the general
conditions of a capitalist world economy, however, these differences
constitute the very condition of more local social re-motivation
(Stiegler\'s very concern).

Removing obstacles to his rollout increases Trump's ability to wage
authoritarian crackdowns on dissenters and mass movements which
challenge his agenda and administration. [The question of whether [Trump
will]{.mark} pursue [suppress]{.mark}ion of [dissent]{.mark} is **only**
a question of **degree**]{.underline}. The recent settlement with ABC
News for defamation is [one end of the spectrum]{.underline}, where
[Trump [uses]{.mark}]{.underline} 'light' [[**lawfare** to]{.mark} bring
[pressure]{.mark} on his [critics]{.mark}]{.underline}. Legislation
which would give the Treasury [broad powers to remove]{.underline} the
[**non-profit** status]{.underline} of pro-Palestinian groups [would be
an even further step]{.underline} in this direction. Finally, [[the far
end]{.mark} of the spectrum [is]{.mark}]{.underline} the more [direct
implementation of [state repression to]{.mark} **detain**]{.underline},
**[persecute]{.underline}**, [and [**prosecute**]{.mark} activists and
[dissidents]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This is not science fiction but
**recent history**]{.underline}; [the **[Bush]{.mark}** administration
[argued it could]{.mark} legally [detain]{.mark} US
[citizens]{.mark}]{.underline} deemed "enemy combatants" [and hold them
indefinitely]{.underline} without charges, [and also [tortured detainees
at]{.mark}]{.underline} "**[[black sites]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [around
the world with impunity]{.underline}. [The **[FBI]{.mark}** also
[surveilled]{.mark} meetings of [anti-war
activists]{.mark}]{.underline}, [targeting the **ISO** in
2005]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} as Edward Snowden revealed, [the
US]{.underline} basically [**monitors everyone all the time** through
programs including **XKeyscore** and **PRISM**]{.underline}.

[The [US]{.mark} government already [has **broad powers** to **crack
down**]{.mark} on street protests and other forms of militant direct
action]{.underline}, [but **far [more]{.mark}** [could be done by
Trump]{.mark} and his]{.underline} **[D]{.underline}**epartment
**[o]{.underline}**f **[J]{.underline}**ustice [[through]{.mark}
escalating]{.underline} "**[[lawfare]{.underline}]{.mark}**." One
possibility is that [[**RICO** charges]{.underline}]{.mark}, the law
used to go after organized crime, [could be brought [against
activist]{.mark} organization[s]{.mark}]{.underline} like DSA [which
organize mass civil disobedience]{.underline}; [such an approach would
empower the government to bring charges against basically
**every**]{.underline} DSA **[member]{.underline}**.

Politically, the suppression will almost certainly follow the
traditional strategy of counter-revolution. In this strategy, [the
[**vanguard** of]{.mark} the [revolutionary forces]{.mark} are [met
**directly** with]{.mark} **stiff [repression]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[[while]{.mark} the surrounding [forces are **cowed into
silence**]{.mark} in order [to **isolate**]{.mark} the more [militant
layers]{.mark} from solidarity]{.underline}. [Once the most militant
layers are dispatched]{.underline}, [the broader movement can be dealt
with **easily**]{.underline}.

[We have already seen how [the US]{.mark} ruling class has sought to
[employ this method to defend **Israel**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [bringing
direct police repression]{.underline} against street activists, which is
[paired with a larger campaign]{.underline} to brand anyone who stands
with Palestine in any way, or who doesn't join in the repression of
activists, as antisemitic.

[It is possible that Trump does not **immediately** pursue an
authoritarian crackdown]{.underline}, [but that [such]{.mark} a
[crackdown is employed if]{.mark} street [protests reach a
**threatening**]{.mark} **[height]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Another
potential is that the [[authorities]{.mark} could [allow]{.mark} the
**[MAGA]{.mark} activist layers** [to intimidate the]{.mark} mass
[movements]{.mark}]{.underline}, [looking the other way or even
coordinating with them]{.underline}.

Another possibility is that [suppression of dissidents could take place
in line with a **serious escalation** of a **conflict**]{.underline}
with China. Considering that fear-mongering around China has long been
the bi-partisan approach, a conflict with China may initially have a
much larger base of support among the population as opposed to
escalations in the Middle East or with Russia. If there was widespread
popular support, [this would leave any anti-war activists **highly
isolated**]{.underline}.

Overall, in the short term [[Trump has]{.mark} **broad
[discretion]{.mark}** and **few obstacles**]{.underline} as to how far
to pursue authoritarianism, while in the more medium and long term the
regime will follow what is in the best interest of the ruling clique of
the American capitalist class assembled around Trump and the class as a
whole. This will develop on three main axes---the extent to which
authoritarianism is needed by the Trump clique [to **enforce** its
rule]{.underline} on the capitalist class as a whole (suppressing the
Democrats and the rule of law), the extent authoritarianism is needed
[[to **discipline** the nation]{.mark} in preparation [for
war]{.mark}]{.underline} or escalating proxy wars with China,
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} the extent authoritarianism is needed [to
[**suppress** threats to]{.mark}]{.underline} key pillars of capitalism
such as imperialism, white supremacy, and undemocratic political
structures, or [the [capitalist system]{.mark}]{.underline} as a whole.

The last of these potentialities suggests that the greater our success
in challenging Trump--- that is, [[the **more dangerous** we
become]{.underline}]{.mark} to his regime---[[the **greater the danger**
of]{.mark} authoritarian [suppression]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[DSA]{.mark} is **[not]{.mark} yet [prepared]{.mark}** [to wage]{.mark}
large scale mass [movements against Trump]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} moreover [is **totally [unprepared]{.mark}**
[to take on]{.mark} **any [real]{.mark} [steps]{.mark}** in response to
an authoritarian crackdown]{.underline}. [If there is an attempt to
suppress the left]{.underline}, [including through lawfare and mass
arrests]{.underline}, [it will be]{.underline} crippling
\[**[devastating]{.underline}**\]. [If Trump sets out to
suppress]{.underline} DSA, the pro-Palestinian anti-war movement, or
other [forces on the left in a **real way**]{.underline}, [[he will
meet]{.mark} [opponents **hardly prepared** to resist]{.mark} in **any
substantial way**]{.underline}, [or to carry forward and escalate mass
resistance [while operating]{.mark} in]{.underline}
"**[[underground]{.underline}]{.mark}**" or "semi-underground"
[conditions]{.underline}.

Electric Shock; Electric Boogaloo

[Almost **certainly**]{.underline}, [we are [**not prepared** to face
Trump]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Our [organizations are **too
small**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [our methods are **[not
professional]{.mark}ized**]{.underline}, [our political [perspectives
are]{.mark} **[underdeveloped]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [our strategy is
[too often **self-isolating**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}
most importantly, [our coherent vision of a positive alternative for
society **does not**]{.underline} yet **[exist]{.underline}**. [The
coming struggle will reveal the extent of our unpreparedness like a
**painful electric shock**]{.underline}.

### Alt---Cronyism---2AC

#### The alt gets coopted by [cronyism]{.underline}---causes extinction. Plan's key to manage the transition.

at the Utrecht University School of Economics, "The economy doesn't need
a reset, and neither does management theory," Scandinavian Journal of
Management, Volume 38, Issue 3, September 2022, dml)

In this article, [we offer a critical view of the **Great Reset**
thesis]{.underline}, defined as [the insistence on **more government
intervention** in the innovation process]{.underline} through subsidy
schemes or direct involvement, more emphasis on stakeholder capitalism
brought about by a combination of [**legislation** and **pressure** on
business]{.underline}, [and **new metrics**]{.underline} used [to
monitor]{.underline} private as well as public actors' performance with
respect to **[sustainability]{.underline}**,
**[innovation]{.underline}**, [and **stakeholder
performance**]{.underline}. [The [Great Reset]{.mark} thesis is a set of
**normative [propositions]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [calls for a better
world that supposedly should be championed by]{.underline} management
[**scholars** as well as]{.underline} political and business
[**leaders** and the **public**]{.underline}. [While]{.underline} Great
Reset [proponents do not]{.underline} a [call for **eliminating**
markets or capitalism]{.underline}, [they [call for
**new**]{.mark}]{.underline}, normative management [**[theory]{.mark}**
that]{.underline} in many ways [is **inconsistent** with the market
economy in its current form]{.underline}. The Great Reset is not only
about changing managers' objectives, beliefs, and actions, but also
changing how organizations interact. In essence, calls for stakeholder
management, new metrics for assessing social and environmental impact,
and greater government intervention in markets to achieve social and
environmental goals are closely related; [they represent]{.underline}
complementary [arguments for [**restructuring** the]{.mark} conventional
[capitalist model]{.mark}]{.underline} in which the means of production
are privately owned and these owners---for large companies,
shareholders---are responsible for managing their assets.

We argue that [[the Great Reset]{.mark} thesis is based on a
**fundamental lack of appreciation** of the power of **markets** to
bring about desirable social outcomes]{.underline}. In [calling for a
**break** with the traditional capitalist model]{.underline}, it [[leads
to a world in]{.mark} which **pressing [social]{.mark}**]{.underline},
**[[environmental]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and **political challenges**
are **exacerbated**]{.mark} rather than **alleviated**]{.underline}.
Moreover, [the]{.underline} Great Reset [thesis rests on a **naïve
conception** of how governments work that neglects **well-known
problems** concerning what governments]{.underline}
(**[can]{.underline}**) **[know]{.underline}**, [their **incentives** to
take the right actions]{.underline}, [and their vulnerability to
**rent-seeking** on the part of organized special
interests]{.underline}. [[It]{.mark} also **[mistakenly
believes]{.mark}** that [the current system is]{.mark} a mostly
[unfettered]{.mark} market-based economy]{.underline} (e.g., Schwab,
2020) [when]{.underline}, [in reality]{.underline}, [[there is]{.mark}
already **[massive]{.mark} government
intervention**]{.underline}---[and]{.underline}, as a result, **[[crony
capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Klein, Holmes, Foss, Terjesen, &
Pepe, 2021)---[in **every major sector** of the economy]{.underline}
(Stiglitz, 1989, Majone, 1994).

At the firm level, [the]{.underline} Great Reset [thesis is]{.underline}
similarly [based more on]{.underline} a **[naïve belief]{.underline}**
in the benefits of stakeholder governance [rather than a
**careful**]{.underline}, [**sober analysis** of the **relative
benefits** and **costs** of alternative systems of
governance]{.underline}, including shareholder and stakeholder models.
As [a **large literature** suggests]{.underline}, stakeholder
[approaches are **plagued** by]{.underline} unresolved (and perhaps
**[unresolvable]{.underline}**) [**problems** of aligning the interests
of multiple stakeholders with goals that **cannot** be
aligned]{.underline} in the absence of a common scale of measurement
(Jensen, 2004; Foss & Klein, 2018). The new proposed metrics will not
solve these problems.

Moreover, implementing stakeholder management amounts to a dilution of
ownership. Ownership is an economic function that can be performed
better or worse, and [the goal of an economic system should
be]{.underline} to align ownership with **[ownership
competence]{.underline}** (Foss, Klein, Lien, Zellweger, & Zenger,
2021). Stakeholder management [[proposals risk]{.mark} putting ownership
in the hands of **[less competent owners]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Foss &
Klein, 2018), [which is **particularly [harmful]{.mark}** [under]{.mark}
the]{.underline} conditions of **[high novelty]{.underline}**,
**[uncertainty]{.underline}**, [and **complexity** that characterize
[more innovative parts]{.mark} of the economy]{.underline} (e.g., Adams
& Licht, 2011). In particular, as emphasized by Hansmann (1996), larger
and more heterogeneous groups have difficulty exercising ownership
rights, as [[diverging interests make agreement
**difficult**]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly where exit from the
group is costly. Thus, [even if we conceive of]{.underline} a community,
**[society]{.underline}**, or even the entire world population [as the
**rightful**]{.underline} "**[owners]{.underline}**" [of]{.underline}
various [public goods]{.underline} (e.g., environmental preservation),
[[it **doesn't follow** that **assigning ownership**]{.mark} **rights
[to everyone]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the group [[will be
**effective**]{.underline}]{.mark} in achieving the group's goals.

At the same time, [[concentrating]{.mark} **more [decision
power]{.mark}** in the hands of governments]{.underline}, [implementing
**complex** and **diffuse metrics**]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark}
**diluting [ownership]{.mark}**]{.underline} by groups high in ownership
competence (typically, private investors) [**hampers** the functioning
of markets]{.underline}, [[allows for **more crony
capitalism**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[and **reduces the
resources**]{.underline}]{.mark} that are [**available** [for]{.mark}
fostering [innovation and]{.mark} economic [growth]{.mark}]{.underline},
[the **primary means** of alleviating poverty]{.underline}, [improving
global health]{.underline}, [and improving the quality of
life]{.underline}. Leveraging management theory in the service of the
Great Reset therefore risks being a harmful enterprise. We end by
sketching an alternative market-based way forward.

### Alt---Cronyism---1AR

#### We control the direction of offense. Cronyism explains the flaws of capitalism [more robustly]{.underline} and the alt makes them all [worse]{.underline}.

**Foss, et al, 22**---Professor of Strategy at the Department of
Strategy and Innovation, Copenhagen Business School, Honorary Adjunct

University (Nicolai, with Peter Klein, W. W. Caruth Endowed Chair,

of International Business and Interim Head of Section (Entrepreneurship)
at the Utrecht University School of Economics, "The economy doesn't need
a reset, and neither does management theory," Scandinavian Journal of
Management, Volume 38, Issue 3, September 2022, dml)

While [[the **Great Reset**]{.mark} is]{.underline} fundamentally a set
of normative propositions---[a [call for
large-scale]{.mark}]{.underline} political and corporate
[[action]{.underline}]{.mark} in the service of broad, societal goals
such as sustainability---it is [based on **underlying descriptive
assumptions**]{.underline}. [The **basic**]{.underline}, [and **mostly
unanalyzed**]{.underline}, [premise]{.underline} of the Great Reset [is
that the existing social organization of economic
activities]{.underline} ([**imprecisely described** as]{.underline}
"**[neo-liberalism]{.underline}**") [has proven]{.underline} unable to
deal with "grand challenges." These challenges include the Covid-19
pandemic (as well as future, as yet unknown pandemics), the alleged
increase in worldwide inequality, the various climate challenges, and
the supposed declining innovativeness of private business which
translates into reduced ability to deal with the other challenges. In
other words, the Great Reset thesis rests on a strong claim of what
economists call "market **[failure]{.underline}**" (mainly
"externalities"; Bator, 1958; Zerbe & McCurdy, 1999).

[Those who call for the Great Reset may not use this
**terminology**]{.underline}. Instead, [they criticize]{.underline}
"**[capitalism]{.underline}**" for causing inequality, making natural
resources being too heavily exploited, failing to direct innovation in
the best possible ways, ignoring sustainability concerns, and so on
(World Economic Forum, 2020). Much of [this critique **lacks
concreteness** and is]{.underline} entirely
"**[boilerplate]{.underline}**." In particular, [[it is **rarely
explained** how]{.mark} **exactly**]{.underline}
"**[[capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[does]{.mark} all [these
things]{.mark}]{.underline}; all are common to all known forms of social
organization. [Economic activity is driven by human wants and
needs]{.underline} and the ability of people to satisfy those wants and
needs, [given]{.underline} the **[constraints]{.underline}** of
scarcity, production, and knowledge. Capitalism is merely a way of
dealing with these basic facts (although some may of course argue that
capitalism creates "unnecessary" needs and wants). [Many]{.underline}
proponents of Great Reset thinking [claim they are not against
**capitalism per se**]{.underline}, [just the **forms**]{.underline} of
capitalism [that are most common today]{.underline}.

Thus, the critique of capitalism is interspersed with the critique of
neoliberalism [which comes across as]{.underline} the
politico-ideological superstructure to current capitalism. A recent
short essay by a WEF associate announces the "end of neoliberalism" as
policymakers need to act against [increasing concentration of
**profits**]{.underline} among a few industries, concentration of
profits within industries (which, the author claims, are "hoarded"
rather than invested), increased [dispersion of **wages**]{.underline}
within industries causing rising inequality, [and]{.underline}
increasing **[market power]{.underline}** exercised by "platform
companies" such as Alibaba (Buckup, 2017). All this sounds fairly
damning and seems like a rehash of familiar Marxian themes. However, the
author also tellingly notes that "as neoliberalism took hold,
policymakers became less concerned about big firms converting profits
into political influence, and instead worried that governments were
protecting uncompetitive companies."

2.2. Capitalism---properly understood

What [these [critics are describing]{.mark}]{.underline} here is [[**not
capitalism** but]{.underline}]{.mark}
"**[[cronyism]{.underline}]{.mark}**" (Rubin, 2016). As Klein et al.
(2021) argue, [confusing capitalism [and]{.mark} cronyism is a
**long-standing mistake**]{.underline}. Classic proponents of the
free-enterprise system such as Schumpeter (1942)¸ Mises (1922), or
Friedman (1962) describe capitalism as a mode of social organization
which entails that (1) productive resources are (mostly) privately
owned, (2) markets are used to allocate resources, products and
services, (3) individuals and groups are (mostly) free to engage in
economic activity without centralized control or interference from the
state, and (4) institutions exist that enable (1) to (3), notably by
making sure that property rights to resources are precisely delineated
and enforced, which enables investments and make the costs of exchange
relatively low (for qualifications, reservations, etc., see Klein et
al., 2021). These are the "primitives" of capitalism as a system. Other
oft-mentioned aspects (whether positive, negative, or purely
descriptive), such as free movements of goods, capital, and labor across
borders, are derived from these.

[Critics]{.underline} of capitalism [**take for granted** that
capitalism is responsible for rampant pollution]{.underline},
[increasing inequality]{.underline}, [concentration of
industries]{.underline}, [and so on]{.underline}, [but [**rarely**
engage in **systematic**]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[empirically
[grounded]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[[comparative]{.mark} institutional
[analysis]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Both **theory** and a **careful
study** of the historical record suggest that non-capitalist systems
experience these problems to a **far greater degree**]{.underline} than
capitalist systems. For example, [in a market economy]{.underline},
[**well-defined [property rights]{.mark}** can [keep pollution
and]{.mark} other [sustainability]{.mark} issues [under
control]{.mark}]{.underline} (Rothbard, 1982); [in
contrast]{.underline}, [the **[worst]{.mark} known cases**
of]{.underline} industrial [[pollution occurred]{.underline}]{.mark} in
the twentieth century [in]{.underline} the [**non-capitalist countries**
[behind the **Iron Curtain**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Freedom of
contract]{.mark} will [secure **dynamism** and]{.mark} **social
[mobility]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} thus
**[counteract]{.mark}**]{.underline} tendencies to
**[[concentration]{.underline}]{.mark}** of industries
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} capital and increasing
**[[inequality]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Dean and Geloso, 2021, Nikolaev
and Bennett, 2016, Bennett & Nikolaev, 2016). Socialist economies, and
capitalist [economies characterized by]{.underline} a substantial degree
of [government intervention]{.underline}, [experience **stagnation** and
**social strife**]{.underline}.

[The basic vision]{.underline} outlined by the [above]{.underline}
thinkers [has been **remarkably correct** when applied to the economic
history of the last **two hundred years**]{.underline}. [Whenever
[capitalist principles]{.mark} have been applied they have tended to
[bring **prosperity**]{.mark}]{.underline},
**[[education]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[improvements in
[health]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[equality
of [opportunity]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Leeson, 2010). The wealth
generated by the operation of [free markets [provide]{.mark} the
**[resources]{.mark} needed** to deal with many environmental
issues]{.underline}. Defining **[[property rights]{.underline}]{.mark}**
to hitherto unowned resources, that is, pollution rights and making
these tradeable [has become an instrument of allocating such rights to
their **highest-valued uses** and **[stimulate innovation]{.mark}** in
technologies [that reduce]{.mark} CO2 [emissions]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Free markets]{.mark} and borders]{.underline} that are open to the
movement of products and services [[enable]{.mark} the
**[diffusion]{.mark}** of such technologies]{.underline}. In short,
[free markets have **increasingly been [instrumental]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark} dealing with [ecological challenges]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Among the various socio-economic systems, [it is **clear**
that]{.underline} "[capitalism comes **closest** to meeting the
conditions of **efficiency** and **maximum well-being**]{.underline},
[even if no capitalist economies meet these conditions
**perfectly**]{.underline}" (Klein et al., 2021).

2.3. Cronyism

[What]{.underline} the [critics]{.underline} essentially
[address]{.underline} and what calls for a Great Reset reflection
[are]{.underline}, as we see it, [the **aberrations** of capitalist
principles known as]{.underline} "**[cronyism]{.underline}**." [Cronyism
emerges because of **voids** in the institutional
frameworks]{.underline} that support productive activities in a
capitalist economy, and basically means that [private actors pursue
**rents**]{.underline}, [not by **competition**]{.underline} in the
marketplace [but by]{.underline} exploiting political
**[connections]{.underline}**. Such rents may come in the form of
monopoly rents from permits, licenses, legal protection and the like or
targeted tax breaks, loans, grants, etc. that are available to some but
not to others. Industrial planning and "winner-picking" easily devolves
into cronyism. The means to achieve these advantages range from lobbying
politicians and government officials to outright bribery.

Cronyism leads to many harmful consequences. Resources are invested in
political competition rather than competing to satisfy customer wants.
The dynamic market process which sorts among companies in terms of the
ability to satisfy such wants is hampered, while politically favored
firms thrive and grow at the expense of those without political
connections. Favored incumbents have a strong incentive to further
exploit their political connections to curb innovative entrants, foreign
entry, or startups within their industries (Holmes et al., 2013,
McMullen et al., 2008).

[Cronyism has **direct negative consequences** in the form of distorted
resource allocation]{.underline}, [productive inefficiency]{.underline},
[as well as long-term harms]{.underline} from suppressing new ideas,
innovations, products, services, and processes and sending signals that
the political process is unfair, unpredictable, non-transparent, and
catering to the interests of a narrow elite. Alesina and Angeletos
(2005: 913) argue that widespread cronyism makes people believe that
wealth is mainly determined by corruption, discouraging entrepreneurial
activity, reducing saving and investment, and thus reducing economic
growth and government revenues. Cronyism is also [associated with many
of the negative social outcomes that are often highlighted]{.underline}
by organizations such as WEF: [[cronyism has been linked]{.mark} to
**[less]{.mark} effective [protection]{.mark}** of the natural
environment]{.underline} (Duflo, Greenstone, Pande, & Ryan, 2013),
**[[negative health]{.mark} outcomes]{.underline}** (Halleröd,
Rothstein, Daoud, & Nandy, 2013), [and **[lower-quality
infrastructure]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [It]{.underline} should be clear
that at least part of the critique of existing "neoliberal" capitalism
**[isn't]{.underline}** a critique of [**capitalism per se**
but]{.underline} rather of **[cronyism]{.underline}**.

### Alt---No Mindset Shift---2AC

#### Collapse makes transition and mindset shift [less]{.underline} likely.

**Day, 25**---associate editor and former staff writer at Jacobin
(Meagan, "Don't Cheer a Recession,"
<https://jacobin.com/2025/04/recession-economy-crises-trump-democrats>,
dml)

But [[the Left]{.underline}]{.mark}, too, [[is guilty of fantasizing
about]{.mark} the **cleansing fires** of **[economic
crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [seeing in recession the potential for
**radical rupture**]{.underline}. The old joke goes that Marxists have
predicted ten of the last three economic crises; those predictions have
sometimes been tinged with excitement. Democrats hope Republicans will
disgrace themselves with an economic slump. The Left occasionally hopes
that capitalism will disgrace itself in much the same way. [[People will
**suffer**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [yes]{.underline}, [so [the thinking
goes]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[But]{.mark} the [immiseration may]{.mark}
also **[compel]{.mark}** [people to]{.mark} develop class
consciousness]{.underline}, [[mobilize]{.mark} on a mass
scale]{.underline}, [exploit emergent fissures]{.underline}, [[and
**transform** the]{.mark} political and economic
[system]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Unfortunately, [there are **no such guarantees**]{.underline}. Democrats
and Republicans are correct that economic turmoil presided over by their
opponent tends to redound to their own benefit in the short term --- a
process that seemingly played a major role in the most recent
presidential election. But the broader struggle between capital and
labor does not operate along the same lines as American partisan
competition. [Which direction an economic crisis breaks depends on
**complex** economic and political **variables**]{.underline}. And if
the last century is any indication, [[it's **just as likely** that
capital]{.mark} and its political allies [will emerge]{.mark} from a
given crisis [**invigorated** while]{.mark} labor and [the Left
feel]{.mark} the [**adverse effects** for **decades**]{.mark} to
come]{.underline}.

Opportunity or Setback?

The notion that economic crises fan the flames of revolution is as old
as the Marxist tradition itself. Rosa Luxemburg, Vladimir Lenin, and
Leon Trotsky all developed theories that saw political opportunity in
capitalism's crises.

In its better presentations, [this theory was]{.underline} not simply
that workers' conditions would deteriorate steadily to the point where
people would snap and refuse to take anymore, but instead [that
capitalism gives rise to **cyclical crises**]{.underline}, [and that
these moments of rupture]{.underline} --- when contradictions are laid
bare, consciousness surges, state institutions weaken, and the social
relations that reproduce capitalism break down --- [are ripe for
**socialist advance**]{.underline}. [The **Bolshevik
Revolution**]{.underline}, emerging during Russia's economic and social
collapse, [seemed to validate this hypothesis]{.underline}.

[Since then]{.underline}, [[**many** recessions have come and
gone]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and **[none]{.mark}** has [resulted
in]{.mark} a breakthrough as dramatic as the **Bolshevik
[Revolution]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- at least not in the advanced
capitalist world. [[Some]{.mark} economic crises have]{.underline}, on
the contrary, [[resulted in]{.mark} a relative **[weakening]{.mark}** of
the position of labor and [the Left]{.mark}]{.underline}.

This pessimistic theory makes every bit as much sense as its optimistic
counterpart. [By **definition**]{.underline}, [a [recession]{.mark} is a
period of **economic contraction**]{.underline}. This, in turn,
typically has labor market effects, [resulting in higher
unemployment]{.underline}, [which then **[reduces]{.mark}** the
[bargaining power]{.mark} of labor]{.underline}. When multiple
unemployed workers are lined up to fill every job, [an employed worker
has **far less ability** to say no to a pay cut]{.underline}, [a
speedup]{.underline}, [or a reduction in benefits]{.underline}. The boss
can always respond, "If you don't like it, I'll find someone else who
will" --- and often doesn't have to, as workers instinctively know the
score.

[Recessions also have social effects that [**undercut militancy** and
**solidarity**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[erecting **barriers** to]{.mark}
the [collective action]{.mark} that crises might otherwise
inspire]{.underline}. [[They]{.mark} can [produce **risk
aversion**]{.mark}]{.underline}, since it's much harder to risk getting
fired when losing your job means being thrown into an unforgiving labor
market. Meanwhile, [[crises]{.mark} can also [**strain**
relations]{.mark} between workers]{.underline}, [[creating]{.mark} an
environment of **scarcity**]{.underline},
[**[competition]{.underline}**, [and
**individualism**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Thus, [[even as crises
increase]{.mark} workers' **[recognition]{.mark}** of the necessity of
transforming the system]{.underline}, [[they]{.mark} may also [make it
**harder**]{.mark} for workers [to overcome
**fragmentation**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [which is **necessary** to take
advantage of the moment]{.underline}.

**Lake, 21**---communist organizer (Kenny, "Revolution has vanished,
replaced with fantasies of dual power, counterpower, "base areas,"
abolition, and other "bottom-up" bourgeois-democratic illusions," Kites
Journal, November 1, 2021, dml)

[For all their **aversion to collective discipline** and **democratic
centralism**]{.underline}, [for all their
**anti-vanguardism**]{.underline}, [for all their **donning of dogmatic
ideologies** and **petty sectarian bickering**]{.underline}, [it's
striking how **firmly united** most Leftists under]{.underline} the age
of [35 in the US are on the notion that]{.underline} passing out **[free
food]{.underline}**, doing **[community gardens]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} (**[maybe]{.underline}**...[most **never get this
far**]{.underline}) [some **NGO-style tenant organizing** will lead
to]{.underline}... **[revolution?]{.underline}** Beneath the absurdity
lies the fact that [[revolution]{.underline}]{.mark}---in the sense of a
civil war in which the bourgeoisie is overthrown, their state apparatus
is destroyed, and the means of production are seized---[has **vanished**
from people's political horizons]{.underline}. [It [has been
**replaced** with]{.mark} grandiose [illusions]{.mark} bearing monikers
[such as **dual power**]{.mark}]{.underline},
**[[counterpower]{.underline}]{.mark}**, "**[[base
areas]{.underline}]{.mark}**," [and **abolition**]{.underline}.
[Unifying]{.underline} all [these]{.underline} illusions [is [the notion
that it's possible to carve]{.mark} out]{.underline}
"**[[bottom-up]{.underline}]{.mark}**" direct democratic [[forms]{.mark}
of]{.underline} territorial (or "community") [control by the proletariat
and oppressed people [that **gradually supplant**]{.mark}]{.underline}
bourgeois **[[power]{.underline}]{.mark}** without having to launch an
all-out offensive aimed at the seizure of power---in other words, eating
away at bourgeois rule **[[without ever having to]{.mark} decisively
[overthrow]{.mark} it]{.underline}**.

This line of thinking has been called the "termite theory of revolution"
by David Harvey and "**[[Pac-Man politics]{.underline}]{.mark}**" by
kites (the analogy [refers to how]{.underline} Pac-Man eats one pellet
at a time while traveling back and forth within a maze, just like how
[[Leftists believe you can eat away]{.mark} at bourgeois rule **[one
piece at a time]{.mark}** while **never escaping** the narrow horizons
of bourgeois society]{.underline}).1 In decades past, it would have been
called syndicalism and been associated with anarchist philosophy and
politics. A particularly bewildering aspect of this line of thinking
today is that, post-Occupy Wall Street, [many who **call themselves
communists**]{.underline} or Maoists [are **beholden** to its logic even
if they **claim** to uphold the dictatorship of the proletariat and
Lenin's teachings]{.underline} on the nature of state power and the need
for revolution. Furthermore, [these would-be communists seem
**blissfully unaware**]{.underline} of the fact that their principal
forms of practice (passing out free food and doing community gardens)
are exactly what anarchists were doing (and usually doing better) back
in the 1990s.

One of the difficulties contending with Pac-Man politics is that it has
become such entrenched conventional wisdom over the last decade without
much written or theoretical articulation, especially by people claiming
to be communists. To make matters more confusing, **[Lenin's The State
and Revolution]{.underline}** (1917), one of the essential MLM
"classics" for contending with illusions about state power such as
Pac-Man politics, [has attained]{.underline} a renewed
[popularity]{.underline} among today's would-be communists [but without
the rejection of Pac-Man politics that should flow from studying
it]{.underline}. There are likely two reasons for this impasse. One,
[the **performative nature** of politics]{.underline} under the
domination of postmodernism [makes]{.underline} [Lenin's]{.underline}
The State and [Revolution a helpful tool for **proclaiming one's
superiority** to]{.underline}
"**[lib]{.underline}**eral**[s]{.underline}**" and their illusions in
the Democratic Party, and unfortunately, most people reading it today do
not seem to be taking much else from it. Two, since The State and
Revolution was written prior to the establishment of the Soviet Union
and Lenin's confrontation with the real contradictions involved in
exercising the dictatorship of the proletariat, [Lenin tends to present
an **overly simplistic view** of proletarian dictatorship]{.underline}
as a matter of administration, armed workers, [and]{.underline} direct
rule of the proletariat. What Lenin [had not yet
confronted]{.underline}, due to lack of historical experience, was [the
persistence of class struggle]{.underline} during the socialist
transition, not just against the overthrown bourgeoisie but also against
new bourgeois elements generated from [**within** socialist
society]{.underline}, and the continued necessity for the leadership of
the communist vanguard party all throughout the socialist transition
period.

Lenin was a smart cookie, of course, and had some sense of these
contradictions prior to the October Revolution, which he subsequently
deepened. His writings in the early years of the Soviet Union, notably
"Left-Wing" Communism: An Infantile Disorder (1920), display a keen
awareness of the continued strength, resources, and international
connections of the overthrown bourgeoisie, the ways in which the
persistence of small-scale production under socialism generates
petty-bourgeois elements and outlooks, and the need to purge the
vanguard party of careerist and petty-bourgeois elements who jumped on
board during the high tide of revolutionary struggle but who never
really became communists. But it would have to wait until after the
establishment of the People's Republic of China for Mao Zedong to more
fully theorize the intense class struggle in the socialist transition
period, how a new bourgeoisie was generated within the communist
vanguard, especially "capitalist roaders" in its leading levels, and the
methods for exposing and defeating capitalist roaders and bringing the
masses more deeply into the the process of ruling and transforming
society---namely the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This is the
principal reason why to be a communist in the present day, you cannot
stop at Lenin's teachings on the state; you must also study the
historical experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat and
especially Mao's teachings on the class struggle under socialism.

Getting more deeply into the contradictions of the socialist transition
period, however, will have to wait until later. For what is urgently
required on the part of all those who strive for revolution is a
decisive rupture with the Pac-Man politics that have come to dominate in
North America and, unfortunately, also in other parts of the world.
Towards that end, in what follows, I will dig into a few variations of
Pac-Man politics, starting with the "Maoist" version, moving to the
electoral version, and then addressing two specific (and thankfully well
theorized) articulations of Pac-Man politics. Finally, I will consider
how the lack of socialist states, the weakness of the international
communist movement, and the pull of alternative models in Latin America
and Rojava have bolstered Pac-Man politics.

We at kites have, for the most part, avoided identifying or "calling
out" the organizations and individuals associated with political lines
that we polemicize against. This in part flows from an important
principle advocated by the Committee of the Revolutionary
Internationalist Movement (CoRIM) in the debates over the road forward
in the people's war in Peru after Chairman Gonzalo's capture: line, not
author, is decisive. In today's social media culture, this principle is
all the more important given the way that so [many **[so-called
communists]{.mark}**]{.underline} and Leftists [[fixate on
**catching**]{.mark} **the**]{.underline}
"**[[impurity]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [of their rivals'
thoughts]{.underline}, usually by digging up old internet posts.
Inevitably, however, in order [to **clarify crucial
questions**]{.underline} of political and ideological line, [naming and
critiquing **specific articulations** of opposing lines becomes
necessary]{.underline}. In this writing, Kali Akuno's theorization of
building co-ops and assemblies in Jackson, Mississippi, Counterpower's
notion of "direct transition to communism," Abdullah Öcalan's democratic
confederalism, and theories about dual power in Venezuela articulated by
George Ciccarriello-Maher and Marta Harnecker will be critiqued as
examples of Pac-Man politics. These are all theorists (and in the case
of Öcalan and Akuno, revolutionary leaders) I have considerable respect
for and appreciate for putting in the effort (in Öcalan's case from a
prison cell) to seriously and honestly articulate their viewpoints (and
I wish more people would do the same). If my critique comes off as
harsh, that harshness should be understood as being directed against the
line, not the authors, and done because of the stakes involved. This
latter point goes to the question of what political lines are:
conceptions and politics that lead in definite directions in practice
and thus have serious ramifications on the practical struggle to change
the world, as distinguished from book worship, social media posturing,
or politics as personal morality.

Pac-Man "Maoists" and Their "Base Areas"

The "Maoist"2 version of [[Pac-Man politics]{.underline}]{.mark},
loosely articulated by a variety of organizations and individuals,
appropriates the language of base areas, the mass line, and mass
organizations to [describe politics and practice that
[are]{.mark}]{.underline}, at best, [**[wishful thinking]{.mark}** and
**always divorced** from the proletariat]{.underline}. Their rationale
goes something like this: [[we'll **pass out free
food**]{.underline}]{.mark} to people [[and **create community
gardens**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[the masses]{.mark} [will]{.mark}
**come to [trust us]{.mark}** through this]{.underline}, [the masses
themselves will **take up** the food distribution and
gardening]{.underline}, [the bourgeois state will **eventually attack**
these efforts]{.underline}...[with then some **vague ideas** about the
masses [**rising in defense** and carving out]{.mark} **local political
[power]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Sometimes notions of tenant organizing
are added to the mix that are at bottom the same old NGO-activist
tactics dressed up in Maoist language. Notably, [the forms of political
practice always center on some form of [essentially]{.mark}]{.underline}
"**[[red charity]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [and **[never social
investigation]{.mark}** to get to know the masses and agitation to
expose the system and advocate for revolution among the
masses]{.underline}. The struggle that will lead to the establishment of
local power is always presented defensively, as a response to attack by
the bourgeois state. And [the notion of class struggle]{.underline} to
bind the masses together, fight the enemy, and develop their organized
strength [is]{.underline}, **[at best]{.underline}**, [**vague** and in
the **imaginary future**]{.underline}, [if not **absent
altogether**]{.underline}.

Perhaps [the worst aspect]{.underline} of "Maoist" Pac-Man politics [is
the **grandiosity** of the claims and the **selfassuredness** of the
schemes]{.underline}. Those advocating and carrying out this "strategy"
seem overconfident in the inevitability of its success and wholly
uncritical of its abundant failures over the last several years (I guess
they never read the chapter on criticism and self-criticism in Mao's Red
Book). [[They]{.mark} go so far as to [talk about
establishing]{.mark}]{.underline} "**[[base
areas]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [of red political power [in the]{.mark}
**contemporary [U]{.mark}nited [St]{.mark}ates**]{.underline}. [We might
call this attitude **schematism**]{.underline}: [**[arrogantly putting
forward]{.mark} grand [plans]{.mark}** [based on]{.mark} **little** to
**[no experience]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [**no consideration**
of]{.underline}]{.mark} [what **[previous]{.mark}**]{.underline} (and
even recent) [**[generations]{.mark}** have tried]{.underline},
[[**little analysis** of the **actual contradictions**]{.mark} in
society that must inform revolutionary strategy]{.underline},
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}, worst of all, [**[no substantive political
contact]{.mark}** with the masses and consideration of what will **move
them forward** in revolutionary struggle based on interaction with
them]{.underline}. [[These]{.mark} grandiose schemes co-exist with a
**pervasive localism** that [can **only** conceive of]{.mark} political
activity and [power in the **most narrow**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
**[local ways]{.underline}**, [as if the masses confront only their
**landlords**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [their **bosses**]{.underline}, [and
**local cops** [rather than the]{.mark} machinations of global capital
that is the **[larger driving force]{.mark}** behind their
oppression]{.underline}. Consequently, Pac-Man "Maoists" cannot conceive
of, let alone lead, class struggles that cut across geographical
locations. As is so often the case with people pretending to be
revolutionaries, two seemingly contradictory poles, in this case
schematism and localism, are in fact the opposite ends of the same
stupidity, to borrow a phrase from Lenin, and the bold talk of building
base areas is what unites them.

1.5.3 Capitalism with a Lower Case 'c'

Gibson-Graham's central argument is that [[Marxists]{.mark} have
[**inadvertently** strengthen]{.mark}ed [capitalism by producing a
**discourse**]{.mark} that presents it [as]{.mark} an]{.underline}
absolute, all encompassing, [**[inescapable]{.mark}**
phenomenon]{.underline} - [or Capitalism with a **capital
'C'**]{.underline}. In so doing, the argument goes, Marxists have
engendered a situation where the only perceivable alternative to
capitalism is a complete and total working-class revolution. The entire
social system of the world must be replaced by a whole new system. [The
problem with this understanding of capitalism is that in light of the
failure and fall of many of the world's communist
governments]{.underline}, [[the working class **revolution**]{.mark}
seems like [an **impossible dream**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In turn,
Marxists]{.underline} of all stripes [have been [rendered]{.mark}
frustrated and [**empty handed** in terms of
**'solutions'**]{.mark}]{.underline}. "[It is [the way **capitalism**
has been **'thought'**]{.mark}]{.underline}", Gibson-Graham writes,
"[that [make it **so difficult** for people to imagine its
**supersession**]{.mark}]{.underline}" (1996, pp 4.)

Gibson-Graham deconstructs the radical political economy discourse on
capitalism to show that capitalism is not actually all encompassing and
that non-capitalist modes of production 27 and consumption occur all the
time, all over the place, right alongside capitalism. They effectively
argue for seeing the economic field of society as a differentiated
plane, with multiple types of economic relations coexisting. When one
views the situation thus, it becomes clear that a complete and total
working-class revolution is not the only viable option for bringing
about positive change. One can instead focus on the small day-to-day
projects that offer immediate realizations of the benefits of
capitalism's alternatives.

At the center of their deconstruction is their understanding of Marx's
definition of capitalism. Marx defined capitalism as a system of
production and consumption wherein the means of production are
controlled by an owning class while the production itself is provided by
a laboring class. The value of the work the labors provide is more than
they are paid for, which allows the owning class to syphon-off surplus
value in the form of profit. It is the appropriation of surplus value
(i.e., capital accumulation) by one entity away from another that
constitutes exploitation and defines capitalism. Gibson-Graham
demonstrates instances where this type of exploitation is not occurring:
self-employment (where surplus value is appropriated by the laborer);
cooperative businesses (where surplus value is appropriated by
employee-owners, consumer-owners, and reinvested into the community);
and household production (where labor is never transformed into its
monetary value form, thus providing no surplus to be appropriated).
Gibson-Graham also bring to light the fluidity of economic identities,
showing how an individual can be both an exploited laborer at their day
job, for example, but an appropriator of surplus value through the
investment of their retirements funds in the stock market. "Economic
sites that have usually been seen as homogenously capitalist,"
Gibson-Graham explains, "may be reenvisioned as sites of economic
difference, where a variety of capitalist and non-capitalist class
processes interact" (1996, p. 18). 28

Similar approaches to studying alternatives to capitalism include work
on moral economies (Scott, 1977), Buddhist economics (Schumacher, 1973),
and sharing (Gold, 2004). In sum, alternatives to capitalism can be
viewed as those processes of production and consumption of goods and
services--- and the social-ecological relations the processes
intimate---wherein the driving force is not the maximization of capital
accumulation by an elite class of owners, but rather the maximization of
social-ecological well-being through an equitable distribution of the
products of human labor.

Pulling away from Gibson-Graham and returning the purposes of this
dissertation, an important question emerges. If capitalism's
alternatives are still predicated on the production of surplus value
through the exploitation of labor (humans) and raw materials (non-human
environments), do these modes of economy offer any real promise for
remedying the social and environmental impacts of capitalism and thereby
contributing to the of resilience of Indigenous communities in the
Arctic? On the social front, it is relatively straight forward to see
how alternative modes of production/consumption and distribution enhance
social justice and equity--- surplus value is distributed equitably
among many rather than horded by a few. Similarly, on the environmental
side, we know that communally owned natural resources can be sustainably
managed (Ostrom, 1990). By replacing profit maximization with equitable
well-being as the key driver of economies (Figure 1.4), alternatives to
capitalism make room for decisions that are more ecologically sound than
those determined by capitalist logic. 29

1.5.4 Resilience and Capitalism: Reconsidering the Relationship

Resilience thinking, I contend, is a site of economic differentiation
because its application supports both capitalist and non-capitalist
modes of production and consumption. Radical political economists have
critiqued it as a homogenously capitalist project, but the evidence
suggests otherwise. Take for example the previously mentioned Arctic
Resilience Report. Although still in draft form, much of the report
appears to be a manifestation of neoliberal logic aimed at bringing new
places into capitalist modes of production. A table on page 75, for
example, summarizes the risks and opportunities for arctic investment as
defined by Lloyds Bank. In contrast, other parts of the report are
explicitly critical of capitalism, such as the case study of Norwegian
reindeer herders that identifies the "imposition of global market
capitalism" (p. 32) as a key factor in eroding Indigenous knowledge.
Consider also the recent article on arctic stewardship cited earlier
(Chapin et al., 2015). A quote from Pope Francis opens the article and
addresses the globe's growing economic disparities, the defenselessness
of nature to increased profits, and the problems of a "deified market"
(p. 207). These resilience thinkers recognize the link between
capitalism, ecological degradation, and social inequity.

Resilience thinking may be predominately friendly to capitalism, but it
is not completely so. It may be more accurate to say that resilience
thinking, as a whole, is conflicted about its stance on capitalism. Thus
[we [must **avoid** the **pitfall**]{.mark}]{.underline} Gibson-Graham
showed [Marxists]{.underline} to [have fallen into]{.underline}. [We
[need not **replace**]{.mark} resilience in toto [with **another
concept**]{.mark}, [but instead work to grow]{.mark} the
**non**-**capitalist** [options that **exist within**]{.mark} resilience
**[thinking currently]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [To do this, resilience
thinking needs to integrate concepts from radical political
economy]{.underline}. [This will [help]{.mark} resilience [thinkers
understand]{.mark} more clearly than they currently do capitalisms
[**implications** and **alternatives**]{.mark}, [how capitalism
**interacts** with **non**-**capitalist** modes]{.mark} of production
and consumption, and what this means for applying resilience thinking
[in **specific locations**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

4\. Analysis and discussion: Problematising discursive practices in
degrowth strategising

4.1. Building a comprehensive coalition of social forces: Non-compromise
versus hegemony, or community without society?

As Buch-Hansen (2018, 159) notes, "[Political projects do not become
hegemonic just because they embody good ideas]{.underline}", and "while
[degrowth]{.underline}, as a social movement, has been gaining momentum
for some time", it [is "**nowhere near** enjoying the degree and type of
**support** it needs if its **policies** are to be **implemented**
through democratic processes]{.underline}". On one hand, he points to
[the continued **dominance** of **pro-growth discourses** in political
**parties**, labour **unions**, **business** associations, and
international **organizations**]{.underline}. On the other hand, he
emphasises that "[advocates of degrowth **do not** possess
**instruments** that enable them to **force** political
**decision-makers** to listen to -- let alone **comply** with -- their
views]{.underline}" (ibid., 161). The latter results among others from
the particular character of the [**degrowth** project]{.underline},
which [is "**ideationally driven** in the sense that support for it is
not so much rooted in the material circumstances or short-term
self-interests of specific groups or classes as it is rooted in the
conviction that degrowth is **necessary** if current and **future
generations** across the globe are to be able to lead a good
life]{.underline}" (ibid.). We return to material interests of specific
groups in Section 4.2, but before that focus on another element
concerning the ability to build comprehensive coalitions of social
forces: (un)desired forms of cooperation.

Here, the case study points to [discursive practices]{.underline} that
[**explicitly** consider cooperation desirable **only** with actors who
**share** similar (**degrowth**) **values**]{.underline}:

> care about in degrowth and nourishes dynamics that make **every
> degrowther** feel **included**, we need to be more intentional in our

[An assumption that seems to **underpin** these discursive practices is
that cooperation is primarily an act within **like**-**minded
communities**, based on "personal relationship-building]{.underline}"
(Mailhot and Perkins, 2022, 153) [and shared values]{.underline}. As
such, it is an articulation of social homophily, defined as the tendency
of individuals to interact primarily with people who are similar to
them, who share similar values. [This is understandable as it helps
avoiding **less radical compromises**, making consensual
**decision-making**]{.underline}2 **[possible]{.underline}**:

In other words, [it is important that taming does not become a less
radical compromise in the struggle for transformation]{.underline}
(Chertkovskaya, 2022, 64).

I add a warning to think critically when applying the conceptual
vocabulary of evaluation that is prominent in contemporary strategising.
(...) While calculations of efficiency and effectiveness may, for
example, favour a group vote followed by action on the majority
decision, such procedures could jeopardise opportunities to build
consensus amid long hours of listening to, thinking about, and
experimenting with deeply different visions and approaches (Paulson,
2022, 187).

While there is an awareness in the broader degrowth-strategy discourse
that [**compromise** is **necessary** and]{.underline} that [the search
for consensus via deliberative and direct democratic means can enrich
but not replace representative democracy]{.underline} (e.g., Koch,
2022), there is also a tendency to assume that the core of democracy
consists in building and strengthening like-minded communities willing
to find consensus without (less radical) compromise. Following this line
of reasoning, [democratic agency must]{.underline} "[resonate
**directly** with **social movement demands**, rather than
**representatives**]{.underline}" (Petridis, 2022, 166). Democracy
becomes a method of governance in societal niches with shared values.
This might be praised or criticised as prefigurative agency exploring
innovative forms of conviviality but becomes problematic in the current
conjuncture in which liberal democracy -- which has severe weaknesses,
to be sure -- is increasingly delegitimised by the far right (Eatwell
and Goodwin, 2018; Scheiring, 2022).

In such a conjuncture, [disdain for democratic forms that go beyond
consensus building among like-minded people fails to acknowledge the
achievements of representative democracy]{.underline}. As such, [it
underestimates the danger of "reconstituting **authoritarian** political
relations by way of introducing a political system **supposedly** based
on **grassroots democracy**]{.underline}" (Brand and Heigl, 2011, 247
reiterating Poulantzas). In our current historical moment, there is much
to suggest that a (direct) 'grassroot democracy' would rather be
dominated by those campaigning "for anti-democratic, anti-egalitarian,
and anti-ecological 'alternatives'" (Blühdorn, 2022, 580) than by
advocates of degrowth values. [Assuming that the core of democracy
consists in building like-minded and consensus-based communities not
only disregards the value of representation]{.underline} (see Hodgson,
2021, 202--204) [but also tends to confuse grassroot democracy with
progressive movements]{.underline}. [Moreover, it impedes **strategic
agency** to build **cross**-**class** and **cross**-**milieu
alliances**]{.underline}. It tends to build eco-social communities, not
an eco-social society.

[In a society, strangers and opponents -- people who think and live
differently, who might neither like each other nor share degrowth values
-- must live together peacefully]{.underline}. [This requires a polity
with rules for dealing with unavoidable conflicts between sectional
interests. And it requires non-personal forms of solidarity]{.underline}
(see Durkheim, 2013 on "organic solidarity") as well as forms of
collective action based on non-personal relations, including political
representation. [While collective action is already challenging within
like-minded communities, its complexity increases in pluralist
societies, where different values, convictions, interests, and
lifestyles co-exist. Diverging values lead to socio-cultural cleavages,
e.g., with respect to religion, family, and gender; diverging interests
lead to politico-economic cleavages, e.g., with respect to labour
markets, migration, taxation, and welfare institutions]{.underline}.
[Given these fragmentations, accepted rules must emerge out of less
radical compromises]{.underline}.

### Alt---AT: Dual Power---2AC/1AR

#### Dual power strategies [fail]{.underline}, don't [spill up]{.underline}, and disavow [essential]{.underline} elements of resistance. 

**Lütticken, 21**---teaches art history at the Vrije Universiteit
Amsterdam (Sven, "Divergent States of Emergence: Remarks on Potential
Possibilities, Against All Odds," e-flux #115, February 2021, dml)

[This situation **complicates** progressive notions of **[dual
power]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In Murray Bookchin's definition,
[dual power]{.underline} [[is "a strategy]{.mark} for creating precisely
those libertarian institutions of directly democratic assemblies [that
would **oppose and replace** the State]{.mark}.]{.underline} It [intends
to create a situation in which the two powers]{.underline}---[the
**municipal confederations** and the
**nation-state**]{.underline}---**[cannot coexist]{.underline}**, and
one must sooner or later displace the other." Here, then, [the state is
the power to be **opposed** and ultimately **replaced**]{.underline};
however, [[the second step has proven a]{.mark} **rather [big
hurdle]{.mark}**]{.underline}---and [at the moment]{.underline}, [[under
the **right-wing onslaught**]{.underline}, [it is
often]{.underline}]{.mark} [a matter of **[defending the]{.mark} state's
[institutions]{.mark}** even [while **building**]{.mark} **up**
popular]{.underline}, [assemblist [power]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Dual power is often discussed with reference to **Rojava** or
**Chiapas**]{.underline}, the [**Zone à Défendre** near
**Nantes**]{.underline} in France, [and]{.underline} various
[**temporary [autonomous zones]{.mark}** that]{.underline} emerge from
urban confrontations. Emancipatory "liberated zones" carved out of the
territory of the globalist empire are attempts to build up bases within
the heartlands of empire. In the wake of May '68, movements such as the
Dutch Kabouters and the German Spontis [attempted to create
**counterpower from below** by creating forms of **self-organization**
and **self-government**]{.underline}. [Their spectacular and mediatized
exploits]{.underline}---the Kabouters' declaration of Amsterdam as an
"Orange Free State," as in "free from the House of Orange," or the
Spontis' squatting and urban warfare in Frankfurt---[[proved]{.mark}
**predictably [short-lived]{.mark}** under the conditions of **actually
existing capitalism**]{.underline}, but for decades autonomists have
been creating [**pockets** and **[zones of
opacity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Such desertions, however, [**[should not
be fetishized]{.mark}** and **identified** with counterpower as
such]{.underline}. [They have their **necessary counterpoint** in
**activist uses** of the infrastructure of the **state** and of the
**legal forms** that structure]{.underline} relations in the decomposing
states of [capitalism]{.underline}.

Even while Agamben is busy discrediting himself, there may be residual
use-value in (a critical reading of) his writings on destituent power
and inoperativity---specifically, in his insistence on opening existing
forms of work and activity to "a new possible use." In other words, it
is not so much about a creatio ex nihilo as it is about adaptation,
modification, through habits. An example is a feast, where eating is not
primarily about feeding oneself, and where dance liberates the body from
"utilitarian movements," instead unfolding "gestures in their pure
inoperativity." Building on but [going **beyond**]{.underline} the
concept of "**[destituent power]{.underline}**" as developed by the
Argentinian autonomist left, where it referred to inchoate and
disruptive popular power preceding the constituent moment, Agamben
refuses to posit a linear sequence of
destituting--constituting--constituted power. He advocates a habitual
use of the power to not-be or not-do, against the sovereign ban and its
instrumentalism: a new "ontology of potentiality" needs to replace "the
ontology founded on the primacy of actuality," and this means exploring
forms of destituent power that resist being captured and constituted.
[[This points **beyond**]{.underline}]{.mark} Agamben's own rather
[**abstract [calls]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} a]{.underline}
"**[[renunciation]{.mark} of the law]{.underline}**" as "a form and a
way of life," and [[to a]{.mark}n immanent [desertion that]{.mark}
**uses the [rights-form]{.mark}** against the state of
exception]{.underline}.

[[These may be the **master's tools**]{.underline}]{.mark} ([the tools
of **[sovereignty]{.mark}**]{.underline}), [but [**rather** than]{.mark}
thinking of renunciation as [a]{.mark} **single dramatic
[gesture]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [it [should be reconceptualized
in]{.mark} terms of **long** and **patient work** with the **[legal
form]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[including the forms of]{.underline}
cultural and **[political institutions]{.underline}**, [[such as
**parties** and **parliament**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Forms have
affordances and limitations. A decentralized network to which David
Graeber belonged found out that it was legally impossible for them to
collectively own a car. However, depending on **[national legal
[frameworks]{.mark}]{.underline}**, forms such as cooperatives [may
[provide]{.mark} means]{.underline} for an immanent opting-out. Fernando
Garcia-Dory's INLAND cooperative would be one example that is of
particular interest for the connections---the smooth space---it
establishes between the metropolis and the agricultural Hinterland.
Meanwhile, official trials are offset by activist tribunals [that **use
legal [protocols against the state]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and groups of
refugees and "illegals" who are only physically (grosstopically) in the
same space as Western cultural workers, but not legally, use cultural
spaces to break through into visibility.

The [**[renunciation]{.mark}** of the law]{.underline} thus [[leads
to]{.mark} **deeper immersion** that may be a **higher form of
[desertion]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In practical terms, [this ranges from
[work with **refugees**]{.mark} to]{.underline} challenging the
organizational structure and modus operandi of museums, from [creating
**cooperatives** to joining **[unions]{.mark}** to creating
**[parties]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [and]{.underline}]{.mark} indeed [to
[carving out spaces]{.mark} **between** and **against known legal
forms**]{.underline}. [At stake is]{.underline} indeed "[the **care of
the possible**]{.underline}." [Emergence may [take on **unspectacular
forms**]{.mark}]{.underline}, barely perceptible---[a **slight
shift**]{.underline}, [an **undercommoning of institutional
structures**]{.underline}, [an **unforeseen use**]{.underline}, [a
**[covert abuse of dominant forms]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### Alt---AT: General Strike---2AC/1AR

#### General strikes are [utopian]{.underline}, [empirically impotent]{.underline}, and get [cracked down on]{.underline}.

**Nowak and Gallas, 14**---PhD in political science AND Assistant
Professor in the Department of Political Science, University of Kassel
(Jörg and Alexander, "Mass Strikes Against Austerity in Western Europe
-- A Strategic Assessment," Global Labour Journal, Vol. 5, No. 3, dml)

[The frequency of general strikes]{.underline} during the crisis years
[**surpasses** anything seen post-1980]{.underline}: the number of
general strikes in the EU-15 plus Norway was 18 between 1980 and 1989,
26 from 1990 to 1999 and 27 between 2000 and 2009 (Hamann et al., 2013).
In contrast, [there were **38** general strikes in the period between
2010 and May 2014]{.underline} (own count). The focus of this strike
wave is in the five countries with the highest incidence of general
strikes since 1980, which are all severely affected by the Eurozone
crisis: 19 of these 38 strikes were in Greece, six in Italy, five in
Portugal, four in Spain and three in France. In Belgium, there was one
general strike in January 2012, the first one since 1984 (ibid.).

[But this [increase in]{.mark} the incidence of [general strikes is **no
reason for optimism**]{.mark}]{.underline} on the side of labour: [The
context]{.underline} of the wave of general strikes [is a **long-term
decline** of the **relevance** of]{.underline} economic
[strikes]{.underline} in the same countries. While the average number of
strike days per year had been 16.6 per 10,000 employees in 1980-2 for
the EU-15 plus Norway, it fell continuously to 1.1 in 2004-6 (Hamann et
al., 2013). The strike activity also fell if we consider the share of
workers (out of 1,000) on strike: In Western Europe, it plunged from 97
in the 1970s to 67 in the 1980s and 29 in the 1990s (Scheuer, 2006:
148f). In the 2000s, the number went down again, this time to 21
(European Commission, 2011: 46; Vandaele, 2011: 29). In other words,
[unions were **increasingly unable** to organise sectoral
strikes]{.underline}, which can be explained with the restructuring of
work and labour relations in the neoliberal era and its results: the
overall decline of industries with a strong union presence; a secular
decline of union density; and the fact that many trade unions focussed
their strategies on (industrial) core workers, whose numbers also
decreased (Vandaele, 2011: 32f.).

The upsurge of general strikes is a consequence of the fact national
governments increasingly adopted neoliberal and austerity agendas:
welfare state retrenchment moved the terrain of struggle to the
political level. Governments curtailed social rights and workers rights,
as well as cutting public expenditure. This development gained traction
in the course of the global financial and economic crisis when
governments started to impose draconian austerity agendas in an
authoritarian fashion. This suggests that the increasing popularity of
political strikes and general strikes is due to the fact that
governments on the whole refused to negotiate with unions when they
adopted the politics of austerity.

[[While]{.mark} the [participation]{.mark} in general]{.underline} and
political [strikes since 2008 [was **spectacular**]{.mark}, [they
were]{.mark} on the whole **[unsuccessful]{.mark}**. There is [**not a
single case** of a government offering **substantial
concessions**]{.mark} after one of the general strikes since
2008]{.underline}. Similarly, [there were [**minor concessions** only in
**one** case]{.mark}]{.underline}, the general strike in Belgium in
January 2012. This in stark contrast to the period before 2008: Between
1980 and 2011, there were government concessions in 27 of 68 cases (40
per cent; substantial: 8, minor: 19) and no concessions in 41 of 68
cases (60 per cent) (Hamann et al., 2013). Post-2008, one and two day
[general strikes]{.underline} (and even the fighting strike in France in
2010) [were **ineffective** regarding material concessions]{.underline}.
In other words, [the class relations of forces in the crisis were
**unfavourable** to labour]{.underline}.

The Limits of Quantitative Analyses

Interpretations of the strike wave since 2008 diverge considerably.
Stefan Schmalz and Nico Weinmann argue that there is a trend towards
more irregular conflicts and more incoherence between countries compared
with the wave of mass strikes from 1968 to 1973 (Schmalz and Weinmann,
2013). Kurt Vandaele contends that there is an increasing convergence
between European countries, both in terms of the long term decline of
economic strikes (Vandaele, 2011) and the growing significance of
political mass strikes (Vandaele, 2013). Gregor Gall also sees a trend
towards convergence, which consists in the growing significance of
political mass strikes and the emergence of the public sector as the
centre of trade union activities (Gall, 2012).

Both Vandaele and Gall highlight that there are limits to quantitative
analyses as they have been conducted in the past 30 years, thus
questioning to some extent their own approaches. Vandaele implies that
if strike action takes place in the public sector, it is not primarily
at decreasing profits, but at disrupting everyday life through the
suspension of public services. In this context, the number of days not
worked, or of workers participating, are not the best indicators for the
strength of a stoppage because it is possible to block a service with a
small number of workers (Vandaele, 2011: 33). It follows that analyses
of labour activism should take on board qualitative factors in order to
grasp the full picture. Gall highlights other aspects when he discusses
the limits of quantitative approaches: Many political strikes in the
public sector and many general strikes are not counted in the official
statistics -- despite the fact that they have been a dominant form of
industrial action in Europe at least since the 2000s (Gall, 2012: 14f).
For Gall the decrease of strike activity is exaggerated if one operates
on the grounds of these numbers.

The limits of quantitative approaches are visible in Schmalz and
Weinmann's analysis, which draws its political conclusions almost
entirely from an evaluation of quantitative data about 'nonnormative
conflicts'. They state that trade unions exercise less control over
mobilizations than they did between 1968 and 1973 (Schmalz and Weinmann,
2013). It disappears from the picture that many of the big trade
union-led stoppages in the 1970s drew their momentum from wildcat
strikes (Birke, 2007: 218f, 274f.; Gallas and Nowak, 2013), which is not
the case for the current European strike wave, where union federations
predominantly instigate the action.1 Hamann et al. (2013) also work with
a quantitative approach, trying to detect patterns that explain under
which circumstances general strikes yield successful results. Since the
current strike wave is marked by the general absence of concessions,
this methodology is difficult to apply. In contrast, Gall's analysis
considers the political context of the European strike wave, explaining
its novelty by highlighting that unions are either excluded 'from the
process of political exchange' (Gall, 2012: 2) or that political
negotiations increasingly yield poor results for workers. Following him,
there has been an erosion of corporatism, which means that the political
strike became the primary means of struggle in France, Greece, Italy,
Spain and Portugal. According to Gall, this form of strike has strength
to it because it entails big political mobilizations as 'expression of
collective discontent against and contestation of neoliberal policies'
(Gall, 2012: 20).

A Luxemburgian Typology

In this section, we propose a qualitative account of mass strikes
inspired by Rosa Luxemburg. With regard to the recent wave of mass
strikes, we can show what type of industrial action we are examining,
and where its strategic limits lie. For this purpose, we develop a
typology of strikes based on a qualitative description with four axes.

LUXEMBURG'S UNDERSTANDING OF MASS STRIKES

While scholars tend to reflect on the political context of political
mass strikes and its strategic implications, they tend to neglect two
aspects: The strikes are defensive strikes, and they are, to a large
extent, without success, \-- despite the unprecedented size of the
mobilizations. Before we elaborate on these aspects, we will discuss the
concept of the 'mass strike', which is used by Gall and Vandaele without
providing a proper definition. We believe that Rosa Luxemburg's work
provides some insightful observations on mass strikes, which can be used
to determine the concept. These can be found in her text The Mass
Strike, the Political Parties and the Trade Unions, written in 1906,
after the strike wave that led up to the (failed) Russian revolution in
1905. Obviously, there is no revolutionary situation in contemporary
Europe (quite the contrary), but we believe that we can gain some
general insights from Luxemburg by isolating her observations from their
historical context.

She does not confine the concept of 'mass strike' to political strikes
and highlights that purely economic strikes sometimes very quickly get a
political dimension. One of her examples is a stoppage in the railway
repair workshops in Kiev in July 1903. The strike movement grew after
the police arrested two delegates of the railway workers. The subsequent
blockade of the local railway station led to a police massacre with more
than 30 dead workers. On the next day, a general strike started in all
parts of Kiev. Inspired by these events, there was a general strike in
Jekaterinoslaw in early August 1903 (Luxemburg, 1906/2008: 125). The
famous strike in Petersburg in January 1905 exhibits a similar dynamic:
Two workers were dismissed because of their membership in a legal
official workers' association. About one week later, 200,000 workers
attended a march to the castle of the Tsar in order to submit a
petition. A bloodbath followed, leaving between 200 and 1,000 workers
dead. This in turn paved the way for a wave of mass strikes that lasted
until the summer of that year, which led to the introduction of the
8-hour day in many sectors of the Russian economy (12 to 14 hours were
the standard before the events) and to wage increases of around 15 per
cent all over the country (Luxemburg, 1906/2008: 127f).

But Luxemburg underlines differences as well: While the strikes in 1903
started as sectoral, economic strikes and became political conflicts in
their final phase, the mass strikes in 1905 reversed the pattern: they
started with a unified political programme and led to many partial and
independently organized economic strikes all over Russia. This
distinction is not just of historical importance, but pertains to a
central feature of Luxemburg's understanding of mass strikes: The mass
strike does not exhibit a unified pattern and cannot be identified ahead
of its unfolding in a concrete struggle: 'Its adaptability, its
efficiency, the factors of its origin are constantly changing'
(Luxemburg, 1906/2008: 140). It is only possible ex post to chart mass
strikes in a given conjuncture. But there are some defining features,
which we can extract from Luxemburg's account of the events in Russia:
First of all, they disrupt political life, affect public discourse and
provoke massive responses from governments or other state bodies
(Luxemburg, 1906/2008: 140f). A second central aspect is the mobilizing
character of mass strikes for the working class: Workers experience the
power that goes along with collective action, gain experience in
political struggles and see the need for organization. Importantly,
these are qualitative features: the mass strike is not defined on the
grounds of simple numbers (be they absolute numbers of participants or
working days lost or relative numbers compared to the size of the
population), but in terms of its effects, both on the political scene
and the working class. In this sense, the 1984-5 Miners' Strike in
Britain can be seen as a mass strike (even though it was confined to one
industry); in contrast, the public sector strikes in Germany in 1992 and
2006 involving hundreds of thousands of workers are not necessarily mass
strikes, because they did not have persistent effects on the political
scene and their mobilizing character for the German working class was
limited.

Importantly and contrary to some readings of her work, Luxemburg does
not glorify the mass strike. She underlines that there are limits to its
effectiveness in the Russian context: While the first general strike in
January 1905 led to a national wave of economic strikes, and a second
national strike in October ended with political concessions of the Tsar,
the third general strike in December resulted in defeat: An armed
uprising of workers in response to state repression against the strike
in Moscow was crushed by the military, and efforts by the social
democrats to organize a fourth national strike in 1906 were not
successful (Luxemburg, 1906/2008: 139f.). Luxemburg concludes the
chapter with the following words: 'The role of the political mass strike
alone is exhausted, but, at the same time, the transition of the mass
strike into a general popular rising is not yet accomplished. (...) The
stage remains empty for the time being.' (Luxemburg, 1906/2008: 140).
This suggests that calls for mass strikes are only useful in specific
conjunctures, and that other forms of political and social action
prevail in other periods.

FOUR ANALYTICAL DISTINCTIONS

Against this backdrop, we propose a typology of the mass strike inspired
by Luxemburg's analysis (cf. Gallas and Nowak, 2012: 25f.). We use four
distinctions to describe the different types of the mass strike. These
distinctions are inspired by Luxemburg, who operated in a similar way
without providing a systematic conceptual elaboration. They are
analytical in character. Of course, the reality of a particular strike
is always messy and sometimes produces grey zones that complicate or
even defy categorization. But it is impossible to understand the causes,
dynamics and effects of strikes without the use of analytical
distinctions.

1\. The first distinction concerns the aims of strikes. It runs between
economic strikes that relate predominantly to the workplace, and
political strikes that address extra-economic issues. Economic strikes
address issues such as wages, layoffs and working conditions. One
example for a political strike is the fight for universal suffrage: the
labour movements in Belgium, Britain and Germany in the 19th and early
20th century demanded the vote not just through demonstrations, but also
by going on strike. Luxemburg emphasizes that political and economic
strikes constantly blend into each other (Luxemburg, 1906/2008: 144).

2\. The second distinction relates to the extension of strikes: there
are 'partial' strikes that affect just one sector of the economy
(sectoral strikes) or one particular region or city (local or regional
strikes), and general strikes that cut across sectors and are held at
the national level (for Luxemburg's use of the term 'partial', see
1906/2008: 142).

3\. The third distinction is about the direction of a strike movement:
Offensive strikes aim to reach a goal set by the strikers themselves
(that is, wage increases or the recognition of independent unions by the
state and employers), while defensive strikes try to block measures
proposed by the government or employers (that is, layoffs or cutbacks of
pensions) or are intended to defend rights such as universal suffrage or
freedom of the press (Luxemburg, 1906/2008: 119).

4\. The fourth distinctions reflects the form of strike: Demonstrative
strikes voice the opinion of workers and are limited to one or two days,
while fighting strikes are about striking until the goal of the stoppage
or a compromise has been reached, or until the workers decide to give in
(Luxemburg, 1906/2008: 143).

The vast majority of the mass strikes in Western Europe since 2008, on
the grounds of our typology, are political strikes because they are
directed against plans of the government to restrict rights and cut
social expenditure. Furthermore, they are defensive and general strikes.
Finally, they are usually demonstrative strikes limited to one or two
days.2 In a nutshell, the type of strike dominating the Western European
wave of mass strikes is the political, general, defensive and
demonstrative strike.

COUNTRY-SPECIFIC PATTERNS

Vandaele stresses that there are regional patterns of strike activity,
and he is grouping European countries into five categories according to
their different industrial relations regimes (Vandaele, 2011). For a
group of 'Southern' European countries -- France, Italy, Greece, Spain
and Portugal -- he describes a common pattern characterized by
'long-lasting employer hostility towards union recognition' (Vandaele,
2011: 16) and a weak institutionalization of collective bargaining.
Similarly, Gall argues that the political mass strike became the main
strike method in the same countries since the late 1990s, reflecting the
fact that the ties between social democratic parties and the union
movement have not been very close in these countries, given the huge
weight of communist trade unions (Gall, 2012: 20ff).

What is noteworthy is that the countries in question are also those
where the vast majority of political strikes against austerity happened
after 2008. So one could see this as a case of path dependency rather
than a new political dynamic. But there is still a much higher frequency
of these strikes since 2009. This suggests that two factors come
together: First, the countries already had an established tradition of
the political strike, which emerged in the late 1990s; and, second, the
countries are worst hit by the Eurozone crisis (with the exception of
France). Besides, there is a genuinely new development in that the
strike wave reaches countries that do not belong to this first group:
there were political strikes against austerity in the UK (which,
according to Vandaele, belong to a Western European group) and in
Belgium (which belongs to a Western-central European group). In the UK,
the strikes have so far been confined to the public sector, but there
are debates among the unions about the possibility of a genuine general
strike (Gallas and Nowak, 2012: 70ff) -- something that has not taken

Political Strikes Against Austerity as a Reflection of the Conjuncture

The type of strike that is prevailing in the Eurozone Crisis, the
defensive political strike, is both a reflection of a specific political
conjuncture and of class relations of forces unfavourable to labour. Two
aspects of this situation are important for debates on strategies: the
fact that the strikes have been unsuccessful to a large extent and the
fact that they are facing 'physical limits' in the form of violent state
repression.

Against this backdrop, it appears that many of the big trade unions in
the countries that are affected heavily by the crisis are halfway stuck
between organizing protests against austerity and attempts to keep
channels of negotiations open. This is changing slowly in some of the
countries, for example in Britain, Spain and in Portugal, where unions
are beginning to take a more confrontational stance vis-à-vis
governments. To illustrate the two aspects, we will take a closer look
at the strike against the pension cuts in France in October 2010, given
that they were most advanced form of protest against austerity: it went
against the dominant pattern insofar as the strike was not a
demonstrative strike limited to one or two days; in fact, it lasted for
about three weeks.

THE FRENCH STRIKE AGAINST PENSION CUTS

In spring 2010, the French government announced pension cuts. As a
reaction, a three-week general strike against pension cuts erupted in
October 2010, the main issue being the increase of the retirement age
from 60 to 62. Similar mobilizations in 1995 and 2006 had brought
substantial concessions (Lindvall, 2011). The strongholds of the 2010
strike were the refineries.

The strike was unsuccessful despite the fact that there was a broad
consensus among the main trade unions behind the strike and public
opinion was in favour: According to opinion polls, 60 to 70 percent of
the population supported it. Furthermore, participation in
demonstrations was high -- much higher than in 1968 and comparable to
1995 (1968: 500,000; in 2010, 2.5-3 millions on various occasions).
However, in 2010, the number of workers on strike was comparably low:
estimates run between 500,000 and 1,000,000. In 1968, nine million
workers were on strike, and in 1995, it was considerably more than one
million workers. (During the 2006 protest movement, there were no mass
strikes) (Gallas and Nowak, 2012: 56ff; USS, 2010).

In 2010, participation rates among important groups like railway workers
and students were low because these groups had just been defeated in
drawn-out conflicts that had taken place only a few months before the
strike. The main bases of the strike were the oil refineries, the ports,
and the public sector in the region of Marseille. Outside these main
bases, the strikers were very much dispersed across sectors and
workplaces, so that demonstrations became the focal points of the
mobilization. Obviously, these demonstrations did not have much of an
impact on the economy or the public infrastructure. The strikes in the
refineries, which led to a shortage of fuel, had not been organized
properly by the unions. As soon as the police and military arrived at
the scene, the strikers gave up blockading (Gallas and Nowak, 2012:
59ff).

Arguments between the main unions (CFDT - Confédération française
démocratique du travail and CGT - Confédération générale du travail)
resulted in a moderate strategy: When the fuel shortages led to problems
in the productive sector, the main unions distanced themselves from
blockading refineries and fuel stores. The main unions were not prepared
to start a proper confrontation with the Sarkozy government, because
they believed that the Socialist Party (PS) was not ready for a change
of government: The PS was divided on the issue of pensions and quarreled
about the party leadership. Sarkozy's strategy to refrain from offering
negotiations or concessions surprised the unions. It was a new pattern
of class politics in France.

The conditions of struggle throughout Europe had changed considerably
with the onset of the financial crisis, but the main unions in France
used the same old political strategies (Gallas and Nowak, 2012: 59ff):
they wanted to change public opinion. Furthermore, they banked on the PS
gaining the presidency in 2012 and repealing the restructuring of the
pensions system. Hollande was carried to office by the strike movement
but did not deliver on the demands of the strikers that he had included
in his agenda. His attempt to restore the status quo ante in the area of
pensions was half-hearted: the return to a lower pension age (60) will
only affect 110,000 people. The focus of the unions on a change of
government turned out to be a strategic mistake.

DEADLOCK

The French example reveals the deadlock that trade unions in many
European countries face in the crisis. [The]{.underline} old
[strategies]{.underline} of working with threats and blockades as well
as hoping for negotiations and changes of government [**do not appear to
work** any longer]{.underline}. The [political strikes]{.underline}
against austerity conform mostly to what Beverly Silver (2003: 20) calls
'Polanyi-type of labor unrest': they are struggles predominantly based
in sectors where layoffs, privatisations and restrictions of workers'
rights pose a threat to the existing labour force. This constellation of
struggle [produces **specific challenges** and **dilemmas**]{.underline}
for labour, which mean that [[winning is
**difficult**]{.underline}]{.mark}: [[If]{.mark} public sector
[workers]{.mark}]{.underline}, who were crucial for most of the
mobilisations in Europe, [[go on strike, the state **saves
money**]{.underline}. [The strikers can]{.underline}]{.mark} [make up
for this by **[interrupt]{.mark}ing**]{.underline} the economic and
social **[[infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}**, for example by
blockading public transport and roads, [[but this is **difficult to
sustain** and **creates tensions**]{.mark} with the infrastructure
users]{.underline}. Furthermore, [if workers are indeed **blockading key
sites** of the infrastructure or of production, [there is]{.mark} a
[**real danger** that the]{.mark} repressive [state]{.mark} apparatuses
[**break strikes with force**: this happened]{.mark}]{.underline} when
air traffic controllers struck [[in **Spain**]{.mark} in 2010,
[and]{.mark} also in **[France]{.mark}**]{.underline} in 2010 at the
refineries.

[Surely, the political [strikes]{.mark}]{.underline} against austerity
[[had a **mobilizing** character. But]{.mark} the fact that
unions]{.underline} in the crisis countries [on the whole **[did not
gain any concessions]{.mark}** -- [neither through **negotiations**
nor]{.mark} through [attempts to exert '**influence from
without**']{.mark}]{.underline} (Gall, 2012) -- [reveals that the
[working classes]{.mark}]{.underline} in these countries [generally
**[lacked any]{.mark}**]{.underline} sort of [**political
[leverage]{.mark}**, which goes **further** than just saying that we are
witnessing the '**end of social democracy** as a credible political
force']{.underline} (ibid.). [And [in]{.mark} those [cases where
workers]{.mark} were able to [**mount effective resistance** and **put
pressure**]{.mark} on governments, **[repressive]{.mark} state
[apparatuses intervened]{.mark}** on their behalf]{.underline}. How is
it possible to overcome this impasse? There are three possible ways: (1)
blockades are so widespread and massive that there are not enough
repressive forces available to effectively break them; (2) political
pressure is strong enough that the government withdraws from violent
intervention; or (3) labour activists develop new tactics that deal with
violence in one way or another. The first option of [an all-out
[blockade seems **utopian**, and it is **difficult** to build
**effective political pressure**]{.mark}]{.underline}. But the labour
[[movements]{.underline}]{.mark} across Europe [**cannot evade** the
question of **how** to build up effective pressure when faced with
governments **unprepared** to make concessions, but ready to **break
strikes with violent means**. If organized labour is not able to address
this question, 'the stage will **remain empty**']{.underline} for the
time being.

Strategic Lessons

Unions are faced with a dilemma in the European crisis. They find
themselves in a situation of weakness where it would be better to lay
low and gain strength first, but they are not controlling the conditions
under which they operate. They are under attack and cannot afford to
lose because this would have devastating consequences: unemployment and
impoverishment for the working [people]{.underline} in the crisis
countries and a seriously constrained room for manoeuvre for labour. In
this situation, they [tend to [resort to]{.mark} staging
**[symbolic]{.mark}** political [strikes]{.mark}, [which]{.mark} thus
[become the terrain for]{.mark} the **[reconstitution]{.mark}** for
working class movements]{.underline} across Europe. [The [strikes are
**supposed** to represent]{.mark} shows of [**strength**, but their
**results**]{.mark} in terms of concessions [are
**meagre**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other words,
[[governments]{.underline}]{.mark} across the Eurozone [[have **called
the bluff**]{.underline}]{.mark} of the trade unions [[by **choosing not
to move**]{.mark} in response to the strikes]{.underline}.

In this situation, unions have to rethink their strategies. But [[it is
**not enough** to]{.mark} simply [call for]{.mark}]{.underline} a
**[[radicalization]{.underline}]{.mark}** of trade unionism. [There are
reasons why unions resort to the **rather moderate means** of the
**symbolic political strike**]{.underline}. Thanks to the crisis, their
members are faced with the serious economic hardship caused by wage
cuts. Furthermore, they are under the threat of being laid off, and
finding a new job is very difficult under conditions of a deep economic
crisis. The 'silent compulsion of economic relations' (Marx, 1867: 899)
is further amplified through cuts in the welfare system, which make it
even harder to cope with unemployment. Finally, [it is **difficult** to
call for a radicalization [when people have **already been
defeated**]{.mark} at various occasions, [which has a **demoralizing
effect**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this situation, [[**simplistic calls**
for militant action have a ring of **radical
posturing**]{.underline}]{.mark}. As a result, the starting point of any
debate on union strategy should be on the existing pattern of struggle,
and how its elements can be recomposed to lead to a more forceful
result.

#### The aff's prescription for a "general strike" results in, at best, demoralizing failure 

**Cooper 17** \[Marc Cooper, American journalist, author, journalism
professor and blogger, Feb 12, 2017, "General Strike Generally Stupid,"
https://www.laprogressive.com/general-strike/\]

[In **all of American history** I do not believe there has ever been one
national general strike]{.underline}. In the early 20th century there
were a handful of successful LOCAL general strikes... I'm thinking of
Seattle in 1919 when somewhere around 65,000 workers went out for five
days. There were also some statewide longshoremen strikes in the days of
Harry Bridges.

[[Strikes]{.underline}]{.mark}, generally speaking, [[require]{.mark}
that little detail known as **[UNIONS]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [[The
percentage of]{.mark} American [workers]{.mark} currently
[unionized]{.mark} in the private sector [is]{.mark} at [an **all time
low of 6 percent**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Unionized government
workers are somewhere around 32 percent if you count cops and
firefighters (unlikely strikers).

[[A general strike]{.mark} in the U.S. [would mean]{.mark} the country
is on [the **precipice of regime change and revolution. We are
not**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} Further, [we live in a
country]{.underline} that, among Western democracies, **[provides the
least amount of worker protection]{.underline}**. Suggesting that non
union workers strike for a day is irresponsible as nobody is prepared
toto support them when fired. Most unionized workers labor under
contracts that have a "no strike" clause in them anyway.

[[Any successful strike]{.underline}]{.mark}, [even in ONE targeted
industry or shop [takes months]{.mark} and months [of]{.mark} very very
[hard organizing]{.mark}]{.underline}. There is no preparation or
organizing nor infrastructure to make this February 17 action anything
more than science fiction.

[[It]{.mark} also [suggests a recurring flaw in]{.mark} thinking among
America's "[progressive" community]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It is
what]{.underline} Prof. [Adolph Reed derides as [the "**spark
theory**]{.mark}]{.underline}"---[[that some EVENT]{.mark} like the
occupation]{.underline} of the Wisconsin capitol 6 years ago [or this
coming "strike" [is going to **magically and overnight trigger
a**]{.mark} **real social [movement]{.mark} for change**.
[Nope]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Social movements have to be built, painstakingly, by
activists,]{.underline} [organizers, leaders and rank and file.
Eng[a]{.mark}ging people [in fizzled events]{.mark} like this
ill-conceived nationals strike [only **demoralizes participants who
sense the failure**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

### Alt---AT: Planned Economy/Socialist Planning---2AC

#### Central planning [fails]{.underline}. [Markets]{.underline} and [profit motives]{.underline} are [essential]{.underline} for efficiency and productivity.

**Cope, 25**---Visiting Researcher at Queen's University Belfast (Zak,
"Geopolitics and Anti-Capitalism: Global Power Dynamics and Left
Economics," *The Palgrave Handbook of Contemporary Geopolitics*, Chapter
55, pp. 1125, dml)

While the labor theory of value suggests that labor hours can be used as
a unit of economic calculation for [[planning production under
socialism]{.underline}]{.mark}, this [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
ultimately **[[infeasible]{.underline}]{.mark}** for the following
reasons (Steele, 1992, pp. 147--177). First, as explained above, [market
[prices are influenced by supply and demand]{.mark} and often
**diverge** from labor values]{.underline}. [[Planning
production]{.mark} according to]{.underline} average prices based on
[labor hours would [lead to **inefficiency**]{.mark} by causing
surpluses or shortages]{.underline}. [For a planned economy to be
efficient]{.underline}, therefore, [it would have to **mimic market
responses**]{.underline}. Second, [measuring actual labor hours expended
is **useless** insofar as measured labor hours relate to the **past**
and are **always obsolete**]{.underline}. What matters is how much labor
should be allocated in the future, and not how much was allocated in the
past. [[Past labor expenditures **do not**]{.mark} **necessarily
[reflect]{.mark}** [future labor requirements]{.mark}]{.underline},
[which is **critical** for planning]{.underline}. [Planners would need
to know [socially]{.mark} [necessary labor hours]{.mark}
which]{.underline}, as noted, [[can **only** be determined
**indirectly**]{.mark} from **market prices**]{.underline}. [In a
centrally planned economy]{.underline} such as was the Soviet Union,
[[prices are set]{.mark} **[arbitrarily]{.mark}** by government
planners]{.underline}, [[resulting in **artificial competition**]{.mark}
between state-owned enterprises]{.underline} based on these artificial
prices. [Planners have **[no way of knowing]{.mark}** the real [profits
or losses]{.mark} of individual enterprises [since they **do not have
private ownership** of]{.mark} the means of
[production]{.mark}]{.underline} (Hazlitt, 1993a, p. 86). [Since
communist bureaucracies **lack proper price signals** to efficiently
allocate resources and plan production]{.underline}, [they
have]{.underline} instead [to make **[blind]{.mark} [guesses]{.mark}**
[about]{.mark} production [quotas and]{.mark} the]{.underline} right
[[proportions of]{.mark} different [goods]{.mark}]{.underline} to
produce. [[Without **market prices**]{.underline},
[socialist]{.underline}]{.mark} [manager[s]{.mark} [cannot engage in
economic calculation to determine]{.mark} the **most
[productive]{.mark}** amounts and types of [goods]{.mark} to
produce]{.underline}, [and [their]{.mark} production plans
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} therefore **[unbalanced]{.underline}**,
**[haphazard]{.underline}**, [and **[wasteful]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Moreover, [production methods are **uneconomical** under communism since
[there are **no profit incentives** to improve
efficiency]{.mark}]{.underline}, whereas, by contrast, [[free markets
**constantly improve**]{.mark} production methods [through
competition]{.mark}]{.underline} (Hazlitt, 1993b, pp. 132--137).

#### It [falls apart]{.underline} and kills [millions]{.underline} in the transition [alone]{.underline}.

Economics," *The Palgrave Handbook of Contemporary Geopolitics*, Chapter

For socialists, however, the only way to prevent the profound
immiseration and inequality that allegedly results from capitalism is
for free markets to be replaced by a planned economy that prioritizes
human need over private profit. Unfortunately, [[socialist planning does
**not** lead to higher productivity]{.underline}]{.mark}, [rising
[incomes]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[or]{.mark} greater personal [freedom
but]{.mark} to **[inefficiency]{.mark}**]{.underline},
**[[impoverishment]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[and]{.mark} **extreme
[repression]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [These [**profound flaws**
in]{.mark} socialist [planning are **inherent**]{.mark}]{.underline}; in
information technology terms, [they are a [**feature** of socialized
production]{.mark} and not a **bug**]{.underline}. [Without **residual
claimancy** by firms who might profit or lose based on
prices]{.underline}, [socialist [firms **cannot learn** how to minimize
costs]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In the **Soviet Union**]{.underline}, [this
[led to **soft** budget constraints where]{.mark}by [state-owned
enterprises]{.mark} were [able to **overspend**]{.mark} or **exceed**
their budget [without]{.mark} facing [immediate consequences]{.mark} or
penalties]{.underline}, [[and the economy **suffering**]{.mark} from
inefficiency]{.underline}, [shortages]{.underline},
[corruption]{.underline}, [and poor-quality goods]{.underline},
ultimately [[leading to]{.underline}]{.mark} its eventual
[**[collapse]{.mark}** and providing **abundant** and **tragic proof**
that the planned economy does not work in **practice**]{.underline}
(Boettke, 1990; Boettke & Candela, 2021; Brutzkus, \[1935\] 1982; Clark
& Wildavsky, 1990; Ebeling, 2021; Ellman, 1978; Harrison, 2017; Hoppe,
2011; Polanyi, 1940). Indeed, [the construction of [centrally
planned]{.mark} socialist [economies resulted in]{.mark} the [deaths
of]{.mark} **well [over 100 million]{.mark}** people in the last
century]{.underline} (Cope, 2022, p. 25), [killed
[by]{.mark}]{.underline} what has been called, variously,
[the]{.underline} "[**[military]{.mark}-feudal [exploitation]{.mark}**
[of the peasantry]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Bukharin, 1929),

[Critics]{.underline} such as Mazzucato [maintain that]{.underline},
while economic growth and social welfare is driven by innovation, [the
state must intervene to prevent private actors from **extracting too
much value** from their own innovations]{.underline}. This argument
relies on four important assumptions. First, Mazzucato sees value
extracted by private innovators as a rent, not a premium for their
efforts and investments. [In this perspective]{.underline},
[entrepreneurs]{.underline} are myopic and [must be **prodded** by the
**benevolent Leviathan** to take a]{.underline} "[patient]{.underline},"
[long-term perspective]{.underline}. Even using the Ricardian role of
rentiers as responsible of economic stagnation, [[the]{.mark} modern
[state is]{.mark} itself [a **rentier**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [a **much
larger one**]{.underline} than entrepreneurs or large firms and one
[[that bears **little risk**]{.underline}]{.mark} (unlike private
capital, taxpayers' money is always available). Moreover, [[the
claim]{.mark} that innovators appropriate too much value from
innovations with high social benefits [is **hard to square**
with]{.mark} the conventional notion that]{.underline}, [in the face of
**[positive spillovers]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [there is **too little
innovation** in R&D]{.underline} (Arrow, 1962)[!]{.underline}.

Second, [these criticisms view the state is **a priori entitled** to
appropriate]{.underline} a part (which? Half? 90%? 100%?) of the
innovation's [value because of its]{.underline} "**[dirty
job]{.underline}**." An example highlights the inconsistency of this
argument. Suppose a firm that produces mobile phones uses a natural
resource to create a specific component. The firm can buy the natural
resource and make the component in-house or buy from an outside
supplier. Either way, this process is facilitated by market
transactions, either in the market for the resource or the market for
the finished component. Assume the state owns the natural resource or
the supplier producing the component is a state-owned firm. In both
cases, the firm has paid a price to the state for its contribution to
innovation (i.e., owning the natural resource or contracting with the
supplier). An entrepreneur or group of [[entrepreneurs perform the
**central role**]{.mark} of combining resources and bearing]{.underline}
the [uncertainty]{.underline} associated with value creation (production
takes place before the product is offered and promoted to consumers, who
may or may not buy the product). Why should the state be entitled to a
share of the created value? A typical answer is that the entrepreneur is
leveraging prior investments, infrastructure, institutions, education,
etc. provided by the state. And yet, the entrepreneur, the
[investors]{.underline}, and other stakeholders [have **already
paid**]{.underline} for these, in the form of taxes, credit expansion,
or however else the state funds its expenditures. Why should the
innovator pay an additional "tax" on innovation?

Third, [critics argue that]{.underline}, [because of the
background]{.underline}, [public investments **allegedly**
underlying]{.underline} private [innovation]{.underline} projects, as
well as targeted innovation programs, [the downside risks of innovation
are partly socialized]{.underline}. Shouldn't the upside benefits be
socialized as well? [This]{.underline} argument [**begs the question**
of why the state should be financing innovation]{.underline},
[**displacing** private and more competent investors]{.underline}, [in
the **first place**]{.underline}. Fourth and [more
worrying]{.underline}, Mazzucato's [[entrepreneurial state is
**picking**]{.mark} **socially productive
[activities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The state has to engage in
mission-oriented policies and orient private investments towards
specific areas and industries **decided** and **identified** by the
government]{.underline}---the key message of Mazzucato when she was
consultant for the Italian government led by the populist Prime Minister
Conte.

In sum, [the purpose of the entrepreneurial state is [not just to
**shape**]{.mark} technologies]{.underline}, [[but]{.mark} also to
**[directly control]{.mark}**]{.underline}, **[create]{.underline}** and
shape new markets ([[and]{.mark} even **[destroy]{.mark}** markets and
businesses]{.underline} considered as unproductive by the Leviathan).
Mazzucato's work has mainly been influential in Europe, but there are
also increasing calls in the US for a more active role for government in
the tech sector. It is easy to see that this fits within the Great Reset
mélange.

A basic problem with [[these]{.mark} arguments]{.underline} is that they
[[fail to confront **incentive**]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
**[info]{.mark}rmation [problems]{.mark}** facing public actors that
have been familiar]{.underline} to economists in particular (but not
exclusively) [for **decades**]{.underline}. Public actors have
historically acted as monopolists in the provision of several products
and services and, [as a **rule**]{.underline}, [[government]{.mark}
decision maker[s]{.mark} [lack]{.mark} the **high-powered
[incentives]{.mark}** [and access to]{.mark} the **specialized
[knowledge]{.mark}** held by market participants]{.underline}, [making
it **difficult**]{.underline} for them [to choose]{.underline} among
competitive technologies. Moreover, [[public actors do not]{.mark}
**directly [bear]{.mark} the [risk]{.mark}** of bad
decisions]{.underline}. While [they [can take credit]{.mark} for
creating value [by **cherry-picking**]{.mark} high-quality
projects]{.underline}, funding companies and technologies [that would
have been **successful anyway**]{.underline}, [hence
**[wasting]{.mark}** public [resources]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[they
can]{.mark} also **[blame]{.mark}** failures on]{.underline}
short-sighted private investors who fail to supply the complementary
private **[[capital]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Obviously, the loss of money
used to finance these failing projects is borne by the taxpayers, and
not directly by the public actors.

Government [[officials]{.mark} and politicians **rarely** act as
**benevolent planners**]{.underline}: [they seek to [maximize]{.mark}
their **[private interests]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g., influence or
votes in the case of politicians). [They don't seek to maximize
**profits** in the marketplace as they don't **directly join the
returns** of these positive states of nature]{.underline} (probably only
politicians in the form of arguments to be used in the political
campaigns). [Proponents]{.underline} of the Great Reset [have not
explained how **short-sighted bureaucrats** and **politicians** with
objectives that **likely differ** from]{.underline} that of [the
electorate can bring about **successful**]{.underline} tech
entrepreneurship, and more in general **[innovation]{.underline}**, that
will facilitate the various Great Reset goals. Of course, [[the
historical record is **not comforting**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [with
**ample evidence** of the failure of government-led innovation programs
[such as]{.mark} **[Minitel]{.mark}**]{.underline} (in France),
**[[Solyndra]{.underline}]{.mark}** (in the US), [[and]{.mark}
**[U]{.mark}niversal [C]{.mark}redit**]{.underline} (in the UK), among
many other examples (Datta-Chaudhuri, 1990, Helm, 2010, Keech and
Munger, 2015).

Of course, [broadening]{.underline} the domain of application of
management [theory]{.underline} beyond its original concern with
organizations and their management **[does not logically
entail]{.underline}** that management theory needs a great reset in
terms of [building **new** theory]{.underline} that is more fit for
various alleged new challenges. And yet, [a number of scholars have
called for a radical change]{.underline}, perhaps [even a
reset]{.underline}, [of]{.underline} management [theory]{.underline}.
Thus, one of the editors of the present Special Issue argues that we can
view "politics, economy, science, health" as distinct "function systems"
that change "from context to context and over time," implying that
"Management and organization theories, which are by default geared to
economic and political issues, are thus likely to produce caricatures of
their research domains that systematically exaggerate the significance
of these two subsystems and underestimate the role of all others" (Roth,
2021a). Put differently, he calls for an improved understanding of
interlevel relations (e.g., politics and business) and in general less
"sealing off" between phenomenal domains (e.g., health and management).

Others argue that while business schools must further change their
priorities and missions to "respond to the pace of change in technology,
competition and social expectations" and that COVID-19 has provided
impetus to rise to the call for business to lead social change" (Kelly &
Dodgson, 2021), there isn't necessarily a need to develop new theory.
Along such lines, Williams and Whiteman's (2021: 526) argue that "[our
focus must move away from a **theory-fetish** toward a **more applied
action orientation** that contributes to theory-building but does not
make that its **main** or **singular** aim]{.underline}" and that
management [research needs to focus more on]{.underline} "[how
our]{.underline} organizational and management [theories can
**contribute concretely** to helping humanity prepare for and respond to
these shocks]{.underline} and build long-term societal resilience."
[Delivering in these dimensions does not require the creation of **new**
theory or a **fundamental rethink** of existing]{.underline} management
[theory]{.underline}. [The body of thinking across the various social
sciences is]{.underline}, we argue, [**sufficiently robust** and
**adaptable** to cope with the major]{.underline} management [issues of
the 21st century]{.underline}.

Thus, [**existing thinking** on real options]{.underline} (Trigeorgis &
Reuer, 2016), [dynamic capabilities]{.underline} (Teece, Pisano, &
Shuen, 1998), strategic (Hitt, Ireland, Camp, & Sexton, 2001) and
institutional (Garud, Hardy, & Maguire, 2007)
[entrepreneurship]{.underline}, [and business ecosystems]{.underline}
(Jacobides, Cennamo, & Gawer, 2018) [are]{.underline} examples of (macro
management) research that is [**helpful** for understanding how firms
can deal with]{.underline} "**[grand challenges]{.underline}**" [such as
poverty alleviation]{.underline}, [inequality]{.underline},
[environmental protection]{.underline}, [and so on]{.underline}.3

These challenges are not only "grand," but also "systemic" in the sense
that [dealing with them necessitates **multiple complementary
investments**]{.underline} (as a in business ecosystem) [brought about
by institutional entrepreneurs exercising dynamic capabilities and
entrepreneurial judgment]{.underline} in response to the high levels of
uncertainty implied in addressing the challenges.

Identifying, addressing and [resolving]{.underline} societal "[grand
challenges]{.underline}" [is **inescapably** tied up with
politics]{.underline}. [Calls for addressing these changes are
articulated in the political process]{.underline}, both by constituents
and political decision makers, [and]{.underline} firms that seek to
address the challenges [will]{.underline} both [be subject to political
pressure]{.underline} and will seek to garner political and economic
support from the political system. As we have argued, in this situation,
[the danger of a **more cronyist economy** is immanent]{.underline}.
Firms are likely to use their involvement in dealing with "grand
challenges" to build influence with politicians and bureaucrats and gain
privileges that are not available to competitors. Research on cronyism
is a major field of study (see references in Klein et al., 2021) which
is well positioned to analyze the dangers of cronyism and to help us
build institutions, policies, and practices to de-politicize the
allocation of resources and the processes of innovation and
entrepreneurship.

3\. Conclusions

We applaud the increasing interest among management scholars for social,
political, and cultural relevance. As Roth, 2021a, Roth, 2021b rightly
notes, [the system constituted by organizations and companies **cannot
be sealed off**]{.underline} from technological, political,
health-related, and cultural systems; these systems are interdependent
and interacting. It should be uncontroversial to argue that management
[scholars have **fundamental insight** to offer regarding]{.underline},
for example, the working of [decision-making processes in
politics]{.underline} and in the government section, [the drivers and
hindrances of implementation of economic policy]{.underline}, [the
criteria used for assessing policy outcomes and
initiatives]{.underline}, [and much else]{.underline} (see Galdón et
al., 2022).

We are confident that **[established thinking]{.underline}** in
management theory [can address these aspects]{.underline} as the apply
to our post-pandemic world and that no major reset of management
thinking is required. In fact, we think [a Great Reset of]{.underline}
management [theory is likely to do **more harm than good**]{.underline},
as [it is hard to see how such thinking can avoid becoming a **facile**
and **opportunistic instrument** in the hand of public policy
makers]{.underline}. While indeed management theory should be responsive
to major challenges and in general aim at helping decision-makers,
[there is **always a risk** of]{.underline} management [theory becoming
**ad hoc justification of misguided decision making**]{.underline},
[instead of **frameworks**]{.underline} and tools [for **evaluating the
relative merits of alternative policies**]{.underline} and institutions.
We are worried that calls for a great reset of management theory will
end up with exactly such opportunistic, legitimizing "theory."

Moreover, as we argue above, Great Reset thesis itself is fundamentally
misguided, so there is no need for a management theory reset to
accompany it. To be sure, [our current]{.underline}, [mostly
market-based economy]{.underline} (call it "neoliberalism" or "the
Washington Consensus" or "democratic **[capitalism]{.underline}**") [is
**hardly perfect**]{.underline} (Rajan and Zingales, 2005, Goldfajn et
al., 2021, Monga, 2021). [But it is **far better** than the economic
system Great Reset proponents]{.underline} appear to [have in
mind]{.underline}, one [in which the state plays a greater role in the
economy]{.underline}; [firms are evaluated by vague]{.underline},
[complex]{.underline}, [and politically defined performance
criteria]{.underline}; [and competitive forces that tend to direct
resources toward more competent owners are replaced with
socialized]{.underline}, [politicized decision-making]{.underline}.
Comparative institutional analysis suggests that [these moves will
**exacerbate**]{.underline}, **[not alleviate]{.underline}**, [concerns
about the environment]{.underline}, [inequality]{.underline},
[stagnation]{.underline}, [and so on]{.underline}.
