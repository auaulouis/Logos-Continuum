NATO's Valuable Arctic Expertise

Converging Russian and Chinese interests both in and beyond the Arctic
requires the United States to work by, with, and through allies to
counter threats in the region. [Traditionally, the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates has enjoyed unrivaled military dominance, but
[in]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark}, it now [faces]{.mark} an emerging
alliance between two [formidable competitors.]{.mark} **This situation
[underscores]{.mark} the [need for a collaborative approach]{.mark}
[with NATO allies to ensure preparedness for]{.mark} a [crisis
in]{.mark} the [Arctic.]{.mark}**]{.underline} American dominance cannot
be taken for granted. [In the Arctic, [U.S. capabilities are **not
enough**]{.mark} to counter Russia, let alone a Sino-Russian
alliance.]{.underline}

Per our recently published research, successful military operations in
the Arctic require not only specialized equipment but also dedicated
training and doctrine for polar warfare. [[Arctic operations]{.mark} are
[uniquely challenging]{.mark}, with complex logistics, extreme weather,
and seasonal shifts like polar days and nights.]{.underline}
Accordingly, [building Arctic-ready forces
[requires]{.mark}]{.underline} "the deliberate education and development
of Arctic-minded leaders alongside **[[collaboration with]{.mark}
[allies and partners]{.mark}]{.underline}** to foster enhanced cold
weather war-fighting capabilities across the spectrum." Arctic
warfighting requires more than just specialized equipment --- rather, it
demands the dedicated attention of those troops who will be assigned to
conduct it. Lessons learned from previous Arctic conflicts include the
need for cold weather warfare training and equipment, dedicated polar
war-fighting doctrine, joint operations, interoperability, mobility in
Arctic conditions, planning for increased supplies and unique logistics,
[Arctic domain awareness and intelligence,]{.underline} space weather
disrupting command and control, inimitable polar weather issues
associated with polar days and nights, controlling Arctic sea lines of
communication, and ensuring unity of command.

Fortunately, **[[NATO]{.mark} already [has]{.mark} much of the
[necessary infrastructure in place]{.mark}]{.underline}** with the
Nordics. For instance, the British-led Joint Expeditionary Force was
established in 2014 and emphasized Arctic warfare capabilities with
Nordic military forces in the High North. More recent developments
include the establishment of a NATO Multi-Corps Land Component Command
in Finland, the formation of a Nordic Air Force, and the creation of a
NATO Commander Task Force Baltic in the German port city of Rostock.
[All [reflect]{.mark} a boost in NATO's **[cohesion,]{.mark}
[capability, and communication]{.mark}**]{.underline}, helping establish
the "3 Cs of Deterrence" around the Arctic Circle.

[[NATO]{.underline}'s]{.mark} role in defending the Arctic has grown
[[increasingly vital]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the alliance can
capitalize on the polar expertise of its Arctic countries. Canada,
Denmark (Greenland), Norway, Sweden, and Finland are highly trained in
cold-weather warfare, have a deep understanding of Arctic operations,
and are geographically positioned to respond quickly to threats in the
region. Moreover, the Nordic countries are jointly negotiating the
procurement of an infantry fighting vehicle specifically for the
subarctic climate.

Finland's expertise in Arctic warfare can be traced to the Winter War
(1939--1940), when it held off a numerically superior Soviet invasion
force longer and better than expected due to superior tactics adapted to
its unique Arctic environment, before ultimately losing. Finland's
contributions to NATO include substantial ground forces and long-range
fires. Likewise, Norway hosts the NATO Centre of Excellence for Cold
Weather Operations. Sweden's recent ascension to NATO bolsters the air
capabilities and industrial base of the alliance while Denmark's Joint
Arctic Command provides critical presence, experience, and capability.
Canada has long been a key U.S. partner in the Arctic as a part of the
bi-national North American Air Defense Command.

Filling Gaps in the Ice

While Canada and the Nordics specialize more in Arctic warfighting, NATO
still faces significant military capability gaps in the Arctic. To
effectively counter potential aggression from Russia and China in the
Arctic, NATO needs to strengthen its ability to conduct a range of
specialized military operations in the Arctic including long-range
fires, multi-domain awareness, air and missile defense, attack aviation,
amphibious operations, and the logistical sustainment of resilient
forces capable of enduring prolonged engagements in harsh polar
conditions.

NATO faces specific challenges in Arctic naval readiness, particularly
in ice-capable vessels and icebreakers, which are an "important element
of Arctic sovereignty." Russia holds a clear advantage with 46
icebreakers, Project 22100 Ocean Patrol Vessels, and its new ice-capable
Project 23550 ships. These vessels offer Russia a massive Arctic
advantage enabling superior presence and mobility. NATO should focus on
building additional vessels like Canada's Harry DeWolf Arctic Offshore
Patrol Ships and an updated version of Denmark's Thetis-class frigates.
The recently penned collaborative ICE Pact between the United States,
Canada, and Finland is a step in the right direction for bolstering
their respective industrial bases to build more icebreakers.
Additionally, partnerships with non-NATO allies that have icebreakers,
such as Japan, South Korea, and Australia, could support NATO operations
in the Arctic if needed in a crisis. For current gaps in Arctic
coverage, NATO needs more anti-access and area denial capabilities to
pose a credible threat to Russian operations. NATO needs to embark on a
sustained investment campaign to bolster its Arctic deterrence
capabilities both on land and at sea in the Arctic.

Minimal Arctic Capabilities

[The [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [needs NATO for Arctic
stability]{.mark}, due to struggles in committing tangible resources to
the Arctic besides **more hollow strategies**.]{.underline} Increasing
Arctic-specific training, expanding icebreaking capabilities, and
enhancing interoperability with Canada, the Nordics, and Arctic-minded
countries (such as the United Kingdom) are essential steps for
projecting force in the Arctic. Training exercises like Arctic Edge and
the Joint Pacific Multinational Readiness Center Rotation 24-02
demonstrate progress but should be scaled up to counter the threat posed
by the growing Sino-Russian alliance. The United States also maintains
critical Arctic installations --- including Pituffik Space Base in
Greenland, which serves as a critical hub for missile defense and
satellite communications --- but more Arctic bases are needed to
effectively compete in the region. Similarly, the U.S. Army established
the 11th Airborne Division "Arctic Angels" in 2022 at Anchorage, Alaska,
with 11,000 soldiers focused on extreme cold weather operations.
However, it is problematic that this unit maintains "readiness for
global deployments ... \[and\] for large-scale combat operations" when
it should be wholly focused on polar warfare. Worse, the unit struggles
with numerous internal morale issues.

The United States ought to go further in building its Arctic
capabilities, by ramping up its Arctic-specific training programs and
investing in research and development aimed at enhancing cold-weather
operational capabilities. This includes expanding its fleet of
icebreakers, which is currently insufficient to conduct the necessary
peacetime missions, let alone support a potential conflict in the
region. However, these initiatives are unlikely due to the Arctic being
a low priority under current global force management postures. Ruthless
defense prioritization means the Arctic will likely continue to be
neglected, despite growing risks. **[Thus, the [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [should foster greater cooperation with]{.mark} its
[NATO]{.mark} Arctic [allies,]{.mark}]{.underline}** particularly Canada
and the Nordics, [[to ensure a]{.mark} [coordinated and effective
response to any potential crisis]{.mark} in the region.]{.underline}
Undergirding that should be civil society engagement with indigenous
populations around the Arctic Circle in a mutually beneficial way to
ensure their security and to partner with them to increase Arctic domain
awareness.

#### Lack of binding consultation collapses NATO and multilat governance\-\--extinction. 

**Flanagan '24** \[Stephen; Senior Political Scientist at the Rand
Corporation, PhD in IR from Tufts; "SUSTAINING NATO'S POLITICAL
COHESION," Routledge, 2024\] owen

The North Atlantic Treaty provided little guidance on the organisation's
political roles. [[In confronting]{.mark} several [**crises**,
Allies]{.mark} came to **[appreciate]{.mark}**]{.underline} that
[[**continuous** political **consultations** to
**facilitate**]{.underline}]{.mark} the [coordination of
**[policy]{.mark}** and strategy are **essential** to
[maintain]{.mark}ing the [**cohesion** that undergirds]{.mark} the
[Alliance]{.mark}'s collective defence commitments [and]{.mark} stature
in **[global affairs]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In [recent years,
Allies']{.underline} [political consultations have [address]{.mark}ed an
ever-broadening **range of issues** that impact their **[mutual
security]{.mark}** and common interests including global
**[terror]{.mark}ism**]{.underline}, the growing [influence of
**[China]{.mark}**, pandemic **[disease]{.mark}** and
**[climate]{.mark}** change.]{.underline}

When French President Emmanuel [[Macron declared NATO]{.mark} '**brain
[dead']{.mark}**]{.underline} during a November 2019 interview, he was
[expressing his dismay [about the paucity of]{.mark} strategic [policy
consultations]{.mark}]{.underline} and, most immediately, about the
[[**uncoordinated decision** making by the **U**]{.mark}nited
**[S]{.mark}**tates]{.underline} and Türkiye with respect to Syria that
impacted the security of other Allies.1 Macron and other Allied leaders
were also [alarmed by the policies of President Donald Trump that
[called into question the US commitment to Europe]{.mark}
and]{.underline} collective defence and by concerns about the US
[decision to give greater priority to the Asia--Pacific
region]{.underline} -- initiated under President Barack Obama in 2012.
This [turmoil led Allied heads of state]{.underline} and government at
their December 2019 meeting in London [to ask NATO Secretary
General]{.underline} Jens Stoltenberg [to undertake a 'forward-looking
reflection process to further strengthen NATO's]{.underline} political
dimension including consultation.'2

Macron's lament and the Allied response was an ironic echo of events in
1956. The failure of France and the United Kingdom to alert other Allies
before launching, together with Israel, their failed military operation
to seize control of the Suez Canal and prevent its nationalisation by
Egypt, gave impetus to the recommendations of an advisory group known as
'The Three Wise Men,' that called for strengthening Allied political
consultations.3

At this time, there are no Mississippi cases which construe Canon 7A(3).
However, other [[courts]{.underline}]{.mark} [have
[interpret]{.mark}ed]{.underline} Canon 7A(3) or
[[a]{.underline}]{.mark} similar [[provision to
**require**]{.underline}]{.mark} a judge to resign
[[when]{.underline}]{.mark} he or she becomes a candidate for a
non-judicial office. See, e.g., Morial v. Judiciary Commission of
**[Louisiana]{.underline}**, 565 F.2d 295, 299-303 (5th Cir. 1977) (Fay,
J., dissenting); \[\*\*9\] Adams v. Supreme Court of
**[Pennsylvania]{.underline}**, 502 F. Supp. 1282, 1292 (M.D.Pa. 1980)
(rule 15(E) of the Governing Standards of Conduct for District Justices

Concerning a Judge No. 591, 250 **[Ga]{.underline}**. 796, 300 S.E.2d
807 (Ga. 1983). **[This]{.underline}** \"resign-to-run\" **[requirement
has been upheld as reasonable]{.underline}**, and there are judges in
other jurisdictions who have been sanctioned in one form or another for
violation of the requirement. See, e.g., Feltz v. Crabtree, 370 S.E.2d
619 (W.Va. 1988).

[Ishee contends]{.underline} that [[the language]{.underline}]{.mark} of
Canon 7A(3) **[is not mandatory because it [says
\"should]{.mark}]{.underline}**,\" **[rather than \"the mandatory
terminology of \'shall]{.underline}**.\'\" [Ishee cites [no authority
for]{.mark} his [distinction between \"shall\" and
\"should.\"]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[The]{.mark} American Heritage [Dictionary]{.mark} of the English
Language]{.underline} (1981) [[defines]{.mark} \"[should\"
as:]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[the past tense of shall]{.underline},]{.mark} **[but more often used
as an auxiliary verb expressing degrees of the present and
future]{.underline}** and various shades \[\*\*10\] **[of attendant
meaning indicating: 1. obligation; duty; necessity]{.underline}**....

Id. at 1199. [The fact [that \"should\" is the past tense of \"shall\"
means]{.mark} that [the two]{.mark} words [are]{.mark} basically **[the
same]{.mark}**]{.underline}, especially **[[with regard to]{.mark} their
\"[mandatory]{.mark}\" nature]{.underline}**. Furthermore, **[[the first
listed definition of \"should\" states that]{.mark} the word [connotes a
requirement, not an option]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Ishee fails to
convince us **[[that]{.underline}]{.mark}** [Canon]{.underline} 7A(3)
**[[does]{.underline}]{.mark}** not **[[mandate]{.underline}]{.mark}**
resignation by a judge who chooses to stand for election to a
non-judicial office. Ishee also alleges that prior to his receipt of the
letter of June 14, 1991, notifying him of the enforcement of Canon
7A(3), he spoke with a justice court judge, who served as a member of
the Mississippi Commission on Judicial Performance, and who was also to
become a member of the Committee who heard Ishee\'s case. Ishee alleged
that this Commission member told him that running for the office of
circuit clerk while serving as a justice court judge did not violate
Canon 7A(3).

Servs.", Court of Appeals of Michigan, 2017 Mich. App. LEXIS 1178,
7/20/2017, Lexis

The specifications in the drawings for the mini-piles stated that the
capacity for the mini-piles was \"to be\" 6,000 or 8,000 pounds and that
the length of the mini-piles was \"to be\" adequate to get into
undisturbed soil to a depth adequate for obtaining the required
capacity. The specifications in the project manual stated that the
mini-piles \"should\" have a capacity of 4 tons and 3 tons, that the
mini-piles \"should\" be driven to minimum depth of 25 feet, and that a
grout bulb \"should\" be formed at the base of a mini-pile. Kenneth
Winters, an expert in structural engineering, and Richard Anderson, an
expert in geotechnical engineering, agreed with Steve Maranowski,
plaintiff\'s president, that the specifications in the project manual,
because those specifications used the word \"should,\" were permissive
and suggestions of what plaintiff could do to achieve the required
capacity. However, the trial court, when it instructed the jury on how
to interpret the contract, instructed the jury that it was to interpret
the words of the contract by giving them their ordinary and common
meaning. [[An **ordinary**]{.mark} and [**common** meaning of]{.mark}
the word [\"should\" is]{.mark} that it denotes [a **mandatory
obligation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. \[\*9\] [See People v

\"should,\" in pertinent part, as \"[used]{.mark} in auxiliary function

evidence in a light most favorable to defendant, reasonable jurors could
have honestly reached different conclusions on whether the
specifications in the project manual were mandatory and, because
Maranowski admitted that plaintiff did not use grout bulbs and did not
drive all the mini-piles at least 25 feet into the ground, whether
plaintiff breached the contract. Morinelli, 242 Mich App at 260-261.

[[Every **action**]{.underline}]{.mark} or decision [[has
**some**]{.mark} kind of [**effect** on
**something**]{.mark}]{.underline} or someone, [if only in an

actions we take can have a huge impact, not just on those directly
involved, but on others we could hardly fathom would be affected. You
never know what little action may be the tipping point for another
action and or reaction.

When you hear the words "The Butterfly Effect", most of you will
probably think of the movie. That was about the chaos theory, meaning
one series of events leads to another and the effect of changing the
course of those events.

Actually the term "The Butterfly Effect", was a phenomenon proposed in a
doctoral thesis written in 1963 by Edward Lorenz. It states that [[a
butterfly]{.underline}]{.mark}, by flapping its wings in one place and
time [[is able to create]{.mark} a major **[weather]{.mark} event** in
another **place** and **time**]{.underline}, eventually having a
far-reaching ripple effect on subsequent events.

The butterfly effect suggests that [[**cause** and **effect** are

[cause]{.mark}**]{.underline} of our predicaments, rooted far away in
time and space, [[are]{.mark} ultimately
[unfathomable]{.mark}]{.underline}. More than just an esoteric science,
the chaos theory works off the concept that the relation between any two
things is rarely linear in nature, that any reaction is usually the
result of an accumulation of causative factors small and large,
intentional and accidental.

\
His words reflect strong support for Trump\'s bold approach and unusual
foreign policy decisions.\
\
Rutte is also advocating Trump\'s contentious push for NATO countries to
increase their defense budgets to 5 percent of their gross domestic
product, more than double the current standard.\
\
In previous remarks, Rutte has even proposed reducing European social
expenditures to allocate more funds to military sectors and
controversially hinted that without these changes, Western Europeans may
need to \"learn Russian.\"\

NATO Secretary General Jens [Stoltenberg has set up a group of
experts]{.underline} whose task is [to develop recommendations on
**strengthening**]{.underline} the political dimension and [NATO
**consultations**]{.underline}. The immediate reason for this decision
was the [**[unilateral actions]{.mark}** of member states]{.underline}
that might [[have a **negative effect**]{.mark} on the security of the
Alliance. Therefore]{.underline}, a group of [experts should primarily
look for solutions]{.underline} to reduce the risk of such activities in
the future. To this end, it is necessary to strengthen the specific
dimension of consultations to increase the chances of coordinating
allied policy towards the Middle East and North Africa, and even towards
China.

Just before the meeting of NATO leaders in London in December 2019,
French President Emmanuel Macron publicly criticised the Alliance,
stating that it suffered from "brain death". The immediate reason for
the criticism was the Turkish intervention in Syria launched in October
aimed primarily at the Kurdish YPG, which Turkey views as a terrorist
group, while some NATO states treat it as an ally in the fight against
the so-called Islamic State (ISIS). Macron emphasized that the path to
this intervention was opened through decisions by U.S. President Donald
Trump to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria without consulting allies.
According to the French president, the Turkish offensive complicated the
fight against ISIS and increased the risk of a Syrian counterattack
against Turkey. This would pose a dilemma for NATO about whether Art. 5
of the Washington treaty would apply (defence of one by all).

France and many other [[members]{.mark} of the Alliance [are
**afraid**]{.mark} that [U.S. policy]{.mark}]{.underline} towards Syria
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} just **[[a]{.underline}]{.mark}**nother [[sign
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the Americans [[concentrating
on]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[rivalry]{.underline}]{.mark} with China
[[to the detriment of]{.mark} its **[commitment]{.mark}** to broader
European security. Such concerns have further **intensified** under
**Trump**'s prolonged criticism of NATO.]{.underline}

[[In response to]{.mark} the **overt [divisions]{.mark}**, at a meeting
in London, the [leaders]{.mark} of the member states [announced a
**period of**]{.mark} **strategic [reflection]{.mark}**, which is
expected [to **strengthen**]{.mark} **the [consultation]{.mark}
mechanisms** and the political dimension of NATO]{.underline}. On 31
March, NATO Secretary General Jens [Stoltenberg appointed]{.underline} a
group of 10 [experts who should present him with recommendations on this
matter [by the **end of the year**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The group is
headed by Wess Mitchel (U.S.) and Thomas de Maizière (Germany). It also
includes Greta Bossenmaier (Canada), Anja Dalgaard-Nielsen (Denmark),
Hubert Védrine (France), Marta Dassù (Italy), Herna Verhagen
(Netherlands), Tacan İldem (Turkey), John Bew (UK), and Anna Fotyga
(Poland). At the beginning of April, the group met for the first time.

NATO Consultation Mechanisms

[NATO has developed an institutional machinery and **tradition of
consultation** primarily in support of its main mission, which is the
defence of allied territory]{.underline} and security of the
Euro-Atlantic area. At the same time, since its inception the Alliance
has faced a challenge of how to strengthen consultations on the planned
activities of the member states outside Europe, which may negatively
affect NATO security. [Consultations are [based on the
**assumption**]{.mark} that [the state may **modify**]{.mark} **its
[plans]{.mark}** [under the **influence** of]{.mark} **other [allies'
opinions]{.mark}**[. **Even if** consultations do not lead to]{.mark}
such [a change,]{.mark} the [Alliance]{.mark} will not be **surprised**
by unilateral actions and **[obtains]{.mark} the necessary
[time]{.mark}** [to **agree**]{.mark} a **joint response**. [This
**reduces**]{.mark} **the risk of [tensions]{.mark}** [that]{.mark}
could **[threaten]{.mark} NATO's political [cohesion]{.mark}** and
credibility]{.underline}. Nevertheless, NATO members often do not
consult, especially when they expect that the chances to receive
Alliance support are slim and consultation only limits their freedom of
manoeuvre.

The 1956 report of three ministers (the 'Three Wise Men') offered clear
practical suggestions for consultation, stating that it "means
discussion of problems collectively, in the early stages of policy
formation, and before national positions become fixed." 2 The report
significantly influenced the development of [[NATO's consultation
**norms**]{.underline}]{.mark}. It [[made clear]{.mark} that
consultations are [not about informing]{.mark} other Allies [about
decisions]{.mark} that have [already]{.mark} been [taken, but
entail]{.mark} frank discussion and the possibility of **[influencing
national choices]{.mark}**]{.underline} that affect mutual security. 3

The strongest norms and most elaborate mechanisms have been developed
regarding consultations on collective defence policy. Since this is a
primary task of NATO, derived directly from the Washington Treaty, some
experts claim that there might be a legal obligation to consult before a
NATO member takes a definite action, which could undermine the common
defence. 4 There is no mechanism to enforce compliance and there are
numerous examples of Allies bypassing consultation to take unilateral
actions. Nevertheless, most Allies try to respect such a norm as it
creates a similar obligation for the US, limiting the risk, for example,
of the unexpected or uncoordinated withdrawal of US troops from Europe.

There is another [[important dimension of consultations]{.mark}
concerning actions **[outside the Euro-Atlantic
area]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[since this is not a 'treaty area' there
is no apparent legal obligation to consult. Nevertheless, the European
**[Allies expect]{.mark}**ed the [US to use consultations to **inform**
them about plans]{.mark} that could affect NATO's security.]{.underline}
The US was also interested in such consultations, expecting that they
would facilitate coordination of NATO policies in support of American
foreign policy goals, but this rarely turned out to be the case. The
1967 Harmel report was an attempt to strengthen this dimension of
consultation and thus NATO's political cohesion, stating that "[the
North Atlantic Treaty Area cannot be treated in **isolation** from the
rest of the world. Crises and **conflicts** arising outside the area may
**impair** its security either directly or by affecting the **global
balance**.]{.underline}"5

In 1974, NATO made another attempt to strengthen consultations adopting
the Ottawa Declaration, which stressed that "the Allies are firmly
resolved to keep each other fully informed and to strengthen the
practice of frank and timely consultations by all means which may be
appropriate on matters relating to their common interests as members of
the Alliance, bearing in mind that these interests can be affected by
events in other areas of the world." 6

Such declarations, however, did not solve the structural problemsthat
discouraged states from consulting to coordinate common responses to
crises outside the treaty area. Some states blocked such consultations,
believing that the Alliance should not deal with problems beyond its
'treaty area' and that discussions could lead to new commitments that
would undermine collective defence and deterrence policy. Bigger states
also wanted to preserve their privileged bilateral relations with the
US, which often resulted in informal consultations in smaller formats.
The US did not want to share sensitive information with all Allies
without guarantees that this would result in coordinated action in
support of US foreign policy goals.

Post Cold-War

After the end of the Cold War, it became obvious that NATO would have to
adjust to the new strategic situation and new threats if it were to
maintain its relevance and retain US interest. NATO began to augment
Article 4 of the Washington Treaty as a mechanism to facilitate common
out-of-area missions. The first postCold War NATO strategy, approved in
1991, stated that "Alliance security interests can be affected by other
risks of a wider nature, including proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction, disruption of the flow of vital resources and actions of
terrorism and sabotage," and indicated that arrangements for
consultation under Article 4 could lead to coordinated efforts in
response to such risks.7 Similar wording was used in the 1999 strategic
concept, while the 2010 concept additionally broadened NATO tasks to
include crisis management. 8 NATO thus developed norms and mechanisms
(supported with capabilities) that could be used to respond to threats
wherever they might arise. These could have been used after the 11
September 2001 terrorist attacks against the US had NATO not decided to
invoke Article 5 instead. NATO subsequently offered significant support
to the US, assumed the command of a mission in Afghanistan and consulted
to limit the political tensions inherent in such a task. At the same
time, informal consultations took place among a smaller group of states
that contributed most to the fight against terrorism.

[In **[recent years]{.mark}**, NATO's mechanisms of
[consult]{.mark}ation have **[prove]{.mark}d l[acking]{.mark}** in
defusing tensions and discouraging [unilateral
actions]{.mark}]{.underline}, both in the Euro-Atlantic area and beyond
it. During Donald Trump's presidency, for example, the [US withdrew
troops from **Syria**]{.underline}, despite the possible impact on the
security of the Allies. This unilateral decision encouraged Turkey to
send troops to Syria, which could further complicate the fight with
Islamic terrorist groups and increase the risk of confrontation between
Turkey and Russia, which has a military presence in Syria. Also, despite
NATO's [presence in **Afghanistan**]{.underline}, the US pursued
negotiations with the Taliban without providing NATO with an insight
into its plans. And it only resorted to consultations in NATO on its
decision to withdraw from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty
after the criticism from the Allies. Similarly, it first announced the
decision to [withdraw troops from **Germany**]{.underline} and only
later consulted with Allies about how to limit the impact on NATO. Some
of these [decisions]{.underline} [[were publicly criticised]{.mark} by
NATO members]{.underline}, most vocally by French president Emmanuel
[Macron]{.underline} who, before the 2019 NATO leaders meeting, [accused
the Alliance of being "**brain dead**" and took the opportunity to
promote the idea of European 'strategic autonomy'. 9]{.underline}

Improving Consultation

There are numerous [reasons for tensions in NATO today]{.underline}. The
Trump administration has taken a more unilateral approach to
international relations and not seen NATO as an important tool.
Divergent threat perceptions and the politically difficult process of
NATO's adaptation to a new strategic situation has also played a part.
Since the annexation of Crimea in 2014, NATO has viewed Russia as a
potential threat, but some Allies have felt more threatened then others.
NATO is strengthening its defence and deterrence potential but at the
same time must maintain its crisis management capacity, and its
usefulness for states who feel more threatened by terrorism and
irregular migration. Although the US perceives both China and Russia as
rivals, there is a growing consensus that China poses a real strategic
challenge to the US. 10 US engagement in Europe is likely to be linked
to the rise of China, which increases the [[risk of]{.mark}
transatlantic [tensions over]{.mark} global
[strategy]{.mark}]{.underline} and the division of labour between US and
Europe in the treaty area.

Although [[Allies will always have some **different interests**]{.mark},
they can use [consultations]{.mark} to [**limit** their negative,
political **impact**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} They can also [adjust
consultation mechanisms to changing strategic realitie]{.underline}s,
further [limiting the risk of tensions and [increas]{.mark}ing the
probability of a common, **[coordinated response]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
The [Allies should thus]{.underline} agree a set of principles to guide
their consultations in the coming decade. These might include:

• [[Consultations **must not be merely notifications**]{.mark} or
briefings about decisions already taken. They **[must entail]{.mark}**
frank discussions and the [**chance to influence** an Ally's
actions]{.mark}.]{.underline}

• [Consultations with Allies should always precede discussions with
rivals.]{.underline}

• Allies [must consult before they take any decision that could
undermine]{.underline} the credibility of collective
[defence.]{.underline}

• When time permits, **[[Allies should consult on actions
out-of-area]{.mark},]{.underline}** which could affect NATO security.

• When Allies agree on common actions out-of area, there must be full
consultations on matters that may affect the common mission.

Allies can also take measures to influence their cost-benefit
calculations regarding timely discussions of crucial issues. They
should: • Commit, in a highly visible political declaration, to observe
agreed norms.

• Formally assess whether the norms of NATO consultations, which require
frank discussion on matters affecting collective defence, have been
violated. This will be necessary to restore confidence in the
consultation mechanism in its most important dimension and to limit the
risk of future unilateral actions. NATO's mechanisms of consultation
have proved lacking in defusing tensions and discouraging unilateral
actions

• Create an incentive for [consult]{.underline}ations [on issues that
extend beyond collective defence]{.underline}. Even though support for
out-of-area actions cannot be guaranteed, Allies could commit to not
publicly criticise the actions of an Ally that has used the consultation
mechanism.

**Elmore \'80** \[Prof. Public Affairs at University of Washington,

The emergence of implementation as a subject for policy analysis
coincides closely with the discovery by policy analysts that [decisions
are not self-executing]{.underline}. [[**Analysis of policy choices
matter very little** if the **mechanism** for **implementing**]{.mark}
those choices [is **poorly understood**]{.mark} in answering the
question, \"[What percentage of]{.mark} the work of achieving a desired
[governmental action is done when the preferred analytic]{.mark}
alternative [has been identified]{.mark}?\" Allison estimated that in
the normal case, it was [about 10 percent, leaving the remaining **90
percent in the realm of implementation**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

The Proposition of Policy: Urging Future Action In policy propositions,
[[each topic contains]{.mark} certain **[key
elements]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} although they have slightly
different functions from comparable elements of value-oriented
propositions[. 1. [An agent]{.mark} doing the [**acting** \-\--"The
United States"]{.mark} in "The United States should]{.underline} adopt a
policy of free trade." Like the object of evaluation in a proposition of
value, [the agent is the subject of the sentence. 2. [The verb
should]{.mark}]{.underline}---the first part of a verb phrase [[that
**urges action**]{.underline}]{.mark}. 3. An action verb to follow
should in the should-verb combination. [For example, should
adopt]{.underline} here [means to put a]{.underline} program or [[policy
into action though **governmental means**]{.underline}]{.mark}. 4. A
specification of directions or a limitation of the action desired. The
phrase free trade, for example, gives direction and limits to the topic,
which would, for example, eliminate consideration of increasing tariffs,
discussing diplomatic recognition, or discussing interstate commerce.
Propositions of policy deal with future action. Nothing has yet
occurred. [The entire [debate is about whether something **ought to
occur**.]{.mark}]{.underline} What you agree to do, then, when you
accept the affirmative side in such a debate is to offer sufficient and
compelling reasons for an audience to perform the future action that you
propose.

[Why [You Should **Study NATO**]{.mark} In 2022]{.underline}

[[Any event **reminiscent** of]{.mark} **NATO's [Cold War]{.mark}**
beginnings is bound to **[pique interest]{.mark}** in [the
Alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}. While [recent events in
Ukraine](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2022/1/3/russia-us-face-off-what-should-we-expect-in-2022) have
re-engaged public interest in NATO, [the Alliance [has been
**reinventing** itself]{.mark} consistently since its beginnings,
[making it a **key player**]{.mark} **to watch** in
20**22**]{.underline}.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation has evolved and grown since its
inception in 1949, changing to address new threats and challenges from
decade to decade. Though established to combat concerns of Soviet
expansion, NATO's only cornerstone, Article 5, which establishes the
Alliance's value of [collective
security](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_17120.htm),
was never invoked during the 20th century. NATO's most active period by
this measure would then have to be the 9/11 response and creation of
the [International Security Assistance Force
(ISAF)](https://www.understandingwar.org/international-security-assistance-force-isaf) in
Afghanistan which NATO commanded from 2003 to 2014. The emerging threats
NATO faces today, including disinformation, hybrid warfare, cyber
warfare, and the security implications of climate change create yet
another need for the organization to pivot its focus. Far from growing
irrelevant after the collapse of the Soviet Union, NATO continues to
adapt to the 21st century, facing a threat landscape today that would be
completely unrecognizable to those who drafted the [Washington
Treaty](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/official_texts_17120.htm). 

[When **studying NATO** [in the **modern-day**]{.mark}, Ukraine is as
good a place to start as any. While NATO has **adapted** to face new
challenges around the world, its adversarial relationship with
**Russia** remains what it is best known for]{.underline}. Naturally,
when such an issue comes to the forefront of the news, internet searches
for what NATO is doing these days are bound to follow. The Ukraine
standoff has reignited not only public interest in the Alliance but
possibly that of [key partners Sweden and
Finland](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_188061.htm), who
recently demonstrated that any attempt by Russia to ban them from
joining NATO [was only making the option more
desirable](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-01-10/russia-is-pushing-finland-and-sweden-toward-nato).
As with the Russia-US standoffs of the past, NATO is always drawn very
closely into the fray. 

While there are possibilities of alliance enlargement, cohesion remains
one of the most pressing issues facing NATO in 2022. For instance, the
development of a trilateral security pact between Australia, the United
Kingdom, and the United States (AUKUS) in the Indo-Pacific left NATO
members excluded from a security agreement made between Allies and
partners. France was of course [particularly
slighted](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2021/sep/16/what-is-the-aukus-alliance-and-what-are-its-implications) given
that this decision ended a 2016 contract between France and Australia
for 12 diesel-powered submarines. This development is a concern in
regards to alliance cohesion. Such a move would create rifts in any
alliance, but this is particularly concerning to NATO given how
important mutual understanding is to the organization, exemplified by
the Alliance's consensus-based decision-making process.

The threats facing NATO in 2022 are, however, more varied and nefarious
than a simple lack of team spirit. Climate change is seen as a [threat
multiplier](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_185000.htm?selectedLocale=en) given
its multitude of impacts on global security: resource scarcity, natural
disasters, social, economic, and political instability, and migration,
among others. Another major threat to the Alliance at present is the
advancement of cyber and hybrid warfare technologies. The fog of war is
thickest in cyberspace as the threat landscape of cyber and hybrid
warfare is [ambiguous, dynamic, and more
complex](https://www.nato.int/docu/review/articles/2021/11/30/hybrid-warfare-new-threats-complexity-and-trust-as-the-antidote/index.html) than
what NATO traditionally handles. Cyberspace has been an official zone of
operation [since
2016](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/topics_78170.htm), and it is,
therefore, NATO's role to protect its assets and assist Allies in
building national resilience to this ever-evolving threat. 

[[While]{.mark} these **pressing [challenges]{.mark}** [affect **each
country**]{.mark} differently and to varying extents, [member]{.mark}
state[**s** are]{.mark} still **[well-served]{.mark}** to address these
threats [through the **mechanisms of NATO**]{.mark}. [NATO]{.mark}
member states [benefit from]{.mark}]{.underline} the advantages not only
of collective security but [[a **common**]{.mark} **understanding** and
**[platform]{.mark}**, as well as the lessons learned that each member
state brings to the table]{.underline}. Inter-state reliance is critical
for the Alliance to succeed, and states have the ability to contribute
to the security of their allies through their individual expertise.
Rather than nations tackling modern security issues individually, [they
would be **best served** in the long run to seek a **collaborative**
response]{.underline} whereby Allies are equipped with the tools and
knowledge to strengthen the resilience of the Atlantic community.

## Impact 

### Turns Case\-\--Arctic War\-\--2NC

#### US-NATO-Russia war is the [most probable]{.underline} scenario for Arctic escalation. 

**Tunsjø '20** \[Øystein; professor and head of the Asia program at the
Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies at the Norwegian Defence
University College. September 23; "The Great Hype: False Visions of
Conflict and Opportunity in the Arctic," *Survival: Global Politics and
Strategy*, Vol. 62, Issue 5, pp. 139-140; //ff\]

Equally important, [the **stakes** in a changing Arctic are **not high
enough** to warrant a **great-power conflict**]{.underline}. As in the
past, [it remains **unlikely** that **military force** will be used to
resolve a conflict **originating** in the Arctic. It is **more likely**
that any potential **great-power competition** in the High North between
**Russia and NATO** will reflect the **more consequential sources** of
competition and conflict in Eastern or Southern Europe -- in other
words, that conflict might **spill over** into the High North from
**somewhere else**]{.underline}.5 Developments in the Arctic appear to
have caused some observers to forget that Russia's recent naval build-up
is primarily focused on safeguarding traditional Russian security
interests, such as maintaining its sea-based nuclear deterrent and
contesting sea lanes of communication in the North Atlantic. Thus, it is
a familiar security challenge -- [Russia's rivalry with the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and **NATO** over the
European security order]{.underline} -- that [has the **highest
potential** for creating **conflict in the Arctic**]{.underline}.

Similarly, the recent focus on China's Arctic ambitions minimises the
importance of the changing balance of power in East Asia as the primary
source of US--China competition. Beijing's foremost security concern is
the US response to China's activities in its own maritime periphery, but
Chinese behaviour will also determine the United States' global
strategic priorities. Sino-American competition will compel the US to
prioritise the Asia-Pacific, and thus to draw down its commitments to
other regions. This will constrain its options in the High North.

Since [European states are **unprepared** to **substitute for American
power**, Russian advancements in Europe and the Arctic will primarily
**reflect US retrenchment** and European inertia, **rather than**
improved Russian capabilities]{.underline}. Moreover, heightened
US--China competition in the Arctic, much like heightened competition
with Russia, will be a spillover effect of US--China rivalry in East
Asia.

### Impact\-\--UQ\-\--2NC

#### Consultative [disengagement]{.underline} ensures fragmentation. 

**Thompson '20** \[Jack; Lecturer in the American Studies department at
the University of Amsterdam, Ph.D. in history from the University of
Cambridge and a M.A. in American Foreign Policy and International
Economics from The Johns Hopkins University SAIS. December 31; "The US
Role in NATO," *NATO and Transatlantic Relations in the 21st Century*,
pp. 27-30; //ff\]

There is another, more abstract, but still vital reason that [the US
should maintain a **vigorous role** in NATO]{.underline}. Participation
in the transatlantic alliance is often challenging. Membership in an
organization with 29 other countries [forces policymakers to negotiate,
to make concessions, and to settle for less than ideal solutions. It
necessitates that the US thinks **less like a superpower** and **more
like an ally**]{.underline}. This is often frustrating for the world's
most powerful nation, but it is a vital exercise. One of the pernicious
consequences of US might is a temptation to strive to achieve total
security, to view a world where the US is the lone pole of power as a
realistic and desirable state of affairs. This "**[unipolar
fantasy]{.underline}**," as David Calleo calls it, [perverts US
internationalism and leads to dangerous and **counterproductive
undertakings**, such as the 2003 invasion of **Iraq**. Membership in
alliances such as NATO acts as a **countervailing force** to such
temptations]{.underline}. Furthermore, [a US that is fully **engaged**
and which engages in the tedious but essential horse-trading that is the
**lifeblood** of such alliances is also good for other NATO
members]{.underline}, which have a tendency to want the United States to
dominate but then to criticize the results. Sten Rynning notes that
[NATO works best when it functions as a **concert** of member states,
one that is a "compromise between the strategic cultures of the United
States, Canada, and Europe]{.underline}."26

[NATO's **European members** are finally embracing this
lesson]{.underline} and have embarked on a longterm process designed to
develop more robust and independent military and security capacities.
Though there are multiple conceptions of what ESA will entail, most
envision a process that allows Europe to make a more substantial
contribution to transatlantic security cooperation. Though [the US
traditionally has been **wary**]{.underline} of European initiatives
operating outside the framework of NATO -- [and the **Trump**
administration has sought to undermine it]{.underline} -- an increasing
number of US policymakers have accepted that ESA is in the interest of
the United States. It will eventually permit Europeans to assume more of
the burden for security challenges in their neighborhood, freeing
Washington to focus on more distant problems, such as China. As long as
ESA follows this [cooperative trajectory]{.underline}, it should play an
important role in the development of a more equal -- and therefore more
sustainable -- transatlantic relationship.27

Regrettably, this version [of the US-- NATO relationship may be **too
optimistic**]{.underline}. Though it is unlikely to withdraw from NATO,
[the US will probably become a **less dependable** member, one that
**oscillates** between phases of constructive engagement and periods in
which it is more **ambivalent** about the relationship and **less
willing** to engage in the **consultations** and compromises without
which the alliance **cannot function**]{.underline}. The cultural,
economic, and political problems afflicting the US are unlikely to be
resolved any time soon. This means that longstanding habits in US
political culture -- [unilateralism, suspicion of international
engagement, and (especially conservative) populism -- will continue to
play an important role in US **foreign policy**]{.underline}. These
tendencies will not predominate unabated; rather, they will crest and
recede depending on the circumstances. Crucially, because the US
President has so much potential freedom for action in national security
matters, [anytime the **GOP** controls the White House, there will be an
increased danger of a more **contentious approach** to
NATO]{.underline}.

[**Diverging interests** may also **split** the US and the rest of
NATO]{.underline}. Even if it is successful, it will take years before
ESA begins to bear fruit. In the meantime, [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [will continue to
**resent** Europeans' inability to fully contribute to joint security
challenges]{.underline}. In addition, there are some who view ESA not as
a cooperative mechanism, but primarily as a means to enable Europe to
act independently of the US. [Many of these policymakers and analysts
still desire close collaboration with the US, but fear that]{.underline}
that [the US]{.underline}, with its focus on Asia and -- [at least
during the **Trump** era]{.underline} -- hostility to the European
project, [is **no longer a reliable partner**]{.underline}.28

Though Europeans are awakening to the implications of intensifying
geopolitical competition, there are significant inter-European
differences about how to react. Meanwhile, [the US tends to take a more
**hawkish view** of the international landscape]{.underline}. China is a
case in point. Though Europe is attempting to develop an appropriately
complex policy -- mixing trade and cooperation where possible, but
remaining cognizant of the problematic nature of the Chinese regime --
Beijing is pursuing a patient and intelligent divide and conquer
approach. It is using programs such as the 17+1 format and the BRI to
make economic inroads that can later be used to wield political
influence. It does not help that the Trump administration is clumsily
pushing the Europeans to choose sides in US-- China strategic
competition. Washington and its European partners have begun to discuss
NATO's role in managing relations with China, but [there is as yet **no
consensus** as to the role the Alliance should play]{.underline}.29

Russia is another instance in which the lack of a common European policy
frustrates Washington. Some countries view Russia as Europe's foremost
security challenge while others seek a more pragmatic relationship, in
part because of unease about US intentions. With the notable exception
of Trump, there is a bipartisan US consensus on the need for maintaining
economic sanctions on Russia and providing support to countries, such as
Ukraine, that perceive Moscow as a threat. Meanwhile, Rome has called
for lifting the sanctions and Paris, though not yet willing to lift the
sanctions, has made it clear that it would like to reorient NATO's
threat perception away from Moscow. These differences will not
necessarily cause lasting damage, but close coordination will be
required to prevent a breach, especially because Russia is adept at
identifying and exploiting the fault lines in transatlantic security
debates.30

In the final analysis, NATO and the United States need each other. There
is much that binds the two and both sides will benefit from maintaining
a close and constructive relationship. Yet, [**internal and external
forces** are depleting the **will and ability** of Washington and
Brussels to take the necessary steps to ensure that the alliance
**remains viable**. Every effort should be made to **reverse this
worrying trend** -- the future safety and security of the transatlantic
region depends on it]{.underline}.

[NATO's military strength has been [a **major

war]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[with]{.underline}]{.mark} the Soviet Union
and **[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}** since 1949. A recent Atlantic
Council study reminds that America spent 14.1 percent of its GDP on
defense during the First World War, 37.5 percent during the Second World
War and 13.2 percent during the Korean Conflict. We spend nothing close
to those levels now in large part due to the great power peace we have
enjoyed for over seventy years. NATO has been a major factor in that
peace. And due to the expansion of NATO and the European Union eastward
after the fall of the Soviet Union, millions of East Europeans now live
in free, democratic societies---a significant success for U.S.
diplomacy. Second, [NATO delivers]{.underline} additional [benefits
to]{.underline} U.S. [military objectives and operations]{.underline}
beyond our shores. [[NATO is at the **heart of**]{.mark} **our
[defense]{.mark}**]{.underline} [of **North America**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[Europe]{.underline}** [[from **nuc**]{.mark}**lear
[and conventional threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}. British and French
nuclear weapons join ours in deterring aggression in the North Atlantic
area. Since the late 1940s, every Administration has believed that [the
**best way**]{.underline} [to defend our country is through American
forces forward deployed in Europe with the NATO allies]{.underline}.
[This strategy **remains right** for today given Russia's invasion of
Georgia]{.underline} in 2008, [of Crimea and Eastern
Ukraine]{.underline} in 2014 [and its current pressure on Estonia,
Latvia, Lithuania and Poland]{.underline}. [NATO remains [our **primary
vehicle for deterring Putin**]{.mark}]{.underline} in Eastern Europe.
The [NATO [allies host]{.mark} a great number of **[critical
bases]{.mark}** for U.S. forces]{.underline}---Ramstein in Germany,
Aviano in Italy, Rota in Spain, Souda Bay in Greece and Incirlik in

[Africa]{.mark}** [and the]{.mark} **[Mid]{.mark}**dle **[East]{.mark}**
and for]{.underline} our [continued military operations in

**Ballistic [Missile Defense]{.mark} network**]{.underline} focused on
the Middle East with Turkey, Romania, Poland, Germany, Spain, the
Netherlands, Denmark, the UK and other allies all hosting elements of
this system. [**NATO [allies]{.mark}**]{.underline} continue to
[[participate in]{.mark} the U.S.-led [coalition against]{.mark} the
**[I]{.mark}slamic [S]{.mark}tate**]{.underline} in the Middle East.
[Many of the allies play **lead roles**]{.underline} [in]{.underline}
other **[counter terror operations]{.underline}** [such as French forces
in Mali]{.underline} supported by the U.S. In Afghanistan, the [NATO
allies remain with us in combat operations and in training the Afghan
military]{.underline}. Over 1000 soldiers from European and other
partner nations have died there during the last seventeen years. [NATO
continues to **maintain the hard-earned peace in Kosovo**]{.underline}
[with European troops bearing the large share of the
burden]{.underline}. An EU-led force has taken on all of the
peacekeeping responsibility in Bosnia, freeing up the U.S. for other
activities. Third, [the [**NATO allies** are]{.mark} among our closest
and most [supportive]{.mark} global partners [as we confront]{.mark} the
**great [transnational challenges]{.mark}**]{.underline} that define
this century---[the **fight against [terrorism]{.mark}**, the entire
complex of **[cyber]{.mark} threats**, **[climate change]{.mark}**, the
**risk of [pandemics]{.mark}**, **mass [migration]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[and **others**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The [**[NATO]{.mark}**
allies]{.underline} and our partners in the European Union [act
together]{.underline} with us on these and other issues. [This [is of
**incalculable benefit**]{.mark}]{.underline} [to the U.S]{.underline}.
[Neither Russia nor China have treaty allies]{.underline}. [NATO is a
**significant advantage**]{.underline} [for the **U**]{.underline}nited

Last month, NATO, the world's most successful military alliance,
celebrated its 75th anniversary. Some fear that it may have been its
last anniversary with the United States playing a leading role. Former
U.S. President Donald [**Trump** still views the alliance as
**obsolete**]{.underline}. If reelected, [he says he would **encourage
Russian leaders** to do "whatever the hell they want" to member states
that **do not pay** what he considers to be enough for
defense]{.underline}. A second Trump presidency could have dire
implications for European security.

Trump's defenders argue that he is bluffing to pressure Europe into
spending more on defense. But former U.S. officials who worked closely
with Trump on NATO during his tenure, including one of us (R.D. Hooker
Jr.), are convinced he will withdraw from the alliance if reelected.
[Trump **hugely resents** the more **moderate** advisers who **kept him
in check** during his first term]{.underline}. If he reaches the White
House in 2025, the guardrails will be off.

The U.S. [Congress]{.underline} is concerned, too. It recently [enacted
legislation to **prohibit** a president from withdrawing from NATO
unless Congress approves]{.underline}, either by a two-thirds vote in
the Senate or an act of both houses of Congress. But [Trump could
**circumvent** this prohibition]{.underline}. He has already raised
doubts about his willingness to honor NATO's Article 5 mutual defense
clause. By withholding funding, recalling U.S. troops and commanders
from Europe, and blocking important decisions in the North Atlantic
Council (NATO's top deliberative body), [Trump can **dramatically
weaken** the alliance without formally leaving it. Even if he does not
withdraw American support completely, Trump's **current position** on
NATO and his **disinterest** in supporting Ukraine, if adopted as
national policy, would **shatter European confidence** in **American
leadership** and **military resolve**]{.underline}.

EUROPE, ABANDONED

[If Trump]{.underline} is reelected and [**follows through** on his
anti-NATO instincts, the first casualty would be Ukraine. Trump has
**opposed** additional military aid to Kyiv and continues to fawn
over]{.underline} Russian President Vladimir **[Putin]{.underline}**.
NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg is already trying to Trump-proof
aid to Ukraine by coordinating it under the aegis of the alliance rather
than the U.S.-led Ukraine Defense Contact Group. [Should
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[weaken or terminate its **defense commitment** to Europe under Trump,
European countries would feel more **vulnerable** and may become
increasingly reluctant to send Ukraine their own vital military
supplies. With dramatic aid cuts, Kyiv could be forced to negotiate an
unfavorable agreement with Moscow]{.underline} that would leave Ukraine
a rump state militarily and economically vulnerable to Russia. Should
Ukraine's defenses collapse altogether, brutal repression and forced
Russification await some 38 million people.

[The disastrous consequences would only start there. A **deflated NATO**
would struggle to mount an **effective conventional deterrent** against
further **Russian aggression**. Russia is now on a **war
footing**]{.underline}, spending six percent of its GDP on defense, [and
its **authoritarian leader** is committed to an **ultranationalistic**
mission to consolidate his rule over what he calls the **"Russian
world,"** an unspecified geographic space that extends **well beyond**
his country's internationally recognized borders. Moscow could
reconstitute its armed forces relatively quickly. After **subjugating
all of Ukraine**, Putin would probably focus on the **Baltic
states**---NATO members covered by the alliance's security umbrella but
**claimed as historic Russian lands** by Putin. Should NATO's
**conventional deterrence** be **weakened** by the withdrawal of **U.S.
support**, Russia would only be **tempted** to act **more
brazenly**]{.underline}.

[NATO countries collectively now spend **two percent of GDP** on
defense, but in the absence **U.S. support**, European armies are still
**not** sufficiently prepared, equipped, and able to fight against a
major-power adversary]{.underline}. Europe remains heavily reliant on
the United States in several important areas. On its own, it lacks many
of the key tools necessary for successful defense, including airlift
capabilities, air-to-air refueling, high-altitude air defense, space
assets, and operational intelligence---these are all supplied primarily
by the United States. [**Without American help**, NATO would **lose**
much of its **military edge** over Russia. Europe's defense industry
remains **badly fragmented**, and **developing**]{.underline} the needed
defense capacities [to **compensate**]{.underline} for the loss of
American backing [could take the remainder of this
**decade**]{.underline}.

Should the United States abandon NATO, the [**erosion of nuclear
deterrence** would **severely compound** Europe's conventional
**deterrence problem**. Nuclear weapons **underpin** the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates' [**commitment** to
defend its allies and its **nuclear capabilities** form the bedrock of
NATO's **capacity for deterrence**. Should Trump **close** the American
nuclear umbrella, Europe would have to rely on **less than 600** British
and French strategic nuclear warheads, a fraction of Russia's total
force of over **5,000** strategic and]{.underline}
**[t]{.underline}**actical **[n]{.underline}**uclear
**[w]{.underline}**arhead[s]{.underline}. [Since Europe has
no]{.underline} **[t]{.underline}**actical **[n]{.underline}**uclear
**[w]{.underline}**eapon[s]{.underline}, [it can hope to deter a Russian
tactical nuclear attack **only by threatening** escalation to the
strategic level, a move that Moscow may not find **credible**. In an
attempt to **scare Europeans away** from backing Ukraine, Russia has on
many occasions hinted it might **use**]{.underline}
**[t]{.underline}**actical **[n]{.underline}**uclear
**[w]{.underline}**eapon[s]{.underline}. [Unlike the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, [France and the
United Kingdom have **not extended** their nuclear deterrent to
**protect their allies**. Should Washington leave Europe to fend for
itself, Moscow might calculate that it could **successfully resort to
nuclear blackmail** to capture the **territory** of NATO member
states]{.underline}.

[Without **U.S. leadership** in NATO, **cohesion** and unity among
members would be **difficult** to maintain. It often requires a **strong
American voice** to bring **disparate member states** to a
**consensus**]{.underline}. Since NATO's founding, a U.S. general
officer has led the organization's command structure, overseeing the
military activities of all NATO member states. [It is doubtful that
**any other country** in the alliance could play this role]{.underline}.

[NATO without the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [might limp along, but it is more likely that
the alliance would **collapse** altogether. The]{.underline}
**[E]{.underline}**uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion [is not in a position
to take NATO's place **any time soon**, as its military capabilities are
**limited** and more capable of **managing regional crises** than
fighting major wars. Even if a rump NATO survives **without** strong
American involvement, the challenges of **divided** leadership,
**inadequate** deterrence capabilities, and an **assertive** adversary
would heighten the risk of **war** with **Russia**, a major power bent
on **overturning** the]{.underline} **[l]{.underline}**iberal
**[i]{.underline}**nternational **[o]{.underline}**rder.

THE FALLOUT

[The damage would **not be limited** to Europe]{.underline}. If Trump
wants to withdraw from NATO to punish allies for their inadequate
defense spending, [why would the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [maintain its commitments to its **Asian
allies**, many of whom currently spend **even less** than NATO
countries? For now, the defense ties between the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and its allies in
Asia, such as **Australia, Japan, and**]{.underline}
**[So]{.underline}**uth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea, [are growing stronger
in the face of **Chinese** provocations. But a **lack of confidence** in
U.S. commitments may well lead some of these countries to **pursue
nuclear weapons** to offset China's and]{.underline}
**[No]{.underline}**rth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea['s nuclear advantages,
undercutting the **fragile stability** that has prevailed in the region
for **decades**. The **withering** of U.S. global leadership would also
have profoundly negative consequences in the **Middle East**, where U.S.
forces and U.S.-led coalitions are needed to deal with **terrorist**
threats]{.underline}.

[The]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates'
[**economy** might also suffer. Should a breakdown of **deterrence**
trigger a general war with Russia or China, the economic costs would be
staggering]{.underline}. Just a few Houthi fighters in Yemen have been
able to disrupt global shipping through their attacks in the Red Sea.
Imagine the consequences of a war among major powers. Moreover, trade
ties often follow security ties. Last year, two-way transatlantic trade
in goods topped \$1.2 trillion. The United States has about \$4 trillion
invested in European industry. Some five million Americans work in
European-owned industries. The United States has a huge economic stake
in maintaining a peaceful Europe.

[The]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has
been here **before**. Before **both world wars**, Washington sought
**neutrality**. Neither effort at isolationism worked and only
**prevented** the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [from being able to help deter the
aggressors]{.underline} in those wars. Eventually, the United States was
pulled into both conflicts. After World War II, having learned the
dangers of isolationism, the United States remained engaged and paved
the way for the founding of NATO and 75 years of relative peace in
Europe. The United States must not forget the painful lessons of the
last century. To do so would risk undercutting U.S. global leadership,
undermining the Washington-built international order, [and making the
world safer for **authoritarian** rule]{.underline}.

Dr. Yuval Noah **Harari 22**. PhD from the University of Oxford,
Professor in the Department of History in the Hebrew University of
Jerusalem, "The End of the New Peace",
https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/12/putin-russian-ukraine-war-global-peace/672385/

Despite these reflections, in February 2022 I was shocked when Vladimir
[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} tried to conquer Ukraine. The expected
repercussions for Russia itself, and for the whole of humanity, were so
destructive that it seemed an unlikely move even for a coldhearted
megalomaniac. Yet the Russian autocrat [chose to end the most peaceful
era in human history, and]{.underline} to [push humanity toward a new
era of war that might be worse than **anything we have seen
before**]{.underline}. Indeed, [it might [threaten the **very survival
of our species.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

This is a tragedy, especially as the past few decades have shown that
war isn't an inevitable force of nature. It is a human choice that
varies from place to place and time to time. Since 1945, we have not
seen a single case of war between great powers, nor a single case of an
internationally recognized state annihilated through foreign conquest.
More limited regional and local conflicts remained relatively common; I
live in Israel, so I know this perfectly well. But the Israeli
occupation of the West Bank notwithstanding, countries have rarely tried
to unilaterally expand their borders through violence. That's one reason
the Israeli occupation has drawn so much attention and criticism. What
was the norm for thousands of years of imperial history has become
anathema.

Even when taking civil wars, insurgencies, and terrorism into account,
in recent decades wars have killed far fewer people than suicide, road
accidents, or obesity-related diseases. In 2019, about 70,000 people
were killed in armed conflicts or police shootings, about 700,000 people
committed suicide, 1.3 million people died in road accidents, and 1.5
million people died from diabetes.

Yet peace has not been just a matter of numbers. Perhaps the most
important change in recent decades has been psychological. For thousands
of years, peace meant "the temporary absence of war." For example, in
between the three Punic Wars fought by Rome and Carthage were decades of
peace, but every Roman and Carthaginian knew that this "Punic Peace"
could be shattered at any moment. Politics, economics, and culture were
all shaped by constant expectations of war.

During the late 20th century and early 21st century, the meaning of the
word peace changed. Whereas the Old Peace meant only "the temporary
absence of war," the New Peace came to mean "the implausibility of war."
In many (though not all) regions of the world, countries stopped fearing
that their neighbors might invade and annihilate them. Tunisians stopped
dreading an Italian invasion, Costa Ricans didn't think that the
Nicaraguan army might make a dash to San José, and Samoans didn't fear
that a Fijian war fleet might suddenly emerge from beyond the horizon.
How can we tell that countries weren't concerned about these things? By
looking at their state budgets.

Until recently, the military was the expected No. 1 item on the budget
of every empire, sultanate, kingdom, and republic. Governments spent
little on health care and education, because most of their resources
went to paying soldiers, constructing walls, and building warships. The
Roman Empire spent about 50 to 75 percent of its budget on the military;
the figure was about 80 percent in the Sung Empire (960--1279); and
about 60 percent in the late-17th-century Ottoman Empire. From 1685 to
1813, the share of the military in British government expenditure never
fell below 55 percent and averaged 75 percent. During the great
conflicts of the 20th century, democracies and totalitarian regimes
alike plunged into debt to finance their machine guns, tanks, and
submarines. When we fear that the neighbors might at any moment invade,
loot our cities, enslave our people, and annex our land, that's the
reasonable thing to do.

State budgets in the era of the New Peace make for far more hopeful
reading material than any pacifist tract ever composed. In the early
21st century, the average government expenditure on the military has
been only 6.5 percent, and even the United States, the dominant
superpower, has spent only about 11 percent to maintain its supremacy.
Because people no longer lived in terror of external invasion,
governments could invest far more money in health care, welfare, and
education than in the military. Average expenditure on health care, for
example, has been 10.5 percent of the government budget, or about 1.6
times the defense budget. For many people today, the fact that the
health-care budget is bigger than the military budget is unremarkable.
But if we take the New Peace for granted and therefore neglect it, we
will soon lose it.

The new peace was the outcome of three main forces. First, technological
changes, and above all the development of nuclear weapons, greatly
increased the price of war, especially between superpowers. The atomic
bomb turned superpower war into a mad act of collective suicide, which
is why superpowers have not gone to war directly against one another
since Hiroshima and Nagasaki.

Secondly, economic changes greatly decreased the profits of war. Key
economic assets were once material resources that could be conquered by
force. When Rome defeated Carthage in the Punic Wars, it became rich by
looting its defeated rival, selling its people into slavery, and taking
over the silver mines of Spain and the wheat fields of North Africa. In
recent decades, however, scientific, technical, and organizational
knowledge have become the most important economic assets in many places.
Silicon Valley has no silicon mines. Trillion-dollar businesses such as
Microsoft and Google are built on what's in the minds of engineers and
entrepreneurs rather than what's in the ground under their feet. And
whereas seizing silver mines by force is easy, you cannot acquire
knowledge that way. This economic reality led to a sharp decline in the
profitability of conquest.

Although wars over material resources continue to characterize certain
parts of the world---such as the Middle East---the big economies of the
post-1945 period grew without imperial conquest. Germany, Japan, and
Italy saw their armies broken and their territories shrink---but after
the war, their economies boomed. The Chinese economic miracle was
achieved without engaging in any major war since 1979.

As I was writing these lines in early November, Russian soldiers were
looting the Ukrainian city of Kherson, sending back to Russia trucks
full of carpets and toasters that they'd stolen from Ukrainian homes.
This will not make Russia rich, and it will not compensate the Russians
for the enormous cost of the war. But as Putin's invasion of Ukraine
proves, technological and economic changes by themselves were not enough
to produce the New Peace. Some leaders are so power-hungry and so
irresponsible that they might begin a war even if it is economically
ruinous to their country and pushes the whole of humanity toward nuclear
Armageddon. Accordingly, the third essential pillar of the New Peace has
been cultural and institutional.

Human societies were long dominated by militaristic cultures that viewed
war as inevitable, and even desirable. Aristocrats in both Rome and
Carthage believed that military glory was life's crowning achievement
and the ideal route to power and riches. Artists such as Virgil and
Horace concurred, devoting their talents to singing of arms and
warriors, glorifying bloody battles, and immortalizing brutal
conquerors. During the New Peace era, artists turned their talents to
exposing the horrors of war, while politicians sought to leave their
mark by initiating health-care reforms rather than by looting foreign
cities. Leaders throughout the world---influenced by the fear of nuclear
war, by the changes in the nature of the economy, and by new cultural
trends---joined forces to build a functioning global order that allowed
countries to develop peacefully while restraining the occasional
warmongers.

This global order has been based on liberal ideals, namely, that all
humans deserve the same basic liberties; that no human group is
inherently superior to all others; and that all humans share core
experiences, values, and interests. These ideals encouraged leaders to
avoid war and instead work together to protect our common values and to
advance our common interests. The liberal global order linked the belief
in universal values to the peaceful functioning of global institutions.

Although this global order was far from perfect, it improved the lives
of people not just in the old imperial centers such as Britain and the
United States, but also in many other parts of the world, from India to
Brazil and from Poland to China. Countries in all continents benefited
from the rise in global trade and investments, and almost all countries
enjoyed a peace dividend. Not only could Denmark and Canada shift
resources from tanks to teachers---Nigeria and Indonesia did the same.

Anyone who rants about the defects of the liberal global order should
first answer one simple question: Can you please name the decade in
which humankind was in better shape than in the 2010s? Which decade is
your lost golden age? Is it the 1910s, with the First World War, the
Bolshevik Revolution, Jim Crow, and European empires brutally exploiting
much of Africa and Asia? Is it perhaps the 1810s, with the Napoleonic
Wars reaching their bloody climax, Russian and Chinese peasants crushed
by their aristocratic overlords, the East India Company securing its
control of India, and slavery still legal in the United States, Brazil,
and most other parts of the world? Perhaps you are dreaming of the
1710s, with the War of the Spanish Succession, the Great Northern War,
the Mughal succession wars, and a third of children everywhere dying
from malnutrition and disease before reaching adulthood?

The new peace didn't result from some divine miracle. It was achieved by
humans making better choices and building a functioning global order.
Unfortunately, too many people took this achievement for granted.
Perhaps they assumed that the New Peace was guaranteed mainly by
technological and economic forces, and that it could survive even
without its third pillar---the liberal global order. Consequently, that
order was first neglected and then attacked with growing ferocity.

The attack started with rogue states such as Iran and rogue leaders such
as Putin, but by themselves, they were not strong enough to end the New
Peace. What really undermined the global order was that both the
countries that benefited most from it (including China, India, Brazil,
and Poland) and the countries that built it in the first place (notably
the U.K. and the United States) turned their backs on it. The Brexit
vote and the election of Donald Trump in 2016 symbolized this turn.

Those who have challenged the global liberal order mostly didn't wish
for war. They just wanted to advance what they understood as the
interests of their country, and they argued that each nation-state
should defend and develop its own sacred identity and traditions. What
they never explained was how all of these different nations would deal
with one another in the absence of universal values and global
institutions. The opponents of the global order did not offer any clear
alternative. They seemed to think that somehow, the various nations
would just get along fine, and the world would become a network of
walled-but-friendly fortresses.

Fortresses are seldom friendly, however. Each national fortress usually
wants a bit more land, security, and prosperity for itself at the
expense of its neighbors, and without the help of universal values and
global institutions, rival fortresses cannot agree on any common rules.
The network-of-fortresses model was a recipe for disaster.

And disaster was not long in coming. The pandemic demonstrated that in
the absence of effective global cooperation, humanity cannot protect
itself against common threats such as viruses. Then, perhaps because he
observed how COVID further eroded global solidarity, Putin concluded
that he could mete out the coup de grâce by breaking the biggest taboo
of the New Peace era. Putin thought that if he conquered Ukraine and
absorbed it into Russia, some countries would gasp in disbelief and
condemn him---but nobody would take any effective action against him.

The argument that Putin was pushed unwillingly to invade Ukraine to
preempt a Western attack is nonsensical propaganda. Some vague Western
threat is not a legitimate excuse for destroying a country, looting its
cities, raping and torturing its citizens, and inflicting untold
suffering on tens of millions of men, women, and children. Anyone who
believes that Putin had no choice should name the country that was
preparing to invade Russia in 2022. Do you think the German army was
massing to cross the border? Do you imagine that Napoleon got out of his
grave to lead the Grande Armée yet again to Moscow, and Putin had no
choice but to preempt the imminent French onslaught? And remember that
Putin actually first invaded Ukraine back in 2014---not in 2022.

Putin prepared his invasion for a long time. He never accepted the
breakup of the Russian Empire, and he never saw Ukraine, Georgia, or any
of the other post-Soviet republics as legitimate independent nations.
Whereas---as noted earlier---average military expenses have been about
6.5 percent of government budgets around the world and 11 percent in the
United States, in Russia they have been far higher. We don't know
exactly how much higher, because it is a state secret. But estimates put
the figure somewhere in the vicinity of 20 percent, and it may even be
more than 30 percent.

[[If Putin]{.mark}'s gamble **[succeeds]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark}
[the [result will be]{.mark} the **[final collapse of the global
order]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and of the New Peace.]{.underline}
[**[Autocrats around the world]{.underline}** [will
learn]{.underline}]{.mark} [that [**wars of conquest** are]{.mark} again
[possible]{.mark}, and **[democracies]{.mark}**, too, [will]{.mark} be
**forced to [militarize]{.mark}** themselves for protection. We've
already seen Russian aggression prompt countries such as Germany
to]{.underline} sharply [increase their defense budget overnight, and
countries such as Sweden to reinstate conscription]{.underline}. [The
money that should go to teachers, nurses, and social workers will
instead go to tanks, missiles, and cyberweapons]{.underline}. At 18,
young people all over the world will do their mandatory military
service. **[The [whole world will look like
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}**---a country with an oversize army and
understaffed hospitals. [A new era of [**war**, **poverty**,
and]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[disease]{.underline}** [will
result]{.underline}]{.mark}. [**[Alternatively]{.underline}**, [if Putin
is]{.underline} **[stopped]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[and
punished]{.underline}**, [[the global order]{.mark} **won't be broken**
by what he did]{.underline}---[it [will be
**strengthened**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Anyone who needed a **reminder**
would rediscover that **you just cannot do these things.**]{.underline}

[Which of these]{.underline} two [scenarios will materialize? Luckily
for everyone, despite his military preparations, Putin was disastrously
unprepared]{.underline} for one crucial thing: the courage of the
Ukrainian people. [The Ukrainians have pushed back the Russians in a
series of stunning victories near Kyiv]{.underline}, Kharkiv, and
Kherson. But Putin has so far refused to acknowledge his mistake, and he
reacts to defeat with increased brutality. Seeing that his army cannot
overcome the Ukrainian soldiers on the front line, Putin is now trying
to freeze the Ukrainian civilians to death in their homes. Predicting
how the war will end is impossible, as is the fate of the New Peace.

History is never deterministic. After the end of the Cold War, many
people thought that peace was inevitable, and that it would continue
even if we neglected the global order. After Russia invaded Ukraine,
some swung to the opposite view. They claimed that peace had always been
just an illusion, that war was an ungovernable force of nature, and that
the only choice humans had was whether they wanted to be prey or
predator. Both positions are wrong. [War and peace are
decisions]{.underline}, [not inevitabilities. Wars are made by people,
not by a law of nature]{.underline}. And [just as humans make wars,
humans can also make peace]{.underline}. But to make peace is not a
one-off decision. It's a long-term effort to protect universal norms and
values, and to build cooperative institutions. [Rebuilding the global
order doesn't mean going back to the system that disintegrated in the
2010s]{.underline}. A new and better global order should give more
important roles to non-Western powers that are willing to be part of it.
It should also recognize the salience of national loyalties. The global
order disintegrated above all because of the assault of populist forces,
which argued that patriotic loyalties contradict global cooperation.
Populist politicians preached that if you are a patriot, you must oppose
global institutions and global cooperation. But there is no inherent
contradiction between patriotism and globalism, because patriotism isn't
about hating foreigners. Patriotism is about loving your compatriots.
And [in the 21st century]{.underline}, **[[if you want to
protect]{.mark} your compatriots]{.underline}** [[from]{.underline}
**[war]{.underline}**,]{.mark} **[pandemic]{.underline}**[,
[and]{.underline} **[ecological collapse]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [the
[best way]{.mark} to do that is [by]{.mark}
**[cooperating]{.mark}**]{.underline} with foreigners.

Political Consultations

**[[NATO partners]{.mark} are [calling for more frequent political
consultations]{.mark} in flexible formats [on topics of]{.mark} [global
interest]{.mark}]{.underline}**, such as China's rise and relationship
with Russia, emerging technologies, 26 Strategic Perspectives, No. 40
[climate change, the global commons, and shocks to the international
system]{.underline} such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in
Ukraine. Trends and shocks such as these make the Alliance's cooperative
security agenda not only more complex but also more important. This is
especially true in a competitive environment in which [[partners]{.mark}
are [not]{.mark} entirely [clear]{.mark} whether or [what role]{.mark}
[NATO aspires to play when its security interests]{.mark} and values
[are challenged]{.mark} outside NATO territory and when its partners are
attacked or rendered vulnerable]{.underline} by China's actions, wider
climate or food insecurity, or other developments.102

It has become clear NATO's regional groupings for political
consultations are outdated. A Ukrainian interlocutor mentioned that the
EAPC continues to meet, for example, but that "concrete deliverables
have been fewer and fewer since 2014."103 There is no equivalent format
for the Indo-Pacific, but findings suggest that formalizing a similar
structure for the Asia-Pacific Four, for example, which some in the West
have recommended, could be counterproductive.104 A New Zealand official
noted that the "AP-4" is not a structure those partners would have come
up with on their own,105 and academics generally agree that more
flexible formats and dialogue with existing regional groupings, whether
the QUAD, the Association of South-East Asian Nations (ASEAN), or with
emerging trilaterals, would be more appropriate.106 They argued that
bilateral consultations still offer value in steering the region toward
a more unified regional threat assessment. NATO might invite Japan and
South Korea for Enhanced Opportunities Partnerships, as Dan Hamilton
recommends,107 or set up a Center of Excellence in the region,108 but
should engage existing structures in the region.

NATO partner states are [[eager for more robust and reciprocal
discussions]{.underline}]{.mark}, too, especially on topics such as
China's rise and its regional and global implications, and the
Alliance's aspirations when it comes to competing with China. China's
rise in Asia renders NATO's partnerships more complicated in some ways,
both because some partners may not be willing to engage in cooperation
that could be understood as antagonistic toward China and because some
will not want to be pushed into a position of having to choose a side.
This is particularly true of IndoPacific partners, but it is also true
of European partners like Serbia and, potentially, of other NATO
partners that maintain a neutral or nonaligned political and/or military
tradition. That said, partners like Japan are still looking for a
broader "chorus of voices" that offers alternative models and narratives
to what China presents for the region.109 Of course, Indo-Pacific
partners appreciate thatEuropean allies are limited in what they can
bring to the Pacific in terms of capabilities, but their voices in
international forums, combined with symbolic efforts such as sailing
naval vessels through the region, strengthen this chorus. 27

Priorities for NATO's Partnerships [[NATO and partners]{.mark} in both
the Euro-Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific [share concerns about]{.mark}
China's military modernization, regional [maritime claims]{.mark},
investments and theft of [technology]{.mark} and [infrastructure, and
cooperation with Russia. They also have specific national
dependencies,]{.mark} political [circumstances,]{.mark} and
sensitivities [that must be understood and managed in]{.mark} political
[consultations.]{.mark}]{.underline} This is especially true as allied
positions on China have hardened since 2020. Initially hopeful that NATO
could pursue common interests with China in counterpiracy or climate
change, the 2021 NATO summit communiqué described China as a
"destabilizing force and systemic challenge, whose actions threaten the
rules-based international order."110 [Equipping NATO for strategic
competition]{.underline} with China (and Russia) [requires more than
shoring up its military capabilities and technological edge.
[Like-minded]{.mark} [partners]{.mark} engaged in this study are
[requesting]{.mark} that [NATO consult more frequently]{.mark}, better
understand regional and geopolitical sensitivities, [and **prepare to
engage in a supporting role.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Political consultations]{.mark} help [manage expectations]{.mark} on
both sides, [clarify]{.mark} European strategic
[interests]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Indo-Pacific region that are
distinct from those of the United States, [and [establish "rules of the
game"]{.mark}]{.underline} for cooperating with China while protecting
strategic assets and infrastructure.111 Both sides are juggling a need
for outside investment with a list of concerns arising from China's
investments in infrastructure, digital information, and communications
systems. [They are also dealing with cyber attacks, espionage, and
concerns about China's cooperation with Russia.]{.underline} This
nascent but growing cooperation takes place in the Indo-Pacific and in
Europe, where China's military engagement remains limited to exercises
in the Mediterranean and port calls to Kaliningrad, but where their
cooperation on Arctic raw materials or dual-use technologies could have
more important strategic consequences.112

### Impact\-\--Consensus\-\--2NC

#### Strictly adhering to the [consensus]{.underline} principle is key to keep NATO [adaptable]{.underline} to emerging [global threats]{.underline}. 

**Traugutt '16** \[Loren; July 1; MS in Strategic Intelligence from the
National Defense Intelligence College, MBA from the University of
Phoenix, Fellow at the US Army War College, BS from Kansas State; NATO
Defense College Research Reports, "Is Consensus Still Necessary Within
NATO?" https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep10296\]

The "consensus rule" or [[the **"consensus principle"** has been the
**cornerstone** of NATO's]{.mark} decision-making [process]{.mark} since
the signing of the Washington Treaty in 1949. The idea that **[all
decisions]{.mark}** reached within the Alliance [must be
**agreed**]{.mark} **upon** [by all **member**]{.mark}
nation**[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} is not directly mentioned in the
Washington Treaty, or anywhere else in official NATO documents, but it
[has been the "**sole basis** for decision-making in NATO since the
creation of the Alliance in 1949."]{.underline}2 [Consensus is **not**
just required for the **most important** decisions within
the]{.underline} North Atlantic Council ([NAC), but also
**throughout**]{.underline} the structure of [the
organization]{.underline}, including every committee and working group.
While [[**sticking** steadfastly]{.mark} to the consensus rule
[gives]{.mark} the Alliance a **[cred]{.mark}ibility** [on the **world
stage**]{.mark} not seen by any other alliance in history]{.underline},
many experts and critics argue that this decision-making process should
be reconsidered and adjusted. They argue that as the Alliance continues
to grow and expand its geographical focus outside traditional European
borders, the use of the consensus rule must be scrapped to keep the
Alliance agile and adaptable.

This paper will argue to the contrary, that [[**keeping** the]{.mark}
consensus [rule in its **current form** is **instrumental**]{.mark} in
keeping the Alliance credible both for the members and [for those
**outside**]{.mark} **the Alliance**. NATO remains a **strong** and
**viable** security arrangement **because** of the consensus
rule]{.underline}, not in spite of it. The treaty does not specify how
the Alliance should make decisions, except for Article 10 which states
that "unanimous agreement" is required to invite new members into the
NATO Alliance.3 Beyond this clear directive on decision-making, the rest
of NATO's decision-making process was left by the founders of the
Alliance to determine for themselves. While decision-making through
consensus is nothing new within alliances and organizations, its sole
use in determining all decisions at all levels of an organization is
unique. Numerous other international organizations, such as the United
Nations, the World Trade Organization, the European Union and the
International Monetary Fund, utilize the consensus principle as part of
their decision-making process, but none of them use it as their sole
process.4

Despite a growing Alliance where reaching consensus will become harder
and harder, [keeping NATO's current "consensus rule" is
**[paramount]{.mark}** for the Alliance [to maintain]{.mark} its
**legitimacy** and [influence **throughout** the]{.mark}
ever-**[changing]{.mark}** **global security
[environment]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

As described on the NATO website, "All NATO decisions are made by
consensus, after discussion and consultation among member countries. A
decision reached by consensus is an agreement reached by common consent,
a decision that is accepted by each member country ... \[an\] expression
of the collective will of all the sovereign states that are members of
the Alliance. This principle is applied at every committee level and
demonstrates clearly that [NATO decisions are **collective decisions**
made by its member countries]{.underline} ... The consensus principle
applies throughout NATO."5

Three times in its history NATO has undergone a thorough review of its
committee organization and structure. The first took place in 1990
following the end of the Cold War, again in 2002 following the 9/11
terror attacks, and the most recent review was in June 2010.6 In all
three instances, the Alliance retained the principle of consensus
decision-making, applying it within every committee and working group at
all levels of NATO.

Importance of the Consensus Rule in its Current Form

[Making decisions through **[consensus]{.mark}** provides **enormous
advantages** within the context of the global security environment. When
28 members of a global Alliance achieve consensus on decisions that
affect global security and politics, the [effects are
**profound**]{.mark}. Consensus ensures that with every decision, all 28
members of the Alliance are **behind** that decision]{.underline}. It
does not necessarily mean, nor does it have to mean, that all 28 members
are fully supportive of the decision, but [it still [provides]{.mark} a
**[great]{.mark} deal of [legitimacy]{.mark}** to the Alliance's
actions]{.underline}. Only through consensus can an alliance ensure that
all its members remain sovereign and autonomous, not having to
compromise on their national views or interests.

[The consensus rule]{.underline} also [[ensures]{.mark} that
members]{.underline} of the Alliance [maintain a **[continuous
dialogue]{.mark}** over a variety of broad security issues. This
[**prevents** every]{.mark} new [issue]{.mark} that emerges [from
being]{.mark} treated as "an **independent**, **[disconnected zero-sum
discussion]{.mark}** ... allow(ing) for the **give-and-take** of
negotiations and compromises across the **range of
issues**."]{.underline}7 Even the smallest member of the Alliance has
the same equal voice as the largest member, ensuring a coherent balance
among the many diverse nations of the a-Alliance, and that all national
interests are taken into equal consideration.

#### An [adaptable]{.underline} NATO built around [robust consultation]{.underline} prevents a [range]{.underline} of [existential threats]{.underline}.

The daily picture of a NATO that is deploying new forces in its eastern
member states, holding major exercises, [[combating
**cyber**]{.underline}]{.mark} threats [and **[terror]{.mark}**ism,
conducting training and]{.underline} capacity-building [missions
in]{.underline} places like [[**Afghanistan** and
**Iraq**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and welcoming new members into its ranks
will stand in baffling contrast to a political and academic rhetoric
that presents NATO as obsolete and Allies as a drain on resources for
little return. In short, the optimists will not see the need for the
Alliance's reform, while the pessimists will not deem it possible. As so
often in the past, [it [will come down to]{.mark}]{.underline} a choice
between actions and words, and what most determines [[NATO's
**cred**]{.mark}ibility]{.underline} in the long run. If the glass is
equally half full and half empty, then both sides are right and we are
no further forward.

Yet to repeat this somewhat sterile discussion on the occasion of NATO's
70th anniversary would be a lost opportunity -- perhaps even a historic
mistake. Because to claim that all is well or not well with NATO is to
distort reality and to miss the point.

Yes indeed, the Alliance is not faring so badly when we consider the
criticisms and doubts affecting so many of the other institutional
pillars of the post-war international order. Finding good news stories
about NATO is not difficult, and the frustrations of the last two NATO
summits belie an impressive record of concrete achievements. Taken
together they show just how committed to NATO its 29 members still are
-- in cash, capabilities and troops as well as speeches.

But without lapsing into facile crisis constructs, we also need to face
up to the fact that [the [Alliance is]{.mark} today operating in the
**most complicated security environment** in its history. It is
[facing]{.mark} a **[more diverse]{.mark}** spectrum of
**[threats]{.mark}**]{.underline} than ever before. Certainly, these may
not be as existential as the threat of nuclear holocaust during the Cold
War but [they are]{.underline} nonetheless [severe and, [if not
mastered, could **end**]{.mark} **the liberal democratic
[societies]{.mark}**]{.underline} and individual freedoms that the
citizens of NATO countries today take for granted.

[The 21st century is the century of turbulence with **great power
competition**]{.underline}; rising military spending and readiness to
threaten or use force; rapid and far-reaching **[technological
innovation]{.underline}**, which is putting greater disruptive and
destructive capability into the hands of more bad actors; and hybrid
campaigns to divide and destabilise western societies, and gain leverage
over their political and economic systems. More than before, the Allies
are being challenged from within and without their borders and from
multiple directions at the same time. Death by a thousand cuts may not
sound as bad as sudden death but the result is still the same.

Challenges on all fronts

For most of the past decades, NATO had the relative luxury of dealing
with one challenge in one place at any given time. It marked its 40th
anniversary focused entirely on the changes affecting the Soviet Union;
its 50th anniversary was in the midst of the Kosovo air campaign; and
its 60th anniversary was dominated by discussions over troop surges in
Afghanistan. But [**this time** it is **different**. NATO is reaching 70
when it has to tackle]{.underline} not one but [three strategic
fronts]{.underline}, not only **[diverse]{.underline}** geographically
but also [in terms of the **type of threats** they pose and the
**responses** they require]{.underline}.

In the East, a resurgent and aggressive Russia has made NATO's eastern
Allies nervous and requires the Alliance, after a nearly 30-year gap, to
be able to deter, defend against and defeat a peer adversary with
modernised forces, abundant war-fighting experience and high-tech
weaponry.

In the South, [[**fragile states** are vulnerable]{.mark} to extremism,
militias and criminal gangs, which pose a range of security headaches
ranging [from **terror**]{.mark}ist attacks [to]{.mark} **humanitarian
crises** and **[uncontrolled migration]{.mark}**]{.underline}. These
require local knowledge, development and long-term capacity-building
partnerships with multiple actors.

On the home front, we see the polarisation of many western societies as
they struggle to control the dependencies created by globalisation.
Moreover, all-embracing technologies have given malicious actors a new
hybrid toolkit to either wreak havoc or to assert influence.

These challenges affect Allies in different combinations and come from
different sources. But all Allies expect NATO to be equally attentive to
their individual concerns and to provide answers. [What is
unique]{.underline}, therefore, [about the situation [NATO]{.mark} finds
itself in [today]{.mark} is that it **[risks]{.mark}** becoming
**unmanageable**. One danger is **strategic
[overload]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Another is that poorly managed crises
on the home front or a failure to establish deterrence against
provocations such as cyber or chemical attacks, which fall below the
threshold for Article 5 (NATO's collective defence clause), could
embolden adversaries to make territorial demands as well. Equally,
allowing those adversaries to quash human rights and to sow corruption
and poor governance in the South -- all in the name of re-establishing
"order" -- could encourage them to try the same tactics in the
Alliance's eastern neighbourhood.

So, for the first time in its seven decades, NATO has to deter and
defend against the enemy within as well as without. As we saw after the
9/11 terrorist attacks against the United States, from now on, Article 5
could well apply more to threats against transport, power
infrastructure, space communications, pipelines, IT networks and
civilians sitting on park benches than to tanks crossing borders.
Solidarity will no longer be a rare requirement waiting for a military
attack that is potentially catastrophic but extremely unlikely. Rather,
it will be an almost daily necessity in response to provocations that
are not existential but which civilised societies cannot allow to go
unchallenged.

This is fundamentally new and the most pressing issue that Allied
leaders need to debate, if they wish NATO to have a future at least as
long as its past. Instead of preparing for one kind of attack, how does
the Alliance make its member states (and some key partner countries too)
fully resilient and able to respond effectively to the 21st century's
pattern of hyper-interference and ubiquitous competition?

This is not to imply that the topics which dominate NATO's current
political agenda are not important. Burden-sharing is at the centre of
US President Donald Trump's view of the utility of the Alliance to the
United States and any future US Administration, whether Republican or
Democrat, is likely to insist on it too. The speech given by Secretary
of Defence Robert M. Gates in Brussels in 2011 came from a Democrat
Administration and -- in its sharpness and sense of urgency about
European capability gaps --prefigured the Republican Trump half a decade
before the latter entered the White House.

The United States' share of the burden of collective defence or, more
recently, non-Article 5 operations beyond NATO's territory has always
been disproportionate and unfair. Prolonged European dependence on the
United States was one major reason why some US Senators wanted to limit
the lifespan of the NATO Treaty to just ten years, when it came up for
ratification in 1949. The Europeans have constantly promised to rectify
the discrepancy through a host of burden-sharing and offset initiatives,
and failed to do so. As Europe became richer and aspired to be treated
as an equal actor on the global scene, its inability or unwillingness to
provide for its own defence became ever more incomprehensible.

So, rather than resent the current return of the burden-sharing debate,
Europeans should perhaps congratulate themselves on their good fortune
that Canada and the United States have been willing to underwrite
Europe's defence in peacetime for longer than any of NATO's founding
fathers would have thought possible -- or desirable. Simply put,
Europeans need to increase their defence budgets to two per cent of GDP;
not because the United States demands this as a precondition for
sustaining NATO but because Europeans are living in an increasingly
rough neighbourhood with multiple threats. In these circumstances, two
per cent will give Europeans the capabilities required so that they do
not need to make hard choices between deterring Russia or fighting
extremists in the Sahel; or fielding high readiness divisions over
developing more robust cyber defences and researching the emerging
technology areas of artificial intelligence, robotics and hypersonic
rockets.

Now that the Defence Investment Pledge, agreed at the 2014 NATO Summit
in Wales, has halted the decline in defence spending and led to real
increases, the Allies clearly have to maintain this effort. But they
also need to develop a narrative that explains the link between money,
capability and security. Headline figures can seem somewhat arbitrary.
An extra 100 billion dollars by 2020 is a lot of money but NATO also
needs to show the public what this means in terms of actual improvements
in equipment, readiness and training, and focus more on the national
success stories.

Capabilities that address threats such as cyber, military interference
with vital space assets, terrorism, border security, data manipulation,
the protection of critical infrastructure and crucial supply chains, and
humanitarian crises engendered by extreme weather events may resonate
more with the public than traditional hard military items such as tanks
and artillery. This argues for NATO's defence planners to take a broad
view of capability requirements. The two per cent should be a target for
the European Union as well as for NATO. Because if the United States
were one day to turn its back on NATO or limit its engagement only to
territorial collective defence vis-à-vis Russia, two per cent would be
the minimum for European Strategic Autonomy to have any meaning.
Consequently the Defence Investment Pledge needs to move progressively
from an effort largely driven by the United States to one that Europeans
demand of each other.

This said, the function of NATO is not primarily to be about fairness.
Equal benefits for equal contributions. Outputs -- the benefits gained
from being an Ally -- will always be more significant than inputs. What
counts is that individual inputs maximise collective impact. The
diversity of Allies (big and small, with different assets and networks
of influence) means that they will always contribute in different ways.

The role of NATO must be to incentivise activity and find ways to
combine different contributions for maximum strategic effect. This is
more effective than formulating standardised contributions, which could
make NATO too strong in certain domains and too weak in others. As NATO
tackles 21st century challenges, a broad and diverse spectrum of
different assets, skills, knowledge and capabilities will arguably be
the Alliance's comparative advantage over its adversaries. Russia with
its largely military power and strategy based on intimidation is a case
in point. But it will not be enough to acquire diverse assets --NATO's
challenge is to learn how to use them.

[It is in this connection that I see four areas where the [Alliance
needs to **raise its game**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Scanning the risk horizon

[The [first]{.mark} is the need for **[more discussion]{.mark}** among
Allies on the trends and events shaping the future of
security]{.underline}.

China, for instance, will have a massively greater impact on
international relations in the 21st century than Russia -- and in very
different ways. It is already pulling ahead in the defining technologies
of artificial intelligence and bioengineering as well as in 5G
connectivity, which will drive the Internet of Things. It is increasing
its investments in Africa, Europe and the Middle East, and sending more
of its troops to United Nations peacekeeping operations. Already, as
Allies discuss the wisdom of allowing Huawei into their future IT
networks, they see that China could divide them while Russia generally
tends to unite them.

As the Chinese model will be the main competitor to liberal democracy, a
key question will be how the Allies handle the rise of China. It is not
a question of seeing China as the next military threat but how best to
understand it and engage it. Perhaps the time has come to create a
NATO-China Council or at least a regular strategic dialogue. Past
cooperation on countering piracy together in the Gulf of Aden or helping
the United Nations and African Union with capacity building show the
potential of NATO-China relations. For a starter, NATO should appoint a
senior diplomat or official to focus on China and develop the network of
contacts with the People's Liberation Army and the civilian leadership.

Apart from China, other key issues need to be on the Alliance's agenda
more systematically. For instance, while NATO is developing a space
policy, the Alliance still has not declared space as a domain or looked
seriously at its growing dependency on space assets for navigation,
timing, tracking and targeting. Yet 58 nations have now put satellites
in orbit and most space-enabled services, which NATO is dependent upon,
are dual use (civil/commercial and military). The growth of missile
defence, hypersonic missiles, drones and data processing, not to mention
early warning capabilities and cyber security, will make space ever more
contested. Satellites will be more vulnerable to manipulation,
disruption and destruction, and the outcome of conflict will
increasingly depend on who makes best use of space. This is the reason
why the United States has recently stood up a Space Force and is
planning for a Space Command.

Other issues deserving more attention are Russia's role and influence
beyond Europe, especially in Africa and the Middle East, and the
emerging role of actors such as India, Iran and Saudi Arabia. But it is
not only traditional states with traditional capabilities that are
transforming the nature of security. Equally important questions to
address include: How will the decisions of big tech companies shape and
control the future of the Internet and social interaction? How will
ISIS/Daesh regroup and define a new business model post-Caliphate? Or
how is organised crime undermining governance and fuelling corruption?

[NATO [**cannot** rely on **infrequent**]{.mark} ministerial
[meetings]{.mark} or **occasional** briefings from national diplomats
passing through Brussels. [A]{.mark} recent [crisis like]{.mark} that
between **[India and Pakistan]{.mark}** in Kashmir [shows]{.mark} just
[how **quickly** events]{.mark} can [**spin out of control** and have
**global**]{.mark} **security [implications]{.mark}**[. NATO needs
to]{.mark} think how it can **[better align]{.mark}** its **situational
awareness** and **[consultation machinery]{.mark}** with the fast-moving
and unpredictable security environment. It cannot be **perceived** as an
organisation dealing **narrowly** with a limited set of issues and only
in its immediate neighbourhood]{.underline}.

Deterring hybrid threats

The second area where the Alliance needs to raise its game is deterrence
against threats below the Article 5 threshold. Hybrid warfare is complex
because the dividing line between legal and illegal activity is a fine
one. Where do normal business transactions become hostile state
interference? How can we prevent adversaries from using against us the
technology we ourselves have invented? Some commentators have declared
that deterrence cannot work against hybrid threats because they are
multifaceted and simply exacerbate the polarisation and divisions that
are already so prevalent in our societies.

Certainly, there is no easy and immediate fix to deterrence in the
hybrid domain, such as the acquisition of a nuclear weapon to neutralise
an opponent's nuclear capability. Indeed, deterrence by denial or
depriving the adversary of the fruits of aggression through resilience
and speedy recovery is the starting point. Yet the response to the
Russia-sponsored chemical attacks in Salisbury one year ago showed the
range of other measures that can be taken. The perpetrators were named
and shamed through the disclosure of intelligence material; there was a
coordinated expulsion of a large number of Russian diplomats; NATO and
the European Union pulled together and both organisations initiated a
review of their preparedness and response assets against chemical and
biological attacks.

In sum, deterrence can be gradually built up against hybrid campaigns by
credible attribution of the source; naming and shaming; proportionate
responses that do not escalate but show that hybrid attacks will be
consistently answered and in a collective and united way. It is also
essential to identify and plug vulnerabilities in NATO's spectrum of
critical infrastructure in both the physical and virtual domains. These
responses will contain an element of trial and error, as the Alliance
sees what works best in inducing an adversary to think again. They will
also necessitate the development of a playbook of measures -- both
existing and new -- and learning how to apply them in targeted ways,
whether against states or the proxies they employ.

Crucially, NATO will need to develop a culture of permanent
responsiveness, reliable intelligence and the ability to take lots of
small decisions regularly and early, rather than big decisions rarely
and late. But to the extent that NATO can operate more effectively at
the sub-Article 5 level, it is less likely to have to face contingencies
above that threshold in the future.

Rebuilding partnerships

The third area that the Alliance needs to pay more attention to is
partnerships. One of NATO's biggest success stories, since the end of
the Cold War, has been to induce around 40 other countries to form
structured partnerships with it. These have been based on mutual
benefit. Partners have contributed troops to NATO-led operations, while
having access to a multinational forum to exchange views and develop
practical cooperation on shared security concerns. Partnering with
Allies has made their own role in international security more
substantive. Interoperability has been as much intellectual as military
and practical. Partners have been attracted to the Atlantic Alliance as
a community of democracies, while strengthening NATO's
**[legitimacy]{.underline}** in the United Nations and the wider world.
In short, a win-win outcome. But this [is now in **danger** of being
**lost** as the Alliance's priorities shift and the focus swings back to
collective defence]{.underline}.

Bright hopes were once invested in the Euro-Atlantic Partnership
Council. [Now, [consultation is **ad hoc**]{.mark}]{.underline} and
other partnership frameworks, such as the Mediterranean Dialogue or the
Istanbul Cooperation Initiative, need re-energising and a greater sense
of purpose. Beyond a limited number of individual partnerships, such as
with Sweden and Finland, NATO has not articulated an overall vision for
partnership. [Yet, in a world where multilateralism is under threat,
[this]{.mark} network [is]{.mark} a **[precious]{.mark} asset** [and
needs to be **revived**]{.mark} before it **atrophies**]{.underline}.

One answer is to take up the debate on norms where partnership was
acquiring a reasonable track record, for instance, in finding common
ground on advancing the women, peace and security agenda, the role of
private security companies, and the protection of civilians and
combatting trafficking. The current security environment badly needs new
norms on challenges like cyber, autonomous weapons systems, social media
and GPS interference and space satellites, to name but a few. NATO is
not necessarily the place where norms should be formally negotiated but
it can be a useful forum for separating the good ideas from the bad,
building consensus and convening the players, including non-governmental
organisations and the private sector, around the same table.

At a time when so much of NATO's image is bound up with ever higher
defence budgets and more high-end military capabilities, rebuilding
partnerships can help reassure our publics that the Alliance has a
political and not exclusively military approach to security.

Encouraging European defence

Finally, the Alliance needs to get to grips with the issue of European
defence. From the very beginning of NATO, a fault line has run through
the Alliance as to whether it should encourage or discourage a
specifically European (and now EU) defence identity.

In the early 1950s, US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles threatened
the Europeans with "an agonising reappraisal" if they did not create
more European (and especially German) divisions. The result was the
European Defence Community (EDC), which failed in the French National
Assembly in August 1954.

Over 60 years later, the debate on whether there should be a European
Army or a European Strategic Autonomy continues unabated. Some want the
greater European capabilities without the separate institutions; others,
the institutions without worrying too much about the extra capabilities.
At one moment, the case is made that a European defence construct is
needed as a hedge against US disengagement. At another moment, it is
seen as a way to strengthen the Alliance and the transatlantic
partnership by overcoming the fragmentation of European defence budgets
and procurement programmes, and producing more bang for the euro through
more cooperative programmes.

For many decades, this effort has been stymied by the inconsistent
attitude of the United States (do we support it and, if so, under what
conditions?) and divisions among the Europeans themselves (can we
develop a common culture when it comes to the use of force and how can
this effort serve all of us, rather than the individual agendas of one
or two key EU member states?).

But today we are at a critical juncture. The European Union has launched
a series of initiatives that are the most far-reaching since the demise
of the EDC and which put structures and resources behind the
aspirations. We have Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) with 34
multinational projects; a European Defence Fund with an initial
capitalisation of 13.5 billion euros; and a European Intervention
Initiative to foster a common strategic culture on power projection and
mission planning. French President Emmanuel Macron has proposed a
European Security Council and the consolidation of the European Union's
defence and technology industrial base. Yet, we also have Brexit and the
challenge of keeping the United Kingdom as a key Ally firmly embedded in
European defence across the whole spectrum, from intelligence and police
cooperation to combat brigades.

Consequently, the task for NATO is how to encourage but help steer these
European initiatives. Of course, unnecessary duplication should be
avoided. But the priority must be to relieve the pressure on the United
States by enabling the Europeans to take on collective defence missions
at the high end within the NATO framework; better support stabilisation
in Africa and the Middle East; define the scope of EU solidarity in
responding to events like cyber and terrorist attacks or natural
disasters (articles 42.7 and 222 of the Lisbon Treaty); and spend
defence euros to greater effect through the integration of effort and
more investments in cutting-edge technology.

Essentially, NATO will need to hammer out a new transatlantic bargain:
one in which the United States accepts the reality of EU defence
integration and ceases to see it as a competitor or threat to NATO; and
one in which the EU countries deliver on their capability promises and
pursue their efforts in a way that strengthens NATO's overall capacity
to address the challenges to the East and South as well as hybrid
threats. For this, the European Union will need to be generous towards
the non-EU Allies on the basis of close association in return for
significant contributions to these efforts. EU defence aspirations will
not go away but neither will NATO. It is the task of this generation of
political leaders to finally bring them together.

The 70th anniversary of the Alliance will produce plenty of pieces on
NATO's past achievements and many messages of esteem and commitment.
That is all to the good. Yet, the anniversary is also the opportunity
for some **[political [recalibration]{.mark}]{.underline}** that [[can
make the Alliance **successful** for the **next**]{.mark} **seven
[decades]{.mark}**. It is an **opportunity** that should **not be
missed**]{.underline}.

## Solvency 

### Solvency\-\--2NC

#### Unilateral actions in the Arctic [fail]{.underline}, BUT NATO involvement [solves]{.underline} through [robust norm-setting]{.underline} and ability to prevent a [security dilemma]{.underline} by communicating with [Russia]{.underline}.

//aka *\*\*FYI: this card says that some Arctic policy could lead to
worsened militarization/security dilemma and that NATO should seek to
prevent that 🡪 probably provides a say no warrant for some affs...\*\**

Following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the conclusion of the
Cold War, the Arctic served as a region free from geopolitical
challenges and military tensions.This allowed the Arctic states --
Canada, Denmark, Norway, the United States, and Russia -- to focus on
diplomatic cooperation and nonmilitary security challenges. Since the
1980s however, transformative physical-environmental changes across the
Arctic threaten to destabilize regional relationships and heighten the
possibility of a serious crisis or conflict. These changes are altering
the region's longstanding geopolitical and economic character, as new
development and investment opportunities open up in areas without
clearly defined international rules and norms. In response to these
developments, Russia seeks to take advantage of the relative deficiency
of international law to carve out a hegemonic position in the Arctic,
leaning on its military presence and unrivaled ice-breaker fleet to
pursue its interests. This article will explore what role the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) can play in the Arctic to ensure
stability, and whether it can establish international rules and norms in
the face of growing Russian militarization.

**[THE CASE FOR NATO]{.underline}**

Currently, [the [Arctic lacks a single]{.mark} comprehensive [governance
regime focused on regional security]{.mark} issues, making the
[management of]{.mark} the [region's]{.mark} rapid [transformation a
major challenge for]{.mark} the Arctic [states.]{.mark}]{.underline}
While the [[Arctic Council]{.underline}]{.mark} has "promoted
cooperative governance in the region,"1 its [flexible structure and
legally non-binding norms are [insufficient to ameliorate]{.mark} the
[governance gap]{.mark} in the long-term. **The [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates presently [lacks]{.mark} crucial [capabilities
and]{.mark} regional [leverage to]{.mark} keep pace with the rate of
transformation to [provide]{.mark} regional
[stability.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Compounding the issue, "the rest of
the Arctic states\...cannot by themselves balance competing great powers
in the region."2 To ensure that the Arctic remains a domain built on
cooperation and diplomacy, [the West needs to commit to a coherent
security strategy]{.underline} to address growing competition and
uncertainty. [Otherwise, they risk having insufficient means to regulate
interstate relations or deconflict geopolitical tensions.]{.underline}

[[NATO has]{.mark} a [**significant interest** in]{.mark} preserving and
[enhancing]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark}'s rules-based
[order]{.mark}]{.underline}, which includes open access to global sea
lines of communication, protecting transatlantic communications cable
networks, and preventing Russia from exercising unilateral military
control of the region. In the pursuit of these interests,
**[[NATO]{.mark} is the [ideal candidate to promote regional stability
and norm-setting due to]{.mark} its foundational [principles,]{.mark}
strategic [mission]{.mark}, multilateral [authority, and defensive and
deterrence capabilities.]{.mark}]{.underline}** NATO was founded in part
as a norm-building institution, to promote European security and
stability through the development and formalization of political
relationships between states both inside and outside of the alliance.3
[By including the Arctic in NATO's purview the alliance [can use]{.mark}
its [norm-building role to impress rule of law]{.mark} and promote the
peaceful settlement of disputes.]{.underline} Moreover, the current NATO
strategy incorporates a 360-degree approach that seeks to "acknowledge
and address threats and challenges from diverse actors and from all
directions."4 It is through this approach that NATO expanded its purview
to include Eastern Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. As Russia
continues its military modernization efforts in the Arctic, concerns
over instability and geopolitical competition grow. [A **[strategic
reorientation]{.mark}** toward the polar region would serve as a
[legitimate progression for NATO]{.mark}, given five of the eight
internationally recognized Arctic states are members of
NATO.]{.underline} To be certain, NATO could wield immense multilateral
authority in a region which is strategically important to Euro-Atlantic
security.5 Ultimately, [NATO's defense and deterrence capabilities
provide **the most compelling justification** for it to [counter
Russia's]{.mark} expansive militarization [efforts]{.mark} in the
Arctic, enabling it to strengthen the region's rules-based order. For
NATO, "Russian militarization risks transforming Arctic relations, and
\[the alliance\] will not want to be left unprepared."6 In this case,
diplomacy may prove ineffective and legal ambiguity could incentivize
Russian revisionism.]{.underline}

BACKGROUND

The Arctic's physical transformation over the last forty years has
created new opportunities for development and investment, and greater
access to Arctic shipping routes such as the Northwest Passage and the
Northern Sea Route. Indeed, the Arctic has experienced a period of
warming and declining sea ice coverage, with "climate change expected to
lead to a nearly ice-free Arctic Ocean in late summer and increased
navigability of Arctic marine waters by the middle of this century."7 At
present, approximately three-quarters of summer sea ice has been lost.8
These changes bring new commercial opportunities, such as new fishing
stocks, access to untapped resources, and shorter commercial travel
times between Europe and Asia.9 In fact, the Arctic is estimated to
contain 25% of the world's oil and gas reserves, some 90 billion barrels
of oil and 1,700 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.10 These
opportunities have piqued many non-Arctic states' interests. China looks
to capitalize on them with renewed regional investment and increased
diplomatic presence.

Most concerns regarding an 'Arctic Scramble' are misleading, as "many of
the \[untapped\] resources lie uncontested, well within the lands and
waters of the Arctic states'"11 exclusive economic zones. These
exclusive economic zones, governed by both the United Nations Convention
on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the Arctic Council,12 are essential
to the diplomatic management of territorial claims in the Arctic.
[However, overlapping territorial claims and ambiguous legal authorities
pose significant challenges to continued cooperative governance in the
region.]{.underline} The most widely known example of this regional
challenge are the ongoing territorial boundary disputes between Russia,
Denmark, and Canada over the Lomonosov Ridge, an underwater continental
ridge dividing the Arctic into two oceanic basins. Yet even this is
being resolved diplomatically, as most disputes over Arctic maritime
boundaries have been resolved peacefully.13 However, within this realm
of established international law, where disputes are settled through
negotiation, lie [[legal ambiguities]{.underline}]{.mark} which [[could
be exploited by Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Specifically, the [ambiguous legal status of Svalbard]{.underline} is
one of the most concerning issues for NATO in the Arctic. Svalbard, a
collection of Norwegian islands located approximately 500 nautical miles
off the northern coast of Norway, is governed by a legal framework that
generates significant ambiguity and uncertainty as to which states have
the legal authority to control activities on the island.14 In 1920, the
Spitsbergen Treaty granted Norway sovereignty over Svalbard, however, it
granted "the citizens of each party to the treaty 'equal enjoyment' and
'equal liberty of access' to the islands." 15This left Svalbard under
the authority of Norway but allowed dozens of states unrestricted access
to the archipelago and its resources. This ambiguity in the law became
apparent when former Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dimitry Rogozin
visited Svalbard in 2015. Norway had imposed a travel ban on Rogozin
following his involvement in Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014,
making his presence undermine Norway's assertion of control and
authority over the archipelago.16

Understanding that Russia has a history of exploiting "gray areas, where
the rules and norms are less defined," Svalbard's ambiguous
international legal status makes it a potential target for Russian
revisionism.17 Russian officials express contempt for the way the
archipelago's governance was determined, citing its exclusion from the
1920 treaty talks. Moreover, Moscow views the archipelago as part of its
national identity, as an estimated 10-20% of Svalbard's population are
Russian citizens whose presence dates back to the 1500s.18 Given
Russia's interest in Svalbard's rich oil reserves and fishing stocks,19
and recent annexation of Crimea, [there is concern Russia could make a
nationalistic appeal to exploit the archipelago's ambiguous legal status
and secure its interests on the islands.]{.underline}20

Norway has made repeated attempts to consolidate its jurisdictional
authority over Svalbard, including efforts to establish its own
exclusive economic zone around the archipelago.21 European countries,
including several NATO members, responded with intense objection.22 NATO
members remain divided in their positions concerning Norway's legal
authority over the islands, and as a result, [Svalbard could undermine
NATO cohesion and become a source of division should Russia attempt to
seize control.23 **[Without]{.mark} a clear consensus and
[united]{.mark} Western [front, Moscow could determine]{.mark} the
[risks of a NATO]{.mark} military [response]{.mark} for reclaiming the
archipelago [are minimal.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[NATO's concerns include additional challenges. Russia has developed
high-end maritime capabilities and increased its presence in the Arctic
as part of a broader military strategy]{.underline}, outlined in
Russia's 2014 military doctrine and 2015 maritime doctrine.24 Russia
maintains two strategic goals in the North Atlantic and Arctic Region:
"protect Russia's nuclear deterrent forces in the Barents Sea" and
"project power and fulfill Moscow's global ambitions."25 To pursue these
goals Russia has implemented an immense military modernization program,
which included creating or reopening 14 operational airfields and 16
deepwater ports in the Arctic, establishing an Arctic Command and two
Arctic Brigades, and constructing newly refitted submarines for its
Northern Fleet.26 Russia's armed forces continue to conduct regular
naval exercises and patrols in the Arctic, and expand their
trans-regional radar systems and radio-electronic jamming
capabilities.27, 28 Together, these investments and capabilities are
essential to Russian Arctic dominance, increasing their capacity to
control the region's maritime domain.

This build-up of military capabilities and infrastructure in the Arctic
underscores the geostrategic importance of the region and its vast
energy resources for Russian security and economic development. [As
[Russia]{.mark}'s naval nuclear capability is [intended to "phase NATO
out of \[the\] Arctic,"]{.mark}29 the [importance of]{.mark} a
[NATO]{.mark} security strategy for the Arctic is [underscored.]{.mark}
As it stands NATO has no formal role in the Arctic, though it did
reaffirm its commitment to the region during the 2016 Warsaw Summit
Communiqué:]{.underline}

"In the North Atlantic, as elsewhere, the Alliance will be ready to
deter and defend against any potential threats, including against sea
lanes of communication and maritime approaches of NATO territory. We
will further strengthen our maritime posture and comprehensive
situational awareness." 30

In line with this position, NATO reinstated naval patrols in the North
Atlantic to deter Russian aggression, while NATO Arctic states invested
in greater ground-based surveillance, early warning, and ballistic
missile defense systems for the region.31, 32 Additionally, the United
States responded by recommissioning its navy's Second Fleet to operate
in the North Atlantic and Arctic, placing American forces in Iceland,
and finalizing plans for the construction of new icebreakers.33 These
efforts on their own do little to resolve the challenge of preserving a
stable, rules-based regional order in the face of Russian
militarization. A comprehensive, overarching strategy is needed.

NATO's strategic approach to the Arctic must strike the right balance
for the various members of the alliance, as they lack a crucial
consensus on the scope and character of their involvement in Arctic
regional security.34 Notably, Canada would prefer that NATO maintain a
minimal role in the Arctic, concerned that anything more would dilute
the influence and authority of Arctic states over regional security
issues and "would afford non-Arctic NATO countries influence in an area
where they otherwise would have none."35 This is misguided, as Denmark,
Norway, the United States, and Canada itself have failed to counter
Russian militarization or promote international norms and rules on their
own. Norway would prefer that NATO take a significantly larger role in
the region, as the country perceives Russia as a major threat and the
Arctic to be a critical vulnerability in NATO's defenses. For Norway,
the Russian annexation of Crimea was a wake-up call, and as a result, it
initiated its own military modernization program with the acquisition of
submarines and fighter jets, and recommissioning of military bases.36
Norway also hosted 2018's Exercise Trident Juncture, NATO's largest
military exercise since 2002.37 Norway understands that the alliance
wields significant institutional power and authority capable of
addressing a challenge of this scope and scale.

[Finally, it is important to note that there are no multilateral forums
or institutions dedicated to addressing hard security issues in the
Arctic region. Both the Arctic Council's and the Barents Euro-Arctic
Council's organizational purviews intentionally exclude military
matters, while NATO primarily keeps out of Arctic matters in
consideration of its Arctic member states.38 **Therefore, [efforts
to]{.mark} [strengthen NATO's role in the Arctic must address this
critical security gap.]{.mark} Otherwise, NATO risks triggering a
regional security dilemma.** The build- up of security forces and
bilateral tension between two or more actors in the international system
as a response to perceived aggression or growing insecurity may generate
a security dilemma that could devolve into mutual hostility and
conflict. Neither NATO nor Russia want conflict in the Arctic.
Consequently, bridging the dialogue gap would serve to reduce
misperception, build trust, and demonstrate peaceful
intentions.\]{.underline}

This section aims to briefly discuss the consequences for the
transatlantic alliance of the unilateral decision by the Trump
administration to withdraw American troops from Afghanistan. The new
Biden administration only postponed the implementation to withdraw the
last American soldier until 31 August 2021. [The US decision to pull out
after 20 years of war in **Afghanistan** was taken without
**consultations** with the European NATO allies. The American decision
was "a **blow to European prestige**" as the mission was **perceived**
as "NATO's **most legitimate mission**, the one that was most
**central** to our understanding of ourselves]{.underline}," it was
argued by Constanze Stelzenmüller of the Brookings Institution (Tharoor,
2021b). Benjamin Haddad, director of the European Center at the Atlantic
Council, stated: "The recent week is a real trauma in Berlin and London.
[It **signals a shift in priorities** for the US that runs **deeper**
than the presidential personalities and rhetoric]{.underline}" (Tharoor,
2021b).

[To many European decision‐makers, the American behavior suggested that
the difference was negligible between "**America First**" and a "foreign
policy for the middle class."]{.underline} It is important that around
70% of the Americans supported the withdrawal of US combat troops from
Afghanistan. The figure reflected the attitudes immediately before the
messy withdrawal from Kabul. The chaotic withdrawal did not change the
American opinion figures to any significant degree (Edwards‐Levy, 2021;
Smeltz et al., 2021b).

The withdrawal came 20 years after the US launched its unilateral
invasion of Afghanistan in October 2001. The European NATO members soon
after deployed troops in the multilateral International Security
Assistance Force (ISAF) mission invoking Article V in the NATO treaty
(Olsen, 2020, p. 62; Sperling & Webber, 2011). ISAF was deployed to
defend Afghan government institutions and to carry out
institution‐building or state‐building. To a large extent, these goals
were undermined by the unilateral American policy focusing on fighting
al‐Qaeda and terrorism (Carati, 2015, p. 215; Garey, 2020, pp.
214--220). [The outcome was not just poor coordination but also a **lack
of communication**. These challenges sometimes resulted in **open
conflict** between the US‐led mission and the ISAF because there was
**no agreement** about what the **goals** of the Western engagement in
Afghanistan were]{.underline} (Carati, 2015, pp. 203, 207; Sperling &
Webber, 2011, p. 355).

[NATO members]{.underline} are preparing for their Warsaw summit in
July, where they [will try to recalibrate the alliance's position
vis-à-vis an **assertive** and increasingly confident Russia that
continues its **military** provocations, **nuclear messaging**, and
nuclear **modernization**. The allies must find answers to a perennial
question: How can non-nuclear states in extended deterrence
relationships be **assured** of the **credibility of American
commitments** to protect them? How can allied leaders be **convinced**
that security through U.S. extended deterrence will continue to be in
their interests, even if it means **strategic dependency**?]{.underline}

Today, [U.S. extended deterrence commitments have **returned to center
stage**, particularly in the context of **NATO**. The containment of
**Russian aggression** in Europe is likely to remain a key challenge, as
is the push to convince Russia of the West's deep-rooted interest in
**strategic stability**. It would provide a worthwhile orientation for
defense officials NATO member states to step back]{.underline} from the
busy preparations for Warsaw [to think in time about the alliance's
experiences with **nuclear consultation**. In doing so they will better
understand that there is much to gain if the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and its allies put
new emphasis on confidential, high-level, and **substantive
consultations** on nuclear **deterrence** in peacetime]{.underline}.

New historical insights on the basis of [recently **declassified files**
show that genuine nuclear consultation was **essential** to assuring
non-nuclear NATO allies during the **Cold War**]{.underline}The adoption
of the Provisional Political [Guidelines]{.underline} for the Initial
Tactical Use of Nuclear Weapons by NATO (PPGs) in 1969 represents an
exemplary case. This process [illustrated that **allied engagement** in
building and formulating **consensus** on nuclear weapons employment
**doctrine** to implement **NATO strategy** was eminently important in
assuring U.S. allies]{.underline}.

The benefits of nuclear consultation cannot be appreciated without
reference to six key facts.

First, extended deterrence is a surprising success story. The system
appears to have deterred the Kremlin during the Cold War, even if
confirmation remains impossible. As a result, [U.S. allies continue to
feel that U.S. nuclear protection is their **least worst
option**]{.underline}.

Second, confirming a widely held assumption, [U.S. extended deterrence
is a **necessary condition** for maintaining the **non-nuclear status**
of many U.S. allies and thus a **pillar** of the **global nuclear
order** and the]{.underline}
**[N]{.underline}**on-**[P]{.underline}**roliferation
**[T]{.underline}**reaty regime. Extended deterrence served as a key
component of Washington's vigorous and multifaceted efforts since the
Second World War to [curtail the **proliferation of nuclear
weapons**]{.underline}.

Third, assurance of non-nuclear allies in extended deterrence
relationships is a very demanding and occasionally exhausting task.
Assurance can never be achieved in absolute terms.

Fourth, extended deterrence is premised on power asymmetries between the
protector and the protected. The latter are dependencies, or
protectorates, who can pass the buck for their security to the
protector. Structurally, the protector favors preserving these power
asymmetries, despite its reflex to push allies toward greater burden
sharing.

Fifth, extended deterrence is costly. It calls for constant assessment
of its requirements and involves some form of non-rationality on the
part of U.S. allies because there is no such thing as a "U.S. nuclear
guarantee." There exists a powerful American commitment to protect
others with nuclear weapons, but, as James R. Schlesinger put it, the
likelihood of an American nuclear response is "certainly not a hundred
percent."

Finally, extended deterrence is a risky policy. It necessitates
risk-taking and risk-manipulation by the protector and by demand of the
protected. If the threat to the protected increases, the protector faces
pressures to engage in greater risk-taking, which can also result in
greater risk to its own security. The historical record is full of
examples of the tendency for allied demands for U.S. actions to deter a
common opponent such as Russia by nuclear threats which exceed not only
the level and scope of what the United States deems necessary to protect
itself, but also of what Washington deems necessary to protect allies.
In the run-up to NATO's double-track decision of 1979, for example, the
United Kingdom and West Germany pushed a reluctant U.S. government to
agree to the deployment of Pershing II missiles and ground-launched
cruise missiles in Europe because these missiles provided a means to put
targets in the Soviet Union at risk, in contrast to, say, battlefield
nuclear weapons.

Former British Defense Secretary Denis Healey exaggerated this
phenomenon of disproportionate deterrence/assurance thresholds: "[It
takes only five per cent credibility of American retaliation to deter
the Russians, but **ninety-five** per cent credibility to reassure the
Europeans]{.underline}." This "Healey theorem" should not be taken at
face value. It banalizes the problem of allied assurance needs because
non-nuclear allies appear more unwitting than they are. It also nurtures
the insinuation that non-nuclear allies are almost eager for nuclear
war.

As the Warsaw Summit approaches, [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [needs to be
**mindful** of pressure from weaker allies, particularly those located
in close vicinity to danger, to make the U.S. manipulate risk to a
greater extent than the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [deems necessary from a **deterrence
perspective**]{.underline}. Yet Washington must tread carefully, for
applying the brakes too sharply can make effective assurance difficult
or impossible.

The [importance of nuclear **consultation** in peacetime as a tool to
assure allies is probably much greater today]{.underline} than it was
during the Cold War.

First, during the Cold War, American national security elites thought
that the protection of Western Europe against large-scale military
aggression and potential Soviet hegemony was a vital interest. Nowadays,
there is consensus that the likeliest challenge to extended deterrence
in Europe is posed by potential instability in Eastern Europe and
aggression against the Baltics, for which NATO is now inadequately
prepared, despite improvements within the alliance since the 2014 Wales
Summit.

The new need to think harder about limited war, including limited
nuclear war, implies a need to rethink how to make nuclear threats
credible to deter aggression against U.S. allies. These threats have to
be made credible because they are not directly related to the protection
of the continental United States. Nuclear consultation will be an
indispensable tool for this task.

Second, the nuclear portion of the U.S. military footprint in Europe is
only a shadow of what it was during the Cold War. The Obama
administration has committed to maintain and extend the service life of
the U.S. nuclear capability in Europe, the B61 bomb. But it objected to
addressing yawning asymmetries in the nuclear balance vis-à-vis Russia
in non-strategic nuclear capabilities and very low-yield nuclear
weapons. At the same time, the current U.S. military footprint in Europe
is not unbearably weak, but might become so as a consequence of an
unprecedented change in U.S. foreign policy according to America First
thinking.

Nowadays, the size of the U.S. nuclear arsenal in Europe is less
important in reassuring allies than it was during the Cold War. Still,
it is unclear whether large asymmetries in non-strategic nuclear forces
can be destabilizing.

Since the end of the Cold War, [nuclear consultation within **NATO**
contributed greatly to the cultivation of **restraint** and allied
**confidence** on the basis of a residual Europe-based U.S. nuclear
capability **amid decreasing reliance** on nuclear weapons]{.underline}.
Recently, [allied consultations about nuclear deterrence were
instrumental to facilitate consensus about the remaining U.S. **nuclear
posture** in Europe, which figures as "a **core component** of NATO's
overall capabilities" for assurance and deterrence
purposes]{.underline}. In striking contrast, these consultations did not
provide a means to disarm the U.S. nuclear footprint in Europe by
disentangling allied perceptions of U.S. resolve from U.S. nuclear
capabilities. Still, some commentators continue to advocate the
withdrawal of the remaining U.S. nuclear weapons from Europe in the
post-Crimea environment. Others respond with convincing arguments that
such move would be destabilizing and traumatize European allies in the
current security environment.

History shows that confidential, high-level, and [substantive nuclear
consultation in peacetime provided a means to fortify the **political
acceptability** and **strategic credibility** of U.S. extended
deterrence from the point of view of **non-nuclear
allies**]{.underline}. Former British Minister of Defense Denis Healey
put it this way behind closed doors within the NATO Nuclear Planning
Group in 1969:

### Solvency\-\--Laundry List\-\--2NC

#### Solves a laundry list of impacts.

partnerships in a contested world," Atlantic Council,

//ff\]

Over the next twelve months, the allies will negotiate a new Strategic
Concept that adapts NATO's core tasks---collective defense, crisis
management, and cooperative security---to this contested environment. It
will be informed by the NATO 2030 Report, which characterized China as a
full-spectrum rival and offered recommendations to strengthen NATO's
political dimensions and extend its global reach. The next Strategic
Concept presents an opportunity to breathe new life into cooperative
security by steering cooperation with non-member states toward these
challenges. [NATO should **double down** on what
works---capacity-building---while expanding **political consultations**
with partners and forging new frontiers in **science and technology**
cooperation]{.underline}.

NATO's Partnerships programs [have provided options for cooperation with
**non-member states** for more than twenty-five years. They've proven
remarkably **flexible and adaptable**, serving partners' as well as
NATO's evolving interests. They helped consolidate **democratic
transitions** in Europe, provided support for NATO-led **missions and
operations**, and strengthened collective **defense and
deterrence**]{.underline}. Through Partnerships for Peace, NATO offers a
menu of more than 1,400 activities open to all forty partner states
around the world. [Partners choose the scope, focus, and intensity of
their cooperation with NATO]{.underline}. The arrangement has appealed
to a diverse group of states, which NATO organized into the
Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council, the Mediterranean Dialogue, the
Istanbul Cooperation Initiative, and Partners Across the Globe.

In the current environment, however, [there is **mounting pressure** to
adapt partnerships to ensure they continue to support NATO's interests.
The **patchwork** of geographic groupings is **increasingly
incongruent** with today's challenges. The groups have generally
**failed** to promote **security cooperation** or **political
consultations** at the regional level. They have also inhibited NATO's
**ability to set priorities** or steer cooperation with partners towards
its own objectives. Moreover, the activities that partner states value
most---**capacity-building** and **interoperability**, or the ability to
link up their forces with NATO's and act **coherently**---remain
underfunded. As NATO reorients to incorporate **China** into a broader
strategic calculus, how can NATO preserve what works for partners and
adapt its partnership policies without defaulting to a
**one-size-fits-all** approach?]{.underline}

First, NATO should ensure that capacity-building and additional
resilience support remain priorities. [China is using its economic
leverage to expand its security cooperation, and Beijing, along with
Russia, is **undermining Alliance credibility**. Some partners have
become testing grounds for **hybrid attacks**]{.underline}.
Capacity-building helps counter that by strengthening partner
institutions and resilience, and a sense of shared security. The
Partnership Interoperability Initiative protects hard-earned
interoperability with some partners, and the Defence and Related
Security Capacity Building (DCB) Initiative already supports Georgia,
Iraq, Jordan, Moldova, and Tunisia. The NATO Parliamentary Assembly has
recommended more attention to Ukraine, the Western Balkans, and areas
with weak institutions or where democracy is undermined. Civil emergency
planning through NATO's Euro-Atlantic Disaster Response Coordination
Centre is also valuable.

Capacity-building programs are also a path to NATO interoperability for
partners, which remains a major driver for cooperation with NATO---even
among neutral countries that may never contribute to a NATO military
operation. This is because [NATO provides **internationally recognizable
military standards** and the ability to plug-and-play into]{.underline}
**[E]{.underline}**uropean **[U]{.underline}**nion (EU),
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[N]{.underline}**ations, [or other
multilateral operations]{.underline}. NATO interoperability
certification is in demand among partners, as are its robust programs
for education, training, and exercises. These activities promote defense
and security sector reform, [strengthening **institutions** and
transparency]{.underline}. NATO should [work to overcome constraints on
partner participation in exercises, especially for
**Japan**]{.underline}, **[So]{.underline}**uth **[Ko]{.underline}**rea,
**[Australia]{.underline}**, [and **New Zealand**. Cooperative security
depends on NATO's **centrality** as an **international
standard-setter**, a position that cannot be taken for
granted]{.underline}.

Second, [NATO should **accelerate internal consultations** on China and
bring partners in early and often on topics of mutual concern, ensuring
NATO **decision-making** is informed by partners in the earliest stages.
This has worked well with **Sweden** and **Finland**, but it should work
better with]{.underline} NATO's [**Indo-Pacific** partner
states]{.underline}, those along China's Belt and Road Initiative, [and
those with high-end **cyber** or **space** interests]{.underline}. The
old geographic boundaries are being redrawn around these issues. NATO
should work to better define mutual expectations and goals with partners
and leverage natural groupings around cross-cutting challenges, perhaps
by expanded use of 30+N arrangements or revised "framework nation"
models, to bypass the gridlock of regional mechanisms. Daniel Hamilton
of Johns Hopkins' School of Advanced International Studies recommends
offering Enhanced Opportunities Partnerships to Japan and South Korea in
an effort to improve interoperability, information-sharing, and
political consultation.

Finally, [NATO should forge new frontiers in **science and
technology**]{.underline} (S&T) [cooperation with partner states and the
EU]{.underline}. The Alliance has interests in achieving dominance in
Emerging Disruptive Technologies (EDTs) and in setting norms and
standards for their incorporation into militaries. [NATO boasts
**renowned research universities** and innovation hubs]{.underline}, but
so do partner states like Sweden, Finland, Japan, and South Korea, for
example. NATO should expand support for S&T collaboration with these
partners and others through the Science for Peace and Security Programme
(SPS). NATO should also explore other avenues to expand research
collaboration with select partners and share lessons learned from
public-private partnerships. [Partners already stand
shoulder-to-shoulder with NATO on **cybersecurity**]{.underline}, for
example, and should be brought into S&T Board and other discussions
where possible. A more ambitious NATO-EU relationship in this area would
be a force multiplier.

NATO also has a related interest in leading the global mission to ensure
that EDTs are integrated into modern militaries in ways that are
consistent with its values and with the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights and United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. So far, the
Alliance's Advisory Group reports that NATO's EDT strategies are focused
internally on harnessing member states' strengths and building a
cohesive Alliance innovation ecosystem that is buttressed by talent
development and novel financing initiatives. NATO is expected to release
an artificial intelligence (AI) and big data strategy this summer, the
first of seven EDT strategies, and it should outline a broader vision
that links NATO's innovation ecosystem with those of its partners.
[Partners and other like-minded states around the world are already
**looking to NATO** for guidance on **AI**, codes of conduct for
military activity in **outer space**, and standard-setting for
**cybersecurity**]{.underline}, for example.

Looking ahead, NATO partnerships will remain demand-driven, but they
should adapt to serve NATO as it grapples with China's rise while still
addressing myriad other challenges. The next Strategic Concept will
update the Alliance's approach to cooperative security. NATO should set
a higher level of ambition for partnerships and fund them so that they
continue to appeal to such a diverse group of states around the world.
Expanding capacity-building to include more resilience support remains
paramount, but [accelerating **political consultations** and forging
ahead with ambitious]{.underline} S&T [**cooperation** are also
important. Failure in these areas risks allowing NATO partnerships to
languish and fade into **irrelevance** at a time when the Euro-Atlantic
community most needs a **wider network of partners** to face a contested
world order]{.underline}.

Only a few days after the announcement of the nuclear submarine deal,

was announced **without prior consultation** with France or the EU. The
new pact **upset the EU** camp, and the fact that Brexit‐Britain had
been invited to participate in the new defense arrangement was seen as
**provocative**]{.underline}. Similar to the case with the nuclear
submarine deal, [the AUKUS was a **bitter blow** to France, the only EU
member state with a **permanent military presence** in the
Indo‐Pacific]{.underline} (Lau et al., 2021). [The AUKUS could be
interpreted as **another reminder** of how Washington's interests
**diverged** from the Europeans', with the EU being **relegated to a
secondary position**]{.underline} in the Indo‐Pacific (Heisbourg, 2021,
pp. 51--53; Tharoor, 2021a). On the other hand, the unilateral American
initiatives were a sign of the increasing American frustration with the
EU's softer approach to China (Lau et al., 2021, p. 2).

NATO's Competitors

[NATO's most immediate adversary in the region is the Russian
Federation.]{.underline} Despite being only one of eight Arctic
countries, Russia controls roughly 53% of the Arctic coastline. They
consider the Arctic their core territory and have been hesitant to work
with others on regional projects. Russia has its own ambitious Arctic
policy where it aims to become the pivotal power in the region. Russia
plans to achieve this through expansive infrastructure and development
projects with the final goal of gaining access to strategically
important resources both on land and in the Arctic Sea. A secondary aim
of the policy also seems to be to improve the Northern Sea Route, making
Russia a key player in trade between Asia and Europe. [If fully
realized, this would improve Russia's strategic position even further
and leave most of Europe vulnerable to potential future Russian
sanctions.]{.underline}

The region is also home to most of Russia's nuclear-powered vessels
including its two Kirov-class battlecruisers, all its nuclear
icebreakers, and eight out of eleven active ballistic missile submarines
(SSBNs). This means much of its second-strike capabilities are located
in the Arctic, mostly around the Kola peninsula in north-western Russia.
Such a large force presence in the Arctic gives Russia significant
strategic advantages, including the ability to project power and
influence in the region and to potentially control key sea lanes and
shipping routes. Areas like the strategically important GIUK gap could
be left severely vulnerable if these forces are not properly monitored.

A second competitor that has started to dip its toe into the Arctic is
China. Despite holding no Arctic territory, China has persistently
pursued active participation in Arctic affairs. Since 2013, China has
been an observer state to the Arctic Council and has participated in the
Arctic Circle forum since its inception. U.S. scholars have noted that
China is actively building up its capacity to "enforce its perceived
rights and protect its interests through an increasingly
security-focused Arctic strategy that is backed up by the military."
Multiple NATO member states have raised concerns over China's high
aspirations in the region, singling them out as a threat to Arctic
stability. The country even considers itself to be a "near-Arctic power"
that deserves equal representation and status to the United States and
Russia in Arctic affairs.

**[[No country]{.mark}, even the United States, [wants to face]{.mark}
these [competitors alone.]{.mark} This is where the unified Arctic
Command comes in.]{.underline}**

NATO's Interest in the Arctic

The Arctic is fast becoming a new hotspot for geopolitics. The region
has historically been free from conflict, even during the Cold War. This
is no longer the case. [With the potential ascensions of Sweden and
Finland into the Alliance, **[seven out of]{.mark} the [eight Arctic
countries]{.mark} will be [NATO]{.mark} [member
states]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} This doesn't necessarily make
the Arctic NATO's backyard, but [it is definitely in NATO's
neighborhood.]{.underline} The Alliance has been making a note of this,
as member states have paid more attention to the region in recent years
at both the national and international levels. Last year, for example,
saw the United States re-designate its U.S. Army Alaska Command to be
upgraded to division level, the 11th Airborne Division, along with the
NATO Secretary General making a dedicated visit to the Canadian Arctic
for the first time.

[NATO's interest in the Arctic is twofold: proximity and
deterrence.]{.underline} The Arctic has two main sea lanes of entry and
exit, through the North Atlantic between Greenland, Iceland, and Norway,
and the Bering Strait between Russia and Alaska. [Entering through
either of these means passing through NATO territory, highlighting the
[region's proximity to member nations and **strategic importance for
NATO.**]{.mark}]{.underline} The region is becoming increasingly more
accessible to both Arctic and non-Arctic countries due to melting sea
ice, which is opening up new shipping routes and easing access to
natural resources such as oil, gas, and rare earth minerals. This has
increased interest and competition in the region, giving NATO a reason
to bolster its own regional presence to monitor the situation.

[NATO's more prevalent interest in the Arctic is
deterrence]{.underline}, primarily aimed at Russia. As interest in the
region has increased, Russia has been more aggressively asserting its
claims in the region and increasing its military activities. This is
most frequently done through airspace violations, naval encroachment,
and intelligence gathering. Although these efforts are understandable to
an extent, NATO should not let them pass. [These [aggressions]{.mark}
are [mainly aimed at NATO member states]{.mark}, which need to develop
an effective counter. This would be the Arctic Command's primary goal in
the region, to counter Russian aggression and deter them from further
encroachment, provocations, and other antagonistic actions.]{.underline}
Some may see this approach as escalatory but we must keep in mind that
the individual Arctic countries are already doing this at a smaller,
national level. [[Enhancing]{.mark} the [scope]{.mark} of these sorts of
actions will [send a message to Russia]{.mark} and other actors [about
how committed NATO is to]{.mark} respect for territorial integrity and
security in the [Arctic.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Arctic Command Structure

The Arctic Command would primarily consist of naval and air assets
stationed in and around the Arctic Circle. The Command would be
headquartered out of two locations, one in Alaska and another in either
eastern Greenland, northern Iceland, or Norway. Additional bases strewn
around the Canadian Arctic, Norway, Alaska, and Greenland would also
fall under the Command's control. The main tasks of the Command would be
naval patrolling, submarine monitoring, intelligence gathering, and air
policing along with secondary tasks such as search and rescue as needed.
[It would also serve to [ensure]{.mark} the [interoperability of NATO
forces]{.mark} stationed [in]{.mark} the [Arctic]{.mark}, acting as the
**[main voice of Arctic affairs]{.mark} in the Alliance** [at the
**tactical level.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

The goal of the [[Command]{.mark} would]{.underline} be to [better
**[coordinate activities, actions, and responses]{.mark} to developing
situations** in the Arctic on both sides of the ocean [and]{.mark} to
[streamline]{.mark} the [flow of Arctic-related information]{.mark}
between allies]{.underline}. Arctic-specific training, especially at
sea, would also be an important aspect of the Command. Its structure
would closely follow that of NATO's Maritime Command, incorporating
elements from the Allied Air Command as well.

Through the Arctic Command, [[**NATO** would **consolidate**]{.mark}
multinational [security concerns regarding the region and
facilitate]{.mark} a **[coordinated and collaborative decision-making
process]{.mark}** for member states to resolve them.]{.underline} This
[cooperation could even extend to collaborative efforts **outside the
Alliance**]{.underline}, such as joint resolutions on the Arctic Council
and scientific research initiatives. Additionally, [the
mere]{.underline} existence of the Command and [presence of NATO
personnel in the region would [hold]{.mark} **[significant]{.mark}
[influence]{.mark}** [and send a **strong message**]{.mark} to the
Alliance's adversaries.]{.underline} Although NATO would always seek a
diplomatic solution first, the Alliance needs to be able to credibly
enforce a coherent Arctic policy that respects the international rule of
law and institutional norms. For this, the Arctic Command is a perfect
tool.

Conclusion

[The need for a **unified and NATO-led Command in the Arctic** has
become evident in the past few years.]{.underline} As adversaries gain a
foothold in the Arctic, [[NATO needs to **take the initiative**]{.mark}
and develop the necessary capabilities to operate in the region for a
prolonged period of time.]{.underline} The harsh climate calls for
specialized training, outfitting of equipment, and enhanced cooperation
over a vast operational theater. [**[Alone, NATO's Arctic member states
stand no chance]{.mark} of safeguarding their individual interests in
the region.** Unified, they can become the **powerhouse** of the
Arctic.]{.underline} Cooperation will ensure a prosperous future for
themselves and the region as a whole, paving the way for sustainable
development and cooperation on this rapidly evolving frontier.

To answer this question, [[this]{.mark} article [relies on]{.mark} the
[**socio-psychologically rooted** alliance]{.mark} cohesion
**[lit]{.mark}**erature]{.underline} (Liska 1962, Holsti et al. 1973,

According to Patricia Weitsman, [cohesion is "the **[ability]{.mark}**
of states [to **agree**]{.mark} on goals and strategies toward attaining
those goals"]{.underline} (2003, p. 85). Following this definition,
[cohesion [manifests]{.mark} itself [through **coop**]{.mark}**erative
[behaviour]{.mark}** [such as **consultations**]{.mark}]{.underline},
mutual concessions, and responsiveness towards each other's needs
generating collective gains.1 If that behaviour is typical and even
expected within an alliance, the proponents of cohesion theory point out
that conflicting strategic interests and threat perceptions may be
detrimental to group cohesion (Liska 1962, pp. 97--129, Holsti et al.
1973, p. 17, Thompson and Rapkin 1981, p. 615, Malici 2005, p. 93). This
article responds to their argument by hypothesising that
[[consensus-based bargaining **within**]{.mark} the Atlantic Alliance
[allows]{.mark} for the **[bridging]{.mark} of [divergent]{.mark} threat
[perceptions]{.mark}** among allies [and **fosters**]{.mark} a **[shared
understanding]{.mark}** of their respective issues]{.underline}.
According to this hypothesis, the birth of the 360- degree concept and
its implementation shall then embody this spirit of compromise. We
further hypothesise that it is rendered possible by the very nature of
NATO. Scholars no longer dispute the fact that NATO is a pluralist
security community (Pouliot and Lachmann 2004). It means that it is
composed of independent governments sharing "core values derived from
common institutions, and mutual responsiveness -- a matter of mutual
identity and loyalty, a sense of 'we-ness,'" and determined to resolve
their disputes peacefully (Adler and Barnett 1998, p. 7). [NATO
[allies]{.mark} are]{.underline} then [incentivised to]{.underline} talk
and [**[coop]{.mark}**erate not only because of the consensus rule

However, [despite intensive negotiations]{.underline} taken place [to

procedural [device]{.underline} of multilateral conferences ["under

**[opposition]{.mark}**"]{.underline} \[4, p. 1\]. [Being one of
specific characteristics of the NATO **decision-making procedure**,
"silence procedure" can be applied for all]{.underline} those [decisions
that require **consensus**]{.underline}. To understand how decisions by
consensus in NATO are achieved, what are peculiarities of "silence
procedure" we will start from the brief organizational structure and
analyse its 2003 decision making crisis related to NATO's defence system
provision to Turkey in the lights of possible US attacks on Iraq.

[Important decision in NATO made by]{.underline} North Atlantic Council
[(**NAC**)]{.underline} or Military Committee (MC) with its Defence and
Planning Committee as a subdivision. There are 19 members in NAC and 18
members in MC as France withdrew from the alliance military committee in
1966, but have an observer without a voting right. According to the CRS
Report for Congress, the both NAC and MC "achieve consensus through a
process in which no government states its objection" " \[4, p. 3\].
[["Silence]{.mark} procedure" is used to **[circumvent]{.mark}
confrontations** during]{.underline} large [[discussions and
**escape**]{.mark} unnecessary **media [coverage]{.mark}** over
**sensitive issues**]{.underline}.

[Secretary General set a **deadline** to receive a letter
from]{.underline} member [states opposing an issue]{.underline}. Gallis
states that ["by **not sending** a letter ... within specified time
period, [a government can **avoid**]{.mark} **the step** of [stating
its]{.mark} **explicit [objection]{.mark}** to a policy [if it
believes]{.mark} **other [allies]{.mark}** [are set on]{.mark} a
**course of [action]{.mark}**"]{.underline} " \[4, p. 3\]. [[In the case
of]{.mark} defence system]{.underline} provision [for
[Turkey]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2003, [**[three]{.mark} countries**
including France, Germany and Belgium [objected]{.mark}]{.underline} the
decision in NAC and sent a formal letter as was required.
[[Nevertheless, the]{.mark} discussion of this issue by [US
initiative]{.mark} was **[passed]{.mark}**]{.underline} to the MC, where
France is not a member. [Here, [Germany]{.mark} **changed its position**
and [**dropped opposition** leaving]{.mark} Belgium in **isolation** and
with [**no choice** but to **act**]{.mark} **in the same
way**]{.underline} \[4\]. In other words, [the discussions to achieve
consensus **include intensive negotiations** among all parties involved.
"Silence procedure" is one of the modes that **foster consensus
decision** making to **achieve unanimity**]{.underline}. This case
explicitly shows that consensus decision making is negotiation by

Putting NATO decision-making into question

[In an ever-expanding organization]{.underline}, both in terms of its
membership and the type and scope of its roles and missions, [the
question of **decision-making** begs more attention than it currently
gets in NATO]{.underline}. To be sure, political bargaining always
allows for a considerable degree of flexibility in an intergovernmental
forum. [Even the considerations of how serious are the [**implications**
of **failing to overcome**]{.mark} their [disagreement on]{.mark} the
organization's **[prestige]{.mark}** and **credibility** might
**[incite]{.mark} the [members]{.mark}** [to reach]{.mark} a
[solution]{.mark}]{.underline}, as Lord Robertson wished. Last but not
least, [[there could]{.mark} always [be]{.mark} some
**[last-minute]{.mark} compromise [packages]{.mark}** [to
**overcome**]{.mark} the [deadlocks]{.mark}, like the one proposed by
Belgium]{.underline} to end the quagmire [over supporting
Turkey]{.underline}. But if NATO is to continue its adaptation to the
new international security agenda, there is a need to develop some
formal, well-defined mechanisms within NATO's institutional structure,
rather than waiting for ad hoc quick-fix solutions in a future crisis of
similar gravity. Hence, it is high time to shift the emphasis to and
delve deeper into whether NATO's decision-making procedures could be
streamlined to enhance the relevancy and effectiveness of the
organization.

#### U.S. recommendations will be [adopted]{.underline} by the NAC, becoming [effectively binding]{.underline} on [all]{.underline} members, but the [process]{.underline} of collective formulation [without]{.underline} setting [prior]{.underline}, [fixed]{.underline} policy is key to legitimacy and [acceptance]{.underline}.

University of Warwick; Review of International Studies, "Trump\'s
Foreign Policy and NATO: Exit and Voice," vol. 45\]

If exit is a credible option for the US, why has it not taken place? The
answer lies in the institutional character of the Alliance.
Institutional analysis of NATO is often seen as a counter to realism.
The latter views alliances as mechanisms of balancing or bandwagoning in
the international system with alliance formation, stability, and
durability being a reflection of power configurations among states.
Realism can account for the formation of NATO, its cohesion when
confronted with a commonly recognised existential threat such as the
Soviet Union, and its adaptation after the Cold War as the US harnessed
the Alliance to new security tasks. [Here, [**what matters** is]{.mark}
national and especially **[America]{.mark}**n preferences **[not
NATO]{.mark}**'s institutional qualities]{.underline}. 33 Discounting
institutions in this case is, however, misplaced. [NATO's permanent
mechanisms of **[intra-alliance]{.mark} political
[consultation]{.mark}** alongside a standing command
structure]{.underline} (embracing defence planning, standardisation,
interoperability, and a recurrent rather than one-off ability to deploy)
[[are **unique**]{.underline}]{.mark} among both historical alliances
and contemporary international organisations. 34 Two consequences follow
from the presence of these arrangements. First, NATO has assumed an
elevated status in American strategic calculations. Here, the burden of
defending allies is offset by NATO's political role in aligning allied
preferences with those of the US. [NATO's institutional mechanisms ([the
**N**]{.mark}]{.underline}orth **[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**tlantic
**[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**ouncil above all) [[make]{.mark} that
[**alignment** possible]{.mark}, ensure it is [**embedded**, and]{.mark}
deliver efficiencies and gains [to **all allies**]{.mark} in the
process]{.underline}. NATO thus takes on alliance-centric tasks (the
security of Europe and the stabilisation of its periphery) that are of
clear benefit to Europeans but which provide, simultaneously, an
important security externality to the US. [Second,
[institutionalisation]{.mark} has assumed a **social character** -- the
sophistication [and **permanency**]{.mark} of intra-alliance mechanisms
provide ample opportunities for voice and [renders that]{.mark}
articulation **[legitimate]{.mark}**]{.underline}. One need not
characterise NATO as a community organisation of democratic values 35 in
order to allow for this outcome. It can be seen also as [the consequence
of]{.underline} more formal properties that pertain to a sophisticated
multilateral security arrangement: [acceptance of the **principle of
[consultation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, agreement on common security
threats and, in NATO's case, a sense of shared endeavour built up over a
decades' long history. 36 These properties are certainly open to
exploitation. However, even the most powerful ally will be wont to play
within the multilateral [[rules]{.mark} of the game]{.underline}. These,
after all, [[are **stacked in its favour** and]{.mark} so [offer a
**reliable means** of]{.mark} exercising **leadership** and
[getting]{.mark} **fellow [allies]{.mark}** [to **toe the
line**]{.mark}]{.underline}. 37

All of this is not simply realism by another route. [Institutions act as
[a **vehicle**]{.mark} with[**in** which]{.mark} the
**[demands]{.mark}** of the powerful [are articulated]{.mark} and
modified]{.underline}. The institution, in other words, exerts its own
effect. The interaction of exit and voice in NATO bears out this
assumption. A member as powerful as the US could well hold the view that
NATO is underperforming its core defence function or is neglecting other
tasks the US considers important. Equally, it might believe that the
cost of contributing to NATO's public security goods is too great
particularly if other allies are seen to be shirking their
responsibilities. [**[America's]{.mark}** history of [engagement]{.mark}
with NATO]{.underline} has been characterised by the periodic recurrence
of such tensions yet, as we shall see below, throughout it has exercised
the option of voice. Voice [[has **proven effective**]{.mark} both
[in]{.mark} expressing dissatisfaction with NATO's allies and
**[advocating changes]{.mark}** to allied business]{.underline}. NATO's
institutionalisation, in other words, has served to minimise the cost,
and to maximise the benefits of exercising voice, just as it has served
to minimise the benefits and to maximise the cost of exit. 38

#### [Every country]{.underline} follows on.

Organization; European Security, "Defense Planning in the Fog of Peace:
The Transatlantic Currency Conversion Conundrum," vol. 29\]

Theory: what problem is the transatlantic security community trying to
solve?

[We define strategy as]{.underline} "the direction and use of any or all
of the assets of a security community, including its military
instrument, for the purposes of [**policy** as **decided by
politics**]{.underline}" (Gray 2010, p. 262). To the extent that
[NATO]{.underline} and the EU are security communities, they practice
strategy together. In so doing, the transatlantic community [seeks to
**shape** the behaviour of]{.underline} rivals and threats, but also of
[its **own members**]{.underline}.

We theorise that since end of the Cold War, the transatlantic community
has performed strategy and defense planning in a "fog of peace", in
which it lacks an agreed-upon strategic rival and clear threat. This fog
of peace presents challenges to strategists and defense planners, as
strategy is generally focused on addressing such rivals and threats.
Intra-allied debates about actions in Northeast Syria are one example of
how such a fog can manifest, but it also manifests in more prosaic ways
in recurrent defense planning, the focus of our research.

We argue that in such a context, [strategy and defense
planning]{.underline} in the transatlantic community
[respond]{.underline} less to external geostrategic dynamics than [to
dynamics **internal** to the community itself]{.underline}. "Strategy is
always subject to a domestic, and possibly allied, audit on criteria far
removed from strict military-strategic utility" (Gray 2010). In a fog of
peace, this domestic and allied audit is the nearest approximation of a
"final audit" (McMaster 2008) of war. The empirical component of this
paper examines how states in the transatlantic security community audit
one another, and how they insure themselves and one another against war
during times of (relative) peace.

As the EU and, primarily, NATO, practice strategy, so too does each
individual member of the transatlantic community. More specifically,
each ally strikes its own balance between focusing on "challenges posed
by Russia" and "threats emanating from ...the Middle East and North
Africa" (NATO 2014).

Moreover, European geostrategy plays out internally, as well as
externally. While NATO's purpose may no longer be precisely to "keep the
Soviet Union out, the Americans in, and the Germans down" (Ismay 1952),
it continues to deter and defend against Russia, maintain the
transatlantic bond, and help manage the intra-European balance of power
by tethering potential adversaries to one another, thereby diffusing
latent conflicts (Weitsman 2004).

Defense planning and burden sharing are thus political and strategic
issues, and both NATO and the EU, with their overlapping memberships and
the "single set of forces" (Papaioannou 2019) that applies to the 22
states that are members of both, play important (but different) roles in
how the transatlantic community addresses them. Defense planning is "the
practice of military strategy in grand strategy, and is conducted in a
thoroughly political process" (Gray 2014). The coexistence of the NDPP
and the EU's CARD means that both organisations are engaged in the
defense planning processes of their members. While NDPP and CARD arise
from the same requirements and both aim to synchronise defense planning
among allies, NDPP is a much more developed process. The empirical focus
of this paper will therefore be on NDPP.

[Defense [planning is]{.mark} the **[key]{.mark} process**]{.underline}
by which communities seek to convert the currency of political will into
strategic effect. Most conventionally, they seek [to create]{.underline}
and maintain [capabilities that]{.underline} they *think* will influence
the behaviour of adversaries. Processes like NDPP also seek [[to
**create**]{.mark} **strategic [effect *within*]{.mark}** the
transatlantic community -- [allies]{.mark} explicitly attempt to
**[influence]{.mark} one [another's]{.mark} national defense
[planning]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It is thus not surprising that the
first step of the NDPP that allies defined and agreed together is
"establish political guidance" (NATO 2018b).

While it is beyond the scope of this paper to measure the extent to
which [**allies influence** one **another's planning**, there is **ample
ev**idence of such **influence** occurring]{.underline}. In the area of
burden-sharing, the fact that every ally has increased defense spending
since 2014 and "the majority of NATO Allies now have plans to reach the
2% guideline, spending 2% of GDP by 2024" (Stoltenberg 2019)
demonstrates that this is the case -- it is difficult to argue that such
plans would exist in the absence of the Wales pledge. [At the national
level, [**examples** of the]{.mark} Wales [pledge **affecting**]{.mark}
**national [planning]{.mark}** [abound]{.mark}]{.underline}. The 2015 UK
National Security Strategy states that the UK will "Meet the NATO pledge
to spend 2% of our GDP on defence" (United Kingdom 2015). Slovakia's
(2016) White Paper on national defense "reaffirms its political
commitment to the Defence Investment Pledge". [[Even]{.mark} Canada, one
of the [**countries** who **resist**]{.mark}ed agreeing the Wales pledge
the most]{.underline} (Anonymous 2019), [[**incorporated it**
into]{.mark} its **[national]{.mark}** defense
[planning]{.mark}]{.underline} (Canada 2017). France, known for
jealously guarding its sovereignty within and beyond NATO, explicitly
affirmed its commitment to meeting NATO's 2% defense spending guideline
in its 2017 strategic review (France 2017). These are but a few examples
among many, but they demonstrate that [states]{.underline} with varying
geostrategic and economic positions, as well as strategic cultures,
[are]{.underline} in fact [**influenced** by NATO defense planning
agreements]{.underline}. Moreover, NATO [[allies]{.underline}]{.mark}
Denmark and Norway have **[[incorporate]{.underline}]{.mark}**d
[[NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} defense planning [[guidelines into their
**national strategies**]{.mark} **and behaviour**]{.underline},
resulting in very different behaviour (quantitatively and qualitatively)
from their non-allied neighbours Finland and Sweden (Becker 2018).

While the requirement for security communities to identify ends and then
choose ways to achieve them with the means available is perennial, the
specific conduct of defense planning varies as a function of the
strategic context. An example of this variation is NATO's shifting
relative emphasis over time on collective defense, crisis management,
and cooperative security.

### Solvency\-\-\--Say Yes\-\--Turkey\-\--2NC

#### Turkey says yes to action in the arctic

owen

No stranger to circumpolar scientific exploration and research,
Türkiye's focus in recent years has been on earth's southern pole in
Antarctica.  But when it comes to the Arctic, there are [**three** main
reasons why [Ankara]{.mark}\'s presence in the Arctic is
**important**]{.underline}. First, the region is becoming a focal point
of geopolitics. Understandably, as more [countries [seek]{.mark} greater
[involvement]{.mark} in the region, Türkiye does [not want to be **left
behind**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Secondly, as [**[econ]{.mark}omic
[opportunities]{.mark}** appear [in the Arctic]{.mark}, Türkiye will
want to be well placed to be more involved.]{.underline} Finally, the
[[Arctic]{.mark} region is [home to **hundreds of thousands**]{.mark}
[of **ethnic**]{.mark}**ally [Turk]{.mark}ic people**, such as the
**Yakut[s]{.mark}** and Dolgans. [Ankara]{.mark}]{.underline} has been
[[keen to promote]{.mark} a **[common heritage]{.mark}** and culture
between Turkic states and people in recent years]{.underline}---the
Arctic region is no exception.  

President [[Erdogan]{.underline}]{.mark} and other Turkish policymakers
have [recognized the growing importance of the Arctic
region.]{.underline} In 2015, Türkiye [[applied for **Observer status**
in]{.mark} the [A]{.mark}rctic [C]{.mark}ouncil]{.underline}---the
world's premier multilateral Arctic organization. However, with the
breakdown in relations between Russia and its fellow Arctic states over
the incursion on Ukraine, the Arctic Council has all but stopped
functioning. This makes the [[accession of]{.mark} the **[Svalbard
Treaty]{.mark}**]{.underline} the quickest and most direct way for
Türkiye to get a stake in the Arctic region. 

Global interest in the Arctic will only increase in the years to come.
As other nations devote resources and assets in the region to secure
their national interests, [Türkiye]{.underline} will [not want to fall
behind.]{.underline}

#### Turkey says yes

**Waldman 19** (Simon Waldman, an associate fellow at the Henry Jackson
Society and a visiting research fellow at King\'s College London;
"Despite Turkey's drift from the West, Nato is still Ankara's best
security guarantor"; National News; 12/10/19;
https://www.thenationalnews.com/opinion/comment/despite-turkey-s-drift-from-the-west-nato-is-still-ankara-s-best-security-guarantor-1.949535
kp)

So, [while Turkey has been drifting from its]{.underline} traditional
[allies in the West, [Ankara knows it is **not prudent** to]{.mark}
completely [throw in its lot with Russia and Iran]{.mark}. Turkey
[recognises]{.mark}]{.underline} the [benefits of its relations with
Europe, its **largest trading partner**, the [utility of ties with the
US]{.mark}, and]{.underline} by extension, the **[Nato]{.underline}**
alliance.

[[Without Nato, **Turkey is weak**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Turkey may have
the second-largest army within the alliance but [[after]{.mark} years of
[purges]{.mark} within the officer ranks]{.underline}, especially after
the 2016 attempted coup, [[Turkey]{.mark} has **[lost
personnel]{.mark}** with significant experience and expertise. [It will
take **years**]{.mark} for its armed forces **[to]{.mark} fully
[recover]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Nato offers Turkey a security umbrella that Ankara does not wish to
lose. Article 4 of the North Atlantic treaty calls for Nato members to
"consult" with each other if they feel that their security is at risk.
Article 5 considers an attack against one member-state an attack against
them all. [From the [presence of **Nato bases** in Turkish
territory]{.mark} to the [use]{.mark} of **[Nato]{.mark} hardware**,
[Turkey's security is all but guaranteed]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Meanwhile, [[Turkish officers]{.mark} in Brussels [have access
to]{.mark} training and
**[intel]{.mark}ligence-[sharing]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and [it is
[through Nato]{.mark} that [Turkey can be involved in]{.mark} joint
[missions where **valuable experience is
gained**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

What this means is that at times [the West can and should **stand firm**
when facing pressure from Ankara]{.underline}. Despite Turkey's drift
from the West, Ankara knows that Nato continues to provide Turkey's
greatest **[[security guarantee]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This
[[gives]{.mark} the [West]{.mark}]{.underline} at least some
**[[leverage]{.mark} over Turkey]{.underline}** and [when the occasion
calls, should not be afraid to use it.]{.underline}

[[Canada]{.mark} had been [resist]{.mark}ant to providing troops
to]{.underline} NATO [northern exercises]{.underline} throughout much of
the post-Cold War era. This is [[now **changing**]{.underline}]{.mark},
and [Canada is increasingly [committing]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}a
**[[much more]{.underline}]{.mark}** significant element of its forces
to participate in these exercises. In February [20[16]{.mark}, Canada
[deployed]{.mark}]{.underline} the [2 Canadian [Mechanized
Brigade]{.mark} Group]{.underline} and the 3rd Battalion of the Royal
Canadian Regiment to participate in the large-scale Norwegian Cold
Response exercise. Cold Response involved over [[**15,000**
troops]{.underline}]{.mark} and included [a large number of NATO and
Swedish troops]{.underline} (Department of National Defence 2016).

Late in June of the same year, [Canada sent]{.underline} the submarine
HMCS [[Windsor]{.mark} to [participate in]{.mark} the 10-day NATO
[anti-submarine exercise]{.mark}]{.underline} Dynamic Mongoose. This
exercise took place off Norwegian waters and toward the area of the
Atlantic Ocean bounded by Greenland, Iceland and the United Kingdom ---
known as the GIUK Gap --- and involved eight NATO members. At the end of
the exercise, NATO asked the Windsor to remain in the area to cover
increased Russian submarine activity in the region (Royal Canadian Navy
2016).

More recently (November 2018), [Canada concluded its participation in
**[Trident Juncture]{.mark}**]{.underline}, one of the [[**largest**
NATO]{.mark} [exercises]{.mark} to take place [in]{.mark} the
[Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} region [[since the]{.mark} end of the [Cold
War]{.mark}]{.underline}. Canada's involvement included the deployment
of eight CF-188 Hornets, an aerial refuelling tanker and 1,000 personnel
from 5 Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group. The Royal Canadian Navy
deployed two frigates and two Maritime Coastal Defence vessels to the
exercise (Department of National Defence 2018).

Canada is also [[invit]{.mark}ing]{.underline} and involving a wider
range of [[NATO members]{.mark} to [participate]{.mark} in Canadian
exercises [on]{.mark} **[Canadian]{.mark}** northern
**[soil]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Most recently, in March 2019, [[France,
Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Finland all sent divers]{.underline}]{.mark}
to participate in Operation Nanook. This means that there is now an
[expansion [**beyond the normal** Arctic NATO]{.mark} [states]{.mark} to
include France and]{.underline} two non-NATO countries --- [Sweden and
Finland]{.underline} (Department of National Defence 2019).

[[Arctic security might be a **cornerstone** of negotiations between
Canada and]{.mark} the [U.S.]{.mark} as Prime Minister Mark Carney and
President Donald Trump put a 30-day deadline on reaching a deal for a
**new "economic and security relationship"** between the two
countries.]{.underline}

"I'm looking forward to continuing this work at this summit and in the
weeks ahead," Carney said on social media about the negotiations, which
occurred Monday during the G7 summit in Kananaskis, Alta., before
Trump's early exit to deal with a war between Iran and Israel.

As part of the negotiations, [[Canada might commit to]{.mark} building
**more [Arctic security]{.mark} infrastructure** and beefing up its
overall **defence spending**]{.underline}, CBC News has reported.

[[It's **"natural"** that Arctic]{.mark} defence [is part of those
conversations]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} said retired Col. Pierre
Leblanc, a commander of the Canadian Forces Northern Area from 1995 to
2000.

For the U.S., an increased military presence in the Arctic would make a
bigger and more effective Golden Dome over North America --- a
Trump-proposed missile defence system that Canada is in talks to join,
Leblanc said.

"Trump is doing us a service by squeezing us to do more on defence,"
Leblanc said, noting that for years different U.S. administrations have
been "irritated" by the lack of defence spending in Canada.

In the past few years, the federal government made several commitments
to national and specifically Arctic security. [Arctic operational
support hubs were **key pillars**]{.underline} of the government's
\$81.1-billion defence policy that was introduced in April 2024.

Then-defence minister Bill Blair announced on March 6 that those hubs
will be built in Iqaluit, Inuvik and Yellowknife at a total cost of
\$2.67 billion over 20 years.

But Leblanc said these projects won't compensate for years of federal
underspending in defence.

"There are no ifs and buts. Right now, it is time to increase our
defence," he said.

Relations between the U.S. and Canada have deteriorated since Trump was
elected in November. The president has mused several times about Canada
becoming the 51st state and imposed several packages of tariffs on
Canadian goods, including 25 per cent on Canadian automobiles, steel and
aluminum; and 10 per cent on energy and potash.

Canada responded with its own retaliatory tariffs, including 25 per cent
on \$30 billion worth of American imports and another 25 per cent on
steel and aluminum.

When asked last Thursday, Premier P.J. Akeeagok declined to comment on
the talks between Trump and Carney as he "was not a part" of those
conversations.

#### It'll enter the [Strategic Concept]{.underline}\-\--that resonates [globally]{.underline}. 

**Zapolskis '10** \[Martynas; 2010; PhD Candidate at the Institute of
International Relations and Political Science at Vilnius University;
Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review, "Redefining the EuroAtlantic Security
Agenda: What is the Role for the New NATO Strategic Concept?" p. 41-44\]

2.3. [Strategic Concept [as **practical guidance** for
**reforms**]{.mark} and capabilities]{.underline}

What needs to be done to ensure the practical value of the new Strategic
Concept? This is one of the central questions for the strategists and
policy makers of NATO. [The]{.underline} new [[SC has]{.mark} the
[potential to become]{.mark} a **[real strategy]{.mark}**, i.e. to
provide **practical guidelines** for the development of NATO
capabilities]{.underline}.

According to the NATO defence planning process, namely [the [SC is the
**main**]{.mark} **strategic [document]{.mark}**, providing]{.underline}
an overall assessment of the strategic environment and [the **highest
level of guidance** on political and military means]{.underline}, which
should be [used in achieving NATO's]{.underline} fundamental security
[tasks]{.underline}.42

[[**U.S.** **Sec**]{.underline}]{.mark}retary of
**[[Def]{.underline}]{.mark}**ence Gates recently [[emphasized]{.mark}
that the new [SC has to be **more**]{.mark} **than "just [words on
paper"]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}]{.underline} should [[actually
reflect]{.underline}]{.mark} "NATO's [[operational]{.mark} and
institutional [structures]{.mark}]{.underline}".43 Secretary Gates
called for more action in such fields as missile defence, cooperation
with partners and non-military multinational organizations. According to
him, "despite the need to spend more on vital equipment for ongoing
missions, the alliance has been unwilling to fundamentally change how it
sets priorities and allocates resources".44 The [progress can be
achieved by **ensuring political commitment** of NATO
leaders]{.underline} and by "developing new ways to maintain
capabilities through multinational procurement, more common funding, or
reallocating resources based on collective rather than national
priorities".45

NATO Secretary General is also repeatedly calling for the prioritization
of resource projects, collective solutions to capability development
(multinational defence acquisitions), more common funding,
specializations of tasks, pooling resources and avoiding the duplication
of capabilities and structures.46

Besides for the problem of building capabilities, the question of
reforming NATO is very relevant. R. Gates has harshly criticized NATO's
institutional machinery and shrinking defence budgets of the European
states: "the Alliance faces very serious, long-term, systemic problems.
\... We also have to acknowledge and address excess infrastructure and
outdated command structures that bear little resemblance to NATO's
real-world needs. \... The demilitarization of Europe has gone from a
blessing in the 20th century to an impediment to achieving real security
and lasting peace."47

The current SC is rather explicit about capabilities -- it provides
guidelines for the development of NATO's forces, describes missions and
requirements of Alliance's military forces, provides the main
characteristics of NATO's conventional and nuclear forces, etc.48

[The new [SC could]{.mark} provide **[direct]{.mark}ions** for **NATO
[transformation]{.mark}**]{.underline} in various fields: 1) optimizing
decision making (qualified majority could be used at some
decision-making levels instead of the consensus rule, which is still
applied to all NATO decisions); 2) improving early warning systems
(intelligence sharing, planning, and information power); 3) enhancing
multinational military formations; 4) operationalizing comprehensive
approach (ensuring that civil-military cooperation exists at various
levels of the command chain; preparing for hybrid operations); 5)
creating new mechanisms of sharing operational costs (searching
alternatives for the current principle "costs lie where they fall"); 6)
promoting defence industrial cooperation (enhanced NATO-EU coordination
in the field of defence acquisitions); 7) focusing on deployable
conventional forces and commonly funded force enablers (strategic and
theatre lift, C4ISR),49 etc.

[2.4. Strategic concept [as a **message**]{.mark} to publics and [the
**outside world**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Political support from the governments of member states is absolutely
essential for the efficiency of NATO. Notably, political support for the
defence spending can be highly influenced by public opinion. In light of
the current economic recession, defence expenditures are often seen as
unfair waste of money, which could be reallocated for various social
needs and invested in economic development. These tendencies are
particularly relevant in Europe. Shrinking defence budgets in many
Central and Eastern European countries during the last few years is a
good illustration of this problem. Economic downturn has distracted
attention from security problems.

At the same time, the Alliance is suffering from various misperceptions
and stereotypes. In the eyes of public, NATO it is often seen as an
old-fashioned institution. The mission in Afghanistan is often
considered as having nothing to do with the primary interests of
participating countries. Some politicians are constantly complaining
about diverting resources to Afghanistan, instead of funding education
or social programs.

In this context, [the new [SC can be]{.mark} seen as [an opportunity to
**explain**]{.mark} and justify the relevance of the Alliance to
society. To this end, the adoption of the new SC needs to be supported
by intensive campaign of public relations]{.underline}. Effective public
diplomacy and the use of media are key elements of rebuilding the
relevance of NATO in the eyes of the citizens. According to former NATO
Secretary General Scheffer, the new SC has to "ensure that NATO remains
understood by our publics, and relevant to their security needs".50 The
preparation for a new strategy is even more important in terms of
explaining the role of NATO to the outside world. The transformation of
the Alliance after the Cold War from a regional alliance of collective
defence to a global cooperative security system51 has raised many
questions and suspicions among other international players. NATO's
engagement in Afghanistan and active development of partnerships is seen
a challenge in such countries as Russia and China. The role of the
Alliance is not entirely evident even to some partner countries.
According to the conclusions of the special seminar, which was
specifically devoted to examine the issue of partnerships in the context
of the new SC, "many partners have the sense that NATO is actively
seeking their contributions to current operations, but they don't see a
clear strategic direction in the relationships."52 For example, although
the Alliance is cooperating with the Persian Gulf countries through
Istanbul Cooperation Initiative, it is not clear as to whether NATO is
seeking to ensure its own security interests in the region, promote
regional security or strengthen security of particular regimes.53

The misperceptions of NATO's role can be well observed in Russia's
foreign policy. Russia still considers NATO as one of the main external
military dangers (основная военная опасность) for Russia's security in
its military doctrine.54 [[Other]{.mark} major
[powers]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[might be **confused**]{.mark} about
NATO's global outreach]{.underline}. Accordingly, [the [new SC]{.mark}
gives a chance to [**send a clear message** about]{.mark} NATO's
[**ambitions** and]{.mark} its [**attitude** towards other]{.mark}
**international [players]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Oxford Academic, pp. 1863-1881; //ff\]

Secretary-General Stoltenberg and Trump\'s burden-sharing demands:
agenda-setting and brokering

[Trump\'s complaints about **inequitable burden-sharing** dominated his
discourse on NATO in the early stages of his presidency, when he went so
far as to make US collective defence guarantees **conditional on
allies** meeting the 2 per cent defence spending rule]{.underline}.36
[Threatening to **upend** the 70-year-long US grand strategy towards
Europe **at a stroke**, he demanded that allies must 'pay up, including
for past deficiencies, **or they have to get out**. And **if that breaks
up NATO, it breaks up NATO**]{.underline}.'37 [He also **questioned**
the **underlying logic** of **unconditional support** for allies when
positing that he would only defend Baltic allies against Russian
aggression if they had 'fulfilled **their obligations** to
us']{.underline}.38 [The issue therefore posed a **veritable threat** to
the **very survival of NATO**. Had Trump carried out his threat to
revoke US guarantees in the event that allied defence spending did not
meet his demands, this would in effect have **terminated the alliance
built on the principle of unconditional solidarity** in the face of
external threats]{.underline}.

[Trump\'s demands for greater transatlantic burden-sharing were largely
shared by NATO\'s institutional actors]{.underline}, which had long been
supportive of greater allied defence investment to meet the diverse
security challenges in an increasingly hostile international
landscape.39 Adaptation would therefore not pose a threat to the
integrity of NATO; [the main risk for the NATO leadership lay in allies
not increasing their defence spending sufficiently to **satisfy Trump**.
As a result, they had to walk a fine line. On the one hand, they needed
to **side with Trump in public** and put pressure on allies to spend
more on defence. On the other hand, they had to sell even modest
increases as **successes to please Trump**]{.underline}. Indeed, senior
officials were aware that allies would not immediately be able to
increase defence spending sharply, given the political complexity and
long-term nature of budgetary allocations and spending plans.40 [In
order to lobby allies and simultaneously convince Trump, and in the
absence of formal means to compel allies to increase defence spending,
**Stoltenberg** used public communications strategies and procedural
means to set the agenda and **broker compromises** in the
background]{.underline}.

[The Secretary-General chose the **public realm** as the principal venue
through which to pursue his strategy. In close liaison with NATO\'s
public diplomacy division, he used his prominent position to put
**public pressure on allies** to increase their defence spending and
**credit the US president** for allegedly achieving greater
burden-sharing]{.underline}.41 [As early as the day prior to Trump\'s
inauguration]{.underline} on 20 January 2017, [Stoltenberg expressed
**'absolute confidence'** that President Trump was committed to NATO and
**lauded Trump** for his **'strong message'** on defence spending,
pledging to 'work with President Trump on how to adapt
NATO']{.underline}.42 [On his first visit to Washington in April 2017,
Stoltenberg **embraced Trump\'s criticism** of allies\' insufficient
defence spending, and also **expressed gratitude to Trump** for his
'strong commitment to Europe']{.underline}.43 [And **appeasing Trump and
playing to his ego** seemed to be the purpose of Stoltenberg\'s visit to
the White House in May 2018, when he thanked the US President for his
'**leadership** ... on the issue of defence spending \[which\] has
**really helped to make a difference**', a sentiment he echoed at the
Brussels summit in July 2018]{.underline}.44

[In 2019, the Secretary-General intensified his **tailored communicative
efforts** aimed at Trump, repeatedly referring to what emerged as
NATO\'s **new mantra on burden-sharing**. In the run-up to Trump\'s
State of the Union speech in February, Stoltenberg appeared on the
President\'s **favourite US news channel**, Fox, **crediting him** for
an 'extra \$100 billion' allies would have added to their defence
spending by the end of 2020]{.underline}.45 [When invited by Speaker of
the House Nancy Pelosi to be the first secretary-general of any IO to
speak in front of both Houses of Congress in April 2019, he **lauded
President Trump\'s positive impact** on the alliance and again referred
to the burden-sharing slogan]{.underline}.46 [Prior to the London
leaders\' summit in December 2019, Stoltenberg reiterated to Trump that
'your leadership on defence spending is having a real impact', citing
new defence spending figures that showed a \$130 billion increase to
members\' defence spending budgets, expected to rise to \$400 billion by
2024]{.underline}.47

Thus, [the Secretary-General **strategically promoted** the view that
Trump had **prevailed over opposition** from other member
states]{.underline}. Importantly, [the Secretary-General always chose to
compare the spending figures to 2016---the year of Trump\'s
election---rather than 2015, when the allies\' budgets first showed
increases, to **obscure the possibility** that factors **other than
Trump** could be responsible]{.underline}.48 [The Secretary-General not
only understood the **power of the media in public discourse** in
general and for the US president---reportedly an **avid consumer of US
television**---in particular, but also consciously adopted a
**simplistic and servile** communication style to **flatter the
egocentric Trump**]{.underline}.49 One interviewee adds that
[Stoltenberg would always present the defence spending figures in **very
simple bar charts** to **capture the president\'s attention** and cater
for his alleged **short attention span** and **inattention to
detail**]{.underline}.50

[Stoltenberg also used his procedural powers as chair of the North
Atlantic Council to set the burden-sharing agenda at the **most perilous
moment for NATO** during the Trump presidency---the NATO summit in July
2018. Trump\'s **'America First' rhetoric** had been particularly
pronounced during that summer, and in June he had refused to sign the
**G7** statement. Trump was also due to fly to Helsinki for a
controversial bilateral meeting with President Vladimir Putin right
after the NATO summit, and there was a **distinct fear among officials**
that he might decide at short notice to **skip** the NATO
summit]{.underline}.51 [While in the event Trump did attend the summit,
he bore out officials\' concerns when he unleashed a personal attack on
German Chancellor Angela Merkel at a bilateral meeting on the first day
of the summit]{.underline} (11 July). [The next day, **tensions
escalated further**, and the summit was on the **verge of collapse**
when President Trump hijacked a working meeting originally aimed at
fostering relations with Ukraine and Georgia to threaten fellow allied
leaders that the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [would **'go its own way'** should his
burden-sharing **demands not be met**]{.underline}.52 According to one
interviewee, [the US delegation had **'no idea what was
happening'**]{.underline}.53

Sensing the impending danger, [Stoltenberg used his procedural powers as
chair of the North Atlantic Council to turn the working meeting into an
impromptu crisis meeting on burden-sharing. This was a highly unusual,
strategic decision by the Secretary-General, as NATO summits tend to be
ritualistic and formulaic. It proved to be of **critical importance in
appeasing Trump**, playing to the **narcissistic propensities** of the
US president by **allowing him to vent** his frustration and **put
pressure on Europeans** to make concessions before **taking credit for
almost all NATO reforms** undertaken since 2014 in the subsequent press
conference, letting him **walk away with a sense of
victory**]{.underline}.54

[Alongside the agenda-setting strategy, Stoltenberg also sought to exert
complementary diplomatic pressures and broker compromises among other
member states]{.underline}. His private office included several senior
seconded officials, and he used them as ears and mouths in the
capitals.55 He also regularly toured those capitals [to **persuade
Europeans and Canada** of the need for **greater defence spending**.
While some allies felt unease about Stoltenberg\'s overriding
focus]{.underline} on defence spending as the principal indicator of
burden-sharing, [his **reputation** as an **honest broker** and
**skilled mediator** allowed him to overcome these
concerns]{.underline}.56 [He also tended **explicitly to invoke the
threat of US withdrawal** to strengthen his case]{.underline}.57 In
November 2019, senior officials in Stoltenberg\'s private office helped
broker a new common funding formula for NATO\'s budget. [In order to
**alleviate Trump\'s criticism** of allied, and in particular German,
under-spending, Stoltenberg\'s office **worked behind the scenes** with
officials from the German chancellery and the US National Security
Council to increase German contributions to match the reduced US
level]{.underline}.58 [While this was largely symbolic]{.underline},
given the relatively insignificant sums involved, [it subsequently
allowed Stoltenberg to **claim another public victory for Trump**\'s
burden-sharing agenda]{.underline}.

By the end of 2019, [Trump had **proclaimed his satisfaction at several
points** that 'people are paying and I\'m very happy with the fact that
they\'re paying']{.underline},59 [despite the fact that increases were
**well below** his demand]{.underline} that every ally meet the 2 per
cent target (not to mention spending 4 per cent of GDP on defence, a
demand he made at the 2018 summit). While national defence budgets have
been on the rise since 2015, only seven out of 29 allies met the target
in 2019 and only 15 had set out plans to reach 2 per cent of GDP of
overall defence spending by 2024.60 There is therefore a correlation
between Trump\'s conversion on burden-sharing and Stoltenberg\'s
strategic responses; indeed, there are several pieces of evidence that
suggest that the Secretary-General and senior officials played a causal
role in that conversion.

First, [Trump\'s **own comments** suggest that Stoltenberg played a
**critical role in persuading him**]{.underline}. Throughout his tenure,
[NATO\'s Secretary-General maintained an **amicable relationship** with
Trump]{.underline}, a rarity for any leader.61 [**Trump heaped lavish
praise** on Stoltenberg, describing their relationship as 'outstanding'
and stating that he had 'done an **excellent job**'---a judgement
reinforced when Trump supported extending Stoltenberg\'s term as
secretary-general for another two years. Crucially, he established a
direct link between Stoltenberg and burden-sharing, exclaiming that
'**the media never gives me credit but he gave me credit**, now we\'re
up to way over \$100 billion']{.underline}.62 Moreover, [Stoltenberg\'s
\$100 billion slogan evidently **gained traction** with Trump,
especially after the Secretary-General trumpeted it on **Fox News**, an
announcement which Trump **immediately retweeted** and then cited for
the first time in his State of the Union address just one week
later]{.underline}.63

Second, [several closely involved **national and NATO officials
confirm** that Trump began changing his stance **after encounters with
Stoltenberg**, whose **adroit flattery** pushed the **right buttons**
with the president]{.underline}.64 Close observers confirm this
impression: [the then British Ambassador in Washington characterized
Stoltenberg as the **'master Trump-whisperer'**]{.underline},65 while
one interviewee noted that [the Secretary-General was always one of the
first points of contact when defence decisions were impending and that
'Trump looked to Stoltenberg for advice']{.underline}.66

Third, [the beginning of Trump\'s conversion can be traced to the 2018
summit, which was a critical moment for the alliance. The **outcome of
the summit** hung in the balance; US officials attending the summit
feared that Trump would announce the **US withdrawal from NATO** at the
press conference]{.underline} on 12 July [and had even instructed
lawyers to analyse NATO\'s founding treaty for advice on the legal
mechanisms]{.underline} (though Congress would have prevented a formal
withdrawal). Secretary [**Mattis** was strikingly absent from the stage
when Trump gave the press conference and, in private, implied his
willingness to **resign that day**]{.underline}.67 [Without
Stoltenberg\'s unscripted and spontaneous decision to call the emergency
session, all indicators suggests that Trump would at least have caused
**severe damage to the alliance**]{.underline}.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) summit in Brussels on June
14, 2021, offers an opportunity for the Alliance to finally come to
grips with the Arctic, a strategically important region toward which the
Alliance has been slow to turn its attention. [[NATO has **no agreed
position** on its role in the Arctic region]{.mark}, and past summits
have largely skirted the issue on account of internal divisions in the
Alliance.]{.underline}

Although the Arctic region has been an area of low conflict among the
Arctic powers, NATO should consider the implications of Russia's recent
aggressive military behavior. NATO is a collective security organization
designed to defend the territorial integrity of its members. Five NATO
members (Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and the United States) are
Arctic countries, and each has territory above the Arctic Circle. In
addition, two closely allied nations (Finland and Sweden) also have
Arctic territory.

The Alliance has rightly focused on bolstering collective defense in the
Baltic Sea and Black Sea regions in recent years, yet still has not
agreed on a common policy concerning the security in the Arctic. It is
past time for this strategic gap to be rectified, and NATO should do so
at the upcoming Brussels Summit.

NATO Is an Arctic Alliance

Norway is the leading voice inside the Alliance for promoting NATO's
role in the Arctic. Norway is the only country in the world with
permanent military headquarters above the Arctic Circle, and it has
invested extensively in Arctic defense capabilities. In October 2020,
Norway announced the reopening of the Olavsvern bunker, a mountainside
submarine base near Tromsø, closed in 2002, which has "9,800ft of
deep-water underground docks that can house and refit nuclear
submarines."1 The base is open to U.S. Seawolf-class nuclear
submarines.2

The U.S. has begun to pay increased attention to the Arctic theater in
Europe in recent years. One way has been through a beefed-up military
presence in Norway. In April 2021, the two nations signed the
Supplementary Defense Cooperation Agreement, which in part allows the
U.S. to build additional infrastructure at Rygge and Sola Air Stations
in southern Norway, as well as Evenes Air Station and the naval base at
Ramsund, both of which are located above the Arctic Circle.3

Construction at Evenes will support Norwegian and Allied maritime patrol
aircraft in monitoring Russian submarine activity. Norwegian Foreign
Minister Ine Eriksen Soereide stated that the "agreement reaffirms
Norway's close relationship with the U.S. and confirms Norway's key
position on the northern flank of NATO."4 In August 2020, the Marine
Corps announced the end of heel-to-toe rotations of 700 marines to
Norway, which began in 2017, opting for shorter, more sporadic,
deployments.5 The first new deployment in October 2020 consisted of 400
marines; the second deployment, from January to March 2021, consisted of
1,000 Marines, arriving for Arctic warfare training.6

In addition to ground forces, in February and March 2021, four B-1
Lancers were based at Ørland Main Air Station in southern Norway, the
first time the aircraft have been based in Norway.7 The Lancers
conducted training exercises with allies Denmark, Germany, Italy,
Norway, and Poland,8 while also practicing landing and refueling at Bodø
Air Base above the Arctic Circle.9

[Canada has likewise invested heavily in Arctic defense capabilities.
However, unlike Norway, [Canada has]{.mark} **[stymied past efforts by
NATO to play a larger role in the region.]{.mark}** Generally speaking,
there is a [concern in]{.mark} [Canada that a NATO role in the Arctic
would afford non]{.mark}-Arctic NATO [countries influence in an
area]{.mark} where they otherwise would have none.]{.underline}

[As a sovereign nation-state, [Canada has a prerogative to determine
which role]{.mark}, if any, [NATO should play in]{.mark} [Canada's
Arctic region.]{.mark} However, as a collective-security alliance, NATO
cannot ignore the Arctic altogether, and the Alliance should not remain
divided on the issue.]{.underline}

Within an alliance that operates by consensus, the [[Turkish
strongman]{.mark} has come to be [seen as]{.mark} something of [a
stickup]{.mark} [artist.]{.mark} In 2009, he blocked the appointment of
a new NATO chief from Denmark]{.underline}, complaining that the country
was too tolerant of cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad and too sympathetic
to "Kurdish terrorists" based in Turkey. It took hours of cajoling by
Western leaders, and a face-to-face promise from President Barack Obama
that NATO would appoint a Turk to a leadership position, to satisfy Mr.
Erdogan.

After a rupture in relations between Turkey and Israel the next year,
Mr. [Erdogan prevented the alliance from working with the Jewish
state]{.underline} for six years. A few years later, Mr. Erdogan
[[delayed for months a NATO plan]{.mark} to fortify Eastern European
countries against Russia]{.underline}, again citing Kurdish militants
and demanding that the alliance declare ones operating in Syria to be
terrorists. In 2020, Mr. Erdogan [sent a gas-exploration ship backed by
fighter jets close to Greek waters]{.underline}, causing France to send
ships in support of Greece, also a NATO member.

Now [the [Turkish leader is]{.mark} back in the role of
[obstructionist]{.mark}, and is once again [invoking the Kurds]{.mark},
as he [charges that Sweden and Finland sympathize with]{.mark} the
Kurdish [militants]{.mark} he has made his main enemy.]{.underline}

"These countries have almost become guesthouses for terrorist
organizations," he said this month. "It is not possible for us to be in
favor."

[Mr. Erdogan's stance is a reminder of a long-festering problem for
NATO, which currently has 30 members.]{.underline} Russia's invasion of
Ukraine may have given the alliance a new sense of mission, but [[NATO
must]{.mark} still [contend with a]{.mark}n authoritarian [leader
willing to use]{.mark} his [leverage to gain political points]{.mark} at
home [by **blocking**]{.mark} [**consensus** --- at least for a
time.]{.mark}]{.underline}

It is a situation that [plays to the advantage of]{.underline} President
Vladimir V. [Putin]{.underline} of Russia, who has grown friendlier with
Mr. Erdogan in recent years. For the Russian leader, the rejection of
Swedish and Finnish admission into NATO would be a significant victory.

The quandary would be simpler were it not for Turkey's importance to the
alliance. The country joined NATO in 1952 after aligning with the West
against the Soviet Union; Turkey gives the alliance a crucial strategic
position at the intersection of Europe and Asia, astride both the Middle
East and the Black Sea. It hosts a major U.S. air base where American
nuclear weapons are stored, and Mr. Erdogan has blocked Russian warships
headed toward Ukraine.

But under Mr. Erdogan, **[[Turkey]{.mark} has increasingly [become a
problem to be managed.]{.mark}]{.underline}** As prime minister and then
as president, he has tilted his country away from Europe while
practicing an authoritarian and populist brand of Islamist politics,
especially since a failed coup attempt in 2016.

[He has [purchased a]{.mark}n advanced [missile system from Russia that
NATO officials call a threat]{.mark} to their integrated defense
systems]{.underline}, and in 2019 he mounted a military incursion to
battle Kurds in northern Syria who were aiding the fight against the
Islamic State with U.S. support.

"In my four years there, it was quite often 27 against one," said Ivo H.
Daalder, a U.S. ambassador to NATO during the Obama administration, when
the alliance had 28 members.

Mr. Erdogan's objections to the membership of Sweden and Finland have
even renewed questions about whether NATO might be better off without
Turkey.

An opinion essay this month that was co-written by Joseph I. Lieberman,
a former independent U.S. senator from Connecticut, argued that Mr.
Erdogan's Turkey would flunk the alliance's standards for democratic
governance in prospective new member states. The essay, published by The
Wall Street Journal, warned that Ankara's policies, including a coziness
with Mr. Putin, had undermined NATO's interests and that the alliance
should explore ways of ejecting Turkey.

"Turkey is a member of NATO, but under Mr. [Erdogan]{.underline} it [no
longer subscribes to the values that underpin this great
alliance]{.underline}," wrote Mr. Lieberman and Mark D. Wallace, the
chief executive of the Turkish Democracy Project, a group critical of
Mr. Erdogan.

Some members of Congress have said as much. "Turkey under Erdogan should
not and cannot be seen as an ally," Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey,
the top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said after
Turkey's 2019 incursion into Syria.

But NATO is a military alliance, and Turkey, with the second-largest
army in the organization, an advanced defense industry and its crucial
geographic position, plays a vital role.

Western officials say that Turkey would only cause more problems as a
resentful NATO outsider --- and one that could align itself more closely
with Russia.

"Turkey has undermined its own image," said Alper Coskun, a former
Turkish diplomat who is now a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace. But, he added, "it is still a critical member
of the alliance."

Once again, the question is what will mollify Mr. Erdogan and ensure his
support for admitting Sweden and Finland.

President Biden underscored U.S. support for the move when he hosted the
two nations' leaders at the White House this month and praised a larger
NATO as a check against Russian power. "Biden took an extremely exposed,
high-visibility position by inviting them to Washington," said James F.
Jeffrey, a U.S. ambassador to Turkey during the Obama administration.

Most analysts believe that Mr. Erdogan will not ultimately block the
accession of Sweden and Finland, but that he wants to highlight Turkey's
own security concerns and make domestic political gains before elections
in his country next year.

Mr. Erdogan is mainly concerned with Sweden's longtime support for the
Kurdistan Workers' Party, or P.K.K., which seeks an independent Kurdish
state on territory partly within Turkey's borders.

The P.K.K., which has attacked nonmilitary targets and killed civilians
in Turkey, is outlawed in that country and is designated by both the
United States and the European Union as a terrorist organization,
although some governments, including Sweden, view it more
sympathetically as a Kurdish nationalist movement.

The United States has also backed its affiliated fighters in Syria, the
Y.P.G., or People's Protection Units, who helped to battle the Islamic
State and whom Mr. Erdogan attacked in his 2019 incursion into the
country.

The Turkish president wants the Y.P.G. to be designated as a terrorist
group as well.

Mr. Erdogan accuses both Finland and Sweden of harboring followers of
Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric living in U.S. exile, whom he blames
for the 2016 coup. Turkey is requesting the extradition of roughly 35
people it says are involved with Kurdish separatists or Mr. Gulen.

Mr. Erdogan also objects to Swedish and Finnish arms embargoes against
his country, which were imposed after the 2019 incursion into Syria.
Sweden is already discussing lifting the embargo given current events in
Ukraine.

Some analysts say that Mr. Erdogan's government views the P.K.K. much
the way Washington saw Al Qaeda 20 years ago, and that the West cannot
dismiss the concerns if it hopes to do business with Turkey.

Biden administration officials downplay the standoff and expect Mr.
Erdogan to reach a compromise with Finland and Sweden. Turkish officials
met in Ankara with Finnish and Swedish counterparts for several hours
last week.

Julianne Smith, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, said in an interview that
"this appears to be an issue that they have with Sweden and Finland, so
we'll leave it in their hands." She added that the United States would
provide assistance if needed.

Appearing with Finland's foreign minister in Washington on Friday,
Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken said he was "confident that we will
work through this process swiftly, and that things will move forward
with both countries."

Emre Peker, a London-based director for Europe at the Eurasia Group, a
private consulting firm, said that he did not believe that Mr. Erdogan
was seeking concessions from Washington. He expressed confidence that
Turkey could work out an agreement with Sweden and Finland with the
mediation of the NATO secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg.

Mr. Erdogan's main priorities are getting his country's security
concerns about Kurdish separatists heard and getting the arms embargoes
lifted, Mr. Peker said.

Some American analysts are skeptical. Eric S. Edelman, a former U.S.
ambassador to Turkey and Finland, warned that Mr. Erdogan could be
seeking to curry favor with Mr. Putin --- or at least ease the anger in
Moscow over the sale of lethal drones to Ukraine's military by a private
Turkish company.

"He has this very complicated relationship with Putin that he has to
maintain," Mr. Edelman said. "This is a good way of throwing a little
bone to Putin --- 'I'm still useful to you.'"

analysts believe Mr. Erdogan ultimately will not block Sweden and
Finland from joining NATO.Credit\...Burak Kara/Getty Images

Others believe the Turkish leader wants a payoff from Washington. Mr.
Erdogan is angry that the United States denied Turkey access to the F-35
stealth fighter after his 2017 purchase of the Russian S-400 missile
system. Turkey is now lobbying instead to buy enhanced F-16 fighters but
has met stiff resistance in Congress from the likes of Mr. Menendez.

Mr. Erdogan may also be seeking presidential attention. He had a
friendly rapport with President Donald J. Trump, but Mr. Biden has kept
his distance.

"This is a man who needs to be at center stage," said Mr. Daalder, the
former U.S. ambassador to NATO. "This is a way to say: 'Hey, I'm still
here. You need to pay attention to my issues.'"

Mr. Peker believes that an agreement can be negotiated between Turkey
and the Nordic countries before a NATO summit in Madrid next month,
which would allow for the accession protocols to be signed there.

More likely, some analysts say, Mr. Biden will have to make a nod toward
Mr. Erdogan in Madrid to clinch his assent, as Mr. Obama had to do at a
NATO summit in 2009 to secure the appointment of Anders Fogh Rasmussen
as secretary general.

At a talk hosted by the Council on Foreign Relations last week,
Representative Adam Smith, Democrat of Washington and the chairman of
the House Armed Services Committee, suggested that the stakes of Swedish
and Finnish membership were great enough to warrant direct U.S.
involvement.

"We need to sit down and we need to cut a deal," Mr. Smith said. "And we
need to get aggressive about it, like now."

[During bargaining, alliance members interact and communicate their
**demands for future** security cooperation]{.underline}. Allies not
only try to determine a set of mutually acceptable solutions, but also
evaluate whether the alliance is worth preserving. In the attempt to
find a solution to their differences, [members may encounter
difficulties during negotiation, since their **interests** are
**unlikely to overlap** completely]{.underline}.

Morrow (1994) suggests that two problems may hinder coordination in
alliance politics. First, a distributional problem occurs when [members
have **different preferences** among all available
**solutions**]{.underline}. The other problem is informational problem.
[Allies may **conceal available options** from each other in order to
advance their own interests]{.underline}. These two problems intertwine.
As Morrow argues, "Distributional interests [prevent the **honest
sharing of information**]{.underline}." This dictum applies to
intra-alliance bargaining because, [even in a security alliance, members
are **not fully aware** of each other's intentions. Members sometimes
have an **incentive** to **misrepresent or hide** their true
intent]{.underline} in terms of maximizing their own security benefit,
[and so may **withhold information** regarding their security interests
or falling short of their **commitments** in order to achieve
unexpressed policy goals]{.underline}.

These distributional and informational problems give rise to three
predicaments during intra-alliance bargaining: [alliance members
may]{.underline} (1) [be **unaware** that they have an interest
divergence]{.underline}; (2) acknowledge the existence of interest
divergence, but [be **uncertain** about a mutually acceptable solution;
or]{.underline} (3) [be **unsure** whether other members will keep their
commitments in the future]{.underline}.

To overcome these difficulties, allies rely on information revealed
during intra-alliance bargaining when deciding on the future of an
alliance. First, both sides need to recognize the existence of interest
divergence and the need for a solution. Bargaining needs to focus on
clarifying the problem when one or more partners fail even to see it,
and sometimes this act of clarification can in fact be the most
difficult discussion involved in bargaining.

Second, if both members recognize the interest divergence, they can move
on to negotiate an arrangement. Successful bargaining requires allies to
agree on one among a set of mutually acceptable options. [A
**distributional problem** may occur]{.underline}, however, [when allies
have **uncertainties** regarding each other's updated security
interests]{.underline} and hence regarding what arrangements might
satisfy these interests. Dialogue can clarify matters, but [a member may
become **suspicious** about the claims that an ally makes if these
claims **differ** from its **own reading** of the
situation]{.underline}. Since an alliance relationship allows allies to
interact more frequently, each ally is confident of its own
understanding of the evolving security needs of its partners. [When
there is a **perception gap** among members]{.underline} concerning the
security benefit that one or another enjoys or about the kind of
cooperation that best furthers the alliance's common interests,
[agreement may be **difficult** to reach]{.underline}. Allies must
genuinely communicate their own preferences and be able to verify each
other's claims.

Finally, [members naturally **want to know** the extent to which the
other members value and are committed to the alliance. When their
security interests have **changed**, they will not agree to negotiate
unless they still consider each other **reliable**]{.underline}. When
members agree to revise a treaty, [a major goal is to ensure that any
**new obligations** will induce **sustained cooperation**. An alliance
will soon **fall apart** if bargaining reveals that a member has **no
interest** in maintaining it]{.underline}.

When allies are consistently candid during renegotiation, their
differences are likely to be resolved. However, as mentioned in the
context of studies of burden sharing, [allies have **incentives** to
**take advantage** of their partners that are founded on the
**assumption** that the interests of the latter in maintaining the
alliance will lead them to grant **concessions** during negotiations as
a means to **salvage** the imperiled relationship]{.underline}. In other
words, [some members may enter into **renegotiation** with the belief
that abrogation would be **too costly** for the other
members]{.underline}. In addition, an uncommitted partner is unlikely to
engage in negotiation and more likely simply to abandon the alliance
immediately. A member that is willing to renegotiate, by contrast, still
values and therefore seeks to preserve the alliance. [Each
member]{.underline} thus [starts bargaining under the assumption that
the others are unlikely to give up easily, a situation that **leaves
rooms** for allies to **misrepresent** their security interests and
**levels of commitment**]{.underline}.

[Even in an alliance relationship, a member's commitment to the alliance
is **private information**. Both the challenger and the partner have an
incentive to misrepresent their true intentions in the pursuit of
leverage during bargaining. Expressing discontent may gain concessions
from other allies as well as **testing the loyalty** of
each]{.underline}. A challenger may, in the course of renegotiation,
threaten to withdraw from the alliance when it is in fact willing to
accept an arrangement; a partner may misjudge a challenger's resolve and
fail to accommodate its needs; a challenger may misperceive its partner
as dissatisfied and decide to withdraw from the alliance preemptively.
Therefore, even though intra-alliance bargaining stands a good chance,
and may represent the only chance, of resolving disagreement among
members, there is no guarantee that this process will succeed.

The North Atlantic Council first referred to WMD proliferation as one of
the 'new security risks and challenges of a global nature' facing the
alliance in 1990.8 The Allies referred to WMD proliferation as a risk
for 'Alliance security interests' in the 1991 Strategic Concept, 9 and
pointed out in the 1999 Strategic Concept that it 'can pose a direct
military threat to the Allies' populations, territory, andforces'.10 In
the same document the Allies stated that 'The Alliance will enhance its
political efforts to reduce dangers arising from the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction and their means of delivery.' The Allies
added that, 'By deterring the use of NBC \[nuclear, biological and
chemical\] weapons', NATO's forces 'contribute to Alliance efforts aimed
at preventing the proliferation of these weapons and their delivery
means'. 11 The main institutional consequences have been the alliance's

importance that the allies accord to addressing WMD proliferation, they

remains relatively small. Declarations from NATO Summits and Communiqués

The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) binds 32 countries across
the Western world in a powerful collective security agreement.

Formed during the Cold War in 1949, it has been seen as an opposing
force to Moscow since its inception -- and in many ways continues to be
so.

[But as Russia's war in Ukraine approaches a possible end, **[powerful
members]{.mark} have begun [publicly]{.mark} [doubting]{.mark} their
[commitment]{.mark} to the organisation.**]{.underline}

was **[quick to question the future of Nato]{.mark}** following his
election victory.]{.underline} The previously avowed Atlanticist has
taken a firm stance against Trump's rhetoric on Europe, and has
signalled a desire for stronger ties on the continent.

**[Freidrich [Merz]{.mark} has [questioned whether Nato will continue to
exist]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Speaking in a debate on Sunday, Mr [[Merz said Nato may not even be
talked about]{.mark} "in its current form"]{.underline} at the
organisation's summit in July, adding that he wondered "whether we will
have to establish an independent European defence capability much more
quickly.\"

\"I would never have thought that I would have to say something like
this in a TV show but, [after Donald [Trump\'s]{.mark} remarks last
week\... it is clear that this government does not care much about the
fate of Europe]{.underline},\" he said.

\"My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as
possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from
the USA."

A post-US Nato?

It was a strong message to send to President Trump on the eve of his
party's victory. [But the US leader, in his own way, has also begun to
[question]{.mark} [Nato's future.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Shortly after beginning his second term -- once removed -- the US
president said he wanted to see all Nato allied nations reach a target
of five per cent GDP on defence spending. He has also criticised
European nations for spending less on military aid for Ukraine than the
US during Russia's invasion of the country.

Dropping his predecessor Joe Biden's approach, Mr [Trump was quick to
begin [working with Russian officials]{.mark}]{.underline} to find a
'peace deal' and end the fighting on Ukrainian soil. European countries,
his administration says, must commit troops to any peacekeeping effort
but they will not be joined by US soldiers.

New US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth explained to reporters earlier in
the month that this is because the work would be considered a non-Nato
mission, not covered under Article 5, which guarantees collective
security for allied nations.

For some leaders, the comments point in a clear direction: Europe will
soon be on its own in Nato. Effectively, it may well be already.

Calls for an 'army of Europe'

Speaking on Friday, Mr Merz told the German broadcaster: ["We must
prepare for the possibility that Donald Trump [will no longer
uphold]{.mark} [NATO's mutual defense]{.mark} commitment
unconditionally,"]{.underline}

"That is why, in my view, it is crucial that Europeans make the greatest
possible efforts to ensure that we are at least capable of defending the
European continent on our own."

The likely German chancellor has long been a proponent of a 'European
army,' a concept quickly gathering more support.

Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky called for its creation in a
statement to the Munich Security Conference earlier in February, arguing
that "America might say no to Europe on issues that threaten it" because
"the old days are over".

Other leaders continue to call for unification in the face of Russian
aggression. UK prime minister Sir Keir Starmer has said he is ready to
put British troops on the ground in Ukraine "if necessary," later
backing President Trump's calls for Nato members to boost defence
spending.

However, he added that this must come with continued support from the
US, saying that a \"security guarantee is essential for a lasting peace,
because only the US can deter Putin from attacking again.\"

What is Nato?

Founded in 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was formed by 12
nations to counter the threat to European security posed by the Soviet
Union during the Cold War.

Nato's ranks have grown since the Washington Treaty was signed 75 years
ago, most recently to 32 countries after Sweden joined last year,
worried by an increasingly aggressive Russia.

Nato's collective security guarantee -- Article 5 of the treaty --
underpins its credibility. It\'s a political commitment by all member
countries to come to the aid of any member whose sovereignty or
territory might be under attack. Ukraine would meet those criteria, but
it is only a partner, not a member.

Nato's doors are open to any European country that wants to join and can
meet the requirements and obligations. [Importantly, Nato takes its
decisions by consensus, so every member has a veto.]{.underline}

The United States spends much more on defence than any other ally and
far outweighs its partners in terms of military muscle. This means it is
often considered the most powerful member.

Nato's day-to-day work is led by its secretary-general --- former Dutch
Prime Minister Mark Rutte.

The organisation's top civilian official chairs almost weekly meetings
of ambassadors in the North Atlantic Council at its Brussels
headquarters. He chairs other "NACs" at ministerial level and summits of
heads of state and government.

Nato's military headquarters is based nearby in Mons, Belgium. It is
always run by a top US officer. The current supreme allied commander
Europe is Army General Christopher Cavoli.

Yet [look a little **more closely**, and the picture is **far less
rosy**]{.underline}. Notwithstanding its apparent unity of purpose since
the start of Russia's war, [NATO looks **out of shape** and **out of

Russia? About China? What sacrifices and risks are the member states
really willing to accept? [Are they willing to pool **sovereignty** in

**[Nothing]{.underline}** in recent weeks [suggests that these questions
will get **clear answers**]{.underline}. For starters, [the]{.underline}

Turkey under]{.underline} President Recep Tayyip [**Erdogan** is a
semi-authoritarian state that **flirts with Russia** and **fumes** at
what it considers European **meddling** over **human rights**. Hungary
under]{.underline} Prime Minister Viktor [**Orban** is taking a
different but **downward path**, fusing wealth and power into a new
**system of control** at home and **undermining** U.S. and European
attempts to put **pressure** on **Russia and China**. **Macron's
relentless posturing** and German Chancellor Olaf **Scholz's
foot-dragging** create **constant obstacles and
distractions**]{.underline}. The two leader's weaknesses, on glorious
display since the start of the war, have already enriched the language:
Scholzen is a German neologism for "dither," while makronic in Polish
(and its equivalent in Ukrainian) can be roughly translated as
"[**vacuous grandstanding** while **doing nothing**]{.underline}."

[Macron and Scholz **corrode decision-making** with their foibles and
thus place a **big question mark** over the alliance's **credibility and
cohesion**. Any threat or provocation from Russia is unlikely to be
**clear or conveniently timed**. More likely it will be something
**deliberately ambiguous**, such as a Russian drone that "accidentally"
strays onto the territory of a front-line state and hits a target.
**Some** countries would favor a tough response. **Others** would fear
escalation and want dialogue. Still others would take the ambiguity as a

Yet [successful]{.underline} security
**[cooperation]{.underline}**---which includes arms transfers, training,
security assistance, treaties, or agreements---[is built around two key
principles: **trust** and **integrity of commitment**, both of which are
**at risk** today]{.underline} thanks to the haphazard US withdrawal
from Afghanistan.

In the US military, [the term **"integrity check"** refers to a concern
about an individual's or unit's **capability** or
**trustworthiness**]{.underline}. Following the debacle in Kabul,
[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and
its **global**]{.underline} security [**cooperation posture** is in
**dire need** of one]{.underline}.

[Just look at the **anger expressed** by stalwart **NATO allies** such
as the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[K]{.underline}**ingdom,
[which in the aftermath of 9/11 **unquestionably joined in** to invoke
the Washington Treaty's **Article 5** for collective self-defense (the
**first time** the Alliance ever did so). That **NATO** launched its
first operations outside the Euro-Atlantic area and began a
**far-reaching transformation of capabilities** signaled its **trust**
in the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates'
[**reliability** when it came to]{.underline} security
**[cooperation]{.underline}**.

Now, [treaty allies and partner nations are **reassessing** their
bilateral]{.underline} security [**relationships** with the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. [It's not just the
NATO states **caught off-guard** by the **haphazard
departure**]{.underline} from Afghanistan [that will **think twice**
before embarking upon **future** military campaigns with
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates.
Resolute defense partners in the Middle East and the
Indo-Pacific---including Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, Japan, South
Korea, and Taiwan---likely also need overt reassurance, such as a clear
national-security strategy and declared recommitments.

Deterrence by Denial

[If **NATO** wants to **deny** Russia the **ability** to successfully
**attack**]{.underline} one or more Baltic states, [it has little choice
but to **deploy forces** on a much larger scale]{.underline} than it
currently does. Such forces could be deployed gradually to avoid giving
Russia a casus belli and to make such deployments more palatable to
skeptical NATO members. The 2017 RAND study proposed deployments of
around 35,000 personnel, with an additional reinforcement capability of
up to about 70,000 personnel;169 this would certainly prevent a Russian
military fait accompli and force Moscow to fight a bloody and drawn-out
conventional war, should it attack. These deployments would also,
perhaps, eliminate most of the difficulties---and some of the resulting
escalation pathways---that stem from the alliance's current need to
reinforce troops rapidly and on a large scale in a crisis. In addition,
these troop deployments would raise the costs to Moscow of deliberately
forcing a military crisis with NATO.

[While such measures might mitigate the short-term risk of deliberate
Russian escalation, they would create a number of **severe political
trade-offs**]{.underline}. First, a deterrence-by-denial approach [would
risk **overstretching** the **delicate political consensus** among NATO
members about conventional **deterrence and assurance**. A number of
member states, perhaps led by **Germany** and **France**, would **not
support** such a policy and would seek to **block it**]{.underline}.
Even more importantly, perhaps, [not even the **Baltic states** are
supportive of such a **maximalist approach**. While many Baltic
officials and experts would like to see greater **U.S. military
engagement** in the region, some of them are **highly skeptical** of the
assumptions underlying the **RAND war games** and think that they are
too **pessimistic** about **Baltic defenses**]{.underline}. While they
would like to see a strong, unified allied response to the growing
threat from Russia, [they also recognize the need to avoid
**unnecessarily escalating** general tensions with
**Russia**]{.underline}.170 Also, against the background of often
contentious debates within NATO about financial and military burden
sharing, [it would **not be clear at all** who would provide the
**necessary funds and forces** for such a **large military
footprint**]{.underline}. Neither the United States nor most other
allies currently seem to be both willing and capable.

### 2AC\-\--No Nato Impact

#### **No NATO impact**

**Bandow '24** \[Doug; JD from Stanford, Senior Fellow at the Cato
Institute; Cato Institute, "Trump Is Blunt and Right About NATO,"
February 22,
<https://www.cato.org/commentary/trump-blunt-right-about-nato>\] owen

Russia's invasion of [[Ukraine]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[**spurred**
Europe]{.mark}an governments [to spend **more**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said 18 of 31 members will meet
the alliance's two percent of GDP standard this year, three times the
number in 2016.

Trump's comment should accelerate this process, probably more than all
the complaining, whining, and demanding of prior presidents combined. He
claimed that the leader of an unidentified large European country asked
if Trump would send in the American cavalry if that nation failed to
meet its NATO obligations. Trump responded: "I said: 'You didn't pay?
You're delinquent?'... 'No I would not protect you. In fact I would
encourage them to do whatever they want. You gotta pay.'"

Donald Trump's limitations are obvious, but he understands Europe, its
addiction to U.S. military welfare, and the resulting cost to this
nation.

No serious person should take Trump's comments as a formal policy
statement. Rather, it sounds like a witty riposte to a whiny Eurocrat
seeking to justify his or her government's irresponsible refusal to
fulfill a state's most fundamental duty, protecting its citizens. What
American angered by decades of European cheap-riding did not secretly
cheer Trump's statement, especially when a febrile gaggle of European
officials responded by wailing that Uncle Sam might stop playing Uncle
Sucker?

One of the more stunning admissions came from the usual unidentified
source, in this case an anonymous European diplomat speaking to Fox
News: "When Trump came along, it woke us up to the fact that the U.S.
might not always act in European interest, especially if it goes against
American interest." That was quite the admission, as the source granted:
"It sounds naive saying it out loud, but that was the assumption a lot
of people made."

Imagine! The problem is not that Europeans gloried in getting American
officials to put Europe first---that is to be expected. Rather, the
outrage is that American officials did so. And apparently did so
routinely, without the slightest sense of shame. It took the
undiplomatic, untutored, potty-mouthed Donald Trump to restore a sense
of sanity to the U.S.--Europe relationship.

Treating the Pentagon as an international welfare agency for well-heeled
clients is not the only problem with NATO today. Creating an alliance so
heavily dependent on one nation encourages other states to fantasize at
America's expense. Their representatives often concoct [grand military
schemes for "[NATO]{.mark}"---in practice **[mean]{.mark}**ing [the
**U.S.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

For instance, shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine, a medley of [Baltic
government [officials proposed]{.mark}]{.underline} imposing a "no-fly
zone" over the latter. To be effective, such a ban would require
[[**shooting down** planes]{.mark} operating [over Russia]{.mark} as
well, [lead]{.mark}ing [to]{.mark} **full-scale**
[war.]{.mark}]{.underline} Yet neither individually nor collectively do
Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania possess anything approaching an "air
force." Obviously, they wouldn't be enforcing a no-fly zone.

More recently, Estonia's President Alar Karis pushed for naval
confrontation with Moscow: "Western countries should establish a
military presence in part of the Black Sea to ensure the safe movement
of commercial and humanitarian aid vessels." Estonia, however, has
precisely six boats, two for coastal combat and four for mining. They
are backed by two planes and two helicopters---for transport. Evidently
someone other than Tallinn would have to do the confronting.

Foreign commentators promote equally ambitious plans. Simon Tisdall,
columnist for the United Kingdom's Guardian newspaper, decided that the
sword was, in fact, more powerful than the pen and wrote a column urging
use of "NATO's overwhelming power to decisively turn the military tide"
in Ukraine. Yet the U.K. military is shrinking and isn't likely to be
turning "the military tide" in Europe or elsewhere.

Two weeks ago, Peter Bator, Slovakia's Permanent Representative to NATO,
came to the U.S. to complain to Americans that the alliance---meaning
them, the Americans---had not intervened on behalf of Ukraine. Rather
melodramatically, he imagined his grandchildren saying, "You were the
most powerful military organization in the world and you decided not to
militarily support Ukraine. Please explain this to me." Tragically, he
couldn't. "I would have difficulties," he admitted. He said he could
"find many fine arguments" of a "theoretical rhetorical" nature but
would "still have problems just explaining it to myself." So off to war
the transatlantic alliance should go!

[[Slovakia has only]{.underline}]{.mark} 17,950 people in the military
and deploys just [[30]{.mark} main battle [tanks]{.mark}]{.underline},
60 artillery pieces, 19 combat aircraft, and 37 helicopters. Obviously,
that doesn't constitute "the most powerful military organization in the
world." Bator must be thinking of borrowing someone else's armed forces
"to militarily support Ukraine." Probably not those of the Baltic states
or London. I wonder whose?

It is one thing to be self-sacrificing and generous with one's own life.
Indeed, that's just Biblical. Alas, that's not what Bator expects. He is
offering to sacrifice the lives of others---in this case, Americans. If
NATO ends up at war with Russia, we all know who would be doing the bulk
of the fighting and dying---Americans. If the conflict were to go
nuclear, we know whom the Russian ICBMs would be targeting---Americans
again. As for Slovakians, Bator undoubtedly would lead them in praising
the U.S. for remaining steadfast for all that is good and wonderful as
its cities burn and people perish. After all, that is Washington's role
in NATO, and he would probably express his satisfaction when talking to
his grandchildren. What could be better than that?

It has long been evident to all that the [transatlantic [alliance is
**unbalanced**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} When it was created in 1949,
even its proponents insisted that the U.S. would not provide a permanent
garrison. Dwight D. Eisenhower declared, "We [[cannot]{.mark} be a
**modern Rome** [guard]{.mark}ing the [far
frontiers]{.mark}]{.underline} with our legions if for no other reason
than that these are not, politically, our frontiers. What we must do is
to assist these people \[to\] regain their confidence and get on their
own military feet."

Unfortunately, the Americans stayed even as the Europeans recovered. And
spent the last [[75 years **cheap-riding**]{.mark} on the
U.S]{.underline}. NATO officials are now celebrating that a majority of
members, supposedly gravely threatened by Moscow, are finally devoting
two cents on the Euro to their defense. Meanwhile, the [[expansion of
NATO]{.underline}]{.mark} helped radicalize not just Vladimir Putin but
the Russian public and was an [important **[trigger]{.mark}**
for]{.underline} Moscow's [invasion of
[Ukraine]{.mark}]{.underline}. Sixteen years ago, Fiona Hill, who gained
notoriety after serving with the Trump National Security
Council, warned President George W. Bush that inducting Ukraine and
Georgia into NATO was "a provocative move that would likely provoke
pre-emptive Russian military action."

Perhaps most perversely, Washington has turned an alliance intended to
augment U.S. security into an international dole. In recent years,
[NATO's expansion policy]{.underline} has been bizarre, [including
nations whose [militaries amount to **rounding
errors**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even the latest additions,
[[Finland]{.underline},]{.mark} added last year, and potentially
[[Sweden]{.underline},]{.mark} which awaits approval from Hungary's
parliament, [[are]{.mark} only [minor powers]{.mark}]{.underline}
despite their PR buildup. (What sets Helsinki apart is its outsize
reserve.) [Nor do they make America more secure.]{.underline} Rather,
[the U.S. has again **expanded its responsibilities** in confronting a
major conventional military power which possesses nuclear
weapons.]{.underline}

#### NATO is perceived as [weak]{.underline} by [adversarial states]{.underline}\-\--that means [one consultation]{.underline} can't solve the [net benefit]{.underline}.

Reality check

[[NATO's]{.mark} current [thinking]{.mark} is [that, because Russia has
not rolled tanks into NATO territory, deterrence has not]{.mark}
[failed.]{.mark}]{.underline} Nevertheless, there should be no surprise
if Russian President Vladimir Putin changes his calculus and tests NATO
sooner. [[One should not be]{.mark} [complacent in thinking]{.mark} that
[NATO's deterrence posture works]{.mark} as intended]{.underline} when,
after three years of war, Russia continues to insist on achieving its
military objectives in Ukraine, on NATO's withdrawal to its borders of
1997, and continues to conduct hybrid attacks against NATO allies. [It
is concerning that [NATO lacks comparable military capabilities]{.mark}
during an active war in Europe, while facing the prospect of armed
aggression before 2030]{.underline}, if not sooner. [These are not
hypothetical scenarios - German [intelligence warned]{.mark} recently
that **[Russia is looking to "test" NATO]{.mark}** in the
Baltics.]{.underline}

Allies must recognise the limits of their current deterrence posture if
they are to change Putin's calculus as he attempts to rewrite history.
NATO must also understand that a failure to stop Russia now encourages
future aggression. **[The [weakness of NATO dates to
2008]{.mark}]{.underline}**, when its flawed decision to promise
eventual membership to Georgia and Ukraine---without saying when or
how---gave Russia an incentive to attack Georgia and later Ukraine, and
to launch hybrid attacks across Europe, raising the risk of war with
NATO itself.

US President Donald [[Trump's reluctance to get tough with Putin gives
Russia confidence in attacking Ukraine and]{.mark} [beyond.]{.mark}
Trump's willingness to repeat Russian narratives and resume trade
[signals to Putin that **NATO is**]{.mark} **[weak and
divided.]{.mark}**]{.underline} If Putin sways Trump into blocking
Ukraine's NATO accession as a "root cause" of the war, it will create a
precedent to invoke Baltic-Nordic NATO membership as grounds for a
future conflict. Would Trump risk the US stock market over an incursion
into Narva in Estonia, or Kybartai in Lithuania, especially after
sealing multi-billion trade deal with Moscow? If President Trump excused
Russian attacks on Ukrainian civilians as a mistake, he could similarly
dismiss as a misunderstanding a potential incident in a NATO country
that was once part of Soviet territory. [The US is in NATO, but [Putin
knows]{.mark} that **[Trump does not have faith in]{.mark} its [shared
values.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

The reality is that [Putin is so committed to continuing his war in
Ukraine that he left the [US]{.mark}-brokered [peace]{.mark} [process in
tatters, exposing]{.mark} the **[diplomatic weakness of]{.mark} both
[America and Europe]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} The conscription of
another 160,000 men, combat training for high schoolers, growing ties
with China, and a military build-up near Finland suggest that [Russia
may test NATO amid Europe's hurried rearmament and American retrenchment
of its European deployments.]{.underline} Meanwhile, China enables
Russia's destruction of European security by diplomatic cover, through
the export of dual-use goods, support for Russian weapons manufacturing,
and with Chinese volunteers on the frontline. Beijing continues to learn
from Russian war experience in Europe, enabling it to threaten stability
in Asia.

#### The summit [solved nothing]{.underline}\-\--NATO is still as [obsolete]{.underline} as it was before and [alternative]{.underline} forums for defense are [key]{.underline}. 

**Kettle 6/26** \[Martin Kettle is a Guardian associate editor and
columnist. "Without dignity, leaders fell at Trump's feet in The Hague

//aka

[Nato's [Hague summit was an **orchestrated grovel**]{.mark} at the feet
of Donald Trump.]{.underline} The originally planned two-day meeting was
truncated into a single morning's official business to flatter the
president's ego and accommodate his short attention span. The agenda was
cynically narrowed to focus on the defence spending hikes he demands
from US allies. [[Issues that may provoke]{.mark} or embarrass
[Trump]{.mark} -- the Ukraine conflict, or whether the Iranian nuclear
threat has actually been eliminated by US bombing -- were **[relegated
to the sidelines.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Instead, [the flattery throttle was opened up to maximum, with Nato's
secretary general Mark Rutte leading the assembled fawning.]{.underline}
On Tuesday, Rutte hymned Trump's brilliance over Iran; yesterday, he
garlanded him as the vindicated visionary of Nato's drive towards the 5%
of GDP spending goal. No one spoiled the party. As the president's own
former adviser Fiona Hill put it yesterday, [Nato seemed briefly to have
[turned into the]{.mark} **[North Atlantic Trump
Organization.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

For Rutte and most of the alliance leaders, however, this was 24 hours
of self-abasement with a specific goal. [The purpose of this first Nato
summit of the second Trump presidency was to keep the US as fully on
board as possible with the transatlantic alliance. Nothing else
mattered.]{.underline} Any repetition of the shocks that JD Vance and
Pete Hegseth delivered to Europe at the Munich security conference in
February was to be avoided at all costs. In pursuit of that objective,
**[no humiliation or hypocrisy was too gross.]{.underline}**

So, was it mission accomplished for Nato? Maybe yes, judging by Trump's
generally good behaviour in The Hague. The 5% pledge was "very big
news", he announced. The US was still committed to Nato's article 5
collective-defence doctrine, he appeared to say at his post-summit press
conference, though his curious choice of words -- "We are here to help
them protect their country" -- will not reassure everyone. The leaders
have nevertheless emerged with what Henry James called "the equanimity
of a result". [The Nato summit got what it was designed to
get.]{.underline}

[But in **every longer term way,** this [appeasement of Trump **solves
nothing.**]{.mark}]{.underline} In political terms [the Hague
[summit]{.mark} [does not mark]{.mark} the [resumption of normal
relationships, let alone]{.mark} the [beginning of]{.mark} a new Nato
[golden age.]{.mark} Such things are [**not possible in the Trump
era**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Politically, the summit was a bunker buster
dodged. True, things have not got worse, an outcome that many, including
Rutte, will regard as a kind of achievement. However, [[none of Nato's
other **preexisting difficulties** has been solved.]{.mark} Most remain
firmly in place.]{.underline}

\'Daddy has to sometimes use strong language\': Nato chief on Trump\'s
Israel-Iran outburst -- video

0:24

\'Daddy has to sometimes use strong language\': Nato chief on Trump\'s
Israel-Iran outburst -- video

Of these, four stand out. [The first and most immediate is Ukraine.
There has been [no change in Trump's impatience]{.mark} [with
Ukraine]{.mark}, his belief in a ceasefire or his [unwillingness to
renew]{.mark} US military [aid.]{.mark} But [nor can]{.mark} the
[other]{.mark} Nato [members supply]{.mark} the aid that
[Ukraine]{.mark} needs. So the war grinds on, in part because of Trump.
Some believe **the [war could]{.mark} even [become
permanent.]{.mark}**]{.underline} "Rather than assuming the war can be
ended through a comprehensive battlefield victory or a negotiated
compromise," the Carnegie Endowment analyst and former Ukrainian defence
minister Andriy Zagorodnyuk wrote earlier this month, "Ukraine and its
allies must plan to build a viable, sovereign and secure state under
constant military pressure." Trump would not be interested in that.

The second difficulty is Trump's sheer unpredictability. Everything was
well choreographed in The Hague, but for how long will this last? No one
can say for sure. The world is still absorbing the implications of
Trump's impulsive handling of Iran, in which military action was
repudiated in favour of diplomacy one day, before war was launched the
next, followed by the proclamation of peace on the one after that. [The
Iran bombing has reminded the US's [Nato]{.mark} allies of **just how
[little sway]{.mark} they actually possess [over]{.mark} the
[president]{.mark}**, and has underscored the difficulty of
second-guessing Trump's actions.]{.underline}

This feeds through into the third problem. [The commitment to
[spend]{.mark} 5% of GDP [on defence is]{.mark} a policy goal **[not a
present reality.]{.mark}**]{.underline} [T]{.mark}he UK, for instance,
aims to get to 5% by 2035, and it will only do so through some
jiggery-pokery over what can legitimately be classified as security, as
the government's new national security strategy document, published on
Tuesday to coincide with the Nato summit, makes clear.

**[Ten years is a long time. Much will change.]{.underline}** Trump's
successors may be more committed to Nato, or they may be even more
unreliable than he is. There could be regime change in other places too.
No one knows. Warfare is certain to change, as the drone revolution has
shown. Nato needs to be careful not to bring 20th-century assumptions to
bear on 21st-century planning. The national security strategy document
rightly posits this period as an era of "radical uncertainty". Yet
investors, including investors in high value hi-tech industries such as
defence, abhor uncertainty.

Which brings us to the fourth problem. [[Patching things up with Trump
may **solve nothing**]{.mark} because he marches to his own
drum.]{.underline} But **[the [threats do not go
away]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This means that the [European Nato
[nations]{.mark} and Canada [have to forge a viable]{.mark}
[system]{.mark} of collective defence against hostile threats that is
[not]{.mark}]{.underline} [[dependent on]{.mark} the [whims of the
person in]{.mark} the [White House]{.mark} at every turn]{.underline}.
That is a very large task. But Washington cannot have a veto on whether
the nations of Europe defend themselves against, say, Russian
aggressions.

There is no real choice in the circumstances. The allies are faced with
the huge task of gradually reducing their long dependency on the US's
technology and armaments without provoking a complete rupture with the
US. At the same time, they must increase their own and Europe's defence
capacity. It is a devilishly difficult course, with which Britain's
political leaders, never mind Britain's security world, would be
profoundly uncomfortable. Yet that is the one on which we are embarked.

**[[Cowardice]{.mark} ill befits a military alliance. But it
[dominated]{.mark} yesterday's [Nato summit]{.mark} in the
Hague.]{.underline}** The alliance leaders who gathered in the Dutch
city showed that they were [more frightened of Donald Trump than of
Vladimir Putin.]{.underline}

[To appease the US president, they [cut the agenda short, sidelined

his modern counterparts are striving to impress another
potentate]{.underline}, the emperor Donald I.

• 'Daddy' Trump takes centre stage as Nato bows to his demands

Foremost among them was Nato's secretary-general, Mark Rutte. The former
Dutch prime minister took the national characteristic of pragmatism to
new levels in his obsequious treatment of the US president. He phrased a
text message (duly posted on social media by the world's most powerful
leader) in a near-parody of Trumpspeak. It thanked "Donald" for making
the allies agree a new defence-spending target of 5 per cent of GDP,
gushing "Europe is going to pay in a BIG way, as they should, and it
will be your win".

Hard-pressed countries close to Russia are already meeting or even
beating the 5 per cent level. But they cannot make up for foot-dragging
elsewhere. "Lithuania can spend 100 per cent ... but it would still not
be enough to cover for those who are not meeting their commitments,"
says Gabrielius Landsbergis, his country's former foreign minister.
Spain says it will do all that's required of it but without spending 5
per cent. Belgium and Slovakia are wavering publicly; others mutter
privately that the target is too high.

Luckily for them and for Putin, wiggle room abounds. The 5 per cent
includes 1.5 per cent for other security spending. That can cover
admirable efforts to help Ukraine, boost resilience and catch Russian
spies. [It is also an easy fudge for those wanting to cook their books.
Even more conveniently, the [deadline is a **comfy 2035**]{.mark}, by
when few if any of the politicians thronging the Hague this week will
still be in office.]{.underline}

More importantly, extravagant military spending is politically unpopular
and economically crippling. "It destroyed the Soviet Union," noted a
summit participant reflectively. The European Nato allies combined are
ten times richer than Russia. If they spent even their existing defence
budgets properly, the job would be done. **[[Promising to spend]{.mark}
a lot of [money in the future does not fill]{.mark} the dangerous [holes
in defence and]{.mark} [deterrence right now.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

• Trump swears on live TV --- but is he the first president to do so?

The upbeat tone this week stemmed mainly from the knowledge that even
greater disasters were averted. For a start, the summit happened; only a
few months ago, holding it looked risky. Trump turned up. He did not
lose his temper. He and his administration still pay at least lip
service to the defence of Europe. Despite his on-off bromance with
Putin, the summit communiqué did mention Russia as a "long-term" threat
("immediate" would be a better adjective); Trump declined to endorse
that explicitly, merely calling the Russian leader "misguided".

Nato's previous promises to Ukraine were not repeated, but they were not
cancelled either. Volodymyr Zelensky was excluded from the leaders'
meeting, but lionised elsewhere. Even the Ukrainian leader's one-on-one
with the US president was civil. He "couldn't have been nicer", said
Trump, hinting that he might sell Ukraine some sorely needed Patriot
air-defence systems.

That welcome news came at a press conference which showed the US
president in a mostly sunny, self-congratulatory mood. Most importantly,
he admitted that his Nato counterparts had changed his view of the
alliance, revealing "these people really love their countries; it's not
a rip-off". After decades in which he has disparaged Nato in splenetic
terms, that counts as a glowing endorsement.

Only hours earlier he had caused conniptions by casting doubt on Nato's
core collective-defence pledge. The US commitment to defending Europe,
he said, depended on which of the "numerous definitions" of Article 5
was involved. As so often with Trump's statements, this had a grain of
truth. The 145 words in the Atlantic Charter's most-cited clause only
encourage, not oblige, members to come to each other's defence when
attacked.

[Measured against the scale of the challenge, not the potential for
disaster, **the scorecard looks different.**]{.underline} [The intense
[focus on Trump's mood and]{.mark} choice of [words highlights]{.mark}
the [alliance's **vulnerability to the**]{.mark} **[president's
caprice.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Nato relies on the US to plug numerous
holes. They include skimpy stockpiles of munitions and spare parts, air
and missile defence, long-range firepower, and the vital "enablers" such
as intelligence and logistics. These assets are already thinly
stretched: "only one of everything" says General Ben Hodges, the former
US army commander in Europe. The best that can be said is that if allies
find Trump's approach confusing, Putin will too. Sometimes ambiguity
trumps clarity.

[But **the [delays and dithering are]{.mark} still
[ingrained.]{.mark}**]{.underline} As Landsbergis noted: "Ukraine is
falling through the cracks." As the summit buzzed and blathered, Russian
drone and rocket attacks killed scores of Ukrainian civilians, barely

### 1AR\-\--No Nato\-\--Eastward Expansion

#### NATO is [obsolete]{.underline}. It's more likely to [anger]{.underline} Russia.

Three decades on, [we are still **stuck** with the
alliance]{.underline}, and as recent events demonstrate, it is no
laughing matter. [NATO has become **obsolete**]{.underline}. Indeed,
Washington's whole [Europe-first orientation is **anachronistic**, a
wasteful, expensive holdover from the **cold war** that ought to have
been abandoned **years ago** and that **distracts** us from the true
dangers we face abroad]{.underline}.

Mearsheimer, to his credit, deplored this development more vehemently
than anyone. A self-described "unrepentant realist," he had no patience
for the aggressive internationalism that defined Western statecraft in
the Clinton, Bush, and Obama presidencies. [NATO as an anti-Soviet bloc
made sense]{.underline} to him; [NATO as an **ever-expanding** club of
vaguely like-minded nations was **foolish**---and dangerous. According
to the tenets of **realism**, when one great power trespasses upon
another's sphere of influence, the result is nearly **always conflict**,
and]{.underline} Mearsheimer insisted that [that was the case with
**NATO's eastward march**. It did not matter that officials from
the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates a[nd
its European allies insisted that they had no designs on
Russia]{.underline}. Russian President Vladimir [**Putin was not
convinced**. He **perceived** their **encroachment** as an **existential
threat** and responded **violently**, first by annexing
**Crimea**]{.underline} in 2014, [then by invading
**Ukraine**]{.underline} in 2022. While [most pundits in the West
**denounced** Putin's barefaced breach of **international
law**]{.underline}, Mearsheimer proclaimed that **[NATO was to
blame]{.underline}**, that [its leaders ought to have recognized that
their apparent intent to incorporate **Russia's bordering countries**
into **their alliance** would trigger war, and that Putin was **only
doing** what an American president would do if, say, Iran built a
military association and invited **Mexico and Canada** to
join]{.underline}. In a gauntlet-flinging guest essay for the Economist
in March and a follow-up interview in the New Yorker, Mearsheimer
condemned NATO for naiveté and called for a pragmatic solution to the
crisis that would keep Ukraine as a neutral country and leave Putin in
power, with Crimea and the Donbas in his grasp.

I am not a realist, repentant or otherwise, and I have problems with
Mearsheimer's glibness and moral relativism. Nonetheless, I agree with
him that [NATO **no longer** serves a coherent purpose. The principal
geopolitical challenge to U.S. primacy in the 21st century comes from
**China**. That is where America's focus should be. Russia might still
qualify as a great power in terms of boots on the ground, but its
economy is **one-dimensional** and shot through with **corruption**, its
population **shrinking and aging**, its weapons and equipment
**outmoded**, and its troops **demoralized**. By no stretch of the
imagination could it overrun Europe as the old Soviet Union once seemed
capable of doing. **Britain and France** have nuclear weapons. They do
not need the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates [to defend them]{.underline}. Why, then, does
Washington continue to station forces in Europe and bear most of the
cost of this transatlantic military partnership?

Institutional factors play a role, of course---NATO employs many
bureaucrats who have a stake in its preservation, and no business
dissolves itself voluntarily---but the main reason, in my opinion, is
that [Americans have yet to outgrow the **delusions** that prevailed
in]{.underline} what neoconservative columnist Charles Krauthammer
called [the "**unipolar moment**," that heady time after the cold war
ended and no one appeared to threaten the security of the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. Flush with victory,
Washington policymakers believed that [they could use this period of
unprecedented economic, military, diplomatic, and geopolitical supremacy
to remake the world in the **American image**, and they thought NATO was
the **perfect vehicle**]{.underline} for accomplishing this goal on the
Eurasian landmass. Thus they changed NATO's original mandate and set
about trying to foster liberal democracies in new member states like
Hungary, Estonia, Bulgaria, and Slovakia. (Of course, the War on Terror
saw this pattern extended to the greater Middle East, as the George W.
Bush administration sought to democratize Afghanistan and Iraq.) A
widely held assumption was that increasing the number of liberal
democracies would make war less likely, since democracies do not fight
one another. NATO aggrandizement would therefore create a broad zone of
peace from the Elbe River to the gates of Russia, and perhaps beyond.

[Events have not played out in that fashion. Far from nourishing
democracy, NATO has **seen the rise** of **far-right nationalist
political movements** in four of its oldest and most powerful
members---**Britain**]{.underline}, **[Germany]{.underline}**,
**[France]{.underline}**, [and the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates---while Viktor [**Orbán's** second term as
Hungarian prime minister witnessed an erosion of **press freedom**, a
decrease in **judicial independence**, and Hungary's descent by eleven
places on the **Democracy Index**. Similar democratic backsliding has
characterized]{.underline} Recep Tayyip [Erdoğan's **Turkey**
and]{.underline} Jaroslaw [Kaczynski's **Poland**]{.underline}. As for
being a force for peace, the carnage in [Ukraine serves as **eloquent
testimony** to NATO's **failure**]{.underline} in this regard.
Mearsheimer's diagnosis of the origins of the conflict may be
wrong---Putin might have tried to integrate neighboring nations into a
greater Russia regardless of Western actions---but [NATO did **nothing**
to halt his aggression]{.underline}. And, of course, there is the
perennial free-riding problem, with [America's allies counting on
Washington to protect them even if their economies are robust enough to
**pay for their own defense**. Moving NATO eastward has increased the
number of countries America is **obliged to safeguard**]{.underline} at
a time when a COVID-induced recession makes such commitments
unaffordable.

Clearly, [NATO has **outlived** its usefulness to the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. The Biden
administration [should **disengage** from the alliance as soon as
practicable]{.underline}. This can be done diplomatically, with some
face-saving rhetoric and assurances that the departure of U.S. troops
will not adversely affect Euro-American investment or trade. We could
also remind nations like Spain and Turkey that they remain free to arm
themselves to the teeth with American-made weapons---provided, of
course, that they foot the bill. Then Washington should recalibrate its
grand strategy to conform to the changed global balance of power.

Ever since its foundation in 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) has had a straightforward strategy to maintain peace
in Europe: "keep the Soviet Union out, the United States in, and the
Germans down,". For the past 70 years, this strategy has been incredibly
successful, preventing interstate wars between its member nations,
forcing the United States to maintain a large military presence in
Europe, and keeping the Soviet Union isolated, eventually leading to
their total collapse. However, in recent years, [NATO has been suffering
from a **crisis of purpose**, and many of its members are **no longer
convinced** of the value of being in the alliance]{.underline}. While
the most inflammatory example of this has been President Donald Trump's
position that NATO has become "obsolete", the truth is that [the
organization is facing **serious structural problems** that are
inhibiting its ability to ensure European security]{.underline}.

In 2014, the pro-Russian Ukrainian government was toppled by a massive
protest movement. In the chaotic aftermath, Russian special forces
seized the strategically significant state of Crimea and helped two
eastern states break off and form an independent pro-Russian nation.
Ever since, Ukraine has been engaged in a protracted "soft war" against
militias and secret military units, supplied and armed by Russia, that
has lead to the deaths of tens of thousands and been a constant source
of instability in Kiev. While Ukraine is not a member of NATO and is
therefore not subject to its protections, [Russia's aggressive actions
have made neighboring nations fearful of being next on the target list,
consequently **dividing the military alliance** on how to secure it's
eastern front from it's old enemy]{.underline}.

Case in point, [**Germany** was once the frontline against the Soviet
Union during the Cold War]{.underline}. However, [with the dissolution
of the USSR, it is **now separated** from its successor state Russia by
nations such as Poland, Ukraine, and the Baltic States, and it **no
longer** faces a **direct** physical threat from the Red Army. As a
result, Germany has **slashed its spending** on defense, disbanded
**dozens** of brigades, and **resisted calls** by the US and those same
former-Soviet nations to provide **concrete military support** to shore
up NATO's new front line in the east from recent Russian
aggression]{.underline}. Although the two are not consistently
cooperative allies, [Germany's economic growth and subsequent need for
more markets have driven it to **engage in more long-term cooperation
with Russia**]{.underline}. For example, while it has sanctioned Russia
over its invasion of eastern Ukraine, [it has also partnered with Moscow
to build a massive new **pipeline** in Nord Stream 2, which would
compound Europe's **energy dependence** on the east, and has continually
tried to negotiate to **remove** those same 0. NATO members
**France**]{.underline}, **[Italy]{.underline}**, [**Hungary** and
**Turkey**, just to name a few, have also shown themselves to be
**hesitant** to categorize Russia as an **enemy** and **blocked moves**
within the organization to mobilize more resources and forces to counter
the perceived threat from the east]{.underline}.

On the other hand, ever since Russia's 2014 invasion of eastern Ukraine,
NATO members [**Poland** and **Romania** have been front and center in
trying to **resist Russian pressure**]{.underline} imposed on former
Soviet nations. While NATO nations have joined together to condemn and
sanction Russia for its actions as well as rotate more troops into
Poland and the Baltic countries for training exercises, these eastern
nations have long been demanding something more concrete: permanently
stationed armed brigades. [These nations believe that current NATO
actions are **wildly insufficient**]{.underline} to counter the growing
Russian threat, and have become increasingly exasperated at the lack of
concerted action taken by the alliance. The United States is also in
agreement and has continually been frustrated by NATO members' lack of
military preparedness and investment in their own defense. Even though
the old days of the Cold War are long gone, US foreign policy still
identifies Russia as an enemy to be contained, and has been eager to
support former-Soviet nations defending themselves against Putin's
ambitions. However, as [all matters of policy and military deployment
have to be made by **consensus** from NATO's 29 members, and with wildly
**divergent priorities** from all sides, members have increasingly taken
to simply **bypassing** the NATO decision-making process
**entirely**]{.underline} and pursuing bilateral or trilateral
negotiation.

In the face of increasing Russian pressure and a lack of concerted
action by NATO, Poland has reached out to the United States directly for
protection. After a relatively short negotiation period, the US has
deployed two new infantry brigades to Polish bases, strengthened its
armored contingent in the region, and agreed on a plan to build a new
forward-deployment base in Poland which would house an additional 1,000
US troops. With the speed at which these decisions were taken, other
nations have fallen into a similar pattern of negotiations.

Just last month, **[Romania]{.underline}** announced that it was going
to build a new military base close to the Black Sea Coast to serve as a
forward deployment point for US troops stationed nearby. Like Poland, it
fears Russian attempts to restore its prior control over the region,
such as its covert invasion of eastern Ukraine in 2014.
**[Bulgaria]{.underline}** too is building up its military forces,
partnering with the US to invest in expanding one of its major bases and
purchasing a large number of tanks and missile systems from the United
States. **[Lithuania]{.underline}** has agreed to host a rotating US
motorized brigade and purchased new US military equipment to train with.
Yet it is significant that [these decisions were made between Romanian
and Bulgarian and US defense officials. Just like **so many other**
security decisions these days, they were made **outside, not inside, the
NATO framework**, further demonstrating its **debilitating ability** to
galvanize **concerted action**]{.underline}.

### 1AR\-\--No Nato\-\--Finances

#### It's financially unsustainable AND Europe alone solves 

**Bandow '5-22** \[Doug; JD from Stanford, Senior Fellow at the Cato
Institute; Cato Institute, "America Can't Afford to Protect Europe from
Russia February 22,
<https://www.cato.org/commentary/america-cant-afford-protect-europe-russia>\]
owen

Of course, [[Moscow]{.mark} is [using up]{.mark} **much of its
[manpower]{.mark}**]{.underline} and materiel [[to fight]{.mark} a
**brutal** war against [Ukraine.]{.mark}]{.underline} However, the Putin
government has demonstrated that even a weaker economy under sanction
can act quickly to produce significant quantities of weapons. Surely the
[[Europeans could do more]{.underline}]{.mark}---[**[if they
believed]{.mark}** that doing so [was
**important**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Instead, they continue to go easy
both on aid to Ukraine and their own defense. While expecting the U.S.
to continue to protect them during what promises to be, if they have
their way, a very, very long transition to a truly European defense of
Europe.

Although it is difficult to imagine an American case against a European
defense of Europe, U.S. policymakers, in contrast to Americans more
generally, have long benefited from a helplessly dependent Europe that
typically lined up behind American initiatives while wielding
American-made weapons. Edward Lucas of the Center for European Policy
Analysis warned that, in the future, on issues of mutual interest there
"will be far more a partnership of equals. On other issues---such as
global financial management, conflict in the Middle East, and
international law---Europeans will have their own ideas and their own
priorities." Indeed, Kishore Mahbubani, celebrated author with
Singapore's Asia Research Institute, has called on Europe to formally
set a new course, indicating its willingness "to quit NATO," reach a
deal with Russia, "with each side accommodating the other's core
interests," and "work out a new strategic compact with China."

No doubt, such an approach would horrify Washington policymakers,
including many around Trump. For instance, Secretary of State Marco
Rubio rejected suggestions that the U.S. might leave the transatlantic
alliance: "The United States is as active in NATO as it has ever been."
However, Americans should imagine a better future, one in which
[Europe]{.underline}, with [more than [**ten times** Russia's
**GDP**]{.mark} and **[three times]{.mark}** Russia's
**[population]{.mark}**]{.underline}, not the U.S., [stood up to Moscow
while trying to engineer better relations]{.underline} with it. And in
which Europe deployed its own forces to protect more distant interests,
such as European commerce targeted by Yemen's Houthis. Most Americans
would applaud such a result. [Burden shedding]{.underline}, not sharing,
[should be Washington's strategy for the future.]{.underline}

This is especially the case since its traditional determination to
dominate allies and adversaries alike is bankrupt. The [[U.S.]{.mark} is
running [**unsustainable** deficits]{.mark},]{.underline} more than
[\$[2 trillion]{.mark} annually]{.underline}, nearing the post-World War
II [**[record]{.mark}** of **106 percent** [debt to
GDP]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [**[drown]{.mark}ing** [in]{.mark} rising
[interest]{.mark} payments]{.underline}, more than \$1 trillion a year.
All these at a time without a hot war, pandemic, or financial crisis.
Passage of the GOP tax bill will fuel the debt rise, which could become
a tsunami if the [economy falls into a
**[recession.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Over the long term, spending,
deficits, interest payments, and debt are [headed ever
upward]{.underline}, with [no limit in sight. With]{.underline}
draconian [[cuts in]{.mark} **[S]{.mark}**ocial **[S]{.mark}**ecurity,
Medicare, and Medicaid **[unlikely,]{.mark}**]{.underline} the
[[Pentagon will]{.mark} eventually [be]{.mark}come the **prime budget
[target]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Taxes will almost certainly be
raised along the way, but which U.S. politician will propose making
Americans pay even more so Europeans can pay even less?

Kallas, Meloni, and many other Europeans still hope to play Uncle Sam
for Uncle Sucker. However, the [[American people]{.mark} elected Donald
**[Trump]{.mark}** to [say no more]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is time for
Washington to treat Europeans as friends, adults, and allies, rather
than suffer them as clients, dependents, and deadbeats.

### 2AC\-\--No Multilat

[[reveal]{.mark}]{.underline} not only the WTO's [[structural

Ultimately, [[Japan **cannot afford** to be uninvolved in]{.mark} the
[Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. Historically[, Japan always maintained
geopolitical angst emanating from its northern flank]{.underline}.
Whether Mongols, in the 13th century, or the Czars in the 18th-19th
century, or the Soviets in the 20th century, or a revanchist Russia and
China today, Japanese threat horizons are dominated by northern
strategic risk specifically, and the concern regarding resources of an
island nation more broadly. [[If]{.mark} the Arctic is **[closed
by]{.mark} a [competitor]{.mark}**---or worse a competitor **increases
their military** posture in the region in a place like the
Russian-occupied Kurils---the direct approaches to the [Japanese home
islands will be threatened]{.mark}]{.underline}. Furthermore[, such
adversarial encroachment in the Arctic is increasing perceptions of
strategic isolation -- particularly those sea lines of communication
(SLOC) reaching back to their only treaty ally, the United
States]{.underline}. [Japan's historical threat horizons remain
essentially unchanged because of the geography of the Northern
Pacific]{.underline}. There is no doubt that, as Nicholas Spykman
surmised, geography is the most important influence in geopolitics
because it is the most permanent (Spykman, 1983). Likewise, [based on
the increasing geopolitical alignment of Japanese regional security
interests with their constitutionally--directed alliance with the United
States, something that has only increased in the last decade, the
[Japanese will be **pulled north** toward the Arctic]{.mark} to support
alliance efforts to maintain their broader concept of a "Free and Open
Indo-Pacific" in cooler climes]{.underline} (Japanese Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, 2021). As it does for all its efforts in Northeast
Asia, [the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates will continue to [rely on
forward-postured military forces in Japan]{.mark} for securing its
Arctic interests]{.underline}. [This [**US necessity**, combined with
Japan's own]{.mark} **[security interests]{.mark}** in the region, will
further [**drive U.S.-Japan coordination and cooperation** for
**securing their shared interests**]{.mark}]{.underline} [against
Sino-Russian inroads in the Arctic]{.underline}. There is little doubt
[that [Washington's and Tokyo's overlapping security interests will
drive burden-sharing]{.mark} as they both seek to contain Russian and
Chinese Arctic ambitions]{.underline}. Indeed, it already seems that
this return to Hokushin-ron, alongside its US allies is already
underway. US Arctic-qualified soldiers from the 11th Airborne Division
based in Alaska have just concluded a major bi-lateral exercise with
Japan's Northern Army---"North Wind"---in the snow-swept expanses of
Hokkaidō (Robson, 2024). [Japan is returning its strategic gaze to its
north---to the Arctic---and preparing for the emerging challenges that
face a Polar Great Power]{.underline}. Indeed, it appears that the Land
of the Rising Sun and the Land of the Midnight Sun are converging, as
they have throughout history, once again. In a possible twist of
history, who knows if for the 100th anniversary of this article's
opening battle the grandson of 2LT Vada Miller may be reading about
joint U.S.-Japan Arctic exercises to deter Russia being conducted out of
Dutch Harbor. It would be a strange site, indeed, to see allied F-35's
emblazoned with the Stars and Stripes and Rising Sun roaring off into
the Bering Sea to conduct bi-lateral combat air patrols---all while the
nearby onion-domed Holy Ascension Russian Orthodox Church in Unalaska
looks on.

#### The counterplan [reinvigorates]{.underline} relations and [prevents]{.underline} Japan from pursuing a nuclear arsenal

https://nautilus.org/napsnet/napsnet-special-reports/the-nuclear-dimension-of-the-u-s-japan-alliance/\]/

The [[US-Japan]{.mark} military [alliance]{.mark} is [overlooked as a
**crucial element** for]{.mark} either promoting or
[discouraging]{.mark} nuclear [prolif]{.mark}eration]{.underline}.
[**[Future developments]{.mark}** in the alliance [will be a **major
determining factor** for]{.mark} [whether Japan]{.mark} decides to
[pursue]{.mark} an **independent [nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}**
capability]{.underline}. This paper looks at how US nuclear policy would
affect Japan's nuclear decisions, and concludes, contrary to
conventional wisdom, that US sponsorship of a nuclear-free zone for
Northeast Asia would be the most effective means of preventing Japan
from going nuclear. [There is [no guarantee that Japan would]{.mark}
[not pursue a nuclear option]{.mark} under the right
circumstances,]{.underline} [especially [if the US]{.mark}]{.underline}
either moves closer to China or [**[withdraws from Asia]{.mark}**
altogether]{.underline}. Historically, [the debate in Japan over whether
to develop nuclear weapons has not centered]{.underline} around the
credibility of the US nuclear deterrent, but rather [around the [belief
that possession of a]{.mark} [nuc]{.mark}lear weapons arsenal would
[allow Japan]{.mark} [to pursue]{.mark} an [**independent role**]{.mark}
in world affairs]{.underline}. Thus [[US]{.mark} [policy]{.mark} toward
its alliance with Japan will be a **[major determining factor]{.mark}**
in Japan's nuclear future,]{.underline} along with such considerations
as the possible development of a Korean nuclear capability or an
expansion of Chinese nuclear capability. In addition to its bilateral
relations with Japan, the United States' overall nuclear policy will be
a major determining factor in Japan's nuclear choices. Current US
nuclear policy exhibits a fundamental contradiction between the United
States interest in building up its own nuclear policy and its support of
efforts for global nonproliferation. This contradiction can be overcome
by stigmatizing nuclear weapons use through moving toward a no-first use
policy and relying on the UN Security Council to respond to any nuclear
weapons use. Preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons is
increasingly cited as one of the most important, if not the most
important, objective of U.S. policy in the post-cold war period.
Speaking before the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council in December
1997, for example, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said, "I trust
we also agree that the gravest potential threat to our security in the
next century may come from beyond Europe, from the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction."1Furthermore, both NATO and the G-8 have
emphasized the centrality of the proliferation problem.2 Specifically,
U.S. officials suggest that the greatest danger to U.S. national
security is the acquisition and use of nuclear weapons by rogue states
or terrorist groups against the United States or its allies.3 Despite
policymakers' professed beliefs, however, operational and procurement
policy for nuclear forces remains focused on deterring a deliberate
surprise attack on U.S. territory by the strategic nuclear forces of
Russia. 4 The strategic nuclear forces remain on alert ready to be
targeted and fired at a range of military targets in Russia. However,
any realistic appraisal of nuclear dangers would suggest that neither
rogue states/terrorist groups nor a deliberate Russian attack is the
right focus if the goal of U.S. national security policy is to prevent
the use of nuclear weapons anywhere in the world. The most immediate
danger is that India and Pakistan will stumble into a nuclear war
following their nuclear tests and their apparent determination to deploy
nuclear forces. A second danger will continue to be that Russian
missiles will be fired on the United States by accident or as a result
of unauthorized action. Over the longer run, these threats will be
eclipsed by the danger that the non-proliferation regime will collapse
and other states will develop nuclear weapons. A terrorist threat
should, in my view, become a matter of serious concern only if there is
much wider dispersal of nuclear weapons among states stemming from an
open collapse of the non-proliferation regime. Preventing nuclear
proliferation depends on addressing the problem not only on a global
basis, but also region by region in key areas of the world.
Specifically, preventing further proliferation in Northeast Asia- and in
particular, in Japan- is the subject of this paper. If conflict is to
occur among the major nuclear weapons powers, it is most likely to take
place in Northeast Asia. The United States, Russia, and China all have
substantial military forces in the region as well as major stakes in the
area; in addition, there are many sources of potential conflict among
the three and their allies within the region, including the future of
both the Korean peninsula and Taiwan, and control of both natural
resources and territory in local seas. Not only do these three most
active nuclear weapons states confront each other in this area, but it
is also the home to four other states -- Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and
North Korea -- that have contemplated the development of nuclear weapons
and have the capacity to develop a serious nuclear weapons capability.5
Thus, there [is no doubt that the **future** of **nuclear weapons** in
the international system will be determined in substantial part by what
happens in **Northeast Asia**]{.underline}, and the future of
international politics in this area will have a major impact on efforts
to control nuclear proliferation. In order to understand the
non-proliferation policy options -- and their interaction -- in
Northeast Asia, this paper will first examine the purposes for which the
United States maintains nuclear weapons and explore alternative
scenarios for the development of U.S. nuclear policy; it will then
examine choices for the Japanese nuclear program. After discussing these
scenarios, the paper will propose U.S. policies designed to ensure that
Japan remains both non-nuclear and confident that the U.S. nuclear
umbrella will deter nuclear attacks on Japan, while strengthening
prospects for cooperative security in Asia.

Following the conclusion of World War II, [[Japan]{.mark} has managed to
establish itself as a [pacifist leader]{.mark}]{.underline} after an
extensive history of belligerence.56 As a result of its
internationally-renowned reputation as a pacifist, non-nuclear state,
[Japanese [nuclear prolif]{.mark}eration would [spur]{.mark} a
**worldwide [reevaluation]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the international
[threat environment]{.mark} and Japan's idiosyncratic position within
it.]{.underline} During the process of reevaluating the international
threat environment, [[**global frameworks** of]{.mark} non-proliferation
--- such as the Treaty on the [Non-Prolif]{.mark}eration of Nuclear
Weapons --- would **[likely be overturned]{.mark}** as **membership
deteriorates**.]{.underline} Without a physical framework of
non-proliferation and the associated symbolic loss of Japan as a
non-nuclear power, the probable outcome would be a "domino effect" of
widespread nuclearization that would contribute to an increasingly
volatile global security landscape and ideologically strengthen
unorthodox acts of proliferation. Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of
Nuclear Weapons The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
(NPT) may not be a domestic, legally-binding agreement, but Japan has
been a devoted proponent of and adherent to its core values; therefore,
[as a consequence of Japan's potential proliferation, the NPT would lose
a foundational member, thus reducing the efficacy of the treaty
itself.]{.underline} Despite Japan's contemporary dedication to the NPT,
the Diet's ratification was delayed until 8 July 1976 --- six years
following the signing of the treaty --- after a series of intense
debates over Japan's right to have a 'free-hand on nuclear devices'
(Endicott 1977, 278). The ability of Japan to remove its 'free-hand on
nuclear devices' and democratically decide its fate regarding such a
contentious subject in and of itself demonstrates its true commitment to
both the NPT as an entity and the general concept of non-proliferation
itself. If Japan were to have faltered ideologically, it is logical to
assume that they may have either protracted or prevented the domestic
ratification of the NPT altogether. Additionally, with --- at the time
--- such a diverse diet (both in the Upper and Lower Houses), partisan
compromise indicated the visible importance of nuclear non-proliferation
to Japan (Endicott 1977, 275--76). Although the NPT is adhered to by a
majority of the world's countries, it contains an article, Article X,
which specifies that each party of the NPT maintains its sovereign right
to withdraw from the treaty at any time given irregular circumstances
(United Nations, n.d.). Essentially, this article renders the treaty
non-binding, and its legitimacy is upheld by the membership of its
constituents. Japan, as a visible proponent of non-proliferation and a
non-nuclear state, serves as one of the major anchors for the
non-nuclear constituents of the NPT. If Japan were to sever its
commitment to the NPT as a previous proponent of non-proliferation, it
would concurrently be severing its commitment to non-proliferation as a
whole. Violation of Japanese Pacifism and The Ideological Ramifications
of Proliferation Even when possessing nuclear potential, [Japan has
maintained a steadfast commitment to pacifism]{.underline} --- a
decision that would further exacerbate the global response to Japan's
hypocrisy in the event of its proliferation. In 1963, the US Secretary
of Defense, Robert McNamara, reckoned that 20 nations had the ability to
develop nuclear weapons by the early 1970s --- Japan included (Davenport
2019, 2--3). McNamara's estimate involving Japan, later researched in
1994, was proven correct. As uncovered and subsequently reported by the
Asahi Shimbun, Japanese scholars --- recruited by the Cabinet Research
Office --- had confirmed that Japan was entirely capable of constructing
nuclear weapons during the 1960s; however, it was also uncovered that
the construction was rendered improbable due to "political and other
reasons" (Kurosaki 2017, 47).7 Unlike many countries intent on
developing robust nuclear programs and not possessing the appropriate
resources to do so, Japan holds the opposite set of traits. Its ability
to proliferate --- in and of itself --- should be a cause for concern in
the international community, yet Japan mitigates this concern through
its practice of restraint and its national commitment to serve as a
model for the rest of the world\'s non-proliferation efforts. The
"political reasons" mentioned by the Asahi Shimbun are inherent to the
modern Japanese political structure. Explicitly outlined in the
Constitution of Japan (and discussed in greater detail in Chapter IV),
Article 9 serves as a direct legal barrier to Japanese proliferation.
Additionally, further symbolic statements by influential political
figures, such as former PM Eisaku Sato's Three Non-Nuclear Principles
and reiterations by former PMs Naoto Kan and Yoshihiko Noda have assured
both domestic and foreign entities that proliferation countervails the
very fabric of the modern Japanese society (Ministry of Foreign Affairs
of Japan, n.d. (B)). In the event of Japanese proliferation[, [Japan
would lose]{.mark} any semblance of [legitimacy]{.mark} as a benchmark
for the non-proliferation movement, and the durable restraint of Japan
as a motivator for other countries' non-proliferation regimes would
disappear.]{.underline} When a role model goes against the very idea
that it supported and valued, it will both lose its adherents and
disenfranchise the ideology itself. Japan is an exemplar of advocating
for and upholding non-proliferation, and if it is not possible for Japan
to remain in said position, it is unlikely that another, less qualified
country will thereafter be able to inherit it. The environment that this
would produce is that of ideological anarchy surrounding
non-proliferation. With their benchmark defunct, countries would no
longer feel obligated, even on an informal basis, to practice restraint
with regard to the production of nuclear weapons.8 The East Asian
[Disequilibrium With the NPT rapidly disintegrating and the ideology of
non-proliferation in a state of disrepair, [Japan's]{.mark} immediate
[neighbors would]{.mark} be the first to [suffer]{.mark} from its
proliferation]{.underline}. As it stands[, [Japan, South Korea]{.mark}
(ROK), and [Taiwan]{.mark} (ROC) do not possess nuclear weapons despite
their neighbors, North Korea (DPRK) and China (PRC), possessing
them]{.underline}. Rather, [the [nuclear umbrella]{.mark} under which
Japan and the ROK exist **[provide]{.mark}s [a counterbalance]{.mark}**
[to]{.mark} the **nuclear [capabilities]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} the
**[DPRK]{.mark}** and the **PRC**.9 Japan's acquisition of nuclear
weapons would entirely confound this delicate balance]{.underline}. Onx
the side of Japan's allies[, the ROK and ROC may perceive a nuclearized
Japan as a threat to their own sovereignties both directly and through
the threat of nuclear escalation with their neighbors (the DPRK and
PRC), and they may attempt to match Japan's proliferation with their own
campaigns of nuclear procurement]{.underline}. Presently, the President
of the Republic of Korea, Yoon Suk-yeol has already expressed his
willingness to begin the development of nuclear weapons, and --- due to
this existing willingness to proliferate --- [[Japan's
prolif]{.mark}eration [would]{.mark} likely [serve as the]{.mark}
[**catalyst** for the ROK's]{.mark} proprietary [development of
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline} 50 and Sukin 2023).
Regarding the ROC, the situation would be less dire on account of
President Tsai Ing-wen's staunchly anti-nuclear views; nevertheless, as
non-proliferation loses its legitimacy and the ROC gains exposure to new
regional threats, this attitude would likely change (AP News 2019). [For
Japan's nuclear neighbors, with whom relations exist in a precarious
state, its nuclear proliferation may give reason for the procurement of
increasingly powerful nuclear arsenals in an attempt to preempt a
potential strike from Japan and 'rebalance' the nuclear
ecosystem]{.underline}. With both effects in mind, [[an **arms race**
among a nuclearized East Asia would occur]{.underline}]{.mark} at a
minimum, and --- in the worst case --- [the nuclear arms race
originating in East Asia would **spread sequentially** from country to
country]{.underline} in a centrifugal manner.

### Russia Alignment

#### Current lack of US alignment with Japan [forces]{.underline} cooperation with Russia- energy policy, shipping routes

**Almazova-Ilyana '20** \[July 2020. AB Almazova-Ilyana. IOP conference
series: Earth and environmental science. Vol. 539. No. 1. IOP
Publishing. "National interests of Japan and its emerging Arctic
policy".
https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1755-1315/539/1/012048\]/

Now let us analyze aforementioned findings to highlight Japan's national
interests that are confronted by existing challenges and pursued in its
policies in respect to its involvement in the Arctic. Firstly, among
Japan's interests in the region are those that fall under the term
'security' in its broader sense. There are not many concerns about
traditional military security since all major stakeholders agree that
the Arctic should stay a region of cooperation and retain its peaceful
character \[13\]. Tonami Aki notes that Japanese research conducted
under auspices of the Ministry of Defense 'concluded that the changes in
the Arctic do not pose direct security threats to Japan' \[14\].
However, there are concerns about physical security in regards to
natural disasters facilitated by rapid climate change in the Arctic. To
address these worries Japan will need to continue extensive research on
possible threats as well as develop reliable response mechanisms.
[Another [Japanese interest]{.mark} in question is [linked to energy
security.]{.mark} A country that [imports 90% of its energy]{.mark}
resources crucially [needs]{.mark} a [diversification]{.mark} of those
both in terms of type and supplier.]{.underline} Currently Japan is
reliant on Middle Eastern hydrocarbons. [Investment in Arctic oil and
gas extraction projects is but one way to overcome that. This might
partly [explain Tokyo's]{.mark} quite [**independent approach** towards
**relations with Russia**]{.mark} since it **[does not follow US and EU
sanction policies]{.mark}** towards Russia after Ukraine
crisis.]{.underline} [[Cooperation with Russia on Arctic mineral
resources development seems to be an **important step** towards Japan's
energy security]{.underline}]{.mark}. Final notion in the "security"
section is the commonly overlooked food security. Certain marine
species' northward migration and threats associated with it that we
mentioned above must be addressed to provide the nation with a healthy
and rich diet. For an island state with limited land space it is a vital
issue. Again this area heavily relies on research and risks assessment.
Secondly, [there are [obvious **economic interests**]{.mark} to be met
by Arctic exploration]{.underline}. One aspect of it is energy resources
development discussed above. From the economic point of view there are
still debates over its cost-effectiveness, so Japan is quite prudent.
The Arctic Routes started playing a significant role in Japan\'s
shipping. The most significant one was the Northern Sea Route, which was
connecting Japan and Europe. It was used for more frequent trade flows,
as the Route was 40% shorter than the previously used one through the
Suez Canal. In the light of the Economic Partnership Agreement between
Japan and the EU that entered into force last year Japan is now
particularly interested in the NSR shipping as it would benefit Japan-EU
trade and help significantly increase trade volumes. [Japan is also
contemplating the possibility of becoming an Asian maritime hub in the
beginning of the Arctic Sea Route]{.underline}. Authorities of Hokkaido
consider the sea port of Tomakomai as the potential center for Arctic
shipping and trade. [[Realization of Japanese economic interests
**relies heavily** on Russian authorities and their commitment to make
the NSR safe and viable route for Arctic shipping]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[Russian government's initiatives like 'Arctic 2035' strategy are
promising to bring drastic infrastructure development and quality of
life changes in the Russian Arctic.]{.underline} There are other areas
of Japanese economy that attract Arctic states businesses, like
shipbuilding, engineering and facility construction, but here Japan
meets fierce competition from Korean and especially Chinese companies.
Thirdly, [[Japan]{.mark} [seeks stronger position and influence in
international politics]{.mark}]{.underline}. [It wants to [**actively
participate in making the rules for Arctic affairs**, not just following
them]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [a right that is currently almost
exclusively enjoyed by the Arctic states.]{.underline} Considering
impact that developments in the region have on the rest of the world
this wish seems legitimate. Other dimension of this interest is
competition between CJK countries. At the current point in time when the
whole world is watching China continue its rise, Japan will certainly
not put up with being just "China's neighbor". High- aiming ambitions of
South Korea also do not leave Japan a chance to just "go with the flow".
CJK countries keep constantly pushing each other forward, and despite
all the rivalry it is more of an advantage for them. In regards to other
East Asian states Japan has to promote positive global change, including
dealing with Arctic challenges facilitated by climate change, to improve
its image within the region. Overcoming militaristic perceptions of the
past by doing good perfectly fits into the framework of Japanese public
diplomacy to Southeast Asia. Last, but not least, [Japan is deeply
invested in tackling environmental problems in the Arctic. These issues
are not only contextualized as security threats, but also comply with
greater consensus on the need for urgent environmental action to protect
the planet.]{.underline} Japan shows great commitment to the United
Nations Sustainable Development Goals and principles of the Paris
Agreement. Japan utilizes its advanced research and observation carried
out in the Arctic for over six decades now to positively contribute to
the world developing sustainably and to uplift communities seriously
affected by the climate change, first and foremost indigenous peoples of
the Arctic.

### US Alliance Scenario

#### Japanese consultation over the [plan]{.underline} is key to [broader]{.underline} reinvigoration of the alliance

**Tatsumi '25** (4/4/2025, Yuki, "Back to the Future? The Implications
of Growing Strategic Competition in the Arctic for the US-Japan
Alliance,"
https://www.stimson.org/2025/implications-strategic-competition-arctic-us-japan-alliance/)

Fast forward to the 21st century, and [[Japan]{.mark} has [not]{.mark}
been [oblivious to]{.mark} the rising [importance of]{.mark} the
[Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}, either. The Japanese government, following
Japan's ascendance to the Arctic Council as a permanent observer in
2013, issued its Arctic Policy in 2015 which focuses on (1) environment,
(2) indigenous population, (3) science and technology, (4) promoting the
rule of law, (5) utilization of the Arctic passage route, (6) natural
resource development, and (7) regional security. This policy was
incorporated into Japan's Third Basic Plan for Ocean Policy, most
recently updated in 2018. Despite the regional security consideration,
Japan's approach to the Arctic has been firmly rooted in three areas --
scientific research, promotion of international cooperation, and
sustainable development of the Arctic. However, [as the [geostrategic
competition]{.mark} in the Arctic seems to [intensify]{.mark}, the
[North Pacific]{.mark} may [re-enter]{.mark} [Japan's strategic
landscape]{.mark}. Namely]{.underline}, the greater interest by
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} on engaging the Arctic countries through
investments in infrastructure and energy developments in the region [has
[compelled Japan to work with U.S.]{.mark} and European partners to
ensure that the Arctic remains "free and open and is governed by the
rule of law".]{.underline} Indeed, Japan has been reenergizing its
outreach to Northern Europe -- When then-foreign minister Yoko Kamikawa
visited Sweden in January 2024, she unveiled Japan's Northern European
Diplomacy Initiative with four focus areas: the Arctic, gender issues,
broader economic cooperation (including cooperation in science and
technology), and defense. While cooperation in the Arctic under this
initiative is centered in cooperation in scientific research,
environmental preservation, and human resources development, the
countries that have high stakes in the Arcti,c such as Sweden, Norway,
Denmark, and Finland have been identified as the countries with which
Japan seeks to strengthen its defense relations. What's more, China's
growing cooperation with Russia only aggravates Japan's concern of
China's behavior in the Arctic. North Pacific in the U.S.-Japan Alliance
Given the emergence of the Arctic as the next ground for geostrategic
competition, security [[cooperation]{.mark} [in]{.mark} the
[Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} and the broader North Pacific [[may
re-emerge]{.mark} as places for [deeper U.S.-Japan
alliance]{.mark}]{.underline} cooperation as Japan looks to push for
greater cooperation with Northern European countries. [In fact, despite
rising tensions in the trans-Atlantic alliance over the handling of the
Russia-Ukraine war and trade, the [Arctic provides a unique opportunity
for greater cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, [[Japan's
approach]{.mark} to the Arctic---primarily [focused on scientific
research]{.mark} and environmental conservation---makes Tokyo
well-positioned to facilitate]{.underline} the cooperation between the
U.S., Japan, and North Europe at a critical juncture for the future of
the trans-Atlantic alliance. In the context of the U.S.-Japan alliance,
Japan can leverage the assets and capabilities that the Japan Maritime
Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) has already developed to enhance its role in
surveillance and intelligence-gathering in the North Pacific. Even after
the Cold War, the JMSDF maintained its surveillance and
intelligence-gathering operations in the North to keep not only North
Korea's but also China's and Russia's military behavior in check. These
efforts may need to be enhanced once again, especially given the
elevated level of military activities by China and Russia.

#### The CP is [key]{.underline} to reinvigorate the US-Japan Alliance

**Chanlett-Avery '25** \[4/12/2025. Emma Chanlett-Avery is the Director
of Political-Security Affairs and Deputy Director of ASPI, Washington,
D.C. Office. Asian Society Policy Institute. "The Japan-U.S. Alliance at
a Pivotal Moment and the Path Ahead".
https://asiasociety.org/policy-institute/japan-us-alliance-pivotal-moment-and-path-ahead\]

Overview On January 15, the Asia Society Policy Institute (ASPI) hosted
a conference on the U.S.-Japan relationship, less than a week before
Donald Trump was inaugurated for his second term as president. The
conference, consisting of two public panels and three private sessions
under Chatham House Rule, explored **[the [U.S.-Japan alliance
at]{.mark} a [pivotal moment]{.mark}]{.underline}** and delved into the
security-related and economic implications for the two allies. Three
weeks later, Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba visited the White House,
setting the tone for relations under a second Trump administration. What
did the summit reveal about prospects for the partnership? How did this
meeting measure up to the conclusions and observations that the
conference reached? And how do the two countries forge the difficult
path ahead? Ishiba and Trump: The Initial Encounter Early reviews of the
summit are largely characterized by relief. Ishiba emerged unscathed
from the meeting, able to list Japan's priorities from the podium and
asserting that Japan made the decision to double its defense spending on
its own, not based on a U.S. demand. He complied with the expectation
that he would praise Trump, calling him "powerful and sincere," and
claimed that Japanese investment in the United States gained momentum
after the U.S. election. During the press conference, Ishiba ticked off
a series of commitments that echoed those established in previous
administrations: affirmation that Article 5 of the U.S.-Japan security
treaty covers the Senkaku Islands, the continuation of the Quad
(Australia, India, Japan, and the United States) and trilateral
partnerships with South Korea and the Philippines, and an agreement of
no change to the status quo through the use of force or coercion in the
South China Sea or East China Sea. (The addition of the term
\"coercion\" was new and could include economic measures not only
military moves.) Trump made no mention of these Japanese priorities but
focused his remarks on Japan's investment in the United States. By
emphasizing increased investment in the United States and lavishing
praise on Trump, Ishiba avoided an anticipated demand by President Trump
for Japan to raise its defense spending beyond the 2% of GDP goal that
Japan has set. Trump made clear that energy exports would be a major
priority and a possible remedy for the large trade deficit that exists
with Japan. Tokyo could face pressure to invest heavily in an Alaskan
pipeline that Trump has prioritized, even issuing an Executive Order
outlining its benefits. Trump's Early Moves and the Alliance While the
outcome may have allayed fears of a disastrous launch and provided a
reprieve for Ishiba from his domestic skeptics, the alliance has not yet
executed the pivot to its role in the America First foreign policy. [One
successful summit]{.underline}---including a Joint Statement that
reiterated mostly previous language about the alliance---[may not soothe
the anxiety that was a central theme among conference participants. In
[Trump]{.mark}'s first month in office, his [admin]{.mark}istration
[made]{.mark} several [moves that could prove detrimental to the]{.mark}
[relationship]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Chief among them was]{.underline}
the imposition of steel and aluminum [[tariffs]{.underline}]{.mark}
without an exception for Japan, a policy direction predicted by ASPI's
economic roundtable. Trump's threatened 25% tariffs on Mexico would
damage Japan's auto industry, which has shifted much of its production
to Mexico. The thorny campaign-trail issue of Nippon Steel's bid to buy
U.S. Steel persisted, with Trump resisting the deal and striking a blow
to the "friendshoring" framework to secure supply chains. The first
weeks of Trump's term brought other changes that will impact the
U.S.-Japan relationship. [The]{.underline} rapid [[dismantlement of
USAID]{.underline}]{.mark} is likely to diminish U.S. soft power abroad,
particularly in the Global South where Japan has focused diplomatic
overtures and overseas development assistance. Elon Musk's campaign to
lay off large swathes of federal workers could hollow out the
working-level employees who maintain the partnership across several
agencies. As cautioned during the first conference panel, developing and
sustaining efforts such as the nascent mini-laterals demand great
amounts of staff time, energy, and patience; a reduction in workforce
could stunt those initiatives. In the course of Cabinet confirmation
hearings, Senate Republicans acquiesced to all of Trump's
nominees---[while Japan may have been heartened by the swift and
unanimous confirmation of]{.underline} Marco [Rubio as secretary of
state, other national security figures such as]{.underline} Defense
Secretary Pete [[Hegseth]{.underline} [and]{.underline}]{.mark} Director
of National Intelligence Tulsi [[Gabbard provide less reassurance about
the importance of alliances in U.S. foreign policy]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Perhaps most ominously, Trump reiterated his long-standing questioning
of the value of the U.S.-Japan alliance specifically, calling it an
"interesting" deal that is non-reciprocal in security commitments,
followed by complaining that "\[The Japanese\] make a fortune with us
economically. I actually ask who makes these deals?" This aside comment
in the Oval Office could suggest that Trump views the Japan alliance
through the same lens as NATO, and not as an exceptional case. In
addition, during his confirmation hearing for Undersecretary of Defense
for Policy, Elbridge Colby---widely expected to be an influential figure
in the Administration---stated that Japan should be spending at least 3%
of its GDP on defense. The Inheritance The consensus of conference
participants was firm: the U.S.-Japan alliance has thrived both
bilaterally and multilaterally, becoming a truly global partnership.
Japan has stepped up its leadership, providing munitions in support of
Ukraine, strategically deploying overseas security assistance
(particularly with Indonesia and the Philippines), and conducting joint
exercises with countries including Australia, to name just a few
examples. Tokyo's decision to significantly increase its defense
spending has driven alliance modernization, enhancing interoperability
and working toward a true bilateral command and control relationship.
Japan will purchase hundreds of Tomahawk missiles from the United
States, acquiring an offensive strike capability for the first time
since World War II. The flourishing of new mini-laterals positioned the
U.S.-Japan alliance firmly at the center of regional coordination, and
Tokyo delivered on its designation as the "cornerstone" of peace and
security in the Indo-Pacific. Beyond the region, Japan stepped up its
cooperation with NATO, investing in the trans-Atlantic relationship and
providing support for war-torn Ukraine. Despite Japan's disappointment
at the U.S. withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the two
countries have developed meaningful economic security cooperation, with
a focus on supply chain resilience for critical products such as
semi-conductors and batteries. The two countries adopted a friendshoring
practice, exemplified by Japanese investments in reshoring production
and diversifying suppliers, though as participants noted, the Biden
administration's rejection of the Nippon Steel bid revealed the limits
of this approach. Japan's assiduous pursuit of Southeast Asian countries
to sign on to the Biden administration's Indo-Pacific Economic
Partnership (IPEF) strengthened the only major U.S.-led trade initiative
in the region. Agreements on Japanese investment in rare earth
processing to reduce dependence on Chinese suppliers and agreements on
digital trade filled out the bilateral economic relationship. Challenges
on the Horizon At the White House, Trump made clear he will focus on the
trade deficit with Japan, in a familiar transactional approach. In
response, Japan has accelerated its investments in the United States,
pledging to raise its total from \$800 billion to \$1 trillion---but
faces a steep climb to overcome its current surplus of nearly \$55
billion. Trump's emphasis on Japanese investment in an Alaskan liquified
natural gas (LNG) pipeline comes with an outsized price tag that may
concern relevant Japanese companies if no assurances are provided that a
future Democratic administration would allow for its completion on the
previously protected Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Conference
speakers identified the particular concern of the upcoming expiration of
a burden-sharing agreement that determines how much Japan pays to cover
the cost of hosting U.S. troops on its territory. Host nation support
negotiations---always contentious---were a target for the first Trump
administration; the arrangement with South Korea collapsed when U.S.
officials demanded that South Korea increase its contribution many-fold.
For decades, Trump has complained that international alliances are a
boon for the hosting countries, with the United States providing for the
partner's security without adequate reciprocal compensation. Japan's
commitment to double its defense spending may not sway Trump
administration demands that Tokyo up its payments to the United States
to defray the cost of the 50,000 military personnel stationed on the
archipelago. **[At the [heart of]{.mark} the
[difference]{.mark},]{.underline}** according to discussions at the
conference, **[[is]{.mark} a [transactional versus cooperative]{.mark},
collective [approach]{.mark}]{.underline}** to providing for a U.S.
forward-operating military presence in the Asia-Pacific theater.

#### Now is a key moment to revitalize the alliance

**Dutcher, '25** (4/2/2025, Mizumi, "The Advocate and the Anchor:
Congress and the Future of the U.S.-Japan in the Indo-Pacific,"
https://www.stimson.org/2025/the-advocate-and-the-anchor-congress-and-the-future-of-the-u-s-japan-in-the-indo-pacific/)

[The [U.S.-Japan security alliance]{.mark} has long been a [cornerstone
of]{.mark} both nations' [foreign policies,]{.mark} serving as a key
mechanism for]{.underline} ensuring regional [stability]{.underline}.
[However]{.underline}, recent [public]{.underline} opinion
[[polls]{.underline}]{.mark} in both countries [[suggest]{.mark} a
[growing divergence]{.mark}]{.underline} in perceptions [regarding the
alliance]{.underline}'s role in the region. A recent poll conducted by
the Japanese Cabinet Office found that 95% of Japanese respondents
believe that strengthening the U.S.-Japan alliance is crucial for peace
and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. In contrast, a survey by the
Chicago Council on Global Affairs revealed that 43% of Americans believe
the United States should "stay out" of world affairs---one of the
highest levels recorded in the past 30 years. This perception gap
between the two nations has widened over time. While Japanese public
support for the alliance has remained consistently above 90% for over a
decade, the percentage of Americans favoring global disengagement has
surged from 29% in 2018 to 43% today. This inward-looking trend among
Americans is increasingly reflected in government policy decisions. In
his recent address to Congress, President Donald Trump devoted little
time to foreign policy, with no mention of Asian diplomacy. Although he
has repeatedly expressed his intent to confront China through tariffs,
he has yet to provide a comprehensive strategy for addressing structural
security concerns. Meanwhile, there are signs of a shift in the U.S.
Congress's stance on China. In the past, China policy was one of the
rare areas where there was bipartisan agreement, but differences of
opinion have surfaced and are becoming more pronounced, particularly
within the Republican Party, which currently controls both the Senate
and the House of Representatives. Some argue that the U.S.-Japan
alliance should be strengthened in order to deter China, while others
are more pragmatic and skeptical of the United States' current
capabilities to deter China, arguing that the U.S. alliance in Europe
should be reviewed or even cut and that vast resources should be
concentrated in the Indo-Pacific region. The latter group aligns with
broader arguments for limiting U.S. diplomatic involvement and "America
First" rhetoric. With U.S. policy toward China still lacking a clear
direction, President [[Trump fueled]{.mark} further
[uncertainty]{.mark}]{.underline} to regional stability [by signing an
executive order to freeze all the U.S. foreign aid administered by U.S.
Agency for International Development (USAID)]{.underline} as well as a
full review of all foreign aid programs. On March 10, Secretary of State
Marco Rubio announced that 83% of the foreign aid programs have been
terminated and that the remaining programs would be transferred under
the State Department---thereby eliminating USAID---although this
decision has been challenged by a U.S. District Court judge. This marks
a significant reduction in U.S. global engagement. [[Japan is
concerned]{.mark} that the [reduction of American involvement]{.mark} in
the region [risks creating a vacuum]{.mark}, which China may quickly
exploit]{.underline} to expand its strategic influence in the
Indo-Pacific. Essential Context [At a time when U.S. foreign policy
seems more unpredictable than ever,]{.underline} congressional
[**[diplomacy]{.underline}** [has taken on a new level of importance in
reassuring]{.underline}]{.mark} America's allies, including
[[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark}. Unlike the executive branch, where foreign
policy can change drastically from one administration to the next,
Congress offers a degree of stability. The senior members of the
Congressional Foreign Policy Committees and Congressional Armed Services
Committees often have over a decade of experience in shaping global
policy, giving them the institutional knowledge to provide consistency
in U.S. international engagement. [By
[strengthening]{.mark}]{.underline} legislative
[[relationships]{.underline}]{.mark} with key allies, [[Congress
can]{.underline}]{.mark} act as a [[stabiliz]{.mark}i]{.underline}ng
force in [[uncertain times]{.mark}, ensuring that America's commitments
remain strong]{.underline}. [Fortunately, the [U.S.-Japan]{.mark}
[legislative relationship has a strong foundation]{.mark}. [Bilateral
exchanges]{.mark} [between]{.mark} Japanese and American
[lawmakers]{.mark} began in 1968 and have continued for over five
decades, making these exchanges some of the longest-standing diplomatic
engagements between the two countries.]{.underline} Aside from a brief
pause during the COVID-19 pandemic, these exchanges have remained
active, with more than 350 bipartisan delegations visiting Japan to
date. Key participants in this longstanding initiative include Senator
Bill Hagerty (R-TN), former U.S. Ambassador to Japan during the first
Trump administration; Senator Dan Sullivan (R-AK), Chairman of the
Subcommittee on Readiness in the Armed Services Committee;
Representative Diana DeGette (D-CO), a member of the Congressional Study
Group on Japan (CSGJ); and Representative Ami Bera (D-CA), ranking
member of the East Asia and Pacific Subcommittee of the House Committee
on Foreign Relations. [These]{.underline} visits [are [essential for
advancing]{.mark}]{.underline} dialogue on issues such as
[[security]{.underline}]{.mark}, supply chain [[stability, and
intel]{.mark}l]{.underline}igence-[sharing]{.underline}, and serve to
reinforce diplomatic continuity across changing administrations. By
engaging with Japanese lawmakers and bureaucrats who directly navigate
regional challenges, bipartisan congressional delegations gain valuable
firsthand insights that help shape U.S. policymaking. The extended
nature of these trips fosters closer engagement among lawmakers,
strengthening bipartisan cooperation in ways that Washington's political
climate often does not allow. The scope of cross-cultural interaction is
expanding through exchange programs for members of Congress and
congressional senior staff carried out by organizations such as the
Association of Former Members of Congress (FMC), the Sasakawa Peace
Foundation USA, the Japan Center for International Exchange (JCIE), and
the Maureen and Mike Mansfield Foundation. In recent years,
inter-parliamentary engagement has become increasingly active, extending
beyond the Japan-U.S. relationship to include broader regional
cooperation. [Congressional engagement is particularly
well-positioned,]{.underline} for instance, to strengthen the crucial
United States-Japan- South Korea trilateral summit, launched in 2023,
especially as it faces uncertainty with the departure of all three
participating state leaders. Bipartisan delegations of U.S. legislators
to the region can help the trilateral dialogue continue. One of the
flagship programs run by the Japan-United States Friendship Commission
provides a prime example of effective legislative diplomacy. It brings
legislators from Japan, the United States, and South Korea together
twice a year, and serves as an important forum for trilateral dialogue.
Increasing the number of such forums will help the United States
strengthen its latticelike network of Indo-Pacific alliances, which is
key to closing the soft power gap exacerbated by the closure of USAID.
There are many other recent examples of Congressional engagement in
U.S.-led multilateral diplomacy. Last year, for example, a Congressional
caucus on the Quad was established with bipartisan participation from
both the Senate and House of Representatives. Additionally, the House of
Representatives passed the Strengthening the Quad Act, a bill aimed at
promoting greater human exchange among the Quad nations---the United
States, India, Australia, and Japan---by facilitating congressional
visits and discussions on critical issues such as economic cooperation
and geopolitical risks. To ensure continuity in regional diplomacy,
legislative engagement has become increasingly significant.
Congressional backing for such mini-lateral frameworks reinforces the
United States' commitment to regional stability. Challenges The new U.S.
administration is undertaking a fundamental reassessment of its
international engagement. During a congressional hearing in January,
Secretary of State Marco Rubio articulated this shift, reaffirming the
administration's commitment to an "America First" policy.
"\[U\]ltimately, under President Trump, the top priority of the United
States Department of State will be the United States," he stated.
"American taxpayer dollars should only be spent to advance U.S.
interests, and every penny should be scrutinized to ensure its sincerity
and effectiveness." This perspective signals a departure from the
post-war consensus that alliances serve as strategic assets for the
United States. Instead, there is an increasing perception that such
partnerships place undue financial and security burdens on the United
States---a viewpoint frequently expressed by President Trump. Furthering
this retrenchment, the State Department placed a temporary freeze on the
funding for key international exchange programs, including the Fulbright
Program, which was established by Senator James William Fulbright in
1946 to foster global academic collaboration and diplomacy. It has
facilitated the academic exchange of 6,700 Japanese students to the
United States, including four Nobel laureates and four former Japanese
prime ministers. This decision directly affects over 12,500 American
students, cutting off a historically valuable investment in national
security, economic prosperity, and future U.S. leadership. [[Congress
holds immense power]{.underline}]{.mark}---the power of the purse, the
power to conduct oversight, and the power [to [influence fo]{.mark}reign
[po]{.mark}licy]{.underline}. When used [effectively, these tools ensure
that U.S. commitments remain steady and strategic and allow Congress to
check hasty executive actions.]{.underline} But [there is a
challenge]{.underline}: Congress can only act when bipartisan consensus
exists on key priorities, including the Indo-Pacific region. That
[consensus does not just appear; it must be cultivate]{.underline}d.
This is why **[[Japan's engagement]{.underline}]{.mark}** with
legislators from both parties **[is [more important than
ever]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} **[[Strengthening
ties]{.underline}]{.mark}** with Congress **[is [critical to ensuring
that the United States and Japan have strategic

The 2015 Arctic Policy states that Japan will put its scientific
knowledge and advanced technology to use for contributing to Arctic
environmental cooperation. The 2018 Basic Plan states that Japan will
utilise the experience of the government, academia, and corporations in
its efforts to conserve and protect the Arctic marine environment. So
far, [the main approach of [Japan's involvement]{.mark} in and
contribution to Arctic environmental cooperation has been to provide the
[research results and technological developments]{.mark} produced by
ArCS, ArCS II, and other government-funded projects.]{.underline} For
example, at the Third Arctic Science Ministerial in 2021, Japan
introduced its contribution to the advancement of Arctic observation
technology, including observations by its climate change observation
satellite 'Shikisai' (GCOM-C) and the greenhouse gas observation
satellite 'Ibuki' (GOAST) (2021 Arctic Science Ministerial Report,
76--77). Beyond simply providing information was the development of the
black carbon (BC) observation and measurement device COSMOS under ArCS
II and making its use as the standardisation of BC observation scheme
being recognised in the AMAP's work. **[This is one of the best examples
of Japan's substantive contribution in Arctic environmental cooperation
(2023 ArCS II Report, 16). Other [contributions by Japan in addressing
BC]{.mark} in the Arctic are noteworthy.]{.underline}** There is not yet
a universal treaty generally regulating the emission of BC. [The
[Arctic]{.mark} [Council adopted]{.mark} in 2015 the [Framework]{.mark}
for Action on Enhanced BC and Methane Emission Reductions and
established the EGBCM to advise on its implementation. In accordance
with this framework, [Japan submitted national reports]{.mark} in 2015,
2017, 2020, and 2024, stating its support for the Arctic Council's
efforts to reduce BC in the Arctic.]{.underline} Japan also dispatched
experts to the EGBCM (Observer Reports, 2016, 3; 2018, 5; 2020, 3).
Japan's scientific investigation into the indispensability of
considering the size and chemical composition of soot particles when
estimating their global warming effect was important (Ocean Report,
2019, 79). Japan's research on the BC and other substances. originating
from Asia and their potential impacts on the Arctic environment and
climate was conducted using the Environment Research and Technology
Development Fund (Observer Report, 2020, 4). These efforts can be said
to constitute Japan's scientific and technological contributions to the
implementation and development of the Arctic Council's BC and Methane
Framework for Action.

#### Black carbon in the Arctic is uniquely damaging and creates positive feedback loops

**Gerretsen 23** Isabelle Gerretsen is a journalist who covers climate
and environmental issues. "Black carbon: The 'low-hanging fruit' for
cleaner shipping" *Dialogue Earth*.
https://dialogue.earth/en/climate/black-carbon-the-low-hanging-fruit-for-cleaner-shipping/
Published April 4^th^, 2023, accessed June 29^th^, 2025 by NT-BH

Shipping is a highly polluting industry. Between 2007 and 2012, it was
responsible for roughly 3% of global greenhouse gas emissions from
fossil fuel use and industrial processes, or around one billion tonnes
of CO2 equivalent per year. [[Ship exhaust]{.mark} may also [contain
"black carbon]{.mark}" -- sooty [particles that absorb sunlight]{.mark}
and trap [heat in the atmosphere]{.mark}, [contributing to]{.mark}
global [warming.]{.mark} Black carbon rapidly [accelerates ice
melt]{.mark} when it lands, by darkening surfaces and thus reducing how
much sunlight they reflect. At the same time it poses a serious health
risk to coastal communities.]{.underline} Environmental groups say this
climate and health threat could easily be eradicated if ships were
forced to use cleaner fuels. The impact on warming Black carbon is
produced when ships burn heavy fuel oil, which is "a hazardous, toxic
tar-like fuel", says Andrew Dumbrille, an advisor to both the Clean
Arctic Alliance, a group of 20 nonprofits, and to the Inuit Circumpolar
Council, which represents all Inuit from Alaska, Canada, Greenland and
Chukotka on internationally important matters. "It is literally the
stuff at the bottom of the barrel," he says. "You have to heat it up to
use it... it's like burning tar, one could walk on it," he says. "Our
global trade system is enabled by this highly polluting by-product
fuel." Black carbon emissions are responsible for around 20% of the
shipping industry's climate impact over a 20-year period, according to
the Clean Arctic Alliance. **[It is "especially damaging, and has a
[disproportionate impact]{.mark}, [when]{.mark} it is [released
in]{.mark} or near the [Arctic,]{.mark}" says Sian Prior, lead adviser
to the alliance.]{.underline}** The Arctic is already warming almost
four times faster than the global average, at 0.73C per decade compared
to the global average of 0.19C per decade between 1979--2021, according
to a 2022 study by Finnish researchers. "When black carbon settles in
the polar environment... the surface starts absorbing more and more heat
because it's dark," says Prior. "So you lose the albedo effect, which is
the reflectivity of the snow and the ice." This leads to a vicious cycle
of warming. Less sea ice means more open, dark ocean which absorbs more
heat and accelerates temperature rise, not just in the Arctic but
worldwide. "Some of that warming is going to be transported further
south," says Pam Pearson, director of the International Cryosphere
Climate Initiative. "So a warmer Arctic also translates into warmer
mid-latitudes because of black carbon." If the Arctic sea ice melts
completely during the summer, there is going to be "so much more sea
level rise and extreme weather globally," says Pearson. A 2021 report by
the Climate Crisis Advisory Group warned that the Arctic is "ground
zero" for cascading climate impacts across the planet. Rising
temperatures there are leading to warmer ocean temperatures and shifts
in atmospheric circulation, and are expected to weaken the jet stream,
leading to more extreme weather. The impact on Arctic communities "The
melting of sea ice is \[causing\] global climate disruption, but also
local, cultural disruption," says Dumbrille. Black carbon's impact is
already being felt by indigenous communities living in the Arctic. There
are serious health risks associated with exposure to black carbon. A
component of fine particulate matter, black carbon has been linked to
lung and heart disease and can impair cognitive and immune functions.
"Black carbon is changing our culture," says Lisa Koperqualuk, vice
president international of the Inuit Circumpolar Council. She explains
that the rapid melting of ice is drastically changing the Inuit way of
life by delaying harvesting seasons and making it more difficult for
communities to travel. "We call the ice our highway," she says. "We use
it to travel and to go hunting on the edge of the sea ice." There are
concerns that black carbon could contaminate the main food source for
Inuit communities, seafood, according to Koperqualuk. "The migration
patterns of animals could also change \[as the ocean warms\] because
there are some marine mammals that follow colder waters," she says. "The
Arctic is a very important area to protect and to keep as pristine as
possible, not only for our culture, but for the \[entire\] world," says
Koperqualuk. "The Arctic is linked to the rest of the globe. So
protecting it is protecting the world as well." The rise (and fall?) of
black carbon Between 2015 and 2019, the Arctic saw an 85% rise in black
carbon due to increased shipping traffic. "Black carbon emissions are
increasing because there are more and more ships going to the Arctic. In
recent years, there have been more oil tankers and bunker carriers going
to the Arctic," says Prior. Maritime traffic grew by 25% between 2013
and 2019, while the distance covered by ships in the region increased by
75%. The increase in shipping traffic in the Arctic is "very much
related to the loss of sea ice," says Prior. The ice is also "forming
later in the year and melting earlier," she says. This means that more
ships are able to sail for longer periods in the Arctic region. It's
leading to a "**[really [nasty feedback loop,"]{.mark}]{.underline}**
says Pearson. "As you lose more sea ice, you get more ships, more
emissions, \[and\] less sea ice." There is an easy way to rapidly cut
black carbon emissions, according to environmental groups. If all ships
using heavy fuel oil were to switch to a cleaner distillate fuel
(similar to diesel) there would be an immediate reduction of around 44%
in black carbon emissions from these ships, according to the Clean
Arctic Alliance. If all ships also installed diesel particulate filters,
which capture soot, black carbon could be reduced by over 90%. Black
carbon could rapidly disappear from the atmosphere if regulations were
introduced Black carbon is a short-lived climate pollutant with a
lifespan of just a few days or weeks, whereas CO2 can remain in the
atmosphere for 300 **[to]{.underline}** 1,000 years. This means that
black carbon could rapidly disappear from the atmosphere if regulations
were introduced. "Black carbon could be resolved very quickly, which is
why we call it the 'low hanging fruit'," says Prior. "Whereas with
carbon dioxide you've got a very potent warming gas that is staying in
the atmosphere for hundreds of years." If the European Union required
ships sailing in the Arctic to switch from bunker fuels to cleaner
distillate fuels, it would reduce their black carbon emissions in Arctic
waters by 50--80%, according to analysis by the International Council on
Clean Transportation (ICCT). Technically, it is easy for ships to make
the switch. "It's seen as an overnight solution, because ship engines
can run, and already do run, on both heavy bunker fuel and lighter
distillate fuel," says Dumbrille. "Most engines can just switch between
the fuels. In fact, they often do already," says Prior. "Ships often use
the lighter diesel fuels in the coastal waters, and then switch over to
the heavy fuels when they're offshore." But uptake of distillate fuels
is lagging due to cost. They are more expensive due to higher demand
(especially from road vehicles) and because they require more refining,
says Dumbrille. "It's about twice as expensive to use the cleaner fuel,"
says Bryan Comer, who leads the marine programme at the ICCT. The need
for stronger regulations Regulations are needed to force ship operators
to switch to distillate fuel. In November 2021, the International
Maritime Organization (IMO), the UN body overseeing shipping, adopted a
resolution urging ship operators to switch to cleaner fuels in the
Arctic in a bid to reduce black carbon emissions. But it was a voluntary
measure, which relied on governments to introduce supportive policies.
Environmental groups are calling for mandatory regulations to
drastically slash black carbon emissions in the Arctic. Regulations are
already in place around the North American coastline, where the IMO
introduced an emission control area (ECA) in 2012, requiring ships to
limit their nitrogen oxide (NOx), sulphur oxide (SOx) and particulate
matter pollution. This regulation has incentivised many ship operators
to switch to distillate fuel. ECAs have also been established in the
Mediterranean, the North Sea and Baltic Sea. Environmental groups would
like the North America ECA to be extended to the Arctic. "Arctic
communities were overlooked when the North America ECA was established,"
says Comer. "Some would argue that's environmental injustice and
environmental racism." It is important that existing loopholes, which
enable ship operators to continue using heavy fuel oil, are removed from
new IMO regulations, experts argue. Currently, many ships in the ECA use
scrubbers to remove their exhaust fumes from the atmosphere and comply
with regulations, without having to switch to a more expensive
distillate fuel. "There are loopholes within the ECA... so you can still
carry on using heavy fuel oil but install a scrubber to reduce your
sulphur emissions," says Prior. Although scrubbers reduce air pollution,
they are still incredibly polluting as they dump the chemicals removed
from the exhaust directly into the ocean. By using scrubbers, "you are
taking an atmospheric pollution problem and turning it into an ocean
pollution problem," says Prior. If the North American emissions control
area is extended to the Arctic "you'd want to see that high sulphur
fuels would not be allowed, even if ships have a scrubber," says Comer.
"Instead, they should be required to use distillate fuels." A proposal
to extend the ECA is likely to be brought to the IMO this year, but it
won't get much air time until 2024, says Comer. This year the IMO is set
to review its long-term emissions reduction strategy and decide whether
to adopt a net zero by 2050 target. The current IMO target, which
campaigners say is woefully inadequate, is to halve shipping emissions
by 2050. Without further action, shipping emissions are projected to
reach 90-130% of their 2008 levels by 2050. "It is very inadequate,"
says Dumbrille. "To be aligned with the Paris Agreement, \[the target\]
needs to be at least 100% by 2050, ideally 100% by 2040, and 50% by
2030." "If you're thinking about a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas
emissions by 2030, dealing with black carbon should be at the top of
your list," he says. "I'm not holding my breath at the moment... it's
going to take a couple more years," says Prior, noting that there is
still quite a lot of opposition within the industry. "It's frustrating
when \[tackling black carbon\] should be low-hanging fruit, especially
compared to what needs to happen to decarbonise the whole sector."

### Japan Nuclearization\-\--Impact\-\--2NC

#### Japan will see nukes as its [only option]{.underline} absent strong US support

[For 80 years, the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has [invested]{.mark}
enormous effort in [prevent]{.mark}ing [countries from building]{.mark}
[nuc]{.mark}lear arsenal[s]{.mark}.]{.underline} It has [done so through
lengthy [negotiations, trade incentives]{.mark}, diplomatic engagement,
[treaties]{.mark} and, on rare occasions, military force.]{.underline}
The recent U.S. attack on Iran\'s nuclear facilities was aimed at the
same goal: stopping Iran from becoming the world\'s 10th nuclear power.
Whether that goal was achieved will not be known for some time. But by
bombing now, the United States might have brought about the very thing
it was trying to prevent. It is possible the attack might induce Iran to
capitulate and end its nuclear ambitions. It is far more likely,
however, that the U.S. strike will convince Iranian leaders once and for
all that acquiring nuclear capability is the best way to secure the
regime\'s survival. Regardless of how the Iran situation turns out, the
appeal of nuclear weapons is growing elsewhere. Today, nine nations
possess nuclear weapons, a fraction of the several dozen that are
technically advanced enough to build them. In the worst case, the number
of states with nuclear weapons could more than double in the next two
decades. It is [**hard to overstate** the **[negative
consequences]{.mark}** of wider [nuclear
prolif]{.mark}eration]{.underline}. [[Every]{.mark} nuclear [arsenal
**multiplies** the **risks**: **deliberate**]{.mark} or [**accidental
use**, **theft**]{.mark} and [**diversion**, **loss of control**,
**regional tension**]{.mark} and **escalation**.]{.underline}
[The]{.mark} new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Dan Caine,
recently made clear the dangers: \"[Nuclear [proliferation]{.mark}, even
among Allies, **significantly [limits]{.mark}** U.S. [ability to manage
escalation]{.mark} risk]{.underline},\" he wrote. \"[It could
[trigger]{.mark} **further [acceleration]{.mark}** [of adversary efforts
to modernize]{.mark} and [expand their]{.mark} nuclear
[arsenals]{.mark}]{.underline}. Additionally, [it would irreparably
[erode]{.mark} the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons
([NPT]{.mark}) and could encourage proliferation around the
world.\"]{.underline} Seeing two countries that have nuclear weapons ---
Israel and the U.S. --- attack Iran, a country that does not, is likely
to create even greater interest among some vulnerable states to consider
pursuing their own nuclear programs. The growing military ambitions of
Russia and China, plus the uncertainty surrounding America\'s
commitments to its allies, all add up to a potential surge of new
nuclear-armed countries. The United States started to worry about
Iran\'s nuclear ambitions in the late 1980s, about the same time it
became known that North Korea was developing its own nuclear facilities.
Since then, much of the U.S. focus has been on preventing potential
adversaries, or so-called rogue states, from going nuclear. Yet [the
majority of nations that might decide to go nuclear are not rogue
states, but [U.S. allies]{.mark} and partners]{.underline}. They
[[have]{.mark} some or all of the [necessary technical, economic and
intellectual capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}. In Europe, they include
Poland, Turkey and Germany; [in Asia, South Korea, **[Japan]{.mark}**
and even Taiwan]{.underline}. [If these states were to [go
nuclear]{.mark}, [others]{.mark} might [follow]{.mark}. In the past,
proliferation has **driven more** proliferation.]{.underline} Will the
U.S. strike against Iran reassure allies that the U.S. will take action
to protect their security and interests? Some maintain that it will, but
it is hard to see how one attack can undo the increasingly isolationist
tendencies of the United States or reverse President Donald Trump\'s
skepticism of international alliances. It is far too soon to tell what
lessons other countries will draw from it. Why aren\'t there more
nuclear states? One factor that has slowed the spread of nuclear weapons
for eight decades is that they remain expensive and challenging to build
--- and the nation doing so takes on new risks, including accidents and
unwanted escalation. One longtime government official has called this
\"nonproliferation inertia.\" Fortunately, it is not getting much easier
to build an atomic bomb. Obtaining a supply of highly enriched uranium
or plutonium is still a complex, costly and highly visible undertaking.
But, sadly, [it is getting [easier to **doubt**]{.mark} the United
States\' [**commitment** to **defend allies**]{.mark} that refrain from
building their own nuclear weapons.]{.underline} [[Deterrence and
reassurance depend on]{.mark} both **[military]{.mark}** capability [and
**political** credibility]{.mark}]{.underline}. The credibility of a
promise to protect is the fragile part of the calculus. Who among [U.S.
allies now being hit with massive tariffs on their exports or called
\"freeloaders\" by Trump]{.underline} officials believes the United
States will go to war in their defense should they face attack from
Russia or China? Indeed, [[Trump]{.mark} has [said]{.mark} that [Russia
can do]{.mark} \"**[whatever the hell they want]{.mark}**\" to U.S.
allies who don\'t spend what he deems enough on their own
defense]{.underline}. In this environment[, it is **[hard to
see]{.mark}** how [U.S. allies]{.mark} and partners can have [high
confidence]{.mark} that Trump might put Seattle at risk for Seoul, or
Boston for Berlin]{.underline}. And one increasingly likely response to
this growing unease is that [**[worst-case planning]{.mark}** can
[take]{.mark} [hold]{.mark}, driving nations to seek safety by building
their own nuclear weapons. A world filled with nuclear states is a
**more dangerous world**]{.underline}. The [United States and Soviet
Union had multiple **close calls** during the Cold War:]{.underline}
[**mistakes**, **escalation** and technical **glitches**]{.underline}.
We know that [a world with many [more]{.mark} [nuclear states]{.mark}
will be [plagued]{.mark} in the same way]{.underline}. [Any small clash
could risk a **[wider nuclear conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
It is a matter of hard work and luck that it hasn\'t happened already.
Will the same hold true for the new nuclear-armed powers? One need look
no farther than India and Pakistan to see that having nuclear weapons
has neither kept the peace nor prevented escalation on a regular basis.
The attacks and counterattacks in May reminded the world that escalation
remains a constant risk when nuclear states clash. [With nuclear
weapons, leaders have to get **every decision right** all the time. The
more countries that have nuclear weapons, the more our luck will be
tested.]{.underline} The chain of global nuclear security is only as
good as its weakest link. The United States has worked for many decades
to help nations protect civilian research facilities with sensitive
nuclear materials to avoid enriched uranium or plutonium from falling
into the wrong hands. But more nuclear states will mean more targets for
theft by bad actors --- state and non-state --- as well as by criminal
networks and disgruntled employees. Even if one country manages its
responsibilities well, a sudden change in government, coup or economic
collapse can quickly turn a nuclear arsenal into an acute problem. Is
the sky falling? The debate about whether nuclear weapons would
inevitably spread or could be controlled and eliminated goes all the way
back to the Manhattan Project. Some scientists, including J. Robert
Oppenheimer, believed in creating a global system to control nuclear
assets and eventually eliminate national control over nuclear weapons.
Others thought the spread of nuclear technology was inevitable. It did
spread at first, to U.S. friends such as Britain and France (with U.S.
assistance), and adversaries such as the U.S.S.R. and China. But this
slide toward a nuclear world was slowed. Remarkably, even among fierce
adversaries, there was a consensus that a world filled with nuclear
states would create unacceptably high risks of nuclear war. Thus, there
is broad agreement on preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon,
even as there has been disagreement on the best way to achieve that
outcome. After rejecting military action in 2011 and 2012, the United
States in 2015 persuaded Iran, Russia, China and the European Union to
join a diplomatic initiative to head off Iran\'s nuclear ambitions. At
the time, President Barack Obama said the choice was between that deal
and war. Trump pulled out of the agreement in 2018 and has now chosen
war. This is not the first time the United States has used military
means to address a nuclear danger. Although the U.S. has relied heavily
on diplomatic efforts to stop proliferation in the past, it has also
used military strikes to preempt or prevent adversaries from developing
nuclear weapons. In 1991, the first U.S.-led war against Iraq (to
liberate Kuwait) destroyed a previously unknown and surprisingly
well-developed Iraqi nuclear program. The 2003 invasion of Iraq,
famously justified on the basis of flawed and falsified information that
Iraq was developing a nuclear weapon, is rightly considered a serious
strategic mistake. Despite the sporadic use of military tools, the most
successful efforts to prevent proliferation were achieved through
diplomacy, incentives and global engagement. These efforts gave birth to
an effective set of global agreements and norms, centered around the
Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons of 1968. Nearly all
countries in the world, including Iran, are full members of the NPT, and
the agreement is at the core of a system of overlapping norms, laws,
technology controls, alliances and even verification regimes that have
helped keep a lid on nuclear weapons. For more than 50 years, the U.S.
has been the driver in these efforts. [In East Asia, U.S. pressure was
brought to bear on allies such as Taiwan and South Korea on several
occasions to keep them from building independent nuclear
programs.]{.underline} South Africa\'s apartheid regime eliminated its
arsenal of six nuclear weapons as part of the process of reintegrating
into the international community and having global sanctions lifted.
These global tools also came into play after the Cold War when Ukraine,
Kazakhstan and Belarus, as newly independent states, inherited sizable
nuclear arsenals from the former Soviet Union. Those nations debated for
several years whether to keep them, and decided in the end, with U.S.
support, to relinquish them back to Russia. (Russian nuclear weapons
were recently redeployed to Belarus, now more fully under Moscow\'s
influence.) At the time, these states determined that the burden of
being a nuclear-armed state was not worth the payoff. But now the global
consensus against nuclear arms is weakening. Who might go nuclear? Iran
now faces an immediate decision on whether to race to build a bomb, if
it can. It is not clear where Iran\'s stockpile of enriched uranium is
located, and it is reasonable to assume that some Iranian officials have
planned for the possibility of a U.S. attack by rebuilding enrichment
capabilities at some unknown location. But aside from the prospect of a
crash Iranian program, new nuclear states are unlikely to appear
overnight. It would take a country years and billions of dollars to
become a fully fledged nuclear state. Some nations, including those
facing direct security threats from Russia and China, are debating
whether they need their own nuclear weapons. In Poland, this debate is
very public, while in other states such as Germany and Finland, it is
happening more discreetly. And the Baltic states --- with long memories
of life under Soviet occupation --- might also reconsider their
nonnuclear status even if they don\'t have immediate access to nuclear
material. Security experts in these states have speculated about this
option for decades but, until now, believed they could count on the
United States to keep the lid on. Those beliefs are being tested as
never before. In East Asia, South Korean national security officials
have discussed nuclear options for many years, and public support for a
nuclear program in the face of a nuclear North Korea remains strong.
[[Japan]{.underline}]{.mark}, the only country to have suffered nuclear
attacks, faces political barriers to going nuclear, but, [[in the
face]{.mark} [of]{.mark} an [undependable U.S.]{.mark}, a [nuclear
No]{.mark}rth [Ko]{.mark}rea and an [aggressive China,]{.mark} it is
possible that [public]{.mark} **[opinion will
shift]{.mark}**]{.underline} --- and [[Japan is]{.mark} an **[advanced
country]{.mark}** with [extensive nuclear
capabilities]{.mark}.]{.underline} Taiwan remains another possible
nuclear state --- having actively pursued nuclear weapons in the late
1970s, only to have its program shut down by the United States. The
material Taiwan was to use for its program was shipped to the U.S. in
1981, and its small research reactor was dismantled. It is not clear
whether and how quickly Taiwan could advance a new program, but the
knowledge and technical base are there. If Iran does go nuclear, other
countries in and around the Middle East may well follow suit, including
Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Saudi leader Mohammed bin Salman told Fox News
in 2023 that his country would \"have to get\" a nuclear weapon if Iran
did so. The third group of countries that might consider going nuclear
is states immediately affected by the first two. In the past, states
that went nuclear sparked nuclear interest in at least one other state.
Fear (unwarranted, as it turned out) that Nazi Germany was ahead in a
race for a nuclear bomb was a major factor in the U.S. launching the
Manhattan Project. That caused the Soviet Union to follow suit. That led
to China, which led to India, which led to Pakistan. If multiple states
in the Middle East, Europe and Asia go nuclear, then the prospects of
slowing further proliferation are remote at best. Faced with the
prospect of multiple U.S. allies going nuclear, Washington might decide
it is better to keep such nuclear friends inside a tent than force them
out into the cold. Long opposed to India\'s nuclear program, the U.S.
eventually embraced India as a strategic competitor to China and agreed
to sell peaceful nuclear technology to India. Pakistan\'s nuclear
program was overlooked for years when the United States needed
Pakistan\'s help in fighting the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. A
similar dynamic could easily emerge in Europe, and even more so in Asia,
where some might welcome a nuclear South Korea to further challenge
China\'s strategic position. How much time do we have? Despite Trump\'s
claim that Iran\'s nuclear facilities were \"totally obliterated,\" the
United States still faces a worst-case scenario: that Iran could become
a nuclear state in short order. Beyond that, a few countries, most
notably Japan, could produce a basic nuclear device fairly quickly if
they diverted civilian plutonium or dedicated civilian uranium
enrichment for a crash nuclear program. But most states do not have a
ready source of such material --- a feature, not a bug, of past
nonproliferation efforts. It still requires a large, expensive
industrial program to enrich uranium or produce and purify plutonium ---
as well as to build actual weapons and their delivery systems. In
addition to the time it would take to produce these weapons, most states
would also have to undo the legal and institutional constraints that
exist on their nuclear capabilities. Assuming they choose not to violate
international law, members of the NPT must provide 90 days\' notice of a
decision to withdraw from it. If they do, their nuclear partners have
the right to request that all imported nuclear materials and technology
be returned. Besides that, any European states that pursue nuclear
weapons are subject to multilateral agreements with the International
Atomic Energy Agency to inspect all of their nuclear facilities to
ensure all activities are peaceful and accounted for. These agreements
would also have to be abrogated. And in Europe, members of the European
Union are also bound by E.U. law and E.U.-IAEA agreements. States would
have to renegotiate their E.U. memberships or be forced to withdraw from
the E.U. itself, a long and complex process. Similarly, the civilian
nuclear programs in Japan and South Korea are the result of extensive
nuclear cooperation with the United States and Europe --- agreements
based on the nonnuclear status of those states. Should that change, the
U.S. and France retain the right to both shut down joint nuclear
facilities and demand the return of materials produced with jointly
owned or developed technology. These entanglements are a design feature
of the global nonproliferation norm, intended to provide notice should a
state pursue nuclear weapons, thus giving others time to respond. The
question is what nations will do with that time and information. In
Europe, with NATO states having relied on U.S. nuclear-extended
deterrence for so long, French and British experts and officials are
considering whether, and how, their military and nuclear arsenals can be
used to discourage the potential demand for new independent nuclear
arsenals. President Emmanuel Macron suggested in May that France might
be willing to deploy its nuclear weapons outside French territory,
something unthinkable in years past. It remains far from clear how this
would work. Nor is it clear that British or French nuclear guarantees
would deter Russia or reassure states feeling insecure because of
Trump\'s actions and a weakened NATO. France is clearly trying to
consider such options, with the French ambassador to Sweden stating
clearly that France\'s nuclear \"umbrella\" could be applied to NATO
states. The question is whether French or British commitments to protect
European allies are seen as credible. France had promised to protect
Poland before World War II, but that vow failed to shield Poland from
either Germany or the Soviet Union. In part because of this history, a
discussion has been taking place in Poland for more than a decade about
how to deter Russian aggression. While the country has invested robustly
in a conventional military buildup, nuclear sharing and even national
nuclear options are increasingly being considered. As Poland\'s prime
minister, Donald Tusk, has made clear, \"At the moment --- I say this
with full responsibility --- purchases of conventional weapons, the most
traditional ones, are not enough.\" He cited a \"profound change of
American geopolitics.\" And [in East Asia, [if]{.mark} states such as
[Japan]{.mark}, South Korea or Taiwan decide they [need new nuclear
protection, developing their own]{.mark} national [programs]{.mark}
might be their **[only]{.mark}** practical [option]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Internal political pressure will [force]{.underline} Japanese leaders to seek nuclearization

"Japan's nuclear dilemmas in a challenging new era."
https://eastasiaforum.org/2023/06/01/japans-nuclear-dilemmas-in-a-challenging-new-era/\]

The dilemma is one Japan has faced for decades. In 1967, then prime
minister Eisaku Sato introduced the Three Non-Nuclear Principles,
adopted by the Diet, declaring that Japan will not possess, manufacture
or introduce nuclear weapons. In 1968, Sato reaffirmed this goal in his
Four Pillars of Nuclear Policy, adding commitments to work toward global
nuclear disarmament, nuclear energy's peaceful use and continued
reliance on US extended deterrence. In 1976, Japan ratified the
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and in 1997 the Comprehensive Nuclear
Test Ban Treaty. Japan has consistently submitted draft resolutions
supporting disarmament activities to the UN General Assembly and
participated in programs such as the Non-Proliferation and Disarmament
Initiative. But internal debate has persisted. A [series of [senior
politicians]{.mark} --- including a former minister and vice minister of
defence, and a prominent opposition leader --- have [**expressed
concern** about Japan's lack of]{.mark} its own [nuclear deterrent,
especially **against China**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [Former
chief cabinet secretary Yasuo Fukuda claimed amending the Three
Non-Nuclear Principles was 'likely' after his deputy declared possessing
tactical nuclear weapons would be constitutional. A [**nuclear-armed
North Korea** sparked similar remarks]{.mark}]{.underline}. In 2006,
[after North Korea's first nuclear test, the Liberal Democratic Party's
Policy Research Council Chairman Shoichi Nakagawa proposed a public
discussion of nuclear weapons acquisition]{.underline}. In 2017,
[[former defence minister]{.mark} Shigeru Ishiba [proposed hosting
US]{.mark} [nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark} on Japanese
soil]{.underline} but was dismissed by the defence minister at the time.
Despite its technical capabilities, [[Japan]{.mark} continued to eschew
acquisition, **[relying]{.mark}** instead [on]{.mark} the
[U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates' **[nuclear umbrella]{.mark}**. Japan's
[security dilemmas intensified recently, as leaders and the public
perceive heightened belligerence from its nuclear-armed
neighbours]{.mark}]{.underline}. North Korea's recurrent nuclear and
missile tests of growing sophistication into Japan's vicinity, along
with direct verbal threats, sometimes requires evacuating Japanese
civilians. In his aggressive nuclear rhetoric, President Vladimir
Putin's Russia resembles North Korea and has suspended peace treaty
negotiations with Japan over Northern Territories. Japan also perceives
China's 'no limits' embrace of Putin and 'wolf warrior' diplomacy to
have replaced China's 'peaceful rise'. China's East and South China Sea
military activities and firing of ballistic missiles into Japan's
exclusive economic zone have escalated tensions. Equally concerning is
China's abandonment of its minimal nuclear deterrent capability of about
400 nuclear warheads, which is estimated to increase to 1500 by 2035.
Putin's nuclear rhetoric led even Chinese President Xi Jinping to call
on the international community to 'jointly oppose the use of, or threats
to use, nuclear weapons'. Russia's invasion of Ukraine reignited Japan's
concerns, with former prime minister Shinzo Abe encouraging a national
discussion on nuclear weapons-sharing arrangements with the United
States. But Kishida, along with Defence Minister Nobuo Kishi, expressed
that such an arrangement was 'unacceptable given \[Japan\]'s stance of
maintaining the Three Non-Nuclear Principles'. The durability of Japan's
commitment to abiding by the NPT raises an important consideration. Some
[[security analysts have predicted Japan]{.mark} would [seek its own
nuclear deterrent]{.mark} in tandem [with]{.mark} three of its
[neighbours]{.mark}' nuclearisation]{.underline}. Yet Japan's
decades-old nuclear abstention defies those predictions, which neglected
other considerations.

"Japan should review nuclear arms taboo, retired generals say."
https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/japan-should-allow-nuclear-arms-on-its-soil-for-effective-deterrence-retired-military-officers\]

TOKYO -- The [volatile security environment facing Japan today has led
its military experts to moot an idea that has long been taboo: that its
Three Non-Nuclear Principles dating to 1967 should be
reviewed.]{.underline} As the world's only country to have suffered
atomic bombings, Japan vowed to never possess, produce and permit the
introduction of nuclear weapons to its territory. But [retired
Self-Defence Forces (SDF) officers have lamented an unofficial fourth
principle -- never discuss -- as they fret over the state of Japan's
**military preparedness** with the country being surrounded by the
**nuclear-armed states** of **China**, **Russia** and **North Korea**,
and with the region becoming more **turbulent**]{.underline}. [Japan
enjoys the protection of the nuclear umbrella of its security ally the
United States]{.underline}. Yet in what has been described as "perverse
logic", [the third principle of never permitting nuclear arms on
Japanese territory **bars** the US from bringing such weapons onto
Japanese soil and its nuclear-equipped vessels and bombers from
travelling through its waters and airspace.]{.underline} These [retired
officers said that Japan risks **hamstringing** itself with its
antiquated policies]{.underline}. South Korea, another regional US ally,
in 2023 resumed allowing American nuclear submarines to make port calls,
having previously halted permission in 1981. The most recent call was in
February, when the USS Alexandria docked in Busan. "Both [the Japanese
government and its people have **stopped thinking** about the
operational aspects of how Japan itself can make the US nuclear umbrella
effective]{.underline}," according to a June 2 report released by the
Sasakawa Peace Foundation think-tank. Its contributors included retired
general Koji Yamazaki, a former Chief of Staff of the Joint Staff of the
Japanese military. "In case of a Taiwan contingency, nuclear-equipped US
land, sea, and air forces capable of striking China cannot be deployed
or ported in Japan, which undermines our national security interests and
reduces the effectiveness of the US extended nuclear deterrence," the
report said. It was referring to the possibility of China attacking the
self-ruled island that Beijing claims as its own. "The principle should
be revised to say, 'Do not let (the enemy) strike Japan with nuclear
weapons'. The original wording, 'Do not allow nuclear weapons into
Japan' is perverse as a security logic," the report added. An earlier
report, in March, by eight retired SDF officers, including retired
general Ryoichi Oriki, also a former Chief of Staff of the Joint Staff,
called for the creation of strategic guidelines on nuclear issues, and
the clarification of how Japan can simultaneously pursue the
contradictory goals of nuclear deterrence and nuclear disarmament. "[The
time has come to **fundamentally** and **comprehensively** review our
country's nuclear weapon policy]{.underline}," the report said. These
[retired officers are **planting the seeds** for **policy change** as
Tokyo is spooked by developments in its neighbourhood]{.underline}.
[China, which may possess 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030, and has in
recent years increased its military drills near Taiwan and its grey zone
activity against it, could well **wage a nuclear war** in its bid to
reunify the island.]{.underline} North Korea's ballistic missile
development continues apace, while Russia has threatened to use its
strategic nuclear forces on Ukraine. Events in Asia and beyond have led
the US-based Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists to set its Doomsday
Clock, which symbolises how close humanity is to its own destruction, at
89 seconds to midnight in January 2025 during its annual review, from
the previous 90 seconds. This is the shortest it has ever been. Yet any
broaching of the subject of nuclear weapons is taboo to the Japanese
public -- and would likely amount to political suicide for any
politician who does so. Security hawks such as the late former prime
minister Shinzo Abe had considered revising the Three Non-Nuclear
Principles, but eventually backed down. But [Japan has **refused to
sign** the 2017 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons that bans
nuclear arms totally and goes further than two older treaties to which
it is a signatory]{.underline}. It is undeniable that [Japan is at a
crossroads of its nuclear policy]{.underline}, 80 years after the US
dropped Little Boy and Fat Man on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,
respectively. And this is worrisome for the region. On June 6,
Singapore's Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan raised the spectre of
North-east Asia being home to five nuclear powers -- Russia, China,
North Korea, South Korea and Japan -- during a discussion at the Hudson
Institute think-tank during his working visit to Washington. "A
North-east Asia with five nuclear powers -- which in fact has become
more, not less likely -- is actually a very dangerous circumstance," he
said during a fireside chat with Hudson's Asia-Pacific security chair
Patrick Cronin, noting that the weight of Japan's wartime history could
be inflammatory. However, he noted that the discussions have been
triggered by the turbulence wrought by US President Donald Trump, which
has caused allies to reassess the robustness of their security
relationships. "For 80 years, the American security umbrella in
North-east Asia in fact has been a key stabiliser for the relationships
in a complicated part of the world," he said. "One adverse effect of the
turbulence, uncertainty in rules, security arrangements, and trust, is
that, I fear, other leaders will be having unthinkable thoughts." Such
"unthinkable thoughts" might include a [push towards manufacturing
nuclear weapons. Japan is said to own enough stockpiles of plutonium,
generated from spent nuclear plant fuel, to quickly produce 7,000 atomic
bombs by some estimates.]{.underline} Cabinet Office statistics show
that Japan held 44.5 tonnes of plutonium as at December 2023, with 8.6
tonnes stored within the country and 35.8 tonnes kept overseas. Experts,
however, see this step as unlikely given that Japan does not have the
delivery platforms, which would take decades to either acquire or build.
"[Japan needs deterrence to be credible, all of which needs to be
developed beyond simply building a warhead]{.underline}," Professor Heng
Yee Kuang of The University of Tokyo's Graduate School of Public Policy
told The Straits Times. "Doctrine would also require attention. This
will open an additional can of worms. Will the US help? How might
regional partners react, beyond domestic opinion?" he said, noting the
worst-case scenario of a destabilising nuclear arms race. [The
introduction of nuclear weapons, however, is necessary for effective
extended deterrence by the US-Japan alliance, the retired SDF officers
argue.]{.underline} "A Taiwan contingency has also been called a Japan
contingency or a Japan-US contingency, and this possibility has been
increasing," Gen (Ret) Yamazaki told a Sasakawa Peace Foundation webinar
on June 2. "[If China attempts to unify Taiwan by force, it could
**easily alienate** Japan and the US by using tactical nuclear
weapons]{.underline}," he said, adding that [the US would clearly be
hampered in its deterrence if it did not have nuclear weapons in the
neighbourhood.]{.underline} Furthermore, SDF personnel must be trained
to deepen their understanding and operational capabilities of nuclear
weapons, said retired Lieutenant-General Sadamasa Oue, who was formerly
commander of the Air Material Command of the Japan Air Self-Defence
Force. "The SDF should be proactive in supporting the US military in
their use of nuclear weapons," he said. "This will strengthen trust
between the two allies."

What if Japan developed nuclear weapons?

Conjecture about a nuclear-armed Japan happens more in the US than in
Japan itself, unsurprising for the only country to have experienced the
devastation of nuclear weapons. However, discussion has increased in
Tokyo in light of the Korea crisis. Shigeru Ishiba, a former defence
minister and potential successor to Shinzo Abe, has called for a more
open debate on Japan's non-nuclear stance.

Japan is one of the few states without nuclear weapons to have an
enrichment facility, and has a domestic stockpile of 10 tons of
plutonium, with 37 tons stored overseas. Unlike South Korea, [if the
government desired, it could probably produce a device within a year.
Japan would eventually be likely to develop submarine-launched ballistic
missiles for a credible second-strike capability against North Korea and
China.]{.underline}

Bear in mind that the US alliance with the UK did not shatter when the
latter developed nuclear arms, nor did the US abandon France in the face
of de Gaulle's nuclear force de frappe. Could Tokyo be a new London, and
Seoul a new Paris?

If we believe the structural realism of Kenneth Waltz, then the answer
is \'yes\'. However, **[[Beijing and Tokyo]{.mark} are [in
conflict]{.mark} over broad questions of regional order and identity, as
well as over territory.]{.underline}** Kausikan points out that [since
Japan's invasion of Chinese-aligned Korea in the 16th century, it has
refused to be part of a Sino-centric order, and [hence]{.mark} [Tokyo
needs a nuclear arsenal]{.mark}. But **[the opposite is true. Such
weapons]{.mark} would in fact only [intensify]{.mark} that historical
[rivalry.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[[How much security]{.mark} would [nuclear weapons buy for]{.mark} South
Korea and [Japan? **Less than**]{.mark} **widely
[assumed.]{.mark}**]{.underline} They would provide a guarantee against
large-scale invasion, but little else. [[Flashpoints]{.mark} such as the
Senkaku Islands could trigger armed conflict not quite serious enough to
warrant a nuclear response, or we could see a brushfire conflict across
the DMZ, or the western maritime border, [against a nuclear
backdrop]{.mark}. If this becomes a new norm, **the implications for
regional security are obvious.**]{.underline}

Though the likelihood and consequences of South Korea and Japan joining
the nuclear weapons club are very different, [one thing is true for the
whole region: **proliferation of [nuclear weapons]{.mark} in Asia [will
not make the region more secure]{.mark}. At best, it is an expensive
chimera; at worst, it will strike at the foundations of
peace.**]{.underline}

#### Prolif increases the risk of a nuclear exchange -- extinction.

[The spread of nuclear weapons poses at least six **severe threats** to
international peace and security including: **nuclear war**, **nuclear
terrorism**, global and]{.underline} [regional instability, constrained
US freedom of action, **weakened alliances**, and further nuclear
proliferation.]{.underline} Each of these threats has received extensive
treatment elsewhere and this review is not intended to replicate or even
necessarily to improve upon these previous efforts. Rather the goals of
this section are more modest: to usefully bring together and recap the
many reasons why [we should be pessimistic about the likely consequences
of nuclear proliferation]{.underline}. Many of these threats will be
illuminated with a discussion of a case of much contemporary concern:
Iran's advanced nuclear program. Nuclear War [The greatest
threat]{.underline} posed by the spread of nuclear weapons [is nuclear
war. [The **more states** in possession of nuclear
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [the **greater the
probability**]{.underline}]{.mark} [that somewhere, someday, [there will
be a]{.mark} **catastrophic [nuclear]{.mark}**
[war]{.mark}.]{.underline} To date, nuclear weapons have only been used
in warfare once. In 1945, the United States used nuclear weapons on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki, bringing World War II to a close. Many analysts
point to the 65-plus-year tradition of nuclear non-use as evidence that
nuclear weapons are unusable, but it would be naïve to think that
nuclear weapons will never be used again simply because they have not
been used for some time. After all, analysts in the 1990s argued that
worldwide economic downturns like the Great Depression were a thing of
the past, only to be surprised by the dot-com bubble bursting later in
the decade and the Great Recession of the late 2000s.48 This author, for
one, would be surprised if nuclear weapons are not used again sometime
in his lifetime. [[Before]{.mark} reaching a state of
**[MAD]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[new]{.mark} nuclear [states]{.mark} go
through a **transition** period in which they [**lack**]{.mark} a
[secure-**second strike** capability]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this
context, [one or both states might believe that [it has an **incentive**
to **use**]{.mark} nuclear weapons **[first]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For
example, if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, neither Iran, nor its
nuclear-armed rival, Israel, will have a secure, second-strike
capability. Even though it is believed to have a large arsenal, [given
its small size and lack of strategic depth, Israel might not be
confident that it could absorb a nuclear strike and respond with a
devastating counterstrike]{.underline}. Similarly, [Iran might
eventually be able to build a large and survivable nuclear arsenal, but,
when it first crosses the nuclear threshold, Tehran will have a small
and vulnerable nuclear force]{.underline}. In these pre-MAD situations,
there are at least three ways that nuclear war could occur. First, [the
state with the nuclear advantage might believe it has a]{.underline}
[splendid first strike capability. In a crisis, Israel
might]{.underline}, therefore, [decide to launch [a
**preventive**]{.mark} **nuclear [strike]{.mark}** to disarm Iran's
nuclear capabilities.]{.underline} Indeed, [this]{.underline}
**[incentive]{.underline}** [might be further increased by Israel's
aggressive strategic culture that [emphasizes]{.mark} **preemptive
action**.]{.underline} Second, [the state with a small and
vulnerable]{.underline} nuclear arsenal, in this case Iran, [might feel
**[use]{.mark} th[em or lose]{.mark} th[em
pressures]{.mark}**]{.underline}. That is, [in a crisis, Iran might
decide to strike first rather than risk having its entire nuclear
arsenal destroyed]{.underline}. Third, as Thomas Schelling has argued,
[nuclear war could result due to the reciprocal fear of surprise
attack]{.underline}.49 If there are advantages to striking first, [one
state might start a nuclear war in the belief that war is inevitable and
that it would be better to go first than to go second]{.underline}.
Fortunately, there is no historic evidence of this dynamic occurring in
a nuclear context, but it is still possible. In an Israeli--Iranian
crisis, for example, Israel and Iran might both prefer to avoid a
nuclear war, but decide to strike first rather than suffer a devastating
first attack from an opponent. Even in a world of MAD, however, when
both sides have secure, second-strike capabilities, **[there is still a
risk of nuclear war]{.underline}**. Rational deterrence theory assumes
nuclear-armed states are governed by rational leaders who would not
intentionally launch a suicidal nuclear war. This assumption appears to
have applied to past and current nuclear powers, but there is no
guarantee that it will continue to hold in the future. [Iran's
theocratic government]{.underline}, despite its inflammatory rhetoric,
has followed a fairly pragmatic foreign policy since 1979, but it
[contains leaders who hold millenarian religious worldviews and could
one day ascend to power. We cannot rule out the possibility that, as
nuclear weapons continue to spread, some leader somewhere will choose to
launch a nuclear war,]{.underline} knowing full well that it could
result in self-destruction. One does not need to resort to
irrationality, however, to imagine nuclear war under MAD. Nuclear
weapons may deter leaders from intentionally launching full-scale wars,
but they do not mean the end of international politics. As was discussed
above, [nuclear-armed states still have conflicts of interest and
leaders]{.underline} [still seek to coerce nuclear-armed
adversaries]{.underline}. Leaders might, therefore, choose to launch a
limited nuclear war.50 This strategy might be especially attractive to
states in a position of conventional inferiority that might have an
incentive to escalate a crisis quickly to the nuclear level. During the
Cold War, the United States planned to use nuclear weapons first to stop
a Soviet invasion of Western Europe given NATO's conventional
inferiority.51 As Russia's conventional power has deteriorated since the
end of the Cold War, Moscow has come to rely more heavily on nuclear
weapons in its military doctrine. Indeed, Russian strategy calls for the
use of nuclear weapons early in a conflict (something that most Western
strategists would consider to be escalatory) as a way to de-escalate a
crisis. Similarly, Pakistan's military plans for nuclear use in the
event of an invasion from conventionally stronger India. And finally,
Chinese generals openly talk about the possibility of nuclear use
against a US superpower in a possible East Asia contingency. Second, as
was also discussed above, [[leaders]{.mark} can make a 'threat that
leaves something to chance'.]{.underline}52 **[They [can initiate a
nuclear crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[By playing]{.mark} these risky
games of nuclear [brink]{.mark}man[ship]{.mark}, [states can increase
the risk]{.mark} of nuclear war in an attempt [**to force a less
resolved adversary** to **back**]{.mark} **[down]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
Historical [crises have not resulted in nuclear war, but many of
them]{.underline}, including the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, [have **come
close**]{.underline}. And scholars have documented historical incidents
when accidents nearly led to war.53 [When we think about future nuclear
crisis dyads]{.underline}, such as Iran and Israel, [with fewer sources
of stability than existed during the Cold War, we can see that there is
a real risk that **[a future crisis could result in a]{.mark}
devastating [nuclear exchange]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Nuclear Terrorism
[The spread of nuclear weapons also **increases the risk of nuclear
terrorism**]{.underline}.54 While September 11th was one of the greatest
tragedies in American history, it would have been much worse had Osama
Bin Laden possessed nuclear weapons. Bin [Laden declared it a 'religious
duty' for Al- Qa'eda to acquire]{.underline} [nuclear weapons and
radical clerics have issued fatwas declaring it permissible to use
nuclear weapons in Jihad against the West]{.underline}.55 [Unlike
states, which can be more easily deterred, there is little doubt that if
terrorists acquired nuclear weapons, they would use them.56]{.underline}
Indeed, in recent years, many US politicians and security analysts have
argued that nuclear terrorism poses the greatest threat to US national
security.57 **[Analysts]{.underline}** [have pointed out]{.underline}
the tremendous **[hurdles]{.underline}** [that terrorists would have to
overcome]{.underline} [in order to acquire nuclear
weapons.58]{.underline} **[Nevertheless]{.underline}**, [as nuclear
weapons spread, the possibility that they will **eventually fall into
terrorist hands increases**]{.underline}. [States could intentionally
**transfer nuclear weapons**]{.underline}, [or]{.underline} the fissile
material required to build them, [to terrorist groups]{.underline}.
There are good reasons why a state might be reluctant to transfer
nuclear weapons to terrorists, but, [as]{.underline} nuclear **[weapons
spread]{.underline}**, [the probability that a leader might someday
**purposely arm a terrorist group increases**]{.underline}. Some fear,
for example, that Iran, with its close ties to Hamas and Hizballah,
might be at a heightened risk of transferring nuclear weapons to
terrorists. Moreover, even if no state would ever intentionally transfer
nuclear capabilities to terrorists, [a **new nuclear state**, with
**underdeveloped security** procedures, might be vulnerable to
**theft**, allowing terrorist groups or corrupt or
ideologically-motivated insiders to transfer dangerous material to
terrorists.]{.underline} There is evidence, for example, that
representatives from Pakistan's atomic energy establishment met with
Al-Qa'eda members to discuss a possible nuclear deal.59 Finally, [[a
nuclear]{.mark}-armed [state could collapse]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[resulting in]{.mark} a breakdown of law and order and a [loose
nukes]{.mark} problem]{.underline}. US officials are currently very
concerned about what would happen to Pakistan's nuclear weapons if the
government were to fall. As nuclear weapons spread, this problem is only
further amplified. Iran is a country with a history of revolutions and a
government with a tenuous hold on power. The regime change that
Washington has long dreamed about in Tehran could actually become a

[**Regional Instability** The spread of nuclear weapons also **emboldens

be more aggressive in the conduct of their foreign policy]{.underline}.
In this way, n[uclear weapons provide a shield under which states can
feel free to engage in **lower-level aggression**]{.underline}. Indeed,
international relations theories about the 'stability-instability
paradox' maintain that stability at the nuclear level contributes to
conventional instability.60 **[[Historically]{.underline}]{.mark}**, we
have seen that [the **[spread]{.mark} of nuclear weapons** has
emboldened their possessors and [contributed to **regional
instability**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Recent scholarly analyses have
demonstrated that, after controlling for other relevant factors,
nuclear-weapon states are more likely to engage in conflict than
nonnuclear]{.underline}-[weapon states]{.underline} and that [this
aggressiveness is more pronounced in new nuclear states that have less
experience with nuclear diplomacy.]{.underline}61 Similarly, research on
internal decision-making in Pakistan reveals that Pakistani foreign
policymakers may have been emboldened by the acquisition of nuclear
weapons, which encouraged them to initiate militarized disputes against
India.62 Currently, Iran restrains its foreign policy because it fears
major military retaliation from the United States or Israel, but with
nuclear weapons it could feel free to push harder. A [nuclear-armed Iran
would likely step up support to terrorist and proxy groups and engage in
more aggressive coercive diplomacy]{.underline}. With a nuclear-armed
Iran increasingly throwing its weight around in the region, **[we could
witness an even more crisis prone Middle East.]{.underline}** [And in a
poly-nuclear Middle East]{.underline} with Israel, Iran, and, in the
future, possibly other states, armed with nuclear weapons, [**any** one
of those [**crises** could result in a **catastrophic nuclear
exchange**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

capabilities that the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF) has
already developed to enhance its role in surveillance and
intelligence-gathering in the North Pacific]{.underline}. Even after the
Cold War, the JMSDF maintained its surveillance and
intelligence-gathering operations in the North to keep not only North
Korea's but also China's and Russia's military behavior in check. These
efforts may need to be enhanced once again, especially given the
elevated level of military activities by China and Russia. The biggest
challenge for Japan may lie in resource allocation. Japan has spent the
last 10-15 years redirecting its defense investment and its force
posture to focus more on defending the Southwestern Islands. The
resurgence of the Cold War-era challenge from the North could complicate
the ongoing effort, as Japan now has to respond to the security concern
in the North once again. However, as Japan anticipates a U.S. request to
"do more" in the U.S.-Japan alliance, enhancing its investment to
support Japan's capability for North Pacific security can offer a
meaningful option.

[[Science and science diplomacy have always been key priorities for
Japan]{.underline}.]{.mark} During the negotiations of the 2017
Agreement on Scientific Cooperation under the auspices of the Arctic
Council, [Japan was one of the few key observer states that positively
contributed to the negotiations]{.underline}. [[Japan has been actively
involved in Arctic research]{.mark} [through various]{.mark} projects
and [collaborations]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, the Arctic
Challenge for Sustainability (ArCS) project launched in 2015 aims to
enhance Japan\'s Arctic research capabilities and promote international
cooperation. This project elucidates changes in the climate and
environment and clarifies their effects on human society. The ArCS
project also provides accurate projections and environmental assessments
to internal and external stakeholders, enabling them to make appropriate
decisions regarding the sustainable development of the Arctic region.
[[Japan is also investing in]{.mark} advanced o[bservation
tech]{.mark}nologies such as satellite remote sensing and autonomous
underwater vehicles [to monitor and study the Arctic
environment]{.mark}]{.underline}. These technologies provide critical
data for understanding the impact of climate change and supporting
evidence-based policymaking. Having briefly reviewed the history and
content of Japan\'s Arctic policy, this article now touches upon the
impact of Russia\'s invasion of Ukraine. The conflict has had
significant repercussions for Arctic cooperation. In response, the
Arctic States, excluding Russia, issued a joint statement condemning the
invasion and suspended their participation in all Arctic Council
meetings. This suspension halted cooperation and dialogue in all Arctic
areas, including scientific research. While the Arctic Council\'s
Working Groups and Expert Groups have resumed their activities in a
limited fashion, prospects remain uncertain. In April 2023, the Cabinet
approved the Fourth Basic Plan on Ocean Policy, which continues to
position Arctic policy as a \"key measure to be steadily promoted\" in
the Plan. The Plan also addresses the impact of the invasion of Ukraine
as outlined below: Currently, due to the impact of Russia\'s invasion of
Ukraine, some Arctic-related activities, including the Arctic Council,
have been suspended, creating uncertainty about the future of the Arctic
situation. However, our country remains committed to advancing the three
pillars of its Arctic policy---research and development, international
cooperation, and sustainable use. We will continue to exchange
information with relevant countries and ensure thorough preparation for
all possible scenarios (author's translation). Since their resumption in
2024, Japan has dispatched experts and government officials to Arctic
Council working groups and task forces, thereby enhancing its
contributions to Arctic science. However, given the Council's limited
functionality, the efficacy of Japan's contributions is questionable.
[[Despite the complications]{.mark} and tensions surrounding Arctic
cooperation at the moment]{.underline}, [[Japan is committed to
remaining an active and increasingly more prominent advocate for
scientific endeavor]{.mark}, [multinational collaboration, and
sustainability in Arctic affairs]{.mark}]{.underline}. This commitment
is encapsulated in the Fourth Basic Plan. In accordance with the Plan,
[Japan will "always consider the optimal combination of bilateral and
multilateral approaches, further promote exchanges of views with Arctic
and other relevant countries, maximize the use of international
frameworks related to the Arctic, strengthen the dissemination of our
country\'s perspectives and achievements in observation and
research]{.underline}, and enhance our presence (author's translation)."

Adopted in October 2015, [Japan's Arctic
Policy](https://www8.cao.go.jp/ocean/english/arctic/pdf/japans_ap_e.pdf)
covered a wide range of topics. These included global environmental
issues, indigenous peoples of the Arctic, science and technology, the
rule of law, the promotion of international cooperation, the Arctic Sea
Route, natural resources development, and national security. However,
for a more comprehensive understanding of Japan's engagement with the
Arctic, one should look at Japan's Basic Plan on Ocean Policy. The Plan
provides a clearer picture of the evolving thought process behind
Japanese policymaking related to the Arctic. The Basic Plan on Ocean
Policy is reviewed and updated every five years to ensure its relevance
and effectiveness in addressing the evolving maritime issues. The Arctic
first appeared in the [Second Basic Plan on Ocean
Policy](https://www8.cao.go.jp/ocean/english/plan/pdf/plan02_e.pdf) in
2013. This plan outlined three directions for the Arctic: observing and
studying the region from a global perspective, increasing international
cooperation, and utilizing the Arctic Sea Route. On April 28, 2023,
Japan released its [fourth
version](https://www8.cao.go.jp/ocean/policies/plan/plan04/pdf/keikaku_honbun.pdf)
of the Basic Plan on Ocean Policy, which further demonstrated the
country's growing engagement in the Polar North. While the fundamental
priorities around research, international cooperation, and sustainable
utilization remain consistent across the Second and [Third Basic Plan on
Ocean
Policy](https://www8.cao.go.jp/ocean/policies/plan/plan04/pdf/keikaku_honbun.pdf),
the updated policy reveals meaningful evolutions that showcase Japan
assuming a more assertive Arctic identity to match its interests with
influence. The latest document is currently not available in English,
and this op-ed provides a summary of its main Arctic-related content.
**What's new in Japan's Arctic Engagement?** [[The Fourth Basic Plan on
Ocean Policy reaffirms Japan's commitment to]{.mark} (1) [enhancing
Arctic research capabilities]{.mark} to guide its Arctic-related
decisions, (2) [fostering international scientific cooperation]{.mark},
and (3) nurturing the next generation of talent to address Arctic
issues]{.underline}. It underscores the importance of contributing to
international forums such as the Arctic Council, and cooperative
frameworks with other Arctic states, to help shape rules and norms. The
plan also emphasizes the importance of creating a safe environment for
Japanese shipping companies when utilizing the Arctic Sea Route by using
satellite data to create sea ice charts, thereby enhancing Arctic
navigation safety. It also encourages the Japanese business community's
active participation in international forums such as the Arctic Economic
Council and the Arctic Circle to expand Arctic region economic
activities, while prioritizing sustainable Arctic resource development
and shipping route use. What are the new elements in this updated
version? **Research** The latest plan provides more concrete details on
developing technologies to strengthen Arctic observation capabilities,
including constructing a new ice-breaking research vessel. Scheduled for
completion in 2026, [the
vessel](https://www.jamstec.go.jp/parv/e/overview/#spec) promises
unmatched observational capabilities and icebreaking capacity to access
remote sections of the Arctic Ocean. Collaborative projects such as [the
Arctic Challenge for Sustainability Initiative II (ArCS
II)](https://www.nipr.ac.jp/arcs2/e/) are set to not only accelerate
discovery and ensure these insights actively shape Japan's Arctic agenda
in real-time, but also develop human resources who can lead
international discussions to solve problems in the Arctic.
**International cooperation** The fourth version puts more emphasis on
adhering to international law principles such as freedom of navigation
in the Arctic Ocean, which is aligned with its [Free and Open
Indo-Pacific
Vision](https://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/other/bluebook/2019/html/chapter1/c0102.html#sf01).
The updated document also reflects recent negotiations culminating in a
2021 legally binding
[agreement](https://www.arcticwwf.org/newsroom/features/the-central-arctic-ocean-fisheries-agreement-what-it-is-is-not-and-might-be/).
The agreement, which came into force in June 2021, bans unregulated
[fishing](https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/climate-change-factor-impacting-current-future-commercial-fisheries-arctic-region/)
in Central Arctic Ocean international waters. As an active participant
in these talks since 2015, Japan strictly adheres to this treaty on
sustainable fisheries management regimen. This approach balances
imminent economic opportunity with long-term conservation needs in the
face of warming, acidic waters, and shifting fish stocks. **Sustainable
utilization** The area of sustainable utilization is particularly
exciting as it features the most updated elements in the plan's fourth
version. While it does not address specific natural, technical,
institutional, and economic issues related to the route as its
predecessors, it provides more detailed strategies to support Japanese
shipping companies in utilizing the Arctic Sea Route[. [This
includes]{.mark} (1) collecting information on the Arctic region and the
Arctic Sea Route, and (2) [fostering cooperation between industry,
academia, and government, with an emphasis on information sharing. The
plan also prioritizes climate change mitigation]{.mark} and Arctic
environmental conservation]{.underline}, which is in line with the
"[Long-Term Strategy for Growth Based on the Paris
Agreement](https://unfccc.int/sites/default/files/resource/Japan_LTS2021.pdf)"
and the "[Plan for Global Warming
Countermeasures](https://www.env.go.jp/content/900505720.pdf)."
**Conclusion** [[The Fourth Basic Plan on Ocean Policy]{.mark} [reveals
a]{.mark} notably [more proactive]{.mark}, assertive, and ambitious
[tone]{.mark} [across]{.mark} the main pillars of [research,
international cooperation]{.mark}, and sustainable utilization than its
predecessors.]{.underline} In particular, with the fourth version
further empowering sustainable utilization, Japan cements itself as an
engaged steward rather than a bystander across Arctic development to set
the standard for the entire region. This nuance shows Japan's pragmatic
understanding of the complex dynamics shaping the 21^st^-century Arctic
amid climate change and internationalization. In an age of climate
crisis and growing [great power
competition](https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/return-great-power-competition-arctic/),
Japan faces increasing incentives to engage itself across the Arctic
region's research, governance, and emerging commerce landscape. As
demonstrated in the fourth version, the country asserts itself as an
essential partner in stewarding and studying this vital region alongside
fellow concerned nations. Both international collaboration and domestic
coordination are key vehicles for Japan to match its ambitions with its
capabilities in an increasingly busy Polar North.

However, a separate investigation is required to determine how this
change in the balance of power is specifically related to 'security
developments in the Arctic', which [[Japan's Arctic Policy
identifies]{.underline}]{.mark} as requiring careful attention, and the
extent to which this change has influenced the Policy's implementation.
The [2015 Arctic Policy]{.underline} recognises that the opening of the
Arctic sea route and the availability of new resources will serve as new
sources of friction among countries. It is also acknowledged that as a
result, ['\[[s\]ome Arctic states]{.mark}, with a view toward securing
their national interests and protecting their territories, [have become
active in]{.mark} the area of [national defense]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Moves toward expanding military presence may have an impact on the
international security environment'. Therefore, [[for Japan, 'it is
important to prevent moves to strengthen military]{.mark} [presence in
the region]{.mark}]{.underline} from leading to tension and
confrontations'. It recognises that moves to [[enhance military]{.mark}
presence [could alter the security]{.mark} environment [not only in the
Arctic but also around Japan]{.mark}]{.underline}. Accordingly, it
states that [Japan must 'pay close attention to moves by the states
concerned]{.underline} and also to promote cooperation with the Arctic
and other states'. Following the announcement of the 2018 Basic Plan,
[[Minister of Foreign Affairs]{.mark} Kono [stated]{.mark} in his
keynote speech at the Arctic Circle, that ['\[n\]o one wants]{.mark} the
[Arctic]{.mark} to be a place where interests collide and
[conflicts]{.mark} are solved by power']{.underline} (2018 Foreign
Minister Kono Speech, 4). The 2023 Basic Plan states---although not
necessarily in a security-specific context---that the impact of Russia's
aggression of Ukraine has made the future circumstances surrounding the
Arctic uncertain. In response, the Plan states that Japan will maintain
the three pillars of its Arctic Policy while 'continuing to exchange
information with relevant states and making thorough preparations for
all scenarios'. The 2024 Priority Strategy adopts mostly identical
wording. In other words, [Japan's Arctic policy]{.underline} documents
have [undergone no significant changes]{.underline} in their wording or
in the key concerns [over the last decade]{.underline}.

[As Russia has made barely veiled nuclear threats against Ukraine and
NATO, a sense has emerged in East Asia that the role of nuclear weapons
may change]{.underline} globally.Footnote3 As other articles in this
special issue show, countries across the world are adapting to the new
security landscape, and nuclear weapons are regaining a prominent place
in it. East Asia is no exception to this sentiment. [[The war in Ukraine
has heightened Japan's]{.underline}]{.mark} and South Korea's [[security
concerns, sparking]{.mark} a reassessment of external nuclear threats
and [debate]{.mark}s [about]{.mark} various [nuclear]{.mark}-deterrent
[options]{.mark}]{.underline}. For Tokyo and Seoul, the new developments
in European security and nuclear-weapons discourse are highly relevant.
Like the European members of NATO, [[Japan]{.mark} and South Korea [rely
heavily on]{.mark} the [extended deterrence]{.mark} provided [by the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates. They have therefore closely watched
Washington's policy toward Ukraine and Russia.]{.underline} Although
Russia itself has presented limited military threats to the two East
Asian states since the end of the Cold War, they are concerned about
Moscow's blatant challenge to the territorial order of the international
system. After all, Japan and South Korea also face the threats of
aggressive and autocratic neighbors, China and North Korea, albeit to
different degrees.

[This article examines]{.underline} the continuity and changes in
Jap[anese and South Korean discourse on nuclear weapons before and after
the Russian invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}. The publics in the two
countries have exhibited markedly different attitudes toward nuclear
weapons since February 2022. [[While Japan has experienced]{.mark}
significant [shifts in]{.mark} its broad national-[security discourse,
its discourse on nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark} [has remained]{.mark}
largely [unchanged]{.mark}.]{.underline} In contrast, South Korea's
nuclear discourse has undergone substantial changes since the onset of
the war. Although norms concerning nuclear weapons have evidently
influenced both countries, strategic considerations regarding the
intensity of threats from their main external adversaries and the likely
types of external aggression have played significant roles in shaping
nuclear discourse.

More specifically, [**[Japan has maintained its distance from nuclear
options]{.underline}**, [focusing on]{.underline}]{.mark} [bolstering
its [conventional capabilities]{.mark} to counter the nonexistential
threat from China]{.underline} and the risk of aerial or naval
aggression. [In Japan]{.underline}, where [[the nuclear taboo]{.mark}
since 1945 [has been very strong, even the shock of the war has not been
enough to turn public opinion]{.mark}]{.underline}.Footnote4 Although
there were important changes in Japan's national-security discourse,
continuity prevailed in the nuclear-weapons discourse. Conversely, South
Korea has actively explored various nuclear-deterrent options to deter
the existential threat from North Korea and the potential risk of ground
attacks. In South Korea, where there was already significant support for
acquiring nuclear weapons prior to the onset of the Ukraine war, this
support has increased even further. According to a synthesis of four
different periodic public-opinion surveys released by four South Korean
research institutions, the average public support for the option of
independent nuclear armament was 66.1 percent in the first surveys
conducted after February 2022. This represents an increase of 4.7
percentage points from the average support found in the last surveys
conducted before February 2022.Footnote5 South Korea's government
discourse on nuclear-weapons policy, supported by public opinion and
further accelerated by the Yoon Suk Yeol administration's "peace through
strength" approach, has undergone significant changes since the
beginning of the war. As we will explain later, while it is tempting to
attribute the two countries' diverging trajectories solely to nuclear
norms and public opinion, the discourse of policy elites and strategic
calculations also need to be taken into account.Footnote6

[[On December]{.mark} 16, [2022, the Japanese government approved three
major documents on]{.mark} its security and [defense
policy]{.mark}]{.underline} at a cabinet meeting---the National Security
Strategy, the National Defense Strategy, and the Defense Buildup
Program. [[The]{.underline}]{.mark} three [[documents marked a]{.mark}n
important [shift]{.mark} in Japan's defense policy
[in]{.mark}]{.underline} areas such as [its pursuit of [conventional
counterstrike capabilities]{.mark} and]{.underline} a drastic increase
in [defense spending]{.underline} (from around 1 percent to 2 percent of
gross domestic product by fiscal year 2027). The National Defense
Strategy points out that an "unprecedented situation is unfolding," as
Russia "has launched an outright aggression against Ukraine, repeatedly
taken actions and sent messages that can be interpreted as threat
\[sic\] of nuclear weapons use."Footnote29

The three documents discuss threats of nuclear weapons many times,
[[but]{.underline} [the]{.underline}]{.mark} [National Security
[Strategy states]{.mark} that "[Japan will]{.mark} adhere to the basic
policy of [maintain]{.mark}ing [an exclusively]{.mark} national
[defense-oriented policy, not becoming a military power]{.mark} that
poses a threat to other countries, [and observing]{.mark} the Three
[Non-Nuclear Principles]{.mark}]{.underline} \[of non-possession,
non-production, and non-introduction of nuclear weapons\]."Footnote30
The three documents discuss nuclear weapons to protect Japan only in the
context of the US nuclear umbrella over Japan:

Japan will fundamentally reinforce its defense capabilities and deepen
security cooperation with the United States. By undertaking such
efforts, Japan will further strengthen the deterrence and response
capabilities of the Japan--U.S. Alliance, including extended deterrence
by the U.S. that is backed by its full range of capabilities, including
nuclear.Footnote31

Thus, the government [[discourse did not shift in]{.mark} a direction
that emphasizes the importance of nuclear weapons for Japan's national
security, let alone [support for]{.mark}]{.underline} nuclear sharing or
[[development]{.underline}]{.mark} [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} indigenous
[[nuc]{.underline}]{.mark}lear weapon[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[Japan's [public opinion continued to demonstrate a strong anti-nuclear
norm]{.mark}]{.underline}, but there were also signs that Russia's
invasion of Ukraine was affecting the public's view of international
security. On the one hand, [80 percent]{.underline} of Japanese
respondents in 2023 [supported maintaining the Three Non-Nuclear
Principles, and [this makes it difficult for politicians to advocate a
change in]{.mark} Japan's [nuclear]{.mark}-weapons
[policy]{.mark}]{.underline}.Footnote32 On the other hand, the shock of
the Russian invasion and Moscow's threat of nuclear use also created a
rare political opportunity to talk about changing that policy. For
instance, former prime minister Shinzo Abe, on February 27, 2022,
remarked on television that discussion of nuclear sharing should not be
seen as taboo. His position was supported by Nippon Ishin, a
conservative opposition party.Footnote33 The public's reaction to Abe's
statement was initially difficult to interpret, as polls with different
wording showed widely varying levels of support for discussing nuclear
sharing, ranging from 20 percent to 57 percent.Footnote34 Although we
cannot be certain about the causal relationship, it is worth noting that
the percentage of the Japanese public who support Japan's participation
in the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons decreased from 72
percent in 2020 and 71 percent in 2021 to 61 percent in 2022 and 2023
(surveyed in June and July each year).Footnote35

[nuclearization]{.mark} traditionally [include]{.mark} domestic [public
opinion]{.mark} and the country's post-World War II [pacifist
identity]{.mark}]{.underline}, with others also citing [[technical and
financial hurdles, as well as]{.mark} the [enormous diplomatic
costs]{.mark}]{.underline} that such an endeavor would have. While most
of [these arguments still ring true]{.underline}, Japan's nuclear
hedging posture has played an important role against nuclearization.

Conservative Japanese politicians have a history of mixed messages
regarding the indigenous nuclear option. These messages are intended for
different and overlapping audiences. [[Statements]{.mark} [about
the]{.mark} constitutional [right to]{.mark} [possess nu]{.mark}clear
weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline} exemplify such rhetoric and
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} partly [[aimed at keeping Japan's]{.mark}
regional [adversaries]{.mark}---especially China---[uncertain about
their]{.mark} neighbor's ultimate security
[intentions]{.mark}]{.underline}. At home, Japan is commonly viewed as a
nuclear threshold country, as it has significant latent capabilities due
to its highly advanced nuclear fuel cycle technologies.

[Japanese [officials]{.mark}]{.underline} have
[[use]{.underline}]{.mark}d [[the]{.mark} country's [refusal to develop
nu]{.mark}]{.underline}clear weapon[[s]{.mark}]{.underline} despite its
technological capabilities [[in two]{.underline}]{.mark} primary [[ways:
to reassure the public]{.mark} about the security of the nation, [while
maintaining its moral stance]{.mark}]{.underline} vis-à-vis global
peace. On some occasions, Japanese officials' allusions to a nuclear
option were directed to the United States and meant to test its
commitment to defend Japan. And pro-nuclear messages have also been
directed to the most conservative part of the Japanese public who find
inherent value in nuclear weapons, linking them to prestige and leverage
in international politics.

Although present throughout the postwar era, this ambiguous posture
flourished during the early years of Shinzo Abe's second tenure as prime
minister from 2012 to 2020. His decisively conservative figure sharply
contrasts with current Prime Minister Kishida's core values, a contrast
that also explains the recent containment of nuclear rhetoric in Japan.

Likewise, the resurgence of the nuclear option in South Korean security
discourse also caters to adversaries, the United States, and the most
conservative part of the domestic public. President Yoon acknowledged
the importance of strengthening his country's alliance with the United
States in the same breath as mentioning South Korea's possible
nuclearization. In short, he is using the playbook of past conservative
Japanese leaders.

[[Japan's nuclear hedging posture]{.underline}]{.mark}, which the
government uses to tailor its messaging to the different audiences, [[is
likely to remain]{.mark} in place. [It is hard to imagine Japan risking
this]{.mark} perfectly ambivalent [stance by seriously considering the
nuclear option]{.mark}]{.underline}---at least in the foreseeable
future.

golden age]{.mark}**\" [in]{.mark} its [relationship with Japan]{.mark}
as the two [countries recently discussed]{.mark} America\'s **[extended
deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[commonly known as the [nuclear
umbrella---amid China\'s military buildup]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark}
a State Department official told Newsweek. Newsweek has contacted the
Chinese defense and foreign ministries for comment by email. Why It
Matters [The [U.S. has **committed** to defending Japan through
**extended deterrence**]{.mark}, which refers to the pledge to [deter
and respond to nuclear and non-nuclear threats against allies and
partners,]{.mark} [including]{.mark}, if necessary, through the [**use**
of **nuc**]{.mark}**lear weapon[s]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Over 30
countries are protected by America\'s nuclear umbrella, a recent
Congressional Research Service (CRS) report stated. According to the
Pentagon, [[China]{.mark} continues its **rapid nuclear expansion** and
is estimated to [possess over **600 warheads** in its]{.mark} nuclear
[arsenal]{.mark}]{.underline}---[making it the third largest in the
world]{.underline}. The Chinese military has significantly expanded its
medium-range ballistic missile fleet, which is capable of striking Japan
as well as U.S. military bases located there. The Extended Deterrence
Dialogue was held from June 5-6 at Barksdale Air Force Base in
Louisiana, the U.S. State Department and the Japanese Foreign Ministry
said on Monday. The bilateral dialogue was hosted by the U.S. Air Force
Global Strike Command. The U.S. side was represented by officials from
the State Department and the Pentagon, while the Japanese delegation
included officials from Japan\'s foreign and defense ministries, as well
as the Japanese Embassy in Washington, D.C., according to the command.
Established in 2010, the [[bilateral discussion]{.mark} allows both
governments to **[address strategic deterrence]{.mark}**, including
nuclear and missile defense policy, Japan\'s foreign ministry
said.]{.underline} \"Our tailored dialogues with allies in the
Euro-Atlantic and Indo-Pacific have become deeper and broader,\" the
U.S. Air Force Global Strike Command told Newsweek, adding that these
efforts strengthen allied understanding of U.S. nuclear deterrence
posture and capabilities. This iteration, which was the first held under
the second Trump administration, included a visit to the U.S. Air Force
Global Strike Command\'s training facilities. Officially released photos
show the Japanese delegation taking a close look at America\'s B-52H
strategic bomber fleet. This iteration, which was the first held under
the second Trump administration, included a visit to the U.S. Air Force

at Francis E. Warren Air Force Base in Wyoming, where the Japanese
delegation visited the U.S. intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM)
mission. The base operates Minuteman III ICBMs on full alert around the
clock. What People Are Saying A U.S[. State Department

international environment alone. Our network of allies and partners in
the Euro-Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific is an asymmetric advantage that
our adversaries can never hope to match.\" What Happens Next? The U.S.
is also likely to enhance its extended deterrence to South
Korea---another treaty ally in Northeast Asia---in order to better
counter North Korea\'s nuclear and missile threats.

#### Japan isn't worried about US deterrence

**Romei, 2023** \[Sayuri, "Watching Ukraine, South Korea and Japan eye
nuclear weapons. Here's what the US should do," 20 July 2023,
https://thebulletin.org/2023/07/watching-ukraine-south-korea-and-japan-eye-nuclear-weapons-heres-what-the-us-should-do/\]

Strengthening extended deterrence in the Indo-Pacific. [[Contrary to
what some assert, Tokyo]{.mark} and Seoul [do not seem to have]{.mark}
growing suspicions or [concerns vis-à-vis US]{.mark} extended
[deterrence]{.mark}.]{.underline} Certainly, both allies fear that, in
the future, Americans might elect another US administration---like that
of former President Donald Trump---that would undermine alliances. But,
despite the surge in nuclear rhetoric in Seoul, South Korea knows that
boosting its alliance with the United States remains its best option.
[[The]{.mark} Japanese [government is]{.mark} also [more determined than
ever to strengthen]{.mark} extended deterrence mechanisms and [its
alliance with the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}.

The month of [[January 2023 was]{.mark} dubbed "[Japanuary]{.mark}" in
Washington, as [it saw a flurry of bilateral activities to bolster
the]{.mark} US-Japan [alliance]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Japan's foreign
and defense ministers]{.mark} both met with their US counterparts and
[confirmed an "unprecedented alignment]{.mark} of their vision,
priorities, and goals]{.underline}." The four officials also discussed
extended deterrence, which marks an encouraging first step toward
upgrading nuclear dialogue to the ministerial level.

The timing is also right for a regional upgrade of extended deterrence
discussions. In March, Washington approached both Tokyo and Seoul with
the idea of establishing a trilateral consultative body on nuclear
deterrence. The two allies seemed to tentatively welcome the proposal.
But, given their contrasting threat assessments and deterrence fluency,
one can expect there will be some reluctance in both governments and
challenges that the three countries will have to overcome. Regular
trilateral tabletop exercises will also be needed, with scenarios that
continue playing until after a nuclear attack is launched.

### Latent Deterrence Solves\-\--2AC

#### Japan doesn't need to actually develop nukes -- the threat alone is enough

**Fuhrmann, 2025** \[Matthew - Professor of Political Science at Texas
A&M University, "U.S. Allies and Adversaries Are Attempting Nuclear
Deterrence without Weapons --- Will It Work?" 7 April 2025,
https://warontherocks.com/2025/04/u-s-allies-and-adversaries-are-attempting-nuclear-deterrence-\]

[U.S. allies in East Asia are relatively well positioned for success.
[Japan meets both criteria: it has a large-scale fissile
material]{.mark} production [capability and a restrained nuclear
program. **Nobody thinks that Japan is racing to a bomb**]{.mark}
**today. [But everybody knows]{.mark} that [it
could]{.mark}**]{.underline} build one quickly following a political
decision, especially if it just wanted a single first-generation weapon.
The key question is whether the Trump administration would oppose or
welcome a Japanese bomb. President Donald Trump has endorsed Japan
getting its own nuclear weapons in the past. If this becomes U.S.
policy, deterrence by proliferation would completely lose its bite.

However, the United States is not the only relevant audience for Japan's
latent deterrent. [[Tokyo]{.mark} has]{.underline} tried to [[use its
nuclear latency to deter China and North Korea]{.underline}]{.mark}, in
addition to influencing the United States. Then-vice president Joe
[[Biden did]{.mark} this on Tokyo's behalf [too,
telling]{.mark}]{.underline} Chinese leader [[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark}
Jinping that [[Japan could build nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}
"[virtually overnight]{.mark}]{.underline}" if Beijing didn't help rein
in North Korea. [[Japanese officials]{.mark} have]{.underline}
increasingly [[embrace]{.mark}d]{.underline} the idea of [[latent
deterrence]{.mark} against adversaries.]{.underline} Former Defense
Minister Satoshi Morimoto said, for example, [that [Japan's nuclear
latency provides "very great defensive]{.mark} deterrent
[functions]{.mark}." Japan's prospects for success here are
strong]{.underline} --- maybe better than towards the United States, due
to questions about Washington's opposition to nuclear proliferation.

South Korea is in a less favorable position. Yet, it is one in which
latent deterrence could still be viable. Like Japan, South Korea has
been able to credibly signal nuclear restraint in recent decades. But
unlike [Japan]{.underline}, it does not [have large-scale enrichment or
reprocessing facilities]{.underline}. Seoul's activities in this area
have been limited to laboratory-scale work, and it does not presently
have the technology needed to make enough fissile material for one or
more bombs. Based on my analysis, laboratory-scale enrichment or
reprocessing activities can be helpful for bolstering a latent
deterrent, but they are not nearly as effective as having larger-scale
plants.

### Black Carbon Defense\-\--2AC

#### [Ships]{.underline} and [Russia]{.underline} makes black carbon is [inevitable]{.underline} or the [IMO solves]{.underline}.

Karen **McVeigh 22**. senior news reporter for the Guardian since
December 2006. "'Black carbon' threat to Arctic as sea routes open up
with global heating." Guardian. 4-1-2022.
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/apr/10/black-carbon-threat-to-arctic-as-sea-routes-open-up-with-global-heating

In February last year, [a **[Russian gas tanker]{.mark}**]{.underline},
Christophe de Margerie, [[made **history** by **navigating**]{.mark}
**the icy [waters]{.mark}** [of the]{.mark}]{.underline} [[northern
**sea route**]{.mark} **in mid-winter**]{.underline}. The [**pioneering
voyage**,]{.underline} from Jiangsu in China to a remote Arctic port in
Siberia, [was **heralded** as the [start of a **new era**]{.mark} that
could **reshape**]{.underline} global **[shipping routes]{.underline}**
-- cutting travel times between Europe and Asia by more than a third.

It has been made possible by the climate crisis. Shrinking polar ice has
allowed shipping traffic in the Arctic to rise 25% between 2013 and 2019
and the growth is expected to continue.

But Arctic shipping is not only made possible by the climate crisis, it
is adding to it too. [[More ships mean a **rise in**]{.mark} **exhaust
[fumes]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [which is [accelerating]{.mark} **ice
melt** in this **sensitive region**]{.underline} due to a complex
phenomenon [involving "**[black carbon]{.mark}**]{.underline}", an air
pollutant formed by the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels.

When black carbon, or soot, lands on snow and ice, it dramatically
speeds up melting. Dark snow and ice, by absorbing more energy, melts
far faster than heat-reflecting white snow, creating a vicious circle of
faster warming.

Environmentalists warn that the Arctic, which is warming four times
faster than the global average, has seen an 85% rise in black carbon
from ships between 2015 and 2019, mainly because of the increase in oil
tankers and bulk carriers.

The particles, which exacerbate respiratory and cardiovascular illness
in towns, are short-term but potent climate agents: they represent more
than 20% of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions from ships, according to
one estimate.

We're hitting this cascading tipping point for the climate ... we need
to do something about black carbon urgently

[Yet unlike other **transport sectors**]{.underline}, including road,
rail and inland waterways, [where **air-quality standards curb
emissions**]{.underline}, [no **regulations exist for
shipping**]{.underline}. Last November, [the]{.underline} International
Maritime Organization ([[IMO]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[adopted a
resolution on the use of]{.mark} [cleaner fuels in the **Arctic** to
**reduce black carbon**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[but left it as a
voluntary move]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Last week, [the [IMO]{.mark} was once again in the
**spotlight**]{.underline}. A [[coalition]{.mark} of **environmental
groups** [warned a meeting of its]{.mark}
[pollution]{.mark}]{.underline}, prevention [[and]{.mark} **response
[subcommittee]{.mark}** [that its **resolution** did **too
little**]{.mark} **to tackle the Arctic's**]{.underline} climate
**[crisis]{.underline}**. They submitted a paper calling on governments
to agree mandatory regulations to slash shipping's emissions of black
carbon in the region.

"We're hitting this cascading tipping point for the climate," said Dr
Lucy Gilliam, senior shipping policy officer of Seas at Risk. "With the
IPCC report, we are seeing again why we need to do something about black
carbon urgently."

Last Monday, scientists from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) warned it was "now or never" for action to stave off
climate breakdown. They concluded that the international community was
underperforming on climate commitments, but singled out the shipping
sector and the IMO for particular criticism.

The pollution from global shipping increased by 4.9% in 2021, according
to a report by the shipbrokers Simpson Spence Young.

"IMO member states must agree on ambitious and urgent global action to
dramatically reduce ship-source black carbon emissions this decade, in
order to mitigate the climate crisis in the Arctic," said Dr Sian Prior,
lead adviser to the Clean Arctic Alliance, a coalition of 21 non-profit
groups lobbying governments to protect Arctic wildlife and people. She
urged states and regions to do their part by acting immediately to cut
black carbon from ships.

If all shipping using heavy fuel oil in the Arctic switched to cleaner
distillate fuel, it would cut their black carbon emissions by 44%, the
Alliance said. Heavy fuel oil or bunker fuel is a viscous, low-grade,
cheap oil contaminated with substances including nitrogen and sulphur,
which make it more polluting than distillate.

If all ships also installed diesel particulate filters, which reduce
emissions by capturing and storing soot, black carbon could be cut by a
further 90%.

However, others argue that the IMO's 2021 ban on heavy fuel oils in the
Arctic -- a move aimed at reducing the risk of spillage and expected to
come into effect in 2029 -- will see a reduction in black carbon.

"The tide is swimming in the same direction already," said Paul
Blomerus, director of Clear Seas: Centre for Responsible Marine
Shipping, an independent research institute in Canada funded by industry
and government. "Many Canadian-flagged ships are moving towards
distillate fuels, ahead of the IMO ban, which will have the added effect
of reducing black carbon emissions.

"You could argue that the IMO only has a certain amount of bandwidth and
we should concentrate on decarbonisation and how to get to net zero by
2050."

He also noted [the [**major role** that **Russia played in**]{.mark}
**Arctic [shipping]{.mark}**]{.underline}. "[[Whether they would **abide
by the IMO's**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[**regulation** is **anyone's
guess**]{.mark} in the current circumstances]{.underline}," he said.

[Yet [Japan must]{.mark} also [consider]{.mark} what
**[nuc]{.mark}**learization would mean [vis-à-vis
**China**.]{.mark}]{.underline} The Sino-Japanese bilateral relationship
has been described as one of the world's most complex, in part due to
historical animosity.34 And while an attack is considered highly
unlikely, China's significant nuclear stockpile is of great concern to
Japan. As of today, [Japan's strategy centres around advocating for

China's regional dominance was also one of stated the objectives of the
Abe doctrine36, although the former Prime Minister would have been less

So [while I think Japan]{.underline} and South Korea [getting nukes
would reduce the risk of major conflict, there's one more issue to
consider: Where does it end?]{.underline} Every instance of nuclear
proliferation prompts other countries to think "Why not us, too?". [[If
Japan]{.underline}]{.mark} and South Korea [[get nukes, why not
Indonesia]{.mark}, Vietnam, and Malaysia? If]{.underline} Poland gets
nukes, why not Hungary, Armenia, or Azerbaijan? A world where every
country has nuclear weapons will almost certainly see them used at some
point, after which their use could become normalized.

[[What we need]{.mark} in order t[o prevent this is a strict
**internationally enforced** nuclear **nonprolif**]{.mark}eration
[regime]{.mark}. **[Right now]{.mark}, we don't have that;** [**China**
and **Russia** are happy to help **Iran** and **North Korea**]{.mark}
thrive under U.S. sanctions, allowing their **[nuclear
programs]{.mark}** to continue]{.underline}. [What we have right now is
a unilateral nonproliferation regime, where **[Chinese and Russian
allies get nukes]{.mark}**, and **[U.S. allies
don't]{.mark}.**]{.underline} This is kind of like trying to implement
gun control by giving up your guns and expecting your enemies to follow
suit.

[**[The only]{.mark}** global **nuclear [nonprolif]{.mark}**eration
[regime that will work is one that China and Russia]{.mark} both buy
into wholeheartedly and **[work to enforce]{.mark}**.]{.underline} And
**[[they will only do that if they see]{.mark} a threat of
[prolif]{.mark}eration [on the opposite side]{.mark} of the global
divide.]{.underline}** [[**Right now**, **China and Russia have no
incentive to enforce nonprolif**]{.mark}eration, [**because they know**
**U.S. allies will refrain**]{.mark} **from getting nukes** unilaterally
and voluntarily.]{.underline}

[[If **Japan**]{.underline}]{.mark} and South Korea [[**go nuclear**,
**this immediately changes**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [At that point, China
and Russia know that democratic countries are going to play by the same
rules they are, instead of a different, more restrictive set of
rules]{.underline}. [Which means China and Russia become just as worried
about nuclear proliferation as the U.S. and West Europe
are.]{.underline}

[[Australia, So]{.mark}uth [Ko]{.mark}rea [and Taiwan might go nuclear,
but not from]{.mark} fear of [Japan]{.mark}. **In fact, [Japan]{.mark}'s
going nuclear might [decrease]{.mark} the [probability of]{.mark} these
[countries going nuclear because they]{.mark} would [feel safer]{.mark}
with Japan's new nuclear check on China. [If they did go
nuclear]{.mark}, however, [they would be]{.mark} additional [bulwarks
against]{.mark} authoritarian [aggression]{.mark} in Asia [and]{.mark}
thereby [increase stability]{.mark} in the region**]{.underline}. They
are well-developed democracies that would maintain security procedures
such that nuclear weapons did not fall into the hands of extremists.
[[As responsible democracies]{.mark}, they can be counted on to only
maintain their nuclear deterrent for defensive purposes.]{.underline}
China shows little regard for human rights in its own country. One
Chinese general threatened hundreds of U.S. cities with destruction
through nuclear war. China is a territorially aggressive power. And as a
result, countries near and far are increasingly worried. Only by
matching China's nuclear weapons will Asian democracies be able to
defend themselves. Ringing China with nuclear democracies will force it
to focus on more productive pursuits than threats and the violent
acquisition of its neighbors' territory.

When engaging Russia, the US must present a strong deterrent while

sentiment can significantly shape strategy, often resulting in abrupt
shifts. [Maintaining consistency is crucial, especially as environmental
issues increasingly intersect with energy independence and national
security]{.underline}. Security remains central to US strategy, but
vulnerabilities exist due to military and infrastructure gaps. Russia's
aggressive Arctic buildup contrasts with the US's limited fleet and
infrastructure. The US relies on strengthening alliances, mainly through
NATO, which Sweden now reinforces and Finland's membership. Balancing
defense, diplomacy, and coalition-building is vital to safeguarding US
interests and Arctic stability. The US can shape the Arctic's future
through strategic investments and leadership, ensuring alignment between
national security[, environmental, and economic goals. Going forward,
the 2024 DoD Arctic Strategy implements essential initiatives of the
2022 Arctic Strategy. [It strengthens grand strategy by identifying the

PRC]{.underline}]{.mark}, the addition of Sweden and Finland to NATO and
climate change. To that end, it supports improved Arctic capabilities,
force readiness for high latitude operations, and deeper engagement with
Allies.61) Given adequate resources and a functioning joined-up
government, the DoD strategy will help maintain stability and security
in the Arctic.

#### Strong Sino-Russian relations cause war 

**Brands 25**, PhD History, Professor @ the Johns Hopkins University
School of Advanced International Studies. (Hal, 1-9-2025, \"The looming
Eurasian menace,\" The Washington Post, <https://archive.ph/C6mna>)

**[[China and Russia announced their "no limits" strategic
partnership]{.underline}]{.mark}** just before Moscow launched its
full-scale invasion of Ukraine. They mean, in Chinese President Xi
Jinping's words, [[to **revolutionize the international system**]{.mark}
by causing]{.underline} "[[changes the likes of which we haven't seen
for 100 years.]{.mark}" Since that invasion, Russia and North Korea have
sealed a formal military alliance]{.underline}; Russia and Iran have
built a stronger defense partnership in which technology, weapons and
know-how flow both ways. And since Oct. 7, 2023, [Russia has provided
targeting data and other assistance to the Houthis in Yemen, who have
also acquired missiles and other means of mayhem from
Tehran]{.underline}. Most of these relationships aren't new, but all
have grown rapidly in the hothouse global environment created by wars in
Ukraine and the Middle East. To be sure, there is no overarching
multilateral alliance --- no autocrats' NATO. Mistrust among the
illiberal powers remains pervasive. But their relationships constitute a
cohering network of ties among states that are determined to wreck Pax
Americana and command some of the most valuable strategic real estate on
Earth. Western observers play down the autocrats' pacts at their peril,
because some of history's greatest cataclysms have been caused by
dysfunctional --- yet profoundly destructive --- alliances. Nazi
Germany, Fascist Italy and Imperial Japan never could have coexisted in
the long run. But before World War II, their cooperation delivered
devastating multiplier effects by destabilizing governments on several
fronts at once. During the early Cold War, a wary alliance between
Moscow and Beijing intensified the threats facing the free world. And
whether the new autocratic pacts are love matches or marriages of
convenience, they are having serious strategic effects. (Juanjo Gasull
for The Washington Post) For one thing, these relationships encourage
aggression by reducing its costs: A heavily sanctioned Russia has been
able to continue its war in Ukraine thanks to the missiles, artillery
shells, drones and troops it has received from Tehran and Pyongyang, and
the economic succor it has gotten from Beijing. Likewise, the pacts
increase the danger of war on some fronts by pacifying others: Putin can
go all-out against Ukraine because he faces no threat from China, just
as Xi can be bolder in the Pacific because he has a friendly Russia at
his back. An autocratic peace within Eurasia encourages violent meddling
around its margins. Autocratic relationships also weaken Western
pressure on individual regimes: Russia now shields Pyongyang from
sanctions, while Tehran and Moscow develop illicit trade networks beyond
U.S. reach. [[These relationships divide U.S. attention by creating
trouble in several places]{.mark} at once]{.underline}. Witness
Washington's agonizing debates over aid for Ukraine vs. [support for
Taiwan](https://archive.ph/o/C6mna/https:/www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/05/18/taiwan-ukraine-support-russia-china/),
over [hammering the
Houthis](https://archive.ph/o/C6mna/https:/www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/01/16/red-sea-houthis-supply-chain-disruption/)
vs. husbanding missiles for a war with China. Perhaps most
fundamentally, autocratic ties are shifting the military balance.
Beijing's record-breaking buildup has long involved purchases of Russian
planes, missiles and air defenses. And [**[Sino-Russian defense
cooperation is only getting deeper]{.mark}** and more secretive as the
[two countries work together to build submarines, helicopters and other
key capabilities]{.mark}.]{.underline} Across Eurasia, in fact,
transnational production networks are emerging: Iranian-origin drones
are being built in Russian defense plants, where North Korean workers
reportedly labor. The autocratic arms trade is burgeoning, as Russia
promises to sell state-of-the-art aircraft, air defenses and other
advanced capabilities to its partners. Disruptive military innovation is
accelerating, as North Korea receives Russian technology and know-how
for its missile and satellite programs. These countries' militaries are
also learning from one another: Iran's [missile and drone
attack](https://archive.ph/o/C6mna/https:/mwi.westpoint.edu/what-irans-drone-attack-portends-for-the-future-of-warfare/)
against Israel in April looked suspiciously similar to Russia's previous
strikes against Ukraine. If the United States once served as the arsenal
of democracy, a modern-day arsenal of autocracy is now taking shape.
Russia, Iran, China and North Korea have already managed more
defense-technological collaboration than [the Axis
powers](https://archive.ph/o/C6mna/https:/www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/axis-powers-world-war-ii)
of the World War II era ever did. Even if they never come together in a
full-fledged military alliance, they could still deepen their
cooperation in dangerous ways. For example, they could collaborate on
more sensitive projects: Russia could support North Korea's rapidly
improving nuclear program or give Beijing its most advanced
submarine-quieting technology. Putin could give the Houthis anti-ship
cruise missiles to make their attacks more lethal. [[Russia and China
could swap]{.mark} [insights on how to use nuclear threats to keep the
United States from interfering as they]{.mark} coerce or [attack their
neighbors]{.mark} --- precisely what Putin has done in
Ukraine]{.underline}. Or perhaps [[these countries could find **more
dramatic ways to cooperate** in]{.mark} crisis or [conflict]{.mark}.
[China and Russia are]{.mark} [already conducting military drills in
potential conflict zones]{.mark} from the Baltic Sea to the Western
Pacific, [signaling]{.mark} [that **one illiberal power won't sit on the
sidelines as Washington fights another**]{.mark}. Russia could aid China
in a future conflict against the United States]{.underline} by
conducting cyberattacks that make it harder for America to mobilize. Or
Putin could menace Europe by posturing his forces there while the
Pentagon is preoccupied with a crisis in Asia. If any of this seems
unlikely, just remember that [[Western observers have repeatedly been
surprised]{.mark}, even shocked, [by how far these relationships have
already come]{.mark}.]{.underline} Meanwhile, closer ties among U.S.
adversaries raise the odds that a war that starts in one place will
spill into others. Recall that World War II began not as a global
conflict but as a set of regional crises that gradually intensified and
became inseparable --- just as the United States' Eurasian crises are
becoming sharper, and more interwoven, today. [The [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [is still struggling to adapt to this situation.
Washington continues to see the world as being divided]{.mark} [into
separate regions]{.mark}. This assumption is dangerously outdated. As
the Eurasian axis coheres, individual crises take on global meaning. It
might be fashionable to talk about pivoting away from Europe to focus on
China]{.underline}. But one reason it would be so damaging if America
abandons Ukraine, and Russia defeats it, is that this would be a victory
for the larger autocratic coalition in its showdown with the democratic
world.

Arctic to greater resource exploitation and shipping, animosity in the
North will further threaten this fragile ecosystem. This paper proposes
a return to the founding ethos of cooperation through science diplomacy
to rebuild strained relationships and prevent further fracturing of the
Arctic Council.

1\. Introduction

Since 1996, the Arctic Council has served as the conduit through which
Arctic issues are largely handled. While the Council\'s focus lies in
environmental protection and sustainable development, the dialogue that
it has facilitated between the Arctic States has contributed to ongoing
peaceful relations in the region during the post-Cold War period. Even
as East-West tensions rose during the Crimea conflict in 2014 and the
Syrian civil war, the Arctic States continued to collaborate on research
projects and efforts to create regulations and standards on fishing,
shipping, and other key issues. Indeed, the Council's success at
facilitating peaceful dialogue has earned it multiple nominations for a
Nobel Peace Prize, most recently in February 2022.

Shortly after that nomination, a crisis far from the Arctic threatened
the future of the Arctic Council. When Russia invaded Ukraine in
February 2022, the seven remaining Arctic States announced an immediate
pause of all Arctic Council work. Months passed with only limited
operations.1 The spillover of the Ukraine war to the Arctic has raised
several urgent questions regarding the future of the Arctic Council and
Arctic governance in general. It remains unclear when, or even if,
relations can resume normally after this most recent crisis, as Senior
Arctic Officials and others take stock of the situation and assess the
best path forward. Even before February 2022, tension between Arctic and
non-Arctic States had been building as the latter sought greater
influence over Arctic policy-making. Now, the strained geopolitical
environment along with ecological stressors put into strong relief
weaknesses of the Arctic Council that limit its ability to maintain
peace, manage emerging industries and satisfy demands for more inclusive
Arctic governance.

The Council's future is precarious; its absence would leave a
significant void, with far reaching consequences for Northern
inhabitants, and the regional and global environment. This paper will
contend that, to move forward, the Arctic States and other stakeholders
need to return to the core principles of the Arctic Council and its
predecessor - the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy - to rebuild
trust and cooperation. Science diplomacy could serve as the catalyst to
bring the Arctic States together again, with a shared goal of increasing
knowledge of Arctic systems and species, and protecting this fragile
environment before intensifying stressors cause irreparable damage to
the region.

2\. History of the Arctic Council: science, diplomacy and cooperation

Since the end of the Cold War, narratives of the Arctic have highlighted
"Arctic exceptionalism". Despite armed conflicts, rising tensions and
jockeying for political and economic power prevalent in other areas of
the globe, the Arctic remained largely unaffected. This vision of a
peaceful Arctic is relatively new. During the Cold War, military
alliances carved up the Arctic, with security infrastructure
strategically placed in the territories of coastal Arctic States.
Demilitarization and interstate cooperation were unthinkable. Apart from
the collaborative success of the 1973 Agreement on the Conservation of
Polar Bears, "the members of the two alliance systems stared warily
across the pole at one another and saw only adversaries rather than
potential partners."2; Mistrust between the Arctic States, especially
the United States and the Soviet Union, pervaded Arctic politics.

When former President of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev came to
power in 1985, he sought to establish a détente with the West. In 1987,
as NATO States were building up their military infrastructure in the
Arctic, he delivered a pivotal speech in Murmansk, where he declared,
"Let the North of the globe, the Arctic, become a zone of peace".3 He
noted that "scientific exploration of the Arctic is of immense
importance for the whole of mankind", and called on Arctic States to
come together to create a plan to protect Arctic lands and waters.
Gorbachev hoped to expand collaborative research efforts and knowledge
sharing by building on the scientific exchange already occurring between
Russia and Canada.4 Gorbachev's speech was the initial step towards
abandoning entrenched Cold War suspicion-based policies to advance
regional governance in the Arctic. Two years later, on a formal visit to
the Soviet Union, former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney
celebrated the success of the Canadian-Soviet research partnership and
expressed hope that "this nascent multilateral environmental and
scientific cooperation become more broadly based to cover the full range
of economic and social issues,"5; demonstrating how science diplomacy
could lead to work in wider areas of mutual benefit.

During this time, Finland also raised concerns about air, water and soil
pollution originating from the Soviet Union. The 1986 Chernobyl disaster
reaffirmed these fears and brought the Arctic States together to address
transboundary pollution and contamination in the North. Efforts to
establish an environmental monitoring regime for the Arctic began in
1989, culminating in the 1991 Ministerial Declaration in Rovaniemi,
Finland, which created the Arctic Environmental Protection Strategy
(AEPS).6 However, Canada, following on Mulroney's Leningrad speech,
lobbied the Arctic States to create an Arctic organization that would go
beyond science and knowledge exchange to address economic concerns and
demilitarization of the Arctic. Canada sought an organization that would
have an autonomous chair, secretariat, and budget. Despite the end of
the Cold War, the United States pushed back against Canada's proposal
which ran counter to its military-oriented approach to the Arctic.7
Having just agreed to the AEPS, the American government saw no benefit
in another Arctic organization, with a permanent headquarters and staff
and a wider mandate beyond scientific research. In the end, significant
concessions were made to ensure American involvement in the Arctic
Council.

The resulting Arctic Council differed greatly from Canada's original
vision. The Council arose not from a treaty but rather a Ministerial
Declaration signed in Ottawa - the Ottawa Declaration - on September 19,
1996.8 As a "high level forum" designed to further "cooperation,
coordination and interaction among Arctic States",9 the Council may not
issue binding regulations. This format fit with the American idea that
the Council would periodically meet to share ideas, but not issue formal
decisions.10 Most notably, the Ottawa Declaration specifically states
that "\[t\]he Arctic Council should not deal with matters related to
military security."11; Consequently, the Council engages exclusively in
soft power issues tied to environmental protection and sustainable
development.12 Critically, science continued to be the unifying core of
the Arctic Council's existence.

The Council's inability to propose more than non-binding recommendations
in fact boosted its capacity to successfully influence the creation of
international law. Its less formal setting allowed a variety of
stakeholders to convene, without the constraints of high-level
diplomacy, to delve into topics of common concern and "hammer out the
terms of agreements".13 By channeling its efforts into cooperative
projects to produce high caliber environmental assessments, the Council
could alert the global community to emerging issues and thus initiate
policy action. Indeed, its production of quality scientific reports is
widely viewed as its most effective work.14 Over the past decade, as the
Council highlighted the challenges facing a rapidly changing Arctic, it
has been instrumental in furthering policies to regulate activities in
the marine environment. The Nuuk Declaration from the Seventh
Ministerial Meeting of the Arctic Council in May 2011 celebrated the
first legally binding agreement "under the auspices" of the Arctic
Council - the Agreement on Cooperation in Aeronautical and Maritime
Search and Rescue in the Arctic (Arctic SAR Agreement).15 In addition,
the Arctic Council played a central role in the 2013 Agreement on Arctic
Marine Oil Pollution Preparedness and Response, while the Protection of
the Arctic Marine Environment (PAME) Working Group's 2009 Arctic Marine
Shipping Assessment contributed to the creation of the International
Maritime Organization's 2017 International Code for Ships Operating in
Polar Waters (Polar Code).16 Thus, though the Arctic Council possesses
limited authority, over the course of its existence, this
consensus-based organization has evolved to become the preeminent actor
in Arctic issues and demonstrated its ability to influence Arctic
governance on a grand scale.

3\. The temporary suspension of Arctic Council operations

Since the inception of the Arctic Council, the Arctic states have
succeeded in separating global tensions from Arctic affairs to maintain
peace and cooperation in the North.17 Even following the 2014 Crimea
Crisis and Syria's civil war, as relations between Russia and the other
Arctic States disintegrated, Arctic cooperation not only continued
unaffected, but the Arctic States were able to come together to create
an unprecedented precautionary-based agreement with the 2018 Central
Arctic Ocean Fisheries Agreement. Still, Arctic Council insiders warned
that tense relations between Russia and the United States, as well as
distrust between Arctic and non-Arctic States, could erode the Arctic
Council\'s effectiveness.18 In 2019, for the first time, the Arctic
States failed to issue a Ministerial Declaration due to the United
States' refusal under former President Donald Trump's Presidency to
permit the term "climate change" in the final document.19 The day before
the Ministerial Meeting, former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called
out China for its "words and actions" and criticized Russia for its
"aggressive behaviour" in the Arctic.20 Given the timing and venue of
Pompeo's speech, it seemed inevitable that Arctic and non-Arctic States
could no longer compartmentalize the work of the Council as they strive
to assert dominance in wider political and economic spheres.

Despite the growing tension, at the beginning of February 2022, members
of Norway's Parliament nominated the Arctic Council for the Nobel Peace
Prize. Member of Parliament Bård Ludvig Thorheim stated,

We believe \[the Arctic Council's\] cooperation is exceptional in
international politics and demonstrates the need for cooperation and
trust between countries in a time where peace is threatened around
Ukraine and other regions.21

Weeks later, Russia invaded Ukraine, an act which violated Article 2(4)
of the UN Charter, prohibiting Members States from "the threat or use of
force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any
State."22; In response to this breach of international law, the
remaining Arctic Council Member States issued a joint declaration to
announce that they would temporarily pause "participation in all
meetings of the Council and its subsidiary bodies",23, 25 affecting 128
ongoing projects involving scientific cooperation and outreach.24 They
further stated,

We remain convinced of the enduring value of the Arctic Council for
circumpolar cooperation and reiterate our support for this institution
and its work.

We hold a responsibility to the people of the Arctic, including the
indigenous peoples of the Arctic, who contribute to and benefit from the
important work undertaken in the Council.25

The Ukraine war demonstrated how "interconnected, interdependent, and
inherently linked the peoples, governments, resources, and landscapes of
Arctic nations are with others around the globe."26 With the pause in
Council operations, the era of "Arctic exceptionalism" passed.

The future of the Arctic Council now hangs in the balance. The ongoing
Ukraine war has triggered renewed military posturing in the Arctic
Ocean, further souring relations between the Member States.27 In May
2022 Senior Arctic Officials (SAOs) continued to search for solutions to
the two month pause, a situation complicated by Russia holding the
Chairmanship. By June 2022 the Arctic seven announced that they would
"implement a limited resumption of \[their\] work in the Arctic Council
on projects that do not involve the participation of the Russian
Federation" and would "continue to examine additional modalities to
allow \[them\] to further continue the council's important work."28;
Meanwhile, academics likewise explored whether the remaining seven
Member States could establish a new Arctic organization to address
cooperation in the region without Russia.29 The American coordinator for
the Arctic region, James P. Deltart, of the US State Department rejected
that option stating,

Creating an alternative structure to the Arctic Council is not on our
agenda. We believe the Council holds the greatest value as a circumpolar
forum including all the eight Arctic states and binding together the
people who live throughout the entire region.30

Senior Arctic Officials remain wary of making rash decisions which may
prevent a future return to normalcy in the Arctic Council. To abandon
the Arctic Council altogether would permanently isolate Russia, an
imprudent move given that Russia is, from "a variety of biophysical and
socioeconomic perspectives \[...\], the preeminent Arctic State."31; A
new regional Arctic body that does not include Russia would lack scope
and breadth, threatening its ability to fulfill its goals or objectives.

Furthermore, China made clear in October 2022 that it would not
acknowledge an Arctic Council that does not include Russia.32 At the
time, the Chinese Special Envoy to the Arctic, Feng Gao, stated at the
Arctic Circle Assembly that,

The Arctic Council is based on a declaration and there is no procedure
for leaving the Council. I doubt that the Chairmanship can be
transferred to anyone or that Norway can take over the Chair without
Russia from a legal point of view.33

If the remaining seven Member States go forward with a different
institution, it is unclear whether China would recognize its
legitimacy.34 China may also decline to participate as an Observer in
the Arctic Council if Russia is barred from meetings and collaborative
research projects. At the same time, it appreciates that it must not
adversely affect its relationships with the other Arctic Council Member
States.35 Given that China is proving itself a significant and
formidable player in the Arctic, its absence from the Arctic Council, or
a new regional forum without Russia, could undermine efforts to address
Arctic shipping, fishing, and other economic and environmental concerns.
China may see this current crisis as an opportunity to double down on
its efforts to open governance to the international community and
increase its influence.

On May 11, 2023 Norway assumed Chairship36 of the Arctic Council
following a sparsely-attended ceremony which took place both in
Salekhard, Russia and online. Though the Meeting ran relatively smoothly
following months of negotiations between Russia and Norway, it was the
first instance that the transfer of Chair was not through a
"Ministerial" meeting.37 When Norway took over as Chair, the
long-present note on the Arctic Council's website which read, "The
Arctic Council is pausing all official meetings of the Council and its
subsidiary bodies until further notice" was removed.38 However, at the
time of writing, political meetings at the high level cannot take place,
nor are SAO meetings planned for the immediate future.39 Norway has a
difficult task ahead, attempting to bring the Arctic States together and
working towards the goal of a fully functioning Arctic Council. On the
surface, all Arctic States assert that they wish to keep the Arctic as a
"territory of peace, stability and mutually beneficial cooperation to
ensure its sustainable and safe development", as voiced by the Russian
Ministry of Foreign Affairs,40 but mistrust and suspicion remain
pervasive, driving a wedge between the Member States as well as between
the Observers.

Arctic Member States have stated their commitment to the Arctic Council,
and Norway, as the new Chair, is engaging in talks with all Members and
Working Groups to restore the Council by the end of its term, its
[future is still tenuous]{.underline}. The [[loss of this forum]{.mark}
[would]{.mark} further [complicate relations in]{.mark} other realms,
particularly [security]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Russia feels threatened by
Finland's acceptance into NATO]{.underline}, [creating a new 1340 km
Finnish NATO border, while the remaining Arctic Member States warily eye
Russia's Arctic military build up, raising the risk of regionalized
conflict]{.underline}.41 While military issues are not the remit of the
Arctic Council, the opportunities afforded by cooperative work within
the Council allowed Arctic States to engage in constructive dialogue
that could address disagreements or misunderstandings. The [current
[situation]{.mark} [is further aggravated]{.mark}]{.underline} [[by the
collapse of bilateral agreements]{.underline}]{.mark} since the start of
the Ukraine war and the Council shutdown. Russia, for instance,
announced its termination of the bilateral agreement it has had with
Finland since 2000 to engage in yearly extra military evaluation visits,
demonstrating "yet another trust-building measure in the military field"
that has dissolved.42 Similarly, Russia withdrew from the Barents
Euro-Arctic Council in September 2023, placing the responsibility for
the end to cooperation on the Western Members of the Council, stating
that "\[t\]hrough the fault of the Western Members, the Council's
activities have been effectively paralyzed since March 2022\" \[5\]. The
Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated at the time, "Russia will
continue to pursue its national objectives in the north. [We remain open
to cooperation]{.underline} [with anyone who is committed to
constructive engagement and is prepared for equal dialogue and mutually
beneficial collaborative work]{.underline}."43

[[Russia]{.underline}, [feeling isolated]{.underline}]{.mark} [[from the
Arctic Council]{.underline}]{.mark} since March 2022, has actively
[[sought new]{.mark} partners, specifically [non-Western]{.mark} and
non-Arctic [partners]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} with which it can
work in the Arctic. Nikolay Korchunov, the Russian Arctic Ambassador,
has stated that Russia's

line in the Arctic Council will depend on the situation's further
development and respect for Russian interests. With the Council's
weakened role and effectiveness, provoked by our Western partners, [we
are already engaged in active dialogue with an Arctic agenda in various
formats with other countries and organizations."44]{.underline}

During the remainder of Russia's Chairmanship, when the remaining Arctic
States declined to participate in projects involving Russia, it
continued to carry out a number of events in line with its agenda with
what it called "friendly countries" - China, Brazil, Mongolia, Belarus
and Kazakhstan.45 [This [growing division]{.mark} into
camps]{.underline} [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} clearly
[[disconcerting]{.mark} and]{.underline}, [should it
continue]{.underline}, [will prove counterproductive as Arctic and
non-Arctic States strive to address Northern issues.]{.underline}

Russia's Arctic Ambassador has clarified that Russia has no intention of
creating an alternate forum to the Arctic Council, but his comments
similarly suggest that it will remain in the Council only as long as it
serves Russia's interests and respects its right to participate in
Arctic Council meetings and work.46 Still, [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}
has [[lamented that]{.mark} the [collapse]{.mark}]{.underline} [[in
relations]{.underline}]{.mark} has [[resulted]{.underline} [in little
activity]{.underline}]{.mark} [[by]{.underline}]{.mark}
[the]{.underline} Arctic Council's Working Group on
[[Conservation]{.mark} of Arctic Flora and Fauna]{.underline}
[[during]{.underline}]{.mark} [a time in which]{.underline} growing
economic activity in the North along with [[climate change]{.mark} are
resulting in increased pressure on]{.underline} Arctic species and
[ecosystems]{.underline}.47 [[This concern **could serve as a jumping
off point**]{.underline} **[for rebuilding
relations]{.underline}**]{.mark} [between the Arctic States in
particular]{.underline}. In September 2023, the Arctic States approved
new guidelines so that its Working Groups could return to existing
projects and propose new projects.48 Morten Høglund, Norway's Arctic
ambassador and the Chair of the Senior Arctic Officials under the
Norwegian Chairship, believes that returning to the levels of
collaboration prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine will necessitate
"a lot of time", Norway aims to "resume large parts of \[Arctic
Council\] work in several important fields, such as climate, and start
new projects."49

The [question]{.underline} [remains to what extent]{.underline} the
[Arctic seven are open to trust Russia]{.underline} at this time. Kal
Kornhuber et al. argue that, "\[r\]esuming key elements of critically
needed scientific and political cooperation is dependent on the end of
Russian aggression against Ukraine."50; Indeed, the Russian State's
readiness to violate international law and escalate conflicts, signals
that disagreements with Russia "must now be viewed in a new light."51;
However, for Ambassador Høglund, "functioning cooperation between all
Arctic countries is important" and "\[t\]he best answer to possible
challenges with such cooperation is that we hold on to the Arctic
Council as the most important forum for Arctic issues."52; [With
military activity steadily rising in the north53 and alliances
crumbling]{.underline}, [a situation reminiscent of the Cold
War]{.underline}, [[soft power outlets are needed more than
ever]{.mark}. While the Russian invasion of Ukraine has broken
trust,]{.underline} [[an Arctic Council without participation of Russia
would be **severely impaired**]{.underline}]{.mark}; [the [global
community would likely have real doubts about its
legitimacy]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [[Rebuilding]{.underline}
[that trust]{.underline}]{.mark} [[is critical as the Arctic
experiences]{.mark} rising ecological, [economic and geopolitical
stressors associated with accelerated warming;]{.mark}]{.underline}
[principally focusing on common environmental challenges, through the
[resumption of scientific collaboration with Russia, could serve as that
first key goodwill step.]{.mark}]{.underline}

However, [Moscow]{.underline}'s military posture in the Arctic has not
changed in the context of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and it
r[emains bent on obsessive control over the AZRF and countering NATO
activity.]{.underline} Russia's vast multi-layered network of
Arctic-capable air and coastal defence systems has stayed in place along
the AZRF and has not been tremendously impacted by the war against
Ukraine.

In this context -- and judging by the sense of conventional
vulnerability fuelling Russia's Arctic insecurities -- [there is a risk
that Moscow could engage in more overt nuclear sabre-rattling and
escalatory behaviour]{.underline}. There remains an outside chance that
[Russia could resume nuclear weapons testing on the islands of Novaya
Zemlya]{.underline}. [This situation is compounded by the inherent risk
of miscalculation provoked by accidents, incidents and tactical errors,
left unchecked by the current absence of lines of
communication]{.underline}.

Meanwhile, the [**fragmentation of circumpolar cooperation** is
**closing doors on diplomatic activity** that could help to **diffuse
tensions** and promote confidence-building]{.underline} measures. Prior
to 2022, there was some discussion of re-establishing joint military
forums or some form of 'code of conduct', but this dissipated quickly as
Moscow's designs on Ukraine became clear. [The chances of a predictable
Arctic in military security terms are growing slimmer]{.underline}.

[The risk of an armed conflict in the Arctic is clearly higher than it
was]{.underline}. However, this does not mean that either NATO or Moscow
is any more likely to seek a conflict in the Arctic than they were prior
to Russia's assault on Ukraine. Considering the complexity of the
operating environment, there is little incentive for Moscow -- or NATO
-- to escalate in the Arctic per se, let alone conduct high-intensity
warfare operations there.

There is no sign yet (publicly at least) that either side is seeking to
change the 'facts on the ground' regarding critical international
agreements, or even press claims in areas of disagreement -- for
instance, over how to interpret the Svalbard Treaty on the UN Convention
on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) as it applies to the Northeast Passage
(including the Northern Sea Route, or NSR) and the delimitation of
extended continental shelves.

Nevertheless, [Russia remains determined to control 'its' Arctic and the
NSR]{.underline}. Over the past few years, successive waves of
regulations have increasingly restricted passage through the NSR,
placing it under Moscow's tight control. If, even as the effects of
climate change are felt, Russia maintains its dubious interpretation of
the status of the NSR, or if the Kremlin seeks to further restrict
passage along the route (especially for foreign military vessels[),
there could be more serious consideration of a US- or NATO-led Freedom
of Navigation operation, even if it increases the risk of an armed
clash]{.underline}.

These issues are all the more critical in the context of the renewed US
interest in Arctic affairs as part of the 2022 National Strategy for the
Arctic Region (NSAR) and its 2023 Implementation Plan. Indeed, the NSAR
is quite clear regarding protecting freedom of navigation across the
Arctic region in accordance with UNCLOS.

For now, [the most likely scenario is that we will continue to see a
balancing and counterbalancing of NATO and Russian forces in the High
North]{.underline} as both sides adjust to the realities of Swedish and
Finnish membership of NATO. The danger is that [this could increase the
risk of a miscalculation provoked by an accident escalating into
something worse]{.underline}. [More presence and platforms in a changing
Arctic will undoubtedly bring about more incidents, including
environmental catastrophes and human-made disasters]{.underline}, with
indigenous peoples and other local communities bearing the brunt of the
impact.

#### Lack of cooperation [risks]{.underline} nuclear accidents in the [Arctic]{.underline}. 

Maxim **Starchak**, 20**24** -- expert on Russian nuclear policy,
strategic weapons, arms control, and defence and nuclear industry, as
well as a fellow at the Centre for International and Defence Policy of
the Queen's University (Canada). "Russia's Arctic Policy Poses a Growing
Nuclear Threat" Carnegie Politika, 11/1,

//DH

The war in Ukraine continues to drain Russia's resources away from
critical areas, including nuclear security in the Arctic. Despite this,
Moscow remains committed to the development of this strategic region,
and has not stopped building nuclear sites there. In September, [Norway
detected elevated levels of radioactive Cesium-137 near its Arctic
border with Russia]{.underline}. As [Russia is no longer cooperating
with other nations on nuclear safety in the Arctic]{.underline}, this is
unlikely to be the last such report.

Around the same time that Norway reported the surge in radiation levels,
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov accused NATO of militarizing the
Arctic through increasingly frequent crisis response exercises. Yet
Russia is guilty of the same. Its new foreign policy concepts and
doctrines call the Arctic "a vital area for ensuring our national
interests in the global ocean," and Moscow has warned that it will use
"any means necessary" to secure its interests there. Those means include
the Northern Fleet, whose ships regularly---and conspicuously---traverse
the Arctic Ocean, training to counter Western submarines.

Particularly crucial to [Russia's]{.underline} plans is its [fleet of
nuclear submarines]{.underline}, which [has become significantly more
active in northern waters in the past decade]{.underline}. The fleet
consists of twelve strategic nuclear submarines carrying up to 192
nuclear-capable ballistic missiles, twenty-four nuclear submarines armed
with cruise missiles, and ten special-purpose nuclear submarines, with
another twelve nuclear submarines under construction or nearly ready for
commission.

[The Arctic is also a testing ground for new nuclear-powered,
nuclear-armed weapons---from the Burevestnik cruise missile to the
Poseidon torpedo---contributing to both regional tensions and the risk
of radiation accidents]{.underline}.

[That risk is growing, not only because of Russia's military activities,
but also because of its increasing economic activity in the Arctic.
Rosatom,]{.underline} the state nuclear company, [operates the
eight-ship nuclear icebreaker fleet]{.underline} that is key to the
Northern Sea Route, along which 36 million tons of cargo were
transported in 2023, up from 4 million in 2014. That number is expected
to reach 270 million tons in 2035, while the nuclear icebreaker fleet is
to expand by seven more vessels.

[Rosatom's footprint in the Arctic extends to Russia's two nuclear power
plants there: Kola and Bilibino.]{.underline} They do not generate
enough energy for the country's Arctic development needs (the region
contains trillions of cubic meters of natural gas and billions of tons
of oil), for which Rosatom estimates that no fewer than fifteen floating
nuclear power plants are required. The company separately plans to build
several small modular reactors (SMRs), the first of which should be up
and running by 2028.

In the past five years, [Russia's development of the Arctic has seen the
number of civil and military nuclear reactors in the region increase by
30 percen]{.underline}t, from sixty-two to eighty-one. By 2035, it is
estimated there may be 118.

In response to growing concerns about nuclear safety, Rosatom has
offered reassurances on SMRs' passive safety systems. But
environmentalists stress that [SMRs are experimental, and]{.underline}
therefore [high-risk]{.underline}. Of particular concern is how they
will be transported. It has already been reported that [ships not
designed to transport nuclear materials have been used to do just
that,]{.underline} and further nuclear safety violations cannot be ruled
out. In addition, a 2022 study found that SMRs produce more radioactive
waste than conventional nuclear power plants.

[The Arctic's radiation risks are]{.underline} therefore only
[rising]{.underline}. The situation was far from ideal to begin with,
thanks to the region's rich Soviet nuclear inheritance. [There
are]{.underline} some [18,000 sunken assets that]{.underline} were or
[remain dangerously radioactive]{.underline}, a thousand of which
continue to pose a threat. [They include submarines, reactors, and
high-level waste]{.underline}. In addition, the Russian Arctic is
peppered with facilities for storing nuclear fuel---fresh and spent
alike---and refining it.

[Ensuring the safety of new nuclear assets and managing the Soviet
nuclear inheritance is difficult and expensive, and an endeavor in which
Russia used to work closely with foreign partners]{.underline}. It was
not uncommon for projects to be 50 percent or even 60 percent foreign
funded, and some were wholly financed from abroad. The Bellona
Foundation estimates that Russia received some \$2.5 billion in
international assistance in this area, in addition to all the political,
technological, informational, and other support from which it benefited.

[Years of international cooperation on nuclear security ended with the
invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}. Russia was cut off from foreign
funding, not only bilaterally but also through EU and European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development programs. [Technical assistance dried up
as well, precluding the maintenance of foreign equipment and halting the
supply of spare parts]{.underline}.

Institutions also stopped working together, with Russia leaving the
Barents Euro-Arctic Council and being suspended from the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development's Nuclear Energy Agency. The
European Technical Safety Organisations Network cut ties with Russia's
Scientific and Engineering Center for Nuclear and Radiation Safety.

Crucially[, it has become more difficult for Russia to respond promptly
to nuclear emergencies. The Arctic is marked by extreme weather
conditions, huge distances, and poor infrastructure]{.underline}.
Notifying partners of a nuclear incident as soon as possible is of the
utmost importance, so that complicated interagency and international
coordination may commence. Yet Russia is out of the Norwegian-led Arctic
and North Atlantic Security and Emergency Preparedness Network and is no
longer invited to nuclear incident response exercises, even as an
observer.

As the 2000 Kursk submarine disaster made painfully clear, Russia was
never inclined to accept outside assistance in nuclear emergencies.
However, cooperation with partners was at least theoretically possible.
Now, [any prospect of a regional agreement on nuclear security in the
Arctic establishing a joint emergency response mechanism is as good as
dead]{.underline}.

Rosatom admits that Russia being cut off from foreign funding means
projects related to nuclear safety in the Arctic will stall. Yet it
maintains that they will not be canceled altogether, which would seem
plausible given the company's financials.

However, in practice, funding is being cut, and the results are clear.
Hitherto largely financed by Norway, [efforts to remove solid
radioactive waste from Andreyeva Bay may be suspended
indefinitely]{.underline}, Bellona experts fear.

Rosatom's accounts show that nuclear safety is not a priority. Federal
spending on nuclear and radiation safety has steadily been falling since
about 2020, and is expected to be cut by a further 1.5 billion rubles
between 2024 and 2026. Cuts of 2.3 billion rubles are planned for
efforts related to radioactive waste disposal and management and the
cleanup of nuclear legacy sites. At the same time, tariffs for the
disposal of radioactive waste are to increase by an average of 33
percent by 2027.

The opacity of the Russian state does not help matters. Gone are the
days when many projects were implemented with the involvement of NGOs,
and Rosatom's disclosures offer so little information as to be useless
as a guide to Russia's plans for the cleanup of nuclear legacy sites.

The same concerns extend to Russia's response to nuclear emergencies.
Since many sites are operated by the military or considered key to
national security, gathering information about incidents is extremely
difficult.

[Before the war, the prospect of a nuclear accident in the Arctic seemed
remote]{.underline}. It was only slightly easier to imagine one
involving a nuclear vessel or a floating nuclear power plant. [Today,
the situation is deteriorating rapidly, as Russia continues to build new
nuclear sites while halting the cleanup of nuclear legacy sites. The
absence of]{.underline} international assistance and [regional
cooperation]{.underline}, along with the dwindling attention paid to
nuclear safety in the Arctic by the federal authorities, [spells further
trouble]{.underline}.

That the risks are growing is no concern to [Russia,]{.underline} which
[may]{.underline} in [fact see the peril of its development of the
Arctic as a feature, not a bug. It could form part of its policy of
blackmail, with Russia taking things to the brink to force concessions
from the West such as the resumption of financing and technical
assistance]{.underline}---irrespective of developments on other fronts.

[Arctic security can be characterised as a nexus between multipolar
nuclear conflict and climate change]{.underline}. Multipolarity is
defined as a global balance of power between multiple actors \[3\].
Climate Change is making seaways and resources more accessible, which is
leading to a thawing of territorial conflicts which were formerly frozen
\[4\]. China's increasing economic interests in the Arctic means it must
be considered as a regional actor despite its near-regional status
\[5\]. Russia has recently threatened to use nuclear weapons against the
United States (U.S.) due to its objections to Russia's invasion of
Ukraine; this sets a precedent for heightened nuclear tension in [the
Arctic]{.underline}, which [is the most nuclearized area in the world
and has seen a steady buildup of nuclear and conventional forces by
regional actors]{.underline} \[6\]. These factors have led to direct
tensions between three major nuclear actors (namely, NATO, China, and
Russia) in a region that is becoming increasingly competitive \[7\].
These [tensions cannot be adequately explained by existing deterrence
models]{.underline}, which rely on Cold War-era bipolar game theory
\[8\]. Due to climate change, geopolitical tension, and the Russian
invasion of Ukraine, [nuclear relations in the Arctic are unstable and
present serious security risks]{.underline} that cannot be contended
with through the use of classic deterrence theory \[9\].

Arctic Governance and Climate Change

The Arctic region is 66.5° north of the equator and encompasses the
United States, Canada, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Russia, and
Iceland, all of whom are members of the region's governing body, the
Arctic Council \[10\]. The region's international legal status currently
lies under the United Nations Convention for the Law of the Sea,
however, due to climate change, polar ice is melting, making the region
more accessible by sea and opening up its vast oil and gas deposits for
extraction by regional actors \[11\].

Sino-Russian cooperation along sea routes has given China significant
influence in the region, which it wants to develop into a "Polar Silk
Road" as outlined in its 2018 Arctic White Paper \[12\]. Chinese
development interests do not align with Russia's geopolitical goals in
the Arctic, and China's ownership over Arctic infrastructure represents
an economic threat to Russian interests \[13\]. There is growing
competition between these regional actors which is exacerbated by
overlapping territorial boundary claims by Denmark, Canada, and Russia.
In addition, the Arctic Council has suspended cooperation due to its
chairmanship by Russia until the end of 2023 \[14\].

Deterrence and Arctic Nuclear Relations

Classic nuclear deterrence is steeped in Cold War bipolarity and relies
on two rational actors basing their decisions on what they believe their
opponents\' actions will be \[15\]. Classic deterrence is expressed
through the Chicken Game \[16\]. As seen in the figure below, a player's
options are to defect and pursue a foreign policy objective or to
cooperate and maintain the status quo \[17\]. The best outcome for an
actor is to defect against a cooperating partner; however, this runs the
risk of both players defecting, leading to nuclear annihilation \[18\].

This classic deterrence game does not contend with the possibility of
conflict between multiple nuclear actors, which is a key feature of
Arctic security \[19\]. Though a three-player chicken game has been
applied to theoretical problems, such as two out of three players
needing to complete a task that all would rather not complete, this
model has yet to be applied to nuclear relations \[20\]. China, NATO,
the U.S., and Russia's nuclear doctrines are informed by deterrence
theory, which is problematic due to the theory's assumption of a bipolar
world order \[21\].

[Nuclear multipolarity in the Arctic is unstable because it no longer
falls within]{.underline} the [traditional game theory]{.underline}
matrix, [and there is an increased risk of nuclear action due to a
larger number of nuclear actors and significant regional
tension]{.underline} \[22\]. [Preemptive nuclear strikes are more
prevalent in multipolar nuclear politics due to a greater perception of
threat from other actors]{.underline} \[23\]. Though China promotes
itself as a No First Use (NFU) state, meaning that it will not strike
unless struck upon in a nuclear capacity, [Russia has threatened to
strike first]{.underline}, and America's position on NFU is vague
\[24\]. NATO is a nuclear deterrent organisation in the Arctic region,
only Sweden is not yet a full NATO member and Finland has just recently
gained NATO membership \[25\]. In multipolar deterrence, [regional
conflicts are more likely to escalate into **total nuclear
warfare**]{.underline}, [and de-escalation relies on political
bargaining as opposed to rationality modelling]{.underline}. Thus, [it
is unclear how political bargaining will take place in an increasingly
polarised Arctic]{.underline} \[26\].

Though the U.S., China, and Russia have all acceded to or ratified the
Treaty of the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NNPT), [both Russia
and the U.S. have backed out of data-sharing obligations under the New
START treaty]{.underline} \[27\]. [This breakdown in communication
between Arctic actors due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and Russia's
recent threat to use nuclear weapons against the U.S. indicates that
future regional disputes over Arctic resources, navigation, and
territory may give rise to nuclear crises]{.underline} \[28\].

The need for increased council activity

[Norway's [chairship]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2023-2025 [has [managed to
balance the situation]{.mark} and keep the council alive by]{.underline}
[gradually ramping up its activities]{.underline}. For the Danish,
Greenlandic and Faroese chairship to be a success, it would be wise to
continue on the same path with steadily increasing activity to ensure
that the council's pulse continues to beat.
[[However]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[the fact that the
threat]{.underline}]{.mark} now both [[comes from the east and the west
makes the balancing act historically difficult.]{.underline}]{.mark}

One opportunity for increasing activity is to further enhance the focus
on the rights of Indigenous peoples in the Arctic -- which the new
chairship program, indeed, prioritizes -- in order to strengthen
regional cooperation without necessarily having to compromise on
condemning Russia. If the situation allows, [something as ambitious as a
binding agreement on increased protection of Indigenous peoples' rights
in the Arctic would be worth striving for, similar to the council's
three existing agreements]{.underline} on aeronautical and maritime
search and rescue (2011), marine oil pollution preparedness and response
(2013), and enhancing international Arctic scientific cooperation
(2017).

It [[may not]{.mark} [sound like something Trump]{.mark} [would want a
stake in]{.mark},]{.underline} but there is a chance that the Arctic
Council does not have [[his attention]{.underline}]{.mark} whatsoever
due to its limited activity -- and because there are plenty of other
things that keep him occupied. If that is the case, it may actually
prove to be an advantage for the Arctic Council, which [[under

**[strengthen its relevance]{.mark} if [meetings were prioritized by the

current fragile existence]{.underline} [and the crucial
challenges]{.underline} [make increased activity and regional consensus
the overriding success criteria.]{.underline} In this light, it may be
beneficial if State Secretary Marco Rubio is not at the table.

The [[chairship's level of ambition]{.mark} [is]{.mark}
[therefore]{.mark}]{.underline} [[closely linked to]{.mark} how
[relations]{.mark}]{.underline} [[with Russia]{.mark} [in the east and
the US]{.mark}]{.underline} in the west unfold in the coming period, and
here it is extra important that the other member states stand together.
[Only in [this way]{.mark} can [we ensure that the Arctic Council

Three [reasons why the [Arctic Council must survive]{.mark}]{.underline}

There are many good reasons why the Arctic Council should survive. Here
we will highlight three:

[First, the [involvement]{.mark}]{.underline} [[of Indigenous
peoples]{.mark} as permanent participants in the council [is unique in
an international context]{.mark}]{.underline}. [They do not have direct
decision-making authority, but they are at the table and provide
input]{.underline} -- [and are heard --]{.underline} [when decisions are
made.]{.underline} [[If the]{.mark} Arctic [Council does not
survive]{.mark}, this]{.underline} [unique construct will fall
apart]{.underline}, [which will [create a major challenge for Arctic
Indigenous peoples]{.mark}, who are unlikely to gain the same kind of
influence in another regional forum.]{.underline}

Second, [the Arctic Council's [working groups are a unique
construct]{.mark}: Over three decades, [scientists and officials have
accumulated knowledge that has been incorporated into national
administration]{.mark} and international convention]{.underline} work.
This work has [thus helped to make the rest of the world aware of the
enormous climatic and environmental challenges that are extraordinarily
noticeable in the Arctic]{.underline}, well exemplified by the average
regional temperature increase which is about three times higher than the
global average. Thus, [the scientific work under the auspices of the
Arctic Council is not only important for the region, but for the globe
at large]{.underline}. If the Arctic Council does not survive the
current crisis, [these essential networks will likely collapse, and they
cannot be rebuilt overnight.]{.underline}

[The third, and related, reason is that the [Arctic states and the other
actors of the Council face major transboundary challenges that are best
solved jointly]{.mark}. Be it b[iodiversity]{.mark}]{.underline}
[issues, the [spread of diseases]{.mark} and [environmental
problems]{.mark}]{.underline}; the risk of the latter is only increasing
in step with the heightened activities in the region.

[grown **more flagrant**]{.mark}]{.underline}, the United States has
tried to draw international attention to the issue. For example, in

call out Chinese incursion]{.underline} into the region, stating, "There
are only Arctic States and Non-Arctic States. No third category exists,
and claiming otherwise entitles China to exactly nothing."26
[[However]{.mark}, these]{.underline} sporadic, [[**unilateral actions**

Official [Russian and Chinese policy documents outlining Arctic
strategies still identify cooperation and respect for international
governance as key priorities]{.underline} in the region. But these
nations' actions over the past two decades have not matched their
rhetoric. Both Russia and China are making deliberate attempts to
exploit loopholes in the region's governing regimes, specifically those
related to UNCLOS and the authority of the [Arctic Council]{.underline},
to expand Sino-Russian access to Arctic resources and shipping routes.
[[To deter Sino-Russian expansionism]{.mark} in the region]{.underline},
the [[United States must **strengthen the international institutions in
the Arctic**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The [three key areas]{.mark}
requiring American attention are the territorial status of Arctic
[shipping routes]{.mark}, a lack of coordination on [economic]{.mark}
and [military matters]{.mark} between Arctic states, [and]{.mark} the
ineffectiveness of collective [security agreements]{.mark} in the
region]{.underline}. These areas of focus offer the best initial steps
for the United States to secure its interests in the region more
effectively. Along with its allies and partners, the United States
relies on access to the Arctic for transportation, scientific research,
and regulated economic activity conducted in accordance with
international law. Additionally, the United States is not obligated to
secure its population in the high north from negative influences from
foreign states. [[As Russia and China continue to exploit]{.mark},
control, and restrict access to [the region]{.mark}, [protecting]{.mark}
these [interests]{.mark} [will become increasingly difficult for
the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}. [**[The United
States must lead an international]{.mark} [effort to correct]{.mark}
these shortfalls in [the Arctic]{.mark}**'s governing regimes as quickly
as possible]{.underline}. [[The longer the United States allows]{.mark}
its [adversaries to]{.mark} [circumvent]{.mark} the rules-based
[international order]{.mark} in support of their expansionist policies,
[the **more difficult maintaining**]{.mark} a cooperative and

However, critics argued that the [[Trump]{.underline}
[administration's]{.underline}]{.mark} [largely [unilateral]{.mark} and
short-sighted economic [approach risked **destabilizing**]{.mark}
established multilateral frameworks such as [the Arctic
Council]{.mark}]{.underline}. These [[frameworks]{.mark} historically
[facilitated cooperation]{.mark} among Arctic nations, providing a
balanced mechanism for managing shared resources, mitigating
environmental risks, and reducing geopolitical tensions]{.underline}.
[Trump's]{.underline} [[reduced commitment to such cooperative
frameworks risked]{.mark} [alienating]{.mark} traditional [allies and
intensifying regional rivalries]{.mark}, potentially [undermining
long-term stability]{.mark}]{.underline}.

The economic opportunities presented by the Arctic region are
undoubtedly significant, particularly regarding shorter shipping routes
and abundant natural resources. Nonetheless, the [[risks]{.underline}
[posed]{.underline} [by]{.underline}]{.mark} [rapid [development
without]{.mark}]{.underline} robust [environmental [safeguards]{.mark}
are equally [substantial]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The [potential
for ecological disasters, acceleration of global climate impacts, and
disruption of local indigenous communities' livelihoods]{.underline}
[remain critical concerns]{.underline}. Additionally, [heightened
geopolitical competition absent meaningful diplomatic engagement could
escalate tensions, increasing instability within the
region.]{.underline}

Trump-era Arctic policy thus exemplifies a broader geopolitical
challenge: [balancing immediate economic and national security interests
with the imperative for sustainable development and cooperative
international relations]{.underline}. As the Arctic continues to evolve
due to climate change and geopolitical pressures, [it becomes
[increasingly crucial for policymakers to adopt balanced, sustainable
strategies]{.mark}]{.underline}. These should emphasize not only
resource management but also meaningful engagement with indigenous
communities, enhanced diplomatic collaboration, and comprehensive
environmental stewardship.

**[The current political and economic environment differs greatly from
the immediate post-Cold War era that brought opportunities for Arctic
States to]{.underline}** build trust and [**collaborate for their mutual
benefit**.]{.underline} With the potential for great wealth in a newly
accessible Arctic, **[[a shift to]{.underline}]{.mark}** decidedly [more
**[unilateral approaches]{.mark}**]{.underline} to the Arctic
[**[may]{.mark}**]{.underline} occur. Even before the Ukraine war,
former US Secretary of State Pompeo's speech in Rovaniemi engendered
more nationalistic individualism than it did the spirit of Gorbachev's
1987 speech calling for "a genuine zone of peace and fruitful
cooperation,86 demonstrating just how far the Member States and
Observers have strayed from the principles of the Ottawa Declaration.
Following the 2013 Ministerial Meeting in Kiruna, Sweden, the Council
released its Vision for the Arctic, in which the Member States and
Permanent Participants stated, "We are confident that there is no
problem that we cannot solve together through our cooperative
relationships on the basis of existing international law and good will."
87; Russia's invasion of Ukraine, breaching a key principle of
international law, quickly unraveled the goodwill and cooperation that
characterized Arctic diplomacy over the past twenty-five years. The
"Arctic exceptionalism" bubble burst, **[[leav]{.mark}i]{.underline}**ng
[**[many to question the Council's]{.mark} continued [ability to
maintain peace]{.mark} and foster constructive dialogue**]{.underline}
when trust between the Arctic States is severely compromised. Non Arctic
States, like China, may use this opportunity to intensify their calls
for global Arctic governance or attempt to profit from the shaky status
of the Arctic Council by expanding bilateral agreements with an isolated
Russia. As the Ukraine war continues, a quick return to the previous
cooperative spirit is unlikely. A void in Arctic governance has emerged
when cooperation is most critical. Whether the Member States wish it or
not, change is now inevitable for the Arctic Council. Climate change is
forever altering the physical geography of the Arctic, opening a once
isolated region to the global economy and intercontinental
transportation routes. The North is no longer a peripheral area of
international relations; the "new" Arctic will increasingly take center
stage in foreign and economic policies. The Council must now adapt both
to the unprecedented situation that has stalled its operations, and
restructure itself to adapt to the ecological and socioeconomic
pressures reshaping the Arctic environment, all while political and
military tension threaten to destabilize the region. The war in Ukraine
demonstrated that the Arctic is not immune to complications of high
politics and conflict far from its borders. Regardless of the situation
in Ukraine, every effort must be made to resume Arctic Council
operations with full Russian participation. From a purely scientific
perspective, scientists and research institutes have previously noted
the loss of scientific mores during periods of conflict and war.88 With
the diplomatic fallout of the Ukraine War, the inability for some
scientists to engage in field work within Russian territory, along with
the freeze in certain projects, is already resulting in "significant
gaps" in Arctic research data.89 Additionally, the war increases the
critical nature of maintaining cooperation in the Arctic to reduce
military posturing and the risk of sparking active conflict; the
collaborative atmosphere of the Arctic Council has until now provided
opportunities for communication and diplomacy on issues beyond the
Arctic through the ups and downs of East-West relations.90 At the start
of its Chairmanship Russia reminded the Council that it has worked
consistently to guard the Arctic "as the territory of peace, stability
and constructive cooperation."91 It added that Arctic States "carry
special responsibility for the future of the region and its
inhabitants." 92 This sense of duty should encourage the Member States
to find a solution to the current impasse. A return to the original
spirit of Gorbachev's Murmansk speech could restore the congeniality
between the Member States. [[Rebuilding]{.underline}]{.mark} trust
between all the Arctic States is paramount to [[Arctic]{.mark} Ocean
[governance]{.mark}]{.underline}[;]{.mark} efforts at Arctic
conservation [**[can only succeed if the coastal Arctic
States]{.mark}**,]{.underline} in particular, **[[work
together]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Member States should revisit the
foundation of their Arctic accomplishments, and re-initiate scientific
collaboration and knowledge sharing that includes projects in Russia,
the largest Arctic State. The Ottawa Declaration, and the Arctic
Environmental Protection Strategy (AEPS) before it, could provide the
key to renewing goodwill and re-examining the future of Arctic
governance. The Council should focus on shared threats and challenges,
bearing in mind the Principle of the Common Concern of Humankind, to
revitalize peer-to-peer dialogue and collaboration. The threats of
climate change in the fragile Arctic environment demand enhanced
scientific cooperation "to monitor and improve our understanding of how
and to what degree the Arctic climate is changing." 93 Should relations
sour even further and Russia choose to exit the Arctic Council, the
international community would suffer with the permanent loss of this
forum which has furthered understanding of complex ecological processes
and assisted in vital policy work. As many have noted, "Russia's
importance, especially for Arctic environmental and climate research, is
irreplaceable." 94 While some advisors challenge the possibility of a
"return to the prewar reality", 95 Norway, as Chair of the Arctic
Council, is optimistic that relations can be repaired.96 As a focal
point for collaboration and cooperation, science can play a critical
role in regaining trust, rebuilding diplomacy, and maintaining peace.
The AEPS, with its focus on monitoring, assessment, and protection of
the Arctic environment, succeeded in bringing the East and West together
in the early years following the end of the Cold War. Those same mutual
interests, and the less formal venue in which to share knowledge, could
bring the Arctic Member States back together again. Time is running out
on taking precautionary measures to protect the Arctic. **[[The Arctic
environment cannot be sacrificed to realpolitik when a unique
opportunity exists to work collaboratively]{.underline}]{.mark}** [to
regulate emergent industries and transportation before potentially
irreversible damage occurs]{.underline}. The [coastal Arctic states must
recognize their shared mutual interest in working together to maintain a
regional influence over an Arctic governance that best reflects their
goals and concerns]{.underline}. A more accessible Arctic requires
strong leadership; [[a divided Arctic Council simply cannot meet the
pressing challenges put before it]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the
twenty-seven years since its creation, the Arctic Council has succeeded
in bringing global attention to the fragility of the Arctic and its
connection to global ecological systems. As political and economic
forces permeate the Arctic, successfully addressing Arctic issues
depends on strong alliances and mutual trust between Arctic Council
Members, Observers and Permanent Participants. The peaceful relations
and cooperation emblematic of the post-Cold War Arctic resulted from the
opportunities for dialogue provided by the Arctic Council, even in times
of heightened tensions. The more congenial format of the Arctic Council,
one not based on rigid legal obligations, has allowed for greater
openness, and frank dialogue, sometimes lacking in more formal
diplomatic settings. Those channels of communication and cooperation
must remain open for the good of the planet and humanity. The Arctic is
facing unprecedented challenges; [Arctic governance must not
disintegrate when]{.underline} robust regulations and transnational
[peace and cooperation are most urgent]{.underline}.

On May 11, 2023, in a much-anticipated ceremony, leaders from eight
Arctic states and six Indigenous organizations assembled behind closed
doors to witness a transfer of power. At first blush, it was routine
Arctic Council business: this forum promoting northern cooperation
rotates chairmanship every two years. But this had been no ordinary
year, with no ordinary chair. The council---suspended since Russia's
invasion of Ukraine last year---resurrected only to witness Russia hand
the chairmanship to its Norwegian successor. And a peaceful transfer was
far from a foregone conclusion. "It was an extremely straightforward
meeting, which we see as a success," said Morten Hoglund, senior Arctic
official for Norway, in a virtual press briefing from Tromso directly
following the meeting. "If someone had an interest in it not going as
planned, they could have easily derailed it." That "someone," of course,
would have been Russia. [Since the [Arctic Council's]{.mark} unilateral
[refusal to cooperate with]{.mark} its largest geographical member last
March, [Russia]{.mark} has shown no sign of de-escalating its aggression
against Ukraine. And the council's [130]{.mark}-odd circumpolar
[projects]{.mark}---tackling issues from science, to shipping, to
Indigenous youth suicide---have [paid the price.]{.mark} For more than a
year, this symbol of High North peace has fractured along territorial
lines, awaiting a return to a status quo]{.underline} that seems
increasingly impossible. Today, with a NATO state back at its helm, the
[Arctic Council]{.underline} will presumably experience less tension.
But it's [still unwilling to include]{.underline} [Russia]{.underline},
[raising practical questions about what this forum can actually achieve
without its largest geographical stakeholder. [Russia]{.mark} makes up
[45 percent of]{.mark} the [geographical Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline};
[[shipping routes]{.mark} depend on its waters, and [climate
research]{.mark} depends on its data.]{.underline} Norway is now facing
hard questions about the relevance of a "circumpolar" forum that ignores
half of the High North. "Technically speaking**[, [there's no
'Arctic]{.mark} [Council' without Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}**," said
Svein Vigeland Rottem, senior research fellow at the Norwegian Fridtjof
Nansen Institute and author of the 2020 book The Arctic Council: Between
Environmental Protection and Geopolitics. "[So one could ask: What,
exactly, is this group now?"]{.underline} The Arctic Council, founded in
1996 in a post-Cold War vision of High North peace, has no real global
equivalent. Along with representatives from eight foreign ministries,
it's the only international group that includes Indigenous leaders as
equal stakeholders. (The council's 13 observer states, made up of
interested non-Arctic nations, attend but do not participate in
meetings.) And, because its work is voluntary and not treaty-based,
these leaders have flexibility to independently approve or invest in its
projects. "It's a completely unique group formed around a specific set
of challenges," said Lars-Otto Reiersen, who served as executive
secretary of the council's Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program
(AMAP) for 25 years. "Most leaders of Arctic states don't reside there.
And most problems in the north can't be solved there, either." Pollution
was the first such problem to raise global attention. In 1991, Finland
launched AMAP, then a postwar project to monitor contamination
throughout the far north. The findings were startling: The blood of
Arctic species and peoples contained the planet's highest concentration
of persistent organic chemicals---the vast majority of which came from
industry farther south. The cold Northern regions acted as a "sink" for
these global pollutants, they found, and toxic chemicals were building
up, or bioaccumulating, in the blood of polar species foundational to
Indigenous diets. AMAP recognized a twofold challenge: to both establish
a dialogue on the ground with Arctic communities, and at the highest
levels to influence international law. Over the next decade, its data,
coupled with policy recommendations, helped build the legally binding
2001 Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. "It was a
success story of combining data you can't question with real actions for
policymakers to take," Reiersen said. "And it was an early model of
close collaboration between scientists and Indigenous people." In 1996,
the Arctic Council formed in the spirit of this work: to protect the
environment and peoples of the north. Since, its six expert-led working
groups---including monitoring, clean-up, conservation, oceans, peoples,
search and rescue, and sustainable development---have worked in the
background to influence international law. Data published in its 2009
Arctic Marine Shipping Assessment directly informed the International
Maritime Organization's regulatory Polar Code. An AMAP report on mercury
contamination fueled the 2013 Minamata Convention regulating mercury.
Since 2005, AMAP---now a network of more than 700 experts---has also
contributed the entire Arctic section of the annual Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change report. [In March 2022, however, this vast
network of science, policy, and diplomacy came to a screeching halt. For
some projects, the pause was brief:]{.underline} By June, some projects
without direct Russian involvement quietly resumed their work. The
Indigenous Peoples' Secretariat, which supports the six Indigenous
organizations independently of the council, also continued to operate.
But [for [climate science]{.mark} and environmental monitoring
projects---which [rely on consistent data]{.mark} collection [across
borders]{.mark}---it was a massive blow. "There's a huge amount of data
we aren't getting anymore," Reiersen said. "Plus Russian data we know
isn't being collected, because these projects were funded by Western
states."]{.underline} But since its research-rooted origins, the Arctic
Council has taken on a new role: a diplomatic stage in an increasingly
competitive global arena. In the past decade, the [Arctic's melts have
newly opened the region for shipping, resource extraction, and other
economic opportunities.]{.underline} Ever since, Reiersen said, interest
in the council and its activities has soared. In 2013, in recognition of
growing interests in the north, the council added six new observer
states: China, Japan, India, Italy, Singapore, and South Korea. In 2013,
the council established an independent secretariat in Tromso to archive
knowledge and facilitate its work. In 2018 and 2022[, the council was
nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.]{.underline} "There was a time when
a lot of people were raising this one organization up as the primary
body for Arctic cooperation," said Andreas Osthagen, senior fellow at
the Arctic Institute. "But it gets tricky the moment that all falls
apart." Osthagen is critical of what he sees as an outsized symbolic
weight placed on the Arctic Council. In truth, he says, this forum is
only one piece of a vast picture of High North governance. Legally
binding agreements, most notably the 1994 Law of the Sea Convention, he
notes, do much more to guide and regulate Arctic activity. And several
other treaties and forums---like the Polar Code governing shipping, the
Arctic Fisheries Agreement, the Arctic Coast Guard Forum, and countless
bilateral agreements---still provide issue-specific opportunities for
cooperation. Similarly, Osthagen said, the "real value" of the council
was not as a diplomatic stage, but in the practical achievements of its
working groups and their projects. Soon, even those [[projects]{.mark}
without Russian participation are [headed for]{.mark} a
[roadblock]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [The Arctic Council is a
[consensus-based forum]{.mark}, and its [projects require full-member
approval]{.mark}. But project funding typically only spans a few years
at most. **[Unless the council]{.mark}**]{.underline} changes its
decision-making requirements[, or **[decides to include
Russia]{.mark}**, the runway for **this [work is limited]{.mark}**.
Russia may not wait around to be invited back to the table. In February,
Russia amended its Arctic policy, removing all mention of the Arctic
Council. For the past year, [Russia]{.mark} has [strengthened
i]{.mark}ts [Arctic cooperation with China]{.mark}, including a proposed
new research station on Svalbard with BRICS nations.]{.underline} And,
with Sweden likely soon to follow Finland's recent NATO inclusion, the
newly termed "Arctic 7" seem all the more distanced from their estranged
eighth. Still, [by cooperating in the [May 11 meeting]{.mark}, [Russia
signaled]{.mark} at least [some investment in]{.mark} the [council's
survival]{.mark}. And it took what Hoglund called a "powerful step
forward":]{.underline} [After the meeting, the council released a [joint
declaration]{.mark} signed by all members,]{.underline} including
Russian senior Arctic official Nikolay Korchunov. "We wanted to give the
message that the Arctic Council is not dead, it's still here, and we
want to make it relevant again," Hoglund said. A [declaration of life
seems all the council can currently muster.]{.underline} Volker Rachold,
director of the German Arctic Office, called this year's joint
declaration "highly unusual." Typically, after the standard affirmation
of the council's purpose, the declaration outlines goals and new
projects for the next two years. This year, he said, the statement was
notably sparse. "After the usual opening remarks, it just seemed to
stop," Rachold said. "I thought I was missing pages." Rottem believes
that, for now, Norway has a lot to gain from staying vague. Any fanfare
or strong statement, he said, threatens a more formal fracture.
[[Starting new projects]{.mark} would [force]{.mark} hard [questions
about]{.mark} how to treat the [consensus vote]{.mark}.]{.underline} But
the small Nordic nation, which shares a land border with Russia, is
well-practiced in walking a fine diplomatic line with its neighbor. For
now, by moving slowly and staying light on details, it may just keep the
past 30 years of work afloat. [In June, Arctic Council leaders will meet
again---this time without Russia]{.underline}---to discuss a potential
path forward. Hoglund said that he hopes to have a sense of next steps
by the end of the summer, but it's no hard deadline. Generally, he said,
[those eager to see the work of the Arctic Council resume at full
strength will be disappointed.]{.underline} "We're not here ringing a
bell to say we're back; we're focused on taking it step by step,"
Hoglund said. "If cooperation breaks down completely, it will be so much
harder to rebuild it from scratch." This report was supported by the

system, or a desire to continue a policy]{.underline} that every U.S.
president since Kennedy has supported.

In addition, he has [[openly criticized]{.mark} [NATO]{.mark} and the
ICC, along with many of the U.S. economic agreements with other nations.
In both his first term and now his second, Trump has [shown **a clear
lack of support** **for**]{.mark} [international organizations
and]{.mark} **[multilateral agreements]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
Specifically, he seems intent on either ending American participation or
upending the agreements solely for American benefit.

[Trump has already demonstrated that]{.underline} even if he doesn't
withdraw from the Arctic Council, [he would actively gut some of the
most important achievements in line with his own goals. First, [he
doesn't "believe" in climate change]{.mark}. During Trump's first term,
the Arctic Council ministerial meeting in Rovaniemi in 2019 failed to
produce a final declaration for the first time since the organization
was created.]{.underline} This was because [the U.S. delegation -- under
the leadership of Secretary of States Mike Pompeo -- objected to the
term "climate change" or any reference to the Paris Accord. There is
nothing to suggest that the American [position]{.mark} on climate change
will be altered]{.underline}. If anything, it **[[will probably get more
strident]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[Trump]{.underline} has [also [moved quickly to end American
programs]{.mark} [that are]{.mark}]{.underline} in any way
[[associated]{.underline} [with]{.underline}]{.mark} the issues
surrounding Diversity, Equity and Inclusion
([[DEI]{.underline}]{.mark}). It is **[[highly
unlikely]{.underline}]{.mark}** that as part of this process to reshape
American society, [[his administration would
support]{.underline}]{.mark} [any]{.underline} of the [important
[initiatives supporting]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the northern Indigenous
Peoples]{.mark} [under the Arctic Council]{.mark}]{.underline}. His
administration has had no qualms about ending the support that the U.S.
had provided to the developing world, so he will almost certainly be
unwilling to continue to provide any support of the Permanent
Participants or any of the Arctic Council programs that support them.

[Third]{.underline}, [Trump has directly attacked two of the core state
members of the Arctic Council]{.underline}. Since his second term began,
he has [[repeatedly threatened to "take over" both Greenland and
Canada]{.underline}]{.mark}. While some at first thought he was just
joking, Trump has continued to say that these are his intentions. He has
[begun to take active steps, through the threats of a trade war to
critically weaken Canada in order to make it more amendable to "joining"
the U.S. Again]{.underline}, even if he doesn't move to directly destroy
the Arctic Council, [**[how could]{.mark} [Canada and Denmark]{.mark}
[work]{.mark} [with the U.S]{.mark}., [knowing that the Americans are
actively moving to weaken]{.mark}** or even \[weaken\]~~cripple~~
**[them as a state]{.mark}**?]{.underline}

[Fourth]{.underline}, the one Arctic state that Trump has attempted to
improve relations with -- [[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} --
[[remains]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[problematic]{.mark} for the Arctic
Council]{.underline}. [Trump's]{.underline} [[effort]{.underline} [to
work with Russia]{.underline}]{.mark} [[will make the existing issues
that the Arctic Council]{.mark} [had]{.mark}]{.underline} with Russia
[[even more difficult]{.underline}]{.mark}. Trump has already called for
the Russians to be readmitted to the G-7. If he doesn't move to end the
Arctic Council, he will undoubtedly call for any sanctions against
Russia to be eliminated and for the country to be fully integrated.

At the same time he is actively moving to directly be involved in
assisting Russia to complete its conquest of Ukraine. In a move that is
reminiscent of the conquest of Czechoslovakia through the capitulation
of the U.K. and France to Germany in 1938, Trump has begun direct
negotiations with Russia without the involvement of the Ukrainians.
Putin now knows that it has the support of Trump.

As a result, there is every reason to believe that Russia will continue
with its acts of aggression against its neighbours. This includes both
Sweden and Finland, who both chose to join NATO. Putin has always made
it clear that it was the possibility of Ukraine joining NATO that was
one of the reasons for his decision to launch his war of aggression
against Ukraine in 2014.

[Scorched Earth Policy]{.underline}

Ultimately, this means that the Arctic Council now faces two terrible
scenarios. The first is that in his scorched earth policy toward
multilateralism, [[Trump will]{.mark} [either move to end the Arctic
Council or]{.mark} at least [remove the U.S. as a
member]{.mark}]{.underline}. He may also carry out his threat to ensure
that both Canada and Denmark also cease to be meaningful members of the
Arctic Council. [If he truly does intend to take over Canada, it won't
even be a state. Even if he only means to weaken and reduce Canada to a
vassal state, its ability to participate will be damaged -- if not
eliminated]{.underline}.

Likewise, [if the U.S. takes over Greenland, Denmark's main rational for
being a member of the Arctic Council will be eliminated. Assuming that
somehow the Arctic Council survives an American withdrawal, and the U.S.
follows up its threats to control Greenland and Canada, the Council
would have only the active membership of Finland, Sweden, Norway and
Iceland]{.underline}.

[[Even if the U.S. remains]{.mark} in the Arctic Council, its [current
actions means the gutting of]{.mark} some of its most [important
missions]{.mark}, The U.S. won't support actions to eliminate the causes
of climate change, and it is very unlikely to support the Permanent
Participants.]{.underline} Outside of the Council, perhaps the Coast
Guard forum will continue. But even here Trump is having an impact. [He
has already fired Admiral Linda Pagan, the Commandant of the
USCG.]{.underline} American officials have suggested it was because of
her commitment to DEI policies.

Even more dangerously, [[this]{.mark} [variant of the Arctic
Council]{.mark} [would include]{.mark} [a U.S. whose policies
are]{.mark} now [at complete odds with the previous actions]{.mark} o[f
the]{.mark} Arctic [Council.]{.mark} It would also include a Denmark
that has either lost Greenland to the U.S. or will need to take action
to prevent this]{.underline}. It will include a Canada that is being
continually weakened by American action, and is either actively trying
to stop an American takeover or has become a vassal state to the U.S.
[It will also include a Russia that is being increasingly supported by
the U.S. and has been given the right of conquest over Ukraine.
Furthermore, if Ukraine was conquered for considering joining NATO, the
future of both Finland and Sweden (which did actually join NATO) will
undoubtedly be even more problematic for Russia.]{.underline}

These are dire times for the Arctic Council. It is hard to think of a
way to maintain its many successes in supporting an understanding of the
impact of climate change on the Arctic. It has also played an important
role in supporting a greater awareness of the northern Indigenous
Peoples in the region. And perhaps most importantly, it has served as
the principal means of promoting a peaceful and harmonious international
regime of cooperation.

All of this is now at risk. [Perhaps Trump won't think that the Arctic
Council is worth his attention]{.underline}, [and it can somehow
**remain under the American radar**]{.underline} until the next
presidential election. But as many have said in the past, hope is not a
strategy.

### Arctic Council Fails---2AC

#### Numerous international frameworks trump and resolve Arctic discord

**Overfield 2023** Cornell Overfield is a research analyst at Center for
Naval Analyses. The views expressed here are his own and do not reflect
his employer. "There's Still Law in the Far North: Don\'t revive the
Arctic Council until Russia is out of Ukraine." July 10, 2023,
https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/07/10/far-north-arctic-council-russia-ukraine-war/

One of the quieter consequences of Russia's full-scale invasion of
Ukraine was a joint decision by Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland,
Norway, Sweden, and the United States (the Arctic 7) to pause the
activities of the Arctic Council, which includes Russia. Almost
immediately, some experts worried that this move would backfire on the
Arctic 7 and make for a more disorderly Arctic. A recent article in the
Financial Times is just the latest example to perpetuate fundamental
myths about Arctic economic and social governance.

In the Financial Times, former Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto
warned that "an Arctic with no rules" was in the offing with the Arctic
Council in limbo. But [[the council itself doesn't create, or enforce,
the rules of the north. The council is just a forum]{.mark}, and the
[vast majority of Arctic governance]{.mark}---economic, social, and
climate---has always [happened beyond its doors. International and
national law are the real powers in the Arctic]{.mark},]{.underline} and
the only threat to them comes from Russian impunity.

The Arctic Council, established in 1996, is an intergovernmental forum
composed of the eight Arctic states, a half-dozen Indigenous communities
as permanent participants, and an assortment of observer states and
organizations. The council is chaired by the Arctic states on a rotating
basis, with biennial summits between foreign ministers capping one
chair's agenda and handing the reins to the next chair. The vast bulk of
the council's work is producing environmental, social, and development
assessments (military security is off limits) through ad hoc projects
and seven working and expert groups. Decisions require unanimity.
Projects are funded and recommendations implemented by members, not the
council.

[[I]{.mark}nternational [law underpins]{.mark} regional
[governance]{.mark}. The Arctic is ringed by land with clear owners---no
land dispute remains in the Arctic.]{.underline} Beyond the Arctic's
shores, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ([[UNCLOS)
sets rules]{.mark} on resource entitlements]{.underline} in the oceans.
The [Arctic states all generally respect UNCLOS]{.underline} both in the
Arctic and globally, and its universal rules clearly delineate where
Arctic states have exclusive resource rights to oil, minerals, and fish,
and where the high seas begin.

[E]{.underline}xclusive [e]{.underline}conomic [z]{.underline}one (which
stretch up to 200 nautical miles from shore) boundaries [are all but
settled]{.underline}, and competing Russian, Canadian, and Danish claims
to more rights to seabed resources are proceeding in full accordance
with international law. All that will be left for the global commons are
the fish of the central Arctic Ocean---and even they are off the menu
until 2037 thanks to a temporary international fishing moratorium.

[Beyond these universal legal structures, Arctic-specific
measures]{.underline}---such as a treaty divvying up search-and-rescue
responsibilities (negotiated via the Arctic Council) or the
International Maritime Organization's Polar Code setting standards for
ships operating in Arctic waters---[also remain in place]{.underline}.
The United States (and China, among others) have long-standing
disagreements with Russia and Canada over navigational rights in the
Northeast and Northwest Passages, but these are fundamentally universal
issues about the sanctity of navigational freedom.

National law, whether on economic development, environmental protection,
or Indigenous rights, provides the matter of governance within the
framework of national sovereignty and exclusive rights. Take investment,
for instance, which all Arctic states recognize as a key need for
creating sustainable economies that respond to growing demand for Arctic
resources. At the Center for Naval Analyses, we recently demonstrated
how [Canada, Norway, Russia, and the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates all [use their own f]{.underline}oreign
[d]{.underline}irect [i]{.underline}nvestment [screening laws to
scrutinize]{.underline} and block [investments from China]{.underline}
at odds with national security.

This is just [one example of how]{.underline}, even at its height, [[the
A]{.underline}]{.mark}rctic [[C]{.underline}]{.mark}ouncil [[was no
E]{.underline}]{.mark}uropean [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nion; states
remained fully in control of what happened in their own Arctic lands and
waters. For that exact reason, the Arctic Council was never going to
prevent Russia from bringing on board new actors like BRICS states and
investors to replace fleeing Western firms.

Haavisto also worries that the Arctic will be left without a "common
goal for climate change." Here he is half right. The Arctic Council
plays a significant role facilitating scientific cooperation, and losing
access to Russian data is a major blow to understanding how the climate
crisis is unfolding in the Arctic. But already [[before]{.mark} the
[freeze, Russia did not participate]{.mark} in almost two-thirds of all
Arctic Council projects, as the A7 demonstrated when they restarted
these projects in mid-2022. Everything from environmental monitoring to
economic development could work without Russia. The Arctic 7 has shown
that they can continue most of the Arctic Council's technical work
without Russia.]{.underline} For missing climate data, the Arctic 7
governments should explore options for facilitating
scientist-to-scientist contacts until Moscow ends its war.

Arctic hands might lament the death of Arctic exceptionalism, but
suspending participation in a Russia-chaired Arctic Council was a
justified response to Russia's invasion. The Arctic could not remain an
exception to a rightful Western repudiation of cooperation with Russia
as Russia ripped through the principles underpinning the council and the
international law providing the foundation for peace in the Arctic.

Norway took the chair of the Arctic Council in May and announced its
ambition to reanimate the body in some form. To the extent the Arctic 7
can freeze Russia out of the Arctic Council while still starting or
renewing projects among themselves under the Arctic Council banner, they
should do so. But [**[the Arctic 7 should remember that the Arctic
Council's coma or death does not invite disorder.]{.mark}** That would
only come from a return to business as usual and Russia getting away
with trying to redraw settled boundaries with force]{.underline}.
Properly understanding the stakes and the council's scope puts its
importance in context---the Arctic 7 should not rush to revive the full
Arctic Council while Russia continues its war in Ukraine.

#### The Arctic Council has minimal impact on Arctic governance -- other agreements matter more

//DH

Cooperation with Russia has remained on single low-level issues for
those countries that share a border or boundary with the country,
namely, Finland, Norway and the USA in particular. In addition, the
Arctic Council has survived and will likely continue to do so. However,
[[Arctic governance does not]{.mark} stand or [fall within the Arctic
Council.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Governance is a term used to describe how to deal with problems, in this
instance in an Arctic context. [[Most governance structures are found at
the national level,]{.mark} which]{.underline} at the end of the day
[sets the rules]{.underline} and regulations [for what can be done in
the various Arctic territories]{.underline}. Some governance problems,
such as the need for a moratorium on fisheries in the Central Arctic
Ocean, are indeed raised to the international level, either because a
joint solution is needed to effectively manage or deal with a problem or
because the countries have a shared interest in collaborating and can
thus reap additional benefits through scale and spillover effects.

In this regard, [[the Arctic Council plays]{.underline}]{.mark} an
important but essentially **[[a minor role]{.underline}]{.mark}**. First
and foremost, it provides scientific advice and reports through its
different working groups, led by experts from the Arctic countries and
the six indigenous representations (and some non-Arctic representatives
too). Second, the Arctic Council and its ministerial meetings every
second year act as a lightning rod for attention to Arctic international
relations. The Arctic states have themselves promoted this forum as the
primary arena for Arctic issues because it helped convey the message of
a peaceful, stable and cooperative Arctic region.

However[, if one examines governance in the Arctic, [institutions like
the]{.mark} UN [Law of the Sea, the Polar Code, the EU, or]{.mark} even
[bilateral agreements]{.mark} between Arctic states [on coast guard
cooperation, fisheries management, and]{.mark}]{.underline} cultural and
educational [[exchange]{.mark}]{.underline} and cooperation [[tend to be
much more **impactful**]{.underline} [and
**far-reaching**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in terms of dealing with
Arctic-specific problems.]{.underline} That does not mean the Arctic
Council is irrelevant, just that it is one---albeit much talked
about---piece in a larger Arctic governance puzzle.

### Arctic Council Fails\-\--1AR

#### The Arctic Council can't enforce policies

Zhaklin V. **Yaneva**, 20**25** -- PhD from the Complutense University
of Madrid and this paper is loosely based on her doctoral thesis,
related to the cooperation in the Arctic Region and mainly within the
Arctic Council framework. She is currently employed in the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Bulgaria."THE ARCTIC COUNCIL
Advocating for Cooperation in Times of Emerging Threats" in [The
Routledge Handbook of Arctic Governance]{.underline}, accessed via

**AC = Arctic Council**

In general terms, Arctic cooperation is characterized by an intrinsic
interaction between hard law instruments, relating to the (in)direct
application of binding international treaties in the Arctic space, and
soft law mechanisms, based on the establishment--- mainly through the
scientific and political role of the AC---of new procedures that apply
specifically to the region, but are not legally binding. The Council has
become an important institution for formulating the Arctic agenda,
issuing detailed guidelines that could be useful for national and
international legislative proposals on the region. Thus, through its
activity, [the Council "shapes the rules that will guide the behaviour
of different actors]{.underline}, even in the absence of hard power or
the threat of legal repercussions" in case of non-compliance11. In that
vein, we can affirm that the creation and existence of the Council
illustrates the importance of soft power: [Although the AC does not have
regulatory powers to compel its members to implement a particular
obligation, cooperation has been increasing under the
auspices]{.underline} and supervision of the circumpolar institution. In
this line of thought, a frequently discussed problem is that [[the
AC]{.mark} remains a decision-shaping rather than a decision-making
institution as it **[lacks a mandate to]{.mark}** formulate, implement,
monitor **or [enforce any policies]{.mark}** or regulations [upon its
Member States]{.mark}]{.underline}.
