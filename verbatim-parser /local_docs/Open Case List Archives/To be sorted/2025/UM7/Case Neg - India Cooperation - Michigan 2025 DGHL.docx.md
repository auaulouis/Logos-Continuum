Meanwhile the role of Asian states in Arctic governance has been a
pressing issue as China, India, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea have
all been vying for greater influence over Arctic regional affairs since
their acceptance to the Arctic Council as observer states in 2013. To
this end, they have all increased their commercial presence in the
Arctic over the past decade by investing in various endeavors ranging
from (maritime) capacity building initiatives to extractive projects.
While Arctic states have been receptive to the inflow of capital, they
have proven less enthusiastic about the participation of these Asian
states in agenda-setting practices and in the formation of rules of
conduct in the region. Instead, they have preferred to retain a high
degree of exclusivity in policymaking rights and privileges and limited
the role of non-Arctic nations in the Council's processes.

In the wake of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, this state of affairs
could undergo a drastic change. After an initial pause, the Arctic
Council has now resumed its activities without Moscow. [As Western
sanctions cut Moscow off from the global market, Russia
will]{.underline} likely [be inclined to work more]{.underline} with
non-Arctic states, especially [China and India, in pursuit of its
regional developmental goals]{.underline}. A joint initiative in the
Arctic from these three states is even [more probable due to their
shared strategic interests in the region's vast resources]{.underline}.
More importantly, the three states represent what some label as grieved
civilizational powers. As such, [their cooperation could be facilitated
by their shared frustration with]{.underline} what they consider [a
Western double standard in imposing sanctions and]{.underline} the
West's [selective adherence to international law;]{.underline} a
grievance that [explains why both China and India have]{.underline} so
far [refused to]{.underline} outright [condemn the invasion of
Ukraine.]{.underline}

Russia began the securitization of its Arctic economy in 2014 when
Western powers imposed heavy sanctions on the country for its illegal
annexation of Crimea. By prioritizing self-reliance and partnership with
Asian countries over the West, Moscow sought to insulate the development
of its Arctic regions and resources from Western sanctions---an
initiative that seems to have had mixed results. On the one hand, [China
and India]{.underline} have [continued to purchase Russian oil and seem
adamant to work with]{.underline} the [Russia]{.underline}n Federation
[in executing]{.underline} its [Arctic hydrocarbon]{.underline}
developmental [plans]{.underline}. On the other hand, Japan and South
Korea have decided to join forces with the West in enforcing sanctions
against Russia. Moreover, and in what could be a major blow to Moscow's
Arctic LNG 2 project, South Korean shipbuilder, Deawoo,
has cancelled the construction of an already ordered Liquefied Natural
Gas (LNG) carrier.

FALSE DAWN

[Analysts have divined evidence of India's attempt to **distance itself
from Russia** in the words and deeds of its officials]{.underline}. They
point to Modi's verbal confrontation with Putin in September, some votes
opposing Russia at the United Nations, and the [**cancellation of
billions** of dollars in Russian weapons purchases, including fighter
aircraft and helicopters. However intriguing, these developments **do
not**, in truth, **indicate that** New Delhi has taken a definitive turn
away from Moscow.]{.underline}

The Washington Post cast Modi's comments to Putin in September as a
"rebuke." Yet Modi's statement was less an admonishment of Russian
policy and more an expression of concern about rising food and energy
prices. Several Indian assessments have cautioned against
overinterpreting Modi's comments, pointing out their consistency with
past Indian positions criticizing the war's costly impacts on the global
South. India did side with the West on some procedural votes at the UN,
such as the one in September to allow Ukrainian President Volodymyr
Zelensky to address the UN General Assembly. But India reverted to
abstention in a more substantive October vote on Russia's illegal
annexation of four Ukrainian provinces.

[It is also true that]{.underline}, earlier this year, [India
**canceled** several agreed purchases of Russian weapons]{.underline},
such as the MiG-29 fighter plane. But that decision had less to do with
Russia than with trying to boost domestic arms production. The Indian
government had already planned to scrap those deals (along with the
purchase of Boeing P-8I aircraft from the United States) months before
Russia's [invasion to instead **transition to using indigenous

air defenses, stealth frigates, and nuclear submarines, which will keep
New Delhi tethered to Moscow for decades. In truth, India **cannot break

geopolitical calculations, supports much of India's military arsenal,

October 15, 2024

Last week, [Russia and India held]{.underline} important [talks to
explore new areas of cooperation]{.underline}, with a particular [focus
on joint Arctic]{.underline} shipbuilding [projects]{.underline}.

[Russia's state nuclear agency,]{.underline} Rosatom,
[announced]{.underline} key developments after the first meeting of a
working group focused on [collaboration on the Arctic's Northern Sea
Route (NSR).]{.underline}

The meeting took place in New Delhi and brought together senior
officials from both countries, including Vladimir Panov, Rosatom's
special representative for Arctic development, and Rajesh Kumar Sinha,
India's Deputy Minister of Ports, Shipping and Waterways.

The [discussions highlighted]{.underline} several potential areas of
[cooperation, such as boosting Russian-Indian cargo transit through the
NSR and creating]{.underline} training [programs]{.underline} for Indian
sailors to navigate the icy Arctic waters.

One of [the most promising outcomes]{.underline} was the discussion [of
a draft intergovernmental memorandum of understanding. This]{.underline}
document [could set the stage for more formalized
cooperation]{.underline} between the two nations in the shipping sector,
potentially paving the way for more joint initiatives in the future.

Rosatom has played a crucial role in the development of the Northern Sea
Route since being appointed its infrastructure operator by the Russian
government in 2018. The company oversees a federal project aimed at
turning the NSR into a year-round transportation corridor that connects
Europe, Russia, and the Asia-Pacific region. This route is becoming
increasingly strategic, as it offers a much shorter maritime link
between Eurasia's western regions and the Asia-Pacific, significantly
reducing shipping times.

[The]{.underline} growing [importance of the NSR is closely tied to
Russia's broader strategy to find alternative]{.underline} trade [routes
in response to Western sanctions imposed due to the ongoing Ukraine
conflict. With climate change making the Arctic waters]{.underline} more
navigable [during certain months,]{.underline} the [NSR is emerging as a
more viable option]{.underline} for freight transport, particularly for
routes between Northern Europe and Asia.

Accessed 7-2-2025; RS\]

[Russia's Energy Pivot: **India Replaces China as Key Energy
Ally**]{.underline}

[Russia's post-oil survival strategy is **undergoing a decisive
shift.**]{.underline} As Urals crude hovers around US\$53 per barrel,
well below the fiscal breakeven of US\$69.70, Moscow is under immense
pressure. While China played a key role in absorbing Russian crude oil
in the early years of sanctions, the limitations of that partnership are
becoming evident. However, Moscow's twin-track energy strategy is now
encountering friction, especially as China diversifies its energy
sources and toughens its bargaining stance on LNG. In this context, New
Delhi is emerging both as a major buyer and Russia's most strategic
energy partner.

China's Waning Leverage vs India's Rising Importance

[Since 2020, China has been Russia's most important energy
customer.]{.underline} In 2024, Russia became China's largest crude
supplier, with volumes reaching over 108 million metric tons (MMT),
20--22 percent of China's total oil imports. Yet this relationship is
tilted heavily in Beijing's favour.

[**India's crude imports** from Russia **reached near 2 million barrels
per day** in April 2025, marking a two-year high and solidifying India
as Russia's largest oil buyer]{.underline}.

[Projects such as the Power of Siberia 2 pipeline, which **could send 50
billion cubic meters of gas to China annually, are stalled**. This is in
contrast to the relative success of Russia\'s crude oil exports, which
continue to find stable markets in China─albeit at steep discounts─and
increasingly, in India.]{.underline}

China is demanding gas prices to match Russia's domestic levels, far
below the rates Moscow once charged European buyers. While Russian LNG
exports to China rose 3.3 percent in 2024 to 8.3 MMT, Russia still
trails Australia and Qatar in Beijing's LNG hierarchy.

Chinese firms such as CNPC hold major stakes in Russian energy ventures,
including 20 percent in Yamal LNG and 10 percent in Arctic LNG 2. This
financial leverage enables China to negotiate steep discounts. With
Urals crude being sold to China at US\$53--61 per barrel, Beijing's
dominant position erodes Moscow's strategic autonomy.

As China increasingly leverages its dominant position in this scenario,
[India **has quietly expanded its role** through a commercially
pragmatic and mutually beneficial approach. As of early May 2025,
India's crude imports from Russia reached nearly 2 million barrels per
day (mb/d) in April, marking a two-year high and solidifying India as
Russia's largest oil buyer.]{.underline}

[India's refining sector has turned **this partnership into a strategic
advantage**.]{.underline} With robust diesel and jet fuel margins,
Indian refiners not only import Russian crude but also re-export refined
products to Europe, effectively cushioning the blow of Western sanctions
on Moscow. This re-routing ensures a flow of foreign currency to Russia
without the baggage of political concessions.

Unlike China, [India does not seek equity stakes or dictate pricing. Its
**energy deals are commercial, transparent**, and anchored in mutual
benefit.]{.underline}

Unlike China, India's energy deals are commercial, transparent, and
anchored in mutual benefit. Even amid global scrutiny, Indian refiners
and Russian insurers are coordinating marine insurance coverage to keep
oil flowing, demonstrating the adaptability between the two eastern
powers, Russia and India, bypassing the traditional Western-dominated
systems.

From Oil to Strategic Ventures

Since the onset of Western sanctions in 2022, [India's imports of
Russian crude have surged over tenfold]{.underline}, with Russian oil
now accounting for more than 30 percent of India's crude basket,
compared to near-zero before the Ukraine war. But the partnership is no
longer limited to oil barrels. [At the recent India-Russia Business
Dialogue, six joint ventures were announced, spanning shipbuilding,
pharmaceuticals, and critical minerals. One standout development is the
collaboration on small modular reactors (SMRs).]{.underline}

[As part of these SMR ventures, Maharashtra signed an MoU with ROSATOM
to develop India's first thorium-based SMR. This clean, flexible nuclear
technology could diversify both countries' energy portfolios, offering a
hedge against the declining role of hydrocarbons.]{.underline}

MUDDLING THROUGH

India's military depends on Russia for most of its combat and strike
capabilities[. The invasion of Ukraine created a **supply shock** to the
servicing of India's largely Russian arsenal]{.underline} by limiting or
delaying access to spare parts and upgrades. [India **did
not**]{.underline}, however[, **take any drastic measures** to
accelerate the gradual diversification of its military
equipment]{.underline} by cutting its use of Russian materiel and
purchasing replacements. Although India remains concerned about the poor
performance of some Russian weapons platforms, [as well as its ability
to **access spare parts**, it has **no plans to rapidly overhaul** its
Russian weapons systems by turning to **alternative foreign
suppliers**]{.underline}. With India's borders enjoying a modicum of
stability after border crises in 2019 and 2020, Indian strategists can
countenance lower operational readiness over the next few years, even if
that means living with some vulnerability.

In the near to medium term, [India plans to **muddle through** with
existing stocks, drawing from the secondary market of Russian
parts]{.underline} and leaning on its own domestic production of
military equipment[. It will]{.underline} work with Russia to fulfill
outstanding delivery commitments and [**selectively** pursue contracts
with Western defense companies that **bolster** the **indigenous**
Indian defense industry.]{.underline} [In the long term, India wants to
become largely **self**-**sufficient** in its defense needs and **no
longer be dependent on external** suppliers.]{.underline}

[Even as India aims to diversify its arsenal and achieve
self-sufficiency over the **next 20 years**, it will **need Russia** for
several critical technologies]{.underline}. India's [Sukhoi-30 fighter
aircraft will remain the **backbone** of its air force for several
decades]{.underline} but [**cannot be maintained or upgraded** without
crucial Russian contributions]{.underline}. India's most significant
defense export---the [BrahMos antiship cruise missile]{.underline}
currently marketed to Southeast Asian countries to deter China---[uses
**Russian** propulsion technology]{.underline}. As long as the Kremlin
controls critical elements of India's advanced weapons systems---most
notably India's fighter aircraft, cruise missiles, and submarines---it
wields considerable leverage over New Delhi.

### 1NC---US-India Defense Coop Now 

#### US-India defense coop is at the highest possible level because of differences in defense ideology

At the Shangri-La dialogue in Singapore last week, U[.S. Secretary of
Defense Pete Hegseth said that the United States would be **expanding
its defense partnership** with India]{.underline}. His statement was [in
line with U.S. policy over the last two decades]{.underline}, which,
irrespective of the party in power, [has sought to cultivate India as a
serious defense partner]{.underline}.

The [U.S.-India defense partnership has come a long way]{.underline}.
Beginning in 2001, the [United States and India moved from little
defense cooperation or coordination to significant gestures that would
**lay the foundation** of the robust defense partnership that exists
today]{.underline}---such as India offering access to its facilities
after 9/11 to help the United States launch operations in Afghanistan or
the 123 Agreement in 2005 that paved the way for civil nuclear
cooperation between the two countries. In the United States, [there is
**bipartisan agreement** that a strong defense partnership with India is
vital for its Indo-Pacific strategy and containing China]{.underline}.
[In India, too, there is **broad political support** for its strategic
partnership with the United States given its immense wariness about its
fractious border relationship with China.]{.underline} Consequently, the
[U.S.-India bilateral relationship has heavily emphasized security, with
even trade tilting toward defense goods]{.underline}.

Despite the massive changes to the relationship in the last few years,
and both countries' desire to develop ever-closer defense ties,
[differences between the **United States and India
remain**]{.underline}. A [significant part of this has to do with the
differing norms that underpin the defense interests of each
country.]{.underline}

Sameer Lalwani (Washington, DC) argues that the two countries differ in
their thinking about deterrence, and that this is evident in [three
categories crucial to defense: capability, geography, and
interoperabilit]{.underline}y. When it comes to increasing material
capabilities, for example, India prioritizes domestic economic
development, including developing indigenous capabilities (i.e., its
domestic defense-industrial sector). With regard to geography, for
example[, the United States and its Western allies think of crises, such
as Ukraine, in terms of **global domino effects**; India, in contrast,
**thinks regionally**, and confines itself to the effects on its
neighborhood and borders]{.underline} (and, as the recent crisis with
Pakistan shows, India continues to face threats on its border, widening
the geographic divergence with the United States). And India's
commitment to strategic autonomy means the two countries remain far
apart on the kind of interoperability required by modern military
operations. Yet there is also reason for optimism about the relationship
as those differences are largely surmountable.

### 1NC---No India-Russia Relations 

#### Structural factors make the partnership unsustainable.

Diplomacy and Disarmament at Jawaharlal Nehru University and the founder

think tank, "Russia Is Losing India,"
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/india/russia-losing-india\]

DRIFTING APART

India's slow but steady decoupling from Russia does not come as a
surprise to close observers of the relationship. Despite a long history
of friendship and a great deal of cooperation dating back to the Cold
War era, the two are no longer natural partners. [**India** and
**Russia** are **moving away** from each other not because they want to
but because they **cannot help** but do so]{.underline}.

Today, there is [**little** that **connects** the two
countries]{.underline}. [India has **limited incentive** to remain
closely tethered to Russia]{.underline}, outside of the legacy
relationship based on their [now-shrinking **defense
trade**]{.underline}. In 2021, trade between India and Russia was worth
around \$13 billion. Fewer than 30,000 Indians live in Russia, and fewer
Indians speak Russian than did during the peak of Soviet-India
friendship during the Cold War. By comparison, India-U.S. trade totaled
\$157 billion in 2021, and 4.2 million people of Indian origin reside in
the United States.

Not only is there [little people-to-people contact between India and
Russia and **minimal trade**]{.underline}, but the [new generation of
India's **strategic community** has **little interest** in
**Russia**]{.underline}. The pool of Russia specialists in India is
shrinking. [India's **old elite** was **more supportive** of
Russia]{.underline}, but [**younger Indian leaders** and thinkers have
less reason to be inclined toward **Moscow**]{.underline}---a process
that began at the end of the Cold War and is even more pronounced today.
Russia, for more and more Indians, is a friend whose utility is in
terminal decline. When Indians think of their strategic partnerships,
Russia is referred to in the past tense, and the United States in the
future.

India and Russia are no longer natural partners.

[India's dependence on Russia will continue to **wane over time** as it
leans on **alternate military suppliers** such as **France**,
**Israel**, and the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}. Even though U.S.
weapons often come with conditions (unlike Russian or even French
weapons sales), growing diplomatic trust between India and the United
States is likely to lead to ever closer defense ties and burgeoning
purchase agreements.

One crucial area where Russia was useful to India was at the UN Security
Council, where it often assisted India in opposing the adoption of
sanctions or other resolutions. But many analysts and former
policymakers in New Delhi today think that France or even the United
States could help India pursue its interests at the Security Council.
Furthermore, India could grow concerned that China may influence a
weakened Russia's votes on the Security Council. China and Russia are
closer than ever, and it is [**only a matter of time** before China
begins **exerting some influence** on the **independence** of a
war-fatigued **Russia's foreign policy**]{.underline}. If skirmishes
between Indian and Chinese forces recur in the Himalayan borderlands,
for instance, China could put pressure on Russia to stop providing
diplomatic backing or arms and ammunition to India.

[Russia's **invasion of Ukraine** has quickened the evolution of a more
**definitive realignment**]{.underline}, with [Russia and China drawing
closer and India drifting to the **West**. **Even if** Moscow and New
Delhi make a **serious effort** to **sustain** their relationship,
**structural constraints** such as growing Sino-Russian ties, closer
India-US relations, and the **increasing geopolitical incompatibility**
between the two sides are **bound to drive a wedge** between
them]{.underline}.

Friends with Limits

[Despite]{.underline} the robust [military ties between **Russia** and
**India**]{.underline}, [there are]{.underline} [**clear limitations**
to their relationship]{.underline}, both from New Delhi's side and
Moscow's. [**India's** ceiling is largely driven by its desire to
**diversify** its **weapons sources**]{.underline}. India's [goal of
**strategic autonomy** requires access to a **broad range** of military
partners]{.underline} as well as a more capable indigenous defense
industry. India, therefore, is [**hesitant** to tie itself too closely
to any **single source**]{.underline}, [especially one as troubled as
**Russia**]{.underline}.

The [war in **Ukraine** has highlighted other risks of **over-reliance**
on **Russian** arms as well]{.underline}. Some prominent Indian analysts
voiced concerns about the performance of Russian weaponry in the
conflict. "How come the Patriots took down the Kinzhal missiles that
were touted as invincible? How come Russian ships are becoming such easy
targets from a country that does not have a navy? Its spy planes such as
A-50s, and fighter jets such as Sukhois have been downed so
effectively," one Indian defense analyst noted. Moreover, deliveries to
India appear to have been delayed due to COVID-19 supply chain
disruptions and the war in Ukraine. Russia delayed production and
delivery of its stealth frigates, nuclear-power attack submarine, S-400
regiments, and AK-203 assault rifles to India. In the immediate
aftermath of the Russian invasion, fearing plodding production, India
also backed out of deals to purchase Mi-17 V5 helicopters and Kamov
Ka-31 airborne early warning helicopters.

Additionally, assuming India [continues to seek a stronger **strategic
partnership** with the **U**nited **S**tates]{.underline}, it will need
to weigh any new ties to Moscow against Washington's likely response.
Under the Biden administration, India ran the risk of antagonizing a
White House eager to put the screws to Russia and to defend Ukraine.
[Under the Trump administration, **India** runs a greater risk of
**disappointing** a president who prioritizes trade balances and is keen
on selling more **U.S.-made arms** to the world]{.underline}. Either
way, India faces a tough balancing act.

Finally, purchasing new Russian systems could exacerbate problems of
interoperability across the Indian armed forces where U.S. and European
systems are also used, given their incompatible communications and
software protocols. Similarly, Washington --- already somewhat wary
about sharing certain types of technology and intelligence with New
Delhi because of its close ties with Moscow --- will likely continue to
restrict cooperation, especially if India doubles down on buying new
Russian arms.

For Russia, the ceiling of its sales to India is set by the Kremlin's
relationship with China. Today, Beijing is Moscow's most important
strategic partner and the second-largest purchaser of Russian arms,
including advanced capabilities such as the Sukhoi Su-35 combat aircraft
and S-400 air defense systems. Over the past 20 years, 30 percent of all
Russian arms exports went to India, while 20 percent went to China. The
story has remained fairly constant, even as China's total arms imports
have declined while its domestic arms industry has grown. Over the past
five years, India's share of total Russian arms exports rose to 34
percent, but China's still amounted to 18 percent. Although Russia's
arms industry is most reliant on Indian purchases, it is also dependent
on Chinese purchases. India is a significant buyer, but its resources
are limited and cannot singlehandedly support Russia's entire defense
industry. This leaves Moscow vulnerable to Beijing's pressure.

[Russia will therefore likely **remain cautious** about entering into
**new defense deals** with **India** that might antagonize
China]{.underline}. So far, Beijing does not appear to have used its
considerable leverage against Moscow to halt arms transfers to New
Delhi. But Russia and India's agreements for advanced capabilities all
pre-date Beijing and Moscow's "no limits" friendship (the frigate deal
was inked in 2016, the S-400s in 2018).

prime minister, Mr. Modi [**elevated** the trip's
significance]{.underline}. Thanks to partially overlapping dates with
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's summit in Washington, [Mr.
Modi's Moscow sojourn appeared designed to **undermine** the Biden
administration's efforts to **isolate** Russia after its invasion of
Ukraine]{.underline}.

To make matters worse, images of Mr. Modi hugging Vladimir Putin, riding
in a golf cart around the Russian strongman's private residence, and
accepting Russia's highest civilian award---the Order of St. Andrew the
Apostle---coincided with horrific pictures of a Russian strike on a
children's hospital in Kyiv. In a meeting with Mr. Putin, [Mr. Modi said
that "when innocent children are killed, the heart bleeds and that pain
is very terrifying." But this oblique criticism, which didn't **directly
blame** Russia for the attack, did nothing to calm critics.]{.underline}

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted after the hospital strike
that the Modi-Putin hug was "a huge disappointment and a devastating
blow to peace efforts." Former Trump national security adviser H.R.
McMaster tweeted that it's "time to reassess the relationship with India
based on much lower expectations."

[In a rare note of public caution, U.S.]{.underline} Ambassador to India
Eric Garcetti said that the [U.S.-India **relationship was "not yet deep
enough**" to be taken for granted]{.underline}. The British TV
personality Piers Morgan was blunter. "Shame on you," he tweeted, while
sharing a video of Mr. Modi accepting the award from Mr. Putin.

Why would India risk upsetting its Western partners to please Moscow?
The reasons are complex. As Indian foreign minister Subrahmanyam
Jaishankar has pointed out, [India views the Eurasian landmass as
dominated by three major powers: China, India and Russia. India's
longstanding rivalry with China]{.underline}---including border tensions
that have lasted more than four years---[**drives its efforts to prevent
Moscow from drawing closer to Beijing**.]{.underline}

India's dependence on Russian arms looms large in the relationship. The
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute estimates that only 36%
of Indian arms imports between 2019 and 2023 were from Russia, down from
76% between 2009 and 2013. But India's large inventory of Soviet and
Russian weapons means it's still dependent on Moscow for spare parts and
ammunition. India has saved about \$13 billion by buying steeply
discounted Russian oil since 2022, according to ICRA, a rating agency.
India also sourced about a quarter of its imported fertilizer from
Russia last year.

[Domestically, India hasn't **fully shed** its old Cold War habit of
measuring its independence by its ability to thumb its nose at
America.]{.underline} Even today, some of India's foreign-policy
commentators view Russia in a sentimental light, as the friend that
helped India stare down an unfriendly U.S. in the 1971 India-Pakistan
war, the conflict that led to the birth of Bangladesh. [Dealing with
Russia can also **seem simpler** than dealing with the U.S. Mr. Putin
raises no **pesky questions** about democratic backsliding or human
rights, and the Russian media tamely takes its cues from the
Kremlin]{.underline}.

Russophile Indian pundits hold an almost mystical view of Russia as an
eternal great power. Indian foreign-policy scholar Zorawar Daulet Singh
says Russia is "too proud, too independent and too militarily powerful
to ever submit to China." Mr. Jaishankar, the foreign minister, calls
India's "special and privileged strategic partnership" with Russia the
"one constant in world politics."

[The trouble with these formulations is simple: They're untrue. India
**may wish to prevent** Russia from becoming a Chinese satellite, but
New Delhi **lacks the economic and technological heft** to stop it. The
Russian invasion of Ukraine **has already made Russia too dependent** on
China to be a reliable long-term partner for India.]{.underline}

**[It would be easy to become pessimistic about Arctic military

committed to a rules-based approach]{.mark} to security.]{.underline}**
**[Worries]{.underline}** **[about the potential for

everywhere]{.mark} in the region]{.underline}**; international law is

exhibiting its propensity toward military displays, in the Arctic,
Russia is playing a constructive role in maintaining regional
stability]{.underline}**. **[[Russia]{.mark} is intently [focused on
regional security]{.mark} in part because it sees in the Arctic an
opportunity [to]{.mark} [recapture]{.mark} the former [influence]{.mark}
and superpower standing that it enjoyed during the Cold
War]{.underline}**. Russia strategically and successfully takes
advantage of its dominant geographic posi- tion surrounding 170 degrees
of the Arctic Circle, and its energy and economic presence in the region
dwarfs that of all other Arctic states combined. **[[The U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and Russia enjoy a pragmatic working

rescue and oil spill preparedness and response]{.underline}**. Now the
United States and Russia are leading efforts to adopt agreements on
marine pol- lution prevention and marine scientific research in the
region. **[The [remoteness and physical isolation]{.mark} of the Arctic

states find comfort in their exclusive and shared geogra-
phy]{.underline}**. **[They are united to resist efforts from outside
the region that might erode,]{.underline}** let alone upend, **[the

in common is a rather circumspect view of states from outside the region
that seek to play a greater role in the Arctic. Furthermore**[, all
Arctic [states are invested in a rules-based approach]{.mark} to
stability and security,]{.underline}** based principally on the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).**[11 The
consensus]{.underline}** among Arctic states that UNCLOS **[is [the
framework]{.mark} for distribution of rights and duties in the region
[minimizes risk]{.mark} of conflict over maritime boundaries. Every
Arctic nation is a party to the treaty except the United States,
which]{.underline}**, since 1983, **[has made a commitment to adhere to
most provi- sions of the treaty]{.underline}**.12 **[Finally, the
likelihood of [conflict]{.mark} breaking out over the region's vast

Continental Shelf (**[[CLCS]{.underline}]{.mark}**), an independent
international technical body estab- lished by UNCLOS. **[Every Arctic
coastal state except the United States has submitted at least partial
information for consideration of a claim to sovereign rights over seabed
riches of oil, gas and minerals]{.underline}**. To the extent that
overlapping maritime claims exist, the four other Arctic Ocean coastal
states, including Russia, are proceeding with deliberate professionalism
in appropriate bilateral forums and with the CLCS to resolve them.13
I**[n 2010, Russia and Norway, for example, signed a treaty to resolve
their 40-year disagreement over maritime resource boundaries in the
Barents Sea]{.underline}**. More recently, Denmark and Canada
established maritime delimitation in the Lincoln Sea, north- west of
Greenland. Similarly, Canada and the United States are exploring a way
ahead to resolve a benign disagreement over a single boundary line in
the Beaufort Sea.

### 1NC---Indian Soft Power Fails

#### Indian leadership fails.

**Aiyar '18** \[Swaminathan; January 27; Consulting Editor of the
Economic Times; TOI Opinion, "Forget Davos Rhetoric: 'Protectionist'
India is Nowhere Near a Global Leader,"
https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/Swaminomics/forget-davos-rhetoric-protectionist-india-is-nowhere-near-a-global-leader/;
Accessed 7.5.25\]

At a time when the US, dominator of the 20th century, has switched from
globalisation and free trade to 'America First', Narendra
**[Modi]{.underline}** emphasised the very opposite at the Davos meeting
of the World Economic Forum. "Many countries are becoming inward focused
and globalisation is shrinking, and such tendencies can't be considered
a lesser risk than terrorism or climate change." He [was echoing the
sentiments of **Xi**]{.underline} Jinping of China.

Modi's categorical assertion is welcome. Some theorists are already
speculating that China and India will fill the vacuum created by Trump's
retreat. I was asked on TV whether India was emerging as a global leader
with a global vision for the 21st century.

Absolutely no, I replied. [India is still a poor, **under-developed**
country, **internally riven**]{.underline} over what social and economic
vision it should have for itself, [with barely a **thought**
about]{.underline} developing a new vision for [the
**world**]{.underline}. Regardless of Modi's defense of globalization at
Davos, [India is]{.underline} instinctively
**[protectionist]{.underline}**. Unlike a true globalizer, it does not
see imports as a welcome way to get cheap goods from the rest of the
world: it sees them as a threat to Indian employment, production and
prosperity. [It has long been]{.underline} world number one in
anti-dumping duties, [keeping **company** with]{.underline} Donald
[**Trump**.]{.underline}

Even as Modi extols the virtues of open economies at Davos, he has
imposed a series of import duties on electronic goods to protect and
build the domestic industry. This, in economic jargon, is called
"industrial policy" or "infant industry protection". Much lobbying is in
progress to extend such protection to solar energy equipment, which,
like electronics, is an area where [India]{.underline} simply [cannot
compete with China]{.underline}. Such a measure will echo Trump's recent
imposition of a 30% tariff on Chinese solar panels.

The underlying logic is that China first used protection and subsidies
to create enormous factories, reaping scale economies that soon made it
a very low-cost global hub of production. India's electronics and solar
industries say they want to follow a similar path, and will give up
protectionist duties once they become competitive. But there is no
guarantee of such a happy outcome, given [Indian **policy
interventions**]{.underline} that [make its **land, labor and capital**
more **costly** than]{.underline} in **[Asian
competitors]{.underline}**. The infant industry argument was used to
justify high duties in the era of import substitution. Far from creating
low-cost, competitive industries, [it created high-cost,
**uncompetitive**]{.underline} ones. India needs to end [distortions in
**land**, **labor** and **capital**]{.underline}, rather than go the
protectionist route.

It raised import duties on several agricultural items (including wheat,
sugar, dal and edible oil) last year, and banned or restricted the
export of other farm goods to raise domestic prices for the benefit of
farmers. [In forums]{.underline} like [the **WTO**, India has **long
resisted**]{.underline} agricultural **[opening up,]{.underline}**
arguing that **[India]{.underline}** is a country of poor subsistence
farmers who [cannot be left to the mercy of **international
markets**]{.underline}, and of poor consumers who require huge,
subsidized buffer stocks.

That is an acceptable stand for [a poor country]{.underline} dependent
on foreign aid and trade concessions. But a land of poor subsistence
farmers [cannot aim for **global leadership or vision**]{.underline}.
Despite becoming a member of the G-20, [India is still]{.underline} a
poor country [seeking]{.underline} special [treatment from **richer
countries**]{.underline}. Thank heavens it is no longer the biggest
beggar for foreign aid, as earlier. But [it is nowhere near **global
leadership**]{.underline} or setting standards for the world.

The problem is not just protection for electronics or solar panels, but
protection for cows. [Do **Modi** and his colleagues have any idea what
a **global laughing stock** India is]{.underline} for wanting to ban the
slaughter of even aged cattle, beating up cattle transporters, and
lynching people suspected of eating beef**[?]{.underline}** Can India
seriously sell abroad a global vision of an outright ban on cow
slaughter, building endless gaushalas, and letting stray cattle roam the
streets?

###  Exts. India Soft Power Fails 

#### Indian soft power fails.

**Mukherjee '13** \[Rohan; April; PhD at Princeton University, Assistant
Professor at London School of Economics and Political Science; SSRN
Electronic Journal, "The False Promise of India's Soft Power,"
ResearchGate,
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256057428_The_False_Promise_of_India\'s_Soft_Power;
Accessed 7.5.25\]

The central empirical puzzle of this paper, as discussed above, is the
question of why a state such as [India]{.underline}, [in possession of
considerable **soft power resources**, has been unable to **wield** them
**effectively**]{.underline}. Measuring the impact of soft power,
however, is an inherently fraught enterprise. Soft power - and public
diplomacy, by extension - is not aimed at specific goals, individuals,
or events. [Rather, it is aimed at creating an enabling **political
environment** for a country's **foreign policy**]{.underline}. In other
words, it has "milieu goals" (Melissen 2005, p. 12). Although Nye (1990)
refers to soft power as the "second aspect" of power - the first being
hard power - it is closer to what Lukes (1974) calls the "third
dimension" of power, whereby the power-holder's aim is to influence the
preference formation process of another actor in such a way as to
exclude the other's real interest from the political process altogether
(as opposed to issuing a command or excluding the other's preferences
from the agenda). This characteristic of soft power makes its impacts
extremely difficult to measure - not only are soft power resources
intangible, their impacts are also intangible in addition to being
diffuse and long-term in nature. This is why many analysts rely on
public opinion surveys or indicators that suggest the workings of soft
power but cannot directly observe them.

Unfortunately for India, public [opinion in other nations has not been
as kind as **Delhi** would have **hoped for**]{.underline}. Hymans
(2009, p. 256) notes studies that show that since the late 1970s,
[Americans have evinced moderately **negative feelings** toward
India]{.underline}. In a 2006 survey by the Chicago Council on Global
Affairs, they expressed slightly negative feelings - a score of 46 out
of 100 (down from 49 in 1978), where 50 was a neutral score (ibid.). In
the same survey, 42 percent of respondents said that the United Nations
Security Council's membership should not be expanded to include India (a
major goal of Indian foreign policy), while only 29 percent and 32
percent opposed Japan and Germany respectively. 71 percent of
respondents opposed the highly publicized agreement on civilian nuclear
cooperation between India and the US; 40 percent favored the use of US
troops to maintain peace between India and Pakistan (a decidedly adverse
outcome for Indian foreign policy); 47 percent said India practiced
unfair trade with the US; 54 percent opposed a US-India free trade
agreement; 66 percent opposed the purchase of a controlling interest by
Indian firms in American companies; 69 percent viewed a future
militarily powerful India as a negative development; and only 49 percent
trusted India to act responsibly in world affairs. Within Asia, a Pew
Global Attitudes survey in 2012 found both Chinese and Pakistani
perceptions of India declining between 2006 and 2012, while Japan's
perceptions improved (Fig. 1 in Appendix). In India's immediate
neighborhood, a 2012 qualitative study highlighted considerable
variance: analysts from Afghanistan and Bhutan concluded that their
respective nations' perceptions of India were positive, [while those
from Bangladesh and Sri Lanka complained of a "**trust deficit**" and
those from Pakistan and Nepal criticized India's "**big brother**"
attitude toward their **nations**]{.underline}. Nonetheless, [a number
of these observers cited **long-standing cultural relations** between
their **nation** and **India**]{.underline} (including the popularity of
Bollywood films), which arguably has an ameliorative effect on otherwise
problematic perceptions (Gateway House 2012).

Aside from opinion polls, one can also look at the impact of a country's
culture and domestic institutions by measuring the numbers of
individuals who want to visit the country for education, immigration and
tourism. In the case of foreign students in India (Fig. 2 in Appendix)
the numbers have fluctuated over time, to the extent that there were
more foreign students in India in 1986 than there were at any time
between 1996 and 2003. The [composition of **foreign students** in India
also provides an **indication** of where India's soft power may be
**having** an **impact**]{.underline}. For the period from 2005 till
2008 (for which data are available) the [countries of origin were
**overwhelmingly** from the Middle East and South Asia, with a
smattering of **African countries**]{.underline} (Fig. 3 in Appendix).
This suggests that India's allure does not expand much beyond Asia, a
[finding that is **especially stark** when one considers the
**countries** to which Indian students most frequently go for **higher
education**: **America**, **England**, **Australia**, **New Zealand**
and **Canada**]{.underline}. The stock of international migrants in
India presents a similar picture as above, with 98 percent of the 5.3
million migrants living in India in 2010 coming from neighboring
countries (Fig. 4 in Appendix).

Tourism is a potential bright spot for India - for the years that data
are available, we find a sizeable increase of arrivals in India of 24%
between 2007 and 2011, with the bulk of tourists arriving from Europe,
the Americas and East Asia. However, even in the realm of tourism, India
does not score highly relative to other countries. In a 2012 ranking of
country brands in tourism, India came in 23rd, behind China, Turkey and
Russia (Table 1 in Appendix). This finding points to a larger challenge
for India's soft power - although the influx of international students,
migrants, and tourists has been growing over time, it is still far short
of the pull that other major powers exert on these international flows.
A similar picture emerges when one looks at India's relative
attractiveness as a destination for investors, a metric that speaks to
the quality of India's domestic institutions, political culture, and
business climate. In a ranking of country brands in the realm of Foreign
Direct Investment (FDI), India came in 15th, after China, Brazil and
Turkey (Table 2 in Appendix).

India's overall image in the world suffers from similar problems. [A
2012 ranking of **country brands** based on a composite index of a
**country's governance**, investment climate, human capital, growth,
sustainability and influence put India in **42nd place** out of 118
countries]{.underline} - [an **uncomfortable spot** for an aspiring
great power with much vaunted soft power reserves]{.underline}. The same
report also listed a set of fifteen countries that showed future promise
on the metrics listed above. India came in 13th on this list, behind
countries such as Colombia, Thailand, Malaysia and Chile (Table 3 in
Appendix). And finally, in a 2011 study aimed at ranking the world's top
30 countries in terms of soft power (McClory 2011) - a composite index
of the quality of government, culture, diplomacy, education, and
business/innovation (based on objective measures and subjective
assessments of an expert panel) - India ranked 27, slightly ahead of
Russia and just behind Israel (Fig.5 in Appendix). It appears therefore
that although India's soft power has had beneficial effects in absolute
terms over time - as measured by the inflow of foreign students,
tourists and migrants - its relative standing among nations as well as
perceptions of India among the citizens of other countries still leave
much to be desired.

4\. Explaining India's Under-Performance

Historically, India was a rather adept wielder of soft power. The long
struggle against British colonialism spearheaded by internationally
renowned leaders such as Jawaharlal Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi had earned
India much goodwill in the years following independence in 1947 (Hymans
2009). During the 1950s and 1960s, India was able to punch above its
weight in international affairs - much as a state like Norway does
today - by projecting itself as a champion of peaceful conflict
resolution in forums such as the United Nations (Purushothaman 2010).
Moreover, Nehru's leadership of the Non-Alignment Movement (NAM), which
eschewed the hard power politics of the Cold War, won India many friends
and admirers in the newly decolonized nations of Africa and Asia. India
in turn leveraged this recognition into a leadership role and advocated
for the rights of the Third World in multilateral settings throughout
the Cold War (Mistry 2004). To the extent that soft power was a
"strategy" adopted by Nehru and his compatriots, it was in this period a
substitute for hard power as India undertook the strenuous task of
building its economic reserves and military capabilities.

As the Cold War wore on, Nehru was succeeded eventually by his daughter
Indira Gandhi, who continued to speak the language of non-alignment and
anti-imperialism but pursued policies that were far more "realist" in
substance. This had the effect of undermining some of India's
international legitimacy, especially when India concluded a defense pact
with the Soviet Union in 1971. The following two decades were also
marked by increasing Indian interventionism in the affairs of
neighboring countries, especially Sri Lanka, Nepal, and the Maldives.
The end of the Cold War, according to one scholar, marked a transition
from realpolitik back to softer forms of diplomatic intercourse for
India, largely due to the realization that hard power had failed to
achieve beneficial objectives in the preceding two decades (Wagner
2005). While this might be true in terms of grand strategy, it was
certainly not the case that any of the foreign policy gains made by
India after 1990 were due to its use of soft power. Increases in
investment from and trade with developed economies, rapprochement with
the US in the mid-2000s, and improvements in bilateral relations with
other South Asian states (including Pakistan, despite setbacks) can all
be traced back to the end of the Cold War and India's economic
liberalization and rapid growth since 1991. Soft power has been a very
minor aspect - if at all - of Indian foreign policy during this period.

India's shortcomings on this front are due to three factors. First, [its
soft power resources are not as **abundant** as **proponents** of the
idea might **suggest**]{.underline}. [India's cultural influence abroad,
while significant, **pales** in **comparison** to the cultures of the
**West** already in circulation around the globe, and **increasingly**
in comparison to **Chinese culture** in circulation in Asia and
beyond]{.underline}. Official and semi-official Indian modes of cultural
dissemination are also relatively few. For many decades, organizations
such as the Peace Corps, Alliance Francaise, the British Council, the
Goethe Institut and the Japan Foundation have been promulgating the
respective cultures of the great powers around the world. They have most
recently been joined by China's Confucius Institutes, which numbered 322
in 2011 (Na 2012). Although the Indian Council for Cultural Relations
(ICCR) has been around since 1950 with the aim of conducting activities
similar to the organizations already mentioned, as of January 2013 it
did not have more than 35 centers in foreign countries (ICCR 2013).
Moreover, it was only in 2004 that India established its Ministry of
Overseas Indian Affairs to better leverage the presence of millions of
Indians abroad, and only in 2006 that India's Ministry of External
Affairs established a division dedicated to public diplomacy (Suri
2011). In the realm of non-governmental cultural dissemination,
Bollywood has been a major force and yet despite producing more films
than Hollywood annually, the size of the former remains considerably
smaller than that of the latter: Hollywood's 2010 worldwide box office
receipts alone were estimated at \$US 31.8 billion (Verrier 2011),
whereas Bollywood's entire industry size in 2010 was estimated at \$US
1.8 billion (FICCI-KPMG 2011). Moreover, Bollywood's international
diffusion is not as strong as many analysts argue in 2011, overseas
theatrical sales constituted only eight percent of total industry
revenue (Fig. 6 in Appendix).

Although Indian culture, which is based largely on universalist and
assimilationist Hindu principles, is a potent source of attraction,
India's domestic institutions and foreign policy have mitigated this
effect on the perceptions of outsiders. In the domestic realm, [India
has done a much **poorer job** of **lifting** its **population** out of
poverty when compared to]{.underline} China. Although growth has been
impressive, [India's **per capita income** leaves it in the ranks of
countries such as **Sudan**, **Ghana**, the **Solomon Islands**, and
**Nigeria**]{.underline}. Although the government has made major strides
in liberalizing the economy, many sectors remain highly regulated.
[India's public institutions are rife with **corruption**,
**inefficiency**, **patronage** and **nepotism**]{.underline}. In
Transparency International's 2012 Corruption Perceptions Index, India
ranked 94 out of 174 countries, tied with Benin, Colombia, Greece,
Moldova, Mongolia, and Senegal (China ranked 80). In the words of one
analyst (Malone 2011, p. 38), "no amount of cultural promotion can undo
the damage internationally caused by spectacular corruption scandals" of
the sort that India has recently been witness to, and that have given
rise to an anti-state social movement that made international front page
news in 2011. In the international realm, India has not pursued the
types of cooperative and conciliatory policies required to garner soft
power resources. Particularly in the realm of global governance, [India
has been accused of being a **spoiler** on issues as diverse as
**trade**, nuclear **nonproliferation**, and **humanitarian
intervention**]{.underline}. On trade, India was held responsible to a
great extent for blocking the efforts of the great powers to rescue the
Doha Round in 2009 (Blustein 2009). On nuclear non-proliferation and
testing, India continues to be a non-signatory to the Non-Proliferation
Treaty (NPT) and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), despite
having received official recognition as a nuclear power via the 2008
agreement with the US on civilian nuclear cooperation. On humanitarian
intervention, India's approach to crises in Libya and Syria during its
recent term on the UN Security Council invited much criticism from the
West (Kelemen 2011). As with China - which itself is struggling to
increase its stock of soft power - Western observers are frequently
heard asking if India can be a "responsible stakeholder" in the
international system (Dormandy 2007). [All these factors point to
**major obstacles** in the way of India's soft power ambitions,
obstacles that might have been **irrelevant** had India been **more
powerful**]{.underline}.

Which leads to the second reason: [India is not sufficiently far along
in terms of **hard power** resources for its soft power to make a
difference in its foreign policy]{.underline}. Although in earlier
periods India had relied on soft power as a substitute for hard power,
India's attractiveness following the end of the Cold War grew precisely
because of its hard power resources, specifically economic growth, which
made India a desirable international partner. It is no coincidence that
references to India's soft power grew in frequency only after its
economic gains were consolidated and the world could be optimistic about
India's fortunes. In this sense, India's trajectory corroborates the
argument of various analysts that soft power is most effective when
backed by hard power (Tharoor 2008, Lee 2010, Blarel 2012). Soft power
is therefore not only generated by hard power (all else being equal,
other countries are drawn to success), it also facilitates the smoother
exercise of hard power by influencing the preferences of those who are
the targets of a state's foreign policy. India, however, is not at the
point yet where the precepts of Joseph Nye - which were meant largely
for an American audience - might apply. Instead, [India remains in a
transitory phase where its hard power is yet to become **preponderant**
even **regionally** to the point where it can meaningfully project its
**soft power** in order to create a political environment conducive to
its **international goals**]{.underline}. Although India is not in the
position of China, which wields considerable hard power but lacks the
required domestic legitimacy to successfully wield soft power, it does
lack many of the ingredients that make soft power a useful tool for
states such as the US and Western European countries that can rely on an
astute mix of hard and soft power to effect outcomes in world politics.
Indeed, as one scholar has argued (Hanson 2012, p. 13), [India's primary
challenge lies in]{.underline} "[gaining the **attention**, **status**,
and **recognition** of a global power]{.underline}," rather than in
battling any negative perceptions that its rise may have created in
other states (as is the case with China). [This recognition is likely to
come **only** when India addresses its **internal problems** and devises
a more **cooperative foreign** **policy** within the existing global
order]{.underline}.

The third and final cause of India's underperformance with regard to
soft power is the contested nature of India's own identity. [India's
ruling elites have yet to determine what kind of power their nation will
be as it continues to rise, and this **indecision** contributes to a
sense of **incoherence** in the portrayal of India's image to the
world]{.underline}. On the one hand, India is the second- largest
contributor to the US-led UN Democracy Fund for the promotion of
democracy around the world; on the other, it continually reiterates its
unwillingness to become an exporter of democracy, i.e. to externalize
its domestic political values. Consequently, states and peoples that
look to India for leadership on democratization - such as Myanmar - are
frequently frustrated by India's unwillingness to commit to a coherent
policy on democracy promotion. In a similar vein, [on the one

they perceive to be India's pursuit of self-interest over the interests
of developing nations, and rich countries decry India's unwillingness to
compromise on issues that might cede some ground to the developed world
(e.g. in trade negotiations). At a more basic level, India's multiple
social and political identities - Hindu, Islamic, economically liberal,
protectionist, conscientious objector to nuclear treaties, responsible
nuclear power, staunch supporter of human rights, opponent of
humanitarian intervention - continue to conflict with each other both
within Indian policymaking and in the messages and images that India
portrays to the world. [The end result is **confusion** at the receiving
end, **unpredictable** policy **shifts**, and **general distrust** among
India's interlocutors, none of which is conducive to the effective

[Brokering peace requires **patient negotiations**]{.underline}, [a

being a major **roadblock**]{.underline}.

While Modi may be issuing homilies to peace, [his party argues that
India needs to wrest back **Kashmir**]{.underline} -- by force if
necessary. Modi ordered airstrikes inside Pakistan in 2019 after a
suicide bomber killed 40 Indian paramilitary troopers in Kashmir.
[Strongly **committing** to **peace** and **opposing** the use of
**military f**orce to capture territories controlled by another country

difficult to **convince** Putin to **negotiate**]{.underline}. Given
[India\'s dependence on **Russia** for **military supplies**, **crude

Russia unchanged.

#### No one agrees.

**Lieven '25** \[Anatol; June 3; visiting professor at King\'s College

Statecraft; Responsible Statecraft, "Fresh Ukraine, Russia demands show
no interest in actual peace,"
https://responsiblestatecraft.org/ukraine-russia-memos/; Accessed
7.5.25\]

The memos presented by Ukraine and Russia at their direct talks in
Istanbul on Monday make it absolutely clear that, [absent a **strong
U.S. intervention** based on a detailed U.S. peace plan, there will be
**no peace settlement** in Ukraine]{.underline}.

It is not just that [several of the positions on both sides are
completely **mutually incompatible**]{.underline}; they suggest that at
[present **neither side** is in fact interested in an **early
peace**]{.underline}.

[The **Ukrainian** memo]{.underline}, presented before the talks, [sets
a]{.underline} "[full and **unconditional ceasefire** in the sky, on
land and at sea as a necessary background and **prerequisite** for peace
negotiations]{.underline}." [Russia has already **rejected this** and
will continue to do so --- naturally, because it would mean giving up
its **main point of leverage** for **nothing** in return]{.underline}.
Nor indeed is a fragile and unstable ceasefire in the interests of
Ukraine or the West. If Ukraine is to begin the extremely challenging
process of economic reconstruction and democratic reform, it needs a
stable and permanent peace.

[The **Ukrainian** memo also states that]{.underline} "[no restrictions
may be imposed on the number, **deployment**, or other **parameters** of
the Armed Forces of Ukraine, as well as on the deployment of troops of
**friendly foreign states** on the territory of
**Ukraine**]{.underline}." [Russia has **already stated** that it will
not under any **circumstances** accept the presence of Western troops in
**Ukraine**]{.underline} since it sees this as NATO membership in all
but name. European leaders have also stated that a European force could
only be deployed with a U.S. guarantee of support, a condition which the
Trump administration has rejected.

The Ukrainian memo continues, "some sanctions may be lifted from Russia,
but in stages and only gradually, with a mechanism for resuming
sanctions if necessary (snapback). Frozen Russian sovereign assets are
used for reconstruction or remain frozen until reparations are paid."
[Moscow will obviously not agree to a final peace without the lifting of
**sanctions** or **firm assurances** that they will be
**lifted**]{.underline}.

On one key point, the Ukrainian memo does leave room for compromise:
"Ukraine is not forced to be neutral. It can choose to be part of the
Euro-Atlantic community and move towards EU membership. Ukraine's
membership in NATO depends on consensus within the Alliance." Russia has
in fact already publicly stated that Ukraine has the sovereign right to
seek EU membership. And on NATO membership, the memo is correct that
this does not depend on Ukraine but on unanimous agreement (not merely
"consensus") among existing members.

The Trump administration (or any European government) is therefore in a
position to block Ukrainian NATO membership without reference to Kyiv.
The problem for Moscow however is that Poland and other European members
of NATO continue to declare their support for Ukraine's membership; and,
if the Democrats win the U.S. elections in 2028, they could overturn
Trump's veto. The Russians therefore are insisting on a Ukrainian
constitutional commitment to neutrality and/or a U.S.-Russian treaty to
that effect --- which Kyiv is refusing.

Meanwhile, accounts of the Russian memo presented in Istanbul, as
reported by the Russian media, include reported conditions for a
ceasefire that Moscow must know are totally unacceptable to the
Ukrainians --- though this does not in itself rule out the possibility
of Russia being willing to compromise on some of them in a final
settlement if it meets its goals in other areas --- especially bilateral
relations with Washington.

They include "complete withdrawal of the Ukrainian Armed Forces from
Donbas, Kherson and Zaporizhia regions. The second option for the
ceasefire is a ban on major redeployments of the Ukrainian Armed Forces,
the abolition of mobilization and martial law, and the cessation of
supplies of foreign weapons."

This is not going to happen, absent Russian victory on the battlefield.
Ukraine will never agree to surrender territory that it still holds, nor
will European countries agree to end all weapons supplies.

In return for a ceasefire, [the Russian memo as reported calls
for]{.underline} "[**international recognition** of these regions and
**Crimea** as part of **Russia**]{.underline}." This is utterly
pointless. [It is not just that neither **Ukraine** nor Western
countries will legally recognize the Russian annexations]{.underline};
[**China**, **India** and **South Africa** have also **refused this**,
and will continue to do so]{.underline}. The best that Russia can hope
for (as was indeed provisionally agreed at the Istanbul talks in March
2022) is to defer the legal status of these territories for future
negotiation.

[Russia's Black Sea Fleet has suffered a **heavy toll**]{.underline}.
Since February 2022, "[the Ukrainians have **destroyed** or **damaged**
roughly half of the **Russian fleet's warships**]{.underline},
[including **one submarine**, per publicly available
information]{.underline}," Business Insider reported.

The remarkable part is that Kyiv cannot rely on its own navy. Instead,
Ukraine has used unmanned maritime drones and long-range anti-ship
missiles to attack Russian warships, hinting at a new era in naval
warfare where the traditional warship is vulnerable to asymmetrical
methods.

Dmytro Pletenchuk, spokesman for the Naval Forces of the Armed Forces of
Ukraine, boasted that while the Russian Navy had about 80 warships when
the conflict began, "the Black Sea fleet operations have been greatly
complicated, if not paralyzed."

Ukrainian efforts against the Russian Navy have been worthwhile,
allowing Ukraine to resume shipping grain through the Black Sea (which
is as vital to the Ukrainian economy as it is to the international stock
of grain) and forcing the Russians to divest attention from their
homeport, Sevastopol.

"Several Russian ships that Ukraine claimed to have destroyed have yet
to be fully identified, but reportedly among them are Raptor-class
patrol boats, a BK-16 high speed assault boat, Serna-class and
Akula-class landing craft, and a Stenka-class patrol vessel," Business
Insider reported.

Here is a list of ships we know the Russians have lost since the war
began: the Saratov amphibious landing ship; the Moskva guided missile
cruiser; the Vasily Bekh rescue tugboat; the Ivan Golubets minesweeper;
the Olenegorsky Gornyak tank-landing ship; the Minsk landing vessel; and
the Rostov-on-Don submarine. There are more.

[The damage to the Russian Navy leaves Putin without the **naval
strength** associated with a **modern power**]{.underline}.

Adding to the malaise, [Russia has been **without** their **lone
aircraft carrier**]{.underline}, the Admiral Kuznetsov, since before the
war began.

Will Russia ever be able to rejuvenate its naval strength and compete as
a world power?

The Russian Military -- A Paper Tiger

[Russia's military performance during the Russo-Ukraine War suggests
that Russian **military** **prowess** was **overstated** in the years
preceding the conflict]{.underline}. [Russia]{.underline}, despite
having the world's third-largest military budget, and a relatively
sizable military, [has failed to secure **meaningful territory** while
sustaining egregious losses to **personnel** and
**equipment**]{.underline}. [The Russian Navy]{.underline}, meanwhile,
[felled by **unmanned drones** and long-range missiles, and failing to
**adapt** over the course of **two ye**ars, has outed itself as a
**mediocre fighting force**]{.underline}.

The truth seems to be that Russia is a borderline regional power. Its
invasion has failed for more than two years to secure the territory of
its most immediate neighbor, which comes to the fight significantly
undermanned and underequipped relative to its much larger enemy.

[The idea that Russia was a global power before the war, or could be a
**global power** at **any point** in the near future, seems
**outlandish**]{.underline}. With respect to the Russian Navy
specifically, rejuvenation will take time. Even under ideal
circumstances, [rebuilding and refunding **half a fleet's** worth of
**warships** would be an extremely tim**e-intensive** and **expensive
process**]{.underline}. But two years deep into a land-based war of
attrition, replenishing the navy is unlikely to be a high priority.
Don't expect the Russian Navy to be replenished adequately in the near
future.

PARIS (AP) --- [Will President Vladimir Putin pull the nuclear
trigger?]{.underline}

For Kremlin watchers trying to figure out whether the Russian leader's
nuclear threats are just bluffs, there is no more pressing \-- or tough
\-- question.

For now, [analysts cautiously suggest that the risk of Putin
using]{.underline} the world's biggest [\[his\] nuclear arsenal still
seems **low**. The CIA says it hasn't seen signs of an imminent Russian
nuclear attack.]{.underline}

Still, his vows to use " all the means at our disposal " to defend
Russia as he wages war in Ukraine are being taken very seriously. And
his claim Friday that the United States "created a precedent" by
dropping atomic bombs in World War II further cranked up the nuclear
stakes.

The White House has warned of ["**catastrophic consequences** for
Russia" if Putin goes nuclear]{.underline}.

But whether that will stay Putin's hand is anyone's guess. Nervous
Kremlin watchers acknowledge they can't be sure what he is thinking or
even if he's rational and well-informed.

The former KGB agent has demonstrated an appetite for risk and
brinkmanship. It's hard, even for Western intelligence agencies with spy
satellites, to tell if Putin is bluffing or truly intent on breaking the
nuclear taboo.

"We don't see any practical evidence today in the U.S. intelligence
community that he's moving closer to actual use, that there's an
imminent threat of using tactical nuclear weapons," CIA Director William
Burns told CBS News.

"What we have to do is take it very seriously, watch for signs of actual
preparations," Burns said.

[Kremlin watchers are scratching their heads in part because they don't
see how nuclear force could greatly help reverse Russia's military
losses in Ukraine.]{.underline}

Ukrainian troops aren't using large concentrations of tanks to wrest
back ground, and combat is sometimes for places as small as villages. So
what could Russian nuclear forces aim for with winning effect?

"[Nuclear weapons are **not a magic wand**]{.underline}," said Andrey
Baklitskiy, a senior researcher at the U.N.'s Institute for Disarmament
Research, who specializes in nuclear risk. "[They are not something that
you just employ and they solve all your problems]{.underline}."

Analysts hope [the taboo that surrounds nuclear weapons is a
**disincentive**.]{.underline} The horrific scale of human suffering in
Hiroshima and Nagasaki after the U.S. destroyed the Japanese cities with
atomic bombs on Aug. 6 and Aug. 9, 1945, was a powerful argument against
a repeat use of such weapons. The attacks killed 210,000 people.

No country has since used a nuclear weapon. Analysts guess that even
Putin may find it difficult to become the first world leader since U.S.
President Harry Truman to rain down nuclear fire.

"It is still a taboo in Russia to cross that threshold," said Dara
Massicot, a senior policy researcher at RAND Corp. and a former analyst
of Russian military capabilities at the U.S. Defense Department.

"One of the biggest decisions in the history of Earth," Baklitskiy said.

[The backlash could turn Putin into a **global pariah**.]{.underline}

"[Breaking the nuclear taboo would impose]{.underline}, at a minimum,
[**complete diplomatic and economic isolation** on Russia]{.underline},"
said Sidharth Kaushal, a researcher with the Royal United Services
Institute in London that specializes in defense and security.

Long-range nuclear weapons that Russia could use in a direct conflict
with the United States are battle-ready. But its stocks of warheads for
shorter ranges --- so-called [tactical weapons]{.underline} that Putin
might be tempted to use in Ukraine --- are not, analysts say.

"All those weapons [are **in storage**]{.underline}," said Pavel Podvig,
another senior researcher who specializes in nuclear weapons at the
U.N.'s disarmament think tank in Geneva.

But retired Lt. Gen. Jerry [Boykin]{.underline} said he [is not
convinced Putin is going to turn to his nuclear arsenal **anytime
soon**]{.underline}.

"[I don't think it's very likely at this point Putin will use a nuclear
weapon, even a tactical nuclear weapon]{.underline}, and the reason is
[he's gone **too far** into this war now and the war is over if he does
that because I believe the **response from NATO will not be a nuclear
response**]{.underline}," Boykin said. "[It will be an all-out
conventional response that will bomb every target in the Ukraine that
has any association with his army or his military on the ground in
there. **They will destroy him**]{.underline}."

Putin's war in Ukraine has been faltering of late, as the Ukrainian
military has made gains against Russian forces in the east, north and
south, in a war Russia expected would end quickly and instead has
spanned months.

Vittert: Nuclear war is serious. Biden needs to be clear

[Some fear Putin could turn desperate in a losing war effort and resort
to nuclear weapons]{.underline}. Former U.S. ambassador John Bolton said
Putin using [nuclear weapons would be equivalent to him signing his own
"**suicide note**."]{.underline}

Boykin, too, feels [Putin knows using nuclear weapons is a **zero-sum
game**]{.underline}.

"[His arsenal is only as good as a threat, once he fires a nuclear
weapon, **it's over**]{.underline}," Boykin said.

The Biden administration meanwhile has issued conflicting statements
about how it views Putin's nuclear threats. Biden delivered his "not
joking" and "Armageddon" comments, but others in his circle issued
different messaging.

"[I don't see anything right now that would lead me to believe (Putin)
has made such a decision (on nukes)]{.underline}," Secretary of Defense
Lloyd Austin said.

Boykin said he is [**not convinced** Biden believes what he
said]{.underline}.

"It's hard for anybody to get inside his head and understand exactly
what he is trying to say. That's why he's got a team there that cleans
up behind him ... just about every week," Boykin said. "That said, [I
don't know that he necessarily believes Putin is that near using a
nuclear weapon. I don't think that's the case]{.underline}."

### 1NC---No Impact---Ukraine War

#### No nuclear use.

**Garrett '25** \[Langan; March 13; Middleburry College Student; The
Middlebury Campus, "Why Russia has not and will not use nuclear weapons
in Ukraine,"
https://www.middleburycampus.com/article/2025/03/why-russia-has-not-and-will-not-use-nuclear-weapons-in-ukraine\]

But [in **Ukraine**]{.underline}, [Putin **cannot** and **will not** use
**nuc**lear weapon**s**]{.underline}. Doing so [might gain him
**credibility**]{.underline}, [but it would also endanger the remaining
delicate **diplomatic ties**]{.underline} he still has, likely resulting
in massive nuclear retaliation from the West. Putin [does not want
**nuclear war**]{.underline}; he [wants this conflict to remain inside
the **borders** of Ukraine]{.underline} and to continue to [limit
**NATO** involvement]{.underline} in pursuit of some kind of limited
victory, perhaps maintaining control of the Donbas region. When Putin
started the war, he vastly [underestimated **Ukrainian resolve** and
Western economic support]{.underline} while overestimating the
motivation of his own troops. His nuclear threats are simply a Band-Aid
over the gaping bullet wound in his political and military campaign.
What little leverage remains lies in his possession of the largest
nuclear arsenal on the planet.

There is an argument that Putin would utilize his nuclear arsenal in
order to ensure victory or to prevent an existential threat. If he wants
to turn the tide and gain a decisive victory that hands him the
territory he seeks, nuclear weapons may be his best option (much like
how the U.S. utilized the bomb in Hiroshima and Nagasaki).

But this feels unlikely. The [use of tactical nuclear weapons, or on the
battlefield in a **counterforce situation** --- used to target troops,
resources or supplies --- seems improbable]{.underline}. [Ukrainian
troops are too **mobile** and agile; they do not
**congregate**]{.underline}, and they have distinct environmental and
landscape advantages. Russian troops are also poorly trained. In order
to use a tactical nuclear weapon, the target must be secure. In addition
to enough Ukrainian troops being in the same place, [Putin's own forces
would need to be out of **harm\'s way** if he were to deploy the weapon,
making its use all the more unlikely]{.underline}.

Additionally, the use of a strategy in a countervalue setting
("targeting what the enemy holds dear") is even more improbable. There
is a [lack of strong **countervalue targets** in Ukraine]{.underline}.
The [nuclear destruction of Kyiv or other cultural sites would likely
engender a **response** from the U.S. and its Western
allies]{.underline}. In my opinion, Putin does not desire this outcome.
[He wants a **regional conflict**]{.underline}: a territorial dispute to
take back what he believes to be part of Russia. It would be a
catastrophic miscalculation --- and potentially politically suicidal ---
to embroil the rest of the world in a conflict that he may no longer be
willing or able to succeed in.

Putin's options are few because of the [diplomatic guardrails that
**constrain** him]{.underline}, but nuclear leverage remains useful,
provided that he continues to posture and not use the weapons
themselves. This threat is more effective than the detonation of the
weapon. Putin is a political actor --- he is not a trained military
officer. He is surrounded by informed officials who know the realities
of the global nuclear order and realize the advantages that simple
threats maintain. So sleep peacefully, knowing [**deterrence is
intact**, and that the world's biggest nuclear bully is all fire and no
fury]{.underline}.

"Putin started it long ago & Ukraine is only the current front,"
Kasparov [argued]{.underline}. [He will]{.underline} **[escalate
anyway]{.underline}**, and it\'s even more likely if he succeeds in
destroying Ukraine because you have again convinced him you won\'t stop
him even though you could."

Kasparov has warned about Putin's aggression for years, and his book
Winter Is Coming largely predicted what we're witnessing today. But
sayijeng we are already fighting World War III is the classic
never-appease-aggressors logic by which any authoritarian is likened to
Hitler in 1939: if we don't stop him now, he will only be emboldened to
invade the next country, and the next, until he is knocking on our front
door with an armored division or two. Better to accept reality and start
World War III now than wait for Putin to initiate it and force us to
fight it on his terms.

[The]{.underline} **[logic is familiar]{.underline}** and the danger is

Kasparov's]{.underline} [argument]{.underline} has been echoed by other
commentators who warn Putin will not stop at Ukraine, or who insist the
U.S. and NATO must militarily intervene in the war in Ukraine. The head
of the European Council on Foreign Relations openly called for regime
change in Russia. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on NATO
to impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine, an idea former National Security
Adviser John Bolton partially endorsed. A no-fly zone, of course, would
involve NATO aircraft shooting down Russian warplanes over Ukrainian
skies. [To put it]{.underline} **[plainly]{.underline}**: A no-fly zone
[is a]{.underline} **[declaration of war against Russia]{.underline}**
[and the]{.underline} [first step on a path]{.underline}

Prelude to a conflict.

[Treating the war as if it were]{.underline} [already]{.underline}
[World War III]{.underline}, and Russia's invasion of Ukraine a prelude
to general European conflict, [is]{.underline}
**[unnecessary]{.underline}** [because Russia]{.underline}
**[cannot]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [will not expand the war
beyond Ukraine. The]{.underline} **[historical]{.underline}**
[analogy---Putin as]{.underline} **[Hitler]{.underline}** [hellbent on
**continental conquest**---is]{.underline} [flawed. While Putin may
have]{.underline} [**boundless ambition**, his]{.underline} actual
**[capabilities]{.underline}** [are]{.underline} **[severely
bounded]{.underline}** by reality.

[The **German**]{.underline} [military in]{.underline}
**[1940]{.underline}**, as its blitzkrieg swept across Europe,
[numbered]{.underline} some **[6 million]{.underline}** soldiers in all
branches. [Over the course of the war, some]{.underline} **[18 million
Germans served]{.underline}** in uniform, [approaching]{.underline}
[**one-third of its total population**. Germany was the]{.underline}
economic **[powerhouse of Europe]{.underline}** in 1940 and could
outproduce any European competitor in military equipment and supplies.

[At the start of the war, the Germans]{.underline} arguably [had
the]{.underline} **[best tank]{.underline}** (the Panzer) [and
the]{.underline} **[best fighter]{.underline}** plane (the
Messerschmitt). [The German scientific and industrial base was among the
best in Europe and had a head start in its focus on military technology.
German military scientists invented the jet, rocket, cruise missile, and
helicopter before any of the Allies. And the German military was
infamous---again, at the beginning of the war---for its extraordinary
training, discipline, and cohesion.]{.underline}

[None of that is true of Russia or the Russian military]{.underline}
today. [The Russian military has about]{.underline} **[1
million]{.underline}** active-duty [soldiers]{.underline}, a fraction of
what Germany had at the beginning of its conquests. Russia
**[could]{.underline}** [call up]{.underline} vast [**reserves**, but it
would take]{.underline} **[years]{.underline}** [to turn them into
a]{.underline} **[trained]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} [**capable
fighting force**. Russian]{.underline} **[tanks]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[jets]{.underline}** [are]{.underline} better than
Germany's of 1940---but **[not better than NATO's]{.underline}** in
2022. [Over the past week, the Russian military has proven]{.underline}
**[inadequate in basic tasks]{.underline}** like vehicle maintenance,
let alone operational planning, combined arms operations, air assault,
and air defense.

[The 21s century **Russia**n military overwhelmed **smaller** opponents
in Chechnya]{.underline} [and]{.underline} [Syria]{.underline}
[through]{.underline} [sheer]{.underline} force of [numbers]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[utter disregard for the laws]{.underline}** of
armed conflict. [But]{.underline} it has **[clearly
struggled]{.underline}** [when faced with a]{.underline} moderately
**[larger]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[more challenging
opponent]{.underline}** in Ukraine. [The Russian army is]{.underline}
[hardly ready to invade the next country]{.underline} over, or the one
after that. [No]{.underline} Russian [blitzkrieg is in the offing. It is
materially incapable of doing so. Hitler spent the better part of a
decade rearming and preparing for his war (and still lost).]{.underline}

And [Russia is]{.underline} **[utterly incapable of]{.underline}**
waging a [pro**long**ed **war**. Even]{.underline}
**[before]{.underline}** global economic **[sanctions]{.underline}**
[cratered the Russian economy last week, it was **smaller than

**[Russia]{.underline}** [about]{.underline} **[3 percent]{.underline}**
([and]{.underline} **[shrinking]{.underline}**). [Russia does have an

AJW

[Since the moment Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the specter
of escalation has loomed over the war.]{.underline} For Ukrainian
citizens and soldiers, the war is a grueling, horrific, daily reality
that has already escalated in notable ways; in August, Kyiv ramped up
strikes in Russia, and Moscow has resumed its campaign against Ukrainian
grain exports through the Black Sea. Seen another way, however, many of
the most feared escalation scenarios have not occurred, most notably a
large-scale conventional war between NATO and Russia and the use of
nuclear weapons. [Eighteen months after the war began, it is time to
take stock of its unusual escalation dynamics. Russian President
Vladimir Putin has repeatedly hinted that he might go nuclear, raising
the prospect that tactical nuclear weapons could be used]{.underline} to
destroy military targets, kill Ukrainian civilians, or make a show of
force in an uninhabited area. Yet he has not done so. Beyond this most
conspicuous missing form of escalation, there are other realms in which
various parties have shown restraint---for instance, in the scope of
NATO's surveillance flights or in the details of Russian operations in
the Black Sea. [Despite ample opportunity to intensify hostilities or to
expand the geographic scope of the war, Russia, Ukraine, and Ukraine's
allies **have mostly chosen not to do so.** This restraint is often
overlooked, and a key reason for it---a gradual approach to the war on
all sides---is often misunderstood]{.underline}. Many supporters of
Ukraine have criticized the piecemeal delivery of aid and other forms of
incrementalism. Indeed, a go-slow approach to expanding military aid to
Ukraine has slowed the development of some combat capabilities by Kyiv's
military forces. But the West's gradual approach has served a vital
strategic purpose. It is no accident that the war has avoided certain
forms of drastic escalation. The war's participants, including leaders
in Kyiv, have often followed a logic of learning and gradualism,
cautiously adopting new weapons and tactics, buying time to assess
Russia's reaction. Even Ukraine has done this in its approach to attacks
within Russian territory. Western leaders and Ukraine have allowed what
is still, in some important ways, a limited war to emerge organically
and through trial and error. New developments, however, may threaten
this dynamic. Russia's campaign against Ukrainian grain infrastructure
and surging Ukrainian attacks within Russia threaten to expand the
geographical scope of conflict. The mutiny and subsequent death of
Wagner mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin suggest that Russia's domestic
political situation is dynamic and could shift in ways that may
encourage Putin to escalate. Ukraine's counteroffensive, meanwhile, has
made some progress but no breakthroughs. Should Ukraine achieve rapid
territorial gains, the risks of escalation may sharply increase. To keep
escalation in check as the war continues to evolve, Western officials
and Ukrainian leaders must resist calls to abandon their gradualist
approach. Failure to do so could cause the hard-earned control over
escalation to slip away. [THE ROADS NOT TAKEN Historical comparisons
from the past century often inform debates about the risk of escalation.
World War I, for instance, started as a local dispute over an
assassination, but it quickly ballooned into a pan-European clash that
killed 20 million people.]{.underline} The Korean War was initially
limited to combat between Pyongyang, Seoul, and Seoul's foreign
partners, but within five months, hundreds of thousands of U.S. and
Chinese troops were in direct combat. The United States intended to
assist South Vietnam only with military aid and advice, but its
involvement evolved into a costly, violent military intervention that
lasted a decade. **[Conflicts after the end of the Cold War did not
feature the same escalation problems]{.underline}**. With the end of
bipolarity, the West's adversaries in peripheral countries such as Iraq
and Libya did not have great-power backers. These were one-sided
affairs. Russia's invasion of Ukraine therefore harks back to an earlier
period when escalation and restraint were potent issues during war. [The
gravest form of escalation in Ukraine would involve nuclear weapons.
This scenario has been depicted as plausible because employing nuclear
weapons could give Putin a decisive edge under certain battlefield
conditions or serve as a stark warning to the West. It could even prompt
retaliation by NATO]{.underline}, increasing the possibility of a
large-scale exchange of nuclear weapons beyond Ukraine's borders. Every
time an ally has provided Kyiv with new surface-to-surface missile
systems, air defense systems, armored and tracked vehicles, or fighter
jets, cautious voices in the West have warned that these acts risk
prompting escalation---including Russian retaliatory strikes outside
Ukraine. [To date, this has not happened. The absence of this form of
escalation does not mean that analysts have been wrong to fear it**.
Quite the contrary: a fear of escalation can motivate military
commanders and policymakers to make cautious decisions that help prevent
it**]{.underline}. Early in the war, [Kyiv and many of its supporters
called for a no-fly zone, but Western leaders refused to impose one,
fearing an air-to-air clash between NATO and Russian
aircraft]{.underline}. The no-fly zone proposal has faded from public
commentary, making the escalation avoided by rejecting it easy to
overlook. But [this was an important road not taken. The lesson is
clear: anticipating escalation scenarios helps make them less likely to
happen]{.underline}. Yet the fear of escalation is not the only factor
that has prevented it in Ukraine. Understanding the other reasons why
Russia's invasion has not drastically escalated is essential to avoid
escalation, both in this conflict and in others to come. [Public
discussions often underrepresent many of the escalation scenarios that
have not come to pass. Conspicuously, Russia has not engaged in
observable large-scale cyberattacks on targets beyond
Ukraine.]{.underline} Moscow has developed a sophisticated
cyber-capability and used it to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential
election. [Yet civilian infrastructure or government targets in Western
Europe and the United States appear to have been largely spared. Putin
has also abstained from using chemical weapons]{.underline}. The Russian
military has a considerable stock of chemical munitions, and chemical
attacks by President Bashar al-Assad in Syria have set a dangerous
precedent. But Putin has not yet used them in Ukraine. Some forms of
restraint demonstrated by the United States and NATO have received
minimal fanfare. The United States has limited visits by senior U.S.
military officials to Ukraine to "avoid increasing tensions with
Moscow," as an August assessment of the counteroffensive in The New York
Times noted. Few outside Washington notice such moderation. Other forms
of restraint related to espionage and covert action are hard to observe.
[NATO countries routinely conduct surveillance over international waters
and their own territories, but according to The New York Times, they
"are careful not to stray into the war zone."]{.underline} A Washington
Post report this August on Russian sabotage operations within Poland
contained an overlooked revelation: [Russia had not even attempted to
sabotage the flow of military supplies into Ukraine until a year into
the war.]{.underline} Even Russia's resumption of its blockade on
Ukrainian grain exports in July---a form of escalation in its own
way---features elements of restraint. Although its military strikes have
targeted grain-related installations, so far Moscow has not overtly
attacked civilian grain shipments. NATO countries' responses to the
blockade have also been measured; for now, they have refrained from
providing the armed escorts for grain shipments that Ukraine has
requested. As the Kremlin expands the scope of its hostilities, it has
shown a tendency to also reject more reckless forms of escalation. The
missing escalations in Ukraine are analogous to dogs that do not bark:
their silence makes them easy to miss. REASON FOR RESTRAINT [The puzzle
of the missing escalations in Ukraine is, in part, explained by the
broader context of this particular war. **There are significant
incentives for leaders to try to contain the fighting.** A direct
conventional or nuclear clash between Russia and NATO **would clearly be
ruinous for both sides**,]{.underline} [inflicting tremendous economic,
political, and military damage.]{.underline} War between major powers in
the modern era is incredibly costly. [**Today's war in Ukraine and past
conflicts during the Cold War share this structural constraint.** The
strain on Russia's military resources almost certainly amplifies the
downsides of escalation for Moscow]{.underline}. After its failed bid to
swiftly seize Kyiv at the beginning of the war and high rates of
equipment loss and casualties, Moscow cannot open new war fronts and
achieve anything close to its military objectives in Ukraine. Putin's
decisions over the course of the conflict will need to reflect this
reality: if the conflict dramatically widened, he would be playing with
a losing hand. Domestic politics also matter. During the Cold War,
restraint toward Communist aggression could be politically fatal.
Today's political environment has changed. Leaders in the democratic
West that recklessly invite escalation are probably more likely to lose
the next election. It is less clear whether Russia's domestic political
dynamics have blunted or encouraged escalation. Putin must avoid
alienating the Russian elites that support him and mobilizing mass
dissent. Yet some domestic pressures on Putin incentivize belligerence,
namely the war hawks outside government who continually demand more
expansive military mobilization or even the use of nuclear weapons.

a **negotiated settlement**]{.underline} [involving a territorial status
quo ante, or]{.underline} [it will subside into a **frozen conflict**
along the armies' stalemated line of contact in the east]{.underline}.
That is, [the war's end will **resemble**]{.underline} [those in the
Korean and Gulf Wars or]{.underline} the situation in Abkhazia, South
Ossetia, and Transnistria. Either way, as in Korea, [the shock of the
initial aggression has **galvanized a broader**]{.underline} [balancing
coalition that will **remain** even]{.underline} [when the fighting
stops]{.underline}. Russia chose a hot war and will get a cold one in
the bargain. Ukraine follows the pattern of limited war in the nuclear
age. [Whatever some interpretations of Russian military doctrine might
suggest,]{.underline} [Moscow will **not use nuclear weapons** during
the conflict]{.underline}. [Since 1945,]{.underline} **[every
leader]{.underline}** [of a nuclear power,]{.underline} from homespun
politicians such as U.S. Presidents Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson to
mass-murdering sociopaths such as Joseph Stalin and Mao Zedong, [has
rejected the use of nuclear weapons]{.underline} in battle for excellent
reasons. **[Putin will be no exception,]{.underline}** acting not from a
soft heart but a hard head. [He knows that]{.underline} **[extraordinary
retaliation]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[universal
opprobrium]{.underline}** [would follow,]{.underline} [with **no
remotely comparable strategic upsides**]{.underline} [to justify
them]{.underline}---[not to mention the fact that the]{.underline}
**[radioactive fallout]{.underline}** [from such use might **easily blow
back** onto Russia itself.]{.underline} For related reasons, [NATO will
**not attack**]{.underline} [Russia or try to decapitate]{.underline}
[the Russian regime]{.underline} so as to avoid making Putin desperate.
[There will be **no introduction of NATO troops**]{.underline}, [no
no-fly zone, and no hot pursuit of Russian forces should]{.underline}
[they withdraw]{.underline} back into home territory. [All these actions
would carry **major risks of escalation**, which NATO **wants to avoid**
as much as Moscow]{.underline}. Conversely, NATO will feel compelled to
deny Moscow a significant victory, not just for Ukraine's sake but to
avoid setting the dangerous precedent that nuclear weapons are useful
for protecting the ill-gotten gains of conventional aggression. Within
these limits, however, [the war will be fought to the
**utmost**]{.underline} [until the tide turns
**decisively**]{.underline} [in one direction or **curdles into a
stalemate**.]{.underline} The belligerents will struggle until they are
exhausted or the battle lines return to something near the starting
point. The Biden administration's goal should be to hasten all this---by
continuing to supply Ukraine with whatever conventional military aid it
can short of the nuclear firebreaks, avoiding trash talk about Russian
leadership, and being ready to negotiate seriously when conditions are
ripe.

## Research Advantage 

### 1NC---India Says No

#### India won't follow-on to climate research.

**Dasgupta '24** \[Oishik; May 22; Graduate Research Assistant at the
Research Institute for Sustainability, Potsdam; The Hindu, "Climate
change, a passing cloud in Indian politics Premium,"
https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/climate-change-a-passing-cloud-in-indian-politics/article68201128.ece\]

A calculated omission

The reluctance of both the BJP and Congress to foreground climate change
in their electoral platforms is not just a matter of oversight but a
calculated omission. [Integrating serious climate action into their
political agendas would entail acknowledging and addressing the
trade-offs between rapid **industrial growth** and **environmental
sustainability**]{.underline}. Such acknowledgment could [alienate
powerful **industrial constituencies** and disrupt the **economic status
quo**]{.underline}, [which heavily relies on **fossil fuels** and
high-emission industries]{.underline}.

[This **strategic avoidance** plays out in the
**manifestos**]{.underline}, where [**climate policies**, if mentioned,
are **vague** and lack commitment to **specific**, **measurable actions.
For**]{.underline} instance, the Congress party's manifesto has a
chapter, 'Environment Protection and Climate Change Authority' and
proposes a 'Green New Deal Investment Programme' without clear
directives or commitments to specific reductions in carbon emissions.
Similarly, the BJP's manifesto praises past initiatives but fails to
propose forward-looking strategies that align with the global scientific
consensus, which calls for immediate and drastic action to mitigate
climate change impacts.

The absence of detailed climate action plans in these manifestos
[reflects a broader trend in Indian politics where short-term **economic
gains** are often **prioritised** over long-term **environmental
sustainability**]{.underline}. That said, we must remember India's
vulnerability to climate impacts, including rising sea levels, extreme
weather events, and severe air pollution, which pose significant threats
to its population and economy. Moreover, the silence on climate change
in electoral discussions sends a disheartening message to educated,
middle-class voters, who are increasingly aware of and concerned about
global environmental issues. This demographic, capable of influencing
policy through public opinion and voting power, I believe, seeks more
than just token mentions of sustainability. They demand actionable plans
that ensure that India not only meets its international commitments
under agreements such as the Paris Agreement but also adopts a
leadership role in global climate advocacy.

#### They'll [prioritize]{.underline} development.

**PTI '24** \[PTI; 2024; Press Trust of India;Times of India, "Political
disconnect: Why environmental issues are not winning votes in India,"
https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/political-disconnect-why-environmental-issues-not-winning-votes-in-india/articleshow/108563256.cms;
Accessed 7.5.25\]

One reason for this, they say, [is that political and social movements
in India predominantly focus on **livelihood issues**]{.underline}.

Tikender Singh Panwar, former deputy mayor of Shimla, told PTI that [the
lack of social mobilisation linking the **environment** with
**livelihoods** is a **major obstacle**]{.underline}.

He praised Kerala\'s approach to risk-informed climate development but
noted the challenges in states like Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand due
to the absence of such movements connecting disasters with livelihood
and governance issues.

The Communist Party of India (Marxist) member said it would take another
five to 10 years for environmental issues to become mainstream in the
country.

\"You can see what Sonam (Wangchuk) is doing in Ladakh. Even in Delhi,
when it is air pollution, you find some noises being made. But these are
just on the periphery,\" Panwar said.

Wangchuk is leading a \"climate fast\" to demand tribal area status for
Ladakh, which he says will help protect the fragile ecology and tribal
identity of the region.

The World Economic Forum (WEF) Global Risks Report 2024 counts extreme
weather events and critical change to earth systems as the greatest
concerns facing the world over the next decade.

A survey conducted by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication
(YPCCC) and Centre for Voting Opinion and Trends in Election Research
(CVoter) in 2021-2022 showed that 84 per cent Indians believe that
climate change is real and most of them acknowledge that it stems from
anthropogenic activities.

Several smaller political parties have also prioritised climate change
in their manifestos for previous elections, focusing on issues such as
sustainable agriculture, eco-tourism, and promoting renewable energy.

\"[Still, not many would **vote** on these **issues** in
**elections**]{.underline},\" says Debadityo Sinha, a senior resident
fellow at the Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy in Delhi.

\"[Environmental concerns will gain prominence in elections only after
we address **fundamental human needs**]{.underline}. [**Food**,
**water** and **health** take **precedence**]{.underline}. [The
**majority** of the population, busy earning a livelihood, tends to
**overlook environmental issues** until these directly impact their
daily lives]{.underline},\" he said.

history dating to 1962, when the Soviet Union (USSR) and India signed

operations]{.underline}.[^\[18\]^](https://www.orfonline.org/research/india-in-the-arctic-a-potential-pathway-to-strategic-autonomy-beyond-russia#_edn18) Although
there are no ongoing collaborations between the two countries in the
Arctic, with joint work appearing to have slowed since Russia's invasion
of
Ukraine,[^\[19\]^](https://www.orfonline.org/research/india-in-the-arctic-a-potential-pathway-to-strategic-autonomy-beyond-russia#_edn19) the
two countries could deepen their space partnership in the future and
apply their joint capabilities to the Arctic maritime and energy
domains.

Last, but not least, New Delhi's approach towards Russia in the Arctic,
and beyond, appears to be at least partly [influenced by concerns over
China's growing influence in general and over Russia in particular as
the latter becomes more
isolated]{.underline}.[^\[20\]^](https://www.orfonline.org/research/india-in-the-arctic-a-potential-pathway-to-strategic-autonomy-beyond-russia#_edn20) India
is still wary that [an increasingly China-aligned Russia could abandon

alignment]{.underline}.[^\[21\]^](https://www.orfonline.org/research/india-in-the-arctic-a-potential-pathway-to-strategic-autonomy-beyond-russia#_edn21) Above
all, however, this paper argues, this divergence in India's approach in
the Arctic is due to its geographical proximity to China in the

Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru's first interaction with US President
Harry S. Truman was his multi-week tour of the United States, beginning
October 13, 1949 (CFR, 2024). The trip preceded India's formal
declaration of neutrality in the developing Cold War, during which India
took a leadership role within the Non-Aligned movement (MEA, 2023c).
This set the tone for U.S.-Indian relations throughout the Cold War,
creating constraints within the relationship, as well as opportunity for
closer amity between New Delhi and Moscow (Sen, 2011).

Eliminating the early hesitations of the period of the Cold War[, India
and the United States have built a strong and strategic **bilateral**
relationship]{.underline}, and declared their intent to contribute the
stability and prosperity of the world. The first Prime Minister of India
Jawaharlal Nehru compared American Imperialism to the British Empire. He
propounded and propagated the Non-Alignment Principle in furtherance of
which India refused to join either the capitalistic United States or the
communist Soviet Union. India's socialistic economic principles and deep
scepticism of US hegemony in the world resulted in its predilections
towards USSR to the ire of the Western alliance system of NATO powers.

The ideological Cold War ended after a myriad of international
convergences and divergences. India was compelled to look West given the
paradigm shift in the geopolitics of the world in 1991, and in Francis
Fukuyama's words the so-called "End of History". [Today both India and
US are among the most vibrant **strategic** partners]{.underline} (MEA,
2023c) though India is also a member of the Shanghai Cooperation
Organisation (SCO), and has endeavoured to maintain a balancing act.

[India-U.S. bilateral relations have developed into a "global strategic
partnership", based on increasing **convergence of interests**, on
bilateral, regional and global issues]{.underline}. [The emphasis placed
by the Government in India]{.underline} on development, [has created
**opportunities to reinvigorate** bilateral ties and enhance
cooperation]{.underline}, under the motto: "Chalein Saath Saath: Forward
Together We Go", and "Sanjha Prayas, Sab ka Vikas" (Shared Effort,
Progress for All) adopted during the first two summits of Prime Minister
Modi and President Obama in September 2014, and January 2015,
respectively (MEA, 2023c). The summit level joint statement issued in
June 2016 referred to India and the U.S. as, "Enduring Global Partners
in the 21st Century" (MEA, 2023c). [Regular exchange of **high-level
political visits** have provided sustained momentum for bilateral
cooperation, while the wide-ranging and ever-expanding dialogue
architecture has established a long-term framework for India-U.S.
engagement]{.underline} (MEA, 2023c). [Presently, the India-U.S.
bilateral cooperation is **broad-based and multi-sectoral**, covering
trade and investment, defence and security, education, science and
technology, cyber security, hightechnology, civil nuclear energy, space
technology and applications, clean energy, environment, agriculture and
health]{.underline}. The visit of Prime Minister Modi to USA in 2023
bolstered by people-to-people interaction based on a network of Indian
Americans, including representatives in the U.S. Congress and Indians
residing and working in the US; and also support across the political
spectrum in both countries which have nurtured this bilateral
relationship.

India and USA's recent ties have been affected by the Gurmeet Singh
Nijjar and Gurpatwant Singh Pannun episodes as discussed earlier in
relations with Canada (Mayengbam, 2023). The US National Security
Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson was quoted in a Washington Post
article dated November 2023 as declaring that President Biden had
expressed his concern to PM Modi about the episode during his state
visit to the USA in June 2023. She stated, "We are treating this issue
with utmost seriousness, and it has been raised by the U.S. government
with New Delhi. Indian counterparts expressed surprise and concern, and
stated that activity of this nature was not their policy." MEA spokesman
Arindam Bagchi in reply stated, "the USA shared some inputs" regarding
the "nexus between organized criminals, gun runners, terrorists and
others. India takes such inputs seriously....necessary follow-up action
would be taken". Canada have alleged that India is conducting illegal
activitites on Canadian soil (Karnad, 2023a). According to security
expert Bharat Karnad India has adopted a defensive posture in connection
with these accusations, which is not in sync with geopolitical realities
[where the USA requires India more as a **counterweight** to
China]{.underline} rather than the other way around (Karnad, 2023b).
Subsequently, the MEA stated that the Nijjar and Pannun episodes were
due to the actions of a rogue official. The U.S. President Joseph
Biden's decision not to accept Mr. Modi's invitation for the Republic
Day in 2024 indicates that [the USA **is not pleased** with
India's]{.underline} [balancing posture, and especially its viewpoint on
Ukraine]{.underline}. Notwithstanding the official MEA response
indicates that this is going to be just another blip in the otherwise
robust trade relations between the two countries. [India]{.underline}
[has commenced a bilateral dialogue with the USA for **Arctic
research**. The overall trajectory of bilateral relations indicates that
this **engagement could expand**.]{.underline}

### 1NC---No Impact---Indo-Pak Water War 

#### No Indo-Pak water wars.

**Fickling '25** \[David; May 8; columnist covering climate change and

conflict; Bloomberg, "Why India and Pakistan Won't Go to War Over
Water,"

Accessed 7.5.25\]

That's the theory, at least. In reality, the "[water wars]{.underline}"
thesis --- the idea that, on a warming planet racked by
ever-more-variable river flows, nation-states will inevitably clash as
they fight over a dwindling supply of fresh water --- [has **hardly
ever** played out]{.underline}.

The first recorded battle may have been a water war. Around 2,500 BC,
the Sumerian city-states of Lagash and Umma came to blows over a tract
of irrigated farmland, commemorated in a broken bas-relief in the
Louvre. According to [**Aaron Wolf**, a **professor** specializing in
**water** and **conflict** at **O**regon **S**tate
**U**niversity]{.underline}, it's also the last time in human history
that states turned their perpetual threats of water wars into an actual
conflict.

"[On the international scene, there is **very little violence** around
**water**]{.underline}," he said. "What happens is that there is an
awful lot of rancor and speculation, and then all that attention helps
turn the ship to where you have the conditions for dialogue, and
negotiation, and a treaty that lasts in perpetuity."

In [a database hosted at Oregon State compiling more than **7,000
water-related** international **incidents** between 1948 and
2008,]{.underline} [actual violence broke out only **38
times**]{.underline}. All but 10 involved Israel, mostly during the
1950s and '60s. [**Two-thirds** of international interactions over water
were **cooperative**]{.underline}, [and **didn't** reach the level of
**mild** **verbal criticism**]{.underline}. [That's even the case
between **nations** that are **usually hostile**, such as
**India-Pakistan**]{.underline}, Turkey-Armenia, and Israel and its Arab
neighbors.

This shouldn't really surprise us. Tensions over river flows are
alarming precisely because water is potentially a weapon of mass
destruction. Famine has killed many orders of magnitude more people
during wars than swords and bullets. [In common with **chemical**,
**biological** and **nuclear weapo**ns, however, we have done
**remarkably** **well** at defusing the threat of water conflict through
humdrum protocols and **treaties**]{.underline}.

As with those other WMDs, the water weapon is also a lot easier to
speculate about than to actually deploy. Despite the provocative threats
of India's water minister that "not one drop" of the Indus will make it
across the border into Pakistan, humanity's ability to permanently hold
back the hundreds of cubic kilometers of H2O that flow down major river
systems every year is distinctly limited.

Hydroelectric dams, for instance, can't impound water for very long
without threatening their own structural integrity. To follow through on
the "not one drop" threat, India would have to either divert the rivers
into channels that don't exist, or irrigate vast tracts of land. Either
option would take many years, and billions of dollars.

Using crops to suck it up is pretty much the only large-scale way we can
prevent upstream flows from ultimately finding their way to the sea.
That's one reason that irrigation in India is so tightly regulated by
the Indus Waters Treaty, a fact that in turn has long fueled persistent
local pressure for New Delhi to withdraw from the agreement.

That may be the best context in which to understand the latest conflict.
[Climate change provides a fresh challenge to the **hundreds** of
**treaties** and **agreements** that govern our use of water, but **not
on**e that will **break them**]{.underline}. [The **m**utually
**a**ssured **d**estruction that would result from water wars has
**prevented them** breaking out for **4,500 years**]{.underline}. [The
current round of brinkmanship is likely to follow the same
path]{.underline} --- heated words that end [**not** with bombs and
**bloodshed**, but with **lawyers** hashing out **revisions** to a
**65-year-old treaty** in a sleepy courtroom in **The

### 1NC---No Himalaya Scenario 

#### Exaggerations about Himalayan glaciers turns case---they distort research and make future planning impossible

Cato Institute, 5-3-2022, Accessed 6-30-2025
https://www.cato.org/policy-analysis/false-alarm-over-retreat-himalayan-glaciers\]

Many activists and journalists warn that rapidly melting Himalayan
glaciers due to global warming will have catastrophic consequences. The
[glaciers have been melting since]{.underline} the end of the last ice
age [11,700 years ago]{.underline}, but the [melting has not worsened
recently]{.underline}. Satellite studies suggest that [the vast majority
of glaciers in the Himalayas are stable]{.underline}, a minority are
shrinking, and [a few are advancing]{.underline}. The retreat of [the
Gangotri Glacier]{.underline}, the source of the Ganges River, has
decelerated in recent decades to 10 meters (33 feet) per year, at which
rate it [will last 3,000 years.]{.underline}

Until recently, studies could not distinguish between the contribution
of snowmelt and glacial melt to river flows. The one study that does
shows that [the contribution of glacial melt is less than 1 percent of
the river flow in the Ganges Basin and less than 2 percent in the Indus
Basin]{.underline} even at high altitudes, and much less downstream.
Almost [all the river flow is due to rain and snowmelt, both of which
will continue even after the glaciers]{.underline} ultimately
[disappear]{.underline} centuries hence.

Most of India's rain falls during the monsoon season (June to
September). Some academics incorrectly claim that in the dry season
(February to May) the main Ganges flow comes from glacial melt, so
glaciers are critical in this season. In fact, dry season flows come
overwhelmingly from snowmelt. Glacial melt occurs mainly when
temperatures rise in June to September, coinciding with torrential
monsoon rain.

[Exaggerations and false alarms about shrinking Himalayan
glaciers]{.underline} carry three major risks. First, they subordinate
environmental truth to populist fears, misleading public opinion.
Second, they [increase military tensions between]{.underline} countries
sharing Himalayan rivers---[China, India, and
Pakistan]{.underline}---that already have a history of military
conflict. Third, glacier alarmism---some studies claim the Ganges flow
will shrink 70 percent as glaciers disappear---[can distort agricultural
research and planning priorities.]{.underline}

As perilous as the situation may seem, the idea of a
"[water]{.underline} war" [seems **far-fetched** for several

impedes **progress**]{.underline}. [**South** **Asia** has not seen a
full-blown war since **1971**]{.underline}, even though there have been
provocative border disputes between India, Pakistan and China. The
Kargil conflict of 1999 did not escalate into a war due to international
pressure and nuclear weapons acting as deterrents. Other reasons
directly related to water conflict include policies, treaties and
agreements.

India in the Middle

The westward flowing Indus and Satluj rivers start in Tibet and pass
through India and Pakistan, while the Brahmaputra traverses through
China, India and Bangladesh, aided by a couple of tributaries from
Bhutan as well. India also shares several smaller rivers with Nepal and
four other rivers with Pakistan.

All of South Asia's trans-boundary rivers nourish India's lands on their
forward journey to other countries, thus making it a significant player
in all possible disputes. India is home to about 17% of the world's
population, but the country has less than 4% of its water resources.
About one-third of its surface water is dependent on foreign-originating
rivers.

[India has been a **firm believer** in **negotiations** both inside and
outside the country]{.underline}. Given the level of diversity and
regional interests it has to pacify within its borders, the fact it has
been able to avoid an overt civil war is because of its tendency to
engage opponents for long periods of time. Even outside its borders,
relations with Pakistan have gone through tough phases, including
full-blown wars, but negotiations have always been given paramount
importance.

In fact, through the wars they have fought, [the archrivals have
successfully honored the **Indus Water Treaty** governing rights over
the shared rivers]{.underline}. [India has also actively engaged
**Bangladesh**, **Bhutan** and **Nepal** to **settle disputes** around
rivers from time to time]{.underline}. China is the only country with
which India has no agreement, except the one that improved sharing of
data regarding river flow level during flood season.

The Brahmaputra Tangle

China is considered the 13th most "water-poor" country in the world,
with 80% of its cities severely water stressed. Its parched northern
region possesses only 14.5% of the entire country's water resources,
which is why it is planning to divert water from Brahmaputra (known as
Yarlung Tsangpo in Tibet) to its northern areas. China is also
developing five hydropower projects on the river, the first of which was
completed in 2014. The lack of knowledge-sharing on these projects by
the Chinese has caused anxiety among downstream countries.

Of the three countries dependent on the Brahmaputra, Bangladesh is the
most vulnerable, having the lowest water resources and maximum external
dependency.

China refuses to enter formal water-sharing agreements, which is the
only way out of the "water mess." The only agreements India has been
able to get China into have been on sharing water-related data during
the floods, the most recent of which was signed in 2013 during
then-Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's visit to China.

The most relevant international law on trans-boundary water-sharing is
the United Nations Convention on the Law of Non-Navigational Uses of
International Watercourses, which was signed in 1997. While China voted
against it, India abstained, pushing them out of the purview of the
convention. The situation will get trickier as time passes, since water
demands will rise and more dams will be constructed. This is why it is
geopolitically imperative for India and Bangladesh to bring China to the
negotiation table as soon as possible.

In fact, Bangladesh has been successful in engaging India, its upstream
neighbor, despite being a comparatively smaller and militarily weaker
nation with little bargaining power. Proximity between the two countries
geographically, as well as historically, influenced these decisions.
India's need to maintain a strong alliance with Bangladesh, particularly
at the regional level, also affects these negotiations. In contrast,
Sino-Indian relations are not all that cordial, thanks to long-running
border disputes and regional groupings.

Water Wars Between India and China?

[India and China are much **too dependent** on each other today, both
economically and in the context of global
politic]{.underline}s---[preventing such a **conflict** over
**water**]{.underline}. China has become India's largest trading
partner, with bilateral trade having a potential of over \$100 billion
in 2015.

The impact of damming too may not be as disastrous as is currently being
predicted. Most of the dams planned by China are run-of-the-river,
requiring smaller water storage to produce electricity. There will
definitely be a fluctuation in water flows downstream, impacting the
aquatic life more than the people. Thus far, nations have not gone to
war for any living beings other than humans.

Moreover, the Brahmaputra gets most of its water from various
tributaries after entering India, thanks to heavy rainfall in the
northeastern region. In an interview, Jabin T. Jacob, assistant director
and fellow at the Institute of Chinese Studies, said about 70% of the
water volume of the Brahmaputra is generated on the Indian side of the
McMahon Line through various tributaries and rainfall. The 30% natural
flow from Tibet is still a high volume that is expected to first
increase and then decline in the long-term due to the melting of the
Jima Yangzong glacier, the Brahmaputra's main source.

On the other hand, the plan to divert water from the Tibetan plateau
toward North China faces technical challenges as it has to be hauled up
several thousand meters, which does not seem feasible as of now. Thus,
the river flow is not expected to change as drastically as predicted.

In case of scarcity, India is more likely to strengthen its domestic
rainwater recharge capacities than sabotage dams operating across its
borders, potentially provoking China into war. India gets 4,000 billion
m3 of sweet water through annual precipitation---of which only 18% is
used effectively. Thankfully, the country has realized the need to
conserve water, which is why there is a renewed focus on surface water
storage and catchment treatment, particularly through large initiatives,
including a rural job guarantee scheme and the Integrated Watershed
Management Program. This does not mean water conflicts will not happen.
While a water war may not occur, water can be used as an effective
weapon by upstream countries, especially in the absence of an agreement,
should war break out.

The Indus success

[The Indus Water Treaty between India and Pakistan is one of the most
successful **water sharing** agreements in the **world**]{.underline},
[even surviving **multiple wars** between the **two
countries**]{.underline}. All rivers flowing into Pakistan go through
India. When Pakistan was created in 1947, it was decided that India
would release sufficient water and get paid by Islamabad accordingly.
The newly created country feared that India could reduce river flows,
resulting in droughts downstream. With the intervention of the World
Bank, the neighbors eventually sealed the treaty that gave exclusive
rights to the Ravi, Beas and Sutlej to India before they entered
Pakistan. In return, Pakistan received exclusive usage rights to the
western rivers Jhelum, Chenab and Indus, but with some stipulations for
development of projects on these rivers in India.

[The treaty also envisaged a **commission** to decide future disputes
and resolve conflicts through **inspections** and **data
sharing**]{.underline}. The treaty was put to the test to resolve the
Baglihar and Kishanganga hydropower projects on the Indian side.
Pakistan objected, claiming that India violated the treaty; however,
arbitrators allowed the projects with some modifications.

The media and opposition parties in Pakistan continue to blame India for
disrupting river flows, causing floods as well water shortages in the
country. Fortunately, state authorities have been mature enough to avoid
such blame games, as was evident in recent incidents when Pakistani
media blamed India for water shortage in the country.

### 1NC---Alt Causes---Arctic Biod

#### Too many alt causes.

**Arctic Council '21** \[Arctic Council; Carbon Dated to 2021 via
Wayback Machine; high-level intergovernmental forum that addresses
issues faced by the Arctic governments; Arctic Council, "Addressing
Arctic pollution,"
https://arctic-council.org/explore/topics/pollutants/\]

While most regions of the Arctic are far removed from large
industrialized areas, [the environment in the high North carries the
traces of **human-induced pollution**]{.underline} -- from soot to
plastics, from methane to pesticides. To an extent, pollutants originate
in the Arctic for example through wood combustion or oil and gas
flaring. Yet, [many contaminants are transported over **long
distances**, traveling to the **high latitudes** via rivers, oceans, and
the air]{.underline} -- where they can have far reaching negative
impacts on the environment and human health.

Several of the Arctic Council's Working Groups are closely monitoring
and addressing the impacts of pollutants and contaminants on the Arctic
ecosystems. Their findings have raised awareness on the serious
implications of pollution in the Arctic and contributed to both national
actions and international conventions.

Persistent organic pollutants (POPS) and mercury

[Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are chemicals of **global
concern** because they can potentially be transported over **long
distances**]{.underline}, remain in the environment, accumulate in
ecosystems, and have significant negative effects on human health and
the environment. Humans are exposed to these chemicals in a variety of
ways, mainly through contaminated food and polluted air. Many everyday
products can contain POPs, such as flame retardants or detergents. As a
result, [POPs can be found virtually everywhere on the planet in
**measurable concentrations**]{.underline}.

Since its establishment in 1991, the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment
Programme (AMAP) has documented the extent and effects of pollution in
the Arctic and tracked new developments in order to inform policy
decisions. Its assessments have contributed significantly to the
negotiation of international agreements, such as the 'UN ECE's
Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution (LRTAP) Protocol on
Persistent Organic Pollutants' and the 'Stockholm Convention on
Persistent Organic Pollutants'.

The Arctic Contaminants Action Program (ACAP) assesses the emissions of
POPs in local factories, develops inventories of emission sources, and
promotes the decrease of pollution with local authorities, businesses,
trade organizations and environmental stakeholders.

Black carbon and methane

[The short-lived climate pollutants **black carbon** and methane are
contributing to **atmospheric warming**]{.underline}. In addition, black
carbon that falls on snow and ice accelerates the melting of these
reflective surfaces and consequently global warming. [Black carbon and
methane emissions also contribute directly to **air pollution** that
harms **human health**]{.underline}.

Due to their proximity to the Arctic, Arctic States are uniquely
positioned to slow Arctic warming caused by emissions of black carbon:
despite generating just ten percent of global black carbon emissions,
Arctic States are responsible for 30 percent of black carbon's warming
effects in the Arctic.

[AMAP has monitored black carbon and **methane emissions** and reported
on their effects as Arctic **climate forcers**]{.underline}. Based on
AMAP's findings, ACAP has developed pilot projects that build capacity
and demonstrate emission reduction activities. [These projects are aimed
at encouraging **national actions** to reduce emissions and releases of
these **pollutants**]{.underline}.

The Council's Expert Group on Black Carbon and Methane in turn has been
tasked by the Arctic States to develop a biennial "Summary of Progress
and Recommendations" based on the national reports and other relevant
information. These reports contain recommendations for an aspirational
collective goal on black carbon.

Center, Arctic Biodiversity: Increasing Richness Accompanies Shrinking
Refugia for a Cold-Associated Tundra Fauna, 6 Ecosphere art159
(Wiley-Blackwell 2015).

Understanding [[how biodiversity]{.underline}]{.mark} at high latitudes,
including species richness and associated genetic diversity, [[will
respond to rapidly changing environments]{.underline}]{.mark} is
critical considering that Arctic climate predictions suggest continued
warming into the next century (Diffenbaugh and Giorgi 2012, Overland et
al. 2013). Warmer and wetter conditions are shifting organismal
distributions and changing demography (Prowse et al. 2009, Pauls et al.
2013). For instance, poleward latitudinal climate shifts will decrease
the extent of the tundra biome as the Arctic Ocean delimits a northern
barrier (Hof et al. 2012). Known as the Arctic squeeze (Meltofte 2013),
decreasing area may translate to fewer individuals, decreasing β
diversity, loss of genetic variants, and potentially decreased adaptive
potential for tundra specialists (Hofreiter and Barnes 2010, Pauls et
al. 2013, Yannic et al. 2014). As a consequence, the Arctic tundra biome
is of conservation concern because non-migratory species associated with
this relatively young and depauperate biome are adapted to cold
environments that have prevailed at high latitudes through much of the
Quaternary (2.6 Myr; Abbott and Brochmann 2003, Callaghan et al. 2004).
[[Historical biogeographic]{.mark} [studies revealed that Arctic species
persisted]{.mark}]{.underline} in refugial areas through previous
climatic warm phases (e.g., Fedorov and Stenseth 2002, Abbott and
Brochmann 2003, Brunhoff et al. 2003, Hewitt 2004, Hope et al. 2013a),
but continued persistence under current climate trends may depend on our
ability to locate and accommodate refugial regions for Arctic
biodiversity in an increasingly anthropic landscape (Chapin et al. 2006,
Kuemmerle et al. 2014, Raynolds et al. 2014). In the northern refugium
known as Beringia, large areas spanning northeastern Asia and
northwestern North America remained ice-free throughout the Quaternary
(Hultén 1937). During glacial climate phases, the Beringian refugium
represented both a center of endemic genetic diversity and a corridor
for movement between the northern continents (Cook et al. 2005, Waltari
et al. 2007, Eidesen et al. 2013). Communities now occurring within
Beringia reflect constituent species, or distinct lineages within
species, that have evolutionary origins elsewhere in either Eurasia or
North America, as well as taxa that diverged and adapted in situ.
Community turnover in Beringia through time has thus been pervasive
(Post et al. 2009, Eidesen et al. 2013) and this dynamic region
connecting processes throughout the Holarctic represents a valuable
arena for investigating how species with diverse ecological requirements
and evolutionary histories respond to dramatic climate fluctuations
(Callaghan et al. 2004). Here we test hypotheses related to regional
changes in biodiversity, a critical step for understanding both global
atmospheric influences and impacts across distinct biomes that result in
novel communities (Barnosky et al. 2012). [[We apply genetic and
niche-based approaches]{.mark} in a comparative context, [reflecting 15
years of phylogeographic studies]{.mark} across 28 species]{.underline}
of high-latitude mammals to statistically address hypotheses concerning
(1) consistency of inferences across both ecological and evolutionary
analyses; (2) differences in total diversity versus diversity within
distinct biomes; and (3) different management implications reflecting
heterogeneity in landscape characteristics and land uses. The questions
that frame these hypotheses, as outlined below, are associated with
assessing demographic change of multiple species (Hope et al. 2013b,
Wood et al. 2013) in response to late-Quaternary climate trends as a
means of building confidence in forecasts of contemporary trends.
Biogeographic responses to climate change may be estimated by
implementing climate-based distribution models (Bellard et al. 2012, Hof
et al. 2012) or through interpretations based on evolutionary signatures
(Avise 2000, Hewitt 2004). Increasingly, coupling species distribution
models (SDMs) with testing alternative phylogeographic scenarios allows
for a more rigorous exploration and synthesis of both ecological and
evolutionary approaches (Carnaval et al. 2009, Knowles and
Alvarado-Serrano 2010, Chan et al. 2011, Lorenzen et al. 2011, Prost et
al. 2013). Development of comparative phylogeographic methods that
incorporate coalescent theory also facilitates increased analytical
power through simultaneous analyses of multiple co-distributed taxa
(Hickerson et al. 2010, Palsbøll et al. 2013). Our first question
therefore assesses the effectiveness of integrating multiple disciplines
for comparative community analyses. Specifically, is there consistency
among predicted changes in biodiversity using alternate statistical
perspectives from ecological and evolutionary data analyses? Making
fundamental links between ecological responses of species and
evolutionary processes associated with environmental change should
provide a powerful approach for investigating changes in biodiversity.
We incorporate data from both SDMs and genetic demographic analyses
across multiple communities to reciprocally verify and refine inferences
of distributional and demographic changes in biodiversity. We show that
integrating methods can significantly increase confidence in forecasting
biodiversity responses to climate, producing robust distributional
hypotheses (predictions) that may be empirically tested and refined into
the next century---a valuable management need. Since onset of the
current interglacial phase (\~11 ka), tundra has receded and the
temperate-adapted boreal biome has shifted northward (Lessa et al. 2003,
Hewitt 2004). Secondary contact between boreal and tundra biomes in
Beringia during Quaternary interglacial phases resulted in novel species
interactions across ecotonal areas (Stewart and Lister 2001, Hof et al.
2012). External climate forcing is moving the current boreal-tundra
ecotone northward (Frost and Epstein 2014) and creating challenges for
conservationists and land managers who seek to maintain ecological
function and promote overall biodiversity while protecting endemic
tundra components (Usher et al. 2005). Therefore, our second question is
what can we expect in the near-future concerning changes in total
biodiversity at high latitudes as related to differential changes among
distinct tundra (Arctic) and boreal (sub-Arctic) communities? This
question reflects the possibility of fundamental differences in
responses among communities with different ecological affinities,
particularly with respect to their relative velocities of change
(Schloss et al. 2012). We therefore test whether boreal and tundra
mammals are responding to contemporary climate with H0: the same, or H1:
different velocities of change. Marked differences between boreal and
tundra mammalian responses emphasize different life histories among
communities that are experiencing increasing overlap through time, with
potentially severe implications for future resilience of tundra species
as communities reform. [[Extended persistence of tundra
species]{.underline}]{.mark} through multiple glacial phases [[indicates
**resiliency**]{.mark}]{.underline} within this biome to climate cycling
through the Quaternary and suggests that [at least some elements of
[tundra communities will continue to persist in the face of modern
changes]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, the most recent Wisconsinan
glacial cycle (\~110--11 ka) was distinctive because humans became an
integral part of the biosphere, significantly influencing wildlife
abundance and distribution through hunting and land-use changes (Duerden
2004, Cook et al. 2006, Bellard et al. 2012). Atmospheric changes and
associated climate warming of the Anthropocene have surpassed levels of
previous Quaternary interglacial maxima, and in the future the northern
high latitudes will be characterized by novel environments (Overland et
al. 2013, Reu et al. 2014). In addition to global-scale climate changes,
Arctic amplification is prevalent at northern high-latitudes and is also
[accompanied by increased localized activities related to industrial
development,]{.underline} harvest of biological resources, science, and
tourism (Duerden 2004, Hinzman et al. 2005, Raynolds et al. 2014). The
footprint of these activities includes areas recognized as warm-phase
refugia for tundra species and essential for persistence through their
evolutionary history (Hope et al. 2013b). Within Alaska (constituting a
large portion of eastern Beringia), 89% of the land area (\~134M ha) is
administered by multiple state or federal agencies with significant
differences in mission reflected by differing management regimes
(http://www.alaskacenters.gov/partners.cfm). Understanding the
ecological and spatiotemporal evolutionary responses of species to past
and contemporary climate changes will help inform future planning.
Balancing potentially competing objectives, for instance of wildlife
conservation and resource extraction (Ford and Smit 2004, Kuemmerle et
al. 2014), will be complicated by significant uncertainty concerning the
long-term stability of ecosystems (Hinzman et al. 2005, Barnosky et al.
2012). Our final question assesses how knowledge of shifting communities
may influence land-use decisions across a landscape characterized by
multiple units with differing objectives. Specifically, what are the
differences in major regional management implications considering a
broad-scale community approach? We tested whether distributional changes
among major regional land-use areas across the Alaskan landscape are
expected to be H0: homogeneous, reflecting a broad cross-site trend in
biodiversity change that can be extrapolated through the Holarctic, or
H1: heterogeneous, indicating a need for careful consideration of
regional processes, and to assess related communities distributed across
the Holarctic independently.

Knowledge Gaps [[Arctic regions]{.mark} contain a complex variety of
habitats, most of which [are difficult to access]{.mark}. Despite a
recent increase in overall interest and research effort, [observational
gaps]{.mark} still remain]{.underline} for some geographic areas (Figure
1a), taxa, and habitats. [The decades-long lack of interest and the
logistical challenges posed by filling these gaps are now
[lead]{.mark}ing [to **uncertainties** about]{.mark} the [biodiversity
patterns]{.mark}]{.underline} (Figure 1b) [and the extent of ongoing
changes.]{.underline} Compiling information on the status quo and making
informed predictions into the future require open data sharing in online
data systems, as, for example, outlined in the data policy of the
International Polar Year 2007--2009 and followed by some of its projects
(e.g., Bluhm et al., 2010b), with regrettably overall weak compliance to
date (Carlson, 2011). Incomplete species/OTU lists are clearly largest
in the microbial realm, including fungi. For the bacteria and archaea,
diversity estimates are largely based on the scaling of a limited number
of observations (Lovejoy et al., 2011). The recent inventory of marine
pelagic and sea ice unicellular eukaryotes (Poulin et al., 2011)
demonstrated the largest gap in knowledge to be in the diversity of
small cells (\< 20 μm), which represented less than 20% of their
assessment; however, their effort did not include lesser-known groups
such as pelagic ciliates or benthic microalgae. On higher trophic
levels, including seabirds and marine mammals, gaps still exist in the
knowledge of species distributions and population numbers, as well as
their temporal trends, sensitivities, and reasons for change (other than
a human role per se) (Huettmann et al. 2011; Kovacs et al., 2011).
Regional gaps still exist in the deep sea, in particular at depths over
1,000 m, despite considerable sampling effort in the past decade (e.g.,
Soltwedel et al., 2005; Bluhm et al., 2011). Of the shelf seas, the East
Siberian Sea is probably the most understudied in terms of biodiversity,
although an intense study by the Zoological Institute in St. Petersburg
is ongoing. Large gaps also exist in the vast area of the Canadian
Arctic Archipelago (Carr, 2011) and northern Greenland, both of which
still remain heavily ice-covered. [Examples of underexplored habitats
include the deep-sea ridge systems spanning thousands of kilometers
across the Arctic as well as special features such as pockmarks and
seamounts. In the sea ice realm, pressure ridge biodiversity studies are
only now starting to emerge]{.underline} (Hop and Pavlova, 2008;
Gradinger et al., 2010b), [although this habitat may play an
increasingly important role in light of the diminishing ice cover.
Ironically, while nearshore [habitats]{.mark} have been extensively
studied, they [are]{.mark} typically [only]{.mark} well [investigated
in]{.mark} the vicinity of [field stations]{.mark} and [not at **broader
scales** that capture the **full range** of]{.mark} habitat types and
[heterogeneities]{.mark}.]{.underline} Outlook [Recent updates of Arctic
species inventories across all taxonomic levels demonstrate the presence
of close to 8,000 eukaryotic species]{.underline} (i.e., excluding
Eubacteria and Archaea). Cautious estimates predict that [several
thousand benthic invertebrate species still remain to be
recorded]{.underline} (Bluhm et al., 2011; Carr, 2011; Piepenburg et
al., 2011). It is clear that [Arctic ecosystems will be subjected to a
variety of pressures in the future]{.underline} (e.g., ACIA, 2005;
Johnsen et al., 2010), [and [prediction of]{.mark} future [Arctic
"species richness"]{.mark} in time and space [is **complicated**]{.mark}
by an interplay of factors capable of either increasing or decreasing
the overall species richness in the coming decades]{.underline}
(Weslawski et al., 2011). [Species richness can increase]{.underline},
for example, [when northward-advected boreal species mix with Arctic
residents, and when perennial algae and associated fauna replace
seasonal communities in previously icescoured nearshore
areas]{.underline} (Vermeij and Roopnarine, 2008; Weslawski et al.,
2008, 2011). Species richness can decrease through habitat
homogenization and increasing sedimentation associated with glacial melt
and increased river runoff, and when biota associated with multiyear ice
loses its habitat (e.g., Kędra et al., 2010; Weslawski et al., 2011).
[[Species richness might]{.mark} even [stay **stable**
if]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example, [[southern species **replace**
functionally similar Arctic species, or]{.mark} because existing
[**adaptations** to seasonally low food availability, variable
temperatures, and other factors might **buffer Arctic biota against some
degree of change**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Pertsova and Kosobokova, 2010;
Weslawski et al., 2011). [Species richness, therefore, may not be the
most desirable single metric with which to evaluate biodiversity
changes, and should be considered along with **many other metrics**. The
competition of Arctic endemics and primarily Arctic-distributed biota
with temperate taxa is inevitable, and is expected]{.underline} (if not
already observed; see above) [to lead to the reduction of "typical"
Arctic populations, species, communities, and/ or habitat]{.underline}
(e.g., Weslawski et al., 2008; CAFF, 2010). The examples of ongoing
changes on species and communities levels demonstrate the value and
necessity of related surveys that are systematic and methodologically
comparable in nature. Such surveys are required on both regional and
pan-Arctic scales to detect change and inform both shortterm and
long-term conservation and management plans. As stressed also by CAFF
(2010) and UNEP, these plans should include identifying and protecting
biologically important marine areas (Johnsen et al., 2010; Huettmann and
Hazlett, 2010).

[India and Russia play significant roles in climate change negotiations
and efforts to combat climate change, despite their respective
challenges and emissions profiles.]{.underline} India, being the
third-largest consumer of oil, faces the task of balancing its fossil
fuel consumption, which is seen as crucial for economic development,
with its commitment to being a responsible global stakeholder in climate
change issues. On the other hand, Russia, as a major exporter of fossil
fuels and with a carbon-intensive economy, aims to maintain its status
as an energy superpower while ensuring social and economic stability and
working towards achieving carbon neutrality.

In terms of emissions, India is the third-largest emitter of carbon
dioxide, while Russia ranks fourth. However, India\'s per capita carbon
dioxide emissions are lower than those of many developed countries,
including Russia. Despite this, both countries\' climate policies have
been assessed by the Climate Action Tracker as falling short of the
required standards set by the Paris Agreement. India\'s climate policies
are considered \"highly insufficient,\" while Russia\'s are rated as
\"critically insufficient,\" indicating that their efforts are not in
line with the Paris Agreement\'s objective of limiting global warming to
1.5°C.

[India and Russia have a history of bilateral collaboration,
particularly in the field of nuclear energy, which can contribute to
India\'s transition towards cleaner energy sources]{.underline}. The
Kudankulam nuclear power project in Tamil Nadu, for instance, involves
the construction of six nuclear reactors by Russian enterprises. The
first two units are already operating at full capacity, and work is
underway on the third unit. [President Putin has expressed Russia\'s
readiness to build an additional 12 reactors in India over the next two
decades, further strengthening their cooperation in the nuclear energy
sector]{.underline}.46

[India and Russia hold differing views on climate change compared to the
West, primarily due to their unique circumstances and considerations. In
the case of Russia, its heavy reliance on fossil fuel exports as a
crucial revenue source, coupled with its limited economic
diversification, hampers its ability to minimize fossil fuel
usage]{.underline}. This economic dependence makes it challenging for
Russia to prioritize reducing fossil fuel consumption, despite
recognizing the importance of addressing climate change concerns. The
country\'s carbon-intensive economy further complicates efforts towards
transitioning to cleaner energy sources. Tynkkynen and Tynkkynen (2018)
argue that the Russian climate change discourse emphasizes the
country\'s Great Power status, highlighting its sovereignty and fossil
energy resources as fundamental components of this status.

[Similarly, India faces the predicament of being one of the largest
consumers and importers of fossil fuels]{.underline}. As mentioned
earlier, [India\'s stance on climate change underscores the perceived
hypocrisy of the West,]{.underline} which industrialized using fossil
fuels and contributed significantly to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions[.
India questions the Western insistence on developing countries managing
their development without relying on fossil fuels.]{.underline} [This
shared viewpoint between Russia and India reflects a critical
perspective on the distribution of responsibilities for climate change
mitigation. Both countries,]{.underline} as members of BRICS,
[argue]{.underline} that the [burden of addressing climate change should
primarily lie with wealthy industrial nations]{.underline}, given their
historical contributions as the primary producers of GHG emissions (Mizo
2016).

Furthermore, both Russia and India exhibit limited media debate and
relatively lower public interest in climate change compared to the West.
Studies by Keller et al. (2019) on India and Yagodin (2021) on Russia
reveal a lack of extensive public discourse or limited public engagement
with climate change issues in these countries. This factor contributes
to the complexity of climate change negotiations and policymaking, as it
suggests that public pressure for more ambitious climate action may be
relatively lower in comparison.

India and Russia share a similar perspective on the securitization of
climate change negotiations and the involvement of the United Nations
Security Council (UNSC). While the West, including the [United States
and European Union, aim to bring climate change into the agenda of the
UNSC, India and Russia advocate for climate change discussions to remain
within the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA]{.underline}), rather
than being addressed by a specialized organ of the UN[. India has
consistently rejected alarmist notions regarding climate security,
viewing such discourse as a Western strategy to impose its climate
change agenda on India]{.underline} (Boas 2014).

As early as 2007, India, along with China, opposed discussing climate
change at the Security Council, arguing that the Council lacked the
mandate to address climate change and contending that climate change
would not have significant security implications (Rajamani 2009). In
2021, both India and Russia voted against a draft resolution at the
Security Council, which aimed to securitize climate change and was
supported by a majority of members. Their opposition stemmed from the
belief that framing climate change as a threat to global security would
divert attention from the actual causes of conflict in different
countries and potentially be exploited by developed nations to deny
assistance to developing countries. They do not perceive a direct link
between global security and climate change, and there are concerns that
coercive actions may be taken under the pretext of addressing climate
change.

Additionally, [the West has sought to incorporate issues such as
inequality and indigenous rights into the climate change agenda. Moscow
objects to these attempts to link climate change with gender, indigenous
rights, and other related issues. India may also resist such efforts,
despite recognizing that climate change can have differential impacts on
various population segments]{.underline}. This could explain India\'s
decision not to sign the Glasgow Women\'s Leadership statement, which
calls for the promotion of women and girls\' role in addressing climate
change. Given India\'s strong emphasis on sovereignty, it is likely to
resist any perceived interference by the West in its domestic affairs.

In summary, [there is a convergence of views between India and Russia
regarding the securitization of climate change negotiations. Both
countries advocate for climate change discussions to remain under the
purview of the UNGA rather than the UNSC. They perceive attempts to
securitize climate change as potential distractions from addressing the
root causes of conflicts and potential tools for developed countries to
withhold assistance from developing nations]{.underline}. Furthermore,
both countries resist efforts to expand the climate change agenda to
include issues like inequality and indigenous rights, viewing them as
potential Western interventions in their domestic affairs.

Conclusion

Both India and Russia will undoubtedly experience the consequences of
climate change, including sea-level rise, coastal inundation, and severe
natural disasters. [Recognizing the need to address these challenges,
both countries require technology transfer to effectively respond to the
effects of climate change, often relying on the West for technological
support. However, there exists an opportunity for India and Russia to
collaborate and develop new technologies, rather than solely depending
on the West, leveraging their robust history of scientific
collaboration.]{.underline}

Although India and Russia possess immense potential for wind and solar
energy, they currently lack expertise in green technology and rely on
the West for technological advancements in this area. [By joining
forces, the two countries can collaborate on the invention of innovative
technologies to harness renewable energy sources and enhance the
efficiency of existing technologies]{.underline}. Notably, Russia\'s
technological capabilities in producing green hydrogen align with the
growing demand for this clean energy source. Establishing pipelines to
transport green hydrogen from Russia to India, possibly through China,
would not only benefit India but also facilitate collaboration between
the two nations47.

In the energy sector, it is worth mentioning that India has been
purchasing liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Russia through a long-term
agreement with GAIL, its main gas company. However, sanctions resulting
from the Ukraine invasion have affected these supplies, despite GAIL
receiving 2 million tonnes of LNG in 202148. If the sanctions were
lifted, the agreement could be revived and expanded, strengthening
energy cooperation between India and Russia.

Russia\'s substantial biomass resources, such as wood waste, low-grade
wood, and agricultural residues, present another potential area of
collaboration between New Delhi and Moscow. These biomass resources can
be utilized to produce biofuels, offering an alternative and sustainable
energy source. Collaborating on biofuel production and sharing expertise
in this field could benefit both countries and contribute to their
efforts in combating climate change.

[Disaster risk management and information sharing provide another avenue
for collaboration between India and Russia. Given the shared challenges
of climate change impacts, cooperating in disaster risk management
strategies, exchanging knowledge, and sharing best practices can enhance
their preparedness and response mechanisms, ultimately mitigating the
negative consequences of natural disasters.]{.underline}

Furthermore, the Northern Sea Route (NSR) presents a significant
opportunity for collaboration between the two nations. With the Arctic
ice melting, the NSR is becoming increasingly viable and economically
attractive as the shortest sea route between Russia\'s European part and
the Far East. Recognizing the potential of the NSR, India, as a member
of the Arctic Circle, has expressed interest in contributing to its
development as an international trade artery. By promoting the NSR as an
alternative marine transport route to the existing land corridor between
Russia and India, the loss of shipping liquefied natural gas (LNG) from
Russia to India can be reduced. This, in turn, would contribute to
lowering Indian emissions both in the use of LNG and its transportation.

### 1NC---No Impact---Warming

#### Warming [isn't existential]{.underline}. Any pathway to extinction is [unlikely]{.underline}. 

James **Pethokoukis 25**. Senior fellow and the DeWitt Wallace Chair at
the American Enterprise Institute. Citing Toby Ord, PhD and Senior
Researcher at Oxford University. "My chat (+transcript) with researcher
Toby Ord on existential risk." January 31, 2025.
https://fasterplease.substack.com/p/my-chat-transcript-with-researcher

Pethokoukis: Let\'s just start out by taking a brief tour through the
existential landscape and how you see it now versus when you first wrote
the book The Precipice, which I\'ve mentioned frequently in my writings.
I love that book, love to see a sequel at some point, maybe one\'s in
the works . . . but let\'s start with the existential risk, which has
dominated many people\'s thinking for the past quarter-century, which is
[climate change]{.underline}.

My sense is, not just you, but many [people are somewhat less worried
than they were five years ago]{.underline}, 10 years ago. Perhaps they
see at least the [**most** extreme outcomes **less
likely**]{.underline}. How do you see it?

Ord: I would agree with that. I\'m not sure that everyone sees it that
way, but there were [two really big and good pieces of news on climate
that were rarely reported in the media]{.underline}. One of them is that
there\'s the [question about how many emissions there\'ll
be]{.underline}. We don\'t know how much carbon humanity will emit into
the atmosphere before we get it under control, and there are these
different emissions pathways, these RCP 4.5 and things like this you\'ll
have heard of. And often, whe[n people would give a sketch of how bad
things could be, they would talk about RCP 8.5,]{.underline} which is
the [worst of these pathways, and we\'re very **clearly** not on that,
and we\'re also]{.underline}, I think pretty clearly now, not on RCP 6,
either. So [the two **worst pathways**]{.underline}, we\'re [pretty
clearly not on]{.underline}, and so that\'s pretty good news that we\'re
kind of [headed more towards one of the **better** pathways in terms of
the emissions]{.underline} that we\'ll put out there.

What are we doing right?

Ultimately, some of those pathways were based on business-as-usual ideas
that there wouldn\'t be climate change as one of the biggest issues in
the international political sphere over decades. So ultimately, [nations
have been **switching** over to renewables and **low-carbon** forms of
power]{.underline}, which is good news. They could be doing it much more
of it, but it\'s still good news. Back when we initially created these
things, I think we would\'ve been surprised and happy to find out that
we were going to end up among the better two pathways instead of the
worst ones.

The other big one is that, as well as how much we\'ll admit, [there\'s
the question of **how bad** is it to have a certain amount of **carbon**
in the atmosphere]{.underline}? In particular, how much warming does it
produce? And this is something of which there\'s been [massive
uncertainty]{.underline}. The general idea is that we\'re trying to
predict, if we were to [double the amount of carbon in the atmosphere
compared to pre-industrial times]{.underline}, how many degrees of
warming would there be? The best guess since the year I was born, 1979,
has been three degrees of warming, but the [uncertainty has been
somewhere between one and a half degrees and four and a
hal]{.underline}f.

Is that Celsius or Fahrenheit, by the way?

This is all Celsius. The [climate community has kept the same
uncertainty]{.underline} from 1979 all the way up to 2020, and it's a
wild level of uncertainty: Four and a half degrees of warming is three
times one and a half degrees of warming, so the range is up to triple
these levels of degrees of warming based on this amount of carbon. So
[**massive uncertainty** that hadn\'t changed over many
decades]{.underline}.

Now they\'ve actually revised that and have actually brought in the
[range of uncertainty]{.underline}. Now they\'re pretty sure that it\'s
somewhere [between two and a half and four degrees]{.underline}, and
this is based on better understanding of climate feedbacks. [This is
good news if you\'re concerned about worst-case climate
change]{.underline}. It\'s saying it\'s closer to the central estimate
than we\'d previously thought, whereas previously we thought that there
was a pretty high chance that it could even be higher than four and a
half degrees of warming.

When [you hear these targets of one and a half degrees]{.underline} of
warming or two degrees of warming, [they sound **quite
precise**]{.underline}, but in reality, we were just so uncertain of how
much warming would follow from any particular amount of emissions that
it was very hard to know. And that could mean that things are better
than we\'d thought, but it could also mean things could be much worse.
And if you are concerned about existential risks from climate change,
[then those kind of **tail events** where it\'s much worse than we
would\'ve thought the things would really get]{.underline}, and we\'re
now pretty [sure that we\'re not on one of those extreme emissions
pathways and also that we\'re not in a world where the temperature is
**extremely sensitive** to those emissions]{.underline}.

Is Not Largely Fictional,\" Breakthrough Institute,
https://thebreakthrough.org/journal/no-20-spring-2024/no-our-adaptation-to-global-warming-is-not-largely-fictional)

On September 23rd, the New York Times ran a David Wallace-Wells column
called "Our Adaptation to Global Warming Is Largely Fictional" featuring
"a new, eye-opening paper," entitled "Are We Adapting to Climate
Change?" The paper purports to show that there is limited evidence of
human adaptation to climate change across a wide range of sectors,
including human deaths, agricultural productivity, crime, conflict,
economic output, and damages from flooding and tropical cyclones.

The paper supposedly counters the Pollyannaish view that "adaptation has
been a hugely underappreciated success story."

Count me as someone who thinks that "[adaptation has been a **hugely
underappreciated success story**]{.underline}." However, this is not
just some assumption that is "taken for granted" but is instead based on
examining large-scale empirical trends in climate-sensitive outcomes.
For example, [as it has **warmed**]{.underline} over the past several
decades, [we have observed]{.underline} almost **[universally
higher]{.underline}** crop **[yields]{.underline}**, [translating to
more calories available per person, and a **reduction in
death**]{.underline} rate[s from **malnutrition** and
**famines**]{.underline}. [Access to safe drinking **water** has
**increased**, while the prevalence of **climate-sensitive diseases**
like malaria has **decreased**]{.underline}. Furthermore, [**mortality**
rates due to **extreme
temp**]{.underline}erature**[s]{.underline}**---[**both** **cold**
and]{.underline} **[heat]{.underline}**---[have **declined**, as have
deaths from]{.underline} natural **[disasters]{.underline}**. Finally,
[we have seen precipitous declines in damage from natural disasters as a
fraction of the value exposed.]{.underline}

So what's going on? Are we adapting to climate change or not? The "new,
eye-opening\" paper argues we have not, but it does so in a misleading
way.

First, let me offer what I think are intuitive, common-sense definitions
of adapting to climate change:

Adaptation: Climate is changing, and we are adjusting fast enough so
that outcomes stay the same over time.

No adaptation: Climate is changing, and we are not adjusting; thus,
outcomes are getting worse over time.

Mal-adaptation: Climate is changing, and we are changing in ways that
exacerbate climate change problems, worsening outcomes more than they
would have been from climate change alone.

Super-adaptation: [Climate is changing, and we are changing **even
faster**]{.underline} ([not necessarily because of climate
change]{.underline}), [so outcomes are improving over time.]{.underline}

One important nuance is that society\'s exposure to various climates and
extreme weather hazards is also changing over time. After all, there are
three times more people on the planet than there were in 1950. So, a
population increase in hot parts of the world might mean more deaths
from extreme heat simply because there are more people exposed to
extreme heat, and that wouldn\'t necessarily imply mal-adaptation to
climate change. Thus, [studies on changes in climate-related outcomes
over time should express outcomes in rates like "deaths per number of
people exposed." When **studies** define adaptation in this
broad]{.underline} (I'd argue common sense) [way, they **overwhelmingly
show super-adaptation**]{.underline}. For example, **[empirical
ev]{.underline}**idence [of **declining** global **vulnerability** to
climate]{.underline}-related [hazards showed clear globally declining
**death** rate**s** and economic **damage** rates for floods, droughts,
extreme temperatures, and extreme winds]{.underline}.

However, this broad definition of adaptation is not common in the
academic literature, where [adaptation tends to be **narrowly** defined
as only those technologies or behaviors that are more beneficial in a
changed climate than they are in an unchanged one]{.underline}. For
example, according to some papers, if technology increases crop yields
equally in the current and future climates, it should not be considered
adaptation. Definitions like this allow for striking claims like the
IPCC's that adaptation is supposedly "insufficient to offset the
negative impacts of climate change" for crop yields despite the fact
that crop yields have been increasing steadily as the climate has
warmed.

So is this narrow definition of climate adaptation the reason why the
aforementioned study covered by the New York Times finds such minimal
effect of adaptation?

Not quite. [In the paper, they say that they take a broad view of
adaptation, but are able to present a negative view of our adaptive
capacities by focusing on the relative changes in adaptation within each
decade:]{.underline}

"To quantify the net eﬀect of these and any other adaptive actions that
could have taken place, we estimate whether the sensitivity of a range
of societal outcomes to a fixed change in climate has changed over
time."

So, in this case, it's not an intentionally narrow definition that
accounts for the small effectiveness of adaptation that they calculate.
Instead, the apparent discrepancy comes down to the word sensitivity
above, which is doing a tremendous amount of work. In the paper,
sensitivity refers to the response of an outcome for a given climate
fluctuation, but critically, it is relative to the decade average for
that outcome.

Let's illustrate with an example. [The paper finds maladaptation in some
outcomes, like Brazilian soybean yields]{.underline}. This may sound odd
to people familiar with South American agriculture because Brazilian
soybean yields have tripled since the 1960s as Brazil has warmed.

[This has been driven by growing global demand stimulating
**productivity improvements** and thus enhancing supply]{.underline}.
Specifically, Brazilian soybean [**yields** have benefited from improved
**crop varieties**, including **genetically modified** versions that
are]{.underline} more **[resistant to pests]{.underline}**,
**[diseases]{.underline}**, [and **adverse weather**]{.underline}
conditions, **[fertilizer use]{.underline}**, [**precise irrigation**
management]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} the **[mechanization of
farming]{.underline}**. [These tech]{.underline}nological [advances have
**overwhelmed** any negative impact from climate change, so how does the
paper find mal-adaptation?]{.underline}

Adapt yields

Well, in the 1970s, Brazil used to produce 1.5 tonnes/hectare of
soybeans for growing seasons that were normal and 1.42 tonnes/hectare of
soybeans for growing seasons that were 1°C hotter than normal (26°C) or
a 5% decline.

By the 2010s, Brazil's average productivity had doubled to 3.0
tonnes/hectare of soybeans for normal growing seasons but was reduced to
2.67 tonnes/hectare for growing seasons that were 1°C hotter year than
normal (27°C).

So that\'s an 88% increase in output for a given +1°C variation!
However, the paper's methodology defines sensitivities as being relative
to each decade. Since 11% is larger than 5%, it concludes that we have
become less adapted to climate change over time.

The New York Times article writes that,

"On three-quarters of the impacts they studied, our vulnerability to
warming hasn't improved at all, meaning that a given climate event would
be just as damaging as 50 years ago --- perhaps more damaging."

But this statement will mislead the vast majority of readers. The "more
damaging" phrase is only true if it is interpreted as "more damaging
relative to the constantly rising background level," it's not "more
damaging" than 50 years ago in any absolute sense. The same is true for
the other outcomes they study, like death rates from floods, and extreme
temperatures or economic damage. [When decreases in vulnerability emerge
over decades, they are not allowed to count as adaptation and thus will
be neglected by this study.]{.underline}

Investigating the question of whether relative sensitivities for
adaptive capacity are changing over time is a fine exercise for an
academic paper that explicitly acknowledges the long-term improvement in
outcomes. But [shifting the goal posts of what adaptation means to
present an overly negative portrayal is something else]{.underline}.
Further, the use of the word adaptation only serves to confuse because a
definition of adaptation that is intuitive to most people would simply
measure if we are becoming more or less vulnerable to given
weather-related extremes compared to the past.

[This]{.underline} common **[denigration of adaptation]{.underline}**
does no service to us because it [**misinforms** the public and
policymakers and **diverts attention** away from **repeatable success**
stories]{.underline}. Adaptation to the climate is a function of
decisions we collectively make and should remain a priority for
humanity. [The improvements in adaptation of the past decades are
**repeatable**]{.underline}, [but only if we understand them as success
stories, and they are not denigrated to **sell a narrative** that our
society is **collapsing** under the weight of climate
change.]{.underline}

The first thing to note is that [the earth has been **much hotter** in
the past than even the most dire warming projections predict it will
soon become. During the]{.underline} Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum
([PETM]{.underline}) 55 million years ago, [the earth was an astounding
14-**17°C** above the pre-industrial average, but species extinctions
were **limited**]{.underline}. Here is Halstead:

> Overall, in the PETM, [temperatures were upwards of 17°C higher than
> pre-industrial levels and the only species that went extinct that we
> know of was a **single-celled marine organism**, and on land it was a
> time of **ecological flourishing**, **persistence** and
> **diversity**.]{.underline}

But if the scorching temperatures of the PETM did not lead to
existential catastrophe, why believe that lower levels of warming will
now destroy humanity? We saw in Part 2 that even Ord seems concerned by
this thought:

> The best argument against ... unknown mechanisms \[for extinction\] is
> probably that the PETM \[Paleocene--Eocene Thermal Maximum\] did not

However, [Ord suggests that]{.underline} even though the PETM was hotter
than the 21st century will be, [warming during the PETM was slower than
the rapid warming we are now experiencing]{.underline}:

> Most importantly, anthropogenic warming could be over a hundred times
> faster than warming during the PETM, and rapid warming has been
> suggested as a contributing factor in the end-Permian mass extinction,
> in which 96 percent of species went extinct.

Fair enough. But Halstead has something to say about that too.

Citing Willis and MacDonald (2011), Halstead reminds us that [we have
seen rapid warming before:]{.underline}

a.  [In Greenland, temperatures may have risen by **10°C**]{.underline},
    though this may be an error in climate proxies.

b.  [In the Swiss Alps]{.underline} and other parts of Europe[, a
    warming of 2 to **5°C** appears to have occurred in **200
    years**]{.underline} or less.

c.  [In the Sierra Nevada]{.underline} of California, [rates of warming
    in the late glacial may have been 4 to **5°C** every **500
    years**]{.underline} around 15,000 years ago.

d.  [At the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, there were
    increases of 5°C and more over a few decades]{.underline} (11,700
    years ago).

e.  [Data from Greenland ice cores suggest that a **\>10°C** warming may
    have occurred over 20 to **6 years**]{.underline} (13,000 to 11,000
    years ago).

f.  [In California, warming at the close of the Younger
    Dryas]{.underline} (13,000 years ago) [may have been on the order of
    **3°C** in less than **100** to 200 years]{.underline}.

g.  [For the entire Southwest US, a general warming of **4°C** may have
    occurred in **less than a century**]{.underline} (13,000 to 11,000
    years ago).

Just as [history gives us **abundant evidence** of large mammals
surviving temperatures **hotter** than the earth is projected to be by
2100, history also gives us evidence of survival at rates of warming
**comparable to the worst-case scenarios** in the IPCC
report.]{.underline}

Even [the worst-looking scenarios give cause for comfort]{.underline}.
For example, [in the beginning of the Holocene]{.underline} (\~10,000
BCE), [climate change did seem to play a role in the extinction of
megafauna]{.underline} (large animals). But there is little evidence of
plant extinctions, and many megafauna survived. In particular, Halstead
notes, [humans lived, and by all appearances thrived during this
time]{.underline}. And as for the megafauna who perished, a live
scientific hypothesis is the overkill hypothesis: they died because we
killed and ate them. (Halstead assigns this 90% credence, but notes that
many scientists may be closer to 50%). All of this gives us every reason
for confidence that [today's humans, with **greater numbers**,
**technology**, and **forewarning** than our ancestors, can **survive**
ongoing climate catastrophe.]{.underline}

While the [**Far East** has emerged as a **crucial region** of focus for
**Russia** in recent times, it is however yet to be **capitalised** by
'friendly' partners such as **India**]{.underline}. "Although [India
**desires** to gain from this region through active participation in
**development projects**, it is yet to bring **concrete
outcomes**]{.underline}. Given the growing importance that Russia
attaches to the Far East, the region needs due attention by India as it
acts as a conduit for connectivity and gain access to the Arctic region
and also to expand India's economic scope in the Indo-Pacific region.
The [Far East is therefore the much-needed **leverage** point for
**India** to expand its **geo-economic** outlook both in the Arctic and
in Indo-Pacific region]{.underline}".4Cooperationbetween [India and
Russia in the Far East is nevertheless in the larger context of the
**important developments** in the bilateral relations mainly through
**regional connectivity**]{.underline}, participation in economic
organisations, and merger of domestic policies.

While defence, energy and nuclear cooperation contribute a major part to
India-Russia economic engagement, sectors such as agriculture remain
limited in scope. Therefore, the [need for both India and Russia to tap
the potentials of **agricultural sector** is the need of the hour
especially in the context of the 'Russian Homestead Act' in 2016 and
India being host to one of the largest **agricultural farmers'
immigration** in the world]{.underline}. Hence, this article evaluates
the possible mechanisms through which the agricultural relations can be
enhanced by both the countries alongside a proposal for a pilot project
in the Far East that may be considered to assist in strengthening the
economic relations between India and Russia.

Russia's Agricultural Ambitions

There is a need to evaluate the relevance of the FAR and explore the
possible opportunities especially in tapping the agricultural sector
given Russia's growing focus in this sector and India as one of the
leading countries in agricultural production and farmers' immigration
across the world. Since the imposition of economic sanctions by the West
on Russia post re-claiming of Crimea in 2014, Russia has pledged to
diversify its economic revenue apart from its reliance on energy
markets. Interestingly, the sanctions have come as a boon to Russia's
agricultural sector as Russia has imposed embargo on imported
agricultural products from Western countries in retaliation for
sanctions. This has opened a window of opportunity for local farmers as
Russia is eyeing for self-sufficiency and import substitution from
domestic producers.

Russia's agricultural sector today has turned into a potential area as
its agricultural exports are in par with defence exports. Export
revenues from agriculture---which reached over \$20bn in 2017.5Today,
"Russia is the world's leading exporter of wheat shipping approximately
23.5 million tons worldwide in 2016. Russia aims to increase agriculture
production by 24.8% by 2020."6

The agricultural sector also requires the undivided attention of both
India and Russia as a key area of cooperation to strengthen the economic
engagement in the FAR.

Russia's Homestead Act

As mentioned earlier, [Russia on its part is making efforts to attract
international players including its bilateral partners to explore the
potentials that the Far East]{.underline} offers. One such effort is the
introduction of the 'Russian Homestead Act' in 2016. According to this
Act, Russia offers its citizens, and also foreign nationals, a free
hectare of land (2.5 acres) in the Far East for lawful purpose. The
condition, however, is that the owner of the land cannot rent, sell, or
give the land away for five years. Foreigners too can join the program,
but cannot own the land until 5 years after they have gained naturalised
Russian citizenship.7

The scope and evaluation of the Act is administered by the Ministry for
the Development of the Far East (MDFE) which has been renamed as
Ministry for the Development of the Russian Far East and Arctic (2019)
and the Far East Human Capital Development Agency. The role of the MDFE
is to coordinate state policies for eco­nomic and socio-demographic
development of the Far Eastern Federal District.8

The suggested key focus of the [**India-Russia engagement** in the Far
East may likely be in **attracting agricultural workforce** in the
region given **India's huge potential record** in agricultural sector
and farmers' **immigration** in the world]{.underline}. The introduction
of the 'Russian Homestead Act' in 2016 can therefore be a major focus in
[widening India-Russia agricultural engagement which may likely boost
**Indian farmers' presence** in the **Far East**]{.underline}.

How can India Engage in Russia's Agricultural Ambitions in the Far East?

[India is committed in its focus in enhancing its **geo-economic
interests** with Russia's FAR]{.underline}. In this direction, "India
has been [host to one of the largest immigration of farmers who are
largely specialised as **livestock workers**, horticulturalists and
agro-based service to countries such as Canada, which too has a bleak
climate such as the **Russian Far East**]{.underline}. Given the fact
that the Homestead Act provides similar [benefits to foreign nationals
too, India and Russia may initiate a pilot project that assists in
attracting Indian **farmers** to explore the potentials of the **Far
East**]{.underline}"9 for agricultural production and related services.

[Indian farmers can act as a **substitute** in production of some of
Russia's **import demands** such as soybean production, fruits,
vegetables and other agro-based products in the Far East]{.underline}.
"Soybean, for instance, contributes significantly to the Indian edible
oil pool as it contributes 43% to the total oilseeds and 25% to the
total oil production in the country. Currently, India ranks fourth in
respect to production of soybean in the world. Maharashtra and Madhya
Pradesh are the leading producers of soy, which contribute to 89% of the
total soybean production in country."10

# \--Disadvantages\--

## Food Security Disadvantage 

### 1NC---Food Security Disadvantage 

#### Indian food security is a house of cards.

**Jaffrelot et al '24** \[Christophe; August 20; A French political
scientist and Indologist specialising in South Asia, particularly India
and Pakistan; The Wire, "It\'s Not Just Food Price, India Is Facing a
Food Security Challenge,"
https://thewire.in/economy/its-not-just-food-price-india-is-facing-a-food-security-challenge\]

The [rise of food prices in India today remains insufficiently analysed
in terms of food security]{.underline}. Years ago Amartya Sen, in his
"Capability Theory", explained famines not only by a lack of food
availability but also by social and economic factors. According to him,
[famines occur when vulnerable populations can no longer access
available food due to a lack of means]{.underline}. This theory remains
valid today in India where undernutrition is primarily a function of
households' financial resources. But in the future, food security may
also be challenged in quantitative terms because of climate change.

Key factors of undernutrition

In today's India undernutrition is partly [due to one of the
contradictions of the Green Revolution]{.underline}. Certainly, this
"revolution" has resulted in a rapid increase of the production of
foodgrains (rice, wheat, and pulses) -- 2.5% per year from 1950 to 2007,
while the population increased by 2.1% per year. As a result, India
began to export rice and even wheat. But India continues to suffer from
chronic undernutrition partly because the Public Distribution System
gives cereals -- the key products of the Green Revolution -- to the poor
and not enough pulses, fruits and vegetables. This paradox was noted as
early as 2014 by Suresh Babu of the International Food Policy Research
Institute, in a highly interesting interview.

In 2021, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), while launching
its Regional Overview of Food Security and Nutrition, pointed out that
"74.1% of Indians were unable to afford a healthy diet". The trend is
worrying: in 2023, India ranked 111th out of the 125 countries
considered by the Global Hunger Index, an index whose calculation is
based on four criteria: the general undernutrition of the population,
the weight of children under five, their height, and their mortality
rate. India is increasingly falling in the ranking conducted every year
based on this index: it was ranked 107th in 2022, 103rd in 2018, 100th
in 2017, and 97th in 2016. Only Haiti and twelve countries in
sub-Saharan Africa were ranked lower than India. While India had seen
its index significantly improve from 35.5 to 29.2 between 2008 and 2015,
it has almost stagnated since then to reach 28.7 in 2023.

The latest National Family Health Survey 2019-2021 (NFHS-5) reveals that
about a third of Indian children under five years of age are underweight
and show growth retardation: 36% of children under five are too short
for their age, which is a sign of chronic undernutrition, 19% are too
thin for their height, which is also a sign of acute undernutrition,
while 32% are underweight.

Certainly, the prevalence of stunting and underweight has decreased
since 2015-16. Stunting affected 36% of the population in 2019-21,
compared to 38% in 2015-16. During the same period, the prevalence of
wasting (or emaciation) went from 21% in 2015-16 to 19% in 2019-21.
However, progress is very slow. The average annual rate of reduction
(AARR) between 2005-06 and 2019-2021 is 2.2%. If India continues at this
pace, the proportion of Indian children suffering from growth
retardation due to undernutrition will not fall below 10% until 2076.

Furthermore, according to the National Family Health Survey of 2019-21,
67% of children (aged 6 to 59 months) suffer from anemia. These figures
reflect a worsening of the situation because in 2015-16 the prevalence
of anaemia among children in this age category was "only" 59%. Among
adults, 57% of women (aged 15 to 49 years) were anaemic in 2019-21, as
well as a quarter of men in the same age group.

The data presented in the latest National Family Health Survey
displeased the government, which led to the suspension of the director
of the International Institute for Population Sciences, the agency in
charge of this report. The government decided that from now on, the NFHS
surveys will no longer measure anaemia. When the thermometer reveals a
fever that those at the top do not want to admit, it is considered good
practice to break it. This practice had already been observed in 2019:
when figures from the National Sample Survey Office revealed that the
percentage of Indians living below the poverty line had increased
between 2011-12 and 2017-18, the government cancelled its publication,
prompting two statisticians -- thanks to whom these figures are known --
to resign.

How much food is -- and will be -- available?

If the quality of the food the poor can get is at stake, the quantity is
not guaranteed -- and may not be sufficient in the future.

The problem is already palpable today. Although cereal production has
greatly increased, the quantity of "foodgrains" available per capita is
already decreasing, going from 510.1 grams per day per person in 1991 to
507.9 grams in 2021.

How is this essential variable calculated?

By subtracting from the total production seeds, concentrates for
animals, lost products, and the balance of imports/exports, and then
dividing the resulting figure by the population. While seeds only
marginally reduce the product, the same cannot be said for the other
three variables.

The FAO estimates that 40% of agricultural products are lost in India
due to poor storage conditions, preservation, and transportation. 1.3
billion tons of perishable goods (such as fruits, milk, etc.) are lost
due to the lack of an efficient cold chain. This staggering figure
represents a third of the total production and amounts to between 8 and
15 billion dollars depending on market prices.

Concentrates for animals (cereals, oilseeds) are becoming an
increasingly important factor given the growth in poultry (uniquely fed
with oilseeds) and livestock which has increased by almost 5% between
2012 and 2019.

Finally, India has become a major exporting nation of agricultural
products, with revenues from these sales jumping from 33.3 billion
dollars in 2016-17 to 50.2 billion in 2021-22. Cereals -- especially
rice, but also recently wheat -- top these exports.

What about the food availability in the future?

The scenario we present below is based on three different sources: the
Annual Report, 2022-23 of the Department of Agriculture and Farmer
Welfare, the Basic Animal Husbandry Statistics of the Ministry of
Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying, and the Handbook on Fisheries
Statistics, 2022. We have calculated the "Compounded Annual Growth Rate"
of each of the productions we were interested in between 2015 and 2020
and then extended the curves to 2050 by applying this growth rate. A
variant of these simulations was then added to present the situation
that would prevail in each case if the annual growth rate was 5% lower.

The Indian population is expected to register a 0.82% annual growth rate
between 2020 and 2050 according to the forecasts of the Census of India.
The report from the Census of India titled Population Projections for
India and the States, 2011-2036 covers only part of the period we are
interested in, so for the years 2036-2050, we have applied the same
rates of deceleration in population growth as those observed for the
period 2011-2050. This leads us to estimate India's population at
1,723,380,000 people by mid-century.

On the basis of these data, per capita productions of cereals, pulses,
foodgrains (a category combining cereals and pulses), vegetables, milk,
meat, and eggs are likely to increase, respectively, by 2.65%, 4.9%,
2.84%, 4.65%, 4.58%, 11.57% and 5.82% as an average annually. In the
scenario where the annual growth rate of these productions was 5% lower
than the projections on which these figures are based, the per capita
productions would increase over the period by respectively 2.52%, 4.66%,
2.69%, 4.42%, 4.36%, 10.99% and 5.53%. Apart from meat -- whose dynamism
reflects the phenomena noted above --, none of these food productions is
therefore expected to experience growth that would significantly combat
undernutrition.

This scenario does not take into account the possibility of a drop in
production linked to a rapid deterioration of weather conditions due to
an acceleration of climate change. Yet the most recent events, from
prolonged drought episodes to excessive rainfall leading to catastrophic
floods, make this hypothesis credible.

Due to these extreme conditions, in 2022, wheat production fell 107
million tonnes against 113 million tonnes the previous year. It rose to
112 million tonnes in 2023, but is bound to drop to 105 million tonnes
in 2024. In 2023 and 2024, the decline in rice production has been even
more significant. According to the Indian government, it should still
drop by 8.8% below the level of the previous year in 2024. This is due
to the drought that affected a large part of the territory (monsoon
rains being very late or insufficient) and the floods that subsequently
devastated the crops. Expecting a poor harvest, the Indian government
suspended exports of rice other than Basmati in July 2023. India, whose
rice exports account for 40% of global rice exports -- a performance
unmatched by any country -- had exported nearly 18 million tonnes of
non-Basmati rice in 2022, with Basmati rice accounting for only 4
million tonnes. In 2023, the government of India, by suspending exports
of non Basmati rice, has been able to sale 17.5 million tonnes of rice
on the domestic market in order to contain price rise.

The possible grim scenario of declining rice and cereal production
deserves to be taken seriously, even if it is too early to assign it a
probability coefficient for several reasons, all related to
environmental conditions.

The Sixth Assessment Report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change predicts that not only the yields from cereal crops like rice and
wheat will decline significantly because of climate change, but also
that the risk of simultaneous crop failures will increase. Using some of
the most reliable studies, the report said that "by 2050, the number of
people at risk of hunger will increase by 20% and 11% under high- and
low-emission scenarios, respectively", Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia
"being projected to be at the greatest risk, with triple the amount of
South Asia's current food reserves needed to offset such an extreme
event".

The heatwaves -- which have so penalised Indian agriculture in 2022,
2023 and 2024 -- risk becoming the norm. The incidence of heatwaves in
India has increased by a quarter compared to the previous decade.
Climate change has made heatwaves 30 times more likely than it would
have been otherwise in India, according to World Weather Attribution.
This is due both to the increase in India's average annual temperature
--- by about 0.7°C between 1900 and 2018 --- and to the fact that it has
made heatwaves larger and more frequent.

If 147 million hectares are already suffering significant degradation
due to different forms of erosion and salinisation, climate change is
expected to amplify this process, to the point that by 2050 half of the
arable land should suffer from it, which will inevitably result in a
decrease in productivity. Two experts in the field do not hesitate to
conclude that "Growing trend in the salt-affected soils in India is
becoming a threat to national food security and economic development".
In 2012-14, an estimate, now ten years old, assessed the loss of
agricultural production due to salinisation alone at 16.84 million tons.

Water resources are being depleted. The drop in groundwater levels is
mainly due to the growing consumption of an ever-increasing population
and, in some areas, to the introduction of water-intensive crops such as
rice, sugarcane, cotton, or maize since the Green Revolution. However,
the evolution of rainfall and monsoon patterns also explains why the
largest part of the water supply for agriculture and the population's
drinking water comes from groundwater. Approximately 89% of groundwater
used in India is for irrigation, and it is this type of use that has led
to a 61% reduction in groundwater levels in India between 2007 and 2017,
according to a report by the Central Ground Water Board (CGWB),
presented to the Lok Sabha in 2018. In Punjab, Gujarat, Haryana, and
Rajasthan, one must dig more than 40 meters on average to find water --
and to irrigate fields --, something that only large operators ready to
invest in tubewells can afford.

If the stagnation, or even the decline, in the production of staple
crops were to be confirmed, the implications would be considerable in
terms of undernutrition, but not only. One of the major consequences of
such a development would concern the rise of farmers' indebtedness which
has already reached a very high level.

Another consequence would concern India's trade balance. Today, the
country earns precious foreign currency from its agricultural exports.
In 2022, it sold \$9.66 billion worth of rice. In the future, if
production does not increase fast enough to feed the population, India
will likely have to not only reduce its exports but also start importing
essential commodities again, which will further impact its foreign
trade. The country has already been importing large quantities of pulses
and edible oil for decades.

Furthermore, the decrease in Indian exports contributes to reducing the
supply of foodstuffs on the global market and, consequently, to
increasing prices, which for rice, have jumped by 15 to 25% depending on
the country following the announcement of the suspension of its exports
by India. African countries are the first collateral victims of this new
situation, with India exporting rice to Benin, Angola, Cameroon, Guinea,
Ivory Coast, and Kenya.

The banning of rice and wheat exports has been criticised by observers
of trade relations who accused the Modi government to destabilise the
global trade of cereals for domestic, political reasons: "India's export
bans can also be seen as irresponsible if driven not primarily by
domestic food security, but rather by political reasons. Ahead of the
March \[sic\] 2024 elections, there is a need to appease India's urban
middle class by reducing mounting food prices", wrote J. Ma Luis
Montesclaros.

The scenarios mentioned above all focus on the issue of food production
to examine to what extent India will be able to feed its growing
population. The question is not trivial. According to the most serious
estimates, India will indeed need to produce 311 million tons of
foodgrains by 2030 and 350 million by 2050 to meet the needs of its
population. To achieve this, the country must either increase
productivity or expand cultivated areas -- or, better yet, do both at
the same time.

If the pessimistic scenario of significant impacts from the El Niño
cycle does not occur, and if the recent decline in production is not due
to climate change, then India's food security is expected to be stable
in the medium term, based on the scenario we have developed.Still, this
scenario shows that malnutrition is expected to remain a chronic ailment
in 21st-century India, simply because, as mentioned above, the country
would need to multiply its annual average reduction rate (AARR) by two
or three to significantly address this phenomenon, whereas today and in
our scenario, it stands between 2 and 3%.

#### India-Russia arctic partnership will solve food security

[**India**, in particular, has emerged as a **key partner** in
**Russia\'s Arctic strategy**]{.underline}. As the world\'s
third-largest consumer of hydrocarbons, India\'s demand is expected to
grow until 2050, making it an attractive market for Russian Arctic
resources. The [relationship between **Russia** and **India** in the
Arctic is not limited to **energy cooperation**]{.underline}. India
[faces significant challenges in **food security** and **water** supply
due to **climate change**]{.underline}, which has [led to discussions
about using **Russian Arctic lands** for **agriculture**]{.underline}.
Talks have been [ongoing since 2019 about implementing special
**migration regimes** to send **Indian laborers** to **the Russian Far
East** and Arctic for **food production**, making use of potentially
**arable Arctic lands**]{.underline}.

This [shift has not only economic but also symbolic
implications]{.underline}, as Russia seeks to broaden its Arctic
partnerships and leverage its relationships with India and China to
extract concessions from Western Arctic states. For example, Russia has
been less receptive than expected to efforts by Norway, which currently
holds the rotating Arctic Council presidency, to cautiously resume some
cooperation among the Arctic states. In contrast, Russia has been
uncharacteristically enthusiastic about the participation of non-Arctic
states, especially India, in regional affairs.

"Furthermore, the [**agricultural potential** of the Russian Arctic may
offer a **unique opportunity** for India]{.underline}."

With [climate change threatening traditional agricultural areas in
India]{.underline}, the [prospect of cultivating crops in newly arable
lands in the Arctic is reportedly being considered]{.underline}. This
collaboration could [help to address **India\'s food security
challenges** by providing an **alternative source** of **agricultural
produce**]{.underline}. The discussions around special migration regimes
during President Modi's 2019 visit to Vladivostok highlight the
potential depth of this cooperation, envisioning a future where Indian
laborers could work in the Russian Arctic to develop agricultural
projects.

Playing with ice and fire

[With its vast Arctic coastline]{.underline}, extensive experience in
Arctic navigation, and training of personnel, [Russia is an obvious
partner for **India** to explore the **NSR**]{.underline}. The decision
to establish a working group on the NSR under the bilateral
intergovernmental commission on trade, economic, scientific, technical,
and cultural cooperation was made during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's
summit meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow in July
last year. Also, the Chennai-Vladivostok Maritime Corridor emerges as a
potential bridge to the NSR ports such as Pevek, Tiksi, and Sabetta.

However, if India inclines towards the Russian bloc, then it would be
implying support to Chinese efforts, such as the Polar Silk Road which
China is building as a northern extension of its Belt and Road
Initiative. Not only would the NSR help China bypass the Malacca Strait
chokepoint completely, but it would also give it much more control over
the Arctic route.

[If **India** supports the **Western bloc** and partners with the
**U.S**., it could lose its perceived potential **stake** in the
**massive resources** that currently fall under **Russian control** in
the area]{.underline}. The ideal but [obviously
**challenging**]{.underline} solution would be [to]{.underline} find a
way to [work with both the **U.S.** and **Russia**]{.underline}. Other
partners should include Japan and South Korea. Both countries share
India's concerns about the growing cooperation between China and Russia
in the Arctic and about their businesses losing out on Arctic
opportunities to Chinese competitors. The trio should advocate the
rectification of disparities within the Arctic Council and promote a
more inclusive and equitable Council.

## Russia-China Alliance Disadvantage

\*\* Only Bisen's quotes are included.

Anurag Bisen: The concerns go beyond the maritime domain. [India and
Russia share a long-standing and **multifaceted
relationship**]{.underline}, but [since the imposition of **Western**
sanctions in 2014]{.underline}, [Russia has found itself **increasingly
isolated**]{.underline}. [This isolation has pushed **Moscow**
**closer** to **Beijing**]{.underline} -- something China has
capitalised on.

Take the Yamal LNG project as an example. Chinese entities such as CNPC
and the Silk Road Fund hold nearly a 30% stake. Reports suggest that
around 60% of the equipment used in the project is of Chinese origin,
and Chinese labour has been heavily involved.

From the Indian perspective, [this Sino-Russian closeness is driven less
by mutual affinity and **more** by **necessity**]{.underline}. [Many in
Russia are **uncomfortable** with their **junior position** in the
relationship.]{.underline} There are also longstanding Russian concerns
about the Far East, which remains sparsely populated and vulnerable to
demographic and strategic pressures from China. Historical grievances
persist in Chinese strategic thinking regarding how the borders were
settled.

In contrast, [India presents **no such challenge** to
Russia]{.underline}. In fact, [Russia has actively **courted** Indian
engagement]{.underline}. At the 2019 Eastern Economic Forum, India was
the official partner country, and Prime Minister Modi was the chief
guest. That's when India launched its "Act Far East" policy and extended
a US\$1 billion line of credit to Russia.

[India also enjoys strong bilateral relationships with **other**
**Arctic states**]{.underline}. With Canada, for instance, people of
Indian origin make up around 8% of the population. Despite a temporary
diplomatic strain under Prime Minister Trudeau, the relationship remains
robust. India has held two Nordic summits and planned a third with
Norway, which was postponed due to a terror attack in Kashmir.

"[Strategic competition with China is a **more important** long-term
challenge for the West than the conflict with **Russia**]{.underline}.
In fact, it would not be in the West's interest to see Russia and China
close ranks in an Arctic partnership."

Strategic competition with China is a more important long-term challenge

Arctic **partnership**]{.underline} -- [with their forces combined, the
two countries would be **too** **strong** to **balance**]{.underline}.
So my argument is that [Russia is being **driven** into China's embrace,
since it is **increasingly isolated** and sees no alternative because of
**Western sanctions**]{.underline}. [The West should encourage **India**
to become Russia's **Arctic alternative** to China]{.underline}.

#### The plan pushes India away from Russia---that isolates Russia and increases China-Russia collaboration

**Wahden, 25** \[Lukas Wahden \"\'The West should encourage India to
become Russia's Arctic alternative to China\'\" ArcticToday, 6-10-2025

Personally, I see the Arctic today as the site of an intensifying
strategic triangle involving the United States, Russia, and China.
India's two most important strategic partners -- [Russia and the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates -- [are]{.underline} deeply
[engaged in the Arctic]{.underline}. We have high-level strategic
partnerships [and]{.underline} conduct 2+2 dialogues with both. At the
same time, [China]{.underline} -- our principal adversary -- [is
expanding its footprint]{.underline} in the region. In my view, this
[makes Indian engagement in the Arctic essential.]{.underline}

India should be present to understand and navigate these dynamics. It
could, I believe, position itself as a bridge -- between the West and
Russia, or between the West and the broader "Global South." Later in our
conversation, we can discuss how this bridging role might be developed
in practice. But at its core, this is how I understand the geopolitics
of the Arctic: [India needs to be engaged]{.underline}, not only for
environmental or economic reasons, but also [to]{.underline} make sense
of and [influence]{.underline} the emerging [security
architecture.]{.underline}

66° North: Since you brought up China, I'd like to follow up. How do
Indian policymakers view China's growing involvement in the Arctic --
especially from a maritime standpoint? What are the main concerns?

Anurag Bisen: The concerns go beyond the maritime domain. India and
Russia share a long-standing and multifaceted relationship, but
[since]{.underline} the imposition of [Western sanctions]{.underline} in
2014, [Russia]{.underline} has [found itself increasingly
isolated]{.underline}. This [isolation has pushed Moscow closer to
Beijing]{.underline} -- something China has capitalised on.

Take the Yamal LNG project as an example. Chinese entities such as CNPC
and the Silk Road Fund hold nearly a 30% stake. Reports suggest that
around 60% of the equipment used in the project is of Chinese origin,
and Chinese labour has been heavily involved.

From the Indian perspective, this [Sino-Russian closeness is
driven]{.underline} less by mutual affinity and more [by
necessity]{.underline}. Many in [Russia are uncomfortable
with]{.underline} their [junior position in the]{.underline}
[relationship]{.underline}. There are also longstanding Russian concerns
about the Far East, which remains sparsely populated and vulnerable to
demographic and strategic pressures from China. Historical grievances
persist in Chinese strategic thinking regarding how the borders were
settled.

In contrast, [India presents no]{.underline} such [challenge to
Russia]{.underline}. In fact, Russia has actively courted Indian
engagement. At the 2019 Eastern Economic Forum, India was the official
partner country, and Prime Minister Modi was the chief guest. That's
when India launched its "Act Far East" policy and extended a US\$1
billion line of credit to Russia.

India also enjoys strong bilateral relationships with other Arctic
states. With Canada, for instance, people of Indian origin make up
around 8% of the population. Despite a temporary diplomatic strain under
Prime Minister Trudeau, the relationship remains robust. India has held
two Nordic summits and planned a third with Norway, which was postponed
due to a terror attack in Kashmir.

S[trategic competition with China is a more important]{.underline}
long-term [challenge]{.underline} for the West [than the conflict with
Russia]{.underline}. In fact, it would not be in the West's interest to
see Russia and China close ranks in an Arctic partnership -- with their
forces combined, the two countries would be too strong to balance. So my
argument is that [Russia is being driven into China's
embrace,]{.underline} since it is increasingly isolated and sees no
alternative because of Western sanctions. [The West should encourage
India to become Russia's Arctic alternative to China.]{.underline}

But to be clear, India's Arctic engagement is not driven by what China
does. We do not compete with China, nor do we replicate its methods --
be they economic inducements, coercion, or opaque investments. India's
engagement is transparent, based on national interest, and carried out
with limited resources. China's involvement in the Arctic is far ahead
of ours, but India's policy stands on its own merits.

66° North: It is interesting you raise the possibility of India as an
Arctic "alternative" to China from a Russian point of view. I've also
observed this argument in Russian writings. You recently took part in
the International Arctic Forum in Murmansk. What's your impression -- do
[Russian stakeholders genuinely want deeper Arctic cooperation with
India]{.underline}, in part to reduce reliance on China?

Anurag Bisen: Absolutely. I can give you several examples. Over the last
ten years, nearly every India--Russia summit joint statement has
included a line welcoming India's participation in the Arctic. Despite
that, we've seen limited concrete follow-up -- likely due to a lack of
coordination on the Indian side.

**[Nonmilitary collaboration]{.underline}** between Russia and China
[could **weaken the United States** and even **threaten its way of

to]{.underline}, as the director of national intelligence put it in

#### China and Russia have fundamental disagreements over the Arctic

Partnership", *Carnegie Politika*,

February 18, 2025

Over the past three years, [Russia's cooperation with China]{.underline}
has reached unprecedented levels. Still, [there is one area where the
two countries have been unable to find common ground]{.underline}:
**[the Arctic.]{.underline}** Even in the current geopolitical climate,
[the differences between Moscow and Beijing's approaches]{.underline} to
the Arctic have so far proven [too great to overcome,]{.underline}
limiting China's advances in the Far North.

Publicly, Russia and China maintain they have a "comprehensive strategic
partnership," which ostensibly extends to Arctic issues. Yet [their
interests in the region can be quite disparate]{.underline}.

China first took a serious interest in the Far North in the early 2010s,
initially seeking a seat on the Arctic Council, the region's most
important multilateral organization. Russia did not immediately agree to
admit China, setting two conditions: that China respect the sovereignty
of regional powers and abide by freedom-of-navigation rules. In 2013,
China was finally granted observer status, and with it, a platform to
articulate its regional objectives.

In 2018, China's State Council published the country's first-ever white
paper on Arctic policy. The document described China as a "near-Arctic
state" with a vested interest in the region's affairs. It argued that
the Arctic belonged to all mankind, and so China had the right to enter
its waters and airspace, just like other "constructive" parties.

[The Arctic was easily integrated into China's global Belt and Road
Initiative]{.underline}---in the form of a proposed "Polar Silk
Road"---and its vision of a "Community of Common Destiny." Overall, it
presented Beijing with an opportunity to burnish its image as a
responsible great power.

China's stated objectives in the Arctic have not changed significantly
since 2018. It remains committed to conducting scientific research,
conserving the region, carrying out commercial activities, and assisting
with the Arctic's joint management in line with international law.

Indeed, all of China's statements and documents on the region reiterate
its willingness to engage in multilateral cooperation for the benefit of
the Arctic. Meanwhile, the military-political dimension always goes
unmentioned, with neither the 2018 white paper nor any subsequent
pronouncements hinting at the expansionist designs about which then U.S.
secretary of state Mike Pompeo warned in 2019.

[Russia's Arctic policy is based on altogether different
principles]{.underline}. For Moscow, [it is all about unlocking the
region's economic potential and defending sovereignty]{.underline}.
Essentially, [Russia]{.underline} [wishes to commercialize the
region]{.underline}---with an emphasis on oil and gas exploration and
the creation of a transportation corridor---[and militarize it,
too.]{.underline}

Furthermore, [Russia would do this unilaterally,]{.underline} all
references to dialogue and cooperation with regional partners having
been removed from the country's main documents on the Arctic amid the
breakdown in its relations with the West.

[Unlike Beijing, Moscow has put great stock in national projects with
limited foreign participation]{.underline}. Tellingly, the Northern Sea
Route is treated by the Kremlin as a domestic transport route. While
[China welcomes the internationalization of the Arctic's transportation
corridors, Russia has resisted this trend in favor of
autarky]{.underline}.

[This]{.underline} fundamental [disagreement has long hampered Russia's
cooperation with China on Arctic]{.underline} issues in every area
except oil and gas. In the 2010s, the two countries actively
collaborated on oil and gas projects in the Arctic, many of which the
Chinese financed, much to Russia's gratitude, particularly after the
West imposed the first sanctions against it in 2014.

[Russia and China play up their scientific and cultural cooperation on
Arctic issues, but their practical use **has been
doubtful.**]{.underline} While academic contacts are often cited as a
success story for Russia and China, they grew less frequent after
February 2022. Chinese students still attend academic conferences in
Russia, and [joint expeditions to the Arctic continue, but
these]{.underline} initiatives [do **little** to meaningfully deepen
Sino-Russian cooperation]{.underline} on regional issues.

The fact is that expectations that [China might expand its presence in
the Arctic through partnership with Russia have not been
fulfilled.]{.underline} For Beijing, the priority remains having the
freedom to work with all the Arctic's interested parties. As such, while
China continued to fulfill Russia's technology orders for energy
projects in the Arctic and import energy from the region, it has
refrained from investing further in Russia's Arctic initiatives out of
fear of sanctions.

China genuinely values its relationships with the Arctic's other powers,
and does not want to risk alienating them by getting overly close to
Russia. Since becoming an Arctic Council observer, [Beijing has looked
for opportunities to work not only with Moscow but also with others in
the region]{.underline}, including Iceland and Norway. Admittedly, its
proposals are given less and less consideration nowadays, with national
security concerns usually cited as the reason.

Despite these setbacks, [China remains set on the internationalization
of Arctic projects and committed to multilateralism in the region. With
war raging, Russia is less likely than ever to help China in this
endeavor.]{.underline}

Claiming neutrality while simultaneously developing relations with
Russia[, China has taken a wait-and-see position toward its strategic
partner, with respect to the Arctic]{.underline} as well as in general.
And as [Beijing waits for the resolution of Russia's conflict with the
West, it continues to take what it can from Moscow, starting with its
know-how---by now a familiar dynamic in their relationship.]{.underline}

[China's]{.underline} growing [presence in the Arctic,]{.underline}

line\[57\] but also prevents an isolated Russia from becoming overly

for India to strengthen its Arctic presence.]{.underline}\[58\]

Navigating Geopolitical Dynamics

The [Arctic's evolving landscape is]{.underline} increasingly [becoming
a theatre for global power play. China's]{.underline} growing [influence
in the Arctic]{.underline}, particularly through the NSR, [is raising
strategic concerns]{.underline} among global security watchers. As
[China identifies itself as a "near-Arctic state"]{.underline} and
pushes its Polar Silk Road initiative, [India must respond with
strategic precision]{.underline}. While [India's Arctic
Policy]{.underline} emphasises sustainability, responsibility, and
adherence to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, it
[must]{.underline} also [prioritise its own strategic
interests.]{.underline}

[India's]{.underline} participation in the Arctic and its [collaboration
with Russia on the NSR **reinforces** its]{.underline} principle of
**[strategic autonomy]{.underline}**. By [diversifying partnerships,
India can maintain its independence]{.underline} while
[navigating]{.underline} [a multipolar global order.]{.underline}
Moreover, [this engagement offers India an opportunity to
**counterbalance**]{.underline} [China's growing presence in the Arctic
and protect its energy supply lines.]{.underline}

India's 2022 Arctic Policy reflects an understanding of the region's
significance, describing it as an "arena for power and competition".
Howeve[r, to establish itself as a credible player]{.underline} in the
Arctic, [India must move **beyond** policy declarations and take
concrete steps to address the region's geopolitical
challenges]{.underline}. Its previous efforts in the Western Pacific
have yielded limited results, and the Arctic offers a fresh opportunity
to assert its influence. A seventh pillar focused on geopolitics and
strategy is, therefore, essential to secure India's interests in this
rapidly transforming region.

Notably, [alongside India, China has shown increased interest in
becoming a key partner to Russia]{.underline} in developing the NSR.
[However, China's expansionist attitude and its enduring interest in
Russia's Far East have]{.underline} consistently [**hindered** the
bilateral relationship of the two countries]{.underline}. In this
context[, India appears as a **counterbalance** to China]{.underline},
[enhancing its strategic importance to Russia and strengthening its role

remember, in the early 1970s, Kissinger brilliantly managed to exploit
the split between Moscow and Beijing to United States' advantage. Today,
the Beijing-Moscow alignment---not an axis, not an alliance---is far
deeper. And when Trump came to power, he had, I think, a sensible idea,
which was, I think, given to him by Kissinger to try to peel Russia away
from this alignment with China, and to align Russia more closely with
the United States. Of course, he was blocked in this because of
Russiagate and various scandals, US domestic politics. And so, the exact
opposite has happened, that this Belt and Road forum just recently
demonstrated just how close Russia and China have become.

Where Nuclear War Is Most Likely To Begin",
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/why-the-baltic-states-are-where-nuclear-war-most-likely-17044)

While nuclear weapons could potentially be used in any number of future
warfighting scenarios, [there are]{.underline} multiple [reasons to
suspect]{.underline} that [the]{.underline} [**greatest
[danger]{.mark}** [exists with]{.mark} regard to the three
[Baltic]{.mark} state[s]{.mark}]{.underline}. Here are eight of those
reasons.

First, both [Washington and [Moscow assign high]{.mark} **strategic
[significance]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[**future disposition** of [the]{.mark} Baltic
[states]{.mark}]{.underline}. [From Moscow\'s perspective]{.underline},
[the three]{.underline} states [are]{.underline} located [close to the
centers of Russian political and military power]{.underline}, and
therefore [are a]{.underline} potential [base for **devastating**
attacks]{.underline}. For instance, the distance between Lithuania\'s
capital of Vilnius and Moscow is less than 500 miles \-- a short trip
for a supersonic aircraft. [From Washington\'s perspective]{.underline},
[failure to protect the Baltic states]{.underline} from Russian
aggression [could lead to the unraveling of America\'s]{.underline} most
important [alliance]{.underline}.

Second, [Washington has been]{.underline} very [public about it
commitment to the Baltic states]{.underline}. For instance, in 2014
President Obama stated during a visit to Estonia that defense of the
three countries\' capitals was \"just as important as the defense of
Berlin and Paris and London.\" That is an extraordinary assertion
considering that the population of metropolitan London (about 8 million)
is greater than that of all three Baltic states combined (about 6
million), and that the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea is so close to
the Russian heartland.

Third, [there is a **disconnect** between the **rhetoric**]{.underline}
that Washington applies to Baltic security [and the **tactical
situation**]{.underline} [that would likely obtain in a future
war]{.underline}. [[Russia has]{.mark} **massive**]{.underline} local
**[[superiority]{.underline}]{.mark}** in every form of military force,
and the topography of the three states presents few obstacles to being
quickly overrun. The RAND Corporation reported earlier this year that in
a series of war games, Russian forces were always able to overcome
indigenous defenders and reach Baltic capitals within a few days. [The
forces of other [NATO]{.mark} nations [had]{.mark} **[little
time]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} **[respond]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Fourth, for all of its talk about reinforcing NATO at the recent
alliance summit (\"we will defend every ally\" President Obama said),
there is scant evidence the U.S. is willing to make the kind of
commitment of conventional forces needed to blunt a Russian invasion in
the Baltic region. The proposed placement of NATO-led battalions in each
state totaling about 1,000 soldiers each is widely described as a
\"tripwire\" defense, meaning it might trigger a bigger alliance
response but would not be able to prevent Moscow from reaching its
military objectives quickly.

Fifth, [any [counter-attack]{.mark}]{.underline} by NATO in the Baltics
[could easily be **misc[onstrued]{.mark}**]{.underline} by Moscow [[as a
**threat** to]{.mark} its **core [interests]{.mark}**]{.underline}, in
part [because]{.underline} some [strikes against attacking forces would
occur on Russian territory]{.underline}, and in part because Russia\'s
fragile reconnaissance system would quickly be overwhelmed by the fog of
war. Anthony Barrett of the RAND Corporation has recently produced a
worrisome analysis detailing how an East-West conventional conflict
along the Russian periphery could escalate to nuclear-weapons use
through miscues or misjudgments.

Sixth, [[both sides]{.mark} in any such conflict would [have **military
doctrine**]{.mark}]{.underline} potentially [[justify]{.mark}ing the
**use** of **[nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}**]{.underline} [to
prevent defeat]{.underline}. In the case of [Russia]{.underline}, it
[has stated repeatedly that it needs non-strategic nuclear weapons to
cope with]{.underline} the [superiority of NATO conventional
forces]{.underline}, that it would use such weapons in order to protect
its core assets and values, and even that nuclear weapons might
sometimes be useful tools for de-escalating a conflict. Successive U.S.
administrations have stressed that nuclear weapons underpin alliance
commitments.

Seventh, [both sides have non-strategic nuclear weapons **in theater**
[ready for **quick use**]{.mark} if tactical circumstances
dictate]{.underline}. For example, Hans Kristensen noted the presence of
several nuclear-capable military systems in the Russian enclave of
Kaliningrad located between Lithuania and Poland. Although the Russians
have not disclosed whether nuclear warheads are also located in the
district, there is little doubt that hundreds could quickly be deployed
to areas around the Baltic states in an escalating conflict.
Nuclear-capable NATO jets could reach the area within hours.

Eighth, [**new [tech]{.mark}nologies** are]{.underline} gradually [being
incorporated into forces on both sides that could
**[accelerate]{.mark}** the **[pace]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}
**[confusion]{.mark}** [of a]{.mark} **[local
conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For instance, the F-35 fighter that
will replace F-16s in the tactical nuclear role cannot be tracked by
Russian radar. The [integrated air defenses]{.underline} that Russia has
deployed in Kaliningrad and elsewhere on its territory [could severely
impede NATO use of local air space]{.underline} in support of ground
forces, [and Russian electronic-warfare]{.underline} capabilities [could
impede coordination of ground maneuvers]{.underline}.

The bottom line is that all the ingredients are present in the eastern
Baltic area for an East-West conflict escalating to nuclear weapons use.
[Neither side understands what actions might provoke nuclear use by the
other]{.underline}, [and once war began both sides would likely have a
**tenuous grasp** of what was happening]{.underline}. The [[high
stakes]{.mark} assigned to the outcome]{.underline} of such a conflict
and the ready availability of \"non-strategic\" nuclear weapons in a
context where either side might view their use as strategic in
consequences [[is a]{.mark} **[prescription]{.mark}** [for]{.mark}
**[catastrophe]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

As China's power has grown in recent years, so, too, has the risk of war
with the United States. Under President Xi Jinping, [[China]{.mark} has
**increased** its]{.underline} political and economic [pressure on
Taiwan and [built **military installations**]{.mark} on coral reefs [in

**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**ea, fueling Washington's fears that [Chinese
expansionism will **threaten U.S. allies** and **influence** in the
region]{.underline}. U.S. destroyers have transited the Taiwan Strait,
to loud protests from Beijing. American policymakers have wondered aloud
whether they should send an aircraft carrier through the strait as well.
[[Chinese]{.mark} fighter [jets have **intercepted U.S.
aircraft**]{.mark} in the skies above the S]{.underline}outh
[C]{.underline}hina [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}ea. Meanwhile, U.S.
President Donald Trump has brought long-simmering economic disputes to a
rolling boil.

A war between the two countries remains unlikely, but the prospect of [a
**military confrontation**---resulting, for example, from a Chinese
campaign against Taiwan---**no longer seems** as
**implausible**]{.underline} as it once did. And [the odds of such a
[confrontation **go**]{.mark}**ing [nuclear]{.mark}** []{.mark}are
**higher** than most policymakers and analysts **think**.]{.underline}

Members of China's strategic com­munity tend to dismiss such concerns.
Likewise, U.S. studies of a potential war with China often exclude
nuclear weapons from the analysis entirely, treating them as basically
irrelevant to the course of a conflict. Asked about the issue in 2015,
Dennis Blair, the former commander of U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific,
estimated the likelihood of a U.S.-Chinese nuclear crisis as "somewhere
between nil and zero."

[This assurance is **misguided**]{.underline}. If deployed against
China, [the Pentagon's preferred style of]{.underline} conventional
[warfare would be a]{.underline} potential **[recipe for nuclear
escalation]{.underline}**. Since the end of the Cold War, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates' [signature approach to war has
been simple: punch deep into enemy territory in order to rapidly knock
out the opponent's key military assets]{.underline} at minimal cost. But
the Pentagon developed this formula in wars against Afghanistan, Iraq,
Libya, and Serbia, none of which was a nuclear power.

[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}, by contrast, not only [[has
nuc]{.mark}lear weapon[s]{.mark}]{.underline}; it has also
**[[intermingled]{.underline}]{.mark}** them [[with]{.underline}]{.mark}
its **[[conventional]{.underline}]{.mark}** military
[**[forces]{.mark}**, [making it difficult to **attack one**
without]{.mark} **attacking [the other]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This
means that [a **major**]{.underline} U.S. military
**[campaign]{.underline}** [targeting China's conventional forces would
likely also **threaten its nuclear arsenal**]{.underline}. Faced with
such a threat, [[Chinese leaders could]{.mark} decide to **[use]{.mark}

## India Elections Disadvantage 

### 1NC---India Elections Disadvantage

[In an interview to Financial Times, Gandhi claimed there was "[great
discontent]{.mark}" [in the ruling side following]{.mark} the Lok Sabha
[elections]{.mark}, in which the Bharatiya Janata Party [(BJP) failed to
secure a majority]{.mark}, as the Congress and other Opposition parties
registered an upswing in numbers.]{.underline}

Gandhi said that the poll [[results brought about a "tectonic shift" in
Indian politics, leaving **the BJP "fatally
wounded**]{.underline}]{.mark}". "**[The space in the Indian political
system has been blown open]{.underline}**," he told the newspaper
headquartered in London.

In the elections, the BJP's tally came down to 240 from 303 in 2019, far
short of the 272 seat-mark required by a party to form a government on
its own[. Consequently, [the BJP is]{.mark} now [dependent on
allies,]{.mark} such as the **Telugu Desam Party and the Janata Dal**
(United) [to run]{.mark} the [governmen]{.mark}t with 293
seats.]{.underline}

At the same time, the Congress registered a jump in its tally from 52
seats in 2019 to 99. Three MPs, who won as independent candidates, have
also extended their support to the party in the past few days. In total,
the Opposition's INDIA bloc has 237 MPs on its side.

"[[The numbers are such that they are very fragile, and **the smallest
disturbance can drop the government**,"]{.underline}]{.mark} Gandhi told
FT. "Basically [[one ally has to turn the other
way]{.underline}]{.mark}," he added. After the results, the INDIA bloc
had decided to keep a close watch on the ruling side, instead of making
any immediate efforts to cobble up numbers to form a government.

The MP said that a lot of ideas that succeeded in the election, helping
the Opposition emerge as a formidable force, came from the two Bharat
Jodo Yatras that he had undertaken in 2022-23 and 2024.

While the first one saw Gandhi marching on foot from Kanyakumari to
Srinagar, covering over 4,000 km, during the second one, he travelled on
a bus from Manipur to Maharashtra, traversing more than 6,000 km.

"The judicial system, the media, the institutional framework --- all
were shut (for the Opposition), and so we decided we have to literally,
physically go do it... A lot of the ideas that succeeded in this
election came from that walk, and they came not from us, but from the
people of India," he said.

In the interview, Gandhi, who has decided to retain the Rae Bareli Lok
Sabha seat, vacating Wayanad --- the other seat he won from --- for his
sister Priyanka Gandhi Vadra to contest from in a bypoll, made it a
point to refer to the BJP's loss in Uttar Pradesh's Faizabad, under
which Ayodhya falls.

["The idea of Mr Modi and the image of Mr [Modi has been
destroyed]{.mark}. The party that spent the last 10 years talking about
Ayodhya has been wiped out in Ayodhya... Essentially what has happened
is that the basic architecture of [BJP,]{.mark} the idea of creating
religious hatred, [has collapsed]{.mark}," he said.]{.underline}

Wanted to Be\", 05/24/2023, TIME,
https://time.com/6288459/india-ally-us-modi-biden-visit/\] // Micah

With Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi slated for a June 22 State
Visit to Washington, India will, if briefly, be front-page news in the
United States. Since President Clinton ended a chill in U.S.-India
relations almost 25 years ago, successive American and Indian
administrations across political parties have worked to strengthen ties.
So it's fair to ask: how robust is this relationship today? As with the
blind men and the elephant, the answer varies. Is India a bad bet, or is
it, as the White House senior Asia policy official said recently, "the
most important bilateral relationship with the United States on the
global stage"?

Despite careful nurturing by Washington over the years, many aspects of
U.S. ties with India remain challenging. Bilateral trade has grown
tenfold since 2000, to \$191 billion in 2022, and India became the
ninth-largest US trading partner in 2021. But longstanding economic
gripes persist, meriting 13 pages in the 2023 Foreign Trade Barriers
report from the U.S. Trade Representative. Multilaterally, India's role
in the fast-consolidating "Quad" consultation (comprised of the United
States, Australia, India, and Japan) has brought shared purpose to
Washington and New Delhi, both of which harbor concerns about China.
[But [New Delhi also champions alternative non-Western groupings like
the BRICS, and it remains outside bodies central to U.S.
diplomacy]{.mark}]{.underline} like the U.N. Security Council and the
G7.

Today, U.S.-India cooperation spans defense, global health, sustainable
development, climate, and technology, among other things. But deep
differences remain, including concerns in Washington about India's
democratic backsliding under Modi, and India's failure to condemn the
Russian invasion of Ukraine. In other words, the U.S.-India relationship
has been transformed over the past quarter-century, but that
transformation has not delivered a partnership or alignment similar to
the closest U.S. alliances.

[This shouldn't surprise anyone. [India is not a U.S. ally, and has not
wanted to become one]{.mark}. To see relations with rising power India
as on a pathway that culminates in a relationship like that the United
States enjoys with Japan or the United Kingdom creates expectations that
will not be met. [Indian leaders across parties and over decades have
long prioritized foreign policy independence as a central feature of
India's approach to the world. That remains the case even with Modi's
openness to the United States.]{.mark}]{.underline}

For India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, protecting his
country's hard-fought independence was a guiding principle for foreign
policy. Speaking in the Indian Parliament in March 1951, Nehru noted
that "By aligning ourselves with any one Power, you surrender your
opinion, give up the policy you would normally pursue because somebody
else wants you to pursue another policy." Twelve years later, evaluating
his country's [[nonalignment policy]{.mark} in the pages of Foreign
Affairs, Nehru went on to observe that it had not "fared badly," and
that "[essentially, 'non-alignment' is freedom of action which is a part
of independence."]{.mark}]{.underline}

[For famously allied Washington, nonalignment in the 20th century was a
bridge too far; in 1956 then-Secretary of State John Foster Dulles
proclaimed that neutrality was "an obsolete conception...immoral and
shortsighted." [It did not help]{.mark} matters [that the United States
had entered an alliance with India's arch-rival
Pakistan]{.mark}]{.underline} in 1954, and sided with the Pakistani
military in the bloody civil war that gave birth to Bangladesh in 1971.
Nor, too, when Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi signed a "Treaty of
Peace, Friendship, and Cooperation" with the USSR in 1971, definitively
tilting India toward the Soviet Union even as the United States had
tilted toward Pakistan.

Especially since the end of the Cold War, Indian leaders have sought to
improve ties with Washington, but not by curtailing India's independent
approach to foreign policy. Former Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee
proclaimed India and the United States "natural allies" in a landmark
1998 speech in New York. Yet this was perhaps more a term of art than a
call for an alliance as it occurred against the backdrop of India's
nuclear tests, underscoring New Delhi's willingness to upset global
nuclear nonproliferation conventions, which it never joined. Indian
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, whose 10 years at the helm greatly
improved Indo-U.S. relations, pursued a civil-nuclear agreement with
Washington and ushered in new cooperation in high technology, defense,
and clean energy. But his government too defended its principle of
"**[[strategic autonomy]{.underline}]{.mark}**" **[[as a redline for its
foreign policy]{.underline}]{.mark}** even as it moved closer to
Washington than ever in the past. Defending the civil-nuclear deal with
Washington before Parliament in 2008, Singh twice asserted that "Our
strategic autonomy will never be compromised."

In important ways, Prime Minister Modi represents a break with India's
past, most notably in his emphasis on India's Hindu, rather than
syncretic and secular, cultural heritage. But his approach to the United
States remains consistent with the history of his country's foreign
policy independence.

Modi has deepened ties with the United States, now across three U.S.
presidents, through increased partnership in defense, in advanced
technology, and in energy, just to name a few, as well as through
moments of high symbolism, like his 2015 Republic Day invitation to
former President Barack Obama, the first time an American president
joined this day honoring India's constitution. Even so, Modi has leaned
into the United States while leaning into many other partners around the
world. The Modi government invokes a Sanskrit saying, the "world is one
family" (vasudhaiva kutumbakam), to frame Indian diplomacy. This
approach has been termed "multialignment," a theory of seeking positive
ties as far and as widely as possible, without seeing contradictions in
this approach.

In practice, [[New Delhi has carefully managed]{.mark} its
[relationships with]{.mark} Saudi Arabia as well as Iran; with Israel as
well as the Palestinian Territories; with [the United States as well as
Russia.]{.mark} India's G20 presidency this year encapsulates this
orientation, with its Sanskritic theme of "One Earth, One Family, One
Future," and its twin efforts to lead the forum for the world's 20
largest economies while self-consciously presenting itself as the "Voice
of the Global South."]{.underline}

[With this history in mind, it's easier to perceive that momentum in the
U.S.-India relationship does not necessarily imply a path to a formal
alliance or mutual defense treaty[. In the United States, the mental
model for positive international cooperation defaults to seeing "ally"
as the ultimate endpoint. **For India, that suggests a curtailment of
independence**]{.mark}]{.underline}. And with India, even as cooperation
becomes more extensive than ever in the past, consequential differences
remain.

For many in Washington, the dramatic growth of coordination and joint
activities under the Quad consultative group fills a growing need in
light of China's rise, encompassing subjects as far-flung as maritime
security, infrastructure, climate and resilience, vaccines, technology
standards, and higher education---all underlining Indian strategic
convergence with the United States in the Indo-Pacific. Yet strategic
convergence there does not mean everywhere: Russia's invasion of Ukraine
and its year-long war has elicited a tepid tut-tut from New Delhi, while
India has escalated its purchases of cheap Russian oil at a time
Washington seeks to isolate Moscow.

On closer examination this foreign policy independence and desire to
define its own path so prized by India may offer lessons for U.S.
foreign policy. The unipolar moment has passed; in its place we have
more actors with their own perspectives, and a rising China with global
ambitions and its own priorities increasingly shaping the priorities of
others. The array of special relationships and alliances nurtured by the
United States over decades are still in place, but many of these are now
inflected by divergences with Washington. Take Turkey, or France, or
Egypt, Pakistan, or Brazil. These U.S. allies do not always see their
alliance relationship with Washington as barriers to taking decisions
that contradict U.S. preferences. Indeed, President Emmanuel Macron too
invokes "strategic autonomy."

It's here that India's ambivalence offers a lens onto the world
Washington is likely to encounter on a growing scale. In this world of
more diffused power---a world with more diverse actors taking more
distinctive foreign policy steps---partnerships and even alliances
marked by substantial disagreements might be the new normal. In fact,
managing ambivalence may be the central skill for American foreign
policy in the years ahead.

[Since the early 2020s[, India's Arctic strategy]{.mark} has evolved
from being primarily scientific to being [informed by broader
geopolitics]{.mark}. India has maintained a presence in the region since
2008, when]{.underline} it set up the Himadri research station in
Svalbard; in 2022, it formalised its ambitions by releasing an Arctic
Policy.23) [[Recent shifts in the global security
landscape]{.underline}]{.mark}, marked by deteriorating relations
between Russia and the West and China's expanding Arctic cooperation
with Russia, [[have prompted India to pay closer attention to security
and strategic dynamics in the region.]{.underline}]{.mark}24) However,
as an emerging Arctic actor, [[India faces multiple uncertainties in
navigating the region's complex security and geopolitical challenges,
requiring policymakers in New Delhi to develop a multifaceted strategy
that addresses diverse issues, political dynamics, and geographic
considerations.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Since 2021, India has been supporting infrastructural development along
the NSR25) to capitalise on the commercial benefits of the route and
diversify its supply routes with Arctic resources, including gas and
critical minerals, to fuel its rapidly growing economy.26) [I[ndia's
engagement in the Arctic is also driven by its strategic goal of
securing Russia's commitment to]{.mark} an expanded International
North-South Transport Corridor [(INSTC]{.mark}]{.underline}[),]{.mark}
which could deliver Arctic resources to India once/if it is
operationalised.27) By connecting India to both Russia and the
Nordic-Baltic region, [[INSTC could accelerate trade
ties]{.mark}]{.underline} between these regions and India by. Amongst
other things, connecting New Delhi with the iron ore line between Luleå,
Kiruna, and Narvik as well as the European Union (EU)-funded Bothnian
Corridor.28) [[From a strategic vantage point, more importantly, the
INSTC presents an alternative to China's Belt and Road Initiative
(B]{.underline}]{.mark}RI), and hence its operationalisation could
enable India to better challenge China's growing strategic influence.29)

India's Arctic ambitions are also influenced by concerns over China's
growing presence in the region; the government in New Delhi is
apprehensive that China's growing presence could divert the US's focus
away from the Indo-Pacific.30) New Arctic sea routes could also provide
Beijing with an alternative to the Malacca Strait, easing what is
commonly known as the "Malacca dilemma".31) This could create a
strategic challenge for India given that its primary strategy in a
potential conflict with China hinges on disrupting Chinese shipping in
the Indian Ocean, and an alternative route for China would paralyse this
strategy.32)

diplomacy received three setbacks from the United States. He urged Prime
Minister Narendra Modi to call an all-party meeting to discuss the
issue.]{.underline}]{.mark}

\"Yesterday, Indian diplomacy received three huge setbacks at the hands
of the United States. [[It raises severe, serious questions on the US
policy\", Ramesh said.]{.underline}]{.mark}

He first slammed [[US central command chief]{.underline}]{.mark} General
Michael Kurilla, [[calling Pakistan a **\"phenomenal
partner**]{.underline}]{.mark}\" [in the fight against
terrorism]{.underline}. \"Pakistan is where Osama bin Laden was found
hiding for 10 years. He was killed on the 2nd of May 2011 in Abbottabad.
\'Pakistan is a phenomenal counterterrorism partner \' is a bizarre
statement from the top American general,\" Ramesh told news agency ANI.

[[Asif Munir getting an invitation to the US army
day]{.underline}]{.mark} on June 14th, is another setback for India,
Ramesh said. \"This is the same Aasim [[Munir]{.underline}]{.mark} who,
a few days before the April 22 brutal terrorist attack at Pahalgam, used
the most incendiary and provocative language, going back to the 1940s,
talking of the two-nation theory. I think that gave oxygen and led to
the terror attacks,\" he said.

On 17 April, Munir [[told]{.underline}]{.mark} [[a
gathering]{.mark}]{.underline} of expatriates in Islamabad that
[[Pakistanis were different from Hindus]{.underline}]{.mark}.

He [[reaffirmed Pakistan's stance on Kashmir, describing it as the
country's \"jugular vein.\"]{.underline}]{.mark}

The third setback, Ramesh said, was the US state department spokesperson
reiterating that US president Trump brought about engagement between
India and Pakistan. She repeated what president Trump has been saying,
and talked about Marco Rubio\'s role, the Congress leader said.

This comes even as India has categorically denied US\' role in the
ceasefire between India and Pakistan in line with the Shimla Agreement
and India\'s foreign policy principle, which maintains that Kashmir is a
bilateral issue between India and Pakistan, where no third party
involvement is allowed. India\'s Operation Sindoor delegation that
recently concluded its visit to the United States had also communicated
India\'s stance against terrorism emanating from Pakistan.

Underlining the significance of taking political parties into
confidence, Ramesh said, \"[[The Prime Minister has met all the MPs who
have gone on delegations. He should call the opposition parties, take
them into confidence. He should have a special session of
parliament.]{.underline}]{.mark} These are challenges. We have to sit
together. We have to have a collective response, a collective will,\" he
said.

The Congress has been demanding a special parliament session since the
launch of Operation Sindoor. The inclusion of opposition members in the
Operation Sindoor delegation was not sufficient, according to Ramesh.

\"[[The Prime Minister should stop playing politics, focus on
governance, and involve opposition parties as
institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}, not just individuals --- the anchor
of our system is political parties, not individuals,\" Ramesh said.

#### Even the mere threat of coalition collapse causes Modi to launch diversionary war in Kashmir. EVERY TIME Modi's popularity declines he attacks Pakistan.

[Indian Prime Minister Narendra [Modi]{.mark} is accused of [using
diversionary tactics to hold onto power and avoid]{.mark} dealing with
[domestic concerns since he joined office in 2014]{.mark}. India's
controlled mainstream media blames Pakistan for internal problems and
portrays Pakistan as a terrorist state in front of Western
powers.]{.underline}

[[It brings together Hindu nationalists, shifts attention from India's
difficulties in the economy or administration, and turns the national
focus to security instead of well-being.]{.mark}]{.underline} It's
important to examine some of the main incidents to understand why the
[Modi government has reportedly]{.underline} **[[turned to Pakistan as a
political target]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[On [April]{.mark} 22, 2025, [the Pahalgam incident was swiftly
politicized by]{.mark} the [Modi]{.mark} government, [staging a false
flag operation]{.mark} to get a response from Pakistan. India launched
airstrikes and missile strikes against the sovereignty of Pakistan,
instead of acting in a genuine way to handle terror. [Later, it became
clear that the move was meant to cover up the BJP's troubles on many
fronts, like the twin challenges.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[Modi took advantage]{.underline}]{.mark} of the attack [[by stirring
anti-Pakistan sentiments to distract attention from his government's
failures.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Similarly[[, the Pulwama attack in February 2019 showed how Modi used
foreign policy issues to turn off voters'
attention]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[As usual, Jaish-e-Mohammad was
accused, ignoring doubts about possible Indian intelligence
failures.]{.underline}]{.mark} After Balakot, many called Modi's
military assault a clear and strong response. [[Given that weeks before
the general elections, many wondered if this incident was somehow used
to help a political party.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Triumph

[[During their election rallies, BJP leaders kept talking about the
airstrikes, helping to reinforce the idea of a ''tough leader against
Pakistan.'']{.underline}]{.mark}

Additionally, Modi alienated Jammu and Kashmir from its ruling autonomy
in August 2019 through Article 370. Analysts say the decision was mainly
designed to please the BJP's Hindu nationalist base, without thinking
about national security. [The [Modi]{.mark} administration [used the
claim that Kashmir is a battlefield between India and Pakistan to avoid
talking about the slowing economy and increasing
unemployment.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Furthermore, [on 18 September 2016,]{.mark} an attack occurred in Uri,
near the Line of Control (LoC). [India]{.mark} immediately [accused
Pakistan of backing]{.mark} the [militants]{.mark} even [without
evidence]{.mark}, [and launched ''surgical strikes'']{.mark} on the LoC.
The [strikes received national attention and served as an election
tool]{.mark} for political parties before state polls. Most television
speeches, political campaigns, and social media featured passionate
anti-Pakistan slogans.]{.underline}

As a result, while people were proud of their country, topics such as
unemployment, rural hardships, and demonetization were pushed aside in
public talks.

Meanwhile, Indian ex-Navy officer and RAW agent Kulbhushan Yadav has
exposed Modi's diversionary tactics and his facist face to the world. He
stated that his job in Pakistan involved supporting terrorism through
collaboration with Baloch insurgents. He acknowledged that he planned to
interact with Baloch insurgents and cooperate with their goals. He
shared that RAW was behind criminal and anti-Pakistan activities
connected to the Baloch liberation movement in strategic areas such as
Gawadar, Pasni, and Jewani.

He disclosed that various operations supported by RAW resulted in the
injury and death of Pakistani citizens. According to Jadav, he performed
certain activities to destabilize Pakistan, and he made his confession
freely, without feeling pressured.

Previously, Indian officials were cautious and balanced towards
Pakistan, but under Modi, harmful comments frequently followed friendly
meetings. Modi's unexpected trip to Pakistan in 2015 and his meeting
with Ex-Premier Pakistan Nawaz Sharif were followed by the attack at
Pathankot in 2016, which led to a big drop in relations. The clear
inconsistencies reveal that [[the BJP's foreign policy is more about
pleasing voters at home]{.underline}]{.mark} than working for real
results abroad. Modi government always promotes rivalry with Pakistan
rather working for the common regional challenges.

Therefore, Indian society, opposition parties, and observers from abroad
have challenged the practices of the Modi government. They claim that
these tactics weaken our democracy, diminish the role of minorities, and
ignore real issues of governance. In addition, Modi needs to stop
playing tactics, get over his RSS ideology, and stop blaming Pakistan.
The Pahalgam attack exposed Modi's true face and isolated him this time
with no Western support.

In a nutshell, Modi's diversionary tactics benefit the BJP's government
by blaming Pakistan and hiding its government failures and its true
fascist face. The Pahalgam, Uri, Pulwama attacks, and the removal of
Article 370 have played an effective role in changing the way people
talk about politics. Talking about possible or actual threats to
national security allows the Modi government to avoid being questioned
about problems within the country.

Making such a decision for political reasons can produce fast results,
but its long-term effects in the country and the region can be dangerous
and intense. Sustainable governance depends on taking responsibility
instead of diverting discussions, meaning a developed democracy
shoulders responsibilities, and chooses peace over excitement from
populist and anti-Pakistan rhetoric

Nuclear?\", February 15, 2018, Outrider,

Accessed July 04, 2025\] // Micah

Two nuclear powers have been at war for decades over disputed territory.
Can they find common ground?

After 70 years, the conflict between India and Pakistan shows no sign of
stopping.

The root of the crisis is a dispute over [[Kashmir,]{.mark} a region
that both nations claim as their own. India and Pakistan have fought
three major wars (and one minor one) over the territory. Today, rival
armies patrol a heavily militarized Line of Control, while terrorist
attacks periodically shatter the peace.]{.underline}

[And both sides have nuclear weapons.]{.underline}

India and Pakistan have an [estimated 130 nuclear weapons
each]{.underline}, as well as the planes, missiles, and ships they need
to deliver them. As a result, [the region [is dangerously close to a war
that could turn nuclear]{.mark}]{.underline}. [If that line were
crossed, the consequences [would devastate]{.mark} the region and could
have disastrous effects on [the entire world.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Britain pulled out of South Asia, splitting its Indian colony along
religious lines: Pakistan was designed as a land for Muslims in South
Asia, while Hindu-majority India became a secular state. Pakistan
consisted of an eastern part and a western part, separated by 1,200
miles of Indian land. But Muslims and Hindus were not living along
geographically clear-cut lines. Many people found themselves on what was
now the wrong side of the border. One million people died in the
horrific sectarian violence that followed the partition. A massive wave
of migration followed the partition, displacing more than 10 million
people. Muslims in India flooded into Pakistan, and Hindus and Sikhs
from Pakistan fled to India. Many others chose to stay where they were
despite the growing divisions. One million people died in the horrific
sectarian violence that followed the partition. 1 of 5 On August 15,

two-thirds of the region was in Indian hands, and the two sides were

explosion.\" Since then, it's reported to have produced around 120-130
nuclear bombs. In 2015, India completed what's known as the "nuclear
triad:" the ability to launch nuclear weapons from the air, land, and
sea. Pakistan's nuclear weapons program started in 1971. That year,
Pakistan fought a war with India that ended in a sound defeat and the
loss of East Pakistan---now Bangladesh. Though it's not clear when
Pakistan built its first bomb, it likely had one by the mid-1980s. The
country performed its first nuclear tests in 1998, after similar tests
by India. Today, Pakistan probably has the same number of warheads as
its rival, and a similar ability to deliver them by air, land, and sea.

Flashpoint terrorism India-controlled Kashmir is home to an ongoing
separatist insurgency that seeks to either gain total independence or
become part of Pakistan. Separatists engage in protests, riots,
guerrilla warfare, and occasional terrorist attacks---all of which raise
tensions between the two countries. The largest militant group opposing
India in the region is Hizbul Mujahideen. The group is based in Kashmir,
but carries out attacks in other parts of India, too. In August 2017,
the U.S. government declared it a terrorist organization. A crowd
watches as fire-fighters move to control a blaze through the facade of

multiple coordinated attacks on the city of Mumbai. Here, locals watch
as the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower Hotel burns after an armed siege. Uriel
Sinai/Getty Images Two other prominent terrorist organizations have also
carried out attacks in India: Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed.
Based in Pakistan, Lashkar-e-Taiba was behind the 2008 attacks that
killed 166 people in India's largest city, Mumbai. Jaish-e-Mohammed is a
homegrown Kashmiri terrorist organization linked to an attack on an
Indian Army base in September 2016 that killed 17 soldiers. Both groups
were likely involved in the 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament. India
claims that Pakistan supports these groups financially and militarily.
Pakistan denies this, saying it only offers "moral support" to rebels
fighting an illegal occupation of Kashmir. In either case, these groups
can be counted on to add fuel to the fire. In a move that is sure to
make matters worse, India officially stripped the Indian-controlled
region of Jammu and Kashmir of its constitutional autonomy and divided
it into two federal territories that would be under tighter Indian
control. India defended its decision, claiming this was necessary to
help end decades of terrorism supported by Pakistan that has plagued the
Kashmir region. This has angered much of the Muslim-majority population
in the territory, who have been protesting the decision. This decision
has also been criticized by Pakistan, who claims control over the entire
Kashmiri region. On October 31, 2019, citizens in Pakistan-controlled
Kashmir took to the streets to protest in support of their Muslim
neighbors. The water war Another problem is ratcheting up tensions in
Kashmir: water. Several major rivers flow from India into Pakistan.
Under the Indus Water Treaty of 1960, India and Pakistan agreed to share
these resources. But a changing climate and growing population have put
more pressure on the demand for water. Suddenly, it seems like there's
not enough. A flowing dam is viewed between the crossing silhouettes of
two mountains. The Baglihar Hydroelectric Power Project spans the Chenab
River in Jammu and Kashmir, India. Under the Indus Water Treaty, the
waters of the Chenab are allocated to Pakistan. ICIMOD Kathmandu After
militants attacked an Indian army base in Kashmir in September 2016,
India declared that it planned to speed up the construction of dams in
Kashmir---which would affect Pakistan's water supply. India also
announced it would stop working with the Indus Waters Commission, which
was established by the Indus Water Treaty. Pakistan has warned that if
India acts against the treaty, it would regard it an act of war. Blood
and water cannot flow together. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi,

The brief military conflict between India and Pakistan in April and May
2025 took many analysts by surprise. Although the two countries lack a
formal peace agreement and have a long history of entrenched hostility
and strategic rivalry, large-scale direct military engagements have been
relatively rare in recent decades. This recent escalation represented
the most significant armed confrontation between New Delhi and Islamabad
since the 1971 war, as noted by numerous regional and international
observers. The hostilities, triggered by a series of cross-border
incidents and retaliatory strikes, rapidly escalated to encompass
conventional air, missile, and drone operations. In the aftermath, both
governments initiated comprehensive military reviews and undertook
reforms aimed at addressing vulnerabilities within their respective
defense postures. Initial assessments suggest that [[the conflict may
signify]{.mark} not a resolution but rather [a shift in the strategic
calculus of both states, potentially ushering in a more volatile
phase]{.mark} of confrontation in South Asia.]{.underline}

[Although both India and Pakistan have publicly claimed military
victories, the ongoing military standoff indicates that **[the conflict
remains unresolved]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Both nations have commenced
extensive military preparations to consolidate their strategic positions
and rectify operational shortcomings. Moreover, both are actively
engaging with international partners to procure critical defense
systems, encompassing offensive and defensive capabilities. This
[[ongoing modernization reflects the persistent security
dilemma]{.underline}]{.mark} in South Asia, where [[mutual suspicion
drives continuous enhancement]{.mark} of]{.underline} military
capacities.

The military escalation occurred only days after a terrorist attack
targeting tourists in Pahalgam, Jammu and Kashmir, India, which resulted
in 26 fatalities, including two foreign nationals, and approximately 20
injuries. Indian intelligence agencies attributed the attack to elements
linked to Pakistan, a claim Islamabad has firmly denied. The
perpetrators were reportedly affiliated with the Pakistan-based militant
group Lashkar-e-Taiba, against which both domestic and international
counterterrorism efforts have long been focused. Notably, the attackers
deliberately targeted individuals belonging to the Hindu community,
exacerbating the sectarian dimensions of the violence. While the
Pakistani military's longstanding associations with various radical
Islamist groups have been widely documented, Islamabad officially denies
these allegations. At the same time, it is important to acknowledge the
high level of professionalism demonstrated by the Pakistani armed
forces.

In response, the Indian military launched a series of successful strikes
against targets within Pakistani territory, including military
installations in urban areas. Pakistan subsequently conducted
retaliatory operations. During the Shangri-La Dialogue security summit
in Singapore, Indian Chief of Defence Staff General Anil Chauhan
publicly confirmed for the first time that Pakistan had succeeded in
downing Indian fighter jets during the confrontation. While he refrained
from specifying the exact number or aircraft models, General Chauhan
disputed Islamabad's claim that six Indian jets were shot down. Media
reports had previously indicated the involvement of Rafale and Mirage
2000 aircraft. On the first day of Operation Sindoor, launched by India,
an extended-range aerial engagement reportedly involved over 100
aircraft from both sides. According to Chauhan, India's air force gained
valuable tactical lessons from the initial engagements, enabling more
effective subsequent strikes on Pakistani targets.

Chauhan further stated that the Indian Air Force penetrated deep into
Pakistani airspace, targeting multiple airbases and what New Delhi
described as "terrorist infrastructure." These strikes reportedly
employed a variety of long-range precision-guided munitions. Pakistan
claimed to have downed several Indian fighter jets, including three
modern French-built Rafale aircraft, and announced the use of
Chinese-origin combat aircraft during operations. Amid these
developments, Pakistan disclosed plans to acquire 40 J-35A
fifth-generation stealth fighter jets from China, with deliveries
anticipated in the first quarter of 2026.

Simultaneously, [[the conflict exposed deficiencies within Pakistan's
defense apparatus.]{.underline}]{.mark} Despite intercepting some Indian
missiles, Pakistani [[air defenses failed to prevent
damage]{.underline}]{.mark} to several key military airbases and
installations. Analysts observed that the confrontation revealed
Islamabad's vulnerability to sustained Indian aerial operations. In
response, Pakistan reportedly plans to procure the HQ-19 advanced
missile defense system from China, to be deployed alongside the J-35A
fighter jets. The HQ-19 is designed primarily to intercept long-range
ballistic missiles but is also capable of engaging supersonic and
subsonic cruise missiles such as India's BrahMos and SCALP-EG, as well
as ballistic systems from the Agni missile series. The BrahMos missile
system[[, a joint Russian-Indian development, demonstrated high
effectiveness]{.underline}]{.mark} during the conflict. Media reports
indicate that [[these missiles enabled India to successfully strike
multiple targets deep within Pakistani territory.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Furthermore, India and Russia engaged in discussions regarding the
supply of Russian S-400 air defense missile systems, the modernization
of Su-30 fighter jets, and the expedited procurement of critical
military equipment, according to TASS. This information was disclosed by
the Indian Ministry of Defence following a meeting between Indian
Defence Minister Rajnath Singh and Russian Defence Minister Andrey
Belousov in Qingdao, China. The Indian Ministry of Defence also noted
that the Russian minister expressed solidarity with India following the
April 22 terrorist attack in Pahalgam.

### 2NC---Use it or lose it

#### Pakistan will face use-it-or-lose-it pressures -- they launch first

Vipin **Narang 14**, associate professor of political science at MIT,
4/12/14, "Why India must stay the nuclear hand,"
https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-india-must-stay-the-nuclear-hand/
//Micah

First, abandoning NFU is strategically unnecessary for India.
Threatening the first use of nuclear weapons is useful for one primary
purpose: to deter a conventionally superior adversary, where the threat
of using nuclear weapons against conventional forces is necessary to
offset the adversary's conventional advantage over passable terrains.

This is really the only scenario that requires a state to contemplate
using nuclear weapons first. But **[[India has conventional superiority
against Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and this gap will only grow in
the future as India incorporates more --- and more advanced ---
platforms into its armed forces. [India does
not]{.underline} [need]{.underline} [the threat of nuclear
weapons]{.underline} [--- or nuclear warfighting ---]{.underline} [to
deter Pakistani]{.underline} [conventional forces from attacking
India]{.underline}. India need only deter nuclear use by Pakistan, for
which its present assured retaliation doctrine is a powerful and
sufficient deterrent.

Some advocates of abandoning NFU point to the fact [[that Pakistan
threatens to use nuclear weapons first against India (precisely because
of India's conventional superiority) and is developing tactical or
battlefield nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark} such as the Nasr system
to deter Indian army operations across the international border.
Therefore, according to former foreign secretary Lalit Mansingh, "There
is a feeling within nuclear experts that because of this changed
scenario, we need to rethink our response as well." But since India
already reserves the right to retaliate against any nuclear use ---
whether from Nasr or Shaheen missiles --- these developments do not
alter the basic deterrent logic or aim of India's retaliatory doctrine.

How will reversing NFU improve India's ability to respond to Pakistani
development of battlefield nuclear weapons? Against China, India has
achieved a greater conventional balance and, in any case, the first use
of nuclear weapons against Chinese ground forces in the likely terrain
of any conflict renders them futile as a practical deterrent.

Second, not only is abandoning NFU unnecessary, it would
make any militarised crisis with Pakistan very dangerous [for
India]{.underline}. [Pakistan does not have
a]{.underline} [nuclear]{.underline} [force guaranteed to survive a
first strike]{.underline} [from India]{.underline}. **[This makes the
threat of first-use]{.underline}** **[by India much
more]{.underline}** **[alarming]{.underline}** **[to
Pakistan.]{.underline}** [[In]{.underline} [a
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}[,]{.underline} [absent a formal NFU
assurance,]{.underline} [Pakistan would have reasons to
fear]{.underline} [a]{.underline} [disarming Indian first strike
and]{.underline} [begin to]{.underline} [**calculate that it is in a
"use them or lose them" situation**, [where it is better off striking
first before India can wipe out its nuclear forces.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[In a]{.underline} [mutual]{.underline} [first-use
world]{.underline} [where at least one side worries about the
survivability of its forces (as Pakistan might),]{.underline} **[the
overriding incentive]{.underline}** **[by]{.underline}** **[both
sides]{.underline}** [**is to "go first"**, before the adversary, so
that one's nuclear weapons are not eliminated by an opponent's first
strike.]{.underline} [India's]{.underline} [formal]{.underline} [NFU]{.underline} [pledge]{.underline} [is]{.underline} [therefore]{.underline} **[a
stabilising firebreak]{.underline}** [that stays both Pakistan's and
India's nuclear hands in a crisis.]{.underline}

Third, formally abandoning NFU would carry significant costs and set a
dangerous precedent in the second nuclear age in which the world
presently finds itself. Having a credible first-use doctrine involves
costly development and intensive management procedures for both
strategic and tactical nuclear weapons, and would carry risks of
inadvertent and unauthorised nuclear use. India has been accepted by the
world (and formally by the Nuclear Suppliers Group) as a legitimate and
responsible nuclear power. Reversing NFU could provocatively undermine
the rightful legitimacy that the NDA and successive UPA governments
achieved.

One could retort that the formal NFU pledge is just words --- words that
Pakistan and China may not even believe. But these words signal intent,
and declaratory nuclear doctrine is an important and valuable window
into a nation's intentions on when and under what conditions it might be
thinking the unthinkable.

### 2NC - May Thumps

#### Despite tensions de-escalating in May, the danger is not passed

NEW DELHI --- [[India and Pakistan have seemingly pulled back from the
brink]{.underline}]{.mark} again. But so much was new about the
nuclear-armed enemies' chaotic four-day clash, and so many of **[[the
underlying accelerants remain volatile,]{.underline}]{.mark}** that
there's [[little to suggest that the truce
represents]{.mark}]{.underline} any [[return to]{.underline}]{.mark} old
patterns of [[restraint.]{.underline}]{.mark}

A new generation of military technology fueled a dizzying aerial
escalation. Waves of airstrikes and anti-aircraft volleys with modern
weapons set the stage. Soon they were joined by weaponized drones en
masse for the first time both along the two countries' extensive
boundaries and deep into their territory --- hundreds of them in the
sky, probing each nation's defenses and striking without risk to any
pilot.

Then the missiles and drones were streaking past the border areas and
deep into India's and Pakistan's territories, directly hitting air and
defense bases, prompting dire threats and the highest level of military
alert.

Only then did international diplomacy --- a crucial factor in past
pullbacks between India and Pakistan --- seem to engage in earnest, at
what felt like the last minute before catastrophe. In a new global
chapter defined by perilous conflicts, distracted leaders and a
retreating sense of international responsibility to keep peace, the
safety net had never seemed thinner.

"[[Going back historically, many of the India-Pakistan conflicts have
been stopped because of external intervention]{.underline}]{.mark},"
said Srinath Raghavan, a military historian and strategic analyst.

Raghavan observed that neither country has a significant military
industrial base, and the need to rely on weapons sales from abroad means
outside pressure can have an effect. [[But the positions of both sides
appeared more extreme this time, and India in particular seemed to want
to see if it could achieve an outcome different from previous
conflicts.]{.underline}]{.mark}

"I think there is a stronger sort of determination, it seems, on the
part of the Indian government to sort of make sure that the Pakistanis
do not feel that they can just get away or get even," he said. "Which
definitely is part of the escalatory thing. Both sides seem to feel that
they cannot let this end with the other side feeling that they have
somehow got the upper hand."

[[The political realities]{.mark}]{.underline} in India and Pakistan ---
each gripped by an entrenched religious nationalism --- [[remain
unchanged after the fighting]{.underline}]{.mark}. And that creates
perhaps the most powerful push toward the kind of confrontation that
could get out of hand again.

Pakistan is dominated by a military establishment that has stifled
civilian institutions and is run by a hard-line general who is a product
of decades of efforts to Islamize the armed forces. And the triumphalism
of [[Hindu nationalism]{.underline}]{.mark}, which is reshaping India's
secular democracy as an overtly Hindu state, [[has driven an
uncompromising approach to Pakistan.]{.underline}]{.mark}

On Sunday, there was still [[no indication that Pakistan or India might
repair their diplomatic relations]{.underline}]{.mark}, which had been
frosty even before the military escalation, or ease visa restrictions on
each other's citizens. And India did not seem to be backing away from
its declaration that it would no longer comply with a river treaty
between the two countries --- a critical factor for Pakistan, which said
that any effort to block water flows would be seen as an act of war.

The spark for the latest fighting was a terrorist attack on the Indian
side of Kashmir that killed 26 civilians on April 22. India accused
Pakistan of supporting the attackers. Pakistan denied any role.

The crisis ended a six-year lull in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi's
Indian government had taken a two-pronged approach to Pakistan: trying
to isolate its neighbor with minimum contact and to bolster security at
home, particularly through heavily militarizing the Indian side of
Kashmir.

### 2NC---No Mediation

#### Modi is done talking

won\'t accept \'third-party mediation\'\", June 18, 2025, BBC News,

// Micah

Indian Prime Minister Narendra [[Modi]{.mark}]{.underline} has
[[told]{.mark} US President Donald [Trump]{.mark} that **[Delhi will
never accept third-party mediation with Pakistan]{.mark}** on the issue
of Kashmir, India\'s senior-most diplomat said.]{.underline}

Foreign secretary Vikram Misri said [that Modi \"strongly\" conveyed
India\'s long-held stand to Trump during a phone call between the two
leaders on Tuesday.]{.underline}

[[Trump]{.mark}]{.underline} has [[repeatedly
offered]{.underline}]{.mark} to mediate between India and Pakistan to
solve the \"Kashmir issue\" since a four-day conflict between the
nuclear-armed neighbours in May.

The White House has not commented on India\'s statement.

Mr Misri also said that Modi told Trump \"clearly\" that during the
duration of the conflict, \"no talks were held at any level on the
India-America trade deal or on the mediation between India and Pakistan
by America\".

Trump has repeatedly claimed that India and Pakistan ended the conflict
after a ceasefire brokered by the US and also that he used trade as a
lever to make them agree. Pakistan has backed US claims of brokering the
ceasefire but India has denied it.

\"The talks regarding cessation of military action were held directly
between India and Pakistan under the existing channels established
between both militaries,\" Mr Misri said.

Last month, [Trump told reporters: \"I said, \'Come on, we\'re going to
do a lot of trade with you guys \[India and Pakistan\]. Let\'s stop it.
Let\'s stop it. If you stop it, we\'ll do a trade. If you don\'t stop
it, we\'re not going to do any trade.\'\"]{.underline}

Delhi is rushing to negotiate a trade deal with the Trump administration
before a 90-day pause on higher tariffs ends on 9 July.

Trump\'s mediation offer on Kashmir puts India in a tight spot

How India and Pakistan share one of the world\'s most dangerous borders

Kashmir is a contentious issue for both India and and Pakistan, who
claim the region in whole, but administer it only in part. [[Bilateral
talks]{.underline}]{.mark} over several decades **[[have not led to any
resolution.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[[India treats Kashmir as]{.mark} an integral part of [its
territory]{.mark} and **[rules out any negotiation]{.mark}**,
particularly through a third party.]{.underline}

Tensions escalated between the South Asian neighbours after India blamed
Pakistan for a 22 April attack on tourists in Indian-administered
Kashmir in which 26 people, mainly tourists, were killed. Islamabad
denied the charge.

In May, India carried out air strikes on what it called terrorist
infrastructure inside Pakistan, leading to four days of intense military
action from both sides of the border.

Both countries accused each other of targeting airbases and other
military sites.

As the conflict between the two nuclear-armed nations threatened to
escalate further, Trump announced on 10 May that India and Pakistan had
agreed to a \"full and immediate ceasefire\", brokered by the US.

[Later, in a post on Truth Social, he said: \"I will work with you both
to see if, after a thousand years, a solution can be arrived at,
concerning Kashmir.\" (The Kashmir issue only dates back to
1947).]{.underline}

A statement by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio the same day said that
the two countries had also agreed \"to start talks on a broad set of
issues at a neutral site\".

On 11 May, Trump repeated praise for India and Pakistan\'s leaders for
understanding it was \"time to stop the current aggression\", adding
that he was proud the US \"was able to help you arrive at this historic
and heroic decision\".

After Trump\'s statement on the ceasefire, Pakistan\'s foreign minister
said the agreement had been reached by the two countries, adding that
\"three dozen countries\" were involved in the diplomacy.

India has, however, consistently denied any intervention by the US.

Analysts say [[Trump\'s very public statements]{.underline}]{.mark} on
offers of mediation over Kashmir **[[have tested Delhi\'s red lines on
the issue.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Delhi has always encouraged its Western partners not to treat India and
Pakistan as equals. It also discourages western leaders from undertaking
visits to India and Pakistan at the same time.

But [Trump\'s tweets often hold India and Pakistan as equals. This has
caused some discomfort in Delhi\'s diplomatic circles but analysts
believe it\'s too early to say whether this will affect ongoing trade
deal talks between Washington and Delhi.]{.underline}

WASHINGTON/ISLAMABAD/NEW DELHI, June 18 (Reuters) - [U.S. President
Donald [Trump hosted Pakistan\'s army chief]{.mark}]{.underline} Field
Marshal Asim Munir at the White House on Wednesday in an unprecedented
meeting that risked [[worsening a disagreement with
India]{.mark}]{.underline} over the president\'s claim that he stopped
last month\'s conflict between the nuclear-armed South Asian foes.

The lunch meeting was the first time a U.S. president had hosted the
head of Pakistan\'s army, widely regarded as the most powerful figure in
the country, at the White House unaccompanied by senior Pakistani
civilian officials.

Trump said he was honoured to meet Munir and that they had discussed
Iran, which he said Pakistan knew better than most. Trump told reporters
he had thanked Munir for ending the war with India, for which he also
praised Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who he spoke to on Tuesday
night.

\"Two very smart people decided not to keep going with that war; that
could have been a nuclear war,\" Trump told reporters.

Pakistan\'s military said in a statement that the two discussed trade,
economic development, and cryptocurrency during the two-hour meeting and
also exchanged views on tensions between Israel and Iran.

\"President [[Trump expressed keen interest in forging a mutually
beneficial trade partnership with Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark} based on
long-term strategic convergence and shared interests,\" the army said.

Munir had been expected to press Trump not to enter Israel\'s war with
Iran and seek a ceasefire, Pakistani officials and experts said. A
section of Pakistan\'s embassy in Washington represents Iran\'s
interests in the United States, as Tehran does not have diplomatic
relations with the U.S.

Pakistan has condemned Israel\'s airstrikes against Iran, saying they
violate international law and threaten regional stability.

The meeting represented a major boost in U.S.-Pakistan ties, which had
largely languished under Trump and his predecessor Joe Biden, as both
courted India as part of efforts to push back against China.

Asked earlier what he wanted to achieve from meeting Munir, [[Trump told
reporters]{.underline}]{.mark}: \"**[[Well, I stopped a war \... I love
Pakistan.]{.underline}]{.mark}** I think Modi is a fantastic man. I
spoke to him last night. We\'re going to make a trade deal with Modi of
India.

\"But I stopped the war between Pakistan and India. This man was
extremely influential in stopping it from the Pakistan side, Modi from
the India side and others,\" he said. \"They were going at it - and
they\'re both nuclear countries. I got it stopped.\"

White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said Trump hosted Munir after he
called for the president to be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for
preventing a nuclear war between India and Pakistan.

NO MEDIATION

Trump had said last month that the neighbours agreed to a ceasefire
after talks mediated by the U.S., and that the hostilities ended when he
urged the countries to focus on trade instead of war.

[However, [Modi told Trump in their call on Tuesday that the ceasefire
was achieved through talks between the Indian and Pakistani militaries
and not U.S. mediation,]{.mark} India\'s most senior diplomat, Foreign
Secretary Vikram Misri, said in a statement.]{.underline}

[[Pakistan has thanked Washington for playing a mediating role, however,
while India has repeatedly denied any third-party mediation.]{.mark}
Tuesday\'s phone call between Modi and]{.underline} Trump was the two
leaders\' first direct exchange since the May 7-10 conflict.

\"PM Modi told President Trump clearly that during this period, there
was no talk at any stage on subjects like India-U.S. trade deal or U.S.
mediation between India and Pakistan,\" Misri said.

\"Talks for ceasing military action happened directly between India and
Pakistan through existing military channels, and on the insistence of
Pakistan. Prime Minister Modi emphasised that India has not accepted
mediation in the past and will never do.\"

Misri said Modi and Trump had been due to meet on the sidelines of the
G7 summit in Canada but Trump left a day early due to the Middle East
situation.

Trump asked Modi if he could stop by the U.S. on his return from Canada,
Misri said, but the Indian leader expressed his inability to do so due
to a pre-decided schedule.

The heaviest fighting in decades between India and Pakistan was sparked
by an April 22 attack in Indian Kashmir that killed 26 people. New Delhi
blamed \"terrorists\" backed by Pakistan, a charge Islamabad denies.

Pakistan has previously said the ceasefire happened after its military
returned a call the Indian military initiated.

On May 7, Indian jets bombed what New Delhi called \"terrorist
infrastructure\" sites across the border, triggering tit-for-tat strikes
spread over four days in which both sides used fighter jets, missiles,
drones and artillery.

Michael Kugelman, of the Asia Pacific Foundation think tank, said
[[India-U.S. ties,]{.underline}]{.mark} which have thrived in recent
years, [[could suffer if Trump continued to make remarks about a U.S.
role in the ceasefire and offered U.S. mediation on
Kashmir]{.underline}]{.mark}, a Himalayan territory India and Pakistan
both claim.

\"For Delhi, it all boils down to an age-old question: How much can it
tolerate U.S.-Pakistan cooperation without having it spoil U.S.-India
relations --- a partnership that's thrived in recent years despite
continued U.S.-Pakistan links,\" he said.

[A [nuclear war between India and Pakistan]{.mark} [would]{.mark} set
off a global famine that could kill two billion people and effectively
[end human civilization]{.mark}, a study said Tuesday.]{.underline}

[[Even if limited in scope]{.underline}]{.mark}, [a conflict with
nuclear weapons [would wreak havoc in the atmosphere and devastate crop
yields]{.mark}, with the effects multiplied as global food markets went
into turmoil, the report said.]{.underline}

The Nobel Peace Prize-winning International Physicians for the
Prevention of Nuclear War and Physicians for Social Responsibility
released an initial peer-reviewed study in April 2012 that predicted a
nuclear famine could kill more than a billion people.

In a second edition, the groups said they widely underestimated the
impact in China and calculated that the world\'s most populous country
would face severe food insecurity.

\"A billion people dead in the developing world is obviously a
catastrophe unparalleled in human history. But then if you add to that
the possibility of another 1.3 billion people in China being at risk, we
are entering something that is clearly the end of civilization,\" said
Ira Helfand, the report\'s author.

Helfand said that the study looked at India and Pakistan due to the
longstanding tensions between the nuclear-armed states, which have
fought three full-fledged wars since independence and partition in 1947.

But Helfand said that the planet would expect a similar apocalyptic
impact from any limited nuclear war. Modern nuclear weapons are far more
powerful than the US bombs that killed more than 200,000 people in
Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945.

\"With a large war between the United States and Russia, we are talking
about the possible - not certain, but possible - extinction of the human
race.

\"In this kind of war, biologically there are going to be people
surviving somewhere on the planet but the chaos that would result from
this will dwarf anything we\'ve ever seen,\" Helfand said.

The study said that the black carbon aerosol particles kicked into the
atmosphere by a South Asian nuclear war would reduce US corn and soybean
production by around 10 percent over a decade.

The particles would also reduce China\'s rice production by an average
of 21 percent over four years and by another 10 percent over the
following six years.

The updated study also found severe effects on China\'s wheat, which is
vital to the country despite its association with rice.

China\'s wheat production would plunge by 50 percent the first year
after the nuclear war and would still be 31 percent below baseline a
decade later, it said.

The study said it was impossible to estimate the exact impact of nuclear
war. He called for further research, voicing alarm that policymakers in
nuclear powers were not looking more thoroughly at the idea of a nuclear
famine.

But he said, ultimately, the only answer was the abolition of nuclear
weapons.

\"[This is a [disaster so massive]{.mark} in scale that really [no
preparation is possible]{.mark}]{.underline}. We must prevent this,\" he
said.

President Barack Obama pledged in 2009 to work toward abolition but said
that the United States would keep nuclear weapons so long as others
exist. Nine countries are believed to possess nuclear weapons, with
Russia and the United States holding the vast majority.

Policy Recommendations

Considering the exponentially [increasing]{.underline} [multi spectrum
Sino-Russian cooperation]{.underline}, including in the Arctic, [it is
imperative for India not only to enhance its bilateral cooperation with
Russia]{.underline} on the Arctic, [but also to]{.underline} whole
heartedly [support]{.underline} the [Russian proposal of enhanced
**BRICS+ engagement** in the region]{.underline}. Not only would [this
provide Russia an alternative to the coercive Chinese
embrace]{.underline}, [it would also permit Indian scientists access to
the Russian]{.underline} scientific [laboratories, equipment and
data.]{.underline} It would also open the Russian Arctic to Indian
industries engaged in telecommunications, mining, oil and gas sectors,
coal, diamond, timber, healthcare, remote diagnostics, ports
infrastructure, to name a few. Enhanced Indian engagement would also
result in diluting the A7 monopoly in the Arctic affairs and help
overcome several inequities in the Artic Council as applicable to an
Observer State such as India. [It is recommended that India set up a
separate Working Group on enhancing bilateral cooperation with Russia in
the Arctic]{.underline} under the Economic, Scientific, Technological
and Cultural Cooperation (IRIGC-TEC). Such a mechanism was set up
between Russia and China in 2017.

[It is also recommended]{.underline} that [India take up coordinated
positions on Arctic within the BRICS,]{.underline} to [prevent getting
blindsided]{.underline} at the last minute [by]{.underline} jointly
[coordinated Russian and Chinese proposals]{.underline}. Already, there
appears to be some movement on this. During a recent telephone
conversation between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister
of India Narendra Modi, they agreed to develop a roadmap for further
evolution of bilateral cooperation. They also had a useful exchange of
views on various regional and global issues, including Russia's
Presidency of the BRICS.102 [It appears that the Russians are keen to
engage with India on the Arctic.]{.underline}

In the recent Press conference of the External Affairs Minister at
Moscow he spoke about discussions with the Russians about connectivity -
connectivity from Western India through the INSTC, from Eastern India
from Chennai to Vladivostok and the polar route. [Various areas where
India's polar capabilities could be enhanced in collaboration with
Russia were also discussed with his Russian counterpart]{.underline}.103

The [BRICS countries have already been implementing various projects in
the Arctic at the bilateral level]{.underline} between Russia and China,
between Russia and India. However, [there are some
challenges]{.underline} and limitations [to the bilateral format of
BRICS cooperation]{.underline} in the Arctic. [For]{.underline}
[example, India is a close partner of the United States, and this factor
might or might not play a **negative role** in Russia-India Arctic
cooperation some time in the future. China and India are trying to
prevent dependence on one country and build a complex system of
multilateral relations]{.underline}, providing a strong negotiating
position in relations with Russia in the Arctic. China and India largely
rely on the system of bilateral relations with many Arctic states as the
most effective tool to promote their interests in the Arctic. [Russia
also does not want to rely on one partner in the Arctic -- China -- and
is interested in diversifying its Arctic partners]{.underline}. [Russia
intends to create a kind of balance to China's active participation in
the Arctic.]{.underline} Against this background, [Brazil could become a
reliable and stable partner of Russia in the energy sector of Arctic
cooperation]{.underline}. On top of that, [the conflicting character of
China-India relations impedes the bilateral Arctic
cooperation]{.underline}.

Many of these [challenges to the bilateral format of BRICS cooperation
in the Arctic can be tackled if the BRICS countries pursue Arctic
cooperation multilaterally]{.underline}. On the one hand, multilateral
format will help to reduce the dependency of one country on the other
country. On the other hand, given the BRICS experience, some bilateral
problems subdues when countries cooperate multilaterally within BRICS
format. The most prominent example is [China and India]{.underline}
which [are more cooperative with each other within BRICS rather than
bilaterally]{.underline}. That is why the multilateral format of
cooperation sometimes seems to be the preferred form of cooperation in
order to avoid the emergence of new disagreements.

Meanwhile, though BRICS starts to gradually include Arctic issues in its
agenda, till now the intra-[BRICS cooperation has been]{.underline}
developing [primarily]{.underline} between the so-called 'group of RIC
countries' ([Russia, India, and China]{.underline}). And the RIC is
supposedly will be the most likely multilateral format of the Arctic
cooperation of these countries in the near future. At least until Brazil
becomes the observer in the Arctic Council.

Still, [it is quite possible to identify promising areas for possible
participation]{.underline} of BRICS countries at different levels of the
Arctic cooperation. First of all, BRICS can participate as a large
investor in the Arctic through the New Development Bank. Further, the
most promising areas of cooperation between the BRICS countries are
cooperation in the field of environmental protection (design and
implementation of regulatory frameworks, expansion of measures of
disaster prevention and remediation, etc.) and scientific activities
(climate change, marine biology, glaciology, geology, etc.). Besides,
[there are 'opportunities for collaborative initiatives in fisheries,
mining, oil and gas, shipping, shipbuilding, port construction, urban
development and tourism']{.underline}.Footnote47 A[rctic cooperation can
become the basis for the implementation of joint multilateral investment
projects that would rise to a new level economic cooperation among the
BRICS states]{.underline}.

#### BRICS instability causes nuclear war

Cynthia **Roberts 19**, Professor of Political Science at Hunter
College, City University of New York and Research Scholar at the
Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies at Columbia University, PhD,
MPhil, and MA from Columbia University, "The BRICS in the Era of Renewed
Great Power Competition", Strategic Analysis, Volume 43, Issue 6, Taylor
& Francis

[The [BRICS are at]{.mark} a **[turbulent crossroads]{.mark}** as
renewed **great power competition** intersects with **countervailing
tendencies** in the emerging multipolar arena. Their [success depends
**avoiding**]{.mark}]{.underline} the external costs and **[[domestic
pathologies]{.underline}]{.mark}** generated by great power friction.
Emerging multipolarity provides opportunities for manoeuvre, but only if
outsized China accommodates the other BRICS as it competes against the
United States. The BRICS' strongest common aversion concerns American
hegemony and its weaponization of finance. BRICS states are defensively
motivated to develop mechanisms to limit infringements on their
sovereignty and autonomy. However, in China and Russia financial
nationalism is also rising, bolstering Renminbi internationalization.

The multilateral group known as the BRICs (Brazil, Russia, India,
China\*) first emerged during the era of post-Cold War American hegemony
when the international economic order was open and offered tangible
benefits, but shaped by unrivalled American power while US alliances
dominated the international security landscape. Washington expected no
great power challengers to emerge after the collapse of the Soviet
Union, a point on which many international relations scholars concurred,
discounting China's potential power.1 At the same time, China's economic
heft---which amounted to less than 20 per cent of US GDP \[in purchasing
power parity (PPP) terms\] in 1990 and still only about 36 per cent in
2000---had not yet dwarfed the other BRICs members (see Figure 1).
Seeking to maintain its pre-eminent position by actively deterring peer
competitors and co-opting potential opponents, the United States
facilitated conditions for these emerging powers to behave as joiners in
multilateral economic institutions, such as Bretton Woods and in
international markets, but not in ways that displace America's hegemonic
positions and privileges and they were not welcome in US alliances.2

Sensitive to the costs of provoking a backlash by the incumbent powers
and the need to keep their diverse coalition of democratic and
authoritarian regimes intact, the [[BRICs **adhere**]{.mark}d [to
a]{.mark}]{.underline} moderate [[**revisionist**
strategy]{.underline}]{.mark} of the Bretton Woods order as their
economies grew, and China soared. China surpassed the United States as
the world's largest economy (measured in purchasing power parity) in
2014 (see Figure 1), as the largest trading nation in 2013, and from
2000 to 2014 grew more than four times the global rate in market
exchange-rate (MER) terms, although it is still about a decade away from
catching up to the US in output measured in MER (see Figure 2). When the
Global Financial Crisis revealed that the United States was neither
omnipotent nor a guaranteed reliable steward of the international
economic order, the [BRICS questioned whether the Bretton Woods order
was 'losing legitimacy and effectiveness.']{.underline}3 The crisis
emboldened the BRICS states not only to seek seats at the top tables as
creditors but also some redistribution of power to new institutions,
such as from the Group of 7 (G7) to the G20 to speed their rankings
among the prominent global rule-makers. As Figure 3 shows, the five
BRICS' share of global output (owing mostly to China), even measured in
MER, strikingly surpassed the European Union (EU) in 2015, and the
combined GDP of the BRICS even passed the G7 in PPP terms in 2016 (see
Figure 1). This was despite the tapering of growth in all of the BRICS,
with the exception of India, and lopsided falloff of Russia, South
Africa and Brazil (see Figure 4).

Perceiving American weakness and a general decline of the West, the
BRICS as a whole, and China, in particular, also began to experiment
with parallel international financial institutions, such as the BRICS
Development Bank and the Chinese-sponsored Asian Infrastructure
Investment Bank (AIIB) both created in 2015.4 The latter especially
rankled the United States and former Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers
declared its creation and 'the failure of the US to persuade dozens of
its traditional allies ... to stay out of it' marked 'the moment the
United States lost its role as the underwriter of the global economic
system' (see Figure 5 for the distribution of shareholders). Summers
blamed Washington, not China, for failing to take concrete
steps---including International Monetary Fund (IMF) governance reforms
pushed by BRICS---to substantially adjust the global economic
architecture so that it better reflects the economic size of China and
India and other emerging economies that now account for at least half of
global economic output, and address their frustrations finding financing
for needed infrastructure funds given pervasive restrictions set by
US-backed development banks. Summers was primarily concerned with a loss
of American leadership, assessing that China and other emerging
economies were not radical revisionists seeking to topple the
international economic order from which they greatly benefited.5

President Donald Trump turned the diagnosis of disengaged US leadership
over a sound liberal international order on its head, blaming China for
breaking the rules through forced technology transfers in exchange for
US access to the growing Chinese market, predatory licencing practices,
theft of intellectual property and the state-sponsored acquisition of
American companies. Notwithstanding the validity of such claims, Trump
is pursuing nationalist and protection remedies that could spiral into
reciprocal moves that ultimately undermine the existing structures and
destabilize international relations.

With broad bipartisan support, the Trump administration also aims to
counter Russia's assertive moves to expand its reach, including through
influence campaigns, cyber tools, and limited military interventions.
This was as Putin and Xi were deepening their partnership. In 2019, the
Director of National Intelligence assessed that China and Russia are
'more aligned than at any point since the mid-1950s.'6 Outside the BRICS
format, both Russia and China are converting economic gains to military
modernization programmes and leveraging national capacity to expand
their geopolitical influence in their surrounding regions and overseas,
while attempting to deny control to the US and its allies. Responding to
these challenges, the Trump administration declared engagement a failure
and in December 2017 the National Security Strategy issued by the White
House announced that the United States was re-entering an era of great
power competition, in which China and Russia 'want to shape a world
antithetical to US values and interests.'7

This article examines the intersection of renewed great power
competition with countervailing tendencies in the emerging multipolar
arena as others hedge and resist being drawn into great powers
standoffs, while navigating President Trump's disruptive policy swings.
What do these antithetical tendencies imply for the BRICS countries? Can
the BRICS states successfully navigate between the Scylla of a dangerous
great power competition involving two BRICS heavyweights against the
current hegemon and the Charybdis of losing the BRICS cement, breaking
apart, and having to go it alone, whether or not the existing order
fragments? Given that China is the dominant economic power propelling
the BRICS, larger than the other members combined, its strategies and
preferences in the new era of great power competition are likely to have
an outsized impact on the future existence of BRICS.

The evidence suggests that China was the first in this competition to
embrace an ambitious great power strategy for Chinese supremacy well
before the election of Donald Trump. One may recall that Deng Xiaoping,
appreciating that rising powers need to avoid provoking a backlash from
the incumbent powers while still on the way up, developed a 14-character
strategic guideline 'tao guang yang hui' \[keep a low profile and bide
our time\] at the end of the Cold War when the United States became
China's chief threat. Deng admonished Chinese leaders to 'observe
calmly, secure our position, cope with affairs calmly, hide our
capacities and bide our time, maintain a low profile, and never claim
leadership.' Although Deng did not advise when to abandon the
non-assertiveness posture, a more confident President Xi Jinping
jettisoned tao guang yang hui in favour of a strategy premised initially
on co-equal great powers. Then, Xi launched a host of still more
ambitious initiatives---including through its 'Made in China
2025'programme---to dominate key growth industries in high technology,
such as advanced chip design, artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics
and to realize military modernization by 2035 and become a first-tier
force by 2049. Thus, by the 100th anniversary of the Chinese revolution,
Beijing's strategy is to realize a modern and powerful China by ensuring
that China's comprehensive national power and international influence
will be at the forefront of world politics and civilization. In so
doing, Xi's strategy is programmed to lead to the fulfilment of the
'Chinese dream,' a vision he articulated for the nation's future in
November 2012 to build a moderately prosperous society and realize
national rejuvenation.

Whether such lofty national aspirations are helpful modernization
milestones or self-defeating, tone-deaf nationalist programmes that
engender a new cycle of protectionist backlashes by Washington to avoid
further loss of comparative advantage in the US, or worse, is not yet
clear. However, it is notable that some American elites and officials
are so alarmed by China's rapid rise as a military technological
powerhouse that they see it as a major---even existential---threat to US
dominance.8 They doubt the possibility of any bargain to end the trade
war, which is seen as a central front in the competition for global
supremacy. Moreover, in contrast to Cold War competition with the Soviet
Union, many US strategists fear China is a more formidable competitor
and 'beating the Americans at their own Game.'9

The first section below considers the likely consequences of two
competing tendencies propelled by great power competition and the
diffusion of power and emerging multipolar arena. Next, it turns to the
tools that major powers employ in economic and financial competition
beyond the blunt tariffs currently wielded by the Trump administration
that often prove self-defeating. US currency and financial power is one
of the hegemon's most potent weapons, and in greater use than ever
before in American history.10 All of the BRICS countries at one point
have suffered wounds from the US sanctions sword and it is one of their
foremost common aversions. Both collectively and individually, they are
defensively motivated to find mechanisms to limit infringements on their
monetary sovereignty and national autonomy. In both Russia and China, in
particular, financial nationalism is also rising in parallel with a
desire for international status and influence.11 Beyond the
weaponization of finance,12 the analysis here leaves aside the military
dimensions of great power competition given their lesser relevance to
the institutionalized evolution of the BRICS.

Tendencies generated by great power competitive politics

Within five years of Xi's change of strategy, abandoning the
non-assertiveness posture embodied in China's 'peaceful rise,' it is
notable that the United States refocused its strategic priorities for
the first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union, first with the
National Security Strategy in 2017 and then the National Defense
Strategy in 2018. According to the National Defense Strategy, 'The
central challenge to US prosperity and security ... is the reemergence
of long-term, strategic competition by ... revisionist powers.'13 Russia
and China are identified as the major powers seeking to dominate their
regions, shift the balances of power in Europe and Asia against the
United States, and project power globally. The Trump administration and
many analysts trace China's rise to the failed attempt to integrate
communist and post-communist states into the liberal rules-based
order.14 Although bolstered by widespread, bipartisan support for a new
strategy to counter the threats posed by these great power rivals, its
precise parameters and scope are being contested as the Trump
administration struggles to formulate effective policies to counter
rival powers' influence on multiple fronts. Despite the world's largest
defence budget in absolute terms (not as a percentage of GDP), the US
has been one of the most efficient great powers in history. Now it faces
competitors, particularly China, which are ramping up their efforts
asymmetrically and technologically, but competing at lower cost to their
economies, unlike the Soviet Union during the Cold War.

[Competitive [**great power** politics are]{.mark}]{.underline}
occasionally cooperative and plus sum---sometimes [[zero
sum---with]{.mark} the **[risk of war]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and mostly
in the domain of relative gains and losses, which involves positional
struggles, [relational power, and shifts in the **balance of power**.
**[Nuclear]{.mark}** great [powers]{.mark}, in particular, [have a
stake]{.mark} in [avoiding]{.mark} negative sum [outcomes, where
**everyone loses**]{.mark}, not only [in]{.mark}]{.underline} global
financial crises and [**econ[omi]{.mark}c depressions** but also in
**[crises]{.mark}** and **conflicts** [that]{.mark} may
**[escalate]{.mark}** to **all-out war**]{.underline}. As great power
competition becomes the driving force of national policy it is likely to
shape foreign policy in four important ways:

First, it sharpens distinctions between friends and foes, and pushes
others to choose sides, both domestically and internationally, in
political, security and economic domains. The trade war could be the tip
of an iceberg in drawing lines. Demands for protection from Chinese
goods and unfair trade practices have been growing over time.15 After
Beijing joined the World Trade Organization (WTO), a 'China shock'
followed, greatly disrupting the international division of labour, US
comparative advantage, and especially US industry.16 China's use of
economic statecraft leveraging large investment flows through the Belt
and Road Initiative (BRI) and development of anti-access/area denial
(A2/AD) capabilities in the South and East China Seas fosters
geo-economic influence backed by coercive power. Russia's asymmetric
political warfare campaigns against open democratic societies in the
West and A2/AD capabilities in Eastern Europe add fuel to the bipartisan
wellspring of support to shift US strategy beyond the initial course
correction initiated by President Barack Obama. That containment
strategy included bolstering defences and trip wires in Europe and
negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade treaty, which all the
major presidential candidates running in 2016 opposed.

Second, great power competition tends to strengthen nationalist and
protectionist coalitions and policies. When this Innenpolitik drives
intensified economic and geopolitical competition, it can create
negative feedback loops as in security dilemmas, increasing the
possibility of conflict.17 For example, China is a growing target of a
nascent coalition, including Washington political and economic hawks,
military industrialists and industries affected by globalization, such
as coal and steel. However, an offset of this tendency is that producers
that have supported protectionism in the past, such as the automotive
sector, now often depend on China not for cheap labour but as one of the
world's largest consumer markets. Thus, General Motors (GM) sold more
vehicles in 2018 to Chinese buyers than to Americans, including
Cadillacs which posted the highest sales in the luxury brand's 116-year
history, primarily on the strength of GM's performance in China. Before
the start of the trade war, US multinational corporations were creating
jobs in China at roughly four times the rate of increase than in the
United States and prefer to build their products where their sales are
highest.

In China, the coalition of party nationalists, government bureaucrats,
and the state-owned enterprise sector has a significant built-in
advantage in the authoritarian state capitalist system and is currently
edging out the loose coalition of liberal economic reformers and private
sector advocates since Xi's turn away from the market-oriented reform
that generated astonishing economic growth for more than three decades.
Private sector firms accounted for 70 per cent of China's output and the
most successful Chinese technology companies, such as Alibaba, Baidu and
Tencent. However, in 2012, Xi shifted to a more statist approach and
greater economic and political control, despite poor economic results
for the SOEs.18

In Russia, the security of the regime and protecting the privileges of
the elite become more intertwined with and justified by great power
threats, despite popular support for improved relations with the West
and the fact that Russia needs capital for development. It is the only
BRICS economy that has invested more abroad than it has received in
foreign investment.19

Third, great power competition elevates the saliency of national
security issues over wealth enhancing agendas and blurs security and
trade concerns. This tendency further bolsters protectionism and
restrictions given the perceived spillover costs of open trade to
national security. China systematically blocks imports of most US
manufactures (with few exceptions, e.g. semiconductors and Boeing
aircraft). Washington is now putting pressure on US firms to reduce
perceived vulnerabilities from China's large role in supply chains and
the national security dangers of doing with business with Chinese
technology giants, such as ZTE and Huawei. China's whole of government
policies that contribute to market dominance in key sectors and
inability to credibly commit in any trade deal that the party-state
would never interfere in the private sector for security purposes go to
the core of US concerns about Chinese high technology.20

However, [great power competition runs the risk of **financial
ruin**]{.underline} if ambitions exceed resources and strategists fail
to establish priorities that help bend the cost curve. Feelings of
Schadenfreude over [[Russia's]{.mark} economic
**[stagnation]{.mark}**]{.underline} and general decline, despite
Moscow's ability to mobilize its national capacity in support of its
extensive military modernization programme, [[will
**sting**]{.underline}]{.mark} if US fiscal imbalances over the next
decade require a significant reduction in the share of GDP that the
United States can devote to military spending. Successful competitors
adopt durable cost-efficient strategies that impose disproportionate
costs and competitive disadvantages on their opponents while keeping
their own in check.

Fourth, great power competition widens the lens through which
psychological biases may operate to distort information processing and
rational decision-making. Under such conditions, Jervis shows that
'people are slow to alter incorrect beliefs in the face of discrepant
information; historical analogies are applied promiscuously;
subtle---and not so subtle---signals rarely are interpreted as the
sender intends; and a person who has become committed to a particular
course of action may underestimate its risks.'21

[A [worst-case]{.mark} outcome [is]{.mark} when [**economic
competition** intensifies **military**]{.mark} **competition** [and
**escalates** to]{.mark} **military [conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline},22
perhaps spurred by erroneous beliefs, such as over-optimism about the
balance of forces and resolve. **[A]{.underline}**nother [bad outcome
could emerge from faulty attempts to pursue competitive great power
politics, strengthening **[nationalist]{.mark}**, **protectionist** and
**security [coalitions]{.mark}** [in opposing]{.mark} great
[powers]{.mark} while **[leav]{.mark}**ing [the]{.mark} initial [side
with]{.mark} a **[weak]{.mark}**er [capacity]{.mark} to

4.2. Cognitive Differences

[BRICS]{.underline} members [have **varying**]{.underline} strategic
[goals]{.underline} and priorities [in the Arctic, which limits
the]{.underline} breadth and [depth of cooperation]{.underline}. As an
Arctic state, [Russia\'s Arctic strategy integrates multiple objectives,
including]{.underline} resource [development, shipping]{.underline}
route utilization, [and]{.underline} national [security]{.underline},
with a tendency to maintain its dominant position in the Arctic,
characterized by regional and exclusive features. [In contrast, China
adopts a more global perspective, focusing on]{.underline} Arctic
climate change, [scientific exploration,]{.underline} and potential
economic benefits, with a broader and longer-term strategic orientation
(Mammadli, & Kalfaoglu, 2021). At the same time, [the]{.underline}
long-standing historical [border dispute between India and China, as
well as Russia\'s misgivings about China\'s intentions]{.underline} for
its activities in the Arctic, [constitute notable obstacles on the road
to Arctic scientific cooperation]{.underline} (Sagild, & Elgsaas, 2024).
[India has long pursued a]{.underline} \"pragmatic
[policy]{.underline},[\" and the **spillover effects** of
the]{.underline} Russia-[Ukraine conflict have left it wavering in the
Arctic situation]{.underline}. [Under]{.underline} the leadership of
Prime Minister Narendra [Modi]{.underline}, [India has increasingly
strengthened its Arctic presence]{.underline}, [deepening partnerships
with Arctic countries and continuously focusing on shipping]{.underline}
route development [and scientific research,]{.underline} particularly
the impact of Arctic climate change on its domestic agriculture.
Currently, India conducts research activities on Svalbard through the
Ny-Ålesund research station operated by the Norwegian company Kings Bay
AS. However, [India is also acutely aware of the geopolitical
complexities in the Arctic, especially]{.underline} the
[uncertainties]{.underline} brought by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and
has therefore adopted a relatively cautious approach in its Arctic
strategic deployment, avoiding excessive involvement in regional
disputes. Brazil has also shown increasing interest in the Arctic,
signaling emerging powers\' renewed recognition of the Arctic\'s
strategic value. In contrast, South Africa and new BRICS members have
limited interest in the Arctic and have not fully integrated into the
Arctic interest landscape. [These differences in strategic cognition and
positioning lead to divergent priorities, path choices, and cooperation
models among BRICS countries in Arctic cooperation, limiting the breadth
and depth of collaboration and making it difficult to form effective
synergies.]{.underline}

3.3. India

[India]{.underline}, as a long-time active participant in Arctic
affairs, [has]{.underline} continuously [deepened its research in areas
such as Arctic climate monitoring, glacier changes, and biodiversity
protection]{.underline} through its strong scientific capabilities and
international cooperation networks. Fundamentally, [India\'s actions aim
to seek more diversified Arctic partnerships to consolidate its Arctic
position]{.underline}. On one hand, [India\'s Arctic participation is
closely tied to Russia]{.underline}. As an Arctic stakeholder, [India
relies on Russia]{.underline}, an Arctic state, [to play its role as an
observer in the Arctic Council.]{.underline} Additionally, [India\'s
Arctic activities are primarily concentrated in bilateral cooperation
with Russia, with Russian scientific laboratories]{.underline},
equipment, and data being indispensable to India\'s Arctic endeavors. On
the other hand, [India has long been committed to promoting multilateral
cooperation]{.underline} mechanisms, having established Arctic
cooperation with countries such as Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway,
the United States, Canada, Japan, and South Korea. [To further
participate in Arctic affairs, India not only **needs to strengthen**
bilateral cooperation with Russia]{.underline} in the Arctic [but also
expand its cooperation within the BRICS framework. Arctic scientific
cooperation under the BRICS]{.underline} framework [can]{.underline}
[provide India with a platform to collaborate with other members on
Arctic]{.underline} research projects, enhancing exchanges and
cooperation in science, technology, and policy, reducing India\'s
over-reliance on Russia in Arctic affairs, [and increasing India\'s
influence in Arctic matters]{.underline}.

vector of BRICS cooperation has not been pronounced yet, [the idea to
develop cooperation in the Arctic as a new vector of intra-BRICS
cooperation has been circulating in the expert circles of the BRICS
countries.]{.underline} In 2016, for example, scholars from USSR,
Brazil, India and China in the framework of the annual Assembly of the
Arctic Circle in Reykjavik (Iceland) organised a panel session titled
'BRICS in the Arctic: Emerging Opportunities for Collaborative
Initiatives'. At the end of the panel session, [the participants
concluded that 'in general, the BRICS could seek opportunities for joint
work in the Arctic in areas of common interest and expertise, in
science, technology, environment and commerce']{.underline}.Footnote6

development of scientific research in the Arctic within the BRICS format

5\. Conclusion

[Given the]{.underline} profound and [complex changes in the Arctic
geopolitical environment]{.underline} triggered by the Russia-Ukraine
conflict, [Russia]{.underline} has [identified BRICS as a crucial Arctic
cooperation mechanism]{.underline}. [Strengthening Arctic scientific
cooperation within the BRICS]{.underline} framework has been elevated to
a strategic priority for BRICS members [to]{.underline} deeply [engage
in and integrate into the Arctic governance system.]{.underline} In the
future, [promoting]{.underline} Arctic [scientific cooperation within
the BRICS]{.underline} framework will require leveraging various Arctic
legal instruments and platforms, using the Russia-Ukraine conflict as an
opportunity to expand BRICS countries\' Arctic participation and
maintain peaceful development in the Arctic region. The [addition of new
members]{.underline} such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab
Emirates, Iran, and Ethiopia following [the]{.underline} 2024 [BRICS
expansion provides an opportunity for BRICS to expand its cooperation
network. BRICS members need to pay more attention to and promote
internal coordination]{.underline} and cooperation, [quickly
establishing a dedicated internal mechanism for Arctic scientific
cooperation to jointly address external challenges such as Arctic \"bloc
confrontation\"]{.underline} and the turbulence caused by major
political events. In summary, [Arctic scientific cooperation within the
BRICS framework not only reflects the close collaboration and knowledge
sharing among BRICS members in scientific research]{.underline} but also
[signifies an active exploration and innovation]{.underline} of
[multidimensional governance models in the Arctic,]{.underline}
[contributing to the construction of a new Arctic governance landscape
based on scientific consensus and emphasizing multilateral
principles.]{.underline}

India's Perspectives and Concerns

New Orientation for Reformed Multilateralism94 is the title of the
Concept Note in the UNSC Open Debate which India had chaired on December
2022. Here, [India]{.underline} had [argued that the multilateral
structures reflect the existing realities]{.underline} and not those
which existed in 1945. This convergence on [multipolarity is the core of
India-Russia relationship]{.underline}. [Russia's BRICS theme of
strengthening multilateralism]{.underline} also resonates with India's
own outlook. However, [within the BRICS, China]{.underline}, at times in
concert with Russia, [is pushing for the forum towards an anti-Western
construct]{.underline}, to become a full-scale rival to the G7. [That
position is not subscribed to by India, which wants the BRICS to be a
forum **for pursuing economic interests**]{.underline} [of the
developing countrie]{.underline}s.95

There are [increasing indications of the BRICS' alignment with
the]{.underline} Chinese Belt and Road Initiative ([BRI]{.underline}).96
[This is of concern to India as the BRI violates Indian
sovereignty]{.underline} in the form of the China Pakistan Economic
Corridor (CPEC) which passes through a part of Indian territory. Hence
India is not a part of the initiative.

There are also questions whether BRICS, in the diversity of its member
states, can achieve the same cohesion as that of the G7. In this aspect,
one is reminded of the Russia, India, China (RIC) trilateral. As a
strategic grouping, RIC was the idea of former Russian Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov as "a counterbalance to the Western alliance"97 and it
was founded on the basis of "ending its subservient foreign policy
guided by the U.S.", and "renewing old ties with India and fostering the
newly discovered friendship with China."98 But even as several meetings
have been held, even at the summit level, the last being in 2019,
nothing much has come of that.

[If the Arctic and Polar interests]{.underline} (including Antarctica
and Himalayas) [of the BRICS and the SCO countries are critically
evaluated,]{.underline} apart from Russia, [only India, China, Brazil
and South Africa could be considered to have significant stakes. If only
the Arctic is considered, that boils down only to India and China. The
Russian Arctic can potentially address India's energy security needs as
well as her deficiencies in strategic and rare earth
minerals.]{.underline}

Russia's increasing isolation in the Arctic benefits China. Yamal LNG,
in which Chinese entities have a 29.9 percent stake while over 60
percent of machinery used in construction is said to be Chinese, is an
example. This isolation is providing increasing leverages to China over
Russia. Another example is that of the SCO. The Central Asian
constituents of the grouping were all part of the erstwhile Soviet Union
and even after its disintegration, Russia continued to hold sway for a
long time. Even then, in 2023, China has overtaken Russia as the main
trading partner of all the five Central Asian states. Increasing
dependence of Russia on China is not beneficial for India. [It is in
India's long-term strategic interest to wean Russia away from Chinese
embrace by providing suitable alternatives in terms of markets, finance,
access, manpower and where possible, technology]{.underline}.

[China seeks a multipolar world but wants a unipolar
Asia.]{.underline}99 Two-thirds of China's arms exports are to India's
neighbours - Pakistan, Bangladesh and Myanmar.100 It seeks to contain
India within the South Asia. But despite the bilateral relationship,
which has really taken a nose-dive after the Doklam standoff in 2017 and
the border clashes in 2020, [India and China have worked constructively
in BRICS,]{.underline} SCO, G20 and the World Trade Organisation (WTO).

[Russia, having excellent bilateral partnerships with India as well as
China, desires the two to have better relations.]{.underline} In the
words of Sergei Lavrov, "We have excellent relation with India and
excellent relation with China. We are interested in these two great
nations to be friends and we are trying to be helpful."101 [One possible
option for Russia, with Arctic Council Observers India and China, could
be to seek a more inclusive and equitable Council. This would result in
better Asian perspective on Arctic and a more balanced
Council.]{.underline}

China and the BRICS

According to a [recent poll]{.underline} conducted by the European
Council on Foreign Relations, most [[people]{.mark} both [within and
beyond the West]{.mark} now [believe]{.mark} that [the US-led liberal
order is passing away]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Even
as]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [Ukraine]{.mark} wa]{.underline}r has
[[consolidated support for US leadership]{.underline}]{.mark} across the
Global North, [it has [accelerated a loss]{.mark} of [confidence in
US-led institutions]{.mark} across the Global South. No country is more
pivotal to this shift than China.]{.underline}

Among the 1.2 billion people who inhabit the world's liberal
democracies, the University of Cambridge report shows, 75 percent now
hold a negative view of China, while 87 percent hold a negative view of
Russia. However, for the 6.3 billion people who live in the rest of the
world, the picture is reversed. [[Across the Glob]{.mark}al South, [70
percent feel positively toward China]{.mark}, and [66]{.mark} percent
feel [positively toward Russia]{.mark}. Together with [the]{.mark}
rising [influence of]{.mark} the [BRICS]{.mark} group of nations
(Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa), this growing North-South
divide [is accelerating a shift to a multipolar
order]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Translating [its economic clout into geopolitical

[But China is not alone. Constituting 41 percent of the world's

[Unlike the BRICS]{.underline}, [Western institutions led by Washington
are united by core values like democracy]{.underline}.
[NATO,]{.underline} the pillar of the West, [is the most successful
international organization in history.]{.underline} Despite its critics,
this shield has successfully protected North American and European
democracies since the end of World War 2. In fact, [no revisionist state
has attempted to use military force to violate the territorial integrity
of a NATO member state for nearly eight decades.]{.underline}
Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for other Eurasian countries
outside the alliance, such as Cyprus, Georgia, Moldova, and Ukraine.
[NATO's success is replicated by other Western
institutions,]{.underline} which include political establishments like
the European Union, diplomatic forums such as the G7, a [long list of
free trade agreements, and security pacts between the United States and
Japan, Washington and Seoul, and AUKUS.]{.underline}

The [BRICS is a house of cards, **not a strategic threat** to the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. Even [if the "bloc" succeeds
in expanding China's economic tentacles and projecting Chinese power in
the short-term, the BRICS is still plagued by divergent interests and
internal tensions]{.underline} that have doomed it to failure. While
Beijing is just learning how to build long-lasting alliances, Washington
has centuries worth of experience in spearheading and managing
complicated but mutually beneficial bilateral and multilateral
partnerships. Given NATO's rejuvenation, the global coalition in support
of Ukraine, the emergence of AUKUS, the trilateral summit between
America, Japan and Korea, and the looming Saudi Israeli peace agreement,
[US-led initiatives will remain indispensable for global diplomacy and
security long into the future. The risk of being threatened -- let alone
replaced -- by a paper tiger like the BRICS is slim to
none]{.underline}.

## Track II 

### Solvency---Science Diplomacy 

#### Track II promotes Scientific Diplomacy

Beyond track 1 and track 2

[Another opportunity to make progress]{.underline} in this conflicted
space [is]{.underline} to [consider]{.underline} the potential [roles of
different actors]{.underline}. [Much]{.underline} academic
[discussion]{.underline} has [focused on track 1 diplomacy]{.underline},
or formal diplomacy, [suggesting that track 2,]{.underline} or informal,
[efforts were largely a spillover from scientific
cooperation.]{.underline} However, the reality has been more nuanced.
[Sometimes projects initiated by track 1 players have been **enacted by
track 2 actors**]{.underline}. During the Obama era, for example, the US
National Academy of Sciences played an active role in mediating the
intended rapprochement with Cuba. Conversely, t[rack 2 activities have
led to significant diplomatic achievements. The scientifically led
International Geophysical Year]{.underline} of 1957--58 [resulted in the
Antarctic Treaty. Track 1 and 2 approaches are not separate, but
increasingly intertwined.]{.underline}

Inevitably, direct national interests will be primarily driven by the
political processes determining economic and security policy. [Domestic
scientific communities strive to show their relevance to their national
funders by supporting such efforts.]{.underline} But at the same time,
it has been [the global scientific community that has brought attention
to climate change, biodiversity loss, pandemic risks, and many other
existential threats which require concerted]{.underline}, [collective
action]{.underline}. In this [narrowing]{.underline} window of
[opportunities to make progress]{.underline} on critically important
global goals, t[rack 2 science diplomacy may become even more
necessary]{.underline}. For example, the activities proposed for the
2032 International Polar Year, which emphasizes involvement and
coproduction of knowledge between a range of Arctic stakeholders, could
help to reduce diplomatic tensions and build relationships.

A [renewed emphasis on track 2]{.underline}, or a hybrid approach
utilizing both tracks, [would actually be returning to a role **the
international science community**]{.underline} h[as often played in
history. In the eighteenth centur]{.underline}y, for example, scientists
worked across conflicted nations on issues of common interest, such as
gathering measurements of the transit of Venus from multiple sites to
estimate the solar unit. But in [the current context of rapid change in
science when inter-nation tensions are high, track 2 efforts could be an
important tool]{.underline}.

#### Track II science diplomacy solves all issues

Peter **Gluckman 24**, Sir, President of the International Science
Council, gave a keynote address on science diplomacy at a side event to
the Pact of the Future at the United Nations Headquarters, "Building
bridges through science diplomacy: accelerating progress towards
sustainable development", *Koi Tū Centre for Informed Futures*,
<https://informedfutures.org/building-bridges-through-science-diplomacy/>,
September 20, 2024

As the [conditions]{.underline} that [gave value to science diplomacy
change, its practice must evolve.]{.underline} Although [science
diplomacy has,]{.underline} at times, [seemed]{.underline} [academic, it
is a key linkage between the]{.underline} very [different worlds of
diplomacy]{.underline} and science for all our futures.

[In this confused and conflicted space]{.underline}, we must consider
the potential roles of different actors. Formal diplomatic processes
must be informed by science and [the international science community has
a key role in advancing track 2 efforts]{.underline} which, given the
context, may take on greater importance.

The International Science Council (ISC) is unique in its membership
including the world's scientific academies and international scientific
organisations from the global north, south, east and west and across
both the natural and social sciences. [Increasingly it has both seen the
need to and been requested to take a **greater role in track 2
diplomacy**.]{.underline}

Today we are in an era where domestic science, economic and national
security policies can conflict with broader objectives related to the
global commons. [Diplomats]{.underline} will [need to take a
multi-stakeholder approach]{.underline}--- [including governments,
business and academia]{.underline}. [The global community must
give]{.underline} greater [support to the international science
community]{.underline} allowing it to be an integral partner rather than
simply a tokenistic afterthought

Realpolitik demands that first and foremost [science diplomacy must
serve]{.underline} a [nation's interests.]{.underline} Science diplomacy
can do so [in domains such as security, trade, environmental
management]{.underline} [and technology access.]{.underline} But it must
also be recognised by governments that it is in every nation's interest
to advance the global commons. [Here science diplomacy has a critical
domestic role to ensure nations]{.underline} understand their interests
are served [by]{.underline} acting collaboratively. [Track 2 science
diplomacy]{.underline} can be a valued partner to [a]{.underline}
somewhat stuttering [multilateral]{.underline} [system]{.underline}.

Too few countries have embedded science diplomacy within their
diplomatic toolkit. Only with [science advisors within foreign
ministries connected]{.underline} to [domestic science]{.underline}
communities, can the two-way interplay [between track 1 and track 2
approaches become more effectiv]{.underline}e.

### Solvency---Warming 

#### Track two efforts solve environmental issues best

Transnational Issues: **[Track two diplomacy is an instrument through
which Washington should promote Northeast Asian regional cooperation to
address transnational crime and environmental degradation. Unilateral
initiatives can, by definition, only ever pose a partial solution to
problems that transcend national borders. Consequently, track two
diplomacy can be highly effective in areas of international concern
where ongoing regional coordination, transparency and cooperation are
needed]{.underline}**. Given that Northeast Asia already encompasses
several regimes tied to transnational issue areas, the challenge facing
the next administration will be to sustain the commitment of parties to
these initiatives and ensure they remain effectively embedded in policy
channels. **[Transnational crime]{.underline}**, including drugs
smuggling, c**[ounterfeiting]{.underline}**, maritime **[piracy
and]{.underline}** activities linked to **[terrorism are beginning to be
effectively addressed at the regional level in Northeast Asia. US
participation, through]{.underline}** track one and **[track two, will
help boost initiatives]{.underline}** such as the Shanghai International
Maritime Forum, established in November 2007 **[to set standards for
maritime security]{.underline}** **[in shipping routes subject to piracy
and drug smuggling such as the Malacca Straits. The Forum has served as
a track two framework for debate on establishing protocols for oil
spills and the transportation of hazardous materials in Asia. The
environment will be a crucial determinant of Asia's
future]{.underline}** stability and prosperity, **[and the United States
has an interest in ensuring that coordinated and effective solutions
that both ensure energy security and address climate change are
found.]{.underline}** Frameworks such as the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum already serve as a framework to develop a regional
response to climate change, and **[track two diplomacy can
supplement]{.underline}** these **[encouraging first steps within an
established regime]{.underline}**. The Asia Pacific Partnership on
Energy and Climate, spearheaded by the US and Australia, and
incorporating China, Japan, India and the ROK, represents a positive
step toward a coordinated regional response focusing on clean
technologies. **[In ensuring that existing agreements are adhered to,
Washington should build confidence through track two mechanisms for
monitoring of emissions and sharing of best practices.]{.underline}**
Washington should harness Beijing's efforts to brand the 2008 Olympic
Games as the 'green games' to encourage greater Chinese leadership in
environmental initiatives focusing on the Asia Pacific and developing
nations.

## Security K 

### 1NC---Link---Climate Change

#### Frames of security are coopted and militarized---that [subverts]{.underline} any solvency and decreases climate mitigation

The impetus for [securitizing climate change]{.underline} is often about
prioritizing the issue and galvanizing transformative action for
mitigation and adaptation. The reality of securitizing an issue,
however, is that it tends to [promote militarized and authoritarian
responses to address real or perceived existential threats]{.underline}.
This report aims to raise awareness about the risks of securitizing the
climate crisis for the future of civic space and human rights and to
consider opportunities to prevent and mitigate some of these risks
through disruption and innovation.

The report argues that efforts to securitize climate change are already
underway but their significance and implications are yet to be
determined. It identifies three pathways to securitizing the climate
crisis - prioritization, militarization, and authoritarianization --
which create distinctive risks for the future of civic space and human
rights. And it highlights the opportunities to address some of these
risks by raising awareness among key actors, actively shaping the
currently unsettled meaning of 'climate security' and advancing
alternative frames such as 'climate justice', and embedding meaningful
civic participation and human rights considerations in the evolving
architecture for climate change adaptation and mitigation.

In exploring these risks and opportunities, the report draws on insights
and lessons from the experience with the war on terror and the spread of
global counterterrorism over the past two decades. These insights are
useful for two reasons. First, [the war on terror has been a key driver
of the closing civic space phenomenon as governments increasingly use
counterterrorism and national security discourse, laws and policies to
restrict rights and freedoms of association, assembly and
expression]{.underline} (Hayes and Joshi 2020; Ní Aoláin et al. 2023).
[A securitized response to the climate crisis]{.underline} is likely to
[enable governments to]{.underline} repurpose and [redeploy some of
these security measures and instruments, and to adopt new restrictions
on civic space]{.underline} (Joshi 2020). Second, mapping and analyzing
the pathways of the war on terror provides critical insights into the
nature and logic of emergency frames and securitization processes more
generally. While [climate change and terrorism]{.underline} are clearly
very different, both [have been framed as an existential threat that
requires a global response]{.underline}, albeit so far by different
actors and for different purposes. The lessons from the war on terror
can help us to project future pathways for securitizing climate change,
anticipating some of the risks involved and identifying openings for
disrupting and developing alternatives.

Our findings have broader implications for addressing the climate
crisis. Prioritizing climate action will be critical for reducing
greenhouse gas emissions and averting climate catastrophe. There is a
risk, however, that [prioritization advocates and narratives that use
the language of security may be co-opted and]{.underline} their goals
[subverted by militarization and authoritarianization.]{.underline} And
that [militarized and authoritarian responses become a substitute for
the]{.underline} kind of far-reaching [action needed to address the
causes and drivers of climate change. Militarization,]{.underline} for
example, [is already underway and]{.underline} there is a risk that it
[may divert attention and resources away from climate mitigation and
resilience and subvert climate justice.]{.underline} There are parallels
here with the ways in which the war on terror ended up 'mowing the lawn'
rather than dealing with the structural causes of terrorism.
